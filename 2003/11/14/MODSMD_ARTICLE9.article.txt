# Waite speaks on time as a hostage

### EUGENIE KIM 
Despite years of isolation and
suffering as a hostage, world
renowned humanitarian Terry
Waite was able to emerge still be
lieving in the goodness of human na
ture, a message he conveyed in a
speech last night. He spoke to stu
dents and community members
about his experiences as a hostage in
Lebanon beginning in 1987 and last
ing for 1,763 days.
Waite said that he underwent an
"interior journey" during captivity,
and that he was lucky to be able to
derive meaning from his five-year
experience.
"All the points you learn from a
situation in extremity are, in essence,

very simple," Waite said. "We don't
live in a just and fair world, of course.
Suffering isn't equally spread out, of
course. But I think that I can say with
confidence that in most cases, suffer
ing need not destroy."
At the time of his capture, Waite
was a humanitarian hostage negotia
tor working for the Archbishop of
Canterbury and had already success
fully negotiated the release of
hostages in Iran and Libya. Howev
er, his cooperation with members of
the Islamic fundamentalist group
Hezbollah resulted in his own cap
ture when a misunderstanding led
them to believe that he was involved
in the Iran-contra affair.
Waite said that the moment he

realized that he had been imprisoned, his immediate and initial
reaction was anger. However, he quickly formed three personal
rules that helped him to endure his situation as a hostage: "no
regrets, no self-pity and no over-sentimentality."
Even after five years of captivity, four of which were spent in
solitary confinement, Waite said that he emerged without a
sense of resentment toward his captors and continued to lead his
life in pursuit of social justice.
"I was careful not to let my initial anger turn to bitterness,"
Waite said. "I believe that there is futility in bitterness. [My cap
tors] had seen nothing but fighting, warfare and misery for the
whole of their lives. I tried to put myself in their position and say,
'What would I have done, if I had been on the receiving end of
such injustice?'"
Although Waite suffered physically as a result of malnutri
tion, torture and lack of connection to the outside world, he said
that his greatest challenge lay in the mental and emotional suf
fering that he experienced in solitary confinement.
"I remember my beard, which was black, turning long and
white," he said. "I remember my skin turning white from lack of
exposure to sunlight; I remember watching my muscles deterio
rate. I remember thinking to myself... 'My God, you're grow
ing old before your time.' And I wondered whether that would
happen to me internally mentally and spiritually."
To keep from losing his mind, Waite said that he practiced
arithmetic and recited passages in literature that he had memo
rized over the years. He stressed the importance of mental ac
tivity as his only recourse to express his freedom in his extreme
situation.
"Luckily, I had a respect and love for language," he said. "I
wrote my first book in my head, entirely without any pencils or
paper."
In addition to his mental exercises, Waite never gave up
searching for other human contact, tapping on the walls of his
cell every night in the hopes of finding another captive. After
three years of tapping, he finally heard a response from the
other side of the wall. Through their rudimentary alphabetical
code, he understood that his fellow captives had a radio, which
they used to relay news to him about the outside world.
"From them, I heard about the end of apartheid, the fall of
the Berlin Wall," he said.
When he was finally able to rejoin the outside world that he fol
lowed for months on the radio, he said that he realized his experi
ence in solitary confinement had helped him gain the courage to
change his job and work for himself. He began to write, to lecture
and to continue his efforts in the humanitarian sector.
The students who attended the lecture were amazed at
Waite's experience and the positive lessons that he extracted
from his five years of captivity.
"I thought he was truly inspirational," said junior Carolyn
Chiang. "The tapping on the wall and the way that [the
hostages] found a way to communicate with each other was re
ally significant."
Junior Kiira Mancasola agreed, saying, "His strength of mind
and his capacity to be rational to deal with his experience inter
nally just blew me away."
Waite's talk was the second event of the year for the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau.
"He is a really interesting public figure from his history as a
hostage negotiator and as a hostage himself," said junior Josh
Meltzer, the community relations officer for the ASSU. "He's
also been really active in humanitarian organizations."
