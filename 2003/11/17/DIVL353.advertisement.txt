Very few diaspora Palestinians
have written memoirs as intimate
as Ghada Karmi's frank account of
her life: her childhood in
Palestine, the flight to Britain
after the catastrophe of 1948, and
coming of age in the coffee-bars
of Golders Green, the middle-class
Jewish quarter in North London. A
gentle humour describes the
bizarre and sometimes tense real
ities that mask her life in "Little
Tel Aviv' and, later, her struggle,
like that of many other women in
the late fifties, to get
a university grant to study
medicine. The intimacy of the
book is set against the continuing
crisis in the Middle East. In
her case it is not an account of
physical hardships and abuse. Her
immediate family was lucky. But
as she grew older, memories of the
lost homeland began to haunt her
Her anger grows at the self
deception of most Israelis, who
justify the appalling actions of
their governments by pretending
that what is taking place isn't
actually happening.
