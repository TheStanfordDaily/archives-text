Please join us for an evening of discussion about the role that spirituality
plays in women's friendships. Hear personal stories from two Stanford
women and their own interfaith friendship. Discuss how spirituality functions
in your relationships, and how it can strengthen bonds and create friendships
with those from different backgrounds. But, mainly, enjoy a study break with
free food while lounging on cushy sofas and catching up with friends. Feel
free to bring knitting needles!
