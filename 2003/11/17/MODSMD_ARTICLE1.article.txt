# GSC arranges funding for 6th Thanksgiving
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council opened online
sign-ups yesterday for its annual Thanksgiving
dinner, which will be held on Thanksgiving Day at
Wilbur Marketplace. Tresidder Union, the tradi
tional venue for the dinner, is still under renova
tion and lacks the kitchen facilities necessary to
keep food warm throughout the afternoon.
The council does not expect the venue change
to deter people from attending. It anticipates
about 1,400 attendees this Thanksgiving—loo
more than last year according to Donald Sze, a
graduate student in electrical engineering who is
organizing the dinner.
The council is working with Director of Meet
ing Services Jeanette Smith-Laws to hire a caterer.
"Our main goal is to select a caterer that pro
vides delicious meals for both turkey lovers and
vegetarians at the best price," Sze said.
In the selection process, eight to 10 council
members sample each potential Thanksgiving
plate and pose suggestions, while Smith-Laws ne
gotiates pricing.
Even with a favorable catering contract, fund
ing the event is difficult.
"Anyone who has gone to the event surely rec
ognizes the fine catering and amount of people
served, but most students probably can't imagine
the amount of fundraising done and the generosi
ty of not only the central administration but of
their own schools as well," said fundraising orga
nizer Michelle Zamora.
The council covers approximately 35 percent of
the expenses, according to Sze, making the organi
zation the largest contributor of funds.
The dinner is supported through several other
campus organizations, including the offices of the
president and provost, the University's academic
schools, the Stanford Alumni Association, the
Graduate Student Programming Board and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
This year, Stanford Dining Services is provid
ing poster advertisements and china for the din-
ner, in addition to financial assis
tance, while the Treehouse has of
fered to sponsor the drinks to be
served that evening.
The office of Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni also
supports the event financially.
"I think it's great that the spirit of
fellowship and giving that is so much
a part of Thanksgiving dinner will be
shared with students who wouldn't
otherwise have a place to go,"
Awakuni said.
According to Zamora, student
polls in the past have indicated many
would be willing to pay a small fee to
attend the dinner. Nonetheless, "It

remains our utmost concern to con
tinue to offer this great event at no
charge to students and guests," she
said.
The most difficult part of plan
ning the event is being sure to have
enough volunteer help on Thanks
giving Day, according to Steve Alli
son, council chair.
Sze said that because the dinner
takes place near the end of fall quar
ter, it is a good opportunity to take a
break from work and catch up with
friends.
For international students,
Thanksgiving at Stanford can be a
pivotal experience, organizers say.
"It's a great way to introduce for
eign students to the American tradi
tion of Thanksgiving," Zamora said.
The Thanksgiving event also
works to combat feelings of isolation

among students who are not able to
spend Thanksgiving with family.
"It lets students know that at
Stanford there is a community, and
that there are people and institu
tions that care about them and value
them," said Robert Rudnitsky, one
of the council's founders.
According to Rudnitsky, the tra
dition began years ago when Marcia
Keating, a Physics Department ad
ministrator, began to invite first
year graduate students without
other plans to her home for the holi
day.
Keating's hospitality inspired
Rudnitsky and fellow graduate stu
dent Harris Shapiro to organize
their own campus Thanksgiving
event six years ago. Later, that event
expanded to welcome undergradu
ates as well.
