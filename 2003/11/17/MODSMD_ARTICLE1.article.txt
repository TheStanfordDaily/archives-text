The Graduate Student Council opened online
sign-ups yesterday for its annual Thanksgiving
dinner, which will be held on Thanksgiving Day at
Wilbur Marketplace. Tresidder Union, the tradi

keep food warm throughout the afternoon.
The council does not expect the venue change

about 1,400 attendees this Thanksgivingâ€”loo

graduate student in electrical engineering who is
organizing the dinner.
The council is working with Director of Meet

members sample each potential Thanksgiving
plate and pose suggestions, while Smith-Laws ne
gotiates pricing.

"Anyone who has gone to the event surely rec
ognizes the fine catering and amount of people
served, but most students probably can't imagine
the amount of fundraising done and the generosi
ty of not only the central administration but of
their own schools as well," said fundraising orga
nizer Michelle Zamora.
The council covers approximately 35 percent of
the expenses, according to Sze, making the organi

The dinner is supported through several other
campus organizations, including the offices of the
president and provost, the University's academic
schools, the Stanford Alumni Association, the
Graduate Student Programming Board and the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
