# Student groups should reach out
## 
### 
This past Saturday, the Stanford Mock Trial
team and the Stanford Pre-Law Society
co-sponsored the Second Annual Stan
ford High School Mock Trial Symposium.
The symposium, which included two speakers and
eight workshops, brought approximately 130 Bay
Area high school students to campus to learn
about law school and mock trial techniques. These
two organizations should be commended for pro
viding a valuable service to those beyond the bor
ders of Stanford.
Student groups that are not focused on commu
nity service should still try to provide outreach pro
gramming. Groups like the Mock Trial team and
the Pre-Law Society have special skills and knowl
edge. They are in a unique position to help certain
segments of the larger Bay Area community, even
though they were not particularly formed to pro
vide such services. More University groups should
follow in these two groups' footsteps by playing on
their respective strengths to provide events or ser
vices to those both on and off the campus.
We believe these types of efforts by student
groups would increase if the University could

make more funding available specifically for out
reach and community service. Most student
groups suffer from tight budgets, which make al
truistic efforts particularly difficult to carry out. A
growth in available funding or grants would help
offset the financial burden of holding such func
tions, allowing members of groups to put their en
ergy, time and talents toward a good cause.
In addition to benefiting the community at large,
outreach programs and services help bolster Stan
ford's reputation across the Bay Area. In the case
of the Stanford Mock Trial High School Sympo
sium, many of the high school students expressed
interest in applying to and attending Stanford.
Stanford should have more opportunities for
high school students and other community mem
bers to come on the campus for something other
than sporting events. Although time is always
scarce at Stanford, more student groups should
look for ways to connect with the community at
large. Additionally, the University should try to se
cure more funding to ensure that all student
groups have more opportunity to reach out to oth
ers in the Bay Area.
