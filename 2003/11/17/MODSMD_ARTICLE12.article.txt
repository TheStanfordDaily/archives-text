## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK How bad are our dorms, really? 
### 
I was first exposed to the squalor of
college housing when I was a senior
in high school and spent a weekend
with my older sister Erin at UC-
Berkeley. She shared a tiny, dank room
in an equally tiny, dank house where the
towels never seemed to dry, a sour smell
emanated from the carpet and water
damage created scatological stains on
the droopy ceiling tiles.
If I had to five there, my first impulse
would be to crawl under the bunk bed
and will myself to die, but Erin's opti
mism remained unfazed. She put out
vases of fresh flowers to brighten the
dark corners and covered the cigarette
burns on the sofa with a fuzzy throw.
This is just one reason why my sister
is my favorite person in the whole, wide
world. In general, my friends often tell
me that "she's just like you, but, you
know, nicer."
I don't take this as an insult, but as a
simple fact. Erin has always been the
nice one: The one who untangled the
Christmas fights, updated the wall calen
dar, put floating candles in the bath
room and listened to Peabo Bryson
records. She made our house which
my parents used primarily to showcase
their Bible-scene tapestries and 1988
Seoul Olympics memorabilia a lot
less ugly; almost pleasant, even.
But her talent for home decor was
sadly wasted in Berkeley's cement
block landscape. Meanwhile, I ended up
at Stanford, the Bay Area's finest coun
try club and resort. It hardly seems fair.
So when I began to complain about my
winter quarter housing assignment, Erin
was understandably unsympathetic.
"Guaranteed housing!?" she exclaimed.

"You don't know how good you have it
I mean really Jen, you don't know."
"Yes I do know!" I replied defensive
ly. "I just want it better. Is that so wrong?"

She sighed, "All
I'm saying is, be
grateful. I toured a
co-op one year
where someone had
taken a dump in the
hallway. At least you
don't have to deal
with that."
Put in perspec
tive, the sheer dis
gustingness of that
image really makes

Stanford look like paradise. I mean, I
might joke that the residents of Colum
bae and Sigma Chi live in shit, but I doubt
that they've ever actually had to step over
it. Compared to other schools in similar
ly compacted housing markets, Stanford
gives you little to complain about.
But honestly, the day I get tired of
complaining is the day I get tired of life.
My situation drawing alone and un
preferred sucks. Sucks! No one can
convince me that my housing is anything
special when 2,273 students before me
didn't want it. Even worse, I'll be assigned
a random roommate; one who could turn
my year into a therapist's dream.
Every roommate I've been paired
with thus far has been wonderful, giving
me reason to believe that my luck is wear
ing thin. I can only defy the odds so many
times... There are quite a few weird
people at Stanford people who I do
not want to live with. (If you haven't no
ticed this by now, then you are probably
one of them. Please stay away from me.)

Living in the Oxford House, once
again matched with an ideal roommate,
has only amplified my fears. The stu
dents who come here are among the
most intellectual, independent and self
motivated at Stanford; in other words,
they can be really freaking weird. Some
times I feel like I'm in "Oxford:
Semester at SLE."
But I'd much rather live with an anti
socialite than a nutcase who venomous
ly hates me or becomes obsessed with
me and then tries to take over my life.
The truly scary thing is that I might not
notice her freakish tendencies right
away, leaving me unprepared when they
eventually leak out and attack.
For example, at an Oxford conve
nience store last week, I saw one of my
seemingly normal housemates system
atically break candy bars in half by the
boxful under the counter while the
cashier obliviously rang up her purchas
es. That's just fucked up. Who does
that? lam truly afraid of her... I think
her coat is made out of puppies.
It's amazing how much of an impact
your roommate can have on your col
lege experience. The possible outcomes
vary drastically between making a new
best friend for life and waking up in the
morning missing patches of hair. I'll try
to adopt my sister's optimism for as long
as I can next quarter, but if I start wear
ing hats everyday, my living situation
must be pretty dire.

Jennie Kim is a junior who will be living
in Mirlo next quarter when she comes
back from Stanford in Oxford. E-mail

would be greatly appreciated.

ly compacted housing markets, Stanford
gives you little to complain about.
But honestly, the day I get tired of
complaining is the day I get tired of life.
My situation drawing alone and un
preferred sucks. Sucks! No one can
convince me that my housing is anything
special when 2,273 students before me
didn't want it. Even worse, I'll be assigned
a random roommate; one who could turn
my year into a therapist's dream.
Every roommate I've been paired
with thus far has been wonderful, giving
me reason to believe that my luck is wear
ing thin. I can only defy the odds so many
times... There are quite a few weird
people at Stanford people who I do
not want to live with. (If you haven't no
ticed this by now, then you are probably
one of them. Please stay away from me.)

Living in the Oxford House, once
again matched with an ideal roommate,
has only amplified my fears. The stu
dents who come here are among the
most intellectual, independent and self
motivated at Stanford; in other words,
they can be really freaking weird. Some
times I feel like I'm in "Oxford:
Semester at SLE."
But I'd much rather live with an anti
socialite than a nutcase who venomous
ly hates me or becomes obsessed with
me and then tries to take over my life.
The truly scary thing is that I might not
notice her freakish tendencies right
away, leaving me unprepared when they
eventually leak out and attack.
For example, at an Oxford conve
nience store last week, I saw one of my
seemingly normal housemates system
atically break candy bars in half by the
boxful under the counter while the
cashier obliviously rang up her purchas
es. That's just fucked up. Who does
that? lam truly afraid of her... I think
her coat is made out of puppies.
It's amazing how much of an impact
your roommate can have on your col
lege experience. The possible outcomes
vary drastically between making a new
best friend for life and waking up in the
morning missing patches of hair. I'll try
to adopt my sister's optimism for as long
as I can next quarter, but if I start wear
ing hats everyday, my living situation
must be pretty dire.

Jennie Kim is a junior who will be living
in Mirlo next quarter when she comes
back from Stanford in Oxford. E-mail
her at jenniek@stanford.edu; any advice
would be greatly appreciated.
