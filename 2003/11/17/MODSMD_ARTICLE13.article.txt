# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## The
						lighter side of the punk scene 
### 
Last Friday, I went to a punk con
cert in San Francisco. I was with
my buddy Andrew Nielsen,
who, if you are unfamiliar, is a
regular music guru down at KZSU. As
for me, I've been listening to punk and
ska for a few years, and I'd say I'm a self
declared "fan."
We were at the concert and things
were in full swing. It was about halfway
through the first group's set when we
both realized we couldn't understand a
word that the singer was saying. Now, if
I were going for a complete lack of lyri
cal content, I would have gone to the
Jason Mraz concert on Monday.
Haha! I kid. I know Jason Mraz fully
intends to make up words and silly
phrases, just like our president (token
Bush joke, it had to be done). But all
kidding aside, in my opinion, the open
ing band stunk.
But the story does not end there. No,
no, you readers get to hear a whole slew
of silly anecdotes about my Friday night.
The reason why I was at the show in
the first place was because of one of my
favorite bands, a punk-ska outfit from
Gainsville "Rock City" Florida: Less
Than Jake. I've been listening to these
guys for years, and it's hard to describe
how awesome they are. They are as sat
isfying as seeing Barbara Walters inter
view a wolverine, as silly as Tom
Brokaw in a nun's outfit as ... ah, you
get the idea. They rock.
So the lights went out, and we were
getting tense waiting for the band to
come out. A stage crew member came
on and off the stage, cigarettes in hand,
adjusting the mic stand for the billionth
time that night. He adjusted it, tapped it
twice and then disappeared into the
darkness like Batman if he were a

stagehand. Then another stagehand
came on and performed the exact same
routine. But we were not impressed;

we'd seen the trick
already.
While I was
waiting, I got to
meet ... the fans.
Just like Dave
Matthews has those
stiff-collared hip
pies and New
Found Glory has
fifth-grade girls,
Less Than Jake has
its own unique set

of fans. Ska and punk tend to draw some
really interesting, intelligent and passion
ate people. A lot of them have mo-hawks.
Then I met the drunken frat boy try
ing to fight a guy in a wife beater who
looked uncannily like former Minneso
ta governor Jesse Ventura. The former
governor look-alike and this is true
chose to take off his wife-beater be
fore he was about to fight the college
kid. It was his good wife-beater; he
didn't want to get bloodstains on it. This
event alone was enough to upstage the
opening act.
(For your information: Ventura was
winning in the first round, but declined
from going on to a second term er, I
mean round.)
When you talk about punk, the word
"unity" inevitably gets tossed around. A
lot of punk bands take stands against
racism and are for the unity of all peo
ples. I found that such concertgoers are
all united in their passion for music, will
ingness to see change in the world and
their refusal to wear deodorant.
But their foul aroma is not to be con
fused with the scent of a Dave Matthews

or Phish concert. How so? Well punk
shows might be full of cigarette smoke
and 80, but the other shows have a
slightly more illegal odor. Catch my
drift? Smell what I'm cooking here?
Good, 'cause I'm out of weed puns.
You know, I could never understand
drug use among concertgoers. If you re
ally love the music, why not hear it in
your natural state? Why do people feel
they have to take something to enhance
the experience? Not that I blame these
people. With the type of concerts I go to,
you can always see the band and you're
not in a state of mind that you see purple
baboons dancing the hokey pokey. At a
Dave Matthews' concert, such things
are not guaranteed: "Beyond that wall
of smoke, is that Dave or just birdpoop
on the guy-in-front's back?" or "Man,
those purple baboons can really rock!"
My concerts may be smelly and full
of mo-hawked goons who mosh, but
hey, at least we remember the show.
I see I'm almost out of space. I hope
you enjoyed reading about my Friday
night. I feel it's my duty to inform you
that I'm a real person with real life ex
periences with mo-hawked smelly peo
ple. These people, although I poke fun
at them, I consider my comrades in my
passion for punk music. I make fun of it,
Dave Matthews and whatever else there
is in this world to make fun of. Although
I may disagree with even mock
some fan's taste in music, I will always
take his or her opinion into account. Ex
cept for Creed fans. Yuck.

Sophomore Chris Holt is a former punk
radio host who is pretty sure he offended
Jason Mraz, Creed and purple baboons.
He apologizes to the purple baboons. E
