Readers criticize Oremus' article
I was wondering if there is any reason
why Will Oremus is a senior staff writer
for your paper. If Oremus is the measur
ing stick for your school paper, it must be
a fairly short stick to which you measure.
His article ("Card seeks to extend win
ning streak," Nov. 14) couldn't be further
from the truth. I hope that you hold your
writers accountable for such a horren
dous, awful piece of writing. Could he be
any further removed from reality? What
sort of malarkey will Oremus be present
ing next? I advise you to read the articles
printed in your paper before they go to
print. It seems the writers for your paper
are as inept as your football team. I chal
lenge you and your crack staff of writers
to mix in some realism with your fantasy.

The article written by your senior
writer Will Oremus ("Card seeks to ex
tend winning streak," Nov. 14) has our
boards laughing at Boise State Universi
ty. The comment regarding "Oregon
State's stars racked up many of their
yards in non-conference play, against
talent-deficient opponents Idee Boise
State" is absolutely ridiculous and mis

leading. Boise State finished the season
last year 12th in the coaches' poll and is
currently ranked 23rd in coaches' and
24th in the Associated Press. When your
fans read this article, they too are going
to be wondering, "What the heck are
you talking about?" Especially when
they are going to be climbing the ranks
again after beating a 41-point spread
against University of Texas at El Paso
tomorrow... 41! Please let me know,
how did you come up with our talent de
ficiency? We have players who are on
pace of setting all-time NCAA Division
I records. Our last game, Gilligan caught
eight passes for 209 yards against
Brigham Young University. I can go on.
You might want to do some extensive
research on our season to make up for
that poor article.

I sent this to the so-called "senior
staff writer" who recently wrote an ar
ticle ("Card seeks to extend winning
streak," Nov. 14) calling my school
and hometown football team "talent
deficient."
For being a senior staff writer for a
well-known and respected college, you
may want to do a little research before
you slander another school. Just for your

information, Boise State University is
ranked in the top 25 in both of the na
tion's ranking polls, and only lost to your
fellow Pac-10 school Oregon State by
two points after missing three field goals.
If Boise State is so "talent-deficient,"
why don't you pull some weight and put
us on your schedule and we will show
just how bad we are.

The Daily 'rocks'
Regarding The Daily's recent edito
rial about the Band's behavior ("Band
needs to improve behavior," Nov. 10)
and the need for improvement thereof,
I'm afraid I must disagree with John
Martin's negative comments about the
piece ("Editorial shouldn't have criti
cized the Stanford Band," Nov. 13).
I say it's The Daily that rocks. Why, I
haven't heard such insightful, balanced
commentary on the issues of our time
since the last time my mother talked to
me about riding my bicycle with no
hands.
Rock on, Daily.
