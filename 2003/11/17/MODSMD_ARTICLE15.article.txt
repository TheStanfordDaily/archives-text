## 43-3 or not, Babin loves the left coast 
### 
Alright, alright apologies
ahead of time. (No, not for
sending the column in late,
again. I already apologized
to the editors for that). Instead, apolo
gies in advance for (again) writing
about something that has been covered
in this column before.
Not sloshball after last week's
column about beer pong, I've been told
I should refrain from the "drinking-re
lated" columns. And not women, as I
feel Spencer has me beat on that "beat"
in his columns of late. Not the trials and
tribulations of my hometown teams, or
the unbearable yet addictive pain of
being a Red Sox fan.
No, this week it's all about Califor
nia and the mind-boggling question
of why the hell anyone wants to go to
school anyplace else.
Now this isn't going to be an ode

to "The 0.C."
which, somehow,
two of my house
mates are already
addicted to or an
effort to explain the
"East-coast bias" in
college football
polls, the NCAA
Tournament bracket
and MVP awards.
This isn't going to be

like Brian Murphy waxing poetic
about the West coast's produce,
women and weather.
OK, so there may be some mention
of the women and the weather.
But after spending a weekend in
the middle of November playing ulti
mate outdoors in Santa Cruz, over
looking the ocean and celebrating
the end of the tournament by relax
ing with a cold beverage at Light
house State Park while the sun went
down over the surfers, seals and sea
lions . . . well, I mean, that's it right
there.
You couldn't get me to trade places
with some nerd cooped up in an East
coast dormitory fighting off the cold
with a bottle of Jack and flannel-lined
jeans for, as Mr. Morrison once wrote,
"all the tea in China".
Days like yesterday, the glimpses
of a relapse of an Indian summer, the
days when you know your friends in
other parts of the country are scrap
ing their windshields in the morning
and generally hating life well I'm
not going to say that they completely
take away the pain of a 43-3 loss, but
they dull it a little.
Are you kidding me? Was this the
same team that looked so good the last
two weeks?
Granted, there are many explana
tions. First, away games are harder,
and Oregon State is a tough place to
play. The weather was crappy, which
the Beavers are used to and the Car
dinal isn't. And Oregon State is a
damn good team, what with the con
ference leaders in passing, rushing
and receiving.
But 43-3? For those of you scoring
at home, this means that the state of
Oregon outscored us 78-3 in the sea
son series this year, a fact that has not
gone unnoticed by my two Oregonian
housemates.
And yes, those are the two addict
ed to "The 0.C.," for those of you
who really are paying attention to this
column.
But I'm inclined to blame the loss on
a bizarre shift in the cosmos. How else
to explain a weekend that included the
previously undefeated Chiefs falling to
the Cincinnati Bengals? Or how USC
could possibly fall in the BCS standings
after laying a 45-0 smackdown on Ari
zona? Strange days, my friend, strange
days indeed.
Yet even with this alignment of the
stars, with everything falling out of
whack (did the Bengals really beat the
Chiefs?) there remain constants
rocks of stability on which we can base
our faith in all that is good, righteous
and just.
The Pacific Ocean is a truly beautiful
thing.
Corollary: There are also many
beautiful women in Santa Cruz.
Northern California weather
until the rainy season, anyway â€”is
also a beautiful thing. And even when
it rains, I'd rather be here than in
some East coast ice storm.
And finally, the most important
hard and fast truth, a statement I'm
willing to make even after we lost the
season series to Oregon by more than
10 touchdowns we will win Big
Game this year.
Don't make me look stupid, Buddy.
