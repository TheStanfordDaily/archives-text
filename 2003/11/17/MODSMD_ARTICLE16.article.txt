# OSU downs Card in 43-3 blowout
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
CORVALLIS, Ore. Stanford came into Saturday's
matchup with Oregon State riding a two-game winning streak;
it left a rainy Reser Stadium on the wrong end of a 43-3 mar
gin after putting up the second-worst offensive showing in
Stanford history.
The Beavers (7-3,4-2 Pacific 10 Conference) hit the Cardi
nal (4-5, 2-5 Pac-10) early and often. Junior quarterback
Derek Anderson threw for 383 yards and four touchdowns,
while junior tailback Steven Jackson rushed for 148 yards and
a score of his own, as the Beavers posted their largest margin
of victory in their 70-game series against Stanford and their
third-highest offensive output (663 yards) in school history.
Former walk-on receiver Mike Hass torched the Cardinal
secondary all day long, catching eight passes for 225 yards
the second-highest total in Oregon State history and two
touchdowns. Senior wideout James Newson caught nine pass
es for 115 yards and a touchdown the 20th of his career,
breaking a 40-year-old Beavers record.
While the Beavers were breaking records all over the field,
Stanford failed to break the plane of the end zone.
Thanks in part to Oregon State's four sacks and two bad
snaps, Stanford posted minus-12 rushing yards on the day. The
Cardinal did manage to gain 133 yards of total offense, ex
ceeding 1979's record low of 116 yards against Tulane.
"We struggled on the ground, we struggled through the
air," Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens said. "We ran out of
options."
Fifth-year senior Chris Lewis completed 9-of-23 passes for
92 yards; his replacement, Trent Edwards, completed 7-of-21
passes for 53 yards. Freshman Mark Bradford led the Cardinal
with five receptions for 65 yards, including a 33-yard reception
in the fourth quarter that prevented the Cardinal from setting
the new all-time low in offense. Freshman David Marrero led
the team with 22 yards rushing.
Now, Stanford needs to win its final two games home
games against California and Notre Dame to attain bowl
eligibility, something that the Beavers locked up with this win.
"We're going to bounce back," Lewis said. "We knew com
ing into this situation we had to get two out of three, it's just
[that] now our backs are against the wall."
Oregon State which trailed the Cardinal 21-6 at halftime
of last year's game before rallying for a 33-21 victory got off
to a much better start this year, as Anderson found senior tight
end Tim Euhus for a 9-yard score on the Beavers' second pos
session and hit Hass for a 52-yard touchdown on their fourth
possession.
Those scores sandwiched a 36-yard field goal by Stanford's
Michael Sgroi, which was set up by a 32-yard punt return by se
nior Luke Powell to the Oregon State 27-yard line. It was the
closest Stanford would get to the Beavers' end zone until Mar
rero fumbled just inches away from a touchdown in the fourth
quarter. Stanford failed to get a first down on 16 of its 19 pos
sessions, including 11 straight possessions spanning the last
three quarters.
"I can't tell you [why], it's just one day we're on, the next
day we're off," Powell said. "We knew they had a good team
but we felt like it could've been more competitive."
Stanford's punter, Eric Johnson, had the Cardinal's only
big day, totaling 512 yards, as the team was forced to punt 12
times and turned the ball over on downs another three times.
The teams would trade second-quarter interceptions be
fore Hass hauled in a 55-yard touchdown with 9:26 left in the
half. Jackson would add a 3-yard touchdown run minutes later,
as Oregon State marched 71 yards in five plays spanning less
than two minutes.
The big plays undermined a Stanford defensive effort that,
on most downs, played very solid football. As they often did
last year, miscommunications and mental errors cost the Car-
