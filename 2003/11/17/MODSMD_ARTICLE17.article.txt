# Bowl game still in sight
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
CORVALLIS, Ore. For Oregon
State, Saturday's 43-3 win over Stan
ford was an important one, practically
guaranteeing the Beavers a berth to a
bowl game and providing them strong
momentum heading into season-ending
games at Oregon and No. 2 Southern
California.
The good news for Stanford is that
wins in each of the next two weeks
would make the Cardinal bowl eligible
despite the 78-3 point spread it allowed
in the state of Oregon this year (the
Ducks shut out the Cardinal, 35-0, on
Oct. 25).
The Cardinal's next two games
the Big Game against arch-rival Cali
fornia and a Thanksgiving weekend tilt
against former head coach Tyrone Will
ingham's Notre Dame squad would
be the biggest games of Stanford's sea
son regardless of its record. The fact
that they will determine the Cardinal's
postseason fate makes them that much
more charged with emotion. And Stan
ford will be sure to take it one game at a
time, regardless of its bowl aspirations.
"Maybe we talked about it too much
last week, and we didn't focus on Ore
gon State," senior receiver Luke Powell

said. "I don't want to talk about bowl
games anymore. I want to talk about
Cal."
The Cardinal seniors want to pay Cal
back for last year's thrashing at Memo
rial Stadium.
"It's really important," Powell said.
"That's my last opportunity to leave a
mark, leave something to remember us
by. It's my last Big Game, it's just
huge."
Cal enters this weekend's game sit
ting at 6-6. Should the Cardinal win, it
will not only keep alive its bowl hopes
for at least one more week, but it will
saddle the Golden Bears with a losing
record, rendering them ineligible for
postseason play. Should Cal win, it will
head to one of the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's affiliated bowl games by virtue of
what would be a 5-3 record in confer
ence, and it will eliminate Stanford
from postseason play.
Talk about important.
Oregon State has a rivalry game of
its own coming up. Well, more than just
a game it has its annual matchup
against Oregon this Saturday, a rivalry
game so intense that it is called the Civil
War. Following that road game, the
Beavers take a week off and then play
No. 2 Southern California on Dec. 6 in
Los Angeles, with undoubted aspira

tions of throwing the Bowl Champi
onship Series standings out of whack
with a late upset.
"It's a big, big deal for both teams,"
Oregon State head coach Mike Riley
said of the Civil War. "There's a lot of
stuff coming down at the end of the
year, besides the fact it's Oregon and
Oregon State."
Its strong showing against Stanford
suggests that Oregon State is in top con
dition for what he termed as the "Super
Bowl of Oregon."
"It's open season on the Ducks," de
clared Oregon State linebacker
Richard Siegler, despite the Beavers'
decade-long drought in Eugene, Ore.
"This win was a statement game. Ore
gon will know."
Added running back Steven Jack
son: "We're going to go down to their
house, and I think we're going to
rock it."
Stanford's making no such claims
about Big Game, which is understand
able. It's hard to muster much bravado
after a 40-point loss, after all. But dur
ing head coach Buddy Teevens' tenure,
Stanford has shown that one week's re
sults don't necessarily have much to do
with the results of the next.
Stanford returned home after
its demoralizing loss to Oregon on
a four-game skid, with questions in
the air about all facets of its game.
It then went out the next week and

beat the Pacific 10 Conference's
leading team at the time, UCLA,
and then ran up 38 points in a vic
tory over Arizona State the follow
ing week.
"We were surprised [by Oregon
State], but we've gone through a
lot of adversity already," Stanford
quarterback Chris Lewis said.
"Our focus goes right back to Cal
right now. We know what we need
to do."
