# No. 19 men sink Team Nike at home

### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 19 Stanford men's basketball
team opened its season on a 17-4 run and
never looked back. The Cardinal beat up
on a seemingly fatigued and frustrated
Nike team, 117-78, in an exhibition game at
Maples Pavilion last night.
The run, which opened with a three
pointer from junior swingman Josh Chil
dress, included six points from junior cen
ter Rob Little and a pair of alley-oop slam
dunks from both Childress and Little to
bring the crowd to its feet. Childress fin
ished with 11 points, three rebounds and
two assists in 20 minutes of play and Little
added 14 points, three boards and a block
in 25 minutes.
From the opening moments of this
fast-paced, high-scoring matchup, Stan
ford looked strong both offensively and
defensively. In the first half, the Cardinal
only turned the ball over twice, while
shooting almost 63 percent from the field
and 83 percent from the free-throw line.
Team Nike, on the other hand, turned the
ball over 10 times in the first half under
half court man-to-man pressure from the
Cardinal.
For all intents and purposes, Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery saw exactly
what he wanted to see from his team in its
first game of the season intensity on
both ends, strong offensive execution, no
ticeable player maturation and, most im
portantly, no injuries.
"The guys were hungry for a game,"
Montgomery said. "We're not always
going to shoot the ball that well [but] it
sure looks good when we do.
"[Team Nike's] actually a pretty good
basketball team," he continued. "They're
physical, they're talented and they execut

ed pretty well. We played well, there's no
question. [At point guard] I think we're
fine if Chris [Hernandez] stays healthy, but
he hasn't up to this point. [And Little's]
doing things we've never seen him do be
fore. He's got a chance to have a real good
year."
Senior shooting guard Matt Lottich led
all Stanford scorers with 16 points and six
assists. He shot 70 percent from the field
and went 2-for-3 from behind the arc. In
addition, seven Stanford players Chil
dress, Little, Lottich, senior center Joe Kir
chofer and sophomores Hernandez, Dan
Grunfeld and Matt Haryasz all scored
double-digits in a balanced Cardinal scor
ing attack that seemed relentless at times.
Senior forward Justin Davis and freshman
forward Fred Washington both added nine
points apiece. As a team, Stanford shot al
most 66 percent from the field, 60 percent
from behind the arc and 81 percent from
the line.
"I was surprised at our field goal per
centage," Davis said. "It seemed like in the
first half we couldn't miss a shot."
The second half saw much of the same.
The Stanford starting five Hernandez,
Childress, Lottich, Davis and Little
opened the half on a 12-2 run, which began
when Hernandez found Lottich in the cor
ner for a three.
"It was a great shooting night," Hernan
dez said. "Everything was clicking."
Stanford seemed so in synch at times that it
made the unusual look effortless.
One such play late in the second half
featured a steal from Washington who
passed the ball up-court to a breaking
Davis. Davis then found Grunfeld on a be
hind-the-back bounce pass that led to a
Grunfeld two-handed slam.
Yeah, you heard it right... a behind
the back pass from Davis led to a two

handed slam from Grunfeld bringing the
score to 108-70 in favor of the Cardinal.
"[The game] was an encouraging first
step," Montgomery said.
For Team Nike, the exhibition season

doesn't get any easier. The club travels
south to face No. 4 Arizona later this week.
Stanford, on the other hand, will open its
regular season against unranked Sacra
mento State on Saturday night at Maples.
