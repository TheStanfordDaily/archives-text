# Men end season with 1-0 loss
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
It ended this way against Old Dominion. It ended this
way twice in one weekend, in home contests against Ore
gon State and Washington. It ended this way against Fres
no State.
Stanford men's soccer (3-15-2,0-10-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) has known the sting of the 1-0 loss all season.
The Cardinal's final game of the season against Cali
fornia (10-8-2,5-4-1 Pac-10) wasn't supposed to end like
the other four matches. It was the wrong way to finish the
season. It was the wrong way to send off senior co-cap
tains Mike Wilson and Abe Geiger.
The contest was supposed to be a statement game for
Stanford. A last stand. One final surge to get a result that
reflected its talent, and not its record.
But after 90 minutes on Maloney Field, the game left
the Cardinal with only that familiar sting. One last 1-0
heartbreak.
"I just knew that we were going to win. I even dreamed
last night that we won, 1-0," Geiger said. "But we didn't
[win]. And it wasn't for lack of effort. These guys gave
their all."
The Cardinal faced an energized rival team and a slip
pery playing field, but could have avoided the loss if it
hadn't been for an early Stanford meltdown.
Stanford came out fighting, and put the first shot up on
the board, but made frequent passing errors that allowed
Cal to regain and control possession for a short span of the
first half.
That short breakdown was all that the Bears needed.
In the 13th minute of the game, Cal sophomore Pieter
Berger fed a ball in to junior teammate Carl Acosta, who
launched a perfect shot into the net. Junior goalkeeper
Robby Fulton never had a chance at a save, as the goal
was aimed at the top right corner of the net.
"We gave away a lot of passes and they kept bringing
them back, and eventually one of those led to a goal,"
Stanford head coach Bret Simon said. "That was where
[Cal] was dangerous."
After the goal, the Cardinal seemed to pull itself back
together and maintain better possessions, but the damage
had been done. The teams played an evenly matched con
test, but Stanford's inability to find the back of the net for
the remainder of the evening nullified its containment of
the Bears' offense. The Cardinal squad managed only
four shots on the night two from junior forward Matt
Janusz and two from freshman midfielder Marcus Ryan
and only one of those shots fell on goal.
"They played very hard," Simon said of his players,
"But I hope they aren't going home happy. If they are,
they underestimate their own playing ability."
The win over Stanford was crucial for the Golden
Bears, whose tournament berth hinged on a strong sea
son finish. The Cal squad will likely spend this afternoon
glued to ESPN, awaiting the announcement of the 48
teams that will see postseason action.
That list of 48 will exclude Stanford, which ended its
long disappointing season on Saturday.
The Cardinal began the year ranked sixth in the

NCAA, largely because of its talented juniors and its
freshman class, which ranked among the best recruiting
classes in the nation.
Despite winning the season-opener, Stanford quickly
fell from the top of the polls as the result of three straight
losses, and failed to collect its second win until it burned
UC-Irvine 4-1 in late September.
Early in the season, Janusz said that potential was a
term commonly associated with the Cardinal.
"But potential is a dangerous thing. Especially when
you're not winning," he said.
Stanford's potential was questioned by many in the
winless weeks that followed the home victory over the
Anteaters. But ultimately, most agreed that the Cardi
nal's talent was better than its record.
The 10-game winless streak that spanned the entire
month of October was highlighted by impressive play
from many Stanford players, but the squad's ability was
often overshadowed by bad luck, injury, and the chal
lenges of blending new players into the starting lineup.
Last week, Stanford halted its losing skid with a 5-1 tri
umph over San Jose State.
Saturday's final rivalry game against Cal was the last
for captains Geiger and Wilson, who were honored with
plaques before kickoff that expressed Stanford's gratitude
for their leadership on and off the field. Wilson will con
tinue to play with the New Zealand national team, and
Geiger will undergo his fourth knee surgery on Thursday
before continuing his post-Stanford soccer career.
The rest of the Cardinal squad will be back on the field
training this week.
"The younger players know that we'll be doing more
in the offseason," Simon said. "We have to be sharper, fit
ter and more prepared and if we can do that, we'll win a
lot of games next year."
