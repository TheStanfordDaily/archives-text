# Stress and acne related, Stanford study confirms
## 
### ANN CHIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For decades, college students have at
tributed acne breakouts to stress. Now,
new research by Stanford's School of
Medicine shows there may be a strong
correlation between exam-related stress
and acne severity in college students.
The study from the Department of
Dermatology included 22 college stu
dents, including several from Stanford
and nearby schools such as Foothill Col
lege.
Researchers tracked the students'
stress and acne levels for one academic

term, and then adjusted the results for
changes in eating and sleeping habits.
They found that students experienced
a progressive increase in the severity of
their acne during examination periods.
Though Stanford has more exam
weeks than many other universities due to
the quarter system, the stress levels of the
students in the study did not seem to be
based on the frequency of their exams.
"The level of stress seemed to be relat
ed to the severity of the stress," said Dr.
Alexa Kimball, director of clinical trials in
the Department of Dermatology.
Kimball said that the study was too
small to determine whether there is a cor
relation between more competitive
schools and increased stress.
According to the American Counsel
ing Association, anxiety over acne can se
verely impact a teenager's self-image,
bringing about negative consequences on
relationships, attitudes, social life, acade
mic performance and employment oppor
tunities.
The organization is advising students
not to allow self-consciousness over acne
to influence their self-esteem or school
work.
"Acne is usually only temporary but
getting bad grades in college can stay with
you a lifetime," it stated in a recent public
awareness campaign.
According to the American Academy
of Dermatology, acne is the most com
monly diagnosed skin disorder in the
country. It is most prevalent among
teenagers, affecting approximately 85
percent of people between the ages of 12
and 25. More than 40 percent of adoles
cents who are halfway through their
teenage years have experienced acne seri
ous enough to require medical treatment
by a doctor.
Many Stanford students were not sur
prised by the findings of the new study.
