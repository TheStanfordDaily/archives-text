# Marshall honored by NSCAA
## 
### 
Sophomore Chad Marshall was nominated this
week as a semi-finalist for the prestigious M. A.C. Her
mann Trophy, an honor given annually to the top Di
vision I men's soccer player. The defender is the first
Cardinal up for the award since defender Lee Morri
son was nominated in the 2000 season.
Marshall, who as a sophomore is the youngest of the
15 semifinalists, discovered that he had been nominat
ed when a friend saw the press release on the Internet.
"I had no idea," he said. "It's a great honor and I
feel very privileged, especially since I'm only a sopho
more."
Though Marshall insists that he has absolutely no
chance at actually winning the trophy, the 6-foot-4 de
fender has done plenty on the field to attract national
attention.
Prior to his arrival at Stanford, Marshall was
named the No. 1 men's soccer recruit in the nation by

Soccer America, and carried a lengthy list of MVP
honors. He has been a member of the under-17 and
under-20 U.S. National Teams as well as the under-17
World Cup team.
In his rookie campaign, the Soccer America Fresh
man of the Year put in two overtime game-winners
during the NCAA tournament to push the Cardinal
into the championship match, and Marshall was
named to the All-Tournament team as a result.
This year Marshall has racked up three points on a
goal and an assist and has been an integral part of the
Stanford defense, starting in 19 games on the season.
Three finalists for the Hermann Trophy will be an
nounced at the College Cup next year, and the winner
will be revealed Jan. 9. The decision will be voted upon
by the members of the National Soccer Coaches As
sociation of America.
