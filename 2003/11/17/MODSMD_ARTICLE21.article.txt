# Women fall to Broncos in first round
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Friday night marked a frustrating end to a frustrating
season for the Stanford women's soccer team (10-9-2),
which bowed out of the NCAA College Cup in the first
round with a 1-0 loss to Bay Area rival No. 3 Santa Clara
(13-3-5).
The Cardinal has been plagued by injury all season
and Friday was no different the team was forced to
take the field without its two top forwards, seniors Mar
cie Ward and Brittany Oliveira.
Ward, a 2002 first-team All-Pacific 10 Conference se
lection and member the Under-21 National Team,
took a medical redshirt this season with a foot injury.
While Stanford had all season to adjust to the loss of
Ward, Oliveira was a staple in this season's offense. The
forward went down in heart-breaking fashion last week,
tearing her ACL in the final regular season game of the
year.
The absence of the two strikers was glaringly appar

Stanford held possession for much of the first 20 min
utes, but was unable to get off a shot attempt until
sophomore forward Leah Tapscott fired a bullet direct
ly at Bronco goalkeeper Julie Ryder in the 25th minute.
While the offense stumbled throughout the game, the
Cardinal defense was a wall in front of junior keeper
Nicole Barnhart in the first half.
Santa Clara's lethal offense was able to tally eight
shots in the first period, but had only one real opportu
nity, which Barnhart promptly put an end to.
"I felt it was a pretty even game. In the first half we
had chances and Santa Clara had chances," senior mid
fielder Ally Marquand said. "The momentum switched
in the second period, but I still think the game was fairly
even."
It was mostly due to the play of senior All-American
forward Veronica Zepeda that the Broncos were able to
take control of the game. Zepeda has been forced to play
limited minutes all season long due to painful shin
splints.
At the start of the second half, Santa Clara head
coach Jerry Smith decided to gamble and leave Zepeda
in the game.
"I felt like the only way [Stanford] could beat us was
if the game somehow got to penalty kicks," Smith said.
"So I kept Veronica in with the hopes that we could take
