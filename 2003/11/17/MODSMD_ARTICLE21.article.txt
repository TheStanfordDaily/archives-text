# Women fall to Broncos in first round
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Friday night marked a frustrating end to a frustrating
season for the Stanford women's soccer team (10-9-2),
which bowed out of the NCAA College Cup in the first
round with a 1-0 loss to Bay Area rival No. 3 Santa Clara
(13-3-5).
The Cardinal has been plagued by injury all season
and Friday was no different the team was forced to
take the field without its two top forwards, seniors Mar
cie Ward and Brittany Oliveira.
Ward, a 2002 first-team All-Pacific 10 Conference se
lection and member the Under-21 National Team,
took a medical redshirt this season with a foot injury.
While Stanford had all season to adjust to the loss of
Ward, Oliveira was a staple in this season's offense. The
forward went down in heart-breaking fashion last week,
tearing her ACL in the final regular season game of the
year.
The absence of the two strikers was glaringly appar
ent in Friday's matchup.
Stanford held possession for much of the first 20 min
utes, but was unable to get off a shot attempt until
sophomore forward Leah Tapscott fired a bullet direct
ly at Bronco goalkeeper Julie Ryder in the 25th minute.
While the offense stumbled throughout the game, the
Cardinal defense was a wall in front of junior keeper
Nicole Barnhart in the first half.
Santa Clara's lethal offense was able to tally eight
shots in the first period, but had only one real opportu
nity, which Barnhart promptly put an end to.
"I felt it was a pretty even game. In the first half we
had chances and Santa Clara had chances," senior mid
fielder Ally Marquand said. "The momentum switched
in the second period, but I still think the game was fairly
even."
It was mostly due to the play of senior All-American
forward Veronica Zepeda that the Broncos were able to
take control of the game. Zepeda has been forced to play
limited minutes all season long due to painful shin
splints.
At the start of the second half, Santa Clara head
coach Jerry Smith decided to gamble and leave Zepeda
in the game.
"I felt like the only way [Stanford] could beat us was
if the game somehow got to penalty kicks," Smith said.
"So I kept Veronica in with the hopes that we could take
was if the game somehow got to
penalty kicks," Smith said. "So I
kept Veronica in with the hopes
that we could take the lead."
Smith's gamble paid off big
time.
In the 59th minute, Zepeda
dribbled past several Stanford de
fenders toward the goal. The Car
dinal defense was forced to con
verge on Zepeda, leaving fresh
man forward Marian Dalmy wide
open in front of the goal.
Zepeda struck a perfect cross
that Dalmy coolly trapped and
then put into the back of the net.
While in the end it was Dalmy
who scored the goal, virtually all
the praise and accolades went to
Zepeda.
"When you play with Veronica,
you've got to expect those [types of'
crosses], with her dribble," Dalmy
said. "Veronica did all the work. It
was perfect on the ground. I just
trapped it and found my corner."
Neither head coach could say
enough about Zepeda, making
their high regard for the forward

quite clear.
"Zepeda is just a special player
individually," Stanford head coach
Paul Ratcliffe said. "When she
gets the ball at her feet, she has the
ability to beat anybody.
"She's very savvy with her de
cision making after she beats that
initial defender," Ratcliffe con
tinued. "Then the team adjusts
and she finds the open player.
She did in the box against us to
find the decisive goal."
"Veronica is one of our best
dribblers and passers and also
our most composed," Smith said.
"[She] has a real knack for being
composed. She made a difficult
play look very easy."
The goal was Dalmy's first since
the Cardinal last faced the Bron
cos. She missed the entire West
Coast Conference season with a
high-ankle sprain. In fact, she had
just returned to practice on Tues
day.
Dalmy's patience and calm
under pressure ultimately ended a
trying season for the Cardinal.
While the Stanford defense was
stellar all year, the season proved
that tight games cannot be won
without some sort of offensive
firepower.

The Cardinal stepped up and
played its best against top teams,
most notably coming away with
scoreless ties against then-No. 3
UCLA and then-No. 2 Notre
Dame, but never could get that
win that would get their season
going.
Individually, five Stanford play
ers received All-Pac 10 Honors.
Barnhart and Marquand received
first team honors. Barnhart
recorded seven shutouts, 63 saved
and posted a 0.78 goals allowed av
erage.
Marquand was the lone Cardi
nal who consistently contributed
to the offense. She led the way
with 10 goals and added 2 assists.
Senior defender Natalie Spilger
was named to the second team,
while senior defender Alisan
Pabon and sophomore defender
Hayley Hunt received honorable
mention recognition.
The Cardinal is losing five play
ers to graduation: Marquand,
Spilger, Oliveira, Pabon and de
fender Anna Hare.
However, seven starters will re
turn, including the All-American
Barnhart, and the squad will also
welcome back Ward, who will pro
vide some much needed offense.
