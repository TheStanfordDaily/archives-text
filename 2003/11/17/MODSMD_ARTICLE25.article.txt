# Greens protest Office Depot paper policies
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Ten Stanford students staged a protest out
side of East Palo Alto's Office Depot store on
Saturday afternoon, as part of a national grass
roots attempt to encourage the office supply
chain to be more environmentally friendly.
"Office Depot wants to preserve its image to
maximize profits, so if it believes the loss of
profits from the public awareness exceeds the
cost of implementing the changes, it will make
the environmental improvements," said junior
Timothy Telleen-Lawton, president of the
Stanford Greens, an environmental advocacy
group.
Many believe that Office Depot should stop
its practice of using paper harvested from en
dangered forests. Two non-profit organizations
Forest Ethics and Dogwood Alliance
spearheaded "The Paper Campaign" in 1999 to
encourage Staples and Office Depot to stop
using paper products from endangered forests.
The Stanford Greens made "The Paper Cam
paign" its top priority this quarter and planned
Saturday's protest as a culmination of this quar
ter's efforts.
"Our plan is to educate Stanford students,
other consumers, and any other relevant par
ties, and let Office Depot know that we are
doing so," Teleen-Lawton said.
To that end, the Stanford Greens has gotten
about 1,000 people to sign postcards in support
of the national campaign. Additionally, be
tween 10 and 20 Stanford students also called
Bruce Nelson, the CEO of Office Depot, on Fri
day as part of Solid Waste and Recycling
Awareness Day. These students identified
themselves as Stanford students who were con
cerned with Office Depot's environmental poli
cies.
At the protest, the Stanford Greens spoke to
75 customers, 43 of which signed postcards, at
the protest on Saturday. These postcards en

courage Office Depot CEO Bruce Nelson to
make changes in the company's environmental
practices.
Students at the protest also performed vari
ous skits in front of Office Depot, using an axe
lent from the Drama Department to illustrate
Office Depot's policy of cutting down trees in
endangered forests. The police soon asked the
students not to "wield the axe," however.
Tyler Elm, environmental director of Office
Depot, defended the company's practices.
"We're working with our suppliers and the
conservation science community to move these
issues forward," Elm told the San Jose Mercury
News. "By all means, Office Depot supports the
conservation and protection of endangered
forests. However, the term 'endangered forests'
is not scientific and is purposely misused. "
Elm claimed that non-profit organizations
such as Forest Ethics and Dogwood Alliance use
college students to help them fight their battles,
because college students are eager to better the
world but often lack a concrete understanding
of the issues.
"Students are a prime target because stu
dents want to further these issues but generally
don't have a grasp of the science behind these
issues," he said.
Office Depot claims that it is committed to
"developing the most comprehensive environ
mental program in the office products indus
try."
The Stanford Greens, however, are not con
vinced, and plan to continue to pursue this
issue.
"We will continue to raise awareness,"
Telleen-Lawton said. "We have not decided
how we will do this, or what priority it will be
among the other issues relevant to our campus
group. If it remains a top priority in future quar
ters, then we will probably have more events to
reach out to students, have professors in addi
tion to students sign on to support the campaign
and plan more off-campus publicity events.
