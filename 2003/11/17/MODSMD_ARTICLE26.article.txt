## Illinois delays vote on fate of Chief Illiniwek 
### ALI SAJJADI MATT STENSLAND DAILY ILLINI 
(U-WIRE) CHAMPAIGN, 111. Chief Illini
wek will remain the symbol of the University of
Illinois at least for a little while longer as a
result of Thursday morning's Board of Trustees
meeting.
Trustee Frances Carroll withdrew her resolu
tion to retire Chief Illiniwek at the beginning of
the meeting and said she didn't think she had
enough votes for the measure to pass and wanted
more time to sway fellow trustees to agree to it.
Carroll said when she joined the board in May
she felt the majority of trustees were in favor of re
tiring the Chief, but Wednesday night she became
uncertain if she would have the six votes needed
for a majority.
"It's just too important an issue to have it get
out there and voted down," Carroll said. "It would
serve no purpose to have it defeated. They'd still
have the Chief."
Her decision to withdraw the item set off
protests from Chief opponents and was seen as an
encouraging sign to Chief supporters. Both oppo
nents and supporters attended the morning ses
sion of the meeting in large numbers.
Prior to the meeting, members of Students for
Chief Illiniwek and other Chief supporters band
ed together to sing Illinois loyalty songs and at one
point chanted "Keep the Chief" for several min
utes.
After Carroll's withdrawal of the resolution,
anti-Chief protesters, many from the Progressive
Resource/Action Cooperative, shouted "BOT,
shame on you!" and approached the front of the
meeting room with a large sign reading "Racist
legacy continues."
The resolution, which proposed to retire Chief
Illiniwek as the university symbol but retain the
name Fighting Illini, was added suddenly to the

agenda Monday.
Carroll initially said she would refile the reso
lution for the board's July meeting but later said
she would like to see it on the agenda for the
March 11 meeting because more students would
be on campus then. Student Trustee Nate Allen
also expressed support for bringing back the reso
lution at the board's March meeting in Urbana, 111.
Visibly upset by the board's decision, Chancel
lor Nancy Cantor walked out of the room after
Carroll's announcement into an Illini Union hall
way, stared out a window, and started crying as
friends and colleagues consoled her.
"I really believe that we needed to move for
ward on this," she said. "I really believe that today
is really problematic for this institution. We do not
need to be embroiled in divisiveness."
Later Cantor said she would like to see a vote
on the Chief as soon as possible.
Board Chairman Lawrence Eppley said that
the withdrawal of the resolution reaffirmed the
board's previous decision to retain the Chief until
the issue is reconsidered. The board last voted on
the Chief issue in 1990 when it voted to keep the
Chief as the university symbol.
"There is a standing resolution in support of
the Chief, and until that's overturned, that is the
position of the board," Eppley said.
Eppley said he felt people on both sides of the
issue should do a better job of understanding the
other side's perspective. He said the passion
shown by both sides was an indication of just how
divisive the Chief issue is on campus, and the
board needed more time to consider the resolu
tion.
"It's not so much [that] the board is concerned
about taking heat on this," Eppley said. "It's just
trying to figure out what we're supposed to do."
But he said he was ready to vote against Carroll's
resolution had it come to a vote.
"I like the Chief," Eppley said. "I would have

voted no."
Although Trustee Kenneth Schmidt said he
also had made up his mind on the Chief he refused
to comment whether he would have supported re
tiring or retaining it. He said that before the meet
ing there was "not a clear enough majority in ei
ther direction to make a very firm statement" on
the Chief.
Allen said he did not know the resolution was
going to be withdrawn until shortly before the
meeting, and had he known he would have tried to
alert students. Despite earlier statements that he
would vote for retiring the Chief, Allen thanked
the Chief supporters for giving him their opinions
and said he's always willing to listen to their con
cerns.
Some supporters as well as opponents of the
Chief said they were disappointed by Carroll's de
cision to withdraw the resolution. But Dan Bolin,
president of Students for Chief Illiniwek, said he
saw the move as a sign that the board was pre
pared to vote in support of the Chief Thursday.
Roger Huddleston, founder of the Honor the
Chief Society, said he was encouraged by Eppley's
statement that until overturned, the board would
stick to its current stance on the Chief.
"[The Chief] is still the symbol of the universi
ty," Huddleston said. "He's not on death row."
However, Demian Kogan, president of Pro
gressive Resource/Action Cooperative, said his
organization will continue to attend board meet
ings and argue its opinion until a decision is made.
"We felt they had an opportunity to put this
issue to rest," Kogan said. "It is unfortunate that
they decided not to vote ... We decided that we
will not let that go."
Carroll said she hopes in March to have at least
eight votes to retire the Chief so the board can
take a more definitive stance against it.
"I'm going to be working on it," she said. "At
least the resolution is out there."
