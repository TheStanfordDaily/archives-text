# Many previously home-schooled students find adjustment to college easier than expected

University might be alien and intimidating to
most freshmen first setting foot on campus, and
one might guess that, for home-schooled students
who have never spent a day in a classroom, the ex
perience seems earth-shattering. But the change
in lifestyle for the home-schooled is not notice
ably turbulent, many former home-schoolers say.
Before coming here, Anna Megill spent her
entire education at home in western Pennsylva
nia. Megill's learning experience involved inde
pendent work and a curriculum tailored to her in
terests.
To supplement her solo study, Megill partici
pated with her local high school's athletic teams
and was named captain of the volleyball and div
ing teams her senior year. She also took a number
of AP courses online.
And taking the next step to college was not as
large a hurdle as one might expect.
"I don't think [the transition to college] was
less than typical," Megill said. "Everyone has an
adjustment, but I didn't find mine to be severe.
The courses are more difficult, but in a sense, the

format is the same with more longterm assign
ments that I had."
For others on campus, like Joanna Shawruss,
the transition from home schooling to a class
room setting occurred a little earlier than college.
Shawruss first stepped into the traditional
classroom as a high school freshman at Villa
Marie, a private school outside of Philadelphia.
She soon showed her impressive preparation
by taking the AP test in Latin a language she
had been studying since the age of seven at the
end of her freshman year.
Shawruss said home schooling enabled her to
focus on her studies without much of the wasted
time and other distractions of the classroom setting.
"Basically, one feature I found with home
schooling is that it ehminates a lot of the superflu
ous time that gets wasted, particularly at the
grade school level, as opposed to less time wasted
as when one reaches the higher educational lev
els," Shawruss said.
She said she also believes home-schooling pro
vides a greater degree of social options because it
allows students to pick social groups without the
constraints of a formal educational system.
"People who have never home-schooled
somehow think we're unsocial people who live

in a dark corners," Shawruss said. "In fact, I be
lieve that as a home-schooler, I was able to be
come more socialized than I would have other
wise because I wasn't forced to be confined with
one particular artificially constructed group for
all my activities and time."
Perhaps, Shawruss joked, the greatest
challenge for home-schooled students align
ing to a classroom setting is getting used to
sleep depravation.
Shawruss is, Dean of Admission Janet Rapelye
said, the norm for home schooled students.
"It is rare to see students that are home
schooled for their entire education," Rapelye
said.
And while home-schooled students are not
numerous at Princeton, they are represented in
each class.
She added that home-schooled applicants
are considered in the same manner as any other
applicant.
"Students are primarily judged on their ac
complishments, as is everyone who applies,"
Rapelye said. "We try not to make judgments
about anyone's high school either. We just try to
judge applicants based on how they've done in
their settings."
