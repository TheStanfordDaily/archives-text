# UCLA students lobby for Taco Bell termination

In an effort to remove a popu
lar eatery on campus, some stu
dent activists are pushing the As
sociated Students of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles
to support labor rights by termi
nating its contract with Taco
Bell.
The Social Justice Alliance
student coalition meets today
with the Food Services Commit
tee to discuss the renewal of
ASUCLA's contract with the
Taco Bell corporation. The com
mittee is scheduled to determine
what its recommendation to the
ASUCLA board of directors will
be.
Although the board ultimate
ly decides whether Taco Bell will
stay or go, the Food Services
Committee carries substantial
weight in the decision.
Some students have been boy
cotting Taco Bell because it pur
chases tomatoes from southern
Florida packing companies such
as Immokalee. According to a
resolution passed by the Under
graduate Students Association
Council, Immokalee pays tomato
pickers as little as 40 cents a
bucket, meaning workers must
fill 125 buckets to earn $5O a day.
Though tomatoes used at the
UCLA Taco Bell are not from
Florida, some students feel an
obligation to oppose the compa
ny.
"We play an important role by
boycotting Taco Bell because
Taco Bell has the power to affect
the livelihood of workers," said
sophomore labor activist Christi
na Kaoh.
But some students do not sup
port the removal of Taco Bell
from campus because they enjoy
its low prices, location conve
nience, and do not consider the
arguments against the restaurant
substantial.
"I think the issue should be
confronted, but I don't think
Taco Bell should be taken away
just because of some tomatoes,"
said Bojan Hrpka, a junior.
Emmanuel Martinez, the un
dergraduate representative on
the board, said it seems student
activists are more prepared than

prior years, yet he said he was un
able to state what ASUCLA
would decide.
ASUCLA has supported
labor rights before by selling Fair
Trade coffee throughout campus
and SweatX brand clothing in the
UCLA Store.
According to the U.S. Depart
ment of Labor, farm sales of fruit
and vegetables have doubled in
the last two decades. In contrast,
wages received by farm workers
have decreased.
Students who are currently
boycotting Taco Bell say wage
increases would hardly affect the
eatery but would significantly aid
workers.
Student groups such as Unit
ed Students Against Sweat Shops
have worked for three years to
remove UCLA's Taco Bell
restaurant. The student group
presented a case against Taco
Bell to ASUCLA this past spring
quarter. The discussion was
tabled until a later date.
Though removal of Taco Bell
has not yet been successful, stu
dents have worked harder this
year to raise awareness and gain
student support.
In a forum hosted by the Stu
dent Farm Worker Alliance in
October, an Immokalee tomato
picker described his experiences.
Seeking additional support,
labor activist groups have made
announcements during classes,
visited dorms and asked for en
dorsements from student groups.
As of Nov. 9, 400 petition signa
tures had been collected.
Other high schools and uni
versities throughout the country
have also taken action against
Taco Bell. Due to student
protests in 2002 at California
State University, Los Angeles
and at the University of San
Francisco, Taco Bell was re
moved from both campuses.
Students opposing the restau
rant hope the same outcome will
result at UCLA after today's pre
sentation.
"We have had trouble in the
past, but the key is persistence,"
said Nathan Lam, a member of a
student group against sweat
shops. "We weren't prepared
enough last time and we didn't
have enough student support.
This time we might."
