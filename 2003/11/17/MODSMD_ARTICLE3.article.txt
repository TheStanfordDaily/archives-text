# Registered parties down slightly
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Students have complained in floods about a dying
party scene this year, but there has actually been only a
small decline in registered parties from last year, and
there has in fact been an increase in Greek-sponsored
parties.
According to statistics from the Office of Student
Activities, registered parties at Stanford from the start
of the school year to Nov. 11 numbered 95 in 2002. In
2003, the number of registered parties has dropped to
87, reflecting an 8 percent decrease from last year.
"I do not believe that the differences are that signifi
cant regarding registered parties this year versus last,"
said Assistant Director of Student Activities Joey Green
well. "I believe it is too soon to be able to make any opin
ions regarding trends based on this information."
The number of residential parties through Nov. 11
has decreased to 43 from 53, a 19 percent reduction
from 2002, which may reflect the new alcohol policy
that prohibits alcohol from being served in all-fresh
man dorms. Meanwhile, the number of Greek parties
increased to 27 this year from 21 last fall.
Some students feel that the alcohol restriction in all
frosh dorms is responsible for the noticeable drop in the
quantity of residential parties.
"Considering the alcohol policy, I think we're doing
a pretty good job about keeping the parties going,"
sophomore Shari Ilsen said. "I think the flats have
played a big role in that by stepping up when all-fresh
man dorm parties can't draw in people like they've
done in the past."
However, many Stanford students said they felt that
a stronger alcohol policy has restricted the nightlife on
campus.
"I think there's definitely been less partying since
my freshman year, when it was a lot looser with less se
curity," senior Dave Hu said. "Partying has died down,
and so the University has been making an effort to pro
vide another outlet other than partying for campus life
past 10 p.m."
While upperclassmen have been comparing this
year's social scene to that of previous years, initial re
actions to the party scene from freshmen are based
more on expectations of college life.
"When I imagined college, I thought of every place
like the Row just having tons of parties where you could
go party-hopping from house to house," said freshman
Jessica Harris. "The parties are still good, but I guess
it's just not like that type of party school."
Freshman Peter Elliott agreed with Harris, although

he pointed out that Stanford does not purport to be a
"party school."
"There's a definite tradeoff," he said. "A low-key
party scene for what you get in academics."
While the party notification survey cannot reflect all
the complexities of student views of nightlife at Stan
ford, it indicates that fraternities and sororities, volun
tary student organizations and residences are still mak
ing an effort to register and plan parties.
"I was expecting nothing when I came in as a fresh
man besides people drinking behind closed doors," said
sophomore Tom Feulner. "When people talked about
past years where there weren't as many places on pro
bation, I realized it could be better, but I'm still really
impressed with the social scene at Stanford."
