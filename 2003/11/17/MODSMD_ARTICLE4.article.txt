### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Asian Americans should join each other and marginalized mi
norities to fight for social justice, speakers said on Saturday at the an
nual Asian American Pacific Islanders Issues Conference, which ad
dressed the issues facing an increasingly diverse Asian American
population in the United States.
The conference, sponsored by the Asian American Students As
sociation, was themed "One Struggle, Many Fronts." It featured a
concert, a variety of workshops and keynote speaker Glenn Omatsu,
a professor at UCLA.
"The Listen to the Silence conference is a major way for us to pub
licize Asian American studies, but it's also meant to raise awareness
about the issues, particularly since there's such a large population of
Asian Pacific Americans at Stanford University," said junior Timmy
Lu, one of the coordinators of the event. "It's important to have a
conference like this at the beginning of the year to really lay out some
of the issues and to raise awareness about what's going on in our
communities."
According to Lu, there were about 400 online registrants for the
event.
"A lot of students drop in and out, but we have a lot of students
coming from as far as Princeton," Lu said.
The conference's workshops addressed issues ranging from do
mestic violence to the challenges facing garment workers.
"I feel like I should involve myself in [the conference] to inform
myself more of all we've accomplished and the hardships we've been
through," said Tommy Phen, a student at the University of Nevada-
Reno, who attended a workshop entitled "The Korean Peninsula
Peace Movement."
The conference aimed to highlight Asian communities that are
typically underrepresented at such events, such as Asian Pacific Is
landers and Vietnamese.
"These struggles in these communities aren't usually represented
in the idea of Asian American," said Lu.
The idea of creating a community resonated with the attendees.
"I feel like I'm an outsider sometimes, so I just like to be in a place
where everybody knows things that I have to go through," said Hae
Mee Mun, also a student at Nevada-Reno.
According to Lu, recognizing diversity within the Asian Ameri
can community is the first step toward working with other disadvan
taged groups to reach political and social justice.
Omatsu encouraged students to consider the methods of Gandhi
when creating their own ways to advocate human rights, civil rights
or environmental justice.

"Students need to overcome stereotypes of activism emphasizing
militancy and patriarchy," Omatsu said. "We need to free ourselves
of Western and colonial perspectives. Students can develop compas
sion and humility and use student power to fight one struggle on
many fronts."
Following the workshops, students attended an evening concert
featuring Bao Phi, Karmacy, Jupitersciples, Golda Supanova and
other performers.
