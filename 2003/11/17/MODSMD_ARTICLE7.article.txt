## Thirteen random questions 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN STAFF WRITER 
We get in with Robin Mamlet, Stan-

ford's dean of ad
mission. Mamlet
rejects our at
tempts to scout out
her SAT scores.
But she admits
looking forward to
her new quarters.
Here, she schools
us in student
schemes, and also
essays on just how
much she likes her
job. And she insists
that the phrase

"party girl" doesn't apply to her.
IDo students ever try to fake a ter-
minal illness to try to get into Stan-
Yes. We had someone do that last
year in fact. Actually, he wrote that
his father was terminally and either
had died or was dying. His father was
perfectly healthy. In that case, the
[student's high] school called in.
There are certainly students in our
applicant pool every year who are
fraudulent in some way or another.
2 What are some other examples of
fraudulence?
Oh, you know, if I told you I'd have to
kill you.
3 Do students ever promise you
sexual favors to try to get mto
Stanford?
None have been promised to me, and
I'm not sure it would work to their ad
vantage.
What did you get on your SATs?
I couldn't possibly tell you that. Let's
just put it this way: I would never have
gotten into Stanford had I applied.
5 Weren't you offended that your
office was torched to the ground
in the movie "Orange County"'?
First of all, [the Admissions building
in the movie] was a really nice office
building and I wouldn't mind having
one that nice. We don't. Second of all,
the dean's house was pretty sweet,
and I wouldn't mind having that nice
of a house. I do like my house very
much, but that one was of a different
level. But, no, [I wasn't offended]. I
figured [a fire] would be a good way
to get a new building, but in fact we're
moving to Bakewefl [across from the
Alumni Center] soon anyway.
6 You grew up in Santa Barbara.
Have you ever partied in Isla
Vista?
No, not really. I wasn't really a parti
er as I was growing up. I was never in
vited to those parties, either.
7 Do you ever get really frustrated
and just want to put all the appli
cations on a big wall and throw darts
to see who gets in?
You know, I don't. I know I should
sort of make the article more jazzy by
saying that, yeah, there are times that
I ao, but no, I really love reading ap
plications and I believe in this pro
cess.
8 When you reject student applica
tions, do you secretly mutter
under your breath, "You are the
weakest link, Good-bye!"
No, I don't. But I did use to work at a
school that had a big gong, and every
time somebody got denied — whicn
wasn't really as frequently as at Stan
ford — they'd get gongea.
9 You attend a lot of national ad
missions officer conferences.
How do admissions officers boogie
down?
Some of them do boogie, but I was
never a partier and still really am not.
10 Can you name names?
I have to take the fifth on that one. I
don't go, typically. I'm more of a
'quiet dinner with friends' person.
n If The Daily were a prospective
applicant, what would you do:
let us in, or send us packing to Cal?
I'd have to say that I'd be impressed
with the level of the writing out I'd
want to look at your grades a little
more.
'I You fly to a lot of conferences
the University's buck. Do
you get to keep the frequent flyer
miles?
I do get to keep the frequent flyer
miles, but don't tell anybody.
"1 Tell me the truth: I'm the one
X that got in by mistake, right?
You're not. We make no mistakes.
