# Assaulting the Silence
## 
### MARY F. ALBERT 
Ever wonder what happened... after the party ended? One out of
every four women you see as you bike to class will be sexually assaulted
by a partner at some point in her life, according to statistics posted by the
National Institute of Justice. Despite the services and organizations
offering help, domestic violence and sexual assault, even here at Stan
ford, often goes unreported.

6:50 p.m., July 29: domestic disturbance re
ported at Salvatierra St. (Quad 4).
1 a.m., Oct. 5: rape reported at 500 Lasuen
Mall.
1:55 a.m., Oct. 30: Sexual battery reported
near Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue.
Karen Martell, a sister at Pi Beta Phi sorority,
said that one of her close friends was raped while
at Stanford. And yet, Martell said, "because of
her feelings of shame and regret, she convinced
herself that it had never happened."
Nearly 25 percent of American women are
raped or physically assaulted by an intimate part
ner at some point in their lives, according to a
Department of Justice survey conducted in 2000.
And Stanford women are no exception.
The Stanford community is not a hotbed of
sexual transgressions, but some sex crimes still
occur. Women are usually on the receiving end
of domestic violence, but not always there are
also male victims. Domestic violence is more
common among graduate students, faculty, and
staff, while date rape occurs more frequently
among undergraduates, officials say.
Domestic violence has occurred among 15
percent of married students, as well as among
faculty and staff. This year, Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety has received five reports of
domestic violence on campus so far. The de
partment received 10 reports of domestic vio
lence in 2002, and seven in 2001.
The Stanford Help Center, which provides
counseling to members and family of Stanford's
faculty and staff, received eight domestic vio
lence calls last year.
The root case of domestic violence lies in a
struggle for power, said David Rasch, director of
the Stanford Help Center. "The perpetrator uses
intimidation or violence as a tactic to gain or
maintain control over the victim," said Rasch.
"Fear that the violence will occur again can
prevent victims from seeking help," said Rasch.
"Some victims fear losing their community if
they leave their marriage. Many are brainwashed
by their aggressors to believe that they can't
leave. And sometimes there are issues of eco
nomic dependence, especially if the couple's
children need financial support."
Laura Wilson, director of Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety, said that the majority of
domestic violence cases she has handled have oc
curred among international graduate students.
Alejandro Martinez, director of Counseling
and Psychological Services, said that he does not
consider the international community inherently
more vulnerable to domestic violence.
However, Martinez noted, "there is certainly
a difference in the level of disbelief among inter
national students about how domestic violence is
handled in the United States. Foreign students
are often surprised that their aggressors can be
arrested. They are also less likely to understand
what services are available to them."
Vaden's Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices runs a 24-hour hotline for crisis counseling:
Specially trained staff at the Center assist student
survivors of sexdal assault. Counseling and Psy
chological Services also provides free initial eval
uations and short-term counseling for individu
als, couples and groups.
The Help Center provides up to 10 free ses
sions of confidential counseling to members and
family of faculty and staff.
Despite the campus resources available for
domestic violence victims, however, incidents
are underreported, and not as many people use
the services as possible, sources say.
Just as their grad-school sisters do not always
report sexual incidents, undergraduates seem to
follow suit, keeping silent about being sexually
assaulted.
Due to such reticence, it is difficult to gauge
the amount of cases which have gone unreport
ed. A National Institute of Justice survey con
ducted in 2000 estimates that only five percent
of rapes are reported to police.
So far, three rapes have been reported on
Stanford this year, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. In 2002, only one
was reported.
The National Institute of Justice found that
undergraduate women residing on campus are
at greater risk of being raped or sexually assault
ed than are women of different or comparable
ages in the general community. The Institute at
tributed this to the increased concentration of
young women on college campuses. For every
1,000 undergraduate women on college campus
es, 35 rapes occur, the Institute estimates.
"Among the undergraduate population at
Stanford, we have significantly more incidents
of date rape than among the graduate popula
tion," Martinez said. "This is partly because
graduate women are better able to express what
they want than undergraduate women."
"Alcohol also plays a large role," Martinez
said. "After drinking, the victim has a harder
time articulating 'no' and the aggressor has a
harder time understanding when someone
means 'no.'"

While students who have suffered from domestic violence or sexual assault seek comfort and sym
pathy from friends, oftentimes they do not report the incidents or request help from campus sources,
perhaps due to embarrassment, self-blame or even cultural barriers. The National Institute of Jus
tice estimates that only five percent of rapes are reported to the police.

perhaps due to embarrassment, self-blame or even cultural barriers. The National Institute of Jus
tice estimates that only five percent of rapes are reported to the police.
Ever wonder what happened... after the party ended? One out of
every four women you see as you bike to class will be sexually assaulted
by a partner at some point in her life, according to statistics posted by the
National Institute of Justice. Despite the services and organizations
offering help, domestic violence and sexual assault, even here at Stan
ford, often goes unreported.

6:50 p.m., July 29: domestic disturbance re
ported at Salvatierra St. (Quad 4).
1 a.m., Oct. 5: rape reported at 500 Lasuen
Mall.
1:55 a.m., Oct. 30: Sexual battery reported
near Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue.
Karen Martell, a sister at Pi Beta Phi sorority,
said that one of her close friends was raped while
at Stanford. And yet, Martell said, "because of
her feelings of shame and regret, she convinced
herself that it had never happened."
Nearly 25 percent of American women are
raped or physically assaulted by an intimate part
ner at some point in their lives, according to a
Department of Justice survey conducted in 2000.
And Stanford women are no exception.
The Stanford community is not a hotbed of
sexual transgressions, but some sex crimes still
occur. Women are usually on the receiving end
of domestic violence, but not always there are
also male victims. Domestic violence is more
common among graduate students, faculty, and
staff, while date rape occurs more frequently
among undergraduates, officials say.
Domestic violence has occurred among 15
percent of married students, as well as among
faculty and staff. This year, Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety has received five reports of
domestic violence on campus so far. The de
partment received 10 reports of domestic vio
lence in 2002, and seven in 2001.
The Stanford Help Center, which provides
counseling to members and family of Stanford's
faculty and staff, received eight domestic vio
lence calls last year.
The root case of domestic violence lies in a
struggle for power, said David Rasch, director of
the Stanford Help Center. "The perpetrator uses
intimidation or violence as a tactic to gain or
maintain control over the victim," said Rasch.
"Fear that the violence will occur again can
prevent victims from seeking help," said Rasch.
"Some victims fear losing their community if
they leave their marriage. Many are brainwashed
by their aggressors to believe that they can't
leave. And sometimes there are issues of eco
nomic dependence, especially if the couple's
children need financial support."
Laura Wilson, director of Stanford's Depart
ment of Public Safety, said that the majority of
domestic violence cases she has handled have oc
curred among international graduate students.
Alejandro Martinez, director of Counseling
and Psychological Services, said that he does not
consider the international community inherently
more vulnerable to domestic violence.
However, Martinez noted, "there is certainly
a difference in the level of disbelief among inter
national students about how domestic violence is
handled in the United States. Foreign students
are often surprised that their aggressors can be
arrested. They are also less likely to understand
what services are available to them."
Vaden's Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices runs a 24-hour hotline for crisis counseling:
Specially trained staff at the Center assist student
survivors of sexdal assault. Counseling and Psy
chological Services also provides free initial eval
uations and short-term counseling for individu
als, couples and groups.
The Help Center provides up to 10 free ses
sions of confidential counseling to members and
family of faculty and staff.
Despite the campus resources available for
domestic violence victims, however, incidents
are underreported, and not as many people use
the services as possible, sources say.
Just as their grad-school sisters do not always
report sexual incidents, undergraduates seem to
follow suit, keeping silent about being sexually
assaulted.
Due to such reticence, it is difficult to gauge
the amount of cases which have gone unreport
ed. A National Institute of Justice survey con
ducted in 2000 estimates that only five percent
of rapes are reported to police.
So far, three rapes have been reported on
Stanford this year, according to the Stanford
Department of Public Safety. In 2002, only one
was reported.
The National Institute of Justice found that
undergraduate women residing on campus are
at greater risk of being raped or sexually assault
ed than are women of different or comparable
ages in the general community. The Institute at
tributed this to the increased concentration of
young women on college campuses. For every
1,000 undergraduate women on college campus
es, 35 rapes occur, the Institute estimates.
"Among the undergraduate population at
Stanford, we have significantly more incidents
of date rape than among the graduate popula
tion," Martinez said. "This is partly because
graduate women are better able to express what
they want than undergraduate women."
"Alcohol also plays a large role," Martinez
said. "After drinking, the victim has a harder
time articulating 'no' and the aggressor has a
harder time understanding when someone
means 'no.'"
