# The 						Stanford Daily Editorials
## ASSU forum falls short of goal 
### 
The ASSU held a student publications
forum on Thursday to increase communi
cation between campus publications and
the University community. In light of re
cent events such as The Stanford Daily's publica
tion of the controversial Campustruth.org ad se
ries, The Stanford Progressive's defiance of a Uni
versity publication distribution policy and The
Stanford Review's article comparing MEChA
with the KKK. ASSU leaders said thev felt a need

to encourage dialogue
between publications
and community mem
bers. The event's orga
nizers which includ
ed ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa and
Student Publications
Director PiotrKosicki
should have done a
better job of putting
the event together to
ensure higher atten
dance and more public
ity. But also, more stu
dents should have
taken advantage of this
opportunity to express
their sentiments on is
sues related to student
publications.
The forum was not
as well organized as it
could have been. An
nouncements were sent

through dorm e-mail lists, a notice was placed on
Events.Stanford.edu and the ASSU requested
that participating publications place notices in
their papers announcing the event. But no fliers
were posted and campus publicity for the event fell
short. Only a few days notice was given before the
event was held. As well, the scheduling of the
panel was poorly conceived, as it was held at the
same time as two other events: an ASSU Speaker's

Bureau talk featuring hostage negotiator Terry
Waite and a career workshop for liberal arts ma
jors. Admittedly, it was important for the ASSU to
hold the event quickly to more effectively deal
with the issues while they were still salient. But, we
believe it would have been more important for the
event to be held at a more open time with more ad
vance notification.
While the ASSU could have done a better job of
organizing the event, there were still a large number

of students who were
aware of the event and
could have attended, but
didn't. At the forum's
height, only about 15 au
dience members were
present, with this count
including Associate
Dean of Students Thorn
Massey, ASSU Presi
dent Nadiya Figueroa,
Vice President Joey Na
toli, Senate Chair Josh
Shipp and two Daily
managing editors. This is
nothing short of disap
pointing. Many students
have expressed strong
views in the last few
weeks about controver
sies regarding campus
publications, yet few
chose to attend this
forum to further educate
themselves about the is-

sues or to voice their sentiments.
We hope that the ASSU will continue their ef
forts to bridge the gap between student publications
and the community at large, hopefully with better
organized forums that are well publicized and
scheduled more appropriately. But also, students
themselves need to choose to become involved.
Otherwise, any effort from the ASSU, no matter
how well planned, will ultimately be in vain.
