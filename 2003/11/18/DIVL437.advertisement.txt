Dr. Ted Leland, a former assistant coach at Stanford, was named Director of Athletics in 1991. Since then, Stanford has
won 44 national team championships and 149 conference championships including an NCAA record six national titles
in 1996-97 and has won the prestigious NACDA Director's Cup, emblematic of the top athletic program in the nation
for the past nine seasons. In 2002-03 alone, Stanford had 28 programs finish in the Top-25 nationally, including 13 in
the Top 5 and 24 in the Top 10. Leland has been honored by NACDA (National Association of Collegiate Directors
of Athletics) and the Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal as the Athletic Director of the Year, and was named a co
chairman of the United States Secretary of Education's Commission on Opportunity in Athletics. The 15-member panel
examined ways of strengthening enforcement of Title IX (the 30-year-old anti-discrimination law) and expanding oppor
tunities to ensure fairness for all college athletes. Leland grew up in Northern California, graduated from the University
of the Pacific, and earned a Ph.D. from Stanford in education/sports psychology.
While an undergraduate at UOP, Leland earned first team all PC A A honors as a defensive end in 1969. In addition to
his role as Athletic Director, Leland has held the position of "adjunct professor" at Dartmouth College, UOP and
Stanford, teaching courses in Sports Psychology and the Philosophy of Sport. He is currently a Distinguished Visiting
Scholar at the Hoover Institution.
What Matters to Me and Why encourages reflection within the Stanford community on matters of personal values, beliefs and motiva
tions in order to better understand the lives and inspirations of those who shape the University. For more information, contact Rabbi
Patricia Karlin-Neumann at rabbipkn@Stanford.EDU . WMMW is supported by the Deans for Religious Life and ASSU
