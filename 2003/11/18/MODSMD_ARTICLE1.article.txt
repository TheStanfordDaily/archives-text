### PRIYANKA PATHAK-NARAIN 
As Stanford students become more concerned with global issues
in the post-Sept. 11 world, the University is taking concrete steps to
deepen the opportunities available to a more internationally orient
ed campus.
According to the Registrar's Office, the number of students
earning degrees in international relations has jumped by 69 percent
in the past three years, from 71 in 1999-2000 to 120 in 2002-2003,
making last year's enrollment the highest in at least 10 years. The of
fice predicts as many as 140 students will graduate with degrees in in
ternational relations this year.
The inaugurations yesterday of the Sohaib and Sara Abbasi Pro
gram in Islamic Studies and the France-Stanford Center for Inter
disciplinary Studies reflect the increased interest in international ed
ucation.
"The University is pursuing an emphasis on international educa
tion actively," said Keith Baker, director of the France-Stanford
Center and cognizant dean for the humanities in the School of Hu-


ARON HEGYI/The Stanford Daily
manities and Sciences. "The opening
of these two programs at the same time
is not coincidence. It is a part of the
broader objectives of the University."
Baker said that there are plans to
hire more faculty in international edu
cation areas as the University contin
ues to becomes a more international
place.
With the France-Stanford Center
and the endowment for the Islamic
Studies program, Stanford aims to
build on existing interdisciplinary ef
forts.
The opening of two such interna
tional programs at the same time re
flects the University's long-standing
commitment to international educa
tion, University President John Hen
nessy said.
"Since its inception, Stanford has
opened its doors to the world, exchang
ing ideas and research with scholars in
other countries," he said.
Hennessy said the Islamic Studies

program and the France-Stanford
Center is only a part of the University's
ongoing efforts at achieving greater in
ternationalism.
"This is only a start of Stanford's
collaborations with the rest of the
world," he said. "We will be looking at
Asia soon. Apart from the traditional
commitment to the rest of the world,
this new emphasis has been sparked off
to a certain extent by 9 /11. It made
people realize the importance of un
derstanding other nations and cultures
to help maintain a more peaceful
world. Stanford realizes its responsibil
ity in this respect and aims at continu
ing to work towards greater interna
tionalization on campus."
The Islamic Studies program hopes
to increase knowledge about a region
that has been discussed more frequent
ly at Western universities since Sept.
11,2001.
Hennessy said he believes that pro
gram will make a significant contribu
tion to Stanford.
"Islam, despite its growing impor
tance in the world, is poorly and inade
quately understood in our country," he
said. "For achieving Stanford's educa
tional mission into the 21st century, we

must expand our program in Islamic
studies, and this wonderful gift will help
us do exactly that."
Sohaib Abbasi, for whom the pro
gram is in part named, wanted to better
facilitate the study of Islam at Stanford.
"I feel privileged to participate in
the formation of the Islamic Studies
Program at Stanford that will foster a
better understanding of Islam, Mus
lims and the Islamic civilization," Ab
basi said.
"Islam is one of the fastest growing
faiths in the world," said Robert Gregg,
head of Islamic Studies. "Islamic soci
eties have been and continue to be sig
nificant shapers of human history. It is
important to strengthen and expand
Stanford's educational opportunities
in Islamic studies."
Meanwhile, the France-Stanford
Center, partly funded by the French
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, aims to
foster closer relationships between
France and the United States in the
spirit of internationalism.
"This union celebrates that tradi
tion and reinforces the historic rela
tionship between our two countries at a
very important time in both our na
tions' histories," Hennessy said.

"[The] France-Stanford Center
represents an attempt to cherish a
friendship," said Jean-David Levitte,
French ambassador to the United
States. "Our friendship is a treasure. It
must be protected, preserved and
maintained. I cannot think of a better
way to contribute to this goal than
through a partnership between France
and one of America's leading research
universities in pursuit of knowledge
and understanding."
Baker is excited about the collabo
rative possibilities the partnership of
fers.
"Stanford University is tremen
dously excited about the academic
partnership between our two countries
that this center will foster," Baker said.
"The exchange of knowledge across
disciplines, including the humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences, engi
neering, business, law and medicine,
promises to create rich intellectual en
gagement on historic and contempo
rary issues from a broad range of per
spectives."
The center said that the gift from
the French ministry is not a French
comment on the existing levels of
French studies at Stanford.
