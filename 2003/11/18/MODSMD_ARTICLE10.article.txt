# The 						vectors and axioms of dating at Stanford
## 
### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
It was both pleasing and disheartening for me to learn last
week that there has been serious game theoretic research on
dating, marriage, social status and apologies. Quite a few
Stanford Economics Department professors and students
are actually investing significant man-hours in such model
ing. On the one hand, witnessing applications of math in such
perplexing human phenomena is gratifying; on the other
hand, when my theory is developed, it will unfortunately not
be the first one out there.
Let's begin today's dating session by reviewing the two
axioms that we arrived at two weeks ago. Axiom One states
that dating is nothing more than the assignment of probabil
ity of potential marriage. In particular, the gross sum of all
these probabilities should amount to one. Axiom Two states
that the assignment of such probabilities dynamically
evolves with respect to time due to non-static human condi
tions.
Given these two axioms under our belt, the problem then
becomes, how exactly are the probabilities assigned? The
third axiom attempts to address this mind-boggling question
by first defining a list and two vectors that we all inherently
possess.
The list, called the feature list, is nothing more than a se

quence of attributes that we deem of nontrivial significance
in members of the opposite sex. This list should be universal
for everybody, including attributes such as height, weight, fa
cial appearance, intelligence, honesty, humor and money.
Closely associated with the above list is a vector, called
the weight vector. This vector records the weight that we as
sign each of the attributes. Each component of the vector is
a real value between zero and one, and the sum of all com
ponent values should be one. For instance, to a woman that
craves for tall men, she might assign 0.8 to the height at
tribute; likewise, to a computer geek that seeks girls that can
factor large prime numbers in polynomial time, intelligence
might be given a 0.9 weight.
The other vector is called the score vector. While the
weight vector represents what attributes in significant others
matter to each individual, the score vector is an individual's
evaluation of a potential spouse in all those attributes.
Henceforth, each component in the score vector spells out
the quality of the candidate being evaluated in the corre
sponding attribute. Each component of the vector must be a
real value between negative 10 and positive 10. For example,
suppose the feature hst looks like (height, weight, intelli
gence, money), Alice's weight vector for this feature hst is
(0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 0.4), and her score vector for Bob is (10, 9, 3, -
1). That means that Alice believes that financial security is
the defining characteristic of attractive men and that too bad

for Bob, he scored poorly on the most important attribute.
To obtain a general picture of how much Alice likes Bob,
then, we multiply the weight of each attribute with its corre
sponding score and sum the products: 0.1 * 10 + 0.3 * 9 + 0.2
* 3 + 0.4 * (-1) = 3.9. Apparently, Bob's high score in weight
compensated for his destituteness and yielded an overall ac
ceptable rating.
If we generalize the above analysis, we arrive at Axiom
Three:
Define f as the universal feature list.
Suppose for a person A, w(A) is the weight vector for f.
And when A evaluates B, s(A, B) is the scoring vector. Then
the overall score that A assigns B is,
score(A, B) = w(A) â€¢ s(A, B)
Axiom Four comes more or less naturally. How much A
is romantically interested in B is directly proportional to
score(A, B). After all, it's intuitive that if somebody scores
off your chart, you must be crazy about him or her.
In short, one's interest in another person can be comput
ed bv dot-multiplying one's weight vector and score vector.

If the feature list is (appearance, ability to code, interest in clas
sical music, passion for soccer etc... ), then my weight vector
would be (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0,0... (all zeros)). Think you can
score above 5 with me? Then email me at xyan@stanford.edu.
