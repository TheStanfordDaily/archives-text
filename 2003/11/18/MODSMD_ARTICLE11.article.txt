## Cops should focus on just one biker 
### 
On any given morning, students bike to
class in a hurry, sometimes with cau
tion, sometimes not. While bicycle
safety is an issue that concerns every
one, it seems that recently, it has become a prior
ity of Stanford's public safety officers as well.
While blatant disobedience of traffic laws can
hardly be excused, it seems odd that so many

tickets are given to bicy
clists, especially given that
bicycle lanes, roads and
sidewalks are so poorly
defined at Stanford.

For the academic year
2002-2003,1,369 bike cita
tions were issued and 57
warnings were given.
From Sept. 15,2003 to last
week, 259 bike citations
were issued along with 331
warnings. Tickets to bicy
clists can be steep, and
end up on the driving
records that insurance
companies use to set their
rates. Running a stop sign
on a bicycle can cost $175

a ticket, roughly the same amount as running a
stop sign in a motor vehicle.
On Santa Teresa Avenue, police cars waiting
for students to disobey the law have become a
common sight. As officers stop to write one stu
dent a ticket, more students continue to blow
through the intersection that officers are moni
toring. We do not think this is an effective use of
the Stanford Police manpower.
While it's important to observe bike safety
rules, we think there are more important issues on

the police department's plate right now. For in
stance, Saturday marks the six-month anniversary
of the Serial Groper's presence on campus. Not
only is this criminal a threat to the safety of Stan
ford students, but he is also drawing negative pub
licity in the national media. The San Jose Mercury
News, The Los Angeles Times and, most recently,
The San Francisco Chronicle have reported on the

misdeeds of the groper.
There's no question
that the Stanford Po
lice Department can
catch a person riding a
bicycle without a bike
light when their en
forcement includes a
three squad car block
ade, as was the case re
cently at the corner of
Mayfield Avenue and
Campus Drive. How
ever, when the time
comes for police to
catch a criminal who
poses a dangerous
threat to campus, they
are lackluster to their

vain attempts to catch a truly criminal biker: the
Serial Groper.
We know it's not easy to catch criminals, and we
aren't pretending it is. But if we were giving out
grades for effort, the Stanford Police Department
would get an incomplete for time management.
They are focusing too much energy on bicyclists
just trying to get to class. Police should not hand
out one more ticket — from which, may we point
out, all of the proceeds go to Santa Clara County
— until the Serial Groper is behind bars.

"There's no question that
the Stanford Police Depart
ment can catch a person rid
ing a bicycle without a bike
light when their enforcement
includes a three squad car
blockade."
