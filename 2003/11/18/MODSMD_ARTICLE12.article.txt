# Financial aid policies unfair
## 
### 
Last week, The New York Times re
leased data showing a large discrep
ancy in the amount of financial aid
per student that is given to very es
teemed schools, Stanford included. Even
when the amount of aid given is controlled
for factors like the cost of attendance and
the amount of need, Stanford and other Ivy
League schools receive disproportionate
amounts of federal aid, while many state
schools are left with meager portions.
For instance, last year Stanford received
$211.80 for every student who applied for
aid. The national average was only $14.38.
The University of Madison at Wisconsin got
just pennies per student â€” $0.21 to be exact.
Although these numbers are just averages,
the comparison is stark. While Stanford
does cost more than many other schools,
there are many people for whom Stanford
and its counterparts are not an option, and it
is unfair to deprive the vast majority of the
population who will attend College some
where other than Stanford a vastly dispro
portionate amount of aid.
This issue is, of course, not cut and dried.
Many factors must be considered when de
ciding federal financial aid. It would be just
as bad to deprive all students below a certain
income level the opportunity to attend

whatever school they wanted because all the
aid was slated for schools with lower costs of
attendance.
What makes the current distribution es
pecially unfair, though, is that it is not based
on any rational criteria; it is instead a
holdover from the days when aid was dis
tributed to colleges on an individual, nego
tiable basis. It seems obvious that most of
the differences in allocation are at
tributable to this past system, not to any
consideration of which students need the
money the most.
The best system would be one that con
sidered the need of each individual student
in accordance with the cost of the school he
wanted to attend. This would allow students
to attend the best possible school for them,
while also taking into account the various
costs of institutions of higher learning.
Although this problem does not affect
Stanford students in any negative way, stu
dents should still be concerned with the un
fair effect that this funding discrepancy has
on many people who want to attend college.
The distribution of aid across the country
should be based on an honest assessment of
the relative need of individual students
rather than an outdated system of distribu
tion based on national prominence.
