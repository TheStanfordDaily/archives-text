Reader skeptical of Singh's letter

Unfortunately, Mr. Jagjit Singh's
bias ("Readers criticize Campus
truth.org ads," Nov. 10) in the Israel-
Palestine conflict is ail-too transpar
ent. His attempt to provide counter
examples to the controversial Cam
pustruth.org ads lacks a critical ele
ment: Nobody celebrated those
deaths. Did Israelis celebrate in the
streets when the U.S.S. Liberty was
attacked? Did Israelis celebrate in
the streets when Rachel Corrie was
run over by a bulldozer?
What makes homicide bombing
attacks deplorable is not only the act
itself, but the fact that the act is cele
brated. In fact, the more people that
are killed, the bigger the celebration.
Mr. Singh's failure to recognize
this key difference is perhaps also
the reason that he talks out of both
sides of his mouth with regard to
homicide bombings. He pays hp ser
vice to terrorism being "indefensi
ble" but then goes on a length rant
about all the "atrocities" that Israel
has committed and toward the end
by suggests reading a book whose
title implies that the Palestinian ter
rorism is justified. I readily admit
that I have not read the book. But
Mr. Singh's recommendation is not
going to carry a lot of weight with
me.

When will all of us wake up to the
fact that both sides are wrong? Each
side attempts to justify its actions as
being in retaliation for the most re
cent wrong committed by the other
side, which in turn was done for the
exact same reason. The Sharon gov
ernment must stop building in dis
puted lands and the Palestinian gov
ernment must stop terrorism that is
originating from within its borders.

Poets are writers, too

Your Intermission section on
writers ("The Short Story on Stan
ford Writers," Nov. 14) left out half
the story. Ever heard of Robert Pin
sky? How about Yvor Winters,
Denise Levertov, Thom Gunn,
Edgar Bowers, Donald Justice,
Susan Howe or Sharon Olds? These
are some of biggest names amongst
American writers — they just hap
pen to have written poetry, not fic
tion. You might also want to look
into Eavan Boland, Ken Fields, W.

S. DiPiero, Gabrielle Calvocoressi,
Dana Gioia, Maijorie Perloff, Annie
Finch, Bei Dao, Cyrus Cassells, Suji
Kuwock Kim, David McCombs, N.
Scott Mammedaty or Kevin Young,
just to get you started on a few oth
ers.

AJ. needs to decide
what he wants

In response to senior A.J. Magnu
son's column last week ("Tresidder
Union is not that cool," Nov. 14), all
I have to say is this: What do you
want, A.J.? You complain about ev
erything from Everyday People (one
of the finest a cappella groups this
school has to offer), to every facet of
Tresidder Union to Stanford organi
zations like Residential Education
and the Office of Student Activities.
Other than gripe and blow minor in
conveniences out of proportion,
there's not much you do to con
tribute to the union's well being.
($38 for a stale box of cereal? Please,
now you're just being sensationalis
tic.)

If you're dissatisfied with some
thing, why not fill out a comment
card or send an e-mail and actually
try to effect some change in our one
and only student union? If you be
lieve "there wasn't anything cool
there to begin with," why didn't you
speak up during the planning stages
for the renovations? If you didn't ap
prove of the old union, and if the new
one still displeases you, what will
please you?
My prediction: nothing. But don't
tell the entire Stanford community
about your dissatisfaction while you
sit around doing nothing. Be con
structive and tell Vice Provost for
Student Affairs Gene Awakuni.
Maybe someone will put in an ar
cade, or bowling alley, or wet bar, or
roulette table, or Beirut tables or...

Please Think Before Crossing the
Safeway Picket Line

Yesterday I drove into the Safe
way parking lot to find that many of
the employees are on strike. As I
child growing up, every five years my
father's union, communication
workers of America, entered con

tract negotiations with Pacific Bell.
The outcomes of these negotiations
determined the salary my father
would receive, the hours he would
work, the vacation he would be able
to take and most importantly, health
care coverage for our entire family.
The question around contract nego
tiation time became: Would the
union strike or wouldn't it. One year
the contract negotiations stalled so
badly that the union went on strike
and it continued for six weeks. It was
only through the kindness of friends
and family who often "dropped by"
with extra food that my family sur
vived the negotiations. Despite the
hardship on my family, the strike was
important — my family desperately
needed healthcare coverage and my
father needed a living wage (in 1980
was about $20,000 in rural Califor
nia).

In today's economy, employer
provided health care coverage is in
creasingly becoming more expensive
and more unaffordable for the lower
middle class and working class. As
healthcare coverage shrinks, it is
those who make between $25,000-
$50,000 a year, and those employed
by small employers who are finding
themselves either without employer
provided health care coverage, or
worse yet, unable to afford coverage
for either themselves or their fami
lies. Compounding the problem is the
fiscal crises experienced by all 50
states. States can no longer afford to
provide coverage for the uninsured.
Healthcare and education are the
biggest areas of the state budget, and
since states cannot cut back on educa
tion, they must cut back on healthcare
in order to solve their fiscal crises.

Safeway workers are on strike be
cause their healthcare benefits are in
danger of being cut. These workers
are not highly paid and employer
subsidies often make the difference
between being able to afford health
care or doing without. Even if you do
not support unions, please think long
and hard before crossing the picket
line and do not cross it simply for
convenience sake. Safeway is facing
stiff competition from Wal-Mart and
other superstores, but their decisions
on how to compete are affecting the
health of real people and real fami
lies, many of whom will probably be
left without affordable health care if
Safeway's policies go through.
