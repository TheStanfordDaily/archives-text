## A 						tribute to Edward Said 
### KHALIL BARHOUM 
Deservedly so, the tributes to Ed
ward Said continue to pour in more
than 40 days after his death. Who
amongst us ever contemplated the
moment when this giant of a man
would finally fall and vanish from our
lives once and for all? Despite our
knowledge, all along, that he had been
so gallantly battling leukemia since
1991, deep down we somehow imag
ined — perhaps even believed — that
Edward Said was virtually indestruc
tible. And who can blame us if we so
thought? Just witness the dizzying
pace he maintained since he learned
of his disease. Or, take a look at the
stunning mass of literary output that
he has yielded within that period.
Upon hearing of Said's passing,
writer and friend, Alexander Cock
burn, observed:
"He lived at a rate that would have
felled a man half his age and 10 times
as healthy: a plane to London, an hon
orary degree, on to Lebanon, on to the
West Bank, on to Cairo, to Madrid,
back to New York. And all the while
he was pouring out the Said prose that
I most enjoyed, the fiery diatribes he
distributed to ... a vast world audi
ence."
Fact is, over the years, we have
grown too accustomed to expecting
the most from Edward Said. And, why
not? After all, he had his own stan
dards to live up to. We, on the other
hand, were more or less bound by the
normal constraints of time and space,
so we could simply afford to stand by
and watch sheer greatness as it impas
sively paraded before our eyes in a
multitude of forms.
All of us knew what to expect of
him, and Said always delivered. Never
one to disappoint, along the way he
critically provided us with a moral
compass, one that helped us navigate
a path through the murky moral and
political terrains which have often im
peded a clear perception of the endur
ing justice of the Palestinian cause. As
he did so, his clear vision was certain
ly matched by a strong conviction; he
never wavered, nor was he ever
cowed.
Yes, you might say that Said was a
man on a mission ever since he began
to come to terms with his own mortal

ity. Actually, the ones who never
seemed ready to acknowledge the im
pending epilogue were the many
friends and admirers among us who
were attempting to dispel, if not total
ly deny, this reality at least for a while
longer. As for him, realizing that he al
ready had a date with destiny, he felt
strongly that there still was much too
much to be accomplished: old battles
to fight, new concepts to fashion, fresh
opinions to mold, exciting stories to
share and many more miles to travel.
Many more miles.
Unlike most of us, Said did not
have the luxury of waiting for a more
opportune time or some appropriate
state in life to do all these things. Such
mundane considerations did not pre
occupy him in the least. So he tireless
ly toiled away, while the rest of us
mainly stood back and simply ad
mired what we saw, part in awe but
also part in envy.
How did he manage all of this with
so little time? How could he not be
bothered with such considerations
that have kept many of us awake
many a night, due possibly to fear of
an adverse reaction to words or ac
tions that might be appropriated to us
here or there or every now and then?
As his legend grew, so did his
stature and our reliance on the bound
less energies of his intellect and the
unwavering courage of his convic
tions. Yet, despite all his countless ac
complishments, he was never em
braced or fully endorsed by the so
called American mainstream which
bestows its favors generally on those
who tow the line. So it goes. He blithe
ly lived his life on the outside looking
in for the most part, quite content to
be universally on the side of the op
pressed and the less fortunate.
One cannot help but wonder what
Said's place in conventional historical
accounts would be had he been judged
creditable by the prevailing political
culture and the media elite in the
United States. One certainly wonders,
would he be a bit, or rather a lot, more
famous now were he not so closely
wedded to the Palestinian cause and
the defense of similar other seemingly
losing issues —as he liked to call
them?

I am afraid these questions are
merely for the idle at this point. The
truth is, Said had no regrets over the
positions he espoused over the years •
because his were those of a man who
cherished justice over power, con
science over fame, and universal
human rights over xenophobic and
parochial interests. Needless to say,
individuals like him are quite unique;
and for that we are immensely grate
ful.
His impassioned defense of the
Palestinian people's rights constitut
ed, for all practical purposes, an in
tegral part of his unyielding overall
commitment to human rights and
reaffirmed, yet again, their central
role in the conduct of relations on
the individual, national and interna
tional levels. His courage and persis
tence in seeking and always uphold
ing these fundamental principles
and basic human values have cer
tainly made him a hero for pro-
Palestinian rights advocates as well
as a symbol, to people worldwide, of
innate human decency in the face of
inexorable power and crushing in
justice.
Said will be greatly missed by all of
us who were fortunate enough to have
known him. In no small measure, he
will be remembered around the world
as a champion of humanity, dignity,
freedom and, above all, stubborn re
sistance against overwhelming odds.
