# YOU GO GABE
## College students say what? 
### 
If you've never been part of the sober
minority in a room full of intoxicated
freshmen, you are missing out on an
interesting time. There's something
about alcohol that makes even the most re
served scholars of Math 51H reveal deep
seated secrets, start calling you "Chris"
and broach topics that rarely arise in casu
al conversation. Although some of these
topics aren't fit to discuss in a wholesome
community newspaper, I have noticed one
recurring theme that I never expected
from freshmen under the influence: philos
ophy.

When a person's inhibitions are
stripped away, it's easy to find out what he
really thinks. In many cases, what's even
more surprising is what he thinks about.
Of those polled in my most recent scientif
ic survey (three dormmates and my squir
rel, Jumpers), 75 percent expressed a
strong interest in philosophical topics that
they would never dare to bring up over
dinner. We college students think about
the big questions. We're looking for an
swers. We just don't like to let on.
Despite my instinctive aversion to
Latin phrases and the word "hence," I
enjoy philosophy quite a bit myself. But I
was a little confused when I read one of the
new additions to our already teeming bul
letin board: "What is TRUTH? Can we
know it?" No further description avail
able. It sounded vaguely profound, but
what was this about? Logic? Religion?
Was it one of those confusing anti-smoking
ads? Even so, it was the most thought-pro
voking question a flyer had asked me all
day (although "Gaieties 2003 — Why the
Hell Not?" was a close second), and I de
cided to give it a go. And so it was that I
found myself night-biking through murky
puddles and drizzling rain to attend a lec
ture I knew nothing about, save for the fact
that two visiting professors were to speak
on these two elusive questions.
And speak they did. After Doug
Geivett, Ph.D. in Philosophy, laid out the
importance of beliefs, truth, reason and ev
idence, he presented "A Short Argument
for the Existence of God," which was fur
ther expounded upon at length by Greg
Jesson of the University of Iowa. As a
Christian myself, I had few arguments with
their message, but those who expected an
objective comparison of Kant and
Kierkegaard found themselves at a decep
tively one-sided lecture. Despite the secu
lar nature of the flyer, the presentation
embraced a distinctively theistic tone. I
was puzzled. The flyer hadn't said one

word about God or religion or belief. Why,
then, did I have two handouts summariz
ing arguments for the existence of God?
My first hypothesis of a proselytical
agenda did not appear too likely on further

examination. On the
contrary, Geivett and
Jesson seemed intent
on inspiring students to
think for themselves,
but simply wanted to
demonstrate that the
ism was an important
and fully rational be
lief. When one student
asserted the impor
tance of faith after the
presentation, Jesson
managed a skeptical

smile.
"Er, yes," the professor continued, "but
we're really more interested in the evi
dence."

Then why the vagueness of the an
nouncement? I think the answer is that
people are uncomfortable addressing reli
gious concepts in everyday social settings.
Even a flyer with religious overtones is
taboo. It's a pity, because the equivocal
flyer may have caused many people to miss
out on a great seminar. Geivett and Jesson
were engaging, interesting and entertain
ing. They put such topics as the correspon
dence theory of truth, Zeno's paradox and
epistemological chance in language that
even Jumpers could understand. More im
portantly, each had a comfortable, friendly
manner of speaking that seemed to say with
every assertion: "But what do you think?"
I think that's what many of us are look
ing to be asked, even as we remain open to
others' ideas. We want to be talked to
about our beliefs, not talked at. We have
some notion of what we believe, but we
want to clarify, solidify, fill in gaps and dis
cover holes. Stanford is a great place to en
gage in such discussions. But don't expect
anything to be handed to you on a silver,
answer-containing platter. Meaningful
philosophic exchanges in everyday life are
still few and far between. Unless students
talk about these issues outside of class and
Corona-assisted discussion, the road to
truth could be slow going indeed.

Freshman Gabriel Recchia is a habitual
liar, but only in that he doesn't really have
a squirrel named Jumpers. Feel free to let
him know what you believe-about any
thing — at grecchia@stanford.edu.

tance of faith after the
presentation, Jesson
managed a skeptical

smile.
"Er, yes," the professor continued, "but
we're really more interested in the evi
dence."

Then why the vagueness of the an
nouncement? I think the answer is that
people are uncomfortable addressing reli
gious concepts in everyday social settings.
Even a flyer with religious overtones is
taboo. It's a pity, because the equivocal
flyer may have caused many people to miss
out on a great seminar. Geivett and Jesson
were engaging, interesting and entertain
ing. They put such topics as the correspon
dence theory of truth, Zeno's paradox and
epistemological chance in language that
even Jumpers could understand. More im
portantly, each had a comfortable, friendly
manner of speaking that seemed to say with
every assertion: "But what do you think?"
I think that's what many of us are look
ing to be asked, even as we remain open to
others' ideas. We want to be talked to
about our beliefs, not talked at. We have
some notion of what we believe, but we
want to clarify, solidify, fill in gaps and dis
cover holes. Stanford is a great place to en
gage in such discussions. But don't expect
anything to be handed to you on a silver,
answer-containing platter. Meaningful
philosophic exchanges in everyday life are
still few and far between. Unless students
talk about these issues outside of class and
Corona-assisted discussion, the road to
truth could be slow going indeed.

Freshman Gabriel Recchia is a habitual
liar, but only in that he doesn't really have
a squirrel named Jumpers. Feel free to let
him know what you believe-about any
thing — at grecchia@stanford.edu.
