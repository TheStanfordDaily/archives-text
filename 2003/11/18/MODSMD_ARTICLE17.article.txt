# WELCOME TO WALLACE WORLD
## Dean's words tell us something 
### 
The recent controversy surrounding
presidential contender Howard
Dean, confederate flags and pick
up trucks reminds me of two
things:
The first is the words on the decorated
bulletin board of Mrs. Tuttle's sixth grade
history class. "What is popular is not al
ways right," it read, "and what is right is
not always popular." The second is the run
ning debate we have in the Communication
department about transparency versus the
airbrush of propriety and political correct
ness.
Dean's verbal mishap and the ensuing
media barrage embody the argument, and
reveal a gap between the sentiments of the
press and the people, between symbols and
real-life issues.
Let's look at Dean's words before the
Democratic National last
February:
"I intend to talk about race during this
election in the South. The Republicans
have been talking about it since 1968 in
order to divide us, and I'm going to bring us
together. Because you know what? White
folks in the South who drive pickup trucks
with Confederate flag decals on the back
ought to be voting with us because their
kids don't have health insurance either,
and their kids need better schools, too."
A black and white crowd responded to
this speech with a standing ovation. Now
that the press has popped on the klieg
lights, Dean is dogged with allegations of
racism and stereotyping; His words are get
ting ink but his meaning has been lost.
The odd coupling of southern whites and
A1 Sharpton in criticism of Dean's state

ment only furthers the problem. These
groups are acting as if nothing's wrong ex
cept for the stereotypes of Yankee Dean.
There IS a race problem in the South that is
bigger than the debate over the flag, like
the numbers of black males in prison, fair
ness of prison sentences, discrimination
(yes, still) in housing, jobs, the slim num
bers of blacks in political office. The focus
on words is a shift from policy to symbol-

ism.
Last week's issue of
Newsweek carried a men
tion of Dean's campaign in
the Conventional Wisdom
section of the magazine
that boasts of having a fin
ger on the pulse of Ameri
ca's ever-changing mood.
Dean's "stiff-neck red
neck gaffe shows he's still
out of his league," it
wrote, never considering

the public might not be interested in a
politician in league with the group now in
power.
Polish. Soundbites. Slick marketing with
slim substance. This is what Americans
have come to expect from campaigns, and
in the past, campaigns are most successful
when they deal least with real issues. As the
great Sam Smith, Washington D.C. gadfly
and writer, affirms, the basic function of
the political campaign is to take our mind
off our problems — to argue about symbol
ism rather than reality.
Dean's consistent poll numbers despite
the bad press might be a sign the public on
the whole prefers a more honest political
process and politicians that occasionally

say the wrong thing and even offend. In
other words, transparency over political
correctness, and what is true over what is
popular.
It remains to be seen how the public will
ultimately view Dean's "honest talk" cam
paign, or if Dean is in fact being honest or
just running a campaign to appeal to the
"truth-seeking / establishment-weary" de
mographic. But while the press quibbles
over words and symbols, it is apparent
there is a group of Americans hungry for
discussion of policy and real problems —
the stuff buried underneath all that popular
political correctness.
Will politicians be more cautious in their
speech regarding the South and race rela
tions after Dean's press excoriation? Like
ly. Will politicians, reporters and the public
cease to have opinions? Probably not, but
will these unspoken opinions be less in
formed because of stifled speech? Abso
lutely.
Honest speech, unrestrained from politi
cal correctness, is the only way we can know
who leads us — or would lead us, who sifts
the intelligence at the Pentagon, who is
writing the anti-war news reports, and how
we can deal with all those crazy details of
living in a melting pot adrift in a great, big
diverse world. If people fear to speak their
opinions, it doesn't mean they cease to hold
them, and if withholding your true opinions
is popular, it doesn't mean it's right.
