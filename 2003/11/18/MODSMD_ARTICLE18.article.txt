## Spencer takes on water polo team in beauty contest 
### 
You've seen them. You've basked in their
glow. You've pined for their looks, then
attitude and their glorious slang. You've
followed them through a packed dance
floor just to get a closer look at their chiseled fea
tures, fluid moves and chlorine-bleached hair.
You've exclaimed to your 23 best girlfriends that
you would do anything for just one night with Tony
Azevedo. I know I have! (What? Who wrote that?).
You, girls of Stanford University, are officially in
love with the Stanford men's water polo team.
But I've got a shocker for you.
Spencer Porter, this humble sports columnist, be
lieves he is hotter than the entire polo team.
I can hear you scream already, "But Spencer, I'm
looking at your picture, and it isn't exactly Brad Pitt
looking back at me! The polo team was in People's
50 Most Beautiful People a couple years ago! They
are the alpha males on campus! You, on the other
hand, claim at worst to have a striking resemblance
to Punky Brewster, the plucky girl from after-school
specials in the 80s, and at best you look like Jason
Biggs from 'American Pie.' "

Or, as junior Mike "Not Eddie"
Murray put it: "Spencer, there is
no way in hell you are even in their
same league"
That may all be true, but I am
hotter, and here's why.
First off, the slang. Dude, bro
(pronounced "brah"). Sorry dude,
sorry bro, but your SoCal witti
cisms are not hella tight at all. In
fact, in my NorCal splendor, I
might even say they were hella

wack. (Wow, if this column is going to try to win with
arguments like that, give up now. Do the crossword.)
Second, the clothes. I mentioned this last week,
but those water polo guys seem to only wear Stan
ford Athletic gear, making sure that everyone knows
that the swagger in their step doesn't come from
beer bashes at KA, but from the chlorine that has ob
viously impaired their balance.
Now, those of you who follow this column with
any regularity will know that I whined about Nike
and trucker hats last week, only to wear a faux-Von
Dutch hat and Stanford Nike Jacket for the greater
part of last week. So, yes, I am a hypocrite. You
know what, never mind, just screw it. Water polo,
wear whatever the hell you want.
But the real reason behind this column — the
moment I knew I was at the pinnacle of attractive
ness on this campus — was a showdown with the
team in front of the Clock Tower last Thursday at 11
a.m.
You see, friends, the water polo team exudes its
supreme alpha male status with something they call
the "Post-up" — an activity in which eight-to-10 of
them sit outside the Clock Tower in the morning,
basking in the sun and watching us mere mortals
crash our bikes into one another, all the while carry
ing on conversations with an astonishing overuse of
the words "dude," "bro" and the risky, but highly re
spected, "dude-bro."
I had passed by this spectacle many times as I
pedaled my way to class, gazing at their sun-gold
ened bodies and listening to their sweet inane chat
ter. (What the hell am I writing?)
And as I ran down an unsuspecting freshman, I
had an epiphany: to truly show the world that I am
hotter than the water polo team, I must out-post-up
them. I must beat them at their own game.
So with the help of Mike "More like Alba-an
kles" Albanese, Steve "that Who's Rick? Myrick
joke is so getting old" Myrick and Mike "please
don't put me in any more columns" Murray, last
Thursday, I posted up.
At first, we were grossly outnumbered, facing
down a group nearly double our size. But were we
out-cooled? Hardly.
Decked out in our trucker hats, varsity parapher
nalia, sunglasses and general indifference, we were
postin' with the best of them. Random people would
bike by, but we were much too cool to say hello.
Please. Only if it was a good friend would we
maybe shake our hair at them, and even that was
pushing it. Besides, our conversation was much too
engaging to be interrupted, a constant repeat of:
"What's up dude?"
"Nothin', what's up bro?"
"Just postin' bro."
"Nice. Sweet hang dude."
"Thanks bro."
So hot right now. Like Hansel. So hot.
Soon enough, the water polo team's post-up
broke up like a Row party at 12:59 a.m. As we stared
them down, they cowered in our dominance, unable
to even make eye contact with the new top dogs on
campus. They walked to their longboards with their
tails between their legs and their once fluffy hair now
flat as the pool they swim in.
Now the critics among you might ask if the polo
team actually "saw" us posting up, if they "knew"
that they were in a coolness contest or if they were
"leaving in shame" as much as "having to go to
class."
In this case, the critics are probably right.
Oh well, I guess the gig is up: I'm not hotter than
the entire men's water polo team.
I'll never have that chlorinated swagger, that
SoCal shine from "The O.C." I'll never have girls
flock to me, guys envy me or show up in People's 50
Most Beautiful People issue.
So dude, bro and dude-bro — sorry, maybe I'm
not hotter than the Stanford water polo team.
But I know I'm hotter than whatever they have in
Berkeley.

Spencer Porter, a junior, promises to write about
real sports in his next column, he swears. He'll be at
Big Game wearing a trucker hat and Stanford Nike
Gear, trying to schmooze with the polo guys. Post

Second, the clothes. I mentioned this last week,
but those water polo guys seem to only wear Stan
ford Athletic gear, making sure that everyone knows
that the swagger in their step doesn't come from
beer bashes at KA, but from the chlorine that has ob
viously impaired their balance.
Now, those of you who follow this column with
any regularity will know that I whined about Nike
and trucker hats last week, only to wear a faux-Von
Dutch hat and Stanford Nike Jacket for the greater
part of last week. So, yes, I am a hypocrite. You
know what, never mind, just screw it. Water polo,
wear whatever the hell you want.
But the real reason behind this column — the
moment I knew I was at the pinnacle of attractive
ness on this campus — was a showdown with the
team in front of the Clock Tower last Thursday at 11
a.m.
You see, friends, the water polo team exudes its
supreme alpha male status with something they call
the "Post-up" — an activity in which eight-to-10 of
them sit outside the Clock Tower in the morning,
basking in the sun and watching us mere mortals
crash our bikes into one another, all the while carry
ing on conversations with an astonishing overuse of
the words "dude," "bro" and the risky, but highly re
spected, "dude-bro."
I had passed by this spectacle many times as I
pedaled my way to class, gazing at their sun-gold
ened bodies and listening to their sweet inane chat
ter. (What the hell am I writing?)
And as I ran down an unsuspecting freshman, I
had an epiphany: to truly show the world that I am
hotter than the water polo team, I must out-post-up
them. I must beat them at their own game.
So with the help of Mike "More like Alba-an
kles" Albanese, Steve "that Who's Rick? Myrick
joke is so getting old" Myrick and Mike "please
don't put me in any more columns" Murray, last
Thursday, I posted up.
At first, we were grossly outnumbered, facing
down a group nearly double our size. But were we
out-cooled? Hardly.
Decked out in our trucker hats, varsity parapher
nalia, sunglasses and general indifference, we were
postin' with the best of them. Random people would
bike by, but we were much too cool to say hello.
Please. Only if it was a good friend would we
maybe shake our hair at them, and even that was
pushing it. Besides, our conversation was much too
engaging to be interrupted, a constant repeat of:
"What's up dude?"
"Nothin', what's up bro?"
"Just postin' bro."
"Nice. Sweet hang dude."
"Thanks bro."
So hot right now. Like Hansel. So hot.
Soon enough, the water polo team's post-up
broke up like a Row party at 12:59 a.m. As we stared
them down, they cowered in our dominance, unable
to even make eye contact with the new top dogs on
campus. They walked to their longboards with their
tails between their legs and their once fluffy hair now
flat as the pool they swim in.
Now the critics among you might ask if the polo
team actually "saw" us posting up, if they "knew"
that they were in a coolness contest or if they were
"leaving in shame" as much as "having to go to
class."
In this case, the critics are probably right.
Oh well, I guess the gig is up: I'm not hotter than
the entire men's water polo team.
I'll never have that chlorinated swagger, that
SoCal shine from "The O.C." I'll never have girls
flock to me, guys envy me or show up in People's 50
Most Beautiful People issue.
So dude, bro and dude-bro — sorry, maybe I'm
not hotter than the Stanford water polo team.
But I know I'm hotter than whatever they have in
Berkeley.

Spencer Porter, a junior, promises to write about
real sports in his next column, he swears. He'll be at
Big Game wearing a trucker hat and Stanford Nike
Gear, trying to schmooze with the polo guys. Post

You've seen them. You've basked in their
glow. You've pined for their looks, then
attitude and their glorious slang. You've
followed them through a packed dance
floor just to get a closer look at their chiseled fea
tures, fluid moves and chlorine-bleached hair.
You've exclaimed to your 23 best girlfriends that
you would do anything for just one night with Tony
Azevedo. I know I have! (What? Who wrote that?).
You, girls of Stanford University, are officially in
love with the Stanford men's water polo team.
But I've got a shocker for you.
Spencer Porter, this humble sports columnist, be
lieves he is hotter than the entire polo team.
I can hear you scream already, "But Spencer, I'm
looking at your picture, and it isn't exactly Brad Pitt
looking back at me! The polo team was in People's
50 Most Beautiful People a couple years ago! They
are the alpha males on campus! You, on the other
hand, claim at worst to have a striking resemblance
to Punky Brewster, the plucky girl from after-school
specials in the 80s, and at best you look like Jason
Biggs from 'American Pie.' "

Or, as junior Mike "Not Eddie"
Murray put it: "Spencer, there is
no way in hell you are even in their
same league"
That may all be true, but I am
hotter, and here's why.
First off, the slang. Dude, bro
(pronounced "brah"). Sorry dude,
sorry bro, but your SoCal witti
cisms are not hella tight at all. In
fact, in my NorCal splendor, I
might even say they were hella

wack. (Wow, if this column is going to try to win with
arguments like that, give up now. Do the crossword.)
