# Stanford falls to No. 1 USC
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Like every other team that has come
up against No. 1 Southern California this
year, the No. 7 Stanford Cardinal left
empty handed.
The Cardinal failed to complete a
sweep of the Los Angeles schools in a 3-1
loss to USC, after a win at UCLA the
night before. t
The loss dropped Stanford to a 19-6
record overall, with a 12-4 record in Pacif
ic 10 Conference play. The Women of
Troy remained undefeated on the year,
improving to 25-0 overall and 16-0 in the
Pac-10. USC had already locked up the
conference championship the night be
fore, with a win over Cal.
Uncharacteristically, Stanford was
able to win the opening game of the
match, beating USC 30-27. The game was
close at the beginning, but then Stanford
moved ahead to a 19-12 lead because of
strong serving from junior Jennifer Hucke
and digs by Leahi Hall. USC pulled back
into the match at 21-17, but the Cardinal
went on another run, bringing the score to
29-25, with junior outsider hitter Ogonna
Nnamani's kill sealing the deal at 30-27.
However, this was the last time Stan
ford controlled the match, as USC rallied
quickly to dispose of the Cardinal, win
ning the next three games in convincing
fashion.
Game two was close until USC took an
11-6 lead on a four-point run. The Trojans
never looked back, hitting over .500 on
their way to a 30-13 win. The Cardinal
only hit .048.
Stanford hung around for a while in
game three, but after another four-point
Trojan run, the Cardinal trailed 18-10.

Junior outside hitter Ogonna Nnamani spikes the ball over the net. The No. 7 Cardinal fell to No. 1 Southern California 3-1 on Saturday.
Stanford will close out the Pacific 10 Conference season this weekend against Oregon and Oregon State.
From there, USC went on a 7-5 run
and finished out with a 5-3 run to
win by a score of 30-18.
Game four proved to be the de
ciding one, as the Trojans controlled
Stanford again, closing out the
match on a Stanford blocking error,
winning the game 30-18 and the
match 3-1.
Ogonna Nnamani led the Cardi
nal with 14 kills, senior Jennifer

Harvey added 12 and senior Sara
Dukes chipped in 11 of her own.
Leahi Hall had 11 digs for the Car
dinal.
Keao Burdine had 24 kills for the
Trojans to lead the match, while
Bibiana Candelas had 20 kills. USC
libero Nicole Davis had 31 digs to
lead the match.
The Cardinal will close out its
season with games against Oregon
on Friday and Oregon State on Sat
urday. Both games will be featured
on KZSU radio, 90.1 FM, and will
start at 7 p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
