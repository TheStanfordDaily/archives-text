# Stanford falls to No. 1 USC
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Like every other team that has come
up against No. 1 Southern California this
year, the No. 7 Stanford Cardinal left
empty handed.
The Cardinal failed to complete a
sweep of the Los Angeles schools in a 3-1
loss to USC, after a win at UCLA the
night before. t
The loss dropped Stanford to a 19-6
record overall, with a 12-4 record in Pacif
ic 10 Conference play. The Women of
Troy remained undefeated on the year,
improving to 25-0 overall and 16-0 in the
Pac-10. USC had already locked up the
conference championship the night be
fore, with a win over Cal.
Uncharacteristically, Stanford was
able to win the opening game of the
match, beating USC 30-27. The game was
close at the beginning, but then Stanford
moved ahead to a 19-12 lead because of
strong serving from junior Jennifer Hucke
and digs by Leahi Hall. USC pulled back
into the match at 21-17, but the Cardinal
went on another run, bringing the score to
29-25, with junior outsider hitter Ogonna
Nnamani's kill sealing the deal at 30-27.
However, this was the last time Stan
ford controlled the match, as USC rallied
quickly to dispose of the Cardinal, win
ning the next three games in convincing
fashion.
Game two was close until USC took an
11-6 lead on a four-point run. The Trojans
never looked back, hitting over .500 on
their way to a 30-13 win. The Cardinal
only hit .048.
Stanford hung around for a while in
game three, but after another four-point
Trojan run, the Cardinal trailed 18-10.
