Amidst growing violence, tension and intolerance on an internation
al level, the Muslim world must choose between reformation, restora
tion or reinterpretation, according to a lecture given yesterday by John
Esposito, a professor of Religious and International Affairs at George
town University and the chair of Georgetown's Center for the Study of
Islam and Democracy. The talk was the inaugural lecture for the new
Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies.
The program, the result of a post-Sept. 11 surge of student demand
for courses about the Muslim world, seeks to expand Stanford's cur
riculum in Islamic Studies, though it will not grant degrees. It will
also sponsor research, academic conferences and public lectures, like
the one given by Esposito.
Esposito also spoke about a change in attitude toward Islam and the
West's growing fascination with the Muslim world.
"Thirty years ago when we talked about Islam, it was out there," he
said. "There was the Western world and there was Islam. Look at the dif
ference between then and now."
Esposito's lecture, entitled "The Future of Islam," was given in front
of a full house in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge.
He stated that there is a struggle within the Muslim world over
whether Islam should change or remain the same, specifically whether it
should go through processes such as reformation, restoration or reinter
pretation. A reformation could be similar to the Protestant Reformation,
as Esposito explained that there are always people "looking for the Mar
tin Luther of Islam." A return to an Islam practiced in earlier periods
would be a restoration of the religion, while a reinterpretation would re
quire drawing new conclusions from the Koran.
Esposito described the struggle as mostly mainstream, involving liber
als, conservatives and "every shade" in between. However, he said that
the debate is hindered by radical extremists and authoritarian regimes.
According to Esposito, many Americans know of Islam only through
