# New Islamic Studies program inaugurated

### ALBERT CHIOU 
Amidst growing violence, tension and intolerance on an internation
al level, the Muslim world must choose between reformation, restora
tion or reinterpretation, according to a lecture given yesterday by John
Esposito, a professor of Religious and International Affairs at George
town University and the chair of Georgetown's Center for the Study of
Islam and Democracy. The talk was the inaugural lecture for the new
Abbasi Program in Islamic Studies.
The program, the result of a post-Sept. 11 surge of student demand
for courses about the Muslim world, seeks to expand Stanford's cur
riculum in Islamic Studies, though it will not grant degrees. It will
also sponsor research, academic conferences and public lectures, like
the one given by Esposito.
Esposito also spoke about a change in attitude toward Islam and the
West's growing fascination with the Muslim world.
"Thirty years ago when we talked about Islam, it was out there," he
said. "There was the Western world and there was Islam. Look at the dif
ference between then and now."
Esposito's lecture, entitled "The Future of Islam," was given in front
of a full house in Tresidder Union's Oak Lounge.
He stated that there is a struggle within the Muslim world over
whether Islam should change or remain the same, specifically whether it
should go through processes such as reformation, restoration or reinter
pretation. A reformation could be similar to the Protestant Reformation,
as Esposito explained that there are always people "looking for the Mar
tin Luther of Islam." A return to an Islam practiced in earlier periods
would be a restoration of the religion, while a reinterpretation would re
quire drawing new conclusions from the Koran.
Esposito described the struggle as mostly mainstream, involving liber
als, conservatives and "every shade" in between. However, he said that
the debate is hindered by radical extremists and authoritarian regimes.
According to Esposito, many Americans know of Islam only through

reading explosive headlines
about those extremists and au
thoritarian regimes, instead of in
teracting with Muslims as neigh
bors and coworkers. Addressing
the violence in the Muslim world,
Esposito pointed out that most
Muslim countries are younger
than he is, with many of them
forming in the post World War II
era.
Esposito said that in viewing

Islam, often Americans compare
their ideals to the realities of the
Muslim world and draw conclu
sions from there.
"We have to broaden our no
tions of plurality and tolerance,"
Esposito said. "Tolerance must be
based on mutual understanding
and respect... Unless we do that,
it makes for a bleak future."
Esposito said that Stanford's
new Islamic Studies program "has a
lot of potential" to spread that kind
of tolerance.
"Stanford has an opportunity to
stand out, not just on the West
coast, but nationally. We don't

have enough of these programs."
The Abbasi Program is made
possible through the donations of
Sohaib Abbasi, a former Oracle
Corp. executive, and Lysbeth
Warren, an alumna and member of
the Humanities and Sciences
Council at Stanford. Their respec
tive gifts of $2.5 million and $2 mil
lion were matched by the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation for
a total endowment of $9 million.
The University is currently in the
process of filling one endowed
professorship and is looking to
wards creating more professor
ships within the program.
