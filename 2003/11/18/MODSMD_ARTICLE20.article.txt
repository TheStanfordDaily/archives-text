# Cross country advances to NCAAs
## 
### SEAN HOWELL STAFF WRITER 
The top-ranked men's and women's cross
country teams won their respective races at
the West Regionals in Portland, Ore. on Sat
urday, securing berths for next Monday's
NCAA Championships. The victory was the
eighth straight Regional win for the men and
the fifth straight for the women, while senior
Ian Dobson and junior Alicia Craig captured
individual titles.
The men ran away with the title, taking five
of the top six spots to finish with a mere 18
points, far fewer than second-place Cal Poly
who had 110. Junior Ryan Hall finished sec
ond and seniors Donald Sage, Adam Ten
forde and Chris Emme placed fourth, fifth
and sixth, respectively.
The team was able to put on an impressive
display in the absence of seniors Grant Robi
son, Louis Luchini and Seth Hejny, each of
whom should play a key role next week.
Craig finished far ahead of the field in the
women's race, running the 6,000 meter course
in 20:06,16 seconds ahead of runner-up Amy
Hastings of Arizona State. Stanford junior
Sara Bei finished third, while freshman
Amanda Trotter and juniors Jeane Goff and
Anita Siraki rounded out the scoring for the
Cardinal.
4 The team ran into some trouble early in the
race due to its starting position in box No. 1,
which was on the far left side of the course.
The runners were pinned against a sharp left
turn and fell into the back of the pack.
"We had to fight our way through the
crowd throughout the race," Stanford head
coach Dena Evans said. "It was a productive
exercise though, in terms of recreating the
craziness of NCAAs."
Craig began at the back of the pack but
seized the lead at the two-mile mark and shift
ed into high gear, putting the race out of
reach.
"It was a really relaxed race," Craig said.
"No one had to work very hard."
Craig will lead the team in the Nationals,
where she finished third last year for the run
ner-up Cardinal. She will continue to set the

example she has set all year for the freshmen,
especially the trio of Arianna Lambie and
twins Amanda and Katy Trotter on whom the
team has come to rely heavily.
"She is an inspiration in her workouts and
in the way she handles herself," Evans said of
Craig. "She is humble but she also has a lot of
confidence — both in training and on race
day."
Evans noted that Craig's steady, hard
working presence has had an impact on the
younger runners.
"When you're in an airplane and it gets
bumpy, you look for the flight attendant to re
assure you," Evans said. "She's like the flight
attendant for this team. If there are bumps
along the way, she always maintains a straight
face."
To Craig, the job of helping the younger
runners along is easy.
"I just try to set a good example by doing
the things I have to do," she said. "The fresh
men have lots of questions, and I try to answer
them. They are smart and they are fast run
ners. We just have to reassure them of that."
The Cardinal will also depend on Bei, the
two-time defending Pacific 10 Champion, to
guide them next week. Bei and Craig have
worked out with each other nearly every day
this season, pushing each other in training.
"They have a common interest in pursuing
the best in themselves," Evans said.
The women have known each other since
high school and became fast friends, partly be
cause they share a strong faith — both have
said that they run to glorify God.
"It's a blessing to be able to run with her,"
Craig said of her teammate.
Both women are team-oriented, but Craig
will also be chasing the individual title that
eluded her last year at Nationals.
"I just want to leave the course knowing
that I ran as hard as I could," Craig said.
Craig added that she would like to put her
self in position to win the race, but that she
knows she will face stiff competition, especial
ly from defending champion Shalane Flana
gan who attends North Carolina.
"Hopefully on that day, it works out,"
Craig said.
