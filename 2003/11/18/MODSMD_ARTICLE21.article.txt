# Card dominates on tough road trip

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team extended its winning streak to 10
games last weekend with big road victo
ries over No. 7 UC-Irvine (12-6) and No.
8 Long Beach State (12-8). With the pair
of wins, the Cardinal improved its overall
season record to 18-3 — 7-1 in league
play — and the team will enter this week
end's Big Splash showdown against Cali
fornia with a hot winning streak.
UC-Irvine and Long Beach State are
both extremely strong teams and this past
weekend's wins shows Stanford's ability
to dominate in the pool.

"These are the kind of teams that can
start playing well if they feel they have a
chance," sophomore driver Peter Varel
las said. "So we made sure that we came
out very hard right away and put the
game out of reach."
As the season for the Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation draws to a close, it is
imperative that the Cardinal turn in
strong performances against MPSF
teams. Its defeat of Cal two weeks ago
and this past weekend's sweep were criti
cal.
"These games were very important for
us for MPSF seedings," Varellas said.
"We just had to take care of business."
The Cardinal took a commanding lead

in the first period of Sunday's game
against Long Beach State, putting six
quick goals on the board. But, according
to senior utility Mike Derse, the convinc
ing win was just as much the result of
good defensive play as it was a result of
Stanford's powerful offense.
"We played very good defense and
that created a lot of opportunities for us
to score the other way on counterat
tacks," Derse said.
Long Beach State mustered three
goals in the second period and two more
in the third to bring the score to 8-5 with
3:43 in the third period. But junior driver
Tony Azevedo put the game out of reach
with two goals in the final two minutes of

the period.
Azevedo paced the Cardinal with four
goals and Derse added three, two of
which came during the six-goal run in the
first period.
Although Long Beach State scored
three more goals in the fourth period, the
Cardinal had already put the game out of
reach.
Saturday's contest was a similar dis
play of excellence by the Cardinal men.
Azevedo, Varellas and sophomore driver
Thomas Hopkins all scored three goals in
the 12-6 route of the Anteaters.
Stanford led 4-2 after the first half,
