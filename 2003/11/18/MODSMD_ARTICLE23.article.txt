# Econ text to be online and affordable
## 
### ELYSIA GRUBER 
With the price of traditional college texts ris
ing, Graduate Business School Prof. Paul Romer
and Paul Krugman of Princeton University have
come up with a new, cheaper model for studying
that combines an online learning component.
While many textbooks are already accompa
nied by software and online supplements, the new
model will offer the entire version of the text on
line at a greatly reduced price.
"I have long argued that technology should
help professors get more effort out of students,"
Romer said. "By creating a fully integrated text
book technology solution that creates incentives
for students to keep up and complete assign
ments, we can help students get the most out of
both the book and the technology."
Romer and Krugman plan to begin selling
their product next year at half the price of tradi
tional textbooks.
The cheaper price is one of the main purposes
behind the new model as the U.S. college text
book industry has turned into a $3.9 billion a year
industry, with individual textbooks selling for
more than $120 each.
Romer and Krugman are collaborating on an

introductory college text titled "Economics" that
will be sold as an 800-page hardback book for a
price of around $100. However, the full version of
the text will also be offered online for just $60.
The actual text is being written by Krugman
and his wife, Princeton economist Robin Wells,
while the online version will include teaching soft
ware and lessons developed by Romer and Aplia
Inc., his educational software company. Aplia
products are currently used in about 400 colleges
and 65,000 students around the nation. Romer
initially created Aplia's technology to help him
teach economics to students at Stanford.
Education Prof. Decker Walker, who teach
es information technology in the classroom, is
supportive of this new model for an online text
book.
"It sounds promising, since the cost of text
books has risen so fast recently," Walker said.
"And the interactive capabilities of electronic
media can add a lot that can be helpful in learning.
For instance, students don't have to look up an
swers to exercises in the back of the book. They
can have instant access to a glossary of terms and
can call up calculators, graphing programs, maps
and other tools with a click."
As college textbooks prices climb, many stu-

dents have refused to purchase books or buy them
online through foreign Web sites with cheaper
prices. Romer and Krugman hope their new
model will be more affordable and encourage stu
dents to use textbooks.
Sophomore Yfa Kretzschmar also believes
this new model will work well for students.
"The cost of textbooks has become unrea
sonable, and this would be a good way to bring
the price down," Kretzschmar said. "Also, not
only would it cost less, but you could access it
wherever you are so you don't have to carry it
around."
In the online version, assignments will be inte
grated so that professors can tell whether or not
their students are reading it, and the software will
automatically grade many of the assignments.
However, some students, such as sophomore
Erica Hanson, do not like the idea of an online
textbook.
"I would rather pay full price than have it on
line because I want to be able to carry the book
around with me and be able to highlight it," Han
son said. "It's more convenient to have all the in
formation you need for a class put together in one
book. Price doesn't matter."
