# A 						cappella groups to perform tonight in Big Sing-Off

### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
Fourteen a cappella groups
will perform tonight in the an
nual Big Sing-Off, one of the
more harmonious events be
tween Stanford and UC-
Berkeley traditionally held
during Big Game Week.
"Big Sing is a night of
good music and a rare chance
to hear most of the a cappella
groups from the two schools
together at one time/' said
senior Gautam Raghavan,
president of the Harmonics,
the group that organized the
show this year.
"It's a great chance to
show your school spirit by
cheering on and supporting
the Stanford groups."
At 7:30 p.m. in Cubberly
Auditorium, eight Berkeley
groups — Noteworthy, Men's
Octet, Golden Overtones,
Decadence, Artists in Reso
nance, Cal Jazz Choir and the
Men's and Women's Chorales
— will join six Stanford
groups: Fleet Street, Counter
point, Mendicants, Mixed
Company, Everyday People
and Harmonics.
Big Sing-Off was started in
1986 in the tradition of East
coast sing-off competitions

between rival schools. It has
since become a customary
part of Big Game Week.
"It's a lot of fun and gives
the 14 groups involved a
chance to hear each other and
show off their own talents,"
Raghavan said.
In past concerts, there has
been tension and problems
with "disrespect" according
to Raghavan.
The event is not explicitly
competitive, but some
groups will usually adjust
lyrics to make fun of the rival
school.
"A few years ago it was a
pretty negative experience
for some of the groups in
volved," Raghavan said. "It's
tough to perform while repre
senting your school to an au
dience that's half hostile to
your being there."
However, he also said that
last year's performance at
Berkeley, which included
three Stanford groups, did
not have too many problems.
"This year we have six
groups from Stanford singing,
which evens out the represen
tation — it should be a really
good show," he said.
Raghavan said he expects
350 to 400 people to attend.
The show typically sells out.
