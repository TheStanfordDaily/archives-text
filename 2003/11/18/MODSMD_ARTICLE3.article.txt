Marking healed relations between the United States and France, Jean-
David Levitte, the French Ambassador to the United States, spoke at the in
auguration of the new France-Stanford Center for Interdisciplinary Studies
last night.
Levitte expressed his contentment with the recent lowering of tensions be
tween the two countries, Levitt stated that now "is a rather happy moment
after the rather challenging months that we've been through."
The France-Stanford Center was created to encourage academic coopera
tion and closer relations between the two countries. Its stated aim is "to bridge
the disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, engineering, business and
law, addressing historical and contemporary issues from a broad range of per
spectives."
Levitte was introduced by University President John Hennessy and spoke
on "French-American Relations in a World Transformed." Levitte has served
as Adviser on the French presidential staff of Valery Giscard d'Estaing and
Jacques Chirac. A graduate of the renowned Institute for Political Science in
Paris and of the National School of Oriental Languages, Levitte has also had
a distinguished career in French foreign service.
In his speech, Levitte drew upon the historical friendship between the
United States and France, stating at one point that "[The United States]
saved us twice last century, and we will never forget. We will never for
get."
According to Levitte, positive feelings toward France from Americans
have usually stayed at around 87 percent. During the height of political ten
sions concerning the Iraq conflict, this rating dropped to 29 percent. "But the
situation is changing," explained
Levitte, as this number is currently at
66 percent.
Throughout his speech, Levitte
stressed that Europe, specifically
France, is not a challenge to the Unit
ed States but instead a partner. About
the two, Levitte stated that "We have
the same values and the same goals."
"And we have to stay together.
We've been through a political hurri
cane, and thank God the storm is
clearing," Levitte said.
Levitte also warned against possi
ble reversals of the repairing friend
ship between the United States and

France.
"Certain conservative circles say
that maybe the United Nations is
more and more of a challenge to the
United States," he said. "I think this is
a recipe for disaster in the transat
lantic community."
Hennessy concurred with
Levitte's attitude about the countries'
healing friendship, stressing the im
portance of continuing the process in
the academic world.
"Stanford cannot continue to be a
great university by standing still," he
said. He went on to say that the
France-Stanford Center "will con
tribute to better understanding" be
tween the two countries.
The political topic of the Ambas
sador's speech paralleled the opening
of the France-Stanford Center. The

center will offer internships in France
with the aim of creating closer ties be
tween Silicon Valley and the high
tech region of Sophia-Antipolis in
France.
The center will also host discus
sions on issues relevant to both coun
tries, such as the fall 2004 conference
"French and U.S. Approaches to
Islam," an issue which Levitte
touched upon in his talk. The new Is
lamic Center at Stanford was
launched last night as well.
The France-Stanford Center was
founded in partnership with the
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
which awarded a $1 million endow
ment to Stanford in order create the
center. It is the aim of the University
to not only match this amount, as was
agreed, but also to double match it,

said Sharon Long, dean of Humani
ties and Sciences.
"The fundamental goal of the cen
ter will be to foster interdisciplinary
research interests between Stanford
scholars across the departments and
schools and their French counter
parts," said Keith Baker, France-
Stanford Center director and cog
nizant dean for the humanities in
School of Humanities and Sciences.
In concluding his speech, Levitte
also expressed his approval of the re
cent establishment of the French Cau
cus by United States senators and
representatives to discuss issues relat
ing to the two countries.
"It is for me good news," Levitte
said. "The fact that Stanford has de
cided to found this center is for me
good news [as well]."
