# Project hopes to improve foster children's education
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Senior Johnny Madrid was orphaned at the age of 10 when a drunk dri
ver killed his mother in a car accident. He spent seven years in the Los An
geles foster care system, moving through a total of 19 homes. Some foster
parents treated him well, occasionally driving him 50 miles to school. But
others did not. One group of foster siblings jumped him; one foster moth
er starved him for a week.
Though Madrid's experiences in foster care were not atypical, the fact
that he went to college sets him apart from more than 90 percent of foster
youth.
At Stanford, Madrid is joined by only about 10 other foster youth
among 6,700 undergraduates. He said there is only one foster youth in the
freshman class.
Madrid wants to see those numbers grow at Stanford and at universi
ties and colleges nationwide. In pursuit of that goal, launched the Stanford
Foster Care College Project (SFCCP) at the beginning of this academic
year. Funded by a $10,000 grant from the Donald Strauss Foundation and
powered by a team of 12 students, The project aims to bring higher edu
cation within the reach of all foster youth.
"At Stanford, I had time to heal and grow and really face my issues
head on," Madrid said. "Not only that, but I had the opportunity to be
come smarter, to learn how to think better, to write and become more pro
fessional. I'd like that for all foster youth."
It is a difficult challenge. According to the California Youth Connec
tion, 70 percent of foster youth plan to attend college, but 46 percent do
not even complete high school. Of
those who do complete high school,
only 10 percent go on to college.

A different approach

SFCCP hopes to ameliorate the
situation by serving on a broad policy
level, rather than an individual basis.
The team members are researching
the barriers that face foster youth on
the road to higher education and ad
vocating policies to knock down those
barriers.

"Our way of service is different
from most groups at Stanford because
we're operating at a higher level of so
cial change," said senior Ranjana
Reddy, communications director of
SFCCP. "We're not doing one-on
one tutoring and mentoring ... in
stead, we're helping train social work
ers who can theoretically help at least
50 foster youth each."

The SFCCP team is in the research
phase of its work, compiling a literar
ture review that brings together all the
disparate information concerning ed
ucation and foster care, said SFCCP
Research Director Sara Ferry, a mas
ter's student in religious studies. After
completing the literature review, the
team will interview foster youth, so
cial workers and University adminis
trators.

Research and outreach

One of the discoveries of their re
search has been that inconsistency is a
huge barrier in foster youths' pursuits
for higher education, Ferry said. They
move from one home to another up to
five times a year or more and are often
forced to switch schools with every
move. Academic records and test
scores are lost in the shuffle, and
teaching is anything but consistent
across different schools.
The research phase of the SFCCP
project will be followed by an out
reach effort to increase awareness of
foster youth problems among college
and university administrators,
statewide legislators and social work
ers, explained Madrid.
"We want to synthesize the re

search into digestible information
that decision makers can use,"
Madrid said. "We will create work
shops and newsletters, and train our
selves to facilitate roundtable discus
sions."
"The program will have its biggest
impact by translating the information
they gather into actual intervention,"
said Katharine Barrett, a lecturer in
anthropological sciences and an ad
viser to SFCCP.

Potential for change

Barrett explained that the dual
angle of research and advocacy will
not only help identify recurring prob
lems in foster education, but help
solve them.
"Since Johnny has such good ties
with case-workers around here, he re
ally has the potential to change the
policy and situation for a lot of these
kids," she said.
SFCCP's efforts are powered by
12 students, half of whom come from
non-traditional backgrounds. Some,
like Madrid, went through the foster
care system, while others, like Ferry,
became emancipated minors when
they were as young as 15. Financial di
rector Gustavo Miguel, a senior, was
raised by a schizophrenic father on
$12,000 a year and left his home of
origin when he was 15.
Half of the team members are
also underclassmen. Madrid said he
hopes to train these members to
carry on the project in the future.

Building awareness

SFCCP wants to reach out be
yond Stanford but hopes, in the
process, to build awareness about
foster youth issues in the Stanford
community as well, Reddy said. It
plans to compile a library of academ
ic articles relevant to foster care, host
panel discussions on campus and e
mail newsletters to those who ex
press interest. Reddy is also leading
an alternative spring break trip
called "Foster Youth in the Bay
Area."
"These are very sharp and very
vigilant kids who can handle what
most adults can't handle," Barrett
said. "These are not kids who are
not in college because they lack the
ability."
