### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
English Prof. Tobias Wolff said experi
ences in his own youth helped shape the fic
tional experiences detailed in his new novel,
"Old School," in a reading last night in Kresge
Auditorium at which he read excerpts from
the novel and his memoir "This Boy's Life."
Wolff was introduced by Julie Orringer, a
former Stegner Fellow, who talked about the
numerous awards Wolff has won in addition to
how she was personally influenced by his work
and his teaching.
Wolff first read a passage about forging
prep school applications from his renowned
memoir, "This Boy's Life," to set the tone for
the setting of his new novel, which takes place
inside an all-boys boarding school
Wolff then read the first chapter of "Old
School," about a boy who competes in a school
writing competition. The winner of the compe
tition is allowed to meet a famous writer â€”
Robert Frost, Ayn Rand or Ernest Heming
way.
"Robert Frost actually did come to my
school when I was very young, but I sat in the
back and couldn't hear anything he said,"
Wolff explained.
"But now, having read all kinds of biogra-

phies and reading his works again
and again and really marinating my
self in his letters, now I know exactly
what he said," he quipped.
The humorous passages from
both works were greeted with laugh
ter from the audience. After the
reading, Wolff answered questions
about his novel and signed copies of
his new book.
Wolff said that he felt the reading
went very well and noted that he
knew many of the members in the
audience.

"In some ways, reading in front of
people you know makes you more
nervous," he said. "If I'm in Miami
and I do poorly, I can just hop on a
plane and never see them again. But
if I do poorly here, I have to look at
these people every day."
Sophomore Mark Provence, who
heard about the reading from his fic
tion writing class, said he was en
couraged by Wolff's advice for aspir
ing writers.
"Wolff gave really good advice on
writing, which is what I want to do,"
he said. "I really want to buy his new
book now, too."
Sophomore Yana Turovskaya
said that she has read Wolff's previ
ous work and liked that the event al

lowed her to hear the author's voice.
"Wolff reading his work really
brought it to life," she said. "It'd be awe
some to have more established writers
coming in and doing events like this."
Eva Ciabattoni, who is enrolled
in writing courses from the Continu
ing Studies Program, said that she
also enjoyed the reading very much.
"I love his language and honesty
and especially his sense of humor,"
she said.
Wolff is currently in the midst of a
three-week 16-stop book tour around
the country. His next stop will be Den
ver, Colo.
The reading was sponsored by the
Continuing Studies Program and the
Creative Writing Program.
