## Exploding stars, sea monkeys, and the latest in science 
### 
Big badaboom

Watch out, there is a giant star in the sky
ready to explode. Typically, massive stars
are short-lived and end their lives with rock
ing explosions known as supernovas. This
particular star is named HD 192163 and is
hardly 4.5 million years old, compared to
the 4.5 billion years of the Sun. As
tronomers believe it could explode 100,000
years from now, an insignificant time in the
cosmological scale. This is the first time hu
mans have been able to observe a potential
supernova in progress. The discovery was
made in October when Chandra, an X-ray
telescope orbiting the Earth, detected a
giant gaseous shell created by powerful
winds blowing from the star.

Don't forget the Sea Monkeys

According to the latest study by the Cen-

sus of Marine Life
(CoML), approximately
5,000 unknown fish
species and hundreds of
thousands of other forms
of marine life remain
undiscovered. The cur
rent database includes
15,300 marine fish, with
another 2,000 to 3,000 ex
pected by the time of the
final report in 2010. The

$1 billion, 10-year project was launched in
2000 as the first systematic effort to catalog
Earth's marine life. "This is the start of the
first great voyage of discovery of the 21st
Century," J. Frederick Grassle of Rutgers
University, Chair of the CoML Scientific
Committee told The Science Daily. "More
importantly, it begins the first systematic
global effort to measure our oceans' vital
signs, and guide what must be done to re
verse their decline."

Figuring out what genes do

Santa Clara-based Affymetrix was se
lected by the National Human Genome Re
search Institute to supply the technology for
the ENCODE project. This is essentially the
next step of the Human Genome Project.
Sequencing of the human genome was com
pleted in 2001, but scientists barely under
stand the data. ENCODE will discover what
genes code for what proteins. This data is re
ally the most useful information. Affymetrix
will provide gene chips (microarrays, i.e.
tools to test gene function) and new array
and scanner technology to allow analysis of
the genome at high resolutions.

Before she goes outside,
give your friend a teabag

Tea may help fight skin cancer. At least
that is the hope of researchers at the Uni
versity of Minnesota in Austin who are try
ing to produce a cream from chemicals from
green and black teas. Specifically the re
searchers found that compounds known as
polyphenols inhibited the progression of
skin cancer in live mice and in cultured skin
cells from both humans and mice. Dr Zi
gang Dong, the principal investigator, told
the American Chemical Society that "topi
cal application of certain tea polyphenols
appears to block a key process that leads to
skin cancer." Skin cancer is the most com
mon type of cancer in the United States,
with about a million new cases every year.

You say aluminum, I say aluminium

Physicists in the U.S. have produced a
super cool detector that can spot single pho
tons. Jonas Zmuidzinas and colleagues at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory and CalTech
made the detector from a single layer of alu
minum measuring 2 angstroms. At tempera
tures of 1 Kelvin (that is negative 272 Cel
sius!) they obtained a resistance-free current
flow, also known as superconduction. That
happened because at really low temperatures
atoms become ordered and electrons can
flow essentially unimpaired. By measuring
changes with a microwave probe they were
able to calculate the energies of individual
photons. Comparable devices currently can
only detect samples of 40 or more photons.

It's not the size of the dam, but the motion
of the river

Electricity from water? Sure, humans
have erected hydro dams all around the
globe. But they have tremendous social,
economic and environmental cost. Engi
neers in Canada though have developed a
better way. Larry Kostiuk and colleagues at
the University of Alberta pumped water
through microchannels in a glass disk. The
channel ends were connected together by a
wire, allowing current to flow. Each hole
only produced a nanoamp (a 100 W bulb re
quires at least a thousand times more ener
gy) but energy output can be increased by
forcing the water through numerous paral
lel channels.
