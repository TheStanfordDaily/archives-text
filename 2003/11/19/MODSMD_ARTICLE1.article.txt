### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Edward Said was a man of critical genius, according to Comparative Lit
erature Prof. David Palumbo-Liu at a talk last night in the History building.
At the event, which was held in memory of the recently deceased Palestin
ian-American professor, keynote speaker Dr. Ghada Karmi argued Said's
ideas should be put to work in resolving the current Israel-Palestine conflict.
The talk was sponsored by the Coalition for Justice, the Muslim Student
Awareness Network, Outreach to Asian Immigrant Students and the Stan
ford Egyptian Association, and was attended by approximately 100 people,
including many non-students.
Said, born in Palestine, moved to England in 1948 following the blood
shed at Deir Yassen. Educated at Harvard and Princeton, he went on to
teach at Columbia University and serve as president of the Modern Lan
guage Association. He was a visiting fellow at Stanford from 1975 to 1976
and a noted political activist for the Palestinian cause, serving on the Pales
tine National Conference from 1977 to 1991.
Khalil Barhoum, the coordinator of African and Middle Eastern lan
guages and literatures at Stanford, served as master of ceremonies. He was
a close friend of Said's, and opened
the evening by describing Said's con
victions.
"His [beliefs] were those of a man
who cherished justice over power,
conscience over pain, and universal
human rights over xenophobic and
colloquial interests," Barhoum said.
"Needless to say, individuals like him
are quite unique, and for that we are
quite grateful."
Barhoum said that the death of
Said came as a shock, though Said
had been battling leukemia for over a
decade.
"Deep down we somehow imag
ined, perhaps believed, that Edward
Said was virtually indestructible," he
said. "It's as if we never contemplat
ed the moment when this giant of a
man would finally fall and simply
vanish from our lives once and for
all."
Karmi's talk, entitled "In the
Footsteps of Edward Said: The Fu
ture of Palestine / Israel," stressed
the need for Said's legacy not to be
forgotten in the midst of a turbu
lent political time. Karmi, a re
search fellow at Exeter University
in England and author, cited Said's
influence of literary criticism as a
professor and Columbia Universi
ty, but said his final importance lay
elsewhere.
"In that [academic] sense, the
whole world could claim him," she
said. "But it was the Palestinian peo
ple who claimed him first and fore

most. He derived his passion, his an
imation ... from being Palestinian,
and in a very particular way, he was
informed by the notion of disposses
sion."
Karmi said, though, that she felt
some were happy to see Said go.
"In the midst of this grief that I
felt, I also found myself thinking that
there would be one group of people
who would be celebrating Edward's
demise, and that would be the Zion
ists," she said. "Because the Zionists
... really fear losing the battle for
hearts and minds. That is the real
weapon that the Palestinians should
have against the Zionists, and of
course Edward had it in enormous
measure."
Karmi praised the effect that Said
had in changing Western attitudes
about the Palestinian situation.
"He was the voice of the Pales
tinians in the West, and his effect was
so tremendous [that] he reversed
perceptions in the West, which was
an enormous achievement," she said.
"Edward's contributions as far as
Palestinians were concerned [was
that] he acted as a bridge, a cultural
bridge, between the Palestinians and
the West on one hand, and as a
bridge between [fragmented com
munities of] Palestinians on the
other."
Karmi said that Israel has op
pressed the Palestinian people and
yet seems immune to international
censure.
"The Holocaust, Jewish persecu
tion, means that the Jews deserved a
refuge," she said, paraphrasing a jus
tification for the creation of the state
of Israel. "And if you criticize any

thing the Jews do, you're [seen as]
anti-Semitic."
Karmi said that the Israelis have
unjustly taken the Palestinian home
land and that their actions have cre
ated a situation untenable in the long
term.
"You can't have a situation in
which this kind of repression and this
kind of violence continues," she said.
After explaining that she feels Is
raeli settlement has made indepen
dent Israeli and Palestinian states im
possible, Karmi said that she sup
ports a one-state solution to the Is
rael-Palestinian conflict. She said
that the preservation of Said's ideals
is of utmost importance in achieving
this end.
"So what's going to happen,
where are we going with this?" she
asked. "Edward Said was very well
aware that the fundamental prob
lem in Israel-Palestine is in the in
compatibility of narrative. What
you have are two people who claim
this same land, and they claim it on
a basis that is clearly incompati
ble."
Referencing the explosive po
litical situation in regards to the
Israel-Palestine conflict, Karmi
said that the only remaining op
tion for both peoples was one of
tolerance.
"Let us say, let us live together,"
she said. "Let us join ... [in] a secular
democracy in which we don't have
people who are classified by race or
ethnic basis or color.
"That seems to be the only way
forward," she continued. "The idea
of ethnic states, exclusivist states, re
ligious states, is an idea that belongs

to the past. There is no room for that
now or in the future."
Prior to Karmi's speech, Palum
bo-Liu gave a talk entitled "The Crit
ical World of Edward Said." He fo
cused on the way Said changed liter
ary criticism.
"He revolutionized literary theo
ry by politicizing it in a very ground
ed, very empiricist way," Palumbo-
Liu said.
Palumbo-Liu praised Said's work
in reaction to his book, "Orientalism."
"It's a consciousness of political
culture as discrimination," he said.
"In the face of such hegemonic prac
tices, Said sees precisely the opening
for such critique."
The manner in which Said em
powered critical thinking and ques
tioning of the dominant ideology was
groundbreaking, according to
Palumbo-Liu.
"It is the humanizing process that
both names and critiques the dehu
manizing process and seeks to re
store humanity to those who are de
nied it," he said. "The idea is that
human beings are not closed recepta
cles but instruments through which
other things flow.
"For me, this particular idea of in
strumentality is one that Edward
Said fulfilled better than anyone else,
and it is a huge part of his legacy that
he inspired others to do so as well,"
Palumbo-Liu continued.
Barhoum, after thanking Provost
John Etchemendy for attending the
memorial, closed the talk with an
epigram for Said: "A great Palestin
ian, a distinguished American and,
above all, a remarkable human
being."
