# Gaieties Goes Down Tonight
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
"It's all about how Cal sucks," says Alexis
"Texas" Boozer, director of this year's Gaieties
performance. But at last night's final dress re
hearsal, there was more than enough sucking to
go around. The first scene after intermission fea
tures the character of Leland Stanford Jr., along
with his "boy toy" and a quartet of chip 'n' dale
dancers, getting a groove on.
"I'm alive," shouts Stanford, after an interpre
tative dance number between penicillin and ty
phoid fever. The sucking followed, and since this
is a family newspaper, details will be left to your
imagination.
This year's Gaieties, "G3: Rise of the Wee
nies," opens tonight at Memorial Auditorium.
Some of the masterminds behind the show sat
down last night to explain concepts of the perfor
mance.
"The word 'extravaganza' has to go in there,"
says Lauren Kramer, president of the Ram's
Head Theatrical Society, which puts on the show.
To make sure that her point is taken, she adds that
"Gaieties is a musical extravaganza pep rally be
fore the Big Game."
"We should use 'fun-fest," adds Nick Allen, an
additional director, throwing in another adjective
to try to convey the full sense of "G3."
Boozer, however, was unsure about that de
scription.
"I don't know," she says, "that sounds very
'kiddie-fair' to me." She thinks a moment. "It's
fun. We've got a lot of raunchy stuff in the show.
Lots of nudity. Bad language."
A tradition for more than 100 years, Gaieties
has become a campus-wide event, with even the
Senior Class abstaining from their traditional
Pub Night in favor of a Gaieties pre-party. The
wet pre-party will take place before Thursday's
show, from 6 to 8 p.m., in the courtyard next to

Memorial Auditorium.
This year, students can get their fill of raunchy
stuff, nudity, bad language and phallusosity in
performances tonight, Thursday and Friday. The
Friday show has already sold-out, but tickets are
still available for the other nights. To boost atten
dance, tonight's show will cost only $7, down from
the typical $9. Alcohol actually has been an issue
at the show in the past, although not in any way
that would attract the attention of a dry adminis
tration.
"The show was really, really excellent last year
but a lot of people couldn't sit through it," Booz
er says, commenting on last year's three-hour run
time. "Mainly on senior night, because a lot of
people come drunk."
This year, the production crew curtailed the
running time in order to keep those drunkards in
their seats.
"We've cut it down to 60, 70 percent of [last
year's] time," Allen says.
In addition to a shorter length, attendees will be
treated to guest appearances from University Pres
ident John Hennessy, Dean of Admissions Robin
Mamlet and Dean of Freshmen and Transfer Stu
dents Lythcott-Haines, all playing themselves.
"They sort of rev up the crowd," Boozer says.
"Hennessy gets to shoot a gun. We gave him a Nerf
gun with four Nerf balls in it and I was like, 'You
know, just crank it and shoot it,' thinking he'd do it
once. He shot our cast member with all four. He
just kept going. It was great."
After getting a sneak peak of one post-inter
mission scene, this reporter can confirm that there
is, indeed, plenty of raunchy humor in "G3," in
cluding an abundance of anal and oral sex jokes.
And there is a barb or two left to attack the newly
crafted restrictions of alcohol in freshmen dorms,
because, as one stage actors asks: "What kind of
an out-of-touch administration would ever think
that banning alcohol in freshman dorms would
solve problems on campus?"

"Cal sucks, and so do we!" But only in a humorous, sexual sense, of course. In fact, "oral" humor is a favorite "physical" gag in this year's Gaieties performance,
"G3: Rise of the Weenies." The show opens tonight at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium and runs through Friday night.
