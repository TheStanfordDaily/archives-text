# Are maintenance crews born in the USA?

GHey Answer Boy, What are
those spray-painted arrows
on the road that say USA?
Do we have über-patriotic
street maintenance workers?
—Alvin Chin, sophomore
A Thanks for the question, Mr.
/\ Chin. From time to time, on
/ | long, cerebral walks down
JL M. Stanford side streets while
pondering on Plato or waxing philosoph
ical on ontological empiricism (as we An
swer People tend to do in our spare time),
I have noticed these jingoistic conun
drums marring the pavement. Whether m

front of Tresidder or next to the law
school, there they are: large, red "USA"

markings spray paint
ed on the ground. Has
a juvenile John
Ashcroft moved to the
neighborhood? I ask
myself. Perhaps Fox
News demagogue Bill
O'Reilly has started a
youth club in the
area? But no the
answer is far less
malevolent.

"USA" in the sense that we are dis
cussing is an acronym for "Under
ground Service Alert" and is not only a
street marking but a governmental or

ganization. According to California
law, any construction crew, developer
or wayward treasure-seeker planning
to dig a hole must contact USA with an
excavation outline before beginning.
The idea is to prevent the digger from
striking electrical cables, water lines or
oil carriers (unless you're in Alaska, in
which case Mr. Bush would look quite
fondly on any oil-strikers).
The organization's California coun
terpart came into existence in 1976 after
a construction crew working on Venice
Boulevard in Southern California hit a
petroleum pipeline. The ensuing explo
sion razed a city block and killed nine
people. Hundreds of boardwalk
rollerbladers, glass-walkers, chainsaw

eaters and generic freaks wept.
Apart from notifying the govern
ment before beginning, aspiring excava
tors must mark their work location with
the bold USA you see spray painted on
the ground. Color is important. Red, for
instance, means electric; blue is, pre
dictably enough, water; and a Swamp
Thing green means sewer work is going
on. Have more fun with construction
crew coding colors at http://www.us

This week's question was real. Please
deliver me from the unavoidable self
emasculation that goes along with ask
ing myself questions. Send me your
queries at barretts@stanford.edu.
