## Early-admissions policy change good 
### 
This fall, Stanford loosened its early-ad
missions process from biding early deci
sion to non-binding single-choice early
action. As a result, early applications are
up 62 percent this year. The University's shift
seems to have benefited potential students by
opening up their options and giving Stanford a

wider pool of appli
cants from which to se
lect its entering class.
Under the old sys
tem, high school stu
dents could apply early
to Stanford and, if ad
mitted, were obligated
to attend. The new sys
tem is a bit more flexi
ble in that students ad
mitted under the early
action program don't
have any obligation to
attend if admitted. The
only catch is that Stan
ford's early-action
process is single
choice, meaning that a
student who applies to
Stanford early cannot
apply early to another
university.

This loosening of Stanford's admissions
guidelines particularly helps those students who
may not have applied to Stanford early based on
financial considerations. According to national
studies, fewer minority students apply to colleges
early because of financial considerations. Under
the old plan, students had to promise to attend
Stanford if admitted â€” financial aid package
undisclosed. The new system allows students
who are admitted early to compare Stanford's fi
nancial aid offer to offers from other schools and
make an informed decision about which college
to attend.
In line with Stanford, Yale has loosened its
early-admission application system, and applica
tions there are up 42 percent. Harvard, on the
other hand, has forced its applicants to be more
judicious in early admission by altering its pro
gram to single-choice early action, just like Stan-

ford and Yale. Before, students could apply to
Harvard early as well as any other school with a
similar early action policy. Early applications to
Harvard are down 47 percent this year.
Selecting a college is a daunting task, and to
ask seniors in high school to promise to attend a
school, even if the purpose of the strict policy is

to ensure a committed
pool of applicants, is
an unfair request. We
applaud the Universi
ty for putting stu
dents' best interests
first and reducing the
sometimes over
whelming anxiety as
sociated with applying
to college. Even if the
binding early decision
process helps schools
with their enrollment
statistics and ensures
a high-quality enter
ing class, Stanford's
change in policy
shows the school has
fulfilled a more im
portant commitment
to students and their
well being.

Stanford will still attract top-notch students
under the single-choice early-action policy:
Now, the University will simply have more stu
dents to choose from in the early applicant
pool. By the same token, students don't have to
sign four years of their lives away in November
of their senior year. The new system creates ac
countability for both students and admissions
offices while also making the application pro
cess less stressful.
With early applications up so dramatically at
Stanford, competition may be tougher for an
early spot in the entering class. But this trade-off
is well worth it considering the flexibility the new
program offers to all applicants, particularly
those who will depend on financial aid to attend
college. Other schools with binding early-deci
sion systems would do well to follow Stanford's
lead.

"The new system is a bit more
flexible in that students admit
ted under the early-action pro
gram don't have any obliga
tion to attend if admitted.
