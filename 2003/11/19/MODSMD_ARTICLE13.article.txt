# Maples needs an extreme makeover
## 
### 
Beginning in March, a $3O million
renovation of Maples Pavilion will
commence, and it is far past time.
The home of Cardinal basketball
has turned into a dingy cave that smells of
sweat and concessions. The men's basketball
coach, Mike Montgomery, recently de
scribed it as a stadium from "the Dark
Ages."
Compared to many other school's basket
ball facilities, Stanford's auditorium is out
dated, unattractive and generally depress
ing. This condition is unacceptable, especial
ly in light of how good the Stanford basket
ball teams have performed in recent years.
The Cardinal should play in a place that is
both functional and comparable to peer in
stitutions.
These planned renovations are a great
start to improve the feeling of Maples. Most
of the bleachers will be replaced with more
modern seating, a covered area will be added

to the outside of the Pavilion that will protect
those inside from rain and, most exciting,
there will be a new video-display scoreboard
that will bring Maples into the modern era.
While the renovations are certainly a good
idea, this round of changes will not fix all of
Maples' problems. The arena is still very
small, especially compared to the number of
students who want to attend the games. Each
year, the "Sixth Man Club" has made the
games a colorful and lively experience. Stu
dent fans must compete with each other to
gain admittance to games, despite paying
more than $65 for season tickets.
Stanford should make it a long-term goal
to build a larger basketball arena, so that the
prominence and ability of the basketball
teams can be matched by the place where
they compete. The basketball facilities
should be able to match those from any other
school; something that Maples Pavilion just
can't do in its current state.
