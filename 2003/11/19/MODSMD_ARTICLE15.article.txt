Cops should apprehend bicyclists
who disobey laws

The following is in regard to the
editorial "Cops should focus on just
one biker" (Nov. 18). While the ap
prehension of the serial groper must
be a priority for the Department of
Public Safety, to say that those who
work there should not enforce bicy
cle laws is ridiculous. Bicyclists who
do not obey the rules of the road en
danger not only their own lives but
also the lives and livelihoods of oth
ers. This happens numerous times
each day on campus.

As the recent RIAA lawsuits in
dicate, going after a few individuals
who break the law can greatly re
duce the total number of individuals
who continue to break the law.
Hopefully, such a strategy will result
in fewer bicycle-related accidents.
The claim that bicycle lanes,
roads and sidewalks are poorly de
fined is simply false for most areas on
campus that are accessible to all mo
torists and the University has done a
great job with the reconstructed
Serra Street. In general, bicyclists
should stay off the sidewalks so that
they do not injure or interfere with
pedestrians. While it is understand
able that some bicyclists will fear for
their safety when sharing the road
with cars, the majority of students
who ride their bicycles on sidewalks
do so without helmets. Thus, since
these students obviously do not ride
on the sidewalk for their own safety,
they should get off the sidewalk.
Bicyclists who disobey traffic
laws also endanger motorists since
collisions with bicyclists are likely to
lead to, at a minimum, higher insur
ance rates. Pedestrians walk slowly
enough that they can easily be seen
prior to entering the crosswalk of a
four-way stop intersection. Runners
know that this is not the case if they
approach the same intersection and
so most of them slow down or stop
prior to entering the crosswalk.
However, more often than not, stu
dents riding their bicycles do not
slow down at all when approaching
intersections. This is especially prob
lematic at night at places such as the
intersection between Campus Drive
and Escondido Road.
Thus, it is more appropriate to say

that cops should focus on bikers who
endanger lives. This is what they are
doing.

Safeway letter offered sound
advice

I want to thank Mariaelena Gon
zalez for her thoughtful letter in sup
port of striking grocery workers,
("Please think before crossing the
Safeway picket line," Nov. 18) and to
encourage students to follow her ad
vice. As many readers probably
know, grocery workers in Southern
California belonging to the
UFCW â€”United Food and Com
mercial Workers Union are on
strike. These workers are on strike to
save their healthcare benefits, which
Safeway effectively wants to elimi
nate. In their proposed contract,
Safeway could charge the workers
up to $95 dollars in health care pre
miums per week, an enormous bur
den when the workers are only earn
ing an average of $19,000 dollars per
year. Most of these employees are
not high school students earning
some extra money, they are parents
working hard to support their fami
lies.
Safeway argues that in these lean
economic times, it is being forced to
slash benefits in order to remain
competitive. In reality, Safeway
earned a profit of $3.1 billion in 2002.
Furthermore, the company pro
duces 39 percent more profit per
worker than it did 10 years ago. The
grocery workers deserve their
healthcare benefits, and many of
their families would go uncovered
without them. Safeway is a major
employer, and if it succeeds in cut
ting the benefits of the workers, it
sets a precedent that will be disas
trous for other service employees
throughout the nation. We should
support the Safeway workers in then
struggle and respect the picket lines
at Safeway.

A.J. was right on

In response to the letter by

Michael Deeringer, ("AJ. needs to
decide what he wants," Nov. 18).
who was responding to the column
by A.J. Magnuson, I have a few
things to say. First off, anyone who
took Mr. Magnuson seriously needs
to go straight to the dictionary and
look up the word "sarcasm." Just as
he likened Everyday People to "a
two-headed, neutered-Smurf"
(which I assume they are not since
they appear to be neither blue nor
only five apples tall) he was being
sarcastic about the outrageous prices
of the goods being sold in Tresidder
Express. Thus, any chimpanzee can
see that Mr. Magnuson was just
using some good humor not the
ice cream bars to make a point.
That being that many of the renova
tions are stupid. Do we need more
Peet's Coffee?
To truly improve the student
union the place should have been
jazzed up with things to try and get
students to spend time there. Since
the administration is so bent on
keeping alcohol out of students
hands, they have done little to offer
alternatives. This was an opportuni
ty to put some real forms of enter
tainment that might just have been
able to allow students to do some
thing other than get drunk, like play
pool in an atmosphere other than
dorm lounges which suck. I mean
how much fun can you have with
people studying right there throwing
dirty, jealous looks as you pull a two
rail bank shot to sink the 8 ball?
But I suppose A.J. and all the
other students and I who feel a little
disgruntled at the lack of social activ
ities on campus should fill out com
ment cards to Gene Awakuni to get
our opinions across. Comment cards
seemed to work when the students
were trying to get the janitorial staffs
raises, huh?
Finally, back to Michael
Deeringer's apparent lack of a sense
of humor. Seriously, do you really
expect to take a column called
"Death and Destruction" seriously?
Give me, Mr. Magnuson and the rest
of the campus a break and lighten up
because it ain't no thing but a chick
en wing on a string. Schnoogins!
