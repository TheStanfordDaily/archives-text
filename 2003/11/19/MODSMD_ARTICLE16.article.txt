# NOTES FROM DOWN UNDER
## When crocodiles attack! 
### 
Our group stared longingly
at the surroundings: Lush
green mangroves and
rainforest palms lined the
edges of the white sands and the
warm ocean crashed gently on the
shores. For all of its beauty, we
didn't dare dive into its waters. It
was a temptation too great to bear,
but yellow warning sings of the
deadly box jellyfish prevented us
from poking a toe into the salty
shores. It was pretty hard to believe
that a little bubble of white gooey
cell mass could inflict so much pain
on a human being.
I know this might seem hard to
relate to at the moment, given that
you're probably on campus study
ing for a round of midterms or
heading to lecture, but keep in
mind that we're virtually isolated
right now and I haven't exactly
kept up with Stanford news. We're
staying in a tiny residential com
munity located right next to the
middle of Nowhere, Australia and
keeping in touch with the world is
rather difficult, given that Internet
access is restricted to a single, dev
astatingly slow computer in a con
venience store.

We're in the tropics now, under
the sweltering heat and heavy,
humid air, studying the unique envi
ronment of the rainforest, and we
can't swim in the beaches. Oh well,
we comforted ourselves, at least we
could play in the beautiful Daintree
river as we did our work.

Alas, that was not fated to hap
pen either. Crocodiles, four to eight
meters long, with huge snapping
jaws and scaly skin, claim this river
as a home. The first day, before we
were to step on the boats and start
our data collection, looking at every
thing from water quality to tree
species, we were given a lecture
about the health and safety issues of
the area. Along with the usual "be
sure to drink plenty of water and use
lots and lots of sunscreen," (ahh,
suddenly our profs have taken the
nagging role of Mom) there was a
new twist:

"You guys will most certainly see
crocodiles along the river," warned
one of our professors. "This is their
breeding season, and they'll be par
ticularly protective, so watch out."

We thought he was jesting.
C'mon, this is a Stanford program.
They wouldn't dare place us in dan
ger ... right? We'd all been to a croc

farm (yes, here in
Australia, some
crazy psychos ac
tually farm
crocodiles), so
we'd seen the
power of their
gleaming yellow
teeth, but we
never figured
we'd actually see
them without

two fences be
tween us and their giant scaly bod
ies.

The laughter and jokes stopped
when the groups actually began to
see huge crocodiles sneakily creep
ing along the river, dangerously
close to their work sites. The scariest
part, however, was the crocodiles
that you didn't see, the ones that
could jump on the boat and chomp
off an arm or a leg at any second.
As we collected water samples
one day, the river was eerily silent.
We glanced around uneasily. The
scene was exactly like a horror
movie; all we were missing was the
ominous music that you hear right
before the first victim is gruesomely
snapped in half. Random splashes
came out of the water every once in
a while, causing us to freeze and stop
whatever we were doing. It didn't
help that our work required us to dip
buckets into the water, continuously
tempting the carnivores. After a few
hours of work, we were hungry and
ready to eat lunch, but we really
didn't want to be lunch.
"The key to our survival," said
our tutor Simon in his charming
Australian accent, "is that whenever
you see them, you shouldn't actually
call 'em 'crocs.' Just call them 'float
ing logs.' Calling them 'crocs' will
jinx us and make them come out."
Our group didn't actually see too
many "floating logs" that day we
merely heard them swimming
around threateningly. But when we
came back, we heard plenty of fear
provoking stories. A bunch of stu
dents climbed up slippery mangrove
roots to avoid disturbing crocodile
nests. Smart plan, you might say.

Perhaps at some point in your life
you've heard that if you're ever
chased by a crocodile, you should
climb up a tree. One vital point to re
member: Make sure your tree is
nowhere near their nesting spot.
Crocodiles apparently have the abil
ity to slow down their metabolism to
the point where they can stay in the
same spot guarding their nest for 90
days. They won't move even to get
food. So when you decide you want
to get some grub at some point in
this three month period and you
climb down that tree, you'll become
a little snappity snack for these giant
guys.
Of course, we were given detailed
safety instructions. For example, if
by any chance you do find that a
crocodile is about to grab a firm hold
of your flesh, you can quickly shove
your arm down its throat, hitting the
sensitive flap inside their bodies that
keeps them from drowning. I'm sure
I'll remember to keep that one in
mind when the crucial moment ar
rives. The trick is to do it before the
crocodile grabs a hold of you, sub
merging you under water and
drowning you to death. Hmm ... on
second thought, I think I'd probably
climb that tree and learn to subsist
on leaves.
They also tell you not to panic.
Panic? Why would anyone panic
when a six-meter crocodile named
"Gummy" is about to devour you as
you're trying to do field work and
you're working in the mud 100 me
ters away from their nesting site? I
wish we could say we were fearless,
but everyone was certainly a little
jumpy as we made our way through
the river.
Given that we've had quite a bit
of lecture, there's no doubt that we'd
rather be working in the field than
sitting in a classroom, but I think our
profs are trying to teach us a lesson
about the "dangers" of real science.
We're certainly up for it and hey,
if someone gets eaten, we'll have
one fewer roommate at our next ac
commodation!
