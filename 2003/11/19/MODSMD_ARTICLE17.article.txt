# OP-ED
## Creating a better Big Game culture 
### ROBERT BERDAHL JOHN HENNESSY 
On Nov. 22, 2003, the Cal Bears
and Stanford Cardinal will play the
106 th annual Big Game at Stanford
Stadium. Big Game is a tradition
laden event, and our spirited rivalry
has become one of the most storied
in all of collegiate football.
We ask that you do your part in
maintaining Big Game as an enjoy
able experience for all. Unfortunate
ly, some of the Big Games held in the
past several years have been dimin
ished by the behavior of a few peo
ple. Their actions have sullied this
tradition, resulting in property dam
age and injuries. Such behavior is

unfortunate and demeans the strong
athletic and academic heritage Cal
and Stanford share.
We ask that all members of our
respective communities refrain from
engaging in mean-spirited "pranks,"
excessive drinking and other activi
ties that may draw law enforcement,
security personnel and resources
away from responding to more
pressing matters. Please discourage
it among others. Those attending the
Big Game, who include families with
small children and elderly alumni,
should not have to fear for their safe
ty. Let's instead again create a Big
Game culture based on lively com
petition, team loyalty and fun.
Be assured that fans who engage

in incidents of field trespass, physical
assault and / or property damage will
be ejected from the stadium. Stu
dents found responsible for these
types of activities will face disci
plinary action at their respective in
stitutions; such action may include
suspension or dismissal.
Please respect more than a centu
ry of Big Game tradition and cele
brate your school spirit, pride and
sportsmanship in a safe, positive and
friendly manner. Enjoy the game!
