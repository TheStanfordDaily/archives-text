## Big Game comes with big price tag 
### MICHAEL ZAKARAS 
Ah, the Big Game. So much tradi
tion. So much hype. So much fun. And
another opportunity for the Universi
ty to make its students feel like part of
the family.
That's right, they're giving us the
red-carpet treatment again. Believe it
or not, but having a Stanford Student
ID and $52 will get you into the Big
Game with no questions asked.
Which is exactly how it would
work if you flashed a University of
Tehran student ID or a dog-eared
copy of Playboy. It doesn't matter that
you live on the Farm, that you'll prob
ably be biking to the game from your
dorm or that the starting quarterback
is in your class and the punter is an old
friend. It doesn't matter that your par
ents took out a second and third mort
gage on their house to pay for you to
get that great Stanford experience.
At the ticket window, you get
treated no better than a student at
tending Cal. No, wait actually,
you're better off if you're attending
Cal. That gets you a ticket for only
$5O, not $52. (Check their Web site;
it's true.)
I'm aware of the student "All Axe

ess" pass ($62) that the University
pushes as a stellar deal. For just a few
dollars more than your Big Game tick
et, you can get into most other sporting
events on campus (except, conve
niently, men's basketball). But hiding
behind the pass dodges the more im
portant question: Why should the Big
Game ticket be so expensive? Given
the cheap admission to most athletic
events, if a student Big Game ticket
existed at a more reasonable price (say
$l5), then the vaunted "All Axe-ess"
pass loses much of its luster.
Thousands of students want to go to
the Big Game. It isn't just a football
game. It's part of being at Stanford. It's
the Stanford Band, the Axe, Gaieties,
"The Play" (from Big Game in 1982).
If you go to one game all year, this is the
one. You feel guilty if you don't go.
But that's just it: The University
knows this, and knows you'll cave in
and go no matter how hard it is on
your wallet. They're taking advantage
of your sympathies.
Here are some naive questions:
Why shouldn't Stanford students get
big discounts for special sporting
events? Why shouldn't the University
want to make these experiences easily
available to them? Why should we be

charged as much as Stanford alums
who hardly notice a $52 expense?
And shouldn't the University care
more about packing the Big Game
with a cheering student body than in
making a few extra thousand bucks?
Some of my friends were thinking
of watching the game on TV, but it's
not being televised. So they'll either
find a way to pay the full-price, or
they'll wait to see a Big Game when
they come back to the Farm years
from now, full of nostalgic memories
about the time they couldn't quite af
ford to go.
I don't know if my roommates and
I will make it. But even if we're not
there yelling our heads off, we'll be lis
tening to the play-by-play and hoping
like hell that we kick their butts all
over field.

ford athletics about the expensive
tickets, he was told that he could buy
a $5O Cal ticket but then couldn't sit
in the Stanford student section. E
