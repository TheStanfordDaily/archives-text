# OP-ED
## Zimbardo is the real Dr. Phil 
### PATRICK MATTTMORE 
Sigmund Freud introduced the
concept of free association. The tech
nique is of limited clinical value but
does work well as a tool to prime
one's imagination. For example,
think of your image of Dr. Phil. Like
ly, words and phrases such as TV per
sonality, expert in human function
ing, slightly stout, cheerful-sounding
fellow with facial hair, doctor, etc.,
will come to mind. I would add things
like past President of the American
Psychological Association (APA),
conducted groundbreaking research
on the situational effects of young
men placed in a simulated prison,
leading scientific authority on the top
ics of why humans commit evil acts
and shyness. The Dr. Phil you were
probably originally thinking of is Phil
McGraw, who was consulted by
Oprah during her "Mad Cow" trial,
became famous and is now an expert
on everything from diet, to relation
ships, to life strategies. According to
his most recent best-selling book he is
one of the world's foremost experts in
the field of human functioning. He is
an expert because, well, he says he is.
Dr. Phil offers homespun, bootstrap
advice that sounds good and cannot
be scientifically tested.
The Dr. Phil I was describing is
Phil Zimbardo, who has taught psy
chology at Stanford for the last 40
years and is retiring this year. His in
troductory psychology videotapes
have been seen by thousands of high
school and college students. His col- *
lege introductory class routinely has
over a thousand students and fills up
within 15 minutes of being offered
electronically. Dr. Zimbardo's ex
perimental studies of deindividua
tion (loss of one's self-awareness
and of personal identity particularly
in situations that foster anonymity)
would, for example, predict and ex
plain the boorish behavior of base
ball fans in the recent playoffs. Zim
bardo is an expert in the field of
human behavior because he has sci
entifically studied it; Dr. McGraw is
an expert because we and the media
have made him one. It is important
to distinguish between the two.
Dr. Laura Schlesinger (Dr.

Laura) is another media-created ex
pert on relationships and a host of
other topics. According to her 1996
best-selling book "How Could You
Do That?" she reaches 20 million lis
teners a week on the radio. Her
books contain no footnotes, end
notes or references to scientific stud
ies. Apparently what she hears from
listeners and just plain knows is
enough. On the topic of evil, she
writes that there are good and bad
people a scenario my son found
comforting when he was five years
old while playing with Ninja turtles.
The moralistic world of Dr. Laura
brooks little gray. Never mind that
the research of Dr. Zimbardo and
others supports the fact that life cir
cumstances could make nearly any
of us behave immorally.
Zimbardo has been an inspira
tion to many beyond Stanford's
walls. When a Web site was set up
recently to honor his retirement,
over 750 tributes were sent to him
from over 25 countries. I taught high
school psychology for 10 years and
my teaching and my students, learn
ing benefited in a number of ways
from Zimbardo. When I ap
proached the board of the Western
Psychological Association three
years ago requesting that a session
for high school teachers be included
in the program, Zimbardo not only
made it happen but he co-chaired
the session the next year. After my
students made presentations at the
Stanford Undergraduate Psycholo
gy Conference in 2001, Zimbardo
had his publisher send me a class set
of introductory psychology text
books, since the ones I was using
were 17 years old. What I most ap
preciate about Zimbardo, though, is
his incredible enthusiasm for psy
chology and the ability to convey
that to students. Several years ago I
had heard that Phil would be giving
a lecture on shyness at Holy Names
College in Oakland. I asked my stu
dents if any of them would like to at
tend. One girl meekly raised her
hand. I met Shirley and her father
the night of Zimbardo's speech and
after his talk I introduced Shirley to
Zimbardo. I watched their conversa
tion from a distance and it was a

magical moment for me. I felt that
her life had been transformed by
that meeting. I ran into Shirley at
San Francisco State University sev
eral weeks ago where she is a senior,
majoring in psychology and apply
ing to graduate schools in the field.
No doubt, she will take with her into
her career in psychology a piece of
Dr. Phil Zimbardo. One of the trib
utes to Zimbardo on the Web site
came from the current president of
the American Psychological Associ
ation, Diane Halpern. Diane wrote
that even as she was writing her let
ter and thinking about Zimbardo,
she was crying because of the pow
erful effect he had had on her life.
He has touched, and continues to
touch, many of us in that way.
I often wish that the other psy
chologists of the world would take
their cues from Dr. Zimbardo. He
has worked hard not only to learn
things about human behavior but to
get that message out to the rest of us.
Unfortunately, ivory tower is not
just a cliche. Too often professors
are content to write merely for their
peers. The topics they write about
become progressively more obscure
and their intended target audience
becomes narrower. That's how one
gets published in the most presti
gious of journals. Many of those psy
chologists have it backward and that
is why the Phil McGraws and Laura
Schlesingers of the world predomi
nate. The real psychologists need to
first popularize their findings, and
then go to the journals. Tackle the
big stuff and tell us what you
learned. After all, you have the most
interesting topic in the world to re
search and write aboutâ€” human
behavior. Somehow, I think Phil
Zimbardo knows that.
