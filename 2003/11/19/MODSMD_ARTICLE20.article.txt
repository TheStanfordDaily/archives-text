## Bret gets sappy with his maple tree memories 
### 
I've never run more in my life than I run now. At
the same time, I've never played fewer sports
than I play now. One by one, the hustle and
bustle of life, of seeking bigger and better
things, of running from work to lunch, from the
shower to the gym, has slowly faded athletics out of
my schedule. Daily basketball and tennis practices,
gone. Golf and Swimming practices, gone. The
races home from the bus stop with my brother, the
recess contests of monkey in the middle, the
Wednesday twilights of running slants with Dad,
they're all gone.
Recently, running en route to the next daily com
mitment, I was reminded of the visually brilliant fall
seasons I grew up with in New England. And I'm re
minded of the maple trees, which always had those
vibrant shades of red, that always found a way to
watch over me whenever there was a game to be
played or a competition to be won, no matter how big
or small. And recently, it's been those little things
I've found myself lingering on, the little things I never
really understood why I remembered until now.

I was 5 years old the first time I
went skiing. I had a pair of neon
yellow and purple Rossignols with
lightning bolts, poles up to my
shoulders, a navy wool hat down to
my nose and a devious little grin
worthy of a whole roll of film. My
instructor, Chrissie, was an angel
sent to me in a headband, Ray-
Bans and black stretch pants that
must've been painted on. How fast

I progressed from wedging, to paralleling, to tailing
Chrissie, all the while at eye level with the back of
those stretchpants. The chairlift couldn't have been
rustier, the day more overcast, the oaks and maples
more geriatric and barren. The dirt-washed snow on
that 200-foot vertical manmade slope couldn't have
been any grungier, but that grin stayed on my face
until the instant those lifts stopped running. I loved
women and I loved skiing.
Endless kindergarten afternoons floated by pac
ing through knee-high outfield grass amongst
buzzing Japanese beetles and bumble bees. I
dreamed about the G.I. Joes I might get for Christ
mas in eight months, while awaiting a hit to center
field for the Royals. And there were always those
pleasant maples, my babysitters, that would never
tire of me crunching through the grass after balls with
the "Hippopotamus Rock" song stuck in my head. In
those early years, my self-creased mesh hat firmly
snapped on over homecut bangs, my sweatpants cov
ered in burrs and spores and I was always picturing
the M&M sundaes the Royals were sure to go out for
after the game.
These are all sensations that rush back so vividly
every time I am reminded of those steadfast maples:
The burning that filled my lungs while spinning, juk
ing and hurdling to the end of the field and back on
my way to winning the gym class capture the flag
championship; the snow spray burrowing into my
cheeks and pinched eyelids in icy bullets as I'd pass
my parents every school snowday; the puncture of
size five cleats into semi-frozen turf; and the sight of
my own breath on an early fall Saturday at a town
youth soccer match.
And the pond my brother and I grew up on.
Closed to the rest of the world by the maples that had
us convinced we'd be maple syrup farmers if we ever
grew up Where warm breezes and waning sum
mer sunbeams ushered in each new day and filtered
out each evening. Mornings would rush by. We'd get
dressed in our Bermuda white beachhats, neon or
ange inflatable floaties and our faces covered in SPF
30 warpaint. And we'd try to dig to China faster than
the other.
I remember barefoot races back to the porch over
the prickly sundried crabgrass. And there were the
daily watermelon seed spitting competitions, where
most of the ammunition ended up down in our bellies
from the contagious laughter we'd fill our chubby
cheeks with each midday.
Peanut Butter sandwiches were always left unfin
ished, our meals cut short by the patter of our feet
and shrieks of re-energized delight from grape juice
stained hps on our race back out to the beach, where
we would begin an afternoon of diving for salaman
ders and hunting for frogs we'd label "swimmer
swimmers and hopper-hoppers."
Through the reeds we'd lurk, and how we'd smash
the water with cupped hands in often failing efforts to
snag our camouflaged friends. We'd stomp with frus
trated delight when they'd slip through our tightest
grasps into the bottom of the pond. With each catch
we'd raise our treasures above our heads in victory
cries: "Hoppy-hopper! Hoppy-hopper!"
The best day always came down to who had to
scrape the most sand out from under his fingernails
and dump the most dirt out of his swimsuit into the
shower at the end of the afternoon. No one ever lost.
Sometimes, in midst of a dragging day, I want to
stop running and run away. I picture all the old pho
tos I've had memorized in my head for years and I
turn back to all those old yesterdays.
I want to sit under one of my old maple friends and
be there again on the summer All-Star team, in the
deep end of the town pool with my sharks and min
nows buddies, in my bed at 5 a.m. on one of those
cherished snowday mornings. And I feel the joy, the
energetic sparkle in my own excited eyes, the eager
ness to explore a world of sport and games naive to
life: and I am alive; I am living. Worries fade into a
triviality, a figment I'll care about someday if I ever
grow up, ahd weighing the heaps of sand in my tug
boat speedoes and counting the ice cream dribbles
down my Royals jersey take top priority again.
