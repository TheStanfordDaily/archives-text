# Top teams show dominance
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a weekend of dominance in the
Pacific 10 Conference, as the Pac-10's hot
teams solidified their postseason possibil
ities with blowout victories.

California ran roughshod over visiting
Washington, 54-7, No. 2 Southern Cali
fornia went to Arizona and came away
with a 45-0 shutout and Oregon State out
classed Stanford in a record-setting 43-3
victory. No. 8 Washington State held off
visiting Arizona State, 34-19, and Oregon
asserted itself at home against UCLA,
winning 31-13.
The results make for some interesting
Rivalry Week matchups on Saturday, as
both Oregon (7-4, 4-3 Pac-10) and Ore
gon State (7-3, 4-2) enter the Civil War
firing on all cylinders, while Washington
will look to save its season in the Apple
Cup game against Washington State (9-2,
6-1). Stanford will try to get back on track
for Big Game against Cal, and UCLA (6-
5, 4-3) hopes to rebound against rival
USC (9-1,5-1) this weekend.
Stanford (4-5, 2-5), Cal (6-6, 4-3) and
Washington (5-6, 3-4) must all win to
keep their bowl hopes alive; the Huskies
also need to win to avoid their first losing
season in more than 20 years.
Cal's big win was spurred by a school
record 729 total yards on offense. Aaron
Rodgers threw for a career-high 348
yards and three scores, while J.J. Arring
ton ran for 185 yards on just 14 carries in

Running back J.R. Lemon and the Stanford football team struggled against Oregon State, falling 43-3. OSU was just one of several
top teams to post dominating victories. USC defeated Arizona 45-0, but still managed to fall in the BCS Standings.
