### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a weekend of dominance in the
Pacific 10 Conference, as the Pac-10's hot
teams solidified their postseason possibil
ities with blowout victories.

California ran roughshod over visiting
Washington, 54-7, No. 2 Southern Cali
fornia went to Arizona and came away
with a 45-0 shutout and Oregon State out
classed Stanford in a record-setting 43-3
victory. No. 8 Washington State held off
visiting Arizona State, 34-19, and Oregon
asserted itself at home against UCLA,
winning 31-13.
The results make for some interesting
Rivalry Week matchups on Saturday, as
both Oregon (7-4, 4-3 Pac-10) and Ore
gon State (7-3, 4-2) enter the Civil War
firing on all cylinders, while Washington
will look to save its season in the Apple
Cup game against Washington State (9-2,
6-1). Stanford will try to get back on track
for Big Game against Cal, and UCLA (6-
5, 4-3) hopes to rebound against rival
USC (9-1,5-1) this weekend.
Stanford (4-5, 2-5), Cal (6-6, 4-3) and
Washington (5-6, 3-4) must all win to
keep their bowl hopes alive; the Huskies
also need to win to avoid their first losing
season in more than 20 years.
Cal's big win was spurred by a school
record 729 total yards on offense. Aaron
Rodgers threw for a career-high 348
yards and three scores, while J.J. Arring

at home against the Huskies in 28
years.
The Huskies' Cody Pickett man
aged 225 yards through the air, but

led the squad with 72 yards rushing,

Washington chose to stick with the
pass.
Third- and fourth-string Cal run
ning backs Marcus O'Keith and
Michael Porter fared as well as Ar
rington did, combining for 180 yards

USC came into its game against
the Wildcats as 29-point favorites,
but they covered that spread in the
first half alone. Mike Williams, just a
sophomore, set the Trojan's career
record for touchdown receptions
(26) by catching three scoring
strikes from Matt Leinart, all in the

first half. Leinart passed for 296
yards and four touchdowns without
an interception, and Williams had
11 catches for 157 yards despite sit
ting out the last 20 minutes of the
game.
Arizona (2-9,1-6) couldn't move
the ball against the Trojans' vaunted
defense, as Mike Bell who
rushed for 222 yards in Arizona's
win over Washington last week
managed just 30 yards on 14 carries.
True freshman Kris Heavner's sea
son-long struggles were intensified
by USC's strong secondary, which
intercepted him three times and
held him to 129 yards passing.
Oregon State rolled up the third

history (663 yards) against Stanford,
and recorded its largest-ever victory
against the Cardinal, 43-3, in rainy

ran for 148 and former walk-on
Mike Hass came just five yards shy

ceiving on the day.
Stanford's Chris Lewis and Trent
Edwards combined to complete 16-
of-42 passes for 145 yards; the team
totaled minus-12 rushing yards as it

posted the second-lowest total
yardage in school history (133).
The Cougars, with Matt Kegel
still battling injuries, turned again
to Josh Swogger, who finally
threw his first collegiate touch
down pass, helping to lead Wash
ington State over the visiting Sun
Devils (4-7, 1-6). Swogger com
pleted 14-of-20 passes for 207
yards and no interceptions, while
Jonathan Smith ran for 60 yards
and a touchdown.
Arizona State's Cornell Canidate
rushed 21 times for 64 yards and a
score and Andrew Walter threw for
262 yards as the Sun Devils had a
hard time keeping up with the
Cougars, who blocked a punt and
ran an interception back for a touch
down.
Drew Olson threw 49 passes for
the Bruins but couldn't stretch the
field, totaling just 249 yards, a touch
down and an interception. Tyler
Ebell gained 68 yards rushing on six
carries, but Maurice Drew gained
just 32 yards on 13 carries as the
Bruins struggled to sustain drives.
Justin Medlock missed two field
goals and the Bruins were booed as
they left the field at halftime.
