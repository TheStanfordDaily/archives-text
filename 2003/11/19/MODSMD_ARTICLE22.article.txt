# Barnhart nominated for Hermann
## 
### 
Although the women's soccer season came to a disap
pointing end last Saturday, the stellar individual play of

redshirt junior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart has not gone
unnoticed.
The 2002 All-American has been named one of 15 fi
nalists for the M.A.C. Hermann Trophy, which goes to
the most outstanding player of the year.
Barnhart has tallied 63 saves and seven shutouts this
season for a 0.78 goals allowed average. She currently
holds the Cardinal career mark for GAA (.417).
The junior is the only keeper still in the running for
what is widely regarded as the most prestigious award in
collegiate soccer.
Other notable semi-finalists are Cat Reddick, a North
Carolina defender who was a starter for the U.S. Nation

al Team in this fall's World Cup and senior forward
Veronica Zepeda, who essentially ended Stanford's sea
son with her assist in the opening round of NCAA tour
nament play.
Three finalists will be announced at the College Cup
in North Carolina.

Candice Wiggins heads quality recruiting class

Tara VanDerveer and the Stanford women's basket
ball team signed three new recruits to join the freshman
class in 2004.
Highlighting the class is Candice Wiggins, who will
also compete for John Dunning and the volleyball team.
Wiggins, a guard from La Jolla, Calif., is ranked
among the top-10 prospects by the prep recruiting ser
vices.
She averaged a double-double of 27.3 points and 11.6

rebounds in her high school career to date, while leading
her school to two Division V State Championships.
Cissy Pierce and Christy Titchenal round out the class.
Pierce is a guard from Heritage High School in Colorado
and averaged 15.1 points per game over her high school
career. Titchenal is a forward who attends Ursuline High
School in Sonoma, Calif. She averaged 12.3 points and
7.1 rebounds per game.
"They make our perimeter that much deeper and
more competitive. All three of these players give you dif
ferent dimensions than anyone else on our team," Van-
Derveer told The San Francisco Chronicle.
