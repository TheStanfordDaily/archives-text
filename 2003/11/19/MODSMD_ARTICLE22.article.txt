# Barnhart nominated for Hermann
## 
### 
Although the women's soccer season came to a disap
pointing end last Saturday, the stellar individual play of

redshirt junior goalkeeper Nicole Barnhart has not gone
unnoticed.
The 2002 All-American has been named one of 15 fi
nalists for the M.A.C. Hermann Trophy, which goes to
the most outstanding player of the year.
Barnhart has tallied 63 saves and seven shutouts this
season for a 0.78 goals allowed average. She currently
holds the Cardinal career mark for GAA (.417).
The junior is the only keeper still in the running for
what is widely regarded as the most prestigious award in
collegiate soccer.
Other notable semi-finalists are Cat Reddick, a North
Carolina defender who was a starter for the U.S. Nation

al Team in this fall's World Cup and senior forward
Veronica Zepeda, who essentially ended Stanford's sea
son with her assist in the opening round of NCAA tour
nament play.
Three finalists will be announced at the College Cup
in North Carolina.
