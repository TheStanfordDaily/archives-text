# Club sports short on funding
## 
### DAVID HERBERT 
Stanford has by far the largest sports endowment of
any school in the country, but members of some non-var
sity sports teams say their teams are still underfunded.
According to a recent four-month survey by
Bloomberg News, Stanford's sports endowment totals
$270 million, more than twice the amount of the nearest
competitor, Notre Dame. This fund, however, has not
translated into more money for club sports.
This year, 18 club teams were allotted approximately
$170,000, and an additional $30,000 was given to teams
that make it to their respective national championships,
according to Club Sports Director Sherry Posthumus.
Two-thirds of funding for club sports are covered by
fundraising and membership dues, and some sports, like
men's rugby, are also supported by large alumni dona
tions. ASSU funds cover about one-third of the sports'

need, Posthumus said.
But for some club teams, that figure is even lower. The
men's squash team has an annual budget of $20,000 to
$25,000, much of it spent on coaching. Yet the team only
receives $5,000 about 20 percent of its budget from
the ASSU club sports fund, said senior Paul Valiant,
head of fundraising for the team.
On the other hand, Notre Dame has an athletic en
dowment of $l3O million, less than half Stanford's. But
according to Director of Intramural and Club Sports
Rich O'Leary, the university meets 60 percent to 70 per
cent of club teams' financial needs.
At Stanford, to make up the difference, the squash
squad and other club teams must find other sources of in
come. The Stanford Fund is a popular source of capital,
but there are some strings attached.
One drawback to using the Stanford Fund is that re
cipients are limited in the ways they can spend the

money. The squash team's budget is mostly comprised of
coaching and travel costs, but under the stipulations of
the Stanford Fund, coaching expenses are not allowable
expenses and most travel costs are not covered, putting
even more pressure on the team to raise money form out
side sources.
Also, fundraising can be time-consuming; to raise $3O
from the Stanford Fund, students must hand-write two
letters to donors.
"Club Sports does an admirable job trying to fund our
teams and provide us with support in many ways. [But]
the team has to take on administrative and fundraising
duties even during the season when we our busy playing
our sport," said senior and captain of the squash team
Rich Sherwood.
Aside from monetary help, the athletic department

Redshirt junior Nicole Barnhart was named one of 15 semifinalists for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy, which goes to the most outstanding collegiate soccer player.

does provide the 18 club teams that
fall under its jurisdiction with other
help.
"The athletic department sup
ports the clubs by giving them an of
fice at Roble, an administrator, ac
cess to the athletic offices for devel
opment and marketing, special hours
and a strength coach at the varsity
weight room," Posthumus said.
As far as University support goes,
squash is one of the luckier teams.
The women's club soccer team has
more than 50 members, but received
just $1,420 from the ASSU. That
money barely covers the registration
fee for the league the team competes
in, not to mention equipment, uni
form, referee and travel expenses.

"Our limited funding from the
ASSU prevents us from pursuing
more intercollegiate matches and
higher-level competition," said
sophomore Andrea Burbank, fi
nancial officer for the team. "The
Penn State women's club soccer
team, for example, travels to tour
naments in Ohio, Virginia, New Jer
sey, Alabama and California, but
we are limited to playing in a local
women's league and occasionally
against nearby colleges that we can
travel to by car. With more Univer
sity funding, we could greatly im
prove the caliber of the competition
we face."
The women's club soccer team is
actually not recognized by the Uni
versity as an official club sport be
cause Stanford doesn't allow club
teams for sports in which a varsity
team already exists. Of the 85 club
teams at Stanford, only 18 fall under
the jurisdiction of the athletic de

partment.
That status hinders the women's
club soccer team's fundraising ef
forts. Since the team is not part of the
club sports program, it is not eligible
to receive money from the Stanford
Fund.
"It is extremely difficult to find
opportunities for fundraising since
we aren't recognized as an official
club sport here," said sophomore
Corie Geballe.
The athletic department main
tains the facilities of the 18 teams
that it supports, but for the women's
soccer team, this help is less readily
available.
"University backing with field
space would help. For instance, if
there was a lined field with goals we
could use to host other schools, it
would help legitimize our efforts at
becoming a more competitive club
sport," said sophomore Laura
Adams.

Bloomberg News, Stanford's sports endowment totals
$270 million, more than twice the amount of the nearest
competitor, Notre Dame. This fund, however, has not
translated into more money for club sports.
This year, 18 club teams were allotted approximately
$170,000, and an additional $30,000 was given to teams
that make it to their respective national championships,
according to Club Sports Director Sherry Posthumus.
Two-thirds of funding for club sports are covered by
fundraising and membership dues, and some sports, like
men's rugby, are also supported by large alumni dona
tions. ASSU funds cover about one-third of the sports'

need, Posthumus said.
But for some club teams, that figure is even lower. The
men's squash team has an annual budget of $20,000 to
$25,000, much of it spent on coaching. Yet the team only
receives $5,000 about 20 percent of its budget from
the ASSU club sports fund, said senior Paul Valiant,
head of fundraising for the team.
On the other hand, Notre Dame has an athletic en
dowment of $l3O million, less than half Stanford's. But
according to Director of Intramural and Club Sports
Rich O'Leary, the university meets 60 percent to 70 per
cent of club teams' financial needs.
At Stanford, to make up the difference, the squash
squad and other club teams must find other sources of in
come. The Stanford Fund is a popular source of capital,
but there are some strings attached.
One drawback to using the Stanford Fund is that re
cipients are limited in the ways they can spend the

money. The squash team's budget is mostly comprised of
coaching and travel costs, but under the stipulations of
the Stanford Fund, coaching expenses are not allowable
expenses and most travel costs are not covered, putting
even more pressure on the team to raise money form out
side sources.
Also, fundraising can be time-consuming; to raise $3O
from the Stanford Fund, students must hand-write two
letters to donors.
"Club Sports does an admirable job trying to fund our
teams and provide us with support in many ways. [But]
the team has to take on administrative and fundraising
duties even during the season when we our busy playing
our sport," said senior and captain of the squash team
Rich Sherwood.
Aside from monetary help, the athletic department

Redshirt junior Nicole Barnhart was named one of 15 semifinalists for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy, which goes to the most outstanding collegiate soccer player.
Barnhart is the only goalkeeper to make the semifinals. She recorded seven shutouts and 63 saves for the Cardinal this season, while posting a 0.78 GAA.
does provide the 18 club teams that
fall under its jurisdiction with other
help.
"The athletic department sup
ports the clubs by giving them an of
fice at Roble, an administrator, ac
cess to the athletic offices for devel
opment and marketing, special hours
and a strength coach at the varsity
weight room," Posthumus said.
As far as University support goes,
squash is one of the luckier teams.
The women's club soccer team has
more than 50 members, but received
just $1,420 from the ASSU. That
money barely covers the registration
fee for the league the team competes
in, not to mention equipment, uni
form, referee and travel expenses.

"Our limited funding from the
ASSU prevents us from pursuing
more intercollegiate matches and
higher-level competition," said
sophomore Andrea Burbank, fi
nancial officer for the team. "The
Penn State women's club soccer
team, for example, travels to tour
naments in Ohio, Virginia, New Jer
sey, Alabama and California, but
we are limited to playing in a local
women's league and occasionally
against nearby colleges that we can
travel to by car. With more Univer
sity funding, we could greatly im
prove the caliber of the competition
we face."
The women's club soccer team is
actually not recognized by the Uni
versity as an official club sport be
cause Stanford doesn't allow club
teams for sports in which a varsity
team already exists. Of the 85 club
teams at Stanford, only 18 fall under
the jurisdiction of the athletic de

partment.
That status hinders the women's
club soccer team's fundraising ef
forts. Since the team is not part of the
club sports program, it is not eligible
to receive money from the Stanford
Fund.
"It is extremely difficult to find
opportunities for fundraising since
we aren't recognized as an official
club sport here," said sophomore
Corie Geballe.
The athletic department main
tains the facilities of the 18 teams
that it supports, but for the women's
soccer team, this help is less readily
available.
"University backing with field
space would help. For instance, if
there was a lined field with goals we
could use to host other schools, it
would help legitimize our efforts at
becoming a more competitive club
sport," said sophomore Laura
Adams.
