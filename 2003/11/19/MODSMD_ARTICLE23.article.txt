# Club sports short on funding

Stanford has by far the largest sports endowment of
any school in the country, but members of some non-var
sity sports teams say their teams are still underfunded.
According to a recent four-month survey by
Bloomberg News, Stanford's sports endowment totals
$270 million, more than twice the amount of the nearest
competitor, Notre Dame. This fund, however, has not
translated into more money for club sports.
This year, 18 club teams were allotted approximately
$170,000, and an additional $30,000 was given to teams
that make it to their respective national championships,
according to Club Sports Director Sherry Posthumus.
Two-thirds of funding for club sports are covered by
fundraising and membership dues, and some sports, like
men's rugby, are also supported by large alumni dona
tions. ASSU funds cover about one-third of the sports'

need, Posthumus said.
But for some club teams, that figure is even lower. The
men's squash team has an annual budget of $20,000 to
$25,000, much of it spent on coaching. Yet the team only
receives $5,000 about 20 percent of its budget from
the ASSU club sports fund, said senior Paul Valiant,
head of fundraising for the team.
On the other hand, Notre Dame has an athletic en
dowment of $l3O million, less than half Stanford's. But
according to Director of Intramural and Club Sports
Rich O'Leary, the university meets 60 percent to 70 per
cent of club teams' financial needs.
At Stanford, to make up the difference, the squash
squad and other club teams must find other sources of in
come. The Stanford Fund is a popular source of capital,
but there are some strings attached.
One drawback to using the Stanford Fund is that re
cipients are limited in the ways they can spend the

money. The squash team's budget is mostly comprised of
coaching and travel costs, but under the stipulations of
the Stanford Fund, coaching expenses are not allowable
expenses and most travel costs are not covered, putting
even more pressure on the team to raise money form out
side sources.
Also, fundraising can be time-consuming; to raise $3O
from the Stanford Fund, students must hand-write two
letters to donors.
"Club Sports does an admirable job trying to fund our
teams and provide us with support in many ways. [But]
the team has to take on administrative and fundraising
duties even during the season when we our busy playing
our sport," said senior and captain of the squash team
Rich Sherwood.

Redshirt junior Nicole Barnhart was named one of 15 semifinalists for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy, which goes to the most outstanding collegiate soccer player.
Barnhart is the only goalkeeper to make the semifinals. She recorded seven shutouts and 63 saves for the Cardinal this season, while posting a 0.78 GAA.
