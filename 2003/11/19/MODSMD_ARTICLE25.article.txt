## War-themed party at UT investigated 
### ANGELA GRANT DAILY TEXAN 
(U-WIRE) The University of Texas-
Austin's Interfraternity Council Judicial Board
will begin to investigate next week as to whether
an Iraq war-themed Zeta Psi party violated the
code of conduct of the IFC Constitution.
The fraternity has come under fire for a
"Bombs Over Baghdad" themed party held Satur
day. Party-goers dressed in camouflage, and the
house was decorated with sandbags, model air
planes and a "landing strip" painted on plywood,
said Zeta Psi Vice President Gabriel de la Garza.
Flyers for the party distributed on-campus
showed photographs of a crying child spattered in
blood, a man clutching a child's lifeless body and a
mutilated dead man. The caption read, "Come
party, and celebrate what we stand for."
De la Garza, a senior majoring in biology, said
the fraternity had nothing to do with the flyers. He
said a student came to the fraternity house claim
ing he created the flyers and distributed them after
seeing a billboard in the fraternity house's front

yard advertising the party. The student was not
available for comment Monday.
"In my opinion, it was mostly an anti-war
flyer," said Zeta Psi President Thomas Madaelil.
"They made it, because they thought the intent of
the party theme was to promote innocent people
dying, which was not our intent at all."
TTie party was meant to support the troops, not
to promote killing innocent people, said Madaelil,
an electrical engineering senior.
The flyer itself illustrates how the theme could
be interpreted in a negative way, said EFC Adviser
Brian Perry.
Perry contacted Madaelil with concerns about
the party's theme after receiving complaints about
the flyer and the billboard, which said "Bombs
Over Baghdad" and showed Saddam Hussein on
an ace of diamonds playing card.
"I definitely thought it was completely inap
propriate and insensitive, considering things are
still going on in Iraq," Perry said.
Madaelil removed the billboard, but the frater
nity went ahead with the party Saturday.
"I agree that the party's theme was insensitive

and done in poor taste," Madaelil said. "I can't
argue with [the judicial board] saying that our
theme was insensitive."
The IFC Judicial Board will investigate next
week whether Zeta Psi violated the EFC code of
conduct by intentionally engaging in a form of ha
rassment. The board will also consider whether
Zeta Psi's actions will reflect poorly on the greek
community, Perry said.
Mario Villa, sociology senior and president of
Phi Delta Theta fraternity, said he's afraid the
party could damage the reputation of UT fraterni
ties.
"People who are non-greek here just see letters
and assume it's everybody," Villa said. "Don't put
all groups or all chapters in the category of this
kind of behavior because there's 22 or 23 chapters
in the IFC itself, and everybody's different."
If the judicial board finds Zeta Psi in violation
of the code of conduct, the punishment could in
clude probation, a fine and community service.
"We do apologize for having offended people,"
Madaelil said. "We'll try to think about something
to do to make it up."
