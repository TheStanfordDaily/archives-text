# NYC may require test of college voters
## 
### BRADLEY HOPE WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS 
(U-WIRE) Students who hail from outside
New York City may be denied the right to vote in
elections here if a new proposal is passed by the
city's Board of Elections Tuesday.
Civil rights organizations and students an
nounced their opposition to the New York City
Board of Election's proposal yesterday at a press
conference on the steps of City Hall.
The proposal would require college students
living in a residence hall or off-campus to fill out a
six-question form to determine whether they are
eligible to vote in the city. The questionnaire asks
where a student's driver's license was obtained
and where students reside in the summer, among
other questions. Under current voting rules, a cit
izen may choose to vote in New York City if he or
she has been a city resident for at least 30 days and
does not claim the right to vote elsewhere.
"Students, like all citizens, have a right to
vote," said Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of
the New York Civil Liberties Union. "The ques
tionnaire is one designed to do mischief.

"Five out of six of the questions lead a regis
trant to be found ineligible," Eisenberg said.
Under current laws, no additional procedures
are necessary for college students registering to
vote as long as they list their New York City ad
dress as their principal residence.
"We should be helping students to vote, not
hindering them," said Rachel Leon, executive di
rector for Common Cause/NY, a non-partisan
lobby group.
Four students stood on the steps behind the
speakers with signs reading "BOE: Don't Silence
Us," "Keep Students Voting" and "Students are
NYers too." They tied black ribbons over their
mouths to represent the potential of the propos
al to silence their votes here.
Representatives from the Brennan Center for
Justice at the NYU School of Law and the
League of Women Voters of the City of New
York also spoke yesterday.
The registration rate for students is less than
50 percent, said Neil Rosenstein, a representative
of the New York Public Interest Research
Group, a politically neutral reform organization.
Of 18- to 24-year-olds who register, approxi

mately 60 to 70 percent vote in presidential elec
tions, he said.
"It's more crucial that students vote now -
they are already moving polls off campus," said
Cail Casserly, a junior at Hunter College.
Rosenstein said that while many students use
their parents' address as their primary address
because of their mobility during the school year,
they still live in New York City for the majority of
the year.
"Just because I get mail there doesn't mean I
shouldn't be voting [here]," said Camile Rivera,
a student at Queens College, referring to her par
ents' home.
Eisenberg said the proposal singles out stu
dents but ignores military personnel or any other
group of people who are similarly mobile in the
course of a year.
If the proposal is passed, the New York Civil
Liberties Union will litigate on the grounds that
it violates the 24th and 26th amendments, he said.
"It's very interesting that this is happening
right before a major presidential election," said
Katharyn Ross, a campus organizer at the Pratt
Institute.
