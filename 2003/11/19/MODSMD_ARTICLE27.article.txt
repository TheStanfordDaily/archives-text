# Duke's free flu vaccines prove popular with students
## 
### DAVIS WARD THE CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) It's that time of the year again. The
leaves are dropping, basketball is starting and the flu sea
son has begun.
To encourage more students to guard themselves
against the influenza virus, Duke's division of student
health will offer free nasal flu vaccinations to students
this week.
"We're happy to provide the [FluMist vaccine] for
free to the students as an alternative to flu shots," said
Chairman of Community and Family Medicine Dr.
Lloyd Michener. Michener approved the decision along
with Director of Student Health Dr. Bill Christmas and
Dr. Peter Kussin, director of medical staff operations for
Duke Hospital.
Flu Mist has been available to students since this past
summer but each vaccination cost them $5O. A Duke
University Medical Center decision last Friday altered
student health's policy on the vaccination, making Flu-

Mist free for all students. Faculty and staff, however, will
still have to pay the $5O for the vaccine.
"We're not using Flu Mist for employee occupational
health. We offer the flu shot," said Dr. George Jackson,
director of occupational and environmental health.
"[FluMist] is a bit of a novelty vaccine, and caters to a
small portion of the population highly averse to injec
tion. [The Flu Mist vaccine] is an attenuated live virus,
and the huge percentage of Duke's workers who are in
health care could potentially spread it. That's the last
thing we need."

As Jackson suggested, there are more concerns with
the Flu Mist vaccination than the standard flu shot. Un
like the Flu Mist vaccine, the standard flu shot will not in
fect the person taking it with the flu.
Though both the nasal and shot vaccinations protect
against the same strain of flu that the Centers for Disease
Control have predicted to be the most prevalent this flu
season, Flu Mist contains a live strain of the virus, whereas
standard flu shots contain an inactivated influenza virus,
Associate Director of Student Health Jean Hanson said.

Doug Petkus, the spokesperson for Wyeth pharma
ceutical company, which manufactures Flu Mist, did ac
knowledge the possible effects of the vaccine.
"'Attenuated' means it's a weakened virus, and it is
theoretically possible that someone [who took the Flu-
Mist vaccine] could get some mild symptoms of the flu,
which would be similar to those of a common cold."
Flu Mist can only be given to people who don't have
fevers, colds or any other condition which could result in
a weakened immune system. People getting the vaccine
should also stay clear of anyone with immuno-supressed
conditions. Flu Mist is also only FDA-approved for peo
ple ages five to 49.
The vaccine, however, is not without its supporters.
"One of the barriers to immunization has been the
needle and Flu Mist does offer someone a needle-less ap
proach to flu prevention," said Petkus. "The vaccine's in
tended purpose is to prevent influenza, which it does."
The chances of getting the flu from the vaccination
are insignificant, Hanson said.
The chances of getting the flu without vaccination,

however, are not insignificant.
"I'm definitely glad I got the shot," said sophomore
T.J. Morales. "Last year I had the flu twice, and it really
affected my academic and extracurricular schedule."
Each flu season is unique, but it is estimated that ap
proximately 10 to 20 percent of U.S. residents get the flu
and an average of 114,000 persons are hospitalized for
flu-related complications. Although the length of the flu
season varies, the worst months for the flu are usually
January and February.
"You can't predict how many people will get [the
flu]," said Christmas, who came up with the idea to offer
Flu Mist to students for free. "The risk factors are being
at an institution in closed indoor spaces like lecture halls,
residence halls, parties, tents or things like sharing uten
sils and containers."
The Flu Mist vaccination to be held Thursday will be
the second mass vaccination of the year. Student Health
held its annual flu shot vaccination in the Bryan Center
Oct. 31, where Hanson estimates that 1,000 students
were vaccinated at this year's Halloween immunization.
