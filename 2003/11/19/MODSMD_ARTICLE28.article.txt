# Sweet teeth could lead to alcoholism
## 
### CALEY MEALS THE DAILY CARDINAL 
(U-WIRE) According to a
recent report in the November
issue of "Alcoholism: Clinical and
Experimental Research," a candy
bar today could mean alcohol
abuse tomorrow. Researchers at
the Mount Sinai School of Medi
cine in New York found that hav
ing a sweet tooth precedes alco
holism and may serve as a marker
for the genetic risk for developing
the disease.
In a prepared statement to the
press, study author Alexei B. Kam
pov-Polevoy said, "Previous re
search has established that in mam
mals such as mice, rats and mon
keys, the preference for and con
sumption of sweet fluids are
strongly correlated with voluntary
alcohol intake."
Kampov-Polevoy is an assistant
professor of psychiatry at Mount
Sinai and decided to create the
study upon reviewing his previous
research.
In looking over his notes on past
studies, Kampov-Polevoy noticed
that people who are alcoholics gen
erally preferred sweeter fluids than
their non-alcoholic peers. But it
wasn't clear whether the prefer
ence for sweet fluids was a result of
a long history of drinking or
whether this sweet tooth preceded
alcoholism, so he decided to set up
a study to find out.
In the study, Kampov-Polevoy
studied 163 social drinkers who
were divided into two groups. The
81 people in the first group had a
paternal history of alcoholism,
while the 82 people in the second
group did not. All the study partic
ipants were then asked to rate a se
ries of sucrose solutions for intensi
ty of sweetness and palatability.

The researchers found that peo
ple with a paternal history of alco
holism were 2.5 times more likely
to enjoy the sweet solution than the
people in the second group,
demonstrating a link between
sweet consumption and alco
holism.
"Craving alcohol is a complex
psychological phenomenon, but is
based on biology within the re
ward pathway in the central ner
vous system," said Dr. Mark Pe
terson, medical director of a pri
vate clinic in Georgia and consul
tant for AlcoholMD.com. Ac
cording to Peterson, the correla
tion between sweets and alcohol is
a result of similar biological reac
tions to both substances. Since
both sweets and alcohol increase
seratonin production in the brain,
thereby stimulating pleasure, it is
only natural that people with a
sweet tooth are more likely to be
come alcoholics.
A May 2002 study at Harvard
Medical School titled "Alcohol
Abuse and Dependence among
U.S. College Students" found that
6 percent of college students met
the criteria for a diagnosis of alco
hol dependence (also referred to as
alcoholism), and 31 percent met
the clinical criteria for alcohol
abuse.
"Heavy drinking is most often
regarded as a behavior problem
only," said John R. Knight, princi
pal investigator of the study and an
assistant professor of pediatrics at
the Harvard Medical School.
"Many students who drink heavily
are at high risk of true mental dis
orders such as alcohol abuse and
dependence. Alcohol dependence
especially may become a lifelong
illness, and more should be done to
recognize and help students at
risk."
