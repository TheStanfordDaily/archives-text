The new Law School residence, set to house
roughly 670 students in a group of five- and six
story buildings, may result in the widening of
Campus Drive to four lanes near Mayfield, the

tage and the construction of two new parking
garages, according to Law School representa

students, faculty and other interested parties.

back with his ideas of what Stanford needed," he

said. "As it got bigger and bigger, the Law School
said, 'We didn't need this many rooms.'"
The donor will be funding a significant
amount of the $ll5 million cost of the building,
according to Brucato. The rest will be funded in
debt, which is currently limited by the University
to no more than $24 million.
Brucato explained that the donor seeks to im

ideas about how the residence should be built.
"He does not think Stanford knows how to
build for the long life of a building," Brucato
said. "He would like to show Stanford how to
construct a building that will be successful and
