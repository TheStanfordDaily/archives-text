# Details of new dorm emerge
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DESK EDITOR 
The new Law School residence, set to house
roughly 670 students in a group of five- and six
story buildings, may result in the widening of
Campus Drive to four lanes near Mayfield, the
demolition of Casa Zapata's resident fellow cot
tage and the construction of two new parking
garages, according to Law School representa
tives who met last night at Chi Theta Chi with
students, faculty and other interested parties.
Plans for the complex have the dorms set up
as three buildings, with units ranging from stu
dios to two-bedroom apartments. The buildings,
the tallest of which would be 68 feet high, would

stretch from Lane C, near Vaden Health Center,
to the Law School. They would require the relo
cation of the Drell House, Rogers House (the lo
cation of the Bridge Peer Counseling Center),
Owen House and the Bike Shop, as well as the
demolition of the Casa Zapata Resident Fellow
cottage.
The current design has it set at 500,000 square
feet, more than twice the size originally planned.
According to Frank Brucato, associate dean
of finance and chief financial officer for the Law
School, the project has grown larger since the
donor became involved.
"We found a potential donor to whom we
showed our capital plan and he started coming
back with his ideas of what Stanford needed," he

said. "As it got bigger and bigger, the Law School
said, 'We didn't need this many rooms.'"
The donor will be funding a significant
amount of the $ll5 million cost of the building,
according to Brucato. The rest will be funded in
debt, which is currently limited by the University
to no more than $24 million.
Brucato explained that the donor seeks to im
prove University building in general and has specific
ideas about how the residence should be built.
"He does not think Stanford knows how to
build for the long life of a building," Brucato
said. "He would like to show Stanford how to
construct a building that will be successful and
meet our needs for 100 years."

Community concerns

However, some community members saw the
donor's modus operandi as less than benign.
"One of the things that disturbs me here is that
we do have campus planners, and we do have cam
pus architects and the phrase that you have used re
peatedly is 'the donor's architect,' " said German
Studies Prof. Elizabeth Bernhardt, dean of the
Lower Row. "If you look just across the street, you
see the regulations that 579 Alvarado had to com
mit to in order to be X, Y or Z, and then suddenly
there's somebody else who has the privilege of his
or her own architect."
Senior Lauren Dietrich of Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford expressed concern that the build
ing will hinder the University's progress toward a
more energy-efficient and ecologically integrated
campus.
"Compromising the process by catering to the
one who holds the purse strings is disgraceful," she
said. "I hope that the top administrators of the Uni
versity recognize their obligation to the Stanford
community and respect community feedback and
concern."
Students for a Sustainable Stanford have worked
with the University over the past four years to in
crease the sustainability of University development
practices and participated in writing The Guideline
for Sustainable Buildings last year, Dietrich said.
"We believe in the importance of process and
are wary of donor-driven design that may compro
mise the integrity of our University and may leave
us with fancy buildings with high maintenance
costs," she said. "The meeting confirmed that the

Law School housing project is driven by the whims
of a donor."
Brucato said that the current design is just a pro
posal, and the goal of the current round of meetings
is to gather community input.

Future plans

The initial plan was significantly smaller, calling
for 240,000 square feet.
"The project, when it went for site and concept
was approved for 300 to 400 beds for the Law
School," said Susan Rozakis, project manager for
the residence.

There are only 580 students in the Law School,
and according to estimates, no more than 400 would
want housing. Brucato said that the Graduate
School of Business has expressed interest in the re
maining bed spaces. Once the new residence is com
plete, Crothers, the current law residence, would
begin housing undergraduates.
Currently the decision-making process is at the
upper levels of the University.
"Due to changes in the project since the original
site and concept approval, the project will go back
to the Board of Trustees for revised site and concept
approval," Rovakis said.
Bernhardt, as well as other attendees, raised
concerns about the maintenance of the campus' ar
chitectural style.
"We have a really beautiful corner here," Bern
hardt said, referring to the outdoor space near Chi
Theta Chi. "We have a beautiful house here; it's
funky and weird, but it's beautiful. What none of us
want to see is the beauty of this side of campus de
stroyed."
Brucato emphasized that the Law School also
seeks an aesthetically pleasing residence.
"We're an advocate for making something fit
in," he said.
Upper-level administrators have also been in
volved in the aesthetic issues. According to Bruca

to, Hennessy has insisted that the building not
shade Stern Hall.

Open dialogue

The new residence would provide the Law
School with a greater sense of community, said
Cathy Glaze, associate dean of student services at
the Law School.
"The original vision for the dorm was to create
an environment that added to the intellectual
vigor of the school," she said. "Law school is sort
of an all-consuming experience. The idea was to
create a community where people can have study
groups and sort of live the law a little more."
Glaze predicted that the residence would help
focus the community, drawing in students who live
off campus or are scattered in other dorms.
"We have 335 law students living on campus and
some more living in subsidized housing," she said.
"We think a dorm would attract more students to
campus."
She further emphasized that input is needed to
make the building a success.
"I am confident that this can be a wonderful pro
ject," Glaze said. "We want to work with all of you
to make sure that it is."
The meeting at Chi Theta Chi was on of the first
of a round of outreach efforts that the Law School is
conducting. It was facilitated by law student and Chi
Theta Chi resident Maya Sen, with the help of the
Chi Theta Chi staff.
"I was basically concerned that there was
some amount of misinformation going around,
and because of that there was some distrust
building," she said. "I wanted to set up a meet
ing where I could get some real information
about what was going on direct from the Law
School. As both a law student and a resident of
the neighborhood, it is important to me that res
idents are happy with the project and there's an
open dialogue."

chitectural style.
"We have a really beautiful corner here," Bern
hardt said, referring to the outdoor space near Chi
Theta Chi. "We have a beautiful house here; it's
funky and weird, but it's beautiful. What none of us
want to see is the beauty of this side of campus de
stroyed."
Brucato emphasized that the Law School also
seeks an aesthetically pleasing residence.
"We're an advocate for making something fit
in," he said.
Upper-level administrators have also been in
volved in the aesthetic issues. According to Bruca

to, Hennessy has insisted that the building not
shade Stern Hall.

Open dialogue

The new residence would provide the Law
School with a greater sense of community, said
Cathy Glaze, associate dean of student services at
the Law School.
"The original vision for the dorm was to create
an environment that added to the intellectual
vigor of the school," she said. "Law school is sort
of an all-consuming experience. The idea was to
create a community where people can have study
groups and sort of live the law a little more."
Glaze predicted that the residence would help
focus the community, drawing in students who live
off campus or are scattered in other dorms.
"We have 335 law students living on campus and
some more living in subsidized housing," she said.
"We think a dorm would attract more students to
campus."
She further emphasized that input is needed to
make the building a success.
"I am confident that this can be a wonderful pro
ject," Glaze said. "We want to work with all of you
to make sure that it is."
The meeting at Chi Theta Chi was on of the first
of a round of outreach efforts that the Law School is
conducting. It was facilitated by law student and Chi
Theta Chi resident Maya Sen, with the help of the
Chi Theta Chi staff.
"I was basically concerned that there was
some amount of misinformation going around,
and because of that there was some distrust
building," she said. "I wanted to set up a meet
ing where I could get some real information
about what was going on direct from the Law
School. As both a law student and a resident of
the neighborhood, it is important to me that res
idents are happy with the project and there's an
open dialogue."
The new Law School residence, set to house
roughly 670 students in a group of five- and six
story buildings, may result in the widening of
Campus Drive to four lanes near Mayfield, the
demolition of Casa Zapata's resident fellow cot
tage and the construction of two new parking
garages, according to Law School representa
tives who met last night at Chi Theta Chi with
students, faculty and other interested parties.
Plans for the complex have the dorms set up
as three buildings, with units ranging from stu
dios to two-bedroom apartments. The buildings,
the tallest of which would be 68 feet high, would

stretch from Lane C, near Vaden Health Center,
to the Law School. They would require the relo
cation of the Drell House, Rogers House (the lo
cation of the Bridge Peer Counseling Center),
Owen House and the Bike Shop, as well as the
demolition of the Casa Zapata Resident Fellow
cottage.
The current design has it set at 500,000 square
feet, more than twice the size originally planned.
According to Frank Brucato, associate dean
of finance and chief financial officer for the Law
School, the project has grown larger since the
donor became involved.
"We found a potential donor to whom we
showed our capital plan and he started coming
back with his ideas of what Stanford needed," he

said. "As it got bigger and bigger, the Law School
said, 'We didn't need this many rooms.'"
The donor will be funding a significant
amount of the $ll5 million cost of the building,
according to Brucato. The rest will be funded in
debt, which is currently limited by the University
to no more than $24 million.
Brucato explained that the donor seeks to im
prove University building in general and has specific
ideas about how the residence should be built.
"He does not think Stanford knows how to
build for the long life of a building," Brucato
said. "He would like to show Stanford how to
construct a building that will be successful and
meet our needs for 100 years."

Community concerns

However, some community members saw the
donor's modus operandi as less than benign.
"One of the things that disturbs me here is that
we do have campus planners, and we do have cam
pus architects and the phrase that you have used re
peatedly is 'the donor's architect,' " said German
Studies Prof. Elizabeth Bernhardt, dean of the
Lower Row. "If you look just across the street, you
see the regulations that 579 Alvarado had to com
mit to in order to be X, Y or Z, and then suddenly
there's somebody else who has the privilege of his
or her own architect."
Senior Lauren Dietrich of Students for a Sus
tainable Stanford expressed concern that the build
ing will hinder the University's progress toward a
more energy-efficient and ecologically integrated
campus.
"Compromising the process by catering to the
one who holds the purse strings is disgraceful," she
said. "I hope that the top administrators of the Uni
versity recognize their obligation to the Stanford
community and respect community feedback and
concern."
Students for a Sustainable Stanford have worked
with the University over the past four years to in
crease the sustainability of University development
practices and participated in writing The Guideline
for Sustainable Buildings last year, Dietrich said.
"We believe in the importance of process and
are wary of donor-driven design that may compro
mise the integrity of our University and may leave
us with fancy buildings with high maintenance
costs," she said. "The meeting confirmed that the

Law School housing project is driven by the whims
of a donor."
Brucato said that the current design is just a pro
posal, and the goal of the current round of meetings
is to gather community input.

Future plans

The initial plan was significantly smaller, calling
for 240,000 square feet.
"The project, when it went for site and concept
was approved for 300 to 400 beds for the Law
School," said Susan Rozakis, project manager for
the residence.

There are only 580 students in the Law School,
and according to estimates, no more than 400 would
want housing. Brucato said that the Graduate
School of Business has expressed interest in the re
maining bed spaces. Once the new residence is com
plete, Crothers, the current law residence, would
begin housing undergraduates.
Currently the decision-making process is at the
upper levels of the University.
"Due to changes in the project since the original
site and concept approval, the project will go back
to the Board of Trustees for revised site and concept
approval," Rovakis said.
