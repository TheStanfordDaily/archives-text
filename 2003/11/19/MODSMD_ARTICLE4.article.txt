# Study warns of corporate funding
## 
### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford ranks 13th in a list of universities with the most private re
search funding, according to a Tufts University professor who argues that
recent increases in funding could have dangerous effects on the validity
and dissemination of scientific data.
Tufts Prof. Sheldon Krimsky, whose book is called "Science in the Pri
vate Interest," said that Stanford received approximately $35 million in
industry funding for research in 2001, a 142 percent increase from 1992.
In comparison, overall research funding increased by 31 percent over that
period.
"When public funding declined, private funding stepped in and re
placed it," said Krimsky, a professor of urban and environmental policy
and planning. By compiling data made available by the National Science
Foundation, he found funding for university research doubled in the past
20 years.
Stanford is home to high-profile privately funded programs like Bio X,
Media X and the Global Climate and Energy Project, the latter of which
attracted a considerable amount of controversy when it was announced
last year.
Krimsky argued that corporate sponsors harm research in a number of
ways. They can directly interfere and influence data in their own interest,
or they can delay and even prevent the publication of results that they
" find unfavorable.
"There's been a rise of conflicts of interest and inflating of data," said
Krimsky, who contends that research and data can be biased due to in
creased private funding of in the science fields.

However, University administra
tion and faculty argued that Stan
ford has strict guidelines that place
researchers in little danger of be
coming corporate puppets. Sally
O'Neil, manager of Stanford's In
dustrial Contracts Office, said that
federal funding, like industry fund
ing, has been on the rise.
"The vast majority of research
dollars at Stanford come from the
U.S. federal government, not from
industry," she said. "As industry
funding has increased, so has federal
funding."

Strict limitations

Industry sponsors were out in
force at the Media X Partners Con
ference on Nov. 8. Media X is an in
terdisciplinary program focused on
information and communication
technology and funded by annual
donations of $50,000 to $200,000
from companies such as Microsoft
and Charles Schwab. At the confer
ence, University researchers showed
off their findings to current and po
tential sponsors.
John Logan, the director of
Media X's Partners Program, said
that the collaboration between cor
porations and researchers has been
fruitful, and that the program is cur
rently trying to find more corporate
partners. He noted that although
researchers and representatives
from the larger sponsors meet fre
quently, "there haven't been any
conflicts."
Krimsky said that many universi
ties have strict regulations limiting
industry control and interference, a

practice that he supports.
O'Neil, who agrees that industry
should not control research, said
that Stanford's research guidelines
include such regulations.
"Stanford's policies ensure that
our researchers may freely publish
the results of their research, without
control from the company that has
funded the research," O'Neil said.
"Many universities have a similar
policy. Stanford also is committed to
openness in research, which means
our researchers may not do 'secret'
research that cannot be disclosed to
the public."
David G. Victor, director of Stan
ford's Program on Energy and Sus
tainable Development, echoed
O'Neil's arguments.
"Universities have demanded
firewalls and review procedures
that, in the main, work pretty well,"
he said.
Krimsky argued that corporate
sponsors can harm research by di
rectly interfering with data in their
own interest and even preventing
the publication of results that they
find unfavorable. As one example,
he pointed to a personal experience
in which W.R. Grace unsuccessfully
tried to prevent the publication of
his report on the company's pollu
tion of local wells.
But Victor argued that industry
funding is no less corrupt than other
types of funding.
"It seems to me that we must
apply similar scrutiny to the full
range of funding sources," he said.
"There is no reason to assume that
foundation or government funds are
intrinsically unbiased. In the envi
ronmental area, for example, foun
dations often grant according to
much more explicit policy agendas
than the leading industrial funding
sources."
