# Study warns of corporate funding

### ANTHONY HA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford ranks 13th in a list of universities with the most private re
search funding, according to a Tufts University professor who argues that
recent increases in funding could have dangerous effects on the validity
and dissemination of scientific data.
Tufts Prof. Sheldon Krimsky, whose book is called "Science in the Pri
vate Interest," said that Stanford received approximately $35 million in
industry funding for research in 2001, a 142 percent increase from 1992.
In comparison, overall research funding increased by 31 percent over that
period.
"When public funding declined, private funding stepped in and re
placed it," said Krimsky, a professor of urban and environmental policy
and planning. By compiling data made available by the National Science
Foundation, he found funding for university research doubled in the past
20 years.
Stanford is home to high-profile privately funded programs like Bio X,
Media X and the Global Climate and Energy Project, the latter of which
attracted a considerable amount of controversy when it was announced
last year.
Krimsky argued that corporate sponsors harm research in a number of
ways. They can directly interfere and influence data in their own interest,
or they can delay and even prevent the publication of results that they
" find unfavorable.
"There's been a rise of conflicts of interest and inflating of data," said
Krimsky, who contends that research and data can be biased due to in
creased private funding of in the science fields.
