# Skateboarding technically illegal
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER STAFF WRITER 
Is skateboarding transportation or crime?
The answer is pretty simple, according to campus police and students on
four wheels. Students don't have much to fear from the police if they aren't
doing tricks, and the police even hope to rework the rules around trans
portation on campus.
By the post office yesterday, junior Adam Forest related his most recent
encounter with the police. "I just walked by a cop with my skateboard and
said, 'Hey, what's going on?' The cop said 'Hey' and kept going."
Skateboarding is technically illegal, a county code violation, but that
does not stop it from being one of the more popular ways to get around at
Stanford after walking and biking.
Stanford police know that skateboarding is popular, and they empha
size that while they enforce the law, they watch out for egregious violations
and not everyday transportation uses.
"Technically they're not [allowed to skateboard]," said Laura Wilson,
director of public safety. "It's not a place we focus a tremendous amount
of attention."
So far this school year, there have been 12 citations for skateboarding,
but only one of those cited was a Stanford student.
"The greater problem is people tricking, which leaves marks, damages
property and it's the noise factor," Wilson said.
Groups of juveniles, usually local high school and middle school stu
dents, have been cited this year for board tricks near the post office, math
building and physics building. Evidence of numerous skateboards can be
found on railings around the edges of the Quad.
"Not only can skateboarding disrupt classes and other academic pur
suits, it can also damage property and be a hazard to pedestrians," said Sgt.
Rick Tipton.
"Most of the violations are probably not by students, but there are a cer
tain number of students cited," he said.
The county ordinance prohibiting skateboarding was passed in 1992 at
the request of the University. It makes all skateboarding and coasting ille
gal within the Campus Drive loop, subject to a $100 fine. The penalty is
similar to that for having an unregistered bike.
Senior Zack Beer was the only student cited specifically for skate
boarding so far this school year. He was cited for running through a stop
sign at Lomita Drive and Mayfield Avenue, the same violation bicyclists
are cited for on a daily basis. But he was still taken off guard.
"I was surprised to be chased after by a cop car with lights flashing for
doing something I do every day anyway," he said. "They were remarkably
serious about it, even asking to search through my bag and saying they
could take away my skateboard if they wanted to."
While running stop signs will always be enforced, Stanford police are
looking into ways to coordinate the regulations with transportation uses

Despite its prevalence on campus, especially in White Plaza, skateboarding
is a violation of the county code.
around campus.
"We are in the process, with
Parking and Transportation, of try
ing to rework a lot of the rules and
regulations around bicycles, Seg
ways, in-line skates," Wilson said.
"We're kind of in a bind, because we

have to have a county ordinance
passed in order to be able to let us
regulate those things. It is a priority
for me, and it is something we're
looking at, but like many things
around here, there's no easy an
swer."
In the meantime, the skateboard
ers keep riding.
"I don't think the police are ever
going to give me a ticket if I use it for
transportation," said senior Chuck
Armstrong.
