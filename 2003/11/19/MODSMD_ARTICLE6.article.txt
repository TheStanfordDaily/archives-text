Stanford students are among many college students in California
who are encouraged to collect part of a $l.l billion settlement with Mi
crosoft that was reached earlier this year the largest class-action
lawsuit in state history.
"We encourage all students to take advantage of this opportunity,"
said Richard Grossman, a San Francisco lawyer from Townsend &
Townsend & Crew, the firm that brought the class-action case. "The
money is available, you're entitled to it, go get it."
Students do not need to be California residents to qualify for the set
tlement, which was announced on Jan. 10, about a month and a half be
fore the trial was set to begin in San Francisco's Superior Court. An in
dividual must only have purchased applicable Microsoft software or
hardware within the state between Feb. 18,1995 and Dec. 15, 2001 to
collect reimbursements.
Items challenged for violating California's antitrust and unfair com
petition laws include certain Microsoft applications software, operating
systems and computers with pre-installed Microsoft programs. The op
erating systems include MS-DOS or Windows, and eligible applications
software includes Microsoft Office, Word, Excel, Works Suite and
Home Essentials 97 or 98. Software upgrades will also be considered.
Specific cash rewards include $l6 for any computer operating Win
dows or MS-DOS, $29 for every copy of Office software, $26 for Excel,
and $5 for Word, Home Essentials or Works Suite.
"This settlement represents a significant portion of the amount that
Californians paid to Microsoft for its operating system and key applica
tions software over a seven-year period. It is a tremendous result for
California's businesses and consumers," Grossman said.
Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith pointed out that the litiga
tion will not discourage progress and that he believes that the settle
ment helped avoid a burdensome hearing.
"This settlement allows us to focus on the future and building great
software and avoids the cost and uncertainty of a lengthy trial," Smith
said.
All that's needed to apply for a voucher for up to five product pur
chases and for up to $lOO is to list the products purchased on the claim
form. The claimant does not need any receipts, serial numbers, or other
documents to make claims at these limits.
Vouchers can then be used to buy new software or computer hard
ware such as desktops, laptops, printers, scanners, monitors and key
boards. The vouchers will be valid for products from any manufacturer,
not just Microsoft.
