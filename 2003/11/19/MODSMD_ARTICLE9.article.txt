## The
						Catch-her in the Lie: A bad day for bananafishers

/ / "W" T hat are you looking at?" the unshaven punk
% A / growled in my ear. I guess you could say he
\I V breathed it. He'd been drinking, naturally.
T T As I gazed at the color photograph of a man
in handcuffs taken from die waist down, I felt as if I, pencil-skirt
ed and middy-bloused, had been transported to the set of a post
modern grade-B Perry Mason film noir, a good girl gone bad ri
fling through incriminating records, with my partner in crime, be
fore the lead dick[trenchcoats] returned. We were alone in the
room in the wee hours of the night. Outside, a police-car siren
howled mournfully.

Suddenly, though, we were interrupted. A
boy entered and collapsed in a chair. Remov
ing a hefty engineering textbook from his
book-bag, he settled in. And squirmed. Raising
his hand to scratch his crew-cut head, he eyed
my computer monitor. "Oh f—!" he said. Drat.
A girl needs privacy for this kind of thing.
Sighing, I pulled my girly mag down from my
eyes and tugged the wire out of the headphone
jack. We would have to go back to my place.
Perhaps I was channeling some serious
retro vibes because I'd just been dipping into
J.D. Salinger's 1948 short story, "A Perfect

Day for Bananafish." The first thing the reader sees is the protag
onist's toe-painting young wife, clad only in a silk bathrobe, read
ing "an article in a women's pocket-size magazine, called 'Sex Is
Fun or Hell.'" It's the hell part that just might put a bunch of
crafty new entrepreneurs solidly in the red soon.
No, they're not taking over Bob Guccione's defunct sideline.
They're trying to capitalize on men's fear of being falsely accused
of sexual assault. Hie Kobe Bryant case has made this fear a high
profile scourge: nobody disputes that the beast with two backs was
on the prowl that night, but it is quite unclear whether the deed was
forced or not. In other words, your standard he said, she-said
scenario, glammed up with Shaq's strapping rival as the perhaps
predator, a tearful American Idol-reject concierge as the maybe
victim, and a ritzy Colorado resort setting.
Not to sport with you, but some companies are trying to en
hance men's game(not the ball kind, or wait, cancel that) by bol
stering their defensive lines(oops, wrong sport) their product
lines, that is. I found the handcuffered hero shilling for Sexual-
Consent Form.com, a site which allows wary gentlemen, and
ladies too, by courtesy, to create their own form stating who does
what to whom, kind of like a "Mother May I?" with a quite dif
ferent kind of mama. Fittingly for a site which deals in the deli
cate machinations of human reproductionjt has spawned several
copycat sites, which make much of the "quick and easy" speed of
the process, In-n-Out, as it were.

You dreamed of scenes
Like you read of in magazines
A new romance
Invented in the bedroom
Is this really the way it is
Or a contract in our mutual interest
— Gang of Four, "Contract"
Then there's KB Consensual Sex Condoms, whose generous
manufacturers throw in the consent form as a free bonus, with the
friendly admonition, "Don't get yourself in trouble like Kobe...
Get yourself double security..." I presume they're not talking
about double-bagging it.
The, well, hard sell of the sites is relatively convincing. "You
wouldn't get married without a prenuptial agreement or jump out
of a plane without a parachute. So why have sex without a con
tract?" Can't argue with that kind of rhetoric.
I signed on the lines of a wack contract
Didn't even read it, fuck that
— Ice-T, "Rap Games Hijacked"
Awhile back, closer to the Age of Aquarius and his free-lov
ing phish people, philosophista Hannah Arendt proposed the in
triguing concept of the "banality of evil." This new phenomenon
of sexual contracts being inked, a bazillion times more often than
first-round draft picks, lends itself to a corollary concept: the ba
nality of sex. Don't misconstrue this~not to say that sex is banal,
but when sex is reduced to a transaction allowing agent X to put
tab A into slot B, things could get rather cold and clinical. Just
take a look at how the contracts are worded:"Sexual Consent
Form #101 Revision 1.02: This form is to be used in situations in
volving two distinct parties, one male and one female. Other
available forms are as follows:
#102: Two parties, both male
#103: Two parties, both female
#104: Three parties, one male and two female
#105: Three parties, two male and one female
#106: Three or more parties, all male
#107: Three or more parties, all female
#108: Four or more parties, mixed male and female
Makes one wonder just how many combinations and permu
tations of rutting bodies the site's mainframe would be able to
handle. Beep. Whir.
I could have stayed at home forever
But big money man was much too clever
He said " Sign on the dotted line
It's going to work out fine"
— Rafferty Gerry, "Can I Have My Money Back"
Another disturbing element of the sites is their tendency to
present women as devious temptress, ready to ride their way to
glory. We've all read our Milton, and ultimately responsibility is up
to us.
Baby won't you sign on the dotted line
I'm gonna make your dreams come true
The check's in the mail, would I lie to you?
— Weird A1 Yankovic, "The Check's In The Mail"
And for those men who pull out their pens, as it were, there is
always Salinger's precocious Holden Caulfield's "goddam base
ball glove."

He arrived one day at about three o'clock. Everyone was out in
the fields. He went into the kitchen, but at first he did not see
Nicole; the shutters were closed The sun was shining in between
the slats, casting long, thin rays of light which stretched across the
stone floor, broke sharply over the corners of the fiirniture and
shitnmered on the ceiling. On the table, flies were crawling up
the sides of dirty glasses and buzzing as they drowned in ten
cider remaining at the bottom. The light coming down through
the chimney turned the soot on the fireback to velvet and gave a
bluish tinge to the cold ashes. Nicole was sitting between the win
dow and the fireplace sewing; she was not wearing a shawl, and
he could see little beads of sweat on her bare shoulders.
