Ten local Authors - writing
stories set in or around this
magical area - have scoured
their imaginations, pooled their
talents and scrupulously
critiqued each other's work to
come up with (this) book ....
Known collectively as the Fiction
Writers of the Monterey
Peninsula (FWOMP), their
approach is as staggeringly
diverse as it is unique, making
"Monterey Shorts" a volume with
something for everyone.
