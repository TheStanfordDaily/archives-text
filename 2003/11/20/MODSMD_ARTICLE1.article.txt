# Secret Snowflake snowed out of dining halls

First, it was the Mausoleum Party. And now, another Stanford holiday tra
dition is getting the axe — partly, at least. Secret Snowflake, at which students
force their friends to complete embarrassing, raunchy stunts in exchange for
small presents, will be banned from campus dining halls this year.
This change, according to residential staff members, came about because din
ing hall workers complained they had to clean up after the event. Furthermore,
some resident fellows had voiced concerns about the raunchier stunts — which
in the past have included strip shows, students in thongs and X-rated mono
logues.
Economics Prof. Steve Tadelis, a resident fellow in Burbank, added that "it
is not only frustration about cleaning, as it was [also] about broken and dam
aged furniture."
"Yes, I know this is hard to believe," Tadelis said, "but this happened quite
often."
Most dorm staffs learned of the change on Sunday, and since then, RAs
have made quick efforts to brainstorm creative ways to keep Secret Snowflake
alive. Roble House, for example, plans to schedule activities during nightly
Dead Week study breaks. Other dorms have toyed with the idea of asking stu
dents to bring their dinner trays with them to the dorm lounge so that activi
ties can be held there.
But other students say that the decision, handed down by Residential Ed
ucation, destroys the spirit of the much-loved Stanford tradition. To many stu
dents, Secret Snowflake was considered one of the highlights of fall quarter's
Dead Week.
"I disagree entirely with the new policy banning the tradition from the din
ing halls. I think it completely changes the dynamic of the event," said Mike
Endler, a RA in Arroyo, though he conceded that Res Ed's concerns are valid
and that some of the pranks at Secret Snowflake are inappropriate.
Senior Felicia Estrada voiced another concern.
"It doesn't seem like there was a very public dialogue between Res Ed and
students about... Secret Snowflake in general," Estrada said, calling the
change "unfortunate."
But other RAs say they were not surprised to hear of the decision, which
comes on the heels of another change, last year, which banned Secret
Snowflake activities from the serving area of dining halls.
"Unfortunately, this almost seemed like the next logical step," said senior
Neil Van Os, who has been an RA in Roble for two years.
Van Os said he understands the reasoning behind the decision to move Se
cret Snowflake out of dining halls.
"Not only were 8-year-olds around, but so were residents who want to
enjoy their meals," he said. "People deserve to eat in dining halls without being
interrupted by stuff like that, whether they're 5 years old or 20 years old."
The recent decisions to modify other Stanford traditions have come about
for several reasons.
Both the Mausoleum Party and Full Moon on the Quad were once funded
by the Alumni Association, which decided to discontinue its funding of both.
Funding for Full Moon on the Quad was taken up by campus groups like the
senior class, but the Mausoleum Party has been laid to rest, at least for now.
The change in the alcohol policy has sparked further changes: Senior Pub
Night has been changed to Senior Night, and some houses' TGIF events have
even been renamed, at the request of the Office of Student Activities.
Endler said he worries that forcing Secret Snowflake into dorm lounges or
other spaces will hinder the spontaneity of the activities.
"I'm afraid it is basically going to amount to a variety show, with people
completing dares one after another while the rest of the house sits back and
acts as an audience," he said.
Jane Camarillo, director of Res Ed, did not respond to requests for com
ment.
