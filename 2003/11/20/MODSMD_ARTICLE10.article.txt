# But Answer Girl, it was only on the floor for a second

Q Answer girl, is there any truth behind
the so-called "five-second rule"? Is it
really OK to eat food that's been
dropped on the floor, as long as it
wasn't there for more than five seconds?

A It's surprising but actually true:
/\ It's not necessarily harmful to eat
/ I food dropped on the floor —it
* just depends on what you drop,
and where you drop it.
At least, that's according to some of the re
cent research coming out of the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Apparently
some high school kid was enrolled in a Re

search Apprenticeship Program at the univer

sity this summer, when she
decided she wanted to tack
le the urban legend. So she
did — with the help of a
professor, his food microbi
ology lab, probably some
grad students who were
lying around I guess and
lots of gummy bears and
fudge-striped cookies.
The sunny side of their

conclusion — that some
dropped food is in fact alright to eat — came
after initially swabbing areas of floors all around
campus to collect bacteria samples. What they
ended up finding out is that floors — or I guess,

at least floors at the University of Illinois — are
a lot cleaner than you'd think floors would ever
be. You see, even after sampling high-traffic
areas, the swabbings proved remarkably free of
bacteria and even especially resistant microflo
ra, like spore-forming organisms.
The bad side of their conclusion — that
some dropped food isn't OK — came after the
researchers decided to purposely inoculate
store-bought floor tiles with bacteria (specifi
cally E. coli) and then tested what happened
when food was dropped on them. In this case,
common sense won out — along with, I guess,
the E. coli: In every trial, the food was con
taminated in five seconds or less.
As might also have been predicted, smooth
surfaced floor tiles got the food dirtier than

those with rough surfaces. (The lab didn't test
carpet.) Other unsurprising results included the
findings that dry food stayed cleaner than wet
food, and that processed food like cookies and
candy, which lack much naturally occurring
flora, came off the floor cleaner than did foods
like vegetables, meat and cheese.
Bottom line: If your floor's reasonable, it's
probably not going to kill you to eat that Chee
to you dropped. But as for, say, that Lagunita
Hungarian meatloaf you dropped on the din
ing hall floor: Trust me, it's gone. If you wish,
you may thank me later.
