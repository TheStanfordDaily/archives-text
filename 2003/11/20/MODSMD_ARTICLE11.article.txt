## Gay marriage should be legal 
### 
On Tuesday, the Massachusetts
Supreme Court ruled that the
states' ban on same-sex marriages
was unconstitutional and that the
state may not deny the protections, benefits
and obligations of marriage to same-sex cou

c
pies. We applaud this
decision as a positive
move toward the exten
sion of equal rights to
gays and lesbians.
While the court's rul
ing doesn't legalize same
sex marriage in the state
of Massachusetts, it does
represent a significant
advancement in the fight
to establish that right. In
the past, progressive ju
dicial decisions have
acted as a powerful stim
ulant for equal rights
movements, as in the
1954 Supreme Court

case of Brown vs. Board of Education. Although
significant hurdles remain until gay marriages are
recognized in the state of Massachusetts, the re
cent decision is powerful support for advocates'
efforts to push legislative change.
One potentially negative result of the ruling
is that it has already prompted efforts to pass

an amendment to the Massachusetts' constitu
tion banning same-sex marriage. Alternative
ly, it may also engender support for the Feder
al Marriage Amendment, which would consti
tutionally define marriage as a union between
a man and a woman. While such outcome

would be a catastroph
ic blow to gay rights,
one should not criti
cize the Massachusetts
ruling for the potential
backlash it may create.
In handing down this
ruling, the court sends
a strong message that
gays and lesbians are
equally protected by
the state constitution
â€” a message that
should not be criti
cized for how some
conservatives may
react to it.
Earlier this year, the

U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the consti
tutionality of state sodomy laws. The week,
the Massachusetts' court strengthened that
movement by boldly proclaiming that gays
are entitled to the same right to marry as het
erosexual couples. The rest of the nation
should listen up.

"While this ruling does not
legalize same-sex
marriage in the state of
Massachusetts, it does
represent a significant
advancement.
