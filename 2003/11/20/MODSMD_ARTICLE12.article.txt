# Why not free Napster for us all?

### 
Penn State University announced on
Nov. 7 that Napster's revamped music
sharing service — which is legal — will
soon become a staple of student life at
the college. Beginning in the spring of 2004, the
university will start covering the cost of Nap
ster's premium monthly service for students.
The revamped Napster, launched in October,
replaces the original service, which folded in
early 2001. Approximately one-quarter of the
83,000 students enrolled will have access to the
service by spring of 2004 and Penn State antici
pates that the entire student body will be con
nected by August.
Stanford should follow in the footsteps of
Penn State. Such a move would serve at least
two purposes: It would justify the now-inexpli
cable $10 monthly charge for Internet access,
and it would discourage students from illegally
exchanging music files while on campus.
Currently, Stanford students can participate
in the legal sharing of music only through
iTunes, a music service operated by Apple.
Though the program is primarily intended to
provide access to Apple's collection of pay-to
play music files, it also enables users on a local
area network to listen to one another's files.
But iTunes' biggest flaw is that students can
only access music from their immediate neigh
bors. The service does not provide a compre
hensive search feature, which eliminates much

of its appeal. Not surprisingly, students at Stan
ford turn to other such services as Kazaa and
WinMX, both of which enable the illegal shar
ing of music files.
The revamped version of Napster was creat
ed after agreements with five major record la
bels. Napster now provides legal access to hun
dreds of thousands of files, and though its col
lection may not be as comprehensive as those
of illegal services, it nonetheless provides a rea
sonable balance in the world of downloadable
music.
The Napster service provided by Penn,
which would cost students $9.95 per month if
they were to buy it on their own, does not per
mit users to burn downloaded songs to CD, nor
does it allow users to keep downloaded files
after their subscription period ends. As a result,
after leaving Penn State — either for the sum
mer or permanently — students will lose their
downloaded music if they do not pay a $0.99 fee
per file.
Even with all its limitations, Napster's pre
mium service meets the music-sharing needs
of most college students, and Penn State has
taken a step in the right direction by diverting
a portion of students' IT fees toward providing
such a service. Stanford should learn from
Penn State's example and offer its students the
opportunity to legally download and share
music files.
