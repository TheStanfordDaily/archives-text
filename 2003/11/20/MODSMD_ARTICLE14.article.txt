Changing Big Game culture
means changing attitude of
respect

While I applaud the efforts of Uni
versity President John Hennessy and
Cal's Chancellor Robert Berdahl to
promote sportsmanship at Big Game,
I believe both university administra
tions have played a large part in dis
mantling this "culture of lively com
petition" that they refer to in their op
ed ("Creating a better Big Game cul
ture," Nov. 19). Respect is a two-way
street, and it is naive to expect stu
dents at either school (well, at least
Stanford) to respect this culture when
they are not respected themselves.
In particular, the last four years
have seen a dramatic increase in se
curity presence at Big Game. In par
ticular, Stanford sheriffs and com
munity service officers have played
an intense role on the field and in the
stands at Big Games hosted by both
Stanford and Berkeley. During the
game, armed sheriffs patrol the side
line and keep video cameras focused
on the Stanford student section.
They walk through the bleachers in
an attempt to "root out" problems.
They are, without a doubt, enforce
ment oriented. At the end of games,
three rows of officers in full riot gear
have stationed themselves in front of
the Stanford student section; the
Berkeley student section has not
been subjected to nearly such ex
treme security measures. In effect,
Stanford students are being treated

like criminals in a prison. This shows
a clear lack of respect for Stanford
students on the part of Stanford's ad
ministration and pohce department.
It doesn't seem to be a surprise,
then, that when students feel disre
spected or attacked by the security
presence at games, they are more
likely to rebel against that presence
and misbehave. The University
should remember that in the past, the
majority of conflicts at Big Game
have been instigated by Cal support
ers and students (who routinely rush
and destroy the field after Big Game
losses). While the misbehavior of Cal
students is no excuse for inappropri
ate behavior by Stanford fans, the in
creased security presence promoted
by Stanford's administration is an
egregious overreaction and shows a
complete lack of respect for Stanford
students.

Law School dorm plans are a
step in the wrong direction

The proposed new law school
dorm ("Details of new dorm
emerge," Nov. 19) is designed at a
scale unsuited to its campus context.
Furthermore, its construction would
necessitate the destruction of an his
toric section of Salvatierra Walk.
The Walk, in addition to being a
beautiful, human-scaled space, is

one of the few remaining vestiges of
Frederick Law Olmsted's plan for
the Stanford campus. His plan called
for mixed faculty and student neigh
borhoods with curvilinear streets
and residences designed to resemble
private homes. This was to stand in
contrast with the more formal, axial
spaces around the Main Quad. Much
of these streets were removed and
dozens of historic homes destroyed
to make way for Meyer Library, the
Law School and White Plaza in the
1960s, leaving only Mayfield Row
and the stub end of Salvatierra. Now,
most of Salvatierra is slated to be
dismantled to make way for this me
galithic project.
It is unacceptable that the building's
donor has been afforded sweeping de
sign control when the University has a
professional architect and planning of
fice. It seems the official planning pro
cesses have been circumvented and
that money is being allowed to speak
louder than respect for our Universi
ty's history. I urge the University com
munity to fight for modification of this
plan, both to reduce its scale and elimi
nate its infringement upon Salvatierra
Walk. I also urge other building
donors, whose projects have been sub
ject to University planning standards,
to withhold their donations until this
plan is modified.
