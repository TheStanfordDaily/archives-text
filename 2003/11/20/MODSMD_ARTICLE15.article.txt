# ORDER IN THE COURT?
## Part of this complete breakfast 
### 
For the first time since I ac
quired the ability to ingest
solid foods, my father will
not have to worry about
saving me a drumstick when he
carves up the turkey next week. Sad
to say, I will not be coming home for
Thanksgiving this year.
I'd love to be able to tell you that
this was an intentional assertion of
independence on my part, a bold
statement to my parents that, at 26,
I'm finally ready to strike out on my
own and eat Froot Loops for dinner
on the last Thursday in November.
But that would be a lie (the part
about independence, not the part
about the Froot Loops). The truth of
the matter is, the airfare was just too
damn expensive: $450! You know
how many boxes of Froot Loops I
could buy for that? 94.74. (Assum
ing the Safeway across the street has
that many boxes, and that they'll let
me buy .74 of a box.) That's 88.8
pounds of cereal. Tucan Sam would
be quite jealous.
An impartial observer would
probably say that this situation is en
tirely my fault, for waiting until the
end of October to try to buy tickets.
But I'm not an impartial observer, so
screw that: I need somebody else to
blame. The airlines seem like attrac

tive candidates, but I can't in good
conscience go after them. If I could
get away with gouging the general
public like they do, I'd go for it in a
second. No, instead, I'll pick a less
obvious target for my holiday-relat
ed wrath: Franklin Delano Roo
sevelt.

Yes, it was good old FDR and his
cronies in Congress who passed the

bill making the
fourth Thursday
in November a
legal holiday. The
date on which
they did this —
Dec. 26,1941, just
18 days after en
tering WWII —
should send a red
flag that some
thing fishy was

going on. Not
only should Congress have had
more pressing business, but one sus
pects that the sneaky legislators
counted upon preoccupation with
war to distract would-be protesters
of the new law.
And protests there would have
been. What kind of sense does it
make having everyone travel on the
same day? Let's face it, even if you
are lucky enough to find a ticket that

only costs, say, 50 boxes of Froot
Loops, you're still in for one mas
sively uncomfortable trip. And pro
ductivity basically shuts down for
the entire day, except for the Detroit
Lions and Dallas Cowboys. Just try
finding an open store to buy ingredi
ents for your last-minute Froot
Loop casserole.
Wouldn't it make more sense to
stagger the holiday? We've got 26
possible first letters in a last name;
why aren't we distributing them
more effectively across the 52 weeks
in the year? One hundred percent
of the love, 1 / 52 of the hassle. Fam
ilies with multiple last names could
buy and sell assignments from other
similarly situated families, creating
a holiday commodities market sure
to spark economic recovery. Holi
day stress would be eliminated. Pro
ductivity would skyrocket. Turkey
ranchers could stay in business year
round.

Now that's something I could be
thankful for.
