## Honoring Universal Children's Day 
### ALEX MAINIERO 
Shots. Most of us can probably re
member sitting in a pediatrician's of
fice, just waiting for the doctor to
pull out that big needle and say, "it'll
just be a little pinch." It was scary,
and more than just a little pinch; but
you knew that if you played your
cards right and took it like a big kid,
you just might end up with a sticker,
or even a lollipop, at the end of the
visit. Sadly, what seems like a com
mon childhood experience to us is
simply not the case in much of the
world. In fact, one in four children
born today do not receive any vac
cines, and this lack of immunizations
causes about 8,000 childhood deaths
per day.
Today is Universal Children's
Day, a day to take a moment to rec
ognize that millions of children all
over the planet lack the basic necessi
ties of life. On Nov. 20,1959, the Unit
ed Nations passed the Declaration of
the Rights of the Child, and exactly 30
years later the United Nations Con
vention on the Rights of the Child
was adopted. Both of these docu
ments underscore the inalienable
rights of children and the need for na
tions to work together to protect
these rights. The Convention on the
Rights of the Child proclaims that
states "shall ensure to the maximum

extent possible the survival and de
velopment of the child." This rhetoric
must be supported by action.
Perhaps the most upsetting as
pect of many children's conditions
today is that they can be easily treat
ed and prevented. Oral rehydration
therapy, packets of simply sugar and
salt, when mixed with clean water,
can prevent the death from dehydra
tion of a child with diarrhea, and
costs only pennies to produce. Still,
one child dies of diarrhea every 19
seconds. Measles, a disease long for
gotten in the United States, claims
the lives of almost one million chil
dren every year. One measles vacci
nation costs just 80 cents. Obviously
not every threat to child survival,
such as the 300,000 children who are
exploited as soldiers, or the 125 mil
lion children who have never seen
the inside of a schoolhouse, has such
a clear-cut solution. Nevertheless,
efforts must be made to uphold chil
dren's rights as declared in 1959.
The United States cannot be held
accountable for the rest of the
world's problems; however, as a
world power, it has the responsibili
ty to be a leader in working with de
veloping countries to increase child
survival. Simple solutions for saving
hundreds of thousands of children
exist, and merely need financial sup
port to make them possible. Ameri

can funding for child survival pro
grams has remained roughly stag
nant for a decade. President George
W. Bush shocked many in Washing
ton when he proposed slashing al
most one-sixth of the entire budget
for child survival this year. The pres
ident's neglect of proven, effective
programs to help children is unac
ceptable. Fortunately, Congress has
acted to restore much of these fund
ing cuts, however the United States
needs to remain aware of its respon
sibility to commit to the issue of child
survival.
We at Stanford can make a differ
ence for children around the world
by writing letters to our Congress
members encouraging their support
for child survival funding. The Stu
dent Campaign for Child Survival, a
national grassroots organization
with a new chapter at Stanford, will
be in White Plaza today from 11a.m.
until 3 p.m. if you would like to sign
a letter to your local senator or rep
resentative. Play your cards right,
and we just may give you a lollipop.
