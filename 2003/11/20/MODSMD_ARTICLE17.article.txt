# OUT OF AFRICA
## How to help a 'developing' country 
### MEKLIT WORKNEH 
So it's already been established
that I am "the Ethiopian"
writing the "Out of Africa"
column. So I'm going to take
the column back and delve into one
of the key issues in Africa: develop
ment. The buzzword in international
development circles currently is "sus
tainable development." Sustainable
development is often defined as de
velopment that meets the needs of
the people today without compro
mising the ability of future genera
tions to meet their own needs. Pretty
vague? That's what I said too. But
what I really want to talk about is not
the actual concept of development,
but the people that work to imple
ment so-called "development" in
"developing nations." You might ask
why development and developing na
tions are in quotes. That would basi
cally be addressing my own issues
with a terminology that designates
certain countries as "developed" and
others as "developing." The image
that comes to mind is that of mature
adult and helpless toddler. Not too
much better than the first world vs..
third world paradigm we left behind,
in my opinion. But I'm straying once
again.
Watching western media today,
the portrayal of Africa is such that we
are overtaken with this burning, un
selfish desire to somehow help. Some
how we are disillusioned enough to
believe that our state of privilege puts
us in the position to be able to help
others. I went to see a movie the other
day entitled "Beyond Borders" star
ring Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen.
In the film, Jolie played an American
married to a wealthy Londoner and is
inspired by the dramatic appeals of a
doctor at a high-class charity ball. She
then flies off to the save the day in the
famine-stricken country of Ethiopia
only to find out her three or four
truck-loads of food don't even last the
few days she stays. It seems the only
purpose of that trip was so she could
fall in love with the handsome, do

gooder doctor. (Don't get me wrong,
I hope to be a do-gooder doctor some
day, just not that one.) Although this
is Hollywood, it is not as far-removed
from reality as we would like it to be.
With the ease of travel today, we have
volunteers traveling from every cor
ner of the Western hemisphere to
"developing nations" without any
clue of what they are heading for. You
know what I'm talking about, those
month-long programs that end as
soon as you've gotten over your initial
culture shock. And for some that have
never left comfortable suburbia this
can be quite a dramatic shock.
But I'm not trying to discourage
the altruistic instinct in people. Be
lieve it or not, I'm not an Ayn Rand
type who believes true altruism does
not exist. But having talked to Amer
ican and European volunteers in
Ethiopia this past summer, I began to
formulate a distinction between re
sponsible and irresponsible volun
teering. The first type of volunteer
work is the kind where people re
search the place they are visiting be
forehand. Students ask themselves if
they have the skills or expertise that
people or organizations in that coun
try can benefit from. Is their presence
in a certain place more beneficial than
it is detrimental? Have they made ef
forts to learn some of the language
and culture? And perhaps most im
portantly, especially on a first visit,
are they prepared to receive more
than that may be able to give back?
Volunteers are often fooled by the
attention they receive from organiza
tions working within the country and
translate this into meaning there is a
great need for them in that field. Fol
lowing my freshman year at Stanford,
I went home to do an internship with
the National HIV/AIDS Council Sec
retariat. Although I am Ethiopian, as
soon as people found out I was at
tending school in the United States, I
was instantly looked at differently.
For people who are actually from
outside Ethiopia, this attention in
creases. Because they are university
students or graduates from foreign
universities, this immediately gives

their opinions or their work more
clout than if they were local students
or graduates. If people do not make a
concerted effort to dispel such myths,
their presence may actually be more
detrimental to development work in
a nation. Development in any coun
try is dependent on the cultural, so
cial, economic and political situations
of that particular country. For those
coming from outside, regardless of
how much talent or skills they may
bring with them, understanding of
these situations will be limited. And it
is here where they must be willing to
receive more than they give initially.
Thus, the second type of volunteer
work is one in which volunteers are
arriving at their destination without
having identified their own skills and
talents as they relate to the place
where they are headed. They have
not made efforts to learn some of the
language and culture prior to their ar
rival. And once they are at their des
tination and have begun work, they
are not actively learning from their
environment and making a distinc
tion between areas in which their
work is really needed and areas in
which locals are able to do a better
job. This type of volunteer work be
comes unconstructive because it
leads to a mentality in which develop
ment is not seen as a process that is
specific to a particular setting. It ceas
es to become the means to a goal, but
becomes the end in itself.
International volunteers and vol
unteer organizations must seek to
change the attitude of doing volunteer
work simply for the sake of helping
anyone, anywhere. The process must
work two ways: Volunteers should
gain something from their experience,
yet make a positive impact as well. Re
lationships between aide-workers and
people in developing countries should
not be hierarchical, but instead, place
everyone on equal footing.
