## Tired of the old Play? Scott's got a new game plan 
### 
It's been an absolutely joyous 12 months for
Cal fans from the East Bay to East Timor, as
the Axe returned to Berkeley after a seven
year hiatus. There's no truth to the rumor
that the overzealous Weenies celebrated by try
ing to sneak the hardware through airport secu
rity.
With the one-year loan just about up, the
Bears' delusions of grandeur include a bowl
berth and a second-consecutive Big Game tri
umph, neither of which would completely dull
the pain of playing second-fiddle when it
comes to Bay Area athletics or being rejected
from Stanford.
Unfortunately, after the Cardinal restores
order to the world and returns the Axe to its
rightful home by late Saturday afternoon, you
can count on the fact that the Weenies will re
vert to masking their recent Big Game inepti
tude with three heinous words: Remember The

Play.
I'm thankful I was just a
twinkle in my parents' eyes
when the most outrageous
conclusion to a game in the
history of college football un
folded on the turf of Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium in the
85th Big Game some 21 years
ago.
After a John Elway-led
drive set up a field goal to give
the Cardinal a 20-19 lead with

four seconds left, all that stood between Stan
ford and a bowl bid was a single tackle — and
several trombones.
But four seconds, five laterals, six points and
a hoard of confused Stanford Band members
later, the Cardinal had lost 25-20 and The Play
was forever etched in the memories of Cal and
Stanford fans alike..
Enough already!
With last year's Big Game serving as the 20th
anniversary, The Play drew significant and
painful media attention. Twenty-one years later,
it's high time Stanford returns the favor.
So in lieu of what some might consider more
important items of business, like eating, sleeping
and declaring my major, I've spent the past cou
ple days drawing up a new Play that will make
the old Play seem like, well, just your average
five-lateral kickoff return for a touchdown.
I call it the Axe-tion Potential.
To be honest, this play is so flawless Stanford
could start at its own one-inch line and still
score, but let's assume the team starts at its own
20.
Trailing by five points with three seconds on
the clock, Chris Lewis lines up under center with
J.R. Lemon as the lone set back. Greg Camaril
lo and Nick Sebes line up to the left and Luke
Powell lines up to the right.
Lewis takes the snap, drops back ... and
hands off to Lemon on the draw play up the mid
dle for a one-yard gain. Just kidding, that was a
joke. Haha ... ha?
Lemon tosses it back to Lewis, who rolls right
and fires laterally across the field to Camarillo.
Camarillo makes the catch behind the line of
scrimmage, takes two steps to his right and
throws a lateral bullet to the lightning-quick
Powell, who has sprinted to midfield and back
behind the line of scrimmage by this time, ren
dering his defender asthmatic in the process.
Powell fakes as if he's going to run, drops
back and hits Lewis, who has snuck out of the
back field untouched, on a post pattern into Cal
territory.
Meanwhile, the Tree starts pummeling Oski
(get a new sweater, already) in the corner of the
end zone, causing the yellow-clad stadium secu
rity personnel (all 124 of them) to abandon their
usual positions and rush to the scene, walkie
talkies in hand.
For those who used to watch the WWF, re
member when a manager would stand ringside
and pull some stunt during a fight to distract the
referee, just long enough for his wrestler to ille
gally break a metal chair over his opponent's
head? Well, that's the idea here but with the goal
being six points and the Axe, not a three-count
and a silly belt.
By this point, the Band has inconspicuously
ripped off its pin-covered red vests and white
hats to reveal Cal's high school marching band
attire. With stadium security attending to Oski,
the Band, incognito, storms the field.
Back to the action, Lewis laterals to tight end
Alex Smith, who rumbles to the 35-yard line,
does a little dance for good measure and tosses
the ball back to lineman Kirk Chambers. Cham
bers drags three Cal players 10 more yards be
fore perfectly executing the final lateral to Pow
ell, who streaks down the right sideline towards
pay dirt.
Given that there will probably be a slew of
Cal defenders with an angle to make the tackle
— perhaps camped out along the goalline — the
Band redeems itself by delivering several pun
ishing blocks to spring Powell into the end zone.
Game over, Stanford wins, The Play as we know
it is history and Cal fans are left wondering for
eternity how their own band could be so stupid.
Now that would be worth remembering.
It's a shame the Cardinal won't need the Axe
tion Potential to win Saturday. But, hey, it
makes for a great two-point conversion play
when you're up big in the fourth quarter, too.

college football head coach. E-mail him a good
fake resume at ssallen@stanford.edu.

It's been an absolutely joyous 12 months for
Cal fans from the East Bay to East Timor, as
the Axe returned to Berkeley after a seven
year hiatus. There's no truth to the rumor
that the overzealous Weenies celebrated by try
ing to sneak the hardware through airport secu
rity.
With the one-year loan just about up, the
Bears' delusions of grandeur include a bowl
berth and a second-consecutive Big Game tri
umph, neither of which would completely dull
the pain of playing second-fiddle when it
comes to Bay Area athletics or being rejected
from Stanford.
Unfortunately, after the Cardinal restores
order to the world and returns the Axe to its
rightful home by late Saturday afternoon, you
can count on the fact that the Weenies will re
vert to masking their recent Big Game inepti
tude with three heinous words: Remember The

Play.
I'm thankful I was just a
twinkle in my parents' eyes
when the most outrageous
conclusion to a game in the
history of college football un
folded on the turf of Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium in the
85th Big Game some 21 years
ago.
After a John Elway-led
drive set up a field goal to give
the Cardinal a 20-19 lead with

four seconds left, all that stood between Stan
ford and a bowl bid was a single tackle — and
several trombones.
But four seconds, five laterals, six points and
a hoard of confused Stanford Band members
later, the Cardinal had lost 25-20 and The Play
was forever etched in the memories of Cal and
Stanford fans alike..
Enough already!
With last year's Big Game serving as the 20th
anniversary, The Play drew significant and
painful media attention. Twenty-one years later,
it's high time Stanford returns the favor.
So in lieu of what some might consider more
important items of business, like eating, sleeping
and declaring my major, I've spent the past cou
ple days drawing up a new Play that will make
the old Play seem like, well, just your average
five-lateral kickoff return for a touchdown.
I call it the Axe-tion Potential.
To be honest, this play is so flawless Stanford
could start at its own one-inch line and still
score, but let's assume the team starts at its own
20.
Trailing by five points with three seconds on
the clock, Chris Lewis lines up under center with
J.R. Lemon as the lone set back. Greg Camaril
lo and Nick Sebes line up to the left and Luke
Powell lines up to the right.
Lewis takes the snap, drops back ... and
hands off to Lemon on the draw play up the mid
dle for a one-yard gain. Just kidding, that was a
joke. Haha ... ha?
Lemon tosses it back to Lewis, who rolls right
and fires laterally across the field to Camarillo.
Camarillo makes the catch behind the line of
scrimmage, takes two steps to his right and
throws a lateral bullet to the lightning-quick
Powell, who has sprinted to midfield and back
behind the line of scrimmage by this time, ren
dering his defender asthmatic in the process.
Powell fakes as if he's going to run, drops
back and hits Lewis, who has snuck out of the
back field untouched, on a post pattern into Cal
territory.
Meanwhile, the Tree starts pummeling Oski
(get a new sweater, already) in the corner of the
end zone, causing the yellow-clad stadium secu
rity personnel (all 124 of them) to abandon their
usual positions and rush to the scene, walkie
talkies in hand.
For those who used to watch the WWF, re
member when a manager would stand ringside
and pull some stunt during a fight to distract the
referee, just long enough for his wrestler to ille
gally break a metal chair over his opponent's
head? Well, that's the idea here but with the goal
being six points and the Axe, not a three-count
and a silly belt.
By this point, the Band has inconspicuously
ripped off its pin-covered red vests and white
hats to reveal Cal's high school marching band
attire. With stadium security attending to Oski,
the Band, incognito, storms the field.
Back to the action, Lewis laterals to tight end
Alex Smith, who rumbles to the 35-yard line,
does a little dance for good measure and tosses
the ball back to lineman Kirk Chambers. Cham
bers drags three Cal players 10 more yards be
fore perfectly executing the final lateral to Pow
ell, who streaks down the right sideline towards
pay dirt.
Given that there will probably be a slew of
Cal defenders with an angle to make the tackle
— perhaps camped out along the goalline — the
Band redeems itself by delivering several pun
ishing blocks to spring Powell into the end zone.
Game over, Stanford wins, The Play as we know
it is history and Cal fans are left wondering for
eternity how their own band could be so stupid.
Now that would be worth remembering.
It's a shame the Cardinal won't need the Axe
tion Potential to win Saturday. But, hey, it
makes for a great two-point conversion play
when you're up big in the fourth quarter, too.
