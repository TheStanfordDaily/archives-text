# Volleyball winds down Pac-10 play

### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Standout Pacific 10 Conference performances
are nothing new for the Stanford women's volley
ball team: Between 1986 and 2002, the Cardinal fin
ished in the top two in all but one season, distin
guishing itself with nine conference titles and seven
second-place finishes. The only year the team did
not reach this mark was in 2000, when it finished
fourth in conference competition.
While No. 1 Southern California (26-0,17-0 Pac
10) clinched the Pac-10 title with its win over No. 7
Stanford (19-6,12-4) last Friday, neither USC nor
any other team in the Pac-10 has come close to
touching the Cardinal's historic winning streak. De
spite last weekend's loss, Stanford hopes to finish
the regular season in strong form with victories over
Oregon and Oregon State.
The Cardinal now stands in second place in the
conference with UCLA and California close be
hind. If Stanford wins one of its matches against the
Oregon schools, it will walk away with at least a sec
ond-place tie. If the Cardinal loses both games, it
could still finish second because UCLA faces the
undefeated, top-ranked Trojans in its final match.
A strong finish by the Cardinal this weekend
should guarantee its ranking entering the post-sea
son tournament because of the strength of its regu
lar season Pac-10 schedule. Currently, six of the 10
teams in the Pac-10 are ranked in the nation's top
25, and five of are in the top 11. At one point this
season, the conference held five of the top 10 spots
in the nation. Pac-10 teams are 71-27 against non
conference opponents.

"The Pac-10 is such a strong conference this year
that it has gained a lot of respect throughout the
country," said junior outside hitter Ogonna Nna
mani. "For every team in the conference, just being
in the Pac-10 shows that you have played good
teams every weekend and holding our position in
the conference can really help us a lot in the region
al seedings."
Before the Cardinal can begin thinking about
seedings and regionals, it first needs to focus on de
feating the Oregon schools. Stanford first faces
Oregon (3-22,0-16) on Thursday night at 7 p.m. at
Maples Pavilion. While the Ducks have a weak
record in conference play, the team took one game
from the Cardinal during the first match-up on
Sept. 18. Stanford won that match 3-1, to increase its
all-time record against the Ducks to 37-2. The last
time the Ducks took a match from the Cardinal was
in 1989.
On Friday, the Cardinal will take on the Ore
gon State Beavers (15-13,5-11) which are coming
off of a split against the Arizona schools last
weekend. In the matches this weekend, junior Al
lison Lawrence is looking to get at least 16 kills in
order to break into the program's single-season
top 10 fist. Stanford holds an impressive 37-0 all
time record against Oregon State, including a 3-0
victory over the Beavers this season in Corvallis,
Ore.
Stanford will be again looking to its strong net
play to take down the Ducks and Beavers. Senior
middle blocker Jennifer Harvey, who had nine
blocks in Stanford's win over UCLA, is leading the
conference in blocks with 1.51 per game. Nnamani,
who needs just 14 more kills to notch her 1,500th ca
reer kill, will be on the attack for the Cardinal.

Junior outside hitter Leahi Hall reaches for a serve. Stanford will close out
its season at home this weekend against Oregon and Oregon State.
