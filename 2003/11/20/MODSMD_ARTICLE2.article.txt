# Law may keep Cordell off council
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
LaDoris Cordell, vice provost of campus re
lations, may still take her seat on the Palo Alto
City Council in January as planned, if state leg
islatures can change an obscure state law that
has thrown into question the legality of her
new position.
According to Section 1090 of the govern
ment code, city councils may not sign contracts
with companies for which city council mem
bers work. Since Cordell is a Stanford employ
ee, her presence on the council could disrupt
any business the city wishes to conduct with
Stanford, sources say.
Stanford holds numerous contracts with the
city of Palo Aho, including agreements for fire
department and utility services, the develop
ment of the shopping center and transporta
tion. The latest negotiations revolve around a
set of Stanford soccer fields on El Camino
Real that the city would like to use.
"[Cordell] can accept the seat and take of
fice the first of January, but the city would not
be able to contract with Stanford in any way

until the legislation were passed, and if it does
not pass then the city would be unable to con
tract with Stanford unless she were to resign,"
said Bill Mayfield, Palo Alto senior assistant
city attorney.
Cordell was elected to the city council on
Nov. 4, beating out seven other candidates de
spite a campaign budget of only $3,000.
The problematic issue of the Section 1090
government code was raised only days before
the election, according to Mayfield, and con
firmed a few days after the election. Palo Alto
Vice Mayor Bern Beecham announced the
problem at last Monday's city council meeting.
"I was certainly shocked to learn about
this," Cordell said. "I have spent considerable
time campaigning since July."
"Had I known this was the case, I would not
have run," she continued. "I will be devastated
if I cannot take office after so many people vol
unteered with my campaign."
The law has been around since 1851. May
field said "the purpose of the law is to prevent
someone from having divided loyalties, having
a financial interest in some entity that is con
tracting with the city at the same time they're

sitting on the city council or acting as a city em
ployee. It's to prevent the attempt to serve two
masters."
According to the law, the city would not be
able to enter into a new contract with Stanford
while Cordell served on the council, although
it is unclear whether or not the city may enter
into contract negotiations. Due to conflict-of
interest concerns, Cordell anticipated not par
ticipating in discussions or votes on matters
that related to Stanford, but said that "this is
not conflict-of interest, this is something en
tirely different. This particular code says that if
I were to sit on the city council, the council
would not be able to do business with Stanford
at all."
The problem was not anticipated because
Stanford employees, and people affiliated with
the University, have commonly held seats on
the city council. In this particular case, though,
Cordell is not exempt from the law.
An exemption exists for University employ
ees who have worked at Stanford for three or
more years, a mark Cordell will not reach until
