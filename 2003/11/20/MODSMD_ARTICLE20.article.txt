Wrestling Endowment Fund Established
The Stanford wrestling team received a major boost in
its quest to establish itself as a Pac-10 power yesterday
when the Stanford Department of Athletics announced
the establishment of the Vern Jones Wrestling Program
Endowment Fund.
The operating endowment, effective immediately,
will enable the Cardinal to travel to more competitions
throughout the season and will help improve and expand
the team's recruiting efforts.
Former Stanford wrestling standout Vern Jones, who
graduated in 1950 and did not lose a regular season match
during his career on the Farm, established the fund.
"He truly appreciated every, aspect of his collegiate
wrestling experience," said Stanford head coach Steve
Buddie. "His generous gift has now opened the door of op
portunity to many young wrestlers who hope to have that
same positive experience at Stanford. His gift has also lent
instant credibility to this aggressive and highly important
endowment campaign. We are forever grateful for Vern
Jones' lifelong relationship with Stanford Wrestling."
Stanford Director of Wrestling Chris Horpel, who
coached the Cardinal from 1980-2001, summed up the
importance of Jones' endowment:
"When your program becomes financially self-suffi
cient, the coach and his staff can turn their focus to coach

ing, recruiting, marketing and developing a better prod
uct for everyone."
The Cardinal competed at San Francisco State last
night and the team travels to Fullerton for the California
Open this Saturday.
Volleyball Inks Two

tent by Matt Ceran and Joe Kay. Ceran attends Brent
wood High School in Los Angeles while Kay hails from
Tucson High School in Tucson, Ariz. Both highly touted
recruits will join the Cardinal for the 2005 season.
"With these two guys, we were able to really improve
ourselves for next season," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "They both have size and are very athletic.
Both of these players are very good players and we are

happy to have them join us."
Volleyball Magazine listed Ceran, a member of the
USA Volleyball 2003 Boys' Youth National Team, as
one of "Top 25 Underclassmen to Watch" earlier this
year. Kay led the state of Arizona in kills last year with
over 550 for the season and holds the Tucson High
School record for most kills in a game with 33.
"Matt was probably one of the most highly recruited
players in the country," Shaw said. "He could have his
choice of any number of schools, but we are certainly glad
that he chose Stanford. He should be able to come in and
help us right away at middle blocker and opposite hitter."

Wrestling Endowment Fund Established
The Stanford wrestling team received a major boost in
its quest to establish itself as a Pac-10 power yesterday
when the Stanford Department of Athletics announced
the establishment of the Vern Jones Wrestling Program
Endowment Fund.
The operating endowment, effective immediately,
will enable the Cardinal to travel to more competitions
throughout the season and will help improve and expand
the team's recruiting efforts.
Former Stanford wrestling standout Vern Jones, who
graduated in 1950 and did not lose a regular season match
during his career on the Farm, established the fund.
"He truly appreciated every, aspect of his collegiate
wrestling experience," said Stanford head coach Steve
Buddie. "His generous gift has now opened the door of op
portunity to many young wrestlers who hope to have that
same positive experience at Stanford. His gift has also lent
instant credibility to this aggressive and highly important
endowment campaign. We are forever grateful for Vern
Jones' lifelong relationship with Stanford Wrestling."
Stanford Director of Wrestling Chris Horpel, who
coached the Cardinal from 1980-2001, summed up the
importance of Jones' endowment:
"When your program becomes financially self-suffi
cient, the coach and his staff can turn their focus to coach

ing, recruiting, marketing and developing a better prod
uct for everyone."
The Cardinal competed at San Francisco State last
night and the team travels to Fullerton for the California
Open this Saturday.
Volleyball Inks Two
The Stanford University men's volleyball team an
nounced yesterday the signing of national letters of in
tent by Matt Ceran and Joe Kay. Ceran attends Brent
wood High School in Los Angeles while Kay hails from
Tucson High School in Tucson, Ariz. Both highly touted
recruits will join the Cardinal for the 2005 season.
"With these two guys, we were able to really improve
ourselves for next season," said Stanford head coach
Don Shaw. "They both have size and are very athletic.
Both of these players are very good players and we are

happy to have them join us."
Volleyball Magazine listed Ceran, a member of the
USA Volleyball 2003 Boys' Youth National Team, as
one of "Top 25 Underclassmen to Watch" earlier this
year. Kay led the state of Arizona in kills last year with
over 550 for the season and holds the Tucson High
School record for most kills in a game with 33.
"Matt was probably one of the most highly recruited
players in the country," Shaw said. "He could have his
choice of any number of schools, but we are certainly glad
that he chose Stanford. He should be able to come in and
help us right away at middle blocker and opposite hitter."
