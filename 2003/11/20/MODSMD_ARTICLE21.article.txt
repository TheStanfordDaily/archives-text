# Local JC breeds standout Cal football players

### KATHERINE MITCHELL DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — The Chico area is
known for breeding good beer and good parties. But who
knew it bred good football players, too?
Right next to Chico, in tiny Oroville, Calif., lies Butte
College — a junior college football powerhouse that has
been churning out top-notch Division I players for years,
but has remained relatively unknown to the greater pop
ulation of college football fans.
At a time when blue-chip high school recruits gener
ate all the big collegiate buzz, it's hard for any junior col
lege, let alone Butte, to get the kind of recognition it de
serves.
Without Butte College, however, the California Bears
wouldn't have either starting quarterback Aaron
Rodgers or tight end Garrett Cross, without whom, it
goes without saying, the team wouldn't be where it is
today.

Though merely a candidate for the job of starting
quarterback at the beginning of the season, Rodgers has,
since winning game five against Illinois, managed to etch
a small place for himself in the Cal record books.
He ranks seventh on the Bears' all-time pass efficiency
list and 15th on the all-time list for passing yards in a sea
son, despite not being named starter until the game
against the Illini.
Though Cross is now out with a broken leg, he suc
cessfully tackled the daunting task of filling the void left
by Tom Swoboda, last year's Pac-10 leader in most re
ceptions and touchdowns for a tight end.
While neither Cross nor Rodgers was recruited
straight out of high school, their respective tenures at
Butte provided them with just enough exposure and
growth to solidify promising careers in Division I football
— something the Butte program specializes in providing
for its players.
This year alone, Butte has 24 former players compet
ing for Division I teams.

The school boasts 11 alums who currently play in the
NFL or CFL — among them is Larry Allen of the Dallas
Cowboys, who was named to the NFL's All-Decade
Team of the 1990's as an offensive lineman.
Head coach Craig Rigsbee is the reason Rodgers be
lieves the program has been so successful at feeding its
players to D-I schools.
"He's great at getting players to the next level," says
Rodgers. "I knew I would get into a Division I school
playing for him."
Rigsbee's specialty is developing high-caliber players,
such as Rodgers and Cross, who may not have been re
cruited in high school but had the potential to eventually
make it to an NCAA power.
"We look for kids who maybe didn't get the exposure
in high school they needed, as in Aaron's case, or kids
who still needed to grow or gain a little more weight, as in
Garrett's case," Rigsbee said. "Once they're here we do
