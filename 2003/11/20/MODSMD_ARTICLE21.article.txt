# Local JC breeds standout Cal football players
## 
### KATHERINE MITCHELL DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — The Chico area is
known for breeding good beer and good parties. But who
knew it bred good football players, too?
Right next to Chico, in tiny Oroville, Calif., lies Butte
College — a junior college football powerhouse that has
been churning out top-notch Division I players for years,
but has remained relatively unknown to the greater pop
ulation of college football fans.
At a time when blue-chip high school recruits gener
ate all the big collegiate buzz, it's hard for any junior col
lege, let alone Butte, to get the kind of recognition it de
serves.
Without Butte College, however, the California Bears
wouldn't have either starting quarterback Aaron
Rodgers or tight end Garrett Cross, without whom, it
goes without saying, the team wouldn't be where it is
today.

Though merely a candidate for the job of starting
quarterback at the beginning of the season, Rodgers has,
since winning game five against Illinois, managed to etch
a small place for himself in the Cal record books.
He ranks seventh on the Bears' all-time pass efficiency
list and 15th on the all-time list for passing yards in a sea
son, despite not being named starter until the game
against the Illini.
Though Cross is now out with a broken leg, he suc
cessfully tackled the daunting task of filling the void left
by Tom Swoboda, last year's Pac-10 leader in most re
ceptions and touchdowns for a tight end.
While neither Cross nor Rodgers was recruited
straight out of high school, their respective tenures at
Butte provided them with just enough exposure and
growth to solidify promising careers in Division I football
— something the Butte program specializes in providing
for its players.
This year alone, Butte has 24 former players compet
ing for Division I teams.

The school boasts 11 alums who currently play in the
NFL or CFL — among them is Larry Allen of the Dallas
Cowboys, who was named to the NFL's All-Decade
Team of the 1990's as an offensive lineman.
Head coach Craig Rigsbee is the reason Rodgers be
lieves the program has been so successful at feeding its
players to D-I schools.
"He's great at getting players to the next level," says
Rodgers. "I knew I would get into a Division I school
playing for him."
Rigsbee's specialty is developing high-caliber players,
such as Rodgers and Cross, who may not have been re
cruited in high school but had the potential to eventually
make it to an NCAA power.
"We look for kids who maybe didn't get the exposure
in high school they needed, as in Aaron's case, or kids
who still needed to grow or gain a little more weight, as in
Garrett's case," Rigsbee said. "Once they're here we do
everything we possibly can to make
sure they get recruited by bigger
schools."
Given that he's been around the
program for 20 years helps this pro
cess.
" I've developed very good rela
tionships with a lot of coaches over
the years, and since our kids do so
well we have earned a really good
reputation," Rigsbee said.
The players consistently improve
and perform year in and year out be
cause of the type of team environ
ment Rigsbee creates.
"It's such a great atmosphere to play
in," Rodgers said. "The team is like
one big family."
Rigsbee likes to recruit players from
all over the country instead of just

locally, as many community colleges
tend to do, as well as bring in players
of all ages and backgrounds.
"We had a really diverse team
last year — we had guys from the
ages of 18 all the way to 26," Rodgers
said.
Rigsbee's statistics not only back up
his ability to churn out top-notch
players, but are a testament to his
coaching gifts as well.
As head coach he has amassed a
remarkable 102-22-2 record, and has
sent nine squads to conference
championship games.
Last year, Rodgers and Cross led
the Roadrunners to a 10-1 record, a
NorCal Conference championship,
and a No. 2 national ranking among
junior colleges.
"It's a great place and a great
program," Cal coach Jeff Tedford
said. "Our two guys from there have
really made a difference."
Although Tedford doesn't nor

mally like to recruit from junior col
leges, circumstances at the end of
last season required it.
"We had to look at them moreso
this year because we had a lot of
holes we needed to fill right away,"
Tedford said.
Cross was recruited last year after
Rigsbee, knowing Cal direly needed
to fill the tight end spot, sent the
coaches some tapes.
"They liked what they saw of
Garrett, and started asking what our
quarterback situation was," Rigsbee
said.
Though Rigsbee says it's an un
written rule that college coaches
don't recruit freshmen from junior
colleges, he says he encouraged Cal
to go ahead and recruit Rodgers.
"I told them I was definitely will
ing to let him go," Rigsbee said.
"There was no absolutely no ques
tion in my mind that Aaron and Gar
rett would succeed [at Cal]."

lege, let alone Butte, to get the kind of recognition it de
serves.
Without Butte College, however, the California Bears
wouldn't have either starting quarterback Aaron
Rodgers or tight end Garrett Cross, without whom, it
goes without saying, the team wouldn't be where it is
today.

Though merely a candidate for the job of starting
quarterback at the beginning of the season, Rodgers has,
since winning game five against Illinois, managed to etch
a small place for himself in the Cal record books.
He ranks seventh on the Bears' all-time pass efficiency
list and 15th on the all-time list for passing yards in a sea
son, despite not being named starter until the game
against the Illini.
Though Cross is now out with a broken leg, he suc
cessfully tackled the daunting task of filling the void left
by Tom Swoboda, last year's Pac-10 leader in most re
ceptions and touchdowns for a tight end.
While neither Cross nor Rodgers was recruited
straight out of high school, their respective tenures at
Butte provided them with just enough exposure and
growth to solidify promising careers in Division I football
— something the Butte program specializes in providing
for its players.
This year alone, Butte has 24 former players compet
ing for Division I teams.

The school boasts 11 alums who currently play in the
NFL or CFL — among them is Larry Allen of the Dallas
Cowboys, who was named to the NFL's All-Decade
Team of the 1990's as an offensive lineman.
Head coach Craig Rigsbee is the reason Rodgers be
lieves the program has been so successful at feeding its
players to D-I schools.
"He's great at getting players to the next level," says
Rodgers. "I knew I would get into a Division I school
playing for him."
Rigsbee's specialty is developing high-caliber players,
such as Rodgers and Cross, who may not have been re
cruited in high school but had the potential to eventually
make it to an NCAA power.
"We look for kids who maybe didn't get the exposure
in high school they needed, as in Aaron's case, or kids
who still needed to grow or gain a little more weight, as in
Garrett's case," Rigsbee said. "Once they're here we do
everything we possibly can to make
sure they get recruited by bigger
schools."
Given that he's been around the
program for 20 years helps this pro
cess.
" I've developed very good rela
tionships with a lot of coaches over
the years, and since our kids do so
well we have earned a really good
reputation," Rigsbee said.
The players consistently improve
and perform year in and year out be
cause of the type of team environ
ment Rigsbee creates.
"It's such a great atmosphere to play
in," Rodgers said. "The team is like
one big family."
Rigsbee likes to recruit players from
all over the country instead of just

locally, as many community colleges
tend to do, as well as bring in players
of all ages and backgrounds.
"We had a really diverse team
last year — we had guys from the
ages of 18 all the way to 26," Rodgers
said.
Rigsbee's statistics not only back up
his ability to churn out top-notch
players, but are a testament to his
coaching gifts as well.
As head coach he has amassed a
remarkable 102-22-2 record, and has
sent nine squads to conference
championship games.
Last year, Rodgers and Cross led
the Roadrunners to a 10-1 record, a
NorCal Conference championship,
and a No. 2 national ranking among
junior colleges.
"It's a great place and a great
program," Cal coach Jeff Tedford
said. "Our two guys from there have
really made a difference."
Although Tedford doesn't nor

mally like to recruit from junior col
leges, circumstances at the end of
last season required it.
"We had to look at them moreso
this year because we had a lot of
holes we needed to fill right away,"
Tedford said.
Cross was recruited last year after
Rigsbee, knowing Cal direly needed
to fill the tight end spot, sent the
coaches some tapes.
"They liked what they saw of
Garrett, and started asking what our
quarterback situation was," Rigsbee
said.
Though Rigsbee says it's an un
written rule that college coaches
don't recruit freshmen from junior
colleges, he says he encouraged Cal
to go ahead and recruit Rodgers.
"I told them I was definitely will
ing to let him go," Rigsbee said.
"There was no absolutely no ques
tion in my mind that Aaron and Gar
rett would succeed [at Cal]."
