# Milgrom favors bi-national state
## 
### JESSICA DANIEL 
Drawing from his experience liv
ing in Jerusalem and heading vari
ous initiatives for peace and cooper
ation between Jews and Arabs,
Rabbi Jeremy Milgrom delivered a
lecture last night in Tresidder
Union's Cypress Room, advocating
non-violence and a bi-national state
as solutions to the Arab-Israeli con
flict.
Milgrom was introduced by
Rabbi Patricia Karlin-Neumann, se
nior associate dean for religious life,
who outlined his current work as the
Director of Rabbis for Human
Rights, and his past positions as
Founder and Executive Director of
Clergy for Peace, and Director of the
Arab / Jewish Project at the Hebrew
University Hillel. Kalin-Neumann
described Milgrom as both an "ac
tivist and a philosopher."
The talk entitled "Judaism, Zion
ism, and Non-Violence" was co
sponsored by the Office for Reli
gious Life, the Department of Reli
gious Studies, the Urban Studies
Program, the MLK Papers Project,
and Hillel.
Milgrom drew from traditional
Jewish texts to support his assertion
of a non-violent Jewish identity. His
training as a rabbi made him espe
cially aware of nuances in Jewish re
ligious texts that provided justifica
tion for this interpretation. His
translations included one passage on
the Jewish definition of courage.
"It's a statement of harmony,"
Milgrom said. "It's as far from a
statement of predation and aggres
sion as can be. We should be merci
ful, bashful, and generous. These are
the three attributes we are educating
for, essential to the Jewish identity."
He next examined the conflict be
tween the modern Jewish culture's
focus on land and people versus tra
ditional Jewish culture's focus on
God. He concentrated on one pas
sage from the Siddur, the Jewish

prayer book, which had been cor
rupted from its original.
"The prayer said 'Joy to our land
and our city,' versus the original which
said 'your land and your city, meaning
God's land and God's city,' " Milgrom
explained. "Maybe it's just a slight nu
ance that restores my faith, but this is
one."
Milgrom's text-based arguments
eventually culminated in a contro
versial stance against Zionism — Is
raeli promotion and feelings of enti
tlement to a Jewish state. He de
clared adamantly that Zionism was
not necessarily supported by Ju
daism.
"How have we put the notion of
Israel as a state into the center of our
religion?" Milgrom posed. "I don't
feel there's any sanctity in this. I
could definitely see us evolving into
a bi-national state. It's not clear to
me that the answer to the Holocaust
is a Jewish state."
The one-hour lecture was fol
lowed by a 30-minute question and
answer session. Most of the audience
seemed to agree with Milgrom's atti
tudes, although some challenged
him to be more specific in identifying
concrete steps to lead to change.
In his answers, Milgrom asserted
the importance of engagement
rather than separation between the
Jewish and Palestinian communities.
"It's a very small percentage of
Jews who have encountered the
other side," Milgrom said. "To most
of them, [the Palestinians] are a mys
tery. It's necessary for Jews to go
over there and meet the people."
Sophomore Carla Fenves saw po
tential in Milgrom's proposal for
peace.
"He brings a different voice than
we usually hear on campus, one that
combines serious religious thought
with a realistic and active peace
movement in Israel," she said.
Senior Lizzi Heydemann agreed,
but noted Milgrom's own uncertain
ty about moves toward peace in the

near future.
"He brought up the idea of a bi
national state as being possibly the
ideal situation for Jews and Pales
tinians in the coming years, which is
something that at this point is con
sidered on the far left," Heyde
mann said. "But in the way he de
scribed it, it sounds much more rea
sonable, legitimate, possible and

likely. Despite all that, he did not
sound optimistic about Israel in the
near future, which will pose a chal
lenge."
Milgrom concluded the discus
sion by stating his personal mission.
"I want to give some people a vi
sion, an option, a choice," he said.
"Every victory for non-violence is a
victory for us in Israel."

combines serious religious thought
with a realistic and active peace
movement in Israel," she said.
Senior Lizzi Heydemann agreed,
but noted Milgrom's own uncertain
ty about moves toward peace in the

near future.
"He brought up the idea of a bi
national state as being possibly the
ideal situation for Jews and Pales
tinians in the coming years, which is
something that at this point is con
sidered on the far left," Heyde
mann said. "But in the way he de
scribed it, it sounds much more rea
sonable, legitimate, possible and

likely. Despite all that, he did not
sound optimistic about Israel in the
near future, which will pose a chal
lenge."
Milgrom concluded the discus
sion by stating his personal mission.
"I want to give some people a vi
sion, an option, a choice," he said.
"Every victory for non-violence is a
victory for us in Israel."
