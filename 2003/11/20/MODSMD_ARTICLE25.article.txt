# Stanford takes part in Hillel Challenge
## 
### RENEE HUDSON 
In an effort to aid families in southern
California who lost their homes in the
fires that raged through the region last
month, Stanford is helping raise money
for the Weinberg Tzedek Hillel Chal
lenge, a national charity event.
, Across the nation, the Challenge's par
ticipants will attempt to get 100 schools to
agree to raise $180 apiece for a total do
nation of $18,000. Other schools that have
joined the Challenge include Amherst
College, Columbia University and several
University of California schools.
"When I heard about this challenge to
Hillels across the country, I thought that
as a California school many students were
affected by the crisis directly or indirect

ly and would want to give to the cause,"
said Daniel Greene, president of Stan
ford's Jewish Leadership Council.
Greene plans to continue raising
money by asking for dorm funds.
"It felt so strange being at Stanford the
whole time, so removed from the situa
tion," said Danica Lomeli, whose home
town of Rancho Cucamonga, Calif, was
affected by the fires. "Maybe the magni
tude of the disaster will hit me when I go
home for Thanksgiving and see how my
town has changed."
The money that the Challenge raises
will be given as a whole to the Jewish
Community Disaster Fund, which will al
locate the money to all families who lost a
home in the fires. Each participating
school will be listed as a donor.

Sophomore Patricia Romero was home
in San Diego during the fires.
"There were fires literally two to three
miles from our house," she said. "Fire
fighters actually came to our house to tell
us we might have to do a voluntary evacu
ation."
Her home, situated next to a reservoir,
was saved from the fire as it only reached
the opposite bank.
"I can't believe people lost their
homes, lost everything," she said. "It's re
ally cool that people are setting up funds
for those people."
Lomeli agreed: "It's incredible that
they are trying to reach out to those who
have lost their homes in the fires."
Students who wish to contribute may
visit Hillel or contact Daniel Greene.
