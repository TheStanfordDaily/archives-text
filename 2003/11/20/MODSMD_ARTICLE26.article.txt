## Fewer men choose to attend college

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — Berkeley High School senior Chris
Carlisle isn't planning to apply to University of California-Berkeley this year.
In fact, he's not sending any applications to college.
"I want to be a firefighter," Carlisle said. "I just ain't thought about college."
Carlisle's decision reflects a growing national trend — fewer men are
choosing to go to college, and now make up just under 44 percent of students
enrolled in degree-granting institutions across the country.
With this phenomenon, UC Berkeley's gender gap has reversed. At 54 per
cent of the college-age student body, women outnumber men in every ethnic
group except among whites.
But among minorities, the gap is extreme. Of about 1,200 black students at
Berkeley this fall, nearly 800 are women. Asian-American females outnumber
Asian-American males by more than 1,000.
Lynda Tredway, an instructor at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Ed
ucation, said the college gender gap stems from racial perceptions and low K
12 performance for males.
"There's a racial dimension in the classroom that is unavoidable," Tredway
said. "Teachers 'adultify' the behavior of African-American and Hispanic
males. They are not seen as just boys, but feared as men."
Few black and Latino males take all courses required for UC entrance. Last
year, more than twice as many Asian-American male graduates completed the
required courses as compared to black and Latino students, according to the
department.
The trend of low K-12 performance for boys carries over into college appli
cations. Tens of thousands more female than male high school students took
the SATs last fall in California.
Last year, thousands more women applied to UC Berkeley than men.
Women made up three-quarters of all Latino applicants to UC Berkeley. Black
female applicants outnumbered males by more than 400.
While women nationwide have found ways around long-standing race and
class barriers, studies suggest such obstacles are still holding men back.
And although low performance in high school may explain the small num
ber of black and Latino male college applicants, it remains unclear why a gen
der gap exists among Asian-Americans, experts say.
Theories about why some minority males perform poorly in school are as
abundant as the solutions offered, said Lisa Kala, a lecturer in the Graduate
School of Education.
