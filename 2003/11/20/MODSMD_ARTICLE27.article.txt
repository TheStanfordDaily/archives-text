# 'Rich Girls' star 'smarter than she seems'
## 
### REBECCA ARONAUER COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK — Barnard freshman Jaime Gleicher is
smarter than she seems on TV.
Gleicher and best friend forever Ally Hilfiger are the stars and pro
ducers of MTV's new reality TV show, "Rich Girls." The show docu
ments their summer after high school graduation and Gleicher's first
week at Barnard.
The young producers hoped that "Rich Girls" would show the real
problems of the young and wealthy. But like all reality TV, nothing in
Rich Girls seems real — especially their problems. Typical high school
issues like rejection and failed fornication at the prom can be solved by
trips to private homes in the British West Indies or Nantucket.
And as if owning several vacation homes didn't make the rich girls
seem different already, the show's Web site drives the message home
with a section called "Reality Check: Us vs. Them." Using puns like
"Rich girls live on Park Ave. ... We live in a trailer park," the Reality
Check demonstrates the disparity between the ultra-wealthy and MTV's
basic cable demographic.
A wealthy Barnard student on national television whose only con
cerns appear to be fashion and boys reinforces a negative perception of
the school, according to Barnard sophomore Kate Lundberg.
"I don't think it helps Barnard's image," she said. "People stereotype
Barnard already as a bunch of rich girls."
Hate them for their getaway house, but Gleicher and Hilfiger, who
are graduates of The Professional Children's High School in New York
City, are, after all, the creators and producers of a nationally televised
program.
The two have been involved in acting and producing for most of their
lives. Gleicher was in Rent on Broadway through her work with Broad
way Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. When Hilfiger — daughter of fashion
designer Tommy Hilfiger — was 13, she was in Abby's Song on Broad
way, and at 17 she produced Proud, a movie starring Ossie Davis.
Thinking their own lifestyle to be interesting, they wanted to create a
reality show about privileged New York City private school students.
When they couldn't find similarly well-off young people who were com
fortable exposing their lives, Gleicher and Hilfiger turned the camera on
themselves. They created a pilot by having camcorders follow them
around while hanging out — read: "shopping" — in the city. Gleicher

sent the pitch to MTV. The rest is reality TV history.
As a producer, Gleicher has final approval over all eight episodes, but
not over the web content that mocks her or the title that typecasts her
and Hilfiger.
Yet Gleicher is undeterred by MTV's petty jokes. "I have to under
stand from a marketing standpoint what works," she said. She also ad
mitted that producing her life is bizarre, but tries not to take it too seri
ously: "[Rich Girls] is a comedy — it's a lighthearted show."
Still, Gleicher believes her farcical show is deeper than its vapid title
suggests.
"This is a show, more so than about money, about friendships," she
said.
Contrary to MTV's "Reality Check," Gleicher lives on a low floor
of the Quad with her fellow Barnard first-years. She is more normal
than MTV's editing implies, except for the fact that she likes all of her
classes. Outside of campus, Gleicher has been arranging all the pub
he relations for her show, writing her first novel, and working with
multiple sclerosis charities. Next semester she hopes to do musical
theater.
Even without a view of the park from her room, Gleicher said, "I love
Barnard. I'm pretty obsessed with it, actually."
All of her floormates watch "Rich Girls," but they see a distinction
between the Gleicher MTV presents and the Gleicher with whom they
share a bathroom.
Barnard freshman Brett Murphy lives across the hall from Gleicher
and watches her on TV every week. After getting to know Gleicher,
Murphy said, "I don't associate her with the girl on the show."
In the second episode of "Rich Girls," Gleicher said that Benjamin
Franklin invented the telephone, but her classmate and floormate, Sarah
Waxman thinks it was just a blunder.
"I think she's very intelligent and she has lot of things to add to class,"
Waxman said.
Gleicher told her roommate Amanda Cardinale about the show be
fore move-in day. In anticipation of the cameras, Cardinale admitted, "I
labored over what I was going to wear." Cardinale will appear on MTV
in December, along with Gleicher's orientation experience and her first
day of college classes.
After living together for a week of filming and three months of col
lege life, Cardinale said, "In knowing Jaime as my roommate, I've be
come extremely proud in her succeeding. It takes a lot of guts."
