# GSB Prof, uncovers trading scam

### ALBERT CHIOU 
Eric Zitzewitz, assistant professor of strategic
management at the Graduate School of Busi
ness, began researching the pricing of mutual
funds in 1999 after observing peculiar trends in
his own investments. That research has now
thrust him into the spotlight because of a gov
ernment investigation into abuses in the mutual
fund industry.
In the study, Zitzewitz found long-term mu
tual fund investors are losing money because of
the prevalence of certain kinds of trading abus
es. These abuses consist of short-term traders
using mutual funds' once-a-day pricing to their
advantage and taking profits away from average
shareholders. The tactics, called time-zone or
stale-price arbitrage, exploit the practice of
American and foreign markets pricing their
stocks at different times, and that performance
in one market is highly suggestive of perfor
mance in another, giving unscrupulous traders
an edge in being able to predict how the price of
a mutual fund will be affected by the time it is
priced the next day.
Short-term investors can buy and sell these
mutual funds quickly, making a sizable profit
and stripping long-term traders of their earn
ings. Zitzewitz found that investors using
these tactics could outperform other share
holders by 35 to 75 percent. He quantified the
damages inflicted upon long-term mutual
fund investors in this manner at $5 billion a
year.
"My formulas are being used to calculate the
harm to investors," said Zitzewitz, who is teach
ing at the Columbia Graduate School of Busi
ness for this academic year.
In July, Zitzewitz was contacted by David D.

Brown IV, an investigator working for New
York attorney general Eliot Spitzer, who is the
head of the government probe into mutual fund
abuses. Brown had come across Zitzewitz's
work in the course of his investigation and said
he found the research extremely informative.
After Eliot Spitzer cited Zitzewitz's study on
Sept. 3, during the investigation's first news con
ference, he became recognized as an expert in

mutual fund abuses. Since then, Zitzewitz has
continued to consult with investigators and has
been called upon to testify before the House of
Representatives' Financial Services Capital
Markets Subcommittee.
The committee has not yet formulated a de
finitive plan of action, but, Zitzewitz said, "I
hope [my research has] contributed to their un
derstanding of the issues."
