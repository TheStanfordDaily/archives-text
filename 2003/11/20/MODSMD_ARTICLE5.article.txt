# Childcare options may expand
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
A week from Tuesday, the Graduate Student
Council student and post-doctoral child care sub
committee will meet with Provost John Etchemendy
to continue discussion on how to better offer afford
able child care options.
The upcoming meeting is the latest of several ad
vocacy efforts of the WorkLife Office and the GSC,
including a possible contract with an online database
of child care providers called Enhanced Resource
and Referral Services.
Teresa Rasco, director of the WorkLife Office,
described the new service as an actual database that
matches student profiles to available spaces in child
care.
The database is currently used by large Bay Area
companies such as Intel, according to Sharon Barr, a
postdoctoral candidate in medical pharmacology
and a participant in the child-care committee.
A similar Web-based service is presently avail
able to Stanford faculty and staff, but only to find
emergency or back-up care.
Extending continuous database services to grad
uate and postdoctoral students would "allow par
ents to pre-screen the facilities in the target area,"
Barr said, and would link parents more easily with
viable child care providers.
It would also include an interactive web site
where students can post about, and search for, their
specific child-care needs. By expanding upon Parent
Net, a list-serve presently used by the community, it
could better address the demand for proximity and

flexibility in child-care.
Rasco estimates that there are at least 300 gradu
ate student families living in Escondido Village. The
numbers of students with children living off campus
may easily match or surpass this number, though
there is no way to count them through University
registration information.
At the WorkLife Office, students can find a
wealth of information on child-care options and
other resources "in navigating the competing de
mands of their work, study, personal and family
lives," according to its mission statement.
However, in Barr's experience, good child-care is
still hard to come by. Long waiting lists, a paucity of
advertisements, and the importance of word of
mouth all limit the reliability of day care centers,
while "students and post-docs can't possibly afford
an in-home nanny," she said.
Barr added that there are three child-care centers
currently on campus, open to all students and staff.
These include the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, the Stanford Arboretum Children's
Center, and Knowledge Beginnings at Stanford
West apartments.
However, the high cost of these centers, com
pounded with their limited infant spaces and prefer
ence for siblings of current enrollees, often makes
them inaccessible to more transient Stanford stu
dents, compared to faculty members who have been
using them for years.
According to Rasco, about 18-20 percent of par
