# Childcare options may expand
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
A week from Tuesday, the Graduate Student
Council student and post-doctoral child care sub
committee will meet with Provost John Etchemendy
to continue discussion on how to better offer afford
able child care options.
The upcoming meeting is the latest of several ad
vocacy efforts of the WorkLife Office and the GSC,
including a possible contract with an online database
of child care providers called Enhanced Resource
and Referral Services.
Teresa Rasco, director of the WorkLife Office,
described the new service as an actual database that
matches student profiles to available spaces in child
care.
The database is currently used by large Bay Area
companies such as Intel, according to Sharon Barr, a
postdoctoral candidate in medical pharmacology
and a participant in the child-care committee.
A similar Web-based service is presently avail
able to Stanford faculty and staff, but only to find
emergency or back-up care.
Extending continuous database services to grad
uate and postdoctoral students would "allow par
ents to pre-screen the facilities in the target area,"
Barr said, and would link parents more easily with
viable child care providers.
It would also include an interactive web site
where students can post about, and search for, their
specific child-care needs. By expanding upon Parent
Net, a list-serve presently used by the community, it
could better address the demand for proximity and

flexibility in child-care.
Rasco estimates that there are at least 300 gradu
ate student families living in Escondido Village. The
numbers of students with children living off campus
may easily match or surpass this number, though
there is no way to count them through University
registration information.
At the WorkLife Office, students can find a
wealth of information on child-care options and
other resources "in navigating the competing de
mands of their work, study, personal and family
lives," according to its mission statement.
However, in Barr's experience, good child-care is
still hard to come by. Long waiting lists, a paucity of
advertisements, and the importance of word of
mouth all limit the reliability of day care centers,
while "students and post-docs can't possibly afford
an in-home nanny," she said.
Barr added that there are three child-care centers
currently on campus, open to all students and staff.
These include the Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, the Stanford Arboretum Children's
Center, and Knowledge Beginnings at Stanford
West apartments.
However, the high cost of these centers, com
pounded with their limited infant spaces and prefer
ence for siblings of current enrollees, often makes
them inaccessible to more transient Stanford stu
dents, compared to faculty members who have been
using them for years.
According to Rasco, about 18-20 percent of par
ents using these resources are stu
dents. At Bing Nursery School in
Escondido Village, graduate and
postdoctoral students' children
comprise only 15 percent of its en
rollment.
Rasco identified family home
care — a less expensive and more
flexible model for child care, where
private homes are licensed to pro
vide care for more than one family
— as the most utilized resource for
students with children.
Enhanced Resource and Refer
ral Services could also provide a
database specific to family home
care. Expanding any child-care
database to meet graduate student
needs, Rasco said, "hits the target
of family home care that tends to be
more affordable."
Despite the University's grow
ing attention to the high cost of liv
ing in the Silicon Valley, child-care
affordability remains an issue par
ticular to the graduate and postdoc
toral communities at Stanford, ac
cording to Barr, who spends 40% of
her own gross salary on child-care.
She pointed out that while
grants of up to $5,000 are available
to offset child-care costs for faculty
and staff whose adjusted gross in
come does not exceed $125,000 a
year, "grad students and post-docs,
potentially the poorest members of
the academic community, are ex
cluded from this benefit."
"In the long term, we would like
to explore options for providing
[students with] cash subsidies for
child care, but it's not clear where
that kind of money would come
from," added Graduate Student
Council Chair Steve Allison, who
estimated a cost of around a couple
million dollars a year.
Rasco added that the costs of
on-campus infant child-care at
Stanford amount to $17,000 to
$18,000 per year, while even less

expensive family home care sets
parents back $600 to $1000 every
month.
She explained that as staff subsi
dies are funded through the bene
fits pool, subsidizing child-care for
those not employed by the Univer
sity would depend on locating an
other renewable source of money.
The child-care subcommittee, es
tablished back in 2000, has made
progress in surveying the current sta
tus of postdoctoral and graduate stu
dent child-care options, Rasco said.
Her work with the President, the
Provost, GSC members, and other
committee members has led Rasco to
believe that students will eventually
see results in some form of subsidies.
"The University administration
understands that [the child-care sit
uation] is very, very hard," she said,
applauding its members for care
fully listening to students' present
predicaments as Stanford parents.
The Dec. 2 meeting with
Etchemendy will allow "selected
students to share their child care ex
periences with the Provost so that
he can get some first-hand informa
tion about the challenges facing stu
dent parents," according to Allison.
Barr, who has been a parent for
two of her three years at Stanford,
acknowledged the importance of
voicing the concerns of all Stanford
parents to the University.
"It's true that students who
don't have children themselves
probably don't realize the chal
lenges involved in finding child
care," she said. "I didn't before I
had a child of my own."
Pointing to the "ripple effect" of
limited access to child-care, Rasco
suggested that the issue could af
fect productivity in the greater
Stanford community and in the
workplace.
She concluded that in upholding
the University's commitment to di
versity, students must not be de
nied "the opportunity to succeed
and reach full potential" because
they choose to assume a parenting
role at Stanford.
