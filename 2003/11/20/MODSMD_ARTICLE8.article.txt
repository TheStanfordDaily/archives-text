## Remember to stretch, says Vinni

So, I was going about my
business as usual, checking
my e-mail for messages
from my parents, friends or
angry professors, and low and be
hold I FINALLY got an e-mail
from you lazy bastards. Finally! Do
you know how hard it is to give sex
advice to people who aren't asking
for any? I can assure you it's a great
deal more difficult than writing a
three sentence e-mail asking for sex
advice. So no more of this. Remove
your lazy asses from off the couch
or your geeky asses from off your
desk chair and write me with a
question or else. Three easy letters

and the usual is all
you need to know:
vpi@stanford.edu.
My first letter
comes from Plato
who writes:
"So what's the
skinny on sex-re
lated injuries?
How can I avoid
soreness after a
long (long) night
of carnal eroticism

and / or a short few minutes of un
usual positioning? Are there pre
cautions I should take or warm-up
exercises I can do?"
Ah Plato, thank you so much
for writing and especially for using
the words "carnal eroticism" (why
didn't I think of that?). Before I
answer your question, allow me to
first compliment you and your
lucky whomever for not having 30-
second sex in the usual humdrum
position. When time permits, sex
should last a long, long time. Most
of you guys are young: Take ad
vantage of that and run the
marathon! Minutes are better than
seconds, hours are better than min
utes and, with the proper mindset
and more condoms than Michel
Jackson on Sunday afternoon in
Disney Land, days are better than
hours.
To answer your question, let me
first refer you to your middle
school gym teacher. Perhaps the
only useful thing you learned in
P.E. was how to stretch before
working out. Sex is no different
than running a marathon or work
ing out at the gym: You work out
most muscles in your body, sweat a
ton and, luckily enough, burn a
bunch of calories in the process. So
stretch out all your muscles before
sex, and when I say "all" I mean
ALL, especially the ones you're
gym teacher didn't tell you about,
well most of you anyway.
Prepare for sex like you would
for a long race; you want to drink
water so you don't get thirsty, not
eat too soon before and stretch so
you don't cramp up or feel sore af
terward. Also try working out so
that your muscles are in shape for
the great strain you hopefully are
putting them under. The only dif
ference between warming up for
sex and for a marathon is that you
might want to try and exercise your
sex-related muscles. Try to flex
them, it's weird but it's not that
hard. Flexing exercises will get
them in shape for your night and in
crease your ability to make your
partner squirm.
My next question comes from
Aristotle who asks: "Is there any
thing wrong with blatantly ordering
call girls up to your dorm room then
talking about the sex at dinner?"
First, let me ask: Is there a non
blatant way to ask a call girl up to
your dorm room? Maybe you
could e-mail her instead of calling
her. Either way, I think call girls,
hookers and any kind of escorts are
a waste of money. If they're girls
out there that would have sex with
inanimate objects, animals and rel
atives, there are girls out there that
would have sex with even you. And
for free (well, theoretically speak
ing anyway). More importantly, I
firmly believe that there's some
one out there for everyone, so get
off your lazy ass and find the per
son (then e-mail me with your sex
problems).

Are you a greek philosopher? Even
if you're not, E-mail your sex ques
tions to Vinni at vpi@stanford.edu.
