# Abra Cadabra Superstition Hocus Pocus

### KERRY E GRENS 
Though intended to heal and protect, superstitions may actually be
deadly. For centuries, people have practiced the idiosyncratic rituals of su
perstition: walking around ladders, leaping over sidewalk cracks, closing
umbrellas indoors and picking up pennies (only with heads up, of course).
Superstition is supposed to protect the superstitious, augment their luck and
allow them to prepare for the future. But the latest findings suggest that su
perstition can harm, and may be responsible for the dramatic increase in
traffic deaths on Friday the 13th. Is superstitious anxiety to blame for the
deaths, or could it be that Friday the 13th is simply a terribly unlucky day?
Dr. Nayha from the University of Oulu, Finland studied Friday traffic
deaths in Finland from 1971 to 1997 and found that, for women, the risk of
death increases by 63 percent on the 13th. No other day of the week or the
month is as dangerous. Nayha concludes that fear of Friday the 13th can in
hibit motor abilities, causing accidents. But a portion of the victims were
passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians, and it was never known whether the
victims were superstitious. Is it possible that the origins of superstitious be
havior are founded in truth?
According to Dr. Tricia Clement, a researcher in Stanford's Psychology
department, that is usually how a superstition begins: "An individual per
forms a behavior and later experiences a positive outcome. Despite the two
being coincidental and unrelated, the behavior persists with the expecta
tion of the same outcome." On the other hand, if someone places a hat on
a bed, and later that day his grandmother passes away, he assumes the hat
brought about the tragedy and refuses to put hats on beds.
This process to initiate a superstition is so simple that even pigeons ex
hibit "superstition." B. F. Skinner in 1948 described how pigeons would
adopt a repeated behavior, such as turning counter-clockwise or head-bob
bing, with the expectation of receiving food, even though food was pre
sented at regular intervals, independent of behavior. The birds simply as
sociated a particular behavior with the initial presentation of food and kept
trying to repeat the experience.
Maybe that's how the unlucky day began: Someone associated a bad
day with the date of Friday the 13th. The rumor spread that it was unlucky
to leave the house on Friday the 13th, and therefore, anything bad hap
pening on that day was attributable to the date.
In contrast to this theory, researchers at the Veteran's Medical Center
in San Diego and the University of Victoria in Canada do not believe that
superstitions are the result of a normal, healthy brain making hasty associ
ations between two events. Instead, Brugger, Dowdy and Graves suggest
that superstitions are due to a faulty hippocampus, the area of the brain
that determines the relationship between cause and effect.
If they are correct, then a shocking number of Americans may suffer
from hippocampal dysfunction. According to a 2000 Gallup Poll, more
than a quarter of Americans are superstitious, and the numbers are grow
ing among young Americans.
"I try not to be superstitious," said Biology graduate student Mike
MacPherson. "Being superstitious is believing something out of ignorance,
but ignorance causes so much pain in this world that it's perverse to court it."
Some superstitions were at one time rooted in necessity. One Amazo
nian tribe considers it unlucky for anyone except menstruating women to
eat turtles. According to Berry Brosi, a graduate student in the Center for,
Conservation Biology, "Limiting turtle consumption was an adaptive strat
egy to preserve food resources, but without bringing the deities into the
picture, the practice would not have been enforced."
"Superstitions can be helpful if they make you more cautious, such as
not walking under a ladder, but they can be harmful if they cause anxiety
or inefficiency," said student Vinita Kailasanath.
Superstition has also been associated with obsessive-compulsive disor
der, which is marked by irrational rituals and repetitive behavior.
Regardless of superstition's origins, it produces a significant change in
the behavior of the superstitious, which can have serious impacts on
healthcare. In Northern Ireland, for example, it is considered unlucky to
move on a Saturday, which is evident in the numbers of mothers discharged
from maternity wards in hospitals. On Saturdays, 35 percent fewer patients
than expected are discharged, whereas the numbers for Fridays and Sun
days are much higher. In Japan, the highest number of hospital discharges
occurs on Taian (a lucky day) and the lowest on Butsumetsu (an unlucky
day). Researchers estimate the cost of superstition to a single hospital in
Japan is tens of thousands of dollars per week.
With such an impact on hospital costs, superstition may become an issue
doctors must consider when working with patients.
"It's not a doctor's place to ridicule superstitions, as it will decrease
the trust their patients have in them, but doctors should also work to in
form their patients about the rational ways of the world," Kailasanath
said.
If superstition is to blame for traffic deaths on Friday the 13th, rational
consultation may prevent a large number of tragedies. And if Brugger,
Dowdy and Graves are correct, superstition may also serve as a lead to in
vestigate more serious neurological problems.
Until the biological origins and results of superstition are pinpointed,
the best advice for Friday the 13th — at least if you're a Finnish woman —
is to stay indoors.

department, that is usually how a superstition begins: "An individual per
forms a behavior and later experiences a positive outcome. Despite the two
being coincidental and unrelated, the behavior persists with the expecta
tion of the same outcome." On the other hand, if someone places a hat on
a bed, and later that day his grandmother passes away, he assumes the hat
brought about the tragedy and refuses to put hats on beds.
This process to initiate a superstition is so simple that even pigeons ex
hibit "superstition." B. F. Skinner in 1948 described how pigeons would
adopt a repeated behavior, such as turning counter-clockwise or head-bob
bing, with the expectation of receiving food, even though food was pre
sented at regular intervals, independent of behavior. The birds simply as
sociated a particular behavior with the initial presentation of food and kept
trying to repeat the experience.
Maybe that's how the unlucky day began: Someone associated a bad
day with the date of Friday the 13th. The rumor spread that it was unlucky
to leave the house on Friday the 13th, and therefore, anything bad hap
pening on that day was attributable to the date.
In contrast to this theory, researchers at the Veteran's Medical Center
in San Diego and the University of Victoria in Canada do not believe that
superstitions are the result of a normal, healthy brain making hasty associ
ations between two events. Instead, Brugger, Dowdy and Graves suggest
that superstitions are due to a faulty hippocampus, the area of the brain
that determines the relationship between cause and effect.
If they are correct, then a shocking number of Americans may suffer
from hippocampal dysfunction. According to a 2000 Gallup Poll, more
than a quarter of Americans are superstitious, and the numbers are grow
ing among young Americans.
"I try not to be superstitious," said Biology graduate student Mike
MacPherson. "Being superstitious is believing something out of ignorance,
but ignorance causes so much pain in this world that it's perverse to court it."
Some superstitions were at one time rooted in necessity. One Amazo
nian tribe considers it unlucky for anyone except menstruating women to
eat turtles. According to Berry Brosi, a graduate student in the Center for,
Conservation Biology, "Limiting turtle consumption was an adaptive strat
egy to preserve food resources, but without bringing the deities into the
picture, the practice would not have been enforced."
"Superstitions can be helpful if they make you more cautious, such as
not walking under a ladder, but they can be harmful if they cause anxiety
or inefficiency," said student Vinita Kailasanath.
Superstition has also been associated with obsessive-compulsive disor
der, which is marked by irrational rituals and repetitive behavior.
Regardless of superstition's origins, it produces a significant change in
the behavior of the superstitious, which can have serious impacts on
healthcare. In Northern Ireland, for example, it is considered unlucky to
move on a Saturday, which is evident in the numbers of mothers discharged
from maternity wards in hospitals. On Saturdays, 35 percent fewer patients
than expected are discharged, whereas the numbers for Fridays and Sun
days are much higher. In Japan, the highest number of hospital discharges
occurs on Taian (a lucky day) and the lowest on Butsumetsu (an unlucky
day). Researchers estimate the cost of superstition to a single hospital in
Japan is tens of thousands of dollars per week.
With such an impact on hospital costs, superstition may become an issue
doctors must consider when working with patients.
"It's not a doctor's place to ridicule superstitions, as it will decrease
the trust their patients have in them, but doctors should also work to in
form their patients about the rational ways of the world," Kailasanath
said.
If superstition is to blame for traffic deaths on Friday the 13th, rational
consultation may prevent a large number of tragedies. And if Brugger,
Dowdy and Graves are correct, superstition may also serve as a lead to in
vestigate more serious neurological problems.
Until the biological origins and results of superstition are pinpointed,
the best advice for Friday the 13th — at least if you're a Finnish woman —
is to stay indoors.
