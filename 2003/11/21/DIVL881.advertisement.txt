Dear University Community:
The "Big Game" is one of the greatest rivalries in college football.
The 106th meeting between Stanford and Cal will provide fierce
competition on the field guided by sportsmanship with mutual respect
displayed by both teams.
As the head football coaches of these two great institutions it is our
hope that the students, Alumni, fans and boosters can follow the
example set forth by both teams and that they will display a spirited but
friendly environment. Our goal for this year's Big Game is for it to be
well played on the field and an enjoyable experience for fans of both
teams.
Unfortunately, in past years the spirit of the Big Game has been
dampened by the irresponsible behavior of some that resulted in
property damage. We absolutely do not condone such behavior and
encourage fans to work together to squelch any and all actions that
would be considered inappropriate or dangerous.
We ask that you please do not engage in "pranks" or other activities
that may require the attention of police or public safety officials. These
activities may needlessly distract officers and prevent them from
responding to true emergencies.
Let us do our very best to make this year's Big Game a positive
environment for everyone to enjoy!
