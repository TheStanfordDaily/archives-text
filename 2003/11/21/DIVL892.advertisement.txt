OUR RESPONSIBILITY
WE MUST REFRAIN FROM THE TEMPTATION
TO MISDIRECT A SENSE OF OUTRAGE TO A
GROUP OF PEOPLE BASED ON A
STEREOTYPE OR ON THEIR RELIGION OR
ETHNICITY. THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY IS
DIMINISHED BY THIS BEHAVIOUR AND IT IS
SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE."
-President Hennessy's post 9/11 statement
to the Stanford Community
(Stanford Report, September 13, 2001)
Has the Daily lived up to
their responsibility?
With freedom comes great responsibility
