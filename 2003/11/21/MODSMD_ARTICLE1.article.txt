# Get back the Axe, the Axe, the Axe...

Big Game is rarely this big.
For the first time since 1996, both Stanford (4-5, 2-5 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) and California (6-6,4-3) have a chance of playing in a bowl game if they
win Big Game. If Stanford wins, California's season is over. If California
wins, the Cardinal will be assured a second-straight losing season even if it
beats Notre Dame on Nov. 29.
"There is a lot riding on this game for both teams," Bears head coach Jeff
Tedford said. "For us, a winning season and bowl implications. And the Axe
is always there for both teams."
Whether Tedford didn't realize that Stanford still technically has a chance
at a winning season and a bowl game, or whether he intended the comment
as a slight, the Cardinal can agree that the Axe is a strong motivator.
For Stanford's junior safety O.J. Atogwe, the worst memory from last
year's season isn't the 2-9 overall record, the five-game losing streak or the
blown leads against Oregon State and UCLA.
"We lost the Axe last year, and that's the biggest memory I have," Atog

we said, referring to Stanford's 30-7 defeat at Berkeley. "Our goal is to go out
there and get that Axe back."
The two teams' momentum coming into this weekend's game is strik
ingly different.
The Cardinal got bullied 43-3 at Oregon State last weekend in a game
that brought an emphatic end to Stanford's two-game winning streak and
conjured unwelcome memories of last season. The Beavers chewed up 663
yards in total offense, eclipsing their previous season high of 562 against
Boise State.
Meanwhile, California beat Washington last weekend by an even more
lopsided margin, winning 54-7 and setting an all-time school record with 729
total yards.
For different reasons, both Stanford and California are trying not to focus
on last week's games.
"The mindset of our players has been the next game — the last one
doesn't matter," Teevens said. "It's pretty much the same week after week.
Whether it's good or bad, you put that one behind you, take lessons and focus
on your next opponent."
Atogwe agreed that the players don't intend to let the loss affect their

attitude.
"We took it down as information," he said. "That wasn't the team we
know we are."
Tedford predicted that his players would be equally unfazed by the suc
cess they had last week.
"They know what is at stake — the winning season, the Axe, a berth to a
bowl game," he said. "We need to keep everything in perspective and prac
tice and prepare to our fullest capability."
The Bears bring a powerful rushing offense that piled up 381 yards last
weekend without injured star running back Adimchinobe Echemandu, who
is expected to play against Stanford.
California has also demonstrated efficiency in its passing game. Starting
quarterback Aaron Rodgers has thrown 15 touchdowns and only four inter
ceptions this season, and wide receiver Geoff McArthur has broken the
school record for single-season receiving yards with 1,259.
Teevens said he was impressed by California's offense against Washington.
"They were just so explosive," he said. "Rodgers really had a great grasp

of the offense. He adlibs and adjusts, and
if you put pressure on him he will step to
the side and throw. He's not afraid to run
the football."
"Their ground game is very potent,"
he added. "You need to play great de
fense against them."
The Bears' defense lacks experi
ence, with just two starters returning
from the unit that shut down the Cardi
nal offense last year. While the team

has put together some strong defensive
performances this year, it has yet to
win a game when it scores fewer than
31 points.
That may suggest that Stanford
would have the advantage in a low-scor
ing affair, or it might be considered a
testament to California's offensive pro
duction, since the Bears have scored
fewer than 31 points just three times this
season.
Teevens didn't speculate how the
game would play out, except to hint
that fans could expect to see some raz
zle-dazzle.
"I'm sure on both sides you'll see some
things that you haven't seen before," he

said. "The players and coaches enjoy it,
and the fans love it."
For the Cardinal, the offensive line
will need to protect the quarterback,
whether it is senior starter Chris Lewis
or freshman backup Trent Edwards,
and open holes for runners the way it
did against Arizona State two weeks
ago.
"The offensive line has developed,"
Teevens said. "There are four or five
players on the offensive line that have
played a lot this year that have never
taken a snap of college football heading
into the season. Their play has helped
our receivers get down the field a little
bit more and our passing game has

opened up as a result."
Prior to last year's win by California,
the Axe had belonged to Stanford for
seven consecutive years. The Cardinal
leads the all-time series between the two
teams 64-40-11.
In this year's game, California is fa
vored to win by more than a touchdown,
but Atogwe said Stanford is not intimi
dated.
"We're really excited," Atogwe said.
"Big Game is a season in itself. Every
thing that has happened before doesn't
matter."
The 106th Big Game is set to kickoff at
12:30 p.m. on Saturday and will be tele
vised on ABC in the Bay Area.
