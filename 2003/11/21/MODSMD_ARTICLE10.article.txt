## Students gear up for Game 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From train whistles to funeral march
es to TV appearances, student groups on
campus have been gearing up for the ex
citement of Big Game weekend and the
culmination of the athletic rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC-Berkeley.
The Stanford Band's antics in the age
old rivalry between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley have not gone unnoticed by
sports fans outside of the two schools.
Fox Network's "Best Damn Sports Show
Period," hosted by comedian Tom
Arnold, included Big Game history cov
erage in this week's episodes about Bay
Area sports.
Last night, Fox aired a segment on the
history of the Axe. Tonight at 10 p.m., the
network will air a humorous re-enact
ment of the famous band collision of
1982, later known as "The Play," during
which a last-ditch effort by UC-Berkeley
to win the game caused a football player
to run over members of the Stanford
Band.
"The Cal-Stanford game is being fea
tured because of its long-standing tradi
tion as a great Bay Area Sports rivalry,"
said Jay Dela Cruz, a spokesperson for
Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc. "Many of
our viewers follow college sports and will
have an interest in the 2003 Big Game."
Dela Cruz said The Band is being one
of the highlights within the Stanford / Cal
rivalry, contrasting the "always-enter
taining Stanford Band" with the "more
traditional Cal Marching Band."
"The Stanford Band is a unique entity
appropriately known for its witty half
time shows and offbeat attire," he said.
"The entertaining nature of the Stanford
Band encapsulates the spirit and intense
rivalry of Big Game."
The Band has a packed schedule this
week with rallies around campus, such as
the "Bearial March" that occurred on
Monday. Ominous-looking Band mem
