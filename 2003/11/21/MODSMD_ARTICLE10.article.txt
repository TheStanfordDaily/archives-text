## Students gear up for Game 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From train whistles to funeral march
es to TV appearances, student groups on
campus have been gearing up for the ex
citement of Big Game weekend and the
culmination of the athletic rivalry be
tween Stanford and UC-Berkeley.
The Stanford Band's antics in the age
old rivalry between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley have not gone unnoticed by
sports fans outside of the two schools.
Fox Network's "Best Damn Sports Show
Period," hosted by comedian Tom
Arnold, included Big Game history cov
erage in this week's episodes about Bay
Area sports.
Last night, Fox aired a segment on the
history of the Axe. Tonight at 10 p.m., the
network will air a humorous re-enact
ment of the famous band collision of
1982, later known as "The Play," during
which a last-ditch effort by UC-Berkeley
to win the game caused a football player
to run over members of the Stanford
Band.
"The Cal-Stanford game is being fea
tured because of its long-standing tradi
tion as a great Bay Area Sports rivalry,"
said Jay Dela Cruz, a spokesperson for
Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc. "Many of
our viewers follow college sports and will
have an interest in the 2003 Big Game."
Dela Cruz said The Band is being one
of the highlights within the Stanford / Cal
rivalry, contrasting the "always-enter
taining Stanford Band" with the "more
traditional Cal Marching Band."
"The Stanford Band is a unique entity
appropriately known for its witty half
time shows and offbeat attire," he said.
"The entertaining nature of the Stanford
Band encapsulates the spirit and intense
rivalry of Big Game."
The Band has a packed schedule this
week with rallies around campus, such as
the "Bearial March" that occurred on
Monday. Ominous-looking Band mem

time to the rhythmic tapping of
drumsticks.
With all the hype surrounding the
events leading up to Saturday's Big
Game, many students are becoming
caught up in the enthusiasm for the
weekend.
Freshman Band member David
Koslow expressed his anticipation of
the game this Saturday.
"I think it's going to be a great
show," he said. "It's going to be awe
someness."
Meanwhile, the Axe Committee
has a simple goal: "I want the Axe
back," said senior Dave Daly, chair
man of the Axe Committee.
To kick off the week's events

leading up to Saturday's 106th Big
Game, the Axe Committee started
the annual train whistle countdown
at 2 a.m. on Tuesday night, 106 hours
before the game.
Even with the late-night start,
Committee members remained un
daunted in their responsibility to up
hold the tradition of announcing the
passing of each hour before the
meeting of the two rivals on the foot
ball field.
"We sound the train whistle
every hour on the hour until Big
Game," Daly said. "We're out here
24 hours a day."
Joining them in White Plaza's
Birdcage throughout the week were
head football coach Buddy Teevens
and University President John Hen
nessy, who dropped by to participate
in the ceremonious sounding of the
whistle.

In addition to continuing the fa
miliar traditions of past years, the
Axe Committee is busy organizing
what they hope will be the tri
umphant return of a lesser-known
ritual.
"This year, we're bringing back a
Stanford tradition of Red Hot Prof,"
Daly said. "It's 25 cents to nominate
a professor, a penny to vote for and a
dime to vote against. The polls will
close at noon on Friday, and the win
ner will lead the Axe yell at the game
on Saturday."
The Axe Committee's week-long
events included the Big Game Bon
fire last night, which contained a re
counting of the history of the Axe,
sports highlights, and appearances
from the football team and the
Band.
The Big Game Gaieties produc
tion, put on by Stanford's Ram's

Head Theatrical Society, also de
buted this week. On Wednesday,
students involved in Gaieties said
that the first performance of "G3:
Rise of the Weenies" went off with
out a hitch.
"I was very proud of it," said se
nior Alexis Boozer, director of Gai
eties. "It was better than I could have
imagined. And with the incorpora
tion of the Band at the end, I think
it's a good energy-builder for [Big
Game]."
Senior Lindsey Wittenberg, stage
manager of Gaieties, agreed.
"The audience seemed to love it,"
she said. "They even had a standing
[ovation] at one point. I think that
Wednesday is when people really
start to realize that it's the week be
fore Big Game, and I think Gaieties
really helps to make that realiza
tion."

have an interest in the 2003 Big Game."
Dela Cruz said The Band is being one
of the highlights within the Stanford / Cal
rivalry, contrasting the "always-enter
taining Stanford Band" with the "more
traditional Cal Marching Band."
"The Stanford Band is a unique entity
appropriately known for its witty half
time shows and offbeat attire," he said.
"The entertaining nature of the Stanford
Band encapsulates the spirit and intense
rivalry of Big Game."
The Band has a packed schedule this
week with rallies around campus, such as

The Axe Committee creates a mighty blaze at its annual Big Game Bonfire. Members
prepared the fire while maintaining their whistle-blowing vigil around the clock.
time to the rhythmic tapping of
drumsticks.
With all the hype surrounding the
events leading up to Saturday's Big
Game, many students are becoming
caught up in the enthusiasm for the
weekend.
Freshman Band member David
Koslow expressed his anticipation of
the game this Saturday.
"I think it's going to be a great
show," he said. "It's going to be awe
someness."
Meanwhile, the Axe Committee
has a simple goal: "I want the Axe
back," said senior Dave Daly, chair
man of the Axe Committee.
To kick off the week's events

leading up to Saturday's 106th Big
Game, the Axe Committee started
the annual train whistle countdown
at 2 a.m. on Tuesday night, 106 hours
before the game.
Even with the late-night start,
Committee members remained un
daunted in their responsibility to up
hold the tradition of announcing the
passing of each hour before the
meeting of the two rivals on the foot
ball field.
"We sound the train whistle
every hour on the hour until Big
Game," Daly said. "We're out here
24 hours a day."
Joining them in White Plaza's
Birdcage throughout the week were
head football coach Buddy Teevens
and University President John Hen
nessy, who dropped by to participate
in the ceremonious sounding of the
whistle.

In addition to continuing the fa
miliar traditions of past years, the
Axe Committee is busy organizing
what they hope will be the tri
umphant return of a lesser-known
ritual.
"This year, we're bringing back a
Stanford tradition of Red Hot Prof,"
Daly said. "It's 25 cents to nominate
a professor, a penny to vote for and a
dime to vote against. The polls will
close at noon on Friday, and the win
ner will lead the Axe yell at the game
on Saturday."
The Axe Committee's week-long
events included the Big Game Bon
fire last night, which contained a re
counting of the history of the Axe,
sports highlights, and appearances
from the football team and the
Band.
The Big Game Gaieties produc
tion, put on by Stanford's Ram's

Head Theatrical Society, also de
buted this week. On Wednesday,
students involved in Gaieties said
that the first performance of "G3:
Rise of the Weenies" went off with
out a hitch.
"I was very proud of it," said se
nior Alexis Boozer, director of Gai
eties. "It was better than I could have
imagined. And with the incorpora
tion of the Band at the end, I think
it's a good energy-builder for [Big
Game]."
Senior Lindsey Wittenberg, stage
manager of Gaieties, agreed.
"The audience seemed to love it,"
she said. "They even had a standing
[ovation] at one point. I think that
Wednesday is when people really
start to realize that it's the week be
fore Big Game, and I think Gaieties
really helps to make that realiza
tion."
