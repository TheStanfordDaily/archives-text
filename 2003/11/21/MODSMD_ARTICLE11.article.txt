# Band claims Tree costume was stolen
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Band's Tree costume was stolen
yesterday at around 3:30 p.m. while the Band was
performing in a rally with the UC-Berkeley band at
Pier 39 in San Francisco, according to members of
the Stanford Band.
The Tree is the Band's mascot, and if the cos
tume is not found by tomorrow, the Band will need
to use an old Tree costume for Saturday's game
against Berkeley.
The costume was left on the Band's bus while
members were eating nearby. The bus was locked,
but members think that the bus driver may have
unlocked the storage bin where the costume was
being stored.
Although Band members said they had no clear
leads, they are looking at the UC-Berkeley Rally
Committee, Cal's version of the Axe Committee, as
a possible suspect.
"While I was dancing, the Rally Comm mem
bers were pulling off my leaves," said junior William
Rothacker, the current Tree. "I got the leaves back,
but this shows malice on their part."
The Band director contacted the Rally Commit
tee, Berkeley administrators and the Cal Band and
issued an ultimatum, stating that if Stanford does
not have the Tree back by noon today, the Band will
file a police report.
The Band's first guess as to the culprit of the theft
was the Cal Band, as they were also at the San Fran
cisco rally.
But "I would never have thought that the Cal
band could do this," Rothacker said. "They are our
friends and we never perceived them as a threat."
Jim Bosch, student director of the Cal Band, said
he did not know who might have taken the Tree cos
tume.
"We definitely did not take it," said Bosch, who
also added, "I hope whoever did it will give it back
so there's not a huge fuss."
Typically, guards flank the Tree to ensure his
safety, but due to amicable relations with the UC-
Berkeley Band, such measures were not taken.
Even if the Band is able to retrieve the Tree cos
tume before the Big Game, it will not be used in the
Game, as it has already been tainted by Cal, accord

ing to a Band representative. Instead, Trees from
past years will be getting together tonight at the
Band Shak after the Gaieties rally to make a new
Tree. If the Tree is retrieved before the Game, it will
be crucified during the Game and will "die a fiery
death," according to Rothacker.
The last time the Tree was stolen was 1998. The
perpetrators called themselves the "Phoenix Five."
Threats of legal action against the thieves were
made and the tree was eventually returned. The
Band made another costume and destroyed the old
one in a wood-chipper at Big Game.
Rothacker made the following statement: "To
whomever stole the costume, you are mistaken to
think that this act of stupidity would do anything but
incite more Stanford spirit."
He added, "Right now, I just feel sorry for you
guys... more than ever before."
