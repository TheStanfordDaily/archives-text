# Big Game sales down as students face higher prices
## 
### KATHERINE WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Big Game ticket sales are down in compari
son to sales at the last home Big Game, due to
a drop in ticket purchases by students and
alumni, according to Bob Carruesco, director
of marketing of Stanford Athletics.
Final results remain indeterminable until
the day of the event, Carruesco said, but re
ports indicate total season ticket sales are down
by approximately a 1,000 in comparison to two
years ago.
"Right now, we're at around 2,000 students
attending Big Game this weekend, but there's
such a rush by students to come on at the last
minute that it's still too early to tell," he said.
One reason for the drop in sale could be the
ticket price, which has nearly doubled this year.
In past years, season passes cost just $35. Now,
Stanford students must buy a $62 season ticket
or pay $52 for a single ticket in order to attend
Big Game. The season ticket at UC-Berkeley
costs $66.
The season ticket, called the "All Axe-ess
Pass," allows admittance to all 2003-2004 Stan
ford sporting events, with the exception of
men's basketball games.
Many Stanford students have expressed
complaints in regards to this new policy. With

out the All Axe-ess Pass, students are also not
guaranteed a seat in the student section at Big
Game, although the ticket office is unsure as to
how strictly this rule will be enforced the day of
the event.
"The price is too steep," said senior Johnny
Chen. "I'll probably just watch it on TV." This
is Chen's last Big Game as a Stanford under
graduate, but he says he doesn't care enough to
spend $50. "Plus, I never thought of Berkeley
as a worthy adversary."
Sophomore Jenny Maehara also said ticket
prices are the reason she will not be present on
Big Game day this year. Maehara said although
she's not an avid participant in the sports scene
at Stanford, she would have attended Big
Game if the ticket price had been lower.
"Would I rather go on my dorm winter trip
for $50 or spend $52 for Big Game? Three days
of fun for ski trip versus four hours of fun for
Big Game: The choice for me was easy."
Carruesco said he understands students'
concerns but defended the concept of the All
Axe-ess Pass.
"I agree that's high for a student, but we
came up with the All Axe-ess Pass in order to
try to increase attendance for the other sports,
such as women's basketball and women's vol
leyball. The key is not to generate revenue
from the student body," Carruesco said. "It's to

get student participation."
He argued that the decline is not due to sea
son ticket prices, but to the past performance of
the football team.
"We've come off a losing season. The sea
son ticket buyers on the fringe will come and go
based on the success of the team," he said.
Carruesco foresees a crowd of about 70,000
people on Big Game day. In the past, the stadi
um usually has not reach its capacity of 80,000
on the University's biggest football event of the
year.
"The stadium hasn't been filled since the
100th Big Game celebration in 1997," Car
ruesco said.
Last year, when the season ticket price was
lower, Maehara was one of the students who
purchased one.
"I went because I was a frosh and because
it's the thing to do at Stanford."
Carruesco said he has been receiving nu
merous complaints from students and that
these grievances are not being ignored.
"From the feedback we've gotten this week,
the ticket plan is not working, and we need to
go back and re-evaluate the situation," he said.
"My intention is to sit down with some student
representation and develop a plan that seems
feasible for everyone. There's nothing we can
do about it at this point."
