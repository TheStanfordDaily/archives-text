# Study spells trouble for fish
## 
### ZACH DEMBO 
The nation's fisheries are in trouble, ac
cording to a recent report released by the
Stanford Fisheries Policy Project, a joint ini
tiative between Stanford Law School and
Hopkins Marine Station. Citing problems in
the Regional Fisheries Management Coun
cils, which manages fisheries, the report pre
dicts that the councils will not likely solve the
overfishing problems that affect more than
one third of the nation's fisheries. In order to
combat these problems, the SFPP calls for
widespread changes in the way fisheries are
managed.
The nation's fisheries are under the con
trol of eight regional councils, which de
cides the regulations and conservation
measures necessary for a specified region.
But the report's authors state that this
management is ineffective due to a variety
of institutional flaws, including financial
conflicts of interest.
"It's very unusual to find members of a
regulated industry are writing their own reg
ulations," said Josh Eagle, a Stanford law
lecturer who co-authored the report. "Hav
ing people who have financial interests in
what they're regulating in any other part of
the government would be illegal."

The report presents several changes that
it said are necessary to overcome the crisis
facing American fisheries. The major
change is that a federal agency, the Nation
al Marine Fisheries Service, should deter
mine fishing quotas instead of the regional
councils. The allocation of quotas will be
left to the regional councils. If this change
is implemented, "many of the other prob
lems discussed in this report would either
disappear or become easier to resolve," the
authors say.
According to the report, "broadening the
interests represented on the councils re
mains a crucial and essential reform." Final
ly, it recommends combating the conflicts of
interests, either by preventing those with fi
nancial interests in fishing from sitting on the
council or making them nonvoting members.
Eagle said he believes the report sheds light
on an often neglected part of the environ
ment.
"Problems in oceans and fisheries gener
ally get less attention than other environ
mental problems because they're harder to
see," Eagle said. "The ocean always looks
the same whether there are fish in it or not,
so the average person probably doesn't think
too much about fisheries."
Co-author and Law Prof. Buzz Thomp

son echoed Eagle's comment that fisheries
are not easily recognized as requiring envi
ronmental protection.
"Fisheries are a tremendously important
but hidden resource. To protect them, we
need to increase awareness of the problems
facing the fisheries and how to solve them,"
Thompson said. "The report is representa
tive of a wide variety of important research
taking place at Stanford today on marine is
sues."
Eagle stressed that the report is not plac
ing all of the blame for current problems on
the regional councils.
"While we can't statistically correlate the
poor conditions to council actions, it is pret
ty clear that the councils are not optimal in
stitutions — if conservation is what you are
after," he said. "It is also clear that the coun
cils do not reflect American concepts of
good government."
While Eagle hopes the report will spur
change, he realizes this is dependent on pub
he opinion. "The primary issue is: do people
care about this? Because that's what moti
vates politicians," he said.
The report, released earlier this month, is
entitled "Taking Stock of the Regional Fish
ery Management" and was sponsored by the
Pew Charitable Trusts.
