## Regents meeting ends in unrest, arrests

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES â€” The University
of California Board of Regents meeting was disrupt
ed Wednesday when university police clashed with a
group of students as they moved into the restricted
area of a conference room at the University
of California-Los Angeles.
The students, who had been sitting in the desig
nated public area for most of the meeting, violated
meeting rules by attempting to approach the regents
during a brief lull in the discussion.
"Me and Eric Lopez stood up and asked politely
that the regents address our concerns," said Anica
McKesey, president of the UCLA Undergraduate
Students Association Council.
McKesey said they disrupted the meeting because
they believed the regents had not been receptive to
their ideas.
Minutes earlier, a few of the regents had met with
students and attempted to address their concerns.
Several university police officers stopped the
group of seven to eight students from approaching
and asked them to return to their seats.
"We stood up and formed a line and tried to let the
regents hear our voice JVfike Speltie, one of the ac
tivists who tried to speak with the regents.
When the police began to push the students back,

they joined arms and began chanting, "We just want
to be heard."
Police stood together and formed a skirmish line
to keep students back.
"The officers use their batons as a blocking mech
anism to hold people back," said acting University of
California Police Department Chief Karl Ross,
adding that no arrests were made during the incident.
The confrontation grew heated as the students re
fused to move, and police and students began to push
harder back and forth.
"At first they were all pushing at our shoulders to
contain the crowd," McKesey said.
By this point, roughly a dozen additional students
had joined the initial group.
"An officer grabbed my arm... That is when they
started swinging at us. They struck several students,"
McKesey said.
Police reports differ from McKesey's account and
state that students attempted to grab police batons.
"I didn't get any word that batons were swung,"
said Ross. "Jabs were made, but no swings."
Some police received minor scratches and bruises,
Ross said.
During the confrontation, several students cried
out in pain as police tried to move the students from
the restricted area, said Genevieve Espinosa, a
fourth-year political science and Asian-American
studies student.

Espinosa left the incident with scratches on her
upper left arm.
"That's unacceptable," she said.
Police inside the meeting radioed for support, and
about 20 additional officers rushed in to help.
"Students need to understand that the stanchions
(boundary lines) block off areas where they can't go,"
Ross said. "We have a responsibility to protect the re
gents."
The police drove the crowd several feet back from
the restricted area, causing some students to fall.
The situation seemed as though it would escalate
further until two students stood up on chairs and
shouted for attention, reminding everyone it was in
tended to be a peaceful protest.
"I felt it was getting out of hand, so I stood up and
tried to get everyone to calm down," Speltie said.
More police flooded in as the situation diffused.
"I think that the students are reflecting the out
rage at what is going on," said Dolores Huerta, a re
gent and a former labor organizer with the United
Farmworkers of America.
Several regents said they did not feel threatened
by the students.
Regent John Moores said that the students were
not threatening.
Huerta agreed.
"If the police hadn't intervened, what would have
happened? They would have talked to the regents."
