# Literary scholar stops at Cubberly on farewell tour
## 
### SHAHNAWAZ NARABI 
Introduced as one of the most
provocative voices in literary
criticism over the past three
decades, Stanley Fish delivered
his lecture entitled "One More
Time" at Cubberly Auditorium
yesterday. Fish, who is the Dean
of Liberal Arts and Sciences at
the University of Illinois-Chica
go, said his lecture was part of a
farewell tour he plans to give be
fore he retires next year.
Fish, who is widely acknowl
edged as one of the wittiest pre
sent-day literary critics, is also
seen as a controversial figure,
with his published works includ
ing 'There's No Such Thing as
Free Speech, and It's a Good
Thing Too." He spoke at length
about what he sees as false con
cepts in society, which included,
among others, the concept of
free speech.
"Tolerance, mutual respect
and freedom of speech are al
ways bad ideas," he said. "They
are cheerleading, flag waving
and slimy. Censorship and regu
lation comes first, free speech
comes second. Free speech re
quires constraint, which is
thought to be opposite."
Fish claimed that without
censorship, thought provoking
speech would "merely be a pro

duction of noise."
However, when questioned
about tolerance and mutual re
spect and the work of notable
figures in history, such as Gand
hi, Fish defended his position by
claiming that these men used tol
erance and mutual respect with
specific goals in mind. He
claimed that tolerance and mu
tual respect as simply abstract
concepts were not applicable in
today's society.
"Disrespect is a prerequisite
for respect," Fish said.
University President John
Hennessy, who attended the lec
ture, felt that Fish was "enter
taining, interesting and thought
provoking." Hennessy claimed
he was a "fan of the intellectual
debate that Fish generates."
Doctoral Student Anupam
Goyal agreed with Fish's defense
of Mandela and Gandhi using
abstract concepts to accelerate
change, but was unsure of Fish's
dismissal of abstract concepts in
society. "I'll have to think about
it, but I do agree that there are
universal principles that can be
applied by different people in
different times," Goyal said.
Fish said he plans to take a few
weeks off during the holiday sea
son, but said he would continue
his lecture series in January, when
he plans to speak in Florida.
