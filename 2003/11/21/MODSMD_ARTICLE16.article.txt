## Joel Stein bares his inner Sampson 
### JOEL STEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's note: In this vintage column first printed in The Stan
ford Daily in 1992, Joel Stein takes on such timely issues as funky
haired '80s rap groups, the last president of the USSR ana Abbie
Hoffman. Stein, class of'93, is currently a humor columnist for
Time magazine and a commentator on VH1 's "1 Love the '80s."

The first thing Mikhail Gorbachev said to me was, "Joel, I can't
believe you cut your hair." All right, maybe not. But a lot of peo
ple did notice.
I had been "wearing my hair low" — as the hipsters like to say
— since my junior year of high school.
I remember the day I first started growing it out. I stopped
Nick the Barber as he was opening the drawer to take out his
shears — thus gaining several Key seconds to see the cover of the
Playboy he kept hidden there.
I turned to him and quietly pleaded, "Just leave the back." He
understood.
After six months I looked like Achilles or Ulysses or the ef
feminate guy from Color Me Badd. And, several hundred bottles
of conditioner later, I couldn't help but wonder if it all happened
just so I could see an airbrushed photo of the Landers sisters.
My hair became the center or my inner being, the first thing
people noticed when I walked in a room. Small children, think
ing for a brief moment they were Southern police officers, asked
me why I had "girl hair."
Security guards followed me around malls, allowing me to
play the game where I pretend to shove tube socks down my
pants, and instead concentrate really hard on that thing Cather
ine Bach did to her shirts in "The Dukes of Hazzard." They never
said anything.
And everyone thought I smoked pot. I would tell them I
didn't, but they would just go ahead and tell me about their own
sordid experiences anyway.
After a while, I was able to filter all the information I was given
and make up cool stories about the time I was so loaded with
Quaaludes that the cocaine kept recrystalizing while I was trying
to freebase. They usually left me alone after mat.
As a long-haired male, I had joined a culture. We had heroes.
Real, five, guitar heroes. We had a history of discrimination. We
had movies and songs and secret handshakes we gave each other
when we passed on the street.
And the night Steinbrenner made Don Mattingly cut his hair,
we all got together and had a good cry.
But I never owned up to any of those feelings. Whenever any
one asked, I told them I grew my hair out for "aesthetic reasons."
My parents kept asking me why I was doing it. I told them that
God never gave his son any trouble about his hair, and that God
probably was a pretty upstanding guy. My parents told me I was
Jewish. It was one of those moments when I wished I paid atten
tion in Hebrew school and learned Moses' dad's name.
So I had no intention of cutting my hair when I innocently
walked into Hair International at the beginning of the quarter. I
hadn't gotten a haircut since November, and I was starting to see the
world as if I were looking through one of those shoebox dioramas.
And there, unbeknownst to me, waited my Delilah.
She looked harmless enough in the window. Unlike most
hairdressers, her hair was all right.
'Sblood, I was wrong.
Her method was ingenious. She told me that this huge "thin
ning" scissor wasn't actually doing any damage.
Just as I was about to question the logic of her chosen imple
ment of destruction, she did that thing they must teach on the first
day of cosmetology school: She began to distract me.
She started asking about my major and saying that I already
seemed to speak "English" pretty well. And then I looked in
the mirror.
"What's the deal with this wing thing?"
As I reached back to show her what I meant, I found out that
this "wing thing" was all that remained of my four-and-a-half
years of work.
I didn't know what to do. The guy in the mirror wasn't the guy
I had come to know and love. Masturbation would be like cheat
ing on someone. And that sort of appealed to me.
The Abbie-Hoffmanesque image I had worked so long to cul
tivate was gone. Instead, I nad the same hair as Florence Hen
derson in the late Brady days. The same hair as a junior-high
school football player.
And while all these thoughts were running through my head,
I found myself staring at this enormous black-and-white picture
of a happy, short-haired, well-adjusted Asian boy leaning on the
shoulders of a particularly buxom-looking Nordic woman.
I realized my Long-Haired Guy Theory — based on person
al observations and the lives of Ric Ocasek and Eddie Van Halen
— wasn't as scientific as I once thought.
Because after four-and-a-half years of public derision, physi
cal unattractiveness and that dizzy little headache thing you get
when your ponytail is too tight, I still wasn't getting any play.
I looked up at Delilah, swallowed a big wad of phlegm and
said: "Might as well cut it off."
And I didn't care. For years, I figured I would be destroyed if
I ever got my hair cut. That I would not do it for a job, I would not
do it for a raise. I would not do it for grad school, I would not do
it for two women wearing tiger-skin leotards.
But there I was, my head nearly shorn, surrounded by several
managers of the haircutting establishment, trying to convince me.
I didn't care that some part of me had died on the floor of that
room. And it had died in a particularly unattractive pile of hair,
which resembled Cousin Itt more than I would have liked to admit.
So I sat there stoically, watching myself becoming that
"Generic X" who I had always knew I would wind up becoming,
who I had so long sought to avoid.
And, ironically, the short-haired guy I saw in the mirror wasn't
nearly as stable as the person I had once been. He wasn't as in
vulnerable to the changes occurring around him. He also looked
younger and had a noticeably larger head.
And just before I left, that happy, well-adjusted Asian boy
walked in and said he had never got his free haircut in return for
the photo sessions with the Nordic woman. Minutes later he
walked out, bald as a sea-mammal's penis. And although I ad
mired him, in a strange way I was no longer able to relate.
So now I'm the short-haired guy, ana when I go to eat free
food during Rush, saying things nke "he's a really good guy" or
"I think I can add a lot to the house," people take me seriously.
I'm just one dangerous step closer to the Generic X.
Sometimes, when I walk into the dining hall and see a guy
from the back, I get confused and think it's me.
Maybe I don't need my hair anymore. Maybe I've learned to
express myself in other ways. Maybe I've learned to be comfort
able with who I am.
Or maybe I just sold out.
I look back to pictures of myself all the way from freshman
year of high school up until today, and I feel like one of those Jim
Beam ads.
I miss the old me. But, then again, he didn't get laid either.
