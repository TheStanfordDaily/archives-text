## Indian hacker heats up intelligence circuits 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Ankit Fadia has spied on offi
cials of the Chinese government.
He has impersonated interna
tional criminals to lure informa
tion out of their accomplices and
has broken into their e-mail ac
counts to intercept evidence. He
has a budget to bribe informants.
And he gets paid to do all of it.
He's also an 18-year-old fresh
man at the University and a self
professed "ethical hacker."
But that's getting ahead of the
story. To get the full picture, let's
go back six years, to a bright-eyed
preteen in New Delhi, India with
an obsession with computers that
bordered on fanaticism.
After appropriating his sister's
laptop and convincing his father
to purchase a new computer, the
12-year-old added the two ma
chines to his own to create a mini
network.
"I was totally addicted to this
stuff," he said. "I connected to
those three computers and that
was my small network wherein I
experimented. Using the first sys
tem I tried to break into the next
one, and so on."
From such humble beginnings

and haphazard experimenting grew a hacker of enough skill to write three books on
the subject and receive professional job offers at the age of 14.
"The first system that I broke into which was outside my own network was a pop
ular computer magazine in India," Fadia said, describing how he received his first
job offer. "Then I sent an e-mail to the systems administrator there, explaining how
I did it and what is the loophole and how to fix it. A couple days later I got a reply
saying 'Why don't you work for us?' "
When he told them his age "they said, 'Okay, wait for 5 years and then start
working for us.' "
But Fadia had other plans. That year he wrote his first book, "Ethical Hacking."
" 'Ethical Hacking' is actually a very amateur sort of book," he said. "It's not re
ally meant for systems administrators or serious computer experts. It's more for the
beginners or newbies who just want to play tricks on their friends or just understand
the basics of computer security."
Well, if at first you don't succeed at writing the definitive work on hacking, then
try, try again. Fadia has written two more books since then, all published before his
eighteenth birthday.
When asked if he makes good money off his books, he simply replied with a
"yeah" and a knowing chuckle.
But writing alone hasn't been enough to keep Fadia busy. After his first book,
he diversified, doing freelance work testing networks for coiporations and govern
ments and offering advanced seminars on system security.
"I work pretty closely with the Singapore government," he said. "Recently a law
was passed in Singapore based on my recommendation and that allows the Singa
pore police to arrest anyone based on suspicion. If they think that you're planning
to break into a Singapore government server, they can arrest you."

Fadia has also worked with
banks in Singapore, the govern
ments of Malaysia and Oman (the
latter of which he says is quite
"shady") and various corpora
tions.
He has offered more than
100 seminars to government offi
cials and technology heads. He
started a company to help market
his three-day program and current
ly has over a dozen employees.
But perhaps the most inter
esting and bizarre thing about
Ankit Fadia is that he's a spy, a
frontline warrior in the battle to
protect cyberspace.
"I am the Asia technology
head of an international intelli
gence agency whose name I cannot
really reveal," Fadia said. "I handle
all the digital intelligence work."
While other publications
have guessed that Fadia's employer
is the FBI or CIA, he swears it is
neither of these. However, some of
his work is suspiciously beneficial
to the United States.
"I work on the China-U.S.
cyber war wherein I have to
break in to the Chinese crackers
— their e-mail addresses or sys
tems — and get information
about them," he said. "I need to
identify who they are and what

their motive is and whether the Chinese government is actually funding them
or not."
While things have simmered down now, the war was quite "hot" in the months
following the emergency landing of a U.S. spy plane on Chinese soil in 2001.
Through his digital intelligence work, Fadia discovered links between the Chinese
government and the China Eagle Union Hacker Group, an organization responsi
ble for defacing thousands of U.S. Web sites over a period of four months that year.
"The long-term goal of the Chinese government is actually to take over the in
ternet and control all parts of the internet," he claimed.
And, funnily enough, the spooks he works for are sympathetic to the vagaries of
student life.
"They're really understanding in the sense that if I've got some exams or a test
coming up, it's fine if I don't work," he said.
With finals swiftly approaching and a seminar at Google to prepare for, that un
named international intelligence agency will have to be fairly understanding for a
little while, even though Fadia isn't quite challenged by his classes this quarter,
which include Computer Science 106X, an introductory class.
"It is easy, but I enjoy the classes," he said of 106X. "I love the professor. He's
amazing."
He'll be teaching his own student-initiated course on computer security next
quarter, where 20 students will be able "to learn how to break into ATM machines
and vending machines."
The class will have no prerequisites.
"If you can send an e-mail you are qualified enough to understand the course.
And you get a free book."
The catch? He wrote the book.

Freshman Ankit Fadia takes a break from sleuthing for cyber criminals to pose for a picture. The
18-year-old is the author of three books on hacking and owns his own company.
