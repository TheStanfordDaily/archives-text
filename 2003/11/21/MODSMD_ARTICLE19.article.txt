# THE 						STANFORD DAILY Editorials
## Res Ed needs to go to its room 
### 
It is a sad day when Stanford traditions
fall victim to convenience; when the del
icate sentiments of a few overrule the
wishes of the majority; when the voice of
the free press is censored on campus. The re
cent decision from Residential Education to
ban Secret Snowflake — a beloved campus
tradition — from dining halls is just the latest
in a string of moves taken by the office to con
trol various aspects of student life. We are op
posed to Residential Education's efforts to
place extensive restrictions on Secret
Snowflake, and we are shocked by the lack of
accountability for the decision within the or
ganization. In short, Residential Education
has a lot of explaining to do.

The reason for curtail
ing Secret Snowflake —
which remains unclear
without elucidation from
Jane Camarillo, director
of Residential Education
— seems to be bi-partite.
On the one hand, Secret
Snowflake left a mess for
dining hall workers. On
the other hand, the
young children of resi
dent fellows were some
times exposed to things
inappropriate for their
age during the first
weeks of December.

While these are both unfortunate effects of
the tradition, they do not justify virtually elim
inating it.
In recent months, Residential Education
has significantly overstepped its mandate.
Last spring, Camarillo was in the vanguard
of the effort to ban alcohol in freshman
dorms. In October, the resident fellow in
Toyon Hall made a unilateral decision to ban
alcohol at public events in the dorm. The
central bureaucracy of Residential Educa
tion then reaffirmed a policy that bans the
door-to-door distribution of publications in
dorms — a policy we believe violates the
spirit, if not the letter, of the First Amend
ment. And now, Secret Snowflake has hit the

chopping block.
ITie mission of Residential Education, as
outlined by its Web site, is to provide intellec
tual stimulation, to promote academic
progress and success, to foster a pluralistic
community and to offer leadership opportu
nities to students. Much of what Residential
Education has been doing in the past six
months seems to run counter to these objec
tives. While no one is against promoting safe
ty on campus, Residential Education should
not act as a policeman, monitoring the every
move of the students under its jurisdiction.
Perhaps even more distressing are the au
tonomy of Residential Education and the
seemingly unilateral nature of most of the de-

cisions made by the cen
tral bureaucracy. Gene
Awakuni, vice provost
for student affairs,
should be regularly con
sulted about the deci
sions made in Residen
tial Education. Unfortu
nately, this seems not to
be the case. Further, in
almost every area of
University governance,
students have a power
ful voice at the decision
making table. Not so in
Camarillo world. Deci
sions are churned out

just in time for students to get mad about
them — but unfortunately, too late to do any
thing about changing them. This office needs
to take a look at its organization and time
management skills. No decision at all is some
times better than a rushed decision, and re
cent policy out of Residential Education does
not have the trappings of careful, long-term
consideration.
Just because students happen to live in
houses administered by Residential Educa
tion doesn't mean that the office can — or
should — control their lives. It is time for Ca
marillo to sit down with her staff and serious
ly reconsider Residential Education's deci
sion-making process.

"In almost every area of
