# Card seeks own reason to celebrate
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team just found
extra motivation for the 106th Big Game. It
needs to win its remaining two games to be
come bowl eligible and needs to rebound
from last week's embarrassing loss at Oregon
State.
But, for some Cardinal players, all they
need to do is close their eyes and recall the
post-game ruckus on the field of Memorial
Stadium after Stanford's 30-7 loss to Cal.
When the Cardinal fumbled the ball with
11 seconds remaining, the game's fate was
sealed for all intents and purposes.
But that was when the drama really began.
The officials waved off the last ticks of
the clock and the students rushed the field,
immediately lifting ex-Bears quarterback
Kyle Boiler onto their hands for some
crowd-surfing.
Cal's Axe Committee brought the Axe to
the 50-yard line, and the players carried the
trophy across the field, allowing thousands of
Berkeley students to touch the Axe.
Then things got really ugly.
Some seemingly inebriated Cal fans tried
to rush the goal posts on the south end of the
stadium but were repelled by security guards.
Meanwhile, hundreds of students over
whelmed the north-end guards, tore down the
north goal posts and began parading them
through the stadium as several students reck
lessly jumped onto and narrowly hung off of
the posts.
The students on the north side then at
tempted to use the goal post as a wedge to go
after the south posts and eventually overpow
ered the guards once again.
They tore down the second set of posts as
several fans were pulled to the ground, hand
cuffed and arrested.
Eventually, the swarming crowd marched
through the streets of Berkeley, posts
in hand, celebrating Cal's 30-7 victory
over the Cardinal.
"It hurt to see that," senior Kirk
Chambers said.
Whether the Stanford players have
readily admitted it this week or not,
last year's game was an indelible mark
in their collective memories. The loss
culminated a disappointing 2-9 first
year season under coach Buddy
Teevens that arguably turned from
dismal to bitter with Stanford's first
loss to its arch-rival in seven years.
It was the first time any of the play
ers recruited by ex-coach Tyrone Wiil
ingham, including Chambers, had ex
perienced a Big Game loss.
"It means a lot more to me now
that we've let one slip away," Cham
bers said.
But the 2003 installment of Stan
ford-Cal probably means even more
since Stanford's football team and
fans were shown up by a bunch of ex
cited Cal students.
Last year's game surely generated
a lot more hype in Berkeley than it had
recently. Memorial Stadium sold out
for the first time since the 1994 Big
Game because Cal coach Jeff Tedford
had turned around the Bears football
program and transformed Boiler from
bust to bloomer.
The victory over the Cardinal
sealed the turnaround for a Bears pro

gram that under ex-coach Tom Hol
moe had been the butt of far too many
jokes.
"You have to understand the con
text," Chambers said. "They hadn't
won [a Big Game] in so many years
and they land of expected [to win] be
cause they were having a good year
and we were having a terrible year.
"The situation was kind of set up
for that."
It's one thing to be excited —
and it's something else to get out
of control.
"I've never seen the fans like that,"
Cal cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha
said after the game. "I don't think
we've ever had that at home."
Caught up in the post-game emo
tion, Boiler had no objections to the
way his fans conducted themselves.
"It was great to see the goalposts go
down," he said at the time. "I can (fie
peacefully now."
Chambers, for one, didn't ex
actly feel safe in the out-of-control
environment.
"They didn't keep people off the
field until all of our players got off," he
said. "I had Cal fans up in my face
yelling — bad things are going to hap
pen in that situation.
"I was disappointed in how Cal
handled the event."
The best revenge for Stanford fans,
though, is not to tear down the goal
posts at Stanford Stadium tomorrow.
No, the real revenge would only
come with a Big Game win that would
keep Cal out of a bowl game and keep
Stanford's bowl hopes alive.
