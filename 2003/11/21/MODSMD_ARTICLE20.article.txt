# Rivals should respect each other

Tomorrow, Stanford and UC-Berkeley
will face off in the 106th Annual Big
Game. As an event with such a storied
history, the Big Game is always certain
to inspire a strong sense of school spirit on both
sides of the Bay. Unfortunately, this day can
also lead to unfortunate incidents of destruc
tion. Cardinal and Bears fans alike need to be
sure to act responsibly this year so that they do
not bring harm upon themselves or others.
Concern stems from disorderly conduct at
past Big Games. In 1999, for example, when
Stanford was hosting the event, angry Berke
ley fans stormed the football field after the
Cardinal won and tore down goal posts. This
was repeated last year at Berkeley, when Cal
students — after their first Big Game win in
eight years — rushed the field and tore down
their own goal posts.
This and other types of destructive acts are

inexcusable. The Game, by all means, should be
fun and competitive. School rivalries should be
running high. But there is no need to destroy
private property to have a good time. Our stu
dent bodies are both composed of intelligent
and creative individuals. Game watchers
should think of better ways to amuse them
selves than by committing harmful pranks.
Tomorrow is an opportunity for Stanford
and Cal students to demonstrate to both them
selves and outside observers that they can act
responsibly. Big Game goers should certainly
enjoy themselves, but not to the extreme that it
hinders the ability of other attendees to enjoy
the event as well. Property destruction and
other harmful acts are embarrassing to Stan
ford, embarrassing to UC-Berkeley and em
barrassing to college sports. We must prove to
everyone that we're better than that.
And yes, we must also be sure to beat Cal.
