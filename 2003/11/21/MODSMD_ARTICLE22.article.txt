## DEATH AND DESTRUCTION The 						Weenies are upon us, again 
### 
I must be a skeptic. My discoveries
of the intricacies of the world
have come by experience, and ex
perience alone. While most of
you people incarcerate yourselves with
self-imposed boundaries — bound
aries dictated by such fallacious consid
erations as "logic" or "reason" or
"what the mysterious old janitor tells
you after the halls clear out" — I'm
running freely, taking it all in: the
sights, the sounds, the smells.
You are all minnows in a puddle of
elk urine while I, an eagle, am unlimit
ed in flight with only my perception of
cause and effect as my educator. I don't
bother myself with your myths, your
sophistry and your superstitions. I
don't concern myself with your recom
mendations, your fabrications and
your hesitations. It's my life, and the
way I see it, it is now or never. Folks, I
ain't gonna live forever. I just want to
live while I'm alive.
This might explain the scars,
bumps and bruises. The detentions,
the suspensions, the citations, viola
tions and devastations. I learn lessons
the hard way, and that's good for me
because it truly solidifies my under
standing of the world.
For example, when I first arrived
at Stanford and heard all the gab
bledy-gook about "those Weenies at
Cal," I didn't buy it. There were Stan
ford students and a cappella groups
alike running their mouths about a
group of people that as far as I could
see only had one thing in common:
they went to the same school. "Who
cares?" I thought. "Can they really be
all that bad?"
I mean, the only similarity I share
with all Stanford students is my admis
sion to Stanford. We all just happen to
be in the same place. We didn't even
come here for the same reasons. Some
are here for academics, some athletics,
some the prestige. Myself? I came here
because Stanford is the best university
that's within 50 miles of an In-N-Out
establishment.
Can't UC-Berkeley be the same: a
heterogeneous pool of unique individ
uals? Well, I did a little investigation on
my own and found, to my surprise, that
this is not actually the case. Cal stu
dents don't just "happen" to be in the
same place.
The binding characteristics of Cal
students similarly regard admission to
a specific university... and that Uni
versity happens to be Stanford. (Warn
ing: completely fabricated bulleted list

approaching.)
1) They all wanted it, they none
gotted it.
2) They were all forced to read a re
jection message that goes something

like: "Sorry, boys
and girls. No dice.
Maybe if you're
good in this fife,
you'll be reincar
nated into some
one worthy of a
Stanford diploma
next time around."
3) They all
packed their bags
and headed out —
not to the promised

land, but a bit farther north to the place
that doubles as Stanford in movies.
Thus, UC-Berkeley is a breeding
ground for resentment; a monster
sized support group for those wretched
souls comprising the "other 80 per
cent" — the "almost, but not quite."
We critique their etiquette, harp on
their insecurities — but how much can
we expect of them? How they must
feel having been flushed down the ap
plicant pool to that grime-ridden toilet
which is UC-Berkeley.
At Big Game last year, I could not
help but pity them. I was so close to
those Cal fans. The despair in their
eyes haunted me for minutes. The
"Fuk Stanfurd" signs were such pa
thetic attempts to universalize the
agony: Like an angry raccoon who
charges front bumpers in oncoming
traffic, like disgruntled hobos invad
ing Texas with NERF as their sole
weapons supplier. Why omit the "c?"
Why change the "o" to a "u?" Sadly,
it was the best that they could come
up. And I cannot bear it.
What a stark contrast between the
bands of each school. If our band is
James Dean, then their band is Jimmy
Dean (the pork sausage). If our band is
Slim Shady, then their band is Slim Jim
(the beef stick). If their band is a 6.5-
liter, off-road Hummer, then ours is a
6.5-liter, off-road Fellatio. When our
band plays, you say, "Haha, that's
funny." When their band plays, you
say, "I'm gonna go get some peanuts
and beer."
Furthermore, what could be more
horrifying than how grotesquely they
savored last year's victory? Like
starved beasts, they gorged themselves
and relished in that triumph as if it was
their last. But it may well have been, for
it is well understood that our losses, the

few and the far between, are no more
than deliberate efforts to maintain the
spirit of Big Game, to fend off the
Angel of Darkness from at last casting
his shadow over the morale of Cal. For
humanity's sake, we loosen our grips
when Weenie livelihood goes limp.
However, I fear that our well of
compassion may be running dry.
I look around me and I'm ashamed.
How relentlessly we lampoon those
sorry creatures.
Must we exert so much emphasis on
celebrating the inferiorities of another
breed of man? Gaieties: What purpose
does it serve but to spread contempt
for a lower grade of being? What does
this say about us as people?
Ah but you say, it's all for "enter
tainment," it showcases our "school
spirit," it's rich in "tradition." You
argue that those Cal students are
"Weenies" of their own accord, that
they "choose" their plight. Some of
you point to the transfer system that al
lows a few of them to become upstand
ing Stanford students.
I say "phewy!"
The transfer system is flawed. It is
not good enough. Some of you even
have the gall to argue that the Weenies
want to be where they are, that "they
like it there." Frankly, I'm disgusted.
Forgive me for assuming that my
fellow students were enlightened. For
give me for endowing thee with more
credit than thou deserves. I am not too
dimwitted to realize that the Weenies
are a lower species of primate, but it
never even occurred to me that the
Stanford student is devoid of even a
minimal capacity for empathy or re
straint. I apologize for my apparently
unreasonable expectations.
Go now. Go ridicule the "Wee
nies." Go pulverize them like we've
done for so many years. Take back the
Axe, that solitary morsel of dignity,
that last bastion of hope upon which
their self-esteem has subsisted for the
past 12 months. Do what you must to
feel good about yourselves.
Don't mind me. I'll be weeping by
the willows on the lake, tending to my
bleeding heart.

Senior A.J. Magnuson expects you all
to show up at the ASSU Block Party
in White Plaza at 10 p.m. after Big
Game where his band Redline and
Animal Phone Sex Band will be rock
ing the joint. E-mail him at ajmag
nu@stanford.edu and tell him what
you're wearing right now.
