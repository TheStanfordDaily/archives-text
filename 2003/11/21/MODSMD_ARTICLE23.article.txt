# JACK AND JILL, MINUS JACK
## Do I have graduate school regrets? 
### 
As you all may have noticed
from my by-line, I'm a grad
uate student now. With this
title come a number of
stereotypes about what my life must
now be like. From what I gather, many
people believe that we graduate stu
dents have horribly boring social lives,
that we all wear bike helmets and that
try as we might, we may never success
fully leave the University. I have great
love for many a grad student, and I'd
happily dispel such rumors if I could.
But I think I've become unqualified
for such a job. Although I am immea
surably happy to be living again with
some of my best friends from my life as
an undergrad, I have to admit that we
don't stay up until 5 a.m. every morn
ing chatting in a lounge or in our
house's kitchen. We don't eat at Late
Night at 2 a.m. (do they still have Late
Night?) and we seldom go hot-tubbing,
rappel off the construction cranes or do
random "walk-throughs" of dorms to
meet people we've never seen before.
We're less outgoing that we used to be
in certain ways, and we think it really is
important to stay awake during class.
Of course, now that we finance our ed
ucations entirely on our own, the op
portunity cost of missing a class (hun
dreds of dollars) in order to sleep in
sounds likes a pretty shoddy idea.
Secondly, grad students do wear
bike helmets. I thought I wouldn't, but
then I moved off-campus and realized
that cars in the "real world" don't care
if you're a biker and a student. They're
thinking, "I'vd gotta get to work, who

gives a damn about your little class?"
And the norm of helmet wearing is re
ally nice — it proves that as you grow
up, you allow yourself to care more for
your own safety than whether you
look "cool" for your classmates.
Finally, about this "graduation"
thing —it often does feel like we'll
never leave Stanford. For grad stu
dents, this feeling is both internal and

external. Some of
us actually are 30-
years old and no
where near finish
ing our graduate re
search. For grad
students like me,
doing the one-year
co-terminal degree,
the feeling is more
specific. Already at
the beginning of
this year, I was feel-

ing ready to be finished with it. I could
have used at least a few years off from
school before I started this degree.
Alas, I've begun and I'm not sure that
it's wise to stop. But should I really be
borrowing $32,000 in loans to do some
thing I'm not sure I'm enjoying?
This brings me to an important
point, stolen from the advice of several
law school admissions officers in an info
session a few weeks ago. They said
don't apply to law school before you're
sure that you're ready to come and be
fore you know that law is what you
want to study. I say this advice works
for all disciplines. Yeah, you may not
know what you want to do with your

self after graduation, so grad school
looks like a good Way to "defer" life.
But, you know — there's really no
need to pay so much money while
you're "stalling." If you're actually un
convinced that more school is what you
need, Teach for America would be
happy to have you, as would the Peace
Corps, all the Bay Area consulting
companies and your local non-profit
organizations.
I know that you all can think about
your life options on your own. I know
I'm not the only one who has had to
make the decision about grad school.
But I am someone who knows that
you'll get much more out of school if
you're enticed by the subject material
and confident that the classroom is
where you want to be. Being a little
"burnt out" by school may be as disap
pointing as it is common, but that
doesn't mean it's an illegitimate factor
by which to make a decision.
I've got to be honest — grad stu
dent life isn't bad. The work can be re
ally interesting and there are plenty of
parties and pubs for when you're feel
ing energetic. But I'm telling you — it
doesn't cost $32,000 to hang out with
your friends post-graduation. As for
co-terming, it might really pay off to
wait a few years before doing two years
of grad school, instead of unhappily
forcing yourself to do one year before
you're ready.

Alas, I've begun and I'm not sure that
it's wise to stop. But should I really be
borrowing $32,000 in loans to do some
thing I'm not sure I'm enjoying?
This brings me to an important
point, stolen from the advice of several
law school admissions officers in an info
session a few weeks ago. They said
don't apply to law school before you're
sure that you're ready to come and be
fore you know that law is what you
want to study. I say this advice works
for all disciplines. Yeah, you may not
know what you want to do with your

self after graduation, so grad school
looks like a good Way to "defer" life.
But, you know — there's really no
need to pay so much money while
you're "stalling." If you're actually un
convinced that more school is what you
need, Teach for America would be
happy to have you, as would the Peace
Corps, all the Bay Area consulting
companies and your local non-profit
organizations.
I know that you all can think about
your life options on your own. I know
I'm not the only one who has had to
make the decision about grad school.
But I am someone who knows that
you'll get much more out of school if
you're enticed by the subject material
and confident that the classroom is
where you want to be. Being a little
"burnt out" by school may be as disap
pointing as it is common, but that
doesn't mean it's an illegitimate factor
by which to make a decision.
I've got to be honest — grad stu
dent life isn't bad. The work can be re
ally interesting and there are plenty of
parties and pubs for when you're feel
ing energetic. But I'm telling you — it
doesn't cost $32,000 to hang out with
your friends post-graduation. As for
co-terming, it might really pay off to
wait a few years before doing two years
of grad school, instead of unhappily
forcing yourself to do one year before
you're ready.
