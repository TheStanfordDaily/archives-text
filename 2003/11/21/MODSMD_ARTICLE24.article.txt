ResEd needs to take student
opinion into account

I was surprised to read that Res
idential Education is banning Se
cret Snowflake in dining halls this
year ("Secret snowflake snowed out
of dining halls," Nov. 20).
Not because I hadn't expected it
— I remember it being discussed by
administrators last spring — but be
cause despite six months of consid
eration that went into this change,
Residential Education made no ef

fort to get input from students.
Residential Education could
have looked for some way to keep a
popular Stanford tradition alive.
Residential Education could have
talked to students and found some
compromise. Instead, Residential
Education has dropped an absolute
ban on Secret Snowflake in the din
ing halls at close to the last minute.
Most branches of the University
have committees with student
members with which they discuss
major decisions — not only groups
like Dining Services, which works

almost exclusively with students,
but even bodies like the Adminis
trative Panel on Human Subjects in
Non-Medical Research.
So why doesn't Residential Edu
cation, which affects students with
every decision it makes, have some
sort of formalized student input?
Why can Jane Camarillo drop sur
prise decisions like this on the stu
dent body without any input or
warning?
