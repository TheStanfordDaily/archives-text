## The 						problems with college rankings in magazines 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
The college admissions panic is on for U.S.
parents and their high school seniors. The
panic is fueled by the unholy alliance of par
ents and students, colleges and the rankings in
dustry. National magazines have timed their
release of"college ranking issues to coincide
with Americans' paranoia.
Since U.S. News & World Report first
began ranking colleges in the 1980s, other mag
azines and books have followed suit. Time and
Newsweek now rank schools. Publishers pub
lish guidebooks such as the Princeton Review
and Fiske College guides, which purportedly
identify the best colleges.
Universities and colleges have responded.
Schools advertise their rankings on Web sites and
in promotional mailings. Furthermore, colleges
artificially manipulate data in order to achieve
high rankings. For example, all the rankings pur
veyors use college selectivity as a measure of aca
demic excellence — the lower the acceptance
rates at schools, the better the presumed quality
of that school. Hence, many universities encour
age unqualified or borderline students to apply in
order to increase rejection rates.
Another supposed measure of college ex
cellence is "yield," the percentage of students
that are selected to attend the college that ac

tually end up enrolling. The assumption is that
the higher the school's yield, the better the
school. Schools have several ways of manipu
lating their yield rates. First, they can accept a
large number of applicants from certain class
es of students that they feel fairly certain will
attend. Traditionally, one such group has been
legacies — sons and daughters of alumni. A
second way to doctor yield is to offer a binding
early admissions process. Students sign an
agreement in advance stating that if the uni
versity accepts them, they will attend.
Both selectivity and yield are criteria ad
missions directors now consider in making ad
missions decisions that have, to some extent,
been propelled by outside artificial market
forces. Neither criterion can truly determine
anything about the quality of education a stu
dent will receive at the school. Moreover, both
criteria may end up unfairly biasing the admis
sions process for some students and against
others. The issue though, is not only whether
these are truly measures of a school's worth,
but whether school policies should be driven
by magazine rankings.
The magazines, of course, have a benign ex
planation as to why they rank schools: To help
students make one of the most important deci
sions of their lives.
A cynic might suggest a more compelling in

terpretation. The college issues are frequently
the magazines' best-selling issue of the year.
That fact has allowed magazine publishers to
become driving forces in the college admis
sions industry. Although no collusion scandal
has yet arisen in the rankings industry, it is not
hard to imagine the day when a Yale Universi
ty admissions counselor, for example, offers a
college rankings magazine official a bribe to
get a higher ranking than, for example, Stan
ford. The stakes have become too high for col
leges to ignore their rankings and the tempta
tions are too great for data gatherers to accept
the kinds of payoffs typical of many industries.
The power of rankings and their sway on the
public imagination has not been lost on maga
zine editors. Look sometime at the number of
issues devoted annually to highlighting the top
100 businesses or restaurants, for example.
But ultimately, what is the harm to students
and their families? I would suggest the harm
results from something our businesses are very
good at: Creating demand and fueling small
flames into conflagrations. Our emphases on
biggest, best and first are often quantitative
measures rather than qualitative ones. The
marketing of education has made the packag
ing, not the product, better.
Parents and high school students often be
come enamored with the college admissions

search process. They ask the wrong questions.
In fact, they really don't ask questions at all,
because they have already bought the "best"
lists. Students become most concerned about
being picked by colleges, not selecting them.
Top students often go to universities, not be
cause of any match with their talents or inter
ests, but because the school was given the best
rating by a magazine somewhere.
College rankings by magazines are not like
ly to go away. In fact, their prevalence is in
creasing. The Atlantic Monthly just added its
authoritative voice to the field with its first an
nual U.S. college survey edition in November.
Colleges and universities cannot afford to ig
nore the rankings because the surveys have too
strong a foothold in academia.
So the solution is left to the consumer, in this
case, parents and students. Although it would
be impractical to suggest that those groups ig
nore the rankings, it is possible to use the rank
ings as a last resort. That is, parents and stu
dents should do their college research indepen
dently of magazine surveys. Once they are com
fortable with two or three possible choices only
then should they resort to magazines.
