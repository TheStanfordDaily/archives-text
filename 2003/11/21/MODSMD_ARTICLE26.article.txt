## GREAT EXPECTATIONS 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Last year, the No. 20 Stanford men's basketball team (0-0) seemed to
thrive outside the spotlight, almost reveling, at times, in its perpetual role
as the underdog. This season, however, Stanford will no longer surprise
anyone.
The 1-1-3 zone won't be a surprise.
The inspiring and borderline heroic efforts of past, unsung seniors
Justin Davis and Matt Lottich will no longer catch opposing teams off
guard.
And the smooth, quiet, all-around offensive prowess of junior swing
man Josh Childress will no longer go unseen.
Interestingly enough, the hype surrounding Stanford's 2003-04 cam
paign began after the Cardinal was eliminated from the NCAA Tourna
ment last season by a then-fifth-seeded Connecticut team (which is now
ranked No. 1 in the country).
Suddenly, a "scrappy" Stanford squad that lost only one player of any
real significance (Julius Barnes) to graduation seemed to possess an ex
tremely bright future.
Which isn't to say that Stanford doesn't have something to prove this
season. In the next month, the Cardinal will face No. 6 Kansas at the
John Wooden Classic in Anaheim, Calif, on Dec. 6 and No. 16 Gonzaga
in Oakland, Calif, on Dec. 20.
But in order to replicate and, perhaps, build upon the successes of last
season, the youthful exuberance of last year's 24-win team will have to
somehow translate into a polished, consistent and united attack.
While the team acknowledges that the heightened expectations are
there, many are quick to point out that Stanford will still have to come
out to play every game.
"We still have to fight like we did last year," said sophomore point
guard Chris Hernandez who's return to the court is one of the most
highly anticipated stories of the year. "We can't just think because
we're a little older and a little more mature that we're just going to
beat up on everybody. Every game has to be a fight."
In short, Stanford will be expected to play like grown-ups this year.
What does that mean?
No more "childish" losses to unranked teams. And, more important
ly, the effort has to be there day in and day out.
To a certain extent, the Cardinal already has shown signs of matura
tion.
Junior center Rob Little is leaner than ever and should give the Car
dinal a more consistent option in the low post.
Six-foot-10 sophomore forward Matt Haryasz bulked up consider
ably in the off-season and will bring added depth to the frontcourt.
"I think our post position has gotten a lot stronger," Montgomery
said. "You've got to give Rob credit. He works on the things that he
needs to."
In the back court, sophomore point guard Jason Haas looks much

more confident with his shot and with running the team offensively, in
general. Junior utility man Nick Robinson has extended the all-around
nature of his game even further. Robinson might even spend some time
at the point position in the event of injury.
But even with all the substantial individual improvements, already
the season is not without its question marks — the injuries are already
beginning to arise.
The once-again sophomore Hernandez has battled back to overcome
two foot injuries only to find himself plagued with the same back injury
that haunted him throughout his high school career.
And recently, Childress has been slowed by foot pain as well. The ju
nior has been forced to sit out practices because of what Montgomery
calls a "precursor to a stress fracture." Childress will likely wear an or
thodic in his shoe to ease some of the foot pain.
"If we stay healthy we're going to be fine. If we don't, we're not,"
Montgomery said matter of factly.
"The key guy is [Hernandez] because he's got the back and he's
missed [a lot of time]. We're trying to figure out a way to keep him from
aggravating the back in practice[....] I don't know how to best rest him."
"Right now Josh's foot is bothering him," Montgomery added. "He
really can't practice. He's not a 100 percent."
While the injuries to both Hernandez and Childress are Mont
gomery's most immediate concerns at this time, there still remains all
the talk, the hype — the heightened expectations for a team that flour
ished last season without the added pressure of expectancy.
"I think last year's team probably maxed out in terms of number of
wins," Montgomery said. "That's pretty hard to duplicate no matter how
good you are. [But] we're not too worried about what everybody else
thinks."
And to a certain extent, he's right. Right now, the Cardinal has plen
ty to worry about other than outsider perceptions.
Right now, Stanford is faced with an unranked Sacramento State
team that went 12-17 last season and appeared in the Big Sky Tourna
ment for the first time in the programs 12 year Div. 1 history.
The Hornets, which are led by fourth-year head coach Jerome Jenk
ins, finished the exhibition portion of their season 1-1 after dropping a
game to the Olympic Club (which boasts ex-Cardinal standout Kris
Weems) 79-68. Over a week later, Sacramento defeated EA Sports 96-
88.
Needless to say, the Hornets will travel to Maples Pavilion with a
"nothing to lose" attitude.
And based on past performance, the Cardinal might want to ap
proach this season and this game with that same type of mindset.
Because, hey, when you really think about it, 24 wins is a lot to live up
to. And a similar season ain't that bad.
Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. on Saturday and, as always, the game will be
broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.
