# WOMEN EYE A RETURN TO GLORY
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Last year at this time, the No. 6 Stan
ford women's basketball team (0-0)
was floating in a cloud of uncertainty —
its star player, Nicole Powell, was out
with a bulging disc in her back and
there were no seniors to lead the team
in her place.
This year, a healthy Powell, now in
her senior season with the Cardinal,
will lead the team into the regular sea
son.
Powell and the Cardinal have high
expectations resting on their shoulders.
For Powell, this season marks the
final opportunity for the two-time Ail-
American to cement her legacy among
the likes of former Stanford standouts
Jennifer Azzi, Kate Starbird, Sonja
Henning and Val Whiting by leading
the team to a Final Four appearance.
In Powell's tenure at Stanford, the
Cardinal has had limited success in the
NCAA Tournament. While Stanford
made the Elite Eight in 2001-02, it was
bounced in the second round last year
and in 2000-01.
The Cardinal's inability to advance
deep into the tournament has often
been attributed to a weak conference
schedule.
There is no question that things are
different this year and the Cardinal will
face a much tougher Pac-10.
Historically, Stanford has been the
only Pac-10 team to garner a spot in the
AP Poll. Currently, Arizona sits at No.
22 and Oregon, who upset then-No. 10
LSU last week sits at No. 24.
While Pac-10 action doesn't kick off
until late December, Stanford isn't just
going to sit around on its laurels until
then.
The Cardinal's first big test comes
Nov. 30 when No. 10 Georgia travels

to the Farm. The Lady Bulldogs
boast one of the best frontcourts in
the country, featuring the duo of 6-
foot-5 senior forward Christi Thomas
and 6-foot-6 junior forward Kara
Braxton.
Last season, Thomas averaged 16.0
points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per
game. Braxton was no slouch during
her sophomore season, averaging 15.7
points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per
game.
On Dec. 14, the Cardinal will face its
toughest challenge of the season - a
matchup with No. 3 Tennessee.
The Lady Volunteers lack a clear
cut star this season, but with Pat Sum
mitt the winningest head coach in all of
women's basketball, on the bench, the
Vols are always a title contender.
"We're excited to have Tennessee
come to Stanford, and Georgia," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"[The team] wants to play against the
competition. We really feel the sched
ule that we play prepares us for the con
ference."
The Cardinal has one more top-10
opponent on its schedule in No. 7 Texas
Tech.
The Lady Raiders are led by senior
guard Jia Perkins, who averaged 15.9
points per game and was named honor
able mention All-American last sea
son.
As the squad kicks off the regular
season, it has several injuries that will
be difficult to overcome. Forwards
Azella Perryman and T'Nae Thiel, who
both made significant contributions in
2002, are sidelined with respective
ankle and foot problems.
Additionally, freshman forward
Eziamaka Okafor is down with a torn
Achilles tendon and senior guard Katie
Denny is recovering from a sprained
MCL. Okafor may return to action

sometime midseason and Denny is ex
pected back by the fourth or fifth game
of the regular season.
"It's not something I feel that I can
control," VanDerveer said. "Hopefully
we'll get Azella back by the time we
play Boston. We don't have a timetable
for T'Nae's return yet."
However, the absence of post play
ers such as Thiel, Perryman and Okafor
has paved the way for true freshman
Kristen Newlin. In the Cardinal's sec
ond exhibition game, a 92-86 victory
over Everyone's Internet, Newlin
recorded a double-double with 18
points and 11 rebounds.
"We're very excited about Kristen's
level of play," VanDerveer said. "Had
it not been for the injuries, we probably
wouldn't have found out about it until
mid- or late-season."
Stanford faces Pepperdine in Mal
ibu on Friday night in the season open
er for both teams and comes home to
square off against Fordham on Sunday
at 2 p.m.
The Waves lost two key players to
graduation in West Coast Conference
Player of the Year Tamara McDonald
and WCC honorable mention Damaris
Hinojosa.
Pepperdine boasts a strong back
court, led by junior Shanell Law. Law
averaged 11.8 points and 4.4 rebounds
per game and figures to play a more
prominent role in this year's offense.
Fordham returns four of five
starters, but will sorely miss the gradu
ated Mobolaji Akiode, who averaged
16.5 points per game last season.
The Rams are somewhat of a wild
card, unsure of where their offense will
come from, but guard Beth Ann Dick
inson tallied 24 and 20 points in Ford
ham's two preseason games.
Both games can be heard on KZSU,
90.1 FM.

over Everyone's Internet, Newlin
recorded a double-double with 18
points and 11 rebounds.

it not been for the injuries, we probably
wouldn't have found out about it until

Last year at this time, the No. 6 Stan
ford women's basketball team (0-0)
was floating in a cloud of uncertainty —
its star player, Nicole Powell, was out
with a bulging disc in her back and
there were no seniors to lead the team
in her place.
This year, a healthy Powell, now in
her senior season with the Cardinal,
will lead the team into the regular sea
son.
Powell and the Cardinal have high
expectations resting on their shoulders.
For Powell, this season marks the
final opportunity for the two-time Ail-
American to cement her legacy among
the likes of former Stanford standouts
Jennifer Azzi, Kate Starbird, Sonja
Henning and Val Whiting by leading
the team to a Final Four appearance.
In Powell's tenure at Stanford, the
Cardinal has had limited success in the
NCAA Tournament. While Stanford
made the Elite Eight in 2001-02, it was
bounced in the second round last year
and in 2000-01.
The Cardinal's inability to advance
deep into the tournament has often
been attributed to a weak conference
schedule.
There is no question that things are
different this year and the Cardinal will
face a much tougher Pac-10.
Historically, Stanford has been the
only Pac-10 team to garner a spot in the
AP Poll. Currently, Arizona sits at No.
22 and Oregon, who upset then-No. 10
LSU last week sits at No. 24.
While Pac-10 action doesn't kick off
until late December, Stanford isn't just
going to sit around on its laurels until
then.
The Cardinal's first big test comes
Nov. 30 when No. 10 Georgia travels

to the Farm. The Lady Bulldogs
boast one of the best frontcourts in
the country, featuring the duo of 6-
foot-5 senior forward Christi Thomas
and 6-foot-6 junior forward Kara
Braxton.
Last season, Thomas averaged 16.0
points, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per
game. Braxton was no slouch during
her sophomore season, averaging 15.7
points, 7.3 rebounds and 2.0 blocks per
game.
On Dec. 14, the Cardinal will face its
toughest challenge of the season - a
matchup with No. 3 Tennessee.
The Lady Volunteers lack a clear
cut star this season, but with Pat Sum
mitt the winningest head coach in all of
women's basketball, on the bench, the
Vols are always a title contender.
"We're excited to have Tennessee
come to Stanford, and Georgia," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"[The team] wants to play against the
competition. We really feel the sched
ule that we play prepares us for the con
ference."
The Cardinal has one more top-10
opponent on its schedule in No. 7 Texas
Tech.
The Lady Raiders are led by senior
guard Jia Perkins, who averaged 15.9
points per game and was named honor
able mention All-American last sea
son.
As the squad kicks off the regular
season, it has several injuries that will
be difficult to overcome. Forwards
Azella Perryman and T'Nae Thiel, who
both made significant contributions in
2002, are sidelined with respective
ankle and foot problems.
Additionally, freshman forward
Eziamaka Okafor is down with a torn
Achilles tendon and senior guard Katie
Denny is recovering from a sprained
MCL. Okafor may return to action

sometime midseason and Denny is ex
pected back by the fourth or fifth game
of the regular season.
"It's not something I feel that I can
control," VanDerveer said. "Hopefully
we'll get Azella back by the time we
play Boston. We don't have a timetable
for T'Nae's return yet."
However, the absence of post play
ers such as Thiel, Perryman and Okafor
has paved the way for true freshman
Kristen Newlin. In the Cardinal's sec
ond exhibition game, a 92-86 victory
over Everyone's Internet, Newlin
recorded a double-double with 18
points and 11 rebounds.
"We're very excited about Kristen's
level of play," VanDerveer said. "Had
it not been for the injuries, we probably
wouldn't have found out about it until
mid- or late-season."
