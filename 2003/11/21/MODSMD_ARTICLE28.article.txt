# Cross country teams gear up for NCAAs
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 1 men's cross country
team will be looking for more than
just another shiny National Champi
onship trophy come Monday at
NCAA Finals in Waterloo, Iowa; it
has a chance to go down as the great
est cross country team in Stanford
history.
"Our goal is obviously to win,"
head coach Andy Gerard said, "but
we don't just want to win it, we also
want to run as well as we possibly
can."
If this group performs to its poten
tial, there is no telling what it is capa
ble of. At last year's NCAA Cham
pionships, four Stanford runners fin
ished in the top nine as the Cardinal
swept by the field, scoring less than
half as many points as runner-up
Wisconsin.
Each of those four Stanford run
ners, Grant Robison, Louis Luchini,
Donald Sage and Ian Dobson, are se
niors this year, and of last year's top
10 finishers from other schools only
one, runner-up Alistair Craig of
Arkansas, will compete this year. It
seems that the Cardinal's fleet four
some is poised for an even more
dominant performance.
Add juniors Ryan Hall and Chris
Emme and seniors Adam Tenforde
and Seth Hejny to the mix, and the
Stanford lineup is even more daunt
ing. Hall was Stanford's sixth runner
at the NCAAs last season, placing
37th overall, and he has come on
strong this year. He was the runner
up at the NCAA Pre-Nationals in
October, and he finished second to
Dobson. in the West Regional last
Saturday.
Tenforde took 29th at the NCAAs
last year, and Hejny placed 43rd two
years ago before red-shirting last

season. Emme was injured last year,
but he finished sixth at Regionals.
One of these four will likely be
counted on to score for Stanford.
Gerard says that the team is re
laxed.
"The guys are used to the pressure
of this race," he said. "We're the de
fending Champions, and everything
has worked out well so far this year,
so we don't feel like we have any par
ticular thing to worry about."
To say that everything has worked
out is an understatement, but it
comes from the perspective of a team
for whom great success is routine.
The lead pack at the Pacific-10
Championships was a sea of red as
the Cardinal took five of the top nine
spots, and the team almost swept the
top five spots at the West Regional,
placing five runners in the top six.
The only possible concern is the
fact that Robison has participated in
only one race this season, the Pac-10
Championships, and that Luchini has
not competed for over a month. But
Gerard insists that there is nothing to
worry about, saying, "Everyone's
doing well."
Whether they are doing well
enough to solidify their place in his
tory remains to be seen.
The No. 1 women's team will try
to improve upon last year's second
place finish to BYU. It will depend
on strong performances by juniors
Sara Bei and Alicia Craig, who fin
ished third at Nationals last year, but
is also expecting a lot our of fresh
men Arianna Lambie, Amanda Trot
ter and Katy Trotter.
"It will be exciting because they
don't have a lot of experience, which
adds an interesting factor," Craig
said.
She does not, however, think that
they will have trouble dealing with
the pressures of the race.

"I'm not worried about them be
cause they all competed at the na
tional level in high school, and they
are all very good athletes."
Head coach Dena Evans said that
the team's goal is not necessarily to
win.
"We want to have a strong perfor
mance that reflects the work we've
done over the year," Evans said.
"We will prepare ourselves as best
we can, but we can only worry about
ourselves, not about the other
teams."
Craig agrees.
"We can only be the best we can
be," she said. "I just want to leave
the course knowing that I ran as hard
as I could."
In terms of preparation and strat
egy, Craig said that the team is treat
ing this race like they would any
other.
"Nationals is just like any other
race," she said. "We have to run
from point A to point B, fast. It's still
just one foot in front of the other."
Evans seconded that opinion. She
said that the team has been building
towards this race all season long, and
that the meet is merely an extension
of what they have been doing all
year.
"We will try to re-create the same
rhythms and patterns that we have got
ten into in previous races," she said.
That seems to be a good strategy,
especially considering the inexperi
ence of the freshmen and the success
the Cardinal has had in recent races.
Bei and Craig crossed the line in first
and second place, respectively, at the
Pac-10 Championships, and Lambie
and both Katy and Amanda Trotter
finished in the top 10. If the team can
re-create that success at the National
Championships, it will have a good
shot at capturing its first title since
1996.

"We can only be the best we can
be," she said. "I just want to leave
the course knowing that I ran as hard
as I could."
In terms of preparation and strat
egy, Craig said that the team is treat
ing this race like they would any
other.
"Nationals is just like any other
race," she said. "We have to run
from point A to point B, fast. It's still
just one foot in front of the other."
Evans seconded that opinion. She
said that the team has been building
towards this race all season long, and
that the meet is merely an extension
of what they have been doing all
year.
"We will try to re-create the same
rhythms and patterns that we have got
ten into in previous races," she said.
That seems to be a good strategy,
especially considering the inexperi
ence of the freshmen and the success
the Cardinal has had in recent races.
Bei and Craig crossed the line in first
and second place, respectively, at the
Pac-10 Championships, and Lambie
and both Katy and Amanda Trotter
finished in the top 10. If the team can
re-create that success at the National
Championships, it will have a good
shot at capturing its first title since
1996.

The men's cross country team hopes not only to cross the finish line and gain a NCAA Championship, but
to also go down in history as one of the top teams ever to compete.
The No. 1 men's cross country
team will be looking for more than
just another shiny National Champi
onship trophy come Monday at
NCAA Finals in Waterloo, Iowa; it
has a chance to go down as the great
est cross country team in Stanford
history.
"Our goal is obviously to win,"
head coach Andy Gerard said, "but
we don't just want to win it, we also
want to run as well as we possibly
can."
If this group performs to its poten
tial, there is no telling what it is capa
ble of. At last year's NCAA Cham
pionships, four Stanford runners fin
ished in the top nine as the Cardinal
swept by the field, scoring less than
half as many points as runner-up
Wisconsin.
Each of those four Stanford run
ners, Grant Robison, Louis Luchini,
Donald Sage and Ian Dobson, are se
niors this year, and of last year's top
10 finishers from other schools only
one, runner-up Alistair Craig of
Arkansas, will compete this year. It
seems that the Cardinal's fleet four
some is poised for an even more
dominant performance.
Add juniors Ryan Hall and Chris
Emme and seniors Adam Tenforde
and Seth Hejny to the mix, and the
Stanford lineup is even more daunt
ing. Hall was Stanford's sixth runner
at the NCAAs last season, placing
37th overall, and he has come on
strong this year. He was the runner
up at the NCAA Pre-Nationals in
October, and he finished second to
Dobson. in the West Regional last
Saturday.
Tenforde took 29th at the NCAAs
last year, and Hejny placed 43rd two
years ago before red-shirting last

season. Emme was injured last year,
but he finished sixth at Regionals.
One of these four will likely be
counted on to score for Stanford.
Gerard says that the team is re
laxed.
"The guys are used to the pressure
of this race," he said. "We're the de
fending Champions, and everything
has worked out well so far this year,
so we don't feel like we have any par
ticular thing to worry about."
To say that everything has worked
out is an understatement, but it
comes from the perspective of a team
for whom great success is routine.
The lead pack at the Pacific-10
Championships was a sea of red as
the Cardinal took five of the top nine
spots, and the team almost swept the
top five spots at the West Regional,
placing five runners in the top six.
The only possible concern is the
fact that Robison has participated in
only one race this season, the Pac-10
Championships, and that Luchini has
not competed for over a month. But
Gerard insists that there is nothing to
worry about, saying, "Everyone's
doing well."
Whether they are doing well
enough to solidify their place in his
tory remains to be seen.
The No. 1 women's team will try
to improve upon last year's second
place finish to BYU. It will depend
on strong performances by juniors
Sara Bei and Alicia Craig, who fin
ished third at Nationals last year, but
is also expecting a lot our of fresh
men Arianna Lambie, Amanda Trot
ter and Katy Trotter.
"It will be exciting because they
don't have a lot of experience, which
adds an interesting factor," Craig
said.
She does not, however, think that
they will have trouble dealing with
the pressures of the race.

"I'm not worried about them be
cause they all competed at the na
tional level in high school, and they
are all very good athletes."
Head coach Dena Evans said that
the team's goal is not necessarily to
win.
"We want to have a strong perfor
mance that reflects the work we've
done over the year," Evans said.
"We will prepare ourselves as best
we can, but we can only worry about
ourselves, not about the other
teams."
Craig agrees.
"We can only be the best we can
be," she said. "I just want to leave
the course knowing that I ran as hard
as I could."
In terms of preparation and strat
egy, Craig said that the team is treat
ing this race like they would any
other.
"Nationals is just like any other
race," she said. "We have to run
from point A to point B, fast. It's still
just one foot in front of the other."
