# Experience lacking in men's basketball

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Carmelo Anthony has departed, and Lebron
James never arrived. All 15 of last year's NCAA
basketball All-Americans are gone.
Star players are deciding in record numbers to join
the NBA directly after high school or after abbreviated
college careers, so top veteran talent has become a rare
commodity among NCAA basketball teams this year.
And those who have it, such as Connecticut, Missouri
and even St. Joseph's, are expected to go far.
The Huskies are ranked No. 1 in the nation in
both preseason polls, thanks to a tandem of talent
ed juniors. Six-foot-10 forward Emeka Okafor is a
fierce rebounder and shot-blocker, who also has
impressive post moves on offense. Six-foot-2 guard
Ben Gordon is a dynamic scorer who is familiar to
Stanford fans because of his dominating 29-point
performance against the Cardinal in last year's
NCAA Tournament.
Missouri, ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press
poll and No. 6 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches'
poll, boasts two of the top seniors in the nation.
Arthur Johnson, a 6-foot-9 bruiser, and Rickey
Paulding, a 6-foot-5 swingman, came to Missouri
from Michigan with the intent of winning a nation
al championship together.
Jameer Nelson of tiny St. Joseph's, who helped
the Hawks nearly beat a heavily favored Stanford
team in the tournament his freshman year, is now a
senior and is generally regarded as the best point
guard in the country. He nearly posted a triple-dou
ble in his first game this season as the then-No. 17
Hawks toppled No. 10 Gonzaga, 73-66. Nelson will
get help from senior Tyrone Barley and junior De
lonte West as St. Joseph's, now ranked No. 13,
makes a run at the NCAA Tournament.
Despite Gonzaga's loss to St. Joseph's, the Zags
are still being picked by many to reach the late
rounds of the NCAA Tournament. Sports Illustrat
ed ranked them No. 3 in the country. That's be
cause Gonzaga, which travels to Stanford on Dec.
20, boasts a starting lineup with four seniors, in
cluding three-point bomber Blake Stepp.
As important as veteran leadership is, Carmelo
Anthony's performance for Syracuse last year
proved that a freshman can carry a team to the na
tional championship. Lebron James, the nation's
best high school senior last year by a wide margin,
might have found similar success had he gone to
college this year, but he instead became the first
pick in the NBA draft, ahead of even Anthony.
In the absence of Anthony and James, the team

with the most impressive collection of young talent
might be Duke, ranked No. 2 in both polls. The
Blue Devils return four sophomores who were Mc-
Donald's Ail-Americans in high school, and this
year they add to that mix Luol Deng, considered by
some to be the most skilled freshman in the coun
try.
Deng, a 6-foot-8 forward, will join senior floor leader
Chris Duhon, Casey Jacobsen-esque sophomore JJ.
Redick and a host of other former high school standouts
on a team that has enormous talent, 5 not experience, at
every position.
No. 6 Kansas lost a pair of Ail-Americans (Nick
Collison and Kirk Hinirich) and its longtime coach
(Roy Williams) from last year's team, but heralded
freshmen David Padgett and J.R. Giddens may be
good enough to take this year's team back to the
Final Four.
That's if they can crack the starting lineup, given
the presence of four returning players with starting
experience, including Ail-American candidate
Wayne Simien. The Jayhawks play Stanford on
Dec. 6 at the Wooden Classic in Los Angeles.
Among Pacific 10 Conference teams, only Ari
zona figures prominently in the national rankings.
The No. 4 Wildcats don't have a single scholarship
senior on their roster, but junior center Channing
Frye, sophomore forwards Andre Iguodala and
Hassan Adams, and junior guard Salim Stoudamire
are all extremely athletic.
Stanford is ranked No. 17 going into the season,
and many predict the Cardinal will rise higher than
that if sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez
can stay healthy.
No other Pac-10 team is in the Top 25, but Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said that doesn't
mean the league won't be strong.
"The teams at the bottom of the conference
haven't always been as competitive, and I think
you'll see that that's not the case this year," Mont
gomery said. He pointed to the Washington schools
and Oregon State as teams that should be better
than usual this year.
California, Oregon, Arizona State and UCLA
are all ranked between 26 and 41 in the Associated
Press preseason poll, and Southern California is
ranked 46.
California freshman Leon Powe, Oregon senior
Luke Jackson and Arizona State sophomore Ike
Diogu figure to be among the top players in the
conference. All three are forwards who can both
score and rebound.
"I think the league will be really competitive,"
Montgomery said.

James never arrived. All 15 of last year's NCAA
basketball All-Americans are gone.
Star players are deciding in record numbers to join
the NBA directly after high school or after abbreviated
college careers, so top veteran talent has become a rare
commodity among NCAA basketball teams this year.
And those who have it, such as Connecticut, Missouri
and even St. Joseph's, are expected to go far.
The Huskies are ranked No. 1 in the nation in
both preseason polls, thanks to a tandem of talent
ed juniors. Six-foot-10 forward Emeka Okafor is a
fierce rebounder and shot-blocker, who also has
impressive post moves on offense. Six-foot-2 guard
Ben Gordon is a dynamic scorer who is familiar to
Stanford fans because of his dominating 29-point
performance against the Cardinal in last year's
NCAA Tournament.
Missouri, ranked No. 5 in the Associated Press
poll and No. 6 in the ESPN/USA Today coaches'
poll, boasts two of the top seniors in the nation.
Arthur Johnson, a 6-foot-9 bruiser, and Rickey
Paulding, a 6-foot-5 swingman, came to Missouri
from Michigan with the intent of winning a nation
al championship together.
Jameer Nelson of tiny St. Joseph's, who helped
the Hawks nearly beat a heavily favored Stanford
team in the tournament his freshman year, is now a
senior and is generally regarded as the best point
guard in the country. He nearly posted a triple-dou
ble in his first game this season as the then-No. 17
Hawks toppled No. 10 Gonzaga, 73-66. Nelson will
get help from senior Tyrone Barley and junior De
lonte West as St. Joseph's, now ranked No. 13,
makes a run at the NCAA Tournament.
Despite Gonzaga's loss to St. Joseph's, the Zags
are still being picked by many to reach the late
rounds of the NCAA Tournament. Sports Illustrat
ed ranked them No. 3 in the country. That's be
cause Gonzaga, which travels to Stanford on Dec.
20, boasts a starting lineup with four seniors, in
cluding three-point bomber Blake Stepp.
As important as veteran leadership is, Carmelo
Anthony's performance for Syracuse last year
proved that a freshman can carry a team to the na
tional championship. Lebron James, the nation's
best high school senior last year by a wide margin,
might have found similar success had he gone to
college this year, but he instead became the first
pick in the NBA draft, ahead of even Anthony.
In the absence of Anthony and James, the team

with the most impressive collection of young talent
might be Duke, ranked No. 2 in both polls. The
Blue Devils return four sophomores who were Mc-
Donald's Ail-Americans in high school, and this
year they add to that mix Luol Deng, considered by
some to be the most skilled freshman in the coun
try.
Deng, a 6-foot-8 forward, will join senior floor leader
Chris Duhon, Casey Jacobsen-esque sophomore JJ.
Redick and a host of other former high school standouts
on a team that has enormous talent, 5 not experience, at
every position.
No. 6 Kansas lost a pair of Ail-Americans (Nick
Collison and Kirk Hinirich) and its longtime coach
(Roy Williams) from last year's team, but heralded
freshmen David Padgett and J.R. Giddens may be
good enough to take this year's team back to the
Final Four.
That's if they can crack the starting lineup, given
the presence of four returning players with starting
experience, including Ail-American candidate
Wayne Simien. The Jayhawks play Stanford on
Dec. 6 at the Wooden Classic in Los Angeles.
Among Pacific 10 Conference teams, only Ari
zona figures prominently in the national rankings.
The No. 4 Wildcats don't have a single scholarship
senior on their roster, but junior center Channing
Frye, sophomore forwards Andre Iguodala and
Hassan Adams, and junior guard Salim Stoudamire
are all extremely athletic.
Stanford is ranked No. 17 going into the season,
and many predict the Cardinal will rise higher than
that if sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez
can stay healthy.
No other Pac-10 team is in the Top 25, but Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said that doesn't
mean the league won't be strong.
"The teams at the bottom of the conference
haven't always been as competitive, and I think
you'll see that that's not the case this year," Mont
gomery said. He pointed to the Washington schools
and Oregon State as teams that should be better
than usual this year.
California, Oregon, Arizona State and UCLA
are all ranked between 26 and 41 in the Associated
Press preseason poll, and Southern California is
ranked 46.
California freshman Leon Powe, Oregon senior
Luke Jackson and Arizona State sophomore Ike
Diogu figure to be among the top players in the
conference. All three are forwards who can both
score and rebound.
"I think the league will be really competitive,"
Montgomery said.
