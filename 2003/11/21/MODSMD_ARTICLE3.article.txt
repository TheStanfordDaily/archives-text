# Art Miller
## The
						last of the 1930 Immortals 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
"I requested this interview because I'm the last one
left," Art Miller said nonchalantly as we sat down to chat
on Homecoming Weekend in the Arillaga Alumni Center
with his son by his side. "And when I'm gone there will be
no one to make sure that the story is told right."
Perhaps you don't know him by name, but Miller —
Class of 1931 and a former Cardinal baseball player —
has secured himself a place in the history books at Stan
ford. He's a nameless part of the folklore — a legend in
his own right.
He is the last remaining member of the Immortal 21, a
group of Stanford men who regained The Axe from Cali
fornia after a 31-year absence.
The story of "The 21" and The Axe in many ways takes
us back to a simpler time when the sawed-off red hatchet
existed more as source of extreme pride than a football
trophy. There was a sense of ownership for Stanford stu
dents back then that far exceeded the likes of Gaieties and
bon fires, tailgate parties and Big Game victories. It was a
time in which Stanford students really cared about the ri
valry — when school spirit wasn't treated with a sense of
seeming ambivalence.
On April 13 in the year 1899, The Axe made its first ap
pearance in a rally held by Stanford yell leaders before
game 2 of a best-of-three baseball series against Califor
nia. After the Golden Bears upset Stanford 4-1 in game 1,
The Axe was introduced to Stanford fans in an attempt to
drum up school spirit. During a rally, Stanford yell leaders
decapitated a straw figure dressed in blue and gold with
the new jewel.
When the yell leaders actually arrived at game 2, they
celebrated whenever Stanford made a good play by chop
ping up a piece of blue and gold ribbon, parading the
newly-introduced symbol around for all the Cal fans to

see. The Golden Bears wound up victorious after a late
ninth-inning run, winning the series 2-0.
After the game, however, the true drama began to un
fold. A group of Berkeley students waited for the yell lead
ers at the stadium's exit. A "small" fight ensured and The
Axe was stolen by several Cal students.
Once The Axe was "safe" in Berkeley, the Cal baseball
team and the students who stole The Axe elected an Axe
custodian, who was responsible for transporting the hatch
et to and from a Berkeley bank vault. A few days later, The
Axe made its first appearance at a California rally. It re
mained for the next 31 years... that is, of course, before
The 21 banded together to recover it.
Which is where Art Miller enters the story again,
