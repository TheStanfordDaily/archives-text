# Art Miller
## The 						last of the 1930 Immortals 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
"I requested this interview because I'm the last one
left," Art Miller said nonchalantly as we sat down to chat
on Homecoming Weekend in the Arillaga Alumni Center
with his son by his side. "And when I'm gone there will be
no one to make sure that the story is told right."
Perhaps you don't know him by name, but Miller —
Class of 1931 and a former Cardinal baseball player —
has secured himself a place in the history books at Stan
ford. He's a nameless part of the folklore — a legend in
his own right.
He is the last remaining member of the Immortal 21, a
group of Stanford men who regained The Axe from Cali
fornia after a 31-year absence.
The story of "The 21" and The Axe in many ways takes
us back to a simpler time when the sawed-off red hatchet
existed more as source of extreme pride than a football
trophy. There was a sense of ownership for Stanford stu
dents back then that far exceeded the likes of Gaieties and
bon fires, tailgate parties and Big Game victories. It was a
time in which Stanford students really cared about the ri
valry — when school spirit wasn't treated with a sense of
seeming ambivalence.
On April 13 in the year 1899, The Axe made its first ap
pearance in a rally held by Stanford yell leaders before
game 2 of a best-of-three baseball series against Califor
nia. After the Golden Bears upset Stanford 4-1 in game 1,
The Axe was introduced to Stanford fans in an attempt to
drum up school spirit. During a rally, Stanford yell leaders
decapitated a straw figure dressed in blue and gold with
the new jewel.
When the yell leaders actually arrived at game 2, they
celebrated whenever Stanford made a good play by chop
ping up a piece of blue and gold ribbon, parading the
newly-introduced symbol around for all the Cal fans to

see. The Golden Bears wound up victorious after a late
ninth-inning run, winning the series 2-0.
After the game, however, the true drama began to un
fold. A group of Berkeley students waited for the yell lead
ers at the stadium's exit. A "small" fight ensured and The
Axe was stolen by several Cal students.
Once The Axe was "safe" in Berkeley, the Cal baseball
team and the students who stole The Axe elected an Axe
custodian, who was responsible for transporting the hatch
et to and from a Berkeley bank vault. A few days later, The
Axe made its first appearance at a California rally. It re
mained for the next 31 years... that is, of course, before
The 21 banded together to recover it.
Which is where Art Miller enters the story again,

dressed from head-to-toe in a red suit,
still the "popular-boy" at the Cardinal
Society's Annual Reunion banquet.
Back in 1930, Miller was in his third
year at Stanford and remained a member
of a secret group of Sequoia Men who
were assembled by Stanford student Don
Kropp to regain The Axe.
The ever-changing group of men tried
several times to regain The Axe without
much success. After several close-calls,
Cal took extra precautions to keep The
Axe safe. The Bears stored it in a bank
vault and chartered an armored car to
transport it to and from their annual Axe
Rally.
"[Cal] had it insured for $10,000,"
Miller recounted. "In those days that was
a lot of money because we worked for 50
cents an hour."
"After [we tried to steal it so many

times], Cal got smart and put The Axe in
an armored car," Miller said. "So then
Stanford got an old jalopy and they tried
to wreck the armored car. But the prob
lem was that they couldn't get in after
they wrecked it because it was locked.
So then we thought, 'okay, we'll go over
there and we won't create any suspi
cion.' "
Which is exactly what The 21 did.
On April 3,1930, disguised cleverly as
photographers and Cal students, mem
bers of The 21 rented a car from a local
Berkeley dealer — so that the license
plates would be the same — and made
their way to the Greek Theatre, where
Cal held its annual rally.
"I remember how we watched them
take [The Axe] out of the bank vault, up
to the Greek Theatre," Miller said. "Part
of our group was assigned to ride the ar
mored car back to the bank vault to pro
tect The Axe. And they were rooting for
Cal and that sort of thing so that no one
would suspect that they were really from
Stanford.

"When The Axe made its way back to
the bank, it came back too fast for the real
Cal students to follow and so here we
were, just waiting for them at the steps of
the bank, only ten feet away from its
doors," Miller said. "Norm Horner, The
Axe custodian from Berkeley, arrived at
the bank in the armored car and there
were not too many people there and we
took the car with the photographers and a
fake newspaper camera to take a picture
of the 'Cal' students who stood wanting to
pose for a picture with The Axe."
Horner, however, didn't get out of the
car until he received a signal from inside
the bank.
"When he came out, Howard Avery
who was on top grabbed Horner around
the neck and proceeded to choke him,"
Miller said. "And I was standing under
Horner posed as a Cal student screaming,
'Gimme The Axe! Gimme The Axe! I'll
get it into the bank safely.' But he
wouldn't let go of it. Not more than ten
seconds later he dropped it because he
couldn't breathe."

Robert Loofbourow, a member of The
21, then grabbed it, stuffed it under his
sweater and fled the scene down Tele
graph Avenue in a getaway car back to
Stanford.
At some point during the ordeal,
Miller threw a tear bomb, which further
distracted the surprised California stu
dents.
"It was a tremendous experience,"
Miller said staring off into the distance as
if re-remembering it all. "The glory of
that day was tremendous."
The 21 were heroes that day, as they
were paraded around Stanford's campus
with no sense then of the historic implica
tions of their feat.
They became legends that day — Im
mortals that day.
"So how does it feel to be immortal?" I
asked.
Miller laughed.
"No one's immortal," he said glancing
over to his son who now sat patiently near
the Arillaga courtyard.
"No one."
"I requested this interview because I'm the last one
left," Art Miller said nonchalantly as we sat down to chat

get it into the bank safely.' But he
wouldn't let go of it. Not more than ten
seconds later he dropped it because he
couldn't breathe."

Robert Loofbourow, a member of The
21, then grabbed it, stuffed it under his
sweater and fled the scene down Tele
graph Avenue in a getaway car back to
Stanford.
At some point during the ordeal,
Miller threw a tear bomb, which further
distracted the surprised California stu
dents.
"It was a tremendous experience,"
Miller said staring off into the distance as
if re-remembering it all. "The glory of
that day was tremendous."
The 21 were heroes that day, as they
were paraded around Stanford's campus
with no sense then of the historic implica
tions of their feat.
They became legends that day — Im
mortals that day.
"So how does it feel to be immortal?" I
asked.
Miller laughed.
"No one's immortal," he said glancing
over to his son who now sat patiently near
the Arillaga courtyard.
"No one."
"I requested this interview because I'm the last one
left," Art Miller said nonchalantly as we sat down to chat
on Homecoming Weekend in the Arillaga Alumni Center
with his son by his side. "And when I'm gone there will be
no one to make sure that the story is told right."
Perhaps you don't know him by name, but Miller —
Class of 1931 and a former Cardinal baseball player —
has secured himself a place in the history books at Stan
ford. He's a nameless part of the folklore — a legend in
his own right.
He is the last remaining member of the Immortal 21, a
group of Stanford men who regained The Axe from Cali
fornia after a 31-year absence.
The story of "The 21" and The Axe in many ways takes
us back to a simpler time when the sawed-off red hatchet
existed more as source of extreme pride than a football
trophy. There was a sense of ownership for Stanford stu
dents back then that far exceeded the likes of Gaieties and
bon fires, tailgate parties and Big Game victories. It was a
time in which Stanford students really cared about the ri
valry — when school spirit wasn't treated with a sense of
seeming ambivalence.
On April 13 in the year 1899, The Axe made its first ap
pearance in a rally held by Stanford yell leaders before
game 2 of a best-of-three baseball series against Califor
nia. After the Golden Bears upset Stanford 4-1 in game 1,
The Axe was introduced to Stanford fans in an attempt to
drum up school spirit. During a rally, Stanford yell leaders
decapitated a straw figure dressed in blue and gold with
the new jewel.
When the yell leaders actually arrived at game 2, they
celebrated whenever Stanford made a good play by chop
ping up a piece of blue and gold ribbon, parading the
newly-introduced symbol around for all the Cal fans to

see. The Golden Bears wound up victorious after a late
ninth-inning run, winning the series 2-0.
After the game, however, the true drama began to un
fold. A group of Berkeley students waited for the yell lead
ers at the stadium's exit. A "small" fight ensured and The
Axe was stolen by several Cal students.
Once The Axe was "safe" in Berkeley, the Cal baseball
team and the students who stole The Axe elected an Axe
custodian, who was responsible for transporting the hatch
et to and from a Berkeley bank vault. A few days later, The
Axe made its first appearance at a California rally. It re
mained for the next 31 years... that is, of course, before
The 21 banded together to recover it.
Which is where Art Miller enters the story again,

dressed from head-to-toe in a red suit,
still the "popular-boy" at the Cardinal
Society's Annual Reunion banquet.
Back in 1930, Miller was in his third
year at Stanford and remained a member
of a secret group of Sequoia Men who
were assembled by Stanford student Don
Kropp to regain The Axe.
The ever-changing group of men tried
several times to regain The Axe without
much success. After several close-calls,
Cal took extra precautions to keep The
Axe safe. The Bears stored it in a bank
vault and chartered an armored car to
transport it to and from their annual Axe
Rally.
"[Cal] had it insured for $10,000,"
Miller recounted. "In those days that was
a lot of money because we worked for 50
cents an hour."
"After [we tried to steal it so many

times], Cal got smart and put The Axe in
an armored car," Miller said. "So then
Stanford got an old jalopy and they tried
to wreck the armored car. But the prob
lem was that they couldn't get in after
they wrecked it because it was locked.
So then we thought, 'okay, we'll go over
there and we won't create any suspi
cion.' "
Which is exactly what The 21 did.
On April 3,1930, disguised cleverly as
photographers and Cal students, mem
bers of The 21 rented a car from a local
Berkeley dealer — so that the license
plates would be the same — and made
their way to the Greek Theatre, where
Cal held its annual rally.
"I remember how we watched them
take [The Axe] out of the bank vault, up
to the Greek Theatre," Miller said. "Part
of our group was assigned to ride the ar
mored car back to the bank vault to pro
tect The Axe. And they were rooting for
Cal and that sort of thing so that no one
would suspect that they were really from
Stanford.

"When The Axe made its way back to
the bank, it came back too fast for the real
Cal students to follow and so here we
were, just waiting for them at the steps of
the bank, only ten feet away from its
doors," Miller said. "Norm Horner, The
Axe custodian from Berkeley, arrived at
the bank in the armored car and there
were not too many people there and we
took the car with the photographers and a
fake newspaper camera to take a picture
of the 'Cal' students who stood wanting to
pose for a picture with The Axe."
Horner, however, didn't get out of the
car until he received a signal from inside
the bank.
"When he came out, Howard Avery
who was on top grabbed Horner around
the neck and proceeded to choke him,"
Miller said. "And I was standing under
Horner posed as a Cal student screaming,
'Gimme The Axe! Gimme The Axe! I'll
get it into the bank safely.' But he
wouldn't let go of it. Not more than ten
seconds later he dropped it because he
couldn't breathe."
