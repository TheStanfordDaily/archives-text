# 'Big Splash' features top water polo teams

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At least one men's sport team looks likely to win this Sat
urday when the No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team faces
No. 3 Cal (19-5,8-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) in the
Big Splash at 10 a.m. at the Avery Aquatic Center. The
matchup occurs annually before Big Game and this year's con
test should be thrilling, given the previous games between ri
vals this season.
"It's going to be a really exciting game," said freshman driv
er Marcello Pantuliano. "Last year [at Cal] there were tons of
people there. There's a lot of excitement in the air."
The Cardinal downed the Bears two weeks ago in Cal's
home pool 10-8 and must defend its No. 2 position against a
team out to get even. Stanford is currently 18-3 overall and 7-1
in the MPSF, having lost only to No. 1 Southern California.
"Cal's a pretty good team. We have to match up well and for
this season man for man we can cover them no problem," Pan
tuliano said. "They're a strong team, but we're a smart team."
Stanford has yet to win a Big Splash at the Avery Aquatic
Center.
"This is a huge game for a number of reasons... and [for]
pride. We've never won in our home pool against Cal," junior
driver Tony Azevedo said. "Since Avery's been here we've
gone 0-3. But we're going to change that."
A win against Cal this weekend would cement the Cardi
nal's place as the number two seed in the MPSF tournament
held Nov. 28-30.
"We lost to SC, obviously we didn't want to do that, but it
happened and we'll have to deal with that as best as we can," ju
nior two-meter Greg Crum said.
Stanford lost the championship games of both the Southern
California and Northern California Tournaments in triple
overtime games against the Trojans and the Bears, respective
ly-
"This season has been a tougher one than we usually have
because we've had to deal with getting people time to play and
getting people more accustomed to playing big games and
things like that," junior driver Tony Azevedo said. "It showed
at the beginning of the season. We lost three games almost im
mediately within the first three weeks."
Always a powerful team on offense, the Cardinal has
worked hard this season to improve its defense.

"The difference with out team is that we have so many of
fensive powers," Azevedo said. "At the beginning of the sea
son, we were losing but still scoring 12 goals. We know we can
put goals away, but if we can stop the other team, we're going
to win every game."
Each game must be played now with an eye toward either
winning the MPSF or receiving the at-large bid to the NCAA fi
nals that will be hosted by Stanford on Dec. 7. A second place
seed in the MPSF Tournament would give them an easier path
to the championship game, probably against Cal or Southern
California.
The Cardinal's 10-game winning streak is the longest in the
MPSF this season.
"Our team shows amazing heart and learning," Azevedo
said "We've been on a roll. We've been learning every single
game and playing so well. I think that the big thing about Big
Splash right now is we need to keep winning so we can fuel our
selves from Big Splash to go right through MPSF. Because the
only way we're going to get to NCAAs is to go undefeated in
MPSF."
Saturday morning's game against the Bears is their final
league game of the season.
"We're a great team, we've got a lot of talent," said Pantu
liano. "We're a close team as well. If we just keep playing well
as a team, we're going to go out strong."
Pantuliano redshirted last season, and this year will be his
first Big Splash with a shot at time in the pool. He's found play
ing this season to be a great experience.
"It's a lot different after your redshirt year," he said. "As
more a part of the team, you get a lot closer with the guys. I feel
like I've made more of a connection with the team."
The Big Splash will be senior utility Mike Derse's final
league game of his Stanford career, and if Cardinal fails to qual
ify for the NCAA Finals it may be his last game at Avery. But
signs look promising for a Cardinal appearance in this year's fi
nals, especially if it beats the Bears in the Big Splash.
The two teams will be playing for The Heaston Trophy —
presented to the winner of the annual Big Splash — in honor of
former Cal coach Steve Heaston.
When the two foes last met at Berkeley, they fought before
a sell-out crowd of over 1,000 people. Expect similar atten
dance this Saturday.
"They lost in their pool last year, so they think it's their turn,
but it's not at all," Azevedo said. "We're going to take them."
