# Dilemma: Go to Big Game or go to Vegas?
## 
### 
I refuse to pay $52 for Big Game to
morrow. Not because Cal tickets pre
sold for $17, not because the sports
editor can get me in for free (she
can't), not even because I'd rather spend it
eating exorbitant amounts of pecan pra
line ice cream.
Because it's just ridiculous.
(For one and a half Big Game tickets,
by the way, you can fly direct to Vegas
with two nights in a hotel on Southwest
Airlines. And have $3 left over to pull the
dollar slots three times.)
Stanford has such a mediocre spectator
turnout anyway — think Rose Bowl 2000,
where all 100 Stanford fans were over
whelmed and engulfed in a sea of cheese
heads all the way from Wisconsin —
you'd think they would lower ticket prices
and get more seats filled. You'd think they
wanted more spectators.
Then again, most of you already forked

over all $52.
The student body
spectator apathy dates
all the way back to 1899,
when the yell squad de
cided to rally the student
body by bringing Stan
ford the Axe.
And it worked. The
Axe quickly became
such an emblem of the
budding Cal-Stanford
rivalry that its safekeep-

ing involved the police chief, a vault, a cut
finger and for the next 30 years, trans
portation in an armored car.
A hundred and four years later, the
Axe Committee is still around to safe
guard and care for the Axe. And I thought
jumping through hoops to win points to
wait in line to pay to watch basketball
games was pointless, but that's Sixth Man
Club.
The Axe Committee takes fanatical
pointlessness to a new level. Imagine your
self this morning at 5 a.m. You're not up
partying because you go to Stanford, re
member? In Palo Alto? You're not pulling
an all-nighter studying, not even kept
awake by the sex-crazed housemates up
stairs (oh wait, that's me). You're standing
in White Plaza, freezing your ass off, vigi
lantly surveying the perimeter for Cal in
truders and guarding absolutely nothing,
since Cal won back the Axe last year.
Or maybe just hanging out on fluffy
couches and blowing a train whistle every
hour. The Committee, the nationally ac
claimed crazy Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, the annual
raunchy nudefest known as Gaieties —
lame appendages of the football program
and Big Game hype? Pathetic non
athletes?
Not by a long shot. Gaieties may owe
its sole existence to Big Game, but I can at
test first-hand that Gaieties has nothing to
do with football fanaticism. It's a cult. I'm
a 2000 member. Bandies do drugs and
crazy things like getting banned from
states and airlines, but the shock value
alone is priceless. In Dick Vitale's words,
"The future lawyers, doctors, and busi
nessmen of the U.S.A.???!!!" Yes, Dick!
Then there are Axe Committee members,
and while some of them really love college
football, a lot of them joined forces for the
social camaraderie and perks.
Wait, Axers get perks? Kind of. They
get to run around the field while you are in
the bleachers, they get free food this week,
they don't pay for Flicks.
They do pay for Big Game.
See? Football doesn't care about the
Committee, the Committee won't really
go into group counseling if Cal kicks our
ass tomorrow. They'll go to their less
than-weekly-now-that-Big-Game-ended
club meetings. They don't even get their
sweatshirts for free.
Call it cultural capitalism. Big Game
generates big things. Sweatshirt orders
and student groups and rallies and pro
ductions and catering and a special high
security case for a dull old Axe. And big
ticket revenues, including the Axe Com
mittee's $35 tickets. ($18 more than Cal
pre-sale tickets = 18 slot pulls).
Someone is making money off your
ticket. Then again, this is the same institu
tion that makes student groups spend their
special fees renting out MemAud, Dinkel
spiel, etcetera to put on productions. And
ASSU fees come from you anyway.
Oh, the capitalist horrors of our won
derful institution! So scandalous! So sad!
Long story short, put in a little critical
thinking before you shell out your money.
This is perhaps not an automatic process
for the large proportion of us who have yet
to work more than two summers part-time
in our lives, and whose parents shell out
the student contribution of financial aid
packages. Hey, I'm guilty too, but this year
I refuse to pay.
Scalp a Cal ticket after the kickoff?
Maybe. Wake up in a post-tailgate lot of
spilled red party cups and hamburger gris
tle? Let's hope not. Shell out $52 to show
up two hours into the game, still reeling off
of 8 a.m. jello shots, pass out, wake up to
get hit in the head with a rock launched by
some bitter Cal student, and go back to
sleep? No, that was sophomore year.

I refuse to pay $52 for Big Game to
morrow. Not because Cal tickets pre
sold for $17, not because the sports
editor can get me in for free (she
can't), not even because I'd rather spend it
eating exorbitant amounts of pecan pra
line ice cream.
Because it's just ridiculous.
(For one and a half Big Game tickets,
by the way, you can fly direct to Vegas
with two nights in a hotel on Southwest
Airlines. And have $3 left over to pull the
dollar slots three times.)
Stanford has such a mediocre spectator
turnout anyway — think Rose Bowl 2000,
where all 100 Stanford fans were over
whelmed and engulfed in a sea of cheese
heads all the way from Wisconsin —
you'd think they would lower ticket prices
and get more seats filled. You'd think they
wanted more spectators.
Then again, most of you already forked

over all $52.
The student body
spectator apathy dates
all the way back to 1899,
when the yell squad de
cided to rally the student
body by bringing Stan
ford the Axe.
And it worked. The
Axe quickly became
such an emblem of the
budding Cal-Stanford
rivalry that its safekeep-

ing involved the police chief, a vault, a cut
finger and for the next 30 years, trans
portation in an armored car.
A hundred and four years later, the
Axe Committee is still around to safe
guard and care for the Axe. And I thought
jumping through hoops to win points to
wait in line to pay to watch basketball
games was pointless, but that's Sixth Man
Club.
The Axe Committee takes fanatical
pointlessness to a new level. Imagine your
self this morning at 5 a.m. You're not up
partying because you go to Stanford, re
member? In Palo Alto? You're not pulling
an all-nighter studying, not even kept
awake by the sex-crazed housemates up
stairs (oh wait, that's me). You're standing
in White Plaza, freezing your ass off, vigi
lantly surveying the perimeter for Cal in
truders and guarding absolutely nothing,
since Cal won back the Axe last year.
Or maybe just hanging out on fluffy
couches and blowing a train whistle every
hour. The Committee, the nationally ac
claimed crazy Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, the annual
raunchy nudefest known as Gaieties —
lame appendages of the football program
and Big Game hype? Pathetic non
athletes?
Not by a long shot. Gaieties may owe
its sole existence to Big Game, but I can at
test first-hand that Gaieties has nothing to
do with football fanaticism. It's a cult. I'm
a 2000 member. Bandies do drugs and
crazy things like getting banned from
states and airlines, but the shock value
alone is priceless. In Dick Vitale's words,
"The future lawyers, doctors, and busi
nessmen of the U.S.A.???!!!" Yes, Dick!
Then there are Axe Committee members,
and while some of them really love college
football, a lot of them joined forces for the
social camaraderie and perks.
Wait, Axers get perks? Kind of. They
get to run around the field while you are in
the bleachers, they get free food this week,
they don't pay for Flicks.
They do pay for Big Game.
See? Football doesn't care about the
Committee, the Committee won't really
go into group counseling if Cal kicks our
ass tomorrow. They'll go to their less
than-weekly-now-that-Big-Game-ended
club meetings. They don't even get their
sweatshirts for free.
Call it cultural capitalism. Big Game
generates big things. Sweatshirt orders
and student groups and rallies and pro
ductions and catering and a special high
security case for a dull old Axe. And big
ticket revenues, including the Axe Com
mittee's $35 tickets. ($18 more than Cal
pre-sale tickets = 18 slot pulls).
Someone is making money off your
ticket. Then again, this is the same institu
tion that makes student groups spend their
special fees renting out MemAud, Dinkel
spiel, etcetera to put on productions. And
ASSU fees come from you anyway.
Oh, the capitalist horrors of our won
derful institution! So scandalous! So sad!
Long story short, put in a little critical
thinking before you shell out your money.
This is perhaps not an automatic process
for the large proportion of us who have yet
to work more than two summers part-time
in our lives, and whose parents shell out
the student contribution of financial aid
packages. Hey, I'm guilty too, but this year
I refuse to pay.
Scalp a Cal ticket after the kickoff?
Maybe. Wake up in a post-tailgate lot of
spilled red party cups and hamburger gris
tle? Let's hope not. Shell out $52 to show
up two hours into the game, still reeling off
of 8 a.m. jello shots, pass out, wake up to
get hit in the head with a rock launched by
some bitter Cal student, and go back to
sleep? No, that was sophomore year.
