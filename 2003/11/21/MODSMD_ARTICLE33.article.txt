# U Conn women open title defense on top
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women are the media's and coaches
unabashed pick for top honors in the Pacific 10 Con
ference this season, but does Stanford have what it
takes to be a preeminent national team? Looking at the
competition this season, it will take a lot of effort and
probably an equal amount of luck for the Cardinal to
garner a top national ranking. And it would be a long
shot for Stanford, or any team for that matter, to beat
out top-ranked UConn for the top spot.
The strong teams from last season are expected to
have strong showings once again, with UConn, Duke,
Tennessee and Texas — last year's Final Four contes
tants — filling in the top spots in the preseason ratings.
The venerable Huskies made history last season as
the first team to win the championship without a senior
on its roster. Now, UConn will see the return of every
player from its national championship team of last sea
son, including senior Diana Taurasi, the National Play
er of the Year.
Taurasi is the nation's most highly regarded
women's college player. Huskies Coach Geno Auriem
ma has been quoted several times saying "We have
Taurasi. That's a difference," in explaining UConn's
dominance these past few seasons.
"No other program has been to five straight Final
Fours," Auriemma told ESPN. "If we win another na
tional championship this year, Diana Taurasi is ar
guably the greatest college basketball player of all
time."
Both Taurasi and sophomore Ann Strother are on
the watch list for the National Player award. (Duke,
Kansas State, LSU, Penn State, Tennessee and Texas
all have multiple players nominated for the award. Se
nior Nicole Powell is on the list for Stanford.) The
Huskies open the season as the two-time defending na
tional champions and at the top spot in the coach's poll.
Duke enters the season not much worse off with
four starters from last year's Final Four team, as do
many of the top ranked teams.
At end of last [season] I thought you would see that
of the top 10-15 schools of last [season], 90 percent
would be better this year because they were all return
ing either four or five starters," Duke Coach Gail
Goestenkors told The Los Angeles Times. "But every
where I turn teams seem to be returning three or four

starters."
The team is led by senior Alana Beard, who's bro
ken a score of school records and is one of the top picks
for National Player of the Year, along with UConn's
Taurasi. She is the second Duke player, male or female,
to tally 2,000 career points in three seasons and is 217
points from becoming the Blue Devil's career-leading
scorer.
Despite the Huskies preeminence and the return of
their strong starters, some think this might be women's
basketball's most competitive season since the NCAA
championships began more than 20 years ago.
"This could be a watershed year for the game,"
Villanova Coach Harry Paretta told The Los Ange
les. "You have a number of teams that could win the
national championship."His unranked Wildcats
have two starters returning from last year's Elite
Eight line-up.
Many of the top national teams are also facing
harder schedules than in years past, going for tougher
games rather than easier wins. This could make a dif
ference in the national rankings, causing frequent
fluctuations as the premiere teams compete against
one another, and it could make a huge difference to
the Cardinal who are playing Georgia, Texas Tech
and Tennessee
The Pac 10 is generally thought of as a weaker con
ference for college basketball with only two teams in
the top-25 — Arizona's ranked 22 preseason — and
pundits attribute Stanford's early losses in the national
tournament to lack of competition closer to home.
In comparison, five teams from the Big 12 are in the
coaches' preseason top-25 poll, including Texas,
Kansas State and Texas Tech in the top 10. The
Longhorns gave UConn a scare in last year's semifinals
and see the return of four of their top scorers. Last year
was their first final four appearance since 1987, but
their chances look good for another visit. In the SEC,
LSU or Georgia may have the chance to upset the Lady
Vols of Tennessee, who have won six straight confer
ence titles but lost three of their top players at the end
of last season.
Stanford with its No. 6 ranking is the only Pac-10
team in the top 10, and that is probably figuring on a
healthy line up. Though Stanford has five starters from
last year's squad, many are currently out with injuries.
Luck will play her biggest role early on this season if the
Cardinal women recover and can fill out the bench.
