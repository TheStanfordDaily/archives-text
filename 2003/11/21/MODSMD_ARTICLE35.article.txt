# Volleyball sweeps Ducks at Maples
## 
### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the No. 7 Stanford women's volleyball
team, this was as easy as it is going to get from
here on out. Hosting Pac-10 cellar dweller Ore
gon, the Cardinal made quick work of the
Ducks, winning in three games, 30-10, 30-20,
30-20.
The win brought the Cardinal to a 20-6 record
with a 12-4 mark in the Pac-10. Oregon re
mained winless in conference this year, dropping
to 0-17, and 3-23 overall. More importantly,
Stanford clinched second place in the Pac-10 this
season, behind top-ranked USC.
"Our goal is always to win the Pac-10, but
[USC] is a very good team this year, one of the
best I've ever seen, so we're going to have to
fight them to the end," said Stanford head coach
John Dunning.
The Cardinal dominated the match from the
start, grabbing a quick 5-2 lead. Oregon errors
further opened the gap, as the Cardinal took a 9-
3 advantage. After a questionable call gave Ore
gon a point, Dunning began to question the ref
eree.
"I wasn't questioning the call, rather the fact
that the refs may not have followed protocol,"
said Dunning. "There are certain ways things are
supposed to be done, and it was not done the
way it should have been."
Regardless, Stanford answered with a four
point run to bring the score to 15-4, as the Ducks
called a timeout. From there, the Cardinal rolled
to a 30-10 victory, holding Oregon to a negative
hitting percentage (-.172) while hitting over .500
as a team.
Oregon played a bit tighter in game two, but
still could not stem the tide of the Cardinal at
tack, which talhed 20 kills in the game. Trailing

20-11, Oregon trimmed the deficit to 20-16 be
fore Stanford put the game out of reach with a
10-4 run.
Game three was more of the same, as the Car
dinal came out dominant after the break. Stan
ford built a 20-9 lead and never looked back for
the match-clinching victory.
"I feel bad for Oregon," said Dunning of the
ease with which his team won. "They lost their
setter last week and it's hard to just put a new
setter in the game and be competitive."
With the Cardinal controlling the match from
the start, Dunning inserted players who don't
see a lot of playing time into the lineup. Every
member of the Cardinal team saw action, in
cluding all four freshmen at one point in the
match.
"I was happy to be able to put everyone in be
cause they've all earned that right," Dunning
said. "Everyone works their butts off every day
in practice."
Last night's match also featured an inter
esting switch at the libero position. Junior
Leahi Hall returned to the position, moving
sophomore Courtney Schultz to a serving po
sition.
"We made the move to let Courtney practice
her jump serve," said Dunning. "We had just dis
covered she had it in practice one day and want
ed her to try it in a game."
"I was just playing around in practice and
coach Dunning asked me why I didn't use that in
a game," said Schultz. "I like doing it, and the po
sition change is only really a change in jersey
color."
(The libero wears a different color jersey
than the other players on the court.)
Stanford takes on Oregon State tonight at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion. The match will be
