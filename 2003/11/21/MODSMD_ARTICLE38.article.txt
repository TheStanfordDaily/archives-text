# Mac cries into his beer for his last Big Game
## 
### 
This marks the third consecutive year that
I have a written a Big Game column for
The Daily. Two years ago, I wrote about
how I didn't care at all about the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry. I went to Big Game that year, of
course — I used to go to all of the Stanford games.
(But, remember, we're talking about the T-Dub
era, which is to the Teevens era what "Seinfeld" is
to Norm MacDonald's new show "A Minute with
Stan Hooper.") Clearly I didn't care too much
about the outcome because I got so drunk at the
game that I blacked out by the third quarter and
somehow ended up at the Taco Bell on El Camino
Real by the time Cal tried to mount a fourth quar
ter comeback. But, from what I could piece to
gether, the Cardinal put on quite a show.
For last year's Big Game column, I wrote
about how I thought our esteemed squad of Yell
Leaders was an absolute embarrassment to Stan
ford, evading the issue of Big Game altogether —
and unleashing a huge response of letters in the
process (almost all in favor of my harangue, which
says a lot about the popularity of Yell Leaders).

Last year, our young football
team was dreadful and Cal, led
by current NFL QB Kyle
Boiler, had us overmatched
from the start. For me, there
was no real reason to dwell on
the actual game itself in my col
umn.
This year, things are differ
ent.
Maybe I'm getting soft with
my "senior" status, but I think I

might have finally contracted — I mean, been
blessed with — some school spirit. Perhaps it had
something to do with watching the entire Cal stu
dent body rush their field after the Bears abused
us in ways that made Michael Jackson jealous.
For whatever reason, I can honestly say that I
do care about tomorrow's game.
In my three-plus years at Stanford, I have al
ways looked at the Stanford-Cal rivalry as sort of
an oddity. By all accounts, it's obvious that Cal
students absolutely hate us — and we, on the
other hand, don't give two s—ts about them.
It's sort of a Britney-Christina-type thing. You
can tell that Britney doesn't care whatsoever
about Ms. Aguilera, but Christina has lived in the
shadow of Britney ever since they were kids on
"The New Mickey Mouse Club." Britney's hotter
and unbelievably more successful, and Christina
has been forced to turn herself into a dirty whore
just to compete. And, despite her dirtiness, she
still can't come close.
That's the way it is with our two schools. We're
obviously better academically and we beat Cal
like a red-headed stepchild in almost every ath
letic endeavor. Hell, 90 percent of the kids are at
Berkeley only because they couldn't get in here.
I have no doubt that the Berkeley student
body will flood our school tomorrow from their
pregame tailgates on. They are going to be drunk,
loud and obsessed with the fact that they might fi
nally be better than Stanford at something.
So, in my keynote Big Game address, I have a
heart-felt message for all of you reading this col
umn. Get drunker, louder and, please, start some
ruckus.
I know that the NQ — "nerd quotient" — on
this campus is higher than a Robert Downey Jr.
party on New Year's Eve. I know that many of
you are more worried about finishing your Chem
problem set that's due during finals week than
getting wasted at Big Game. But put that aside for
a couple hours tomorrow.
Wake up early, fuel up with some liquid
courage and pretend, just for a day, that Stanford
is more than just some elite academic institution
— like the words on John Belushi's shirt so beau
tifully say, it's COLLEGE. I'm begging you.
As far as the game itself goes, even as 10-point
underdogs, Stanford shouldn't be counted out.
We've got some real playmakers on this team,
and I don't mean ESPN's crack-addict-gun-tot
ing-type playmakers — although, some of those
guys might really bring our intensity up a couple
notches.
J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon definitely give
Stapford a formidable rushing attack, the defense
is scrappy and guys like Luke Powell just seem to
make things happen when they get their hands on
the ball.
Actually, I'm going to make a guarantee about
the game. If Powell gets more touches than the
Serial Groper on his mid-day ride through the
Quad, the Cardinal will cruise to an easy victory.
But, to be honest, I'm not filling up space in
The Daily to talk about x's-and-o's.
Instead, I am writing to implore you to come
out tomorrow and take advantage of one of the
few things that the University has been unable
to drain the fun out of: a real college football ri
valry. As a point of reference, more than
100,000 people will pack Michigan Stadium in
Ann Arbor to watch tomorrow's showdown be
tween Michigan and Ohio State, and, in the
state of Alabama, some jackass will no doubt
shoot his unique mixture of uncle / brother /
nephew over a heated argument about the
Auburn / Alabama game.
I'm not asking you to break out the firearms.
All I'm asking you do is re-introduce yourself to
an old friend named Jack (Daniels) or (Bloody)
Mary, come out to the stadium and support
Stanford in the 106th installment of the Big
Game.
Please, for Belushi's sake.

from the start. For me, there
was no real reason to dwell on
the actual game itself in my col
umn.
This year, things are differ
ent.
Maybe I'm getting soft with
my "senior" status, but I think I

might have finally contracted — I mean, been
blessed with — some school spirit. Perhaps it had
something to do with watching the entire Cal stu
dent body rush their field after the Bears abused
us in ways that made Michael Jackson jealous.
For whatever reason, I can honestly say that I
do care about tomorrow's game.
In my three-plus years at Stanford, I have al
ways looked at the Stanford-Cal rivalry as sort of
an oddity. By all accounts, it's obvious that Cal
students absolutely hate us — and we, on the
other hand, don't give two s—ts about them.
It's sort of a Britney-Christina-type thing. You
can tell that Britney doesn't care whatsoever
about Ms. Aguilera, but Christina has lived in the
shadow of Britney ever since they were kids on
"The New Mickey Mouse Club." Britney's hotter
and unbelievably more successful, and Christina
has been forced to turn herself into a dirty whore
just to compete. And, despite her dirtiness, she
still can't come close.
That's the way it is with our two schools. We're
obviously better academically and we beat Cal
like a red-headed stepchild in almost every ath
letic endeavor. Hell, 90 percent of the kids are at
Berkeley only because they couldn't get in here.
I have no doubt that the Berkeley student
body will flood our school tomorrow from their
pregame tailgates on. They are going to be drunk,
loud and obsessed with the fact that they might fi
nally be better than Stanford at something.
So, in my keynote Big Game address, I have a
heart-felt message for all of you reading this col
umn. Get drunker, louder and, please, start some
ruckus.
I know that the NQ — "nerd quotient" — on
this campus is higher than a Robert Downey Jr.
party on New Year's Eve. I know that many of
you are more worried about finishing your Chem
problem set that's due during finals week than
getting wasted at Big Game. But put that aside for
a couple hours tomorrow.
Wake up early, fuel up with some liquid
courage and pretend, just for a day, that Stanford
is more than just some elite academic institution
— like the words on John Belushi's shirt so beau
tifully say, it's COLLEGE. I'm begging you.
As far as the game itself goes, even as 10-point
underdogs, Stanford shouldn't be counted out.
We've got some real playmakers on this team,
and I don't mean ESPN's crack-addict-gun-tot
ing-type playmakers — although, some of those
guys might really bring our intensity up a couple
notches.
J.R. Lemon and Kenneth Tolon definitely give
Stapford a formidable rushing attack, the defense
is scrappy and guys like Luke Powell just seem to
make things happen when they get their hands on
the ball.
Actually, I'm going to make a guarantee about
the game. If Powell gets more touches than the
Serial Groper on his mid-day ride through the
Quad, the Cardinal will cruise to an easy victory.
But, to be honest, I'm not filling up space in
The Daily to talk about x's-and-o's.
Instead, I am writing to implore you to come
out tomorrow and take advantage of one of the
few things that the University has been unable
to drain the fun out of: a real college football ri
valry. As a point of reference, more than
100,000 people will pack Michigan Stadium in
Ann Arbor to watch tomorrow's showdown be
tween Michigan and Ohio State, and, in the
state of Alabama, some jackass will no doubt
shoot his unique mixture of uncle / brother /
nephew over a heated argument about the
Auburn / Alabama game.
I'm not asking you to break out the firearms.
All I'm asking you do is re-introduce yourself to
an old friend named Jack (Daniels) or (Bloody)
Mary, come out to the stadium and support
Stanford in the 106th installment of the Big
Game.
Please, for Belushi's sake.

This marks the third consecutive year that
I have a written a Big Game column for
The Daily. Two years ago, I wrote about
how I didn't care at all about the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry. I went to Big Game that year, of
course — I used to go to all of the Stanford games.
(But, remember, we're talking about the T-Dub
era, which is to the Teevens era what "Seinfeld" is
to Norm MacDonald's new show "A Minute with
Stan Hooper.") Clearly I didn't care too much
about the outcome because I got so drunk at the
game that I blacked out by the third quarter and
somehow ended up at the Taco Bell on El Camino
Real by the time Cal tried to mount a fourth quar
ter comeback. But, from what I could piece to
gether, the Cardinal put on quite a show.
For last year's Big Game column, I wrote
about how I thought our esteemed squad of Yell
Leaders was an absolute embarrassment to Stan
ford, evading the issue of Big Game altogether —
and unleashing a huge response of letters in the
process (almost all in favor of my harangue, which
says a lot about the popularity of Yell Leaders).

Last year, our young football
team was dreadful and Cal, led
by current NFL QB Kyle
Boiler, had us overmatched
from the start. For me, there
was no real reason to dwell on
the actual game itself in my col
umn.
This year, things are differ
ent.
Maybe I'm getting soft with
my "senior" status, but I think I

might have finally contracted — I mean, been
blessed with — some school spirit. Perhaps it had
something to do with watching the entire Cal stu
dent body rush their field after the Bears abused
