difference," he said. "So you
have your bag of tricks that you
know work and you try to pass
those along to the younger guys.
"You essentially do what a
coach would do out there."
Well, not exactly.
Chambers is more a propo
nent of the positive reinforce
ment approach.
"I'm not so much out there
yelling at their face but I'm try
ing to motivate them and keep
their spirits up," he said.
Captain Kirk, as his team
mates so lovingly call him, is into
his mid-20s because he went on a
Mormon mission to Berlin, Ger
many in 1998 and 1999 before
matriculating at Stanford.
He told a comical story about
how his coaches reacted to his
wishes to go serve his church.
"When I first signed my letter
of intent in 1997, my coaches told
me they hoped I didn't go to
South America and lose 50
pounds," he said. "But when
they found out that I got called
to Germany [by the church lead
ership], they told me they hoped
I didn't gain 50 pounds."
While doing missionary work

in Eastern Germany, Chambers
found time to keep in shape by
doing push-ups and sit-ups and
the occasional jogging. He also
did something else his football
coaches were probably proud of.
He became a coach himself.
A semi-pro team near the Pol
ish border was looking for some
help, and after Chambers got to
know the head coach, he began
volunteering his time as the of
fensive and defensive line coach.
Now, it was just some small
time football league where the
players 18-and-older were com
peting for the love of the game.
But it gave Chambers the op
portunity to run through drills he
remembered from growing up,
and arguably helped him grow
even more into the leader that he
is today.
As hard as it is to imagine,
Chambers didn't always want to
be a football player.
At one time, he was a (mease
ly) 6-foot-6, 215-pound lanky
sophomore bent on becoming a
hoopster.
All it took was one encounter
with a mean defensive lineman
to persuade him that football
was his true calling.
Chambers' high school,
Provo, was squaring off against
rival Orem, which boasted a pre
season all-state defender named

Casey Jackson.
The Provo coaches decided to
pair Chambers up with Jackson
— a decision that seemed to
change his life direction.
"I ended up beating up on that
guy and really got the confidence
to say 'I can do this,' " Chambers
said.
(But Captain Kirk admitted
he didn't want to speak poorly of
Jackson — who later became a
Ultimate Fighting champion.)
While we are on the subject of
Provo, it's worth mentioning that
Chambers grew up a huge
Brigham Young fan and seemed
destined to become a Cougar
until he fell in love with Stan
ford.
But he still has a special place
in his heart for Provo, and when
Stanford traveled there earlier in
the season, it was a homecoming
of sorts.
At least 30 family members
showed up for Kirk's return.
And it couldn't have been any
more dramatic, as Stanford held
off a late BYU drive to win 18-
14.
"I couldn't even watch the
field," he admitted. "I had to
watch the screen because I was
so nervous they were going to
score a touchdown at the end."
The game was also special be
cause it might have been one of

the last times Kirk's ailing grand
father was able to see his grand
son play.
"It meant a lot," he said.
Remember, though, Kirk has
a family of his own now. He mar
ried Marilyn Ord two years ago
and the couple had their first
child, Marianae, in July.
Chambers readily admits that
his whole perspective on life has
changed.
But that doesn't mean he's
ready to give up his dreams of
going pro.
He talks to former Stanford
linemen Eric Heitmann and
Kwame Harris, both now of the
San Francisco 49ers, and tries to
pick their brains in order to
ready himself for the NFL draft
this summer.
"It's nice to have these guys
having blazed the trail for me al
ready," he said.
As his senior season begins to
wind down, Chambers confesses
he hasn't had enough time to re
flect on four years of football
and college.
"It's almost hard to believe
that it's going to end," he said.
College will end soon for
Chambers, but his storybook life
will only continue — especially
if (or, more likely, when) his wife
and daughter get to see him start
in the pros.
