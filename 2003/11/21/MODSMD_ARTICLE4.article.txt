# Bears put bowl bid on the line in season finale
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The last time California made a bowl game—back in
1996 — Steve Mariucci was head coach. Mariucci, of
course, went on to coach the San Francisco 49ers and is
presently coaching the Detroit Lions.
Some might joke that the lowly Lions (3-7 this year)
would have a tough time beating Pac-10 frontrunner No. 2
Southern California. As it stands now, though, Tedford's
Golden Bears are the only reason USC isn't a lock for a
berth in this year's national championship game at the
Sugar Bowl.
The Trojans strolled into Memorial Stadium on Sept. 27
expecting an easy game against a 2-3 Cal team, but they left
on the short end of a 34-31 score in overtime. That win de
fines Cal's surprising season, and serves as a nagging thorn
in the Trojans' side — particularly this week, which has
seen USC drop from No. 2 to No. 3 in the Bowl Champi
onship Series standings.
For Cal, which entered this season picked to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 — ahead of only Arizona — much of the
credit must go to second-year head coach Jeff Tedford, who
has led the team to a 6-6 record and, should the Golden
Bears win tomorrow, a berth in a Pacific 10 Conference
bowl game.
" [The players] know what is at stake," he said. "The win
ning season, the Axe, a berth to a bowl game."
And, just as USC might miss a chance at the national
championship because of its loss to Cal, the Golden Bears
wouldn't have a chance at the postseason had they not
knocked off the West coast's premiere team.
"You just can't figure this conference out," Tedford
said. "I just think that teams match up differently with one
another. For two years now, we played USC very close, and
this year we were fortunate enough to win. I cannot figure
out the logic behind this."
In the game, Tyler Frederickson kicked a 38-yard field
goal in a third overtime after Ryan Killeen missed a 39-
yarder, giving the Bears the win. Cal had built a 21-7 half
time lead behind sharp passing by Aaron Rodgers, but
USC battled back in the second half,
tying it on a field goal with 16 seconds
left.
But, showing the resiliency that has
been a trademark of Tedford's teams,
Cal fought hard in the overtime peri
ods, going ahead briefly on a touch
down in the second OT before closing
it out in the third. The Bears didn't
spring a cheap upset on the Trojans;
they played 60 minutes and three over
times, and still came out on top. USC
just didn't do what it needed to do, said
Bears receiver Jonathan Makonnen,
who scored Cal's touchdown in the sec
ond overtime.
"They always take us lightly,"
Makonnen said. "They really don't re
spect us. They're a talented team, but
they were kind of lackadaisical out
there."
Cal could hardly be considered
lackadaisical. The Bears have been in
volved in six games decided by a touch
down or less, and although they've won
just two of them, they've shown an abil
ity to hang around and keep things

competitive. Cal has never lost by more
than two touchdowns this season.
"They just play their tails off as long
as it takes," Tedford said after the USC
game. "It means a lot to this football
program to have that kind of victory in
our home stadium on national televi
sion. It's a tremendous feather in our
kids' cap."
While Tedford doesn't mind close
wins, he is not content with close losses.
"We've lost four out of six games in
overtime or the last couple minutes,"
he said."You can always say, 'What if?'
But if you make plays, you aren't in that
situation."
The same could be said of USC.
"We can't do anything about this
game, but we can get ready for the next
game and the next opportunity," USC
head coach Pete Carroll said after the
loss.
To its credit, USC has won every
game since the Cal loss by 20 or more
points to push itself back into the thick
of the Sugar Bowl race. But its postsea
son fate still rests on the performance of
other teams — such as BCS No. 2 Ohio
State and BCS No. 4 LSU.
Cal, though, controls its own destiny
tomorrow —just as the 4-5 Cardinal
controls its own fate as well.
Talk about a Big Game.
