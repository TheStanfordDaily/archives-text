# Bears put bowl bid on the line in season finale
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The last time California made a bowl game—back in
1996 — Steve Mariucci was head coach. Mariucci, of
course, went on to coach the San Francisco 49ers and is
presently coaching the Detroit Lions.
Some might joke that the lowly Lions (3-7 this year)
would have a tough time beating Pac-10 frontrunner No. 2
Southern California. As it stands now, though, Tedford's
Golden Bears are the only reason USC isn't a lock for a
berth in this year's national championship game at the
Sugar Bowl.
The Trojans strolled into Memorial Stadium on Sept. 27
expecting an easy game against a 2-3 Cal team, but they left
on the short end of a 34-31 score in overtime. That win de
fines Cal's surprising season, and serves as a nagging thorn
in the Trojans' side — particularly this week, which has
seen USC drop from No. 2 to No. 3 in the Bowl Champi
onship Series standings.
For Cal, which entered this season picked to finish ninth
in the Pac-10 — ahead of only Arizona — much of the
credit must go to second-year head coach Jeff Tedford, who
has led the team to a 6-6 record and, should the Golden
Bears win tomorrow, a berth in a Pacific 10 Conference
bowl game.
" [The players] know what is at stake," he said. "The win
ning season, the Axe, a berth to a bowl game."
And, just as USC might miss a chance at the national
championship because of its loss to Cal, the Golden Bears
wouldn't have a chance at the postseason had they not
knocked off the West coast's premiere team.
"You just can't figure this conference out," Tedford
said. "I just think that teams match up differently with one
another. For two years now, we played USC very close, and
this year we were fortunate enough to win. I cannot figure
out the logic behind this."
In the game, Tyler Frederickson kicked a 38-yard field
goal in a third overtime after Ryan Killeen missed a 39-
yarder, giving the Bears the win. Cal had built a 21-7 half
time lead behind sharp passing by Aaron Rodgers, but
