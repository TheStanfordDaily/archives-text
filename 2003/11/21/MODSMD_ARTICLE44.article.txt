# Gaieties: As if life at Stanford weren't a satire already
## 
### CHUCK ARMSTRONG 
Tuesday night, I was invited to a special advance showing of Gaieties. Those in attendance were all
dressed up in the height of fashion and were clearly among the finest and best bred of the Stanford theatre
going community. Obviously, everyone at the preview was invited for a reason.
The stakes were high at Memorial Auditorium that night, as some major changes have taken place to this
year's script, making it one of the most historically progressive Gaieties in recent years. For example, com
pletely removed from the script this year is the lovable character of Buddy, the talking bong.
Also, the writers have boldly decided to set the show three days AFTER Big Game. Overall, I'd say this
choice makes for an interesting series of plot digressions, though it is slightly confusing at times, with con
stant references to nations that don't currently exist, and such things as hovercraft travel and robot stew
ardesses.
The script was not the only progressive aspect of the show; the actors themselves also took quite a few
artistic risks. For example, early in the first act (upon completion of a musical number) the protagonist,
(played by Chris Ayer) actually breaks the "fourth wall" and directly interacts with the audience, resulting
in utter hilarity.
Overall, if I were to summarize this year's Gaieties in one word, it would have to be: very-well-put-to
gether-and-shorter-than-last-year's. So get out there and go see the newest incarnation of an age-old Stan
ford tradition.
