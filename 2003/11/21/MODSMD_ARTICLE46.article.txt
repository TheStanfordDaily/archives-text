SHATTERED GLASS
Dir. Billy Ray
A newsroom drama that is neither
a tour de' force nor a life-changing
event, but "darn good." As Stephen
Glass, a reporter who faked more
than half his stories, Hayden Chris
tiansen combines sad-puppy insecu
rity with the finesse of a con man, to
produce a character capable of cre
ating quite a scandal.
"Glass" presents its audience
with two mysteries (a hacker story
line, and the mystery of Glass him
self), and quite rightly offers no easy
answers. Instead, it offers a com
pelling portrait of the stresses, plea
sures and politics of the newsroom.
The film doesn't get bogged down in
psychoanalyzing Glass; instead it
leaves us to draw our own conclu
sions about his motivations. It's not a
perfect movie, but darn good is
good enough.

MASTER AND COMMANDER
Dir. Peter Weir
Directed by Peter Weir, the film
offers a glance into the world of 19th
century seaman-ship aboard the
HMS Surprise.
Drawn from two novels by Patrick
O'Brian, "Master and Commander"
perfectly captures adventure on the
high seas. The visual aspects of the
movie deserve the greatest credit, but
Russell Crowe's Captainjack Aubrey
also deserves regard, as he brings
one of literature's great warriors to
life.
