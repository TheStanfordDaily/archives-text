# Berry disturbing, 'Gothika' not so
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
When thunder rumbled through
one of the early scenes of
"Gothika," I thought it was a joke —
a tongue-in-cheek comment on the
conventions of the horror genre
which director Mathieu Kassovitz
would later twist. Knuckles white, I
waited through the dark and stormy

night for the surely immi
nent shock of originality. It
was a shock that never came.
"Gothika" manages to
work in nearly every stock
element of the gothic horror
tradition. It's got the thun-|
der, the lightning, the creepy

mental institution full of cavernous
grey rooms. In psychiatrist Miranda
Grey (Halle Berry), it's got the
plucky heroine whose strength is put
to the test. But it's missing one key
element — horror.
The film's hook is promising —
accused of a murder she didn't com
mit, Grey the psychiatrist appears to
go as crazy as her patients. One pa
tient in particular, Chloe (Penelope
Cruz), may hold the key to the true
killer — and to the supernatural vis
itations that plague Grey. What an
irony that, as Chloe's therapist, Grey
failed to take her seriously.
Now locked up in the mental hos
pital where she once worked, she
must solve the mystery and convince
her former coworkers she's sane.

These coworkers include the always
appealing Robert Downey Jr. as Dr.
Pete Graham, who once hoped his
relationship with Grey could be
more than professional.
Interesting as this sounds,
"Gothika" squanders most opportu
nities to distinguish itself. Instead of
an examination of the lines between
psychosis and sanity, we get the
same old quasi-Christian demon

narrative that hasn't been
scary since the seventies.
"Gothika" seems ideally
placed to overturn and com
ment on the cliches of its

genre. Instead, it plays all the
lold tricks — the ominous
music, the bathtub full of

blood, the ghost's-eye view of the
shivering heroine — and expects us
to be scared.
As a result, the film seems to have
been made by kids who watched too
many horror movies and paid too lit
tle attention. The kind of kids who
copy everything they see on screen
but leave out the spark that makes it
all work.
That spark is no mystery: To
scare us, a film has to surprise us.
And that's what "Gothika" just
doesn't do. It puts its shocks and
twists in all the appropriate places.
Watching it becomes like traveling a
dark and winding road — with a de
tailed map in front of you.
Berry is largely blameless here.
She's a good choice for the role —

her small muscular frame looks
uniquely susceptible to haunting,
and her face takes on a wolfish fe
rocity as she wrestles with fear and
anger. The wildness in her eyes as
she turns to face her enemy is one of
the scariest things in the film.
Her castmates fare less well. Cruz
has some good bits — here and
there a knowing smile suggests some
wisdom behind her wackiness — but
they're overshadowed by her over
wrought delivery of lines like "He
may take my body, but he will never
have my soul." Downey, meanwhile,
has woefully little to do; from the
way he drops out of the film's final
third, I can only suspect he stopped
showing up for shooting.

His treatment, however, is an
anomaly. "Gothika," for all its flaws,
ties up its loose ends admirably. By
the time the soundtrack launches
into its cheesy adult-contemporary
closer, "Gothika" has resolved itself
into a nice, clean package.
Maybe that's its problem. In set
ting out to pay homage to the gothic
genre, Kassovitz has followed the
rules too closely. He's created a text
book example of the horror film,
with all of its trappings and none of
its terror. Like the girl says, he may
take its body, but he will never have
its soul.



Turn around Halle: "Gothika" fails to provide enough scares.
