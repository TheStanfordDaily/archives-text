# Myers proves he's the cat's meow
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Take one part Dr. Seuss classic,
one part Hollywood adaptation,
three parts Mike Myers and mix
them all together and what you wind
up with is the non-stop, Technicolor,
drug-induced, visual frenzy that is
called "The Cat in the Hat."
Adapted from the ubiquitous
children's picture book of the same
name, "The Cat in the Hat" intro
duces us to Joan (Kelly Preston), the
squeaky-clean mom of Conrad and
Sally. Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is
the stereotypical trouble-maker,
while Sally (Dakota Fanning) is a

Palm Pilot-tot
ing future
lawyer. When
the children are
forced to
" spend the day
| at home with
I Mrs. Kwan, their

narcoleptic baby-sitter, they are in
troduced to a special visitor. Enter
the Cat.
The six-foot-tall red-and-white
striped-hatted feline is played by the
incomparable Mike Myers. Physical
ly unrecognizable and equipped with
a New Jersey accent, at first glance it
might seem that Myers would have

taken his role as the Cat as a chance
to step out of his "Austin Powers"
schtick and show off his ability to be
a character. Instead, what we get is
more shtick, in a cat suit.
All told, this is not entirely a bad
thing, as Myers permeates the film

with reliably witty quips, manic mu
sical interludes and genius comic
timing. Myers works in particularly
funny bits about television infomer
cials; later, he begs the question,
"Can you say 'dirty hoe' in a chil
dren's movie?" (Answer: Only if
you're referring to the gardening

tool.) With the focus on Myers, how
ever, the plot suffers.
While it is clearly a difficult task
to construct a film from a book that
is a mere 225 words long, the plot of
the movie does not measure up to its
potential. The two children's charac-

ters are artfully expanded into plau
sible protagonists, but they are given
no clear-cut objective. The Cat
storms in, has his fun and causes a
ruckus, but his motivations are never
really explained. There are a few
noteworthy supporting characters
— Joan's boss, the obsessive-com

pulsive Hank Humberfloob (Sean
Hayes); the Fish (voiced by Sean
Hayes) and Thing 1 and Thing 2. But
they are but distractions from the al
most oppressive presence of the Cat.
There is also a subplot involving
Joan and her boyfriend, Lawrence
(Alec Baldwin), a smarmy "busi
nessman" who despises Conrad and
wants to send him to military school.
This provides an opportunity for
plot development, but leaves too
many unknowns about Lawrence's
character.
Unresolved issues clutter the film
and leave more questions than an
swers: Where does the Cat come
from? What is Lawrence's real agen
da? Why is there a club scene involv
ing Paris Hilton?
When you read (or have read to
you) "The Cat in the Hat" for the
first time, what you experience is an
absurdly wonderful sensation that
can only come from reading non
sensical poetry. When you see the
big-screen adaptation, what you get
is a pungent acid trip full of "adult
humor" that can only come from the
mind of Mike Myers. Let's hope that
if the Cat in the Hat comes back, he
brings more of a story with him.
