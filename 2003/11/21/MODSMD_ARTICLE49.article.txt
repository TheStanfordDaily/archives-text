# The 						Best Ice-Cream

Rick's "Rather Rich" Ice Cream: 3946 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto
Rick's Ice Cream in Charleston Plaza, less than four miles from
Stanford, attracts customers with its ice cream, not with its atmos
phere. The store lacks seating and style, but the flavors of ice cream
are unique and all made at the store. Of the 32 flavors, kulfi is the most
exotic, featuring a rose-based ice cream with saffron, pistachios and
almonds. We sampled the caramel praline and the kulfi. Although the
caramel was rather thin and very sweet, both flavors are unique and
worth a try.

Gelato Classico: 241
Castro Street in
Mountain View and
435 Emerson Street
in Palo Alto
Gelato Classi
co, located across
Landmark's Aquar
ius Theatre in down
town Palo Alto, is a
favorite for dates.
Though the Palo
Alto store has just
enough room for
people to line up and
order (the line often

goes out the door), the Castro Street location in Mountain View is
slightly more spacious. Both stores boast 36 flavors, including the
popular Coppa Mista (vanilla, chocolate, pistachios and almonds), ba
nana walnut and burgundy cherry. The store advertises that their
frozen treat has more flavor and less fat than ice cream, and they even
offer a variety of low-fat sorbets for die-hard health nuts. The small
cup comes with up to two flavors; their green tea and chocolate hazel
nut was a great change from regular ice cream. My personal favorite,
however, is pistachio and hazelnut in a waffle cone, which almost al
ways guarantees a generous serving.
Double Rainbow: 135 Castro Street, Mountain View
Double Rainbow is an area chain serving what they claim is "San
Francisco's Official Ice Cream." The Mountain View store has an

Asian theme, featur
ing a colorful menu,
pearl milk tea, a juice
bar and ice cream fla
vors such as Chai
Scream, Vanilla Ly
chee and the ever
popular Green Tea.
Though we were the
only customers on a
rainy Saturday after
noon, the ice creami
was denser and
creamier than Rick's.

We stuck to the traditional strawberry, which was simple and deli
cious.
Swenson's Ice Cream: 440 University Avenue, Palo Alto
Swenson's is the place to go for dependable, albeit unspectacular
ice cream in a comfortable setting. The service is subpar, but the sec
ond-floor balcony at Swenson's more than makes up for the moderate
ice cream and service. The two small tables and plastic chairs over
looking University Drive are a great place to sit and relax while en
joying the predictable but solid ice cream.
Peninsula Creamery: 556 Emerson Street in Palo Alto, and in the
Stanford Shopping Center
Widely known for its overpriced diner food, the Peninsula Cream
ery does the milkshake well. But when's the last time a burger joint
messed up the milkshake? Mixed shakes, such as coconut-strawberry
or coconut-mango, are available in addition to the three favorites:
vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. The consistency of the shakes is a
touch too thin for my taste, and the "to go" portions aren't exactly
generous for the $4.95 price tag. However, the Creamery's fun envi
ronment keeps people coming back for more.
