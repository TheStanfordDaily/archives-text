# Dueling divas: Britney vs. Kylie

### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Kylie
Minogue's new
single, "Slow," is
quite enjoyable in
a slinky, ambient,
dim-the-lights
kind of way. It's
not liable to get
stuck in your head
at inappropriate
times like "Can't
Get You Out of
My Head," since it
lacks all those in
fernal "la la la"s.
Damned sticky,
those "la la la"s,
like a wad of melt
ed gum in your
hair.
That's not
to say that "Slow"
isn't catchy, it's
just more sedate,
more proper for

the 35-year-old Ms. Minogue. "Slow down and dance with me,
yeah, slow," she purrs in the chorus. And why shouldn't she want
to take it slow? Slow can be good. Sometimes when I get up too
fast my knees make a terrible cracking noise — maybe she has
creaky joints too.
If "Slow" were the only song on this CD, I would give it five
stars and wonder why the album was called "Body Language."

But this is not the
case. Like most al
bums, "Body Lan
guage" has more
than one song — 11
more to be exact —
none of which are
as hypnotizing as
"Slow."
Kylie strikes up
a respectable 1980s
danceteria vibe in
"Still Standing,"
punctuating a sam
ple of Prince's
"Kiss" with breathy
little gasps and
chirps that channel
Madonna from her
"Like a Virgin"
days. The result is
fun and bubbly and
perfect for a spin
around the roller
rink.
Her second
Prince cover, "I
Feel for You," isn't
quite as enthralling,

but it's pleasant enough. All the chorus' discordant beats clash
nicely with Kylie's smooth, husky voice. In "Secret (Take You
Home)," she gleefully samples Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam to great
groovy success, but her rapping debut inevitably cripples the
song. (Note to Everybody: Kylie Minogue is not a good rapper.)
Kylie's original material is pretty unimpressive in compari
son. With lyrics like: "Melt me slowly down / Like chocolate /
Tastes so good," "Chocolate" is the musical equivalent of a
cheesy Harlequin romance novel. Those pesky "la la la"s return
in "Red-Blooded Woman," but only half-heartedly.
Most of the tracks aren't slinky slow like "Slow," they're plain
old slow slow. Fans expecting a reprise of "Fever," with its fre
netic beats ideal for the gym and disco, will be disappointed — I
was. All this '80s nostalgia is fine once in a while, but in the end,
"Body Language" feels dated.

I have always loved her. From the moment I first heard "Baby, One
More Time" in my mom's silver Volvo on the way to school she years ago,
I knew she was The One.

three albums. After the 127th spin, I have to say, it is really good! Even
though it lacks a standout single like "Slave for You" or "Oops, I Did it
again," as a whole, "In the Zone" is easily the best of Britney's albums so
far.
It's certainly the most diverse. Notable guest stars include her newest
BFF, Madonna, who is featured on the hiccupy single, "Me against the
Music," and the Southern rappers, the Ying-Yang Twins (I guess Nelly
was busy). And Max Martin who? A host of super producers have taken
his place — Bloodshy & Avant, RedZone, The Matrix, R. Kelly and
Moby all contribute.
Musical xenophobes might not approve of this kind of intermixing, but
when it sounds so good, who cares? The result is not as confusing as it is
catchy. Britney may dabble with Indian ragas, reggae, soul, rap-lite and

Since then, a lot has
changed: She messed with
her hair, sang for Pepsi,
broke up with Justin and
kissed Madonna (Lucky!). I
don't read or watch her inter
views anymore because she
reminds me too much of this
cheerleader I went to high
school with named Cindy
who always said the stupidest
shit. But it's not Britney's
fault Cindy was so stupid.
Anyway, when "In the
Zone" was released this
week, I raced to get it, listen
ing to it over and over again,
like I did with her previous

electroclash, but she's
grounded by pop sensibil
ity throughout.
So let the girl experi
ment a little, it's what we
all do in our college years.
Britney's not going to pull
an Xtina on us and try to
switch genres; she's having
too much fun toying with
pop's limits — like
Mandy Moore's "In My
Pocket" or Justin Timber
lake's solo debut.
And guess what? Brit
ney might not have a vagi
na, but she does have am
biguous sexual encoun
ters! "Oh, it's so hot and I
need some air / But, boy,
don't stop 'cause I'm

halfway there," she moans in "Breathe on Me."
Wait — there's more. According to "Early Morning," she also drinks
alcohol on the street while simultaneously shaking her ass: "I was shaking
my ass in the streets / Just walked in and it's early morning / Got drunk till
the break of dawn." (Don't worry, Office of Student Activities, she's 21
— that makes everything OK, right?)
"Shadow" and "Everytime" are the only two clunkers on this album,
and they don't come close to the comic shittiness of "Dear Diary" or "E-
Mail My Heart," classic "tracks to skip" from her previous CDs. Not even
The Matrix can save "Shadow" from its wannabe power balladry, and
"Everytime" suffers from piano-backed slowness. Britney doesn't do so
well with songs that don't involve a big black box with a million little but
tons. She seems to realize this, and thankfully, "In the Zone" is almost bal
lad-free.
The new album is harder and shinier than any of its predecessors. It's
a synthed, dubbed, tweaked gem that, in a high-gloss laminate context,
could even be considered mature.
Sigh, so much has changed since those early days, when she was just a
pig-tailed, virginal teen straddling seesaws and sucking lollipops in
Rolling Stone Magazine, bringing joy to pedophiles everywhere. With "In
the Zone," my little Brit seems to be telling us she's all grown-up.

BRITNEY vs. KYLIE
Annoying kid sisters:

Britney
Jamie-Lynn Spears.
I don't care how young and sweet she is now, this girl is

gomg to be tucked-up.
Kylie
Dannii Minogue.
Who is she? What is she doing? Why
does she need a second ®i'? Somebody,
please make this go away.
Bizarre plastic surgery rumors:
Britney
Breast implants at 17.
Come on girl, you've got to give them a
chance before you cut them open.
Kylie
Butt cheek implants.
If this is proven true, the world will end.
Too many good things depend on the
authenticity of her ass.

Rap lyrics that make you go what... the hell is this
shit?
Britney
"She's gonna pack her bags / She's gonna find her way
/ She's gonna get right out of this / She don't want New
York / She don't want L.A. / She's gonna find that spe
cial kiss," from "Brave New Girl."
Kylie
"Buckle up baby, feel my speed / Better not brake or
you'll miss me / Driving you hard subliminal / 'Cause
you're so irresistible," from "Secret (Take You

Home)."
Really bad cover songs:
Britney
"Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones.
All the "girly action" in the world can't make
this less sacrilegious.
Kylie
"Locomotion" by Little Eva.
Even for 1987, this is cheesy.
Madonna connection:
Britney
The Kiss, "Me against the Music" duet, Kab
balah sisters, photos of The Kiss.
Kylie
Broke her record in the U.K. for No. 1 hits
with the release of "Slow," Kylie's 7th chart
topper.
Lyric most likely to cause insanity:
Britney
"You drive me crazy /1 just can't sleep."
An obvious but accurate choice.
Kylie
"la la la / la la la la la I la la la / la la la la"
An obvious but accurate choice.

Career low:
Britney
Getting dumped by Pepsi for Beyonce.
Kylie
Playing Petra in "Bio Dome."
15 years from now, most likely to be:
Ex-Playboy Playmate, M.I.L.F.
Kylie
The Dick Clark of pop music, spokesmodel for Botox.
Britney WINS! K.O.!

an Xtina on us and try to
switch genres; she's having
too much fun toying with
pop's limits — like
Mandy Moore's "In My
Pocket" or Justin Timber
lake's solo debut.
And guess what? Brit
ney might not have a vagi
na, but she does have am
biguous sexual encoun
ters! "Oh, it's so hot and I
need some air / But, boy,
don't stop 'cause I'm

halfway there," she moans in "Breathe on Me."
Wait — there's more. According to "Early Morning," she also drinks
alcohol on the street while simultaneously shaking her ass: "I was shaking
my ass in the streets / Just walked in and it's early morning / Got drunk till

"Shadow" and "Everytime" are the only two clunkers on this album,

The Matrix can save "Shadow" from its wannabe power balladry, and
"Everytime" suffers from piano-backed slowness. Britney doesn't do so
well with songs that don't involve a big black box with a million little but

lad-free.
The new album is harder and shinier than any of its predecessors. It's
a synthed, dubbed, tweaked gem that, in a high-gloss laminate context,
could even be considered mature.
Sigh, so much has changed since those early days, when she was just a
pig-tailed, virginal teen straddling seesaws and sucking lollipops in
Rolling Stone Magazine, bringing joy to pedophiles everywhere. With "In
the Zone," my little Brit seems to be telling us she's all grown-up.

BRITNEY vs. KYLIE
Annoying kid sisters:

Britney
Jamie-Lynn Spears.
I don't care how young and sweet she is now, this girl is

gomg to be tucked-up.
Kylie
Dannii Minogue.
Who is she? What is she doing? Why
does she need a second ®i'? Somebody,
please make this go away.
Bizarre plastic surgery rumors:
Britney
Breast implants at 17.
Come on girl, you've got to give them a
chance before you cut them open.
Kylie
Butt cheek implants.
If this is proven true, the world will end.
Too many good things depend on the
authenticity of her ass.

Rap lyrics that make you go what... the hell is this
shit?
Britney
"She's gonna pack her bags / She's gonna find her way
/ She's gonna get right out of this / She don't want New
York / She don't want L.A. / She's gonna find that spe
cial kiss," from "Brave New Girl."
Kylie
"Buckle up baby, feel my speed / Better not brake or
you'll miss me / Driving you hard subliminal / 'Cause
you're so irresistible," from "Secret (Take You

Home)."
Really bad cover songs:
Britney
"Satisfaction" by the Rolling Stones.
All the "girly action" in the world can't make
this less sacrilegious.
Kylie
"Locomotion" by Little Eva.
Even for 1987, this is cheesy.
Madonna connection:
Britney
The Kiss, "Me against the Music" duet, Kab
balah sisters, photos of The Kiss.
Kylie
Broke her record in the U.K. for No. 1 hits
with the release of "Slow," Kylie's 7th chart
topper.
Lyric most likely to cause insanity:
Britney
"You drive me crazy /1 just can't sleep."
An obvious but accurate choice.
Kylie
"la la la / la la la la la I la la la / la la la la"
An obvious but accurate choice.

Career low:
Britney
Getting dumped by Pepsi for Beyonce.
Kylie
Playing Petra in "Bio Dome."
15 years from now, most likely to be:
Ex-Playboy Playmate, M.I.L.F.
Kylie
The Dick Clark of pop music, spokesmodel for Botox.
Britney WINS! K.O.!




Kylie
Minogue's new
single, "Slow," is
quite enjoyable in
a slinky, ambient,
dim-the-lights
kind of way. It's
not liable to get
stuck in your head
at inappropriate
times like "Can't
Get You Out of
My Head," since it
lacks all those in
fernal "la la la"s.
Damned sticky,
those "la la la"s,
like a wad of melt
ed gum in your
hair.
That's not
to say that "Slow"
isn't catchy, it's
just more sedate,
more proper for

the 35-year-old Ms. Minogue. "Slow down and dance with me,
yeah, slow," she purrs in the chorus. And why shouldn't she want
to take it slow? Slow can be good. Sometimes when I get up too
fast my knees make a terrible cracking noise — maybe she has
creaky joints too.
If "Slow" were the only song on this CD, I would give it five
stars and wonder why the album was called "Body Language."

But this is not the
case. Like most al
bums, "Body Lan
guage" has more
than one song — 11
more to be exact —
none of which are
as hypnotizing as
"Slow."
Kylie strikes up
a respectable 1980s
danceteria vibe in
"Still Standing,"
punctuating a sam
ple of Prince's
"Kiss" with breathy
little gasps and
chirps that channel
Madonna from her
"Like a Virgin"
days. The result is
fun and bubbly and
perfect for a spin
around the roller
rink.
Her second
Prince cover, "I
Feel for You," isn't
quite as enthralling,

but it's pleasant enough. All the chorus' discordant beats clash
nicely with Kylie's smooth, husky voice. In "Secret (Take You
Home)," she gleefully samples Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam to great
groovy success, but her rapping debut inevitably cripples the
song. (Note to Everybody: Kylie Minogue is not a good rapper.)
Kylie's original material is pretty unimpressive in compari
son. With lyrics like: "Melt me slowly down / Like chocolate /
Tastes so good," "Chocolate" is the musical equivalent of a
cheesy Harlequin romance novel. Those pesky "la la la"s return
in "Red-Blooded Woman," but only half-heartedly.
Most of the tracks aren't slinky slow like "Slow," they're plain
old slow slow. Fans expecting a reprise of "Fever," with its fre
netic beats ideal for the gym and disco, will be disappointed — I
was. All this '80s nostalgia is fine once in a while, but in the end,
"Body Language" feels dated.

I have always loved her. From the moment I first heard "Baby, One
More Time" in my mom's silver Volvo on the way to school she years ago,
I knew she was The One.

three albums. After the 127th spin, I have to say, it is really good! Even
though it lacks a standout single like "Slave for You" or "Oops, I Did it
again," as a whole, "In the Zone" is easily the best of Britney's albums so
far.
It's certainly the most diverse. Notable guest stars include her newest
BFF, Madonna, who is featured on the hiccupy single, "Me against the
Music," and the Southern rappers, the Ying-Yang Twins (I guess Nelly
was busy). And Max Martin who? A host of super producers have taken
his place — Bloodshy & Avant, RedZone, The Matrix, R. Kelly and
Moby all contribute.
Musical xenophobes might not approve of this kind of intermixing, but
when it sounds so good, who cares? The result is not as confusing as it is
catchy. Britney may dabble with Indian ragas, reggae, soul, rap-lite and

Since then, a lot has
changed: She messed with
her hair, sang for Pepsi,
broke up with Justin and
kissed Madonna (Lucky!). I
don't read or watch her inter
views anymore because she
reminds me too much of this
cheerleader I went to high
school with named Cindy
who always said the stupidest
shit. But it's not Britney's
fault Cindy was so stupid.
Anyway, when "In the
Zone" was released this
week, I raced to get it, listen
