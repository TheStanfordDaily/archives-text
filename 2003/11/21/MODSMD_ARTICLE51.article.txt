# Pretty boy is pretty coy: Walker talks the talk
## 
### BEATRICE KIM 
It's shocking to hear that Paul
Walker just turned 30. With roles in
"Pleasantville," "She's All That" and
"Fast and the Furious" (and its sequel
"2 Fast 2 Furious"), Walker has estab
lished himself as a heartthrob in the
world of teen movies. Well surprise,
this teen isn't a teen. He's the father of
a 4 year-old girl. For his latest movie,
Walker is trying something new: time
travel.
An adaptation of a Michael Crich
ton novel, "Timeline" is about a group
of archeological students who get
trapped in 14th century France while
trying to save their professor. Walker
plays Chris Johnston, a recent college
graduate who travels around the world
with his professor-father (Billy Con
nolly) and who later leads the group of
students in their rescue of his father. In
termission talked to Paul Walker about
the movie, girls and who's cool in Hol
lywood.
INTERMISSION: How was it work
ing with director Richard Donner?
WALKER: I liked it. We had a really
good time, he was really confident. He
really knows what he wants and its real
unnerving when you're working with a
director who doesn't know what he
wants.
INT: Where was the movie filmed?
WALKER: We filmed in Montreal.
INT: How was it?
WALKER: It was great. I didn't know
what people were saying cause they
were speaking French [laughs].
INT: How true to the book is the
movie?
WALKER: It deviates a bit. When you
condense a 520-page book to 120 pages
for a script, you have to lose a lot. That's
the scary part, I think, making the exec
utive decision on what can stay and
what has to go. I think they did a good
job. I feel good about it, I feel good
about it.
IN: Did you read the book before?
WALKER: No, I was told not to. I read
it after though.
INT: Was making the movie physically
demanding?
WALKER: It wasn't as hard as the
"Fast and the Furious" movies.
INT: How do you keep active?
WALKER: I race cars. I surf a lot.
INT: I read somewhere that instead of
wearing the tights you'd rather wear
the armor.
WALKER: Uh huh.
INT: If you could go anywhere through
time travel, where would you go?
WALKER: Definitely the Medieval
Times. Oh yeah. I'd love to be
Lancelot. I would want to see if the
whole King Arthur and the Round
Table really happened

INT: What kind of preparation went
into the role for this film?
WALKER: My character isn't an
archeologist but since he's around it all
of his life, he just picks stuff up. So I
hung out with Gerry [Gerard Butler]
and Francis [O'Connor], the archeolo
gist specialists, and it was just basically
Q&A.
INT: Who do you relate to more, Chris'
character from "Timeline" or Brian's
character from "The Fast and the Furi
ous" movies?
WALKER: Chris' character is not as
cool. lie's a lot more like me. Brian
from the "Fast and the Furious" has

more of an edge; he's a lot colder and
not as approachable. Chris' character is
more vulnerable; he's just out of col
lege. He hasn't figured himself out yet.
INT: You eventually hope to produce
your film someday?
WALKER: One I want to do right now
is a Western.
INT: You've been quoted saying "Hol
lywood is garbage." What did you
mean by that and do you still believe it?
WALKER: Yeah, I said that a long
time ago. People tend to lose perspec
tive and that's what I was referring to. I
don't really fit in this town, sometimes I
wake up and I just don't know what I'm
doing. There are a lot of nice people in
this town; it just has a bad reputation.
You wanna know the cool people in
this town, I'll tell you. John Voigt, he's
really cool. Jeff Daniels, Matt Craven,
Billy Connolly...
INT: You tend to be more down to
earth than most celebrities, what
makes you not get arrogant?
WALKER: My dad would kick my ass.
I grew up as a Mormon and I went to a
Christian high school. Nah, but I was
still a knucklehead.
{Billy Connolly enters the room and we
stop for a while as Walker says hello.)
INT: How was it working with Billy
Connolly?
WALKER: He's cool. You know how
you have your co-workers. Some you
get along with and some are so-so. But
there are some you meet that are really

awesome. When Billy's on set, every
thing is just so much cooler. He's that
kind of person. He's real positive; he's
always the glass-half-full guy. Hanging
out with people like him really rubs off
on you and its just great.
INT: Your career is definitely on the
upswing right now. You're seen as a
heartthrob character, are you afraid
that will limit the roles you get?
WALKER: Nah, as long as I have a
job. And if some girls find me cute,
right on, it'll help me find a date later
on.
INT: You tend to get roles in which you
player younger characters. How do you
feel about that?
WALKER: I'm very young for my age.
I just turned 30 but I still feel like a kid.
INT: Is there any actor or actress that
you want to work with?
WALKER: I would love to work with
Morgan Freeman. And Jeff Daniels
and John Voigt.
INT: Do you watch a lot of television?
WALKER: No, and when I do I only
watch Discovery Channel and Animal
Planet.
INT: You grace a lot of covers of
magazines and do a lot of inter
views. Do you read your own stuff?
WALKER: I can't bring myself to
look at it. I beg my family and
friends not to look at it. I don't want
to hear it, I don't want to go home
and see me on the coffee table. So
when my mom buys one now, she
hides it. I think I'm in denial.
INT: What was your favorite role?
WALKER: I liked what I did in
"Pleasantville." But that's all be
cause of Gary Ross [director], I also
have real fun memories of "Varsity
Blues."
INT: What project are you working
on next?
WALKER: "Noel." Chazz
Palminteri, he wrote "A Bronx
Tale" is directing this movie. Robin
Williams, Susan Sarandon and
Penelope Cruz are also in it. I'm so
nervous you have no idea.
INT: What is one thing you want to
be remembered for?
WALKER: To be in cool movies. I
want people to think, "He made
some cool movies." It feels good
when you're walking down the
street and some kid comes up to you
and says "Paul! Whaddup! You're
in my favorite movie." I don't think
I'll ever get tired of that.

it after though.
INT: Was making the movie physically
demanding?
WALKER: It wasn't as hard as the
"Fast and the Furious" movies.
INT: How do you keep active?
WALKER: I race cars. I surf a lot.
INT: I read somewhere that instead of
wearing the tights you'd rather wear
the armor.
WALKER: Uh huh.
INT: If you could go anywhere through
time travel, where would you go?
WALKER: Definitely the Medieval
Times. Oh yeah. I'd love to be
Lancelot. I would want to see if the
whole King Arthur and the Round
Table really happened

INT: What kind of preparation went
into the role for this film?
WALKER: My character isn't an
archeologist but since he's around it all
of his life, he just picks stuff up. So I
hung out with Gerry [Gerard Butler]
and Francis [O'Connor], the archeolo
gist specialists, and it was just basically
Q&A.
INT: Who do you relate to more, Chris'
character from "Timeline" or Brian's
character from "The Fast and the Furi
ous" movies?
WALKER: Chris' character is not as
cool. lie's a lot more like me. Brian
from the "Fast and the Furious" has

more of an edge; he's a lot colder and
not as approachable. Chris' character is
more vulnerable; he's just out of col
lege. He hasn't figured himself out yet.
INT: You eventually hope to produce
your film someday?
WALKER: One I want to do right now
is a Western.
INT: You've been quoted saying "Hol
lywood is garbage." What did you
mean by that and do you still believe it?
WALKER: Yeah, I said that a long
time ago. People tend to lose perspec
tive and that's what I was referring to. I
don't really fit in this town, sometimes I
wake up and I just don't know what I'm
doing. There are a lot of nice people in
this town; it just has a bad reputation.
You wanna know the cool people in
this town, I'll tell you. John Voigt, he's
really cool. Jeff Daniels, Matt Craven,
Billy Connolly...
INT: You tend to be more down to
earth than most celebrities, what
makes you not get arrogant?
WALKER: My dad would kick my ass.
I grew up as a Mormon and I went to a
Christian high school. Nah, but I was
still a knucklehead.
{Billy Connolly enters the room and we
stop for a while as Walker says hello.)
INT: How was it working with Billy
Connolly?
WALKER: He's cool. You know how
you have your co-workers. Some you
get along with and some are so-so. But
there are some you meet that are really

awesome. When Billy's on set, every
thing is just so much cooler. He's that
kind of person. He's real positive; he's
always the glass-half-full guy. Hanging
out with people like him really rubs off
on you and its just great.
INT: Your career is definitely on the
upswing right now. You're seen as a
heartthrob character, are you afraid
that will limit the roles you get?
WALKER: Nah, as long as I have a
job. And if some girls find me cute,
right on, it'll help me find a date later
on.
INT: You tend to get roles in which you
player younger characters. How do you
feel about that?
WALKER: I'm very young for my age.
I just turned 30 but I still feel like a kid.
INT: Is there any actor or actress that
you want to work with?
WALKER: I would love to work with
Morgan Freeman. And Jeff Daniels
and John Voigt.
INT: Do you watch a lot of television?
WALKER: No, and when I do I only
watch Discovery Channel and Animal
Planet.
INT: You grace a lot of covers of
magazines and do a lot of inter
views. Do you read your own stuff?
WALKER: I can't bring myself to
look at it. I beg my family and
friends not to look at it. I don't want
to hear it, I don't want to go home
and see me on the coffee table. So
when my mom buys one now, she
hides it. I think I'm in denial.
INT: What was your favorite role?
WALKER: I liked what I did in
"Pleasantville." But that's all be
cause of Gary Ross [director], I also
have real fun memories of "Varsity
Blues."
INT: What project are you working
on next?
WALKER: "Noel." Chazz
Palminteri, he wrote "A Bronx
Tale" is directing this movie. Robin
Williams, Susan Sarandon and
Penelope Cruz are also in it. I'm so
nervous you have no idea.
INT: What is one thing you want to
be remembered for?
WALKER: To be in cool movies. I
want people to think, "He made
some cool movies." It feels good
when you're walking down the
street and some kid comes up to you
and says "Paul! Whaddup! You're
in my favorite movie." I don't think
I'll ever get tired of that.

"Timeline" opens in theaters on
Nov. 26.


I'm not a boy, not yet a man
It's shocking to hear that Paul
Walker just turned 30. With roles in
"Pleasantville," "She's All That" and
"Fast and the Furious" (and its sequel
"2 Fast 2 Furious"), Walker has estab
lished himself as a heartthrob in the
world of teen movies. Well surprise,
this teen isn't a teen. He's the father of
a 4 year-old girl. For his latest movie,
Walker is trying something new: time
travel.
An adaptation of a Michael Crich
ton novel, "Timeline" is about a group
of archeological students who get
trapped in 14th century France while
trying to save their professor. Walker
plays Chris Johnston, a recent college
graduate who travels around the world
with his professor-father (Billy Con
nolly) and who later leads the group of
students in their rescue of his father. In
termission talked to Paul Walker about
the movie, girls and who's cool in Hol
lywood.
INTERMISSION: How was it work
ing with director Richard Donner?
WALKER: I liked it. We had a really
good time, he was really confident. He
really knows what he wants and its real
unnerving when you're working with a
director who doesn't know what he
wants.
INT: Where was the movie filmed?
WALKER: We filmed in Montreal.
INT: How was it?
WALKER: It was great. I didn't know
what people were saying cause they
were speaking French [laughs].
INT: How true to the book is the
movie?
WALKER: It deviates a bit. When you
condense a 520-page book to 120 pages
for a script, you have to lose a lot. That's
the scary part, I think, making the exec
utive decision on what can stay and
what has to go. I think they did a good
job. I feel good about it, I feel good
about it.
IN: Did you read the book before?
WALKER: No, I was told not to. I read
it after though.
