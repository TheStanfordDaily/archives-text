# A 						'Timeline' never to be crossed

### ERIC BAHN 
"Timeline," the latest movie based
on a Michael Crichton novel, ex
plores the question of what happens
when you take a few people from the
21st century and send them into the
14th century. Apparently, the answer

has all the makings of bad
cinema.
Directed by Richard
Donner (the "Lethal
Weapon" series) and star
ring Hollywood's it-boy
Paul Walker, "Timeline"

follows a team of archeology stu-|
dents and their professor as they

conduct a dig to study feudal society
in Castelgard, France.
The dig produces remarkable re
sults for the team, but Professor Ed
ward Johnston (Billy Connolly) be
comes suspicious of his mysterious re
search benefactor, International Tech
nology Corporation (ITC). After the
professor goes missing on a trip to the
corporation's headquarters, the team
discovers that ITC has built a teleporta
tion machine with a glitch. This sends
Johnston through a wormhole leading
to Castelgard, France in 1347. Hence, it
becomes the duty of this group of stu
dents to go back in time and rescue their
beloved professor before he is trapped
in feudal France forever.
"Timeline" is poorly adapted to
the big screen. Michael Crichton does
not act as a collaborator for this film,
and the film hurts without his consult
ing. It is clear from the movie's con
voluted opening that the writers

struggled to introduce the science that
drove Crichton's novel â€” the result
of their efforts is a non-linear mon
tage to explain the machine and its
fatal glitch. Indeed, the first 15 min
utes had me pondering a single ques
tion: What?
Paul Walker is in fine looking form
for his leading role as the son of the

missing professor, but suffers
from "Keanu Reeves syn
drome": He sounds like an idiot
the moment he opens his
mouth. Much like tne afore
mentioned star of "Bill and
Ted's Excellent Adventure,"
Walker demonstrates his in-

| ability to ... um... act. He is unable
to shake off his surfer image for the

part and it serves to hinder the credi
bility of the already weak story.
Nevertheless, "Timeline" holds
some entertaining moments. Donner
seems to be in his element when di
recting the exciting battle scenes be
tween the French and English. It is es
pecially satisfying to watch the French
use their trebuchets (i.e. catapults) to
deliver fiery vectors against the
snooty English forces. As an aficiona
do of cinematic bloodlust, I was well
sated; unfortunately, there are not
enough battles in this movie to make
up for the otherwise slow and tedious
storyline.
"Timeline" runs under two hours,
however, when the movie ended, my
immediate thought was that having a
time machine like the one in the
movie would be cool. Then I could
send myself back a few hours to re
trieve the precious moments I lost at
the theater.


Kiss my axe: "Timeline" blows even more than the Weenies
