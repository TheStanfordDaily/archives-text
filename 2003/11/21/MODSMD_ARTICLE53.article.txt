# The 						stars of '21 Grams' weigh in...
## Intermission interviews Sean Penn, Benecio Del Toro and Naomi Watts 
### BEATRICE KIM 
I catch a glimpse of Sean Penn stepping out of the elevator and
the busy New York hotel lobby seems to quiet right at that mo
ment. His eyes are piercing blue and his hair is wild and he stands
out in the crowd of press people surrounding him. He has what
Hollywood likes to call presence. I rest my back on the wall, but
only because my knees have become jelly and I don't think I can
stand without some help. And just like that he's gone.
But we're going to meet again soon: I'm spending the weekend
in New York City for an interview with the cast of "21 Grams,"
the second film by the young Mexican director, Alejandro Gon
zalez Inarritu. Inarritu's first film, "Amores Perros" was widely
acclaimed and won numerous awards, including nominations for
Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards.
Collaborating once again with "Amores" writer Guillermo Ar
riaga on "21 Grams," he spins a tale of three strangers whose lives
cross after a car accident.
In the conference room, the monitor for the interview an
nounces that they're running a little late. So Hollywood. Twenty
minutes pass and the room continues to whisper when a small
woman in all black and a high pony tail rushes past me. I am im
mediately captivated by Naomi Watts, who is more beautiful in
real life and a lot smaller than she appears on camera. Following
her is Benicio, who walks in with a lit cigarette in one hand. Strut
ting, chest puffed out and inhaling the smoke from his cigarette,
he looks like a poster boy for some cigarette company. Sean Penn
follows close behind in this parade of stars and although his walk
emulates Del Toro's swagger, his eyes say he's nervous. Melissa
Leo, who plays Benicio's wife, and Guillermo Arriaga (screen
writer) follow.
"21 Grams" is filmed entirely in sections, jumping back and
forth in time. Although Inarritu has only directed two movies, the
non-linear narrative is becoming his signature style. But perhaps
this is because his writer, Arriaga, tells stories like this and Inar
ritu simply complies.
"We never go linear. I want the audience to have a dialogue
with the characters. Not only an intellectual game but also emo
tional: judging and misjudging, filling in the gaps. Jumping back
and forth lets the viewer be a part of this game but more than that,

I want this movie to be an emotional experience."
At this point, Arriaga has problems coming up with the
correct English word for "significance." He asks Inar
ritu who sits across the room. Sean Penn interjects, "did
anyone else notice that he [Arriaga] was asking him
[Inarritu] for translation?" He jabs a finger towards
Inarritu and the room erupts in laughter at the realiza
tion that the two men with the thickest accents are ask
ing each other for help in English. From then on, Penn
decides to "translate" questions for the Spanish-speak
ing director and writer.
"This question is for Mr. Inarritu. How did you cap
ture the reality of life so well in your film?" Penn turns
toward Inarritu and says, louder and slower, "How...
did ... you... capture," and again the room erupts in
laughter. What I had detected in his eyes as apprehen
sion earlier, I now realize, was a gleam of mischief. Inar
ritu laughs and slaps Penn on the shoulder. "As direc
tor, you have to have sense of a he detector, to know
when you're cheating yourself. As long as I am honest
with me and help others to be honest with themselves

.. it does not have to be real in the sense of life. I submit to the re
ality of that film, I contain that reality."
Watts sips her bottled water and laughs politely. As Christina
Peck, a wife and mother who loses her family to a hit-and-run ac
cident, she rips through a range of emotions. Many of her scenes
are raw and intense and suck the audience right into the moment.
Playing a mother who loses her children, she derived most of her
inspiration from family group therapy sessions that Inarritu and
she visited and observed. "I tried to connect to people who have
gone through familiar experiences. All of the stories were the
same in that they all have the same feeling of loss and grief. It was
just trying to sympathize and relate that to the screen that was the
most difficult part."
Christina becomes friends with Paul (Penn) and later, they be
come lovers. Penn gives a brilliant performance as a math profes
sor dying from heart disease. When he receives Christina's hus
band's heart, he becomes obsessed with finding the donor's iden
tity and later leaves his wife for Christina. This story line espe
cially intrigued Penn — who's said in the past that he wants to
give up acting — because it offered him something he could re
late to. "I tend to write the things I do but as you sit around you
realize you need a job. I didn't want to act because you find your
self subject to other people's interests and wants. But this one ['21
Grams'] went into the heart of what I was interested in: revenge,

love, redemption." As for the script itself, "the script was so good
you didn't have to change anything. They [Inarritu and Arriaga]
write better than they talk." Another bout of laughter.
"21 Grams" addresses many themes including love, guilt and re
ligion. The movie hints at the spiritual, questioning whether the 21
grams lost at the moment of death is the weight of a person's soul.
In the movie, Del Toro plays Jack, an ex-convict who denounces his
old ways and clings to religion. He drives a bright yellow truck with
"Believe in the Lord" painted in bold, thug-like letters on the side
and a miniature figurine of Christ on the dashboard. Strong reli
gious undertones can be found throughout the movie. When Jack
commits a hit-and-run accident, his world falls a part and he begins
to question his efforts of reformation. "Religion is more of his
wheelchair. [This movie] isn't condescending [towards] religion,
like [it doesn't say] it was bad for him. I think religion helps all of the
characters get by." In the depths of his distress, Jack's wife (Leo)
tells him "life has to go on, with or without God." The irony of this
interplay of the spirit and body is that Arriaga, the screenwriter, is
an atheist. Inarritu, a devout Catholic, jokes in broken English, "he
[Arriaga] is the devil." According to Arriaga, writing this movie
was a chance for him to express why we as humans are here on
earth. "This life is our only chance, since I am an atheist, so I want
us to appreciate and value this moment. My goal was for people to
call [their] family as soon as the film was done."

you didn't have to change anything. They [Inarritu and Arriaga]
write better than they talk." Another bout of laughter.
"21 Grams" addresses many themes including love, guilt and re
ligion. The movie hints at the spiritual, questioning whether the 21
grams lost at the moment of death is the weight of a person's soul.
In the movie, Del Toro plays Jack, an ex-convict who denounces his
old ways and clings to religion. He drives a bright yellow truck with
"Believe in the Lord" painted in bold, thug-like letters on the side
and a miniature figurine of Christ on the dashboard. Strong reli
gious undertones can be found throughout the movie. When Jack
commits a hit-and-run accident, his world falls a part and he begins
to question his efforts of reformation. "Religion is more of his
wheelchair. [This movie] isn't condescending [towards] religion,
like [it doesn't say] it was bad for him. I think religion helps all of the
characters get by." In the depths of his distress, Jack's wife (Leo)
tells him "life has to go on, with or without God." The irony of this
interplay of the spirit and body is that Arriaga, the screenwriter, is
an atheist. Inarritu, a devout Catholic, jokes in broken English, "he
[Arriaga] is the devil." According to Arriaga, writing this movie
was a chance for him to express why we as humans are here on
earth. "This life is our only chance, since I am an atheist, so I want
us to appreciate and value this moment. My goal was for people to
call [their] family as soon as the film was done."


Are you trying to peek at my sideburns again?
I catch a glimpse of Sean Penn stepping out of the elevator and
the busy New York hotel lobby seems to quiet right at that mo
ment. His eyes are piercing blue and his hair is wild and he stands
out in the crowd of press people surrounding him. He has what
Hollywood likes to call presence. I rest my back on the wall, but
only because my knees have become jelly and I don't think I can
stand without some help. And just like that he's gone.
But we're going to meet again soon: I'm spending the weekend
in New York City for an interview with the cast of "21 Grams,"
the second film by the young Mexican director, Alejandro Gon
zalez Inarritu. Inarritu's first film, "Amores Perros" was widely
acclaimed and won numerous awards, including nominations for
Best Foreign Film at the Golden Globes and Academy Awards.
Collaborating once again with "Amores" writer Guillermo Ar
riaga on "21 Grams," he spins a tale of three strangers whose lives
cross after a car accident.
In the conference room, the monitor for the interview an
nounces that they're running a little late. So Hollywood. Twenty
minutes pass and the room continues to whisper when a small
woman in all black and a high pony tail rushes past me. I am im
mediately captivated by Naomi Watts, who is more beautiful in
real life and a lot smaller than she appears on camera. Following
her is Benicio, who walks in with a lit cigarette in one hand. Strut
ting, chest puffed out and inhaling the smoke from his cigarette,
he looks like a poster boy for some cigarette company. Sean Penn
follows close behind in this parade of stars and although his walk
emulates Del Toro's swagger, his eyes say he's nervous. Melissa
Leo, who plays Benicio's wife, and Guillermo Arriaga (screen
writer) follow.
"21 Grams" is filmed entirely in sections, jumping back and
forth in time. Although Inarritu has only directed two movies, the
non-linear narrative is becoming his signature style. But perhaps
this is because his writer, Arriaga, tells stories like this and Inar
ritu simply complies.
"We never go linear. I want the audience to have a dialogue
with the characters. Not only an intellectual game but also emo
tional: judging and misjudging, filling in the gaps. Jumping back
and forth lets the viewer be a part of this game but more than that,

I want this movie to be an emotional experience."
At this point, Arriaga has problems coming up with the
correct English word for "significance." He asks Inar
ritu who sits across the room. Sean Penn interjects, "did
anyone else notice that he [Arriaga] was asking him
[Inarritu] for translation?" He jabs a finger towards
Inarritu and the room erupts in laughter at the realiza
tion that the two men with the thickest accents are ask
ing each other for help in English. From then on, Penn
decides to "translate" questions for the Spanish-speak
ing director and writer.
"This question is for Mr. Inarritu. How did you cap
ture the reality of life so well in your film?" Penn turns
toward Inarritu and says, louder and slower, "How...
did ... you... capture," and again the room erupts in
laughter. What I had detected in his eyes as apprehen
sion earlier, I now realize, was a gleam of mischief. Inar
ritu laughs and slaps Penn on the shoulder. "As direc
tor, you have to have sense of a he detector, to know
when you're cheating yourself. As long as I am honest
with me and help others to be honest with themselves

.. it does not have to be real in the sense of life. I submit to the re
ality of that film, I contain that reality."
Watts sips her bottled water and laughs politely. As Christina
Peck, a wife and mother who loses her family to a hit-and-run ac
cident, she rips through a range of emotions. Many of her scenes
are raw and intense and suck the audience right into the moment.
Playing a mother who loses her children, she derived most of her
inspiration from family group therapy sessions that Inarritu and
she visited and observed. "I tried to connect to people who have
gone through familiar experiences. All of the stories were the
same in that they all have the same feeling of loss and grief. It was
just trying to sympathize and relate that to the screen that was the
most difficult part."
Christina becomes friends with Paul (Penn) and later, they be
come lovers. Penn gives a brilliant performance as a math profes
sor dying from heart disease. When he receives Christina's hus
band's heart, he becomes obsessed with finding the donor's iden
tity and later leaves his wife for Christina. This story line espe
cially intrigued Penn — who's said in the past that he wants to
give up acting — because it offered him something he could re
late to. "I tend to write the things I do but as you sit around you
realize you need a job. I didn't want to act because you find your
self subject to other people's interests and wants. But this one ['21
Grams'] went into the heart of what I was interested in: revenge,

love, redemption." As for the script itself, "the script was so good
you didn't have to change anything. They [Inarritu and Arriaga]
