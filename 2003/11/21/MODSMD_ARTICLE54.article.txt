# ... But '21 Grams' can't throw its weight around

"They say we all lose
21 grams at the exact mo
ment of our death ...
everyone. The weight of
a stack of nickels. The
weight of a chocolate
bar. The weight of a
hummingbird ..." The
tag line for the new
movie by Director Ale
jandro Gonzalez Inar
ritu, "21 Grams," is
cheesy and over the top
and does little for the
movie itself. Which is

good, since it sets up no expectations.
And with no expectations, you might be taken by the intricate plot; you would definitely be
captivated by the powerful performances given by Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio Del
Toro; and you might even be intrigued by the non-linear, gritty hand-held camera shots that,
after only two movies, have become Inarritu's signature style. However, if you've seen Inarritu's
first and only other movie, "Amores Perros," you will certainly be in for a disappointment.
" Amores" (2000) — which received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at both the
Golden Globes and Academy Awards — was well deserving of all its praise. "21 Grams," simply
put, is not.
The story centers around three characters: Paul (Sean Penn), a college professor dying from
heart disease. A heart transplant from a hit-and-run victim saves his life. Christina (Naomi
Watts) is a loving wife and mother. Her life falls apart the day her husband and two daughters
are killed in a hit-and-run accident. Jack (Benicio Del Toro) is an ex-convict who has lived all his
life in and out of jail but he has since committed his life to God and his family. His life changes
forever when he's involved in a hit-and-run.

Like in his earlier films, Inarritu weaves the three overlapping stories in the non-linear fash
ion pioneered by Quentin Tarentino ("Pulp Fiction") and seen more recently in "Memento."
Inarritu builds the film in an almost erratic manner, constantly flipping forward and backwards
in time. At the end of every scene, it takes a good minute to situate one's self in the story again
— and it's at least half an hour before everything clicks together.
The technique does allow for some interesting twists, but I can't help but think the film would
have worked better in the right order. Unlike, "Memento," there's no ostensible reason for the
story to shift its chronology. The first half leaves the audience guessing constantly with every turn
to a point of confusion and then suddenly, Inarritu leads us by the hand, distrusting our ability to
piece together the deep, philosophical meaning of "the weight of our souls." The final voice over
by Penn, which bears the tag line, becomes heavy-handed, as if Inarritu is packaging up the movie
neatly after the mess he leaves us in.
There are, however, definite shining components to this movie. Penn, Watts and Del Toro all
deliver powerful performances. Watts has the toughest role — her portrayal of Christina's
breakdown at the news of her family's death is stunning, and the scene in which Paul (played by
Penn) reveals that he has Christina's husband's heart inside him is equally intense. Penn and Del
Toro also give stalwart performances. Del Toro's masculine looks, detached manner and tattoos
hide a compassionate man who only wants a second chance in life. Penn's portrayal of a dying
man conflicted with guilt is his best work yet.
But overall, Inarritu's move to American cinema is disappointing. With a budget that was re
portedly 10 times that for his Mexican film, Inarritu recycles his first movie but with less intrigue
and brilliance. "Amores Perros" is about three people whose lives become intertwined after a
horrific car accident. "21 Grams" is about three people whose lives become intertwined after a
horrific car accident. "Amores Perros" deals with loss, regret, revenge and above all, love. Dou
ble take. "21 Grams" deals with loss, regret, revenge and above all, love. Alright, and we'll throw
in guilt too.
My biggest problem with "21 Grams" is not that it is "Amores Perros Part II," but that at its
best, it has half its potential. Despite superb performances by powerhouse actors, this movie falls
short of brilliance. "21 Grams" is not a complete loss; for lovers of good acting, it is a wonderful
film to see. But I suggest you watch a matinee show of "21 Grams" and leave the night free for a
rental of "Amores Perros."


Wow. I'm so intense. No, really. I'm so intense!
