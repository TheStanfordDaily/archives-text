# Phantom's 'Guest' overstays visit
## 
### CHRIS LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Phantom Planet's infectious single "Califor
nia" opens with a lazy lick of piano, half whining

melancholy and half
cool-boy casualness. It
then pounds and drives
its way to a crooning cli
max that still feels a little
too understated, ending
just before becoming
fully gratifying. This
same paradigm could be
applied to the rest of
their recent reissue of
"The Guest."
Planet's previous
claim to fame was sport
ing Jason "that kid from
'Rushmore'" Schwartz
man for a drummer, and

for a while this
fact alone
seemed like it
would guarantee
the band if not
respectability
then at least a

defensible spot in arcane pop culture trivia. This
summer provided an added boost, with Fox's
surprisingly appealing teen soap "The O.C."
using "California" for its theme song; quick to
capitalize, the band has repackaged their album
with new art, some previously unreleased tracks
and demos and the requisite multimedia extras

in an obvious attempt to convert a new audience.
Those that don't already own "The Guest" —
and if you do, shelling out again for this version
probably isn't necessary — will be treated to a
consistent if not entirely exciting album of what I

guess is normally
termed So-Cal

power pop,
though most
of the tracks
deliver more
pout than
pop. Lead
singer Alex
Greenwald's
mopey voice isl
effective but!

not uniquely com
pelling, and many
of the songs here
seem to suffer

from a predictable

construction
that renders
them listen
able but not
guiltily
catchy the
way the

crassest pop albums can be. If all you want is
music to rock out to, you'll have to look else
where; there are such few moments of unadulter
ated joy or passion on "The Guest" that I found
myself largely apathetic even after several listens.
How does one rate music that is neither atrocious
nor compelling?

"Always on My Mind" comes closest to the
sound I'd like to hear from Phantom Planet, a si
multaneously sunny and yearning puff piece that
leaves you wanting more, but in a good way. The
band has taken flak in the past for being a kind of
actors' side project — Greenwald himself was
featured in the classic "Everybody in Cords" line

of Gap commercials — but in my
opinion they don't play to this side of
their image enough. It might be far
more exciting for these Planeteers to
just go all the way and churn out true
power pop, replete with simple hooks
and catchy, care-free choruses. "An
them" is effective at transforming the
I overall languidness into something
weepy and elegant, but such moments

are rare. "I'll look for one ray of sunlight to hold
in my hand / maybe we can be happy again" goes
the chorus in "One Ray of Sunlight," and despite
the beautiful simplicity of the music it still feels a
little difficult to take Greenwald's earnestness
seriously. He is, after all, moping about a ray of
sunlight.
And that's the overall impression of the
album — a decent effort that gets bogged down
by too many brooding tempos and Greenwald's
wailing voice. Phantom Planet clearly has the
mechanics of music down pat, they just need a
hard transfusion of edge and energy to take them
to the next level. Watching the band's music
videos, I was more than a little surprised to see
the band members rocking out to their own
tunes; when their next release comes out (slated
Jan. 6), maybe the rest of us will be able to join
them.
