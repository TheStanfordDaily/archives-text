# 'Preacher's Son' now his own man
## 
### MARCEL SOLORZANO 
In 1996, after a low-key debut with their album
"Blunted on Reality," Wyclef Jean, Pras and Lauryn
Hill — better known as The Fugees — released the
classic "The Score." The album's success vaulted

each artist to the
top of the rap
game, and they
split ways. Wyclef
worked on his
first solo effort,
"The Carnival,"
which injected a

mainstream vibe with dance
songs, love ballads and rap hits
that shined a favorable light on
the artist's future. However, his
next two albums never even
lived up to the little hype they
received: Wyclef had fallen off.
It is this trajectory that leads,
us to the release of "Preacher's

Son," Wyclef's most varied and personal record to
date. In order to musically express the cultures that
make him who he is, Wyclef invited a wide range of
guest artists and collaborators aboard this album. He
explains that this is his "first album" because it is the
first time that he has intensely focused on songwrit
ing rather than other aspects of releasing a record.
"That's why I call it Volume One — because it's a
movement back to music. Being a hip-hop musician,
being from a reggae background and of Haitian de

scent, I have a lot of music in my mind."
Throughout "Preacher's Son," the sounds of
these cultures are evident. The album jumps from
hip-hop parties with Missy Elliot, to island jams with
Buju Banton, and back to old soul singing with Patti
Labelle twisted with Fugee style beats and rhymes
delivered by Cassidy. The
names continue to pour out:
Redman, Wayne Wonder,

Elephant Man, Mobb
Deep, Sharissa. Even
Carlos Santana re
turns to trade guitar
riffs with Wyclef just
as they did on San
tana's album with the
hit "Maria Maria." On
"Preacher's Son," the
two take us to Brazil
with the enchanting,
up-tempo, Latin
groove "Three Nights
in Rio."

When Wyclef record
ed "Maria Maria," he

worked with Jive Records president and executive
producer, Clive Davis for the first time. "Preacher's
Son" is the product of a collaboration of these two in

ventive minds over the length of an album. After its
completion Clive noted, "It's very special when an
important artist tops anything he or she has ever cre
atively done. It was thrilling to feel the impact that
comes from hot, exciting, great music that is not only
cutting edge but melodically memorable as well."
With the release of an album as musically diverse
as "Preacher's Son," Wyclef has broken free from the
confines of his genre of choice. His new scope can po-

tentially
make him dis
tinct in the
world of big
name stars.
Whether this
collection can
put Wyclef
back on top
remains to be
seen — after
all, public ac
ceptance isn't
solely won on
the quality of
music. But as
far as the
music goes,
Wyclef has

returned to
form. Now we'll

have to wait and see if everyone can appreciate his
new skills.

"This is Wy cl
varied and personal
record to date"



Wyclef was gone till November. Now he's back and drinkin'.
