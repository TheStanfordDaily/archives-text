Their ongoing legal battle with the villainous Ticketmaster
(highlighted in Rolling Stone) has garnered them the support
of every music lover who has ever been shaken down by that
conglomerate's excessive online service charges($10 for a $32
show!). Amidst this battle royale String Cheese Incident (SCI)
have released "Untying the Not," their fourth studio album
and arguably their most ambitious and daring album to date.
Under the supervision of producer Youth (Paul McCart
ney, The Verve, Paul Okenfold) SCI weave together a record
ing with semblances of "Dark Side of the Moon" and "Abbey
Road." There's a little bit of a lot packed into this 13 track mu
sical romp. The opening track, "Wake Up" — one of the few
with sophisticated lyrics — has a country pulse and an evan
gelical overtone. With Bill Nershi's hook-laden vocals you are
prompted to exercise the cliches of recalculating your life and

making the most of every moment. This theme of making the
most of what little time you have resurfaces in "Sirens" — a
song inspired by death, but with some great harmonica! Al
though many of the songs have grave themes like death and
losing one's mind, the music holds a candle up to the darkness.
In terms of musical amalgams — one doesn't have to look
very far to find them in this album. You can taste a generous
smattering of bluegrass, jazz and even some techno all over
this musical buffet. On "Mountain Girl" —a jazzy/techno
track with some hip steel drum action for texture — the flashy
spoken-word vocal bits are from an old interview producer

Youth had with Jerry Garcia's ex-wife (hence the name
"Mountain Girl"). This attitude of experimental cutting and
pasting can be felt throughout. However, the best and most
poignant track by far is "Elijah"— a great, yet simple song fea
turing with a beautiful piano instrumental by SCI pianist Kyle
Hollingsworth. For a few minutes, you are captivated by flut
tering emotions that seem to float above you. You can just
barely reach for them.
For all you ho-downers, there is a great piece to slap your
knee to — "Valley of the Jig." Violinist Michael Kang blazes
away on his strings with a bluegrass / Celtic melody that ac
centuates the pounding house beat, courtesy of percussionist
Michael Travis. The album ends with the psychedelic, stoner
pleaser "On My Way." It's hard not to think of Pink Floyd
when listening to this track with its somber chant and spacey
ambient instrumentation.
The band does a great job of making every single track vital
to the overall mosaic of the album and Youth's influence can
be felt in the enormous variety within the album — with each
track being easily distinguishable as a separate, essential enti
ty. The album's dynamics are only surpassed by its ambitions.
It is clear that SCI is setting a new studio-oriented course for
their musical future. As for the present, however, this piece of
string is definitely worth untying.
