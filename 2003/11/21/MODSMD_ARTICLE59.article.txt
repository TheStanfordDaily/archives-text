## Retro Guys: The Zombies, Love, The Pretty Things 
### JULIAN WASS 
"It was a day much like today, back in 1965, when the clouds parted, the sun shone down and the magical music fairy
arrived in our fair land."
One of the most tragic realizations a pop music fan can have is that the elements that made the 1960s a magical time
were the exact same things that made the 1970s mediocre. Thinking about 1970 and the Beatles breaking up and Hen
drix overdosing is both too complicated and too depressing, so I chose instead to pin it all on the music fairy, who of
course showed up in 1965 to bless the world with innocence and exploration, and left in 1970, as suddenly as she ap
peared.
60's rock music has two extremes. On one end, The Beatles, who literally defined a generation's style. On the other,
the nearly forgotten one hit wonder's that populate compilations such as "Nuggets" and "Pebbles." Nestled between the
super-famous and the super-obscure exist the adventurous and accessible albums by bands like The Zombies, Love and
The Pretty Things, that made this a distinct musical era rather than a one-off phenomenon.
The Zombies
"Odessey and Oracle," by the Zombies, contains the hit single "Time of the Season"; although a classic, it is ironical
ly one of the weaker songs of the album. The rest of this 1968 opus — certainly their swansong — is a never-ending good
dream. Led by singer Colin Blunstone, he of the dreamy breathy voice, and Rod Argent, he of the soft swirly mellotron
and organ, The Zombies sounded like The Beach Boys ... if their beach was shrouded in fog and the water was never
warm enough to step into. Gloomy? Yes, but in the most romantic way. "Hung Up on a Dream" is everything that "Good
Vibrations" is and more.
Love
The previous year (in 1967), 400 miles south of the improv heavy San Francisco psychedelic scene, a band called Love
recorded an album titled "Forever Changes." Arthur Lee, the enigmatic front-man of Love, led one of the only multi
racial psychedelic rock bands of his time. Concerned more with lush orchestrations than lengthy improvisations, Lee and
rn created a folk rnrk "Sgt Ppppp.r " Not to say that "Forever Changes" is without guts; although not a hp.avily ranking
album by any stretch, the faster paced songs recall Love's beginnings as THE U.S. garage band. This was no more in ev
idence than during the recent Forever Change tour, which featured Arthur Lee performing the entire album live with a
string and horn section.
The Pretty Things
Originally one of the toughest Mod R & B groups around, The Pretty Things evolved their sound to psychedelics pop
when they revamped their line up. 1968's "S.F. Sorrow," the second album by this new line up, is* both one of the most
sonically far-out records of the era and the first true rock opera; Pete Townsend admits that The Who's 1969 album / mu
sical "Tommy" was influenced by "S.F. Sorrow."
While the story of "S.F. Sorrow" is even harder to follow than that of "Tommy," The Pretty Things crafted a pop
album where Beatle-esque harmonies stood firm next to intricate sound collages; most importantly, the whole album has
a hard rock undercurrent that increases its credibility as a rock opera. Singer Phil May's voice falls somewhere between
Mick Jagger and John Lennon, and guitarist Dick Taylor's playing is truly original; for proof check out the bonus tracks
on the CD reissue, including the psych-pop nugget "Walking Through my Dreams" and "Defecting Grey," the latter
being one of the best psychedelic tunes ever recorded.
The Rather Sad Endings
Dick Taylor left the Pretty Things after "S.F. Sorrow" and The Zombies broke up a year before "Odessey and Ora
cle" was released. Love indulged in heroin-based illegal activities that prompted Peter Albin of Big Brother and the
Holding Company to declare "They should be called Hate"; eventually, Arthur Lee ended up in prison... and the 1960's
were over. Or, if you prefer...
"And so, boys and girls... the magical musical fairy's work was done, and she flew away into the clouds, to a new land,
where she could blow everyone's minds all over again."
