# Retro Gals: The Marine Girls
## 
### JENNY ZHANG 
More than a decade before I spent my eighth-grade graduation hiding my
glasses in my purse, and dancing to Everything But the Girl (EBTG)'s '94 hit,
"Missing," Tracey Thorn of EBTG fame was in a band called the Marine Girls.
Originally a quartet formed on the school-grounds of Hertfordshire, The Marine
Girls eventually whittled down to a threesome consisting of Tracey, Alice and
Jane Fox.
"Lazy Ways / Beach Party" is a compilation disc of two full-length LP's re
leased by the Marine Girls. In a the span of one hour, "Lazy Ways / Beach Party"
churns out a series of vocal snapshots reminding us of everything that was fun,
reckless, and sweet about being seventeen and a girl. The Marine Girls don't
seem to give a shit about mastering their instruments, complicating their music,
or even using drums — beats are claps, stomps or any two objects hitting against
each other. The Marine Girls are about girls writing in their journals under a tree,
or drinking lemonade on hammocks, gossiping about boys. They were the girls
in high school who were smarter, sadder and cooler than anyone else.
Musically, "Lazy Ways/Beach Party" is remarkably sparse —justajazz gui
tar, a bass, and practically nothing for percussion. Vocals are like three girls coo
ing into your ear. One imagines being fed chocolate through the ear canal — it's
that sweet.
The second half of the compilation, "Beach Party" was originally released
when Tracy, Jane, and Alice were only 17, and it shows, but in the best possible
way. The first song, "In Love," is incontestably an everyman's favorite — and
why the fuck not? A sweeter song about breaking up with a guy only to find him
in love with someone else a week later could not be sung. "Flying Over Russia"
is a cold-war ditty that, like the rest of the album, is not without elements of bliss
and girly irreverence. It ends with what sounds like a 15-year-old choir girl com
paring Soviet Guards to schoolgirls in the U.K. As her plane lifts off from
Moscow International, she sings, "They tell us you have to do what you're told /
Well, so do we..."
The "Lazy Ways" part of the compilation was the Marine Girl's last release
before breaking up, and features the standout song, "Love to Know," a musing
on growing up, seeing an old boyfriend and wanting him to know how much
you've changed. "Oh Hello Mark it's nice to meet again / Though I'm not the
same girl I was then / Is he still the same / I'll never ask him / But I'd love to know."
The track "That fink, jazz-me-blues boy" is pure shake-it-some-more-on-the
dance-floor fun, while "Honey" is a flirtatious meditation on the complications
of young love. The girls sing, "Doesn't understand me when I say / I'll love him
everyday or at least until this feeling goes away." Then, they proceed to sing the
sassiest la la la's that could ever be sung.
The Marine Girls themselves were fashioned after minimalist pioneers
Young Marble Giants, and their demise gave fever to a new generation of girls
with soft voices who wanted to sing pages of their diary: Slumber Party, The Soft
ies, All Girl Summer Fun Band.
But those are not reasons to love the Marine Girls.
What it comes down to is simply this: The Marine Girls sing songs about being
young, awkward, and foolish, without ever sacrificing their poise, eloquence, or
utter and complete charm.
