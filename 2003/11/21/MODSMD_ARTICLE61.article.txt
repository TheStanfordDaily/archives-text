# We love Canada for its Broken Social Scene
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
In an indie-world hell bent on minimalism, Broken Social Scene
is that rare phenomenon where more is better. This band or "col
lective" of 12 rock musicians hailing from the underground scene in
Canada (wait... isn't everything in Canada underground for us?) is
the brains behind one of the most intense and complex pop records
released this year — "You Forget It In People" — which has had
even the most pessimistic critics raving like acid trippin' groupies.
And this, people, is a band that deserves its groupies.
For in creating a sound that is both atmospheric and earthy, the
members of Broken Social Scene (BSS) display a knack for the one
thing many indie-rockers forgo in their pretension: the melodic
hook. In concert at The Great American Music Hall they under
scored songs like the sleepy ballad "Anthems for a seventeen year
old girl" and the Strokes-stoked "Almost Crimes" with a sublime
rockingness. The playing cast kept rotating as musicians stumbled
on and off stage, but the product was consistently breathtaking —
the band's use of spacey-processing lends the whole enterprise a
strange fragility.
I had the opportunity to talk to bassist Brendan Canning (BSS's

only bassist) before the show about the Toronto band, their upcom
ing projects and the "Best Alternative Album" award they picked
up at the Juno's (Canada's Grammy's).
INT: How did the band get together?
Brendan Canning: It kind of started in high school between [most]
of [us]. It's been a combination of friendships over the last ten years
... Slowly you get extra people into your family and before you
know it, you have a big band and you better start doing something
about it.
INT: How does the songwriting process work in a band with 14
members?
BC: It really depends on whoever's around — [if they're around]
then they'd be included in it... It's a matter of circumstance, loca
tion, inspiration — whoever has the idea.
INT: I heard you recently signed on to Mercury Records (UK).
How will this affect you in terms of artistic control and money?
BC: It shouldn't affect artistic control because I don't think we'd try
to squeeze out a three-and-a-half minute pop song if it didn't feel
right. I think they're well aware that we're not about to start curtail

ing music for the one-luck chance of having a hit on the radio (not
that we're opposed to that idea).
Monetarily speaking, it provides money up-front. We're not far
enough into it where I can divulge much information.
INT: How did it feel to dethrone Celine Dion from the #1 spot on
HMV.ca? How did you celebrate?
BC: It was pretty minor. She probably sells plenty of records in other
ways. I don't think we've ever approached the 5 million mark.
INT: How many copies has "You Forget It In People" sold so far?
BC: 35,000 in North America. A little more in America than Cana
da.
INT: What bands do you like or recommend for readers?
BC: Television, that's a band... I'm trying to think of some obscure
ones. Thelonius Monk-though he's not a band but a piano player. I
like the Phoenix record "United" that came out a few years ago —
it was a pretty excellent pop record... I think we all like Sea &
Cake, Spoon, My Morning Jacket. Back home we like The Con
stantines...
