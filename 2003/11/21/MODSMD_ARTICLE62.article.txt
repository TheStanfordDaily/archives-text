# Shacking Up: Do's and Don'ts

### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
This past weekend, I was faced with my old archenemy, Awk
wardness. But this time he had teamed up with Captain Hangover and
Whose-Room-Am-I-In ... Man. That is to say, I found myself in an
unfamiliar room, with a dull ache in the back of my head, tonguing a
layer of beer film on the roof of my mouth, and re-evaluting the bene
fits of binge drinking.
I looked over to see my hookup, sleeping soundly, comforted by
the reassurance of his homecourt advantage. I, on the other hand, was
a visiting player, far from home, and lacking knowledge of the proper
exiting protocol. Should I wake him with gentle loving murmurs? Slip
quietly out of the room and quietly into the kitchen to quietly steal
Popsicles andfrozen pizza? Or pretend I'm too cool to care but as soon
as I get home play Tori Amos on repeat and write bad poetry. The ex
pectations are so unclear. And all I could think was: If only I had the
materials and manpower to build myself a time machine. That way I
could visit the future, read this article, freak out my future self and fig
ure out what the hell I'm supposed to do.
Instead of time travel, I did the next best thing. I learned. I learned
from my own mistakes, and present you, the readers, with the fruits of
my experience.
DO: Make sure the other party is aware of your exit.
Maybe you think it's cool to be all mysterious and sneaky, but it just
makes you look thoughtless and sets a precedent for awkwardness.
What's going to happen when you (inevitably) run into them at the
CoHo? You're going to have to stare at something extra-hard to avoid
their glance and after about 10 minutes of extra-hard staring, those
eyeballs of yours are gonna hurt bad. Real bad. And you're going to
wish that you'd just said goodbye and acknowledged their presence
when you had the chance.
DO: Steal food from their kitchen on your way out.
Seriously. Especially if you're shacking up at Casa or Xanadu. It's like
their open kitchens are urgingyou: Go ahead! Shove those frozen bur
ritos down your pants. You'll be thanking yourself when the hungover
munchies kick in and your snack has thawed to perfection.
DO: Look through their wallet if you can't remember their name.
Nothing makes me feel more like a saggy divorced waitress who
bleaches her 'stache and refers to blowjobs as "beej's" than not re
membering someone's name the morning after. If you find yourself in
this situation, just look for the name on the ID. But try not to get
caught, cause then you'll just look creepy. And poor.
DON'T: Stay and watch Saturday morning cartoons
Everyone knows the line-up has gone to shit since they canceled
"Talespin" and "Chip 'n' Dale's Rescue Rangers," Now it's all about
over-privileged 10-year-olds who skateboard around and have later
curfews than I do. How depressing. When I was 10,1 played with bro
ken sticks and garbage.
DON'T: Ask them to marry you.
Unless you're hardcore religious in which case you better get married
and pray God doesn't find out about this one. Way to blow your
chance at eternal paradise for five minutes of mediocrity with Fratty
McFrattenheim.
That's all there is to it. Armed with the helpful hints above, you'll
never have to face another awkward morning-after moment. Now get
out there and start screwing like you've never screwed before.
