# What will Stanford students do if the Cardinal wins Big Game?
## 
### 
Were Stanford to win, I think that the Earth would stop
spinning. After it started up again, we'd try to take
down the goalposts, only to he told that such an action,
(along with freshman drinking, Band Run, Secret
Snowflake. and the Mausoleum party) has heenwdfc
prohibited as part of the University's new 'No Fun" plan.

What will Stanford kids do? We'll ail be so
drunk andfirresponsible that the Camarilla and crew
will put Big Game on Alcohol Probation.
'Cal won't know what hit 'em.

They'll pop the bubbly
and keep the party goin'.

I don't know about you, but I'm
calling Ticketmaster to order my
Silicon Valley Classic tickets.

Go home for Thanksgiving?
