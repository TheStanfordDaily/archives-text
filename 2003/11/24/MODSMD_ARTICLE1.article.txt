# Two students win Rhodes Scholarships
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
On his first trip to Africa at the age of 10, senior
Jared Cohen was kidnapped while riding a camel in
Egypt. On his second trip, Cohen was held at gun
point in Morocco. Despite these rocky encounters,
Cohen developed a passionate interest in the politi
cal culture of Africa, and as a result of his work and
research, he was one of two Stanford students
awarded with a Rhodes scholarship on Saturday.
Tessa Bridgeman, Class of 2003, will also begin
studies at the University of Oxford in England next
October.
Cohen and Bridgeman were among 32 American

students selected as Rhodes schol
ars from 963 applicants. Both stu
dents distinguished themselves
from other applicants with then
dedication to academics and then
leadership potential, according to
the selection committee.
Cohen sees his selection as a
Rhodes scholar as an acknowl
edgement of his work and as an
opportunity to continue his stud
ies and develop his interests in

world politics.
"Between the possibility of studying at Oxford
and gaining such respect for my accomplishments, I
really think they were giving me a vote of confidence
in my ability to become a world leader," Cohen said.

"It's a verification that everything you
have done in life has been worth it. I
can't tell you how much it means to
get this and to know that other people
have such confidence in me."
While at Oxford, Cohen, a history
and political science major, plans to
direct his studies toward a doctoral
degree in comparative politics or in
ternational relations. He hopes to
eventually serve as national security
adviser.
Bridgeman, who now works for
the World Bank in Washington, D.C.
studied human biology and interna
tional health and development while
at Stanford. She speaks fluent Spanish
and has worked throughout Latin
America. While in Mexico she re
searched birth defects.
"Tess is such a good example of the

kind of student that makes Stanford
so special. Her work as a scholar is
deeply imbued with the belief that we
all have a responsibility to make the
world a better place," said Director of
University Communications Alan
Acosta, Bridgeman's former resident
fellow in Casa Zapata. "From the mo
ment she arrived at Casa Zapata as a
freshmen, it was clear that she was an
exceptionally intelligent person —
but she also quickly showed the
tremendous spirit and humanity that
are the hallmark of everything she
does."

Cohen, like Bridgeman, has
worked in struggling countries to im
prove living conditions and human
rights. Over the past 12 years, Cohen
has traveled extensively through
Africa, visiting 21 countries. He is flu
ent in Swahili and conversational in
Maa and Kilarusa. He can also read
and write in Arabic, Korean, Hebrew

and Amharic.
In high school Cohen started a
nonprofit organization to send school
supplies and teaching aides to Tanza
nia, and following his freshmen year
of college, he snuck into the Eastern
Congo under a pile of bananas to
meet with perpetrators of the Rwan
dan genocide. During his junior year,
Cohen completed an honors thesis
about the genocide, for which he re
ceived the Hines Prize from the Histo
ry Department. He is currently work
ing with an editor to turn the thesis
into a book.
"I think that the book is really one
of my biggest accomplishments,"
Cohen said. "It combines my main in
terests — pohtics and human rights
— and I'm looking forward to making
my first major academic contribution
to the world of academia."
As if balancing academics, writing
and his interest in art were not enough,

Cohen also works as a consultant for the
Forum on Early Warning and Re
sponse and for PBS Frontline's docu
mentary on the 10-year anniversary of
the Rwandan genocide. In addition,
Cohen, along with junior Adam Forest
and senior Eric Kramon, started "Six
Degrees of Stanford," a human rights
magazine to promote awareness on
campus. Each issue includes six articles
about human rights, with the next issue
set to include an interview that Cohen
conducted with Kenneth Kaunda, who
served as president of Zambia for 27
years.
Though Cohen's and Bridgeman's
accomplishments made them stand out
as candidates for the scholarship, the se
lection process was rigorous and de
manding. It began in September, when
Cohen submitted his application for an
on-campus interview. Following the in
terview, the University wrote a recom
mendation and Cohen advanced to the

state level.
"My first interview at the state
level went horribly, and I walked out
of it resigned to the fact that I
wouldn't get the Rhodes scholarship,"
Cohen said.
During the interview, 10 former
Rhodes scholars grilled him with
questions on topics ranging from soc
cer to human rights to leadership to
the unemployment rate in East Palo
Alto. Despite his reservations after his
first interview, Cohen received a sec
ond interview and then moved on to
the last round in San Francisco.
According to Cohen, after his final
interview Saturday morning, he was so
exhausted that he slept for three hours in
his car in a McDonald's parking lot.
"It's about as intimidating an inter
view that you can ever have," Cohen
said. "It's the most high-pressure
thing that I have ever done in my en
tire fife."

Hours later, the selection commit
tee announced the scholarship recipi
ents.
"They lined us up shoulder to
shoulder, and then they picked four
winners from each of the eight na
tional districts in alphabetical
order," Cohen said. "I was standing
next to Tess, and when they an
nounced both of our names, we just
looked at each other in disbelief. It
was really a surreal moment."
Cohen said that after he learned of
his selection, he called his parents,
who were eating at a restaurant with
his extended family. Both his parents
started crying. Later that evening,
Cohen returned to campus to cele
brate a friend's birthday at Com
padre's; he was woken yesterday
morning by a phone call from the As
sociated Press.
Bridgeman could not be reached
for comment for this article.
