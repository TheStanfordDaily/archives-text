## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
On his first trip to Africa at the age of 10, senior
Jared Cohen was kidnapped while riding a camel in
Egypt. On his second trip, Cohen was held at gun
point in Morocco. Despite these rocky encounters,
Cohen developed a passionate interest in the politi
cal culture of Africa, and as a result of his work and
research, he was one of two Stanford students
awarded with a Rhodes scholarship on Saturday.
Tessa Bridgeman, Class of 2003, will also begin
studies at the University of Oxford in England next
October.
Cohen and Bridgeman were among 32 American

students selected as Rhodes schol
ars from 963 applicants. Both stu
dents distinguished themselves
from other applicants with then
dedication to academics and then
leadership potential, according to
the selection committee.
Cohen sees his selection as a
Rhodes scholar as an acknowl
edgement of his work and as an
opportunity to continue his stud
ies and develop his interests in

world politics.
"Between the possibility of studying at Oxford
and gaining such respect for my accomplishments, I
really think they were giving me a vote of confidence
in my ability to become a world leader," Cohen said.
