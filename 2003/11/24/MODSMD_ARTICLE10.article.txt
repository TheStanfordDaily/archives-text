## We're down on over-achievers 
### EMILY KUEHLER MORGAN SPRINGER 
So we all know that finals, with all of
their righteous fury, are bearing down on us.
And, by bearing down, we mean coming up
in a few weeks. So the way we see it, there
are two options: You could continue with
your life as usual, seeing friends, going to
the movies and generally "wasting" time
until the crunch really hits, or you could sex
ile your roommate to make love to your
textbook (or course reader or notes —if
you actually take them). If you fall into the
second category, we are officially down on
(as in ill-disposed or hostile towards) you.

You, our dear over-achievers, are the
reason that everyone else's life is miserable.
You are the reason that the first category of
people actually do spend 20 hours straight
the weekend before the test and still score
exactly on the mean (plus or minus two
points).

Meanwhile, you're
disappointed at your
mere two standard devia
tions above the rest of us.
You, our dear office
hour addicts, are the cat
alyst that sets off the
chain reaction of
apoplexy that inevitably
seeps through every
dorm on campus come
the last week of the quar
ter.

And don't try to act like you don't know
what we're talking about.
This is why we have

the primal scream — be
cause of you.
And you hurt us in
other ways too. You skip
our birthdays because
you're too busy with your
CS assignment. You hi
jack our lounges on
Thursdays for your
wretched HumBio study

group, totally ignorant of
the Must-See TV lineup
(and as for the rest of your study group —
we're down on them too).

But no, these crazy pre-med types are
not the only group that makes us sad.
This next group of people that makes our
lives (and resumes) miserable has appear
ances of normalcy. But let's be real. You
people are not normal. And you know
what? You guessed it — we're down on you.
That's right, we're talking about all you
people who can't count your extra-curricu
lar activities on one hand. Some of you
beasts can't even keep it to two.
Are you an RA in an all-frosh dorm?
That's great. Emily wanted to be one too,
but got rejected from every house she ap
plied to. Do you also do community ser
vice? That's nice too. It's always good to
give back. Do you coordinate that commu
nity service program? You're pushing it.
Are you also a member of an a cappella
group? You, my reader, have done too
much. Way too much.
You think you still have a life because
you actually see people during your activi
ties, but soon you will realize that you never
see your friends — and no, we're not talk
ing about your subordinates in the Journal
of Undergraduate Limerick Writing that
you just founded.
Inevitably, you will run into your best
friend from the days when you had a life and
your first response will be "Where have you
been? Why don't you ever call me? I
haven't seen you in forever!"
We're not just down on you — you
make us physically ill.
And we haven't even touched upon the
most heinous breed of all. These creatures
aren't in fact a breed at all, but terrible mutts
— the product of an unholy fusion between
the demons of hardcore academia and the
fiends of extracurricular insanity.
You probably haven't seen them around
because they are too busy with their 12 ma
jors, three co-terms, five committees and
three student publications.
The rest of us dropped that back in high
school to make time for what we really care
about. You may think that your passion
about all those "commitments" is genuine.
But you clearly don't know what commit
ment is. In the real world, no one cares how
many bachelor's degrees you have — when
people find out you have seven, they'll be
down on you too.
So for all you overachievers — here's a
limerick for your journal:
At Stanford some students you find
who always have work on their mind
they piss off your friends
they're alone in the end
and we're down on all of your kind

down on you too.
So for all you overachievers — here's a
limerick for your journal:
At Stanford some students you find
who always have work on their mind
they piss off your friends
they're alone in the end
and we're down on all of your kind

Do you too want to create a Journal of Un
dergraduate Limerick Writing? E-mail your
submission to ekuehler@stanford.edu or ml
springer@stanford.edu. We're not busy.
