# THE 						SUPA BUNCH
## Stanford psychology students get SUPA fly help from undergraduate organization 
### ARAM HUR 
Students busily hustle inside, excited and rosy-faced from
the cold, wintry breeze. When the professor walks in, they
begin cordial introductions. The aroma of hot pizza floods the
room at this luncheon for 18 undergraduate psychology stu
dents.
The magic hand behind the event is SUPA, the Stanford
Undergraduate Psychology Association. Cheesy acronym
aside, the group is no joke. Boasting more than 300 members,
SUPA is a student-run organization deeply ingrained in the
culture of the Stanford Psychology Department. Although
the organization has had its ups and downs, for 20 years it has
helped to bring together members of the psychology commu
nity at Stanford.
"I wanted to get involved with something out of the class
room," said Jenny Louie, a group member. "Also, the more
involved with SUPA you are, the more you know what's going
on in the department."
SUPA is united under the mission of providing help to
Stanford's undergraduates who are thinking of pursuing psy
chology studies. There are approximately 180 declared psy
chology majors and 20 minors in the organization.
In addition to more social events like faculty lunches and
dinners, SUPA will be hosting its own microcosm of eBay, the
Silent Auction, a charity event. Gift certificates to various
local restaurants will be up for bidding and proceeds will be
donated to the Rape Trauma Service in San Jose.
"Last year, we made over $1,400 for the Center for Domes
tic Violence Prevention. We hope to make as much as we can

this year," said Laura Nowell, SUPA's director of publicity.
SUPA also conducts a variety of information sessions
and panels to spur interest in the campus's psychology
initiatives. It has already hosted a research fair this year
that introduced many undergraduate students to the re
search assistant opportunities open to them. As fall
quarter wanes, SUPA has also kicked planning for next
quarter's events into high gear and has both a career
panel and graduate school panel on its schedule.
"For the career panel, we're going to invite Stanford psy
chology alumni, especially those who aren't related solely to
the academic field," said Felicity Miao, the group's president.
The panel will be an opportunity for students curious about
the practical applications of psychology, or simply for those
contemplating psychology majors.
Unlike many of SUPA's other initiatives, the graduate
school panel is an event custom-tailored to juniors and se
niors majoring in psychology. It will cast light on the graduate
school application process and dispel or confirm some of the
popular myths about graduate school.
SUPA also has established a core group of members that
are available to offer help and mentorship to aspiring psych
students on a regular basis. The SUPA core consists of three
peer advisers, fellow undergraduate psychology majors who
hold office hours.
"SUPA needs committed and creative people on the core,"
said Nowell. "We have many subcommittees as well, so it's
our job to keep everyone motivated and in tune."
