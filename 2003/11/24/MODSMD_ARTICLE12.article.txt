## Block Party-goers left in the cold 
### 
On Saturday night, the ASSU
spent approximately $15,000 to
fund a Block Party in White
Plaza. As one of the organiza
tion's Absolute Fun initiatives, the party
was designed to offer students with an al
ternative to drinking after Big Game. But
unfortunately, the Block Party failed to
provide a viable alternative to more tradi
tional campus parties
which include alcohol.

The ASSU planned
the Block Party to co
incide with Big Game.
This required that the
event be held in the
middle of November.
Temperatures have
been approaching —
if not reaching — the
freezing point for
weeks now. The ex
pectation that stu
dents would be eager
to spend three hours
of their Saturday
evening shivering in
the middle of campus
amounts to a gross
oversight on behalf of
ASSU organizers.
Even with outdoor

heating systems, White Plaza was still chilly
and uninviting on Saturday night. Had the
ASSU planned the Block Party earlier in
the year or had organizers planned an in
side event, the function may have been
more successful.
The party's shortcomings were not limit
ed to temperature. The ASSU promised
students a night of "Absolute Fun," but the

event was something closer to a dilapidat
ed carnival. A few bands played to an ever
diminishing crowd gathered near the
Bookstore and a deejay spun discs next to
the Clock Tower. Only four other attrac
tions were offered, and by the end of the
night, at least one of them had broken. Stu
dents seeking nourishment —or as the
ASSU billed it, "Absolute Yum" — were

confronted with a
half-hour line that ul
timately resulted in a
half-filled bag of pop
corn. And whoever
thought that sno
cones in the middle of
November was a
good idea needs to
cross off party-plan
ning as a viable ca
reer option.
A quick glance at
Block Party atten
dees revealed a num
ber of intoxicated in
dividuals who pre
sumably "preloaded"
on alcohol before the
event — another in
dication of the
event's failed aims.

This year, $50,000
was allocated to the ASSU's "Absolute
Fun" initiative. Nearly a third of that
money was expended on a failed effort to
keep students from drinking after Big
Game. If the initiative is to approach any
thing resembling success, the ASSU must
learn from its missteps with Saturday's
Block Party and spend its remaining funds
wisely.

"Theparty's shortcomings
were not limited to
temperature. The ASSU
promised students a
night of Absolute Fun,'
but the event was
something closer to a
dilapidated carnival."
