# Gaieties satire rooted in truth
## 
### 
The annual Gaieties musical is an
event that helps rally Stanford spir
it before Big Game. Typically, the
century-old show includes a group
of actors playing Cal students who want de
stroy Stanford.

As in past performances, humor about the
rivalry was still at the heart of this year's Gai
eties production, which ended its run on Fri
day night. But the musical also included social
commentary on recent changes in campus life
— including the Alcohol Policy, bicycle tick
ets and the "Serial Groper."
Many University officials attended the
production. Others, such as University

President John Hennessy, made it onto
stage with cameo performances and deliv
ered a series of crowd-pleasing jokes.
Parody only succeeds if it is founded on
truth. And judging from audience cheers at
several Gaieties jokes — including one in
volving Saddam Hussein's reign of oppres
sion and the Alcohol Policy — we believe
that Gaieties has provided a valuable com
mentary on some drastic changes in student
life this year. We hope the administration
takes the commentary as a learning experi
ence and seriously works with students to
remedy the aspects of student life that fall
short of expectations.
