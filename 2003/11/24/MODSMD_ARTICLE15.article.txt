## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK Dear Mr. President, how are you? 
### 
The traffic from London to Ox
ford after last week's massive
anti-Bush rally was so bad that
the 90-minute bus ride took
twice as long as usual. I used the extra
time to write a letter to President
George W. Bush. I also ate a sandwich.

Dear Mr. President,
Did you know that a lot of British
people are really, really mad at you? I
mean REALLY mad. I know this be
cause I saw them protesting outside Par
liament today. You were inside, so you
might have missed it.
I'm only writing you about this be
cause last month, when you visited In
donesia, the largest Muslim country in
the world, you seemed surprised at how
much anti-American sentiment was ex
pressed there. And I don't think you
were kidding either. I think you were
genuinely quite surprised. So I figured it
wouldn't hurt to give you a heads-up
from England.
Let me tell you, Mr. President, angry
British people aren't as fun as you might
think — and they can sure hold a
grudge. Guy Fawkes tried to stage a
gunpowder plot here almost 400 years
ago, and people are still pissed about it.
They're mostly angry about why you
and Mr. Blair decided to go to war with
Iraq. The British aren't too keen on
politicians who let misguided self-assur
ance overrule their good judgment. I'm
sure you can understand this on some

level, being from the same state as Ross

Perot and all.
This kind of re
minds me of some
thing my mom used
to say when I little —
I think you would re
ally like my mom,
Mr. President. Like
you, she is a big fan of
Jesus. Boy, does she
love Jesus! She loves
Jesus more than
Brian Boitano and

Richard Gere combined (which is a lot).
Also, she used to be a cheerleader too. So
you see, you have a lot in common.
Anyway, whenever I tattled on my
older sister after a fight, my mom would
look me in the eye and say, "Not just her
to make fighting. You too."
After I thought about this for a while,
I'd eventually realize that it made sense
... Like, maybe my sister wouldn't let me
play with her make-up because last time
I ate all her Chapsticks (except the black
one, which is skunk flavor). I don't know
why I ate them. But I did. Then, all of a
sudden, I wasn't so mad at her anymore.
Was your mom anything like mine
when you were a kid? Did she say things
like that (but, you know, in grammatically
correct sentences) when you and your
brother fought? Maybe she did. Or maybe
she reached for whatever blunt object was
handy and told you to clobber him over
the head with it. Or maybe she told you to
be nice to dear old Jeb because one day
you might need him to be nice to you.
I don't know your mom very well,

but I've always admired her hair. It
looks so soft and fluffy, like it was float
ing along in the sky and just decided to
land on top of her head. Does she use a
special kind of conditioner?
I saw your dad on TV all the time
when I was younger. Do you guys ever
argue? My dad used to joke around
whenever I tried to argue with him.
He'd say things like, "OK, if I'm big time
dummy, you are my little dummy."
Then he'd laugh and laugh like he
hadn't used that line a million times be
fore. (Does you dad do this too? How
come dads always do this?)
Well, I hope you and your family
have a very happy Thanksgiving (gob
ble gobble)! Your wife has a lovely
smile. Strangely enough, I'll be in
Madrid, Spain on Thanksgiving.
Christopher Columbus was from Spain,
you know. I have mixed feelings about
him, but at least he has something to do
with America.
Your fellow American,
Jennie Kim
P.S. Bob Woodward says you can
bench press 205 pounds. Wow! It's so nice
to finally have a President with a disci
plined fitness regime — none of that silly
jogging to McDonald's business that
Clinton used to pull. Let me know when
you hit 225.

Only two percent of American citizens
have ever written to the president. E-mail
Junior Jennie Kim to bemoan the lost art
of letter writing at jenniek@stanford.edu.

Your fellow American,
Jennie Kim
P.S. Bob Woodward says you can
bench press 205 pounds. Wow! It's so nice
to finally have a President with a disci
plined fitness regime — none of that silly
jogging to McDonald's business that
Clinton used to pull. Let me know when
you hit 225.

Only two percent of American citizens
have ever written to the president. E-mail
Junior Jennie Kim to bemoan the lost art
of letter writing at jenniek@stanford.edu.
