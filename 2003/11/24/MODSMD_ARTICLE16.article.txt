## Irony hides within the Clark Center 
### JEFF KOCH 
The James H. Clark Center
houses engineers, biologists,
medical researchers and physi
cal scientists. It houses some
thing else, too: irony.
The building and the Bio-X pro
gram inside suggest that academe is fi
nally jazzed about generalists or at least
about those interested in working
across disciplines.
One irony is that what the Universi
ty holds out as new — freethinking is in,
obscure specialization is out — is an old
story in the Silicon Valley. In other
words, what took so long?
Visible protagonists of this story are
everywhere. They are the Valley's tech
nology stars of the last several decades.
These are the executives who talk about
hardware and software design in the
morning, develop marketing strategies
over lunch, negotiate venture capital
deals in the afternoon and then deliver
eloquent descriptions of the potential of
technology to reshape the world in an
evening speech or interview.
Of course this is a caricature, but
there are many nearby who built success
ful careers and companies by being good
at more than one thing.
One is Apple's Steve Jobs. To this
day, Jobs is challenging notions of prod
uct design and finding new ways —
think iTunes — to reach customers.
Another is Andy Grove. A physical
chemist by training, he achieved fame
for his strategic thinking. Grove helped
transform Intel from a struggling com
pany that sold memory into the world's
top supplier of computer chips. Though
his star probably peaked when he was
Time magazine's Man of the Year in
1997, some still consider him the reign
ing patriarch and godfather of the com
puter industry.
And, of course, another more recent
example is the namesake of the Clark
Center himself. James Clark dropped out
of high school and served in the U.S. Navy
for four years. He earned degrees from
middling universities like the University
of New Orleans in Louisiana and the Uni
versity of Utah and then was a professor

at Stanford for a few years.
He is the most generous supporter of
biology research in Stanford history not
because of his academic training and ac
complishments but because of what hap
pened after he left university life. His
technology innovations in the areas of
computer graphics, Web browsing and
medical records made him one of the
most famous and wealthy Valley en
trepreneurs in the 1990s.
Clark is not the first to cut across
fields of specialization. A generation
earlier another maverick, R. Buckmin
ster Fuller, did the same thing. And a
brief look at "Bucky" leads to the second
irony, that universities have never much
liked people who are really committed
to crossing professional boundaries.
Bucky, whose papers are housed at
Stanford, is best known for inventing
geodesic domes like the futuristic
spheres at Epcot Center in Orlando and
the Missouri Botanical Garden in St.
Louis. But, like Clark, he ranged widely
in his life and spent the bulk of his career
outside of universities.
After dropping out of Harvard Uni
versity twice and running a family busi
ness into the ground, he became a free
lance inventor. In the 1930s and 1940s,
he invented what he hoped would be
mass-produced solutions to housing and
transportation problems around the
world, none of which sold successfully.
He wrote the book "Operating Manual
for Spaceship Earth," which helped to
illustrate the importance of acting re
sponsibly toward the planet's finite re
sources and to influence the early envi
ronmental movement.
He had fantastical notions, too, in
cluding an idea to rebuild the blighted
city of East St. Louis. Bucky proposed
no less than a mile-wide geodesic um
brella that would cover a futuristic struc
ture that would house thousands. It
promised to solve the problem of urban
decay by creating a classless, energy-ef
ficient community.
Though few physical artifacts of his
work remain, his influence is still felt
today. In fact, Bucky even may have in
fluenced the design of the Clark Center
ever so subtly.

Sir Norman Foster, the famed archi
tect who designed the Clark Center, oc
casionally collaborated with Bucky.
"I remember, in 1978, showing him our
Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts and
being startled when he asked: 'How much
does your building weigh?'" Foster wrote,
describing one particularly telling ex
change early in his relationship with
Bucky. "The question was far from rhetor
ical. He was challenging us to discover how
efficient it was; to identify how many
tonnes of material enclosed what volume."
Foster remains a fan of Bucky's, but
mind-expanding questions like these
did not endear Bucky to everyone.
Though he collected many honorary de
grees, most scholars considered Bucky
to be nothing more than a polemical
self-promoter and charlatan. He taught
at Southern Illinois University. But
even in Carbondale — far from the
well-trod path of the Ivies, Stanford and
the other major research universities —
he eventually ran afoul of more conser
vative faculty and administrators.
And yet Bucky's ideas echo today in
Bio-X, the premiere cross-discipline re
search program, and in one of the pre
miere universities in the world.
"Ideas and methods ... are being
brought to bear upon important chal
lenges in bioscience. In turn, bioscience
creates new opportunities in other
fields," the Bio-X Web site explains.
This sounds an awful lot like Bucky,
the self-proclaimed generalist who once
said, "How often I found where I should
be going only by setting out for some
where else."
The Bio-X program is many things. It
is an ambitious and laudable endeavor,
for sure. It is rife with potential to acceler
ate multidisciplinary research in biology
and medicine. Housed in a building that is
beautifully architected with perhaps the
best restaurant on campus, it is another
great reason to be a scientist at Stanford.
But whether it will be the first real
university home for eccentric generalists
and geniuses — today's Jim Clarks and
Bucky Fullers — remains to be seen.
