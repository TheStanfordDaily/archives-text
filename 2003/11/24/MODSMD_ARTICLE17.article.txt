Milgrom's speech did not focus
on the politics of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict

Some members of this community
have questioned Hillel at Stanford's
co-sponsorship of Rabbi Jeremy Mil
grom's presentation on "Judaism,
Zionism, and Non-Violence." The
program, which was brought to cam
pus by Stanford's Office for Religious
Life, centered on a theological and
philosophical examination of Jewish
religious texts that lend support to a
theory of nonviolence. It is this text
focused exploration of nonviolence
that Hillel at Stanford co-sponsored as
part of Hillel's commitment to create
a spectrum of religious and education
al programming. The program was not
intended to be a political or advocacy
presentation. Thursday's Daily head

line ("Milgrom favors bi-national
state," Nov. 20) misrepresents the
thrust of the content of the program
and does not reflect Hillel's position
on Israel.
Hillel at Stanford is committed to
the existence of a Jewish, democratic
state of Israel within secure and peace
ful borders. Within that framework,
Hillel actively supports a variety of po
litical, educational and advocacy pro
grams and brings speakers to Stanford
who represent a range of views on the
political situation in Israel. This month
alone, Hillel's Israel education pro
gram included Israeli Minister of Knes
set Limor Livnat and former Minister
of Knesset Yossi Beilin; programs in
early winter quarter will include a dis
cussion on Alan Dershowitz's book
"The Case for Israel" and a lecture by
Herb Kenion, diplomatic correspon

dent for The Jerusalem Post.

The Daily's unfortunate headline and
story on Rabbi Jeremy Milgrom ("Mil
grom favors bi-national state," Nov. 20)
neglected to convey his religious vision,
which holds the complexity of searching
for peace and seeking the humanity of the
other in the most highly charged of cir
cumstances. Both his demeanor and his
words were that of a religious leader seek
ing to explicate the texts of a tradition
with thoughtfulness and faithfulness.
