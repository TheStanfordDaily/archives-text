## Controversial ads shouldn't have run 
### SHEBA NAJMI 
Ramin Setoodeh, editor in chief of
The Stanford Daily, made an executive
decision to keep running the Campus
truth.org advertisements for their full du
ration. He said that "no single word,
phrase or image in the ads demonstrates
prejudice" ("Controversial ads will keep
running," Nov. 4). Setoodeh's decision
cannot be legally challenged under the
First Amendment. But the editor of a re
spectable newspaper is expected to use a
higher standard than legality.
Campustruth.org was astute enough
to ensure that the individual words, phras
es and images they used were "factual."
But facts do not exist in isolation. Isolated
"facts" silence other "facts," such as:

• Israel is in violation of 28 resolutions
of the U.N. Security Council.
(Canada-Israel Committee, Hansard:
Special Debate on Iraq, Oct. 2002 and
Syrian Foreign Ministry)
• On Sept. 16,1982, a unit of 150 Is
raeli-allied Phalange militia entered the
Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps, with
permission from the Israeli defense min
ister. For the next 62 hours, they raped,
killed and mutilated civilians inside the
encircled and sealed camps. The estimate
number of the killed varies from 700 (the
official Israeli military intelligence figure)
to 3,500 (Palestinian and other sources).
Not a single person has been brought to
justice for this.
(Human Rights Watch News, June 23,
2001)

• The Israeli army has violated 29 of
the 30 Universal Declaration of Human
Rights articles.
(BTselem, The Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occu
pied Territories)
• Between Sept. 29,2000, and Nov. 7
of this year, 2,221 Palestinians were killed
by Israeli security forces in the occupied
territories, of whom 420 were minors.
(BTselem, The Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occu
pied Territories)
• From Oct. 2001 to Oct. 2003, Israel
completely demolished 453 houses as
punishment.
(B'Tselem, The Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occu
pied Territories)
• 185 Palestinian schools have been
shelled or fired upon by Israelis since
Sept. 29,2000.
(IfAmericansKnew.org)
• Israel allots 85 percent of the water
resources in the occupied territories for
Israelis, and the remaining 15 percent is
divided among all Palestinians. In He
bron, that means 85 percent of the water
for 500 settlers and the remaining 15 per
cent for 120,000 Palestinians.
(Palestine Media Watch)
• 60 percent of Palestinians are kept
below the poverty line of $2 per day.
(Amnesty International, Sept. 2003)
As you know, these facts by them
selves do not tell the whole truth either.
And yet they are all well documented. My
point is to emphasize that the Palestine /

Israel issue is a very complicated one. Se
toodeh said, "It is our duty as a newspaper
to base our judgment on facts alone —
and what is explicitly presented in an ad
vertisement" ("Controversial ads will
keep running," Nov. 4).
We expected a more sophisticated,
thoughtful examination of these explo
sive Campustruth ads from the editor
in chief of The Daily before he printed
them. Their sole purpose was to incite
anger and hatred against an entire
community of human beings. Factual
does not mean neutral, and it certainly
does not mean the truth. Moreover,
the legality of partial accounts is not
the only criterion for the basis of pub
lishing them.
The important question is: Where
does the editor in chief draw the line? If
a hate-based organization such as the
KKK wrote a sensationalistic ad listing
only negative "facts" about African-
Americans, would the editor in chief
publish that too? It could well be a "fac
tual" ad and, under the line Setoodeh
has chosen to follow, he certainly would.
Would he dare to argue as well that the
KKK message "foster(s) greater under
standing among those in the University
community" ("Controversial ads will
keep running," Nov. 4) and that these
published "facts" do not demonstrate
prejudice?

Symbolic Systems program, researching
social identity vis-a-vis race and ethnicity."
