## NY Times must regain trust 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
This is a post-Halloween story and it's
pretty scary. It's about made-up news and
things that didn't happen which newspa
pers reported anyway. It's about loud
noises and things that startle us, but which
turn out to be nothing at all. It's about
Jayson Blair and The New York Times.
Maybe you remember Jayson â€” not
the one who scares everybody on Friday
the 13th, but the one who scared The
New York Times last spring when it was
revealed that he had been planting razors
in tasty newsbytes. Jayson wrote a num
ber articles that were not true. The Times
ran scared. There was some bloodletting
and loud pot banging as the paper's top
two editors resigned. Last month, The
Times announced the appointment of an
ombudsman, Daniel Okrent, as public
editor "to address readers, comments
about The Times' coverage."
According to the press release an
nouncing Mr. Okrent's appointment, he
will have wide latitude to get behind the
scenes and rake the muck as he sees fit.

So now the stage is set for The Times
to thoroughly examine its own methods,
but stage sets are not always what they
appear to be. The question is whether
The Times will really examine its meth
ods of news gathering or if it merely
wishes to convince the public that such a
reevaluation is occurring. This question
and answer are profoundly important
because for many thousands of people
and newspapers alike The Times is syn

onymous with news reported fairly, ac
curately and in-depth.

Journalists around the world esteem
the paper. For the rest of us, the it has
helped us separate tabloid journalism
from truth. But as the very public fallout
from the Blair affair revealed, while the
Emperor may indeed have been wearing
clothes, the clothes may have been mere
ly costume. The New York Times may
regain our trust, but not with illusion.
. One area of coverage the newspaper
needs to thoroughly re-examine is the
way in which it reports foreign news sto
ries. American newspapers frequently
report foreign news stories in ways that
emphasize conflict, danger and disaster.
The temptation for reporters to exagger
ate and emphasize those elements is par
ticularly strong when reporters are solo
correspondents in areas.
Unfortunately, unless a story "zings,"
it is likely to get cut. Thus, there is a ten
dency for some reporters to misreport re
ality. In other words, the stories often are
sheep in wolves' clothing. Newspapers'
patterns of creating negative foreign
news stories lead Americans to believe
the world is a more dangerous place than
it actually is and to mistrust foreigners.

The news commentator Walter
Cronkite used to end with the famous
tagline, "And that's the way it is." The
Times should take this opportunity to
reinvest in its readers a faith that "the
news that's fit to print" truly is the way it is.
