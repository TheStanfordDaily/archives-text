# Hoover hosts discussion on future of Iran
## 
### PRIYANKA PATHAK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The United States should be more involved
in the governance and politics of Iran, scholars
argued Friday at a conference at the Hoover
Institution on the political climate in Iran and
U.S.-Iran relations.
In President George Bush's State of the
Union Address in January 2002, he announced
his resolve to pursue the war on terrorism by
targeting states that support terrorist organiza
tions. Iran was one of those states included in
the address. Nearly two years later, some
speakers contended, the Bush Administration
continues to be unclear about its plans for ap
proaching Iran.
"As far as I know, the policy of the U.S. to
wards Iran is one of no policy at all," said Po
litical Science Prof. Michael McFaul, a senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution.
McFaul stressed the importance of engaging
the Iranian leadership.
"It is very important for people to have a
sense of what is going on there in Iran," he said.
"The U.S. and Iran have a lot to benefit from
each other in the long run. We need to aggres
sively work towards truer form of democracy in
Iran."
The scholars from Iran agreed with him.
"The condition in Iran is at a point where
people need help," said Hormoz Hekhmat, the
editor of Irannameh, a quarterly
Persian-language journal of social
science. "The students and uni
versity campuses need civil liber
ties. The current Iranian govern
ment has been actively avoiding
any contact with the U.S., as such
interaction is against its interest.
Extension of U.S.-Iran relations
will mean death to the Islamic re
public of Iran."

Structural problems

Iran has a unique form of
democracy — it has a parliament
and three branches of the govern
ment, and people do vote. How
ever, many of the most substan
tive powers are vested in the spir
itual leader.

Freedom of speech, expression
and association is curtailed by
legal restrictions and by flaws in
the administration of justice,
speakers argued, which has re
sulted in a catalogue of unfair tri
als and imprisonments of the pris
oners of conscience.
"This is one of the most im
portant challenges facing Iran
today," said AbdulKarim Lahi
ji, vice president of the Paris
based International Federation
of Human Rights and president
of the Iranian League of
Human Rights. "There has
been a clumsy attempt to com
bine the divine laws and human
laws. As a lawyer, I don't be
long to any religion. Yet, out of
respect for it, I think that ref
erence to law in the judiciary
can be made only if the follow
ing conditions are met: One,
freedom of religion and free
dom to change it. Two, there
cannot be any religious basis to
human rights. They are univer
sal. Three, it must be clear that

religion is completely clear of
politics."
Highlighting the misery of the
judiciary in Iran, Lahiji stressed
the importance of making laws
that are not hostage to Islamic
theology.
Lahiji highlighted the structur
al problems of the system and its
impact on normal life.
"People give up trying to un
derstand law that can change at
one man's whims," he said. "In
stead, they decide to censor them
selves, as there is no real security
of law. Iranians are less religious
than Americans and yet are stuck
in a system where the laws that
govern them are based on Islamic
theology. People are a victim of a
system that only one man, the
spiritual leader, can change. But
who can force him to make this
change? I don't know."

The nuclear question

Iran has tested for nuclear
weapons, but it is unknown how
close it is to having weapons.
"There is some hope for Iran
right now. If the current regime
gets the bomb, the future is
bleak," said Larry Diamond, a se
nior fellow at the Institute for In
ternational Studies.
Najmedin Meshaktii, associate
professor of engineering at the
University of Southern Califor
nia, said, "Why should Iran not
have nuclear energy? Nuclear en
ergy is the future. There is no get
ting around it. However, my con
cern is the fact the secrecy shroud
ing its production can cause se
vere hazard for the world."
Many people in the audience
disagreed. Several Iranians
protested about why such a fuss is
made about Iran going nuclear
while people look the other way
regarding "rogue states" such as
Pakistan.
