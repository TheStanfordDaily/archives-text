## Islam can coexist with 'fatherly' old faith of Judaism, as well as Christianity 
### ROBERT COHEN 
The early pages of the Bible are like stem cells
of our Western — Judeo-Christian — culture.
In Genesis, the God-human (vertical) relation
is primal. The fundamental tone is awe, love and
fear mingled, as we see it in the eyes of the won
dering newborn looking up at us and beyond. This
transparent "moment of truth" is too pure and
deep to be sustained, and a foundational pivoting
soon occurs toward (horizontal) time, flow,
change, becoming, the strung-out narrative or his
tory of existence. The God-human relation shifts to
human-human. Adam "knows" Eve, Cain mur

ders Abel. Instead of pure communion of soul and
heart with the sacred Source, we get an endless
babbling accompanying the development of brain
(or mind, which "feeds back") along with the or
gans of various movement.
In "inspired" moments, as in our finest creators
and thinkers — poets, artists, philosophers — the
evolved creature loops back into the primal com
munion. This is rare in each of us and in the "cast
ing," the distribution of roles, in the overall human
drama.
If we want to understand any perplexing event,
as now, we must shut out the babbling and medi
tate, occasionally checking in with some rare seri

ous minds in books or society, including promi
nently in the Bible.
There we see the pivoting from the awesome,
unbearably steep relation with God as the total
Adamic exile from Eden and the beginning of the
human narrative as a "looping" pilgrimage toward
Eden regained, on the way back to the total Source,
in "Heaven."
Accordingly, along with the development of
manipulatory mind, language and civilizing striv
ing (as in the Babel episode) we get the first mur
der, the Cain-Abel story, which is the perpendicu
lar ("pivoted") branch or dimension of the primal
Father-child relation (as in the stories of David and

Absalom, Prometheus, Oedipus, Daedalus-Icarus,
Theseus-Hippolytus).
This can take us everywhere in world culture,
but the point here is to understand the "faultline"
of our relation to the Islamic and / or Arab world.
Islam traces its decent to Abraham, who is sup
posed to have gone to Mecca and built the Kaba,
the original monument of the faith. His son by
Hagar, Ishmael, according to Genesis (accepted
by Islam) is the first of their line.
This sets up a basic "Oedipal" tension between
Islam and the "fatherly" old faith Judaism, which
soon pivots into its horizontal version as in the re
sentment and assault by Cain — Ishmael is de

scribed in just such terms of angry revolt. For it is
the all-too-human enduring fact that we try to "get
a handle" on the fear in "terrible" awe in this way
of aggression: Fear is projected inwardly into "lin
ear" hate and, outwardly, assault; the phenomenon
of scapegoating is closely parallel.
This built-in tension was aggravated after 1500
when the West forged ahead in earthly powers.
Well, sons and daughters can learn to live with
challenging parents or successful older siblings. For
example, Jews and Christians manage pretty well
in most of the West. One can hope.
