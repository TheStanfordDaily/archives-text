## Missed opportunities haunt Cardinal 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
In the first half of Saturday's Big Game, California had lost three
fumbles, thrown an interception and turned the ball over on downs,
while missing two field goals and converting just one of seven third
downs. The Golden Bears went into the locker room trailing Stan
ford, 10-0, after repeatedly derailing themselves with careless plays.
"We felt like it probably couldn't get any worse than that," Cal re
ceiver Geoff McArthur said. "They only had 10 points on five or six
turnovers ... so that's probably what helped us stay confident."
Sure enough, Cal's offense came out in the second half and
found the composure that has helped it average more than 30 points
per game. Stanford, though, never got on track after putting up 10
quick points thanks to two Cal turnovers, going scoreless for the
next 55 minutes before scoring a meaningless touchdown as time
expired.
Cal totaled seven fumbles, three missed field goals and a turnover
on downs. Eleven wasted possessions, though, did not stop the Bears
from racking up 533 yards of total offense and 28 points.
Costly mental errors proved much more lethal for the frighten
ingly conservative Stanford offense.
A fumbled opening kickoff led to a Michael Sgroi field goal and
a fumble by Adimchinobe Echemandu led to a 24-yard touchdown
reception by senior Luke Powell, but Stanford's offense bogged
down when facing a long field, as the defense repeatedly generated
turnovers to no avail.
Early in the second quarter, Stanford reached Cal's 9-yard line,
but center Drew Caylor's third-down shotgun snap sailed past quar
terback Chris Lewis — who was checking the play off to his right
and misheard the snap count — and Cal's Daymeion Hughes out
hustled Lewis to the ball, recovering it 22 yards behind the line of
scrimmage.
"He's a competitor and he was trying to do the best he could out
there, but he had a couple freaky plays," Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens said of Lewis.
Stanford faced third-and-three from Cal's 16-yard line with
under two minutes to go in the first half. Lewis had good pass pro
tection, but his primary receivers were not open, so he checked
down to junior running back Kenneth Tolon, who was wide open
in the right flat, with a probable touchdown in sight. Tolon turned
carefully to receive the ball, perhaps too carefully, muffing the
pass. The incompletion led to a missed 33-yarder by Sgroi.
Cal gave credit to Stanford's defense for forcing so many
turnovers.
"Those guys are ball-hawks," said Echemandu, who fumbled
twice. "The first guy would wrap you up, then the second or third guy
would come in and punch the ball out."
Stanford linebacker David Bergeron said the defense was proud
of the opportunities it gave the offense early on.
"We really wanted to set the tone early, and we did that," he said.
But, Cal figured out Stanford's defensive schemes and attacked
relentlessly with long pass after long pass from quarterback Aaron
Rodgers, who set a career high with 359 yards passing, to McArthur,
who caught a school-record 16 passes for 245 yards.

"It was disheartening, because we knew it was the same team run
ning the same plays," Bergeron said. "It wasn't as much them as it
was us failing to do the things we needed to do."
Cal credited head coach Jeff Tedford's game plan.
"Tedford's genius," Rodgers said when asked the reason for
Cal's success in the second half. "He put them in situations where
they weren't really able to double on Geoff... and [McArthur] is
too good for that."
Stanford stuck with single coverage on McArthur throughout the
game, though, not simply because double-covering him would have
been difficult.
"That's just how we've played all year," cornerback Leigh Tor
rence said.
Added Bergeron: "We ask a lot of our corners ... we put them in
tough situations and unfortunately [Cal] came up with more balls
than we did."
While Stanford was pleased with the forced turnovers, its defense
tired in the second half, yielding 67-, 82- and 70-yard touchdown
drives.
"The defense was out there a long time," Teevens said. "We were
forcing turnovers, playing aggressively, but we just failed to con
vert."
Tedford said he had expected Cal to break through in the second
half.
"After halftime, we calmed down and went out and executed like
we knew we could," he said. "We just thought what happened to us
in the first half couldn't happen to us in the second half. The guys did
a much better job."
For Stanford, the blown lead was especially frustrating.
"We were pretty confident," Powell said of the team's attitude
after taking the early lead.
Cal, though, was confident, too — even when Stanford wasn't
making mistakes.
"We ran a lot of the same plays [repeatedly], and we took what
they gave us," Rodgers said. "We're pretty smart about what they're
doing."
That sentiment went for the Cal defense as well, which held the
Cardinal to 2.6 yards per rushing attempt. The Bears repeatedly
stuffed Stanford's shotgun draws and other runs up the middle, as if
they knew what was coming.
Stanford ran the ball to open nine of its first 11 possessions, in
cluding four straight during a scoreless third quarter.
By the time Stanford turned to the pass, it was too little, too late.
Teevens pulled Lewis in favor of freshman Trent Edwards, whose
first pass was intercepted. On the Cardinal's next possession it
faced fourth-and-four from the Cal 30-yard line with 8:59 to play.
Edwards and Powell miscommunicated on a route, and Edward's
pass sailed up the right sideline after Powell had cut back on a short
route. To add injury to insult, Edwards was hit after completing a
short pass on Stanford's next possession, and had to leave the
game.
For Stanford, it was that kind of game — frustrating and fruitless.
"We just didn't take advantage," Teevens said. "I don't have a
complete answer."
