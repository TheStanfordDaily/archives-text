# Men's hoops avoids Hornets'. sting in opener
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 20 Stanford men's basketball
team (1-0) survived its first test of the season
on Saturday night. The Cardinal picked up a
77-59 victory over an athletic Sacramento
State team.
And Stanford did it without the services of
junior swingman Josh Childress who was
sidelined with a stress reaction — the precur
sor to a stress fracture — to his left foot. Ju
nior forward Nick Robinson started in his
place.
For those who thought the season would
be without its ups-and-downs, Saturday's
opener should be proof enough that things
aren't going to be as smooth as many would

have hoped.
"When the pain goes away, he'll play,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said
of Childress' foot injury. "There's no magic
formula. It just doesn't make any sense to
push it... I probably shouldn't have played
him last week [in the exhibition game.]"
Childress will receive a special orthodic on
Monday, which doctors hope will redistribute
some of the stress on his foot. Whether or not
he'll play Tuesday night against UC-Irvine
hasn't been determined.
Despite the sidelining of Childress, there
remains somewhat of a silver lining.
"The positive thing is that we had our star
player out and we played well against a strong
Sacramento State team," senior shooting
guard Matt Lottich said. "Some guys came off

the bench and really played well."
Despite Childress' absence, the frontcourt
still appeared strong. Stanford showed its
depth at the post-position with contributions
from senior forward Justin Davis, sophomore
Matt Haryasz and junior center Rob Little.
The trio combined for 39 of the team's 77
points. Davis led all Stanford scorers and re
bounders with 17 points and 10 boards after
going 5-for-7 from the field and 7-for-10 from
the free-throw line.
Haryasz posted career-highs in both
points (10) and rebounds (7) and little scored
12 points and pulled down seven boards.
The Hornets proved to be a bigger threat
than the Cardinal originally anticipated.
