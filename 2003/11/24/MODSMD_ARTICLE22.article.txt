# Men's hoops avoids Hornets'. sting in opener
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 20 Stanford men's basketball
team (1-0) survived its first test of the season
on Saturday night. The Cardinal picked up a
77-59 victory over an athletic Sacramento
State team.
And Stanford did it without the services of
junior swingman Josh Childress who was
sidelined with a stress reaction — the precur
sor to a stress fracture — to his left foot. Ju
nior forward Nick Robinson started in his
place.
For those who thought the season would
be without its ups-and-downs, Saturday's
opener should be proof enough that things
aren't going to be as smooth as many would

have hoped.
"When the pain goes away, he'll play,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said
of Childress' foot injury. "There's no magic
formula. It just doesn't make any sense to
push it... I probably shouldn't have played
him last week [in the exhibition game.]"
Childress will receive a special orthodic on
Monday, which doctors hope will redistribute
some of the stress on his foot. Whether or not
he'll play Tuesday night against UC-Irvine
hasn't been determined.
Despite the sidelining of Childress, there
remains somewhat of a silver lining.
"The positive thing is that we had our star
player out and we played well against a strong
Sacramento State team," senior shooting
guard Matt Lottich said. "Some guys came off

the bench and really played well."
Despite Childress' absence, the frontcourt
still appeared strong. Stanford showed its
depth at the post-position with contributions
from senior forward Justin Davis, sophomore
Matt Haryasz and junior center Rob Little.
The trio combined for 39 of the team's 77
points. Davis led all Stanford scorers and re
bounders with 17 points and 10 boards after
going 5-for-7 from the field and 7-for-10 from
the free-throw line.
Haryasz posted career-highs in both
points (10) and rebounds (7) and little scored
12 points and pulled down seven boards.
The Hornets proved to be a bigger threat
than the Cardinal originally anticipated.

Junior center Rob Little throws down two of his 12 points in Saturday's 77-59 victory over Sacramento
State at Maples Pavilion. No. 20 Stanford takes on UC-lrvine this Tuesday.
Sacramento hung around with
Stanford for the opening 10 minutes of
play when Little scored in the post,
bringing the score to 19-15 in favor of
the Cardinal. Little's basket started a
20-4 Stanford run that spanned seven
minutes. During the run, Sacramento
State guard Joseth Dawson hit a jump
shot just under the seven-minute
mark, bringing the score to 31-19. The
Hornets were held scoreless for al
most three minutes until forward
Jameel Pugh, the team's leading scor
er on the night, hit a three-pointer to
bring the team out of its drought. The
Hornets jogged into the locker room
down by only 14 points, the score at
41-27, despite being out-rebounded
23-11 and shooting 35 percent from
the field.
Stanford also struggled throughout
the half. The Cardinal committed 10
turnovers after Sacramento State
opened the game unexpectedly with a
full-court 2-1-2 zone press. While many
of Stanford's turnovers were unforced,
the press certainly disrupted its offen
sive rhythm.
The Hornets' disruption contin
ued late into the second half, after the
Cardinal appeared to have put the
game away. With Stanford ahead by
20 at one point during the first half,
Sacramento State methodically
began to chip away at the lead. A
three-pointer from Hornet guard Joel
Jones at the 12-minute mark capped a
14-6 Sacramento State run over a
seven minute stretch that saw six Car
dinal turnovers, bringing the Hornets
back within six points of Stanford, 49-
43.
"We need to turn the ball over less,"
Little said. "We [also] need to work on
sustaining our leads because when we
get up against better competition, we
can't let teams creep back in the game
like Sacramento State did."
Luckily for Stanford, six points was
as close as the Hornets would come.
After fighting its way back, Sacramen
to State went cold offensively, manag
ing only one basket in the next three
minutes after the Cardinal switched to
its 1-1-3 zone defensively.
Moreover, Stanford seemed to re
discover its offensive rhythm during
the stretch — a 12-4 run. As the Hor
nets missed shot after shot on their of
fensive end, the Cardinal capitalized on
easy scoring opportunities putting in
layup after layup, after free throw, after
slairt dunk. Stanford stretched its lead
to 14 when Little found a cutting
Robinson for an easy slam dunk. Two
plays later, Haryasz scored on a jump
shot extending Stanford's lead to 17.
"[The win's] a nice start," Mont
gomery said. "[Sacramento State head
coach Jerome Jenkins has] got them
playing really hard and aggressive."
Stanford will travel to southern Cal
ifornia to face UC-Irvine on Tuesday
evening at 7:05 p.m.
