# Stanford turnovers keep Sacramento St. in game
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On four separate occasions in Stanford's 77-59 win over
Sacramento State, the Cardinal committed turnovers on
back-to-back possessions. Though the team was pleased to
win, the players know they won't be able to afford so many
mistakes come January, when tough opponents will convert
such opportunities into scoring runs.
"As they changed up their defense, I thought we got a lit
tle bit sloppy," junior forward Nick Robinson said.
Visibly overmatched in both size and shooting ability,
Sacramento State worked hard on defense to harass the Car
dinal into making poor decisions â€” 20 of which led to
turnovers.
"What they were trying to do is disrupt the game," Stan
ford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "Their pressure
gets you out of sorts a little bit, but gets you some good shots."
The good shots came whenever Stanford's perimeter
players managed to extricate themselves from the Hornets'
frequent traps and double-teams. But that didn't happen
quite often enough against a team that has failed to post a
winning record since moving up to Division I in 1991.
Montgomery was far less bothered by Sacramento State's six
steals and one block than by the Cardinal's other 13 giveaways.
"We turned the ball over too much," Montgomery said.
"We made unforced errors, mistakes from not really reacting
well to the pressure."
Montgomery was referring to the plays where the Hor
nets' half-court and full-court pressure left sophomore

guards Chris Hernandez and Jason Haas and senior forward
Justin Davis looking uncertain of what to do with the ball.
Many of the trio's 13 turnovers were the type of mistakes that
have cost Stanford in the past against high-pressure teams
like Southern California.
But that doesn't mean the team is doomed to a season full
of ball-handling bloopers. Montgomery attributed many of
the mishaps to the team's lack of practice against the type of
defense Sacramento State employed.
"I did not prepare them much for the half-court trap or the
2-1-2 zone, and that caused us some problems," Montgomery
said.
Montgomery also said he didn't think Hernandez would
continue to commit as many turnovers once he gets re-accus
tomed to the pace and intensity of game situations.
"Chris was a little nervous I thought at times," Mont
gomery said. "He hasn't practiced very much, and he hasn't
played in a while."
The game was Hernandez's first action since Dec. 17,
2002, when the Cardinal lost to Montana 70-68. He was
granted a medical redshirt last year after missing most of the
season with a broken left foot. Montgomery has said that he
thinks Hernandez could be a steadying influence and key
ball-handler as the starting point guard if he stays healthy this
season.
Robinson said he isn't worried about the team's ability to
handle pressure as the season progresses.
"I don't think that will be a big problem this year, because
we've got a number of guards that are able to handle the
ball," Robinson said.
