# Water polo upholds Stanford honor
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team dampened
the spirits of No. 3 Cal (19-6) with a 5-3 victory in Satur
day morning's Big Splash. Giving Stanford fans a much
needed treat, the Cardinal men dominated offensively
and defensively in the pool.
Stanford finished league play 8-1, extending its win
ning streak to 11 games and bringing the team's record to
19-3 overall for the season.
"Big Splash is always awesome," said junior two
meter Greg Crum. "You can't describe it. It's the best
college game in the nation by far."
More than 2,100 people attended the match before
Big Game at the Avery Aquatic Center. Unlike Big
Game, however, Cardinal spectators left with much to
celebrate, as Stanford won its first-ever Big Splash held
at Avery.
"It felt great to beat them in our home pool," said
sophomore goalie Chad Taylor. "It was also great to get
the win for all the fans that showed up to support us. We
can't thank them enough for their continuing support."
The game marked senior utility Mike Derse's final
home match in season play.
"Every time we play Cal it's an amazing game, Big
Splash especially," Derse said. "I couldn't think of a bet
ter way for us to go off, for me to go off, than winning Big
Splash."
Before the game, there was a brief ceremony for
Derse, honoring him for his contributions to the team
and highlighting his scholastics accomplishments as well.
A mechanical engineering major, he has one of the high
est GPAs on the team.
The real entertainment, however, came from the solid
defensive play in the pool from every man on the Cardi
nal squad, especially Taylor. Taylor notched a career
high 12 saves and set the tone for the entire game with his
aggressive and effective defense.
"Chad Taylor played just a great game," Crum said.
"And he always plays a great game in big games. So we're
starting to come to expect that from Chad, we're not sur
prised."
The Bears repeatedly took hard shots at Taylor, but
he put his entire body into defending the goal and denied
the Cal attacks.
"We only gave [Cal] three goals," Crum said. "The de
fense was unbelievable."
Taylor credits the defensive effort to the entire team,
noting that the team as a whole worked to stop or prevent
many possible shots on goal.
"Our defense played better yesterday than we have all
year," Taylor said. "As for this game, Cal could not get
very many good looks at the cage because the defense

was playing so well."
Throughout the season, the Cardinal has been work
ing to improve its defensive play and it showed on Satur
day.
"The defense has improved immensely," Taylor said.
"We now pride ourselves on it and make it a focal point
for ourselves during the games. Our offense will always
come because of the level of talent we have in the pool,
but it is our defense that will win us games in the post sea
son."
Stanford scored four of its five goals in the second pe
riod. Five players—juniors Tony Azevedo, Sam Tyre

and Crum, and sophomores Peter Varellas and Thomas
Hopkins — accounted for the Cardinal scoring. Azeve
do scored on a penalty shot with 22 seconds remaining in
the second period.
"Our main focus is always defense and if we can
get up by four goals like we did then we don't have
to worry about our offense," Crum said. "We're al
ways playing to win, always playing to score goals —
but when you get by four goals, there's no need to
push it that hard anymore, even though we're al
ways trying to counter and score goals. The way
Chad was playing today, it didn't seem like we real

ly needed to."
Stanford and Cal are traditionally two of the
best team's in collegiate water polo. Cal has 11
NCAA titles and Stanford is a close second with 10,
including championships the past two seasons. If
both teams do well in the MPSF Tournament in
Malibu, Calif, next weekend, it's possible they may
meet again in the MPSF and possibly the NCAA fi
nals.
"I think that everything is coming together now and
we are peaking at the right time during the season," Tay
lor said.
