# Card loses the battle, Daily wins the war
## 
### FAKE WRITER DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES IN A BUNCH 
The real prelude to the 106th Big Game was
not Big Splash, but the Ink Bowl, the annual flag
football game between The Stanford Daily and
The Daily Californian. Stanford regained con
trol of the coveted Exacto Knife "trophy" with a
dominating 42-0 victory at Roble Field on Satur
day.
The start of the game was delayed for more
than an hour because the Daily Cal staff couldn't
find Roble Field, despite the fact that the Ink
Bowl has been played there every other year
since 1971.
"Yeah, The Daily forwarded us a map and ev
erything just in case, but reading isn't something
we stand for at this paper," said one Daily Cal
staffer, who acknowledged that Roble Field isn't
exactly the most inconspicuous plot of land on
campus.
"Yeah, reading is fundamental," she later
said. "I guess all the people playing football
should have tipped us off. That and the big thing
on the map labeled ROBLE IS HERE," or
Row-bowl, as she pronounced it. Over and over
and over again.
In the game, The Daily proved that the Fun
'n'-Gun is not in fact dead on the Farm, with an
aerial assault that left a depleted Daily Cal squad
wishing Trent Edwards were quarterbacking
The Daily. Or Chris Lewis. Or Kyle Matter. Or
Ryan Eklund for that matter. They all rock, ac
cording to Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens.
"See," said Daily Managing Sports Editor Ar
isha Hatch, who coached belligerently from the
sideline, "It's not that fucking hard. Throw the
damn ball. I may not have held a clipboard as the
assistant to the assistant offensive coordinator of
holders and snappers at Florida, but I know that
much."
Daily Cal Editor-in-Chief, who may or may
not have actually been at the game, had nothing
but positive tilings to say about his offense's in
ability to move the ball.
"We played a solid game and showed great
signs of improvement," said the dude. "I think we
improved a lot as a football team out there today,

showed a lot of heart and all that crap. It's a
shame we only play one game a year and have to
wait 'til next year to show it."
"There are two sides to every story, but only
one truth," responded Daily Editor-in-Chief
Ramin Setoodeh, pointing out that he's Middle
Eastern. "The truth today is The Daily Cal sucks.
Big time."
As previously stated, The Stanford Daily will
continue to run the ads.
In other news, Daily Columnist and Stanford
men's soccer walk-on Spencer Porter actually
got some playing time on Saturday. Then again,
he was competing for minutes against Managing
Photo Editor Lindsay Coleman, who, if nothing
else, looked cute in her striped knee socks.
Many Daily staffers were surprised that
Porter could actually punt the ball.
"Yeah man, I was really surprised," said
men's soccer beat writer Jessica Peters. "I
thought he just made the team by kissing ass. I
mean, that's how I got my job."
Daily Columnist Scott Allen left the game
sickened after watching the first two series from
the sidelines, inexplicably benched for non-Daily
writers.
"I feel like Keyshawn Johnson," Allen said.
"I'm the best damn player on this whole team
and they deactivate me. Are you shitting me? I'm
gone. Tell Steve Spurrier I'm in Washington
looking for apartments."
Despite Stanford's dominating victory in the
football game, The Daily could not defend its
title as boat race champions.
Daily Managing News Editor Mark Thoma,
who single-handedly nearly lost last year's boat
race for the Cardinal, was benched Saturday in
favor of EBF Social Manager / Daily "Staff De
velopment Coordinator" Eric Eldon.
"I've got a lot of leadership experience," said
Eldon, who's known throughout EBF for his
"special" brownies.
"We thought Eldon's EBF happy-hour expe
rience would be a strong addition to the Stanford
boat race team," said Daily Business Manager
Ezra Callahan. "We were wrong. Dead wrong."
Not even Daily-daily-drunk Jen Graham
could overcome the hole that Eldon dug The

Daily as the leadoff drinker in the post-game
tradition.
Graham, who hasn't written a story in ages,
showed no regard for NCAA uniform regula
tions and sported a stylish tank top strategically
cut to reveal her womanly assets.
Later, Graham imitated a rap video as she
sprayed beer vicariously over her self-made
Cal-beater. Graham had two catches for -12
yards, but played menacing defense and talked
serious shut, including a chant of "Cir-cul
ation!" to the crowd of 95-year-old Cal Alum
ni. Graham was quickly notified by Callahan

that The Daily Cal has a larger circulation than
Stanford, to which Graham responded witting
ly, "Who's your daddy?"
"Nice ti-... umm... hits out there, Jen," said
Senior Staff Writer Will Oremus, who played the
entire game with a beer in his hand. Oremus, who
later ran off into the bushes, avoided any serious
injuries for the first time in his Ink Bowl career.
He did, however, run into his own "teammate,"
Friends of The Daily President Charlie Hoff
man's "hot" son.
"He was so hot," Graham said drunkenly. "I
wish he actually worked for The Daily."

gone. Tell Steve Spurrier I'm in Washington
looking for apartments."
Despite Stanford's dominating victory in the
football game, The Daily could not defend its
title as boat race champions.
Daily Managing News Editor Mark Thoma,
who single-handedly nearly lost last year's boat
race for the Cardinal, was benched Saturday in
favor of EBF Social Manager / Daily "Staff De
velopment Coordinator" Eric Eldon.
"I've got a lot of leadership experience," said
Eldon, who's known throughout EBF for his
"special" brownies.
"We thought Eldon's EBF happy-hour expe
rience would be a strong addition to the Stanford
boat race team," said Daily Business Manager
Ezra Callahan. "We were wrong. Dead wrong."
Not even Daily-daily-drunk Jen Graham
could overcome the hole that Eldon dug The

Daily as the leadoff drinker in the post-game
tradition.
Graham, who hasn't written a story in ages,
showed no regard for NCAA uniform regula
tions and sported a stylish tank top strategically
cut to reveal her womanly assets.
Later, Graham imitated a rap video as she
sprayed beer vicariously over her self-made
Cal-beater. Graham had two catches for -12
yards, but played menacing defense and talked
serious shut, including a chant of "Cir-cul
ation!" to the crowd of 95-year-old Cal Alum
ni. Graham was quickly notified by Callahan

that The Daily Cal has a larger circulation than
Stanford, to which Graham responded witting
ly, "Who's your daddy?"
"Nice ti-... umm... hits out there, Jen," said
Senior Staff Writer Will Oremus, who played the
entire game with a beer in his hand. Oremus, who
later ran off into the bushes, avoided any serious
injuries for the first time in his Ink Bowl career.
He did, however, run into his own "teammate,"
Friends of The Daily President Charlie Hoff
man's "hot" son.
"He was so hot," Graham said drunkenly. "I
wish he actually worked for The Daily."

Former Daily staff member Jen Graham warms up for the boat race after Saturday's Ink Bowl,
which The Daily won 42-0. Daily Business Manager Ezra Callahan was peeved that Jen let so
much beer go to waste. "It's like advertising in the Daily/' Callahan said.
The real prelude to the 106th Big Game was
not Big Splash, but the Ink Bowl, the annual flag
football game between The Stanford Daily and
The Daily Californian. Stanford regained con
trol of the coveted Exacto Knife "trophy" with a
dominating 42-0 victory at Roble Field on Satur
day.
The start of the game was delayed for more
than an hour because the Daily Cal staff couldn't
find Roble Field, despite the fact that the Ink
Bowl has been played there every other year
since 1971.
"Yeah, The Daily forwarded us a map and ev
erything just in case, but reading isn't something
we stand for at this paper," said one Daily Cal
staffer, who acknowledged that Roble Field isn't
exactly the most inconspicuous plot of land on
campus.
"Yeah, reading is fundamental," she later
said. "I guess all the people playing football
should have tipped us off. That and the big thing
on the map labeled ROBLE IS HERE," or
Row-bowl, as she pronounced it. Over and over
and over again.
In the game, The Daily proved that the Fun
'n'-Gun is not in fact dead on the Farm, with an
aerial assault that left a depleted Daily Cal squad
wishing Trent Edwards were quarterbacking
The Daily. Or Chris Lewis. Or Kyle Matter. Or
Ryan Eklund for that matter. They all rock, ac
cording to Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens.
"See," said Daily Managing Sports Editor Ar
isha Hatch, who coached belligerently from the
sideline, "It's not that fucking hard. Throw the
damn ball. I may not have held a clipboard as the
assistant to the assistant offensive coordinator of
holders and snappers at Florida, but I know that
much."
Daily Cal Editor-in-Chief, who may or may
not have actually been at the game, had nothing
but positive tilings to say about his offense's in
ability to move the ball.
"We played a solid game and showed great
signs of improvement," said the dude. "I think we
improved a lot as a football team out there today,

showed a lot of heart and all that crap. It's a
shame we only play one game a year and have to
wait 'til next year to show it."
"There are two sides to every story, but only
one truth," responded Daily Editor-in-Chief
Ramin Setoodeh, pointing out that he's Middle
Eastern. "The truth today is The Daily Cal sucks.
Big time."
As previously stated, The Stanford Daily will
continue to run the ads.
In other news, Daily Columnist and Stanford
men's soccer walk-on Spencer Porter actually
got some playing time on Saturday. Then again,
he was competing for minutes against Managing
Photo Editor Lindsay Coleman, who, if nothing
else, looked cute in her striped knee socks.
Many Daily staffers were surprised that
Porter could actually punt the ball.
"Yeah man, I was really surprised," said
men's soccer beat writer Jessica Peters. "I
thought he just made the team by kissing ass. I
mean, that's how I got my job."
Daily Columnist Scott Allen left the game
sickened after watching the first two series from
the sidelines, inexplicably benched for non-Daily
writers.
"I feel like Keyshawn Johnson," Allen said.
"I'm the best damn player on this whole team
and they deactivate me. Are you shitting me? I'm
gone. Tell Steve Spurrier I'm in Washington
looking for apartments."
