# Women open season with two wins
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford senior forward Nicole
Powell was named to just about
every 2003 preseason All-America
Team — Street & Smith, Associated
Press, Kodak — they all picked her.
In No. 6 Stanford's first two games,
she showed the world — and attend
ing WNBA scouts — why.
On Friday night, Powell led Stan
ford (2-0) to a 69-61 come-from-be
hind victory over Pepperdine (0-1)
in Malibu, Calif, recording game
highs in points (28) and rebounds
(12). The versatile forward added
three steals for good measure.
In Sunday afternoon's home
opener, the Cardinal cruised to a 79-
53 win over Fordham (1-1), with
Powell dropping 20 points and
pulling down nine rebounds.
A young Pepperdine squad pro
vided a surprisingly tough test for
the Cardinal Friday night, playing
inspired and relaxed in front of their
home crowd.
The Waves were able to keep the
game close in the first half, mostly
due to poor Cardinal shooting.
Stanford hit just 30 percent of its
field goals in the first half, on 9-for
30 shooting, while clinging to a 27-25
lead. Powell, who did not start, had
just eight points at the half.
Pepperdine knocked down its
first four shots of the second half to
take a four-point lead, 36-32.
Midway through the second half,
with the score tied 41-41, Powell and
the Cardinal went on a scoring
binge, outscoring the Waves 20-5.
Powell capped off the six minute run
with a three-pointer and finished
with 20 points in the second half.
"I had the same opportunities in the
first half as I had in the second half,"
Powell said. "I just tried to attack
more. I needed to take it to the rim."
Powell was not the only Cardinal
to find her stroke in the second half
as the team shot 57.7 percent from
the field on 15-for-26 shooting.

Sunday's matchup with Fordham
began much as Friday's contest did
with turnovers and poor shooting.
The heavily favored Cardinal played
from behind until a Kristen Newlin
free throw with 13:58 remaining in
the half gave the Cardinal its first
lead.
"They were trying to recognize
what to do [against the Rams' 3-2
zone]," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We tried out a
couple little things and some worked
and some didn't work. We came out
with a little trap-and-press and that
got us going a little bit."
The Cardinal never looked back
after Newlin's free throw gave them
the lead, following a run fueled by
none other than Powell, who fin
ished the half with 13 points. Newlin
was not far behind, tallying 12 points
and four boards in the half as Stan
ford headed into the locker-room
with a 39-25 lead.
"I thought Kristen ran really well
[in our transition offense]," Van-
Derveer said. "I think this game re
ally helped her confidence."
In addition to her success on of
fense, Newlin put in good work on
the defensive end as well. She had
two blocks and forced the Rams to
think twice before heading into the
paint.
Stanford avoided a second con
secutive sluggish start after the
break, going on a 13-4 run over the
first six minutes to take a 52-29 lead.
With the Cardinal holding a com
fortable lead, Powell finally took a
rest after playing all 20 minutes of
the first half.
For the length of the game, the
Cardinal played tough perimeter de
fense, holding senior guard Beth
Ann Dickinson, Fordham's leading
scorer, to 13 points on 4-for-14
shooting.
Individually, Stanford also got
strong performances from guards
Susan Borchardt and Krista Rappa
hahn, who each reached double fig
ures in scoring with 11 and 10 points,

respectively.
Rappahahn's afternoon was par
ticularly encouraging for the Cardi
nal, which has a short bench due to
injury.
"Krista coming in and playing so
well really helped her confidence,"
VanDerveer said. "I do have in the
back of my mind that I want to get a
deeper rotation going, but it's hard
to sit Nicole, Kelley [Suminski] and
Seb [Kimyacioglu]."

Forwards T'Nae Thiel and Azella
Perryman, both significant contribu
tors last season, are on the bench
with respective foot and ankle in
juries.
While the Cardinal came away
with a blowout win, VanDerveer
saw room for improvement in sever
al areas.
"Our rebounding needs to be
much better," she said. "I wasn't
happy with our half-court offense, in

terms of execution. I think it's some
thing we've done really well with in
practice, so it's not something I'm
worried about."
Stanford was out-rebounded in
both of the weekend's contests.
The Cardinal won't be resting
over Thanksgiving with three games
over the course of the week. It faces
San Francisco Tuesday night,
Boston on Friday and No. 11 Geor
gia on Sunday.

In addition to her success on of
fense, Newlin put in good work on
the defensive end as well. She had
two blocks and forced the Rams to
think twice before heading into the
paint.
Stanford avoided a second con
secutive sluggish start after the
break, going on a 13-4 run over the
first six minutes to take a 52-29 lead.
With the Cardinal holding a com
fortable lead, Powell finally took a
rest after playing all 20 minutes of
the first half.
For the length of the game, the
Cardinal played tough perimeter de
fense, holding senior guard Beth
Ann Dickinson, Fordham's leading
scorer, to 13 points on 4-for-14
shooting.
Individually, Stanford also got
strong performances from guards
Susan Borchardt and Krista Rappa
hahn, who each reached double fig
ures in scoring with 11 and 10 points,

respectively.
Rappahahn's afternoon was par
ticularly encouraging for the Cardi
nal, which has a short bench due to
injury.
"Krista coming in and playing so
well really helped her confidence,"
VanDerveer said. "I do have in the
back of my mind that I want to get a
deeper rotation going, but it's hard
to sit Nicole, Kelley [Suminski] and
Seb [Kimyacioglu]."

Forwards T'Nae Thiel and Azella
Perryman, both significant contribu
tors last season, are on the bench
with respective foot and ankle in
juries.
While the Cardinal came away
with a blowout win, VanDerveer
saw room for improvement in sever
al areas.
"Our rebounding needs to be
much better," she said. "I wasn't
happy with our half-court offense, in

terms of execution. I think it's some
thing we've done really well with in
practice, so it's not something I'm
worried about."
Stanford was out-rebounded in
both of the weekend's contests.
The Cardinal won't be resting
over Thanksgiving with three games
over the course of the week. It faces
San Francisco Tuesday night,
Boston on Friday and No. 11 Geor
gia on Sunday.

Stanford junior guard Kelley Suminski pushes the ball up the court against Fordham on Sunday at Maples Pavilion.
The No. 6 Cardinal won the game 79-53 and defeated Pepperdine 69-61 in Malibu, Calif, on Friday.
Stanford senior forward Nicole
Powell was named to just about
every 2003 preseason All-America
Team — Street & Smith, Associated
Press, Kodak — they all picked her.
In No. 6 Stanford's first two games,
she showed the world — and attend
ing WNBA scouts — why.
On Friday night, Powell led Stan
ford (2-0) to a 69-61 come-from-be
hind victory over Pepperdine (0-1)
in Malibu, Calif, recording game
highs in points (28) and rebounds
(12). The versatile forward added
three steals for good measure.
In Sunday afternoon's home
opener, the Cardinal cruised to a 79-
53 win over Fordham (1-1), with
Powell dropping 20 points and
pulling down nine rebounds.
A young Pepperdine squad pro
vided a surprisingly tough test for
the Cardinal Friday night, playing
inspired and relaxed in front of their
home crowd.
The Waves were able to keep the
game close in the first half, mostly
due to poor Cardinal shooting.
Stanford hit just 30 percent of its
field goals in the first half, on 9-for
30 shooting, while clinging to a 27-25
lead. Powell, who did not start, had
just eight points at the half.
Pepperdine knocked down its
first four shots of the second half to
take a four-point lead, 36-32.
Midway through the second half,
with the score tied 41-41, Powell and
the Cardinal went on a scoring
binge, outscoring the Waves 20-5.
Powell capped off the six minute run
with a three-pointer and finished
with 20 points in the second half.
"I had the same opportunities in the
first half as I had in the second half,"
Powell said. "I just tried to attack
more. I needed to take it to the rim."
Powell was not the only Cardinal
to find her stroke in the second half
as the team shot 57.7 percent from
the field on 15-for-26 shooting.

Sunday's matchup with Fordham
began much as Friday's contest did
with turnovers and poor shooting.
The heavily favored Cardinal played
from behind until a Kristen Newlin
free throw with 13:58 remaining in
the half gave the Cardinal its first
lead.
"They were trying to recognize
what to do [against the Rams' 3-2
zone]," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We tried out a
couple little things and some worked
and some didn't work. We came out
with a little trap-and-press and that
got us going a little bit."
The Cardinal never looked back
after Newlin's free throw gave them
the lead, following a run fueled by
none other than Powell, who fin
ished the half with 13 points. Newlin
was not far behind, tallying 12 points
and four boards in the half as Stan
ford headed into the locker-room
with a 39-25 lead.
"I thought Kristen ran really well
[in our transition offense]," Van-
Derveer said. "I think this game re
ally helped her confidence."
In addition to her success on of
fense, Newlin put in good work on
the defensive end as well. She had
two blocks and forced the Rams to
think twice before heading into the
paint.
Stanford avoided a second con
secutive sluggish start after the
break, going on a 13-4 run over the
first six minutes to take a 52-29 lead.
