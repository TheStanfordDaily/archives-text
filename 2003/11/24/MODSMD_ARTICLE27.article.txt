### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The costume of the Stanford
Tree was recovered early Friday
morning from UC-Berkeley stu
dents. The Cal students were
originally asking for a $300 ran
som payment, according to cur
rent Tree, junior William
Rothacker, Jr.
After learning of the Tree cos
tume theft, the Cal Band manag
er sent out an e-mail telling stu
dents to return the Tree before
Big Game or face possible legal
action from the Stanford Band.
At around midnight on Friday,
the Cal students sent an anony
mous ransom note to the Cal
Band manager, who forwarded it
to the Stanford Band manager.
The note specified a return of
the costume for a payment of
$300 to be delivered to the stu
dents at the sports store between
4 a.m. and 4:30 a.m. on Friday
morning. Rothacker was with
three past Trees, junior Andrew
Parker, senior Chuck Armstrong
and Evan Meagher, Class of
2001, when he learned of the ran
som note from the Band manag
er.
After the Gaieties rally on Fri
day night, three former Trees
and this year's Tree got together
to make a new Tree, which they
worked on until 9:30 a.m. on Sat
urday morning. The old Tree cos
tume was shredded in a wood
chipper during Big Game, as Cal
had tainted it, Rothacker said.
It is still unclear who exactly
stole the costume, since the iden
tities of the Cal students were not
revealed. But Rothacker sus
pects it was the Cal Rally Com
mittee.
