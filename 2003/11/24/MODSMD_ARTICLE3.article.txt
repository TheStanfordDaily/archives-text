# Free laundry weekend brings long lines
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ 
Residents of certain campus
residences saved money at this
weekend's Free Wash Weekend,
but long lines and overcrowded
laundry rooms left a bitter taste in
some students' mouths.
Washers and driers were free
from Saturday to Sunday, in an
event sponsored by Coinmatch,
the University's laundry service
vendor. Its intent was to offer stu
dents an opportunity to learn
about the equipment — several
Coinmatch representatives were
available to answer laundry-relat
ed questions — and to thank resi
dents for using Coinmatch ser
vices, according to Imogen Hinds,
manager of Undergraduate Hous
ing Operations.
Many students said they were
frustrated with the event because
it led to busy, crowded laundry

rooms. They said the time needed
to wash and dry clothes, in some
cases double the usual amount,
overshadowed the money saved.

"It was not worth it because of
the long lines," Cassanego said.
"I'd rather pay the five bucks and
have my laundry done without the
hassle. Overall, I don't think this
idea worked out."

Some students were surprised
at the large student turnout.
"You think that somehow peo
ple won't read their e-mail or will
forget that the event is even going
on," sophomore Eric Mayefsky
said. "Then you walk to the laun
dry room on a Saturday night and
find a line of students overcrowd
ing the laundry room."

Some students, such as fresh
man Stacey King, speculated that
the service was a test run for a

Over the weekend, students flocked to laundry rooms on campus to take advantage
of the free washing and drying offered by Coinmatch.
