# Free laundry weekend brings long lines
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ 
Residents of certain campus
residences saved money at this
weekend's Free Wash Weekend,
but long lines and overcrowded
laundry rooms left a bitter taste in
some students' mouths.
Washers and driers were free
from Saturday to Sunday, in an
event sponsored by Coinmatch,
the University's laundry service
vendor. Its intent was to offer stu
dents an opportunity to learn
about the equipment — several
Coinmatch representatives were
available to answer laundry-relat
ed questions — and to thank resi
dents for using Coinmatch ser
vices, according to Imogen Hinds,
manager of Undergraduate Hous
ing Operations.
Many students said they were
frustrated with the event because
it led to busy, crowded laundry

rooms. They said the time needed
to wash and dry clothes, in some
cases double the usual amount,
overshadowed the money saved.

"It was not worth it because of
the long lines," Cassanego said.
"I'd rather pay the five bucks and
have my laundry done without the
hassle. Overall, I don't think this
idea worked out."

Some students were surprised
at the large student turnout.
"You think that somehow peo
ple won't read their e-mail or will
forget that the event is even going
on," sophomore Eric Mayefsky
said. "Then you walk to the laun
dry room on a Saturday night and
find a line of students overcrowd
ing the laundry room."

Some students, such as fresh
man Stacey King, speculated that
the service was a test run for a

year-round free wash policy.
"I think they were just doing us a
service, but I wish it was free all the
time," King said. "Washing at this
school is a big hassle, and maybe they
were just trying to see what the stu
dent response was to free laundry
services."
Freshman Tony Cassanego was
also upset that students normally
have to pay for laundry service.
"It's a rip-off," he said. "$40,000 in
tuition each year should be enough to
cover laundry."
Some who were unable to take ad
vantage of the event, such as gradu
ate students and senior Carter Mor
ris, who lives off campus, said they
wished they could have participated.
"As a student athlete, I usually
have a lot of dirty laundry," Morris
said. "When I was on campus, laun
dry was really expensive. If they had
put this event on a few years ago, I
would have been able to save a lot of
money."
Many students said they thought
the weekend was related to the "Just
Like Home" program for year-round
wash at a flat rate that was supposed
to take effect this fall. But Hinds said
these events have no relation to one
another, although ASSU continues
to assess that proposition.
Next week, the ASSU will conduct
focus groups and online surveys to gain
more resident feedback on the "Just
Like Home" program, Hinds said.
The likelihood of another Free
Wash Weekend will be based upon
whether or not administrators feel it
was successful, Hinds explained.
"This event was the first and only
of the academic year," she said. "We
still have to decide whether or not we
will offer it next year."
