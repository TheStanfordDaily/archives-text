# Teach-in focuses on U.S. foreign policy

### FARIS MOHIUDDIN 
Questioning the official motives for
intervention in the Middle East, the Stan
ford Community for Peace and Justice
Teach In brought forth the first open
campus dialogue on U.S. foreign policy in
that region, according to History Prof.
Joel Beinin.
Speakers at the event, which took
place Friday in the History Comer, high
lighted different aspects of American
conduct and brainstormed steps that citi
zens can take to affect policy.
In his keynote address, Beinin spoke
about the Bush Doctrine, a measure that
justifies preemptive war, and the failure
of U.S. policy in Iraq. Rather than isolat
ing current U.S. policy as an anomaly,
Beinin said the Bush Doctrine is the
manifestation of a broader agenda for
American dominance set forth more
than a decade ago. Beinin said the obsta
cles inherent in Iraqi society will make a
democratic conversion difficult, if not
impossible.
"He presented a good case about the
reasoning behind policy," freshman Jen
Haskell said. "Though it was mainly one
sided, it was persuasive because it seemed
objective in that it rested on a clear chain
of facts and events."
After the keynote address, the partic
ipants broke up into workshop sections
that dealt with specific issues. Engineer
ing graduate student Eugene Fratlon pre
sented a slide show and narrative re
counting his experience in a battalion in
the Middle East, showing the audience
the human side of fighting in a war and
the events and emotions that accompany
it. Rather than focusing on gore or bru
tality, Fratkin emphasized the day-to-day
activities that defined his time serving
abroad during the war.
"It's not very eye-opening to many
people here, because they are already
well-informed but it educates others
about my way of life," Fratkin said.
Fratkin said the Peace and Justice
Teach Ins will eventually cover less
prominent issues to foster a greater sense

of awareness and activism on campus.
"Though we hope to later discuss is
sues like the Patriot Act, all teach-ins are
similar in that they incorporate both the
personal and analytic nature of under
standing foreign policy," said freshman
Laura Bloomfield, a Stanford Peace and
Justice member.
The director of the Peninsula Peace
and Justice Center, Paul George, led a
workshop discussing what he called the
"Bush propaganda model."
Summingup his position, George said
that the government lied.
More specifically, he argued that both
historically and currently, the govern
ment has used fear to mask the truth
about foreign policy goals. George ex

plained how the mere perception of an
enemy could be enough to gamer the
support of the American people.
"It is extremely important to get be
yond the headlines of the news for deep
er analysis," George said. "These Teach
Ins are perfect for a university environ
ment, but sometimes people don't know
where to look to have an open forum for
discussing important issues."
Political Science Prof. David Aber
nethy led a workshop of American
power and influence abroad. The work
shop dealt with issues of American inter
vention and nation building and what
that means about the United State's for
eign policy agenda for the future.
Senior Lecturer in Linguistics, Khalil

Barhoum, led a discussion on the Arab
perception of U.S. foreign policy in the
Middle East. Barhoum showed videos
to supplement his take on the various
outlooks present among the Middle
Eastern populace regarding the United
States. The workshop illustrated con
nections between U.S. policy changes
and subsequent Middle Eastern reac
tions and the implications for U.S. policy
in that region.
Though the opinions of the audience
were mixed, many appreciated that the
teach-in examined various viewpoints
from different people.
"The argument could seem radical at
first, but it looked factually based," fresh
man Alex Stein said.
