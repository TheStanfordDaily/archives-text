# Big Disappointment
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The post-game scene in Stanford's locker room was all
you needed to know about the 106th Big Game.
There was sophomore cornerback T.J. Rushing quiet
ly sulking with his face in his hands, unable to understand
how Cal wideout Geoff McArthur was able to set a school
record for receiving against him.
There was quarterback Chris Lewis, languidly stand
ing in the corner, trying to figure out why his Cardinal of
fense was unable to take full advantage of Cal's five first
half turnovers.
And there was head coach Buddy Teevens, feverishly
trying to find a way to sell Stanford football to a couple of
recruits after his Cardinal team was unable to regain the
Axe.
If you haven't figured it out by now, Stanford was de
feated by Cal 28-16 in the biggest Big Game in seven
years. The Cardinal (4-6, 2-6 Pacific-10 Conference) lost
to Cal at home for the first time since 1993 and saw any
hopes of a bowl bid disappear. Meanwhile, the Bears (7-
6,5-3) made themselves bowl eligible — they will proba
bly be headed to the Insight.com Bowl or the Sun Bowl
— for the first time since their 1996 Alamo Bowl season.
"It's frustrating, period, to lose a Big Game and it's
frustrating to lose a Big Game like this," Lewis said.
Many things went wrong for Stanford in this game, but
nothing was more crucial than the offense's inability to
capitalize on turnovers and pull away from Cal early.
In the Cardinal's impressive wins over UCLA and
Arizona State a few weeks ago, the common themes were

that of forcing turnovers, shortening the field for a strug
gling offense and getting ahead early to boost the young
team's confidence.
And when the Bears had three fumbles, an intercep
tion and a failed fourth-down conversion all in the first 19
minutes, Stanford had all the gifts it could ever ask for.
Couple that with a few Cal drives stalled deep inside its
own territory, and Stanford had the ball seven times in
enemy territory.
But all it could manage with all those chances was a 22-
yard Michael Sgroi field goal and a 24-yard touchdown
pass from Lewis to Luke Powell.
There were many moments that Stanford can point to
as figuring into the loss. But in looking back, two key
plays stick out.
First, a bad snap over Lewis' head at the Cal 9-yard
line turned a prime scoring opportunity into a turnover at
the 31. And a few possessions later, running back Ken
neth Tolon's drop of a likely touchdown pass at the Cal
15-yard line resulted in a field goal missed by Sgroi.
"The bad snap and the dropped pass really hurt,"
Powell said. "The entire game would have bebn different
without those two plays.
"You can't put the blame on two people. We didn't ex
ecute. But [the plays] made a big difference."
Yes, they did.
Instead of heading into the locker room comfortably
ahead, Stanford ambled cautiously off the field at half
time, wondering whether those failures to convert would
come back to haunt it.
