# Big Disappointment
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The post-game scene in Stanford's locker room was all
you needed to know about the 106th Big Game.
There was sophomore cornerback T.J. Rushing quiet
ly sulking with his face in his hands, unable to understand
how Cal wideout Geoff McArthur was able to set a school
record for receiving against him.
There was quarterback Chris Lewis, languidly stand
ing in the corner, trying to figure out why his Cardinal of
fense was unable to take full advantage of Cal's five first
half turnovers.
And there was head coach Buddy Teevens, feverishly
trying to find a way to sell Stanford football to a couple of
recruits after his Cardinal team was unable to regain the
Axe.
If you haven't figured it out by now, Stanford was de
feated by Cal 28-16 in the biggest Big Game in seven
years. The Cardinal (4-6, 2-6 Pacific-10 Conference) lost
to Cal at home for the first time since 1993 and saw any
hopes of a bowl bid disappear. Meanwhile, the Bears (7-
6,5-3) made themselves bowl eligible — they will proba
bly be headed to the Insight.com Bowl or the Sun Bowl
— for the first time since their 1996 Alamo Bowl season.
"It's frustrating, period, to lose a Big Game and it's
frustrating to lose a Big Game like this," Lewis said.
Many things went wrong for Stanford in this game, but
nothing was more crucial than the offense's inability to
capitalize on turnovers and pull away from Cal early.
In the Cardinal's impressive wins over UCLA and
Arizona State a few weeks ago, the common themes were

that of forcing turnovers, shortening the field for a strug
gling offense and getting ahead early to boost the young
team's confidence.
And when the Bears had three fumbles, an intercep
tion and a failed fourth-down conversion all in the first 19
minutes, Stanford had all the gifts it could ever ask for.
Couple that with a few Cal drives stalled deep inside its
own territory, and Stanford had the ball seven times in
enemy territory.
But all it could manage with all those chances was a 22-
yard Michael Sgroi field goal and a 24-yard touchdown
pass from Lewis to Luke Powell.
There were many moments that Stanford can point to
as figuring into the loss. But in looking back, two key
plays stick out.
First, a bad snap over Lewis' head at the Cal 9-yard
line turned a prime scoring opportunity into a turnover at
the 31. And a few possessions later, running back Ken
neth Tolon's drop of a likely touchdown pass at the Cal
15-yard line resulted in a field goal missed by Sgroi.
"The bad snap and the dropped pass really hurt,"
Powell said. "The entire game would have bebn different
without those two plays.
"You can't put the blame on two people. We didn't ex
ecute. But [the plays] made a big difference."
Yes, they did.
Instead of heading into the locker room comfortably
ahead, Stanford ambled cautiously off the field at half
time, wondering whether those failures to convert would
come back to haunt it.

California defender during Saturday's loss.
"If we had scored more points at the half,
we would have been in better shape emotion
ally," Teevens said. "Cal was not in a scramble
mind-set starting the second half."
That made a big difference for the Cal of
fense.

The Bears racked up 313 yards of total of
fense and 28 points in the second half — with
most of that output coming as a result of
McArthur's hands and quarterback Aaron
Rodgers' legs.
McArthur is the nation's second-leading re
ceiver behind Pittsburgh's Larry Fitzgerald
and he showed Stanford why.
He finished the game with a Cal-record 16
receptions for 245 yards and two touchdowns,
including the game-sealing 21-yard toss from

Rodgers with 10:07 left.
McArthur burned Rushing on both touch
downs. The Stanford corner got turned around
on both occasions so the Cal receiver pulled in
Rodgers' throws without Rushing even seeing
the ball.
"When the defensive back is not looking
back for the throw, he never really has a
chance for it," Rodgers said.
McArthur guessed he was double-teamed
only five times, leaving him with single cover
age most of the game, mostly against Rushing.
"When the ball was in the air, he wanted it
and he got it a couple times over us," Rushing
said. "He was running decent routes but noth
ing we didn't expect.
"They were a couple of great passes — the
quarterback put the ball on the money."
Rodgers also showed his great mobility,
rushing for 60 yards on seven carries and
converted several key third-downs for the
Bears.
Meanwhile, Stanford's offense struggled in

the second half. The Cardinal gained only 32
yards in the third quarter and Teevens pulled
Lewis in favor of redshirt freshman Trent Ed
wards with 10:47 remaining in the fourth quar
ter.
"We felt the need to throw the football,"
Teevens said. "Trent had a good week of
practice so we thought we'd give him a
chance."
Edwards, however, had his first pass inter
cepted when Alex Smith bobbled a pass into
the arms of Cal's Sid Slater at the Cardinal 29
yard-line and threw two errant passes to end
Stanford's next drive.
The redshirt freshman later injured his left
quadriceps, so Lewis re-entered the game and
found freshman Mark Bradford for a 30-yard
touchdown pass as time expired.
Lewis finished the game 12-of-25 for 161
yards and two touchdowns. Edwards was 4-of
10 for 46 yards and an interception.
With Stanford playing a meaningless game
against Notre Dame over Thanksgiving, the

quarterback controversy becomes full blown
for at least one week.
Do you play the senior Lewis for his last
game in a Cardinal uniform, or do you look
ahead to the future and play the younger Ed
wards?
"We are playing for success and the people
that put us in that position will play," Teevens
said. "I wouldn't make a call right now [on the
quarterback situation]."
With two consecutive winning seasons a
possibility if it can win its bowl game, Cal is
clearly a team on the rise — especially with the
junior McArthur and sophomore Rodgers
leading the charge.
"With all those guys coming back, I'd be
very surprised if we don't win the Pac-10 next
year," Bears running back Adimchinobe
Echemandu said.
Stanford, meanwhile, will be at home for
the holidays for the second consecutive year
and has won only three conference games in
two years.

Sophomore running back J.R. Lemon gets mauled by a
California defender during Saturday's loss.
"If we had scored more points at the half,
we would have been in better shape emotion
ally," Teevens said. "Cal was not in a scramble
mind-set starting the second half."
That made a big difference for the Cal of
fense.

The Bears racked up 313 yards of total of
fense and 28 points in the second half — with
most of that output coming as a result of
McArthur's hands and quarterback Aaron
Rodgers' legs.
McArthur is the nation's second-leading re
ceiver behind Pittsburgh's Larry Fitzgerald
and he showed Stanford why.
He finished the game with a Cal-record 16
receptions for 245 yards and two touchdowns,
including the game-sealing 21-yard toss from

Rodgers with 10:07 left.
McArthur burned Rushing on both touch
downs. The Stanford corner got turned around
on both occasions so the Cal receiver pulled in
Rodgers' throws without Rushing even seeing
the ball.
"When the defensive back is not looking
back for the throw, he never really has a
chance for it," Rodgers said.
McArthur guessed he was double-teamed
only five times, leaving him with single cover
age most of the game, mostly against Rushing.
"When the ball was in the air, he wanted it
and he got it a couple times over us," Rushing
said. "He was running decent routes but noth
ing we didn't expect.
"They were a couple of great passes — the
quarterback put the ball on the money."
Rodgers also showed his great mobility,
rushing for 60 yards on seven carries and
converted several key third-downs for the
Bears.
Meanwhile, Stanford's offense struggled in

the second half. The Cardinal gained only 32
yards in the third quarter and Teevens pulled
Lewis in favor of redshirt freshman Trent Ed
wards with 10:47 remaining in the fourth quar
ter.
"We felt the need to throw the football,"
Teevens said. "Trent had a good week of
practice so we thought we'd give him a
chance."
Edwards, however, had his first pass inter
cepted when Alex Smith bobbled a pass into
the arms of Cal's Sid Slater at the Cardinal 29
yard-line and threw two errant passes to end
Stanford's next drive.
The redshirt freshman later injured his left
quadriceps, so Lewis re-entered the game and
found freshman Mark Bradford for a 30-yard
touchdown pass as time expired.
Lewis finished the game 12-of-25 for 161
yards and two touchdowns. Edwards was 4-of
10 for 46 yards and an interception.
With Stanford playing a meaningless game
against Notre Dame over Thanksgiving, the

quarterback controversy becomes full blown
for at least one week.
Do you play the senior Lewis for his last
game in a Cardinal uniform, or do you look
ahead to the future and play the younger Ed
wards?
"We are playing for success and the people
that put us in that position will play," Teevens
said. "I wouldn't make a call right now [on the
quarterback situation]."
With two consecutive winning seasons a
possibility if it can win its bowl game, Cal is
clearly a team on the rise — especially with the
junior McArthur and sophomore Rodgers
leading the charge.
"With all those guys coming back, I'd be
very surprised if we don't win the Pac-10 next
year," Bears running back Adimchinobe
Echemandu said.
Stanford, meanwhile, will be at home for
the holidays for the second consecutive year
and has won only three conference games in
two years.
The post-game scene in Stanford's locker room was all
you needed to know about the 106th Big Game.
There was sophomore cornerback T.J. Rushing quiet
ly sulking with his face in his hands, unable to understand
how Cal wideout Geoff McArthur was able to set a school
record for receiving against him.
There was quarterback Chris Lewis, languidly stand
ing in the corner, trying to figure out why his Cardinal of
fense was unable to take full advantage of Cal's five first
half turnovers.
And there was head coach Buddy Teevens, feverishly
trying to find a way to sell Stanford football to a couple of
recruits after his Cardinal team was unable to regain the
Axe.
If you haven't figured it out by now, Stanford was de
feated by Cal 28-16 in the biggest Big Game in seven
years. The Cardinal (4-6, 2-6 Pacific-10 Conference) lost
to Cal at home for the first time since 1993 and saw any
hopes of a bowl bid disappear. Meanwhile, the Bears (7-
6,5-3) made themselves bowl eligible — they will proba
bly be headed to the Insight.com Bowl or the Sun Bowl
— for the first time since their 1996 Alamo Bowl season.
"It's frustrating, period, to lose a Big Game and it's
frustrating to lose a Big Game like this," Lewis said.
Many things went wrong for Stanford in this game, but
nothing was more crucial than the offense's inability to
capitalize on turnovers and pull away from Cal early.
In the Cardinal's impressive wins over UCLA and
Arizona State a few weeks ago, the common themes were

that of forcing turnovers, shortening the field for a strug
gling offense and getting ahead early to boost the young
team's confidence.
And when the Bears had three fumbles, an intercep
tion and a failed fourth-down conversion all in the first 19
minutes, Stanford had all the gifts it could ever ask for.
Couple that with a few Cal drives stalled deep inside its
own territory, and Stanford had the ball seven times in
enemy territory.
But all it could manage with all those chances was a 22-
yard Michael Sgroi field goal and a 24-yard touchdown
pass from Lewis to Luke Powell.
There were many moments that Stanford can point to
as figuring into the loss. But in looking back, two key
plays stick out.
First, a bad snap over Lewis' head at the Cal 9-yard
line turned a prime scoring opportunity into a turnover at
the 31. And a few possessions later, running back Ken
neth Tolon's drop of a likely touchdown pass at the Cal
15-yard line resulted in a field goal missed by Sgroi.
"The bad snap and the dropped pass really hurt,"
Powell said. "The entire game would have bebn different
without those two plays.
"You can't put the blame on two people. We didn't ex
ecute. But [the plays] made a big difference."
Yes, they did.
Instead of heading into the locker room comfortably
ahead, Stanford ambled cautiously off the field at half
time, wondering whether those failures to convert would
come back to haunt it.
