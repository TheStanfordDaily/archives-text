### HENRY F. BRIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Activists Javier Stauring and Tiawan Gongloe emphasized the con
tinued need for lawyers and public advocates to defend human rights at
a talk Friday sponsored by Stanford Law School's International Human
Rights Association.
Both men have worked extensively to combat human rights viola
tions; Gongloe as a lawyer in Liberia, and Stauring as a lay chaplain and
activist in Los Angeles.
In the 10 years Gongloe has worked with Human Rights Watch, he
has defended political detainees, independent journalists, human rights
activists and victims of abuse in Liberia's 14-year civil war. During his
time in Liberia, while the government was attempting to silence politi
cal dissent, other lawyers fled the country or remained silent. Gongloe,
however, continued to defend free speech.
"Liberians in trouble always knew Tiawan Gongloe's door was
open," said Binaifer Nowrojee, counsel with Human Rights Watch's
Africa division.
