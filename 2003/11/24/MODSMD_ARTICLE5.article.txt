# Human rights workers encourage advocacy
## 
### HENRY F. BRIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Activists Javier Stauring and Tiawan Gongloe emphasized the con
tinued need for lawyers and public advocates to defend human rights at
a talk Friday sponsored by Stanford Law School's International Human
Rights Association.
Both men have worked extensively to combat human rights viola
tions; Gongloe as a lawyer in Liberia, and Stauring as a lay chaplain and
activist in Los Angeles.
In the 10 years Gongloe has worked with Human Rights Watch, he
has defended political detainees, independent journalists, human rights
activists and victims of abuse in Liberia's 14-year civil war. During his
time in Liberia, while the government was attempting to silence politi
cal dissent, other lawyers fled the country or remained silent. Gongloe,
however, continued to defend free speech.
"Liberians in trouble always knew Tiawan Gongloe's door was
open," said Binaifer Nowrojee, counsel with Human Rights Watch's
Africa division.
In April 2002, Gongloe was arrested without charge and tor
tured, and was able to escape due to intense political pres
sure from Human Rights Watch and the international com
munity.
"The question would be, 'Were you afraid at times?'
and the answer is, 'Yes, I was afraid; I was afraid I was
putting my family at risk,' " Gongloe said. "I was getting
information from more and more sources that [the Liber
ian government] was after my life . . . but I kept going be
cause I knew it was the right thing to do. I would not be
seized by fear."
Gongloe initially worked on human rights cases on the
side, using revenue from his commercial practice to fund the
cases. However, as he gradually found that human rights is
sues were consuming more and more of his time, those cases
became the primary focus of his work.
Gongloe admitted that when he saw the fancy cars and
large houses of his colleagues, he at times doubted his deci
sion to devote so much of his time to pro bono human rights
cases. Still, Gongloe implored law students to consider work
ing in human rights.
"What inspired me to go to law school in the first place was
the level of deficiency in my country of litigating the rights of
the poor," he explained.

Injustice stateside

Since he first volunteered as a lay chaplain at Los Angeles'
juvenile hall, Stauring has visited prisons up and down Califor
nia, but when he became aware of the living conditions of juve
niles in LA Central Jail, Stauring became a political activist.
Stauring said the prison's 44 cells, occupied by teenagers
for an average of 23.5 hours a day, are so small that their oc
cupants can stretch out their hands and touch both sides of the
cell. If they request schooling, Stauring said, prisoners are al
lowed to see a teacher only once a week, through bars, for 15
minutes at a time â€” well under the state's legal minimum of
one hour.
Like Gongloe, Stauring has endured attempts to bully him
into silence. When two inmates attempted suicide, the dismal
living situation of the prisoners received a large amount of
media attention. The next day, after giving a press conference
demanding that the jail move the youths, Stauring received a
phone call from the sheriff saying that he was no longer al
lowed to minister the jail.
"To this day, I have not gotten my clearance back," he said.
In July, the county board of supervisors passed a resolu
tion saying that the prison had 60 days to remove the juve

niles. Nonetheless, four months later, 30 juveniles are still liv
ing in the same conditions. Stauring and Human Rights
Watch are examining avenues of litigation.
Stauring echoed Gongloe's call for increased awareness
and action.
"In this country, we think that human rights violations only
occur in other countries," he said. "But when we take juve
niles, and we throw them into cages, and we break their souls,
I don't think it can be called anything else but a violation of
human rights and dignity."
Senior Britten Heller, who plans to study international
human rights law, agreed.
"Juxtaposing international issues with domestic issues and
putting them on an equal level of importance was really help
ful," she said. "I don't think it's done nearly enough because we
think that human rights are just an international problem."
"I think the talk was inspiring to law students, because
folks go to schools like Stanford with the expectation that
they'll get out and work for some corporate giant and make

lots of money," said Bonnie Winston, an editor at the Virgin
ian Pilot and a Stanford Knight Fellow. "But there are many
other needs in this country. A lot of human rights violations
are not just happening overseas, they're happening right here
in the U.S., and people still need advocates."
The Law School's International Human Rights Associa
tion is circulating a petition to help Stauring regain access to
the jail. The association, which works closely with Human
Rights Watch, is assisting the organization with the case of the
Guantanamo Bay prisoners and is working on sending four
students to Ghana to work on health care issues.
Stephanie Beckstrom, president of the Human Rights As
sociation and a graduate student of international law, said she
was pleased with the turnout and hopes it will move students
to future action.
"We remain active in sponsoring events like these to edu
cate Stanford students with the hope that they won't just be
come educated, but will actually go out and do something
about these issues and make a difference."
