# Speaker encourages public service work
## 
### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When Kavita Ramdas was a
teenager volunteering in a poor
village to help with chores, an old
Indian man approached her and
asked why she was making bread
rather than using her education to
advocate his village's cause to the
government. Now, as chief execu
tive of the Global Fund for
Women, she is much more than an
advocate for a single village.
At a talk to a group of about 30
students at an event hosted by
South Asian organization San
skriti last Friday, Ramdas ex
plained how she surpassed the
man's expectations, describing
her motivation for getting in
volved in a social justice organiza
tion and her experience with pub
lic service.
Ramdas said her experience
growing up in India sparked her
desire to be involved in public ser
vice. Her mother pointed out the
injustices that were prevalent in
the country, making Ramdas
aware of social problems at a rela
tively young age. Later, Ramdas
worked for a variety of civil ser
vant organizations, which made
her recognize the gravity of gender
inequality within Indian society.
When she moved to the United
States, Ramdas kept up her involve
ment in public service organiza
tions, spending time working with
public housing shelters in Chicago.
She used her experiences in
rural India and urban Chicago to
explain that people cannot truly
understand a situation unless they
are exposed to it first-hand. For ex
ample, in one Indian village, most
of the women woke up at 4 a.m. to
prepare the house and make tea for
their husbands every morning. In
Chicago, one local who she met in
sisted that she had to be either
black or white, showing Ramdas

the racial divide in the city.
Ramdas also said that stereo
types play a key role in defining
people's notions of others. She, a
Hindu woman, often jokes with her
husband, who is Muslim, about the
traditional stereotypes the two re
ligious groups have of each other.
She also said that as a South Asian
woman, she is searched nearly
every time she boards a plane. This
experience "taught me about the
privileges people get for looking a
certain way," she said.
The Global Fund for Women is
the largest grant-making fund in
the world and helps local women's
groups in more than 160 countries.
Ramdas said that the goal of the
organization is to "give local
women's groups capital, not for
profit, but to provide a model for
change or an idea to transform so
ciety."
While the grants that the orga
nization gives aren't especially
large, Ramdas points out that they
are effective.
"A small amount of money can
go a long way when used in cre
ative ways," she said.
Ramdas said she believes that
by helping women rectify unfair
situations across the world, the
fund can improve society as a
whole.
"There's no such thing as a
'women's issue,"' she said. "We
make up 52 percent of the popula
tion, so every issue is a woman's
issue."
Attendees of the talk found
Ramdas a very interesting speaker
with an engaging style.
"Her delivery was really good
and very personal," freshman
Aditi Iyer said.

Sanskriti cultural chair member
