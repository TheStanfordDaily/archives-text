### NANCY WANG 
Members of the Psychology
Department recently traveled to
the nation's capitol to be honored
by the Smithsonian Associates'
Great Schools program, co-spon
sored by the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, the School of Humani
ties and Sciences and the Devel
opment Office. On Saturday, 10
faculty members shared their per
sonal research in an all-day semi
nar.
For the past 30 years, the Stan
ford Psychology Department has
ranked first in the nation, for the
quality of its faculty and its overall
program. Other "Great Schools"
honored by the program include
departments at Oxford, Yale,
Harvard, the University of Edin
burgh, the National Institutes of

Health and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
"The mandate of the Smithson
ian calls for the 'increase and dif
fusion' of knowledge, and one of
the best ways we can do that is to
invite top schools to come to the
Smithsonian on the Mall so we can
introduce them to our Washing
ton audience," said David
Pelizarri, the program's director.
During the all-day seminar,
Profs. Albert Bandura, Laura L.
Carstensen, John D. E. Gabrieli,
Brian Knutson, Mark R. Lepper,
Eleanor Maccoby, Hazel
Markus, Michael Ramscar,
Claude Steele, Jeanne L. Tsai
and Philip Zimbardo shared
their individual research pro
jects, as well as the department's
celebrated history. The seminar
was divided into segments cov

ering vision and perception,
memory, language and cogni
tion, emotion, and culture and
society. More than 100 atten
dees had the unique opportunity
to discuss and pose questions to
the faculty members at the end
of the day.
"We certainly hope the invi
tation is regarded as an honor,
not only by the faculty who
came, but also by those across
the nation affiliated with Stan
ford who are glad to see the Uni
versity's stature reinforced at
the national level, by those
based in Washington interested
in psychology who are glad to
have access to some of the lead
ing lights of the field for at least
one day, and by potential stu
dents and their families who
want to know more about the

caliber of Stanford faculty and
research," Pelizarri said.
Zimbardo, whose personal re
search spans areas from evil and
madness to persuasion, said, "it is
a big honor for our department
and for Stanford to receive that
kind of independent recognition
about the impact of our research
and educational program."
Senior Neil Van Os, who has a
minor in psychology, showed no
surprise when he learned of the
newest honor bestowed upon the
department.
"I've always considered the
psychology department to be a
strong asset to Stanford," he said.
"It is not only a department of ex
traordinary research but also a de
partment dedicated to its students
and a love of learning in psycholo
gy-"
