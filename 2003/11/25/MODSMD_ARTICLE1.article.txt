# Workers rally for health care outside Safeway
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Picketers have taken to the Safeway on El
Camino Real in Menlo Park for the past week to
protest against the company's new contract offer
for Southern California workers, which they claim
cuts into those workers' health care benefits.
The picketers represent the more than 70,000
members of United Food and Commercial Work
ers, the labor union that represents workers at
Safeway's Southern California Vons chain, who
have been fighting the new contract offer for the
past six weeks.
Mike DiLeo, shop steward and leader of the in
formational picket line, said that the picketers are
here to bring the union's message from Southern
California to Northern California, where Safeway
chief executive Steven Burd resides and where the
Pleasanton-based company operates.
The union claims that Safeway is attempting to
eliminate affordable health care benefits for its
workers by forcing them to pay for premium fees
and co-payments, which were completely covered
by the corporation until now.
DiLeo said that under Safeway's proposed con
tract, 30 to 40 percent of part-time workers' total
wages would be devoted to paying for health care
and that 75 percent of Safeway employees work
part-time. He also said the contract would take
away the pension of many workers, including his
own.
"I was supposed to retire in two years with a
pension plan, but now if this new contract is
passed, instead of retiring at 52,1 have to retire at
the age of 62," DiLeo said.
Although the general manager of the Menlo
Park Safeway declined to comment on the pick
eters, he did offer a letter to customers written by
Frank Calfas, president of the Northern California
