# Workers rally for health care outside Safeway
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Picketers have taken to the Safeway on El
Camino Real in Menlo Park for the past week to
protest against the company's new contract offer
for Southern California workers, which they claim
cuts into those workers' health care benefits.
The picketers represent the more than 70,000
members of United Food and Commercial Work
ers, the labor union that represents workers at
Safeway's Southern California Vons chain, who
have been fighting the new contract offer for the
past six weeks.
Mike DiLeo, shop steward and leader of the in
formational picket line, said that the picketers are
here to bring the union's message from Southern
California to Northern California, where Safeway
chief executive Steven Burd resides and where the
Pleasanton-based company operates.
The union claims that Safeway is attempting to
eliminate affordable health care benefits for its
workers by forcing them to pay for premium fees
and co-payments, which were completely covered
by the corporation until now.
DiLeo said that under Safeway's proposed con
tract, 30 to 40 percent of part-time workers' total
wages would be devoted to paying for health care
and that 75 percent of Safeway employees work
part-time. He also said the contract would take
away the pension of many workers, including his
own.
"I was supposed to retire in two years with a
pension plan, but now if this new contract is
passed, instead of retiring at 52,1 have to retire at
the age of 62," DiLeo said.
Although the general manager of the Menlo
Park Safeway declined to comment on the pick
eters, he did offer a letter to customers written by
Frank Calfas, president of the Northern California
division of Safeway, who empha
sized that none of the Safeway em
ployees in this region are on strike
and that the strike has nothing to do
with employees here.
Calfas countered the union's
claim that the corporation is trying
to eliminate workers' health care
benefits.
"The employers made a gener
ous offer to union leadership that
included: annual bonuses and a
wage increase, a 40 percent in
crease in the employer contribu
tion to our current employees'
health care benefits and an in

crease in the contribution to our
current employees' pension fund
— with the exception of courtesy
clerks," he wrote in the letter.
However, DiLeo argued that the
outcome of the negotiations in
Southern California will set the stan
dard for Safeway employees every
where, including Northern Califor
nia workers whose contract expires
in September 2004.
"Although the workers inside the
store cannot come out and picket
with us or else they'll lose their jobs,
they have been receptive to us as
they start to realize that our contract
negotiations affect them, too,"
DiLeo said. "In addition, although a
lot of people walk by us like we are

homeless people, others have been
sympathetic and turned away, and
this is what keeps us energized."
Michael Oliver, a San Jose resi
dent and a regular Safeway cus
tomer, said that he will not shop
there until the strike ends.
"I am concerned about the pres
sure being put on unions in general
to capitulate to lower wages and
benefits," Oliver said.
Adding to Safeway's troubles,
two pension funds filed civil com
plaints against its management and
board last week, alleging the compa
ny has been destroyed by conflicts of
interest, mismanagement, deceit
and greed, the Associated Press re
ported.

Stanford students have mixed
feelings about the picketers. Some
have continued to shop there, while
others have refrained, although for
different reasons than those offered
by Oliver.
"Although workers have every
right to protest, I would question the
effectiveness of it," said sophomore
Ah Jamal. "People are constantly
arriving that are willing to work
harder and longer hours for less
money."
Sophomore Brian Nguyen had a
different perspective.
"I've wanted to go to Safeway for
the past two weeks," he said. "But
there's protesters out there, and
they intimidate me."
