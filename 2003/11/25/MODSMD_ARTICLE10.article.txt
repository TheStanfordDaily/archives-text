# Crunch time for Teevens
## 
### ALEXANDER KENDALL DESK EDITOR 
In the wake of Stanford's first
Big Game loss at home since 199,
some Stanford students have
turned to the tried-and-true con
solation of our alleged intellectu
al superiority over Cal for com
fort.
"They might have won an ath
letic match-up, but we are still
smarter than they are," says
freshman Tania Juarez. "As I
chanted at Big Game, 'Kick them
in the ass; kick them in the knees;
we have higher SAT's.' "
Unfortunately for Jaurez and
her like-minded compatriots, re
cent research from Berkeley
raises the possibility that some
one from Cal may just be smarter
than someone at Stanford.
David Romer, professor of
Economics at UC-Berkeley, has
used dynamic programming to
estimate the value of kicking ver
sus going for it on fourth down in
football games.
Most students of games of
chance would know that when
evaluating this choice, one
should weigh the values of vari
ous outcomes by their probabili
ties. According to Romer, how
ever, the crucial error most make
in this process is only considering
the point values of different re
sults, while missing the impor
tant factor of field position.
As Romer writes, when such
considerations are properly ac
counted for, "the results are
striking. The analysis implies
that teams should be quite ag
gressive. A team facing fourth
and goal is better off on average
trying for a touchdown as long as
it is within five yards of the end
zone. At midfield, being within
five yards of a first down makes
going for it on average desirable.
Even on its 10-yard line —90
yards from a score — a team
within three yards of first down is
better off on average going for
it."
During Big Game, Stanford
kicked a total of 10 times, almost
twice as many as Cal. Of these 10
kicks, fully one half were a bad
idea by Romer's metric.
Though he is not familiar with
Romer's work, sophomore Eric
Adamson has come to a conclu
sion remarkably similar to one
rooted in dynamic programming:
"We need to air it out a little. We
have two really good passing quar
terbacks and we're not using them
Many Stanford students blame
team's unadventurous play calling
fers an easy solution to the Farm's

We just play too conservatively."
Buddy Teevens, head football coach, for the
and, by extension, losing season. Adamson of
athletic ill fortune: "Fire Buddy. But don't fire

his staff. A lot of them — special
teams and defense — are doing a
really good job."
Other students are not so
sure. According to senior Matt
Bricker, "After Tyrone Willing
ham left us to join Notre Dame
as head coach, our program has
taken a dive. Willingham had a
phenomenal first season at Notre
Dame and although our records
are the same going into this Sat
urday's game, I would be pretty
surprised if we were to beat
them. But can I say with certain
ty that the downturn in our pro
gram is Teevens' fault? No. All I
know is that at Stanford, a truly
major university where we prac
tically own the Sear's Cup, we
should have a football team
worth being proud of."
A third group of students is
left out of this debate. Says fresh
man Robert Negrete, "I have no
idea who Teevens is."
Still, the pervasive feeling
among students is one of betray
al. "We chanted for him to go for
it [on fourth down]," sighs fresh
man Holo Ho'Opai, "but he just
didn't listen. Why did he do that
to us? Why?"
Romer writes that there is
no one answer to this question,
but that there are two main alter
natives: "Conservative behav
iors arise because individuals
have non-standard objective
functions or because they are im
perfect maximizers." In layman's
terms, that means that either
Teevens is trying to do some
thing other than win Big Game at
all costs or that he does not know
the best way to do it."
Faced with those two pos
sibilities, freshman Natasha Dar
states, "If that is the case, then we
have no choice but to fire
Teevens."
Regardless of Teevens' fu
ture fate, many Stanford students
are bewildered by this turn of
events. When confronted with the
evidence, junior Robbie Yan, se
nior consultant to The Daily on
dynamic programming, gave a
quizzical look and wondered
aloud, "If we are smarter than
they are, then why did Cal have a
much better strategy than we did
for Big Game?"
Junior Ravi Grover offers
one solution: "Teevens' applica
tion never crossed Robin Mam
let's desk."
On the age old question of

which students are smarter, Jaurez

offers: "After the game some Cal guy tried to talk trash to me. Take your stupid
Tree and go home,' he said. All I could do was shake my head. Unlike the reject,
I was home."
Buddy Teevens did not respond to The Daily's requests for comment.
