### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
G What's my chance of meeting Mr../ Ms. Right at
Stanford?
A I'm confident that an overwhelming majority of
/I Stanford undergraduates, one time or another
/ ■ during their four years at this world-renowned
-JL. institution, must have asked the above ques
tion. After all, according to a nationwide survey conducted
by the Independent Women's Forum, an organization pro
moting the "political freedom and economic liberty" of
women, 63 percent women enter college hoping to find then
future husbands there. The case for male Stanford under
graduates is even more obvious: Many of us turned down
MIT and Caltech to matriculate here to keep that very
chance above zero.
In order to tackle this question, however, we need to un
derstand what exactly the question is asking for. Let's start
by making a few key assumptions. Dismissing the belief pop
ularized by Hollywood films that for each individual on
earth, there is one and only one breathing soul destined to
be his or her significant other, we will assume that there ex
ists a group of people that could be deemed as the right
match for each person. Let's call this group of people, the
"ones." How a suitor spots the "ones" is, of course, by ap
plying the fourth Axiom that I developed in the last column,
as follows:
Suppose the length of the feature list is some big number,
say, 1,000. (Recall that the feature list is the universal list of at
tributes based on which people evaluate each other. The list in
cludes attributes like height, weight, appearance, humor and
money.) Furthermore, assume that there is a method by which
we could quantify each person's value for each of the attribut

es in the feature list. For certain attributes, this would be sim
ple: for instance, a 5-foot-nine, 160-pound man would have 5-
foot-9 for his height attribute and 160 pounds for his weight at
tribute. For other less-quantifiable attributes such as appear
ance and humor, however, an assignment of values to them
would be difficult. For the purpose of illustration, however,
let's assume that we could develop a mapping from the set of
all humors to the set of all real numbers, and a mapping from
the set of all facial appearances to the set of all real numbers.
With the above model in place, we can completely
characterize every male and female with a 1,000-compo
nent vector. A more poetic albeit mathematical way to
say this is that each person is a point in a 1,000-dimen
sional real space. Hence, the essential activity that Alice
performs when she is seeking a boyfriend is staring at this
1,000-dimensional space and assigning each point in this
space a score by dot-multiplying the weight vector and
the score vector for that point (Axiom Three). When the
score for a point passes a certain threshold, the person
that corresponds to that point becomes one of the "ones"
for Alice. Therefore, for each person, we have a set of
points in the 1,000-dimensional space that compose the
set of the "ones." Let's call these points the "special
points." The question then becomes, given a randomly
chosen Stanford undergraduate Bob, what fraction of his
"special points" corresponds to Stanford undergradu
ates? And if that fraction is non-zero, what is the proba
bility that he will ever meet one of the "ones" that ap
peared at Stanford?

The first question turns out to be extremely difficult to
answer. As its value varies drastically from individual to
individual, we shall not discuss the computation of it. It is
safe, however, to assume that the fraction is non-zero.
This is justified by the fact that Stanford undergraduates
more or less share many common values, interests and
goals. It would be pretty hard to find a student here that
has no strong romantic interest in anybody else on cam
pus. To answer the second question, let's assume that for

each Stanford student, on the average, one out of every
300 students falls into the "ones." So given the 6,000-per
son student body here, there are about 20 people that
would be almost perfect-matches for you.
So we have transformed the question one more time: The
chance for a randomly chosen Stanford undergraduate to
meet his or her Mr. or Ms. Right is equivalent to the proba
bility for the student to run into any of these 20 people ram
bling around campus.
In order to compute the probability that one will meet
any of the 20 special people, we need to analyze how many
people, on the average, each Stanford student will meet
and interact with beyond acquaintance during his or her
four-year undergraduate career. Assume that each stu
dent lives in a different 80-person dorm each year and par
ticipates in one extra-curricular activity that involves 20
other people. Also assume that each student takes four
classes per quarter and gets to know five people in each
class pretty well. In addition, each Stanford student also
meets 10 other students each quarter via parties, football
games, fountain-hopping and bike clashes, etc. Through
out a student's four-year stay at Stanford, then, he or she
would meet 920 people. Cutting that in half, each student
interacts with 460 potential mates.
The probability that any one of the 20 special people
would fall into this 460-person circle is one minus the prob
ability that none of them falls into this 460-person group,
which is 20 460
6000 = .2153.
Hence, the probability that a randomly chosen Stanford
student would meet any of his or her 20 special "ones" is
1 - .2153 = .7847 = 78.47 percent
Voila, the probability that you will meet your future sig
nificant other on this campus is 78.47 percent. Go figure.

the set of all facial appearances to the set of all real numbers.
With the above model in place, we can completely
characterize every male and female with a 1,000-compo
nent vector. A more poetic albeit mathematical way to
say this is that each person is a point in a 1,000-dimen
sional real space. Hence, the essential activity that Alice
performs when she is seeking a boyfriend is staring at this
1,000-dimensional space and assigning each point in this
space a score by dot-multiplying the weight vector and
the score vector for that point (Axiom Three). When the
score for a point passes a certain threshold, the person
that corresponds to that point becomes one of the "ones"
for Alice. Therefore, for each person, we have a set of
points in the 1,000-dimensional space that compose the
set of the "ones." Let's call these points the "special
points." The question then becomes, given a randomly
chosen Stanford undergraduate Bob, what fraction of his
"special points" corresponds to Stanford undergradu
ates? And if that fraction is non-zero, what is the proba
bility that he will ever meet one of the "ones" that ap
peared at Stanford?

The first question turns out to be extremely difficult to
answer. As its value varies drastically from individual to
individual, we shall not discuss the computation of it. It is
safe, however, to assume that the fraction is non-zero.
This is justified by the fact that Stanford undergraduates
more or less share many common values, interests and
goals. It would be pretty hard to find a student here that
has no strong romantic interest in anybody else on cam
pus. To answer the second question, let's assume that for

each Stanford student, on the average, one out of every
300 students falls into the "ones." So given the 6,000-per
son student body here, there are about 20 people that
would be almost perfect-matches for you.
So we have transformed the question one more time: The
chance for a randomly chosen Stanford undergraduate to
meet his or her Mr. or Ms. Right is equivalent to the proba
bility for the student to run into any of these 20 people ram
bling around campus.
In order to compute the probability that one will meet
any of the 20 special people, we need to analyze how many
people, on the average, each Stanford student will meet
and interact with beyond acquaintance during his or her
four-year undergraduate career. Assume that each stu
dent lives in a different 80-person dorm each year and par
ticipates in one extra-curricular activity that involves 20
other people. Also assume that each student takes four
classes per quarter and gets to know five people in each
class pretty well. In addition, each Stanford student also
meets 10 other students each quarter via parties, football
games, fountain-hopping and bike clashes, etc. Through
out a student's four-year stay at Stanford, then, he or she
would meet 920 people. Cutting that in half, each student
interacts with 460 potential mates.
The probability that any one of the 20 special people
would fall into this 460-person circle is one minus the prob
ability that none of them falls into this 460-person group,
which is 20 460
6000 = .2153.
Hence, the probability that a randomly chosen Stanford
student would meet any of his or her 20 special "ones" is
1 - .2153 = .7847 = 78.47 percent
Voila, the probability that you will meet your future sig
nificant other on this campus is 78.47 percent. Go figure.

G What's my chance of meeting Mr../ Ms. Right at
Stanford?
A I'm confident that an overwhelming majority of
/I Stanford undergraduates, one time or another
/ ■ during their four years at this world-renowned
-JL. institution, must have asked the above ques
tion. After all, according to a nationwide survey conducted
by the Independent Women's Forum, an organization pro
moting the "political freedom and economic liberty" of
women, 63 percent women enter college hoping to find then
future husbands there. The case for male Stanford under
graduates is even more obvious: Many of us turned down
MIT and Caltech to matriculate here to keep that very
chance above zero.
In order to tackle this question, however, we need to un
derstand what exactly the question is asking for. Let's start
by making a few key assumptions. Dismissing the belief pop
ularized by Hollywood films that for each individual on
earth, there is one and only one breathing soul destined to
be his or her significant other, we will assume that there ex
ists a group of people that could be deemed as the right
match for each person. Let's call this group of people, the
"ones." How a suitor spots the "ones" is, of course, by ap
plying the fourth Axiom that I developed in the last column,
as follows:
Suppose the length of the feature list is some big number,
say, 1,000. (Recall that the feature list is the universal list of at
tributes based on which people evaluate each other. The list in
cludes attributes like height, weight, appearance, humor and
money.) Furthermore, assume that there is a method by which
we could quantify each person's value for each of the attribut

es in the feature list. For certain attributes, this would be sim
ple: for instance, a 5-foot-nine, 160-pound man would have 5-
foot-9 for his height attribute and 160 pounds for his weight at
tribute. For other less-quantifiable attributes such as appear
ance and humor, however, an assignment of values to them
would be difficult. For the purpose of illustration, however,
let's assume that we could develop a mapping from the set of
all humors to the set of all real numbers, and a mapping from
the set of all facial appearances to the set of all real numbers.
With the above model in place, we can completely
characterize every male and female with a 1,000-compo
nent vector. A more poetic albeit mathematical way to
say this is that each person is a point in a 1,000-dimen
sional real space. Hence, the essential activity that Alice
performs when she is seeking a boyfriend is staring at this

space a score by dot-multiplying the weight vector and
the score vector for that point (Axiom Three). When the
score for a point passes a certain threshold, the person
that corresponds to that point becomes one of the "ones"
for Alice. Therefore, for each person, we have a set of
points in the 1,000-dimensional space that compose the
set of the "ones." Let's call these points the "special
points." The question then becomes, given a randomly
chosen Stanford undergraduate Bob, what fraction of his
"special points" corresponds to Stanford undergradu
ates? And if that fraction is non-zero, what is the proba
bility that he will ever meet one of the "ones" that ap
peared at Stanford?
