## Ticket price increase a 'Big' mistake 
### 
While Saturday's Big Game loss to Cal
was disappointing, even more upset
ting was the number of Stanford fans
in the stands. Despite the fact that
some Stanford students braved the cold to sup
port the team, being outnumbered by Cal fans at
a home game should be a cause for concern — for
both the team and the school.
Robert Carruesco, assistant athletic director
and director of marketing and ticket sales, said
that at least 3,000 Stanford students attended Big
Game, while more than 4,000 Cal students were
there. These numbers are surprising considering

that last year, more than
2,500 tickets were pre
sold to Stanford students,
who travelled to Berkeley
to watch the game.
Shouldn't significantly
more Stanford students
have attended a home
game?
This year's ticket price
— $52 for Big Game —
undoubtedly had some
thing to do with poor
turnout. And while the
Athletics Department

— r
says that the ticket price was exactly the same as
last year, many students were disappointed that
season tickets for football games were not avail
able. Last year, the season pass sold for $35, a rea
sonable price to pay for a quarter of games. This
year, the season ticket was not offered.
Instead, Carruesco said, this year's $60 All
Axe-Cess pass was created in the hopes that stu
dents would be able to purchase "a fantastically
priced one-stop ticket to get the student body in
volved with attending many Stanford athletic
events." Turns out the pass isn't so fantastic:
Men's basketball tickets must be purchased sepa
rately.
Despite the new ticket plan, only about 2,000
Stanford students purchased the All Axe-Cess

pass. Carruesco said that once the Athletics De
partment realized that the student population as
a whole was not interested in the All Axe-Cess
pass, it was too late to change the plan.
Thankfully, Carruesco and others are current
ly reviewing ticket prices and say they will make
adjustments for next year. This type of decision
making process is warranted and appropriate.
However, it is sad that many students missed
an opportunity to see Big Game because of pro
hibitive ticket prices. Though nothing can be
done about it now, the Athletics Department can
learn the importance of student support in the

stands. The student sec
tion had seen poor
numbers in past games
this season, and it is un
fortunate that the Ath
letics Department
didn't take any last
minute steps to see that
students had the oppor
tunity to support their
team. In a season when
Cardinal football needs
all the support it can
get, it seems strange to
discourage — monetar
ily, at least — student

support.
One restriction that stood in the way of rea
sonable ticket prices, according to Carruesco, was
an understanding with UC-Berkeley that no one
could buy a single Big Game ticket for less than
$50.
Cal students, however, pre-purchased Big
Game tickets for only $17. We don't understand
how Cal was able to work its way around this
agreement. The understanding only seemed to
hurt Stanford students and further alienate them
from supporting our football team. Maybe before
we sit down to deal with the opposing team, Stan
ford Athletics should come to an understanding
with its own students.
