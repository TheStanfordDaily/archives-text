# Laundry costs take students to cleaners
## 
### 
Over the weekend, Stanford students
hauled bags of dirty socks and
sweaty T-shirts to various laundry
facilities around campus to take ad
vantage of Free Wash Weekend, a promotion
offered by Coinmach, the University's laundry
vendor. Despite the crowded lines to use the
free machines, we believe this event was a suc
cessful demonstration of the merits of an un
limited-use laundry program.
Last year, the ASSU proposed the "Just
Like Home" laundry program, which would
have established a flat-rate, unlimited-use sys
tem for all campus laundry machines. Howev
er, the program was canceled over the summer
after Undergraduate Housing Operations re
ceived a number of student complaints over the
addition of a flat laundry fee to the board bill.
Next week, the ASSU will host focus groups
and online surveys to re-explore the possibility
of introducing such a program. The popularity
of this weekend's promotion demonstrates the
depth of student support for an unlimited wash
initiative. Considering that "Just like Home"
was canceled with little student input, we be
lieve the issue warrants further discussion and
study.
The flat fee plan would place an extra $28

dollar charge on student bills, which equates to
approximately 14 loads of washing and drying,
or 1.4 loads a week per 10-week quarter. This is
a reasonable fee to pay for avoiding the hassle
associated with coin-operated machines. Given
all the constraints on students' time, it would be
far more efficient to charge students up front
for their laundry use than to force individual
payments throughout the quarter — with loose
quarters. Very few students do an average of
less than 1.4 loads per week. Also, few students
are likely to have the time or incentives to
abuse the program and create waste by washing
more often than necessary. From an economic
perspective, "Just Like Home" offers great po
tential for all involved parties.
Furthermore, the ASSU initiative would im
prove the social climate of Stanford by increas
ing the homeliness of student residences. By
moving away from coin-operated machines,
students would be less likely to throw their
neighbors' clean clothes on the floor and more
likely to simply put them in a empty dryer and
push start.
As Free Wash Weekend demonstrated,
there are plenty of reasons to make Stanford
laundry "Just like Home," and we support fur
ther study of this proposal.
