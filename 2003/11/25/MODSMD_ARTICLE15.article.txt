ResEd needs to listen to students

When I was a freshman in Larkin,
the Office of Residential Education
used to project itself as something
special — something I bragged
about to high school friends at other
universities. The unique polices on
alcohol, community and education
really set the freshman experience
apart from anywhere else. Given the
current trend of rapid changes and
lack of student input with those
changes, it seems a matter of time
before RAs are merely a policeman
arm of Residential Education. It
seems but a matter of time before
the Row program gets thrown away
in favor of something more tame and
controllable and it seems only a mat
ter of time before the Greek pro
gram is done away with altogether.
Students feel like they are under at
tack from above. We have but a little
voice, no real power and the last
thing anyone wants to do is entrust
and educate us to act responsibly. In
stead, these opportunities seem to be
quickly slipping away and taking
much of undergraduate tradition
and character with it. A tragedy,
given how special Residential Edu
cation was only three years ago when
I was a freshman.

Fans' clothing goes too far

I wanted to express my disap
pointment at seeing such a high oc
currence of "F— Cal" hats, "F—
Kal" T-shirts, and T-shirts with car
toons of bears on their knees in front
of trees at this year's Big Game. Stu
dents should, of course, feel free to
wear what they want, but it's too bad
that so many choose to use their
freedom in such bad taste.
I don't mean to sound puritan ...
I graduated less than 10 years ago
and I have been going to every Big

Game since I was a frosh. One of the
things that I love about the Stanford-
Cal rivalry is the one-sided bitter
ness of it. Cal fans have been com
bining expletives with Stanford for
years, and why not... they have in
numerable reasons to feel bitter.
And they are doing us a favor; Cal
fans focus so much bitterness up at
Berkeley that they allow the rest of
us to live happy and free lives. How
ever, when Stanford students wear
the kinds of T-shirts they wore on
Saturday, they come across as being
just as bitter . . . and they come
across as joining that which they
abhor.
Let Cal fans use all the middle fin
gers they want. Stanford fans don't
have to stoop to that level. When we
do, we lose a bit of the great edge
that we have over Cal... one of the
things that drives Cal fans crazy is
the fact that we don't hate them ...
for years we just beat them, forgot
about them and went on with our
happy lives until the next sporting
event where again we beat them, for
got about them and went on with our
happy lives.
There's no point in giving Cal
fans any thought that we despise
them to the degree that they despise
us. Nothing drives Cal fans crazier
than when they give you their middle
fingers and you just smile back.
When you do that, they actually feel
really stupid because they realize
that they expend a lot of negative en
ergy on a place that is too happy to
spend negative energy on them.
So next year, on your way up to
Berkeley's stadium, you will of
course see "F — Stanford this" and
"F— Stanford that." Let them run
20-year old tapes of an illegal play
over and over in every pub and
sporting goods store in Berkeley. Let
them hate your guts. And hopefully
you will just feel sorry for those who
behave that way toward you and for
how much premeditation they spend
on their bitterness. Believe me, your
pity will drive them crazier than any

middle finger ever will.

Cardinal Competitive Cheer
should not replace Dollies

After watching Big Game with
the Chicago Alumni Association,
we felt disgusted; not just because
of the terrible loss to Cal, but also
because of ESPN's broadcast.
Stanford has a longstanding tradi
tion of departing from standard
college sports pageantry: Rather
than making Homecoming floats,
we have Gaieties; rather than
marching, our band scatters; and
rather than cheerleaders, we have
Dollies. It is on this last point that
we are writing.
During the ESPN broadcast, the
camera continued to focus on the
Stanford Competitive Cheer
Squad. Despite the initial state
ment that the cheer squad is not
going to replace the Dollies, their
presence at athletic functions draws
attention away from established
Stanford institutions. We realize
that the cheer squad does not con
trol the camera people, but they
provide a familiar focal point for
men and women who are trained to
show the excitement of the game.
However, this is not the way Stan
ford sports fans and alumni think
about our beloved Cardinal. When
we picture Big Game, we see crazy
band uniforms, the matching drum
major and Dolly outfits, and Stan
ford student excitement, none of
which were featured, further re
moving alumni from the Farm ex
perience.
We ask that the Stanford Athletic
Department limit the role of the
Stanford Competitive Cheer Squad.
Their presence detracts from indi
viduality of Stanford sports and the
character of Stanford itself.

about our beloved Cardinal. When

We ask that the Stanford Athletic

Their presence detracts from indi

ResEd needs to listen to students

When I was a freshman in Larkin,
the Office of Residential Education
used to project itself as something
special — something I bragged
about to high school friends at other
universities. The unique polices on
alcohol, community and education
really set the freshman experience
apart from anywhere else. Given the
current trend of rapid changes and
lack of student input with those
changes, it seems a matter of time
before RAs are merely a policeman
arm of Residential Education. It
seems but a matter of time before
the Row program gets thrown away
in favor of something more tame and
controllable and it seems only a mat
ter of time before the Greek pro
gram is done away with altogether.
Students feel like they are under at
tack from above. We have but a little
voice, no real power and the last
thing anyone wants to do is entrust
and educate us to act responsibly. In
stead, these opportunities seem to be
quickly slipping away and taking
much of undergraduate tradition
and character with it. A tragedy,
given how special Residential Edu
cation was only three years ago when
I was a freshman.

Fans' clothing goes too far

I wanted to express my disap
pointment at seeing such a high oc
currence of "F— Cal" hats, "F—
Kal" T-shirts, and T-shirts with car
toons of bears on their knees in front
of trees at this year's Big Game. Stu
dents should, of course, feel free to
wear what they want, but it's too bad
that so many choose to use their
freedom in such bad taste.
I don't mean to sound puritan ...
I graduated less than 10 years ago
and I have been going to every Big

Game since I was a frosh. One of the
things that I love about the Stanford-
Cal rivalry is the one-sided bitter
ness of it. Cal fans have been com
bining expletives with Stanford for
years, and why not... they have in
numerable reasons to feel bitter.
And they are doing us a favor; Cal
fans focus so much bitterness up at
Berkeley that they allow the rest of
us to live happy and free lives. How
ever, when Stanford students wear
the kinds of T-shirts they wore on
Saturday, they come across as being
just as bitter . . . and they come
across as joining that which they
abhor.
Let Cal fans use all the middle fin
gers they want. Stanford fans don't
have to stoop to that level. When we
do, we lose a bit of the great edge
that we have over Cal... one of the
things that drives Cal fans crazy is
the fact that we don't hate them ...
for years we just beat them, forgot
about them and went on with our
happy lives until the next sporting
event where again we beat them, for
got about them and went on with our
happy lives.
There's no point in giving Cal
fans any thought that we despise
them to the degree that they despise
us. Nothing drives Cal fans crazier
than when they give you their middle
fingers and you just smile back.
When you do that, they actually feel
really stupid because they realize
that they expend a lot of negative en
ergy on a place that is too happy to
spend negative energy on them.
So next year, on your way up to
Berkeley's stadium, you will of
course see "F — Stanford this" and
"F— Stanford that." Let them run
20-year old tapes of an illegal play
over and over in every pub and
sporting goods store in Berkeley. Let
them hate your guts. And hopefully
you will just feel sorry for those who
behave that way toward you and for
how much premeditation they spend
on their bitterness. Believe me, your
pity will drive them crazier than any

middle finger ever will.

Cardinal Competitive Cheer
should not replace Dollies

After watching Big Game with
the Chicago Alumni Association,
we felt disgusted; not just because
of the terrible loss to Cal, but also
because of ESPN's broadcast.
Stanford has a longstanding tradi
tion of departing from standard
college sports pageantry: Rather
than making Homecoming floats,
we have Gaieties; rather than
marching, our band scatters; and
rather than cheerleaders, we have
Dollies. It is on this last point that
we are writing.
During the ESPN broadcast, the
camera continued to focus on the
Stanford Competitive Cheer
Squad. Despite the initial state
ment that the cheer squad is not
going to replace the Dollies, their
presence at athletic functions draws
attention away from established
Stanford institutions. We realize
that the cheer squad does not con
trol the camera people, but they
provide a familiar focal point for
men and women who are trained to
show the excitement of the game.
However, this is not the way Stan
ford sports fans and alumni think
about our beloved Cardinal. When
we picture Big Game, we see crazy
band uniforms, the matching drum
major and Dolly outfits, and Stan
ford student excitement, none of
which were featured, further re
moving alumni from the Farm ex
perience.
We ask that the Stanford Athletic
Department limit the role of the
Stanford Competitive Cheer Squad.
Their presence detracts from indi
viduality of Stanford sports and the
character of Stanford itself.
