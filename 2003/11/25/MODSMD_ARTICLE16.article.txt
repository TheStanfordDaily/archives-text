# THE 						BOTTOM LINE
## Responding to Massachusetts ruling 
### 
Last week, the Supreme Judi
cial Court decided that the
state of Massachusetts may
not "deny the protections,
benefits and obligations conferred
by civil marriage to two individuals
of the same sex who wish to marry."
Father Patrick LaBelle, director
of the Catholic Chaplaincy at Stan
ford, provided his personal response
to this ruling:
"I am saddened by the way in
which the issue of marriage and fam
ily has become intertwined with the
issue of justice and understanding
relative to the various lifestyles
which are common in society today.
There is little doubt in my mind that
the stability of the family has been in
question for some time. The issue of
same sex unions is not at the root of
this instability. It would be unfair to
think that a stable institution has
now been attacked and is liable to
destruction because of this court de
cision. Rather, the entire denigra
tion of marriage and family by the
media generally has made it an easy
target for accusations of instability.
The Catholic Church has held con
sistently that the most sacred and
profound acts of genital sexuality re
quire the most stable and firm kind
of societal protection to be healthy
and meaningful. We have always un
derstood this to be a healthy, hetero
sexual marriage. But long before
the issue of same sex unions came on
the horizon, much of our society
began to deny this protection and
setting. So the question of stable

marriage as the foundation of our
society is a question far deeper than
questions about any one situation
which may or may not add to the in
stability of the institution. Our soci
ety needs to examine itself from
every point of view and determine
what is and is not healthy and what
does or does not contribute to
healthy sexuality. Only then can we
move to a discussion of one example
of sexual expression."
The whole point of marriage is so

that two people
can have their re
lationship recog
nized by society
and to be able to
participate in soci
ety as a single unit.
The root of the
fight for decisions
like the Mas
sachusetts ruling
is the pursuit of
societal protec-

tion, as LaBelle notes, as well as so
cietal affirmation of the union —
what would seem to be a basic
human right.
This intense debate is essentially
the reconciliation between two dif
ferent ways of being — the Chris
tian way versus everything else. It
will continue until all parties in
volved can really listen and under
stand the issues at hand. While the
realm of acceptable behavior and
tolerance for alternative lifestyles
increase, the definition of traditional
marriage within Christian society re

mains galvanized.
A student from the Lesbian, Gay,
Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT)
community at Stanford remains re
alistic about the Massachusetts
Supreme Court ruling:
"I think the celebration is prema
ture. Nationwide, the backlash has
already begun. The Massachusetts
ruling has already energized the Re
publicans into drumming up support
for an amendment to the federal
Constitution that would restrict
marriage to opposite-sex couples.
Even the leading Democratic presi
dential candidates are falling over
themselves to distance themselves
from the Massachusetts ruling, so I
don't see any broad opposition that
would defeat such a measure if and
when it is introduced."
Although the United States al
lows freedom to worship any reli
gion, all citizens must abide by laws
based on Christian values. Clearly,
the United States is not yet ready for
a departure from the Christian val
ues on which it was established, es
pecially considering that the issue is
so politically charged.
Will there come a time when all
partnerships, both heterosexual and
homosexual, are recognized under
law? Perhaps with a hefty dose of
optimism, it just might happen.
