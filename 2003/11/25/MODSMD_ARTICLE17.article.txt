# WELCOME TO WALLACE WORLD
## The birth of a four-day weekend
### 
It's a short week people â€” the
first holiday of the quarter.
While nailing down my plans
to blow out of Palo Alto for
some warmth, I'm grateful for fed
eral holidays in general and who
ever is responsible for the Thurs
day placement of Thanksgiving
specifically.
So I did some looking into the
legend of our first thanksgiving to
identify this holiday's Most Valu
able Player. Most of us think we
know the story; we played turkeys
or pilgrims in our kindergarten
Thanksgiving plays, for crying out
loud. But the history is a little dif
ferent than I remember. It turns
out, like all things American, the
truth is one part pagan, one part
spiritual, one part business and one
part completely made up.
The story starts in the New
World, of course. The Plymouth
colonists harvested their first suc
cessful planting season in June
1621. What else to do but party?
They invited some of their Native
American friends (about 90
showed up, historians believe) and
they gorged on fowl, deer, pump
kins, corn and probably a few
peace pipes for a solid week.
In a pagan spirit that doesn't re
ally fit the dour black and white
image we have of the pilgrims who
came to America to escape reli
gious persecution, there are men
tions of "entertainment." A first
hand account from Edward
Winslow, a presumed leader of the
colony, includes a description of
"exercising of arms," or the best
kind of fireworks these colonists
could muster at the time, dancing
and games. That's right. The pil
grims got jiggy with the Native
Americans.
The governor commissioned
periodic hunting parties of both
Native American and pilgrims, to
keep the apparently never-ending

buffet line stocked. Swans,
turkeys, ducks and deer "were got
ten" according to Winslow.
This feast wasn't repeated, and
it wasn't called a day of thanksgiv
ing either. These devoutly reli
gious pilgrims would consider a
day of thanksgiving to be a quiet
day prayer and fasting, and that
doesn't have the makings of a four-

day week
end.
But a
quiet day of
fasting is
how the
first record
ed obser
vance of
Thanksgiv
ing pro
ceeded in
the city of

Charlestown, Mass. in June of
1671. There was no Turkey Bowl,
no gluttony, no holiday from work
or anything that resembles today's
celebration. It was a day to count
blessings.
About 100 years later, in his
first year as president, George
Washington made it official. Mr.
Washington gets the MVP cita
tion. In addition to being the father
of our country, the first president
and a pretty great military leader
of some ill-trained farmers and
shopkeepers, Washington had the
presence of mind to put a national
day of thanksgiving on a Thursday.
Why November? We don't know.
Maybe those soldier / shopkeep
ers convinced him to set the last
Thursday in November as the day,
thus kicking off the holiday shop
ping season.
But not likely, since Washing
ton's Thanksgiving Day was a
quiet day of contemplative prayer
with no regard for commerce, can
died yams or days off work. His
proclamation reads like an elo

quent sermon, calling Americans
to unite in sincere and humble
thanks for the nation, for the end of
the Revolutionary War, the Con
stitution and all the freedoms the
recent scarcely won war bought. In
fact, the original proclamation asks
Americans to redouble efforts and
be better workers.
Abraham Lincoln moved the
day to the fourth Tuesday of
November but no one really paid
attention and continued to cele
brate on the last Thursday in
November. By the way, food and
drink started to enter the picture
around this time.
In 1939, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt moved the holiday to
the third Thursday of November
as his own kind of "New Deal" to
extend the Christmas shopping
season and boost the economy.
Different states celebrated it at dif
ferent times, and you'd think a lit
tle national unification of the day
would be a good thing. Not exact
ly-
Calendar makers, colleges and
small businesses afraid the move
would only benefit the bigger busi
nesses, united and pummeled
FDR with angry letters. Still no
one celebrated Thanksgiving on
the same day until two years later,
when Roosevelt changed the holi
day back to the fourth Thursday in
November, where it stands today.
Gravy boats, college football
and the designation of the busiest
air travel day of the year would fol
low FDR's announcement. That's
the quick history lesson. Now, go
party like a pilgrim.
