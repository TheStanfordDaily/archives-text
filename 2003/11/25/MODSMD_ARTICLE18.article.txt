## Tree clarifies the costume-stealing saga 
### WILLIAM ROTHACKER 
Good day Stanford students. This is
the Tree, William Rothacker. I would
like to clarify the story surrounding the
stolen Tree costume and its epic recov
ery and subsequent shredding. Unfortu
nately, The Daily underplayed and mis
represented the factual saga involving
the recently deceased costume. I have
agreed to conservatively present my ac
counts of the events of early Friday
morning (when we recovered it) and to
invoke self-censorship so to preserve the
credibility of The Dally and maintain its
esteemed reputation as a factual publica
tion among the Stanford community. I
do not take this responsibility lightly.
Big Game week is renowned as a time
of extreme Stanford / Cal rivalry —
often marked by the actions of specific
pathetic individuals who have waited all
year, scheming since last Big Game, on
how to show-up their counterpart across
the Bay. These Berkeley scoundrels are
often picked up by local police for deal
ing Stanford unrecoverable blows —
such as stealing irreplaceable street
signs, permanently writing "Go Bears"
in chalk on pavement and chopping
down endangered palm trees — all of
which are successful in intimidating the
student populace and crushing spirit.
However, all said heinous acts pale in
comparison to the greatest triumph over
Stanford: the theft and defacement of
the Tree costume.
The costume was stolen from a
locked storage bin on the Stanford
Band's bus while the driver purchased
food at Pier 39. The Stanford Band and
Yell Leaders had just finished rallying
along with Cal's Band, Rally Committee
(Axe Comm for Cal) and Dance Team
(Dollies for the less talented). It is now
believed that an individual from Rally
Comm picked the bus' lock and stole the
Tree in the brief window when the bus
driver was eating. Some suggested that
the bus driver was in on it, but he has a
genuine smile and says "D-money"
often, so I trust him.

Upon discovering the Tree's absence,
I promptly gathered the Tree from last
year, Andrew Parker, the year before,
Charles Armstrong, and from four years
ago, Evan Meagher, and we set out per
forming a customary wake for our lost
friend. All the past Trees spoke warmly
of their memories of freshmen year in
Smokada. Several hours into the wake,
we received an anonymous phone call in
forming us that we could have the Tree
back at a price: $300... and we had to
come pick it up in a well-lit, local place
where many people would be, behind a
Copeland's Sports in an under-construc
tion shopping mall in Berkeley. Being
several hours into the wake, we thought
it seemed like a good idea so we recruit
ed a driver and set forth.
We made one pass to survey the scene
and realized that we were grossly out
numbered. Waiting for us were 13 indi
viduals dressed in blue and gold rugby
shirts. In the bed of their truck lay a con
taminated arbol. We stopped by a truck
stop to get a red emergency fuel holder
Med with diesel and Snicker's bars for a
back-up plan, armed ourselves with base
ball bats and returned ready to rumble.
Evan got out of the car early and snuck
around the back of the shopping center.
We approached, while Chuck let a pro
longed wild Norse war cry M the air.
I demanded the safe return of the cos
tume. They said the price was $300. An
drew, being pre-law, employed the tac
tics used by the defense in Roe vs. Wade
to negotiate who we believe to be rally
committee down to $5 ... they claimed
they needed money for gas because they
all had no cash and coasted into the El
Cerrito on fumes. I mentioned that we
had actually, by chance, picked up some
diesel gasoline — all truck stops sell —
on the way and would be glad to donate
it to their cause of getting their car to the
next gas station.
Andrew then dug into his wallet and
pulled out seven $5 bills which he calcu
lated would get them more than enough
gas to get back to Cal. Adhering to the
plan, I promptly broke into a furious

Tree dance, distracting them as Evan
snuck up behind the truck and pulled the
costume into some bushes. Chuck then
stopped the Norse war cry and said,
"How do we know you're not wasting
our time, where's the costume?" All eyes
turned to the empty truck bed and then
feeding off of their confusion, Chuck un
sheathed Chocolate Lightning (his base
ball bat) while Andrew lit all seven $5
bills on fire as I drank the gasoline and
then vomited it into the flaming bills, cre
ating a 10-foot fireball that sent the van
dals running. For good measure, we put
the rest of the diesel into their truck and
drove the Tree back to Stanford.
While I danced in Andrew's Tree cos
tume on Friday at rallies all day, Andrew
and Chuck scoured the Bay Area, gath
ering materials for a new costume.We
worked throughout the night, finishing
hours before big game. Many members
of the Stanford Band helped the Trees
erect another costume and for that, the
Trees are forever grateful.
In particular, a band member named
Salami spent several hours making my
leaves . . . thank you salami . . . and
thank you for walking in on me in the
bathroom, it was exciting. The bewil
dered looks of Rally Comm as I paraded
past them in an utterly impressive tree
were priceless. I can only imagine their
thoughts as we shredded the costume
they assumed meant so very much to us.
The Cliffs Notes / moral of the factu
al story for Cal: Stop assuming we oper
ate on the same level as you do. Stanford
is not restricted to pathetic traditions (i.e.
cheering on a stuffed-animal-like mascot
which has no identity outside its cos
tume). I am the Tree. I need no costume.
I'm just one example of Stanford's irrev
erence toward conventions that other
less-original schools feel compelled to
follow. Also, I breathe fire. That's all
from me. The Tree, signing off.
