## Oh, to have a character in Gaieties like me

The motivation. The sexual innuendo. The nu
dity. I love all that it represents. Gaieties, the
prime motivator for Stanford students to get
pumped for Big Game. A chance for all kids to feel
part of a community, to join a party and, maybe, to
learn a bit about themselves.
You see friends, as I took my seat in MemAud,
I started thinking to myself, "You know Spencer,
how cool would it be to be so much involved in the
Stanford sports culture that you got mentioned in
Gaeities? Just a mention, a holler, a 'shout-out,' if
you will. How cool would that be?"
What did I get, you ask?
A whole character was based on me!
But was it Doug, the romantic lead? Was it a
random Stanford Student? Was it perhaps John
Hennessy? Oh no.

Of course, it had to be
"Spanky the Masturbating
Roommate." I hate my life.
Think that it wasn't me?
Think again.
First off, the name. Yes, yes,
my nickname is "Spanky."
Stolen from another Spencer
who had a startling resemblance
to the Little Rascal, "Spanky"
has followed me from high
school to Stanford thanks to

youthful indiscretion, a lack of self-confidence and
as my mom puts it, "poor life choices."
Second, the dorm. Gaieties' "Spanky" lived in
Branner, and his RA was named Vamsi. Hmm,
what a coincidence. I lived in Branner and my RA
was Vamsi.
Third, his choice of friends. "Spanky" hung out
with SARS, a diseased woman. Not only do I hang
out with diseased women, I... well, let's just keep
it at I "hang out" with diseased women.
Fourth, and perhaps the most damning parallel,
the masturbation. As it was, I was known for two
things during my tenure at Branner Hall. One was
serenading all the pretty ladies with my melodious
voice and heart-wrenching-Enrique-esque bal
lads. But two, two was just unfortunate.
Not even a month into my freshman year, Steve
"No, really, please stop putting me in your
columns" Myrick sent out this e-mail from my
computer:
"Hi all! I just want everyone to know that the
communal bathroom and shower situation on the
third floor has prevented me from reaching self-in
duced orgasm in the last few days. If everyone can
just do their part and not enter the third-floor
bathroom between 12:17 and 12:35 a.m. tonight,
the situation will be rectified. If everyone does
their small part, we'll all get through this together.
Thanks guys and gals!
"Signed, Spencer 'they don't call me Spanky for
nothing' Porter."
Let's just say that after that e-mail, every time I
took a shower I was under more bodily scrutiny
than a drunk freshman girl at SAE. (Bada-Boom.)
I even asked two of the show's writers, who
gave mixed reactions. Mike "hotter then waterpo
lo" Albanese claimed it was about the show's pro
ducer (a likely story), but Vamsi Adusumilli
cracked, accurately stating that "Like the movie
'Radio,' it wasn't a true story, but it was based on a
true story, in this case, you."
I thought so.
But was I mad? Was I incensed? Was I groped?
No! I was thrilled! Certainly, with my Spanky
spurring them on, Stanford kids would be utterly
psyched for Big Game. With that kind of motiva
tion, there was no way we could have a dead crowd
that is so typical at Stanford football games!
So, on Saturday morning, I was still excited (not
in that way) from the show the night before. I
showed up in battle gear for the Ink Bowl, the year
ly flag football contest between the Cal and Stan
ford newspapers. After last year's unfortunate loss,
and a shoulder injury that prevented me from quar
terbacking, I was feeling a little less than confident.
But whenever a thought like that entered my head,
I just thought, "What would Spanky do?" and I was
motivated to victory. At the end of the day, I had
scored three touchdowns, including an interception
for a score, leading The Daily to a shocking 42-0 vic
tory over the overmatched Cal "paper."
So with this victory, combined with the amaz
ingly motivating Gaieties, I thought it was a math
ematical certainty that we would win Big Game.
And at first, it looked that way, as we took an early
10-0 lead thanks to a smorgasbord of Cal
turnovers.
And how loud and energetic was the Stanford
student section? I'd like to say it was boisterous.
I'd like to say it was out of control. I'd like to say it
was loud.
Silence.
OK, maybe not total silence, but pretty damn
close. I was trying my damndest, running up and
down the aisles trying to drum up support, but I re
alized there is only so much one Spanky can do. As
Cal ticked off 28 straight points, the picture looked
bleak, the only bright spot being our last-second
touchdown, silencing the Cal crowd into a state of
confusion. (I could just see them saying, "Should
we cheer? The Game is over... but they just
scored! I hate football. Let's go protest.")
Yes, Spanky failed yet again as we lost the big
one. It wasn't the first time, and God knows it
won't be his, or my, last.

Spencer Porter, a junior, is very embarrassed that
his parents read his columns. He is going to have a
hard time looking them in the eye after this one.

Second, the dorm. Gaieties' "Spanky" lived in
Branner, and his RA was named Vamsi. Hmm,
what a coincidence. I lived in Branner and my RA
was Vamsi.
Third, his choice of friends. "Spanky" hung out
with SARS, a diseased woman. Not only do I hang
out with diseased women, I... well, let's just keep
it at I "hang out" with diseased women.
Fourth, and perhaps the most damning parallel,
the masturbation. As it was, I was known for two
things during my tenure at Branner Hall. One was
serenading all the pretty ladies with my melodious
voice and heart-wrenching-Enrique-esque bal
lads. But two, two was just unfortunate.
Not even a month into my freshman year, Steve
"No, really, please stop putting me in your
columns" Myrick sent out this e-mail from my
computer:
"Hi all! I just want everyone to know that the
communal bathroom and shower situation on the
third floor has prevented me from reaching self-in
duced orgasm in the last few days. If everyone can
just do their part and not enter the third-floor
bathroom between 12:17 and 12:35 a.m. tonight,
the situation will be rectified. If everyone does
their small part, we'll all get through this together.
Thanks guys and gals!

nothing' Porter."
Let's just say that after that e-mail, every time I
took a shower I was under more bodily scrutiny
than a drunk freshman girl at SAE. (Bada-Boom.)
I even asked two of the show's writers, who
gave mixed reactions. Mike "hotter then waterpo
lo" Albanese claimed it was about the show's pro
ducer (a likely story), but Vamsi Adusumilli
cracked, accurately stating that "Like the movie
'Radio,' it wasn't a true story, but it was based on a
true story, in this case, you."
I thought so.
But was I mad? Was I incensed? Was I groped?
No! I was thrilled! Certainly, with my Spanky
spurring them on, Stanford kids would be utterly
psyched for Big Game. With that kind of motiva
tion, there was no way we could have a dead crowd
that is so typical at Stanford football games!
So, on Saturday morning, I was still excited (not
in that way) from the show the night before. I
showed up in battle gear for the Ink Bowl, the year
ly flag football contest between the Cal and Stan
ford newspapers. After last year's unfortunate loss,
and a shoulder injury that prevented me from quar
terbacking, I was feeling a little less than confident.
But whenever a thought like that entered my head,
I just thought, "What would Spanky do?" and I was
motivated to victory. At the end of the day, I had
scored three touchdowns, including an interception
for a score, leading The Daily to a shocking 42-0 vic
tory over the overmatched Cal "paper."
So with this victory, combined with the amaz
ingly motivating Gaieties, I thought it was a math
ematical certainty that we would win Big Game.
And at first, it looked that way, as we took an early
10-0 lead thanks to a smorgasbord of Cal
turnovers.
And how loud and energetic was the Stanford
student section? I'd like to say it was boisterous.
I'd like to say it was out of control. I'd like to say it
was loud.
Silence.
OK, maybe not total silence, but pretty damn
close. I was trying my damndest, running up and
down the aisles trying to drum up support, but I re
alized there is only so much one Spanky can do. As
Cal ticked off 28 straight points, the picture looked
bleak, the only bright spot being our last-second
touchdown, silencing the Cal crowd into a state of
confusion. (I could just see them saying, "Should
we cheer? The Game is over... but they just
scored! I hate football. Let's go protest.")
Yes, Spanky failed yet again as we lost the big
one. It wasn't the first time, and God knows it
won't be his, or my, last.

Spencer Porter, a junior, is very embarrassed that
his parents read his columns. He is going to have a
hard time looking them in the eye after this one.

The motivation. The sexual innuendo. The nu
dity. I love all that it represents. Gaieties, the
prime motivator for Stanford students to get
pumped for Big Game. A chance for all kids to feel
part of a community, to join a party and, maybe, to
learn a bit about themselves.
You see friends, as I took my seat in MemAud,
I started thinking to myself, "You know Spencer,
how cool would it be to be so much involved in the
Stanford sports culture that you got mentioned in
Gaeities? Just a mention, a holler, a 'shout-out,' if
you will. How cool would that be?"
What did I get, you ask?
A whole character was based on me!
But was it Doug, the romantic lead? Was it a
random Stanford Student? Was it perhaps John
Hennessy? Oh no.

Of course, it had to be
"Spanky the Masturbating
Roommate." I hate my life.
Think that it wasn't me?
Think again.
First off, the name. Yes, yes,
my nickname is "Spanky."
Stolen from another Spencer
who had a startling resemblance
to the Little Rascal, "Spanky"
has followed me from high
school to Stanford thanks to

youthful indiscretion, a lack of self-confidence and
as my mom puts it, "poor life choices."
Second, the dorm. Gaieties' "Spanky" lived in
Branner, and his RA was named Vamsi. Hmm,
