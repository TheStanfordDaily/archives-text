# Students raise awareness with World AIDS Day observances
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Campus events ranging from dorm discussions to a
candlelight vigil marked Stanford's 14th annual obser
vance of World AIDS Day yesterday.
"Our goal each year is to raise awareness and to have
people reflect upon how HIV/AIDS has affected us, our
families and other nations," said senior Monica Lyle, the
event's main coordinator.
The events were the product of more than a month of
planning by the Stanford World AIDS Day Committee,
made up of 12 students ranging from freshman to medical
students. The committee included representatives from
various groups involved with AIDS awareness, including
the Stanford NAACP chapter, the Student Global AIDS
Campaign, Dance Marathon and Students for Interna
tional Change.
Various University departments also helped out with

the day's events. The Haas Center for Public Service,
Vaden Health Center, Stanford School of Medicine and
the Dean of Students Office were either active in the plan
ning process or were involved in the actual activities.
"We want people to be aware of how it has impacted
our world, and we want to continue to advocate for those
that are suffering from the disease," Lyle said.
The Student Global AIDS Campaign, one of the stu
dent groups on the committee, actually started off the ac
tivities on Sunday with "Eat Pizza / Save Lives," a pizza
eating contest that pitted teams of four against each other
in a race to see who could finish eight slices of Pizza My
Heart the fastest.
According to Arden Pennell, the group's education di
rector, the contest drew more than 100 competitors and
raised more than $365. At the end of the year, the Student
Global AIDS Campaign will donate the money it raises to

Students in White Plaza gave out ribbons as part of World AIDS Day. Other observances included a candlelight
vigil, a pizza eating contest and a variety of informative activities.
the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, which will use the money
to administer drugs that prevent HTV
transmission from a pregnant woman to
her child.
"We are all really happy with the
event's success and plan to hold a con
test every year," Pennell said. "Some
students enjoyed it so much that they
said we should hold one every quarter."
Not everyone was as cheerful coming
out of the competition, however.
"It was a good competition and we
played hard, but the other teams were
cheating," said sophomore Cyrus Chee.
"I think I'm going to give them a 'pizza'
my mind."
Monday's activities started off at 11
a.m. in White Plaza, where Stanford
AIDS awareness groups gave out infor
mation about the disease. Jam Pac'd
and the Cardinal Whirlwinds per
formed at the event.
"We expected more people to come
to White Plaza," Lyle said. "Neverthe
less, we had a good flow of people head
ing down to that event."
At 5:30 p.m. in Tresidder Oak West,
speakers from the Stanford Medical
School and Project Inform, a nonprofit
AIDS organization, spoke about
HIV/AIDS research and treatment.
A candlelight vigil then took place in
the courtyard of Old Union from 7 p.m.
to 8 p.m. to remember those who have
been affected by the disease. The event
featured performances by Talisman,
Testimony and the Spoken Word Col
lective.
Finally, from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., dis
cussions were held in the dorms, facili
tated by peer health educators, Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center coun
selors and volunteers with Students for
International Change in Tanzania.
"We had a problem with turnout
Since we had a lot of events going on,
and also since the event took place
near the end of the quarter," Lyle said.
"But despite all of that, turnout wasn't
bad ... the candlelight vigil was espe
cially successful. It had a good number
of people there and many of them ex
pressed positive feedback."
Stanford's observance of World
AIDS day took place about a week
before the official observance, on
Dec. 1, in order to avoid end-of
quarter conflicts.
