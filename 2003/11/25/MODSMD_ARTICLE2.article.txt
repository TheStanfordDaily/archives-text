### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Campus events ranging from dorm discussions to a
candlelight vigil marked Stanford's 14th annual obser
vance of World AIDS Day yesterday.
"Our goal each year is to raise awareness and to have
people reflect upon how HIV/AIDS has affected us, our
families and other nations," said senior Monica Lyle, the
event's main coordinator.
The events were the product of more than a month of
planning by the Stanford World AIDS Day Committee,
made up of 12 students ranging from freshman to medical
students. The committee included representatives from
various groups involved with AIDS awareness, including
the Stanford NAACP chapter, the Student Global AIDS
Campaign, Dance Marathon and Students for Interna
tional Change.
Various University departments also helped out with

the day's events. The Haas Center for Public Service,
Vaden Health Center, Stanford School of Medicine and
the Dean of Students Office were either active in the plan
ning process or were involved in the actual activities.
"We want people to be aware of how it has impacted
our world, and we want to continue to advocate for those
that are suffering from the disease," Lyle said.
The Student Global AIDS Campaign, one of the stu
dent groups on the committee, actually started off the ac
tivities on Sunday with "Eat Pizza / Save Lives," a pizza
eating contest that pitted teams of four against each other
in a race to see who could finish eight slices of Pizza My
Heart the fastest.
According to Arden Pennell, the group's education di
rector, the contest drew more than 100 competitors and
raised more than $365. At the end of the year, the Student
Global AIDS Campaign will donate the money it raises to
