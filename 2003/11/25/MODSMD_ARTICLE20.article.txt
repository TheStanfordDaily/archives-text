### WILLOREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's basketball team's
next two games come against opponents
that the Cardinal trounced at home last
year. But with junior forward Josh Chil
dress hurt, No. 20 Stanford (1-0) could still
face a tough test at UC-Irvine tonight and
at Rice on Sunday.
Neither opponent is nationally ranked,
but both are expected to post winning
records and compete for their respective
conference championships this year.
Tonight the Cardinal will travel to UC-
Irvine's Bren Center for the Anteaters'
home opener. UCI (2-1) finished fifth out
of eight teams at the Dell Black Coaches
Association tournament, losing to Illinois-
Chicago in the first round and defeating
San Diego and Ohio to win the consolation
bracket.
The Anteaters, who compete in the Big
West Conference, have won 37 of their last
42 home games, but they have never de
feated the Cardinal in four tries. Stanford
tore apart the Anteaters' defense in last
year's game at Maples Pavilion, shooting 67
percent en route to an 84-57 win.
For tonight's game, head coach Mike
Montgomery has penciled in junior Nick
Robinson as the starter at forward in place
of Josh Childress, the team's leading re
bounder and second-leading scorer last
season. Childress is suffering from a stress
reaction in his foot and it is unclear
whether he will be able to return to action
this week.
It remains to be seen whether some
one who will emerge as the team's leader
in Childress's absence, though point
guard Chris Hernandez's work ethic
makes him a prime candidate. On Satur
day in the Cardinal's opener against
Sacramento State, Hernandez scored six
points and had six assists but turned the
ball over four times.
Senior forward Justin Davis led Stan
ford with 17 points and 10 rebounds and

sophomore center Rob Little added 12
points and seven rebounds as the Cardinal
took advantage of its superior strength in
side. Those two big men could face a
tougher test against UCI, the rare team
whose starting lineup is significantly larger
than Stanford's.
Center Adam Parada, a 7-foot, 265-
pound senior, anchors the Anteaters in the
middle, while 6-foot-ll senior forward
Stanislav Zuzak leads the team in scoring
with 15.3 points per game. Guard Jeff
Gloger, a 6-foot-4 sophomore, leads the
team in rebounds, assists and steals.
In Sunday's game, the Cardinal travels
to Houston to take on Rice, whom they
beat 79-62 last year at Maples. In last year's
game, Julius Barnes made eight 3-pointers
and Matt Lottich sank six more, as the two
combined for 50 points.
Though Barnes is gone, Lottich's out
side shooting ability is complemented on
this year's team by Hernandez and sopho
more swingman Dan Grunfeld. Though
the trio struggled from long range against
Sacramento State, they showed their po
tential in making 7-of-12 against Team
Nike in the Cardinal's sole exhibition game
this year.
Montgomery said he believes Lottich
should be one of the nation's best outside
shooters this year.
At 3-0, Rice will bring a surge of mo
mentum and confidence into its home
opener after breezing through the BP Top
of the World Classic tournament in Fair
banks, Alaska. In the championship, the
Owls shut down Pacific-10 Conference op
ponent Washington State, 64-49. Rice held
the Cougars to a dismal 22.6 percent from
the floor in the second half.
Junior forward Michael Harris was
named the tournament's most valuable
player after averaging 15 points and 11 re
bounds in the three games. Harris, at 6-
foot-6, is part of an undersized inside tan
dem, along with 6-foot-9 senior Yamar
Diene. The Owls have been starting three
guards along with these two forwards.
