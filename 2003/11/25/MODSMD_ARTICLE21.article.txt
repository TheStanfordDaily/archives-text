### ANDREW ROGERS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's volleyball team
swept through the Oregon schools this week
end at Maples Pavilion, finishing with a three
game sweep of Oregon State on Friday night.
The Cardinal did not lose a single game all
weekend.
The win brought the Cardinal to 21-6 over
all, with a second-best 14-4 mark in the Pacific
10 Conference. Oregon State dropped to an
even .500 overall (15-15), with a 5-13 mark in
conference play.
While the Beavers were swept, they
proved to be a slightly more competitive team
than the Oregon Ducks the night before.
Whereas the Ducks failed to score more than
20 points in any one game, the Beavers had a
low score of 21.
Game 1 was close about halfway through,
with Stanford taking a 15-13 lead into a media
timeout on the strength of blocks by senior
middle blocker Jennifer Harvey and senior set
ter Anna Robinson. After the timeout, Stan
ford took an 18-14 lead, only to be caught by
Oregon State at 23-all. Stanford then put the
game away, going on a 7-4 run and closing it
out on a kill by senior middle blocker Sara

Dukes.
The Beavers bolted out to an early 9-5
lead in Game 2. After regaining its compo
sure, the Cardinal stormed back to take the
lead at 15-14. Oregon State took a time out,
trying to stop the Cardinal roll. The effort
was futile, as Stanford continued to set the
pace until the score was 27-22. After Oregon
State took its last timeout, the Beavers
mounted a slight charge, but junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani put the game away
with a kill, 30-26.
Neither team seemed to be able to take con
trol of Game 3 until the Cardinal put together
a four-point run to take a 15-11 lead into a
media timeout. Stanford was powered by a 7-3
run, and ultimately won the game 30-21, and
the match 3-0.
The Cardinal was once again led by Nna
mani, who tallied 18 kills while hitting over
.400 to lead both teams. Freshman outside
hitter Kristin Richards recorded her 12th
double-double of the Pac-10 season, with 13
kills and a match-high 15 digs. Dukes hit an
outstanding .727, adding seven kills and four
blocks.
For the Beavers, Anne Watts-Roberts and
Allison Lawrence led the attack with 10 kills
each. Libero K.C. Frederic had 11 digs.
The Cardinal will next see action against
No. 13 Santa Clara tonight at 7 p.m. in Santa
Clara. Following that, the Cardinal will host
the nationally-ranked Notre Dame Fighting
Irish before the football game next Saturday at
1 p.m. Both games can be heard live on KZSU,
90.1 FM.
