# Pac-10 Bowl picture looking much clearer

### JESSICA BACH DAILY BRUIN (U. CALIFORNIA-LOS ANGELES 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — The annual game
of "if" and "but" has begun again as the Pacific 10
Conference shapes up for postseason bowl berths.
But with Washington's upset over then-Pac-10 lead
er Washington State on Saturday, the bowl picture
has become a bit murky.
WSU may still have the opportunity to go to the
Rose Bowl, assuming USC plays for the national
championship in the Sugar Bowl. However, that sce
nario would be unlikely since the Cougars will likely
drop out of the BCS top-12, a requirement for BCS
bowl teams.
The Cougars will likely slip to the Holiday Bowl.
The Pac-10 has contracts with six bowls, and if
WSU does go to the Rose Bowl, all the teams
below them would move up one spot and a total of
seven teams would have an opportunity for post
season play. If not, one bowl-eligible team may be
left out.

UCLA is currently tied with Washington for sixth,
but if Oregon State loses to USC on Dec. 6, the
Beavers would fall into a three-way tie for fifth with
the Bruins and Huskies.
If OSU pulls off an upset over USC, they would be
in a three-way tie for third with Oregon and Califor
nia.
Either way, LTCLA is not guaranteed a bowl. The
Bruins will be in contention with Washington and
possibly OSU for either the Las Vegas Bowl (the
fifth-place game) or the Silicon Valley Classic (the
sixth-place game).
The two bowls will look at several factors:
how a team performs on the road (UCLA is 1-5);
the alumni base of the specific cities which the
bowls are held (for example, the Bay Area is
well-stocked with Bruin alumni, which is favor
able to the Silicon Bowl held in San Jose, Calif.);
current trends of a specific team (UCLA has lost
its past four games); and, its previous bowl
games (UCLA played at the Las Vegas Bowl last
year.)

Here's how the bowl picture is shaping up, assum
ing the Rose Bowl chooses a non-Pac-10 school and
USC beats OSU:
First place — Rose Bowl (Pasadena, Calif.): Bar
ring some upset, USC will be sent to the Sugar Bowl,
and a team from outside the Pac-10 will be chosen.
Second place — Holiday Bowl (San Diego,
Calif.): Washington State.
Third place — Sun Bowl (El Paso, Texas): Ore
gon or California, both of which are tied in the con
ference at 5-3. But Oregon has a better record over
all (9-3) than Cal (8-4), so the Ducks may have the
edge.
Fourth place — Insight.com Bowl (Phoenix,
Ariz.): The team not chosen for the Sun Bowl.
Fifth place — Las Vegas Bowl: Oregon State (as
suming a loss to USC), Washington or UCLA. All
teams would be tied at 4-4.
Sixth place — Silicon Valley Classic (San Jose,
Calif.): A choice between the last two teams left after
the Las Vegas Bowl: Oregon State, Washington or
UCLA.
