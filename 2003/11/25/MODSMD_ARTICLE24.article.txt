# Women set to take on Dons at home
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After opening the season with two consecutive wins, the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball (2-0) team will take on San Francisco (1-0) tonight at
Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal is familiar with the Dons, after a memorable visit to USF's
War Memorial Stadium last season.
Stanford came dangerously close to being upset by USF, scraping by with
a 59-57 win. In fact, the Cardinal found itself down by three with just 1:10 left
to go, but benefited from the last-minute heroics of guards Sebnem Kimya
cioglu and Kelley Suminski.
Kimyacioglu hit a three to tie things up and Suminski hit the game-winner
with 15 seconds left on the clock.
However, there is one big difference between the Cardinal team that took
the floor last year and the one the Dons will see tonight. That difference goes
by the name of Nicole Powell.
The All-American forward was forced to miss last year's matchup be
cause of a bulging disk in her back.
In just the first two games, Powell's versatility has been more than evi
dent. She is averaging 24 points and 10.5 rebounds.
The Dons return four of five starters, including dangerous junior forward
Carey Sauer and sharp-shooting sophomore guard Joy Hollirigsworth. Sauer
and Hollingsworth dropped 16 and 18 points on the Cardinal in last year's
game.
Also returning for USF are senior center Mary Jane Krueger and junior
guard Toni Russell. At 6-foot-2, Krueger provides a tough inside presence
for the Dons. She averaged nine points per game and 8.7 rebounds per game
last year.
Russell shoulders much of the ball-handling responsibility for USF and is
usually the most tenacious defender whenever she steps on the floor. She av
eraged 3.3 steals last year and had six against the Cardinal.
One major concern for the Cardinal entering into today's game is its abil
ity to rebound. Stanford has been outrebounded in each of its first two con
tests, 37-34 at Pepperdine and 36-29 against Fordham.
"Our rebounding needs to be better," Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer said.
The Cardinal's struggles on the boards are in part due to the absence of vet
eran forwards T'Nae Uriel and Azella Perryman, who have both been sidelined
with injuries. Combined the two juniors average almost 13 boards a game.
While Stanford has been suffering in terms of rebounding with out the
third-year duo, its post play has not been a glaring weakness.
"I think that bodes well for how good we could be, without those two, who
are basically starters," VanDerveer said.
The Cardinal has seen strong play down low from junior center Chelsea
Trotter and freshman Kristen Newlin.
Trotter talhed 15 points and seven rebounds in Stanford's victory over
Pepperdine, while Newlin picked up the slack against Fordham, recording a
career-high 16 points and pulling down seven boards.

In addition to attacking the boards better, the Cardinal is hoping to avoid
another slow start.
Against Pepperdine, Stanford did not look like itself until midway
through the second half when Powell led a 20-5 run that put the Cardinal
ahead for good.
On Sunday, the Rams jumped out to"a 6-0 lead, but Stanford was able to

get back on track quickly, tying things up with 13:58 to go in the first half.
The Cardinal also had some trouble with its half court offense, but Van-
Derveer believes it will begin to run more smoothly as the season progress
es.
Tipoff is set for 7 p.m. at Maples and the game will be broadcast on KZSU
90.1 FM.
