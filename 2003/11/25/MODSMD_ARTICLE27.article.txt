# Congress to explore textbook pricing

### PRIYANKA PATHAK-NARAIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In recent years, the costs of textbooks, on top
of tuition hikes and an increasing cost of living,
has strained the finances of Stanford students and
their families. Following November's news that
college textbooks are twice as expensive for
American students than their foreign counter
parts, Congressman David Wu, a member of the
House Education committee, has introduced leg
islation in the House of Representatives to re
quire an investigation of the college textbook in
dustry's pricing practices.
"The bill directs the General Accounting Of
fice to determine why American college students
often pay greater than double what overseas stu
dents pay for identical textbooks," said Cameron
Johnson, a spokesperson in Wu's office. "It will
also try to determine why college bookstores in
the U.S. are barred from buying cheaper alterna
tives that are available overseas, such as soft
cover textbooks."
Johnson said he finds it troubling that identical
textbooks can cost up to twice as much in the
Unites States than they do in Europe.
"This clearly does not make common sense. It
suggests there may be some sort of price gouging
going on." Johnson said. "Even with shipping
costs, often times (imported) books are cheaper
than they are at the local college bookstore."
Johnson explained that some students pur
chase textbooks abroad, from sources such as
Amazon's United Kingdom site, which allows
them to buy their books for less. In addition, com
panies such as Amazon sell cheaper paperback
editions of textbooks, which publishers do not
allow American college textbook stores to do.
The committee will investigate several facets
of the issue, including the average amount of
money a student spends on textbooks, the aver
age cost to produce a new textbook and whether
the price discrepancy is more common in certain
subject areas than others.
The ASSU took action earlier this year when it

announced it will initiate a used textbook service,
which will buy and sell textbooks for popular class
es. Starting on Dec. 10, the service will be available
for students to buy textbooks for classes including
Psychology 1, Chemistry 33 and Math 51.
"The net effect will be that while the ASSU
will be paying $10 more than the Bookstore for
the used textbook, it will also be selling it at $10
lower than the Bookstore," explained Natoli.
"The marginal increase vml be to cover the ad
ministrative cost. The idea is to make it a no-prof
it service."
The long-term plans are more ambitious.

"We are hoping to create an Internet-based
platform for students to buy books off each other
without anyone acting as middlemen," Natoli
said. "The model we have in mind is a sort of mini
eBay on campus for textbooks only."
The ASSU hopes to start this service by this
spring.
However, the new endeavor is not an attempt
to compete with the Bookstore.
"We aren't even trying," Natoli said. "We are
a very small alternative. We are not competition.
We are only trying to make life easier for the stu
dents."

Students buy textbooks at the Stanford Bookstore. Since news broke in November that European text
books are much cheaper than their American counterparts, organizations ranging from the U.S. government
to the ASSU are examining the discrepancy and providing other options.
