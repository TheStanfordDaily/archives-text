Assistant Prof, of Computer
Science Armando Fox and Prof,
of Developmental Biology Dr.
Roel Nusse were recently recog
nized in Scientific American as
two of the 50 best research leaders
of the year.
Fox and Nusse received dis
tinctions for their contributions to
computing and medical physiolo
gy, respectively, in the annual
issue that Scientific American's
editor in chief, John Renne, said
"offers a chance to spotlight the
incredibly deserving leaders in re
search, industry and policy."
Fox has been working on his
latest research project for two
years along with graduate student
George Candea and UC-Berkeley
Prof. David Patterson. They have
attempted to design software that
would more efficiently protect
computer networks from disas
trous crashes.
"We're trying to make recov
ery so fast that all you might notice
is a slight 'blip' in the performance
of the computer that failed," Fox
said. "Hopefully this approach
will contribute to making [our
day-to-day] systems as depend
able as society needs and de
serves."
In the past, Fox was named a
Stanford Terman Fellow, received
the ASSU Teaching Award and
was even a winner on the televi
sion game show "Win Ben Stein's
Money." But for Fox, when it
comes to research, recognition for
his work is far less important than
its actual implementation.
"To be recognized for [our
work] gives us hope that our ideas
are indeed having an impact," she
said. "It's not the award that's im
portant â€” it's knowing that the

ideas are getting out there."
Junior Marisa Tai Nicolopou
los was in Fox's freshmen seminar,
Digital Dilemmas, two years ago
and spoke candidly of his teaching
and mentoring styles.
"He's really casual, funny and
enthusiastic about computers and
their relevance to policy, the busi
ness sector and legal issues," she
said. "I really appreciated that a
Stanford computer science pro
fessor took the time to be so en
gaged with me, even though I was
a freshman."
Currently, Fox's research fo
cuses on servers, a critical part of
the Internet's infrastructure. But
in the future, he would like his
work, which is already applicable
to Internet commerce, banking
and communication systems, to
also provide the same benefits to
desktop software.
For Nusse, the award recog
nized his research on cell mole
cules that has been in progress for
over 20 years and is still ongoing.
In particular, the magazine
honored him for identifying and
purifying a factor that is necessary
to the expansion and multiplica
tion of cells. It is believed that the
results of his research could assist
those in need of a more effective
immune system and will lead to a
technique for restoring"blood cells
destroyed through chemotherapy.
Nusse said he believes his work
will also have a broader impact on
areas like tissue engineering, cell
therapy, stem cell therapy and
functional restoration.
Once a recipient of the Ful
bright Fellowship and a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences, he currently serves
on the steering committee for
the Institute for Cancer/Stem
Cell Biology at the School of
Medicine.
