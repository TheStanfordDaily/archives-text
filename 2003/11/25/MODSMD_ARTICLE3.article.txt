# TWIN WINS

### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a season of sweat and preparation, the top
ranked men's cross country team cemented its status as
one of the greatest ever assembled, and the No. 2
women's team capped its return to glory after a seven
year NCAA Championship drought.
Both teams won national championships in Waterloo,
Ind., on Monday, seven years to the day after both won ti
tles in 1996. The men won in convincing fashion despite
temperatures that dropped to 18 degrees, scoring a scant
24 points to runner-up Wisconsin's 174. The women
wrested the crown away from B YU, last year's champion,
by the slimmest of margins, scoring 120 points to BYU's
128 in an upset.
The Cardinal men took six of the top 13 spots to secure
its fourth national championship in eight years. Junior
Ryan Hall finished second overall, completing the 10-
kilometer course in 29 minutes, 15.4 seconds. Hall fin
ished 1.3 seconds behind individual champion Dathan
Ritzenhein, a sophomore from Colorado.
"To have six guys in the top 13 is unprecedented," said
head coach Andy Gerard. "From a historical perspective,
I'm not sure where we stand. I don't know how you can
compare across generations, but I do know that the guys
did a great job today in comparison to the rest of the field."
The team's 150-point margin of victory was the largest
in NCAA history, and its score was second only to
UTEP's 17 in 1981.
Six Stanford runners moved into the lead pack early
on. Halfway through the 10-kilometer race, all six were
within one second of the lead. Four Stanford runners
were within three seconds of frontrunner Ritzenhein at
the eight-kilometer mark when Hall broke away from the
main pack.
Each of Stanford's seven runners were named Ail-
Americans. Seniors Grant Robison, Ian Dobson and
Louis Luchini finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respective
ly. Seniors Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage finished
12th and 13th and senior Seth Hejny rounded out the
Stanford pack in 33rd.
Hall and Tenforde improved upon their performances
from last season, when Tenforde finished 29th and Hall
33rd. Hall seemed poised to break out after finishing sec

ond in his previous two races, the pre-NCAA meet and
the West Regional. The team needed the pair to run well
if it hoped to better last year's 47 points.
