# TWIN WINS
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a season of sweat and preparation, the top
ranked men's cross country team cemented its status as
one of the greatest ever assembled, and the No. 2
women's team capped its return to glory after a seven
year NCAA Championship drought.
Both teams won national championships in Waterloo,
Ind., on Monday, seven years to the day after both won ti
tles in 1996. The men won in convincing fashion despite
temperatures that dropped to 18 degrees, scoring a scant
24 points to runner-up Wisconsin's 174. The women
wrested the crown away from B YU, last year's champion,
by the slimmest of margins, scoring 120 points to BYU's
128 in an upset.
The Cardinal men took six of the top 13 spots to secure
its fourth national championship in eight years. Junior
Ryan Hall finished second overall, completing the 10-
kilometer course in 29 minutes, 15.4 seconds. Hall fin
ished 1.3 seconds behind individual champion Dathan
Ritzenhein, a sophomore from Colorado.
"To have six guys in the top 13 is unprecedented," said
head coach Andy Gerard. "From a historical perspective,
I'm not sure where we stand. I don't know how you can
compare across generations, but I do know that the guys
did a great job today in comparison to the rest of the field."
The team's 150-point margin of victory was the largest
in NCAA history, and its score was second only to
UTEP's 17 in 1981.
Six Stanford runners moved into the lead pack early
on. Halfway through the 10-kilometer race, all six were
within one second of the lead. Four Stanford runners
were within three seconds of frontrunner Ritzenhein at
the eight-kilometer mark when Hall broke away from the
main pack.
Each of Stanford's seven runners were named Ail-
Americans. Seniors Grant Robison, Ian Dobson and
Louis Luchini finished fourth, fifth and sixth, respective
ly. Seniors Adam Tenforde and Donald Sage finished
12th and 13th and senior Seth Hejny rounded out the
Stanford pack in 33rd.
Hall and Tenforde improved upon their performances
from last season, when Tenforde finished 29th and Hall
33rd. Hall seemed poised to break out after finishing sec

ond in his previous two races, the pre-NCAA meet and
the West Regional. The team needed the pair to run well
if it hoped to better last year's 47 points.

Junior Ryan Hall led the men's cross country team to
victory with his second-place finish.
On the women's side, junior
Sara Bei finished third overall,
running the six-kilometer course
in 19:49.1. North Carolina's Sha
lane Flanagan won the race in
19:30.4. Junior Alicia Craig fin
ished sixth, and freshmen Katy
Trotter, Arianna Lambie and
Amanda Trotter placed 21st, 24th
and 92nd, respectively to round
out Stanford's scoring.
"It was awesome to see them
fulfill all the hard work they've
put in this year," head coach
Dena Evans said. "Sara and Ali
cia led the team in aggressive
fashion like they've been doing
all year, and we got it done ...
We had gutsy performances all
down the line."
Craig's race certainly falls into

the "gutsy" category. She got stuck
in what Evans called "no-man's
land" early on when she found her
self caught between the leaders and
the chase pack, with no teammates
around. Evans said the energy Craig
was forced to expend trying to catch
up to the leaders tired her out, leav
ing her with little in reserve later in
the race.
"It was not ideal in terms of ener
gy conservation, but Alicia, being
the type of leader and the tough
competitor that she is, realized she
had to maintain a great position for
us to win the team title, and she did
that," Evans said.
Bei ran a conservative race, hang
ing with the chase pack until she
neared the finish line.
"She really turned it up around
the last turn and had a great finish,"
Evans said.
Bei, Craig, Katy Trotter and
Lambie received All-American hon
ors. Evans was named NCAA Coach

of the Year for women's cross coun
try, and Gerard received the honor
on the men's side.
For the Cardinal women, the
meet provided a taste of what is to
come. The team carries no seniors,
and it seems that things can only go
up from here.
"The girls will continue to cele
brate and support each other regard
less of who scores," Evans said.
For the Cardinal men, the race
marked the end of an era. All of the
runners who competed on Monday
— the same group that propelled
the team to a Championship in
2002 — are seniors, with the excep
tion of Hall.
Gerard, however, is confident in
the team's future.
"We have a great group of run
ners," he said. "The names won't be
familiar; they won't be the guys get
ting the headlines, but they have
great credentials. We have some
good years to come."
