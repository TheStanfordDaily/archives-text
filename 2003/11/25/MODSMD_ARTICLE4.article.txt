# Council backs Cordell's bid to serve term
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
The Palo Alto city council voted unanimously at
last night's meeting to seek legislation to allow
LaDoris Cordell, vice provost for campus relations,
to sit on the council without jeopardizing the city's
contracts with Stanford.
"I think it's critical we go forward on this legisla
tion, given the relationship of the city with Stan
ford," said council member Jim Burch.
Under Section 1090, a little-known state law, a
city council is prohibited from conducting business
with a corporation for which city council members
work. Under this law, if Cordell kept her seat, mil
lions of dollars worth of contracts between Stanford
and Palo Alto would be at risk.
The legislation proposed by the city council
would tweak that century-old law, exempting Stan
ford and other organizations that operate as non
profit organizations but are legally organized as
trusts, which conduct business as corporations.
The earliest such legislation could take place is
March 2004, and Cordell is scheduled to take her
seat in January, but the council noted that no con
tracts for the first quarter of 2004 appear to be at
risk.
According to Ariel Calonne, city attorney, the
most pressing contract negotiations — those deal
ing with land at Page Mill Road and El Camino Real
that Stanford plans to lease to the city for soccer
fields — will be postponed as of Jan. 1.
Calonne said that if Section 1090 were not
amended to make Stanford exempt and Cordell
kept her seat, the city council would not be able to
sign contracts with Stanford, nor would it be able to
negotiate contracts.
"It is not enough to have the council member resign
before the contract is signed," she said.
Members of the public voiced
their dissent with the decision to
pursue such legislation, as well as
with the prospect of Cordell keep
ing her seat on the council.
"I don't believe it is necessary or
desirable to amend California
Government Code Section 1090 to
permit agreements between the
City of Palo Alto and Stanford
while LaDoris Cordell is a member
of the city council," said Herb
Borock. "The council should re
quest to obtain an opinion of the
Attorney General regarding this
subject."
"The Attorney General could

issue an opinion before the time
when a bill enacted by the Legisla
ture and signed by the Governor
could become law," he continued.
"Courts give great weight to Opin
ions of the Attorney General."
The council also discussed other
alternatives to seeking an amend
ment to the law. Noting the recom
mendations and comments he has
received in the past week regarding
the issue, Vice Mayor Bern
Beecham said, "Let me assure you,
we've looked at every other option."
One member of the public ques
tioned Cordell's right to take her
seat.
Martin Stone, a Palo Alto resi
dent and an attorney and business
consultant, said that because of
Cordell's election, "the citizens of
this community have been effec
tively disenfranchised."

Stone said he believes it is un
ethical to allow Cordell to remain
on the council.
"She should have recognized
the problem and resigned," he said.
"I think it was inappropriate for
her to have denied the citizens all
the information they needed to
make a decision when voting. It's
quite possible if they had had all
the information, they might not
have elected her."
Stone described Cordell's image as
a "kinder, gentler" Nancy Lytle — a
former council member who was not
re-elected— and said that if Cordell
had not run "we might have seen
Nancy Lytle much higher on the list."
Lytle responded, "Council
member Cordell was very appro
priately elected. I support the elec
tion of a kinder, gentler Nancy
Lytle."
