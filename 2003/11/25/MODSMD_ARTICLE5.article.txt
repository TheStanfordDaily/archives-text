# GSC lobbies for student tax relief bill
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
College students across the country may see the bur
den of taxes on stipend checks reduced by the 2004 fiscal
year, as a result of lobbying efforts by representatives of
Stanford and other universities at the annual conference
of the National Association of Graduate-Professional
Students, held earlier this month.
Stanford was represented at the Washington, D.C.
event by Graduate Student Council member Amit Gan
guli, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering, who
met with various graduate students and legislators to gar
ner support for the recently introduced Higher Education
Affordability and Equity Act.
The bill, presented in Congress on Oct. 30 by Rep. Phil

English (Penn.), would expand incentives for education
by offering several forms of tax relief for graduate stu
dents.
"[The bill does] good without harm to anyone else,"
Ganguli said.
While the bill cloes not change the current taxes im
posed on student stipend checks, it would allow the recip
ients of those funds to claim additional deductions on
their tax returns.
The bill would make permanent the current deduction
for tuition and related costs of attendance, which are
scheduled to expire in 2005. It also adds room, board and
any special needs and disability services to this category of
deductible expenses.
For teaching assistants and other stipend recipients,
the bill increases the amount of deduc
tions permitted for contributions to ed
ucational savings accounts to $5,000 a
year to $2,000 a year. It further aids
married students by extending the
availability of such deductions joint tax
returns, according to Ganguli.
He added that the bill benefits un
dergraduate students as well as "those
in professional schools who have large
loan burdens, since they can claim
greater deductions on their loan repay
ments."
The bill also lowers taxes by
proposing equal treatment of prepaid
tuition and savings plans and educa
tional savings accounts in financial aid
need analysis, removing them from the
category of student assets.
Council Chair Steve Allison ap
plauded the bill's aims and said that
stipend amounts and living expenses
are a major concern for graduate stu
dents, though he hasn't seen "an out
cry over the fact that room and board
cannot be taken as tax deductions."
The involvement of Stanford in tax
relief advocacy has gained the most
momentum since last June, according
to Ganguli. His trip at the beginning of
the month was the fourth lobbying ef
fort on the part of the council this year.
On a February trip to Washington,
council member Surya Singh met with
several legislative aides to discuss tax
relief.
While they were sympathetic to the

issue, Singh said, none of the aides he
followed up with were willing to spon
sor the bill that is currently on the floor.
Ganguli spent much of his time in
D.C. in collective lobbying efforts with 90
other graduate students who "con
verged on Washington to meet repre
sentatives from their regions to seek their
support for this bill," he explained.
Accompanied by representatives
from the University of California sys
tem, he had the opportunity to meet
with several legislative assistants, and
eventually, with Rep. Anna Eshoo.
"She expressed her continued com
mitment to higher education and
evinced a keen interest in the bill,"
Ganguli said.
Tlie bill is undergoing budgetary
analysis in the House's Ways and
Means Committee until it is passed on
to the Congressional Budget Office.
"We have come far from where we
were about a year and a half ago when
I started getting involved," Ganguli
said, adding that having a bill on the
floor now is "actually quite a fast-track
achievement."
With the end of the year quickly ap
proaching, however, Ganguli said he is
unsure of the possibility of the bill pass
ing to take effect by the 2004 fiscal
year.
Allison echoed similar uncertainty,
noting that "very few bills move
through Congress easily, and it will
take more lobbying and co-sponsors to
get this one passed."
While the legislative debate over the
bill might take some time, Ganguli ex
pressed optimism that it will pass, due to
the enthusiasm of lobbying efforts and
the growing support for the bill.
