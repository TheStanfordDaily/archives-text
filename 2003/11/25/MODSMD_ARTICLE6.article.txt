### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program officially an
nounced plans last week to debut a new program at
Peking University in Beijing, one of China's most presti
gious universities.
"We believe that there's enormous faculty and student
interest for a program in China," said Irene Kennedy, the
associate director of the Overseas Studies Program.
Two years ago, graduating seniors were asked in a sur
vey which country they would want a new center to open
in. China was one of the top three countries listed, along
with Mexico and Spain.
Although at least one year of Mandarin will be re
quired for admission to the program, courses will be
taught primarily in English by local faculty members of
Peking University in areas such as philosophy, political
science, legal studies and literature. Classes fulfilling Gen
eral Education requirements will also be offered, along
with required Chinese language courses. There will also
be one Stanford faculty-in-residence for each quarter.
"I volunteered to be the faculty-in-residence because I
like very much teaching about China, and to be able to do
that in China, with all its resources available first-hand, is
such a wonderful opportunity," said Chinese Prof. Albert
Dien, who will be teaching in Beijing during fall quarter.
"I have been to China over 40 times in the last 20 years,
and I still find it a engrossing place. The changes the soci
ety is undergoing are momentous, and it is fascinating to
see its history in the making."
According to the OSP office, Stanford students will
live in two-person suites in an international dorm on the

Peking campus. Each suite will have two small single
rooms, a common bathroom, a color television and
phone, Internet access and air conditioning. Students will
eat in campus dining halls and will have access to the
Peking University library and sports facilities.
"I'd definitely love to go to China," said sophomore
Kevin Gao. "I was considering going through another
university's program if Stanford hadn't implemented it. I
want a unique experience, an opportunity to perfect my
Chinese and a chance to really engage myself in a country
with completely different customs, traditions and histori
cal experiences."
