# Overseas Program finalizes plans for center in Beijing
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Overseas Studies Program officially an
nounced plans last week to debut a new program at
Peking University in Beijing, one of China's most presti
gious universities.
"We believe that there's enormous faculty and student
interest for a program in China," said Irene Kennedy, the
associate director of the Overseas Studies Program.
Two years ago, graduating seniors were asked in a sur
vey which country they would want a new center to open
in. China was one of the top three countries listed, along
with Mexico and Spain.
Although at least one year of Mandarin will be re
quired for admission to the program, courses will be
taught primarily in English by local faculty members of
Peking University in areas such as philosophy, political
science, legal studies and literature. Classes fulfilling Gen
eral Education requirements will also be offered, along
with required Chinese language courses. There will also
be one Stanford faculty-in-residence for each quarter.
"I volunteered to be the faculty-in-residence because I
like very much teaching about China, and to be able to do
that in China, with all its resources available first-hand, is
such a wonderful opportunity," said Chinese Prof. Albert
Dien, who will be teaching in Beijing during fall quarter.
"I have been to China over 40 times in the last 20 years,
and I still find it a engrossing place. The changes the soci
ety is undergoing are momentous, and it is fascinating to
see its history in the making."
According to the OSP office, Stanford students will
live in two-person suites in an international dorm on the

Peking campus. Each suite will have two small single
rooms, a common bathroom, a color television and
phone, Internet access and air conditioning. Students will
eat in campus dining halls and will have access to the
Peking University library and sports facilities.
"I'd definitely love to go to China," said sophomore
Kevin Gao. "I was considering going through another
university's program if Stanford hadn't implemented it. I
want a unique experience, an opportunity to perfect my
Chinese and a chance to really engage myself in a country
with completely different customs, traditions and histori
cal experiences."

program in China five years ago, but
the efforts were cut short because of
"larger political reasons," according
to Kennedy. The connections were
re-established last January but hit
some speeds bumps when the SARS
virus hit in the spring.
"The visit we had last month was
very productive," Kennedy said.
"The university is incredibly eager to
have our students there."
Peking University is widely consid
ered one of the top universities in
China; education Web site Netbig.com
placed the school second in a recent sur
vey of China's major universities. The
school is benefiting from a major in
crease in government spending on re
search universities, resulting in a new li
brary, theater and a humanities build
ing for the school, reported

"Going abroad gives you the op
portunity to experience an interna
tional education," said Kennedy.
"This program in particular gives stu
dents the opportunity to understand
the rising power of China in the glob
al picture — economically, socially

and politically."
The Beijing program will be of
fered only in the fall and spring
quarters next year. Chinese holi
days during winter quarter make
scheduling difficult, but a winter
quarter program might be available
in 2005-2006.
"Students taking part in this pro
gram will be able to gain first-hand
experience of life and learning in an
East Asian city and nation," said His
tory Prof. Harold Kahn, who will be
teaching in Beijing during spring
quarter. "As a China scholar, this
seemed an excellent opportunity to
share what I know."
Many students expressed excite
ment about the prospect of studying
in China.
"Look at China — you've got
martial arts movies, thousands of
years of imperial dynasties, great
spicy food, booming modern cities
like Shanghai with great social
scenes, a McDonalds next to a
gourmet Szechwan restaurant, and
access to Japan, Korea, Southeast
Asia, India and Mongolia," Gao said.
"So many things to do, so many
places to see, so ridiculously much to
learn."
The deadline to apply for the fall
quarter program is Jan. 25.
