Jupiter's Great Black Spot?
A strange black spot has appeared near
Jupiter's equator. It is near the Great Red
Spot, a massive storm the size of Earth that
has been raging on Jupiter for at least three
centuries. Astronomers believe it is proba
bly an atmospheric phenomenon or, less
likely, generated by the impact of a foreign
object. Jean-Luc Dighaye, founder of the
amateur group EurAstro Association,
said, "Spots of various shades depending
on the chemical composition of the gases
involved in the process are observed from
time to time." Observers are now working
around the clock (Jupiter currently rises in
the east at 3:30 a.m.) to follow the evolu
tion of this spot to discover what it really is
and how it came about.
Finding Cause of Death using Insects
Inspired by the television show "CSI,"
Lee Goff and colleagues at Chaminade

University in Honolulu
are using insects to con
duct forensics research.
The types of insects on
a body and where they
are in terms of develop
ment can help deter
mine when a person
died. It can also help in
deciding the cause of
death and whether
there were drugs or tox-

ins involved. Courts allow this kind of ev
idence as long as it is presented objec
tively. In Hawaii, an interactive exhibit
on this field of forensics, forensic ento
mology, is open to the public. It's "a little
graphic, but [kids] see worse stuff on
prime time TV," said Goff.
Detecting Mad Cow Disease
A new, more accurate test for mad cow
disease may help save healthy cows. Tradi
tionally, when a cow is diagnosed with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE,
the scientific name for mad cow disease),
the entire cattle herd has to be incinerated.
A test developed by researchers at UCSF
can detect the presence of the BSE-causing
agent at much smaller levels than current
methods. Moreover, the test, called the
conformation-dependent immunoassay
(CDI), takes only four to five hours to pro
vide results. CDI has been used in the
fields with 11,000 cows and so far has ob
tained a perfect score.
Identified Gene for Puberty
Scientists have identified the gene criti
cal to starting puberty. The gene is not on
the X or Y sex chromosome, but instead on
chromosome 19. That means one good
copy is enough to start puberty. If two
copies — one from each parent — are de
fective, then it can be treated with hor
mones. "The discovery is an important
step in understanding the elaborate se
quence of events needed for normal sexual
maturation," said Dr. Duane Alexander,
director of the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development, which
helped pay for the studies. The studies
were conducted on families where cousins
had married each other, producing chro
mosomal abnormalities.
How Frogs Sense Prey
Physicists at the Technical University
of Munich developed a model for frogs'
neuronal system to explain how they de
tect prey. The species in question, Xeno
pus, is able to sense the ripples insects
make on the surface of the water. It does
so by relying on about 200 so-called later
al-line organs with sensory hair cells that
convert water movements into nervous
signals. From their model, the re
searchers discovered frogs' system is ro
bust, functioning even if half of its organs
are not working. The team is now plan
ning to extend their results to other
aquatic species.
A Magnet with One Pole
An international team of physicists
claims to have observed a monopole, a par
ticle with only a north or south pole. Mag
nets always have two poles, however, theo
ry says that a monopole is possible. Nobody
has found any experimental evidence for
one though. The team observed an anom
alous behavior in a ferromagnetic crystal
that can only be explained if a magnetic
monopole indeed exists. The researchers
believe they have firm ground for these con
clusions. "The laws of electromagnetism are
the starting point for every area of physics,"
team member Kei Takahashi of the Univer
sity of Geneva told Physics Web.
