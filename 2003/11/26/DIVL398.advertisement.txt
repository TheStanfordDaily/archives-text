The secret of living
It is little known today that in ancient times, when man was younger and wiser, the word
to "steal" was unknown in any language. The Masters of Wisdom then lived openly among men
and encouraged them to live without crime. No door was locked and sharing was the norm. For
long ages, in many areas, this blessed state pertained. How far from that simple splendor has
man fallen. How far from his purpose has he strayed. Man today is standing at the crossroads:
one path, the path of separation and cleavage, on which man now stands, leads unerringly to
perdition. The other beckons man towards the fulfillment of his destiny, the wonder of which
today cannot be described, a path on which man will find within himself the means of becom
ing a God.
To help men choose, to aid their judgment, the Masters are, once again, returning to a
world in which They, too, struggled and suffered as do men today, uncertain of the path and the
needed action. From Their vast knowledge and experience They will offer Their advice, and
guide men safely back from the abyss. Thus will it be, and thus will men begin again the upward
climb to the mountain top, sure in the knowledge that their Mentors, their Elder Brothers, will
not desert nor mislead them.
When men take the decision to share together the produce of this bountiful world, an
extraordinary and mysterious happening will take place: at a stroke, men will realize that
the need for war is past, the menace of terrorism will quickly disappear, the trust engendered
by sharing will make the problems facing men, environmental and territorial, resolvable in
blossoming goodwill.
Through sharing, men will realize that they are brothers, and acting as brothers in close
co-operation, will begin the process of transforming this world. Thus will God's plan for men
and planet Earth regain its momentum, and thus will men grow apace in wisdom and love. They
will rediscover the secret of living in all its simple grandeur and dignity, respecting each man's
right to be and five in harmony. They will come together in veneration of God's plan and pur
pose, and add their insight and longing for truth to the annals of men.
Maitreya and His group of Masters stand ready to help men in their hour of need.
Patiently, They await the moment when They may enter the affairs of men and, with discretion,
within the Law, give of Their bounty and aid. That moment is not far off.
