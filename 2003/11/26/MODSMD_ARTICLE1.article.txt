# Stanford hopes for luck of the Cardinal
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When two teams with 4-6 records play each other in late Novem
ber, the outcome is often meaningless. But not this Saturday.
For Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens, this weekend's game
against Notre Dame offers a chance to eclipse his predecessor, who
achieved a level of success and admiration here that Teevens has
been unable to approach.
Said predecessor — Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willing
ham — may need a win this weekend even more, because four-win
seasons are unforgivable in South Bend.
Ask the coaches, and they'll tell you this game is not about them,
it's about the players. If that were the case, though, the matchup
wouldn't be nearly as intriguing.
"I don't even really pay attention to what Notre Dame is doing,"
said senior Stanford center Drew Caylor. "I couldn't tell you what
they've done this year."
That seems to be the way Teevens wants it.
"When you start getting into additional reasons for [being moti
vated], you get yourself into a different area," Teevens said. "We
really just address the fact that we're playing Notre Dame."
The players from both teams have had plenty to focus on with
out worrying about how their opponents are doing. After rocky
starts, both the Cardinal and the Irish put together two-game win
ning streaks that brought whispers of bowl eligibility. But Notre
Dame was eliminated from contention without playing last week
end, and Stanford's loss to California snuffed out any postseason
aspirations that had managed to survive the Cardinal's 43-3 loss at
Oregon State.
Still, both teams say they are hungry for a win.
"That would bring a great deal of closure on the season," Caylor
said. "It's really the only way to go out."
A victory would be especially sweet for Caylor and his fellow se
niors, given the bitter taste left in their mouths after the Cardinal's
last two losses. The Notre Dame game is the last in a Stanford uni
form for Caylor and fellow starters Kirk Chambers, Chris Lewis,
Luke Powell, Brett Pierce, Mike Sullivan and Louis Hobson.
Notre Dame, which has one more game to play after this week
end, is anticipating an emotional opponent. But the Fighting Irish
also have their own reasons to be fired up, Willingham said.
"It will be our goal to find solutions to all of the things that have
troubled us [this season]," he said. "We'll try to fix them this week,
if at all possible."
If that seems unlikely given the myriad of difficulties that have
plagued the Irish this season — foremost has been an utterly inef
fective passing game — Willingham said attitude may be more of a
factor than people think.

"A little dose of confidence goes a very long way," he said. "It's
amazing how when you believe, you make plays."
The dose of confidence he's referring to comes from Notre
Dame's last two wins, a squeaker over Navy and a 33-14 thumping
of Brigham Young. Such wins would be taken for granted by most
Notre Dame teams, but nothing has come easily for this year's
squad.
Quarterback Carlyle Holiday, the same player who infamously
completed just l-of-17 passes in a loss to Stanford two years ago,
has been replaced by freshman Brady Quinn, but neither has man
aged much success this season. They have combined for just seven
passing touchdowns and 16 interceptions.
The offense's main bright spot has been running back Julius
Jones, who didn't enter the starting lineup until the fifth, game.
Since taking over, Jones has averaged a mighty 141 yards per game
on the ground.
Stanford's secondary will no doubt be pleased to note that Notre
Dame doesn't have any receivers close to the caliber of California's
Geoff McArthur, who torched the Cardinal for 16 catches on Sat
urday. Rhema McKnight is Notre Dame's top pass-catcher with 524
yards on 41 receptions.
On defense, Notre Dame is solid all-around, with experience on
the line, at linebacker and in the secondary. Stanford's Chris Lewis
may see a lot of junior defensive end Justin Tuck, who leads the
Irish pass rush with 9.5 sacks this season. Cornerback Vontez Duff
anchors the talented secondary.
On Stanford's side, Lewis will look to continue the success he
has found passing to freshman Mark Bradford, while junior J.R.
Lemon will carry the load at running back. The Cardinal has had a
run-first mentality this year, which in Willingham's assessment is
partly a function of Stanford's inexperienced offensive line.
"Gosh, when you look at them this year, the difficulty they seem
to have on the offensive line has maybe even changed some of
[Teevens'] thought process about what they're trying to do," Will
ingham said.
Freshman quarterback Trent Edwards, who has split time with
Lewis this season, will not be available against Notre Dame after an
injury against California forced a hospital visit.
Though both Teevens and Caylor said the team is upbeat head
ing into its final game, the head coach was candid about his attitude
toward the team's results so far this season.
'•'It's certainly a great disappointment," Teevens said. "We had
the expectation and the design to have great success. You go
through the course of your season, you don't get everything that
you want, and the important thing is how you respond to that."
The home team has won the last seven matchups in the series.
Kickoff is at 5 p.m. at Stanford Stadium, and the game will be tele
vised on ABC.

Lemon will carry the load at running back. The Cardinal has had a
run-first mentality this year, which in Willingham's assessment is
partly a function of Stanford's inexperienced offensive line.
"Gosh, when you look at them this year, the difficulty they seem
to have on the offensive line has maybe even changed some of
[Teevens'] thought process about what they're trying to do," Will
ingham said.
Freshman quarterback Trent Edwards, who has split time with
Lewis this season, will not be available against Notre Dame after an
injury against California forced a hospital visit.
Though both Teevens and Caylor said the team is upbeat head
ing into its final game, the head coach was candid about his attitude
toward the team's results so far this season.
'•'It's certainly a great disappointment," Teevens said. "We had
the expectation and the design to have great success. You go
through the course of your season, you don't get everything that
you want, and the important thing is how you respond to that."
The home team has won the last seven matchups in the series.
Kickoff is at 5 p.m. at Stanford Stadium, and the game will be tele
vised on ABC.

Sophomore running back J.R. Lemon gets stopped by California defenders durinq Saturday's Big
Game. The Cardinal hopes to rebound from its poor performance when it plays Notre Dame.
When two teams with 4-6 records play each other in late Novem
ber, the outcome is often meaningless. But not this Saturday.
For Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens, this weekend's game
against Notre Dame offers a chance to eclipse his predecessor, who
achieved a level of success and admiration here that Teevens has
been unable to approach.
Said predecessor — Notre Dame head coach Tyrone Willing
ham — may need a win this weekend even more, because four-win
seasons are unforgivable in South Bend.
Ask the coaches, and they'll tell you this game is not about them,
it's about the players. If that were the case, though, the matchup
wouldn't be nearly as intriguing.
"I don't even really pay attention to what Notre Dame is doing,"
said senior Stanford center Drew Caylor. "I couldn't tell you what
they've done this year."
That seems to be the way Teevens wants it.
"When you start getting into additional reasons for [being moti
vated], you get yourself into a different area," Teevens said. "We
really just address the fact that we're playing Notre Dame."
The players from both teams have had plenty to focus on with
out worrying about how their opponents are doing. After rocky
starts, both the Cardinal and the Irish put together two-game win
ning streaks that brought whispers of bowl eligibility. But Notre
Dame was eliminated from contention without playing last week
end, and Stanford's loss to California snuffed out any postseason
aspirations that had managed to survive the Cardinal's 43-3 loss at
Oregon State.
Still, both teams say they are hungry for a win.
"That would bring a great deal of closure on the season," Caylor
said. "It's really the only way to go out."
A victory would be especially sweet for Caylor and his fellow se
niors, given the bitter taste left in their mouths after the Cardinal's
last two losses. The Notre Dame game is the last in a Stanford uni
form for Caylor and fellow starters Kirk Chambers, Chris Lewis,
Luke Powell, Brett Pierce, Mike Sullivan and Louis Hobson.
Notre Dame, which has one more game to play after this week
end, is anticipating an emotional opponent. But the Fighting Irish
also have their own reasons to be fired up, Willingham said.
"It will be our goal to find solutions to all of the things that have
troubled us [this season]," he said. "We'll try to fix them this week,
if at all possible."
If that seems unlikely given the myriad of difficulties that have
plagued the Irish this season — foremost has been an utterly inef
fective passing game — Willingham said attitude may be more of a
factor than people think.

"A little dose of confidence goes a very long way," he said. "It's
amazing how when you believe, you make plays."
The dose of confidence he's referring to comes from Notre
Dame's last two wins, a squeaker over Navy and a 33-14 thumping
of Brigham Young. Such wins would be taken for granted by most
Notre Dame teams, but nothing has come easily for this year's
squad.
Quarterback Carlyle Holiday, the same player who infamously
completed just l-of-17 passes in a loss to Stanford two years ago,
has been replaced by freshman Brady Quinn, but neither has man
aged much success this season. They have combined for just seven
passing touchdowns and 16 interceptions.
The offense's main bright spot has been running back Julius
Jones, who didn't enter the starting lineup until the fifth, game.
Since taking over, Jones has averaged a mighty 141 yards per game
on the ground.
Stanford's secondary will no doubt be pleased to note that Notre
Dame doesn't have any receivers close to the caliber of California's
Geoff McArthur, who torched the Cardinal for 16 catches on Sat
urday. Rhema McKnight is Notre Dame's top pass-catcher with 524
yards on 41 receptions.
On defense, Notre Dame is solid all-around, with experience on
the line, at linebacker and in the secondary. Stanford's Chris Lewis
may see a lot of junior defensive end Justin Tuck, who leads the
Irish pass rush with 9.5 sacks this season. Cornerback Vontez Duff
anchors the talented secondary.

has found passing to freshman Mark Bradford, while junior J.R.
