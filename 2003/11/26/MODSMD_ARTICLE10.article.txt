Did the Pakistani intelligence agency kill
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl?
French author, journalist and diplomat
Bernard-Henri Levy will discuss this ques
tion on Monday, Dec. 1, at 4:30 p.m. in Enci
na Hall's Oksenberg Room. Levy is the au
thor of the book "Who Killed Daniel Pearl?"
which was translated into English and pub
lished in the United States two months ago.
The John S. Knight Fellowships for Pro
fessional Journalists and the Institute for In
ternational Studies are sponsoring Levy's
discussion.
"I think that Daniel Pearl was discovering
that some parts of the Pakistani intelligence
service, the Pakistani agencies, some parts of
them, some elements of it, were trading some
atomic secrets towards al-Qaeda," Levy told
CNN's Paula Zahn in September.
In his book, Levy writes that Pakistan has
positioned itself "on the one hand as a good

ally of the United States and on the other
lent itself, through its most prestigious scien
tists, to the most fearsome operations of nu
clear proliferation."
"Pakistan is the biggest rogue of all the
rogue states of today," Levy writes in his
book. "I assert that what is taking form
there, between Islamabad and Karachi, is a
black hole compared to which Saddam Hus
sein's Baghdad was an obsolete weapons
dump."
In 2002, French President Jacques Chirac
sent Levy to Afghanistan to lead a fact-find
ing mission. Levy learned of Pearl's death
while meeting with Afghan President Hamid
Karzai during the diplomatic assignment.
After the meeting , he decided to write the
book about the Pearl murder.
Pearl was abducted and killed in February
2002 at the age of 38 while researching a story
about shoe bomber Richard Reid, who at
tempted to blow up American Airlines flight
62 in December 2001. Born in Princeton, N.J.,
Pearl grew up in Los Angeles, graduated from

Stanford in 1985 with a degree in communica
tion with Phi Beta Kappa honors, and joined
the Wall Street Journal in 1990. Pearl and his
wife Mariane wed in 1999. Their only child,
Adam, was born while Pearl was held in cap
tivity.
Due to interest about Daniel Pearl among
University students and staff and the contro
versial nature of Levy's book, Knight Fellow
ship Director James Bettinger, a Communica
tion professor, decided to bring the author
here.
"Wall Street Journal reporter Steve
LeVine, who is with the Institute for Interna
tional Studies, suggested it over coffee,"
Bettinger said.
"Daniel Pearl was a Stanford graduate,"
he continued. "There's the Daniel Pearl
Memorial Internship. There's lots of interest
about Daniel Pearl here."
The discussion is free and open to the pub
lic. Levy will speak for 20 minutes, after
which there will be a question-and-answer
session with the audience.
