# Higher admit rate for legacies
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
According to a newly published research paper
by Thomas Loverro, Class of 2003, legacies are ad
mitted to college at higher rates than other students
— even if they are somewhat less qualified.
In the paper, which was published in the Stan
ford Undergraduate Research Journal, Loverro
cited a Department of Education report that
found that legacy students at Harvard averaged
35 points less on the SAT than non-legacies. Ac
cording to Loverro, Harvard's admit rate for
legacies is 40 percent versus 11 percent for gener
al applicants.
"Legacy admissions appears to be an injustice
that is propagated and explained exclusively by
the same forces that have allowed so many other
inequalities, such as aristocracy, sexism and
racism to persist: Those in power do not like re
linquishing it," Loverro said.
According to Dean of Admission Robin
Mamlet, the admit rate for legacies at Stanford is
a little over double the admit rate for the general
pool. But Mamlet attributed this to the fact that
the legacy admissions are as well qualified as the
regular admissions pool.
"No student is ever admitted simply because of
this legacy relationship, but that connection may be
a plus factor in the decision process," Mamlet said.
"The reality is that the students at Stanford who are
legacies are in fact exceptionally strong."
However, Loverro argued that there is a mon
etary incentive for universities to accept unquali
fied legacies. Alumni who donate money to Stan
ford expect something in return. Even if the
money goes to financial aid scholarships, Loverro
said legacy admissions are still "a subversion of
meritocracy."

Mamlet, on the other hand, denied the connec
tion between fundraising and admitting legacies.
"We admit students because of the contribu
tions they will make to this campus," she said. "To
assume that a legacy applicant would be admitted
to help raise money or to claim that all such ap
plicants did not present outstanding applications
would be unfair and inaccurate."
In her book, "Reflection on 100,000 Admis
sions Decision at Stanford," former Dean of Ad
mission Jean Fetter said that legacy status can
"tip the scales," although it is not the main crite
ria for admissions. Fetter added that alumni often
criticize Stanford for not being as lenient as peer
institutions when it comes to admitting legacies.
To resolve perceived problems with legacy ad
missions, Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), who
was himself a legacy admission to Harvard, has
recently proposed legislation that will force col
leges to report on the race and economic status of
first-year students who are relatives of alumni or
who were admitted early decision. Support of
that legislation is also a part of Senator John Ed
wards' presidential platform.
Although he supports Kennedy's initiative,
Loverro suggested in his research paper that even
more action is necessary. He proposed having
quotas on the number of legacy students that uni
versities can admit, and he also said that the fed
eral government should give and take away grants
based on a given university's admission's statistics.
Mamlet said she is not sure what effect
Kennedy's legislation could have if passed, but
that she is opposed to government interference in
private college admissions decisions.
"We strongly believe that an individual col
lege or university is in the best position to deter
mine who should be admitted to that particular
institution," she said.
