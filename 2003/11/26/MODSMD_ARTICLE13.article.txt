## Relay before UVA-Tech game raises money for cancer 
### JENNIFER MCDANIEL CAVALIER DAILY 
(U-WIRE) CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. â€” It takes
157 miles. 70 men. 20 hours. Eight counties. Two frater
nities. One cause.
This coming Friday, the University of Virginia and
Virginia Tech chapters of Phi Gamma Delta will partic
ipate in the first annual Run Across Virginia, a relay and
philanthropy, the brainchild of the two chapters, to ben
efit the Jimmy V Foundation for cancer research.
The game ball for Saturday's football game between
the rival Hokies and 'Hoos will leave Lane stadium in
Blacksburg at 1 p.m. Friday afternoon. Fraternity mem
bers will run with it through the night and it will arrive in
Scott Stadium by kick off on Saturday.
A bus will carry the runners, stopping each mile to
switch runners and pass off the ball. The Tech FIJI
members will run the ball the first half, and will be met
by the U.Va. chapter near Lynchburg. The bus will be
accompanied by a police escort.
The run will conclude in Charlottesville around 9
a.m., and the participants will then have time to tailgate
and relax before delivering the ball.
"All the fourth-year brothers, led by Justin Bonner,
our president, will run out of the tunnel with the ball,"
said second-year Engineering student Dan Laufer, Uni
versity chair for Run Across Virginia.
The ball will be presented on the field by the co
chairs for the race, representatives from The Jimmy V
Foundation and a national FIJI representative.
These two FIJI chapters are not the first to put on such
an event.
"We originally got the idea from the FIJIs at Georgia
and Georgia Tech, and Kansas and Kansas State,"

Laufer said. "This year will be the 25th anniversary of
the beginning of the Kansas run."
The Virginia / Virginia Tech run is different from
other runs, however. This is the first time the ball will ac
tually be run onto the field. According to Laufer, the
Georgia and Kansas events are only held from house to
house, not stadium to stadium.
It was actually the Tech chapter that brought the idea
to the attention of the Virginia chapter.
"We called U.Va. to see if they would be willing to do
the event with us," said junior Jeff Caldwell, Virginia
Tech chair of the event. "Originally we didn't think it
was going to be possible, or if we were able to make it
work, we thought we would raise $10,000."
And then it grew, Caldwell added.
And grow it did ... by upward of $20,000. Between
the two fraternities, the FIJI brothers anticipate pre
senting a check for anywhere between $35,000 and
$40,000 to The Jimmy V foundation.
Together, the FIJI chapters made their decision to
donate the funds raised to The V Foundation after care
ful consideration.
"Each house had their own charity, but we wanted to
find something that was beneficial on a universal level
and that would influence a lot of different people,"
Laufer said.
Additionally, the men wanted to find a charity that
symbolized and embodied what they were doing in their
event. The Jimmy V Foundation was perfect.
The Foundation was established in 1993 by ESPN
and late N.C. State basketball coach Jim Valvano. The
organization, whose mission is to help find a cure for
cancer by providing research grants, has raised over $27
million.
According to Laufer, not only did the group have

great connections to the sports world, but more impor
tantly, their motto, "Don't give up, don't ever give up,"
was more than fitting.
"We are basically running up a mountain," Laufer
said. "The motto will be a fitting one to run through our
heads as we run."
On the flip side of the fraternity-sponsored event,
The Jimmy V Foundation was extremely excited to hear
about the plans.
"To have these young people embrace our cause is so
gratifying. When they told us what they wanted to do we
were obviously pleased," said Nick Valvano, chief exec
utive officer of the Jimmy V Foundation. "But now, to
see what a great job they've done with the event and the
support they've received, we're overwhelmed. My
brother Jim [Valvano] loved working with young peo
ple. He would enjoy this event. I imagine, if he were
around, he'd be out there running too, laughing and lov
ing it every step of the way."
According to Laufer, the groups went about
fundraising while keeping The Jimmy V Foundation's
three steps for measuring a successful event in mind:
Amount of money raised, awareness brought to The
Jimmy V Foundation and connections made to the
Foundation.
"We tried to get the brothers to do the same thing the
V Foundation strives to do," Laufer said. "By talking to
lots of people the brothers, family and friends are all
vested in cancer research."
Each member was responsible for raising $200 any
way he could. Beyond that, the group targeted local
businesses, obtaining $50 to $300 sponsorship from local
merchants. In addition to their contribution, Blue Ridge
Mountain Sports is donating socks and hats for all of the
runners and Pete Gillen and Seth Greenberg, coaches of

the U.Va. and Virginia Tech men's basketball teams,
will give long-sleeve shirts to all the runners. Monetary
donations made businesses eligible for any range of in
centives from door signs to appearance on the Jumbo-
Tron and official run t-shirts.
The last facet of fundraising was done on Grounds
with an a capella benefit concert featuring six Universi
ty groups that raised $12,000.
"We didn't want to exclude ourselves from the U.Va.
community, but we knew that we couldn't ask for money
from students and expect to raise as much as we were
hoping for," Laufer said.
Overall, the two groups were looking to hold a suc
cessful philanthropy supporting a cause they were all
vested in, while creating a positive name for their frater
nity.
"We wanted to prove that frats aren't like what they
are on MTV," Caldwell said. "We really are out to make
a difference in the community and help others."
In addition, Laufer sees the event as unique when
compared to all other Greek philanthropies, because
not only U.Va. students were targeted.
"We felt that the U.Va. student market was pretty
saturated, but saw that the Charlottesville market was
open," Laufer said.
After raising an impressive amount of money and
working out the logistics, the men plan to hold the event
in future years, increasing its success every step of the
way.
"We'll look back on it and we won't be able to believe
that we started it," Caldwell said.
According to Laufer, "we want to make this a staple
of the Virginia/Virginia Tech football rivalry... we
want people to come to the game and expect the football
to be run onto the field."
