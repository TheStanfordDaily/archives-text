## Batch-22: Do cowboys dream of eclectic peeps? 
### 
Could it be that Hugh Hefner is
satisfying his notoriously insatiable
appetites with a different kind of
sandwich? After all, he is bereft of
the geminous embrace of his erstwhile girl
friends, the identically smile-wreathed SoCal
twins Sandy and Mandy Bentley. Hef s con
troversial new "G"(that's for "gangster," and
this is my good deed for the day for pop-cul
ture's clueless contingent) spot for the Carl's
Jr. hamburger chain, now airing nationwide,
gives a whole new meaning to "beefcake." Not
the male kind, though. Cocooned in silken
lavender pajamas, smack-dab in the middle of
a cushy set draped with stately silver fabric, the
porn pasha is not winding his aged arm around
some nth pneumatic ingenue, as one would ex
pect from reading his mag "just for the arti
cles." He's taking some time out for a chat,
mano-a-mano.
"People always ask me, 'Hey Hef, do you
have favorites?"' Hef says, facing the camera
with a bad-ol'-boy wry grin. "I tell'em no. It's
not about that."
What's it about, then? For sure, if Hugh's
standing around alone, chances are it isn't for
want of playmates. While
our Hugh's in the ring giving I

his solitary spiel, vixens
whose delivery method is
more Rhythm than
Stanislavksi purr in spurious
accents about Hefner's em
barrassment of bitches.
"He can have anything he
wants," a redhead mewls,
pouting prettily, as the cam
era frets along her lace top.
"I don't know how he makes
the choice."

"I feel for Hugh," stage-whispers another
outsize Hummel figurine (but of course she
does!), her eyes mock-widened. "It is so hard
to choose."

Now the camera pans to.... Mr. Hefner,
biting into a built-to-spill burger with the
works. Watching Mr. Hefner cramming the
mass of beef, bacon, cheese, lettuce and toma
toes into his gaping septaguarian maw, one
feels a visceral, primitive turn in the stomach,
probably not unlike that felt by ancient war
riors watching their friends sucked into the
bowels of Charybdis. It's oddly arresting visu
ally, and the couple of seconds which elapse
while Hef takes to chewing on his food seem to
last and last. Real models would never do such
a thing, instead assuming a plastic smile as they
gingerly proffered the diet-nyet food with
their fingertips.
This televised feeding frenzy simultaneous
ly fulfills a widespread dream —the opportuni
ty to gorge oneself— and a common terror —
the inability to handle it.

I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,
So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane
—King Henry IV, 2.4.49-53

What I am attempting, see, is an explication
de texte which is basically a methodical, analy
sis-based clarification of a literary work as a
text, an accumulation of observations, which
taken together, illuminate the book as a
whole. Erich Auerbach used it to elucidate
"Ulysses;" I'm using it to analyze Hef. Go fig
ure, and make it a ripe hourglass.
A porn magnate is as legitimate a "text" to
study as any bona fide schoolbook, because
even when Hef speaks his scripted lines, he re
flects the same male fantasies which, at the
helm of a huge "adult" conglomerate, he helps
create. But it's not Hefner's fascination with
the female body that is disturbing—rather, it's
his incessant quest for a new body to roll in the
hay with every time. When Hef urges the guys
to buy the Bacon Bonzo classic "Because
some guys don't like the same thing night after
night," he undermines the dream of finding
one's sexual soulmate and replaces it with
chasing an elusive sexual high that's just one
Miss February away.

They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness.

Schramm's 1982 "Silver Bullet Model"
posited the idea that "the mass media are so
powerful that they can 'inject' their messages
into the audience." When I saw the clutch of
long, ramrod-straight calla lilies (which would
put steel magnolias to shame) crowding a tall
vase near Hef's head, I knew there was a rea
son this was the only other accessory on the set
for the ad.
"Who better to deliver the message of variety
than Hugh Hefner?" said Andy Puzder, presi
dent and CEO of CKE Restaurants, Inc, which
runs Carl's Jr. "As a pop-icon, Hefner appeals to
our target audience of young, hungry guys and
credibly communicates our message of variety."
These guys may be on the prowl. But who's im
pregnating their minds with his message? It's the
intellectual way of knocking you up.
Raskolnikov recognised Nicole at once. She
was a rather tall, slim and gracefid woman, ter
ribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She
was pacing up and down in her little room,
pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
were parched and her breathing came in ner
vous broken gasps. Her eyes glittered as in fever
and looked about with a harsh immovable
stare. And that consumptive and excited face
with the last flickering light of the candle-end
playing upon it made a sickening impression.

They surfeited with honey and began
To loathe the taste of sweetness.

Raskolnikov recognised Nicole at once. She
was a rather tall, slim and gracefid woman, ter
ribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown
hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She
was pacing up and down in her little room,
pressing her hands against her chest; her lips
were parched and her breathing came in ner

and looked about with a harsh immovable
stare. And that consumptive and excited face
with the last flickering light of the candle-end
playing upon it made a sickening impression.

Could it be that Hugh Hefner is
satisfying his notoriously insatiable
appetites with a different kind of
sandwich? After all, he is bereft of
the geminous embrace of his erstwhile girl
friends, the identically smile-wreathed SoCal
twins Sandy and Mandy Bentley. Hef s con
troversial new "G"(that's for "gangster," and
this is my good deed for the day for pop-cul
ture's clueless contingent) spot for the Carl's
Jr. hamburger chain, now airing nationwide,
gives a whole new meaning to "beefcake." Not
the male kind, though. Cocooned in silken
lavender pajamas, smack-dab in the middle of
a cushy set draped with stately silver fabric, the
porn pasha is not winding his aged arm around
some nth pneumatic ingenue, as one would ex
pect from reading his mag "just for the arti
cles." He's taking some time out for a chat,
mano-a-mano.
"People always ask me, 'Hey Hef, do you
have favorites?"' Hef says, facing the camera
with a bad-ol'-boy wry grin. "I tell'em no. It's
not about that."
What's it about, then? For sure, if Hugh's
standing around alone, chances are it isn't for
want of playmates. While
our Hugh's in the ring giving I

his solitary spiel, vixens
whose delivery method is
more Rhythm than
Stanislavksi purr in spurious
accents about Hefner's em
barrassment of bitches.
"He can have anything he
wants," a redhead mewls,
pouting prettily, as the cam
era frets along her lace top.
"I don't know how he makes
the choice."

"I feel for Hugh," stage-whispers another
outsize Hummel figurine (but of course she
does!), her eyes mock-widened. "It is so hard
to choose."

Now the camera pans to.... Mr. Hefner,
biting into a built-to-spill burger with the
works. Watching Mr. Hefner cramming the
mass of beef, bacon, cheese, lettuce and toma
toes into his gaping septaguarian maw, one
feels a visceral, primitive turn in the stomach,
probably not unlike that felt by ancient war
riors watching their friends sucked into the
bowels of Charybdis. It's oddly arresting visu
ally, and the couple of seconds which elapse
while Hef takes to chewing on his food seem to
last and last. Real models would never do such
a thing, instead assuming a plastic smile as they
gingerly proffered the diet-nyet food with
their fingertips.
This televised feeding frenzy simultaneous
ly fulfills a widespread dream —the opportuni
ty to gorge oneself— and a common terror —
the inability to handle it.

I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,
So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane
—King Henry IV, 2.4.49-53

What I am attempting, see, is an explication
de texte which is basically a methodical, analy
sis-based clarification of a literary work as a
text, an accumulation of observations, which
taken together, illuminate the book as a
whole. Erich Auerbach used it to elucidate
"Ulysses;" I'm using it to analyze Hef. Go fig
ure, and make it a ripe hourglass.
A porn magnate is as legitimate a "text" to
study as any bona fide schoolbook, because
even when Hef speaks his scripted lines, he re
flects the same male fantasies which, at the
helm of a huge "adult" conglomerate, he helps
create. But it's not Hefner's fascination with
the female body that is disturbing—rather, it's
his incessant quest for a new body to roll in the
hay with every time. When Hef urges the guys
to buy the Bacon Bonzo classic "Because
some guys don't like the same thing night after
night," he undermines the dream of finding
one's sexual soulmate and replaces it with
chasing an elusive sexual high that's just one
Miss February away.
