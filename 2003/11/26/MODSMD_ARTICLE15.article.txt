# BACKDRAFT
## Military considers reinstating conscription 
### SABRINA KIPPUR 
The idea rouses bitter memories in
many who lived through the Vietnam
War. But only a few weeks ago, hints
that America's previous compulsory
draft policy appeared on the Defense
Department's Defend America Web
site, which is devoted to news about
the War on Terrorism.
The majority of Stanford students
express strong opposition to any rein
stitution of draft policy, mainly be
cause they do not support America's
presence in Iraq. Colin Anderson, a ju
nior, believes that "reinstating the
draft would be a second Vietnam for
this country," because "Bush and his
administration should not force any
one to fight and die in a war that they
don't believe in."
Professor of Political Science
David Brady thinks that the proposal
will fail. "There is no chance that the
draft will be reinstated," he said.
A November Salon.com article,
"Oiling up the Draft Machine?"
quotes the Defense Department's re
quest that Americans "Serve Your
Community and the Nation" as evi
dence that the department is moving
toward reinstating the draft. But the
Pentagon insists that reinstatement is
a possibility, not a foregone conclu
sion, notes Dave Lindorff, the article's
author.
University President John Hen
nessy said that it was difficult to antici
pate the outcome of the Defense De
partment's deliberations about bring
ing back the draft, or to guess what the
repercussions would be if the draft
were reinstated. The "draft is still quite
speculative, and experience from 30-
plus years ago is unlikely to be much
help," Hennessy said. "Hence I am un
sure of the effects. I would imagine
that the general student perception
will be quite negative. The past per
ceptions are from an earlier genera
tion and a different world situation,
[so] it is hard to say how they might
carry over."
American conscription was elimi
nated in 1973 following the Vietnam
War, and draft boards, which had is
sued conscription summons, quickly
lost their strength. The Defense de
partment, Lindorff explains, is now
calling for volunteers to join the un

derstaffed groups, and experts deem this a step toward new
draft policy. Americans do still volunteer for draft boards,
Lindorff notes, but participation remains week, with 16 per
cent of spots remaining vacant.
The only other holdover of the former draft policy is the
Selective Service System, which retains a reserve group of
American males who can be called upon to serve, in case
conscription resumes. Males, aged 18-25, both citizens and
non-citizens, must register with the service, and over 49 mil
lion men are now members.
"If a military draft becomes necessary," the Defense De
partment states, "approximately 2,000 Local and Appeal
Boards throughout America would decide which young
men... receive deferments, postponements or exemptions
from military service." If reinstatement of the draft was
green-lighted, Lindorff notes, the Selective Service System
would immediately need to establish a lottery system and
order summons, and the draft boards would approve the
conscripts. The system's formulation process could take as
long as a year.
Lebow and others speculate numerous rationales be
hind possible new draft policy, all of which implicate prob
lems in the American army currently in Iraq. Charles Pena,
senior analyst for the Cato Institute, is in favor of a draft be
cause, he claims, there is a dearth of troops available to fight
in Iraq.
The Toronto Star estimates that there are 130,000

American servicemen currently in Iraq.
Lindorff, in his article on Salon.com, indicates that Sec
retary of War Donald Rumsfeld has preferred a smaller
army, possibly to the detriment of military performance.
According to Lindorff, Washington has needed to extend
the terms of numerous troops, who had not expected to
serve in as lengthy a war.
More than eight months after President Bush declared
war, the troops' spirits seem to be falling, as well. "The U.S.
reserves are stretched thin," Harper writes in The Toronto
Star, and, he writes, "the Pentagon doesn't want to extend
the stay for troops already being asked to serve the longest
unbroken war stints since Vietnam." The state of American
troops' morale thus could influence Congress's decision
about reintroducing the draft.
The Bush administration is also losing international sup
port, according to Harper, thereby reducing the pool of al
lied troops fighting alongside Americans troops. France
and Turkey are among the many countries that have re
fused to supply troops, Turkey being the latest government
to withhold manpower.
Lindorff, however, assures bitter reception from the ma
jority of Americans to new draft policy, and suggests that
this reaction could prove more fervent than that of Ameri
cans to the Vietnam War.
He attributes this possible distinction to changes in draft
policy since 1973. These changes could prove radical, espe

daily for college students. During
the Vietnam War, Lindorff ex
plains, college students could en
roll in graduate or professional
school to evade conscription. But
\Vithin the new system, students
would be required to join follow
ing completion of the term which
they are fulfilling at the time of
their summons.
A shift in requirements repre
sents only one possible detriment
to college students. Prof. Terry
Karl of the Political Science De
partment alludes to the fervent re
sentment to the Vietnam War
among Stanford students of the
era, specifically, the first public de
struction of a draft card by the stu
dent body president at the time,
David Harris, in White Plaza.
"A draft imposes great hard
ship on students," Karl explains,
"because it adds real uncertainty
and danger to their lives."
Karl does appreciate one as
pect of a compulsory draft, name
ly, its democratic nature. She ex
plains that conscription would
summon members of all classes
and would thus affect a greater di
versity of families. This impact, ac
cording to Karl, may improve the
administration's judgment about
declaring a war "... when the
deaths of their own children might
actually be at stake."
It is exactly this democratic se
lection of conscription candidates
which is an important considera
tion, as seen by Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan. "There
will be concerns," McLennan
says, "that national decisions on
going to war be fairly shared in the
population as a whole, rather than
having the burden disproportion
ately carried by the poor and by
people of color, as they were in the
Vietnam conflict."
In this way, McLennan says,
"Past perceptions will definitely
affect present views on reinstate
ment" of the draft.
The importance of democratic
conscription was similarly stressed
by political science Prof. David
Laitin. Compulsory participation,
Laitin explains, would expand stu
dents' knowledge of current af

fairs and would force the government to assess more fully
citizens' attitudes toward engaging in war. "Stanford stu
dents would likely be outraged by and activated against
American foreign policy if the draft were reinstituted," he
says. "That is encouraging news for democracy."
Some students concede that patriotism might compel
them to join the draft. Robbie Su, a junior, explains that he
would participate if the war's premise were valid and criti
cal to the benefit of America. "Moreover if the United
States were struggling for its survival, then I'd volunteer."
Junior Ashley Carroll adds that any future draft policy
should become "gender- and sexual orientation-blind. Why
should I not have to worry about being drafted while my
male counterparts do?"
Most Stanford students and professors and most politi
cal analysts agree that a reinstatement of the draft is not
likely at this time. Morris Fiorina, professor of political sci
ence, succinctly articulates this view. "Barring the outbreak
of a war for national survival," Fiorina asserts, "I think that
the chances of a resumption of the draft are minimal. The
domestic political consequences would be negative, and the
military doesn't particularly want it."
Perhaps heeding this attitude on the part of some Amer
icans, Donald Rumsfeld still advocates elective participa
tion. Rumsfeld believes that our troops demonstrate "... a
remarkable sense of mission," which may prove more ad
vantageous to an army in wartime.

of a war for national survival," Fiorina asserts, "I think that

The idea rouses bitter memories in
many who lived through the Vietnam
War. But only a few weeks ago, hints
that America's previous compulsory
draft policy appeared on the Defense
Department's Defend America Web
site, which is devoted to news about
the War on Terrorism.
The majority of Stanford students
express strong opposition to any rein
stitution of draft policy, mainly be
cause they do not support America's
presence in Iraq. Colin Anderson, a ju
nior, believes that "reinstating the
draft would be a second Vietnam for
this country," because "Bush and his
administration should not force any
one to fight and die in a war that they
don't believe in."
Professor of Political Science
David Brady thinks that the proposal
will fail. "There is no chance that the
draft will be reinstated," he said.
A November Salon.com article,
"Oiling up the Draft Machine?"
quotes the Defense Department's re
quest that Americans "Serve Your
Community and the Nation" as evi
dence that the department is moving
toward reinstating the draft. But the
Pentagon insists that reinstatement is
a possibility, not a foregone conclu
sion, notes Dave Lindorff, the article's
author.
University President John Hen
nessy said that it was difficult to antici
pate the outcome of the Defense De
partment's deliberations about bring
ing back the draft, or to guess what the
repercussions would be if the draft
were reinstated. The "draft is still quite
speculative, and experience from 30-
plus years ago is unlikely to be much
help," Hennessy said. "Hence I am un
sure of the effects. I would imagine
that the general student perception
will be quite negative. The past per
ceptions are from an earlier genera
tion and a different world situation,
[so] it is hard to say how they might
carry over."
American conscription was elimi
nated in 1973 following the Vietnam
War, and draft boards, which had is
sued conscription summons, quickly
lost their strength. The Defense de
partment, Lindorff explains, is now
calling for volunteers to join the un

derstaffed groups, and experts deem this a step toward new
draft policy. Americans do still volunteer for draft boards,
Lindorff notes, but participation remains week, with 16 per
cent of spots remaining vacant.
The only other holdover of the former draft policy is the
Selective Service System, which retains a reserve group of
American males who can be called upon to serve, in case
conscription resumes. Males, aged 18-25, both citizens and
non-citizens, must register with the service, and over 49 mil
lion men are now members.
"If a military draft becomes necessary," the Defense De
partment states, "approximately 2,000 Local and Appeal
Boards throughout America would decide which young
men... receive deferments, postponements or exemptions
from military service." If reinstatement of the draft was
green-lighted, Lindorff notes, the Selective Service System
would immediately need to establish a lottery system and
order summons, and the draft boards would approve the
conscripts. The system's formulation process could take as
long as a year.
Lebow and others speculate numerous rationales be
hind possible new draft policy, all of which implicate prob
lems in the American army currently in Iraq. Charles Pena,
senior analyst for the Cato Institute, is in favor of a draft be
cause, he claims, there is a dearth of troops available to fight
in Iraq.
The Toronto Star estimates that there are 130,000

American servicemen currently in Iraq.
Lindorff, in his article on Salon.com, indicates that Sec
retary of War Donald Rumsfeld has preferred a smaller
army, possibly to the detriment of military performance.
According to Lindorff, Washington has needed to extend
the terms of numerous troops, who had not expected to
serve in as lengthy a war.
More than eight months after President Bush declared
war, the troops' spirits seem to be falling, as well. "The U.S.
reserves are stretched thin," Harper writes in The Toronto
Star, and, he writes, "the Pentagon doesn't want to extend
the stay for troops already being asked to serve the longest
unbroken war stints since Vietnam." The state of American
troops' morale thus could influence Congress's decision
about reintroducing the draft.
The Bush administration is also losing international sup
port, according to Harper, thereby reducing the pool of al
lied troops fighting alongside Americans troops. France
and Turkey are among the many countries that have re
fused to supply troops, Turkey being the latest government
to withhold manpower.
Lindorff, however, assures bitter reception from the ma
jority of Americans to new draft policy, and suggests that
this reaction could prove more fervent than that of Ameri
cans to the Vietnam War.
He attributes this possible distinction to changes in draft
policy since 1973. These changes could prove radical, espe

daily for college students. During
the Vietnam War, Lindorff ex
plains, college students could en
roll in graduate or professional
school to evade conscription. But
\Vithin the new system, students
would be required to join follow
ing completion of the term which
they are fulfilling at the time of
their summons.
A shift in requirements repre
sents only one possible detriment
to college students. Prof. Terry
Karl of the Political Science De
partment alludes to the fervent re
sentment to the Vietnam War
among Stanford students of the
era, specifically, the first public de
struction of a draft card by the stu
dent body president at the time,
David Harris, in White Plaza.
"A draft imposes great hard
ship on students," Karl explains,
"because it adds real uncertainty
and danger to their lives."
Karl does appreciate one as
pect of a compulsory draft, name
ly, its democratic nature. She ex
plains that conscription would
summon members of all classes
and would thus affect a greater di
versity of families. This impact, ac
cording to Karl, may improve the
administration's judgment about
declaring a war "... when the
deaths of their own children might
actually be at stake."
It is exactly this democratic se
lection of conscription candidates
which is an important considera
tion, as seen by Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan. "There
will be concerns," McLennan
says, "that national decisions on
going to war be fairly shared in the
population as a whole, rather than
having the burden disproportion
ately carried by the poor and by
people of color, as they were in the
Vietnam conflict."
In this way, McLennan says,
"Past perceptions will definitely
affect present views on reinstate
ment" of the draft.
The importance of democratic
conscription was similarly stressed
by political science Prof. David
Laitin. Compulsory participation,
Laitin explains, would expand stu
dents' knowledge of current af

fairs and would force the government to assess more fully
citizens' attitudes toward engaging in war. "Stanford stu
dents would likely be outraged by and activated against
American foreign policy if the draft were reinstituted," he
says. "That is encouraging news for democracy."
Some students concede that patriotism might compel
them to join the draft. Robbie Su, a junior, explains that he
would participate if the war's premise were valid and criti
cal to the benefit of America. "Moreover if the United
States were struggling for its survival, then I'd volunteer."
Junior Ashley Carroll adds that any future draft policy
should become "gender- and sexual orientation-blind. Why
should I not have to worry about being drafted while my
male counterparts do?"
Most Stanford students and professors and most politi
cal analysts agree that a reinstatement of the draft is not
likely at this time. Morris Fiorina, professor of political sci
