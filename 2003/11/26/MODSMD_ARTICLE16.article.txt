# Scaling the Colossus of Rhodes

QDear Answer Boy, two Stanford students were
awarded the Rhodes scholarship last weekend.
That's pretty cool. What do I have to do to win a
Rhodes scholarship?
A Back when I was a wide-eyed high school senior
enjoying my hard-won Stanford Admit week
end (well, maybe not "enjoying," per se ... I
had to live in Lag, after all), I was lured to a
Q&A session on prestigious scholarships. There, three stu
dents and a moderator tried to convince me that the Rhodes
(two years of free study at Oxford), Truman ($26,000 for any
graduate school) and other scholarships are within my grasp.
Since then, I've realized that such scholarships are a myth,
a University admissions ploy. You can't win one. I sure as

hell can't win one â€” certainly not after letting myself be
called "Answer Boy" for three months.

The Rhodes scholarship is the most
prestigious of them all. It was founded in
1902 by Cecil Rhodes, a British statesman
and all-around rich bastard. You might re
member Rhodes from founding such coun
tries as Rhodesia, the former incarnation
of Zimbabwe. Rhodes was such a stand-up
individual that even The World Book En
cyclopedia, a rather sedate and unex
citable publication, uses the words "ruth
less" and "racist" to describe him.

For this year's Rhodes contest, 963 of
the country's most stunningly brilliant young men and

women applied for 32 slots.
If you're not deterred by the sheer numbers or quality of
the applicant pool, Stanford will do all it can to help you win,
since these scholarships reflect well on the University. After
all, only four other schools (the U.S. Military Academy,
Washington University in St. Louis, Boston College and
Harvard) can boast multiple winners this year. Cal didn't
have any.
The Overseas Resource Center (a part of Bechtel) will
review your application materials and even grill you in a
mock interview to prepare you for the real thing. That is, if
you haven't been discouraged by that point.
