## State should change council law 
### 
Last week, LaDoris Cordell, vice
provost of Stanford, discovered
that her new Palo Alto City Coun
cil seat will prevent the Council
from doing business with Stanford. An an
tiquated state law does not allow city coun
cils to sign contracts with the employers of
any of its members. The negative implica
tions of the law should be obvious, as the
relationship between Stanford and Palo
Alto is vital to both parties. We believe the
state should act to change this law to allow
individuals like Cordell to participate in
city governance without limiting contract
opportunities.
There are several problems with the
state law. First, the penalty is too drastic. It
does not allow for a member to simply ab
stain from voting on any issue or contract
that may pose a conflict of interest due to
her employment. Instead, Cordell is barred
from serving on the Council, unless the
Council does not make any contracts with
the member's employer. Stanford is a criti
cal component of the Palo Alto communi
ty, and it is unrealistic to impose such a re
striction on the Council. While preventing
conflicts of interest and promoting ethics in
government are both admirable goals, this
law is overly draconian, resorting to the
harshest restrictions available.
Second, the law discourages large por

tions of Palo Alto's population from partic
ipating in city government. Any person who
works for a large company or any other
business that would contract with the city is
barred from serving. Although there is an
exception for non-profit organizations, the
law still discourages many eligible candi
dates from running, resulting in a less di
verse pool of candidates for the Council. A
law that actively discourages people from
participating in government sets a danger
ous precedent. This law does attempt to
solve the serious problem of special inter
ests infiltrating government, but the harm
caused by the law far outweighs the benefit
that might result from it.
Cordell and Stanford are not completely
free of fault in this debacle. Stanford offi
cials knew about the implications of the law
a few days before the election, and Cordell
should have known about the law by virtue
of her former position as a state judge.
While there is no evidence that this situa
tion has ever been a problem before, both
Cordell and University officials should
have been more prepared to deal with the
implications of this law.
Regardless, the state must change this
law. Or, at the very least, the state legisla
ture should grant a special exception to the
law to allow Cordell to remain on the
Council.
