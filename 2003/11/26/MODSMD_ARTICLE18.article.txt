# GSC deserves thanks for dinner
## 
### 
The Stanford campus will be empty
ing out today as students head home
for Thanksgiving. But not everyone
can afford the money or time re
quired for a short trip home, and so instead
some choose to stay on campus. For these in
dividuals, Thanksgiving can be a lonely time
instead of a celebratory one. The holiday can
also be especially rough for international stu
dents because the campus is empty and they
may have nowhere else to go.
Luckily, the Graduate Student Council has
organized a Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow at
Wilbur Marketplace for all students, faculty
and staff The buffet-style dinner will feature
options for those who like their traditional
turkey as well as for vegetarian eaters. The
council expects 1,400 to 1,500 people to attend
the event, which will certainly be a lot bigger
than even the largest of family gatherings. Un
fortunately, registration for the dinner is
closed because so many people have signed
up, but the fact that the spots disappeared so

quickly is a testament to the success and popu
larity of the dinner and the fact that it is some
thing important to students.
The council is doing many students a won
derful service, and it is providing the dinner de
spite funding hurdles. The council itself will
cover about 35 percent of the dinner's expens
es, making it the largest contributor to the
event. Among others, the University's aca
demic schools, the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion, the Graduate Programming Board and
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate are co
sponsors of the dinner. Their involvement is
integral to making the dinner a success and
their efforts should be applauded.
Creating a community feeling on campus
any time of year can be quite a challenge, let
alone making people feel at home when the
classrooms are empty. But the Graduate Stu
dent Council and other sponsors of the Thanks
giving dinner are doing their best to make sure
every Stanford student feels at home this holi
day weekend. For this, they deserve our thanks.
