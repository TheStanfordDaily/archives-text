# Struggling teams share more than Willingham
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
If Stanford fans are miffed that the Car
dinal football team has struggled since for
mer head coach Tyrone Willingham left,
they can at least take consolation in the fact
that Notre Dame hasn't fared any better
this year.
After going 10-3 last year — including
an emotionally-stirring 31-7 victory over
Stanford in South Bend, Ind. — the Fight
ing Irish are in the midst of their worst sea
son in years, and have the exact same record
(4-6) as Stanford.
Should the Irish fail to win their last two
games, they would have the team's worst
record since 1963, when a 2-7 season cost
Joe Kuharich his job.
Willingham's job security is not in ques
tion — nor are his team's bowl hopes.
A year after playing in the Gator Bowl,
Notre Dame was officially eliminated from
the Big East bowl alignment in which it par
ticipates, meaning that the Irish, like the
Cardinal, will be spending the holidays at
home this year.
So, what happened?
Well, suffice it to say that the Notre
Dame-Stanford connection runs pretty
deep. Many of the same things that have
held Stanford back this year have, in fact,
held Notre Dame back as well.
Notre Dame, of course, plays a difficult
schedule. Of its six losses, four have come at
the hands of nationally-ranked teams.
Notre Dame has also struggled with inexpe
rience at key positions.
In addition to roster cuts made by Will
ingham after his arrival in 2002 for disciplinary and other
reasons, the Irish roster was further weakened by senior
departures after last year.
Four of the team's five starting offensive linemen last
year were lost to the NFL Draft, and the line's lone
holdover as well as its top tight end have both suffered
season-ending injuries, leaving Notre Dame with one of
the most inexperienced offensive fronts in the nation.
Stanford itself returned just one starter from last
year's offensive line, senior tackle Kirk Chambers, and
12 of the 16 offensive linemen on the roster are true or
redshirt freshmen.
And, just as Stanford senior Chris Lewis lost the start
ing quarterback job to freshman Trent Edwards for a
time this season, Notre Dame's freshman Brady Quhin
won the job from senior Carlyle Holiday early in the sea
son — and will start Saturday's game at Stanford. Quinn
has struggled mightily, throwing twice as many intercep
tion (12) as touchdowns (6) and completing just 46 per
cent of his passes.
Like the Cardinal, Notre Dame has relied heavily on
its running game this year. Senior Julius Jones is four
yards shy of 1,000 on the season, but hasn't been able to
generate enough offense on his own to keep the Irish of
fense in the game against top opponents.
And, like Stanford, Notre Dame's biggest strength is
its strong, veteran defense, which surrenders just 337
yards per game.
Notre Dame's season opened encouragingly, when a
20-point fourth quarter lifted the Irish to a 29-26 come
back win over No. 16 Washington State in overtime.
The very next week, though, Michigan shut out the
Irish, 38-0, as Chris Perry scored four touchdowns for the
No. 5 Wolverines.
It was largely downhill from there for Notre Dame,
which sandwiched five losses — including a 37-0 loss to
visiting No. 9 Florida State — around an encouraging 20-
14 win over a No. 20 Pittsburgh squad.
The last two games have witnessed a narrow Irish win
over Navy and a comfortable victory over Brigham
Young — a streak that gives Notre Dame some positive
momentum closing out a season that got off to a 2-6 start.
Like Stanford, the Irish have had their share of inaus
picious flirtations with the record book this year.
The Irish have been beaten by 31 or more points 20
times in its history — including four times in just the last
10 games.
Notre Dame came up scoreless against Michigan
for the first time in 101 years, while the loss to Florida
State was the second-worst home loss in the school's
history.
After the loss to the Seminoles, a frustrated Willing
ham said, "I don't know if I can explain it, because if we
could, hopefully we would have had some answers prior

to this moment. We are still working. We are trying to
find out the answer to all those that that can allow us to
be a good team."
Sound familiar? It should.
After the Cardinal's loss to Cal, Teevens said, "I don't

have a complete answer ... We put ourselves in a posi
tion to have success and we couldn't [convert]."
"We're going to watch the tapes from this game and
go forward," he added. "We're going to keep working."
It's been a tough year for Teevens and Willingham,

men brought in to run established teams and facing high
expectations who have endured seasons with more dis
appointment than anything else. Should they exchange a
glance across the field of play on Saturday, it will cer
tainly be a knowing one.

Freshman tight end Patrick Danahy will try to bolster a struggling offense as Notre Dame visits Stanford on Saturday. The game will mark the first return to Stanford for Notre
Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham who left the Farm two seasons ago.
