# Struggling teams share more than Willingham

### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
If Stanford fans are miffed that the Car
dinal football team has struggled since for
mer head coach Tyrone Willingham left,
they can at least take consolation in the fact
that Notre Dame hasn't fared any better
this year.
After going 10-3 last year — including
an emotionally-stirring 31-7 victory over
Stanford in South Bend, Ind. — the Fight
ing Irish are in the midst of their worst sea
son in years, and have the exact same record
(4-6) as Stanford.
Should the Irish fail to win their last two
games, they would have the team's worst
record since 1963, when a 2-7 season cost
Joe Kuharich his job.
Willingham's job security is not in ques
tion — nor are his team's bowl hopes.
A year after playing in the Gator Bowl,
Notre Dame was officially eliminated from
the Big East bowl alignment in which it par
ticipates, meaning that the Irish, like the
Cardinal, will be spending the holidays at
home this year.
So, what happened?
Well, suffice it to say that the Notre
Dame-Stanford connection runs pretty
deep. Many of the same things that have
held Stanford back this year have, in fact,
held Notre Dame back as well.
Notre Dame, of course, plays a difficult
schedule. Of its six losses, four have come at
the hands of nationally-ranked teams.
Notre Dame has also struggled with inexpe
rience at key positions.
