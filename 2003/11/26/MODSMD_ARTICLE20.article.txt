## DOWN UNDER Lessons learned down under in Oz 
### 
Like a tidal wave crashing onto
the unsuspecting shores, finals
week has menacingly struck our
group here in Oz Land. We've
made our way back to the cosmopolitan,
urbanized world that is the major city of
Brisbane, leaving the rainforest wilder
ness perhaps at just the right time —
things were beginning to resemble
"Lord of the Flies" while we were in the
Daintree Rainforest, as coconut meat
had become a primary snacking staple
for many members of our clan.
While many of you will have Thanks
giving to look forward to — eating up
Mom's warm pumpkin pie, doing a little
holiday shopping, hanging out with your
long-lost cousins — we'll be sitting in
food courts and coffee shops studying for
our finals and working on our final pa
pers. Since our program started a week
early, we'll be ending a week early as well.
Aside from the fact that there are Christ
mas decorations everywhere (and those
ubiquitous Christmas jingles that threat
en to take over all possible brain space)
contrasting with the 80-plus degree
weather and summer clothing, it feels al
most like the end-of-the-quarter period at
Stanford; nothing to do but study.
So as I'm busily cramming in every
thing I really ever wanted to know about
Australian ecosystems (and probably
more) and trying hard not to sneak into
the shops to get in a little shopping during
my study breaks, I've been reflecting on
the other stuff we've learned while being
here. The kinds of random facts and ob
servations that will never make it into our
finals, but that have nonetheless infused
our lives as we've toured through this in
triguing country. Sadly, we'll come back
without an Australian accent, but at least
we can share some advice.
If you ever have the opportunity to
make it to the land down under (and we
all unanimously concur that you must
make the trip someday), here are some
lessons, some trivial and some quite seri
ous, that we hope we can pass along:

You'll probably never quite under
stand some things about Australia, mate,
no matter how hard you try. Take Aus
tralian fashion as an

example. Just enjoy
the streets and clubs
as you get ready for
one giant fashion
show and be pre
pared to laugh, and
even gasp. Capri
pants for guys, 80s
fashion taken to an
extreme (the only
time I'd ever wear
some of the outra

geous clothes is on
Halloween!), and pants, shorts and skirts
worn so low on the hip that they bring a
new meaning to the phrase "how low can
you go." Or the origin of their funky
phrases, such as "Bob's your uncle" or
"Going off like cheese in the hot sun." I'll
leave it up to you to figure those out.
The concept of "multiculturalism"
in Australia has nothing to do with our
interpretation of this term or the idea of
"diversity" back at in the States, and es
pecially at Stanford. Australia is much
more conservative than you would ex
pect. We were shocked to discover that
"ethnic differences" in Australia tend
to mean the differences between being
English, Irish or Scottish. Despite its
laid-back appearance, Australia's im
migration policies have traditionally
been very racist and exclusivist, some
thing that is slowly changing over the
years, but that is definitely reflected in
the demographic profile.

Don't ever underestimate the Aus
tralian's love for their beer — and their
state beer, to be exact. Forget Fosters,
the Aussie beer you see advertised in the
States, in Australia, you better be drink
ing the kind of stuff that's produced in
the region, and you better be asking for
it in the right way. If you ask for a
"schooner" of Victoria Bitters in New
South Wales (for those of you not ac

quainted with Australian geography,
Victoria and New South Wales are two
different states), well, you're pretty
much asking to be kicked out of the pub.
And speaking of underestimating
Australians, don't do it when it comes to
their adoration for "footy." "Footy"
isn't American football. In fact, it's not
even soccer. Nope, "footy" is actually
played predominantly with your hands
(go back to point number one — you'll
never understand some things about
Australia), and it is also known as rugby.
But just keep in mind that there are
three types of rugby (Aussie Rules,
Rugby Union and Rugby League), so
keep your rules straight. But don't
worry, you'll always have a great time
watching a footy game with Aussies.
You might have gone to a dorm faculty
dinner at some point during your time at
Stanford, but have you ever shared a
Bundy with your professor at a rugby
game? Let me tell you, research will be
the last thing you'll talk about. Why,
you'll be going off like cheese in the hot
sun. And if you have any Australian
friends, just be sure not to mention the
Rugby World Cup — they lost the re
cent final game to England in one un
forgettable moment.
I could go on and on, but if I did, then
none of us would have any stories and fun
facts to tell when made it back to the
Farm. Besides, I want to leave something
for you to discover when you eventually
peel yourself away from your books and
medical school plans, make the 14-hour
plane trip and explore this extraordinary
country. Here's one last bit of advice: As
a naive American, you'll have to watch
out for those noahs and mozzies when
you're swimming in the bays near Brizzie,
but besides that, no worries, mate. Can
you tell we've been here a while?

tralia anytime in the future? Don't be shy

one giant fashion
show and be pre
pared to laugh, and
even gasp. Capri
pants for guys, 80s
fashion taken to an
extreme (the only
time I'd ever wear
some of the outra

geous clothes is on
Halloween!), and pants, shorts and skirts
worn so low on the hip that they bring a
new meaning to the phrase "how low can
you go." Or the origin of their funky
phrases, such as "Bob's your uncle" or
"Going off like cheese in the hot sun." I'll
leave it up to you to figure those out.
The concept of "multiculturalism"
in Australia has nothing to do with our
interpretation of this term or the idea of
"diversity" back at in the States, and es
pecially at Stanford. Australia is much
more conservative than you would ex
pect. We were shocked to discover that
"ethnic differences" in Australia tend
to mean the differences between being
English, Irish or Scottish. Despite its
laid-back appearance, Australia's im
migration policies have traditionally
been very racist and exclusivist, some
thing that is slowly changing over the
years, but that is definitely reflected in
the demographic profile.

Don't ever underestimate the Aus
tralian's love for their beer — and their
state beer, to be exact. Forget Fosters,
the Aussie beer you see advertised in the
States, in Australia, you better be drink
ing the kind of stuff that's produced in
the region, and you better be asking for
it in the right way. If you ask for a
"schooner" of Victoria Bitters in New
South Wales (for those of you not ac

quainted with Australian geography,
Victoria and New South Wales are two
different states), well, you're pretty
much asking to be kicked out of the pub.
And speaking of underestimating
Australians, don't do it when it comes to
their adoration for "footy." "Footy"
isn't American football. In fact, it's not
even soccer. Nope, "footy" is actually
played predominantly with your hands
(go back to point number one — you'll
never understand some things about
Australia), and it is also known as rugby.
But just keep in mind that there are
three types of rugby (Aussie Rules,
Rugby Union and Rugby League), so
keep your rules straight. But don't
worry, you'll always have a great time
watching a footy game with Aussies.
You might have gone to a dorm faculty
dinner at some point during your time at
Stanford, but have you ever shared a
Bundy with your professor at a rugby
game? Let me tell you, research will be
the last thing you'll talk about. Why,
you'll be going off like cheese in the hot
sun. And if you have any Australian
friends, just be sure not to mention the
Rugby World Cup — they lost the re
cent final game to England in one un
forgettable moment.
I could go on and on, but if I did, then
none of us would have any stories and fun
facts to tell when made it back to the
Farm. Besides, I want to leave something
for you to discover when you eventually
peel yourself away from your books and
medical school plans, make the 14-hour
plane trip and explore this extraordinary
country. Here's one last bit of advice: As
a naive American, you'll have to watch
out for those noahs and mozzies when
you're swimming in the bays near Brizzie,
but besides that, no worries, mate. Can
you tell we've been here a while?

Like a tidal wave crashing onto
the unsuspecting shores, finals
week has menacingly struck our
group here in Oz Land. We've
made our way back to the cosmopolitan,
urbanized world that is the major city of
Brisbane, leaving the rainforest wilder
ness perhaps at just the right time —
things were beginning to resemble
"Lord of the Flies" while we were in the
Daintree Rainforest, as coconut meat
had become a primary snacking staple
for many members of our clan.
While many of you will have Thanks
giving to look forward to — eating up
Mom's warm pumpkin pie, doing a little
holiday shopping, hanging out with your
long-lost cousins — we'll be sitting in
food courts and coffee shops studying for
our finals and working on our final pa
pers. Since our program started a week
early, we'll be ending a week early as well.
Aside from the fact that there are Christ
mas decorations everywhere (and those
ubiquitous Christmas jingles that threat
en to take over all possible brain space)
contrasting with the 80-plus degree
weather and summer clothing, it feels al
most like the end-of-the-quarter period at
Stanford; nothing to do but study.
So as I'm busily cramming in every
thing I really ever wanted to know about
Australian ecosystems (and probably
more) and trying hard not to sneak into
the shops to get in a little shopping during
my study breaks, I've been reflecting on
the other stuff we've learned while being
here. The kinds of random facts and ob
servations that will never make it into our
finals, but that have nonetheless infused
our lives as we've toured through this in
triguing country. Sadly, we'll come back
without an Australian accent, but at least
we can share some advice.
If you ever have the opportunity to
make it to the land down under (and we
all unanimously concur that you must
make the trip someday), here are some
lessons, some trivial and some quite seri
ous, that we hope we can pass along:

You'll probably never quite under
stand some things about Australia, mate,
no matter how hard you try. Take Aus
tralian fashion as an

example. Just enjoy
the streets and clubs
as you get ready for
one giant fashion
show and be pre
pared to laugh, and
even gasp. Capri
pants for guys, 80s
fashion taken to an
extreme (the only
time I'd ever wear
some of the outra

geous clothes is on
Halloween!), and pants, shorts and skirts
worn so low on the hip that they bring a
new meaning to the phrase "how low can
you go." Or the origin of their funky

"Going off like cheese in the hot sun." I'll
