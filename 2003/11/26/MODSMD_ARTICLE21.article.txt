Cal tickets do not always cost $ 17

I just wanted to clarify your state
ment regarding the $17 Big Game tick
ets being sold to Cal students ("Ticket
price increase a 'Big' mistake," Nov.
25). Students were required to pur
chase season tickets for $49 and had the
option of adding the Big Game to that
package for an additional $17. There
fore, Cal did not find a loophole in the
agreement. A single Big Game ticket
still sold at the Cal Athletic Ticket Of
fice for $50, regardless of the buyer's
affiliation with the university. Last
week, I witnessed many students who
had not purchased season tickets show
ing up at the ticket office and paying
the full $50 for Big Game tickets. This
was the case only for those students
who had not purchased season football
tickets. Otherwise, they paid only $17
for the ticket when purchasing then
season tickets.
Despite this misinformation, I do
agree with the rest of the points you make
in your editorial. I have much respect for
Stanford as a university and as a rival. I
was disappointed to see the poor student
turnout and realized through your edito
rial what the true reason was behind it. I
remember Cal packing its student sec
tion at Stanford Stadium even during the
dismal 2001 season. Our poor record dur
ing that season didn't seem to be a deter
rent, so I'm assuming your sub-par sea
son shouldn't be either. It's a rivalry and
should always be a big sell regardless of
our teams' respective records. I hope
your athletic marketing department does
a better job in the future of creating a
more excitjpg and competitive atmo

sphere at these games.

Band does not wish Cardinal
Competitive Cheer "ill will"

We in the Band bear Cardinal Compet
itive Cheer no ill will. Responding to yester
day's letter to the editor ("Cardinal Com
petitive Cheer should not replace Dollies,"
Nov. 25), we would like to say that our lack
of TV appearance is entirely our fault.
Neither of us is a camera technician, but
we have been told that our lade of airtime
can be attributed to the term "maximal cap
tureable awesomitude." According to our
source, the Dollies are a textbook example
of this phenomenon, approximately 350
percent too splendiferous for the lens used
on Saturday. It would be impossible to pick
up the joie de vivre of Tracy Conner, the je
ne sais quoi of Veronica Spindler, the double
entendre of Claire Tobin, the walking sun
shine that is Michelle Miller or the
Churchillian resilience of Melanie Atmadja.
We understand that certain aspects of
the Cardinal spirit do not translate well to
broadcast television. The trombones, for
instance, all dressed as their favorite char
acters from the movie "Kill Bill." Due to
copyright concerns, however, the MPAA
secured a pre-emptive preliminary in
junction. Likewise, the trumpet section,
dressed in kilts a la "Braveheart," can
only be seen in the unrated director's cut
footage of the game on Cinemax. We can
only presume that it was due to the Puri
tan leanings of the FCC that we did not
see more of the Fallopian Tubas.
We apologize that the Stanford Band

does not conform to the societal stan
dards and technical limitations required
for telecast. Apparently, people are afraid
we'll crawl out of the TV and into your
home — which has only happened once
before. But, we encourage you to order
our video "College Bands Gone Wild"
because we are simply too hot for TV.

Cohen's piece not clearly written

People delight in telling us engineer
ing folk that we can't write worth beans.
Perhaps — but evidently, neither can our
peers in the humanities.
Prof. Emeritus Robert Cohen's op-ed
is an abomination to, well, itself ("Islam
can coexist with 'fatherly' old faith of Ju
daism, as well as Christianity," Nov. 24).
Never have I encountered so many super
fluous parentheticals, tangents or scare
quotes packed into so small a space. The
most enlightening text — the title —is
over even before die whole thing begins.
Curious to see whether my opinions
were merely those of a written-language
stickler and a former proofreader, I dashed
off a dispassionate one-liner to a friend in
the next dorm. His first reply: "This is the
most crap I have had to get through to read
absolutely nothing. Other people say noth
ing, only with more brevity."
Come on, fuzzies — you can do better
than that.
