## Bret's instructs Turkey Day two hand touch 
### 
The curb's one sideline, Uncle
Butch's Buick the other, past the fire
hydrant's our endzone, behind the
second telephone pole's your end
zone, no tackling — unless it's against the
LeSabre or onto the grass — one blitz per
four downs, "three-Mississippi" count to
rush the passer, four downs to score, no des
ignated QB, play until dinner. Game on.

Thanksgiving day is back.
Sure, we're not all going home for
Thanksgiving, and we're not all going to our
own homes, or our cousin's, aunt's or grand
parents' for that matter. But wherever we
end up — no matter how much Aunt
Lunette botched the turkey, Mom burnt the
yams or even how badly Dad sneezed in the
cranberry sauce — there will be football.
And with football comes several perfect
reasons to give thanks: competition, cama
raderie, and skinned knees. Here's to
Thanksgiving. And here's to Thanksgiving
football.

To begin with, you're
going to need a field. This
can be any space out of
doors — a parking lot, a
covered swimming pool or
your regular old backyard.
You need to make sure the

playing area is full of obsta
cles and prospective injury
zones such as trees, parked

cars, swing sets, bushes, walls and energetic
dogs. This will make for a highly entertaining
match, the need for a little added strategy to
end the afternoon unscathed, the potential
for some really exhilarating stories to spread
around the Thanksgiving table, and will en
sure you walk away from the holiday with at
least one scar that will enter into the family's
Thanksgiving nostalgia for many fall seasons
to come.
Once you've got your playing field and
boundaries lined up, it is important to dress
the part of the football player. That means
check the carpet-suited loafers and cornu
copia sweater at the door. You're going to
need a jersey. Favorite pro team — good
choice. You can never go wrong with a Ray
Lewis Ravens jersey, no matter what your
designated backyard football position is. If
all you've got is the high school jersey you
swiped from the equipment manager just be
fore graduation, it's better than the cornu
copia sweater.
Clothing can also be a clever decoy. Bring
a bright pinny or two to throw on your worst
teammates' backs, a clever strategic ploy to
divert your already half-tanked second uncle
on the opposing team. Switch the pinny from
player to player to divert attention accord
ingly.

Be prepared for all conditions. Thanks
giving football is neither rain-delayed nor
snowed-out. You might need to throw a win
ter coat under that jersey, or a poncho over
that lineman frame. Kneepads are a practical
decision on the concrete gridiron, but be ad
vised that your conservative aura will be
hunted down by the biggest and most primi
tive oaf the opposing team has to offer. Don't
be ashamed to slap on a pair, but be afraid.
Teammates. Choose them wisely. It's
never fun having to teach plays and two-hand
tackling to the kid sibling who'd rather be de
fragging his PC, just as it is never fun to face
off against a Warren Sapp figure who has yet
to realize the concepts of Thanksgiving fami
ly fun — two-hand touch and the three-Mis
sissippi count before you can rush rule. You
need that guy on your team, so choose wise
ly. Guy you don't need? The scientist. He can
tell you what will and won't work and can de
code defenses like he's velcroing up his
shoes, but when it comes to execution, just
call him Mr. Turnover.

Rules. Every game needs 'em, every back
yard field's got 'em. Ball goes into the thorn
bushes or the highway — the weeniest kid's
gotta go get it. That's a good rule. It puts hair
on the chest. Balls caught off walls, roofs and
cars — perfectly legal. No spitting, tackles,
no two-hand touching below the waist, no ex
cessive taunting, no physical retaliations, no
beer on the area of play, no throwing grand
ma in front of you as a lead blocker, no karate
kicks. Break a house, apartment, or car win
dow — automatic turnover. Get sacked five
times — play the rest of the game in your un
derwear. Winners get the drumsticks. What
ever they are, they gotta be good. They gotta
inspire the players to perform and they have
to retain the sacred teachings of the game.
The most important rule? Once the game
begins, all rules are out the window. You do
anything to win. This is what Thanksgiving
memories are made of, reputations are creat
ed from and family stigmas arise out of.
Uncle Phil will never forget the shiner you
gave him for pulling the Ickey shuffle on you
after he stiff-armed you into the ground
when you were 12. You never stepped out of
bounds. A hand and two fingers isn't two
hand touched. Three-Missouri count's the
same thing. A Natty Light isn't a real beer.
Anything goes, and to the thankful victor go
the spoils. Here's to Thanksgiving football.
