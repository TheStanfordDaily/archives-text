# Men easily beat UC-Irvine

### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
IRVINE, Calif. — Redshirt sophomore Chris
Hernandez re-discovered his rhythm — scoring
16 first-half points while shooting 6-of-7 from the
field, including four three-pointers — as Stan
ford beat UC-Irvine 72-59 last night.
On the back of Hernandez's impressive first
half shooting performance, the Cardinal raced to
a 24-5 lead, in a stretch where Stanford missed
only four field goals and caused numerous Irvine
turnovers.
And Hernandez did it all within the offense —
scoring on slashing layups, easy jumpers and
wide-open three-pointers. He also racked up
three assists and zero turnovers in the first 20
minutes of play. Hernandez finished with a ca
reer-high 22 points.
Hernandez's offensive success was due in part
to the Anteaters' decision to slack off him and
double-team Stanford's post players in the first
half. And once he got hot, there was nothing
Irvine could do.
They tried an aggressive man-to-man half
court defense that didn't seem to work, a 2-3 zone
that only left him open and they even tried to
pick him up full-court, which didn't seem to slow
Hernandez down either.
"Hernandez shot the ball very well," Stanford
head coach Mike Montgomery said. "I don't
know that he's ever been that open [before] but
he had good rotation [on the ball].
"[Irvine] took a gamble by playing off [Her
nandez] . . . and it didn't pay off," Montgomery
continued.

Unlike Hernandez, the Anteaters shot a dis
mal 9-for-28 from the field in the first half, going
l-for-6 from behind the arc.
"I haven't shot like that since I've been at
Stanford — since high school," Hernandez said.
"I haven't been in a groove like that before. I
won't have nights like that all the time, but hope
fully I'll be able to find my teammates for open
shots."

The Cardinal jogged into the locker room
leading 48-25, after clearly dominating an over
matched Irvine team.
The second half proved to be a different scene.
The poise that seemed to define the Cardinal
in the first half was nowhere to be found in the
second, although Irvine couldn't figure out a way
to fully capitalize. Stanford, which shot a solid 53
percent from the field in the first half, appeared
rattled and turnover-prone — forcing shots on
the offensive-end and missing easy buckets when
they were available.
A lot of Stanford's offensive struggles can be
attributed to Irvine. After the halftime break, the
Anteaters adjusted by extending their man-to
man pressure beyond the three-point line, mak
ing it difficult for Stanford to get into its offense.
And although, Irvine shot significantly better
in the second half — going 48 percent from the
field — it wasn't enough to overcome the steady
resolve of Hernandez and a balanced Cardinal
scoring-attack.
"We played hard [when we] came out, with a
lot of energy," Montgomery said. "But then we
made some mistakes late and gave up some
threes. We're making a lot of mistakes execution
wise."
To make matters worse, several Stanford play
ers struggled from the field. Senior shooting
guard Matt Lottich scored 11 points off 4-of-ll
shooting from the field. He couldn't seem to find
his stroke from behind the arc — where he went
l-for-5.
Freshman Fred Washington had a breakout
performance, scoring nine points, going 6-for-6
from the free-throw line and tallying three steals.
Stanford again played without the services of ju
nior swingman Josh Childress, who has been
sidelined with an injury to his left foot.
"We should be a little bit stronger when we get
Hernandez some more] game-experience and
Childress] back," Montgomery said.
The Cardinal will travel to Houston on Sun
day to take on unranked Rice at 3:30 p.m. Central
time.
