# Volleyball wins 3-1 over Broncos
## 
### KIM ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After finishing Pacific 10 Conference play
with two wins over the Oregon schools last
weekend, the Stanford women's volleyball
team entered its final week of regular season
play last night against South Bay rival Santa
Clara.
The match was not only a battle for Bay
Area pride, but also for national rankings, as
both teams entered the match in the Top 15 —
the Cardinal at No. 6 and the Broncos in the
No. 13 spot — and are awaiting the NCAA
brackets, which come out on Sunday at 5 p.m.
"We have had a tough schedule this year
and that has put a lot of feathers in our cap and
given us a lot of experience and made us ready
for the NCAAs," said junior outside hitter
Ogonna Nnamani. "We have to build momen
tum for the post season. It's like a new season
and we are going to have to work hard and get
better."
In game one, the Cardinal had the same
problem that it had fought through in many
matches earlier this season — it came out in
the match one step behind the Broncos. The
Cardinal, again following the pattern of many
of its matches earlier this season, stepped up
its play, winning the match in four games.
"[Santa Clara] came out really strong in
game one and they were on top of their game
and knew what to do to beat us and were exe
cuting their game plan well," Nnamani said.
"We were slow coming out and then devel
oped our instinct in games two, three and four
to take the match. They are a great team,
though, and I have great respect for the pro
gram and they've done a great job this year."
In game one, the Cardinal had only 12 kills
and eight errors on 38 attempts for a .105 hit
ting percentage as the Broncos defeated
Stanford, 30-23. Stanford was led by Nna
mani in the game, as she was responsible for

14 consecutive Cardinal points — from 7 to
22. But the team got little offense from Stan
ford's second outside hitter, freshman Kris
ten Richards, who had only one kill on 11 at
tempts for a negative hitting percentage in
the game.
Stanford and Richards turned the match
around in game two, winning the game, 30-25,
to even up the match at one game apiece en
tering the break. This turnaround was more
like the Richards that the Cardinal is used to
seeing on the court, as she was named Pac-10
Freshman of the Year yesterday. Richards
notched seven kills in game two while Nna
mani increased her match total to 13 and the
Cardinal hit .317 collectively in the game.
Games three and four unfolded in similar
fashion as the Cardinal built on the momen
tum it gained in game two — winning both
games, 30-22. Through three games, Nnamani
had 19 kills and only four errors for an impres
sive .429 hitting percentage and Richards had
upped her numbers to 14 kills and five errors
for a .310 hitting percentage. After having
mediocre games one and two, senior middle
blocker Jennifer Harvey looked more like her
self in game three with five kills — after only
having one kill in the previous two games.
Stanford ended the match outhitting Santa
Clara 67-60, outblocking Santa Clara 15-9 and
outdigging Santa Clara by two, 64-62. Leading
the all hitters in the match was Nnamani with
22 kills, while Richards was just behind her,
finishing second for the Cardinal with 19 kills.
Harvey ended the match with eight kills,
while her middle-blocking counterpart, senior
Sarah Dukes, ended the match with seven
blocks — the team high — and seven total
kills.
Stanford will next be in action on Saturday,
celebrating Senior Day and its final regular
season home match, against Notre Dame. The
match will honor the five Stanford seniors and
begins at 1 p.m.
