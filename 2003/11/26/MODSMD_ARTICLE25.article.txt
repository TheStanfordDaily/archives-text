# Powell's 28 points lead women to 75-50 win

### ERIN ARCHERD EMILY KUEHLER 
No. 6 Stanford (3-0) rolled over the
unranked University of San Francisco
(1-1) with a 75-50 victory last night at
Maples Pavilion. Senior Nicole Powell
turned in a stellar performance, pacing
the Cardinal with 28 points and seven re
bounds in 32 minutes of play.
"USF was really well prepared," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They have a very experienced team, but
we came out and got on them and never
let them get in the game in the second

half."
With a 15-point lead at the half, the
Cardinal dominated the game from the
beginning. It continued its dominance in
the second half, when it pulled ahead to
its largest lead (28), which it held three
times in the second half.
It was an exciting game to watch, de
spite Stanford's overwhelming lead, as
the Lady Dons moved the ball quickly
down the court and notched 50 points
against the nationally-ranked Cardinal.
USF was feisty on the floor, but Stan
ford's defense kept it at bay.
Stanford swapped players on and off
the court frequently throughout the

game, a tactic that allowed three players
to reach double digits in points. Junior
Kelley Suminski tallied 11 points and
sophomore Krista Rappahahn scored 10.
VanDerveer said to expect to see
more of Rappahahn on the court this
season, highlighting her strong inside
passing in last night's game against USF
and growing team confidence in her abil
ities.
"It's been great to be out with my
team playing," Rappahahn said.
Freshman Kristen Newlin only saw
five minutes of play in the first half, pick
ing up two quick fouls. Though she only
clocked 14 minutes for the game and

scored just four points, she did have 10
rebounds on the night.
The Lady Dons were fast to capitalize
on any errors by the Cardinal, profiting
off several turnovers and picks in the sec
ond half. However, in the end they were
simply overmatched by the talented Car
dinal.
Powell was 10-for-13 for the game,
contributing to 52 percent shooting for
Stanford. Though Powell is new to the
four position this year, she feels comfort
able with whatever role she's given.
"Every year it seems to be something
different," Powell said. "It doesn't mat
ter what you're playing as long as
you're contributing. Playing in
side is okay."
VanDerveer described Powell
as a catalyst for the team, improv
ing the games of all the individual
players.
"Great players make others
around them play better too," she
said. "She's an enzyme for other
people, takes their game up a
level."
The Cardinal, however, will not
have time to savor its victory.
While the rest of the country is en
joying Thanksgiving leftovers, the
squad has two weekend matchups
to worry about.
On Friday at 7 p.m., Stanford
takes on Boston (0-2) and Sunday
at 2 p.m. it will square off against
No. 11 Georgia (1-0).
Boston features a former Cardi
nal, junior Becky Bonner, who is
the Terriers' leading scorer. Bon
ner, a 6-foot-2 forward, sat out last
season due to NCAA transfer rules.
"[Transferring] was the right
thing for her," VanDerveer said.
"We want her to have good games
against other people, but not so
much against us."
Boston also returns its leading
scorer from last season — senior
guard Katie Terhune. The 6-foot
sharpshooter averaged 17.1 points
per game during last season's cam
paign.
The Terriers feature a zone de
fense similar to what the Cardinal
saw in its matchup with Fordham.

"I'm expecting a lot of zone de
fense," VanDerveer said. "We
didn't do a good job against Ford
ham, so it'll be really important
[on Friday]."
While Boston is expected to be
a challenge, the weekend's key
matchup will be with Georgia. The
Lady Bulldogs boast a frontcourt
like none other in the nation.
6-foot-5 senior Christi Thomas
and 6-foot-6 junior Kara Braxton
have not only height but also skill
on their side. The duo has proven
to be a nightmare on both ends of
the floor for any opposing team.
VanDerveer was quick to ac
knowledge the challenge posed by
the tandem of post players — es
pecially with injuries to key mem
bers of the Cardinal frontcourt
(forwards Azella Perryman and
T'Nae Thiel).
"Kara Braxton is awesome,"
VanDerveer said. "But their
guard [sophomore Alexis
Kendrick] is very good as well. We
must play a complete game, [be
cause] they are a very athletic
team."
The absence of Thiel and Per
ryman has already caused prob
lems for the Cardinal defensively.
It had trouble defending in the
post against USF, allowing 12
points to center Mary Jane
Krueger
"I thought we didn't do some
things we needed to do defensive
ly," she said. "It was called very
tight and I don't think that will be
the case against Georgia. We need
to play smarter post defense and
we'll have to rebound much bet
ter."
