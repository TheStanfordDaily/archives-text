No. 6 Stanford (3-0) rolled over the
unranked University of San Francisco
(1-1) with a 75-50 victory last night at
Maples Pavilion. Senior Nicole Powell
turned in a stellar performance, pacing
the Cardinal with 28 points and seven re
bounds in 32 minutes of play.
"USF was really well prepared," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"They have a very experienced team, but
we came out and got on them and never
let them get in the game in the second

half."
With a 15-point lead at the half, the
Cardinal dominated the game from the
beginning. It continued its dominance in
the second half, when it pulled ahead to
its largest lead (28), which it held three
times in the second half.
It was an exciting game to watch, de
spite Stanford's overwhelming lead, as
the Lady Dons moved the ball quickly
down the court and notched 50 points
against the nationally-ranked Cardinal.
USF was feisty on the floor, but Stan
ford's defense kept it at bay.
Stanford swapped players on and off
the court frequently throughout the

game, a tactic that allowed three players
to reach double digits in points. Junior
Kelley Suminski tallied 11 points and
sophomore Krista Rappahahn scored 10.
VanDerveer said to expect to see
more of Rappahahn on the court this
season, highlighting her strong inside
passing in last night's game against USF
and growing team confidence in her abil
ities.
"It's been great to be out with my
team playing," Rappahahn said.
Freshman Kristen Newlin only saw
five minutes of play in the first half, pick
ing up two quick fouls. Though she only
clocked 14 minutes for the game and

scored just four points, she did have 10
rebounds on the night.
The Lady Dons were fast to capitalize
on any errors by the Cardinal, profiting
off several turnovers and picks in the sec
ond half. However, in the end they were
simply overmatched by the talented Car
dinal.
Powell was 10-for-13 for the game,
contributing to 52 percent shooting for
Stanford. Though Powell is new to the
four position this year, she feels comfort
able with whatever role she's given.
"Every year it seems to be something
different," Powell said. "It doesn't mat
