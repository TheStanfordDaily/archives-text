# Men's water polo preps for MPSFs
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 men's water polo team (19-3,7-1 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) is poised to make its bid for a
berth in the NCAA finals by winning this weekend's
MPSF tournament. Currently on an 11-game winning
streak, the Cardinal defeated No. 3 California (19-6,5-3)
Saturday in the Big Splash.
Southern California (19-3) and the Bears are the only
teams that have bested the Cardinal this season, and
Stanford has not lost a match since its loss to the top
ranked Trojans on Oct. 11.
"We've improved a lot, and I don't know if I can say
the same thing about them," said senior utility Mike
Derse. "We've worked on defense, coming out in a hard
press, and I'm not sure if they'll be ready for it."
The MPSF tournament will be played Friday through
Sunday at the Belmont Plaza-Long Beach, near UCLA.
Stanford's first round opponent will be No. 7 UC Irvine
(12-14, 3-5). The Cardinal swamped the Anteaters 12-6
in their last meeting, on Nov. 15. In that game, sopho
more driver Thomas Hopkins and junior drivers Peter
Varellas and Tony Azevedo notched three goals apiece.
UCI's Dan Noon led the Anteaters with three goals for
the game, but they were outmatched by Stanford's of
fensive powerhouse.
Even though Stanford is ranked No. 2 in the nation, it
is not guaranteed a spot in the NCAA tournament. Only
the winner of the MPSF tournament is assured a bid to
the NCAA Finals, where four teams will face off for the
national championship. The Cardinal, Trojans and Bears
enter the MPSF tournament in a three-way tie, but the
Trojans received the top seed, having defeated both
Stanford and Cal in league play. Southern California will
probably battle Cal in the semifinals and Stanford will
meet the winner for the league championship on Sunday.
If Southern California does not place first in the
MPSF tournament, odds are it will still receive the at
large bid to the NCAA finals as the top team in the na
tion at the end of seasonal play. If Stanford places second
in the tournament, it still has a good chance of receiving
the at-large bid. Cal would probably have to win the tour
nament in order to make it to the NCAA tourney.
It has been over a month and a half since the Cardinal
and the Trojans last met, and Stanford has not lost a
game since that defeat. During that meeting, Stanford
was still getting a feel for playing as a team and the Car
dinal game has since improved.
Coach John Vargas feels that the greatest strides have
been made in the Cardinal's defense, particularly its
front-court and man-down defense.
"I think [defense has] been the difference in all of our
close games," Vargas said.
He also thinks that the players have come together as
a tighter team.
"They're not trying to exceed their roles, just playing

it to a'T'," he said. "That's the biggest difference, people
feeling a little bit more comfortable in their positions."
All season, the team has been focusing on getting its
defensive play on par with its stellar offensive line-up. If
last Saturday's Big Splash victory over Cal is any indica
tion of the defensive capabilities of the Cardinal, it
should be in great shape for the MPSF this weekend.
Sophomore goalie Chad Taylor tallied a career-high 12
saves and the entire team worked to keep the Bears
down to just three goals for the match.

"Chad, our goalie, has been incredible this year,"
Azevedo said. "This is his first year of collegiate play
ever, and starting off the season with tough games against
SC and Cal and now proving to be one of the top three
goalies in college, that's awesome."
The Cardinal is led offensively by Azevedo. He has
been named MPSF Player of the Week three times this
season, more than any other player. He also leads the
Cardinal in scoring with 71 goals this year.
"Team chemistry and confidence has blossomed from

a month and a half, two months ago," Azevedo said. "We
weren't clicking as well... so we'd come out against
teams like SC and do well and score and get complacent
and wouldn't be playing as well together and a couple of
mistakes would lead to more and more.
"Now I think we know we're the best team here, with
the confidence, and the defense and the heart."
