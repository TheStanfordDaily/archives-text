## Willingham accepts life under the microscope after departure from the Farm 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
You might have overlooked it if he were
more laid-back. But as everyone around
here knows, Tyrone Willingham was always
dependably prompt.
The second-year Notre Dame head coach
was scheduled to speak with Bay Area re
porters at 12 p.m. sharp yesterday about his
first return to Palo Alto since leaving Stan
ford for the more lucrative Irish job prior to
the 2002 season. Willingham and Notre
Dame, after all, come to Stanford Stadium
for a Thanksgiving-weekend matchup on
Saturday.
Stanford media relations director Gary
Migdol called Willingham's office, asked for
the head man and received a startled reply
from the secretary.
"Coach Willingham isn't in his office
right now, can I take a message?" she asked.
Excuse me?
Was Lionel Tyrone Willingham actually
running late?
Indeed, he was.
He did find his way to his office several

moments later and the teleconference went
on as planned.
He didn't, however, offer an explanation
about why he was delayed.
Sure, you might say, it was just a small
part of Willingham's long daily routine. But
the blip on the radar of sorts also represent
ed a significant departure from his Stanford
conduct.
Tyrone was punctual, precise and unhesi
tating when he was the head coach at Stan
ford for seven years. For the most part, that
hasn't changed now that he's at one of the
most storied football programs in the coun
try — he still runs as tight a ship as ever.
But as his slight tardiness may have
demonstrated, being the head coach at
Notre Dame isn't just a football instruction
job.
It's much, much more.
Instead of the smaller press conferences,
the occasional die-hard Stanford fan at
practice and the minimal television expo
sure of the Bay Area, Willingham has
learned first-hand about what he calls the
"fishbowl" effect of the Notre Dame locale
— where everything seems to be magnified
1,000 times larger.
There are more fans attending practices,
more print media hounding him at press
conferences and more television people
throwing cameras in his face.

"There are more eyes," he said.
Furthermore, Willingham is the first
African-American head coach of any
sport at Notre Dame, so people decided
that his story was worth covering again,
and again, and again.
For example, Alan Grant, a former
player for the then-assistant Willingham
at Stanford in the late 1980s, wrote a
book about the coach's first year in
South Bend called "Return to Glory: In
side Tyrone Willingham's Amazing First
Season at Notre Dame."
And ESPN decided Willingham's
sparkling first-year record warranted an
11-part series about the Notre Dame
football program on and off the field as
part of its ongoing program entitled
"The Season."
Now, Willingham is a very private
person — in both his family and coach
ing life — but decided to allow more ac
cess for a book and TV show.
"I think for the most part what goes
on in the team should remain in the
team," he said. "But I have great respect
for Alan as a former player and I felt he
would do a very fair and honest job."
He explained that he did not give any
one "total access" and joked that he pe
rused the first cut of the ESPN show to
check for "NCAA violations or anything
of that nature."
But Willingham was probably most
willing to allow such extra-curricular ac

tivities to take place under his watch be
cause he was able to maintain the in
tegrity he prides himself on.
"You have to be careful in things of
that nature because things that are said
and actions can sometimes be misinter
preted when you have only 10 [or] 15
seconds to look at it," he said.
Though he finds himself in an ex
tremely intense environment nowadays,
Willingham maintains that he has not
evolved too much.
"My lifestyle has not changed a great
deal," he said. "The things I was fortu
nate to do in the Bay Area I still do —
just one of them I don't do quite as much
because of the weather."
(That one thing would be golf, if you
are wondering.)
With the less-than-stellar weather re
cently in the Bay Area, he may not get
much of a chance to catch up on his golf
game when he's here this weekend.
Instead, Willingham will have more
time — whether he likes it or not — to
grapple with the conflicting emotions
that will inevitably stir inside him upon
returning to his old home.
Recall that he was an assistant coach
under Dennis Green from 1989-1991 on
the Farm before becoming the headmas
ter at Stanford from 1995-2001 — when
he took a team struggling under leg
endary coach Bill Walsh and turned it
upside down.
Willingham's legacy is worth remi
niscing about for a moment.

He took Stanford to four bowl games
— including the school's first Rose Bowl
appearance in 28 years — and presided
over the 1999 Pacific 10 Conference
championship squad.
He twice won Pac-10 Coach of the
Year (1995 and 1999) — the only Cardi
nal coach to ever earn the honor twice.
Most of all, he cemented his title as
the man that briefly returned Stanford
football to national prominence with
Stanfojd's No. 17 finish in his last year.
Obviously, Willingham's return to a
place that he invested so much time, en
ergy and effort — and ultimately a place
where he found a great deal of success —
will wreak some havoc internally.
"That return will involve a great deal
of emotion," he said. "I look at it as hav
ing spent one-fifth of my life at Stanford,
and we accomplished some great
things."
Willingham was a mentor for many of
the players he recruited, and still occu
pies that role in some respects for the
players that remain on the Cardinal ros
ter.
He says he has talked to sdme of his
former players, like Chris Lewis, "on
some occasions" and emphasizes that he
will be there for them if they need advice
or support.
But he says he has stopped short of in
terfering too much — and will usually
only talk to the players if they decide to
contact him.
"I do believe that their responsibility

is to their team," he explained. "You
don't want to send conflicting signals."
When Notre Dame fired Bob Davie in
December 2001, Willingham was men
tioned as one of the top candidates to re
place him. A week later, Notre Dame
athletic director Kevin White hired
Georgia Tech's George O'Leary — who
infamously falsified his academic and
athletic achievements and subsequently
resigned five days later.
That opened the door for the Irish to
hire Willingham, who was 44-36-1 in his
seven years with the Cardinal.
Willingham tried in earnest to make a
clean break from his players — many of
whom were taken aback by his decision
to leave — and not act as a distraction.
But it now appears that he was not en
tirely successful — though it was not his
fault.
"Initially, there was resistance to the
[coaching] change," senior linebacker
Brian Gaffney said. "Some of the upper
classmen were bitter that Willingham
left, and we didn't get the quality of
leadership that we could have."
As Stanford was mired in a horrible 2-
9 season a year ago, senior wide receiver
Luke Powell admits many players won
dered aloud whether having Willingham
would have made a difference.
"It seemed like every day or every
other day that people were saying 'If Ty
rone was here,' " he said. "We were
looking for any answers about why this
was happening, and it was easy to point

to Notre Dame because they were doing
so well."
Willingham was 10-3 in his first year
at the helm, but his team has struggled
considerably this year.
The Irish started the season 2-6 —
and many in South Bend began to lose
their patience. Since the expectations
are ridiculously high in such a high-pres
sure, high-profile environment, it seems
that a coach would always be looking
over his shoulder, wondering when he
was going to get canned.
But Willingham, at least publicly, as
serts that he never worried about his job
security.
"My focus has always been on our
players and our university and that has
not wavered," he said.
Notre Dame has regained its collec
tive focus, however, and has won its last
two contests — but it is already ineligi
ble for a Bowl game in the Big East bowl
alignment.
"We are trying to finish as strong as
possible," he said.
With the intense scrutiny he has been
receiving from alumni, fans and media,
might Tyrone miss the comfort of Stan
ford?
"To be honest, I am enjoying my ex
perience at Notre Dame," he said. "I've
had some great young men here."
The Stanford community probably
misses him a whole lot more, especially
since Willingham, as head and assistant
coach, never lost to Cal.
