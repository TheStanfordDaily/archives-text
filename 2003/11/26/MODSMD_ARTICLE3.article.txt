# WIN, LOSE OR TY
## Willingham accepts life under the microscope after departure from the Farm 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
You might have overlooked it if he were
more laid-back. But as everyone around
here knows, Tyrone Willingham was always
dependably prompt.
The second-year Notre Dame head coach
was scheduled to speak with Bay Area re
porters at 12 p.m. sharp yesterday about his
first return to Palo Alto since leaving Stan
ford for the more lucrative Irish job prior to
the 2002 season. Willingham and Notre
Dame, after all, come to Stanford Stadium
for a Thanksgiving-weekend matchup on
Saturday.
Stanford media relations director Gary
Migdol called Willingham's office, asked for
the head man and received a startled reply
from the secretary.
"Coach Willingham isn't in his office
right now, can I take a message?" she asked.
Excuse me?
Was Lionel Tyrone Willingham actually
running late?
Indeed, he was.
He did find his way to his office several

moments later and the teleconference went
on as planned.
He didn't, however, offer an explanation
about why he was delayed.
Sure, you might say, it was just a small
part of Willingham's long daily routine. But
the blip on the radar of sorts also represent
ed a significant departure from his Stanford
conduct.
Tyrone was punctual, precise and unhesi
tating when he was the head coach at Stan
ford for seven years. For the most part, that
hasn't changed now that he's at one of the
most storied football programs in the coun
try — he still runs as tight a ship as ever.
But as his slight tardiness may have
demonstrated, being the head coach at
Notre Dame isn't just a football instruction
job.
It's much, much more.
Instead of the smaller press conferences,
the occasional die-hard Stanford fan at
practice and the minimal television expo
sure of the Bay Area, Willingham has
learned first-hand about what he calls the
"fishbowl" effect of the Notre Dame locale
— where everything seems to be magnified
1,000 times larger.
There are more fans attending practices,
more print media hounding him at press
conferences and more television people
throwing cameras in his face.
