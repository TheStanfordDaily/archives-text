# Group formed to discuss appropriate use of pants
## 
### PAULA HAYNES MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS —
It was a cold and snowy afternoon,
and Erica Eads looked on in hor
ror as a man wearing shorts
crossed the street near the Uni
versity of Minnesota.
"That would be a pants-appro
priate situation," she said.
And Eads should know. She's
president of Tengo Pantalones, a
newly registered university stu
dent group dedicated to dis
cussing situations in which pants
are appropriate.
Eads and two friends from her
dorm came up with the idea over
dinner earlier this month. The trio
made it official when they paid the
$15 registration fee at the Student
Activities Office, using quarters
that were originally meant to pay
for club secretary Charles Swan's
laundry.
"I thought it was funny and
kind of different," said Sara Fer
guson, the Student Activities Of
fice employee who received the
quarters.
Tengo Pantalones — Spanish for
"I have pants" — now has 40
members, and the three founders
said they have no idea what to do
with them.

They've talked of holding a
large forum with all its members
to discuss pants, in addition to a
clothing drive for pants, which
would not accept capris, shorts or
skirts.
"We deal with pure pants
only," Swan said.
The group said society does not
often address pants-related issues.
"At Taco Bell, they have a sign
that says 'No shirt, no shoes, no
service,' but it doesn't say any
thing about pants," Eads said.
One thing the founders said
they want to do is keep the club
apolitical.
"Pants have nothing to do with
abortion, religion or racism,"
Eads said.
Nor do they want to be
preachy.
"They need to want help them
selves before we can do anything,"
said treasurer Kelly Frush, refer
ring to the man wearing shorts in
the snow.
They do, however, dream of a
pants-related infomercial that
could some day air during a U.S.
president's State of the Union ad
dress.
"We're really, really random
when we talk about things and
sometimes that gets translated
into reality," Swan said.
