## Vaccine may prevent spread of herpes 
### SEUNG MIN KIM THE DAILY IOWAN 
(U-WIRE) IOWA CITY, Iowa — University of
Iowa Hospitals and Clinics researchers will soon
begin a clinical trial on a new vaccine that might
prevent the transmission of genital herpes, one of
the country's most prevalent sexually transmitted
diseases.
The UIHC is one of 22 sites in the country that
will conduct studies of the Herpevac vaccine. Ap
proximately 7,550 women across the country will
participate in clinical trials.
The participants will receive three injections in
a six-month period of either the Herpevac or an
investigational hepatitis A vaccine, according to
the National Institutes of Health.
News of the study comes as Herpes Awareness
Week, sponsored by the American Health Asso
ciation from Sunday through Saturday, winds to a
close.
After the six-month period, the women will

then be followed for 20 months through regular
clinical visits and blood tests, said Kevin Ault, UI
associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology.
He hopes to begin the clinical trial soon after the
Thanksgiving recess, but the final product will not
be available to the public for some time.
"Three years is not a bad guess," he said. "But
it's pure speculation, because we're just getting
started with the research."
Genital herpes is a virus with no existing cure
that is transmitted through direct skin-to-skin
contact. The latest NIH data show that approxi
mately 25 percent of Americans over the age of 12
are afflicted.
Herpevac, which was developed six to eight
years ago, consists of protein gathered from the
surface of a dead herpes virus, similar to commer
cial vaccines for hepatitis and the human papillo
mavirus, which causes genital warts, Ault said.
A November 2002 study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine showed that Herpe
vac was more effective in women than men, a re

suit the UIHC will study in the clinical trial.
The earlier study, which tested the Herpevac
on 7,400 subjects, showed the vaccine reduced the
risk of contracting genital herpes in women not
previously infected with the virus by 75 percent.
But men and women who already had the herpes
virus did not benefit from the vaccine.
The Herpevac is one of several in a new breed
of vaccine treatments for sexually transmitted dis
eases, Ault said. He added that UIHC scientists
are currently studying vaccines for HPV, HIV,
and chlamydia.
Still, prevention methods should not cloud
judgments and stop people from abstaining from
risky behavior such as unprotected sex, Ault said.
"We still want people to practice safe sex, re
gardless of this vaccine," he said. "Forty-five mil
lion Americans have herpes, so if you look in your
age group, that means about 20 to 30 percent of
them have already been exposed."
