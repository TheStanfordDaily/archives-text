## Hennessy may take pay cut 
### REBECCA LIAO 
Though Stanford experienced significant budget cuts
in the fiscal year 2002, University President John Hen
nessy's annual salary amounted to $566,581 â€” a figure
that represents a 1.3 percent decrease from fiscal year
2001.
In accordance with the budget pressures that have
been affecting Stanford in the past few years and faced
with the possibility of having to ask colleagues for a
salary freeze, "Hennessy has volunteered to take a 5 per
cent pay reduction [for fiscal year 2003] in light of the
budget pressures this year," said Jeff Wachtel, President
Hennessy's chief of staff.
"Though the amount is not large relative to the entire
University budget, it represents his feeling that everyone
must participate in the budget reduction process and that,
as president, he should go even further than what he is
asking of his colleagues across the University," Wachtel
added.
According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, Hen
nessy is not among the most highly paid presidents of pri
vate colleges and universities, while almost every presi
dent's salary has grown in the past few years.
In the fiscal year 2002, the presidents of Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, Vanderbilt University, the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, and Rockefeller University each
earned more than $800,000. Among private universities,
27 presidents commanded compensation of $500,000 or
more in the last fiscal year.
While pay for the presidents of public universities has
not yet reached these levels, their salaries are quickly in
creasing and may soon rival that of their counterparts at
private universities, sources predict. Mary Sue Coleman,
president of the University of Michigan, is presently the
highest-paid president of a public university, earning
$677,500 in pay and benefits.
Due to increases in tuition, reduced academic pro
grams and reductions of the number of faculty and staff
positions, these high salaries have drawn greater atten
tion, if not criticism.
In an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center
for Public Policy and Higher Education, said, "It's not
going to be good for higher education if it becomes seen,
at a time when tuition is going up, that college presiden
cies have become a new route to being a millionaire."
Wachtel said that "President Hennessy believes, how
ever, that Stanford's process for determining his salary is
fair and reasonable."
The Board of Trustees sets the President's salary an

nually. As with all salaries at Stanford, the President's
salary is based on a number of factors including perfor
mance and comparable salaries at other institutions.
Though the President's salary is higher than that of
Harvard's and Princeton's presidents, it is lower than that
of Yale's president, who was among the 10 highest paid
presidents in the fiscal year 2002.
In the Stanford University Budget Plan for 2002 / 03
drawn up by Provost John Etchemendy and the Universi
ty Budget Office, an increase of 5.4 percent in total
salaries and benefits is expected for this fiscal year.
In addition, Stanford expects continued modest
growth in the number of academic staff by about 1 per
cent. The staff salary program for 2002 / 03 includes cen
tral funding of 2.7 percent of the budget for merit in
creases; 0.5 percent for one-time, non-base performance
bonuses and incentives; and targeted funding for specific
job groups that lag the market by 10 percent or more.
Fittingly, Etchemendy cited "operating in a more con
strained environment" as a future challenge in his Stan
ford University Budget Plan for 2001 / 02. Although
Stanford has reiterated the importance of maintaining
Stanford's competitive hiring practices for attracting and
retaining faculty and staff, the increasing budget cuts may
make salary increases a more difficult goal to achieve.
