# Union calls for investigation
## 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
The Union of Needleworkers and Industrial
Textile Employees, UNITE, is calling for an investi
gation of the Cintas Corporation, the largest uni
form laundry service in North America. Cintas pro
vides its services to several universities nationwide,
including Stanford.
The labor union issued statements and a report
detailing what it said were "serious health and safety
concerns, poverty wages, unaffordable health care,
discrimination and illegal firings."
Stanford Hospital and Stanford Housing and
Dining Services both send their uniforms to the
firm's South San Francisco plant, where they are
processed and then shipped to the San Leandro
plant to be laundered.
Jason Oringer, a researcher for the union, said
that most of the workers are immigrant women from
Mexico, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The
workers are paid around $8 an hour, with wages
varying around the Bay Area depending on the local
cost of living.
One of the workers quoted in the article is Fran
cisca Amaral, who works at the Cintas facility in San
Leandro.
"In all of my time working at Cintas, I never re
ceived training from the company about how to pro
tect myself from getting injured on the job, or how to
be safe around all the chemicals that we use," Ama
ral said. "I injured my shoulder at work from doing
the same movements over and over for so long."
UNITE has recently brought Cintas' alleged un
fair labor practices to the attention of universities
and student activists groups at Miami University of
Ohio, Xavier University, University of Northern Illi
nois and Cornell. It launched successful campaigns
at the UC-Berkeley last May and UC-Santa Cruz in
September, where students and workers on campus
convinced the universities to terminate their con
tracts with Cintas.
Wade Gates, a spokesman for Cintas, claims that
UNITE is spreading false information to universities
with the goal of pressuring the company into signing
a neutrality agreement that would unionize all of
their employees.
Under a neutrality agreement, the employer
agrees to say and do nothing to oppose the union.
Union members would not be punished for their in
volvement with the union or be treated in ways that
they consider unfair.
Oringer said that Cintas has always been anti
union and that therefore "card check neutrality"

would be the only way the concerns of Cintas em
ployees could be addressed. Under the neutrality
system, employees vote secretly to go into bargain
ing without being subject to the consequences of
being pro-union.
"If people don't even feel free to talk about the
problems that exist at the work site, if they're being
followed by managers in the parking lots who are
watching people take leaflets, this is not the right en
vironment for a card check or an election because
neutrality does not exist," Oringer said, referring to
incidents that UNTIE claims have happened to Cin
tas workers.
Gates denies these allegations, citing several pe
titions that are circulating in various Cintas plants lo
cated nationwide, including Bedford, 111., and Long
Island, N.Y. These petitions have been signed by
employees within the plants who say that they want
nothing to do with UNITE.
An excerpt from a petition signed by 60 Long Is
land Cintas plant employees reads, "We, the ones
who truly wish Cintas to progress and advance for
our own benefit, totally disapprove UNTTE's at
tempt to openly trouble the Company, trying to
block operations with its customers, taking people
who completely lack sense of education to protest
against companies that conduct business with Cin
tas."
Gates emphasized that most of their employees
had chosen to not be in the union—out of 27,000
employees, only 700 are unionized.
"The decision to be in a union is a personal deci
sion that is up to each and every employee," Gates
said. "Employees that join a union would be giving
up their individual rights because the union would be
negotiating for them."
Oringer said that UNITE and Cintas have differ
ent mindsets on the issue of unionization.
"Cintas is concerned with the 'how' and we're
concerned with the 'why,'" Oringer said. "Cintas is
concerned about how the workers are going to be
unionized and the legal issues surrounding it. We're
talking about the issues the workers are undergo
ing."
UNITE seeks to work with campus organiza
tions such as the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and Service Employees International Union Local
715 to bring the Cintas labor issue onto the adminis
tration's agenda.
"We'd like to see Stanford really take a close look
at this and ask Cintas the really difficult questions,
and realize that there are other companies out there
that provide better conditions for their laundry
workers," Oringer said.
