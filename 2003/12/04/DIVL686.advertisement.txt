Student Body Shots is a clever look at
one of the most
common institutions among 18-22-
year-olds: college. Backed by
College Humor.com and with a for
ward from actor Rider Strong, author
Steve Hofstetter takes his readers
from move-in day to move-out day,
and makes sure to cover everything
in between. Occasionally, he writes
about classes, too. Divided into
subjects like "Men and Women,"
"Academics," and "The Daily Grind,"
SBS is made up of quick shots that
mock everything college, like the first
time you register for classes, and the
first time you actually get in to the
classes you've registered for.
