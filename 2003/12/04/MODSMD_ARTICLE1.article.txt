# Cordell still hopes to stay on council
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
While Stanford and the city of Palo Alto have
been scrambling over the past few weeks to find a
way for LaDoris Cordell, vice provost for campus re
lations, to take her city council seat without contro
versy, the future of the seat and Stanford-Palo Alto
relations remains unclear.
According to an old and obscure state law, Sec
tion 1090 of the government code, a city council may
not contract with a corporation for which a city
council member works. Consequently, the city of
Palo Alto would not even be able to negotiate con
tracts with Stanford if Cordell were to take her
newly elected seat on the city council this January.
The city council has not yet determined what
course of action it will take if efforts to amend the
law in state legislature do not quickly succeed, but
Cordell said that she would resign her seat if it
proved necessary.
However, Cordell and the council members are
optimistic about her chances of keeping the seat.
"Once you understand the facts, there's really
nobody at fault," said Larry Horton, Stanford's as
sociate vice president and director of government
and community relations. "The law, which was in
tended to cover institutions like Stanford, did not
take into account that Stanford is a trust with corpo
rate powers, but I don't think there's any fundamen
tal difference between Stanford and [other nonprof
it universities]. This is an extremely unusual situa
tion."
The news of the complication came as a surprise
to everyone, and the council voted unanimously to
seek legislation to amend the law to exempt Stan
ford. State Sen. Byron Sher (D-San Jose) will be
sponsoring the legislation. If the legis
lation were not passed or enacted
right away, and Cordell kept her seat,
minions of dollars worth of business
between Stanford and Palo Alto
would be put on hold.
"If it looks like the legislation is
going to get hung up, I'm not going to
jeopardize the business between
[Palo Alto and Stanford]," Cordell
said. "I would consider stepping
down, but I don't think we're going to
get there."

Bill Mayfield, Palo Alto senior as
sistant city attorney, explained that if
the amendment is passed as urgency
legislation, it will be effective as soon
as it's passed and signed by the gover
nor. If it is passed as regular legislation,
Mayfield continued, "then it becomes
effective the first of the following year,
January 2005 obviously an unac
ceptable solution."
Though the city council has noted
that no contracts would be put in jeop
ardy during the first quarter of 2004
while the legislation is pending, there
are criminal penalties attached to vio
lating the law, according to Mayfield,
and any contracts negotiated with Stan
ford while Cordell was on the council
would be void. Mayfield said the city of

Palo Alto and Stanford are going
through a process of inventory of all
their contracts to ensure that such a sit
uation is avoided.
"If anything, [this situation] might
bring [Stanford and Palo Alto] closer
together," Cordell said. "The city and
the university have come together to
make things OK. Certainly if the leg
islation passes, it will be a positive
thing. If the legislation doesn't pass,
then we'll do whatever we need to do
next."
While the city council is clearly
backing the amendment to the law, it
is unclear what will happen in the
state legislature.
"On the one hand, this is not a
major change to the statute," Cordell

said. "On the other side, there is an ar
gument that says you don't just
change the law to suit a particular sit
uation. My sense is that the will of the
people will prevail, and if the will of
the people was to elect me for their
city council then my sense is that [the
passage of the amendment] will clear
ly happen."
Cordell noted that those who
voted for her in November are contin
uing to support her.
"I think the general response is
that 'We voted for this person, this is
not her responsibility and we ought to
make it right,' " Cordell said. "This is
the feeling I'm getting and that cer
tainly makes me feel very good."
