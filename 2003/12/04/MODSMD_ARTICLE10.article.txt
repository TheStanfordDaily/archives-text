Buddy Teevens-bashing is at an all-time
high after two of the most painful de
feats in recent Stanford football history.
On Saturday, the team was defeated 57-
7 the worst home loss in 96 years by Notre
Dame and former Cardinal football coach Ty
rone Willingham. The previous week, Stanford
was mauled by rival California. Willingham
never lost to Cal, but Teevens is now 0-2 against

the Golden Bears.
Last week, students
and alumni began taking
their complaints to a
more visible medium.
The new Web site Bye
byebuddy.com with a
banner message that
reads "Fire Buddy
Teevens" â€”is a forum
for Stanford fans to post
their complains, sign a
petition against Teevens
and suggest possible re
placements. It contains
120 postings so far.

Despite charges of political favoritism at the
time of his appointment, and accusations that
Teevens is overmatched in his job, Stanford Di
rector of Athletics Ted Leland stands firm that
Teevens is here to stay. In fact, after Saturday's
catastrophic loss to Notre Dame, Leland told
the San Jose Mercury News that Teevens had
no reason to be concerned with his job security
and that he would be here at least three more
years, as stated in his existing contract.
The statement is baffling given Teeven's per
formance and disappointing 6-16 coaching
record in his two years at Stanford, with just
three wins in conference and one road win. This

is a sharp fall from former coach Tyrone Will
ingham's record, who went 14-9-1 in his first
two years here and led the team to bowl games
each year. It is time Leland started looking
around for a new head football coach and
this time he should expand his search beyond
former classmates and coworkers.
We understand that the team must go
through a transitional period when a new coach

is hired. However, we feel
thatTeevens' honeymoon
has come to an end. While
we understand that noth
ing can be done to change
the losses already suf
fered, public support of
Teevens to the media by
our athletic leaders does
little to calm the ire of
Cardinal fans.
It is true that responsi
bility for a team's perfor
mance cannot be placed
entirely on the head
coach. Many people play

a part in a game's outcome. While criticisms of
Teevens have been harsh, and sometimes unde
served, something to paraphrase "Hamlet"
is rotten in the state of Stanford football.
Teevens arrived last year promising a wide
open offense, but the Cardinal's attack quickly
became conservative and predictable, making it
hard for his players to gain an advantage on the
field. Teevens has not worked with these talent
ed people to cultivate a winning team. Stan
ford's reputation as an athletic powerhouse suf
fers when it makes no efforts to remedy the
problems. We're not so friendly with Buddyball
anymore.
