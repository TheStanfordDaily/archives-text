# Extended library hours overdue
## 
### 
As autumn quarter draws to a close,
Stanford students are now in full
time study mode with final exami
nations and papers approaching.
As a result, many are more frequently making
use of or even living at campus libraries.
And as deadlines draw nearer, more students
are burning the midnight oil and working later
into the night. In recognition of this increased
demand for library facilities, Green Library
has extended its hours and now closes at 2 a.m.
on most weeknights and at midnight on week
ends during Dead Week and finals week. We
applaud Green for making this wise change in
policy, which is in the best interest of all mem
bers of the Stanford community.
Two months ago, the editorial board used
this space to urge Green to reconsider its deci

sion when it decided to eliminate late study
hours at the library during the quarter's closing
weeks. According to library administrators,
University budget cuts spurred the scheduled
scale-back in Green's hours of operation. We
maintained that an institution of Stanford's
caliber should establish library access and
studying opportunities as financial priorities.
Library officials, through their effort to re
establish extended library hours, have
demonstrated that they are responsive to the
needs of the campus community. Students
will undoubtedly take advantage of the in
crease in hourly operation. And they will cer
tainly be thankful that Green took the initia
tive to quickly remedy a situation that could
have hindered the ability of students to fully
prepare for finals week.
