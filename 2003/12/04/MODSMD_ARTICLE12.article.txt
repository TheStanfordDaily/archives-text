# France-Stanford Center is fantastique
## 
### 
On Monday, Nov. 17, Jean-David
Levitte, French ambassador to the
United States, opened the France-
Stanford Center for International
Studies. Funded by a $1 million donation by the
French government, the center represents a
positive move toward strengthening interna
tional studies and cooperation at Stanford.
At the event, Dean of Humanities and Sci
ences Sharon Long announced that the
School of Humanities and Sciences was com
mitting an additional $1 million of funding as
double-matching grants to the center. This
means that if donors take advantage of this
opportunity, the center will eventually be en
dowed with $2.5 million: This level of support
provides the center with the necessary means
to ensure high-quality events and to build a
strong future for bi-lateral cultural under
standing. We hope that donors will take ad
vantage of the opportunity to help endow this
center and will seriously consider helping
Stanford build a strong future for internation
al studies.
The center's purpose is to bridge the disci
plines of the humanities, social sciences, engi
neering, business and law, addressing histori
cal and contemporary issues from a broad
range of perspectives. We fully endorse the in
ternational dialogue that this center will bring

to campus. By bringing more voices into aca
demic discussions on campus, the intellectual
vitality of Stanford is enriched.
It is an honor that Stanford was chosen
among America's top universities to house
this center, and we hope that students, faculty
and staff will take advantage of the benefits it
brings to campus. Last April, the center host
ed its first conference, "Issues of Risk and Re
sponsibility in Contemporary Engineering
and Science: French and U.S. Perspectives."
More conferences on engaging topics, such as
Islam in the two countries, are planned for the
near future.
After a year of tensions between the Unit
ed States and France, the France-Stanford
center represents a positive step to building
strong relations between the two countries.
The French government, by endowing the
center, has taken a positive step towards en
suring a future of fruitful relations between
the two countries.
At the opening of the center, University
President John Hennessy stressed the great
importance of French culture and thought in
the world. The new center will allow Stanford
to take advantage of this rich tradition, and, as
Levitte said, will allow the most brilliant
minds of France and the United States to in
teract to build a brighter future for the world.
