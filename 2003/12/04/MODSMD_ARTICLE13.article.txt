Toyon's alcohol policy
misrepresented in The Doily

Throughout this quarter, The Daily
has consistently misrepresented the al
cohol policy at Toyon Hall. At best,
this is inexcusably lazy and inaccurate
journalism; at worst, it is a deliberate
campaign of misinformation.
Most egregiously, in a recent edito
rial ("Res Ed needs to go to its room,"
Nov. 21), The Daily wrote:
"In October, the resident fellow in
Toyon Hall made a unilateral decision
to ban alcohol at public events in the
dorm."
This statement is entirely false. The
Toyon residential fellow, Giancarlo
Aquilanti, never made any such deci
sion, nor has he made any "unilateral"
decisions this year. Furthermore, the
idea of banning alcohol at public
events in Toyon has never even been
discussed at a Toyon staff meeting.
Since this decision was never made,
how does The Daily know that it hap
pened in October? We, too, are puz
zled by this specificity, which is com
plete fabrication.
In fact, alcohol can be served at
public events in Toyon. Groups that
wish to serve alcohol are allowed to
use Toyon's Faste Lounge for events
provided that they have an appro
priate plan for cleanup and security,
the lounge is free on the requested day
and their request is approved by the
RAs and the RF. Toyon itself also
throws parties at which alcohol is
served; the dorm will host an all-cam
pus party and serve alcohol next
quarter.
This editorial came on the heels of
a similarly inaccurate article ("Upper
classmen face alcohol restrictions,"
Nov. 13), which stated: "Toyon staff
members say they will continue to
serve alcohol, seeing as there are more
than 150 eating associates that are
over 21."
The article also implied that, in the
past, Toyon board bills have been used
to purchase alcohol. To clarify, Toyon
staff members RAs and others em
ployed by Stanford University are
not allowed to serve alcohol to resi
dents, per university regulations and
party planning guidelines. We have
never served alcohol in the past, and
we will not in the future.
The Eating Club Managers who
live in Toyon but are not employed by
Stanford University are allowed to
serve alcohol to residents and eating
associates who are over the age of 21.
They have always served alcohol re
sponsibly and moderately, and this
year they continue to do so, while
carefully managing their events to

limit risk.
Additionally, Toyon residents'
board bills have never been used to
pay for alcohol. Whenever the Eating
Clubs purchase alcohol, they use
funds from eating associates who are
21 or from supplemental incomes such
as space rented out for parties. Noth
ing about this policy has changed this
year.
We hope this letter has set the
record straight about alcohol in
Toyon. In the future, if members of the
Stanford community would like accu
rate information on this subject, we
suggest that they talk to us directly, in
stead of relying on The Daily's erro
neous reporting.

Seven other Toyon resident assistants and
two Stanford Eating Club managers also
signed this letter.

Teeven's performance

As disappointed as I have been in
the performance of the Stanford foot
ball team this year, I was even more
disappointed to re'ad comments at
tributed to Ted Leland, Stanford's ath
letic director, in both The San Francis
co Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury
news. The gist of the comments was
that Buddy Teevens' future at Stanford
is just fine. Nothing should be "just
fine" about the football department
right now, after two consecutive losing
seasons, the second consecutive loss to
our rivals and the worst home loss in
school history. At the very least,
Teevens should have some questions
about his future at Stanford, as should
everyone involved. This is a program
two years removed from the Rose
Bowl, and it has been pretty much run
into the ground.
I am an alumnus of Stanford under
grad and law school. I regularly attend
my Stanford reunions, and I am also a
donor to the general Stanford Fund
and the athletic department. My en
thusiasm about all of these activities
will be tempered if the current lack
adaisical attitude towards football is
maintained. I had my doubts when
Teevens was hired, given the fact that
he was fired from his last head coach
ing position after having a season in
which he failed to win a single game,
My concerns have proven in retro
spect to be valid.
I am not alone in my sentiment. I
have spoken to several alumni, all
donors and season ticket holders, who

- are just as frustrated about Stanford
football because of the performance
over the last two years and who believe
a coaching change should at the very
least be seriously considered, if not an
obvious necessary choice ... regard
less of his relationship with our athletic
director. Buddy may have a way with
people, but he certainly does not seem
to have a way on the football field.
I urge all of you who care about
Stanford football and who feel that
change is necessary to make your feel
ings known. Stanford should seek ex
cellence in football coaching as it does
in the myriad of other sports in which
Stanford excels.
Go Cardinal.

It's time to bring the Buddy
Teevens Experiment to an end.
Teevens was supposed to bring a great
offense to Stanford he failed.
Teevens said the team would be more
motivated this year he failed again.
Teevens, like any head coach, is sup
posed to be a good judge of talent.
He's not.
Outside of a few defensive gems
(UC-Los Angeles, Arizona State Uni
versity, Brigham Young University),
this season can be best characterized
by mostly uninspired football not
too different from last season, other
than fewer personal fouls. The "Fun
'n' Gun" was more like the "Dump 'n'
Punt" this year. The offense has been
nothing short of putrid, and seemed to
get worse, not better, as the season
went on.
In large part the failures of the of
fense this season were due to Teevens'
decision to continue to play an ineffec
tive Chris Lewis at quarterback. Trent
Edwards and Kyle Matter may not
have been any better, but at least they
would have had an opportunity to de
velop as both have multiple years of el
igibility remaining. Now not only have
fans had to endure another lousy sea
son, but the expectations for next year
aren't much better at quarterback. An
entire season of development has been
wasted.
I think the most telling example of
Teevens' failure is the way the team
mailed in its performance against
Notre Dame on Saturday. Clearly they
were not motivated to play a re
sponsibility that rests squarely on the
shoulders of the head coach.
It's time for Ted Leland to find a
new head football coach.
