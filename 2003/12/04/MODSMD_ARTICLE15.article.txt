# JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK
## She'll be home for Christmas, baby 
### 
It's been Christmas for almost a month in
Oxford, a chronological development
that has made me appreciate the awe
some beauty of Thanksgiving. Forget the

turkey, football and grati
tude for life's blessings
the best thing about
Thanksgiving is that it
stems the tide of commer
cialized, red velvet-flocked
holiday vomit for most of
November, leaving the
purge for this month, where
it belongs. I'm a creature of
habit, and like any good
American, I'm only ready
for Christmas after

Thanksgiving has swollen my belly with abun
dance.
But seeing all these public displays of tinsel
also reminds me that time has managed to haul
off autumn quarter once again. I don't know
how, but I imagine a sleigh was involved. It's
hard for me to believe in just over a week, I'll
be back home in Sacramento, knee-deep in
Starbucks holiday cups and animatronic rein
deer, reveling in the spirit of the season and
reminiscing on seasons past.
I'll never forget my family's first real
Christmas where we had a tree and orna
ments like normal people. We had just moved
in to our house and were spending Christmas
all together for the first time. It was also the
Christmas I discovered Santa didn't exist. I was
7 and had written a very polite letter to Mr.
Claus requesting an art kit, one that included
pipe cleaners if possible, and gave it to my
mom to mail. Something got lost in translation,

and she threw it away instead.
On Christmas morning, I awoke to find an
unwrapped, brown plastic desk organizer and
a matching brown stenographer's notepad
under the tree, bright orange price stickers still
affixed on the back. That killed the magic right
there. Even if Santa did exist, I doubt he would
shop at Raley's Supermarket. My sister re
ceived the same terrible gift, but she wasn't as
upset, having been disappointed on Christmas
before. Besides, her birthday was three days
away, and my parents understood how those
worked fairly well.
The only one who got what he asked for was
my autistic brother, who was happily eating a
hot slice of pepperoni pizza beside the tree. His
special-ed teacher had called my mom earlier
in the week to tell her about his letter to Santa,
expressed in the form of a Dominos ad, and
helped her organize the details.
I learned a lot from that Christmas: Santa
was a lie, but there was such a thing as a brown
plastic desk tray factory; and, in order to get
anything I wanted from my parents, I needed a
personal assistant. But I forgave them soon
enough they were dealing with things more
important than playing Santa, such as unpack
ing boxes, registering the car, adjusting to new
employment and keeping my brother from
chasing squirrels down the street naked.
In fact, looking back, that crappy Christmas
is the one I remember best and laugh about the
most. It was the first in a long line of crappy
Christmases that would eventually become a
Kim family tradition.
According to tradition, gifts are in cash,
cards come from a drugstore (but in a pinch, a
post-it note will suffice) and the tree is plastic

proof positive that lameness can be ritual
ized. However, this year marks the beginning
of a new tradition demographically speak
ing at least as it will be my first Christmas
alone with my parents. Just us, alone. My
brother died years ago, and my sister is work
ing in San Francisco ... and then there were
three, with one slightly jet-lagged.
Even so, I'm certain that the low-key
some might call it lazy holiday spirit will
prevail. The family tradition keeps crawling
along because, whether we watch cartoons or
the Kings game, eat dinner at Marie Calen
der's or Red Lobster, our undemonstrative ob
servation of Christmas reflects the kind of love
we share: love lenient, plain and sheer.
There's a privileged bond between the hol
idays and tradition, between festivity and
meaning. I'm convinced that this is where a
good deal of the so-called "magic of the sea
son" comes from (of course, the expensive pre
sents help too). Traditions give form to feeling,
a gesture to the orphic pride folded soft along
the edges of our lives.
In college, we start making our own tradi
tions: We trek home for the holidays or cele
brate someplace else, with different people, or
don't celebrate at all. But whatever we
choose, tradition remembers, making it possi
ble for us to see, years later on the way to for
getting, that the worst Christmas was actually
the best one.

This Christmas, Junior Jennie Kim is asking
Santa for scented candles, Eartha Kitt, artistic
monographs and a fake tree. What do you
want? E-mail your wish list to jenniek@stan

According to tradition, gifts are in cash,
cards come from a drugstore (but in a pinch, a
post-it note will suffice) and the tree is plastic

proof positive that lameness can be ritual
ized. However, this year marks the beginning
of a new tradition demographically speak
ing at least as it will be my first Christmas
alone with my parents. Just us, alone. My
brother died years ago, and my sister is work
ing in San Francisco ... and then there were
three, with one slightly jet-lagged.
Even so, I'm certain that the low-key
some might call it lazy holiday spirit will
prevail. The family tradition keeps crawling
along because, whether we watch cartoons or
the Kings game, eat dinner at Marie Calen
der's or Red Lobster, our undemonstrative ob
servation of Christmas reflects the kind of love
we share: love lenient, plain and sheer.
There's a privileged bond between the hol
idays and tradition, between festivity and
meaning. I'm convinced that this is where a
good deal of the so-called "magic of the sea
son" comes from (of course, the expensive pre
sents help too). Traditions give form to feeling,
a gesture to the orphic pride folded soft along
the edges of our lives.
In college, we start making our own tradi
tions: We trek home for the holidays or cele
brate someplace else, with different people, or
don't celebrate at all. But whatever we
choose, tradition remembers, making it possi
ble for us to see, years later on the way to for
getting, that the worst Christmas was actually
the best one.

This Christmas, Junior Jennie Kim is asking
Santa for scented candles, Eartha Kitt, artistic
monographs and a fake tree. What do you
want? E-mail your wish list to jenniek@stan
