# ORDER IN THE COURT
## It's all about MTV for him 
### 
Perhaps the most fun thing about having a
column is the ability to ruminate about a
wide variety of topics. And since my well
of personal tidbits and random musings is
running a bit dry this week, I thought perhaps I'd

try my hand at political pun
ditry. Following in the foot
steps of such luminaries as
William F. Buckley, Jr., and
Paul Krugman, I, too, would
use my (admittedly much
more limited) pulpit to
broadcast truth and wisdom,
shedding new light on the hot
topic of the day.
One problem, however I
have no clue what the "hot
topic of the day" is. Actually,

to be brutally honest, I don't even know any of the
cold ones. I recently found out that China launched
a man into space, but I'm told that happened a cou
ple of months ago. (Which is fine, because I don't re
ally have much to say about it... um, "Go China?")
A major difficulty of the monastic student
lifestyle is the extent to which one inadvertently
withdraws from the world that we are supposedly
preparing to enter. Seminar discussions, papers
and finals have much more immediacy than any
thing going on in the "real world." History takes
precedence over current events: When I've got a
test next week on Congress' 1789 decision to es
tablish lower federal courts, it doesn't really mat
ter that Democrats and Republicans are currently
locked in a bitter partisan battle over judicial nom
inees to these same courts. I'm sure if it's impor
tant, it'll appear as a supplement to one of my case
books next semester.
After spending the whole day studying, I hardly

want to come home and brush up on curreiit events
It smacks too much of "learning." After a long
day of studying, my brain hurts. It wasn't built for
this. Evolution selects for mating ability, not the
ability to understand the extent of Congress' pow
ers under section five of the Fourteenth Amend
ment If I spend my free time trying to put anything
more into my head, I might lose some of the stuff
that I've worked so hard to cram in there. Watching
MTV's "Surf Girls" is much less risky.
Even when I do try to put aside my unhealthy
preoccupation with the past, the news media often
winds up double-crossing me and passing off his
tory as current events. Last night, I saw a story
about how the census counts illegal immigrants as
residents for the purposes of drawing up equal
population Congressional districts. Attention
local Fox affiliate: That's been the cas<? since Wes
berry v. Sanders, a Supreme Court case decided in
1964. And the latest census was three years ago.
Why was this "news" on Nov. 29,2003?
A few months ago, my mother tried to help me
out by purchasing me a subscription to The Sun
day New York Times, correctly figuring that even
though she enjoys my student discount, the $5
cover price would force me to read it out of a sense
of filial fiscal duty. While I was hesitant about re
ceiving only weekly updates, those fears subsided
when the first issue arrived on Aug. 10. As the
proud owner of five pounds of "all the news that's
fit to print," I no longer worried that I'd be left in
the dark about the events of Monday through Sat
urday. This one issue would be sufficient to keep
me abreast of contemporary affairs.
And just think how much more I'll learn when
I finally make it to the Aug. 17 issue.
