# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## The amazing life lessons learned from picking up hitchhikers
### 
Friday night, after writing half of this column, I tested
myself like I used to do in high school: I picked up a
hitchhiker. Hitchhiking is against the law, so I don't
advise others to do this. But for me, it's a risk I take
to prove to myself that I can trust people. It's completely
selfish.
But this time, it wasn't so simple. The lady scared me.

Not for her disheveled appearance or
bags full of needless crap, but for her
hooting and squawking when I slowed
past a police cruiser: "Don't slow down!
Hooo! You didn't break a law!
Squawk!"
Oh but I did, woman, by picking you
up. I was willing to bet that the officer
wouldn't mistake this grimy old bag lady
for a friend of mine. I really couldn't tell
if she was drunk, high or just out of her
mind, but I was anxious to get it over

with.
I pulled into a gas station next to where she had original
ly told me to go. I grew less and less polite about how soon I
wanted her out. She managed to score $2O from me by ask
ing for it (I do it for karma). Finally, she got out of the Jeep
(but not before ganking one of my unpaid parking tickets ..
.) and we exchanged some parting words.
"I love you."
"Crazy lady."
"I've been clinically diagnosed with depression, so say
'depressed'. Don't call me crazy."
"I'm sorry."
"Stanford student, huh?"
Then with screeching tires, I peeled into the night.
This episode left a dreary impression. For one, I was
ashamed of my insensitivity. But also, like any amateur
opinion columnist, I couldn't let it go without extracting
some cumbersome moral dilemma and clumsily stuffing it

into this week's piece.
Here goes: What if I, the Stanford student, was the crazy
one?
Last week, I sat down for a cup of coffee with a 24-year-old
woman who cursed me via e-mail for my last column. She be
rated my thoroughly facetious (and idiotic) commentary about
UC-Berkeley during the height of the Big Game hoopla. She
advised me to focus on the "real problems" in the world. It was
clear when she spoke that she knew nothing about Big Game or
its traditions. From her perspective, all this hullabaloo over one
measly sporting event arrived at the same time as the bombing
of the HSBC Bank in Istanbul, just minutes from her home.
Yet, she had a point. I shouldn't have wasted a column
opportunity on something I never really cared about in the
first place. For the next two hours, we discussed in depth the
lack of reality comrhbnly exhibited by' Stanford students in
general a conversation that seems to spring up more than
your mother's back hairs.
It begs the question: What definitions of "Stanford stu
dents" do you operate under? We all seem to have one or two
or 12. Is it some sociological phenomenon for people to over
generalize about their own populations? I typically hear mod
ifiers such as "unreal," "sheltered," "bubbled-in," "cosmical
ly-oriented" or "heads-lodged-firmly-in-gluteus-vicinities
of." Any ideas as to why this is? I'm about to tell you mine.
Stanford is what you call "hyper-reality" the non-na
tive vegetation, the Romanesque architecture, the pristine
landscaping all set in the cinematic backdrop of the lus
cious Palo Alto, with carpet shops and trophy milves as
Ã¼biquitous as bubbles in a champagne spa.
This is fitting for a student body that, if not prototypical
of the perfect human community, at least believes that it is.
But it's our well-engineered diversity that makes us special.
Look, in Sri Lanka, I'd see a lot of weirdos, but all for the
same Sri Lankan-hood. Meanwhile, Glaudio Valdez could
visit the commercialized suburban paradise that is North
Attleboro, Mass., and be similarly overwhelmed.

Stanford, however, exposes you to people that are multi
fariously unique. Tall Asian guys directing psychosexual
theatre with British accents, perfume-bombed sorority girls
studying Slavic languages while welding their M.E. projects
to N.W.A.
To needlessly illustrate, suppose there is a man-eating
psycho-hose-beast named "Jane Camarillo." When Jane
wants Italian, she hobbles over to Italy. If she craves hockey
players, she gallops up to Canada. But, when she wants a lit
tle of everything? Camarillo comes here to suck the life out
of Stanford. It's a human smorgasbord!
But, 94309 is a pretty tight space in which to over-represent
so many groups of people, so it tends to feel as contrived as it
is. And it turns your world upside down. Here, you're unique
for every trait that used to make you plain. And for every one
of your previously remarkable characteristics, you're like a
shitball in a can of shitball soup.
And you see this effect everywhere. Suddenly, people
around you take pride in the stupidest things, like, public
schooling or shoplifting.
You'd never expect to be a token WASP in a 200-person
lecture hall, but this is your opportunity to feel marginal for
the first time in your life. Unless you're gay. Or fat. Then you
already know the feeling.
At home, I identify with those who recognize the inher
ent injustice of capital punishment or who regard the ho
mogenization of news media industry as ominous for the fu
ture of a freedom-loving America. Here, that's just about
everybody, so I'm drawn to the few of you who agree that
Axl Rose is a badass.
I guess that's the theory. The nutra-sweet city of Palo
Alto injected with Stanford's obligatory over-emphasis on
personal idiosyncrasies those obscure identities that will
expire upon our late-spring exodus from campus makes
for a mystifying and surreal experience. How you view it is
up to you. Brilliant and fantastic? Or busy and distracting?
As far as I'm concerned, the Farm's rare animals com

prise more of a zoo than a jungle. While I appreciate the di
versity, I maintain a skeptical eye when observing any
species in an unnatural habitat.
I am not a clown's butt.

A.J. Magnuson thinks "Senioritis," the outrageous radio show
hosted by DJ Zinx D. on KZSU 90.1 from 1-3 a.m. on Thurs
days, is more badass than any member of GNR (except Slash,
of course) and, thus, should be syndicated. If you feel the urge
to whine uncontrollably like a pitiful Mike D., e-mail ajmag
nu@stanford. edu.
