# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## If only he could redefine 'layover' 
### 
I was going to begin this column with a
long string of curses (such as poppy
cock, or cor blimey!), but I figured my
editors would have flipped ape s—.
Whoops. Sorry readers, I'm a bit on edge, I
still haven't recovered from my Thanksgiv
ing break —or rather, my commute. Going
home to New Jersey for Thanksgiving was
probably not the best of ideas. First of all,
it's the equivalent of taking your holiday in
Mordor. And secondly, the day before and

the day of Thanksgiving are
the most traveled days in the
year. But hey, the 'rents want
ed me home, and I feel some
how obligated to those who
pay my tuition.
Just like Duncan should
have seen the raven outside
Macbeth's castle, so should I
have seen the warning signs of
my own personal hell. One
may think we live in a classless
society, but let me assure that

the airline industry is keeping the proletari
at down. Surely you have seen the two lines
for pre-flight boarding. That phrase itself is
rather intriguing: "pre-flight" suggests
there are other stages of boarding. How can
there be post-flight boarding, or even, in
flight boarding? Wouldn't you always do
pre-flight boarding? Maybe the late flyers
are going to run and catch up with us during
flight, "jumping" onto the plane like out of
some kind of "Die Hard" movie? And if
you are a post-flight boarder, wouldn't you
already be at your destination?
Where was I? Oh yes, the two lines.
One is called "Elite, Gold-card, Preferred
Flyer" and the other is called "General
Boarding." In the elite line you have the
leather brief-cased modern day robber

barons. On the other line, you have my line
the cattle, er, "coach" class. Our line was
half a mile long, their line had hand maid
ens feeding them grapes and fanning them
with peacock feathers. One day, I swear, I
will take my salted peanuts and ram them
down the throats of the elite gold card op
pressors, liberating the coach class and
rightly reclaiming those leather seats with
the really nice reclining backs! Viva la rev
olution!

Then, I found, I did not have a
seat. It seems the flight was oversold.
This means they sold more tickets to
people then there are seats on the
plane. To remedy this, they ask peo
ple to volunteer to give up their seats.
In return, the volunteers will win a
package from the airline which is only
redeemable at certain locations dur
ing leap years when you can't use the
package anyway because they have
expired. They use the intercom exten
sively to fake people out. "If you want

a free ticket to Hawaii..." and some poor
Joe will run up and volunteer his seat. The
stewardess will then inform that he will be
given enough frequent flyer miles to get to
Hawaii Town, Nebraska.
So I hopped on the 12:15 p.m. out of San
Jose bound for Houston. I say "hopped"
with as much sarcasm as possible. We
didn't take off till 1 p.m. It's funny how ev
erybody shows up two hours before flight
time, and then the actual take off time is
kind of fuzzy. It's like they make dead cer
tain everyone is on time, and then the pilots
kind of laugh and say, "Boy! You folks look
weary! How about we drive around the air
port for a little while to blow off steam?"
This only enrages the masses further, as
they bitterly bite into their stale bags of
peanuts.

I had a layover in Houston. I think if
they give people layovers, it should actual
ly be on the way home for the person. The
word layover itself is being misused. "Lay"
means to lie down, and "over" refers to a
sleep over. Thus, I propose that we rectify
this gross misuse of the English language,
and give complimentary hookers between
flights. "Mr. Smith, we don't have the direct
flight. You have a layover in Kansas City."
Then Mr. Smith will proceed to dance
around and give every guy within earshot a
high five.
But the airline industry has made
progress in other areas. You may not be
aware of this, but major airlines companies
now thoroughly screen their ticket holders.
They do a thorough background check to
make sure that yes, you do have a child
under 3 years old, and those tots will be fully
ready to scream their heads off when seat
ed next to yours truly. The screening pro
cess, I'll assure you, is quite thorough, for
every toddler in the San Jose area was on
my flight to Houston. Their parents kept
them crying, perhaps depriving them of
food, sleep, or threatening to send them to
Michael Jackson's "Neverland Ranch."
So my commute was less than enjoy
able. One would think pairing heart
wrenching-I-hate-the-rest-of-humanity
commuting with a family holiday would be
a recipe for disaster. And you'd be right.
But hey, after all this commuting, I'm now
more thankful than ever- Turkey is a natu
ral sedative.

Chris Holt was able to write an entire col
umn about flying and did not use the phrase
"mile high club " once. Send him your con
gratulations at cholt@stanford.edu.

I was going to begin this column with a
long string of curses (such as poppy
cock, or cor blimey!), but I figured my
editors would have flipped ape s—.
Whoops. Sorry readers, I'm a bit on edge, I
still haven't recovered from my Thanksgiv
ing break —or rather, my commute. Going
home to New Jersey for Thanksgiving was
probably not the best of ideas. First of all,
it's the equivalent of taking your holiday in
Mordor. And secondly, the day before and

the day of Thanksgiving are
the most traveled days in the
year. But hey, the 'rents want
ed me home, and I feel some
how obligated to those who
pay my tuition.
Just like Duncan should
have seen the raven outside
Macbeth's castle, so should I
have seen the warning signs of
my own personal hell. One
may think we live in a classless
society, but let me assure that

the airline industry is keeping the proletari
at down. Surely you have seen the two lines
for pre-flight boarding. That phrase itself is
rather intriguing: "pre-flight" suggests
there are other stages of boarding. How can
there be post-flight boarding, or even, in
flight boarding? Wouldn't you always do
pre-flight boarding? Maybe the late flyers
are going to run and catch up with us during
flight, "jumping" onto the plane like out of
some kind of "Die Hard" movie? And if
you are a post-flight boarder, wouldn't you
already be at your destination?
Where was I? Oh yes, the two lines.
One is called "Elite, Gold-card, Preferred
Flyer" and the other is called "General
Boarding." In the elite line you have the
leather brief-cased modern day robber

barons. On the other line, you have my line
the cattle, er, "coach" class. Our line was
half a mile long, their line had hand maid
ens feeding them grapes and fanning them
with peacock feathers. One day, I swear, I
will take my salted peanuts and ram them
down the throats of the elite gold card op
pressors, liberating the coach class and
rightly reclaiming those leather seats with
the really nice reclining backs! Viva la rev
olution!

Then, I found, I did not have a
seat. It seems the flight was oversold.
This means they sold more tickets to
people then there are seats on the
plane. To remedy this, they ask peo
ple to volunteer to give up their seats.
In return, the volunteers will win a
package from the airline which is only
redeemable at certain locations dur
ing leap years when you can't use the
package anyway because they have
expired. They use the intercom exten
sively to fake people out. "If you want

a free ticket to Hawaii..." and some poor
Joe will run up and volunteer his seat. The
stewardess will then inform that he will be
given enough frequent flyer miles to get to
Hawaii Town, Nebraska.
So I hopped on the 12:15 p.m. out of San
Jose bound for Houston. I say "hopped"
with as much sarcasm as possible. We
didn't take off till 1 p.m. It's funny how ev
erybody shows up two hours before flight
time, and then the actual take off time is
kind of fuzzy. It's like they make dead cer
tain everyone is on time, and then the pilots
kind of laugh and say, "Boy! You folks look
weary! How about we drive around the air
port for a little while to blow off steam?"
This only enrages the masses further, as
they bitterly bite into their stale bags of
peanuts.

I had a layover in Houston. I think if
they give people layovers, it should actual
ly be on the way home for the person. The
word layover itself is being misused. "Lay"
means to lie down, and "over" refers to a
sleep over. Thus, I propose that we rectify
this gross misuse of the English language,
and give complimentary hookers between
flights. "Mr. Smith, we don't have the direct
flight. You have a layover in Kansas City."
Then Mr. Smith will proceed to dance
around and give every guy within earshot a
high five.
But the airline industry has made
progress in other areas. You may not be
aware of this, but major airlines companies
now thoroughly screen their ticket holders.
They do a thorough background check to
make sure that yes, you do have a child
under 3 years old, and those tots will be fully
ready to scream their heads off when seat
ed next to yours truly. The screening pro
cess, I'll assure you, is quite thorough, for
every toddler in the San Jose area was on
my flight to Houston. Their parents kept
them crying, perhaps depriving them of
food, sleep, or threatening to send them to
Michael Jackson's "Neverland Ranch."
So my commute was less than enjoy
able. One would think pairing heart
wrenching-I-hate-the-rest-of-humanity
commuting with a family holiday would be
a recipe for disaster. And you'd be right.
But hey, after all this commuting, I'm now
more thankful than ever- Turkey is a natu
ral sedative.
