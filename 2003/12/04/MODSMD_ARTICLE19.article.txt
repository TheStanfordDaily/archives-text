## A
						hard row to hoe: Guantanamo 16 
### 
Nov. 10, the Supreme Court agreed to decide
whether or not they can decide something. While
that may not sound like the makings of a landmark
decision, this is the equivalent to the first kiss in the
conception of a new law —and it's also the first legal challenge
to unquestioned acceptance of President Bush's War on Ter
ror.

The case? The Guantanamo Bay 16.
You may have happened across sporadic
news coverage of the foreign detainees
captured and imprisoned in the wake of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The 16 have been held along with
hundreds sharing their fate—for the last
two years or so at "Gitmo Bay," a chunk
of land the United States leases from
Cuba. For the prisoners, contact with
family is minimal, contact with a lawyer is
impossible and most of the prisoners

haven't been charged with a crime. And this is perfectly legal.
The 16, composed of 12 Kuwaitis, two Britons and two
Australians, declare their innocence—a jailhouse cliche. But
these prisoners aren't even completely sure what crimes they
allegedly committed, and under the nebulous rules of the War
on Terrorism, they can be held forever.
Of the 660 prisoners from 42 countries, the president does
not have to offer any reason or crime for imprisonment. Ad
ditionally, the executive branch decides if and what kind of
hearing the prisoner will receive. Two words: Russian Gulag.
Families of the 16 filed lawsuits that have now been com
bined to just one case. Each prisoner is asking for due process;
this request has been denied in various lower courts and now
bumped up to the Supreme Court.
The president claims the right to hold "enemy combat
ants" without interference from the other branches of gov
ernment. Indeed, this is a power granted to the executive
branch in time of war, even those captured on "untraditional
battlefields." The trouble starts with the definition of "enemy
combatant," and the president's broad powers read: abso
lute authority—to name and hold "enemies to the state."
Yes, this amorphous "War on Terror" is different than
other fights; the enemy doesn't have an address or many con-

Crete identifiers. And yes, this puts those charged with pro
tecting the country in a tough spot. With the new rules, there
is no enemy you can name and describe, so also there are no
peace agreements or deals to hand off prisoners after hostili
ties have died down, and significantly no real "end" to hostili
ties.
So far, the Bush Administration has maintained a "lock
the door and throw away the key" approach when it comes to
those suspected of terrorism and the current imbalance of
power has allowed this un-American activity.
But just the threat of due process has prompted talk of re
leasing 140 detainees before Christmas. This, if nothing else,
reveals the constitutional shaky ground the president treads
on.
It's a hard row to hoe: public safety versus protection of
rights. But how many basic civil liberties will America sacrifice
in the Sept. 12 world? Consider: the release of one man in
Guantanamo Bay. He is held for suspected terrorist activities
but there is no proof. Would it be better for the United States
to keep him and run the risk of holding an innocent man for
the rest of his life?
I appreciate how easy it is to say this given I have realisti
cally lost nothing to terrorism, but I would rather a terrorist go
free than an innocent person languish indefinitely in jail.
When one considers the damage one terrorist can do, how
a handful of men destroyed the lives of three thousand people
in one morning two years ago, the one to one ratio I've sug
gested might strain reason. One terrorist is more dangerous to
a community than one free man in jail in the short-term. Tak
ing the longview, I believe the government's disregard for in
nocence or guilt, casting a wide net with little regard for who is
swept up with the grist is more dangerous to American soci
ety.
The Supreme Court has a jurisdictional issue to resolve be
fore even getting to the constitutionality issue, but the court's
first move indicates an attempt to balance the branches of gov
ernment, hopefully replacing policies of fear with America's
higher inclinations.
