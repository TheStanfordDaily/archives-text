# New dean of students named
## 
### ERIC ROSSER ELDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Eight months after the departure of former Dean of Stu
dents Marc Wais, the University has selected Greg Board
man, associate vice president for student affairs at Tulane
University in New Orleans, La., as his permanent replace
ment. He will begin on Feb. 2.
"He has been in student affairs for over 20 years and has
an excellent track record creating and implementing pro
grams to enhance student life," said Gene Awakuni, vice
provost for student affairs, who chaired the search committee.
"He's bright and has great interpersonal skills. Greg really
likes being involved in all aspects of campus life and tries to at
tend as many student events and programs as he can."
In an interview with The Daily yesterday, Boardman
stressed the importance of student leadership on campus.
"The University must avoid leading programs and services
that students might otherwise lead or make decisions that stu
dents should rightfully make on their own," he said. "Exces
sive administrative programming and decision-making de
nies students valuable learning opportunities."
At the same time, he said, the University must maintain
sufficient support and structure for students.
"Balancing these two concepts is an incredibly difficult
role of the Student Affairs, but a necessary and important role
nonetheless," he said.
Students on the search committee said that Boardman is
in a good position to help meet major student concerns, such
as changes made by administration officials to the campus Al
cohol Policy last spring, the role of ethnic community centers
on campus and the inclusion of students in administrative de
cision-making processes.
"Greg exhibited an in-depth understanding of student
perspectives on the subject of Alcohol Policy during sessions
with student leaders," said coterminal student Monica Hene
stroza, who joined the search committee as the undergradu
ate student representative last year when she was ASSU pres
ident.
Boardman believes students are responsible adults and
will promote policy to reflect this, Henestroza said.
"I think Greg's understanding of the [Alcohol Policy] issue
will help the administration in addressing student concerns
that crystallized last spring with the announcement of unpop

ular changes," she said.
Henestroza also said that while student affairs at Tulane
are "not as well developed in services for traditionally under
served communities," she believes that Boardman is will help
increase "needed resources for community centers."
"During Greg's campus visit, he spent some of his free
time on the first night visiting these different centers, intro
ducing himself to students and listening to their concerns

an important first step, and one that reflects his understanding
of the tremendous importance of community centers to the
student community," Henestroza said.
Blake Naughton, a graduate student in the School of Edu
cation who served as the graduate student representative on
the committee, said that Boardman will work to include stu
dents' voices in decision-making, even as reflected in the inclu
sion of students in the committee that helped select Boardman.
"He cares about students and student voice, and diversity
and community relations, so I think he has the potential to
come in here and listen to students well and hear and under
stand what's needed, and he could be a leader to take those in
terests forward," Naughton said.
Senior Nadiya Figueroa, the current ASSU president, said
that students should take it upon themselves to educate the
new dean about issues that are important to them, and what
their expectations are for his position.
"This first year will be about orienting him towards the
University and him setting his goals for the rest of his time as
dean, so it's integral for us as students to let him know what our
expectations are and what issues are important to us," she said.
At Tulane, Boardman oversees a broad array of student
affairs offices including Greek life, multicultural affairs, stu
dent programs, judicial affairs, religious life and housing and
residential life, and he also assists with overseeing career ser
vices, educational resources and counseling, and disability
services.
Awakuni said the dean of students job description has
not changed much since Marc Wais left: Boardman will
oversee the Bechtel International Center, the community
centers, the Office of Judicial Affairs, the Office of Student
Activities and Tresidder Union, and he will be the liaison
with the ASSU.
The interim dean of students, Christine Griffith, who over
sees the Office of Graduate Students, will return to her regu
lar position in that office, Awakuni said.
According to James White, the associated student body
president at Tulane, Boardman was not seeking a new job
when he was contacted by the search firm contracted by
Stanford.
"It's an incredible loss for us, and an incredible gain for
y'all," White said. "He's one of the most student-oriented ad
ministrators at Tulane. He's very easy to talk to. If you have
any kind of difficulty at all, you can discuss it with him."

expectations are and what issues are important to us," she said.
At Tulane, Boardman oversees a broad array of student
affairs offices including Greek life, multicultural affairs, stu
dent programs, judicial affairs, religious life and housing and
residential life, and he also assists with overseeing career ser
vices, educational resources and counseling, and disability
services.
Awakuni said the dean of students job description has
not changed much since Marc Wais left: Boardman will
oversee the Bechtel International Center, the community
centers, the Office of Judicial Affairs, the Office of Student
Activities and Tresidder Union, and he will be the liaison
with the ASSU.
The interim dean of students, Christine Griffith, who over
sees the Office of Graduate Students, will return to her regu
lar position in that office, Awakuni said.
According to James White, the associated student body
president at Tulane, Boardman was not seeking a new job
when he was contacted by the search firm contracted by
Stanford.
"It's an incredible loss for us, and an incredible gain for
y'all," White said. "He's one of the most student-oriented ad
ministrators at Tulane. He's very easy to talk to. If you have
any kind of difficulty at all, you can discuss it with him."
