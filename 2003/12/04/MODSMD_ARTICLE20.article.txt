# Job prospects slightly rosier for seniors
## 
### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This year's senior class faces
slightly better job prospects upon
graduation than the Class of 2003
did, but the outlook is still much
dimmer than during the economic
boom of the late 90s.
According to Bev Principal, as
sistant director of Employment Ser
vices at the Career Development
Center, the number of employers
coming to Stanford almost doubled
this fall compared to last year.
"Last year at this time there
were 100 companies involved with
Cardinal Recruiting, compared
with 190 this fall," she said. "The
number of job openings at these
companies is also greater."
There are also more calls from

employers who have never been to
Stanford or who have not been
here in a few years, Principal
added.
Some students expressed opti
mism about the job market.
"As a computer science major
coming out of Stanford, my
prospects are not too shabby," se
nior Nick Briggs said.
An overall upward trend has
been seen nationally as well. Ac
cording to The Chronicle of Higher
Education, 60 percent of 450 com
panies surveyed said they expect to
increase their hiring or hire at the
same levels as last year, compared
with 55 percent last year.
But despite this seemingly good
news, other indicators paint a less
rosy picture. The number of re
cruiting advertisements in The

Stanford Daily has often been a
barometer of the job market, ac
cording to Daily Business Manager
Ezra Callahan.
"Looking at the long-term pic
ture, The Daily's overall revenues
and recruitment revenues follow the
rise and fall of the dot-com industry
pretty closely," Callahan said.
The numbers of ads in the paper
have fallen sharply since the dot-com
industry collapsed in 2000. In the
2000-2001 fiscal year, 197 recruiting
advertisements were purchased,
compared with just 88 the next year.
So far in the 2003-2004 fiscal year,
just 45 ads have been purchased.
More bad news comes in the
form of the types of recruiters com
ing to campus. Engineering, invest
ment banking and consulting firms
are the most common recruiters on

campus, leaving some fuzzies out in
the cold.
"As a political science major, my
interests don't align with the three
main fields," senior Jenny Bland
said.
Principal acknowledged this dis
advantage, but also pointed to an
increase in recruiters for business
and accounting companies.
"These aren't strongly 'fuzzy'
fields, but they are in that direc
tion," she said.
Even if the job market has im
proved, some seniors can't forget
the employment woes of previous
classes.
"I was frightened last year when
at graduation a group of seniors
was firing parachute men with re
sumes attached into the stands with
a slingshot," Bland said.
