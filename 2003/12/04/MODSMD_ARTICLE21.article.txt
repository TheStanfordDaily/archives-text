# University readies for winter shutdown
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As students finish finals and leave
campus for winter break, Stanford
will institute a winter closure, in ef
fect shutting down the University, to
cut costs.
In the past, the closure was a vol
untary move on the parts of individ
ual departments. This year, the clo
sure is more strictly enforced and will
be extended to two weeks, from Dec.
22 to Jan. 5.
Some parts of the University,
though, will remain open.
"Not all areas can close," said
Susan Herger, director of employee
and labor relations. "There are some
areas that have the kinds of ongoing
research or work that can't close, but
to the extent that it is possible to
close, the University will close."
In a memo sent out on July 9,
Randy Livingston, vice president for
business affairs and chief financial
officer, announced that the Universi
ty will close during the week of Dec.
22 to Dec. 26, except where opera
tions are essential, and strongly en
couraged department heads to close
the following week, Dec. 29 to Jan. 2,
2004. This is different than last year
in duration and severity.
"In the past, we also have tried to
close in between Christmas and New
Year's," Herger said. "We didn't
have a two-week closure, although

last year we did encourage people to
shut down if they could. This is a
stronger encouragement."
Of the departments planning to
comply with the shutdown for the
two-week period, Information Tech
nology Systems and Services has
made it a priority to maintain critical
services during the closure.
"We're cooperating with the Uni
versity's plans to close as many of the
administrative functions as possi
ble," said Nancy Ware, director of
business planning and communica
tion at ITSS. "For us, it's a little com
plicated: It means two things. For the
most part, our offices will be closed,
but we will have staff manning criti
cal applications. Services we current
ly provide to the hospital will not ex
perience any degradation because of
winter closure."
The closing will save the Universi
ty money in two ways: in utility costs
and by employees using their ac
crued vacation time, Livingston said
in his July memo, though the savings
are somewhat offset by the extra em
ployee time off. Employees will re
ceive an extra day off during each of
the two weeks that their departments
remain closed all week, in addition to
scheduled holidays on Dec. 25 and 26
and Jan. 1.
"If [employees] want to maintain
pay [for the remaining days], they
can use paid time off or vacation,"
Herger said. "I don't know for sure,

but it would be my prediction that
people are using paid time off or va
cation to maintain pay."
This is the second year the Uni
versity is implementing a winter clos
ing. Departments are applying expe
rience from last year in planning for
the closing in the coming weeks.
"We've been working with our
clients to make sure that we're avail
able to meet their needs too," Ware
said. "Since we had more advance
warning [this year] that this was what
the University wanted to do, that
meant we could do more effective
planning with our clients."

Though this is a new university
wide policy, it has met success on a
more limited scale in the past. Uni
versity officials believe employees
will approve of the new policy.
"I wouldn't [characterize this
year's policy as significantly different
than the past] because there have
been closures in between Christmas
and New Year's for many years, and
some places, like the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center, have had a win
ter closure for a large number of
years, and it has been well accepted,
and employees look forward to that
time off," Herger said.
