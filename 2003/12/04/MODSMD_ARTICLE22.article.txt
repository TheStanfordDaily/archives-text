# Film studies major may be in the works
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This quarter, there are about
as many undergraduates en
rolled in classes with the words
"film," "cinema" or "documen
tary" in the title as there are en
rolled in classes in the entire De
partment of Cultural and Social
Anthropology, according to
Axess. In response to that kind
of student demand, a new film
studies program is being devel
oped at Stanford to expand the
University's options for areas of
study.
Currently, undergraduate stu
dents can only minor in film stud
ies, but Cognizant Dean for the
Humanities Keith Baker is lead
ing a committee responsible for
creating a new interdisciplinary
Film and Film Studies program.
The Art and Art History De
partment, which currently over
sees the film minor, will house
the new program. The proposal
for a new art department build
ing near the Cantor Arts Center
also includes space for the new
program.
"Our aim in this regard is not
to create a professional 'film
school' but to meet the educa
tional and scholarly challenge of
understanding the nature and
implications of film as an aes
thetic genre, imaginative force
and historical archive," said
Dean of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences Sharon Long.
Long said the program will
enable students to combine aca
demic work with practical expe
rience, citing similar combina
tions in the programs in studio
art, music and drama.
"Our students who are inter
ested in film production will gain
depth through course work, stu
dio experience and workshops
or seminars with visiting artists,"
she said.
Film and Film Studies will in
tegrate programs from the De
partment of Art and Art History,

the Department of Communica
tion, the School of Engineering,
the School of Law and the Grad
uate School of Business.
Prof. Kristine Samuelson, a
member of the committee creat
ing the program, said the Film
and Film Studies major needs to
be approved by various offices in
the University, including those
of Long and Provost John
Etchemendy.
There also needs to be
fundraising for the building and
the program before students will
be able to major in Film and Film
Studies.
Members of the Communica
tion Department's Documen
tary Film and Video Program
will join other faculty who spe
cialize in film studies from vari
ous departments. Additional
Film Studies faculty members
will also be hired, with the first
search underway this year.
"There are so many links
across departments with regard
to film that I think it's really the
right time to pull this together,"
Samuelson said. "Many faculty
members across the humanities
and sciences teach courses relat
ed to film."
Among the institutions that
offer film studies programs are
the University of Southern Cali
fornia, Duke University, North
western University, the Univer
sity of Chicago, Emory, almost
every University of California
campus and five of the eight Ivy
League schools. Of the remain
ing three Ivies, Harvard and
Penn have visual studies pro
grams while Brown has no pro
gram at all.
During Winter Quarter, there
will be 14 Stanford courses for
undergraduates with the words
"film" or "cinema" in their titles,
while the entire Medieval Stud
ies program will offer just 11
courses.
"It's long overdue," said
Samuelson. "There's a huge de
mand for this program."
