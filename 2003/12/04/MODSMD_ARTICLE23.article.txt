## More students turn to private loans to pay for college 
### OLGA NORSTROM WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK An increasing num
ber of college students are turning to private loans to
finance their education despite the risk of sinking
deeper into debt as the gap between the cost of a
college education and federal aid continues to
widen.
The average cost of a four-year private college
education has jumped by 43 percent since 1992,
while federal loan limits have not increased in over a
decade, said Sandy Baum, an economics professor at
Skidmore College. Baum is co-author of the "Trends
in Student Aid Report," which is published annually
and sponsored by the College Board.
Meanwhile, there has been a private loan increase
of 45 percent among undergraduates and 51 percent
among graduates since the 2001-02 academic year.
"Last year students borrowed $6.9 billion from pri
vate lenders," Baum said. "This represents a 477
percent increase from the 1995 academic year."
The total volume of private loans has now sur
passed the amounts awarded annually under the
government-financed federal student educational
grants, Federal Work Study and the Federal Perkins
Loans programs combined, she said.
But while private lending has increased, it still

only comprises 10 percent of the total student loan
volume, said Kenneth Redd, director of research
policy and analysis for the National Association of
Student Aid Administrators.
"Only a minority of all undergraduates about 4
percent receive private loans, but these are gen
erally students attending higher-cost schools like
New York University, or who have very high finan
cial need," Redd said.
The majority of students receiving private loans
are graduate and professional students in the law
and medical fields.
The drawback of private loans is that monthly
payments begin accumulating interest right after
disbursement, so interest accumulates while stu
dents are still attending school.
"While it is a small percentage of students that
borrow from private lenders like Sallie Mae, those
who do turn to private loans are borrowing quite
heavily," said Martha Holler, spokeswoman for Sal
lie Mae. She said 25 percent of private loan borrow
ers perceive themselves as having significant prob
lems with their education debt after graduation.
Excessive debt can affect students' decisions
about their careers, students said.
Jude Divers, an undergraduate in the School of
Continuing and Professional Studies, borrowed
$6,000 in private loans this year. She would like to go

to medical school after graduating from NYU but
considers this pricey dream "iffy" because she does
not want to add to her debt.
Private loans from lenders like Citibank and Sal
lie Mae, unlike federal loans, allow students to bor
row for non-tuition costs like room and board.
Students at NYU can borrow from one of the two
lenders at negative 1 percent interest rates without
fees, said Antonio Del Bono, NYU's director of fi
nancial aid. "These rates are among the lowest in the
country," Del Bono said.
But the lowered rates have not eased some stu
dents' fears about life after graduation.
"My first job out of school, I'll be making a lower
end salary," said Cindy Luff, an NYU graduate stu
dent in occupational therapy who has incurred more
than $lOO,OOO in debt. "Now that these programs are
starting to list these loans on our credit reports, how
am I going to be able to get a car or rent an apart
ment?"
Some students said they were uncertain whether
higher salaries could eventually cover the extra bur
den of education debt.
"The NYU name better get me the kind of job I'll
need to be able to pay my money back," Divers said.
"I'm paying so much for the name, and so far I'm
very disappointed that I am not getting my money's
worth."

A few students said counseling required for fed
eral student loans should be mandated for students
obtaining private loans.
"What is missing is that they don't sit with the stu
dent and strategize," Luff said. "We don't get good
counseling at the Office of Financial Aid. They don't
provide students with any direction."
It is likely that if federal loan limits were in
creased, a significant proportion of the students who
are currently receiving private loans would obtain
more federal loans instead, Baum said.
Congress is considering raising federal loan limits
under the Higher Education Act, which is up for
reauthorization this year. The bill, which called for
colleges to lower their tuition rates in October, pro
poses increases in all forms of federal financial aid,
including grants, loans and work-study.
Other students, like Jessica Ebert, who has bor
rowed over $20,000 in private loans to pay for a
graduate degree in science and environmental re
porting at NYU, consider the cost a good invest
ment.
"It concerns me that I'm here for less than two
years, and my debt will be more than my entire un
dergraduate education," Ebert said. "But I'm here
to learn a craft, and that craft makes me happy. So
even if I have to pay off loans for the next 20 years,
it's worth it."
