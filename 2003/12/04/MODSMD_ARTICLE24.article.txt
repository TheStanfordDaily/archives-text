# UPenn prohibits sororities from identifying themselves
## 
### DAX THOMAS DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN 
(U-WIRE) PHILADELPHIA
Beginning this week, all of the
sorority sisters at the University of
Pennsylvania will disappear.
Starting Monday, every member
of a sorority is forbidden from
wearing her Greek letters. The sis
ters are also prohibited from
telling rushees 400 of whom
have signed up to participate
what sorority they are in.
The Penn sorority women can
talk about the Greek system, but
not about their specific sororities.
"At this point freshman girls
are thinking more about rush,"
College senior and Vice President
of Recruitment on the Panhel
lenic Council Ashley Alexander
said. "We want them making up
their minds during recruitment."
Some Penn freshmen agree
with Panhel's decision.
College freshman Justine
Davidson said this helps to show
that "Greek life isn't as individual
as it may seem."
College freshman Emily Goul
ston said she approved of the Pan
hel rules because they give the
girls who are rushing "more of a
neutral message about the Greek
system."

"It's a good idea because it's
harder to judge Greek sororities
as a whole [when] hearing more of
a biased opinion," Goulston said.
"They would be talking about
how 'my sorority is better than
that sorority.'"
To avoid such problems,
Alexander said that Panhel wants
the girls to choose their sorority
"based on the women they meet at
the recruitment parties."
According to Alexander, these
rules focus on Penn's greek unity
and help provide rushees with an
unbiased view of the Greek sys
tem.
Panhel has also placed an ad
vertising ban on all sorority hous
es. Each sorority will not be able
to publicize any events going on in
its house using methods such as
posting signs on Locust Walk or
placing advertisements in a news
paper.
All women participating in
Panhel rush began an orientation
period that ends today.
During this orientation,
rushees are introduced to the en
tire recruitment process. They re
ceive packets containing informa
tion about the rush process in Jan
uary as well as information about
the sororities on campus.
