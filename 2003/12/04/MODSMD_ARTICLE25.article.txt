## Davis struck by rash of hate crimes 
### ANGELA PANG CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. — When Neil
Henry, a resident of Davis for 11 years, walked
outside his house on the morning of Oct. 26, he
could not believe what he saw: Four eggs were
splattered against his home.
Henry, an African American, said he did not
find any other homes in his neighborhood that
were egged.
"I felt dumbfounded," Henry said. "I don't
know why someone would want to do something
like that."
Henry plans to address the Davis City Council
tonight.
In north Davis on the same day, a homosexual
man in his mid-20s discovered that his SUV had
been drenched with four flats' worth of eggs. The
damage to his vehicle was estimated at approxi
mately $4,000, he said. A gang tag was scrawled on
the vehicle.
His car was one of five egged on his block. One
of the other vehicles egged belonged to an
African American.
The gay victim, who asked that his name be
withheld because his court case is still pending,
said that he felt his vehicle was targeted because
of his sexuality. Outside his home hangs a gay
pride flag.
The victim said he was initially angry, but as
time passed, his anger "turned to feelings of hurt."
"I just felt really sad and upset, and soon I
started having a lot of anxiety," he said. "For the
first two weeks, I couldn't be home alone. I felt re
ally unsafe and scared for the first time living in
Davis."
The victim said that he no longer feels safe
leaving his drapes and windows open. He said that

he is pursuing legal action to prevent future oc
currences.
Neighbors of the gay victim provided enough
information to the Davis Police Department that
authorities were able to arrest one suspect, a 16-
year-old high school student. The case has been
sent to the Yolo County district attorney's office,
said DPD spokesperson Lt. Jim Harritt.
Steven Sabbadini, the suspect's lawyer, de
clined to comment on the case because the law re
quires confidentiality in cases involving juveniles.
Harritt said the DPD is working to identify any
additional perpetrators and that police are inves
tigating Henry's case in connection with the van
dalism in north Davis.
At a Nov. 20 Davis Human Relations Com
mission meeting, DPD Chief Jim Hyde said that
the juvenile suspected of committing the crime
has not identified others who may have been in
volved for fear of retaliation.
Henry said that he was "outraged" and "frus
trated" with the little public knowledge of the
crimes, as well as with the juvenile arrested who
has not disclosed any information about the oth
ers involved.
"This willful hindrance of police process by the
juvenile is, to me, as outrageous and unacceptable
as the crimes," he wrote in a Nov. 22 letter to the
City Council.
Harritt said neighbors of the gay victim report
ed hearing the suspects saying derogatory re
marks pertaining to race and sexuality. Thus, po
lice have classified the two incidents as hate
crimes.
California Penal Code section 422.6 defines a
hate crime as any successful or attempted criminal
act directed against a person(s) based on actual or
perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national
origin, disability, gender or sexual orientation. A

hate crime includes any act that results in injury
however slight a verbal threat of violence
that can be carried out or an act that results in
property damage.
"From our standpoint, we would qualify [what
happened] as a hate crime, but we leave it up to
the district attorney's office to decide how to
charge the case," said Raphael Moore, the lawyer
representing the gay victim.
As of November, these crimes were just two of
11 hate crimes reported to the DPD in 2003.
"I expect the true numbers to be a little higher
than actually reported because not everyone nec
essarily reports a hate crime," Harritt said.
In February, police arrested an 18-year-old
male for spray-painting a racial epithet on a con
crete walkway near the home of an African
American family. The family has since moved.
In addition, Henry said this is not the first time
he has heard of eggings in the city. He said that he
knows a Latino family whose home near his
neighborhood has been egged three times in the
past couple of years.
Cecilia Escamilla Greenwald, chair of the
DHRC, said the commission will hold a special
meeting to discuss hate crimes, racism and homo
phobia in Davis. The meeting will take place on
Dec. 17 at 6:30 p.m. in the Club Room of the Vet
erans Memorial Center, located at 203 W. 14th St.
Greenwald encouraged the public to attend to
show support and discuss any incidents anyone
may be aware of.
"It is my sincere hope that the citizens of Davis
pull together by showing up at this special HRC
meeting, to let people know that we do not want
hate crimes in our community, and to let Dr.
Henry and others that have been the victims of
similar hate crimes know that they are welcome in
our town," she said.

"I just felt really sad and upset, and soon I
started having a lot of anxiety," he said. "For the
first two weeks, I couldn't be home alone. I felt re
ally unsafe and scared for the first time living in
Davis."
The victim said that he no longer feels safe
leaving his drapes and windows open. He said that

he is pursuing legal action to prevent future oc
currences.
Neighbors of the gay victim provided enough
information to the Davis Police Department that
authorities were able to arrest one suspect, a 16-
year-old high school student. The case has been
sent to the Yolo County district attorney's office,
said DPD spokesperson Lt. Jim Harritt.
Steven Sabbadini, the suspect's lawyer, de
clined to comment on the case because the law re
quires confidentiality in cases involving juveniles.
Harritt said the DPD is working to identify any
additional perpetrators and that police are inves
tigating Henry's case in connection with the van
dalism in north Davis.
At a Nov. 20 Davis Human Relations Com
mission meeting, DPD Chief Jim Hyde said that
the juvenile suspected of committing the crime
has not identified others who may have been in
volved for fear of retaliation.
Henry said that he was "outraged" and "frus
trated" with the little public knowledge of the
crimes, as well as with the juvenile arrested who
has not disclosed any information about the oth
ers involved.
"This willful hindrance of police process by the
juvenile is, to me, as outrageous and unacceptable
as the crimes," he wrote in a Nov. 22 letter to the
City Council.
Harritt said neighbors of the gay victim report
ed hearing the suspects saying derogatory re
marks pertaining to race and sexuality. Thus, po
lice have classified the two incidents as hate
crimes.
California Penal Code section 422.6 defines a
hate crime as any successful or attempted criminal
act directed against a person(s) based on actual or
perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national
origin, disability, gender or sexual orientation. A

hate crime includes any act that results in injury
however slight a verbal threat of violence
that can be carried out or an act that results in
property damage.
"From our standpoint, we would qualify [what
happened] as a hate crime, but we leave it up to
the district attorney's office to decide how to
charge the case," said Raphael Moore, the lawyer
representing the gay victim.
As of November, these crimes were just two of
11 hate crimes reported to the DPD in 2003.
"I expect the true numbers to be a little higher
than actually reported because not everyone nec
essarily reports a hate crime," Harritt said.
In February, police arrested an 18-year-old
male for spray-painting a racial epithet on a con
crete walkway near the home of an African
American family. The family has since moved.
In addition, Henry said this is not the first time
he has heard of eggings in the city. He said that he
knows a Latino family whose home near his
neighborhood has been egged three times in the
past couple of years.
Cecilia Escamilla Greenwald, chair of the
DHRC, said the commission will hold a special
meeting to discuss hate crimes, racism and homo
phobia in Davis. The meeting will take place on
Dec. 17 at 6:30 p.m. in the Club Room of the Vet
erans Memorial Center, located at 203 W. 14th St.
Greenwald encouraged the public to attend to
show support and discuss any incidents anyone
may be aware of.
"It is my sincere hope that the citizens of Davis
pull together by showing up at this special HRC
meeting, to let people know that we do not want
hate crimes in our community, and to let Dr.
Henry and others that have been the victims of
similar hate crimes know that they are welcome in
our town," she said.
