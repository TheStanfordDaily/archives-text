# Gov. adviser discusses state energy crisis

### ANNY LIN 
Speakers discussed problems with Califor
nia's electricity supply and offered possible so
lutions at a seminar held on campus Tuesday by
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Re
search and the Foundation for American Com
munications. The seminar highlighted several
distinguished speakers, including Management
Science and Engineering Prof. James Sweeney,
energy adviser to recently inaugurated Califor
nia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The seminar was kicked off by Sweeney's
presentation, during which he gave an overview
of the status of the state's energy supply and
provided reasons for the 2001 energy crisis.
"Although California is a significant energy
producer, it is also a significant energy con
sumer," he said.
Sweeney pointed out that although half of
the state's power supply comes from natural
gas, only 17 percent of that supply comes from
within the state. He emphasized the need for di
versity in sources of energy, since the majority
of the state's natural gas must be brought in
through pipelines, which are unreliable.
He explained that there are two parts to the
energy crisis. The first is the problem with an in
adequate supply of electricity and high whole
sale prices, but according to Sweeney, this prob
lem alone did not cause the energy crisis in
2001.
"California created its own energy crisis,"
Sweeny said. "The electricity crisis was not a
Californian phenomenon, but it affected all of
the West."
According to Sweeney, after the restructur
ing of the state's utilities in 1996, it became
more difficult for investor-owned utilities to
enter into long-term contracts to obtain energy
in times of crisis because there was no guaran
tee that they would be reimbursed by the state.
Previously, it had been normal for utilities to
have these long-term contracts as protection.

Since this safeguard was not in place when
wholesale energy prices skyrocketed, these in
vestor-owned utilities had to buy energy on the
short-term market whose prices were extreme
ly inflated. Meanwhile, since the state had put
price controls in place, the utilities were still
forced to sell at low prices.
"The meltdown was not because of deregula
tions, but in fact due to regulations," Sweeney
said, concluding that California's regulations
against long-term contracts and selling controls
played a large role in the energy crisis.
Economics Prof. Frank Wolak discussed the
need to restructure the natural gas transmission

network to accommodate the change from a ver
tically integrated market to a wholesale market.
"The biggest issue associated with energy re
structuring is the transmission market," Wolak
said.
The current network is meant to serve a
vertically integrated market, where one com
pany has regional control and energy prices
are averaged, as opposed to a wholesale mar
ket, where consumers pay for the price of en
ergy at their location, Wolak said. However,
there is currently no incentive for companies
to upgrade the network because it would ruin
their local monopolies.
