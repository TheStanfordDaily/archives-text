# Naked football player foils alleged robbery
## 
### ANNE CECCARINI CORNELL DAILY SUN 
(U-WIRE) ITHACA, N.Y. At 1:30 a.m.
on Nov. 6, Cornell University senior Mike
Stone stepped out of the shower in his resi
dence at 413 Dryden Rd. to find two men who
had allegedly broken into his apartment.
Stone, a 6-foot-4, 287-pound defensive line
man for the Cornell football team, dropped his
towel and naked tackled one of the per
petrators on his front porch and held the sus
pect until police arrived.
"There have been such a rash of crimes
going around Collegetown [New York],"
Stone said. "Robberies happening constantly,
and the fact that things have gotten to the point
where people can just go into other people's
houses and start picking stuff out of the room
without even thinking about it is scary, and
something needs to be done about it."
Ithaca, N.Y., police later identified the sus
pects as Camilo Rosero and Heider Elhand,
both former employees of Pita Pit restaurant.
"They parted ways with Pita Pit long before
the incident," said Steve Kempf, store manag
er.
Rosero's brother Ivan, a student at Cornell,
was unavailable for comment.
Upon exiting his bathroom, Stone said he saw
two people slinking out of the room of one of
his roommates, senior Tom Calahan. In their

possession were Calahan's laptop and 10 of
Stone's compact discs.
"What the f— are you doing?" Stone said
he demanded. He said the perpetrators reluc
tantly replied, first in Spanish and then in Eng
lish, "We are looking for Cindy." When Stone
responded, "Who the f— is Cindy?" the men
ran for the door.
Stone said he chased after them, dropping
his towel in the process, and tackled one of the
intruders in the door frame of the apartment.
The two scuffled onto the outside porch. Stone
shouted for assistance, and his neighbors
called the police. Ithaca police arrested took
the suspects into custody in connection with
the attempted robbery. Both the computer
and the compact discs were recovered.
"I don't think it's a good idea to go chasing
after every burglar because you never know if
they're armed or anything," Stone said. "But I
didn't have a chance to think in that position
because it is in my nature to be aggressive."
Stone's roommates, Calahan and senior
David Belsky were not home at the time of the
incident.
"Taking the law into his own hands, with no
clothes on nonetheless, Mike Stone really
came up big for me," Calahan said later.
"While it's hard to imagine not having my
computer, it's even more difficult for me to
imagine my life without Mike Stone. We all
feel safe when Mike's around."
