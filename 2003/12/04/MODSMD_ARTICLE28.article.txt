# GSC, Provost discuss child care situation
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
On Tuesday, Provost John
Etchemendy and Graduate Stu
dent Council Chair Steve Allison
met with 10 graduate and three
postdoctoral student parents to
listen to their current problems
with finding affordable child care
and to brainstorm possible solu
tions.
The group took an hour and a
half "to discuss child care exclu
sively" in the Rains Buttery, ac
cording to GSC member Pamela
Ellis, one of the parents who at
tended.
Allison added that the purpose
of the meeting, which was
arranged after a previous discus
sion on the same topic between
Etchemendy, Allison and GSC
Deputy Chair Gayle Christensen,
was "to let the people most famil
iar with child care become the ad
vocates."
Students were invited to at
tend the meeting after responding
to an e-mail announcement that
circulated through campus lists
for post-doctoral students, gradu
ate student events and the Escon
dido Village community.
According to Ellis, bye-mail
ing their pressing concerns in ad
vance of Tuesday's meeting, the
student parents gave
Etchemendy some concerns to re
view beforehand.
Describing the meeting as
"positive and constructive," Alli
son noted that Etchemendy "pa
tiently explained why child care is
a difficult issue for the University,
but was obviously willing to work
toward some solutions."
The group came up with a few
possible avenues towards the goal
of "institutionalizing some type of
support for students," Ellis said,
to match the key resources al
ready available to faculty and
staff, like subsidies for child care
and emergency and back-up care
options.
Sharon Barr, a post-doc in
molecular pharmecology,
claimed she attended the meeting
"in the hopes that the Provost
would recognize that grad student
and postdoc parents are valuable
to Stanford's academic communi
ty and contribute to the brilliance
of Stanford."
In order to "address the fact
that child care costs are a signifi
cant burden for many grad stu
dents and post-docs," Barr ex
pressed hope that the administra
tion will work to establish a child
care subsidy program for those
students.
While she said she was disap
pointed by the lack of positive
feedback to proposals for subsi
dies, Barr recognized that the lim
ited availability of funding makes
the problem of high child care
costs a complicated one to solve.
The lower-cost options that
came up include the allocation of
a fixed number of spaces at on
campus child-care centers to stu
dent parents, allowing them to by

pass waiting lists that are current
ly as long as two to three years.
Ellis added that on-campus
housing policies may make stu
dent parents nervous if they need
to rely on relatives for child care,
since visitors are only permitted
to stay with Escondido Village
residents for two weeks without
penalty.
"You're kind of on edge," Ellis
said of the situation, as those at
tending the meeting agreed.
They also mentioned possible
policies like extending the one
year Escondido Village residency
limit for families and training fac
ulty to better understand the de
mands of parenthood on graduate
and post-doctoral students.
The group also addressed
parking, suggesting that graduate
students be allowed to purchase
more than three daily parking
permits per month so their child
care providers can easily drive to
campus.
To ease the financial burden of
child care, Virginia Matzek, a
mother of two and a graduate stu
dent in biological sciences, sug
gested hiring someone in the
Work Life Office to write child
care grants, in order to provide
students with outside funding
through scholarships derived
from federal block grants.
Matzek, who has previously
applied scholarship monies to
child care at San Francisco State
University, explained that
"there's money out there in the
form of grants that could be used
to provide a similar subsidy" to
what the University's employee
benefits pool offers.
Allison expressed enthusiasm
for proposals like Matzek's, not
ing that "the University would be
receptive to this because it is a
way to create funding where none
exists currently."
While the meeting ended with
out any firm resolution, the next
step for the GSC is to draft a pro
posal for the Provost's office, re
viewing the suggested policies for
better access to child care.
Ellis, as a doctoral student in
the School of Education and a
parent of three herself, claims her
own child care search has ended
in "a lot of different things that
I've patched together."
The broader goal of child care
advocacy efforts, Ellis empha
sized, is not to "be onerous to the
University," but to offer student
parents support that is compara
ble to that at other universities, if
not comparable to the relief that
Stanford currently provides for its
employees.
"Members of the GSC and
the Child Care committee will
continue to advocate for child
care improvements until we see
some concrete results," Allison
explained.
In improving access to child
care, Stanford "should be leading
the field," Matzek said, and "if we
do, the best and most diverse grad
students and post-docs will come
here."

for post-doctoral students, gradu
ate student events and the Escon
dido Village community.
According to Ellis, bye-mail
ing their pressing concerns in ad
vance of Tuesday's meeting, the
student parents gave
Etchemendy some concerns to re
view beforehand.
Describing the meeting as
"positive and constructive," Alli
son noted that Etchemendy "pa
tiently explained why child care is
a difficult issue for the University,
but was obviously willing to work
toward some solutions."
The group came up with a few
possible avenues towards the goal
of "institutionalizing some type of
support for students," Ellis said,
to match the key resources al
ready available to faculty and
staff, like subsidies for child care
and emergency and back-up care
options.
Sharon Barr, a post-doc in
molecular pharmecology,
claimed she attended the meeting
"in the hopes that the Provost
would recognize that grad student
and postdoc parents are valuable
to Stanford's academic communi
ty and contribute to the brilliance
of Stanford."
In order to "address the fact
that child care costs are a signifi
cant burden for many grad stu
dents and post-docs," Barr ex
pressed hope that the administra
tion will work to establish a child
care subsidy program for those
students.
While she said she was disap
pointed by the lack of positive
feedback to proposals for subsi
dies, Barr recognized that the lim
ited availability of funding makes
the problem of high child care
costs a complicated one to solve.
The lower-cost options that
came up include the allocation of
a fixed number of spaces at on
campus child-care centers to stu
dent parents, allowing them to by

pass waiting lists that are current
ly as long as two to three years.
Ellis added that on-campus
housing policies may make stu
dent parents nervous if they need
to rely on relatives for child care,
since visitors are only permitted
to stay with Escondido Village
residents for two weeks without
penalty.
"You're kind of on edge," Ellis
said of the situation, as those at
tending the meeting agreed.
They also mentioned possible
policies like extending the one
year Escondido Village residency
limit for families and training fac
ulty to better understand the de
mands of parenthood on graduate
and post-doctoral students.
The group also addressed
parking, suggesting that graduate
students be allowed to purchase
more than three daily parking
permits per month so their child
care providers can easily drive to
campus.
To ease the financial burden of
child care, Virginia Matzek, a
mother of two and a graduate stu
dent in biological sciences, sug
gested hiring someone in the
Work Life Office to write child
care grants, in order to provide
students with outside funding
through scholarships derived
from federal block grants.
Matzek, who has previously
applied scholarship monies to
child care at San Francisco State
University, explained that
"there's money out there in the
form of grants that could be used
to provide a similar subsidy" to
what the University's employee
benefits pool offers.
Allison expressed enthusiasm
for proposals like Matzek's, not
ing that "the University would be
receptive to this because it is a
way to create funding where none
exists currently."
While the meeting ended with
out any firm resolution, the next
step for the GSC is to draft a pro
posal for the Provost's office, re
viewing the suggested policies for
better access to child care.
Ellis, as a doctoral student in
the School of Education and a
parent of three herself, claims her
own child care search has ended
in "a lot of different things that
I've patched together."
The broader goal of child care
advocacy efforts, Ellis empha
sized, is not to "be onerous to the
University," but to offer student
parents support that is compara
ble to that at other universities, if
not comparable to the relief that
Stanford currently provides for its
employees.
"Members of the GSC and
the Child Care committee will
continue to advocate for child
care improvements until we see
some concrete results," Allison
explained.
In improving access to child
care, Stanford "should be leading
the field," Matzek said, and "if we
do, the best and most diverse grad
students and post-docs will come
here."
