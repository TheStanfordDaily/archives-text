# Many abuse victims are not aware of the danger
## 
### CALEY MEALS BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. Nearly one
half of women who are about to experience a
threat to their lives at the hands of a boyfriend or
husband may not realize they are in danger, ac
cording to new research. The findings are the re
sult of a nationwide study conducted by re
searchers at the Oregon Health and Science
University in Portland in an attempt to curtail
domestic abuse.
According to the report, a look back at warn
ing signs for 30 women who survived an at
tempted homicide by an intimate partner re
vealed that 14 did not know their lives were at
risk and said they were "completely surprised"
by the attack. Also notable is the fact that most
attacks occurred around the time women tried
to end the relationship. And while nearly all
women had experienced previous episodes of
abuse and violence from their partners, not all
instances had been severe.
Lead author of the study, Dr. Christina Nico
laidis of OHSU, said that these findings suggest
that, in some cases, the warning signs that a
woman's life is in danger may be difficult to
read.
"If I had talked to some of these women be
fore the attack, I would have counseled them
about the domestic violence, but I would not
have necessarily felt that their lives were in dan

ger," Nicolaidis said. "Now I am more careful to
warn any woman who has experienced intimate
partner violence about the risk to her life, espe
cially around the time that the relationship is
ending."
In the OHSU study, Nicolaidis and her col
leagues noted that homicide is the leading cause
of death among African-American women be
tween the ages of 15 and 34, and up to half of all
women who are murdered are killed by an inti
mate partner.
The study was conducted through interviews
of 30 women between the ages of 17 and 54 who
had survived an attempted homicide by their
current or former boyfriends or husbands.
All but two of the women had experienced
episodes of violence or controlling behavior, such
as stalking or preventing them from going any
where alone, from the man who tried to kill them.
And while 22 of the homicide attempts oc
curred while the women were trying to end then
relationships, most women said they were
breaking up for reasons other than violence.
According to Nicolaidis, classic risk factors
for an attempted homicide by an intimate
partner include escalating episodes or severi
ty of violence, threats with or use of weapons,
alcohol or drug use, and violence toward chil
dren. While every woman included in the re
port experienced at least one of these stan
dard signs, they were clearly not all "classic"
cases, she added.
