# Rhodes, Marshall scholars hit record number
## 
### VAUHENI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
More Stanford students and recent graduates have been awarded Marshall
and Rhodes scholarships this year than ever before, thanks to a boost in fund
ing for outreach efforts encouraging students to apply.
After senior Jared Cohen and Tess Bridgeman, Class of 2003, won Rhodes
scholarships last week, the British Consulate General yesterday announced
five Stanford winners of Marshall scholarships seniors Marden Nichols,
Nick Rodriguez and Tracy Williams, and recent graduates Sameer Ahmed
and Michael Sulmeyer bringing the total number of winners to seven.
A spokesperson for the British Consulate General in San Francisco attrib
uted the high number of Marshall winners to the "outstanding quality" of the
applicants, which she said reached an "unusually high" level this year.
In recent years, the number of Stanford students applying for and receiv
ing these prestigious awards, sometimes seen as a barometer for a university's
success, dropped to a low. Last year, just one Marshall scholarship was award
ed to a Stanford student, and none received Rhodes scholarships.
"We have always felt there were well-qualified candidates out there who
for various reasons were not applying for these awards," said Carroll McNeill,
a scholarship administrator at the Bechtel International Center who works
closely with John Pearson, the center's director. "We wanted to be very sure
that at least they were informed of the opportunity to do so, and that no po
tential winners were overlooked for lack of publicity."
Increased outreach
Two years ago, Pearson and Rex Jamison, a former Stanford Rhodes
Scholar and retired professor of medicine, approached Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni to bring up their concerns.
"They pointed out that our peer institutions were doing a lot more out
reach to students than we were," Awakuni said. "They felt that with some ad
ditional funds they would be able to do more outreach to students, which they
predicted would generate an increase in the number and quality of the appli
cant pool."

In response, Awakuni said, he offered the Overseas Resource Center
$5,000 to aid its outreach efforts.
"We believe the outreach worked," he said, citing the 50 percent jump this
year in applicants to 48 from 32 last year.
Students who received scholarships said they also received guidance dur
ing the application process.
"The Overseas Resource Center tries to guide you every step of the way
with informational packets, personal statement critiques and incredibly


BETH LIEBERT/The Stanford Daily
prompt and helpful responses to any
questions," said Williams, who will
study international history at the
University of Wales, Aberystwyth.
Williams, along with the other ap
plicants, said she received massive
'Frequently Asked Questions' com
pilations throughout the process. She
was also matched with a mentor who
had been a Rhodes scholar and un
derwent a practice interview at the
Center for Teaching and Learning.
Tough questions
But even with all the help, the
process of becoming a Marshall
scholar is still rigorous. Applicants

must submit four letters of recom
mendation, along with an application
and personal statement and a pro
posal for their program of study.
Once selected for interviews, stu
dents must prepare for questions that
range from hopelessly complicated
to suspiciously simple.
"I was asked what I would do if I
were in charge of military operations
in Baghdad and had a small number
of soldiers to use either to protect the
Baghdad Museum or a hospital, but
not both," said Nichols, who will
study art and archaeology at the Uni
versity of Cambridge and the Cour
tauld Institute of Art in London, re
spectively.
Her answer?
"To me, people are always more
important than 'stuff,' no matter how

precious and inspirational it may be,
so that was a short answer," she said.
For Williams, the most surprising
question was, simply, "How many
hours a week do you dance?"
"I started rambling about how I
have five hours a week of rehearsal
for my performance group,
Decadance, and how there are some
times dances on weekends, and how
my friends and I will dance just about
any time we get the chance, and at
this point I was thinking this question
was probably a test of my ability to
just answer the questions, and that I
should have just said 'five' and left
it," she reflected.
For some, the interview forced
them to look at issues from a differ
ent standpoint.
"I had been explaining to the inter

view committee how I had strongly
disagreed with my one-time boss, Sen
ator [Diane] Feinstein of California,
on a certain issue several summers
ago. One of the committee members
said, 'Pretend that you're Senator Fe
instein and I'm you. Explain to me
why I'm wrong,"' reported Rodriguez,
who plans to study public financial
policy at the London School of Eco
nomics with the hopes of bringing a
more interdisciplinary approach to
economic policy. "The Marshall folks
like to know that you can see these is
sues from multiple sides."
Despite University budget cuts,
Awakuni said his office will again pro
vide $5,000 for outreach this year. The
office of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Affairs has also offered to
pitch in, according to McNeill.

cant pool."

In response, Awakuni said, he offered the Overseas Resource Center
$5,000 to aid its outreach efforts.
"We believe the outreach worked," he said, citing the 50 percent jump this
year in applicants to 48 from 32 last year.
Students who received scholarships said they also received guidance dur
ing the application process.
"The Overseas Resource Center tries to guide you every step of the way
with informational packets, personal statement critiques and incredibly

prompt and helpful responses to any
questions," said Williams, who will
study international history at the
University of Wales, Aberystwyth.
Williams, along with the other ap
plicants, said she received massive
'Frequently Asked Questions' com
pilations throughout the process. She
was also matched with a mentor who
had been a Rhodes scholar and un
derwent a practice interview at the
Center for Teaching and Learning.
Tough questions
But even with all the help, the
process of becoming a Marshall
scholar is still rigorous. Applicants

must submit four letters of recom
mendation, along with an application
and personal statement and a pro
posal for their program of study.
Once selected for interviews, stu
dents must prepare for questions that
range from hopelessly complicated
to suspiciously simple.
"I was asked what I would do if I
were in charge of military operations
in Baghdad and had a small number
of soldiers to use either to protect the
Baghdad Museum or a hospital, but
not both," said Nichols, who will
study art and archaeology at the Uni
versity of Cambridge and the Cour
tauld Institute of Art in London, re
spectively.
Her answer?
"To me, people are always more
important than 'stuff,' no matter how

precious and inspirational it may be,
so that was a short answer," she said.
For Williams, the most surprising
question was, simply, "How many
hours a week do you dance?"
"I started rambling about how I
have five hours a week of rehearsal
for my performance group,
Decadance, and how there are some
times dances on weekends, and how
my friends and I will dance just about
any time we get the chance, and at
this point I was thinking this question
was probably a test of my ability to
just answer the questions, and that I
should have just said 'five' and left
it," she reflected.
For some, the interview forced
them to look at issues from a differ
ent standpoint.
"I had been explaining to the inter

view committee how I had strongly
disagreed with my one-time boss, Sen
ator [Diane] Feinstein of California,
on a certain issue several summers
ago. One of the committee members
said, 'Pretend that you're Senator Fe
instein and I'm you. Explain to me
why I'm wrong,"' reported Rodriguez,
who plans to study public financial
policy at the London School of Eco
nomics with the hopes of bringing a
more interdisciplinary approach to
economic policy. "The Marshall folks
like to know that you can see these is
sues from multiple sides."
Despite University budget cuts,
Awakuni said his office will again pro
vide $5,000 for outreach this year. The
office of the Vice Provost for Under
graduate Affairs has also offered to
pitch in, according to McNeill.
