# Rhodes, Marshall scholars hit record number
## 
### VAUHENI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
More Stanford students and recent graduates have been awarded Marshall
and Rhodes scholarships this year than ever before, thanks to a boost in fund
ing for outreach efforts encouraging students to apply.
After senior Jared Cohen and Tess Bridgeman, Class of 2003, won Rhodes
scholarships last week, the British Consulate General yesterday announced
five Stanford winners of Marshall scholarships seniors Marden Nichols,
Nick Rodriguez and Tracy Williams, and recent graduates Sameer Ahmed
and Michael Sulmeyer bringing the total number of winners to seven.
A spokesperson for the British Consulate General in San Francisco attrib
uted the high number of Marshall winners to the "outstanding quality" of the
applicants, which she said reached an "unusually high" level this year.
In recent years, the number of Stanford students applying for and receiv
ing these prestigious awards, sometimes seen as a barometer for a university's
success, dropped to a low. Last year, just one Marshall scholarship was award
ed to a Stanford student, and none received Rhodes scholarships.
"We have always felt there were well-qualified candidates out there who
for various reasons were not applying for these awards," said Carroll McNeill,
a scholarship administrator at the Bechtel International Center who works
closely with John Pearson, the center's director. "We wanted to be very sure
that at least they were informed of the opportunity to do so, and that no po
tential winners were overlooked for lack of publicity."
Increased outreach
Two years ago, Pearson and Rex Jamison, a former Stanford Rhodes
Scholar and retired professor of medicine, approached Vice Provost for Stu
dent Affairs Gene Awakuni to bring up their concerns.
"They pointed out that our peer institutions were doing a lot more out
reach to students than we were," Awakuni said. "They felt that with some ad
ditional funds they would be able to do more outreach to students, which they
predicted would generate an increase in the number and quality of the appli
cant pool."

In response, Awakuni said, he offered the Overseas Resource Center
$5,000 to aid its outreach efforts.
"We believe the outreach worked," he said, citing the 50 percent jump this
year in applicants to 48 from 32 last year.
Students who received scholarships said they also received guidance dur
ing the application process.
"The Overseas Resource Center tries to guide you every step of the way
with informational packets, personal statement critiques and incredibly
