## Dating like we aren't 99 
### 
While students don't have
enough sex in their lives
(as if it were possible),
it's even more apparent
that they don't have enough romance.
Like old married couples, students at
Stanford go out on dates about as
often as Barbra Bush changes her hair
color. The typical Stanford date is a
trip to the CoHo, a place so horrifical
ly loud it's unlikely you'll be able to
hear your own thoughts, let alone
your date's. About the farthest I've
heard a Stanford couple traveling on a
date is to the linear accelerator, but
they were two physics majors doing a
research project so it doesn't count.
What's wrong with us? I know it's

hard to get off cam
pus, but this is it folks.
If you ever want to ex
perience romance in
your life, it's probably
not going to happen
when you're 20 some
thing, finishing grad
school and choosing
between paying your
student loans and eat
ing, or when you're 30
something, still trying

to finish grad school and trying to keep
your screaming kids from feeding the
family hamster, Pinky, to the family
snake, Slinky. Between starvation and
Pinky and Slinky, there' just not
enough time for dating and after about
40 it's pretty much over anyway (kid
ding mom, dad, various professors).
So get out there while you or your
partner can still get up you know
down there.
The location of your date should
depend on how long you've been see
ing the person. For couples that have
been dating for a while and are com
fortable with each other, a secluded
place is best. If you can snag a driver's
license from a local Palo Altoan, (and
by snag I mean borrow, you crazy
kleptomaniac) I recommend Foot
Hills Park off Page Mill Road. If you
go after class on a Thursday or even on
a Friday, chances are you'll have the
tree dotted, football field length lawn
surrounded by dense forest covered
hills mostly, if not entirely, to your
selves. If you can't find a Palo Alto li
cense, try the beach, though I warn
you, sex experts aren't kidding when
they say that sand gets everywhere.
Bring a blanket to he on, food to
eat and, if you're interested in fully ex
periencing the outdoors, condoms.
The romantic part is that you'll be
alone together with no distractions
and nature as a backdrop. Real quiet
and seclusion is rare at Stanford. Get
ting away from ever-present room
mates, screaming Cardinal fans, loud
dorms and even louder frat parties
will give you and your partner a
chance to focus on just you. Find out if
you still like the person you've been
seeing for months, but haven't really
talked to in weeks. Strengthen the re
lationship by getting away from the
chaos that is Stanford.
If you've just started seeing some
one, don't jump head first into spend
ing solid hours alone with them.
About 10 minutes into the date you'll
realize that you've run out of things to
say, something easily remedied in a
well-established relationship by mak
ing out or having sex. If you're geeky
like that, going to the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art to stare into
blobs of paint you'll hardly compre
hend isn't a bad idea. Museums are a
good place for dates in the beginning
of a relationship because silences
aren't awkward, but part of the at
mosphere. Though trite, a date at the
movies provides the same benefit: It's
a requirement to be silent, so there's
no awkwardness.
I urge creativity because creativity
in and of itself will keep the two of you
from becoming bored or feeling awk
ward. Go to the Jelly Belly Factory,
the Exploratorium or even to the San
Francisco Zoo. Bring you and your
date's favorite music and go for a long
drive up Page Mill Road. No matter
what you do with your date, any
thing's better than taking them to
FLiCKS on a Sunday night.
Remember, it doesn't really mat
ter where you take your guy or girl.
Your focus doesn't have to be to im
press your date. The goal is to be
alone with the person you care about
(or, you know, want to get on).
