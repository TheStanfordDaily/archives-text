# BANANA SLUG BOBBITS
## 
### KERRY GRENS 
It's that time of year again: The days near their shortest length, shopping malls swell
with holiday traffic, Minnesotans plug in their cars, Chicagoans salt their driveways and
Buffalo warms up a team of snow plows. Meanwhile, here in California we peer out to
green hillsides from under the hoods of rain slickers as banana slugs emerge from their leaf
fitter beds to bite off each other's penises. Indeed, some of the kinkiest creatures in the an
imal kingdom live just outside our doorstep, and their bizarre behavior is a model for the
wondrous and myriad tactics sexual reproduction has evolved including some that are
not so different from our own.

From the coast of
southern California to
the mountains of western
Oregon banana slugs
slowly roam in search of
food and mates. Though
they mate more frequent
ly during the spring and
summer months, estiva
tion or hiding out during
hot, dry days, prevents
them from easy visibility.
But as temperatures
dwindle and skies drizzle,
these mustard-colored
critters can be seen dot
ting trails and tree stumps
like the senesced bay
leaves in which they cam
ouflage themselves, and
behaving in some pretty
spectacular ways.
In addition to
apophally the nipping
off of a partner's penis
after copulation some
banana slugs engage in
reciprocal fertilization.
As hermaphrodites (and
without having an inter
nal skeleton to get in the
way) they are able to fer
tilize one another simul
taneously. According to
Dr. John Pearse, profes
sor emeritus at the Uni
versity of California-
Santa Cruz, "the Santa
Cruz species has a long
penis, and individuals are
able to copulate (both
acting as both sexes) for
many hours."
There are several
species in the San Fran
cisco area, and to the
novice observer they may
look very similar. Howev
er, more subtle differ
ences exist. "The San
Mateo species has a larg
er, stouter penis, and in
dividuals usually copu
late as either a male or fe
male repeatedly, with
each copulation lasting
about ten minutes,"
Pearse said.
Occasionally, one
partner's penis may be
come stuck in the other,
and the solution is to sever
the organ. It is unclear

whether the penis grows back or if the remaining stump allows the animal to continuing re
producing as a male. Although penis-biting may seem abominable compared to conven
tional human sexual strategies (that is, if you leave out Lorena Bobbit), interpretations of
the behavior are very similar to theories of our own reproductive tactics.
In an April 2002 letter to the scientific journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Heike
Reise mentions several theories attempting to rationalize apophally in banana slugs. For

one, the severed penis may serve as a plug in the partner's female reproductive tract. By
limiting other slugs, access to the eggs, a plug discourages sperm competition. Primates are
also known to use sperm plugs to increase their chances of successful fertilization. Some
monkeys, for example, ejaculate a coagulant mass following semen that can clog the recip
ient's vagina and block future suitors, sperm from reaching the egg.
Another theory describes how a penis plug, if eaten by the recipient, may serve as a nu
tritional supplement for newly fertilized eggs. In this case, the severed partner is con
tributing to the health and resources of its progeny. Offering food is a common method in
males of other species to ensure the health of their offspring, though some offer their de
votion in a more extreme way: letting their partners completely devour them. Male black

widow spiders and preying
mantises offer themselves to
the female as a meal after
fertilizing her eggs, which
ensures that she will be fit to
nurture the eggs, develop
ment. Human males also
sacrifice resources to their
offspring, by sharing food
and shelter, and offering
protection.
A third theory of apophal
lation assumes that the re
maining bit of penis is non
functional, and, therefore,
all resources are devoted to
the eggs that the intact part
ner has just fertilized in the
severed partner. The sev
ered partner cannot use its
energy and time to act as a
male to fertilize other slugs,
and thus may divert this en
ergy to its developing eggs.
By severing the penis of the
recently fertilized slug, the
intact partner assures its
sperm investment is well
cared for.
Brooke Weaver and Janet
Leonard at the University of
California-Santa Cruz hy
pothesize that slugs will only
mate with a partner who is
functional as both male and
female. Therefore, despite
an intact female reproduc
tive system, an apophallic
slug is as attractive as a ba
nana. In such a way, the in
tact partner has no fears that
its sperm will be out compet
ed or that its progeny will not
have sufficient nutrients.
The observation that both
partners may engage in
apophally supports their
claim.
The complete repertoire
of banana slug mating be
havior has yet to be discov
ered. For one, is it a mystery
how promiscuous slugs are
in the wild. No one even
knows how long they may
live, nor how many times
they may reproduce in one
lifetime. For Pearse, most
fascinating are the enigmatic
evolutionary forces that
have shaped genital mor
phology and habitat range, or
biogeography. "Particularly

interesting is that four slug forms occur in the Bay Area, almost neatly divided by county,
with overlap in Santa Clara County how did that happen?"
Genetics will most likely be the approach that will give us the next big breakthroughs in
understanding banana slug biology. But with some waterproof boots, a sharp eye and many
hours to spend crouched beneath the trees, even a beginning naturalist could contribute to
unraveling the fascinating sex life of the banana slug.

also known to use sperm plugs to increase their chances of successful fertilization. Some
monkeys, for example, ejaculate a coagulant mass following semen that can clog the recip
ient's vagina and block future suitors, sperm from reaching the egg.
Another theory describes how a penis plug, if eaten by the recipient, may serve as a nu
tritional supplement for newly fertilized eggs. In this case, the severed partner is con
tributing to the health and resources of its progeny. Offering food is a common method in
males of other species to ensure the health of their offspring, though some offer their de
votion in a more extreme way: letting their partners completely devour them. Male black

widow spiders and preying
mantises offer themselves to
the female as a meal after
fertilizing her eggs, which
ensures that she will be fit to
nurture the eggs, develop
ment. Human males also
sacrifice resources to their
offspring, by sharing food
and shelter, and offering
protection.
A third theory of apophal
lation assumes that the re
maining bit of penis is non
functional, and, therefore,
all resources are devoted to
the eggs that the intact part

severed partner. The sev

energy and time to act as a
male to fertilize other slugs,
and thus may divert this en

It's that time of year again: The days near their shortest length, shopping malls swell
with holiday traffic, Minnesotans plug in their cars, Chicagoans salt their driveways and
Buffalo warms up a team of snow plows. Meanwhile, here in California we peer out to
green hillsides from under the hoods of rain slickers as banana slugs emerge from their leaf
fitter beds to bite off each other's penises. Indeed, some of the kinkiest creatures in the an
imal kingdom live just outside our doorstep, and their bizarre behavior is a model for the
wondrous and myriad tactics sexual reproduction has evolved including some that are
not so different from our own.

From the coast of
southern California to
the mountains of western
Oregon banana slugs
slowly roam in search of
food and mates. Though
they mate more frequent
ly during the spring and
summer months, estiva
tion or hiding out during
hot, dry days, prevents
them from easy visibility.
But as temperatures
dwindle and skies drizzle,
these mustard-colored
critters can be seen dot
ting trails and tree stumps
like the senesced bay
leaves in which they cam
ouflage themselves, and
behaving in some pretty
spectacular ways.
In addition to
apophally the nipping
off of a partner's penis
after copulation some
banana slugs engage in
reciprocal fertilization.
As hermaphrodites (and
without having an inter
nal skeleton to get in the
way) they are able to fer
tilize one another simul
taneously. According to
Dr. John Pearse, profes
sor emeritus at the Uni
versity of California-
Santa Cruz, "the Santa
Cruz species has a long
penis, and individuals are
able to copulate (both
acting as both sexes) for
many hours."
There are several
species in the San Fran
cisco area, and to the
novice observer they may
look very similar. Howev
er, more subtle differ
ences exist. "The San
Mateo species has a larg
er, stouter penis, and in
dividuals usually copu
late as either a male or fe
male repeatedly, with
each copulation lasting
about ten minutes,"
Pearse said.
Occasionally, one
partner's penis may be
come stuck in the other,
and the solution is to sever
the organ. It is unclear

whether the penis grows back or if the remaining stump allows the animal to continuing re
producing as a male. Although penis-biting may seem abominable compared to conven
tional human sexual strategies (that is, if you leave out Lorena Bobbit), interpretations of
the behavior are very similar to theories of our own reproductive tactics.
In an April 2002 letter to the scientific journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Heike
Reise mentions several theories attempting to rationalize apophally in banana slugs. For

one, the severed penis may serve as a plug in the partner's female reproductive tract. By
limiting other slugs, access to the eggs, a plug discourages sperm competition. Primates are
also known to use sperm plugs to increase their chances of successful fertilization. Some
monkeys, for example, ejaculate a coagulant mass following semen that can clog the recip
ient's vagina and block future suitors, sperm from reaching the egg.
