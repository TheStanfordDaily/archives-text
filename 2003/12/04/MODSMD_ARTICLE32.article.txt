# Answer Girl gets to the 'root' of the problem

QMy dentist says I need to have my
wisdom teeth removed like every
body else, but I think this is quack
medicine. People 100 years ago
didn't have oral surgeons to take their wis
dom teeth out, and they were just fine. How
are humans today any different?
A Well first of all, while there
XM might be a few cases in which it's
/ M OK to think, "If my great gram-
JL. JL ma didn't do it, I won't either,
this isn't one of them.
That's because, in all likelihood, she did
get her wisdom teeth removed. And proba
bly your great grampa did as well. In fact, be

tween the two of them, they might have had
loads of teeth out including the non-wis-

dom kind.
I'm not saying this so I
can make some random in
sult about your family. Be
cause you know, I could
have. But since I'm not
mean like Barrett "I'm a
mean guy" Sheridan also
known as Answer Boy
I'm not going to. After all,
I'm sure they must have
been great folks. And hey,

even if they weren't, it's not like I would ever
say that to them. But that's not because I'm â€”
say, pusillanimous or something it's just
that I always try to be polite.

At any rate, to answer your question: You
see, a century ago, the most common solu
tion to a toothache was simply to pull out the
mischievous tooth. And, considering that
people back then weren't as big on dental hy
giene as they are now, that means that tooth
pulling was practically a hobby for them.
(OK, maybe not a hobby.)
But that aside, it seems like what you
were really meaning to ask was, "People
didn't always get their wisdom teeth re
moved, so how come now everyone feels like
they have to get their wisdom teeth out?"
The answer to this is that most people
today don't have room in their mouth for
them, and so keeping those buggers in can
lead to complications and infection later. I
mean, that's why people started taking them

out in the first place.
See, wisdom teeth weren't always a prob
lem. Apparently there's a theory that they
did play a useful role a long time ago (and I
mean a long, long time ago like the Ne
olithic Era), because humans ate a more
abrasive diet and had more cavities, so they
needed "backup" teeth.
But I'm not saying you should go chew on
some bark or something. As a piece of friend
ly advice, I recommend that you take up your
dentist's offer and save yourself the trouble
you deserve it. And let me just tell you, I
mean that from the bottom of my heart.
