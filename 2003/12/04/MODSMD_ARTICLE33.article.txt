## Strippingfor money and competition 
### 
Side note: I did go to Big Game, and
no, I didn't pay for it. I got in free,
along with "friends" of Axe Comm
members, groups of fence-jumpers
and Cal's entire freshman class. I won't tell
you how.
Big Game in a nutshell: Stanford lost,
there was a nice stunt with a woodchipper
and Cal's cheerleaders are way hotter than
ours.
Big Splash was a different story. For
every Stanford female / bi-curious / drama
queen / lover of Michelangelo's Statue of
David, head over to a men's water polo
match and be glad. Forget about your
dorky hallmates who would have at least
ditched the tapered jeans had you gone to
a "normal" school, stop going to the B
school cafe to check out the guys (B is for
Business) and banish the thought that you
are worse off here than you were at your

femi-Nazi all-girls high
school, where it was okay
to take your cousin to
prom. I took my friend's
brother, but that's beside
the point. (And this was
in SoCal, not Nebraska.)
For that matter, has any
thing good ever come out
of Texas? Besides Tex-
Mex food.
Men's water polo is

pure therapy. Fourteen bronzed, sleek
bodies, wearing almost nothing. From the
stands they even look naked. Now split
them into two teams, and have them try to
score on each other a la soccer with hands.
Put it all in a pool of glistening water and
the sight is amazing. Chiseled shoulders
pop out of every corner of the pool. Op
posing teammates scuffle and water wres
tle. And with seven-minute quarters, you
stay riveted the whole time.
Granted, the crowd is blonder than a
Sunday afternoon in Redondo Beach, but
even the spectators are hot. And it doesn't
matter if you think the players are cute in
real life, they all look beautiful in the pool.
Or in those plush robes they wear on the
sidelines. They all live in Kappa Alpha by
the way.
I know, I know, I'm committing some
great travesty to the sport of water polo.
The nuances of strategy and execution are
lost on me. What kind of spectator just
stares at the players?
Hey, it was my first time watching. I
learned something about a red, yellow and
green zones and about what kinds of "con
tact" are okay or punishable. Is the specta
tor expected to be a conscientious student
of the sport or can I just get whatever I
want out of it? Was I wrong to go to
Dodger games as a child just for the Car
nation chocolate shakes? If your average
strip club patron is glued to the topless
woman gyrating on his crotch instead of
appreciating the athleticism and sophisti
cation of the pole dance, is he in the
wrong? Does the spectator's view define
what is sport and what isn't?
Because for those of you who have
never been, or aren't in tune, stripping is
an artistic-athletic feat. It shares charac
teristics with gymnastics, ballet, jazz, hip
hop and Cirque du Soleil, depending on
the dancer. In fact, at most circus schools
in the United States you can sign up for
pole classes, and they will teach you how
to maneuver and manipulate the pole.
Clothed.
No, I'm not calling stripping a sport. It's
a social definition anyway whether op
posing teams are in competition, whether
it is physically exerting, whether it is tradi
tionally a sport, blah blah blah. Bowling?
Golf? Synchronized swimming? Cheer
leading? Oh wait, how about rifle shoot
ing, bodybuilding or "American Gladia
tors" for that matter? Dog shows? And so
forth.
I am calling it a feat. So next time you
get in the pool and see how much of your
body you can get above the surface tread
ing water, go to a playground or fireman's
pole and try to hold on upside down by just
your legs and climb upwards. In six-inch
spiked heels.
I once told MTV I wanted them to train
me to be a world-class pole dancer. They
were doing interviews for whatever that
dumb show is called where they make
short kids CK models and the otherwise
lame and awkward into high school stars.
The lady took an uncomfortable pause
and asked me if I would like to be a cheer
leader. Um, maybe for UCLA.
Okay, it's taboo, uncomfortable, hid
den some would say the work of the
devil but strip clubs are out there. In
various sizes and shapes. And while the
rest of the feminist movement and Evan
gelical Christianity argue over rights and
morals, I would simply like to take a mo
ment and appreciate the strippers out
there. Because pole dancing good qual
ity pole dancing is an art and a skill
whether you're in the Cirque's Zumanity
or the Crazy Horse.
Props to the strippers out there.
