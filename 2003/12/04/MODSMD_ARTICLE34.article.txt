# Worst home loss ever for Card
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team was hoping to con
clude its season with a morale-boosting win over
Notre Dame and former coach Tyrone Willingham
in his first return to the Farm. The Cardinal was
hoping to secure a little positive momentum head
ing into the offseason and send out its 13 seniors on
a high note.
But instead, Stanford was embarrassed like it
had never been before on its home turf and the
team is left with a lingering bitterness over some
Irish antics.
Stanford ended the 2003 season on Saturday
with a humiliating, depressing 57-7 pasting at the
hands of Notre Dame the worst home loss in 96
years of school history. (The previous worst home
loss in school history was 49-0 to UCLA in 1987.
The Stanford records do not include the point dif
ferential during the rugby years of 1912-1917 and
the unofficial World War I season of 1918.)
The Cardinal (4-7) put itself behind the 8-ball
with a truly anemic first-quarter showing. The Irish
(5-6) racked up 210 total yards to Stanford's nine
and scored three times to jump ahead 21-0 and
completely deflate everyone in cardinal red uni
forms.

Notre Dame running back Julius Jones was the
star of the evening. He had 74 yards on the game's
opening drive and finished with a mind-boggling
218 yards and a 9.5 yard-per-carry average. Addi
tionally, Irish quarterback Brady Quinn threw
touchdown passes of 65 and 45 yards, running back
Ryan Grant had three touchdown runs and the
Notre Dame defense returned two Stanford fum
bles for touchdowns.
"We didn't play," said senior quarterback Chris
Lewis. "We didn't tackle, we didn't get first downs
[and] we turned the ball over for touchdowns."
The lone bright spot for Stanford was wide re
ceiver Mark Bradford, who caught six passes for
116 yards and a 65-yard touchdown in the third
quarter that prevented the Cardinal from being
shut out twice in the same season for the first time
since 1962.
Though the action was handily one-sided on the
field, there was plenty of off-the-field controversy
leading up to and after the game.
First, in Saturday's Oakland Tribune, Stanford
offensive coordinator David Kelly was asked about
his feelings about facing a number of ex-Stanford
coaches including Willingham, defensive coor
dinator Kent Baer and offensive coordinator Bill


BETH LIEBERT/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford football team ended its season with the worst home loss in school history, a 57-7 drubbing at the hands of its former coach, Tyrone Willingham, and the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame. Still, according to Athletic Director Ted Leland, Buddy Teevens will remain head coach.
Diedrick.
"This game is personal," Kelly
said. "Some people at Notre Dame
continue to feel they're experts on
what's going on in the Stanford pro
gram. My advice to them is to focus
on the Notre Dame program."
This was probably deemed bul
letin-board material for the Irish.
Willingham had no official state
ment on Kelly's comments after the
game, though he did smile when
asked about them.
Fast forward to a few minutes be
fore kickoff. The 13 Stanford seniors
were in the middle of being honored
in an on-field tribute with loved ones
when, suddenly, the entire Notre
Dame team sprinted onto the field
right through the ceremony
and took their place on the opposing
sideline.

Needless to say, several Cardinal
players were miffed by the behavior
of Willingham and his team.
"I felt like it was very disrespect
ful when they came on the field while
the senior tribute was going on," se
nior wide receiver Luke Powell said.
"It was uncalled for."
Added Teevens: "I wouldn't do
something like that. But people do
what they do."
Then, with 4:49 left in a game they
led by 50 points, the Irish attempted
a fake punt at midfield when punter
D.J. Fitzpatrick took the snap and
tossed a pass to wideout Chinedum
Ndukwe who came up three
yards short of the first down.
That wasn't the issue, though.
Going for it on fourth down when a
team is up by 50 points was the prob
lem.
Willingham maintained he wasn't
trying to run up the score.
"That was a call on our part,"
Willingham said. "Stanford was
lined up defensively in a way that

caused us to try the fake punt.
"You don't like to do that. But
when they put all of their guys up
there in the box to try and block the
kick, you've got to make them pay."
Teevens said he wasn't bothered
by Willingham's decision, but the
call clearly animated a deadened
Stanford bench.
And, finally, what about the ques
tion everyone wants answered?
What of Teevens' future at the
school?
Apparently, his job is safe for
now.
Stanford Athletic Director Ted
Leland told the San Jose Mercury
News that Teevens, who has three
years remaining on his existing con
tract, has no reason to be concerned
with his job security.
"Buddy's future is fine," Leland
said. "I'm just very disappointed in
how we played. This is not indicative
of the way we want to play Stanford
football."
Teevens seemed to show Leland,

along with Stanford's alumni and
fans, that the Cardinal was headed in
the right direction with back-to-back
wins over Arizona State and UCLA
that put his team in bowl contention.
But Stanford ended the season with
three straight losses and was
outscored 128-26.
Teevens is 6-16 in his first two
seasons on the Farm.
By comparison, in Willingham's
first two years, the Cardinal went 14-
9-1 and reached bowl games each
year-including Stanford's 38-0 win
over Michigan State in the 1996 Sun
Bowl that represented the school's
largest margin of victory in bowl
game history.
Powell, for one, believes the
blame for a second-consecutive los
ing season needs to be passed
around.
"I think a lot of the criticism for
the coaching staff is unwarranted,"
he said. "There are a lot of things the
players need to take the blame for.
"I hope people give the coaching

staff a valid chance and stop being
so critical. They are good people
and they know what they are
doing."
Looking back, Stanford's season
was nothing short of a rollercoaster
ride. Two opening wins made things
look great. Four consecutive losses
seemed to take steam out of the
team. Two surprising victories at
home seemed to salvage the year
and put the club in bowl contention.
And then this ugly ending.
"It is a foundation for the next
three-to-four seasons," said senior
left tackle Kirk Chambers. "The last
three games, we had a chance to get
ourselves back on track and to where
we wanted to be.
"Things didn't turn out like we
wanted. But I really look forward to
following the team next year. The
youth will grow older and be more
experienced."
Like Chambers explained, all
Stanford can do now is look to the fu
ture. Teevens and company can take

solace that those 47 true or redshirt
freshmen including the quarter
back of the future Trent Edwards
will be a year older. The entire start
ing defense minus lineman Louis
Hobson will return. And now the
Cardinal has a virulent memory to
draw on in the coming months.
"We want to keep this loss in our
heads and use it as motivation in the
offseason," said wide receiver Greg
Camarillo.
A few odds-and-ends with the
season completed:
Chambers ended his career by
starting his 45th consecutive game at
left tackle. He started every game for
the Cardinal in the last four years.
Lewis finished his career eighth
on the schools' career passing list
(4,346) seventh in career touchdown
passes (33) and eighth in career total
offense (4,328).
Cardinal punter Eric Johnson set
new school records for punt at
tempts (86) and most punting yards
in a season (3,678).
