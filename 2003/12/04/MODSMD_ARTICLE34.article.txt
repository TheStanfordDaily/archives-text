# Worst home loss ever for Card
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford football team was hoping to con
clude its season with a morale-boosting win over
Notre Dame and former coach Tyrone Willingham
in his first return to the Farm. The Cardinal was
hoping to secure a little positive momentum head
ing into the offseason and send out its 13 seniors on
a high note.
But instead, Stanford was embarrassed like it
had never been before on its home turf and the
team is left with a lingering bitterness over some
Irish antics.
Stanford ended the 2003 season on Saturday
with a humiliating, depressing 57-7 pasting at the
hands of Notre Dame the worst home loss in 96
years of school history. (The previous worst home
loss in school history was 49-0 to UCLA in 1987.
The Stanford records do not include the point dif
ferential during the rugby years of 1912-1917 and
the unofficial World War I season of 1918.)
The Cardinal (4-7) put itself behind the 8-ball
with a truly anemic first-quarter showing. The Irish
(5-6) racked up 210 total yards to Stanford's nine
and scored three times to jump ahead 21-0 and
completely deflate everyone in cardinal red uni
forms.

Notre Dame running back Julius Jones was the
star of the evening. He had 74 yards on the game's
opening drive and finished with a mind-boggling
218 yards and a 9.5 yard-per-carry average. Addi
tionally, Irish quarterback Brady Quinn threw
touchdown passes of 65 and 45 yards, running back
Ryan Grant had three touchdown runs and the
Notre Dame defense returned two Stanford fum
bles for touchdowns.
"We didn't play," said senior quarterback Chris
Lewis. "We didn't tackle, we didn't get first downs
[and] we turned the ball over for touchdowns."
The lone bright spot for Stanford was wide re
ceiver Mark Bradford, who caught six passes for
116 yards and a 65-yard touchdown in the third
quarter that prevented the Cardinal from being
shut out twice in the same season for the first time
since 1962.
Though the action was handily one-sided on the
field, there was plenty of off-the-field controversy
leading up to and after the game.
First, in Saturday's Oakland Tribune, Stanford
offensive coordinator David Kelly was asked about
his feelings about facing a number of ex-Stanford
coaches including Willingham, defensive coor
dinator Kent Baer and offensive coordinator Bill

The Stanford football team ended its season with the worst home loss in school history, a 57-7 drubbing at the hands of its former coach, Tyrone Willingham, and the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame. Still, according to Athletic Director Ted Leland, Buddy Teevens will remain head coach.
