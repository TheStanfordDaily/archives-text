# Buddy causes unfriendly holiday weekend for Scott

"j- ebraska head coach
|\ I Frank Solich was fired Sat-

\l urday night. On the
JL N surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surpris
ing, given 'tis the season for
college football coaches to get
the axe (or keep it if you're
Jeff Tedford). But when you
consider the fact that hours
earlier his Huskers defeated
rival Colorado to complete a
9-3 season, and that Solich
won more than 75 percent of

his games during his six-year stint in
Lincoln, it's a wonder he wasn't given
a raise.
Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens paced the sidelines of a half
empty Stanford Stadium Saturday

night. On the surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surprising, given

his team was playing a foot
ball game at the time. But
when you consider the fact
that the Cardinal was in the
midst of a humiliating 57-7
loss to Notre Dame, the worst
home loss in Stanford football
history, it's a wonder he didn't
stop pacing and resign on the
spot.
Sure, given the entirely dif
ferent circumstances sur-

rounding both coaches, it's unfair to
compare Solich's situation to
Teevens'. Yes, Nebraskans are as ob
sessive about football as they are
