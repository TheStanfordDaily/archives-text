# Buddy causes unfriendly holiday weekend for Scott
## 
### 
"j- ebraska head coach
|\ I Frank Solich was fired Sat-

\l urday night. On the
JL N surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surpris
ing, given 'tis the season for
college football coaches to get
the axe (or keep it if you're
Jeff Tedford). But when you
consider the fact that hours
earlier his Huskers defeated
rival Colorado to complete a
9-3 season, and that Solich
won more than 75 percent of

his games during his six-year stint in
Lincoln, it's a wonder he wasn't given
a raise.
Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens paced the sidelines of a half
empty Stanford Stadium Saturday

night. On the surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surprising, given

his team was playing a foot
ball game at the time. But
when you consider the fact
that the Cardinal was in the
midst of a humiliating 57-7
loss to Notre Dame, the worst
home loss in Stanford football
history, it's a wonder he didn't
stop pacing and resign on the
spot.
Sure, given the entirely dif
ferent circumstances sur-

rounding both coaches, it's unfair to
compare Solich's situation to
Teevens'. Yes, Nebraskans are as ob
sessive about football as they are


Scott Allen
about corn and Teevens faces the
challenge of recruiting talented foot
ball players who also possess the aca
demic track record to be admitted to
Stanford. Therefore, expecting the
Cardinal to consistently compete on
the same level as Oklahoma, Nebras
ka and even USC, is expecting too
much.
But coming off consecutive 2-9 and
4-7 seasons, including three especially
bad losses to Oregon, Oregon State
and Notre Dame not to mention a
second straight loss to Cal this
year, it's time to re-evaluate the deci
sion to bring Buddyßall to The Farm.
Accepting mediocrity is one thing,
but accepting humility is quite anoth
er.
I think most would agree that if
Willingham stayed after the 2001 sea
son, there's no way Stanford finishes
6-16 over the next two years. That
said, nobody in his or her right mind
should have expected Teevens to
come to Stanford and immediately
lead the Cardinal back to the Rose
Bowl.
He didn't, of course, going 2-9 last
season. Still, there was little talk of re
placing Teevens after just one year.
After he helped ink a talented recruiting
class, things were looking up for Stan
ford football, as the team started this
season 2-0 and played Washington

tough on the road. The rest is all too re
cent history.
Now I can buy the idea that a new
coach needs a year or two even
more to recruit and develop his
own young players and implement
new offensive and defensive play
books. That's all well and good, but it
doesn't excuse your team putting
forth its worst performance of the sea
son in the final game of the year
against a mediocre-at-best Notre
Dame team coached by the man who
put Stanford in this mess to begin
with.
How sad was Saturday's game?
I was there along with about 30
members of my very extended family,
nearly all of which were probably
wishing they weren't related to me in
any way by the end of the first half,
and therefore would have never at
tended the post-family reunion foot
ball game in the first place.
The ceremony honoring Stan
ford's seniors and two dogs chasing
Frisbees at halftime were the high
lights of the game if you were a Stan
ford fan, assuming I didn't miss any
thing after reluctantly leaving with the
Cardinal trailing 41-7 early in the third
quarter. I didn't? Phew.
Perhaps my grandfather put it best,
when he yelled to me over the cheers
of Notre Dame fans following yet an
other Fighting Irish touchdown,
"They should've never hired a guy
named Buddy."
While the past two seasons have
been disappointing for all the fans and
alumni who have supported Stanford

football throughout the years, I feel
most for the players who busted their
tails day in and day out in practice, es
pecially the seniors.
I'll miss rooting for guys like Luke
Powell and Chris Lewis on Saturdays
next year. Powell was what Troy
Walters was to the class before mine,
a playmaker capable of making
something happen every time he
touched the ball. While many will re
member Lewis for his tumultuous ju
nior and senior seasons, I'll also re
member the day his picture was on
the front page of ESPN.com after he
led the Cardinal to a pair of thrilling
upsets over Oregon and UCLA two
seasons ago.
I even feel for Teevens, who,
from all I've heard, is a bright,
friendly, hard-working man. For
whatever reason, though, things just
haven't seemed to work out for him
here. Coaches tend to get too much
credit for when things go well and
take a disproportionate amount of
the blame for when they don't, but
things went so badly wrong for Stan
ford at the end of this season that
any serious progress next year en
tails a coaching change. Re-assign
Teevens to a recruiting position, or
let him try to find a fresh start some
where else. There's an opening at
Nebraska.

Scott Allen is a junior still yet to de
clare his major in psychology. If
Buddy's back, Scott hopes he makes
him eat his words. Send him your
thoughts atssallen@stanford.edu.

when he yelled to me over the cheers
of Notre Dame fans following yet an
other Fighting Irish touchdown,
"They should've never hired a guy
named Buddy."
While the past two seasons have
been disappointing for all the fans and
alumni who have supported Stanford

football throughout the years, I feel
most for the players who busted their
tails day in and day out in practice, es
pecially the seniors.
I'll miss rooting for guys like Luke
Powell and Chris Lewis on Saturdays
next year. Powell was what Troy
Walters was to the class before mine,
a playmaker capable of making
something happen every time he
touched the ball. While many will re
member Lewis for his tumultuous ju
nior and senior seasons, I'll also re
member the day his picture was on
the front page of ESPN.com after he
led the Cardinal to a pair of thrilling
upsets over Oregon and UCLA two
seasons ago.
I even feel for Teevens, who,
from all I've heard, is a bright,
friendly, hard-working man. For
whatever reason, though, things just
haven't seemed to work out for him
here. Coaches tend to get too much
credit for when things go well and
take a disproportionate amount of
the blame for when they don't, but
things went so badly wrong for Stan
ford at the end of this season that
any serious progress next year en
tails a coaching change. Re-assign
Teevens to a recruiting position, or
let him try to find a fresh start some
where else. There's an opening at
Nebraska.

Scott Allen is a junior still yet to de
clare his major in psychology. If
Buddy's back, Scott hopes he makes
him eat his words. Send him your

"j- ebraska head coach
|\ I Frank Solich was fired Sat-

\l urday night. On the
JL N surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surpris
ing, given 'tis the season for
college football coaches to get
the axe (or keep it if you're
Jeff Tedford). But when you
consider the fact that hours
earlier his Huskers defeated
rival Colorado to complete a
9-3 season, and that Solich
won more than 75 percent of

his games during his six-year stint in
Lincoln, it's a wonder he wasn't given
a raise.
Stanford head coach Buddy
Teevens paced the sidelines of a half
empty Stanford Stadium Saturday

night. On the surface, this news
shouldn't appear too surprising, given

his team was playing a foot
ball game at the time. But
when you consider the fact
that the Cardinal was in the
midst of a humiliating 57-7
loss to Notre Dame, the worst
home loss in Stanford football
history, it's a wonder he didn't
stop pacing and resign on the
spot.
Sure, given the entirely dif
ferent circumstances sur-

rounding both coaches, it's unfair to
compare Solich's situation to
Teevens'. Yes, Nebraskans are as ob
sessive about football as they are


Scott Allen
about corn and Teevens faces the
challenge of recruiting talented foot
ball players who also possess the aca
demic track record to be admitted to
Stanford. Therefore, expecting the
Cardinal to consistently compete on
the same level as Oklahoma, Nebras
ka and even USC, is expecting too
much.
But coming off consecutive 2-9 and
4-7 seasons, including three especially
bad losses to Oregon, Oregon State
and Notre Dame not to mention a
second straight loss to Cal this
year, it's time to re-evaluate the deci
sion to bring Buddyßall to The Farm.
Accepting mediocrity is one thing,
but accepting humility is quite anoth
er.
I think most would agree that if
Willingham stayed after the 2001 sea
son, there's no way Stanford finishes
6-16 over the next two years. That
said, nobody in his or her right mind
should have expected Teevens to
come to Stanford and immediately
lead the Cardinal back to the Rose
Bowl.
He didn't, of course, going 2-9 last
season. Still, there was little talk of re
placing Teevens after just one year.
After he helped ink a talented recruiting
class, things were looking up for Stan
ford football, as the team started this
season 2-0 and played Washington

tough on the road. The rest is all too re
cent history.
Now I can buy the idea that a new
coach needs a year or two even
more to recruit and develop his
own young players and implement
new offensive and defensive play
books. That's all well and good, but it
doesn't excuse your team putting
forth its worst performance of the sea
son in the final game of the year
against a mediocre-at-best Notre
Dame team coached by the man who
put Stanford in this mess to begin
with.
How sad was Saturday's game?
I was there along with about 30
members of my very extended family,
nearly all of which were probably
wishing they weren't related to me in
any way by the end of the first half,
and therefore would have never at
tended the post-family reunion foot
ball game in the first place.
The ceremony honoring Stan
ford's seniors and two dogs chasing
Frisbees at halftime were the high
lights of the game if you were a Stan
ford fan, assuming I didn't miss any
thing after reluctantly leaving with the
Cardinal trailing 41-7 early in the third
quarter. I didn't? Phew.
