# Basketball readies for top-ranked KU
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So far, the Stanford men's basketball team (3-0)
has beaten Sacramento State, UC-Irvine and Rice.
Things get a bit more difficult this weekend.
On Saturday, the No. 21 Cardinal faces the na
tion's top-ranked team, Kansas, in the John Wood
en Classic in Anaheim, Calif. The Jayhawks (5-0)
jumped to No. 1 in both the AP and the coaches'
poll after defeating then-No. 3 Michigan State 81-
74.
Stanford will also play seven other games over
the holiday break, including a showdown with No.
17 Gonzaga on Dec. 20 in Oakland.
And until the conference schedule begins in Jan
uary, the Cardinal will be without preseason Ail-
American candidate Josh Childress, who is nursing
a stress reaction in his left foot.
Sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez, the
reigning Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week,
said he thinks the team will be up to the challenge.
"That's what you come to a school like this for
to play big-time teams," Hernandez said. "It's a
good learning experience whether we win or lose. I
think there'll be an extra excitement [in preparing
for the Kansas game] because we got our butts
kicked by them my freshman year."
The squad Kansas (3-0) brings to Anaheim this
year appears to have as much potential as the one
that cruised past Stanford 86-63 in the NCAA
Tournament two years ago. Big man Wayne Simien
and guard Keith Langford are preseason Ail-
American candidates, and point guard Aaron
Miles and forward Jeff Graves also started on last

year's Final Four team. A testament to the team's
talent is that Graves comes off the bench this year,
while former McDonald's High School All-Ameri
cans David Padgett and J.R. Giddens start.
Simien manhandled Michigan State for 28
points, but Langford stepped into the spotlight with
24 points in Monday's 85-66 win over Texas Chris
tian. Both are averaging more than 18 points per
game this year.
Stanford junior center Rob Little said he is look
ing forward to the match-up.
"Wayne and I have played against each other
since we were kids," he said. "It will be interesting
to see some familiar faces."
Simien, however, is not the only face familiar to
Little on Kansas' roster. Padgett made multiple vis
its to Stanford's campus while he was in high
school.
In Childress's absence, it has been Hernandez
who has led the Stanford offense, catching oppo
nents by surprise. Hernandez's reputation as a
pass-first point guard led UC-Irvine to leave him
open in favor of defending the Cardinal's inside
threats, Little and senior forward Justin Davis.
Hernandez responded by sinking 6-of-7 shots from
three-point range.
Rice held Hernandez to two points in the first
half and jumped to an 11-point lead, but the scrap
py sophomore busted loose for 15 in the second half
as the Cardinal rallied for a 60-56 win in Houston.
Little contributed 17 points on 7-of-ll shooting,
and Hernandez sealed the victory by making four
free throws in the final 20 seconds.

Freshman forward Fred Washington and the No. 17 men's basketball
team dodged a bullet when it came back from a first-half deficit to defeat
Rice last weekend.
"One of the main questions
about our team coming into the
season was the point guard play,"
Hernandez admitted. "Defenses
have been playing off me, and I
have to show them I can play."
After he scored a combined 39
points on 12-of-15 shooting and
racked up nine assists with just two
turnovers in the two games against
UCI and Rice, Hernandez's skills
are no longer a secret to anyone.
He predicts that his points will go
down but his assists will go up as
opponents learn that they can't
leave him wide open and as his
teammates rediscover their shoot
ing touch.
Senior guard Matt Lottich, ex
pected to be the Cardinal's top
sharpshooter, has been ineffective
so far this season, shooting just 35
percent from the floor and 19 per
cent from three-point range. But in
the past he has demonstrated his
ability to lead the team offensively,
as he did last year when Stanford
beat top-ranked Arizona in Tuc
son.
Little has been a steady pres
ence in the middle, averaging 12
points and six rebounds per game
this year.
Of the other games coming up
over break, Little said he is particu
larly looking forward to playing
Gonzaga.
"I feel like there has been a lot of
hype about them this season, and I
felt we deserved some of that re
spect since we beat them last year,"
he said.
The Cardinal is still ranked be
hind Gonzaga in the AP poll de
spite the fact that the Zags have al
ready lost a game.
Other games coming up in the
non-conference portion of the sched
ule include UNLV on Dec. 13, Florida
International on Dec. 15, Southern
Utah on Dec. 22 and Harvard on Dec.
28, all at Maples Pavilion. Childress is
expected to return when the Cardinal
opens Pacific 10 Conference play on
Jan. 2 and Jan. 4 against Washington
State and Washington, respectively.
For now, the task of beating the
country's top team looms large.
"We've done it before," Little
said. "It will be a good test."

Senior forward Justin Davis goes for a layup earlier this season. Davis is no stranger to big games but will have to step up his
game against No. 1 Kansas on Saturday as he tries to fill the shoes of the injured Josh Childress who is suffering from a stress
reaction in his foot.
