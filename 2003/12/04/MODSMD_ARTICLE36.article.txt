# Basketball readies for top-ranked KU
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So far, the Stanford men's basketball team (3-0)
has beaten Sacramento State, UC-Irvine and Rice.
Things get a bit more difficult this weekend.
On Saturday, the No. 21 Cardinal faces the na
tion's top-ranked team, Kansas, in the John Wood
en Classic in Anaheim, Calif. The Jayhawks (5-0)
jumped to No. 1 in both the AP and the coaches'
poll after defeating then-No. 3 Michigan State 81-
74.
Stanford will also play seven other games over
the holiday break, including a showdown with No.
17 Gonzaga on Dec. 20 in Oakland.
And until the conference schedule begins in Jan
uary, the Cardinal will be without preseason Ail-
American candidate Josh Childress, who is nursing
a stress reaction in his left foot.
Sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez, the
reigning Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week,
said he thinks the team will be up to the challenge.
"That's what you come to a school like this for
to play big-time teams," Hernandez said. "It's a
good learning experience whether we win or lose. I
think there'll be an extra excitement [in preparing
for the Kansas game] because we got our butts
kicked by them my freshman year."
The squad Kansas (3-0) brings to Anaheim this
year appears to have as much potential as the one
that cruised past Stanford 86-63 in the NCAA
Tournament two years ago. Big man Wayne Simien
and guard Keith Langford are preseason Ail-
American candidates, and point guard Aaron
Miles and forward Jeff Graves also started on last

year's Final Four team. A testament to the team's
talent is that Graves comes off the bench this year,
while former McDonald's High School All-Ameri
cans David Padgett and J.R. Giddens start.
Simien manhandled Michigan State for 28
points, but Langford stepped into the spotlight with
24 points in Monday's 85-66 win over Texas Chris
tian. Both are averaging more than 18 points per
game this year.
Stanford junior center Rob Little said he is look
ing forward to the match-up.
"Wayne and I have played against each other
since we were kids," he said. "It will be interesting
to see some familiar faces."
Simien, however, is not the only face familiar to
Little on Kansas' roster. Padgett made multiple vis
its to Stanford's campus while he was in high
school.
In Childress's absence, it has been Hernandez
who has led the Stanford offense, catching oppo
nents by surprise. Hernandez's reputation as a
pass-first point guard led UC-Irvine to leave him
open in favor of defending the Cardinal's inside
threats, Little and senior forward Justin Davis.
Hernandez responded by sinking 6-of-7 shots from
three-point range.
Rice held Hernandez to two points in the first
half and jumped to an 11-point lead, but the scrap
py sophomore busted loose for 15 in the second half
as the Cardinal rallied for a 60-56 win in Houston.
Little contributed 17 points on 7-of-ll shooting,
and Hernandez sealed the victory by making four
free throws in the final 20 seconds.

Freshman forward Fred Washington and the No. 17 men's basketball
team dodged a bullet when it came back from a first-half deficit to defeat
Rice last weekend.
