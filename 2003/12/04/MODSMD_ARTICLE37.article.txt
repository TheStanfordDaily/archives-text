# Water polo earns at-large berth to NCAAs
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team once
again failed to best top-ranked Southern California in
the battle for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championship, as it fell 8-6 to the Trojans last Sunday.
No. 4 UCLA took third place for the tournament over
No. 3 California. Despite its loss to Southern Califor
nia, Stanford was offered the at-large bid to the NCAA
Finals, hosted this weekend at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter.
According to sophomore driver Peter Varallas, the
Cardinal accomplished what it needed to giving a
strong showing in the MPSF in order to lock in a spot in
next weekend's finals.
"We had one goal for the tournament, and that was
to qualify for NCAA's," Varallas said.
"That was pretty much our only objective and we did

it," junior two-meter Greg Crum said. "You never want
to lose the MPSF championship game, but that wasn't
our main goal."
USC's defense held Stanford at bay, particularly
during the second half of the match, when the Cardinal
only tallied two goals. The Trojans methodically scored
two goals each period, including two goals each by
USC's James Shin, Trevor Clark and Juraj Zatovic.
It seemed like the calls were also against Stanford
for the championship match.
"We got in some foul trouble early," Varallas said.
"And at the same time weren't able to draw the ejec
tions that we ordinarily get."
Stanford came out strong in its first game of the
MPSF Tournament with a 9-5 victory over No. 6 UC-
Irvine. Senior driver Tony Azevedo scored three con
secutive goals with a total of four for the match. Sopho
more goalkeeper Chad Taylor notched a career-high 16
saves, and the Anteaters were scoreless for the first and

fourth periods.
The Cardinal faced a tougher opponent in UCLA on
its quest for the championship-game berth, falling be
hind 6-5 at halftime. But Stanford scored three consec
utive goals starting with 1:41 left in the third quarter to
gain its first lead of game. The Bruins fell 9-7 to the
Cardinal, which was led by Azevedo (three goals). Ju
niors Greg Crum and junior Matt Moser saw two goals
each in the semifinal game.
In the end, however, the Cardinal was unable to
power past the top-seeded Trojans strong defense,
scoring only six points and none at all in the third peri
od of the championship match.
"USC has a very strong defense, but I feel that we
got enough opportunities," Crum said. "We just
weren't putting our shots away."
Azevedo scored three goals for the match and
Crum and sophomore drivers
Varellas and Thomas Hopkins each
scored for the Cardinal. Azevedo
now has 81 goals for the season.
Both Taylor and USC goalkeeper
Bozidar Damjanovic tallied six
saves for the match.
.Stanford never gained control of
the game's tempo of the game.
"We let USC dictate a little too
much of the game than we would
like," Varellas said.
The NCAA Finals are a four
game, single elimination tourna
ment. On Saturday, USC (22-3) will
play No. 11 U.S. Naval Academy
(25-6) at 6 p.m. Stanford (21-4) takes
on No. 8 Loyola Marymount Univer
sity (16-13) at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford defeated California 7-6
to win last year's NCAA Champi
onship, its 10th in 26 appearances.

Only California has more champi
onships with a total of 11.
Since the creation of the water
polo championship in 1969, no team
from outside the state of California
has ever reached the championship
final. This year looks to continue to
trend with three of the four selec
tions from California.
With another Stanford / USC
matchup likely, the Cardinal hopes
that this Sunday will not be a repeat
of last Sunday's loss to the Trojans.
Stanford has yet to beat USC this
season, though it has beaten teams
that have downed the Trojans. The
Cardinal's last defeat also came from
the Trojans in October. Sunday's
loss ended a 13 game winning streak
by Stanford.
USC and Stanford are two of the
best teams in the nation and a re
match Sunday will be the Cardinal's
last chance to prove it has what it
takes both physically and mental
ly to conquer the Trojans.
"We'll need to play great defense
and take advantage of any and all
opportunities that come our way,"
Crum said.

ment. On Saturday, USC (22-3) will
play No. 11 U.S. Naval Academy
(25-6) at 6 p.m. Stanford (21-4) takes
on No. 8 Loyola Marymount Univer
sity (16-13) at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford defeated California 7-6
to win last year's NCAA Champi
onship, its 10th in 26 appearances.

Only California has more champi
onships with a total of 11.
Since the creation of the water
polo championship in 1969, no team
from outside the state of California
has ever reached the championship
final. This year looks to continue to
trend with three of the four selec
tions from California.
With another Stanford / USC
matchup likely, the Cardinal hopes
that this Sunday will not be a repeat
of last Sunday's loss to the Trojans.
Stanford has yet to beat USC this
season, though it has beaten teams
that have downed the Trojans. The
Cardinal's last defeat also came from
the Trojans in October. Sunday's
loss ended a 13 game winning streak
by Stanford.
USC and Stanford are two of the
best teams in the nation and a re
match Sunday will be the Cardinal's
last chance to prove it has what it
takes both physically and mental
ly to conquer the Trojans.
"We'll need to play great defense
and take advantage of any and all
opportunities that come our way,"
Crum said.

but still earned an at-large berth into the NCAA Finals this weekend at Avery Aquatic Center.
