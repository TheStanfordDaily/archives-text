### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team once
again failed to best top-ranked Southern California in
the battle for the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
championship, as it fell 8-6 to the Trojans last Sunday.
No. 4 UCLA took third place for the tournament over
No. 3 California. Despite its loss to Southern Califor
nia, Stanford was offered the at-large bid to the NCAA
Finals, hosted this weekend at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter.
According to sophomore driver Peter Varallas, the
Cardinal accomplished what it needed to giving a
strong showing in the MPSF in order to lock in a spot in
next weekend's finals.
"We had one goal for the tournament, and that was
to qualify for NCAA's," Varallas said.
"That was pretty much our only objective and we did

it," junior two-meter Greg Crum said. "You never want
to lose the MPSF championship game, but that wasn't
our main goal."
USC's defense held Stanford at bay, particularly
during the second half of the match, when the Cardinal
only tallied two goals. The Trojans methodically scored
two goals each period, including two goals each by
USC's James Shin, Trevor Clark and Juraj Zatovic.
It seemed like the calls were also against Stanford
for the championship match.
"We got in some foul trouble early," Varallas said.
"And at the same time weren't able to draw the ejec
tions that we ordinarily get."
Stanford came out strong in its first game of the
MPSF Tournament with a 9-5 victory over No. 6 UC-
Irvine. Senior driver Tony Azevedo scored three con
secutive goals with a total of four for the match. Sopho
more goalkeeper Chad Taylor notched a career-high 16
saves, and the Anteaters were scoreless for the first and

fourth periods.
The Cardinal faced a tougher opponent in UCLA on
its quest for the championship-game berth, falling be
hind 6-5 at halftime. But Stanford scored three consec
utive goals starting with 1:41 left in the third quarter to
gain its first lead of game. The Bruins fell 9-7 to the
Cardinal, which was led by Azevedo (three goals). Ju
niors Greg Crum and junior Matt Moser saw two goals
each in the semifinal game.
In the end, however, the Cardinal was unable to
power past the top-seeded Trojans strong defense,
scoring only six points and none at all in the third peri
od of the championship match.
"USC has a very strong defense, but I feel that we
got enough opportunities," Crum said. "We just
weren't putting our shots away."
Azevedo scored three goals for the match and
