# Volleyball faces Sac State in first round of NCAAs
## 
### KIMBERLY ROBERTS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No team enjoys waiting to find out its NCAA Tournament
bracket especially when seeding matters as much as it did for
the Stanford women's volleyball team. After defeating Notre
Dame on Saturday to end its season on a four-match winning
streak, the Cardinal was forced to endure more than 24 hours of
uncertainty, hoping that it would not need to face Southern Cali
fornia, Florida or Hawaii in order to reach the Final Four.
On Sunday, Stanford's wish was granted. The 64-team field for the
2004 NCAA Championships was announced and the Cardinal received
the No. 5 seed in the country, in the same bracket as No. 4 Pepperdine.
While a match against Pepperdine will undoubtedly be a battle, it is the
easiest road to Dallas that Stanford could have hoped for as the other
three brackets are headed by top-ranked USC, No. 2 Hawaii and No. 3
Florida teams that Stanford has already lost to this season.
The Cardinal's No. 5 seed had nothing to do with luck, as the team
has been on a tear through the second half of its schedule, winning nine
of its last 10 matches and finishing second in the highly competitive Pa
cific 10 Conference.
However, Stanford could thank Kansas State, the No. 6 seed, for los
ing to Texas on Saturday night. Speculation has it that the Wildcats loss
moved Stanford to the No. 5 spot, preventing the Cardinal from need
ing to travel to the Florida Regional.
Additionally, with its 23-6 record overall, the Cardinal earned the
right to play its first two tournament matches on The Farm. Stanford's
first-round matchup will be against Sacramento State tonight at 7:30
p.m., while San Francisco will face Pacific in the other first-round match
at Maples Pavilion. The winners of the two matches will face each other
tomorrow night at 7 p.m.
"It's wonderful to open the postseason here at home," said Stanford
head coach John Dunning. "Not only have we only lost three matches
here in the last three years, but we're going to be more comfortable on
our home court than the visiting team."
"We're very excited and we've played really well and all we can
hope for is the best," added freshman middle blocker Michelle Mel
lard on Saturday before the brackets were announced. "The ideal
spot would be Nebraska so we don't have to play Florida, Hawaii or
USC, but our main goal is to get to the Final Four and that's the best
way to get there."
Not only does the Cardinal not have to go through USC, Florida or
Hawaii to get to the Final Four, but it also doesn't have to go to Ne
braska first. Should the Cardinal advance and the remainder of brack
et play go according to seedings, the Cardinal will play its next match in

Long Beach against No. 12 Washington to reach the round of eight and
then face No. 4 Pepperdine for a trip to the Final Four in Dallas. A third
round match with Santa Clara and a fourth-round match with Min
nesota or UCSB are also possibilities.
"The bracket is tough on all sides this year, to the point where I don't
think anyone has an easy route to Dallas," Dunning said. " Hopefully,
we're lucky enough to survive, but this year has been marked by a big
number of upsets at key times, so you never know."
With the NCAA Tournament on the horizon, the Cardinal ended
its regular season on a high note, as it defeated Notre Dame 3-0 at home
on Saturday. Notre Dame was coming to The Farm having already se
cured its fifth consecutive 20-win season, but could not improve its
record as the Cardinal proved too tough on Senior Day.
At the end of the season, Stanford will be saying goodbye to middle
blockers Jennifer Harvey and Sara McGee, defensive specialist Jamie
Brownell, setter Anna Robinson and Sara Dukes, who normally plays
on the right side, but has been filling in for an injured McGee in the mid
dle.
"It's been incredible to play with these [seniors] and I'm really look
ing forward to these next couple of weeks," said Mellard, who will be
one of the freshmen that Dunning will turn to next year to fill the mid
dle blocker position. "Entering the season [the freshmen] knew our
role and we've been working hard and right now we're excited to be
here and to be learning."
The match was certainly not a blowout as game scores were 30-28,
30-24 and 30-24. There were 26 tied scores and 12 lead changes in the
three games. While the Cardinal outhit the Fighting Irish 61-43, it only
outdug the Irish by six and had more hitting errors and service errors
than Notre Dame.
"Winning in three games shows that we've come a long way since the
beginning of the season," Dunning said. "Earlier in the year, we would
have to go 4 or 5 games to put teams like that away. This time, we just
trained through the week and came out ready to play."
As she has done consistently throughout the season, junior outside
hitter Ogonna Nnamani led the Cardinal with a match high 23 kills and
only five errors for a .409 hitting percentage. Also in double digits for
the Cardinal was freshman Kristin Richards who notched 16 kills and
led the team with 14 digs.
Nnamani and Richards will lead Stanford in the first round of
NCAA playoffs tonight at Maples Pavilion.
"The keys to making a run this year in the playoffs will be health and
experience," Dunning said. "We've got to practice wisely and look to
those people who have that special something when it counts. I don't
think any one person will need to step up, but rather the whole bunch
will have to be big."
