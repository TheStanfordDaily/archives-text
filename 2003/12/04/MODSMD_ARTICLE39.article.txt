# No. 6 Card barks off Lady Bulldogs squad
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
If there's a women's equivalent to the San Antonio
Spurs' former Twin Tower duo of David Robinson and
Tim Duncan, the No. 6 Stanford women's basketball
team (5-0), which is playing with a shortage of post play
ers due to injury, faced it on Sunday, and came away with
an impressive 61-59 win over No. 10 Georgia (3-1).
"This is a huge win for our program," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "Georgia is a great team
and this shows a lot of heart in our team. You can see
how good they are. It's tough to play against that kind of
athleticism this early in the year."
The Lady Bulldogs boast a frontline that Georgia
head coach Andy Landers has dubbed "once-in-a-life
time" and VanDerveer called "the best 1-2 front court
combination in the country" with 6-foot-5 Christi
Thomas and 6-foot-6 Kara Braxton.
The towering tandem posed nightmarish matchups
on both ends of the floor for the Cardinal. Stanford's
post could neither score nor defend effectively down
low, allowing Georgia to come away with a 36-8 point
advantage in the paint.
While the Cardinal had trouble banging the ball
down low with Braxton and Thomas in the way, it got
help from the outside shooting of junior guards Susan
Borchardt and Kelley Suminski.
It was Borchardt who got the hot hand first, scoring
nine of the Cardinal's first 14 points after sinking three
shots from beyond the arc and giving Stanford a four
point lead.
Suminski picked up the pace as the first half came to
a close, nailing a three with 19 seconds on the clock
and giving the Cardinal an eight-point advantage.
Georgia guard Janese Hardrick, however, was able to
trim the lead to six as she converted a layup at the
buzzer.
With the opening of the second half, Sumiski's clutch
long-range shooting continued. She gave the Cardinal its
largest lead of the night with her second make from
downtown.

While the Cardinal was able to keep the Lady Bull
dogs at bay, holding an eight or nine point lead through
out most of the second half, Georgia was clearly never
out of the game and they wouldn't go away without a
fight.
"Against a team like Georgia, an eight- or nine-point
lead is nothing," said Stanford All-American forward
Nicole Powell, who had game-highs in points (21) and
rebounds (12), her third double-double of the season.
"We knew we would have to play hard and smart, but we
made too many turnovers at the end."
In a five-minute span, the Lady Bulldogs forced five
Cardinal turnovers and chipped what had been a 12-
point lead down to just five with 5:31 to go.
Stanford fought back and looked to have the game in
hand as Powell extended the lead to eight after knocking
down two free throws with just 1:44 to go.
Georgia, however, had one furious run left cour
tesy of even more Stanford turnovers.
The Lady Bulldogs employed a full court press that
gave the Cardinal fits. Stanford was first unable to even
get the ball inbounds and was forced to burn two time
outs.
On its third attempt to get the ball inbounds, the
quickness of Georgia's guards came into play. Suminski
threw a long pass that Hardrick was able to track down
before Borchardt, the intended Cardinal receiver.
Georgia converted the steal into two points, cutting
the Stanford lead to four 59-55 and on the follow
ing inbounds, Sebnem Kimyacioglu was called for an of
fensive foul with 54 seconds left, giving the ball back to
the Lady Bulldogs yet again.
Georgia again took advantage of the Cardinal
turnover, reducing the lead to just two on a Braxton
fadeaway jumper with 25 seconds to go.
Stanford was finally able to get the ball inbounds, but
Powell turned it over just past half court, leading to a
Lady Bulldog breakaway. This time, however Cardinal
transition defense came through Sherill Baker
