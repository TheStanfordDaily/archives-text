# No. 6 Card barks off Lady Bulldogs squad
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
If there's a women's equivalent to the San Antonio
Spurs' former Twin Tower duo of David Robinson and
Tim Duncan, the No. 6 Stanford women's basketball
team (5-0), which is playing with a shortage of post play
ers due to injury, faced it on Sunday, and came away with
an impressive 61-59 win over No. 10 Georgia (3-1).
"This is a huge win for our program," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "Georgia is a great team
and this shows a lot of heart in our team. You can see
how good they are. It's tough to play against that kind of
athleticism this early in the year."
The Lady Bulldogs boast a frontline that Georgia
head coach Andy Landers has dubbed "once-in-a-life
time" and VanDerveer called "the best 1-2 front court
combination in the country" with 6-foot-5 Christi
Thomas and 6-foot-6 Kara Braxton.
The towering tandem posed nightmarish matchups
on both ends of the floor for the Cardinal. Stanford's
post could neither score nor defend effectively down
low, allowing Georgia to come away with a 36-8 point
advantage in the paint.
While the Cardinal had trouble banging the ball
down low with Braxton and Thomas in the way, it got
help from the outside shooting of junior guards Susan
Borchardt and Kelley Suminski.
It was Borchardt who got the hot hand first, scoring
nine of the Cardinal's first 14 points after sinking three
shots from beyond the arc and giving Stanford a four
point lead.
Suminski picked up the pace as the first half came to
a close, nailing a three with 19 seconds on the clock
and giving the Cardinal an eight-point advantage.
Georgia guard Janese Hardrick, however, was able to
trim the lead to six as she converted a layup at the
buzzer.
With the opening of the second half, Sumiski's clutch
long-range shooting continued. She gave the Cardinal its
largest lead of the night with her second make from
downtown.

While the Cardinal was able to keep the Lady Bull
dogs at bay, holding an eight or nine point lead through
out most of the second half, Georgia was clearly never
out of the game and they wouldn't go away without a
fight.
"Against a team like Georgia, an eight- or nine-point
lead is nothing," said Stanford All-American forward
Nicole Powell, who had game-highs in points (21) and
rebounds (12), her third double-double of the season.
"We knew we would have to play hard and smart, but we
made too many turnovers at the end."
In a five-minute span, the Lady Bulldogs forced five
Cardinal turnovers and chipped what had been a 12-
point lead down to just five with 5:31 to go.
Stanford fought back and looked to have the game in
hand as Powell extended the lead to eight after knocking
down two free throws with just 1:44 to go.
Georgia, however, had one furious run left cour
tesy of even more Stanford turnovers.
The Lady Bulldogs employed a full court press that
gave the Cardinal fits. Stanford was first unable to even
get the ball inbounds and was forced to burn two time
outs.
On its third attempt to get the ball inbounds, the
quickness of Georgia's guards came into play. Suminski
threw a long pass that Hardrick was able to track down
before Borchardt, the intended Cardinal receiver.
Georgia converted the steal into two points, cutting
the Stanford lead to four 59-55 and on the follow
ing inbounds, Sebnem Kimyacioglu was called for an of
fensive foul with 54 seconds left, giving the ball back to
the Lady Bulldogs yet again.
Georgia again took advantage of the Cardinal
turnover, reducing the lead to just two on a Braxton
fadeaway jumper with 25 seconds to go.
Stanford was finally able to get the ball inbounds, but
Powell turned it over just past half court, leading to a
Lady Bulldog breakaway. This time, however Cardinal
transition defense came through Sherill Baker

missed a short-range jumper and
Braxton was called for an over-the
back foul with nine seconds remain
ing.

Stanford center Chelsea Trotter
came through in the one-and-one
situation, hitting both free throws
and icing the victory for Stanford.
"Our defense won the game for
us," said VanDerveer. "And our
free throws won the game for us."
The Cardinal held the Lady Bull
dogs to 43 percent shooting, after
Georgia had been shooting 51 per
cent for the season. Stanford was
perfect from the line, going 11-for
-11, including Trotter's two pressure

conversions to close out the game.
In other weekend action, the Car
dinal overpowered Boston (0-3) 67-
51, in a match that featured former
Stanford backup Becky Bonner.
Bonner had an impressive return
to Maples Pavilion, scoring a game
high 19 points on 7-for-9 shooting.
"I didn't really feel like I had any
thing to prove," Bonner said. "Be
cause I was this good when I was [at
Stanford]... But it felt really good."
While BU saw outstanding out
side shooting, the Terriers had no
answer for the Cardinal's post play.
Freshman Kristen Newlin tied a
school record for blocks in a single
game, finishing with six on the day.
The Cardinal also dominated the
boards, 49-30, bolstered by Powell's
19, which was just two away from her
own school record. Powell was also
the high-scorer for Stanford, with 17.

Over the break, the Cardinal will
have arguably its toughest test of the
season a matchup against No. 3
Tennessee (2-0) on Dec. 14 at noon.
The Lady Vols are led by junior
forward Shyra Ely. Although Ely is
a steady and reliable scorer, she
doesn't pose the same threat as for
mer Tennessee stars like Kara Law
son, Gwen Jackson, Tamika Catch
ings or Chamique Holdsclaw.
Stanford also has a tough road
trip planned just before Christmas.
The Cardinal will take on Rice (1-3)
on Dec. 18 and No. 5 Texas Tech (7-
0) on Dec. 21.
The team follows up its road trip
by opening up Pacific 10 Conference
play at home against the Oregon
schools and then will travel to Wash
ington to square off against Wash
ington and Washington State just
before classes start.

perfect from the line, going 11-for
-11, including Trotter's two pressure

conversions to close out the game.
In other weekend action, the Car
dinal overpowered Boston (0-3) 67-
51, in a match that featured former
Stanford backup Becky Bonner.
Bonner had an impressive return
to Maples Pavilion, scoring a game
high 19 points on 7-for-9 shooting.
"I didn't really feel like I had any
thing to prove," Bonner said. "Be
cause I was this good when I was [at
Stanford]... But it felt really good."
While BU saw outstanding out
side shooting, the Terriers had no
answer for the Cardinal's post play.
Freshman Kristen Newlin tied a
school record for blocks in a single
game, finishing with six on the day.
The Cardinal also dominated the
boards, 49-30, bolstered by Powell's
19, which was just two away from her
own school record. Powell was also
the high-scorer for Stanford, with 17.

Over the break, the Cardinal will
have arguably its toughest test of the
season a matchup against No. 3
Tennessee (2-0) on Dec. 14 at noon.
The Lady Vols are led by junior
forward Shyra Ely. Although Ely is
a steady and reliable scorer, she
doesn't pose the same threat as for
mer Tennessee stars like Kara Law
son, Gwen Jackson, Tamika Catch
ings or Chamique Holdsclaw.
Stanford also has a tough road
trip planned just before Christmas.
The Cardinal will take on Rice (1-3)
on Dec. 18 and No. 5 Texas Tech (7-
0) on Dec. 21.
The team follows up its road trip
by opening up Pacific 10 Conference
play at home against the Oregon
schools and then will travel to Wash
ington to square off against Wash
ington and Washington State just
before classes start.
If there's a women's equivalent to the San Antonio
Spurs' former Twin Tower duo of David Robinson and
Tim Duncan, the No. 6 Stanford women's basketball
team (5-0), which is playing with a shortage of post play
ers due to injury, faced it on Sunday, and came away with
an impressive 61-59 win over No. 10 Georgia (3-1).
"This is a huge win for our program," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "Georgia is a great team
and this shows a lot of heart in our team. You can see
how good they are. It's tough to play against that kind of
athleticism this early in the year."
The Lady Bulldogs boast a frontline that Georgia
head coach Andy Landers has dubbed "once-in-a-life
time" and VanDerveer called "the best 1-2 front court
combination in the country" with 6-foot-5 Christi
Thomas and 6-foot-6 Kara Braxton.
The towering tandem posed nightmarish matchups
on both ends of the floor for the Cardinal. Stanford's
post could neither score nor defend effectively down
low, allowing Georgia to come away with a 36-8 point
advantage in the paint.
While the Cardinal had trouble banging the ball
down low with Braxton and Thomas in the way, it got
help from the outside shooting of junior guards Susan
Borchardt and Kelley Suminski.
It was Borchardt who got the hot hand first, scoring
nine of the Cardinal's first 14 points after sinking three
shots from beyond the arc and giving Stanford a four
point lead.
Suminski picked up the pace as the first half came to
a close, nailing a three with 19 seconds on the clock
and giving the Cardinal an eight-point advantage.
Georgia guard Janese Hardrick, however, was able to
trim the lead to six as she converted a layup at the
buzzer.
With the opening of the second half, Sumiski's clutch
long-range shooting continued. She gave the Cardinal its
largest lead of the night with her second make from
downtown.

While the Cardinal was able to keep the Lady Bull
dogs at bay, holding an eight or nine point lead through
out most of the second half, Georgia was clearly never
out of the game and they wouldn't go away without a
fight.
"Against a team like Georgia, an eight- or nine-point
lead is nothing," said Stanford All-American forward
Nicole Powell, who had game-highs in points (21) and
rebounds (12), her third double-double of the season.
"We knew we would have to play hard and smart, but we
made too many turnovers at the end."
In a five-minute span, the Lady Bulldogs forced five
Cardinal turnovers and chipped what had been a 12-
point lead down to just five with 5:31 to go.
Stanford fought back and looked to have the game in
hand as Powell extended the lead to eight after knocking
down two free throws with just 1:44 to go.
Georgia, however, had one furious run left cour
tesy of even more Stanford turnovers.
The Lady Bulldogs employed a full court press that
gave the Cardinal fits. Stanford was first unable to even
get the ball inbounds and was forced to burn two time
outs.
On its third attempt to get the ball inbounds, the
quickness of Georgia's guards came into play. Suminski
threw a long pass that Hardrick was able to track down
before Borchardt, the intended Cardinal receiver.
Georgia converted the steal into two points, cutting
the Stanford lead to four 59-55 and on the follow
ing inbounds, Sebnem Kimyacioglu was called for an of
fensive foul with 54 seconds left, giving the ball back to
the Lady Bulldogs yet again.
Georgia again took advantage of the Cardinal
turnover, reducing the lead to just two on a Braxton
fadeaway jumper with 25 seconds to go.
Stanford was finally able to get the ball inbounds, but
Powell turned it over just past half court, leading to a
Lady Bulldog breakaway. This time, however Cardinal
transition defense came through Sherill Baker

missed a short-range jumper and
Braxton was called for an over-the
back foul with nine seconds remain
ing.

Stanford center Chelsea Trotter
came through in the one-and-one
situation, hitting both free throws
and icing the victory for Stanford.
"Our defense won the game for
us," said VanDerveer. "And our
free throws won the game for us."
The Cardinal held the Lady Bull
dogs to 43 percent shooting, after
Georgia had been shooting 51 per
cent for the season. Stanford was
perfect from the line, going 11-for
-11, including Trotter's two pressure

conversions to close out the game.
