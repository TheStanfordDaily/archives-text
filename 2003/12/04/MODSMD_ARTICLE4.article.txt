# Study of foreign language at all-time high
## 
### EVA DEHLINGER 
Paralleling a nationwide trend, more Stan
ford students are studying foreign languages
than ever before, according to numbers re
leased by the University. This is in accordance
with a survey released this month by the Mod
ern Language Association, which shows that
the number of students in U.S. institutions of
higher education that study foreign languages
has increased by 17.9 percent in the past five
years.
Foreign-language enrollment has increased
by about 20 percent since the establishment of
the Stanford Language Center in 1996, said
Elizabeth Bernhardt, director of the Stanford
Language Center.
"Foreign-language enrollment has ab
solutely increased," she said.
Bernhardt cited the fact that the language
requirement is the largest component of the
general education requirements at Stanford.
In order to graduate, a student must take three

quarters of a four- or five-unit first-year lan
guage course or "test out" by obtaining a score
of four or five on the Advancement Placement
exam or its equivalent.
But the trend of taking foreign languages at
Stanford is not simply to satisfy requirements,
Bernhardt said.
"Stanford students have always had a good
record of continuing in languages," Bernhardt
said. "Fifty percent of any freshman class has
already met the language requirement [yet
they continue their studies]."
Explaining why he continued in Japanese,
although he could have tested out, freshman
Ben Whaley said, "Because as long as you take
a language, you're always going to get better.
There's no end to what you're going to learn.
Especially with Japanese, your reading skills
continue to improve."
The MLA survey shows the largest increase
in enrollment nationwide is in American Sign
Language, which has increased a stunning 432
percent in the past five years.

"I was really excited about taking ASL this
quarter, but because too many people signed
up, I actually couldn't get in," freshman Lia
Carpeneti said.
After ASL, Arabic and biblical Hebrew are
the most rabidly growing languages across the
country. This growth is reflected at Stanford,
now that three full years of Arabic and He
brew are offered, along with three years of
Swahili.
Nationally, Spanish is the most widely stud
ied language, making up some 53 percent of
total enrollments, followed by French and
German.
"Spanish is always the most popular [at
Stanford]," said Berhardt. "Then Asian lan
guages: Chinese, Japanese, followed by
French and Italian."
According to the MLA survey, the interest
in Asian languages versus Italian and Hebrew,
is more significant on the West Coast.
The number of students majoring or mi-

noring in a foreign language at
Stanford has not increased,
however.
"We have a philosophy,"
Bernhardt said. "Students
should be able to use language
for whatever academic field in
terests them. That's our objec
tive, not creating language ma
jors."
Even for students who don't
originally plan to continue with
language studies, the option
proves valuable.
"I tested out of the require
ment because I'm fluent in Man
darin and Taiwanese," senior
Josephine Hwang said. "But this
.quarter I took my first foreign
language course here. It was a
medical Mandarin class."
Bernhardt attributed the con
tinued interest in languages at
Stanford to students' under
standing of its importance.
"Stanford students aren't stu
pid," Bernhardt said. "They just
know that to go out in the world,
foreign languages are necessary.
I believe Stanford students just
really understand that."
