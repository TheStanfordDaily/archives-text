# Babin has long list of things to be thankful for

By now the tryptophan
should have worn off. You
should have been able to
get your ass off the couch
and finally stop watching football.
You should have been able to escape
the wrath of your relatives.
But since most of you weren't
with me last weekend, during this
glorious doorway into the holiday
season, you may have missed my
personal thoughts on Thanksgiving.
And whether or not that fact kept
you up at night, it's what I'm writing

about this week.
So grab a plate of
leftovers, if
you've still got
'em, and remi
nisce on the
Thanksgiving
that was and all
that shall be.
First of all,
I'm thankful that

the Lions won on Thanksgiving Day.
I'm not the biggest Joey Harrington
fan, nor was I one of the Barry
Sanders' worshipers. But something
about their high school uniforms, the
fact that it seems like every Thanks
giving and Christmas has a Lions
game on tap and the harsh truth that
Detroit doesn't have a lot else going
for it (don't even start with me and
the Red Wings), well, they deserve
it, that's all.
I'm thankful that when I'm old
and my grandchildren ask me about
the arms race, I'll think of the Red
Sox and the Yankees before I think
of NSC-68, "Star Wars" and mutual
ly assured destruction. I had the
good fortune to actually be in
Boston for the signing of Curt
Schilling last weekend, which ar
guably gives the Red Sox the best ro
tation in baseball. (Yeah, yeah, the
Big Three of the A's are still up
there, and may have a higher upside,
but I'll take Pedro, Schilling, and D.
Lowe over the young guns.)
The night of the signing bars were
playing "Dirty Water" like it was
going out of style, and local shops
with signboards were already
putting up "Welcome, Curt," though
the man himself was clearly still in
Arizona. Then the next day the Yan
kees go out and sign Gary Sheffield,
countering the acquisition of a great
right-handed pitcher by inking a
great right-handed batter. And both
teams are eager to augment their ar
senals again soon, with names of A-

Rod, Tom Gordon, Keith Foulke,
Andy Pettite and other All-Stars
being thrown about.
I'm thankful that I don't have to
watch another Stanford football
game this season. The 57-7 undress
ing by Tyrone's Fighting Irish was a
disaster. Thankfully the Boston
ABC affiliate carried the somewhat
less bloody Miami-Pitt contest.
I'm thankful that I believe
enough in karma to know that Ty
rone will be punished for attempting
a fake punt in the fourth quarter of
game he's winning by half-a-hun
dred points.
I'm thankful that we didn't ever,
ever, play Oklahoma. Sweet mother
of mercy, just imagine what might
have happened.
I'm thankful that our basketball
team has the (pardon my language)
balls to schedule a tough opponent
early, taking on the top-ranked
Kansas Jayhawks on Dec. 6. Yeah,
dropping a Benjamin on directional
universities is fun, but if we're going
to live up to the hype that's already
building about this squad (and some
of it, I think, might even be true)
then let's prove that we're for real
early.
I'm thankful that Carmelo An
thony, for all intents and purposes,
appears to still be exactly the savior
the Denver (Golden) Nougats were
looking for when they drafted him,
as he, Andre Miller and "Mini-Me"
Earl Boykins have led the team to a
10-6 record out of the gate.
For those of you scoring at home,
the team won 17 games last season.
Also for those of scoring at home,
Boykins is 5-foot-5, with his shoes
on. I coulda been a contenda.
And finally, I'm thankful that in
two short weeks (weeks of hell, yes,
but two weeks, nonetheless) we are
all let loose on that bonanza of
friends, skiing, partying and relax
ation that is Winter Break.
Hopefully you're thankful for at
least a few of these things, as well.
And if not, well, I think you
should be. At the very least you
should be happy that the Stanford
football team didn't have to play
Oklahoma.
