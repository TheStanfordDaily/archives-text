# Wrestling posts 2-1 record
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford wrestling head coach Steve Buddie
has good reason to be excited about the rest of
the season. After all, his squad heads into a
month-long break with a 2-1 record in dual
meets, coming off strong showings at a couple of
tournaments, and with three wrestlers having al
ready cracked double digits in the win column.
"The season has been very positive so far,"
Buddie said. "Our open tournament perfor
mances have been very encouraging, and overall,
we've got some great momentum heading into
the heart of the season in January."
You can't fault the former Stanford Ail-
American, now in his third year at the helm of the
Cardinal, for being optimistic about the coming
months. Amid expectations to build on its first
winning season in 11 years, not much went right
for the team last season, as Stanford lost six
straight duals after the break en route to a disap
pointing 3-12 final record.
"Last year was disastrous pretty much from
beginning to end," Buddie said. "We had so
many distractions outside of the wrestling room,
that we never quite got our bearings inside of it."
The team seems to have found its bearings
this season, thanks in part to a large contingent of
upperclassmen committed to building the Stan
ford wrestling program into a winner, led by ju

nior co-captains Matt Gentry and Brad Metzler.
Gentry, who was the Cardinal's lone representa
tive at the NCAA Championships in the spring,
hasn't missed a beat this season and takes an un
blemished 14-0 record into the break after win
ning all five of his matches and the 157-pound
title at last week's California Open. Gentry is
currently ranked No. 7 in the nation at 157 and
leads the Cardinal with five falls.
"I'm definitely wrestling better right now than
ever, partly because of the intensity in our prac
tice room and the great workout partners I have
who are always pushing me to be better," Gentry
said. "Our team has great energy in the wrestling
room. Our young guys are doing a great job push
ing the older guys and making them better, and
our team is only going to benefit. After last sea
son, we have nothing to lose."
Metzler, who won the 141-pound title at the
Cal Open and placed second at the Central Mis
souri Open two weeks ago, is 11-2.
As for the team's struggles last season, partic
ularly after the break, Metzler pointed to two
factors.
"We see a lot better competition after break
and many of us don't have great workout situa
tions when we are home for break," he said. "We
just need to push through it and want to win."
Gentry and Metzler's desire to win has
rubbed off on their younger teammates, includ
ing freshman Tanner Gardner. As the Cardinal's

starter at 125 pounds, Gardner has enjoyed a
strong start to his collegiate career, tallying eight
wins, including two in dual meet competition,
and advancing to the third round of the Cal
Open.
"Because of a number of reasons, Stanford
wrestling has always been a program with a
handful of solid individuals, but rarely with a
strong team from top to bottom," Buddie said.
"We finally have a room full of talented athletes
who don't buy into that. They are convinced they
can be contenders in all 10 weight classes, all the
time."
Among the wrestlers who will play a part in
ensuring the Cardinal is competitive in every
dual the rest of the season, several have gotten
off to fast starts.
John Garfinkel, one of two seniors to compete
for the Cardinal this season, has already doubled
his win total from last season, when he bumped
up from 165 to 184 pounds, and is second on the
team with 12 wins.
After redshirting last season, sophomore
Imad Kharbush is showing the form that helped
him win 16 matches as a true freshman. Khar
bush won six straight bouts at the Cal Open be
fore losing in the final at 174 pounds.

and Juston Johnson (133) have combined for six
