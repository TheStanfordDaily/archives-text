## Study finds course evaluations to be gender-biased 
### ANDREW KIRK DAILY UTAH CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) SALT LAKE CITY â€”The final project
of a University of Utah economics student raises ques
tions about the fairness of course evaluations.
Brian Newson was asked to collect and analyze data of
any kind for his Econometrics 4610 class. He chose to look
into the validity of rumors he had heard that students give
lower average ratings to female and foreign professors.
He looked at the evaluations of 156 professors in the
economics, math and computer science departments for
the Spring Semester of 2001, the most current evaluations
currently available to students.
The goal was to see if the gender, salary and country of
origin affected how students responded to the statement,
"The instructor demonstrated thorough knowledge of
the subject." He also compared those responses with how
students responded to the statement, "Overall, this was
an effective instructor."
After each statement, the student is expected to re

spond with "strongly agree, agree, somewhat agree,
somewhat disagree, disagree or strongly disagree."
According to David Dodd, former associate dean of
undergraduate studies, the questions and rating system
were developed by a committee of students and faculty
members four or five years ago. Newson counted any an
swer containing "disagree" as a negative score. Using for
mulas he learned in class, he found that the average fe
male professor in the three departments examined re
ceived a negative rating for her knowledge of their sub
ject. Also, a student's perception of the instructor's
knowledge was dependent upon the instructor's per
ceived effectiveness.
Salary amount and country of origin had no correla
tion on how the students rated demonstration of knowl
edge.
"I was shocked because of all the complaining that
goes on about foreign professors because of the language
barriers and [because] they're not being fluent in English,
that there was no bias against them in the ratings in the
evaluations," Newson said.

He said he was less surprised about female professors
getting negative ratings because he had heard that it was
common, he said.
Susan Basow of Lafayette College has published sev
eral articles on the subject, including "Student Evalua
tions of College Professors: When Gender Matters," in
the Journal of Educational Psychology and "Student Rat
ings of Professors Are Not Gender Blind" in the Associ
ation for Women in Mathematics Newsletter.
Basow argues that although on average nationally,
male and female professors receive similar ratings, the
gender of the evaluating students influences the ratings.
Male professors are unaffected by student gender, but
female professors frequently receive lower ratings from
their male students and higher ones from female students.
Female professors also appear to be evaluated accord
ing to a heavier set of expectations, Basow said.
Male professors are only expected to demonstrate
their knowledge of the subject and competence in teach
ing. Female professors, because of stereotypes male stu
dents have, are expected to be warm and nurturing as well

as knowledgeable and competent, she said.
They must do more than their male counterparts to re
ceive the same ratings.
Newson quoted this research in his report. Andrew
Gitlin, president of the faculty senate, said these issues
need to be looked into. Potential bias toward women and
faculty of color in evaluations is something that needs to
be discussed, he said.
"If there is bias, changes need to be made," he said.
But the availability of data from evaluations is an issue
unto itself.
When Newson inquired why Spring 2001 was the most
recent semester available to students, he was told it was
because of changes in how the information was
processed.
The responsibility for making the evaluations avail
able to students online is now that of the Academic Com
puting Services. In years past, the Associated Students of
the University of Utah provided the service, but since
2001 the undergraduate department has not made it avail
able to them
