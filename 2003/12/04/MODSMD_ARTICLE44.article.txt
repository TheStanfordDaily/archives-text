## Researchers close in on male birth control 
### CALEY MEALS BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis.
In an effort to further the under
standing of ecstasy-related deaths,
researchers at Ohio Northern Uni
versity recently identified a protein
that may play a role in the some
times-fatal hyperthermia that is
caused by overdoses of the drug.
Through extensive experimenta
tion, the researchers found that mice
bred without a protein called UCP-3
heat up less after they have been in
jected with doses of ecstasy that kill
normal rodents.
The mouse studies are the earli
est steps to finding a potential thera
py to help humans who develop the
irreversible complication after an ec
stasy overdose.
"When the body overheats
enough, skeletal muscle breaks
down and organs fail, leading to an
agonizing death," according to Ted
Mills, a National Heart, Lung and

Blood Institute researcher and co
author of the study.
"By isolating this protein, we
might be able to see whether, in fact,
we can block this hyperthermia from
occurring," Mills continued. "No
body's been able to do that before."
One of the many gruesome ef
fects of ecstasy-related hyperther
mia that Mills mentioned is the fact
that when body temperatures rise to
the 108 degree range â€”as they
sometimes do under the influence of
ecstasy muscle cells will begin
"popping open" sporadically.
Though there are relatively few
deaths from overheating, consider
ing the enormous amount of ecstasy
produced and used around the
world, according to Jansen, the re
port is an important step toward pin
pointing the cause of the overheat
ing, but he also suspects there are
other factors involved.
Also worrisome is the increased
risk of psychological problems as a
result of ecstasy use.

"As low serotonin has been
linked to depression and anxiety, it
has been suggested that heavy users
of ecstasy may be at [an] increased
risk of developing psychological
problems of this nature," Jansen
said.
"Euphoria", "E-Bomb", "Speed
for Lovers", "E": all of these are
names for the popular club drug ec
stasy. Officially known as a '"psy
chedelic amphetamine," ecstasy, or
MDMA, has gained popularity over
the past 20 years because of its abili
ty to produce strong feelings of com
fort, empathy, and connection to
others, according to esctasy.ws.org.
An average dose of ecstasy can run
anywhere from seven to 30 dollars,
and common routes of administra
tion are swallowing or snorting, al
though it can be smoked or injected
as well.
According to national drug rehab
facility Narcanon, the number of
persons who had ever tried ecstasy
increased from 6.5 million in 2000 to

8.1 million in 2001, and the numbers
are expected to rise steadily over the
next few years.
While the number of deaths relat
ed directly to ecstasy use is relatively
low (only a handful have been re
ported in Great Britain and the
United States), the side effects of the
drug include dehydration, heat ex
haustion, and dangerously high body
temperatures.
"Like other potent mind-alter
ing drugs, the use of ecstasy has
been associated with impaired
mental health and impaired judg
ment," said Dr. Karl Jansen, an ex
pert affiliated with the anti-drug
website ecstasy.org. "While under
the influence of the drug, users
may sometimes experience confu
sion, disorientation, anxiety, panic
attacks, depression, insomnia, de
personalization, derealisation, per
ceptual disorders and hallucina
tions, paranoia and psychotic phe
nomena. Suffice to say, it is ex
tremely dangerous."
