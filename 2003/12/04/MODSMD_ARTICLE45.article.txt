# Influenza a part of the holiday tradition

### RACHEL MYERS DAILY KENT STATER 
(U-WIRE) KENT, Ohioâ€”
Along with the spread of holiday
cheer comes the spread of communi
cable diseases, such as the flu.
"The (influenza) virus is constant
ly mutating, and different strains are
getting passed around," Scott Flem
ing, a nurse practitioner who teaches
at Kent State University, said.
The virus gets passed around so
much that, according to the Internet
Health Library, it kills about 70,000
people in North America each year,
more than AIDS and SARS com
bined. So far this year, western states
are claiming an epidemic of the virus.
But it's not always reported, and
it's easy to misdiagnose, said Kelly
Engelhart, the nursing director at the
Portage County Health Commission.
"People often mistake gastrini

tous, where you are throwing up a lot,
for the flu," Engelhart said. "Actual
ly, the flu is more of a respiratory in
fection that can mimic a cold with a
high fever."
Advertising suggests vitamin C
and herbal remedies, such as echi
nacea, will help to treat and prevent
the flu. The only real prevention, En
gelhart said, is the flu shot, which typ
ically is obtained for a fee at almost
any health care facility from Septem
ber through December.
Either way, Fleming said it's im
portant to be vaccinated every year
because the virus constantly mutates.
While the elderly and very young
are the most likely to die from in
fluenza, or "piggyback" illnesses
such as pneumonia, college students
should be aware of their health,
Fleming said. If students have the
flu, students should not attend work
or school.
