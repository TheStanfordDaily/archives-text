# John Kerry to speak on campus Monday
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry will speak about
technology policy Monday afternoon in an event organized by the Stan
ford Democrats.
Kerry will be visiting Stanford because the University is both a
leader in technology and has a strong Democratic base, according to the
Stanford Democrats.
"Kerry is coming because Stanford is one of the premier universities
in America, and is at the forefront of technological innovation," said
Dylan Mefford, president of the Stanford Democrats. "Stanford votes
between 80 percent and 90 percent Democratic, with registered De
mocrats outnumbering registered Republicans more than four to one."
However, the emphasis of Kerry's speech will not be on his political
campaign. Rather, Kerry intends to address technology policy and how
technology relates to issues of national security.
Mefford said that Kerry's appearance at Stanford could benefit
Kerry's campaign even if he is not planning on directly politicking on
Monday. He said the Stanford Democrats used this fact to convince
Kerry to visit Stanford.
"Stanford is a great potential source of bright, talented volunteers
for a presidential campaign," Mefford said. "Senator Kerry definitely
wants to create a group of energetic volunteers here at Stanford who
will work to defeat President Bush in 2004."
Sophomore Tim H. Chang said he viewed the event as a strategic
campaign maneuver, but that was to be expected as part of the political
process.
"It's impossible to say it's not a
campaign ploy everything any
politician does these days is linked to
something," Chang said. "Bush went
to Iraq over Thanksgiving as a cam
paign technique, and then Hillary
[Clinton] going right afterwards was
also just another campaign tech
nique. All politicians do is campaign
in one form of another."
While students seem generally
excited about the event, they also
said they were not aware of it.
"I think it's really cool that we
have a presidential candidate com
ing to speak at Stanford, but honest
ly, I wouldn't have known about this
if you hadn't asked me," sophomore

Sarah Carroll said. "I think things
like this need to be better publicized
so that more Stanford students can
take advantage of these incredible
opportunities. I feel like other candi
dates have been on campus as well,
and I haven't known about it until I
read about their visit in The Daily
the next day."
Chang echoed Carroll's frustra
tion at the lack of publicity but was
also more skeptical of the event.
"I didn't know he was coming ei
ther," Chang said. "But I want to
know what Kerry knows about tech
nology. Why is he speaking on tech
nology?"
Monetary assistance for the event
was provided by Stanford in Gov
ernment and the ASSU Speaker's
Bureau.
The speech will be held in Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge from noon
to 2 p.m. The event is free.
