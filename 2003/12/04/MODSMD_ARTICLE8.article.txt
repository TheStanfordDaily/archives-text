## IT'S A 'SOUL' TRAIN 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
In the supreme moment of Jack Hill's classic 1970's so-called "blaxploitation"
loco-motion picture "Foxy Brown," heroine actress Pam Grier handily plucks a
gun out of her Afro when she finds herself in a fix. Debbie Burke, a Stanford ju
nior who is likewise endowed with an Afro Maximus, is more likely to pull a pen
cil or microphone or even a script out of hers when she finds herself creating art.
After all, this editor-in-chief will need these less lethal but no less arresting
tools as she puts the finishing touches on Stanford's newest magazine, Soul Sis
tah, modeled after the nationally published glossy Essence in its approach to
black women and spirituality and all those intense issues, right? At least this is
what I'm musing while awaiting Burke's arrival at a dimly lit cafe table. The sub
dued ambiance is somewhat at odds with the music pumping out of the speakers:
"Ya got to twerk a little bit harder than dat!" bellows Lfi' Jon.
That's when I spot a woman who suspiciously resembles Burke craning her
neck to look around for someone. But this lady's as bald as a new-born Ameri
can eagle. And when we finally do meet up, she tells me that she's quit her job as
editor chieftain of the magazine she founded.
Well, well, I think, pondering my next step, while yet another fascinated ogler
rushes up to stroke Burke's newly-shorn pate. What gives? If you think this
writer is getting into some hairy territory, never fear. It's simply that if you un
derstand the hair, you'll have a better chance of getting what Soul Sistah is all
about. t
"People come up to me and ask, 'Debbie, what caused this, why?' " Burke
says, giggling as she shakes her bald head. "Now everyone treats me like I'm re
ally ... deep or something. It's like, really funky, dude. I'm trying to come up
with all these funky answers, like, 'I found myself in my dome,' " Debbie says,
rubbing the back of her head for emphasis. "I just needed a haircut, dawg!"
As two more people massage Burke's scalp, some sweatshirted guys behind
us stare with undisguised rapt attention as they sprawl in their ladderback chairs.
Debbie continues, "The excitement that is my Afro the style of the hair is to
shoot upward, like a passionate volcano. And it causes me to act, like, bam. Just
like my hairstyle, I explode."
"But now that I cut my hair, my actions are changed. I think, 'Let's be calmer,
let's be quieter.' I'm self-conscious that I could be mistaken for a boy at any
minute. But my hair is calmer now, and I have been calmer." This aura of seren
ity is what the Soul Sistah staff is trying to infuse into the magazine, slated for
publication early winter quarter. Just as Burke's "look" can cause observers to
misconstrue her identity, the new magazine's prima facie appearance could drive
away potential readers who mistake it for something it isn't a fire-and-brim
stone gazette aimed solely at black females who've "got religion."
In fact, Burke says, "This message is not about preaching. We want to reach
a multicultural audience because everyone has a spirit." In presenting issues
through the black women's view, Burke seems to be following the old chestnut,
"Write what you know." Right now, the focus is on black females because "those
are the stories that I know," Burke says.
"The goal of Soul Sistah is to expand and uplift," Burke says.
"Kind of like a bra?" I ask.
Burke writhes in her seat, her cackling drawing the attention of nearby latte
sippers. She holds it by... holding her breasts. Grabbing her chest, she shrieks,
"Expand and uplift! Expand and uplift! That is so right!"
This is gold. Solid gold.
This would jibe with Burke's claim that the magazine's real editor-in-chief is
"God," whom some would call the equal-opportunity entity. (Burke herself is
nominally recusing herself from the earthbound editor-in-chief spot until she
feels secure that she's not "just doing it to put on my resume.") In fact, Burke
claims that the magazine's name is a direct product of divine intervention. Can
she get a witness, please?
Little more than 10 minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline for submitting the Soul
Sistah constitution to the ASSU to be considered for funding, Burke realized
that her proposal lacked one important feature. "I was like, 'Crap, I don't have a
name for it'... and I prayed to God, 'Please give me a name for this magazine.'
And like a flash of lightning, he said, 'Soul Sistah.' It was, like, 4:50." Burke
pressed that button, and her submission made it in the nick of time. The Publi
cations Board now funds the magazine. "The magazine is half written by the staff
and half created by outside submissions. From the staff we have articles on iden
tity, on dancing and culture on beauty and a myriad of subjects tied in with spir
ituality. We also have interviews, features, etc."
The Soul Sistah staff is comprised of nine people, sophomore Web master
Eden Adogla, sophomore co-editor Famia Nkansa, copy editor Jessica
Williams, financial manager Chris Hartfield, sophomore chief photographer
Naima Bridges, sophomore publicist Vix Folayan, freshman assistant layout ed

itor Jo-Issa Diop, sophomore staff writer Morgan Craven and columnist Ashley
Collins. Whew. Not to name-drop, but they all deserve props for starting Soul
Sistah from scratch. Suddenly upping the hip quotient of our complacent, Peach-
Pit-decor surroundings with her snappy scholar's glasses, jaunty hat and long
coat she looks like she's just been abducted from some smoky uptown VlP
room hideout Bridges suddenly breezes in and makes a cool beeline for
Burke. Settling in at our table, Bridges summarizes her aesthetic vision. "I'm just
trying to take pictures of some beautiful people ... capturing them at different
angles, seeing how the light falls on their faces. I really like taking pictures, most
ly landscapes, because it is so calming. But now I'm liking people more and
more."
Bridges shares Burke's yen for spontaneity. "One of the best photo shoots I
had was a person running around a field, just jumping on and off things," Bridges
reminisces, a smile rendering her cut-glass cheekbones even more prominent.
As for submissions gathered from students who are not part of the Soul
Sistah team, Burke says, "We have many pieces on sexuality and spirituality
that are poems, quotes, photos and art designs ... any writing (story, poetry,
article), art or photography that bares the soul." Of course, the ever-enter
prising Miss Burke, who is brash enough in styling herself as an incipient
mogul that you admire her gumption instead of pooh-poohing her attitude as
arrogant, manages to slip in a plug: New submissions e-mailed to soulsis
tah@post.com are welcome.
Speaking of net value: "I'm hot," is the first thing Chris Hartfield, Soul Sis
tah's financial manager, says to me. He juts out one hip, touches his hand to his
chin and mugs, bringing all of his lanky frame to bear for an attempt at a GQ
pose. I shoot him my "are-you-for-real?" look. After a few more tries, ("I'm hot.

Yes, I am. I'm just telling the truth") Hartfield quits trying to prove he's money,
in old "Swingers" lingo, and settles down to talking about managing Soul Sistah's
cash flow.
Hartfield says that he does "all the account management" for Soul Sistah.
"I'm actually financial manager for the freshman class as well. I have corporate
aspirations. I want to go into corporate law. "Soul Sistah seems to bring out Hart
field's softer side; the transformation to Wall Street barbarian he-man is not yet
complete. Perhaps his interest, and his comfort as one of two guys on an estro
gen-rich staff, both stem from the feminist theory he learned for debate team.
When I ask him if his work threatens his macho side, Hartfield almost bristles.
"I don't think it's an issue of being masculine at all. [Men] are afraid to iden
tify with it because they are afraid to be seen as 'weak.' That's patently false,"
Hartfield says. His brow crinkles and his eyes narrow as his past marination in
"Parliamentary Rules" culture starts to make itself evident. "[lt's good] to have
the ability to appreciate the experience and stereotyping of other people. It's par
ticularly a problem in the African-American community. They don't support
their women."
Working on a project dedicated to another group's perspective in which
one is an outsider is key in enhancing one's own emotional development,
Hartfield avers. "You begin not only to sympathize but to empathize as well. If
you empathize with [women], you get beyond, 'Oh, that sucks for you,' to 'Oh, I
feel for you.' " Overall, Hartfield says, it's been great working with the ladies.
, "That's my sister, baby and she's a whole lotta woman!" is how an admir
er descibes Foxy Brown in that aforementioned flick. The same could be said
about the Soul Sistah staffers. And soon, they say, their spirit will be hot off the
presses.

Soul Sistah is the University's newest student publication. While the name was a last-minute epiphany, the magazine's content is the result of the hard work

claims that the magazine's name is a direct product of divine intervention. Can
she get a witness, please?
Little more than 10 minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline for submitting the Soul
Sistah constitution to the ASSU to be considered for funding, Burke realized
that her proposal lacked one important feature. "I was like, 'Crap, I don't have a
name for it'... and I prayed to God, 'Please give me a name for this magazine.'
And like a flash of lightning, he said, 'Soul Sistah.' It was, like, 4:50." Burke
pressed that button, and her submission made it in the nick of time. The Publi
cations Board now funds the magazine. "The magazine is half written by the staff
and half created by outside submissions. From the staff we have articles on iden
tity, on dancing and culture on beauty and a myriad of subjects tied in with spir
ituality. We also have interviews, features, etc."
The Soul Sistah staff is comprised of nine people, sophomore Web master
Eden Adogla, sophomore co-editor Famia Nkansa, copy editor Jessica
Williams, financial manager Chris Hartfield, sophomore chief photographer
Naima Bridges, sophomore publicist Vix Folayan, freshman assistant layout ed

itor Jo-Issa Diop, sophomore staff writer Morgan Craven and columnist Ashley
Collins. Whew. Not to name-drop, but they all deserve props for starting Soul
Sistah from scratch. Suddenly upping the hip quotient of our complacent, Peach-
Pit-decor surroundings with her snappy scholar's glasses, jaunty hat and long
coat she looks like she's just been abducted from some smoky uptown VlP
room hideout Bridges suddenly breezes in and makes a cool beeline for
Burke. Settling in at our table, Bridges summarizes her aesthetic vision. "I'm just
trying to take pictures of some beautiful people ... capturing them at different
angles, seeing how the light falls on their faces. I really like taking pictures, most
ly landscapes, because it is so calming. But now I'm liking people more and
more."
Bridges shares Burke's yen for spontaneity. "One of the best photo shoots I
had was a person running around a field, just jumping on and off things," Bridges
reminisces, a smile rendering her cut-glass cheekbones even more prominent.
As for submissions gathered from students who are not part of the Soul
Sistah team, Burke says, "We have many pieces on sexuality and spirituality
that are poems, quotes, photos and art designs ... any writing (story, poetry,
article), art or photography that bares the soul." Of course, the ever-enter
prising Miss Burke, who is brash enough in styling herself as an incipient
mogul that you admire her gumption instead of pooh-poohing her attitude as
arrogant, manages to slip in a plug: New submissions e-mailed to soulsis
tah@post.com are welcome.
Speaking of net value: "I'm hot," is the first thing Chris Hartfield, Soul Sis
tah's financial manager, says to me. He juts out one hip, touches his hand to his
chin and mugs, bringing all of his lanky frame to bear for an attempt at a GQ
pose. I shoot him my "are-you-for-real?" look. After a few more tries, ("I'm hot.

Yes, I am. I'm just telling the truth") Hartfield quits trying to prove he's money,
in old "Swingers" lingo, and settles down to talking about managing Soul Sistah's
cash flow.
Hartfield says that he does "all the account management" for Soul Sistah.
"I'm actually financial manager for the freshman class as well. I have corporate
aspirations. I want to go into corporate law. "Soul Sistah seems to bring out Hart
field's softer side; the transformation to Wall Street barbarian he-man is not yet
complete. Perhaps his interest, and his comfort as one of two guys on an estro
gen-rich staff, both stem from the feminist theory he learned for debate team.
When I ask him if his work threatens his macho side, Hartfield almost bristles.
"I don't think it's an issue of being masculine at all. [Men] are afraid to iden
tify with it because they are afraid to be seen as 'weak.' That's patently false,"
Hartfield says. His brow crinkles and his eyes narrow as his past marination in
"Parliamentary Rules" culture starts to make itself evident. "[lt's good] to have
the ability to appreciate the experience and stereotyping of other people. It's par
ticularly a problem in the African-American community. They don't support
their women."
Working on a project dedicated to another group's perspective in which
one is an outsider is key in enhancing one's own emotional development,
Hartfield avers. "You begin not only to sympathize but to empathize as well. If
you empathize with [women], you get beyond, 'Oh, that sucks for you,' to 'Oh, I
feel for you.' " Overall, Hartfield says, it's been great working with the ladies.
, "That's my sister, baby and she's a whole lotta woman!" is how an admir
er descibes Foxy Brown in that aforementioned flick. The same could be said
about the Soul Sistah staffers. And soon, they say, their spirit will be hot off the
presses.

Soul Sistah is the University's newest student publication. While the name was a last-minute epiphany, the magazine's content is the result of the hard work
of nine dedicated staff members, seven of whom are shown above.
In the supreme moment of Jack Hill's classic 1970's so-called "blaxploitation"
loco-motion picture "Foxy Brown," heroine actress Pam Grier handily plucks a
gun out of her Afro when she finds herself in a fix. Debbie Burke, a Stanford ju
nior who is likewise endowed with an Afro Maximus, is more likely to pull a pen
cil or microphone or even a script out of hers when she finds herself creating art.
After all, this editor-in-chief will need these less lethal but no less arresting
tools as she puts the finishing touches on Stanford's newest magazine, Soul Sis
tah, modeled after the nationally published glossy Essence in its approach to
black women and spirituality and all those intense issues, right? At least this is
what I'm musing while awaiting Burke's arrival at a dimly lit cafe table. The sub
dued ambiance is somewhat at odds with the music pumping out of the speakers:
"Ya got to twerk a little bit harder than dat!" bellows Lfi' Jon.
That's when I spot a woman who suspiciously resembles Burke craning her
neck to look around for someone. But this lady's as bald as a new-born Ameri
can eagle. And when we finally do meet up, she tells me that she's quit her job as
editor chieftain of the magazine she founded.
Well, well, I think, pondering my next step, while yet another fascinated ogler
rushes up to stroke Burke's newly-shorn pate. What gives? If you think this
writer is getting into some hairy territory, never fear. It's simply that if you un
derstand the hair, you'll have a better chance of getting what Soul Sistah is all
about. t
"People come up to me and ask, 'Debbie, what caused this, why?' " Burke
says, giggling as she shakes her bald head. "Now everyone treats me like I'm re
ally ... deep or something. It's like, really funky, dude. I'm trying to come up
with all these funky answers, like, 'I found myself in my dome,' " Debbie says,
rubbing the back of her head for emphasis. "I just needed a haircut, dawg!"
As two more people massage Burke's scalp, some sweatshirted guys behind
us stare with undisguised rapt attention as they sprawl in their ladderback chairs.
Debbie continues, "The excitement that is my Afro the style of the hair is to
shoot upward, like a passionate volcano. And it causes me to act, like, bam. Just
like my hairstyle, I explode."
"But now that I cut my hair, my actions are changed. I think, 'Let's be calmer,
let's be quieter.' I'm self-conscious that I could be mistaken for a boy at any
minute. But my hair is calmer now, and I have been calmer." This aura of seren
ity is what the Soul Sistah staff is trying to infuse into the magazine, slated for
publication early winter quarter. Just as Burke's "look" can cause observers to
misconstrue her identity, the new magazine's prima facie appearance could drive
away potential readers who mistake it for something it isn't a fire-and-brim
stone gazette aimed solely at black females who've "got religion."
In fact, Burke says, "This message is not about preaching. We want to reach
a multicultural audience because everyone has a spirit." In presenting issues
through the black women's view, Burke seems to be following the old chestnut,
"Write what you know." Right now, the focus is on black females because "those
are the stories that I know," Burke says.
"The goal of Soul Sistah is to expand and uplift," Burke says.
"Kind of like a bra?" I ask.
Burke writhes in her seat, her cackling drawing the attention of nearby latte
sippers. She holds it by... holding her breasts. Grabbing her chest, she shrieks,
"Expand and uplift! Expand and uplift! That is so right!"
This is gold. Solid gold.
This would jibe with Burke's claim that the magazine's real editor-in-chief is
"God," whom some would call the equal-opportunity entity. (Burke herself is
nominally recusing herself from the earthbound editor-in-chief spot until she
feels secure that she's not "just doing it to put on my resume.") In fact, Burke
claims that the magazine's name is a direct product of divine intervention. Can
she get a witness, please?

tify with it because they are afraid to be seen as 'weak.' That's patently false,"
Hartfield says. His brow crinkles and his eyes narrow as his past marination in
"Parliamentary Rules" culture starts to make itself evident. "[lt's good] to have
the ability to appreciate the experience and stereotyping of other people. It's par
ticularly a problem in the African-American community. They don't support
their women."
Working on a project dedicated to another group's perspective in which
one is an outsider is key in enhancing one's own emotional development,
Hartfield avers. "You begin not only to sympathize but to empathize as well. If
you empathize with [women], you get beyond, 'Oh, that sucks for you,' to 'Oh, I
feel for you.' " Overall, Hartfield says, it's been great working with the ladies.
, "That's my sister, baby and she's a whole lotta woman!" is how an admir
er descibes Foxy Brown in that aforementioned flick. The same could be said
about the Soul Sistah staffers. And soon, they say, their spirit will be hot off the
presses.

Soul Sistah is the University's newest student publication. While the name was a last-minute epiphany, the magazine's content is the result of the hard work
of nine dedicated staff members, seven of whom are shown above.
