# SAE's probation to end Feb. 1
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The Greek Housing Review Board has
taken the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity off
housing probation, which had been in place
since January 2002. As of Feb. 1, SAE will also
be off alcohol suspension, which prohibits any
house gatherings of more than five people with
alcohol present. These results preclude any pos
sibility of SAE losing its house, rumors of which
were circulating on campus last year.
"We are off all kinds of suspensions, and can
resume functioning as normal," said SAE's
president, senior Jared Parker. "The reason we
are off probation is simple. There is a certain
standard to which all housed fraternities are
held, and whereas we were not at that level two
years ago, we are well above it now."
The fraternity was placed on housing proba
tion two years ago because of problems in meet
ing house occupancy requirements, providing
community service and organizing Res Ed pro
grams. The probation was extended last Febru
ary, as the board found that SAE had made
"limited improvements" and "continued to
struggle."
The next GHRB hearing for SAE was sup
posed to be last May, but was postponed as a re
sult of an incident that occurred in the spring in
volving a pledge that was taken to the hospital
after he drank beyond his limit while celebrat
ing his 20th birthday. SAE then underwent the
Organizational Conduct Board hearing for this
incident, and was placed on alcohol suspension.
On Feb. 1, the fraternity will be taken off al
cohol probation, and will instead be on alcohol
probation for the next two quarters, during
which it will be allowed to host parties, but will
be subject to stricter sanctions if it violates any
party planning guidelines.
"SAE plans to continue pursuing the ven
tures that have made our chapter so successful
such as our community service projects and res
idential programming," Parker said. "But most

importantly, we recognize that there has been
an outcry by the student body to improve social
life on campus. Look for SAE to come back
strong this February with campus-wide parties
and other events that are the reason we became
members of the house in the first place."
Greek houses are subject to annual reviews
of various criteria including their financial sta
tus, occupancy, membership, community ser
vice projects, residential programming, conduct
and leadership. A house can be placed under
probation if a Greek chapter has significant
shortcomings in multiple areas.
"SAE leadership and general membership
have worked closely with University staff and
resources in order to meet the Greek housing
criteria and be taken off housing probation,"
said Joey Green well, assistant director of stu
dent activities. "I believe SAE is a far stronger
chapter today than it was before being placed on
probation."
The Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi fraternities
are still on housing probation, dating back to a
year ago. They will be facing GHRB hearings in
the next few weeks.
"We are not reporting things as well as we
need to," saicl KA president Doug Johnstone, a
senior. "We need to convey our activities and
progress to the school through its structure."
Johnstone also noted a "definite improve
ment" in KA's programming and residential
life. He was confident that KA would be taken
off housing probation.
"I would be very surprised if we are still on
probation after our hearing," said Johnstone.
"It was a real shocker when we were put on pro
bation to begin with. We were being held re
sponsible for things that happened three or four
years ago."
Johnstone also said that housing probation
hasn't hurt the fraternity socially.
"KA has a very fun-loving vibe and we've in
creased member involvement to make it a fun
place for everyone. We just have to be more
careful about certain things."
