## Berkeley MEChA has split identity 
### ANDREA HERNANDEZ DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif.
When Jorge Roman transferred
to the University of California-
Berkeley two years ago, he immedi
ately sought out Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de Aztlan or
MEChA, a national student organi
zation formed to stimulate pride in
Chicano culture and history.
He had been involved in protests
and grassroots organizing at his old
college's MEChA in Southern Cali
fornia, but was hoping UC-Berke
leyâ€” reputed for its student ac
tivism would have more to offer.
However, instead of debating
over which MEChA events to at
tend, he found himself torn between
two separate MEChA groups on
campus-Berkeley MEChA and
MEChA de UC Berkeley.
"I was bewildered," he said.
Eventually Roman chose to join
Berkeley MEChA, the nationally
recognized group of the two, be
cause it followed the national orga
nization's guiding documents.
Although both groups espouse
unity among Chicano youth, many
students like Roman are caught
choosing between the two political
ly active Chicano student groups
the legacy of a split in the original
MEChA five years ago.
Both groups work on similar is
sues campaigning on political af
fairs, and teaching ethnic studies to
high school students apd they
join for raza events.
But there has been no formal
communication between the two
camps since 1998, members of both
groups said.
That year, nine MEChA mem
bers splintered off to form Berkeley
MEChA.
Members of the new group said
outside organizations were infiltrat
ing MEChA at the expense of its
core principles.

MEChA's involvement with
OLIN, a Bay Area high school orga
nization that staged school walkouts
for school funding, raised eyebrows
among the nine members, said UC
Berkeley graduate student Roberto
Hernandez, who was co-chair at the
time.
"People who became Berkeley
MEChA were against walkouts," he
said. "[They] took it more as in en
gaging in walkouts was to say we
were anti-education."
The splinter group said the orga
nization had abandoned the three
founding documents, including the
Philosophy of MEChA which has a
specific section condemning infil
tration from outside organizations.
Today, many of those who were
in MEChA during the split have
graduated, leaving the legacy of a
division to younger students.
"Now you've got younger people
that weren't even here when the
split happened who are more zeal
ous about maintaining the split
without really having a thorough
understanding of the complexities
of the split," Hernandez said.
Berkeley MEChA members
thought the division necessary to re
claim what they believed was
MEChA's original mission, Roman
said.
However, the split has lingering
effects on both MEChAs today.
For some it creates the image of a
fractured Latino community on
campus.
"It makes it look like its OK for
the rest of the raza community to be
divided," said UC-Berkeley senior
Jorge Morales.
Ricardo Valencia, a member of
MEChA de UC Berkeley, said the
division "defies the mission of
MEChA," which is supposed to
unify the Latino community.
"It's disheartening," Valencia said.
And it can weaken a group's
clout, said senior Monica Fernan
dez, advisor of MEChA de UC

Berkeley.
"When we're trying to work in
the community both on campus and
off it discredits us because we're not
unified," Fernandez said.
But for some Berkeley MEChA
members, the split created a niche
they now find comfortable.
Internal co-chair Alma Sarinana
said she joined Berkeley MEChA
because it was one of the only polit
ically active groups on campus.
"It gives me the opportunity to
go out into the community and ad
dress many issues, issues that affect
'la raza,' " Sarinana said.
Nevertheless, both groups have
continued to work within the Latino
community, but on different paths.
Despite the separation, there
have been some efforts to make

amends.
"Several members within
MEChA de UCB have always been
willing to build unity especially with
Berkeley MEChA," Valencia said.
"Unfortunately mass dialogue
has never really taken place."
Roman said.
MEChA de UC Berkeley mem
bers have shown up unannounced
to national conventions, only to be
turned away, Roman said.
"It kind of makes my chapter
protect themselves even more," he
said.
However, Valencia still has
hope.
"It's going to take critical dia
logue among both organizations as
well as input from the outside Chi
cano-Latino community," he said.
