(U-WIRE) MISSOULA, Mont. A naked
male student made his way through three
women's bathrooms across University of Mon
tana's campus Dec. 3, causing women to scream
and authorities to scour the area.
At 11:34 p.m., a resident assistant at Turner
Hall complained to Public Safety after the man,
described as having black, shaggy hair and a
scrawny build, was seen standing nude in the
west women's bathroom on the third floor of the
building, said Capt. Jim Lemcke, assistant direc
tor of Public Safety.
One woman saw him while she was shower

ing, and others saw the man exit.
Shortly after officers arrived at the all-fe
male dorm, police received a call about a man
fleeing Craig Hall with a group of women chas
ing him.
Again, the man had bared all in one of the
women's bathrooms. This time, however, the
man peeked into one of the shower stalls where
a woman was bathing.
The naked man then stood in the bathroom as
the woman began screaming. The noise alerted
other residents in the hallway. The man threw
his clothes on, but was chased out.
"He had no shoes on at the time," Lemcke
said. "But [the women] lost him after they ran
around the Lommasson Center."

Public Safety officers, joined by Missoula,
Mont., city police and the campus custodial
staff, searched the area.
"All sorts of people were looking for this
guy," Lemcke said, "but he wasn't found."
Later, Public Safety received a third report
about the naked man popping up in a Duniway
Hall restroom earlier in the evening. The inci
dent had not yet been reported. One woman was
inside showering. When she saw the man she got
dressed and left, Lemcke said.
Police reports didn't indicate the man's in
tentions. However, he did speak to one of the
women.
"He apologized to one victim," Lemcke said,
"and told her he was paid $100" to pull the stunt.
