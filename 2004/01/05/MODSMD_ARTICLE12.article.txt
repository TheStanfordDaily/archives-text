# Sex on the rise for college students
## 
### SCOTT BERSHOF COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER,
Colo. College for the students
of the 1960s and 1970s was con
sidered a time of sexual freedom.
Young adults, suddenly with very
little supervision, had the oppor
tunity to try, or at least consider
trying, things they vaguely heard
about.
In the 80s, sex took a turn for
the worst with hysteria over
AIDS, but gradually, throughout
the 90s, sex came back with a
vengeance. The result today is
that young adults are exposed to
either overt sexual activity or ca
sual sexual innuendo almost
every time they turn on the tele
vision, listen to the latest CD,
walk by a magazine rack, or
watch a movie.
And let's not even talk about
the Internet.
With so much that seems to
have changed, is college still a
time of sexual independence and
experimentation, and if so, what
are the consequences of such ac
tivity?
"I think that people are exper
imenting with sex a bit younger
than they used to," said Elke
Goldstein, an HIV tester, coun
selor and sexual health peer edu
cator with CU's Wardenburg
Health Center. "They are away
from home for (for most) the first
time with few rules and regula
tions hanging over their heads.
They are incredibly curious and
excited to be on their own, and
they end up experimenting more
than they did in their parents
basements back home."
Others say the time frame isn't
as relevant as the individual's
own prerogative.
"I think that this is different
for different people," said Jonna
Fleming, coordinator of the sexu
al health education program at
Wardenburg. "Some people ex
periment with sex in high school,
some in college and some wait to
be sexually active until they are in
a life-long partnership. College is
probably 'seen' by our culture to
be a 'sexually liberating' time, but
I do not think all college students
fit the stereotype."
Kelly Kratus, a volunteer with
Colorado University's Campus
Caring Pregnancy Center, said
pop culture's influence on young
sexuality, if used in a creative
manner, can actually ignite a real
istic and straightforward discus
sion on the subject.

"I think that pop culture is a
huge influence on the way stu
dents think about sex, but I do
not view it as a bad thing," Kratus
said. "I think that it is the parents
job to supervise and influence
their children's thoughts on this
matter. For example, when I am
watching 'Friends' with my mom
I know from what she has said in
the past that she did not approve
of the cast sleeping with a ton of
different people, or Chandler and
Monica living together before
they were married. By my mother
letting me know what she thought
was appropriate or not, it has al
lowed me to watch sex-filled
shows and realize that though
sleeping with a ton of people is
OK for that character, it is not
OK for me."
Students nowadays may be
more aware of certain aspects of
sexuality, but people agree there
are still other aspects students are
oblivious to, mostly in relation to
the negative consequences reck
less sexual behavior can have.
Goldstein said that the dis
graceful stigma surrounding
STl's often leaves those who con
tact one with the false impression
that their sex life is completely
finished.
"I think that there is quite a bit
of stigma around those with
STl's," Goldstein said. "People
think when they are first diag
nosed that they are never going to
be able to have sex again, and
that's just not true. There are bac
terial and viral STl's, and both
are transmitted differently.
There are ways to protect one's
self against both."
Kathy Montgomery, the direc
tor of Colorado University's
Campus Caring Pregnancy Cen
ter, said some of the delusions
students may have about sex re
sults from the abundance of free
condoms all across campus, lead
ing some to think that it's all they
need to stay safe.
"It [the amount of condoms]
creates a misconception for many
students that condoms will pre
vent pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases," Mont
gomery said. "Of 30 positive
pregnancies at CPC in the first six
months of this year, nine became
pregnant using a condom."
Montgomery said reading
about such possibilities is entirely
different than actually dealing
with them.
"Statistics mean very little
when you are the statistic,"
Montgomery said.

(U-WIRE) BOULDER,
Colo. College for the students
of the 1960s and 1970s was con
sidered a time of sexual freedom.
Young adults, suddenly with very
little supervision, had the oppor
tunity to try, or at least consider
trying, things they vaguely heard
about.
In the 80s, sex took a turn for
the worst with hysteria over
AIDS, but gradually, throughout
the 90s, sex came back with a
vengeance. The result today is
that young adults are exposed to
either overt sexual activity or ca
sual sexual innuendo almost
every time they turn on the tele
vision, listen to the latest CD,
walk by a magazine rack, or
watch a movie.
And let's not even talk about
the Internet.
With so much that seems to
have changed, is college still a
time of sexual independence and
experimentation, and if so, what
are the consequences of such ac
tivity?
"I think that people are exper
imenting with sex a bit younger
than they used to," said Elke
Goldstein, an HIV tester, coun
selor and sexual health peer edu
cator with CU's Wardenburg
Health Center. "They are away
from home for (for most) the first
time with few rules and regula
tions hanging over their heads.
They are incredibly curious and
excited to be on their own, and
they end up experimenting more
than they did in their parents
basements back home."
Others say the time frame isn't
as relevant as the individual's
own prerogative.
"I think that this is different
for different people," said Jonna
Fleming, coordinator of the sexu
al health education program at
Wardenburg. "Some people ex
periment with sex in high school,
some in college and some wait to
be sexually active until they are in
a life-long partnership. College is
probably 'seen' by our culture to
be a 'sexually liberating' time, but
I do not think all college students
fit the stereotype."
Kelly Kratus, a volunteer with
Colorado University's Campus
Caring Pregnancy Center, said
pop culture's influence on young
sexuality, if used in a creative
manner, can actually ignite a real
istic and straightforward discus
sion on the subject.

"I think that pop culture is a
huge influence on the way stu
dents think about sex, but I do
not view it as a bad thing," Kratus
said. "I think that it is the parents
job to supervise and influence
their children's thoughts on this
matter. For example, when I am
watching 'Friends' with my mom
I know from what she has said in
the past that she did not approve
of the cast sleeping with a ton of
different people, or Chandler and
Monica living together before
they were married. By my mother
letting me know what she thought
was appropriate or not, it has al
lowed me to watch sex-filled
shows and realize that though
sleeping with a ton of people is
OK for that character, it is not
OK for me."
Students nowadays may be
more aware of certain aspects of
sexuality, but people agree there
are still other aspects students are
oblivious to, mostly in relation to
the negative consequences reck
less sexual behavior can have.
Goldstein said that the dis
graceful stigma surrounding
STl's often leaves those who con
tact one with the false impression
that their sex life is completely
finished.
"I think that there is quite a bit
of stigma around those with
STl's," Goldstein said. "People
think when they are first diag
nosed that they are never going to
be able to have sex again, and
that's just not true. There are bac
terial and viral STl's, and both
are transmitted differently.
There are ways to protect one's
self against both."
Kathy Montgomery, the direc
tor of Colorado University's
Campus Caring Pregnancy Cen
ter, said some of the delusions
students may have about sex re
sults from the abundance of free
condoms all across campus, lead
ing some to think that it's all they
need to stay safe.
"It [the amount of condoms]
creates a misconception for many
students that condoms will pre
vent pregnancy and sexually
transmitted diseases," Mont
gomery said. "Of 30 positive
pregnancies at CPC in the first six
months of this year, nine became
