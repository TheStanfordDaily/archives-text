## Skies friendlier than officials think 
### 
Since the U.S. government's decision to
elevate the domestic terror alert level
to "high" on Dec. 21, U.S. officials
have taken extra precautionary mea
sures to prevent potential terrorist attacks.
As a result of this renewed concern over
homeland security, a number of inbound in
ternational flights originating in Britain,
France and Mexico have been canceled due
to U.S. concerns. We believe that it is impor
tant for U.S. officials to do their best to en
sure that the nation is appropriately safe
guarded against all types of terrorist threats.
However, we worry that the frequent flight
cancellations undermine the amount of con
cern if a real threat is present, and we hope
that U.S. officials will only take such drastic
action when there is a clear and specific indi
cation of potential danger.
Alerts that warn of potential terrorist acts
can be beneficial, in that they encourage peo
ple to be more vigilant and aware of what is
going on around them. However, if these
warnings are issued too often, individuals can
become desensitized, making the alerts less
effective. The more times such alerts are is
sued and the more often that they are is
sued without any resulting terrorist activity
people will increasingly take the alerts less
seriously and each warning will elicit less
awareness on the part of the public. This is
why it is important that alerts are only issued
when absolutely necessary.
Recently, the Bush administration has im
proved its approach in this regard by adjusting
the terrorism alert levels on a less frequent
basis. Therefore, for example, when the level
was changed to "high" last month, the effect
of this change was much stronger than it might
have been if the level had been changed up
and down more often in prior months.
However, now that a number of interna
tional flights have been canceled in last sev

eral weeks, the Bush administration is again
faced with the potential risk of going too far
in its proactive efforts to stop potential at
tacks. Flight delays and cancellations are ex
tremely burdensome to air travelers. Admit
tedly, most people would prefer to be safe,
rather than sorry. Thus, it is appropriate to
order a delay or a cancellation when there is
clear and credible evidence indicating that
such a drastic measure is warranted. But
such precautionary measures have other im
plications that are also important to consid
er. Thousands of passengers must be placed
on substitute flights and airport personnel
must struggle to deal with the overflow. Can
celing or delaying flights can have serious
repercussions, as it puts stress on the airport
system as a whole when so many travelers
must be re-accommodated.
We do not disapprove of the cancellation
or delay of airline flights, when necessary.
The top priority for everyone should be to
ensure safe travel. Rather, we merely hope
that U.S. officials made their past decisions
based on an appropriate amount of evidence,
and we encourage them to continue to do so
in the future. After all, if the delays and can
cellations continue or significantly in
crease in quantity this could result in a less
favorable overall security situation in the
long run as airports struggle to deal with the
resultant overflow. And it is important to re
alize that these measures should only be a
temporary solution. The government should
aim to identify suspicious passengers or cir
cumstances regarding airline flights in a more
vigilant manner. That way, flights would not
be told to return in mid-air or be canceled
mere hours before departure. Threats should
be identified earlier so that they can be re
solved in time for the flights to continue as
scheduled, making everyone in the air and
on the ground safer.
