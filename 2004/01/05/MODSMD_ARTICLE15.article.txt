## HOLT'S HARANGUE My fling with Sen. John Kerry 
### 
It began when he rode into my life
in the passenger seat of a gray
minivan one sunny December af
ternoon. It ended with us 3,000
miles apart, him mumbling apologies.
I had a fling with John Kerry that is
to say, we never met each other and I
don't think he even said a word to me.
My "fling" was a 36-hour stint where I
thought the guy might actually be our
next president. I first met him when he
came to campus on Dec. 8, a day when
the majority of students were studying
for finals.
Now, I rarely get involved in what
is termed "politics." But I did leap at
the chance to get to meet the man who
might actually have a shot at the presi
dency. I say "actually" because, al
though I couldn't ignore the cat-call
ing heckling of the Kucinich support
ers, the odds of Kucinich getting elect
ed are about the same as Carrot Top.
So, I thought it would be cool to see
what Kerry was all about.
He came to talk about technology,
but the only "technology" I observed
was the use of stump-speech writing
machines. As a fuzzie, I'm highly aller
gic to science talk and am capable of
slipping into a coma at the mere men
tion of the word "technology." The
fact that I stayed awake during the en
tire talk means he kept the audience
focused on his main point: "Elect me."
Despite being my cynical self, I was
impressed with the guy. When ques
tioned, he showed knowledge of the
material and was quite personable. He
told some jokes, shook some hands
and smiled a bit. I went away thinking,
"Hey, I may disagree with some of
what this guy says, but he definitely is
leadership material." I thought
maybe, just maybe, he could do this
"president thing."
These were the finer hours of our
fling, the comfortable period where I

liked him and he continued to not
know who I was.
Our fling ended dramatically. I didn't
ay, but I wish he had. It would have
probably shot him up in the polls for him

to show some kind
of emotion. On Dec.
9, the next day,
Kerry flew across
the country to New
Hampshire. At
about midnight Pa
cific Standard Time,
the New Hampshire
Primary debate was
broadcast.
What I saw
broke my political-

ly naive heart. The nice, personable
man I had met the day before now
seemed as stiff and stupid as Clinton's,
uh... ego. He did not look good on
TV. It was like Nixon getting buried by
Kennedy. Even worse, Kerry jumped
in with the rest of the jabbering mon
keys who were deriding front runner
Howard Dean. They didn't make
points so much as mock Dean's stance.
Some of them were creative Carol
Moseley Braun, I kid you not, told the
audience about her father's lawnmow
er to make a point. I don't know what
that point was, but it made me think.
Braun and Kucinich upstaged Kerry
and Lieberman, who seemed just dull
and redundant. Kerry, for a war veteran
and a man who can think on his toes,
showed a complete lack of originality
and passion. All of the candidates over
shadowed their policies with their con
stant bickering. Where was the Johnny
Kerry I so knew and so loved?
Gone. Kerry may be very qualified
for the presidency, but he will never
get the job because he didn't keep me
in love with him. All jokes aside, that's
what he has to do he has to make
the voting public fall in love with him.

Clinton had his sax, what will Kerry do
to impress us? Dunk a basketball? Get
kittens down from trees using his
freakishly huge arms? Do an uncanny
impression of Frankenstein's mon
ster? Or will he just say he disagrees
with Dean and Bush but without
any force or passion?
The Democrats have a difficult
year ahead of them. They have to
unite the American people under the
banner of one candidate, and right
now no one seems to want to unite
anybody. I thought that Joe Lieber
man's comment epitomized the prob
lem the Democrats are facing: "If
Howard Dean were president, Sad
dam Hussein would still be in power."
What he means to say is that, if
many of his fellow Democrats mil
lions of American people, even this
author were president, Saddam
Hussein would still be in power. Why?
Because people opposed the war in
Iraq people within his own party.
Senator Lieberman takes a great vic
tory for America, the capture of Sad
dam Hussein, and turns it into a very
petty, underhanded jab. Some unifier.
I'll miss him when he gets eliminated
before Super Tuesday.
As dark as things seem for the
Democrats, there is still hope. Kerry,
my old flame, could learn to be more
personable on television. Dean could
pull Southern votes out of his ass.
Clark could get the vice president
nomination. And Kucinich ok,
there's very little hope for Kucinich.
Well, let's hope there is some hope
for the Democrats. I'm tired of Bush
jokes.

wear a Hawaiian shirt at the next debate
and talk using a puppet. E-mail Chris at

tory for America, the capture of Sad
dam Hussein, and turns it into a very
petty, underhanded jab. Some unifier.
I'll miss him when he gets eliminated
before Super Tuesday.
As dark as things seem for the
Democrats, there is still hope. Kerry,
my old flame, could learn to be more
personable on television. Dean could
pull Southern votes out of his ass.
Clark could get the vice president
nomination. And Kucinich ok,
there's very little hope for Kucinich.
Well, let's hope there is some hope
for the Democrats. I'm tired of Bush
jokes.

Chris Holt thinks John Kerry should
wear a Hawaiian shirt at the next debate
and talk using a puppet. E-mail Chris at
cholt@stanford.edu with your names
for the puppet.


Chris Holt
It began when he rode into my life
in the passenger seat of a gray
minivan one sunny December af
ternoon. It ended with us 3,000
miles apart, him mumbling apologies.
I had a fling with John Kerry that is
to say, we never met each other and I
don't think he even said a word to me.
My "fling" was a 36-hour stint where I
thought the guy might actually be our
next president. I first met him when he
came to campus on Dec. 8, a day when
the majority of students were studying
for finals.
Now, I rarely get involved in what
is termed "politics." But I did leap at
the chance to get to meet the man who
might actually have a shot at the presi
dency. I say "actually" because, al
though I couldn't ignore the cat-call
ing heckling of the Kucinich support
ers, the odds of Kucinich getting elect
ed are about the same as Carrot Top.
So, I thought it would be cool to see
what Kerry was all about.
He came to talk about technology,
but the only "technology" I observed
was the use of stump-speech writing
machines. As a fuzzie, I'm highly aller
gic to science talk and am capable of
slipping into a coma at the mere men
tion of the word "technology." The
fact that I stayed awake during the en
tire talk means he kept the audience
focused on his main point: "Elect me."
Despite being my cynical self, I was
impressed with the guy. When ques
tioned, he showed knowledge of the
material and was quite personable. He
told some jokes, shook some hands
and smiled a bit. I went away thinking,
"Hey, I may disagree with some of
what this guy says, but he definitely is
leadership material." I thought
maybe, just maybe, he could do this
"president thing."
These were the finer hours of our
fling, the comfortable period where I

liked him and he continued to not
know who I was.
Our fling ended dramatically. I didn't
ay, but I wish he had. It would have
probably shot him up in the polls for him

to show some kind
of emotion. On Dec.
9, the next day,
Kerry flew across
the country to New
Hampshire. At
about midnight Pa
cific Standard Time,
the New Hampshire
Primary debate was
broadcast.
What I saw
broke my political-

ly naive heart. The nice, personable
man I had met the day before now
seemed as stiff and stupid as Clinton's,
uh... ego. He did not look good on
TV. It was like Nixon getting buried by
Kennedy. Even worse, Kerry jumped
in with the rest of the jabbering mon
keys who were deriding front runner
Howard Dean. They didn't make
points so much as mock Dean's stance.
Some of them were creative Carol
Moseley Braun, I kid you not, told the
audience about her father's lawnmow
er to make a point. I don't know what
that point was, but it made me think.
Braun and Kucinich upstaged Kerry
and Lieberman, who seemed just dull
and redundant. Kerry, for a war veteran
and a man who can think on his toes,
showed a complete lack of originality
and passion. All of the candidates over
shadowed their policies with their con
stant bickering. Where was the Johnny
Kerry I so knew and so loved?
Gone. Kerry may be very qualified
for the presidency, but he will never
get the job because he didn't keep me
in love with him. All jokes aside, that's
what he has to do he has to make
the voting public fall in love with him.

Clinton had his sax, what will Kerry do
to impress us? Dunk a basketball? Get
kittens down from trees using his
freakishly huge arms? Do an uncanny
impression of Frankenstein's mon
ster? Or will he just say he disagrees
with Dean and Bush but without
any force or passion?
The Democrats have a difficult
year ahead of them. They have to
unite the American people under the
banner of one candidate, and right
now no one seems to want to unite
anybody. I thought that Joe Lieber
man's comment epitomized the prob
lem the Democrats are facing: "If
Howard Dean were president, Sad
dam Hussein would still be in power."
What he means to say is that, if
many of his fellow Democrats mil
lions of American people, even this
author were president, Saddam
Hussein would still be in power. Why?
Because people opposed the war in
Iraq people within his own party.
Senator Lieberman takes a great vic
tory for America, the capture of Sad
dam Hussein, and turns it into a very
petty, underhanded jab. Some unifier.
