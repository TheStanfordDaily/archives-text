# OP-ED
## 20 years later, our schools are still at risk 
### JOHN E. CHUBB 
The political world was stunned by
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's public em
brace of vouchers for students in the
District of Columbia. "I have never be
fore supported a voucher program,"
the California Democrat explained in
The Washington Post. "For 30 years, I
have advocated strongly for our public
schools. But as a former mayor, I also
believe that local leaders should have
the opportunity to experiment with
programs that they believe are right for
their area."
This reversal of opinion is due to the
dismal performance of D.C. students,
and the senator's belief that these stu
dents must do better. How important is
this change of heart? Perhaps one day it
will be considered a seismic event in the
history of school reform. But without
similar conversions in high places,
many students will continue to slip
through the cracks.
Feinstein's about-face comes as we
observe the twentieth anniversary of
"A Nation at Risk," the federal study
that warned of a rising tide of medi
ocrity in our public schools. Even after
two decades of efforts to raise academ
ic standards, provide more resources,
reduce class size and hold schools ac
countable for improving student

achievement, our schools continue to
fail many children.
By the most objective measure
the federal government's National As
sessment of Educational Progress
reading and math achievement re
bounded only slightly from their low
points in the early 1980s and remain at
low levels. Meanwhile, international
comparisons such as the Third Interna
tional Mathematics and Science Study
show U.S. students stuck in the middle
or at the bottom of the pack.
Perhaps most troubling, however, is
the abysmal achievement and gradua
tion levels of many African American
and Latino students. Washington state,
which has a highly regarded monitoring
system, found that a third or more of
minority students in urban schools
scored at extremely low levels on cru
cial tests. More than 54 percent of black
urban students fell into the bottom two
deciles of white scores.
Dropout rates are no better. One
nationwide survey found that, in 1998,
white students graduated at a rate of 78
percent; the rates for blacks and Lati
nos were 56 percent and 54 percent.
Seven states graduated fewer than 50
percent of their black students, while
eight states graduated fewer than 50
percent of their Latino students.
As Feinstein has acknowledged,

many school systems cannot meet the
challenges set before them. The will is
there, but the job is simply too big. D.C.
mayor Anthony A. Williams now says
choice is the only way to reverse negative
trends for his students. He is not alone.
Forty states have authorized charter
schools in the past decade, creating
2,700 schools. Several states provide
vouchers, and many more may follow in
the wake of a 2002 Supreme Court rul
ing upholding the constitutionality of
vouchers for schools with religious affil
iations. Private companies now manage
300 public schools; all told, roughly
700,000 students receive their public ed
ucation outside the traditional system.
The nationwide reforms initiated by
A Nation at Risk cannot stem the still
rising tide of mediocrity. Choice has an
important role to play, and the sooner
we accept that fact the better off our
children will be. Ultimately this issue is
not about ideology or political correct
ness. It is about providing a new oppor
tunity for a good education, which is the
key to success.
