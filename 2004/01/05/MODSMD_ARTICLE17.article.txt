## Who's against 'adequate' school funding? 
### ERIC A. HANUSHEK 
Many states are currently locked in
court battles in which they are being
sued to provide "adequate" funding for
their schools. These adequacy suits,
which have spilled over into legislatures,
represent yet another example of a situ
ation where words and slogans do not
match reality.
For three decades, state school fund
ing has been driven by a series of court
cases concerned with fiscal equity.
These cases have a common argument:
The individual state constitutions re
quire a greater parity in spending be
tween rich and poor school districts
than is typically observed under mixed
state and local funding.
But the supporters of the lawsuits
were dismayed by the end results. In
fact, some state legislatures that were re
quired by the courts to equalize spend
ing across districts did not come up to the
highest-spending districts but instead
kept the overall level constant. The pro
ponents of these suits were unhappy be
cause their desire had been to pry more
school spending out of the states.
In reaction to this apparently unfor
tunate outcome, a new kind of lawsuit
and argument developed - the need for
adequate spending. Under this new

legal strategy, a system could be equal
ized but could still be inadequate to
provide an appropriate education. For
example, one group claimed that New
York state was not providing the con
stitutionally required adequate spend
ing to New York City, even though
New York City schools were spending
more than the average being spent in
42 states.
For the proponents of greater
school spending, adopting the word
"adequate" was a great coup, similar
to adopting the word "equity" many
years before. Surely we all want both
equitable and adequate spending.
The crucial ingredient to these argu
ments is an implicit presumption that
spending translates directly to school
quality. Unfortunately, a massive
amount of evidence indicates that
spending on schools is not closely relat
ed to school quality or student learning.
How could this be? In the simplest
terms, there are too few incentives that
reward good performance and too few
disincentives to penalize poor perfor
mance in our public schools. Schools in
troduce unproven and unproductive
programs. They overpay poor teachers
(and underpay good teachers). They
tolerate ineffective administrators at
the state, district and individual school

level. In sum, they do not ensure that
any additional funds will be spent in
ways that improve student learning.
Because funding is not related ei
ther to overall student performance or
to the performance of specific groups
minorities, disadvantaged students
or urban students it is not a good
index of equity. Nor is it possible to cal
culate how much needs to be spent to
ensure adequate student performance.
Thus, when legislatures search for
adequacy in funding or when courts de
mand it, they do not realize that it is a
search for the Holy Grail a noble
but ultimately futile effort. The propo
nents of adequacy on the other hand
know exactly what is going on. By ex
ploiting this term, they are able to press
for greater spending, knowing that
whatever is spent now will be insuffi
cient and that more will be needed to
morrow.
When asked to rally around equity
and adequacy in education, be skepti
cal because those words do not mean
what you think they do.
