## Undefeated No. 5 Cardinal continues streak 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
On Friday night, as the No. 5 Stanford men's bas
ketball team (11-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
opened up Pac-10 play with a victory over Washing
ton State, the Cardinal was, once again, forced to
play without one of its big name stars.
And no it wasn't junior All-American candidate
Josh Childress this time.
Childress suited up for his first game this season
in the 73-51 Stanford win after missing over a month
of action with a fractured left foot.
On this particular occasion, it was Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery who was forced to sit out.
On Friday, Montgomery served a one-game suspen
sion for bumping an official last season.
Assistant coach Tony Fuller filled in on the side
lines for Montgomery, while Stanford alumni waved
around cut-outs of Montgomery's face on wooden
sticks to remind everyone the players included
that he was definitely there in spirit.
"We tried to downplay [Montgomery's absence]
as much as possible. Our guys know that even
though their leader isn't there, they've been drilled
in such a manner that they know exactly what to do.
[But] I wouldn't say that I was running the show,"
said a modest Fuller after the game. "[Coach Eric
Reveno] had the offense and [Coach Russell] Turn
er had the defense. It was a team effort. All of our

guys really wanted this one."
And it showed.
While Fuller, Reveno and Turner picked up the
slack on the bench it was Childress who proved that
he's more comfortable in a Cardinal uniform than a
suit and tie. Despite playing only seven minutes in
his debut, the junior managed to score 10 points, on
4-of-5 shooting from the field.
Childress will continue to play limited minutes
until he works himself back into playing shape and
doctors are assured that his foot is completely
healed.
In the first half against Washington State, Stan
ford jumped to an early lead and never looked back,
shooting almost 60 percent from the field in the
game. Four Cardinal players scored in double-fig
ures and Stanford senior forward Justin Davis led
all Stanford scorers with 13 points. Junior center
Rob Little, senior shooting guard Matt Lottich and
Childress all added 10 points apiece.
"I could have been more effective, that's how I
have to look at it," Childress said. "But I was
pleased with the way I played. I'm not hesitant. I
may be a little bit slower, but I force myself to be ag
gressive."
The Cardinal kept its winning streak intact yes
terday afternoon against unranked Washington
with Davis once again turning in an impressive all
around performance for Stanford.
He finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds six
of which were offensive off 6-of-ll shooting from
the field.
Despite opening the game on a 10-0 run, the Car
dinal struggled in the first half to separate itself
from an athletic Husky team that was extremely
pesky on the defensive end.
Washington turned 13 Stanford turnovers into 23
points and shot 82 percent from the free-throw line.
The 10-point run began in the game's opening
seconds when Stanford forward Justin Davis forced
a Washington turnover and converted on a fast
break layup. After another Cardinal defensive stop
on the next play, Davis scored a five-foot jumper.
"The biggest part of my game is [the energy I
bring . . .] just being active,"Davis said. "[The
coaches] always stress that if I'm active everything
will just come. It's when I'm not active that I strug
gle."
The Huskies hung around through the first half,
at one point pulling within four points of the Cardi
nal on 11-of-12 shooting from the charity stripe.
Stanford, on the other hand, shot four free throws in
the first half and only converted on one of those at
tempts.
The Cardinal jogged into the locker room at the
half with a 41-34 lead.
After Washington opened the half with five
straight points, bringing the score to 41-39 in favor
of Stanford, junior utility man Nick Robinson rat
tled off four straight points to answer.
And then Davis picked up where Robinson left
off, scoring six unanswered points, extending Stan
ford's lead to 12 and bringing the crowd to its feet
with a fast break layup in traffic.
Robinson and redshirt sophomore point guard
Chris Hernandez both scored 13 points apiece in the
Cardinal victory, while Little added 12 points and
grabbed six boards.
"[Washington] gave us some anxious moments,"
Montgomery said. "They're definitely capable of
scoring in bunches."
Stanford will embark on its first Pac-10 road trip
this week, traveling south to battle Arizona State
and No. 4 Arizona in what will most likely be its
most difficult weekend of the conference season.

"We tried to downplay [Montgomery's absence]
as much as possible. Our guys know that even
though their leader isn't there, they've been drilled
in such a manner that they know exactly what to do.
[But] I wouldn't say that I was running the show,"
said a modest Fuller after the game. "[Coach Eric
Reveno] had the offense and [Coach Russell] Turn
er had the defense. It was a team effort. All of our

guys really wanted this one."
And it showed.
While Fuller, Reveno and Turner picked up the
slack on the bench it was Childress who proved that
he's more comfortable in a Cardinal uniform than a
suit and tie. Despite playing only seven minutes in
his debut, the junior managed to score 10 points, on
4-of-5 shooting from the field.
Childress will continue to play limited minutes
until he works himself back into playing shape and
doctors are assured that his foot is completely
healed.
In the first half against Washington State, Stan
ford jumped to an early lead and never looked back,
shooting almost 60 percent from the field in the
game. Four Cardinal players scored in double-fig
ures and Stanford senior forward Justin Davis led
all Stanford scorers with 13 points. Junior center
Rob Little, senior shooting guard Matt Lottich and
Childress all added 10 points apiece.
"I could have been more effective, that's how I
have to look at it," Childress said. "But I was
pleased with the way I played. I'm not hesitant. I
may be a little bit slower, but I force myself to be ag
gressive."
The Cardinal kept its winning streak intact yes
terday afternoon against unranked Washington
with Davis once again turning in an impressive all
around performance for Stanford.
He finished with 17 points and 13 rebounds six
of which were offensive off 6-of-ll shooting from
the field.
Despite opening the game on a 10-0 run, the Car
dinal struggled in the first half to separate itself
from an athletic Husky team that was extremely
pesky on the defensive end.
Washington turned 13 Stanford turnovers into 23
points and shot 82 percent from the free-throw line.
The 10-point run began in the game's opening
seconds when Stanford forward Justin Davis forced
a Washington turnover and converted on a fast
break layup. After another Cardinal defensive stop
on the next play, Davis scored a five-foot jumper.
"The biggest part of my game is [the energy I
bring . . .] just being active,"Davis said. "[The
coaches] always stress that if I'm active everything
will just come. It's when I'm not active that I strug
gle."
The Huskies hung around through the first half,
at one point pulling within four points of the Cardi
nal on 11-of-12 shooting from the charity stripe.
Stanford, on the other hand, shot four free throws in
the first half and only converted on one of those at
tempts.
The Cardinal jogged into the locker room at the
half with a 41-34 lead.
After Washington opened the half with five
straight points, bringing the score to 41-39 in favor
of Stanford, junior utility man Nick Robinson rat
tled off four straight points to answer.
And then Davis picked up where Robinson left
off, scoring six unanswered points, extending Stan
ford's lead to 12 and bringing the crowd to its feet
with a fast break layup in traffic.
Robinson and redshirt sophomore point guard
Chris Hernandez both scored 13 points apiece in the
Cardinal victory, while Little added 12 points and
grabbed six boards.
"[Washington] gave us some anxious moments,"
Montgomery said. "They're definitely capable of
scoring in bunches."
Stanford will embark on its first Pac-10 road trip
this week, traveling south to battle Arizona State
and No. 4 Arizona in what will most likely be its
most difficult weekend of the conference season.

Junior Josh Childress scored 10 points in his seven-minute season debut during the Cardinal's 73-51 win over WSU.
On Friday night, as the No. 5 Stanford men's bas
ketball team (11-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
opened up Pac-10 play with a victory over Washing
ton State, the Cardinal was, once again, forced to
play without one of its big name stars.
And no it wasn't junior All-American candidate
Josh Childress this time.
Childress suited up for his first game this season
in the 73-51 Stanford win after missing over a month
of action with a fractured left foot.
On this particular occasion, it was Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery who was forced to sit out.
On Friday, Montgomery served a one-game suspen
sion for bumping an official last season.
Assistant coach Tony Fuller filled in on the side
lines for Montgomery, while Stanford alumni waved
around cut-outs of Montgomery's face on wooden
sticks to remind everyone the players included
that he was definitely there in spirit.
"We tried to downplay [Montgomery's absence]
