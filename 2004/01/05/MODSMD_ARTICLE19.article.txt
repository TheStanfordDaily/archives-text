# Card burns two top teams over break
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So far, almost all the breaks have gone Stanford's
way. In December, the Cardinal men's basketball
team gained two new freshmen, beat six opponents in
cluding then-top-ranked Kansas and leapt 16 spots in
the national rankings.
But just as important was one "break" that didn't
come Stanford's way: Josh Childress's ailing foot
healed without developing a stress fracture, and he
saw his first action of the season on Jan. 2 in the Cardi
nal's win over Washington State.

The team didn't exactly flounder in the absence of
its junior All-America candidate. On Dec. 6, the Sat
urday before final exams, Stanford passed a big test by
defeating Kansas 64-58 in the John Wooden Classic in
Anaheim, Calif. Matt Lottich hit a clutch 3-pointer
and Chris Hernandez sank four free throws in a 10-1
Stanford run in the waning minutes.
"I thought Lottich made some big shots for Stan
ford," said Kansas head coach Bill Self after the game.
"The thing about Stanford is that they've got good
players that play really well together ... This isn't an
upset today."
