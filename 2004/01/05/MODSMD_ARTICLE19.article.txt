# Card burns two top teams over break
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
So far, almost all the breaks have gone Stanford's
way. In December, the Cardinal men's basketball
team gained two new freshmen, beat six opponents in
cluding then-top-ranked Kansas and leapt 16 spots in
the national rankings.
But just as important was one "break" that didn't
come Stanford's way: Josh Childress's ailing foot
healed without developing a stress fracture, and he
saw his first action of the season on Jan. 2 in the Cardi
nal's win over Washington State.

The team didn't exactly flounder in the absence of
its junior All-America candidate. On Dec. 6, the Sat
urday before final exams, Stanford passed a big test by
defeating Kansas 64-58 in the John Wooden Classic in
Anaheim, Calif. Matt Lottich hit a clutch 3-pointer
and Chris Hernandez sank four free throws in a 10-1
Stanford run in the waning minutes.
"I thought Lottich made some big shots for Stan
ford," said Kansas head coach Bill Self after the game.
"The thing about Stanford is that they've got good
players that play really well together ... This isn't an
upset today."
A week later, senior forward
Justin Davis turned in arguably the
best performance of his career in
leading the Cardinal to a win over
UNLV, which had previously de
feated Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nents California and Southern Cali
fornia. Davis scored 21 points on 9-
of-10 shooting, pulled down 10 re
bounds and handed out three assists
without committing a single
turnover.
Starting in place of Hernandez,
who was sitting out the first of two
games with back spasms, sophomore
point guard Jason Haas ran the of
fense efficiently, collecting six points
and five assists in 33 minutes. Matt
Lottich added 17 points and six as
sists, and sophomore forward Matt
Haryasz capitalized on Stanford's
dominance in the paint with a ca
reer-high 10 points in 13 minutes.
On Dec. 15, it was Rob Little's
turn to lead the team in scoring with
17 points as the Cardinal shot 54 per
cent in a 77-50 tune-up win over
Florida International.
"We're trying to get our basket
ball team to get at a consistent level,"
Montgomery told the Associated
Press after the game. "This wasn't

that. We have a much different type
of challenge on Saturday, so it's back
to work."
That challenge a match-up
with then-No. 13 Gonzaga turned
out to be surmountable thanks to a
masterful exhibition of shooting
prowess from Lottich. The senior
netted six of his seven 3-point at
tempts on the way to a career-high
34 points as the Cardinal outgunned
the Zags 87-80.
Lottich also had seven assists,
Nick Robinson had eight assists, and
big men Little and Davis garnered a
combined 32 points and 16 re
bounds. The win was Stanford's sec
ond in two years over the media dar
ling Zags, who began the season
ranked higher than the Cardinal.
As in the win over UNLV, Stan
ford used quick ball movement to
capitalize on its offensive balance.
Prior to yesterday's win over Wash
ington, the Cardinal had five players
with a double-digit scoring average
and three more averaging at least six
points per game.
Stanford's two other games in
December were notable for the
emergence of sophomore reserves
Haryasz and Dan Grunfeld and the
debuts of freshmen Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford.
Grunfeld scored 21 and Haryasz
had 15 as Stanford coasted to a 67-37
win over Southern Utah on Dec. 22.

Six days later, another career-high
from Haryasz helped the Cardinal
put a hurting on hapless Harvard,
100-59. The lanky forward scored 16
points and hauled in seven rebounds
in just 15 minutes of play in Stan
ford's first 100-point game in nearly
two years.
The Southern Utah game marked
the first appearance in a Stanford
basketball uniform for freshmen
Mark Bradford and Evan Moore.
Bradford, a guard, and Moore, a for
ward, each made some dazzling
plays as wide receivers on the Stan
ford football team in the fall. But the
two have been limited to mop-up
duty on the basketball court so far.
Fellow freshman Fred Washing
ton has earned more minutes in re
cent games, but he has not made his
way into the regular rotation, in part
because of the team's remarkable
depth. The Cardinal have 10 players
earning significant minutes in every
game, all of whom are legitimate
scoring threats.
Montgomery said the team con
cept has been a point of emphasis
this year, and added, "I think this
group has been really good about
buying into that."
After entering winter break
ranked No. 21 in the nation, the Car
dinal stood at No. 5 yesterday, be
hind only Connecticut, Duke, Geor
gia Tech and Arizona.

upset today."
A week later, senior forward
Justin Davis turned in arguably the
best performance of his career in
leading the Cardinal to a win over
UNLV, which had previously de
feated Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nents California and Southern Cali
fornia. Davis scored 21 points on 9-
of-10 shooting, pulled down 10 re
bounds and handed out three assists
without committing a single
turnover.
Starting in place of Hernandez,
who was sitting out the first of two
games with back spasms, sophomore
point guard Jason Haas ran the of
fense efficiently, collecting six points
and five assists in 33 minutes. Matt
Lottich added 17 points and six as
sists, and sophomore forward Matt
Haryasz capitalized on Stanford's
dominance in the paint with a ca
reer-high 10 points in 13 minutes.
On Dec. 15, it was Rob Little's
turn to lead the team in scoring with
17 points as the Cardinal shot 54 per
cent in a 77-50 tune-up win over
Florida International.
"We're trying to get our basket
ball team to get at a consistent level,"
Montgomery told the Associated
Press after the game. "This wasn't

that. We have a much different type
of challenge on Saturday, so it's back
to work."
That challenge a match-up
with then-No. 13 Gonzaga turned
out to be surmountable thanks to a
masterful exhibition of shooting
prowess from Lottich. The senior
netted six of his seven 3-point at
tempts on the way to a career-high
34 points as the Cardinal outgunned
the Zags 87-80.
Lottich also had seven assists,
Nick Robinson had eight assists, and
big men Little and Davis garnered a
combined 32 points and 16 re
bounds. The win was Stanford's sec
ond in two years over the media dar
ling Zags, who began the season
ranked higher than the Cardinal.
As in the win over UNLV, Stan
ford used quick ball movement to
capitalize on its offensive balance.
Prior to yesterday's win over Wash
ington, the Cardinal had five players
with a double-digit scoring average
and three more averaging at least six
points per game.
Stanford's two other games in
December were notable for the
emergence of sophomore reserves
Haryasz and Dan Grunfeld and the
debuts of freshmen Evan Moore and
Mark Bradford.
Grunfeld scored 21 and Haryasz
had 15 as Stanford coasted to a 67-37
win over Southern Utah on Dec. 22.

Six days later, another career-high
from Haryasz helped the Cardinal
put a hurting on hapless Harvard,
100-59. The lanky forward scored 16
points and hauled in seven rebounds
in just 15 minutes of play in Stan
ford's first 100-point game in nearly
two years.
The Southern Utah game marked
the first appearance in a Stanford
basketball uniform for freshmen
Mark Bradford and Evan Moore.
Bradford, a guard, and Moore, a for
ward, each made some dazzling
plays as wide receivers on the Stan
ford football team in the fall. But the
two have been limited to mop-up
duty on the basketball court so far.
Fellow freshman Fred Washing
ton has earned more minutes in re
cent games, but he has not made his
way into the regular rotation, in part
because of the team's remarkable
depth. The Cardinal have 10 players
earning significant minutes in every
game, all of whom are legitimate
scoring threats.
Montgomery said the team con
cept has been a point of emphasis
this year, and added, "I think this
group has been really good about
buying into that."
After entering winter break
ranked No. 21 in the nation, the Car
dinal stood at No. 5 yesterday, be
hind only Connecticut, Duke, Geor
gia Tech and Arizona.
So far, almost all the breaks have gone Stanford's
way. In December, the Cardinal men's basketball
team gained two new freshmen, beat six opponents in
cluding then-top-ranked Kansas and leapt 16 spots in
the national rankings.
But just as important was one "break" that didn't
come Stanford's way: Josh Childress's ailing foot
healed without developing a stress fracture, and he
saw his first action of the season on Jan. 2 in the Cardi
nal's win over Washington State.

The team didn't exactly flounder in the absence of
its junior All-America candidate. On Dec. 6, the Sat
urday before final exams, Stanford passed a big test by
defeating Kansas 64-58 in the John Wooden Classic in
Anaheim, Calif. Matt Lottich hit a clutch 3-pointer
and Chris Hernandez sank four free throws in a 10-1
Stanford run in the waning minutes.
"I thought Lottich made some big shots for Stan
ford," said Kansas head coach Bill Self after the game.
"The thing about Stanford is that they've got good
players that play really well together ... This isn't an
upset today."
