# Cordell finally joins council
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Vice Provost for Campus Relations LaDoris Cordell official
ly became a Palo Alto city council member Jan. 1, bringing con
tract negotiations between Stanford and Palo Alto to a halt.
Cordell will be sworn in today despite complications over
an old section of state law that nearly prevented her from taking
the seat.
According to Section 1090 of the government code, a city coun
cil may not contract with a corporation for which a city council
member works. Though there are a handful of exemptions to the
law, none currently applies to Cordell. Until the situation can be re
solved, the city council has opted to hold off on negotiating any con
tracts with Stanford. The council is hoping to have emergency leg
islation passed by the state to alter the law in the near future.
"We have somewhere between 50 to 100 contracts with Stan
ford," said city council member Bern Beecham. "Some are
major, some are minor, so the city administrative staff worked
with Stanford to clean up what it could in December."
Even though there are so many ongoing contractual negotiations
between the city and Stanford, dealing with everything from the Stan
ford shopping center to Marguerite bus schedules, none was so pressing
that it could not be put on hold for at least the first quarter of this year.
"Nothing involving policies was brought to the council at that
time, so there,s been no policy changes," Beecham said.
State Sen. Byron Sher (D-San Jose) has agreed to sponsor the
emergency legislation, which would alter the current exemption
for nonprofit organizations to include trusts that operate as non
profits, such as Stanford.
The bill would "allow Stanford to conduct business with Palo
Alto as it would if it were virtually any other private university in
the state of California," explained Beecham. The earliest the leg
islation could take place is this March.
"We're not aware of any opposition to it, so we are hopeful it
will be successful," he said.
Along with having the support of the rest of the city council,
Cordell "brings the strength of having the support of the elec
torate," Beecham said. "She is really one of the people that the
city wants to have help run the community. She's got experience
in being fair and making decisions in an imperfect world."
