# Water polo loses heartbreaker to Trojans in final
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford was unable to best No. 1
Southern California in the NCAA Water
Polo Championship on Dec. 7 at the Avery
Aquatic Center.
Not even an amazing four goals by the
nation's top player, junior driver Tony
Azevedo who was named the American
Water Polo Coaches Association Player of
the Year for the third time last week
could bring Stanford the win over the Tro
jans, though the Cardinal managed to push
the match into overtime.
More than 2,800 spectators crowded the
aisles to witness the hard fought contest that
ended with a 9-7 USC victory and extended
the Trojans' winning streak against the Car
dinal this season to four. While each game
was close, Stanford remained unable to con
quer the tough, physical play of Southern
California.
"I'm just so proud of my players after
what they've been through these past three
or four years. It's been very tough, but in the
end it's all worth it," said Southern Califor
nia head coach Jovan Vavic. "Stanford
played one of the best games this season."
The formidable Predrag Damjanov led the
Trojans in scoring with three goals, including
the final goal of regulation. Damjanov is a 6-
foot-5 senior from Belgrade, Yugoslavia, list
ed at 280 pounds, though he claims to have
come down to 265 in training. His size made
him a tough match-up at the two-meter posi
tion for the smaller Cardinal players.
"I was very proud of the team and how
we fought," said Cardinal head coach John
Vargas. "I thought we played pretty well
defensively, but give credit to USC, they
played great. (USC's) Damjanov presented
a lot of problems because of his size, but I
thought we played good defense to keep
the game close."
Though the Cardinal battled the Trojans
to a 7-7 tie at the end of regulation play, USC

would not let Stanford take control of the
game.
"No one ever gave up out there tonight,"
Vavic said.
Both teams remained scoreless in the first
overtime period. The Trojans' Trevor Clark
scored the winning goal with 56 seconds left
in the second overtime period.
The main focus points for the Cardinal in
facing the Trojans were defense and stamina,
areas that the squad has tried to improve all
season. Although Stanford has improved its
defense as a team and has seen a strong
showing by sophomore goalie Chad Taylor
(who has scored 190 saves this season), the
Cardinal offense presented the match's ini
tial problem, as it appeared shut down by the
Trojan's inside coverage.
"This is a game that is all about match ups
and we really match up well against Stan
ford," Vavic said.
The Trojans led 4-1 at the half, but the
Cardinal came out strong in the third period
with shots by Azevedo, senior utility Mike
Derse and sophomore driver Peter Varellas.
USC broke the tie on a goal with 1:54 left in
the third period and a goal by Damjanov
near the start of the fourth.
Junior driver Matt Moser added a goal
with an assist by sophomore Thomas Hop
kins and Azevedo went on to score twice
more in the fourth period to tie the game and
give Stanford the lead, but the Trojans an
swered on a power-play, sending the match
into overtime.
"We looked pretty good defensively,"
said Vargas, "Offensively, Tony [Azeve
do] tried to carry us on his back and he
came close."
The Cardinal scored an easy 14-8 victory
over Loyola Marymount in the semifinal
game to advance to the championship.
Azevedo and Varellas each had four goals
for the match, while freshman driver JJ Gar
ton scored a hat-trick.
"I really felt it was our whole team going at
100 percent and that really set the tone right

there," said Azevedo of the LMU game, "I
think they played better tonight than they did
earlier in the season, but us playing at home
and trying to fuel ourselves for the champi
onship game, we really came out on fire."
In addition to garnering AWPCA Player
of the Year honors, Azevedo was also cho

sen as the 2003 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Player of the year for the third time
and was named Co-MVP of the NCAA
Tournament, along with the Trojan's goalie
Bozidar Damjanovic. Azevedo is Stanford's
all-time leading scorer with 252 goals, 89 of
which he scored this season.

Several other Stanford players were also
recognized by the AWPCA. Derse, who
scored 27 goals during the 2003 season, and
Taylor were named second team All-Ameri
cans. Hopkins, the Cardinal's second-lead
ing scorer with 47 goals, was named Honor
able Mention All-American
