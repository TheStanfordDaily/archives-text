# No. 9 Card goes 2-2 in winter break matchups
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
This past weekend the No. 9 women's basketball team
saw the best and worst of the Pacific 10 Conference on its an
nual trip to Washington. The Cardinal met the tournament
tested Huskies and last year's last place Cougars and
walked away with two victories.
The shooting prowess of the Huskies and what was
possibly the loudest crowd of the year kept the game
close in the first half, but an immediate surge out of the lock
er room gave the Cardinal a 14-point lead.
The three-point shooting of the Cardinal showed up on
Sunday, a component of its game that had been missing in
earlier season action and it showed up big.
In the first half alone Stanford sunk eight treys on 61.5
percent shooting from behind the arc. To start the second
half the Cardinal continued its strong shooting, but with
Powell on the sideline receiving treatment for her ankle, the
Huskies trimmed what had been an 14 point lead to just six
on a three by Cameo Hicks.
With Powell back in the game, reigning Pac-10 Player of
the Year Giuliana Mendiola followed up Hicks to cut the
Husky deficit to just two on a baseline spin move.
Up 71-69 with just over a minute left and Powell working
a one-on-one situation, Stanford couldn't get a shot off.
However, foul trouble plagued the Huskies down the
stretch and Washington sent Powell to the line multiple
times to close out the game.
"That's not a knock of the officiating," said Washington
head coach June Daugherty. "It was our defense that didn't
get the job done."
Playing at what she called "85-90 percent" health, Powell
recorded a double-double of 23 points and 13 boards.
"I wasn't able to push off on some plays like I wanted to,"
said Powell. "[And after missing three games] my condition
ing isn't all the way there."
The Cardinal has always maintained a sterling record
against Washington State (4-8,0-3 Pac-10). Friday night was
no different.
The Cardinal pushed its record to 37-0 against the
Cougars with a dominating 90-69 victory all without All-
American forward Powell.
Despite a slow start and a flu bug that limited starting
point guard Susan Borchardt to just eight minutes Stan
ford looked to be in control from start to finish.
"They're just that good," said WSU head coach Sher
ri Murrell, whose team had quite a fast start, holding the
lead until sophomore Krista Rappahahn made a three
pointer with 12:45 to go in the first half to give the Cardi
nal the lead for good.
The Cougars did an excellent job of taking away the high
low game that the Cardinal has been relying on all season.
With a quick guard sagging in the lane to take away the
post-entry pass, Stanford went to its outside shooting and
shots that hadn't been falling all season.
The Cardinal certainly turned things around on Friday
night. It shot an almost unbelievable 65 percent from beyond
the arc, with guards Kelley Suminski, Sebnem Kimyacioglu
and Rappahahn leading the way. The three combined to
shoot 13-for-18 from downtown.
"We've won a lot of games shooting poorly from 3, so it

was really nice to get some shots going down," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
Suminski recorded a double-double with a season-high
22 points and a career-high 10 assists, while running the of
fense for Borchardt. The junior missed only one shot all
night, going 5-for-6 from the field.
"I've been struggling with my shooting so far this sea
son," said Suminski. "So I've been trying to come into
games with a different attitude, trying to be more confi
dent in my shot."
Suminski hadn't been the only one struggling. Kimya
cioglu's performance was also somewhat of a breakthrough
it was just the second night of good shooting seen from the
junior this season.
Even though WSU did a nice job of taking away Stan
ford's high-low game, the Cardinal post players were far
from ineffective. In just 20 minutes of playing time, 6-foot-5
freshman phenom Kristen Newlin broke her own school
record for blocks in a single game with eight six of them
coming in the second half.
The Stanford squad returns home this week, hosting Ari
zona State on Thursday and No. 25 Arizona on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

While the rest of campus was
resting at home recovering from fi
nals, the No. 9 women's basketball
team (10-2) played X games and
took on three ranked teams, in
cluding then-No. 2 Tennessee (7-1)
and then-No. 3 Texas Tech (12-0).
The Cardinal, however, was
unable to knock off their top
ranked opponents, falling 70-66
in overtime to the Lady Volun
teers and 55-46 to the Lady
Raiders.
The loss to Tennessee was es
pecially disappointing for the
Cardinal, as Stanford held the
lead for nearly the entire game
with as much as a 13-point advan
tage before collapsing in the
second half.
In the first half a combination
of stellar team defense and a
near-perfect half as from forward
Nicole Powell led the way for the
Cardinal.
Stanford held Tennessee to
just 18 first-half points the
fewest ever in school history
resulting in a 29-18 disadvantage.
Meanwhile, on the offensive
end of the floor, Powell was ev
erywhere for the Cardinal in the
first half. The Ail-American shot
6-for-10 and had 14 points in the
first half.
Powell's offensive versatility
forced Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt and the rest of the Lady
Volunteers to try five different
defenders on the senior forward
before finally settling on 6-foot-5
center Ashley Robinson just be
fore halftime.
Despite the large deficit that
the Lady Vols faced, the team
has a recent history of late come
backs against the Cardinal and it
was clear that Tennessee was
never out of the game.
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer was forced to leave
Powell in for the entirety of the
game and fatigue clearly took its
toll.
Powell came out cold in the
second half at one point miss
ing 10 straight shots, most of
them short. But instead of anoth
er teammate stepping up, most
seemed to stand around and wait
for Powell's hot hand to come
back.
"I don't think it's a good situ
ation to depend on only one per
son," VanDerveer said. "Nicole
was looking to create for other
people, but we've got to make
shots."
"That's when you need to be
mentally tougher," Powell
added.
"I forced a couple of shots. I
was missing shots from two and
three feet. I need to knock those
down. That's my shot."
Powell took 25 shots in the
second half and overtime and
made just seven. By comparison,
the rest of the team took just 30
shots over the course of the en
tire game.
The Lady Vols never pan
icked and steadily clawed their
way back into the game as a
team.
"Everyone made at least one
play that made a difference
today," Summitt said.
The Lady Vols' teamwork
was evident: whether it was
Shanna Zolman's sharp-shoot
ing from the outside the
sophomore finished with a
team-high 18 points or Ash
ley Robinson's key stops on
Powell, or, what was arguably

the play that won the game for
Tennesee LaToya Davis'
steal and layup to tie things up
with 20 seconds to go.
Davis' play came with Ten
nessee trailing 56-54, just after
Kelley Suminski drew an offen
sive foul on guard Loree Moore
sending the junior to the
bench with five personals.
Looking to have the game in
hand for the Cardinal, Suminski
started to take the ball up the
floor, but the Tennessee full
court pressure was too much for
the junior guard and Davis
stripped her just before the half
court line. Davis took it straight
to the hoop and converted to tie
the game.
Stanford had one chance left
and cleared the floor to run an
isolation play for none other than
Nicole Powell. It was Powell's
last chance to make everyone for
get her dismal shooting perfor
mance in the second half.
In a one-on-one with Ashley
Robinson, Powell got a step on
her and had a layup, but Robin
son's long arms changed Powell's
shot, forcing her to come up
short.
The Cardinal clearly needed
more from its supporting cast.
Two starters guards Susan
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimya
cioglu failed to score.
"We had some people playing
tight," VanDerveer said. "Peo
ple had open shots. Shots that
have been going down in practice
and in other games and when
those shots didn't go, Nicole
tried to do a little more."

In Stanford's other top-10
matchup, with No. 3 Texas Tech,
the Cardinal not only lost the
game, but with 6:18 to go in the
first half, the squad also lost its
leader in points, rebounds and
assists for three games when
Powell went down with a severe
ly sprained ankle.
The game saw two freshmen
come up big Kristen Newlin
for Stanford and Alesha Robert
son for Texas Tech.
Newlin recorded the game's
only double-double, finishing
with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
Robertson, making her first
career start, was deadly on the
offensive side of the floor and
scored a game-high 18 points.
With Powell out of the lineup,
the rest of the squad was forced
to step up and did just that
recording blowout wins over
Oregon State and Oregon with
respective scores of 88-65 and
77-51.
Borchardt stood out for the
Cardinal in both matchups, tak
ing over point guard duties for
Kelley Suminski, who remained
in the starting lineup, but was
shifted to the off-guard spot.
Borchardt's effectiveness at
pushing the ball upcourt, cou
pled with the fact that Kimya
cioglu regained her shooting
form, made the absence of Pow
ell go almost unnoticed.
The Cardinal traveled to the
Pacific Northwest to continue
Pac-10 play with matchups
against Washington on Sunday
and Washington State on Friday
night.

Card's win over WSU, posting a season-high 22 points.

Senior Nicole Powell played a stellar first half against Tennessee before shooting
troubles hit Stanford. The Cardinal recorded two losses on the weekend.
This past weekend the No. 9 women's basketball team
saw the best and worst of the Pacific 10 Conference on its an
nual trip to Washington. The Cardinal met the tournament
tested Huskies and last year's last place Cougars and
walked away with two victories.
The shooting prowess of the Huskies and what was
possibly the loudest crowd of the year kept the game
close in the first half, but an immediate surge out of the lock
er room gave the Cardinal a 14-point lead.
The three-point shooting of the Cardinal showed up on
Sunday, a component of its game that had been missing in
earlier season action and it showed up big.
In the first half alone Stanford sunk eight treys on 61.5
percent shooting from behind the arc. To start the second
half the Cardinal continued its strong shooting, but with
Powell on the sideline receiving treatment for her ankle, the
Huskies trimmed what had been an 14 point lead to just six
on a three by Cameo Hicks.
With Powell back in the game, reigning Pac-10 Player of
the Year Giuliana Mendiola followed up Hicks to cut the
Husky deficit to just two on a baseline spin move.
Up 71-69 with just over a minute left and Powell working
a one-on-one situation, Stanford couldn't get a shot off.
However, foul trouble plagued the Huskies down the
stretch and Washington sent Powell to the line multiple
times to close out the game.
"That's not a knock of the officiating," said Washington
head coach June Daugherty. "It was our defense that didn't
get the job done."
Playing at what she called "85-90 percent" health, Powell
recorded a double-double of 23 points and 13 boards.
"I wasn't able to push off on some plays like I wanted to,"
said Powell. "[And after missing three games] my condition
ing isn't all the way there."
The Cardinal has always maintained a sterling record
against Washington State (4-8,0-3 Pac-10). Friday night was
no different.
The Cardinal pushed its record to 37-0 against the
Cougars with a dominating 90-69 victory all without All-
American forward Powell.
Despite a slow start and a flu bug that limited starting
point guard Susan Borchardt to just eight minutes Stan
ford looked to be in control from start to finish.
"They're just that good," said WSU head coach Sher
ri Murrell, whose team had quite a fast start, holding the
lead until sophomore Krista Rappahahn made a three
pointer with 12:45 to go in the first half to give the Cardi
nal the lead for good.
The Cougars did an excellent job of taking away the high
low game that the Cardinal has been relying on all season.
With a quick guard sagging in the lane to take away the
post-entry pass, Stanford went to its outside shooting and
shots that hadn't been falling all season.
The Cardinal certainly turned things around on Friday
night. It shot an almost unbelievable 65 percent from beyond
the arc, with guards Kelley Suminski, Sebnem Kimyacioglu
and Rappahahn leading the way. The three combined to
shoot 13-for-18 from downtown.
"We've won a lot of games shooting poorly from 3, so it

was really nice to get some shots going down," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
Suminski recorded a double-double with a season-high
22 points and a career-high 10 assists, while running the of
fense for Borchardt. The junior missed only one shot all
night, going 5-for-6 from the field.
"I've been struggling with my shooting so far this sea
son," said Suminski. "So I've been trying to come into
games with a different attitude, trying to be more confi
dent in my shot."
Suminski hadn't been the only one struggling. Kimya
cioglu's performance was also somewhat of a breakthrough
it was just the second night of good shooting seen from the
junior this season.
Even though WSU did a nice job of taking away Stan
ford's high-low game, the Cardinal post players were far
from ineffective. In just 20 minutes of playing time, 6-foot-5
freshman phenom Kristen Newlin broke her own school
record for blocks in a single game with eight six of them
coming in the second half.
The Stanford squad returns home this week, hosting Ari
zona State on Thursday and No. 25 Arizona on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

While the rest of campus was
resting at home recovering from fi
nals, the No. 9 women's basketball
team (10-2) played X games and
took on three ranked teams, in
cluding then-No. 2 Tennessee (7-1)
and then-No. 3 Texas Tech (12-0).
The Cardinal, however, was
unable to knock off their top
ranked opponents, falling 70-66
in overtime to the Lady Volun
teers and 55-46 to the Lady
Raiders.
The loss to Tennessee was es
pecially disappointing for the
Cardinal, as Stanford held the
lead for nearly the entire game
with as much as a 13-point advan
tage before collapsing in the
second half.
In the first half a combination
of stellar team defense and a
near-perfect half as from forward
Nicole Powell led the way for the
Cardinal.
Stanford held Tennessee to
just 18 first-half points the
fewest ever in school history
resulting in a 29-18 disadvantage.
Meanwhile, on the offensive
end of the floor, Powell was ev
erywhere for the Cardinal in the
first half. The Ail-American shot
6-for-10 and had 14 points in the
first half.
Powell's offensive versatility
forced Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt and the rest of the Lady
Volunteers to try five different
defenders on the senior forward
before finally settling on 6-foot-5
center Ashley Robinson just be
fore halftime.
Despite the large deficit that
the Lady Vols faced, the team
has a recent history of late come
backs against the Cardinal and it
was clear that Tennessee was
never out of the game.
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer was forced to leave
Powell in for the entirety of the
game and fatigue clearly took its
toll.
Powell came out cold in the
second half at one point miss
ing 10 straight shots, most of
them short. But instead of anoth
er teammate stepping up, most
seemed to stand around and wait
for Powell's hot hand to come
back.
"I don't think it's a good situ
ation to depend on only one per
son," VanDerveer said. "Nicole
was looking to create for other
people, but we've got to make
shots."
"That's when you need to be
mentally tougher," Powell
added.
"I forced a couple of shots. I
was missing shots from two and
three feet. I need to knock those
down. That's my shot."
Powell took 25 shots in the
second half and overtime and
made just seven. By comparison,
the rest of the team took just 30
shots over the course of the en
tire game.
The Lady Vols never pan
icked and steadily clawed their
way back into the game as a
team.
"Everyone made at least one
play that made a difference
today," Summitt said.
The Lady Vols' teamwork
was evident: whether it was
Shanna Zolman's sharp-shoot
ing from the outside the
sophomore finished with a
team-high 18 points or Ash
ley Robinson's key stops on
Powell, or, what was arguably

the play that won the game for
Tennesee LaToya Davis'
steal and layup to tie things up
with 20 seconds to go.
Davis' play came with Ten
nessee trailing 56-54, just after
Kelley Suminski drew an offen
sive foul on guard Loree Moore
sending the junior to the
bench with five personals.
Looking to have the game in
hand for the Cardinal, Suminski
started to take the ball up the
floor, but the Tennessee full
court pressure was too much for
the junior guard and Davis
stripped her just before the half
court line. Davis took it straight
to the hoop and converted to tie
the game.
Stanford had one chance left
and cleared the floor to run an
isolation play for none other than
Nicole Powell. It was Powell's
last chance to make everyone for
get her dismal shooting perfor
mance in the second half.
In a one-on-one with Ashley
Robinson, Powell got a step on
her and had a layup, but Robin
son's long arms changed Powell's
shot, forcing her to come up
short.
The Cardinal clearly needed
more from its supporting cast.
Two starters guards Susan
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimya
cioglu failed to score.
"We had some people playing
tight," VanDerveer said. "Peo
ple had open shots. Shots that
have been going down in practice
and in other games and when
those shots didn't go, Nicole
tried to do a little more."

In Stanford's other top-10
matchup, with No. 3 Texas Tech,
the Cardinal not only lost the
game, but with 6:18 to go in the
first half, the squad also lost its
leader in points, rebounds and
assists for three games when
Powell went down with a severe
ly sprained ankle.
The game saw two freshmen
come up big Kristen Newlin
for Stanford and Alesha Robert
son for Texas Tech.
Newlin recorded the game's
only double-double, finishing
with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
Robertson, making her first
career start, was deadly on the
offensive side of the floor and
scored a game-high 18 points.
With Powell out of the lineup,
the rest of the squad was forced
to step up and did just that
recording blowout wins over
Oregon State and Oregon with
respective scores of 88-65 and
77-51.

tight," VanDerveer said. "Peo
ple had open shots. Shots that
have been going down in practice
and in other games and when
those shots didn't go, Nicole
tried to do a little more."

In Stanford's other top-10
matchup, with No. 3 Texas Tech,
the Cardinal not only lost the
game, but with 6:18 to go in the
first half, the squad also lost its
leader in points, rebounds and
assists for three games when
Powell went down with a severe
ly sprained ankle.
The game saw two freshmen
come up big Kristen Newlin
for Stanford and Alesha Robert
son for Texas Tech.
Newlin recorded the game's
only double-double, finishing
with 14 points and 12 rebounds.
Robertson, making her first
career start, was deadly on the
offensive side of the floor and
scored a game-high 18 points.
With Powell out of the lineup,
the rest of the squad was forced
to step up and did just that
recording blowout wins over
Oregon State and Oregon with
respective scores of 88-65 and
77-51.
Borchardt stood out for the
Cardinal in both matchups, tak
ing over point guard duties for
Kelley Suminski, who remained
in the starting lineup, but was
shifted to the off-guard spot.
Borchardt's effectiveness at
pushing the ball upcourt, cou
pled with the fact that Kimya
cioglu regained her shooting
form, made the absence of Pow
ell go almost unnoticed.
The Cardinal traveled to the
Pacific Northwest to continue
Pac-10 play with matchups
against Washington on Sunday
and Washington State on Friday
night.

Senior Nicole Powell played a stellar first half against Tennessee before shooting
troubles hit Stanford. The Cardinal recorded two losses on the weekend.
This past weekend the No. 9 women's basketball team
saw the best and worst of the Pacific 10 Conference on its an
nual trip to Washington. The Cardinal met the tournament
tested Huskies and last year's last place Cougars and
walked away with two victories.
The shooting prowess of the Huskies and what was
possibly the loudest crowd of the year kept the game
close in the first half, but an immediate surge out of the lock
er room gave the Cardinal a 14-point lead.
The three-point shooting of the Cardinal showed up on
Sunday, a component of its game that had been missing in
earlier season action and it showed up big.
In the first half alone Stanford sunk eight treys on 61.5
percent shooting from behind the arc. To start the second
half the Cardinal continued its strong shooting, but with
Powell on the sideline receiving treatment for her ankle, the
Huskies trimmed what had been an 14 point lead to just six
on a three by Cameo Hicks.
With Powell back in the game, reigning Pac-10 Player of
the Year Giuliana Mendiola followed up Hicks to cut the
Husky deficit to just two on a baseline spin move.
Up 71-69 with just over a minute left and Powell working
a one-on-one situation, Stanford couldn't get a shot off.
However, foul trouble plagued the Huskies down the
stretch and Washington sent Powell to the line multiple
times to close out the game.
"That's not a knock of the officiating," said Washington
head coach June Daugherty. "It was our defense that didn't
get the job done."
Playing at what she called "85-90 percent" health, Powell
recorded a double-double of 23 points and 13 boards.
"I wasn't able to push off on some plays like I wanted to,"
said Powell. "[And after missing three games] my condition
ing isn't all the way there."
The Cardinal has always maintained a sterling record
against Washington State (4-8,0-3 Pac-10). Friday night was
no different.
The Cardinal pushed its record to 37-0 against the
Cougars with a dominating 90-69 victory all without All-
American forward Powell.
Despite a slow start and a flu bug that limited starting
point guard Susan Borchardt to just eight minutes Stan
ford looked to be in control from start to finish.
"They're just that good," said WSU head coach Sher
ri Murrell, whose team had quite a fast start, holding the
lead until sophomore Krista Rappahahn made a three
pointer with 12:45 to go in the first half to give the Cardi
nal the lead for good.
The Cougars did an excellent job of taking away the high
low game that the Cardinal has been relying on all season.
With a quick guard sagging in the lane to take away the
post-entry pass, Stanford went to its outside shooting and
shots that hadn't been falling all season.
The Cardinal certainly turned things around on Friday
night. It shot an almost unbelievable 65 percent from beyond
the arc, with guards Kelley Suminski, Sebnem Kimyacioglu
and Rappahahn leading the way. The three combined to
shoot 13-for-18 from downtown.
"We've won a lot of games shooting poorly from 3, so it

was really nice to get some shots going down," Stanford
coach Tara VanDerveer said.
Suminski recorded a double-double with a season-high
22 points and a career-high 10 assists, while running the of
fense for Borchardt. The junior missed only one shot all
night, going 5-for-6 from the field.
"I've been struggling with my shooting so far this sea
son," said Suminski. "So I've been trying to come into
games with a different attitude, trying to be more confi
dent in my shot."
Suminski hadn't been the only one struggling. Kimya
cioglu's performance was also somewhat of a breakthrough
it was just the second night of good shooting seen from the
junior this season.
Even though WSU did a nice job of taking away Stan
ford's high-low game, the Cardinal post players were far
from ineffective. In just 20 minutes of playing time, 6-foot-5
freshman phenom Kristen Newlin broke her own school
record for blocks in a single game with eight six of them
coming in the second half.
The Stanford squad returns home this week, hosting Ari
zona State on Thursday and No. 25 Arizona on Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.

While the rest of campus was
resting at home recovering from fi
nals, the No. 9 women's basketball
team (10-2) played X games and
took on three ranked teams, in
cluding then-No. 2 Tennessee (7-1)
and then-No. 3 Texas Tech (12-0).
The Cardinal, however, was
unable to knock off their top
ranked opponents, falling 70-66
in overtime to the Lady Volun
teers and 55-46 to the Lady
Raiders.
The loss to Tennessee was es
pecially disappointing for the
Cardinal, as Stanford held the
lead for nearly the entire game
with as much as a 13-point advan
tage before collapsing in the
second half.
In the first half a combination
of stellar team defense and a
near-perfect half as from forward
Nicole Powell led the way for the
Cardinal.
Stanford held Tennessee to
just 18 first-half points the
fewest ever in school history
resulting in a 29-18 disadvantage.
Meanwhile, on the offensive
end of the floor, Powell was ev
erywhere for the Cardinal in the
first half. The Ail-American shot
6-for-10 and had 14 points in the
first half.
Powell's offensive versatility
forced Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt and the rest of the Lady
Volunteers to try five different
defenders on the senior forward
before finally settling on 6-foot-5
center Ashley Robinson just be
fore halftime.
Despite the large deficit that
the Lady Vols faced, the team
has a recent history of late come
backs against the Cardinal and it
was clear that Tennessee was
never out of the game.
Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer was forced to leave
Powell in for the entirety of the
game and fatigue clearly took its
toll.
Powell came out cold in the
second half at one point miss
ing 10 straight shots, most of
them short. But instead of anoth
er teammate stepping up, most
seemed to stand around and wait
for Powell's hot hand to come
back.
"I don't think it's a good situ
ation to depend on only one per
son," VanDerveer said. "Nicole
was looking to create for other
people, but we've got to make
shots."
"That's when you need to be
mentally tougher," Powell
added.
"I forced a couple of shots. I
was missing shots from two and
three feet. I need to knock those
down. That's my shot."
Powell took 25 shots in the
second half and overtime and
made just seven. By comparison,
the rest of the team took just 30
shots over the course of the en
tire game.
The Lady Vols never pan
icked and steadily clawed their
way back into the game as a
team.
"Everyone made at least one
play that made a difference
today," Summitt said.
The Lady Vols' teamwork
was evident: whether it was
Shanna Zolman's sharp-shoot
ing from the outside the
sophomore finished with a
team-high 18 points or Ash
ley Robinson's key stops on
Powell, or, what was arguably

the play that won the game for
Tennesee LaToya Davis'
steal and layup to tie things up
with 20 seconds to go.
Davis' play came with Ten
nessee trailing 56-54, just after
Kelley Suminski drew an offen
sive foul on guard Loree Moore
sending the junior to the
bench with five personals.
Looking to have the game in
hand for the Cardinal, Suminski
started to take the ball up the
floor, but the Tennessee full
court pressure was too much for
the junior guard and Davis
stripped her just before the half
court line. Davis took it straight
to the hoop and converted to tie
the game.
Stanford had one chance left
and cleared the floor to run an
isolation play for none other than
Nicole Powell. It was Powell's
last chance to make everyone for
get her dismal shooting perfor
mance in the second half.
In a one-on-one with Ashley
Robinson, Powell got a step on
her and had a layup, but Robin
son's long arms changed Powell's
shot, forcing her to come up
short.
The Cardinal clearly needed
more from its supporting cast.
Two starters guards Susan
Borchardt and Sebnem Kimya
cioglu failed to score.
"We had some people playing
tight," VanDerveer said. "Peo
ple had open shots. Shots that
have been going down in practice
and in other games and when
those shots didn't go, Nicole
tried to do a little more."
