## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DESK EDITOR 
Prof. Emeritus John W. Lewis will lead a delegation of
Americans to North Korea, possibly to visit the Yongbyon nu
clear weapons plant. The trip will occur Tuesday through Sat
urday.
The delegation comes at a delicate time, since the Bush ad
ministration currently opposes the North Korean nuclear pro
gram. North Korea, China, the United States, Russia, South
Korea and Japan have been involved in talks regarding the
issue that began last August. Those talks are expected to re
sume early this year.
In addition to Lewis, a former director of Stanford's Center
for International Security and Cooperation, the delegation will
also include Dr. Sigfried Hecker, a former director of the Los
Alamos national laboratory, and Jack Pritchard, a former staff
member of President bush's National Security Council.

The members of the delegation are known to favor talks with
North Korea.
The Bush administration, though it did not object to Dr.
Hecker traveling to North Korea, has said that the visit is not
government-sponsored.
"We neither facilitate nor oppose [the delegation]," State
Department spokesman Adam Ereli told the New York Times.
There is some fear among officials that North Korea would
use the visit to display its progress in developing nuclear
weapons and that the visit would disrupt current Bush admin
istration diplomacy.
"Any efforts that complicate prospects or undertakings to
reconvene the six-party talks and to achieve forward move
ment in dismantling North Korea's nuclear program aren't
helpful," Ereli said.
Though the delegation will probably visit Yongbyon, the
major site of the nuclear weapons program their schedule will
not be released until they arrive in North Korea.
