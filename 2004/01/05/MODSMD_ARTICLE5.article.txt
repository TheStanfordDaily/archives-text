### CARLY GEEHR STAFF WRITER 
In its last meeting of 2003, the Faculty Senate reviewed the results of the
Faculty Quality of Life survey and voted to grant the Bioengineering De
partment authority to admit candidates for Master of Science and Doctor of
Philosophy degrees.
The Web-based survey, conducted last May, was the work of the Quali
ty of Life Subcommittee of the Provost's Advisory Committee on the Status
of Women Faculty. The committee will use the results of the survey, in con
junction with the results of another survey conducted by the Subcommittee
on Faculty Compensation, Resources and Recognition, to present a com
prehensive report for the faculty senate late winter quarter.
An initial review of the survey, conducted by the Stanford Institute for
the Quantitative Study of Society, showed that 68 percent of the faculty sur
veyed reported being either satisfied or very satisfied with their positions at
Stanford. Further, these responses were very similar for every racial group,
gender and rank.
Though the results of the survey showed that the faculty have an gener
ally positive outlook on their positions at the University, Vice Provost for
Faculty Development Pat Jones said that the survey also showed areas
where faculty want to see improvement.
Several questions in the survey regarding faculty support within their en
vironments at Stanford were grouped together and analyzed as a unit.
Analysis of the responses showed that faculty feel moderately supported by
their environment, with females feeling less supported than males and non
whites feeling less supported than whites.
Provost John Etchemendy said that he is "grateful to all of the faculty
who took the time to complete the survey," and assured the senate that the
results will be reviewed carefully so as to "make Stanford not only a vibrant
intellectual environment for faculty and students but also a good work en
vironment for faculty and staff."
Responses to the survey will be reviewed with more of an emphasis on
gender differences for the committee report scheduled for March.
