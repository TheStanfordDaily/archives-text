Md. — The primarily Spanish
speaking housekeepers who alleged
recurring verbal abuse and unfair
treatment from their supervisors
decided to take their cases to the
university administration because
they are dissatisfied with their de
partment heads' responses to their
grievances.
About eight housekeepers, all ol
whom are first-generation immi
grants, first made their allegations
known to their Facilities Manage
ment department heads in the sum
mer through grievance hearings, a
formal means for university work
ers to voice work-related com
plaints and seek resolutions. The
upcoming hearing is scheduled for
Feb. 3.
During initial grievance hearings
held in July and August, the women
described instances where they said
their supervisors penalized them
unfairly, gave them disproportion
ately large workloads, pressured
them to sign documents in English,
ignored work-related injuries and
yelled at them disrespectfully.
A former Facilities Management
housekeeper contacted The Dia
mondback after a Dec. 2 story re
porting the women's allegations.
The man — who declined to be
named — said he noticed similar
working conditions during his near
decade as a university housekeeper.
He added supervisors give negative
references for people who try to find
different jobs, making it difficult for
immigrants to leave the university.
The housekeepers asked not to
be named because they feared re
taliatory action from their supervi
sors, which they said occurred in
the past after complaining about
their supervisors or their work
conditions.
Harry Teabout, director of
Building and Landscape Services,
which is in charge of grounds and
building maintenance on the cam

pus for Facilities Management,
wrote the responses to the women's
grievances. In his response memos
dated Oct. 10, Teabout expressed a
sense of disapproval about his su
pervisors' alleged actions and at
tributed many of the women's com
plaints to misperceptions and un
clear or nonexistent work proce
dures and policies.
Teabout also said in his memos
that he expects conditions to im
prove because of the ongoing train
ing supervisors receive.
"Given the amount of training
being given to our supervisors, I feel
that treatment to employees will get
better," he wrote. "We will look at
behaviors and if unacceptable, ac
tions will be taken to correct them."
The decision was made during a
meeting among seven of the women
involved in the grievance process,
two organizers from the American
Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees and Craig
Newman, a university employee
who fields workers' complaints for
AFSCME.
When Newman explained
Teabout's responses to the women
through a bilingual AFSCME orga
nizer, the women shook their heads
and grumbled disagreement.
Teabout also said in the memos
that Sandra Dykes, assistant director
of Housekeeping Services for Facili
ties Management, will draft new
work procedures and policies regard
ing staffing, medical restrictions and
absenteeism to be available to every
one in the housekeeping hierarchy.
"This is to include how absen
teeism and medical restrictions will
be dealt with and what are the pri
orities. This should be followed up
with additional team cleaning train
ing," Teabout wrote.
Dykes did not return repeated
phone calls, and Teabout could not
be reached for comment.
If the housekeepers are unsatis
fied with the university administra
tion's response after the February
hearing, they may make a final ap
peal at the state government level.
