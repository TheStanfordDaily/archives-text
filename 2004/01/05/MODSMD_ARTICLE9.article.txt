# Boulder denies sexual assault allegations
## 
### ADAMEWING COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. —Even though
2003 is coming to an end, two pending lawsuits that claim
the University of Colorado-Boulder was responsible for
its football players when several of them allegedly raped
two women at a 2001 party are moving forward.
The suits blame CU for not supervising its players,
who were hosting several high school recruits visiting the
campus during a December 2001 off-campus party,
which Lisa Simpson and Anne Gilmore said ultimately
led to their alleged sexual assaults.
Both women, who are openly pursuing litigation
using their own names, say CU is liable under Title IX, a
1972 federal law that prohibits discrimination based on
sex in public schools such as CU. The suit claims the al
leged assault, taken alongside a 1997 assault, constitutes
a pattern of discrimination against women on campus.
Gilmore s suit, which was filed earlier this month,
said CU "has had knowledge of pervasive and serious
sexual harassment of female students and other women
in connection with its football recruiting program since
at least December of 1997."
CU was made aware of problems with its recruit
ment practices at that time, after a 17-year-old girl was
brought to a party for 10 to 20 CU football players and
recruits and was allegedly sexually assaulted more than
once at a local hotel, Gilmore's suit states.

CU has denied responsibility regarding any crimes
that might have occurred at the Dec. 7,2001, party at the
apartment where Simpson and Gilmore lived, because
it was off campus.
"(Simpson) makes a novelistic and misleading at
tempt to shift the burden of legal responsibility to the
University for off-campus conduct initiated and con
trolled by individuals who acted on their own and not for
the institution," said CU regarding a motion filed in Oc
tober by Simpson.
Almost two years after the party, Gilmore said she
went into Simpson's bedroom to dance and was joined
by two football players. She said Simpson entered the
room to dance and lay down on her bed and passed out.
A player then sexually assaulted Gilmore, who was
not sober, while another man stood at her side, Gilmore
said. After that, a different player, who was naked, tried
to force Gilmore to masturbate him, she added.
A motion filed in October by Simpson said after
going to her bedroom to escape the crowd of strangers
at the party and falling asleep, she woke up to two men
undressing her.
Simpson said she was forced to have intercourse by
at least two high-school recruits as unidentified players
surrounded her while she was on her bed and forced her
to perform oral sex on at least one recruit, one player and
"probably others."
The allegations never led to sexual assault charges ac
tually being filed. Boulder District Attorney Mary

Keenan felt there was insufficient evidence to charge
anyone in the case.
CU-Boulder spokeswoman Pauline Hale said the
accusations that the university is not stringent about its
rules and regulations are not true.
"We strongly dispute the claim that the University
'fosters an environment' of sexual harassment," said CU
spokeswoman Pauline Hale. "CU-Boulder does not
now, nor has it ever, condoned underage drinking and
sexual misbehavior of any type by students or prospec
tive students, whether they are athletes or not."
Simpson said that the sexual assault and subsequent
events have radically altered the course of her life, but said
she feels like a weight has been lifted from her now that she
is proceeding with the case under her given name.
"I am a little nervous," said Simpson. "It's nice to
have (the issue) out there now; it's not something I
should hide from or be ashamed of. I didn't do anything
wrong... but I don't think my college life will ever be the
same again."
