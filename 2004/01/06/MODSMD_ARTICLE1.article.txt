# ASSU offers textbooks at discounted prices
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
By the time the second day of
classes begins, it can be difficult
for students to find all the text
books they need in the Stanford
Bookstore. What is often easy to
find, however, is a triple-digit
tab for the new and used books
they do manage to acquire.
Starting this quarter, the
ASSU is offering a different op
tion. After many years of stu
dent gripes and complaints
about Bookstore prices for used
books and a number of failed at
tempts to rectify the situation

and lower the cost of living on
campus, the ASSU has initiated
a used textbook sale.
The ASSU Book Service,
spearheaded by ASSU Vice
President Joseph Natoli, aims to
buy used textbooks from stu
dents for a better price than the
campus bookstore offers and
sell them cheaper.
The first phase of the service
took place during finals week
last quarter.
"We purchased $B,lOO worth
of books at the end of the quar
ter," Natoli said. "All of these

books we purchased off of stu
dents for more than the Book
store offered."
Now, in a four-day run from
Monday to Thursday, the ASSU
Book Service will sell these
books back to students from the
birdcage in White Plaza. Volun
teers will man the booth be
tween 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. on
those days.
According to Natoli, the ser
vice had a total of 31 books for
Physics 51, 23 for Math 51, 38 for
Psych 1 and two for Chem 33 to
offer as of Sunday.
The prices offered by the
book service are "at least $l5
less than what the Bookstore is
charging," Natoli said. "And this
assumes they even have used

books to sell, which typically are
in the shortest supply."
Lin cited the calculus text
book as an example. A used
copy costs $95 through the
ASSU Book Service, compared
with the Bookstore's price tag of
$112.50.
An e-mail advertisement sent
out yesterday touted the service
as the place that sells books for
"bottom dollar" and listed the
prices of the other textbooks of
fered: $55 for Psych 1, $95 for
Chem 33 and $lOO for Physics 51,
not including sales taxes.
But despite low costs, some
would-be customers have been
deterred by the program's re
quirement that buyers pay with
cash or check, and a policy
against returns that discourages
those who haven't finalized their
class schedules.
"At this time we're not ac
cepting returns because we can't
be sure who's buying a book

where, whether they're buying it
from us or not," said Winston
Lin, the communications direc
tor for the ASSU and a key orga
nizer of the service.
Lin described Monday's
turnout as "moderate."
"We sold a lot of books, but
most people had to check out the
Bookstore prices. We only ac
cept cash or check, and most
didn't have cash or check handy.
They might come back tomor
row."
Organizers hope the popular
ity of the service grows in com
ing days.
"We expect to sell the majori
ty of our books, if not all, by the
end of the week," Lin said.
"Over the next couple of days, as
word of mouth travels, we'll sell
more."
If the fledgling book service is
successful, the organizers have
bigger plans for the future.
"Our volume is still pretty

small," Lin said. "The small
profit that we're making is going
straight into buying more books.
We'll be buying books again at
the end of this quarter during fi
nals week again. Also, we have
definitely heard from students
that they would like if we bought
and sold efferent kinds of text
books."
In response to that interest,
Lin said, the ASSU plans on
buying a wider variety of books
in the future, including language
books. Eventually, he would
like to see a permanent facility
for the ASSU Book Service to
call home.
In addition to straightforward
transactions, the volunteers at
the booth will take down contact
information of students looking
to sell their textbooks. If the ser
vice runs out of one of the text
books it offers, it will seek to
match buyers and sellers in a
transaction free of middlemen.
