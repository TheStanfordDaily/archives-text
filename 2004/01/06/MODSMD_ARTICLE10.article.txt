## Old Union office could alter hours 
### 
Students who headed to Old Union
yesterday to pay their student bill
faced not only long lines, but an im
pending 5 p.m. deadline. The office of
Student Financial Services was open Mon
day, and Monday only, for those students
who wished to take care of their tuition pay
ments before incurring fines. While students
are allowed to pay by mail or in a drop-box in
Old Union, many don't trust the security of
these payment methods, or need to pay in
person so they get a receipt. And although it
is possible to pay winter quarter tuition be
fore heading home in December, few have
the cash on hand to make this a viable alter
native to paying in January. With dorms
opening only last Saturday, the one-day al
lowance for paying student bills did little to
help students who were returning to campus
the day before classes began, choosing cours

es and heading to the bookstore for class ma
terial.
We suggest that the office of Student Fi
nancial Services extend its deadline so that
students have more than one day to pay their
University bill. Not only does it ease the
stress of last-minute worries, it helps reduce
the lines and waiting time for students.
Extending the deadline to Wednesday, for
example, would be a start. Or, in the future,
opening the office for several hours on Satur
day and Sunday would consider students'
needs and give them a break.
We recognize that Student Financial Ser
vices did the best job it could given the cur
rent time pressures set by the University cal
endar. But students need more time, and we
hope that Student Financial Services can
work with senior administrators to develop a
solution more amenable to their needs.
