# Oops! Britney, don't do it again
## 
### 
She's not that innocent. Britney Spears
tied the knot on Saturday to child
hood pal Jason Allen Alexander, in a
marriage that lasted a mere 12 hours.
The couple immediately filled the papers to
have the 5 a.m. marriage annulled, reported
the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and both
called the event a hoax.
"What?" you might be asking. This space
is normally reserved for loftier issues, such as
the Office of Residential Education's crack
down on alcohol. But as the tag line for
"American Beauty" reminds us: Look closer.
Britney's short-lived marriage offers a num
ber of valuable lessons, some of which might
come in handy to students planning upcom
ing weekend getaways to Las Vegas.
First, ladies and gentleman of Stanford
University, do not drink so much alcohol that
you may risk marriage with a man you do not
want to marry. Officials from Residential
Education could not be reached for com
ment, but we are certain they support this ar
gument.
Second, do not think that the life of a
celebrity is so glamorous. If you made the
mistake of getting drunk and married a pal
(who wasn't that kind of wedding-material

pal) in Las Vegas, would you want it pub
lished in every rag from US Weekly to The
New York Times? No. Unless you at least get
a reality TV show offer (a la "The Newly
weds") out of the charade.
Finally, this editorial board is concerned
that Britney has further tarnished the repu
tation of marriage in America today. Con
fused? Think Trista and Ryan's "wedding"
and rumors that ABC paid strippers to plot a
sabotage? And "Bachelor" spinoffs? And
rings handed out like peppermints on "For
Love or Money?"
No, this is not acceptable: Marriage is an
important institution between a man and a
woman, as the Rev. Jerry Falwell would re
mind us, and Britney has done us all a disser
vice with her recent elopement in Las Vegas.
Britney Spears is a beautiful young
woman, a role model to millions of girls who
idolize the pop star yes, even more than
Hillary Duff. We know that this is a difficult
time for the young artist, in light of a recent
breakup with Justin Timberlake and a media
war with childhood friend Christina Aguil
era. But isn't Britney supposed to be
stronger than yesterday?
