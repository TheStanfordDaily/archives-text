## YOU GO GABE Investigating 'suckiness factor' 
### 
U.S. News & World Re
port's "America's
Best Colleges 2004"
ranked Princeton and
Harvard as the two best post
secondary institutions in the
United States, trailed by Yale in
third place, MIT in fourth and
Stanford et al. in a relatively dis
tant fifth. That's the old news.
The slightly newer news is that
the public considers Stanford
the second most prestigious uni
versity in the nation, according
to a new Gallup poll.
The number one response I
used to receive when asked
about my college plans was:
"Stanford . . . where is that?
Didn't John Elway go there?"
I'll concede that the general
population doesn't exactly have
its fingers on the pulse of the
university community. Howev
er, it's a blessing that public
opinion hasn't been swayed by
rankings based on a set of arbi
trary and volatile criteria.
If you think this column
sounds like a flashback to
Patrick Mattimore's piece ("The
problems with college rankings
in magazines," Nov. 21) de
nouncing college guidebooks
and surveys, keep reading. The
books do an admirable job of
collecting a balance of hard data
and student, opinions, and can
serve as a valuable resource for
any college-bound student seek
ing qualitative comparisons in a
sea of conflicting information.
The Princeton Review and The
Fiske College Guide both
helped me narrow down my op
tions to a manageable group of
several potential universities,

and I'm confident that the statis
tics and student interviews
therein assisted me in my search.
Unfortunately, the very no
tion of a numerical ranking im-

plies that every
one's college
choices can be
boiled down to
the same fac
tors, which in
clude things like
"financial re
sources" and
"alumni giv
ing." But where
can I find the

category, "percentage of gradu
ates able to find jobs"?, or,
"number of dorms with tabletop
soccer"? Granted, not everyone
makes Foosball a part of their
college selection process, but
that's exactly the point: No sin
gle set of criteria will apply to
everyone.
To illustrate the argument
further, let's compare this with
another flawed ranking system,
the "search engine suckiness
ratio." Calculating Stanford's
ratio is simple: Get onto Google,
divide the number of pages that
match the search "Stanford
sucks" by the number that match
"Stanford rocks," and you have
an "objective" measure of true
public opinion. Of U.S. News'
top 10 schools, Penn wins out
with a ratio of 1.0, Harvard
drops to sixth with 8.35 and
Stanford is still in fifth with 4.38
(thanks to an outspoken UC-
Berkeley Web community).
Duke brings up the rear with a
pitiable 20.65, and the absence
of a single Web site stating

"Washington University rocks"
gives WU an undefined ratio (4 /
0), implying a bastion of infinite
suckiness.
Critics of the "suckiness
ratio" argue that the system is
biased and generally worthless
and they're basically right.
After all, it includes the opin
ions of people from Cal, not to
mention many others who may
or may not be looking for the
same qualities in a college as you
are. Sound familiar? Whether
you're reading U.S. News or
Time, trying to pick a university
based on numbers alone is like
trying to determine the attrac
tiveness of a blind date based on
a datasheet of his facial topogra
phy.
"I knew kids in high school
who would base their entire col
lege search on these rankings,
without even checking out the
schools," said freshman Eric
Freeman. "I told them to actual
ly visit, but they wouldn't listen
to me. Now they're all bow-tie
wearing, East Coast smart
asses."
So the next time a high-eye
browed Harvard man smugly as
serts Stanford's inferiority, re
member that not all ranking
scales are created equal. After
all, there's one scale where Stan
ford always comes out number
one . . . the Richter scale.
