## Unwrapping Bush's Iraqi and Libyan Successes 
### KEYA JAYARAM 
The past month in international
affairs has brought good tidings for
the holiday season.
Saddam Hussein, having eluded
capture for months, is now safely de
tained; and Libya, on the brink of be
coming a nuclear power, has volun
tarily renounced its weapons pro
gram.
It would seem (and has been re
peatedly stated) that these two fa
vorable developments constitute a
flying-colors success of President
Bush's declared "war on terror," and
that the world is now a safer place for
all people, especially Americans.
Why, then, has the national threat
level been raised to indicate the
highest degree of potential threat to
America since Sept. 11? Why, in the
wake of these supposed national se
curity triumphs, are we no safer from
terrorism today than we were that
fateful morning?
Recall Sept. 12, 2001 and the
weeks immediately following the
tragic terrorist attacks. News ana
lysts, government officials and
academics alike acknowledged
that these attacks produced a fun
damental change to the interna
tional system and that traditional
thinking must transform to accom
modate that change. We now lived
in a "new, new world order," a
world in which our principal en

gagement would occur not with
states, but instead with suprana
tional, yet subversive, non-state
organizations.
In failing to incorporate this new
understanding into its foreign policy,
the Bush administration has failed to
adequately protect America from
the threat of terrorism.
Terrorist groups are different
from states because they are not vul
nerable to the same defense mecha
nisms.
For example, the United States'
Cold War strategy rested on deter
rence; that is, amassing a more pow
erful nuclear arsenal than that of our
adversary to dissuade his military of
fensive for fear of our overwhelming
retaliation.
Critical to deterrence is the threat
of retribution; without it there is no
enforcement component and the
strategy dissolves. It is here that
states prove weak and terrorists,
unassailable.
A state-sponsored attack can be
effortlessly traced and therefore eas
ily answered. A terrorist attack, on
the other hand, comes with no return
address. The knowledge, materials
and planning for the attack origi
nates from a network of several
sources.
Thus, while the aftermath of Sept.
11 did see retaliation on
Afghanistan, even a total oblitera
tion of that country could not suc

cessfully dissolve A 1 Qaeda.
This information is not new
knowledge, but it is important to re
state it. Removing Iraq's dictator un
doubtedly improves the safety of the
Iraqi people, and disposing of
Libya's nuclear program eliminates
the potential for the use or prolifera
tion of these weapons.
However, these events also show
that while the United States can em
ploy both military and diplomatic
tools to achieve foreign policy goals
with regard to states, we have not yet
demonstrated that ability with re
gard to terrorist organizations.
I need not point out that today
Osama bin Laden still roams freely;
however, to depend on his capture as
the solution to international terror
ism would only further emphasize
the pressing need for a strategic shift
in national security.
As Americans celebrate the New
Year, and as the Bush administra
tion rings it in with the joy of its for
eign policy accomplishments, we
cannot afford to allow satisfaction to
convert to complacence. The in
creasing terrorist alert levels indi
cate that we must reevaluate and re
form our solution strategy.
