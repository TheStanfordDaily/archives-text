## Junior Gordon leaves early for NFL Draft 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Junior defensive tackle Amon Gordon has declared for the NFL draft, forgoing his final year of eligibility.
The 6-foot-3,285-pound defensive tackle started all 11 games for Stanford in 2003 and led Cardinal defensive line
men with 33 tackles. He also had seven tackles for loss, four pass deflections, two sacks, one fumble recovery and one
blocked kick.
At least four sources close to Gordon have told The Stanford Daily that he wanted to leave early for mostly fi
nancial reasons: Gordon has a daughter in Seattle he would like to be able to support monetarily as soon as possible.
Thus, neither displeasure over the last two poor seasons in which Stanford went 6-16 nor differences with
Stanford head coach Buddy Teevens were primary driving forces behind Gordon's decision, they said.
Gordon redshirted as a freshman and was a reserve the next year before becoming a full-time starter in 2002 and
2003.
"The coaching staff at Stanford did a great job these past four years preparing me for the NFL," Gordon said in a
press release. "I feel that I am ready to test my skills and the challenges of the National Football League."
Gordon arrived at Stanford as one of the most highly sought-after high school players in the nation. He has played
inside linebacker, defensive end and special teams, among other positions, while at Stanford.
"Amon has been a valued member of the Stanford football family the past four years," Teevens said. "We wish
him well in his pursuit of an NFL career."
The NFL draft will be held April 24 and 25 in New York City.
