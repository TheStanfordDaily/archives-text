Baseball ranked
No. 6 by Baseball America

The Stanford baseball team, which
made its school-record fifth straight
College World Series appearance last
season, was ranked No. 6 in Baseball
America's Preseason Poll released yes
terday. Coach Mark Marquess' squad
was also ranked No. 6 in Collegiate
Baseball's preseason rankings. In addi
tion, senior Sam Fuld, junior Danny
Putnam and sophomore first baseman
John Mayberry, Jr. were named to
Baseball America's Preseason College
All-America team.
Fuld, a two-time Ail-American
and three-time All-Pac-10 selection,
enters the 2004 season with a .350
career batting average and 288 hits,
including a Stanford record 110 in
his sophomore season. The center
fielder opted to return for his senior
season after being drafted in the
24th round of the MLB First-Year
Player Draft, is a major reason the
Cardinal has advanced to the Col
lege World Series title game the past
two years.

dazzling defensive plays in left field last
season, enjoyed equal success at the
plate, hitting .348 with 16 homeruns

and 66 RBI. The native had five
homers and 21 RBI in the postseason
and was named to the all-CWS team.

last year, he hit .299 with four home
runs and 33 RBI.
