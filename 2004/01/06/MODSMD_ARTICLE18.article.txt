# Wildcats' Olson notches 700th win against Sun Devils
## 
### JUSTIN ST. GERMAIN ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT (U. ARIZONA 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz. By the end
of Arizona's 93-74 road win over rival Ari
zona State, even Lute Olson was calling score
board on the home fans.
Fed up with the ASU student section's
profanity, UA's Hall of Fame coach stood up,
walked down the Wells Fargo Arena sideline
and reminded the Sun Devil faithful of his
team's 26-point lead with just over three min
utes remaining by pointing to the scoreboard.
"They deserved that and more," he said
after notching his 700 th career win to join only
three other active coaches in accomplishing

the feat.
"I've put up with learning all kinds of words
from [ASU fans] for years, and I thought,
'You probably should learn to keep your
mouth closed when you're down 30-some
thing.'"
If the ASU fans had taken his advice, they
would have been quiet for most of the second
half. The No. 4 Wildcats (9-1, 1-0 Pacific-10
Conference) took a 16-point halftime advan
tage and ran away with their Pac-10 opener,
led by the play of junior Salim Stoudamire.
Stoudamire scored 14 of his 26 points after
halftime, rebounding from a scoreless outing
against Louisiana-Lafayette to hit all four of
his second-half 3-point attempts and 6-of-9

treys in the game. Midway through the second
half, the junior guard scored 11 consecutive
points for the Wildcats, effectively burying
the Sun Devils (6-4,0-1) and igniting the red
clad fans sitting in the rafters.
"[The UA fans] were saying some funny
stuff," junior Charming Frye said. "Our fans
are awesome. They came out here and sup
ported us, and even though they're up in the
nosebleeds, they're screaming their lungs off."
One of the choicer chants emanating from
the Arizona faithful "This is our house"
could have been the Wildcats' first-half
motto.
The UA grabbed a 7-2 lead to open the
game and shot 60 percent in the first half. Frye

scored 13 first-half points, many coming in a
late 10-0 run, after which the Sun Devils never
threatened.
Frye finished the game with 17 points and
seven boards while limiting his Preseason All-
American counterpart, Ike Diogu, to 18
points on 5-of-17 shooting.
"I thought [Frye] was the best big man on
the court," Olson said.
Stoudamire led all scorers with 26. In all, five
Wildcats scored in double figures.
"Shooting is about confidence," Olson
said. "Tonight, [Stoudamire] was sure every
one he let go was going in."
The win was Arizona's 17th in its last 18
games against Arizona State. Olson improved

his coaching record to 700-240 in 31 years. In
21 years at UA, he is 508-148.
"It's been a great run in Tucson, with great
fan support," he said, adding that he doesn't
feel like he's done yet. "I feel energized. I'm in
good shape. [l'll coach] as long as I can com
municate with the kids."
ASU coach Rob Evans took a dig at the Wild
cats despite the rout, saying that his next op
ponent, Stanford, presents more of a chal
lenge.
"The team we play next is better than this
team," he said.
Arizona returns home to host the Bay Area
schools next week, beginning with California
on Thursday.
