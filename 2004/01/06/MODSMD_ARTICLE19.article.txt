# 'Love (and football-watching) Actually' for Spencer
## 
### 
Tfeel it in my fingers. I feel it in my
toes. College Football is all around me,
and so the feeling grows. It's written in

-A-the Rose Bowl, it's everywhere I
go. So if you really love College Foot
ball, c'mon and let it show..
If you haven't seen the glorious
movie "Love Actually" and summar
ily did not understand that last stanza,
then get to a theater or local Kazaa
near you and watch what your girl
friend pleaded with you to see instead
of the Rose Bowl.

But you see, it was not my girl
friend, not my fiance, not even Hot

Stuff, who not only saw the most uplifting
movie of the year with me, ditching the
wretched "Elf" for Hugh Grant and his ro
mantic hijinx, but also curled up on the couch
with me as we watched the Rose Bowl. No, it

wasn't just any girl, it was the love of my life.
Thanks to casually windswept brown hair,
impossibly bright eyes and a smile that could
melt Lambeau Field, this woman will hence
forth be known as Sloan, a la Ferris Bueller.

(P.S. This is when my editor usually puts
in a wisecrack like, "Oooh, look at Spencer
try and work his game through the paper.

Hitting on women in .his column.
Shameless.")
My editor's jealousy of me finding
true love aside, this break I was able
to visit Sloan in L.A. for a week. So
there I was, bombing through L.A.,
schmoozing with the stars, buying as
many Von Dutch hats as I could put
my hands on and showing off a water
polo level of indifference to "the lit-

tie people." For the first time in my
life, I felt like a star.

But of course, L.A. wasn't all glamour
and glitz this break, it was also filled with
Wolverines, Trojans and Roses which is
like a standard night on my futon (Bada-
Boom).

But literally, the place was crawling with
Michigan fans, whose utter devotion I was
touched by. As Sloan and I walked down
Venice Beach, scores of Blue fans showed
their pride through hats, sweatshirts, T-shirts

and face paint. Even Sloan, whose lack of in
terest in sports rivals that of Friday columnist
Julie Ruvolo, began noticing the trend.
Unfortunately for Michigan, this was not
the only trend that Sloan was able to pick up
on. She also noted that USC was a much,
much better football team.
And don't start by thinking that this
Michigan team was a pushover, a huge drop
off from the top three teams of USC,
LSU,and Oklahoma. This was a Michigan
team that beat Ohio State, that embarrassed
Notre Dame and that showed great mental
strength in their comeback win against Min
nesota, unlike the Sooners, who folded like
tissue paper against Kansas State.
But USC was dominant. Showing superi
or talent, ability and strategy on all sides of
the ball, USC played a near flawless game
before easing up in the fourth quarter with
the game in hand. The defense was solid,
pressuring John Navarre repeatedly, sacking
him nine times. I don't know what was more
incredible, the Michigan offensive line just
not giving a crap about the corner blitz, Chris

Perry's general uselessness in blocking it, or
watching each Michigan drive gain steam,
just to face a 2nd and 22 after a Navarre sack.
Now, who should be No. 1 in the nation?
Well, there have been scores of columns
written about this already, so I'm not going
to trot out the cliched response of the Soon
ers choking, and USC flat out dominating all
opponents but for one close fluke loss.
So let me just explain this BCS problem.
The major problem with the BCS, other than
it not being a playoff system, is just a perva
sive distrust of sports writers. Not only is the
sportswriters' crowned champion unofficial,
but there is this ludicrous "quality-win" cate
gory. Awarding an extra bonus to a team's
BCS rating if it beats a top-10 opponent is ba
sically saying that sports writers don't grant
those teams enough of a boost in their polls
as it is. So instead, they are rewarded doubly
so for beating a team that they most likely
had little say in scheduling. Why not just let
the merit of the win stand alone, as it is al
ready helping the victor's strength of sched
ule regardless? Why penalize USC twice for

having a soft Pac-10 schedule, on the initial
strength of schedule scale, but now as well on
this quality win thing. Absurd.
So in response, Sloan and I ask, what
gives? Why is there this distrust? Why are
there these silly bonuses? I mean, we all
saw the Rose Bowl, and it's damn near ob
vious that one team was truly the National
Champion. Unless of course you ask
Sloan, whose initial response to what she
thought of the Rose Bowl was, "I think the
Rose Bowl needs to be revamped, it's kind
of an ugly place. I have been watching
UCLA football since I was a wee-little
chap (Spencer's note: "chap"? What the
hell?), I of course never really paid atten
tion, but. .
Well, there is always next year.

woman who forgives you for enjoying a Hugh

ready helping the victor's strength of sched
ule regardless? Why penalize USC twice for

having a soft Pac-10 schedule, on the initial
strength of schedule scale, but now as well on
this quality win thing. Absurd.
So in response, Sloan and I ask, what
gives? Why is there this distrust? Why are
there these silly bonuses? I mean, we all
saw the Rose Bowl, and it's damn near ob
vious that one team was truly the National
Champion. Unless of course you ask
Sloan, whose initial response to what she
thought of the Rose Bowl was, "I think the
Rose Bowl needs to be revamped, it's kind
of an ugly place. I have been watching
UCLA football since I was a wee-little
chap (Spencer's note: "chap"? What the
hell?), I of course never really paid atten
tion, but. .
Well, there is always next year.

Tfeel it in my fingers. I feel it in my
toes. College Football is all around me,
and so the feeling grows. It's written in

-A-the Rose Bowl, it's everywhere I
go. So if you really love College Foot
ball, c'mon and let it show..
If you haven't seen the glorious
movie "Love Actually" and summar
ily did not understand that last stanza,
then get to a theater or local Kazaa
near you and watch what your girl
friend pleaded with you to see instead
of the Rose Bowl.

But you see, it was not my girl
friend, not my fiance, not even Hot

Stuff, who not only saw the most uplifting
movie of the year with me, ditching the
wretched "Elf" for Hugh Grant and his ro
mantic hijinx, but also curled up on the couch
with me as we watched the Rose Bowl. No, it

wasn't just any girl, it was the love of my life.
Thanks to casually windswept brown hair,
impossibly bright eyes and a smile that could
melt Lambeau Field, this woman will hence
forth be known as Sloan, a la Ferris Bueller.

(P.S. This is when my editor usually puts
in a wisecrack like, "Oooh, look at Spencer
try and work his game through the paper.

Hitting on women in .his column.
Shameless.")
My editor's jealousy of me finding
true love aside, this break I was able
to visit Sloan in L.A. for a week. So
there I was, bombing through L.A.,
schmoozing with the stars, buying as
many Von Dutch hats as I could put
my hands on and showing off a water
polo level of indifference to "the lit-

tie people." For the first time in my
life, I felt like a star.

But of course, L.A. wasn't all glamour
and glitz this break, it was also filled with
Wolverines, Trojans and Roses which is
like a standard night on my futon (Bada-
Boom).

But literally, the place was crawling with
Michigan fans, whose utter devotion I was
touched by. As Sloan and I walked down
Venice Beach, scores of Blue fans showed
their pride through hats, sweatshirts, T-shirts

and face paint. Even Sloan, whose lack of in
terest in sports rivals that of Friday columnist
Julie Ruvolo, began noticing the trend.
Unfortunately for Michigan, this was not
the only trend that Sloan was able to pick up
on. She also noted that USC was a much,
much better football team.
And don't start by thinking that this
Michigan team was a pushover, a huge drop
off from the top three teams of USC,
LSU,and Oklahoma. This was a Michigan
team that beat Ohio State, that embarrassed
Notre Dame and that showed great mental
strength in their comeback win against Min
nesota, unlike the Sooners, who folded like
tissue paper against Kansas State.
But USC was dominant. Showing superi
or talent, ability and strategy on all sides of
the ball, USC played a near flawless game
before easing up in the fourth quarter with
the game in hand. The defense was solid,
pressuring John Navarre repeatedly, sacking
him nine times. I don't know what was more
incredible, the Michigan offensive line just
not giving a crap about the corner blitz, Chris

Perry's general uselessness in blocking it, or
watching each Michigan drive gain steam,
just to face a 2nd and 22 after a Navarre sack.
Now, who should be No. 1 in the nation?
Well, there have been scores of columns
written about this already, so I'm not going
to trot out the cliched response of the Soon
ers choking, and USC flat out dominating all
opponents but for one close fluke loss.
So let me just explain this BCS problem.
The major problem with the BCS, other than
it not being a playoff system, is just a perva
sive distrust of sports writers. Not only is the
sportswriters' crowned champion unofficial,
but there is this ludicrous "quality-win" cate
gory. Awarding an extra bonus to a team's
BCS rating if it beats a top-10 opponent is ba
sically saying that sports writers don't grant
those teams enough of a boost in their polls
as it is. So instead, they are rewarded doubly
so for beating a team that they most likely
had little say in scheduling. Why not just let
the merit of the win stand alone, as it is al
ready helping the victor's strength of sched
ule regardless? Why penalize USC twice for

having a soft Pac-10 schedule, on the initial
strength of schedule scale, but now as well on
