# Course Guide updated at last
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITER 
The staff of the ASSU Online Course Guide is scrambling to re
vive its outdated Web site. The site was not updated last year, due to
mismanagement and lack of accountability by the student group that
administered it.
The Course Guide is meant to provide students with helpful in
formation about Stanford courses, by compiling student comments,
ratings and useful statistics for a wide variety of courses. It is allotted
$ll,OOO from special fees funds, with $3,000 going to the Course
Guide director and $5,000 to other staff members. Though the pro
gram has received special fee funding for several years, it has not
been updated since 2002.
But this year, the Course Guide staff is making an effort to reme
dy the situation. Student workers had entered 40 percent of the data
necessary for a completed Course Guide as of Sunday night.
"In terms of all of the work that needs to be completed, the only
thing we have left is manually entering all of the comments into our
database," said junior Avichal Garg, the financial manager of the
project. "All of the sorting, summarizing and picking of representa
tive comments has been completed."
Garg attributes the site's outdated state to issues that arose in last
year's administration of the guide.
"There's a big backlog in comments because, for whatever reason,


MARGO THOMA/The Stanford Daily
last year's management didn't take
an active role in updating," said
Garg. "They chose not to do a
large portion of the updating, so
we have comments as far back as
2002 that just sat around last year."
According to the previous
Course Guide director, Curtis
Spencer, Class of 2003, the only
updates that occurred last year
were comments for tech courses,
due to the team's strong connec
tion with the Tau Beta Pi Engi
neering Honor Society, which as
sisted the team with the data.
Spencer also cited managerial and
technical problems as contributing
factors.
"Three information editors
packed their bags and didn't do
anything," Spencer said. "There
are still two or three boxes of com
ments that are missing from them.
Everything stopped in the spring,
and they ceased to care. Axess also
changed its system, and it left us
scrambling to change our system
and format."
Although 800 comments were
entered on Sunday night, the team
has received complaints about the
lack of comments for many social
science and humanities courses.
Garg insists that this problem
stems from a shortage in student
comments in course evaluations.
"On average, we receive far
fewer student comments in the
'fuzzy' departments than we do in
the 'techie' departments," Garg
said. "We may only have five or
fewer'comments for a given politi
cal science class. Based on one or
two comments, we cannot justify
summarizing a class. Thus, there
are entire classes that have never
had any comments in the Guide.
There is just not enough student
input for these classes for us to be
able to enter anything."
The group gets these comments
from the registrar about three
weeks into the following quarter.

There are five data entry personnel
who are paid $l2 to $l3 an hour to
sort, read, summarize and pick the
comments for the Web site.
"There isn't really any pattern
to what has and has not been up
dated on the site," Garg said. "It
comes down to which employees
have entered their data after sort
ing and summarizing it. Whichever
stacks of classes these individuals
were assigned are the ones that are
updated."
The team is aiming to finish up
dating the guide by the end of the
quarter, with the addition of a re
designed Web site and improved
user interface. The team will also
spend $2,000 on an advertising
campaign to inform the Stanford
community when the guide is com
pletely updated.
"We know that the guide is a
valuable service to students, and
we will do whatever it takes to
make sure it gets updated," said ju
nior Josh Shipp, the ASSU Senate
chair. "There needs to be more ac
countability and institutionaliza
tion."
The Course Guide is an ASSU
service project, meaning it is now
an independent project run by its
own student staff, like the Speak
ers Bureau and Stanford Concert
Network. The lack of communica
tion between the executive branch
and the Course Guide team is illus
trated by the fact that Shipp has
been unable to contact the Guide
director this year. He put a hold on
the Course Guide account on Mon
day until he could speak to the
staff. The full $ll,OOO is still in the
account.
"I tried to use the guide last year
to figure out which professors
would be best, but in most cases,
the classes I was looking for didn't
have listings," said sophomore
Lauren Schneider. "However, I
just checked out the guide again
for scheduling this quarter's class
es and it seems to be easier to nav
igate with more helpful comments
listed, so I guess they're working
towards improving the system to
be more useful to students."

Garg. "They chose not to do a
large portion of the updating, so
we have comments as far back as
2002 that just sat around last year."
According to the previous
Course Guide director, Curtis
Spencer, Class of 2003, the only
updates that occurred last year
were comments for tech courses,
due to the team's strong connec
tion with the Tau Beta Pi Engi
neering Honor Society, which as
sisted the team with the data.
Spencer also cited managerial and
technical problems as contributing
factors.
"Three information editors
packed their bags and didn't do
anything," Spencer said. "There
are still two or three boxes of com
ments that are missing from them.
Everything stopped in the spring,
and they ceased to care. Axess also
changed its system, and it left us
scrambling to change our system
and format."
Although 800 comments were
entered on Sunday night, the team
has received complaints about the
lack of comments for many social
science and humanities courses.
Garg insists that this problem
stems from a shortage in student
comments in course evaluations.
"On average, we receive far
fewer student comments in the
'fuzzy' departments than we do in
the 'techie' departments," Garg
said. "We may only have five or
fewer'comments for a given politi
cal science class. Based on one or
two comments, we cannot justify
summarizing a class. Thus, there
are entire classes that have never
had any comments in the Guide.
There is just not enough student
input for these classes for us to be
able to enter anything."
The group gets these comments
from the registrar about three
weeks into the following quarter.

There are five data entry personnel
who are paid $l2 to $l3 an hour to
sort, read, summarize and pick the
comments for the Web site.
"There isn't really any pattern
to what has and has not been up
dated on the site," Garg said. "It
comes down to which employees
have entered their data after sort
ing and summarizing it. Whichever
stacks of classes these individuals
were assigned are the ones that are
updated."
The team is aiming to finish up
dating the guide by the end of the
quarter, with the addition of a re
designed Web site and improved
user interface. The team will also
spend $2,000 on an advertising
campaign to inform the Stanford
community when the guide is com
pletely updated.
"We know that the guide is a
valuable service to students, and
we will do whatever it takes to
make sure it gets updated," said ju
nior Josh Shipp, the ASSU Senate
chair. "There needs to be more ac
countability and institutionaliza
tion."
The Course Guide is an ASSU
service project, meaning it is now
an independent project run by its
own student staff, like the Speak
ers Bureau and Stanford Concert
Network. The lack of communica
tion between the executive branch
and the Course Guide team is illus
trated by the fact that Shipp has
been unable to contact the Guide
director this year. He put a hold on
the Course Guide account on Mon
day until he could speak to the
staff. The full $ll,OOO is still in the
account.
"I tried to use the guide last year
to figure out which professors
would be best, but in most cases,
the classes I was looking for didn't
have listings," said sophomore
Lauren Schneider. "However, I
just checked out the guide again
for scheduling this quarter's class
es and it seems to be easier to nav
igate with more helpful comments
listed, so I guess they're working
towards improving the system to
be more useful to students."
The staff of the ASSU Online Course Guide is scrambling to re
vive its outdated Web site. The site was not updated last year, due to
mismanagement and lack of accountability by the student group that
administered it.
The Course Guide is meant to provide students with helpful in
formation about Stanford courses, by compiling student comments,
ratings and useful statistics for a wide variety of courses. It is allotted
$ll,OOO from special fees funds, with $3,000 going to the Course
Guide director and $5,000 to other staff members. Though the pro
gram has received special fee funding for several years, it has not
been updated since 2002.
But this year, the Course Guide staff is making an effort to reme
dy the situation. Student workers had entered 40 percent of the data
necessary for a completed Course Guide as of Sunday night.
"In terms of all of the work that needs to be completed, the only
thing we have left is manually entering all of the comments into our
database," said junior Avichal Garg, the financial manager of the
project. "All of the sorting, summarizing and picking of representa
tive comments has been completed."
Garg attributes the site's outdated state to issues that arose in last
year's administration of the guide.
"There's a big backlog in comments because, for whatever reason,
