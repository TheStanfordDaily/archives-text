# Arizona's Frye outshines Diogu in desert duel
## 
### SHANE DALE ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT (U. ARIZONA 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz. Score
round one in the battle of the Arizona-Ari
zona State big men for the Wildcats' Chan
ning Frye.
The 6-foot-11, 248-pound UA center did
pretty much whatever he wanted in the paint
against his counterpart, 6-foot-8, 250-pound
forward/center Ike Diogu, during the 93-74
romp over the Sun Devils.
"[Diogu's] just a good player and I was
just ready to play," Frye said. "I think the
way they played defense, it was just a good
one-on-one matchup, and we've been play

ing against zones and things like that, so it
was a good change."
While Diogu was missing shots left and
right, his teammates were nowhere to be
found on the glass.
The Pacific-10 Conference leader in
points per game, Diogu did his usual damage
against Arizona with 18 points, 11 rebounds
and five blocks. But no other Sun Devil
blocked a shot or grabbed more than three
boards.
And despite the gaudy-looking numbers,
Frye and the Wildcats limited Diogu to 5-of-17
shooting (29 percent) from the floor, including
l-of-5 in the second half. Diogu came into the
game shooting 57.5 percent this season.

"Defensively, we accomplished what we
wanted, which was to keep it out of Ike's
hands as much as we could," said UA head
coach Lute Olson.
"They had three guys on me every single
time, so that made it really tough to get the
ball in the post," Diogu said. "Today my shot
wasn't there. They did a good job of execut
ing their game plan."
Meanwhile, Frye, who was held to just
three field goal attempts Tuesday against
Louisiana-Lafayette, was 8-of-13 from the
floor against ASU. He scored 13 of his 17
points in the first half when he was 6-of-9
from the field.
The Wildcats outscored the Devils in the

paint 22-4 in the first half and 32-12 for the game.
Olson was critical of Frye after he
grabbed just one offensive rebound against
the Rajin' Cajuns, but had nothing but praise
for Frye after the junior center tallied a
game-high six offensive boards versus ASU.
"I thought Channing played great all the
way around," he said. "He fronted the post
and kept it really difficult [for ASU] to get
the ball in. I liked the fact that he went up
more aggressively, got banged around a little
bit and still held on to the ball."
"I thought he was the best big man on the
court, frankly," Olson added.
Frye blocked two shots and didn't commit
a turnover in 28 minutes.

UA sophomore forwards Andre Iguo
dala and Hassan Adams, who saw limited ac
tion due to early foul trouble, grabbed eight
and six rebounds in 25 and 24 minutes, re
spectively.
Even freshman forward Ivan Radenovic
came off the bench to snatch six boards, in
cluding four on the offensive end.
Arizona out-rebounded ASU 41-28 for
the game.
Olson said Arizona's 24 defensive boards
allowed the Wildcats to get open looks in
transition.
"We're quick enough up and down the
court that they're gonna have a hard time re
covering when we get the rebound," he said.
