# University rebounds from '02, posts surplus
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
The University's financial report to the Board of Trustees shows a
surplus, a marked improvement over last year's deficit, but these
numbers do not necessarily translate into any short-term changes in
budget allocation or promises of future windfalls.
Stanford's year-end financial results show an operating surplus of
$46 million for the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2003, compared to
a $l7 million deficit in the previous fiscal year.
Despite the good news, officials offer cautious optimism and at
tribute the new outlook in part to more conservative spending prac
tices.
"I'm delighted by these results and especially thankful for our em
ployees' diligent efforts to contain costs," said Provost John
Etchemendy. "At the same time, I don't feel we're completely out of
the woods and we need to continue our responsible approach to using
resources with the utmost care."
After last year's deficit, the University administration anticipated
another difficult year, resulting in a staff hiring freeze and operating
budget reductions. These efforts proved effective in moderating ex
pense growth, even though total salaries and benefits still increased
by 10 percent since last year.
Other factors that affected the strong numbers include solid in
vestment market performance in the last half of the fiscal year, suc
cessful fundraising efforts and increased research activity.
"The principal reason for this surplus was that the financial mar
kets turned around and that produced results that were not anticipat
ed," said Tim Warner, vice provost for budget and auxiliaries man
agement. "The returns through Aug. 31 were about 11 percent higher
[than expected], and a large fraction of that return came in the last
quarter."
Michael Ross, Stanford's chief investment officer, attributes the
pick-up of the University's investment performance in part to the di

versification of Stanford's portfolio. Also, Stanford invested a small
er portion in public equities than other universities.
Record levels of support from the University's donors also con
tributed to the reported surplus. The Office of Development reported
gifts totaling $486 million, making last year the second best fundrais
ing year in the University's history.
Despite these numbers, Etchemendy maintains a cautious attitude,
pointing out that two thirds of the University's reported surplus is ac
tually allocated as restricted funds. Also, Stanford uses a "smoothing
formula" to mitigate volatile market fluctuations, which limits the
amount of funds that can be used each year from the endowment.
Each year the payout a percentage of the value from the endow
ment investments is figured into the budget. The payout does not
change radically from year to year even if the investment market does,
because the value is based on averages.
Etchemendy said he was pleased that the University's endowment
had risen considerably from the previous year to $8.6 billion but
noted that it still falls short of the level it achieved three years ago.
Certain costs also continue to rise. As economic conditions took a
downturn, more students have needed financial support. Employee
and retiree health care also increased 16 percent last year, while stu
dent financial aid went up 9 percent.
Randy Livingston, vice president for business affairs and chief fi
nancial officer, warned that despite the improvement in operating re
sults, many financial challenges remain in the future, including the an
ticipated flattening of federal research funding, highly volatile finan
cial markets and costs associated with the opening of new facilities.
But Warner said the healthier economy made him feel more opti
mistic about the current year and for the planning process for the 2005
fiscal year.
"The good news in all this is that it helps in terms of looking ahead
to fiscal year 2005," he said. "We're also monitoring the situation in
fiscal year 2004. Based on the returns from the end of the year, it's
probably looking a bit better."
