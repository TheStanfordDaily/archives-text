## Schwarzenegger cuts UC funding 
### GAELLE FAURE THE GUARDIAN 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA, Calif.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger an
nounced Dec. 18 the implementa
tion of $l5O million midyear state
budget cuts, including a $29.9 mil
lion reduction to the University of
California system's budget, in order
to make scheduled payments to local
governments in California.
University officials had not ex
pected funds to stop flowing until
after the details of the governor's
full budget proposal were disclosed
and had received legislative ap
proval. The budget proposal is due
Jan. 10.
However, university officials
have indicated that they will contin
ue all operations at current levels
until the full budget is revealed.
"We're in a little bit of a limbo pe
riod because the university will not
make any decisions until the full
state budget is proposed," UC
spokesperson Abby Lunardini said.
"We're not going to do anything
until we have a bigger picture, and
right now we're a bit in the dark as
well as to what that's going to look
like."

The university is bracing for $15.7
million in unallocated cuts, $12.2
million in reductions to kinder
garten through 12th grade outreach
programs and $2 million in cuts to
the Institute for Labor and Employ
ment.
The university's current total
state-funded operating budget is
about $2.9 billion.
Outreach programs, funding for
which was been cut by 50 percent
last year, could face elimination.
"The governor has proposed
spending cuts across the board, and
the goal of those reductions was to
save the core function of each pro
gram," said Vince Sollitto, a
spokesperson for the governor. "In
higher education that is teaching
Californians, so the proposals were
done so that the cuts had the least
impact on classroom teaching."
In his Dec. 18 announcement,
Schwarzenegger cited the 2003 Bud
get Act as authorizing him to redi
rect up to 5 percent of funding for
state agencies to other purposes, giv
ing him the right to implement the
proposed midyear cuts effective of
that date.
"It's a little bit of a gray area,"
Lunardini said. "Technically it's al

lowed, but some people in [the capi
tal] are saying different things."
Schwarzenegger has also issued
executive orders asking all state
agencies, including the California
State University and UC systems, to
freeze both spending and hiring "to
a level that will not interfere with
their educational mission." UC
President Robert C. Dynes issued a
systemwide statement asking the
various campuses to comply with the
orders.
Lunardini said although the im
plications of these orders are not yet
clear, the hiring freeze would likely
affect staff, not faculty.
Just days before the governor's
Dec. 18 announcement, UC student
regent Matt Murray, along with the
student trustees from the California
State University and the community
college systems, went to Sacramen
to, Calif., on Dec. 15 to hand-deliver
a letter addressed to Schwarzeneg
ger.
The letter called upon the gover
nor to consider detrimental effects
that cuts could have on California's
higher-education systems.
"We fear that the combination of
large student fee increases, massive
reductions and possible elimination

of UC and CSU outreach funding,
and extreme restrictions on student
enrollments in all three segments
could dramatically transform our
public higher education system from
a broadly accessible and vital re
source serving the entire state into
an exclusive yet mediocre set of in
stitutions," the letter read.
Murray and the other trustees
were received by a member of the
governor's education staff.
"I'm optimistic that the governor
read it, though he's got a lot on his
plate," Murray said. "Our letter had
two big points. First, higher educa
tion is important to California's
economy, and the state's economy is
definitely on his mind. Second, all
segments of public education are in
terconnected, and we hope when he
says he supports education he means
all of it."
Murray said he doesn't expect
the full budget proposal to be "very
pleasant."
"I think the university is going to be
faced with a lot of really difficult de
cisions," he said, "and it will be cru
cial for everybody students, facul
ty, staff to make our voices heard in
Sacramento, where the big decisions
will be made."

proval. The budget proposal is due
Jan. 10.
However, university officials
have indicated that they will contin
ue all operations at current levels
until the full budget is revealed.
"We're in a little bit of a limbo pe
riod because the university will not
make any decisions until the full
state budget is proposed," UC
spokesperson Abby Lunardini said.
"We're not going to do anything
until we have a bigger picture, and
right now we're a bit in the dark as
well as to what that's going to look
like."

The university is bracing for $15.7
million in unallocated cuts, $12.2
million in reductions to kinder
garten through 12th grade outreach
programs and $2 million in cuts to
the Institute for Labor and Employ
ment.
The university's current total
state-funded operating budget is
about $2.9 billion.
Outreach programs, funding for
which was been cut by 50 percent
last year, could face elimination.
"The governor has proposed
spending cuts across the board, and
the goal of those reductions was to
save the core function of each pro
gram," said Vince Sollitto, a
spokesperson for the governor. "In
higher education that is teaching
Californians, so the proposals were
done so that the cuts had the least
impact on classroom teaching."
In his Dec. 18 announcement,
Schwarzenegger cited the 2003 Bud
get Act as authorizing him to redi
rect up to 5 percent of funding for
state agencies to other purposes, giv
ing him the right to implement the
proposed midyear cuts effective of
that date.
"It's a little bit of a gray area,"
Lunardini said. "Technically it's al

lowed, but some people in [the capi
tal] are saying different things."
Schwarzenegger has also issued
executive orders asking all state
agencies, including the California
State University and UC systems, to
freeze both spending and hiring "to
a level that will not interfere with
their educational mission." UC
President Robert C. Dynes issued a
systemwide statement asking the
various campuses to comply with the
orders.
Lunardini said although the im
plications of these orders are not yet
clear, the hiring freeze would likely
affect staff, not faculty.
Just days before the governor's
Dec. 18 announcement, UC student
regent Matt Murray, along with the
student trustees from the California
State University and the community
college systems, went to Sacramen
to, Calif., on Dec. 15 to hand-deliver
a letter addressed to Schwarzeneg
ger.
The letter called upon the gover
nor to consider detrimental effects
that cuts could have on California's
higher-education systems.
"We fear that the combination of
large student fee increases, massive
reductions and possible elimination

of UC and CSU outreach funding,
and extreme restrictions on student
enrollments in all three segments
could dramatically transform our
public higher education system from
a broadly accessible and vital re
source serving the entire state into
an exclusive yet mediocre set of in
stitutions," the letter read.
Murray and the other trustees
were received by a member of the
governor's education staff.
"I'm optimistic that the governor
read it, though he's got a lot on his
plate," Murray said. "Our letter had
two big points. First, higher educa
tion is important to California's
economy, and the state's economy is
definitely on his mind. Second, all
segments of public education are in
terconnected, and we hope when he
says he supports education he means
all of it."
Murray said he doesn't expect
the full budget proposal to be "very
pleasant."
"I think the university is going to be
faced with a lot of really difficult de
cisions," he said, "and it will be cru
cial for everybody students, facul
ty, staff to make our voices heard in
Sacramento, where the big decisions
will be made."
