# U. Oregon suffers snow-related outages
## 
### JARED PABEN OREGON DAILY EMERALD 
(U-WIRE) EUGENE, Ore.
Nearly 12 inches of snow fell on Eu
gene, Ore., last week, snapping tree
limbs, damaging power lines and
knocking out electricity for thou
sands of area residents, according to a
press release from the Eugene Water
and Electric Board.
Lance Robertson, spokesman for
EWEB, said most outages were con
centrated in the south hills and north
River Road areas, adding that a total
of 3,000 EWEB customers were
without power.
In the campus area, residents of
H.P. Barnhart Hall and Riley Hall
reported a brownout a power re
duction that cut out heat, hot water
and most electronic appliances at
approximately 8 a.m. Thursday,
said Mike Eyster, director of Uni
versity Housing. Only the lights
worked during the brownout.
Crews restored full power to the
building at midnight and by 10 a.m.
the next morning, the hot water was
also restored.
"I'm sure that some people were
cold," Eyster said, adding that there

were only 15 residents in Barnhart
Hall and eight in Riley Hall at the
time of the outages. "About all we
can do in a case like that is provide
blankets to people who request them.
To my knowledge, nobody requested
any blankets. We did a lot better than
some of the houses in Eugene."
Robertson explained that lines
damaged by falling limbs take longer
to repair than transformers damaged
by lightning, a more common cause
of outages in Eugene.
Every year there are typically out
ages affecting 1,000 to 3,000 EWEB
customers. Lightning is the most
common cause of the outages. The
last "huge" outage occurred during a
storm in February 2002, when 30,000
customers were without power for up
to six days, Robertson said.
"Whenever a tree or big limb falls
across a power line it not only is dan
gerous, but it can take a long time to
repair," he said.
According to the press release, all
major power restorations were com
pleted Saturday night.
"We're hoping the weather holds
[while we restore power]," Robert
son said. "If we get another storm, we
could be going the other way."
