Computer science graduate stu
dent Luke Biewald has snapped up
the top $lO,OOO prize in the Califor
nia Institute of Technology Turing
Tournament, a contest based on
mathematician Alan Turing's origi
nal theories on artificial intelligence
and held by a group of Caltech
economists. Biewald won by writing
a program that detects the differ
ence between human and non
human responses in game theory
type games.
"I thought I had a good entry,
but I thought that there would prob
ably be better ones," Biewald said.
Biewald started the project after
taking a game theory class with
Economics Prof. Jon Levin and fin
ished writing the program last
spring.
Levin, who advised Biewald on
the project, explained, "Turing pro
posed the following sort of experi
ment. A questioner would ask ques
tions of two subjects, one a human
and one a computer, without know
ing which was which. The question
er would then have to identify the
computer. If the computer could
trick the questioner into guessing
wrong, that would show that the
computer could 'think.' "
Competitors in the Caltech
contest were asked to submit "em
ulators," programs that played the
games, or "detectors," which
looked at game data to figure out
whether players were human or
computer. The emulators, along
with human participants, then
played simple matrix games such
as the Prisoner's Dilemma, in
which two individuals, or "prison
ers," receive a certain sentence if
they both confess to a crime, a
lessened individual sentence for
confessing while the other re
mains silent, or receiving a joint
lessened sentence if they collude
by both remaining silent. Howev
er, they cannot communicate be

forehand to choose a strategy.
Biewald noticed that when two
humans play this game, if one ap
pears to get a much higher payoff,
the other adjusts his behavior to
equal the score. This results in simi
lar total payoffs.
"On the other hand," explained
Levin, "sometimes when computers
play against each other, one of the
programs really beats the other pro
gram thoroughly."
Biewald's program looked at
how close the total payoffs were.
When the program found unequal
looking payoffs, it tagged them as
computers.
"What was particularly neat
about his idea was that he only
looked at the total of each player's
score rather than looking at what
they did in every play of the game.
So his program applied easily
without regard to exactly what
game was being played," said
Levin. "The other neat thing, of
course, is that he used such a sim
ple observation about people's
motivations that people don't
like to end up on the short end of
the stick, so to speak to pick out
human behavior relative to simu
lated human behavior."
Biewald believes that better ver
sions of his program could help peo
ple to understand how individuals
make decisions. He gives an exam
ple in which two people are trying to
split $l. Logically, either person
should accept any amount greater
than zero. He questions why being
offered a 90-10 split makes the sec
ond person perceive the event as
more unfair than something like a
50-50 split.
For now, Biewald is satisfied
with his win.
"I was happy to enter the contest
because it was so closely related to
my interests at the time," said
Biewald. "I think it is pretty inter
esting that we still don't really know
how to model the way people play
incredibly simple games."
