# Dining Services re-opens too late
## 
### 
Last Saturday marked the re
opening of Stanford's student
residences. Many students ex
pecting to make use of their
meal plans before Monday, however,
were disappointed when they tried to
dish up some mac and cheese and Hun
garian Goulash at their dining halls.
Three major dining halls Wilbur,
Lakeside and Ricker were not open.
These dining halls, among others, did
not re-open' until Monday for brunch,
and the new Tresidder Cafe was also
closed for the weekend.
While winter quarter did not official
ly begin until Monday, many students re
turn to campus one or two days early.
These students were left with few op
tions for brunch and dinner. Dominos
Pizza and Chinese takeout were the only
possibility for students without cars, and
those individuals with cars saw their op
tions widened to the restaurants of Palo

Alto. Neither offered an affordable sub
stitute for the meals served in dining
halls.
Perhaps Stanford Dining could be
more mindful of its customers' needs
when deciding its schedule both during
and after spring break. Stanford Dining
could also make a greater effort to pub
licize the re-opening of its facilities.
While Student Housing Services posted
such information on its Web site, Stan
ford Dining instead disseminated these
dates through flyers in individual dining
halls. Students who were not present
during the last few days of the quarter
were left in the dark about dining hall
schedules.
With a motto of, "It's all about you!"
Stanford Dining promises to provide ex
cellent food and customer service. But
for most businesses, customer service in
cludes evaluating the needs of their cus
tomers.
