Sympathy for Britney

What happened Saturday be
tween Britney and Jason, two
childhood friends, was more of a
normal, perhaps desperate, es
cape for Britney. Had she NOT
become a name outside of
Kennedale, La., what happened
between her and a guy from her
home town, both at the age of 22,
could have been the course of
her life.
But the worlds' stereotype of
what a superstar's choices should
be sunk in afterwards and torn
between the two worlds, after
both thought to make a dash to
wed, as two normal people deep
down would do, the heck with
the rest of the world, this felt
right, but then superstardom
won Saturday afternoon, as the
world, from Mom on up hit them
with their expectations. Sad real
ly, the prison escape lasted only
12 hours.
Will the annulment bring
good fortune to Britney? Doubt
it, especially after seeing the
chaos superstardom brings to
one who yearns for a normal
world.
I pity Britney. For a moment,
two people from Kennedale who
have known each other for a long
time, did something that looked
bizarre, but in reality was a dash
for trying to grab on to some
thing, a normal life, with a nor
mal old time pal for a while.

For this alum, Stanford

still shines bright

I am an alumnus who has
resided as an expatriate Ameri
can in Singapore since 1983. I
visited the Stanford campus last
November. It marked my first
visit in this millennium. My plans
to attend the 25th reunion in
2001 were marred by the events
of Sept. 11.
My brief tour included a last
minute invitation to the Big
Game, a short meeting with a
Saudi freshman who is the son of
a business acquaintance, lunch
with my former instructor Prof.
David Kennedy, a few workouts
at Roble and Tresidder gyms, a
burger and beer at Zot's, a
splurge on books and parapher
nalia at the Bookstore and the
normal reverie an old alum ex
pects during a three-hour walk
across the campus.
Pinch me. This was not a dream.
Stanford exists. The sandstone
and red tile are real although
their parameters have expand
ed since my undergrad days (as
have the number of SUVs and
the costs of parking). Prof.
Kennedy still patiently toler
ates my ignorance and gener
ously shares his time and
knowledge.
And Stanford continues to
shine bright. I would swap places
with my Saudi freshman friend in
a heartbeat but all I can do is tell
him to enjoy an experience that
will fill him up for the rest of his
life.

A different take on
college path

Columnist Gabe Recchia
takes issue with my criticism of
magazine rankings of colleges
("Investigating 'suckiness fac
tor,'" Jan.6) regarding my col
umn "The problems with college
rankings in magazines," on Nov.
21. He apparently believes the
system needs only be tweaked in
order to more fully account for a
variety of interests among high
school applicants.
It is precisely because the
columnist and his friends tune in
to those hopelessly subjective
rankings, given all their imper
fections, that the temptation to
manipulate and bribe magazine
sources looms so large. Stanford
may be number five today but
how much would it cost to bribe a
$40,000-a-year reporter for U.S.
News & World Report to ratchet
the university's rating up a cou
ple of notches next year? What is
the value of such a ratings in
crease?
Were the magazines merely
benign purveyors of information
about colleges I would agree
with the columnist that they
serve a useful purpose. As stake
holders with a vested interest
and numerous potentials for
those interests to be conflicted,
the magazines serve a far more
malignant master. The system is
not in need of a repair but of an
overhaul.
