## MINDFUL MUSINGS Life's little alarm clock 
### 
Have you ever woken
up from a deep bout of
sleep, looked around
the room and won
dered, where the hell you are?
You glance around the room in a
daze, trying to figure out if
you're still stuck in dreamland or
whether you've hit reality. It
often happens when you haven't
been in a place for a long time,
and its downright surreal. I had
such an episode recently. Only
when my eyes finally adjusted,
taking in the gleaming white
walls, still unadorned and effus
ing their cold, institutional feel
did I take a deep breath and sigh.
Yes, I'm back on campus. In
Wilbur. Damn the plight of the
unpreferred Draw year.
Yet this quarter, the campus
life seems different. Oh sure, I
feel the quintessential Stanford
spirit in the air: I almost got run
over by five crazy bikers while
trying to get to class (OK, per
haps it was partly my fault I
still have a tendency to walk on
the wrong side of the road, a
habit remnant of my stay in Aus
tralia) and the campus is still
pumping with energy and enthu
siasm, even under the freezing
cold, cloudy sky. Yes, flowing
once again into the heartbeat of
the Farm has proved to be an
easy task, and after spending
time studying abroad, starting
the quarter with a new perspec
tive makes the embarking on the
beginning of this winter quarter
simply refreshing.
Gone are the days of stressing
out over the little details in life:
Can't choose between five of the
classes you were dead set of tak
ing because they are all offered
at 11 a.m.? Is the class you were
selling your soul for simply not
offered this year? Big deal.
While your heart may be racing

with anger as you try to fine-tune
your schedule, deep inside, you

know there's so
much more to
life than those
little stresses.
An experience
abroad serves as
a kind of alarm
clock. You liter
ally wake up and
think, my time
on this planet is
limited, and I

want to get out there again and
explore our remarkable globe.
Even more important, living
in another country makes you
recognize the vast importance of
keeping up with the international
news. One of the first things you
learn when stepping out of the
United States borders is the
sharp and quick realization that
you really don't know very much
at all. I don't think you could
ever claim to really "know the
world" but that doesn't mean
you really shouldn't try to ex
pand yourself at least a little.
If you follow one New Year's
Resolution this year, let it be
this: Be informed. Within five
minutes of you at any time on this
campus you're bound to find a
computer. Get on the Internet,
and after you've satiated your cu
riosity regarding the juicy details
of Britney Spears' marriage,
click on the international news
section. Talk to people who've
gone abroad or better yet, talk
to people who were born and
raised abroad. Then, when
you're ready to begin to see the
world, you'll be on top of your
stuff and you'll be able to gain
a much better appreciation
throughout your travels.
Becoming more informed
about the international scope
isn't just for the International

Relations or Political Science
majors. Recently, a Strategic
Task Force on Education
Abroad, compiled for the Associ
ation of International Educators,
a private organization, warned
that, "America's ignorance of the
world is now a national liability,"
in reference to Sept. 11. Accord
ing to the report, "the stubborn
monolingualism and ignorance of
the world" still present in the
United States is dangerous for
our national security, but I would
argue that it is also dangerous for
our intellectual and personal de
velopment. I would never dare to
say that Stanford students fall
under this curtain of ignorance,
yet becoming even better in
formed about the world wouldn't
hurt.
I highly encourage the study
abroad experience — and even if
you can't fit it into your schedule,
fit it into your life. There are
summer internships, research op
portunities or even jobs you
could find in another country.
Don't you think it would be ex
citing to live in London? Or
Hong Kong? Or Santiago? Even
if its just for a little while?
After you're done reading the
international section, feel free to
go back to reading about Britney
Spears. But I have a feeling you
won't want to. You'll be too busy
planning your own trip abroad.

once again into the heartbeat of
the Farm has proved to be an
easy task, and after spending
time studying abroad, starting
the quarter with a new perspec
tive makes the embarking on the
beginning of this winter quarter
simply refreshing.
Gone are the days of stressing
out over the little details in life:
Can't choose between five of the
classes you were dead set of tak
ing because they are all offered
at 11 a.m.? Is the class you were
selling your soul for simply not
offered this year? Big deal.
While your heart may be racing

with anger as you try to fine-tune
your schedule, deep inside, you

know there's so
much more to
life than those
little stresses.
An experience
abroad serves as
a kind of alarm
clock. You liter
ally wake up and
think, my time
on this planet is
limited, and I

want to get out there again and
explore our remarkable globe.
Even more important, living
in another country makes you
recognize the vast importance of
keeping up with the international
news. One of the first things you
learn when stepping out of the
United States borders is the
sharp and quick realization that
you really don't know very much
at all. I don't think you could
ever claim to really "know the
world" but that doesn't mean
you really shouldn't try to ex
pand yourself at least a little.
If you follow one New Year's
Resolution this year, let it be
this: Be informed. Within five
minutes of you at any time on this
campus you're bound to find a
computer. Get on the Internet,
and after you've satiated your cu
riosity regarding the juicy details
of Britney Spears' marriage,
click on the international news
section. Talk to people who've
gone abroad or better yet, talk
to people who were born and
raised abroad. Then, when
you're ready to begin to see the
world, you'll be on top of your
stuff and you'll be able to gain
a much better appreciation
throughout your travels.
Becoming more informed
about the international scope
isn't just for the International

Relations or Political Science
majors. Recently, a Strategic
Task Force on Education
Abroad, compiled for the Associ
ation of International Educators,
a private organization, warned
that, "America's ignorance of the
world is now a national liability,"
in reference to Sept. 11. Accord
ing to the report, "the stubborn
monolingualism and ignorance of
the world" still present in the
United States is dangerous for
our national security, but I would
argue that it is also dangerous for
our intellectual and personal de
velopment. I would never dare to
say that Stanford students fall
under this curtain of ignorance,
yet becoming even better in
formed about the world wouldn't
hurt.
I highly encourage the study
abroad experience — and even if
you can't fit it into your schedule,
fit it into your life. There are
summer internships, research op
portunities or even jobs you
could find in another country.
Don't you think it would be ex
citing to live in London? Or
Hong Kong? Or Santiago? Even
if its just for a little while?
After you're done reading the
international section, feel free to
go back to reading about Britney
Spears. But I have a feeling you
won't want to. You'll be too busy
planning your own trip abroad.

Have you ever woken
up from a deep bout of
sleep, looked around
the room and won
dered, where the hell you are?
You glance around the room in a
daze, trying to figure out if
you're still stuck in dreamland or
whether you've hit reality. It
often happens when you haven't
been in a place for a long time,
and its downright surreal. I had
such an episode recently. Only
when my eyes finally adjusted,
taking in the gleaming white
walls, still unadorned and effus
ing their cold, institutional feel
did I take a deep breath and sigh.
Yes, I'm back on campus. In
Wilbur. Damn the plight of the
unpreferred Draw year.
Yet this quarter, the campus
life seems different. Oh sure, I
feel the quintessential Stanford
spirit in the air: I almost got run
over by five crazy bikers while
trying to get to class (OK, per
haps it was partly my fault I
still have a tendency to walk on
the wrong side of the road, a
habit remnant of my stay in Aus
tralia) and the campus is still
pumping with energy and enthu
siasm, even under the freezing
cold, cloudy sky. Yes, flowing
once again into the heartbeat of
the Farm has proved to be an
easy task, and after spending
time studying abroad, starting
the quarter with a new perspec
tive makes the embarking on the
beginning of this winter quarter
simply refreshing.
