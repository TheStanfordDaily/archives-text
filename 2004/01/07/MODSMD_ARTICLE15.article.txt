## Arizona, Stanford top Pacific-10 Conference 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Pacific 10 Conference is not particularly strong
in men's basketball this year, and last weekend's action
drove that point home, as Arizona State one of the
better teams in the Pac-10 got thumped at home, los
ing to No. 3 Arizona, 93-74.
The Wildcats (9-1, 1-0 Pac-10) and No. 4 Stanford
(11-0, 2-0) give the Pac-10 a powerful one-two punch,
but the conference has no other ranked teams.
Stanford also had an easy time over the weekend, de
feating Washington State, 73-51, and Washington, 85-
72. The Cougars (7-5,1-1) and Huskies (5-5, 0-2) can't
keep up with the Cardinal or the Wildcats, but fit right in
with the Pac-10's eight other teams, all of which have be
tween five and seven wins.
Against the Sun Devils (6-4, 0-1), Arizona got 26
points from junior guard Salim Stoudamire, who
drained six three-pointers, while holding Arizona State
standout Ike Diogu to 5-of-17 shooting.
Stanford's weekend sweep was led by senior Justin
Davis, who totaled 30 points and 18 rebounds. The Car
dinal's stiff defense held both opponents' leading scor
ers Marcus Moore and Bobby Jones below their
season scoring averages. The Washington schools com
bined to go 14-of-29 from three-point range, but still
couldn't stay close.
It's safe to say that the conference's unranked major
ity had an easier time playing its peers.
UCLA (6-3,2-0) was the only Pac-10 team other than
Arizona and Stanford to sweep its weekend games, de
feating Oregon State (6-6, 0-2), 77-66, on Friday and
Oregon (6-3, 1-1), 81-74, on Sunday. The Bruins were
tough on their home court, shooting over 50 percent in
each contest. Freshman forward Trevor Ariza led
UCLA with 32 points and 16 rebounds over the week
end, thanks in large part to 11-of-13 shooting from the
floor on Friday.

Cal (5-6,1-1) got off to a good start with a 76-62 win
over the Huskies on Friday, but came back and dropped
a disappointing 55-50 game to the Cougars on Sunday.
Leon Powe had 21 points on Friday but just two on Sun
day, as the Golden Bears shot just 39 percent and lost to
a Cougars team that only shot 45 percent itself. Moore
dropped in 14 points, but reserve forward Jeff Varem led
the Cougars with a surprising 15-point effort.
Like UCLA, Southern California (6-5, 1-1) hosted
the Oregon schools, but could only manage a split. Ore
gon outpaced them on Friday, 92-74, as lan Crosswhite
and James Davis both topped 20 points and the Ducks
shot a stunning 14-of-23 from long range. USC came
back with some firepower of its own on Sunday, outgun
ning the Beavers, 91-82, behind 18 points from Rory
O'Neil and 19 points from one of the team's four twins,
Lodrick Stewart (Rodrick Stewart and Derrick and
Errick Craven are the other three).
The Beavers, probably the worst team in the confer
ence this year now that Dick Bennett has taken over at
Washington State, were led in scoring Chris Stephens.
The sophomore guard scored 35 points last weekend,
but shot just 9-of-26 doing it.
Tomorrow night, Arizona will host Cal and Arizona
State will host Stanford, two precursors to Saturday's
important showdown between the Wildcats and the Car
dinal (and its Southwestern undercard, the Sun Devils
vs. the Golden Bears).
USC visits Washington and UCLA travels to Wash
ington State. On Saturday, the Bruins will play the
Huskies, the Trojans will face the Cougars and Oregon
State will host Oregon.
Saturday's Arizona-Stanford matchup figures to be
one of the most important Pac-10 games of the year,
since one of the two teams will come away with a loss on
its previously perfect conference record and the other
will pick up an impressive win over a top-five program.

Newcomer Fred Washington and the Cardinal men's basketball team should compete with Arizona for the top spot
in the Pac-10 this season.
