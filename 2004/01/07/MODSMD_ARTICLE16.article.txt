# Marshall, Newman pace men's swimmng to win over Cal State
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER 
Last Saturday at the Avery
Aquatic Complex the Stanford
men's swimming team concluded a
week of hard training with a solid
victory over Cal State Bakersfield.
Coming off a span of 12 practices in
seven days, the Cardinal won its first
official dual meet of the season by a
score of 146-77 over the Division II
Roadrunners.
Senior Peter Marshall led the
way for the Cardinal with victories in
the 200- and 500-yard freestyle
events. Freshman Keenan Newman
was also a double winner, taking the
1,000-yard freestyle and 100-yard
breaststroke.
However, more important than
the individual performances might
have been the team's accomplish
ments during the week preceding
the meet.
While the majority of the Stan
ford student body enjoyed the cus
tomary three-week winter vacation,
the men's swimming team returned
to the Farm on Dec. 27. The early ar
rival allowed swimmers to take a
week to prepare for the upcoming
winter season.
This "Christmas Training"

brought some of the hardest work
outs of the year for the developing
team.
Despite the challenges of training
hard after a two-week vacation, the
team finished the week with a posi
tive attitude.
"We had a solid week of work
outs during which we showed our
will to succeed," junior tri-captain
Jayme Cramer explained. The cam
pus remained closed during the
week so the team stayed in a nearby
hotel.
"Having the majority of the team
together gave us a good opportunity
to bond," Cramer said.
The meet on Saturday marked
the culmination of a rigorous Christ
mas Training schedule and present
ed an opportunity for the Cardinal
to sharpen its racing skills.
The previous meet for the Cardi
nal occurred before Thanksgiving
break at the Speedo Cup in Long
Beach, Calif. Saturday served as a
time to help remove any racing rust
that the swimmers might have accu
mulated during the six-week layoff
from competition.
As a way to maintain their versa
tility, most of the Cardinal swim-
mers swam events that were not
their strongest. Distance swimmers
swam the sprint events and vice
versa, but the team swam well de
spite the peculiar lineup.
"After the dread and pain of
Christmas training, it was wonderful
to see light in the eyes of my team

mates as they strived to perform be
yond expectations," senior tri-cap
tain Markus Rogan said.
With swimmers racing in "off"
events, the results were still solid.
NCAA champion backstroker Mar
shall posted a solid 4:34.83 in the 500-
yard freestyle, an event he seldom
swims.
Newman, known for his individu
al medley, swam a 9:31.88 in the
1,000-yard free, edging out his team
mate, freshman Hongzhe Sun, by
three one-hundredths of a second.

The meet started a stretch of
seven dual meets in seven weeks for
the Cardinal squad. The span in
cludes competitions against nation
ally ranked Pacific 10 Conference
teams USC and Arizona.
Although grueling, the intense
meet schedule should help prepare
the Cardinal for Pac-10 Champi
onships and the NCAA Champi
onships at the end of the season. The
Cardinal head to Michigan this
weekend for a dual meet against the
Wolverines.
