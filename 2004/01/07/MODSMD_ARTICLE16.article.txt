### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER 
Last Saturday at the Avery
Aquatic Complex the Stanford
men's swimming team concluded a
week of hard training with a solid
victory over Cal State Bakersfield.
Coming off a span of 12 practices in
seven days, the Cardinal won its first
official dual meet of the season by a
score of 146-77 over the Division II
Roadrunners.
Senior Peter Marshall led the

will to succeed," junior tri-captain
Jayme Cramer explained. The cam
pus remained closed during the
week so the team stayed in a nearby
hotel.
"Having the majority of the team
together gave us a good opportunity
to bond," Cramer said.
The meet on Saturday marked
the culmination of a rigorous Christ
mas Training schedule and present
ed an opportunity for the Cardinal
to sharpen its racing skills.
The previous meet for the Cardi
nal occurred before Thanksgiving
break at the Speedo Cup in Long
Beach, Calif. Saturday served as a
time to help remove any racing rust
