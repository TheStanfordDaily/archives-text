# Baseball stays busy in offseason

### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal baseball team's tremendous
2003 season ended at the Championship game
in Omaha with a 14-2 heartbreak loss to Rice.
But the squad bounced back quickly and spent
the off-season reminding the country why
Stanford has been to the College World Series
for a record five straight years.
Stanford has been ranked sixth in both the
Collegiate Baseball and Baseball America
preseason polls, mostly due to the fact that the
team returns eight position players.
Coach Mark Marquess, who begins his 28th
year at the helm of Stanford baseball, said that
rankings have a tendency to be deceiving, as
they do not account for factors such as team
chemistry.
"It all comes down to pitching," Marquess
said of the key issue among top-ranked teams.
"[Many teams] don't have a Friday starter
right now. A number one starter."

Several organizations hand out awards to

honors.
Senior outfielder Sam Fuld who last sea
son passed on an MLB contract to play a
fourth and final year with the Cardinal was
named an NCBWA First Team Preseason All-
American for the second straight year. Fuld
