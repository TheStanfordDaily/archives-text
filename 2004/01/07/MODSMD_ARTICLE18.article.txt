# Bret's must-read guide to the Dorm Ski Trip
## 
### 
The Triple Crown. Arguably the
rarest of all achievements in sport. In
baseball we're talking leading 700
other professionals in home runs,
runs batted in and batting average. In horse
racing we're talking beating out the best

thoroughbreds in the country in
Kentucky, New York and I'm pretty
sure one other state. On the dorm
ski trip we're talking eating an en
fuego No. 4 value meal from Taco
Bell, hoskeying down a No. 4 from
Carl's Jr., and washing it all down
with a medium Domino's meat
lovers on the ride up to Tahoe.
OK, so no one's actually seen
anyone do that, but the legend of the
Otero CS Major who supersized

each meal on the way to South Lake and
doffed himself Chief Technician of Route
50's fast food realm in 1979 lives on in many
an alum's nostalgic winter tale.
So who will try for the mark this year? Not
I, you say? That's ludicrous, you say? Well
that's obviously why its called a record. But if
you're not up for the trifecta, take a shot at the
single meal record: get off Route 80 at the UC
Davis exit and pull into the cozy little eatery so

fittingly designated "Murder Burger." Order
The Annihilator, a one pound Matterhorn of a
hamburger smothered in rivers of cheese, half
a pigs worth of bacon, a jar of Helmann's, all ac
companied by another fat pound of fries, so
shiny you can actually see yourself begin to

break out in the reflection. Be sure to
order the meal with a conscience easing
bathtub-cup of Diet Coke.
If glorified gluttony lacks appeal, do
not fear, the dorm ski trip is full of a
wide variety of competition from which
even the least athletic and most drunk
can come away champions without
having to fake it. Face it, there's no true
regality in strutting around the lodge
with a pair of $1,200 skis under your
arm and a pair of chickenlegs under

your waist, talking about the switch 540 rodeo
you would have yanked if the wind had been
blowing from the southeast instead of the
south. Lest we forget the best skier money can
buy only fools himself, just like Ja Rule when
he pops ecstacy like a feeb off camera, and raps
about, as 50 Cent so succinctly stated, "what he
sees in gangster movies."
Bring a sled up to the cabin: plastic, wood
or inflatable. Note: a toboggan radiates

Shooter McGavin swagger and a Jesper
Parnevik-esque savvy that speaks for itself.
Races can take place anywhere after dark: on
the hill behind the cabin, in the woods, down
the road or even on the same ski slopes you
surrendered to earlier in the day. Sledding
resort trails does add risk to the equation in
the form of grooming machines and chairlift
towers. Last February one particularly dumb
L.A. birdbrain at Mammoth Mountain using
a chairlift tower pad as a sled died in Dar
winian fashion when he crashed into the very
tower he had removed the pad from.
Many resorts offer snow bikes, a ski / bike
hybrid with seemingly endless possibilities
for competition and fun. Tally the skiers/
riders you can run over or gore in one run or
throughout the entire day. This game has no
losers. Tired of waving the Dikembe Mu
tombo rejection finger in the faces of those
swatted down in your wake? Take the bike to
the terrain park and try landing a 360 no
handed nutcracker off a 20-foot kicker while
in mid-flight letting loose a Chris Rix-esque
howl of "I AM AWESOME!"
Not a mountain thrill seeker? Try skitch
ing, a great winter sport that's just so hot
right now. All you need is a car, some duct

tape, a buddy with a need for speed and a
snow covered road. Tape over the soles of
your shoes, and grab onto the back of the car.
Let Leadfoot go wild behind the wheel and
hold on for dear life. Bear in mind, a grody
pair of cross trainers is preferable to the Jor
dans you got for Christmas / Hannukah.
There is a King of the Mountain variation to
skitching where multiple contestants battle it
out in a "last man left skitching wins" free for
all. Goggles and beer recommended.
For the velocity challenged there exist a
couple great competitions based around the
lodge. Start a snow cave contest and dig en
tire refrigerated homes, frozen mazes for
kids and dogs to get lost in or snow outhous
es to help keep the surrounding area
sparkling white. The introverted "Artie the
one-man party" might even design Gollum's
winter lair if so inclined.
Snow spitballs. Everyone must try this.
This is even better than tossing sticks in front
of the senior citizen rollerbladers tearing
through White Plaza every Thursday night. I
repeat, everyone must try this. It's a
lunchtime game that simply cannot fail to
bring participants to the floor in tears of
laughter at others' expense. Pack a snowball

super awesomely tight then find a straw.
Break a little chunk of snow off in the straw,
pick a target somewhere on the kid that just
completed Gollum's snowcave surprise all
by himself. Preferably choose a sensitive and
exposed region about the head such as an
ear, neck, or forehead, and then fire at will.
As you blow the kiss of death to the bird in
the purple unisuit and Dusty Baker shades
and take him down with an icy stinger, be
sure to conclude, "does life get any better
than this? I submit that it does not."
And if you can't ski, eat, dig, skate, skitch,
run naked down an icy road or blow through
a straw, hopefully you can pick up a remote
and find an NFL playoff game on tv
there's always a little sport in football.
See you in the mountains.

Bret Bechis once dug a snowcave for four
hours before a plow came and destroyed it
with him still inside. He now sticks to skitch
ing in a pair ofgrody Bo Jackson cross train
ers his brother hoskeyed on over in middle
school. If you have any more suggestions
for ski trip, you can e-mail him at
