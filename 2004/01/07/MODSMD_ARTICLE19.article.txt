# LSU snaps Zona's 10-game win streak
## 
### SHANE DALE ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT (U. ARIZONA 
(U-WIRE) TUCSON, Ariz. With a pair of
10-game winning streaks on the line, something
had to give when the Arizona women's basketball
team traveled to LSU.
Ultimately, it was the Wildcats' persistent road
woes that gave.
LSU opened both halves with big runs and led
by as many as 25 in the second half as the No. 17
Tigers beat Arizona 76-66 Sunday in Baton
Rouge, La.
"We had our opportunities [but] we didn't take
advantage of it," said UA head coach Joan Bon
vicini. "LSU's a real good basketball team, very
strong, really quick."
The Wildcats' school record-tying 10-game
winning streak was snapped, while LSU won its
11th straight.
Arizona (11-3, 3-0 Pac-10 Conference) seems
to be a different team away from McKale Center
this season. The Wildcats haven't scored fewer
than 74 points at home but have yet to score more
than 67 points in a game away from McKale.
They've won all of their eight home games by at
least 12 points, but are just 3-3 on the road and at
neutral sites.
The Wildcats were outshot from the field 42
percent to 39 percent marking the first time
they were bested from the floor since their previ
ous loss Nov. 28 against Virginia.
"We needed some jumpers but we didn't get
them," Bonvicini said.
U A junior guard Dee-Dee Wheeler led all scorers
with a season-high 25 points. Arizona lost for the
first time in 12 games when Wheeler has scored 20
or more points.
Wheeler took a career-high 27 shots shat
tering her previous high of 18 and made 11 of
them.
"I thought Dee-Dee played well," Bonvicini
said. "She kept us in it."
"CoCoa Sanford off the bench was excellent,"
Bonvicini added, noting that the sophomore for
ward scored 17 points and grabbed seven boards
in 32 minutes for Arizona.
Bonvicini is unsure if Sanford, who lost her

starting job to junior forward Danielle Adefeso
six games into the season, will return to the start
ing lineup after the performance.
"I'm not sure. I'm gonna evaluate that and
see," she said.
Wildcat sophomore center Shawntinice Polk
added 14 points and a game-high 12 rebounds, in
cluding six offensive boards, for her fourth
straight double-double.
But no other Wildcat scored more than four
points. Starters Aimee Grzyb, Natalie Jones and
Adefeso combined for six points and nine
turnovers.
"We definitely needed other people to step
up," Bonvicini said.
The Tigers scored the game's first 10 points and
took a 39-27 lead into halftime. Wheeler scored
16 of Arizona's 27 first-half points.
LSU (12-2, 0-0 Southeastern Conference)
went on a 7-0 spurt to open the second half and
took its biggest lead at 64-39 midway through the
second. Arizona would go on a 23-7 run to cut the
lead to nine with less than two minutes left but
would get no closer.
"I don't think we played very well until the last
eight minutes," Bonvicini said. "We allowed them
to control the tempo."
Sophomore guard Seimone Augustus led the
Tigers with 22 points. Senior guard Doneeka
Hodges scored 18 and made 4-of-7 from 3-point
range, while 5-foot-3 senior guard Temeka John
son added eight points and a game-high 11 assists
for LSU.
Arizona is 1-2 against ranked teams this season.
The Wildcats beat then-No. 24 Washington in
McKale on Dec. 27.
"As much as I hate to lose, I think we learned
some things about ourselves," Bonvicini said.
"We have time now to get ourselves ready and
get refocused and take care of business [in the
Pac-10]."
Arizona continues its three-game road swing
when it travels to the Bay Area to face California
and No. 9 Stanford.
Bonvicini said her team can take some consola
tion in knowing they're still undefeated in the
Pac-10.
"Those are the games that count," she said.
