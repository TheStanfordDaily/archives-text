## Syphilis rampant at U. Minn 
### CHRIS KALLAL MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS
A rise in Minnesota's syphilis rate has
brought new focus to the disease at
the University of Minnesota.
Minnesota saw a 67 percent in
crease in the number of new cases of
syphilis from 2001 to 2002, Nicoline
Collins of the Minnesota Department
of Health said. In 2002 82 new cases
were reported, up from 49 in 2001.
Although the total number of peo
ple infected with syphilis are low com
pared to other sexually transmitted
infections, the sudden rise has led to a
renewed interest in combating the
disease, Collins said.
Boynton Health Service plans to
restart efforts to track the number of
syphilis cases on campus.
"We stopped asking about syphilis
in the mid-'9os," Boynton Health Ser
vice director Ed Ehlinger said. "But
we will be surveying for it again this
spring because we have seen another
bump up in the numbers."
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted
infection with symptoms including
rashes, sores and muscle aches. Even
tually, if untreated, the disease can

cause damage to internal organs, as
well as paralysis and dementia.
There were 56 new cases of syphilis
among gay men in Minnesota in 2002,
compared with five the year before.
Of those who reported new cases,
88 percent were white and almost half
were HIV-positive.
"[Syphilis] is a big problem in Min
neapolis and among HIV-positive in
dividuals," Ehlinger said. "It is not a
big problem on this campus."
At the University, health services
focus more on chlamydia and gonor
rhea, Collins said. Rates of infection
for both these diseases increased
among college students in 2002, she
said.
"Right now [students] are not real
ly at risk," Collins said. "But we know
that students are having unprotected
sex, and, if introduced, syphilis could
become a big problem."
Collins said the disease was
thought to be under control after
three years of fewer than one
case per year, according to Cen
ters for Disease Control and Pre
vention data. But men began re
porting syphilis more frequently
in 2001, and the trend continued
in 2002.

According to Boynton, no one at
the University has reported a case of
syphilis in two years. However, that
does not mean students should not be
concerned about the disease,
Ehlinger said.
"Syphilis rates can quickly increase
among populations that have unpro
tected sex," Ehlinger said. "We are
concerned about these diseases, espe
cially among the younger end of the
age range."
The University provides services
through Boynton for those infected
with sexually transmitted infections.
The state's Health Department and
Boynton say to most effectively pre
vent infection, students should prac
tice safe sex.
Syphilis is spread mainly by sexual
contact and is caused by a bacterium.
The disease can be treated with a
single shot of penicillin, but without
treatment, it can have serious health
consequences.
College of Liberal Arts junior
Alyssa Geronsin said she did not
think syphilis was a problem.
"I don't know anyone who has it,"
she said. "It's kind of like AIDS I
just don't really think about it affect
ing me."
