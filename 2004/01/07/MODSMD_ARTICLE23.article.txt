### ZACK SURAK THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. An FBI-led
anti-terrorism task force discovered blueprints of
common areas of Princeton Borough, N.J., and
Princeton University in an apartment in Philadel
phia earlier this week, University Public Safety
Crime Prevention Specialist Barry Weiser said.
The FBI would not release to the university the
reason for its investigation of the individual in pos
session of the blueprints, Weiser said.
The FBI contacted Princeton officials to deter
mine the locations featured in the blueprints and
ask whether the university was familiar with the per
son under investigation.
"[University officials] were not familiar with the
individual's name in the engineering or physical
planning offices," Weiser said.
Princeton was helpful in identifying the locations
shown in the blueprints, he said.
"[The university's Department of] State and
Community Affairs said similar blueprints were
used in the project to redesign downtown Princeton
Borough," Weiser said. "An architect in Philly was

used in that project."
Weiser added that the individual who owned the
apartment could have been working for the archi
tectural firm in Philadelphia.
Though Weiser did not know the status of the
FBl's investigation, he said he didn't think the inci
dent posed a major threat to the campus.
"The FBI obviously didn't deem it too important
if they didn't continue discussing it with us," Weiser
added.
Borough Police Lt. Dennis McManimon said
the FBI did not inform Borough officials of the inci
dent.
In an unrelated incident, McManimon said Bor
ough police have a lead on suspects in the recent
string of thefts at Prospect Avenue's eating clubs.
"It's just general information," McManimon
said. "Sometimes you hear info that people may
have been involved in thefts."
McManimon said the investigation is ongoing
and the names of the individuals will not be released
at this time. However, he added, Public Safety has
been notified of the suspects.
"If we observe them on campus or around clubs,
we will let local police know," Weiser said.
