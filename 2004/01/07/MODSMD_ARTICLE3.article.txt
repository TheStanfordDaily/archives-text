# Number of early admits rises
## 
### NANCY WANG 
Stanford has admitted a significantly higher number of students
in its early pool, after a boost in early applications that followed a
change in the University's early admissions policy.
Stanford invited 800 students last month to join the Class of 2008,
compared to the 596 early decision applicants admitted last year.
Yet the early acceptance rate actually decreased from 24 percent to
around 20 percent due to the high number of applicants.
After switching from a binding early decision program to an ex
perimental single-choice early action program, Stanford received
close to 4,200 early applications this year, a record surge of 62 per
cent over last year. Those admitted account for one third of total ex
pected admission offers. An increase in early applications also took
place at Yale which made the same early admissions change as
Stanford whereas other Ivy League institutions saw a decrease in
the number of early applicants.
"We were unsure what to expect in our first year of single-choice
early action, but the applicants absolutely amazed us," Dean of Ad
mission and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet told the Stanford Report.
"The admitted students share the remarkable pursuit of passions
and the diversity of excellences that define Stanford. I look forward
to watching their many contributions to our entire community."
Ivy League schools, meanwhile, saw an overall decrease of about
15 percent in the number of early applicants this year.
The number of early applicants to Princeton University de
creased by 24.5 percent. Columbia University experienced a much
smaller decline of 3.8 percent in the number of early applicants.
University of Pennsylvania's and Brown's figures remained essen
tially unchanged from last year, with 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent in
creases respectively. Dartmouth witnessed a slight increase of 5.2
percent.
Harvard and Yale both saw dramatic fluctuations as a result of
changes in early admissions policies.
Harvard, which switched from an early action to single-choice
early action program this year, saw a drop of over 47 percent in the
number of applicants. Harvard's early acceptance rate increased
from 15.1 percent last year to 23.3 percent this year, making Stan
ford's early acceptance rate lower than that of Harvard's.
Like Stanford, Yale University also switched this year from early
decision to single-choice early action, causing a similar increase in
the number of early applicants by 52.4 percent.
The University's admissions office discontinued the early deci
sion program this year to reduce the stress and anxiety commonly
associated with the college application process. Rather than making
a binding commitment, single-choice early action applicants agree
not to file other early applications but can apply to other schools
regular decision. Students then have until May 1 to confirm enroll
ment. This allows students to compare financial aid packages of
fered by various institutions before making a decision.
"Our hope, of course, is that Stanford remains the first choice of
all our admits," Mamlet said in a press release last month. "But the
pressure is off we encourage these students to consider carefully
all their college options and to decide by spring which campus is the
best fit for them."

Many Stanford students remarked that the change is a beneficial
one.
"I think it's a good change," said freshman Brian Pfeiffer, who
was accepted through the early decision program. "This way, stu
dents aren't forced to come to the school if they change their minds
later."
When asked about single-choice early action as opposed to early
action, Celen Zepeda, who was also admitted early into this year's
freshman class, commented that the process of limiting applicants to
one school seems fair.
"It separates those who really want to come to Stanford from
those who just wanted to throw in an application," she said.
