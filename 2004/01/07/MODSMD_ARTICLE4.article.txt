# A3C unveils new online activities guide geared toward Asian students
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
Covering everything from the Bay
Area's best karaoke bars to campus
film screenings and food outings, the
Asian American Activities Center will
launch its own online Asian entertain
ment guide tomorrow and host a party
to celebrate the Web site's debut.
The A3C E-Guide will feature infor
mation about Asian activities on cam
pus and in the Bay Area, such as muse
um exhibits and Viet Tet Festivals in
San Jose. It will also highlight food and
dining, including Indian and Pakistani
grocery stores and Thai restaurants.
Reviews of popular Asian music and
movies will also be available.
"Ever since I arrived on campus I

have been hearing from students who
could benefit from this service," said
Debby Chang, the E-Guide editor.
"What the E-Guide hopes to become is
a one-stop place where students inter
ested in Asian culture can find out
about all the events happening on cam
pus and the local area."
The Bay Area is home to some of the
largest Asian and Asian American
communities, and the number of Asian
American students at Stanford has dra
matically increased in the past decade.
The number of culturally related ac
tivities available in the area has risen as
well, but limited dollars and a lack of
manpower has inhibited the sponsor
ship and promotion of such events, ac
cording to Rick Yuen, the center's di
rector.

"The demand for such a guide stems
from a need for more information
about entertainment around campus
and the surrounding communities," he
said.
Yuen and Assistant Director Cindy
Ng conceived of the idea for the E-
Guide as a way "to harness the existing
resources and activities of our sur
rounding communities as well as on
campus resources," according to Yuen.
Yuen also pointed out that graduate
and undergraduate students often differ
in what they are looking for in on- and
off-campus activities. He said the E-
Guide aims to address these varying in
terests.
"Graduate students are always look-
ing for culturally enriching oppor
tunities both on and off campus,
but may not be as aware of under
graduate student sponsored events
such as the annual Nite Market or
the many A3C sponsored free film
screenings," he continued. "Their
criteria may include low cost and
interesting venues. Freshmen may
absolutely need public transporta
tion such as Caltrain, Samtrans or
the Marguerite Shuttle to get to
their destinations. E-Guide will
offer all of this information at one
easy-to-bookmark Web site."
Yuen and Chang, along with
Web master Jamie Funamura, have
been developing the Web site for

the past three months. On Thurs
day night, the center will be hosting
a launch party open to everyone,
complete with door prizes and re
freshments and information about
the E-Guide. The celebration will
be held in the center's couch room
in the Old Union Clubhouse, from
9 p.m. to 10 p.m.
"The E-Guide is always going to
be a work in progress, so it's going to
be fun to see how it grows in the next
few months," Chang said. "Also, all
suggestions for content are not only
welcome, but highly encouraged.
The point of the E-Guide is to pro
vide information about things the
students want to know about, so the
best way for us to do that is to hear
about what's entertaining straight
from the readers."
The E-Guide can be found at
