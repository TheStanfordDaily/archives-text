## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
If New Student Orientation left some lingering questions,
the sophomore class has a second chance to get oriented.
The first-ever Sophomore Reorientation event will
occur this evening between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. at the Fish
er Conference Center in the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
The programs offered tonight will include panels and
information sessions on a variety of topics ranging from
general education requirements and academic standing
to developing public speaking skills to winning fellow
ships, internships and honors to designing research to
preparing for professional and graduate schools.
Speakers will include staff from the Career Develop
ment Center, Undergraduate Advising Center, Haas Cen
ter, Overseas Studies, Bechtel International Center, the
Registrar's Office and Undergraduate Research Programs.
Advance student interest in the event has been high, according to
organizers who are still unsure how many sophomore will attend.

"I think this is a really good idea," said sophomore
Mark Chen. "We got a lot of these presentations during
Admit Weekend and Orientation, but so much is going on
then, we're really not focused on or paying attention to
what's being said."
Freshman Sarah Carroll agreed, also indicating that
now that she is older and has narrowed her undergradu
ate interests, she would like further direction.
"I think it's a general sentiment among college stu
dents to feel overwhelmed by all the opportunities pre
sented to them at college, and this seems like a great way
to explain everything to us again," she said. "But now I
want to know more about getting research positions and
working with professors, so it's a great time to offer this
and work to combat the 'sophomore slump.' "
Sophomores had to register in advance for the event
by submitting their student identification number and
choosing which of 20 sessions they would like to attend.
Sophomores could list as many sessions as they were in
terested in, but space was limited for each program.
