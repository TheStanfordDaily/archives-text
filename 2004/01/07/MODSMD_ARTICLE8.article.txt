# Iowa proposes restrictions on cold medicine to curtail abuse
## 
### WILLIAM MIKESELL THE DAILY IOWAN 
(U-WIRE) lOWA CITY, lowa A
proposed lowa state law that would con
fine cold medicine behind the counter in an
effort to curtail methamphetamine pro
duction is evoking criticism from both re
tailers and customers.
The state drug czar's proposal, to be in
troduced in the lowa Legislature in Janu
ary, would remove pseudoephedrine cold
and sinus medicine from store shelves and
require photo identification for purchase.
The measure would allow police to track
meth precursor sales in an attempt to crack
down on manufacturers.
Some area grocers and customers said
they understand the need for regulations to
reduce meth production, but they say the
law would reduce accessibility to the medi

cine when pharmacies are closed.
"It's going to be a real inconvenience
for the person who is just sick," said A 1 Dix,
the store manager at Hy-Vee.
He added that the proposed law would
mean an increased burden for already busy
pharmacists.
Of the more than 200 Hy-Vee stores,
only about half of them have a pharmacy,
so customers would have to go to other
stores to purchase cold medication under
the proposed law, he said.
The proposed measure would also
tighten existing federal regulations on
ephedrine that limit the amount that cus
tomers can buy at one time.
"I believe it's probably unnecessary,"
said Coralville, lowa, resident Dennis Pe
tersen, adding that retailers can police sus
picious purchases. "I don't think the regu
lar person should have to pay for what the

criminals are doing."
Dix said Hy-Vee restrictions on
ephedrine sales don't necessarily deter
meth manufacturers because "usually the
people that are [making meth] steal it."
Like the removal of cigarettes from
store shelves, restricting access to
ephedrine is another imposition upon con
sumers, he said, but he acknowledged the
benefits of the law. Placing the main meth
ingredient behind pharmacists' counters
would greatly reduce the ability of meth
cookers to steal the product, he said.
Compromising citizens' freedom to
purchase cold medicines will help solve the
prolific drug problem, said Curt Smith, the
assistant director for programs at the Gov
ernor's Office on Drug Control Policy.
"The meth epidemic keeps on increas
ing by leaps and bounds no matter what we
do," he said.
