## Students sues university after beanbag gun injury 
### KORAN ADDO MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS, Minn.
After two surgeries to remove his spleen
and correct an obstructed digestive tract,
University of Minnesota senior Jeffrey
Arndt is suing the university as well as both
the university and Minneapolis, Minn., po
lice departments.
Arndt had the surgeries after police
shot him in the back with a beanbag gun
sometime during the late-night hours of
the riot that followed the NCAA hockey
championship April 12.
Although Arndt's lawyers Ted Dooley
and Peter Nickitas said police used exces
sive force and violated Arndt's constitu

tional rights, Minneapolis police Public In
formation Officer Ron Reier said police
have the right to use force if they feel it is
necessary.
In a criminal complaint filed in Hen
nepin County District Court in September,
Arndt said he was walking home along
University Avenue Southeast when an of
ficer shot him in the back with a beanbag
gun.
Arndt said he was not involved in the
riots but was in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
The complaint also states that the offi
cer whose department could not be iden
tified because his face, name tag and badge
were covered did not tell Arndt to "stop"
or "freeze" before he shot him in the back.

University police declined to comment
on the active case, but Reier said police
policy states that officers are under no
obligation to issue a verbal order before
using force.
"Cops do not have to fight fair," he said.
"The law gives [police] the right to use
more force on you than you use on me."
Dooley said he and his co-counsel will
ask the jury to award damages based on
Arndt's suffering, loss of time and dimin
ished capacities.
He said he is certain it will become
obvious in court that police violated
Arndt's freedom of unreasonable
searches and seizures and freedom
from unreasonable application of ex
cessive force, under the Constitution's

Fourth and 14th amendments, respec
tively.
"I don't know how the jury will see it,
but God's own truth will have out in
court," Dooley said.
The University's general counsel was
unavailable for comment, and the city at
torney's office declined to comment on the
case.
Associate Medical School Dean
Charles Moidow said patients such as
Arndt who have their spleens removed are
more susceptible to infection and might re
quire medical attention for the rest of their
lives.
"The spleen acts as a filter," he said.
"An adult can live quite well without one,
but they are more at risk for respiratory in

fections."
Moldow added that people who have
emergency splenectomies sometimes re
quire vaccinations every five years for sick
nesses such as pneumonia.
"Unfortunately, [vaccinations] work
best when a person has their spleen in
place, but I'm guessing that a young adult
could be back in school in 10 days and be
back to normal in a month to six weeks," he
said.
Dooley said his client is suing for a com
bination of principle and compensation
which are separated by a thin line.
"Compensation is a nice thing, but there
is a heavy principle involved," Dooley said.
"In this country we tend to keep score with
compensation."
