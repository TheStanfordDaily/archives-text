What lays behind the popular image
of archaeology as practiced by Indiana
Jones and Lara Croft, as portrayed by
Agatha Christie, National Geographic &
FOX TV specials? What is archaeology's
role in the 21st century beyond
"knowledge as entertainment"? How
does it engage the public, what is its
aim (product) and audience (market)?
The aim of this course is NOT to
pedantically set the record straight of
"what we really do" Instead we shall
examine the construction and repre
sentation of archaeology in the public
imagination through film, literature
and other media and use the tropes
and stereotypes to critically shed light
on archaeological practice.
