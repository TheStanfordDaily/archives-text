WINTER QUARTER STUDENT INITIATED COURSES
CASA 101: The Postcolonial
Caribbean and U.S. Caribbean Relations
This course will offer a comparison of the rich histories of Caribbean
islands, a discussion of more recent events relating to social, cultur
al, political, environmental, and economic development issues. This
discussion will then tie in the direct and indirect influence that the
United States has had on each of these areas. The first class will offer
an overview and underlining themes of the course. Students from
various Caribbean islands will lead each proximate week and bring
in guest professors, and speakers.

ance of A Midsummer's Night Dream and drama exercises that we
will develop as a class.

And why do airliners look so different from fighter jets? Why are
many old airplanes biplanes? Why are newer and better airplanes
always being made? In this class you will explore the variety in air
plane designs, and the science that shows how every airplane is
optimally designed for a certain purpose. No pre-requisites. No math.

CEE 5751 Sustainable Habits:
Interactions between Students and
Systems at Stanford
In this course we will examine daily habits and develop a systems
understanding of individuals as members of resource cycles. We will
take an in depth look at the operational systems of Stanford campus
(topics include food procurement and waste; social interactions, labor
and community dynamics; building/physical infrastructure construc
tion and maintenance; water; energy/electricity; procurement, solid
waste and recycling; and transportation) to assess the sustainability
of both the resource systems and our place within these systems.
Staff experts from various campus departments will deliver weekly
lectures and participants will fill out questionnaires (developed
through student and staff collaboration) on use patterns of resources
both to provide feedback to Stanford operations and to increase stu
dent awareness of resources. Join us in this innovative educational
collaboration between students and staff!
