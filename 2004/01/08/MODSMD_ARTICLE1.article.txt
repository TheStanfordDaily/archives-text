# Bumpy Road Ahead
## Women try to stay unbeaten in Pac-10 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team (11-2, 4-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
seeks to stay unbeaten in the conference
with two tough Pac-10 games looming, as
the team faces off tonight against Arizona
State and Saturday against Arizona.
Though the Cardinal is coming off two re
cent losses during winter break to No. 5
Tennessee and No. 2 Texas Tech, it is still
expected to top the conference this sea
son.
Stanford is currently 7-1 on its home
floor and is fresh off road wins against
Washington State (90-69) and Washing
ton (77-69) last weekend. Sunday's game
in Seattle saw the return of senior forward
Nicole Powell, who was out two weeks
after spraining her ankle.
"I think [Nicole] is ahead of schedule,
but it's always day-to-day with an injury
like that and when you play like she did on
Sunday it sets you back," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer.
Though she was out nine minutes to
nurse her ankle, she scored 23 points and
recorded 13 rebounds. She leads the team
in scoring with 202 points on the season.
Junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
the team's second leading scorer, tops the
Pac-10 in three-pointers with 29 to date.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin has been
making a name for herself on offense and
defense, breaking the school record with
eight blocks and averaging 2.38 per game.
While Arizona definitely poses a
greater threat for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils are not a pushover. Arizona State is
8-4 on the season and 2-1 in conference
play, and despite finishing eighth in the
Pac-10 last year, it has returned all its
starters this season.
The Cardinal has only lost once to the
Sun Devils at Maples, holding a 21-1 home
record against ASU. Stanford beat ASU
at both meetings last season, with an 80-63
victory at Maples Pavilion and 63-53 at
Arizona State.
Still, VanDerveer won't let the team
rest on its laurels against the Sun Devils.
"When teams have the same coach,
things don't change that much, so Arizona
State will still be extremely aggressive on
