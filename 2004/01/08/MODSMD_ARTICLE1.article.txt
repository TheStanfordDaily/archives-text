# Bumpy Road Ahead
## Women try to stay unbeaten in Pac-10 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team (11-2, 4-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
seeks to stay unbeaten in the conference
with two tough Pac-10 games looming, as
the team faces off tonight against Arizona
State and Saturday against Arizona.
Though the Cardinal is coming off two re
cent losses during winter break to No. 5
Tennessee and No. 2 Texas Tech, it is still
expected to top the conference this sea
son.
Stanford is currently 7-1 on its home
floor and is fresh off road wins against
Washington State (90-69) and Washing
ton (77-69) last weekend. Sunday's game
in Seattle saw the return of senior forward
Nicole Powell, who was out two weeks
after spraining her ankle.
"I think [Nicole] is ahead of schedule,
but it's always day-to-day with an injury
like that and when you play like she did on
Sunday it sets you back," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer.
Though she was out nine minutes to
nurse her ankle, she scored 23 points and
recorded 13 rebounds. She leads the team
in scoring with 202 points on the season.
Junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
the team's second leading scorer, tops the
Pac-10 in three-pointers with 29 to date.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin has been
making a name for herself on offense and
defense, breaking the school record with
eight blocks and averaging 2.38 per game.
While Arizona definitely poses a
greater threat for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils are not a pushover. Arizona State is
8-4 on the season and 2-1 in conference
play, and despite finishing eighth in the
Pac-10 last year, it has returned all its
starters this season.
The Cardinal has only lost once to the
Sun Devils at Maples, holding a 21-1 home
record against ASU. Stanford beat ASU
at both meetings last season, with an 80-63
victory at Maples Pavilion and 63-53 at
Arizona State.
Still, VanDerveer won't let the team
rest on its laurels against the Sun Devils.
"When teams have the same coach,
things don't change that much, so Arizona
State will still be extremely aggressive on

defense. We must do a good job of taking
care of the ball," she said.
Arizona may be the most competitive
team in the Pac-10 after Stanford. With
an 11-3 overall record, the Wildcats are
an undefeated 3-0 in the conference, but
were bounced off the rankings after a 76-
66 loss to LSU on Jan. 4.
The Wildcats had a strong season last
year, advancing to the first round of the
NCAA Tournament and tying for second
place in the Pac-10. Three players are av
eraging double digits this year: Aimee
Gryzb (10.1), Dee-Dee Wheeler (16.9)
and Shawtinice Polk (17.2), one of the top
centers in the country.
Stanford is 19-3 against the Wildcats in
Maples and leads the series 35-11. The Car
dinal defeated Arizona twice last season
82-74 at home and 59-49 in Pac-10 Tourna
ment. The Cardinal lost to the Wildcats on
the road last year 79-64, when Wheeler and
Polk combined for 49 points and 15 re
bounds.
The loss of Powell over the break gave
the rest of the team a chance to shine.
Kimyacioglu is getting her perimeter shot
back; junior guard Kelley Suminski shot a
near perfect game against Washington
State, missing one shot while dropping 22
points; and Susan Borchardt notched 14
against Washington and has been doing
an excellent job ball handling.
The team is also approaching full
strength in the post, with junior Azella
Perryman recording good numbers and
boards. But fellow junior T'Nae Thiel still

has yet to reach full strength.
The Wildcats' Polk, at 6-foot-5-inches,
is an intimidating presence in the paint,
and may pose a difficult matchup for the
Cardinal down low. She had 12 rebounds
in last Sunday's game.
VanDerveer believes the addition of
Newlin will make a difference this year
against the Wildcats, particularly facing
Polk.
"[Last year in addition to Trotter and
Thiel covering Polk] we also played a lot
of zone defense [against Arizona], but I
think we're in a much better situation this
year with Newlin," VanDerveer said.
According to Suminski, the Cardinal
will focus on strengthening its defense
against the Wildcats.
"We expect a strong inside presence
from Arizona as well as a fast-paced
game," she said. "It is important that we
play aggressive and smart defensively."
Although Stanford has been perform
ing well from the perimeter these past few
games, Suminski emphasized the talent of
the team's post players.
"Continued good shooting will be im
portant for us, but we are not completely
dependent upon it," she said. "Our inside
game is very strong and we have a lot of
confidence in our posts."
Still, the Wheeler / Polk combo should
be a force to be reckoned with this Satur
day. Wheeler's quickness and speed com
bined with Polk's rebounding might cre
ate serious problems for the Cardinal on
both ends of the court.
Tonight's game will get underway at 7
p.m. while Saturday's showdown with
Arizona will take place at 2 p.m.

back; junior guard Kelley Suminski shot a
near perfect game against Washington
State, missing one shot while dropping 22
points; and Susan Borchardt notched 14
against Washington and has been doing
an excellent job ball handling.
The team is also approaching full
strength in the post, with junior Azella
Perryman recording good numbers and
boards. But fellow junior T'Nae Thiel still

has yet to reach full strength.
The Wildcats' Polk, at 6-foot-5-inches,
is an intimidating presence in the paint,
and may pose a difficult matchup for the
Cardinal down low. She had 12 rebounds
in last Sunday's game.
VanDerveer believes the addition of
Newlin will make a difference this year
against the Wildcats, particularly facing
Polk.
"[Last year in addition to Trotter and
Thiel covering Polk] we also played a lot
of zone defense [against Arizona], but I
think we're in a much better situation this
year with Newlin," VanDerveer said.
According to Suminski, the Cardinal
will focus on strengthening its defense
against the Wildcats.
"We expect a strong inside presence
from Arizona as well as a fast-paced
game," she said. "It is important that we
play aggressive and smart defensively."
Although Stanford has been perform
ing well from the perimeter these past few
games, Suminski emphasized the talent of
the team's post players.
"Continued good shooting will be im
portant for us, but we are not completely
dependent upon it," she said. "Our inside
game is very strong and we have a lot of
confidence in our posts."
Still, the Wheeler / Polk combo should
be a force to be reckoned with this Satur
day. Wheeler's quickness and speed com
bined with Polk's rebounding might cre
ate serious problems for the Cardinal on
both ends of the court.
Tonight's game will get underway at 7
p.m. while Saturday's showdown with
Arizona will take place at 2 p.m.
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team (11-2, 4-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
seeks to stay unbeaten in the conference
with two tough Pac-10 games looming, as
the team faces off tonight against Arizona
State and Saturday against Arizona.
Though the Cardinal is coming off two re
cent losses during winter break to No. 5
Tennessee and No. 2 Texas Tech, it is still
expected to top the conference this sea
son.
Stanford is currently 7-1 on its home
floor and is fresh off road wins against
Washington State (90-69) and Washing
ton (77-69) last weekend. Sunday's game
in Seattle saw the return of senior forward
Nicole Powell, who was out two weeks
after spraining her ankle.
"I think [Nicole] is ahead of schedule,
but it's always day-to-day with an injury
like that and when you play like she did on
Sunday it sets you back," said head coach
Tara VanDerveer.
Though she was out nine minutes to
nurse her ankle, she scored 23 points and
recorded 13 rebounds. She leads the team
in scoring with 202 points on the season.
Junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
the team's second leading scorer, tops the
Pac-10 in three-pointers with 29 to date.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin has been
making a name for herself on offense and
defense, breaking the school record with
eight blocks and averaging 2.38 per game.
While Arizona definitely poses a
greater threat for the Cardinal, the Sun
Devils are not a pushover. Arizona State is
8-4 on the season and 2-1 in conference
play, and despite finishing eighth in the
Pac-10 last year, it has returned all its
starters this season.
The Cardinal has only lost once to the
Sun Devils at Maples, holding a 21-1 home
record against ASU. Stanford beat ASU
at both meetings last season, with an 80-63
victory at Maples Pavilion and 63-53 at
Arizona State.
Still, VanDerveer won't let the team
rest on its laurels against the Sun Devils.
"When teams have the same coach,
things don't change that much, so Arizona
State will still be extremely aggressive on

defense. We must do a good job of taking
care of the ball," she said.
Arizona may be the most competitive
team in the Pac-10 after Stanford. With
an 11-3 overall record, the Wildcats are
an undefeated 3-0 in the conference, but
were bounced off the rankings after a 76-
66 loss to LSU on Jan. 4.
The Wildcats had a strong season last
year, advancing to the first round of the
NCAA Tournament and tying for second
place in the Pac-10. Three players are av
eraging double digits this year: Aimee
Gryzb (10.1), Dee-Dee Wheeler (16.9)
and Shawtinice Polk (17.2), one of the top
centers in the country.
Stanford is 19-3 against the Wildcats in
Maples and leads the series 35-11. The Car
dinal defeated Arizona twice last season
82-74 at home and 59-49 in Pac-10 Tourna
ment. The Cardinal lost to the Wildcats on
the road last year 79-64, when Wheeler and
Polk combined for 49 points and 15 re
bounds.
The loss of Powell over the break gave
the rest of the team a chance to shine.
