## Snow trips provide fun on the slopes 
### 
During the month of January,
many dorms will head out of
state on their annual snow trips,
a Stanford tradition where hun
dreds of students drive to Lake Tahoe for a

weekend in a winter
wonderland. They hit
the slopes to ski,
snowboard, sled, tak
ing advantage of some
of the best skiing in
the West. Even those
who don't enjoy win
ter sports should take
advantage of this op
portunity to escape
campus for one week
end.
This snow trip tra
dition allows students
to break out of the

Stanford bubble and lets many see a new
part of the country. Normally, students
have trouble getting off campus to go to
dinner in Palo Alto. This is an exception to
that rule. Though an expensive expentiture
of dorm funds, the Tahoe trip exposes Stan
ford students to the natural beauty of Cali

fornia.
Most importantly, this trip is a bonding
experience for the dorms that go. Dozens of
students crammed into a house breaks
down social cliques. Skiers bond with

skiers, snowboarders
make new friends with
snowboarders, and
those who stay in the
lounge enjoy the
warmth with new ac
quaintances. A socially
stagnant dorm is rejuve
nated on the shores of
Lake Tahoe.
However, students
must exhibit caution to
keep this tradition safe.
Particularly this year,
severe winter weather,
snow and avalanches

will throw many first-time skiers onto dan
gerous terrain. Students must know their
own limits and not put this tradition at risk.
At a time when many Stanford traditions
are in danger of being cancelled, students
should not make the Tahoe snow trip one of
them.
