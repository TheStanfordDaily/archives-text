# Mars landing out of this world
## 
### 
Two-thirds of all unmanned mis
sions sent to the Red Planet in the
past several decades have ulti
mately resulted in some form of
failure. Given these odds, the successful
landing of NASA's Mars rover "Spirit"
earlier this week elicited quite a stir from
the space exploration community and the
general public. Many will remember that
NASA's last Mars landing attempt four
years ago ended in disaster when the Mars
Polar Lander crashed as it approached the
martian surface. We applaud NASA for
getting the job done right this time, and we
believe that this mission will provide us
with important new information about the
planet of Mars, and may even assist in an
swering some of the pressing questions
about whether or not life has ever existed
on the red planet.
The Spirit rover has already been a suc
cess, in that it has already sent back the
highest resolution photographs ever taken
of another planet. As the mission pro
gresses and the rover is able to journey
from its landing site, hopefully NASA sci
entists will take full advantage of the
equipment that the rover is stocked with,
including its 360-degree color panoramic
photo capabilities.
Admittedly, the project has been an ex
pensive undertaking for NASA. While it
cost more than $B2O million to produce

the two identical Mars rovers the name
of the other rover is "Opportunity," which
is scheduled to land on the opposite side
of Mars on Jan. 24 it looks like the mis
sion will be well worth the cost. It is im
portant to remember that the benefits of
such a project are not limited to merely
the knowledge that will be gained from
this specific mission. As scientists grapple
with unforeseen difficulties and as engi
neers provide innovative solutions to
meet the needs for the completion of the
Mars rover project, our knowledge about
space flight and robot design are increas
ing. What we learn from Mars rover are
lessons that we will be able to apply to
subsequent missions to the Red Planet
and other ventures into space or here on
Earth that utilize similar technology.
We are glad that NASA has met its
goals so far with the Mars rover project,
and we hope that they will continue to be
similarly successful in future portions of
the mission. Increasing our knowledge
about Mars will have many important ben
efits, in that it will enhance our ability to
understand how life processes come about
and aid in answering fundamental ques
tions such as how the universe was
formed. These are issues of no small im
portance, and we tip our hats to NASA for
a so-far flawless execution in the Mars
rover mission.
