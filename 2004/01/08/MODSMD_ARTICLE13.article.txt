## ORDER IN THE COURT? Men are from ESPN, women WB 
### 
ESPN is at the center of
many a debate in my
household. Every
time I turn on
"Sports Center," I can count on
hearing the two standard com
plaints. First comes "It's al
ways on!" While this claim is
demonstrably false, I realize
that proof of its falsity is mere
ly technical. When an hour
long program, airs daily edi
tions at 3 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m.
and 11 p.m., with a re-airing of
the 11 p.m. show from 2 a.m.
until 10 a.m. the next day, it is
"always on."
The second complaint is that
"It's always the same." Again,
while this is demonstrably
false, the spirit of the comment
is probably correct. Sure, the
highlights are always from dif
ferent games, but they're al
ways the same kind of stuff:
touchdown catches, dunks,
goals, home runs, refs staring
at replay monitors, etc. Same
goes for game previews, where
it hardly matters who's play
ing. Comments such as, "if
they can go nine innings with
out giving up more runs than
they score, they'll have a fight
ing chance," are pretty much
universally applicable. To
break up the monotony, we get
the off-field news. But even
this gets fairly repetitive: drug
use, NCAA rule violations, al
cohol abuse, gambling, etc.
But I would submit that
these criticisms are not unique
to "Sports Center." Take, for
instance, my wife's main tele
visionary vice: cheesy teen
dramas. These, too, are always

on. She has been known to
delay arising from bed for
three solid hours on weekends
to get in her daily bloc of "Bev

erly Hills,
90210" reruns
on FX. Woe be
tide anyone re
sponsible for
causing our
phone to ring
during Fox's
weekly airing
(or weekly re
peat) of "The
0.C." And if
she didn't have

a job, I'm sure that viewership
of TBS' twice daily reruns of
"Dawson's Creek" would in
crease by one.
Like "Sports Center," teen
soaps are pretty much always
the same. There are always
seven or so characters five
regulars, two rotating guest
stars attending a fictional
high school that seems to as
sign absolutely no homework,
allowing them to devote all of
their attentions to their com
plicated love heptagon. Soon,
however, the show's writers re
alize that there are only a fi
nite number of diagonals they
can draw in a heptagon es
pecially when gender con
straints limit the number of
possible pairings. They then
start trying to supplement the
romance with subplots, which
they create by walking around
the heptagon and assigning
each character a random afflic
tion from their grab bag of
cliche problems: drug use, aca
demic infractions, alcohol

abuse, gambling . . . Sound fa
miliar? (Okay, athletes rarely
dither publicly over whether to
sacrifice their virginity. But
you see my point.)
I think there's a reason why
teen soaps and "Sports Center"
have so many similarities:
Sports is basically just a social
ly acceptable soap opera for
guys. While we are not sup
posed to care whether Jen's
upset that Dawson would real
ly rather be dating Joey, we are
almost required to have an
opinion as to whether Nomar
Garciaparra feels jilted by
Boston's aborted attempt to
trade him away and acquire
Alex Rodriguez.
But why should my Y chro
mosome mean that I'm only al
lowed to care about human
drama when it comes in the
context of a contest involving
an oblong spheroid made of
pigskin? It's high time I
dropped these sexist predispo
sitions and approached small
screen adolescent angst with
an open mind. This Sunday,
I'm going to sit in bed and
watch three straight hours of
"90210."
Oh, wait . . . that conflicts
with the Colts-Chiefs playoff
game. On second thought,
maybe I'll wait until after the
Super Bowl.

Eric Feigin remains convinced
that Joey should have picked
Dawson instead of Pacey. If
you'd like to argue the point,

ESPN is at the center of
many a debate in my
household. Every
time I turn on
"Sports Center," I can count on
hearing the two standard com
plaints. First comes "It's al
ways on!" While this claim is
demonstrably false, I realize
that proof of its falsity is mere
ly technical. When an hour
long program, airs daily edi
tions at 3 p.m., 8 p.m., 10 p.m.
and 11 p.m., with a re-airing of
the 11 p.m. show from 2 a.m.
until 10 a.m. the next day, it is
"always on."
The second complaint is that
"It's always the same." Again,
while this is demonstrably
false, the spirit of the comment
is probably correct. Sure, the
highlights are always from dif
ferent games, but they're al
ways the same kind of stuff:
touchdown catches, dunks,
goals, home runs, refs staring
at replay monitors, etc. Same
goes for game previews, where
it hardly matters who's play
ing. Comments such as, "if
they can go nine innings with
out giving up more runs than
they score, they'll have a fight
ing chance," are pretty much
universally applicable. To
break up the monotony, we get
the off-field news. But even
this gets fairly repetitive: drug
use, NCAA rule violations, al
cohol abuse, gambling, etc.
But I would submit that
these criticisms are not unique
to "Sports Center." Take, for
instance, my wife's main tele
visionary vice: cheesy teen
dramas. These, too, are always

on. She has been known to
delay arising from bed for
three solid hours on weekends
to get in her daily bloc of "Bev

erly Hills,
90210" reruns
on FX. Woe be
tide anyone re
sponsible for
causing our
phone to ring
during Fox's
weekly airing
(or weekly re
peat) of "The
0.C." And if
she didn't have

a job, I'm sure that viewership
of TBS' twice daily reruns of
"Dawson's Creek" would in
crease by one.
Like "Sports Center," teen
soaps are pretty much always
the same. There are always
seven or so characters five
regulars, two rotating guest
stars attending a fictional
high school that seems to as
sign absolutely no homework,
allowing them to devote all of
their attentions to their com
plicated love heptagon. Soon,
however, the show's writers re
alize that there are only a fi
nite number of diagonals they
can draw in a heptagon es
pecially when gender con
straints limit the number of
possible pairings. They then
start trying to supplement the
romance with subplots, which
they create by walking around
the heptagon and assigning
each character a random afflic
tion from their grab bag of
cliche problems: drug use, aca
demic infractions, alcohol

abuse, gambling . . . Sound fa
miliar? (Okay, athletes rarely
dither publicly over whether to
sacrifice their virginity. But
you see my point.)
I think there's a reason why
teen soaps and "Sports Center"
have so many similarities:
Sports is basically just a social
ly acceptable soap opera for
guys. While we are not sup
posed to care whether Jen's
upset that Dawson would real
ly rather be dating Joey, we are
almost required to have an
opinion as to whether Nomar
Garciaparra feels jilted by
Boston's aborted attempt to
trade him away and acquire
Alex Rodriguez.
But why should my Y chro
mosome mean that I'm only al
lowed to care about human
drama when it comes in the
context of a contest involving
an oblong spheroid made of
pigskin? It's high time I
dropped these sexist predispo
sitions and approached small
screen adolescent angst with
an open mind. This Sunday,
I'm going to sit in bed and
watch three straight hours of
"90210."
Oh, wait . . . that conflicts
with the Colts-Chiefs playoff
game. On second thought,
maybe I'll wait until after the
Super Bowl.
