# OUT OF AFRICA
## All the way from hair to there 
### MEKLIT WORKNEH 
We braid it, cornrow it,
plait it, dread it, straighten it,
relax it, flat iron it, curl it, put
in extensions, put in a weave,
fade it and grow out an afro.
What do we NOT do to our
hair?
Hair may seem like a simple
feature to many people. How
ever, I've noticed that hair has
turned into a feature with so
cial and political issues sur
rounding it. Watching movies
like "Barbershop," I began to
notice to a larger extent how
central a role hair plays in
many communities. It goes
without saying that in African
and African diasporic commu
nities, actual hair and the pro
cess of doing hair provide
plenty of stimuli for conversa
tion and social gathering.
When I first moved to the
United States and to Stanford,
one of the points I could im
mediately relate to other black
students on was hair. For one,
I discovered that a lot of us
shopped at that whole sepa
rate aisle at Wal-Mart for
"ethnic hair products". Hair is
a point of commonality across
Africa and the African diaspo
ra.
I can trace back my first
memories of awareness of my
own hair to the day I got my
first Barbie. I must have been
4 or 5 years old. This Barbie
had long, straight blond hair
like most dolls that were avail
able on the market at that
time. (This was always a point
of confusion for me growing
up in Ethiopia since I was al
ways busy trying to figure out
why their hair did not look the
way mine did.)
As soon as my mom gave me
the doll, she told me not to put
her in water because that
would ruin her hair. And right
after my mom left, I plunged
the doll in water and her hair
came out looking very
raggedy. Then, I asked my
aunt to help me blowdry and
straighten it before my mom
came back. I'm still not sure
what compelled me to do that,
but I do know that it shows a

level of awareness and under
standing about the importance
of hair in the society I was
raised in. That doll was to go
through several forms of tor
ture in my possession, eventu
ally having all her hair shaved
off and her head pulled off her
neck. Needless to say, my
mother was not impressed with
the way I handled my toys.
The hair issue also came up
in a more academic setting, my
Popular Culture in Africa
class. Looking at ads circa the
1960s advertising hair perms
and relaxers, we came up with
the idea that by straightening,
relaxing or perming their hair,
black people were trying to
appear white.
Growing up in Ethiopia, issues
dealing with race had never
played a major role in my life.
After my first year in the Unit
ed States, however, I found
myself reflecting a great deal
more upon racial matters.
When describing the United
States to people back home, I
often found myself using the
word "racialized." The hair
issue became a sub-category of
this racialization.
In my classes at Stanford,
Madam C.J. Walker was laud
ed for being the first African-
American woman en
trepreneur and millionaire,
but criticized for creating hair
products that further led to a
dislike of typically "African"
traits among African-Ameri
cans. And I was thinking: Hold
up, I know I have a perm in my
hair and I straighten it occa
sionally, does that mean I'm
trying to appear white? I knew
there was no such intention in
the back of my head. So what
were these people talking
about?
A girl in my Popular Cul
ture in Africa class broke it
down for me that fateful day
when we were discussing those
ads. I realized that I straighten
my hair for the same reason
that I braid it or leave it curly
. . . because I like the way it
looks! There is no deeper psy
chological process to this, it's
pure and simple popular cul
ture. I don't know what the

roots to this "fashion" were.
But regardless of roots and
origins, black hair fashion
today is not an imitation or
fabrication; it is its own entity
unlike anything before. It
evolves with the times and is
sometimes a reflection of the
times and other times it just
looks good.
The 70s brought the black
power movement and Afros
worldwide from New York to
Paris to Dakar. The 80s and
90s brought the popularization
of a spiritual pan-African con
sciousness and dreadlocks be
came popular. 90s hip-hop cul
ture made cornrows accept
able as a fashionable hairstyle,
and not just a hairstyle for
those bum days. And although
a lot of these hairstyles and
dos can be traced back to what
people on the African conti
nent have done for centuries
each generation had added its
own twist and flair to make
black hair what it is today.
Love it or hate it, hair is more
than just fashion in today's
world. It is social, cultural, po
litical, you name it. And that is
what makes it all the more in
teresting. Entire political
statements are made through
hair (think dreadlocks in the
Rastafarian movement). Like
in the film "Barbershop," it
provides a setting for social
and intellectual gathering.
We don't even have to look
further than Stanford's cam
pus to find a place where hair
cutting provides such a set
ting. Esface, a hair-cutting
business founded by Stanford
undergraduates, provides the
same sort of environment for
the Stanford community. All I
know is next time I go to have
my hair braided, straightened
or twisted, I'm going to look
into it a little deeper.

For the first time at Stanford,
junior Meklit Workneh re
cently straightened her hair
instead of wearing it curly.
