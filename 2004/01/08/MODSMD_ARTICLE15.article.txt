## Kimyacioglu regains sharpshooting stroke 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
l-for-6 from beyond the arc against Fordham. 1-
for-5 against Boston. 0-for-5 versus Georgia. And 0-
for-4 in Stanford's matchup with then-No. 2 Ten
nessee not statistics that the Cardinal's three point
specialist, junior Sebnem Kimyacioglu, is used to see
ing in the boxscore when she leaves the floor.
It was a slump the Mountain View native had never
endured before in her entire career.
"That's the biggest slump I've ever had. Last year,
toward the end of the season I had a little slump,
where my shot was a little flat. But it was nothing like
this one," Kimyacioglu said. "I'm just glad I got it out
of the way at the beginning of the season because I
don't think it will happen to me like that again."
Kimyacioglu had previously put up gaudy numbers
from downtown.
As a sophomore, the sharpshooter sank 70 shots
from beyond the arc tying for seventh on Stan
ford's single season list. Kimyacioglu's deadly accura
cy continued on the team's September trip to Italy, av
eraging 18.6 points in five games and capping things
off with a 7-for-10 performance from three-point-land
in the Cardinal's final game.

However, things started going downhill once the
regular season began in early November. Kimya
cioglu attributed the problems to her mentality rather
than any kind of mechanical problem.
"I think I was thinking about [my shot] too much,"
she said. "I needed to just get into a flow and shoot it.
It was frustrating because you expect your shot to go
in and I know I can do it, but it wasn't happening."
After a month of regular season play had passed,
Kimyacioglu's shot still wasn't falling and the entire
team was saddled with more pressure with All-Amer
ican Nicole Powell out of the lineup with a sprained
ankle. Kimyacioglu then did the only thing left to do
spend even more time in the gym and it certain

ly seems to be paying off.
In the first game of Powell's absence, Kimyacioglu
proved she has a knack for stepping up her game when
it's really needed. The forward led Stanford in its
domination of Oregon State, finishing with a career
high 24 points on 7-for-13 shooting while adding three
assists.
"Having confidence in myself that I can make the
shot and just going into the gym and getting repeti
tions in helped a lot," she said. "That's the main thing
that got me out of it."
The junior kept her hot streak going on Stanford's
recent trip to take on Washington and Washington
State. In the Cardinal's final game without Powell, a
90-69 victory over the Cougars, Kimyacioglu had 15
points on 5-of-10 shooting.
She had a seamless transition upon Powell's return
to the lineup, with a 16-point output in the Cardinal's
second win of the weekend at an especially difficult
place to play the Huskies' Bank of America Arena
in front of a crowd of almost 6,000 hostile fans. At
one critical point in the game Kimyacioglu hit back
to-back three-pointers, leading to big groans from the
crowd each time the ball touched her hands beyond
the three-point line.
"I didn't really hear them make any noise," Kimy
acioglu said. "It seemed like they just went quiet to
me, but silencing the crowd is the best thing you can
do. It takes the energy out of the gym and also out of
the other team."
Despite averaging 15.8 points in the past four
games, Kimyacioglu feels that her shot still isn't where
she wants it to be yet.
"I'm feeling pretty comfortable, but I think I still
have room for improvement, especially on shots
where I'm coming off screens and I need to get myself
set a little more."
Her shot will continue to be contested tonight and
Saturday against two aggressive defenses in Arizona
State and Arizona, respectively.

it's really needed. The forward led Stanford in its
domination of Oregon State, finishing with a career
high 24 points on 7-for-13 shooting while adding three
assists.
"Having confidence in myself that I can make the
shot and just going into the gym and getting repeti
tions in helped a lot," she said. "That's the main thing
that got me out of it."
The junior kept her hot streak going on Stanford's
recent trip to take on Washington and Washington
State. In the Cardinal's final game without Powell, a
90-69 victory over the Cougars, Kimyacioglu had 15
points on 5-of-10 shooting.
She had a seamless transition upon Powell's return
to the lineup, with a 16-point output in the Cardinal's
second win of the weekend at an especially difficult
place to play the Huskies' Bank of America Arena
in front of a crowd of almost 6,000 hostile fans. At
one critical point in the game Kimyacioglu hit back
to-back three-pointers, leading to big groans from the
crowd each time the ball touched her hands beyond
the three-point line.
"I didn't really hear them make any noise," Kimy
acioglu said. "It seemed like they just went quiet to
me, but silencing the crowd is the best thing you can
do. It takes the energy out of the gym and also out of
the other team."
Despite averaging 15.8 points in the past four
games, Kimyacioglu feels that her shot still isn't where
she wants it to be yet.
"I'm feeling pretty comfortable, but I think I still
have room for improvement, especially on shots
where I'm coming off screens and I need to get myself
set a little more."
Her shot will continue to be contested tonight and
Saturday against two aggressive defenses in Arizona
State and Arizona, respectively.
