# Women's gymnastics opens year with best preseason ranking ever
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
The 2004 women's gymnastics team is packing
a powerful one-two-three-four-five punch this
season, giving the No. 6 Cardinal its highest pre
season ranking ever. With talent and leadership
cultivated in their three-plus years on The Farm,
seniors Lindsay Wing, Caroline Fluhrer, Lise
Leveille, Shelly Goldberg and Kendall Beck
could be the ones to lead the gymnastics team to
its first-ever national team championship.
Since they arrived at Stanford, these five
gymnasts have racked up four NCAA region
al championships, seven Pacific-10 Confer
ence championships and 10 All-America hon
ors. They have helped the Cardinal qualify
for nationals three years in a row and for a
Super Six competition for the first time in
team history.
Entering their last season, they are hungry for
more.
"Part of their motivation every day, the way
that they are accountable to one another every
day and the way that they bring such a strong
work ethic to the gym every day stem from a de
sire to win a national championship," coach Kris
ten Smyth said.
"Given health, I think the sky is the limit for
this team," Smyth added.
The Cardinal open their season with the Stan
ford Quadrangular meet tomorrow in Burnham
Pavillion.
Having graduated only two competing seniors
last year, this year's team is loaded with experi
ence.
"The program is on the rise and getting better
all the time," Smyth said. "Our five seniors have
been instrumental in getting us to the point

where we are recognized as one the top six teams
in the nation."
The five seniors serve as the team's leaders in
and out of the gym. Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer are captains this year, but all the seniors
have assumed leadership roles.
According to Fluhrer, who won the team's
"Most Inspirational" award in 2002, being a
leader on this team is not such a difficult job.
"Everyone is a leader on this team and has
found their niche," Fluhrer said. "We work hard
and we have fun."
The seniors have also been successful in the
classroom, with all five being named to the Pac
-10 Conference All-Academic Team last year.
Goldberg, who will be focusing on vault and
beam this year, recorded a GPA of 3.96 in me
chanical engineering.
The team is also expecting strong contribu
tions from the team's three sophomores: Natalie
Foley and Glyn Sweets, who were named Ail-
Americans as rookies last year, and Jessica
Louie.
Last year, the team fell short of making the
Super Six, the final day of competition for the
national championship. That memory has stuck
with the team for months.
"Watching the Super Six meet had a tremen
dous impact on the team," Smyth said. "It really
inspired them to work on the things we need to
improve on to make it to a Super Six."
"Watching the Super Six also lit a little fire
under them," Smyth continued. "They came
back extremely motivated, especially the senior
class, to do great things to make history."
At the Stanford Quadrangular tomorrow, the
Cardinal will be competing against San Jose
State, Sacramento State and Central Michigan.
The other home meets this season will pit the

Cardinal against Arizona, Washington and Cali
fornia.
Tomorrow's meet promises to be fun for fans
since all four teams will be competing at the
same time: "It's like a three-ring circus," Smyth
said.
The meet is also "Dorm Night" for student
fans. The dorm that brings the most fans to the
meet will win one hour of open gym to tumble
and bounce around in the Ford Center where the
team practices. The loudest cheering section will
also be awarded the college student's heart's de
light: free pizza.
The team will debut several new floor rou
tines at the meet, and its tumbling has benefited
from a new Palmer floor installed in the practice
gym. Balance beam should be strong as in past
years, with the talent and consistency of Wing
and Leveille leading the way.
Amid talk of challenging meet schedules,
team leadership and national championships,
some of the seniors simply want to enjoy their
last season on the team.
"My main goal is to enjoy competing, being
with the girls and being with the coaches," Lev
eille said. "Because after this season, I won't
have another one."
Leveille recounted the memory of being a
freshman and staying up until 5 a.m. talking to a
senior team member about life and the changes
freshmen go through. Over this past winter
break, Leveille and Beck were the seniors stay
ing up late and talking to freshman Stacy Spran
do.
"It was really neat to see the roles reversed
and share my own experiences," Leveille said.
Only time will tell how far these seniors can
take the Cardinal, but it certainly appears that
the team is in good hands.
