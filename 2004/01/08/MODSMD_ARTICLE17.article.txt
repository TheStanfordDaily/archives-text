# Maisy ponders the meaning of seemingly meaningless sports
## 
### 
UfH ports are completely meaning
less," a recent Stanford gradu-
said to me as I flipped to
IC/ ESPN'S Sportscenter. "I can't

believe you actually care about
them."
His comment was not entirely off
the mark. Sports are not exactly
brimming with intrinsic meaning.
What is so significant about tossing
a ball through a hoop, or completing
a pass to an open teammate?
Of course, athleticism does have
aesthetic value. The image of
Michael Jordan taking off from the
foul line to dunk is permanently en

graved in my mind. Yet dunking a basketball
does not exactly provoke profound reflec
tion, as great art is wont to do.
The reasons for playing sports are obvi
ous, but why does the average American
male spend the equivalent of 21 days per
year watching them?
Psychologists would probably say that
games provide an outlet for human aggres
sion and indulge our thirst for battle with
out the adverse consequences of war. Strate
gies, I agree, help make sports interesting.

We watch athletes make split-second deci
sions that determine the outcome of the play
or the game (ask Chris Webber how many
timeouts his team has left).

Sports also connect communities by
creating a collective pool of experi
ence they provide fodder for dis
cussion and a unifying experience with
family as well as complete strangers.
But is it too elitist to wonder why books
couldn't serve the same function?
"I hate talk about athletes being
mentally tough," my friend continued.
"I would like to see any of these ath
letes write an intelligent word let alone
speak one."

He implicitly questions whether sports re
ward appropriate values. How can the adula
tion that the American public pours onto its
top athletes be justified under any reasonable
ethical or intellectual code of values?
Becoming a great athlete surely requires
astonishing determination and dedication, in
addition to natural talent. But dedication to
what? Spending 45 hours per week on a bike
like Lance Armstrong could be construed as
self-indulgent instead of inspirational.
If watching sports is mere entertainment

equivalent to playing video games or watching
soap operas then why do we care so much
about the outcome? Why do we attach our hopes
and dreams to a particular team? Aren't we just
watching the same old theatrical performance
over and over, mesmerized by a social opium?
Perhaps I should love the Boston Celtics
just because I once pretended to be Larry Bird
and Dennis Johnson on the playground of my
childhood. Or because my father took me to
Celtics games in the old Boston Garden, just
so I would have the opportunity to see Larry
Bird play in person an opportunity nearly
thwarted by our "obstructed view" seats. But I
feel less affinity with current Celtics guard
Ricky Davis a player who last season pur
posely missed a shot at his own basket in an (il
legal) attempt to record a triple-double
than I do with a vegetable.
It is becoming more difficult to identify
with athletes whose allegiance to the dollar
often seems to surpass their professed alle
giance to their team. Players trade in uniforms
as often as they trade in cars, while owners
seek to buy championships.
We five in the era of "rent-a-team" where
last year's team may bear no relationship to
this year's. The predominant value demon

strated by most professional sports teams
seems to be: "If you can't win it, buy it."
Athletes tell their agents to get them trad
ed to a team that has a shot at a championship.
So Ray Bourque ends his hockey career with a
Stanley Cup in Colorado after being Boston's
"Mr. Hockey" for his entire career. Persever
ance, selflessness, team play, accepting the
outcome with equanimity knowing it's only a
game. Or self-promotion, self-aggrandize
ment, self-absorption, the feeling that hard
work and talent must have their reward. What
are the moral imperatives here?
There is nothing intrinsic to sports that nec
essarily promotes moral virtue. While many
athletes do display extraordinary grace,
courage, selflessness, others act arrogantly
and selfishly. I have had a hard time getting
excited about Randy Moss's athletic ability
after he admitted to not trying on some plays.
So what if he occasionally makes a spectacu
lar play. Who cares if he wins?
I cared about the outcome of the Red
Sox-Yankees series this fall only because my
fellow Bostonians cared so much. I manufac
tured meaning. Fans do it all the time. They
identify with teams based on the symbolic
value of the name on the jersey.

But real meaning is infinitely more inspir
ing than manufactured meaning. So I don't
watch sports for the symbolic significance of
the name on the jersey. Instead, I root for
athletes and teams that display values I can
appreciate, such as Justine Henin-Hardenne,
a willowy 5-foot-6-inch tennis player who
willed her way to victory over the much more
powerful Jennifer Capriati in the French
Open semifinal and then gracefully dedicat
ed her win to her mother in heaven.
The sport of cycling doesn't mean much
to me, but Lance Armstrong's story does
because it reminds me that perseverance and
determination apply equally to fighting the
French Alps and fighting cancer.
Former Stanford players Jamila Wide
man and Kate Starbird could never jump as
high as their male counterparts, but they dis
played vulnerability and humanness that
made watching them significant.
And, while Jennifer Capriati sulked off
the court following her loss to Henin-
Hardenne in the French Open semifinals,
Kim Clijsters accepted defeat in the finals
with grace and a smile. Perhaps she under
stood that winning isn't everything how
you behave matters too.

game. Or self-promotion, self-aggrandize
ment, self-absorption, the feeling that hard
work and talent must have their reward. What
are the moral imperatives here?
There is nothing intrinsic to sports that nec
essarily promotes moral virtue. While many
athletes do display extraordinary grace,
courage, selflessness, others act arrogantly
and selfishly. I have had a hard time getting
excited about Randy Moss's athletic ability
after he admitted to not trying on some plays.
So what if he occasionally makes a spectacu
lar play. Who cares if he wins?
I cared about the outcome of the Red
Sox-Yankees series this fall only because my
fellow Bostonians cared so much. I manufac
tured meaning. Fans do it all the time. They
identify with teams based on the symbolic
value of the name on the jersey.

But real meaning is infinitely more inspir
ing than manufactured meaning. So I don't
watch sports for the symbolic significance of
the name on the jersey. Instead, I root for
athletes and teams that display values I can
appreciate, such as Justine Henin-Hardenne,
a willowy 5-foot-6-inch tennis player who
willed her way to victory over the much more
powerful Jennifer Capriati in the French
Open semifinal and then gracefully dedicat
ed her win to her mother in heaven.
The sport of cycling doesn't mean much
to me, but Lance Armstrong's story does
because it reminds me that perseverance and
determination apply equally to fighting the
French Alps and fighting cancer.
Former Stanford players Jamila Wide
man and Kate Starbird could never jump as
high as their male counterparts, but they dis
played vulnerability and humanness that
made watching them significant.
And, while Jennifer Capriati sulked off
the court following her loss to Henin-
Hardenne in the French Open semifinals,
Kim Clijsters accepted defeat in the finals
with grace and a smile. Perhaps she under
stood that winning isn't everything how
you behave matters too.

UfH ports are completely meaning
less," a recent Stanford gradu-
said to me as I flipped to
IC/ ESPN'S Sportscenter. "I can't

believe you actually care about
them."
His comment was not entirely off
the mark. Sports are not exactly
brimming with intrinsic meaning.
What is so significant about tossing
a ball through a hoop, or completing
a pass to an open teammate?
Of course, athleticism does have
aesthetic value. The image of
Michael Jordan taking off from the
foul line to dunk is permanently en

graved in my mind. Yet dunking a basketball
does not exactly provoke profound reflec
tion, as great art is wont to do.
The reasons for playing sports are obvi
ous, but why does the average American
male spend the equivalent of 21 days per
year watching them?
Psychologists would probably say that
games provide an outlet for human aggres
sion and indulge our thirst for battle with
out the adverse consequences of war. Strate
gies, I agree, help make sports interesting.

We watch athletes make split-second deci
sions that determine the outcome of the play
or the game (ask Chris Webber how many
timeouts his team has left).

Sports also connect communities by
creating a collective pool of experi
ence they provide fodder for dis
cussion and a unifying experience with
family as well as complete strangers.
But is it too elitist to wonder why books
couldn't serve the same function?
"I hate talk about athletes being
mentally tough," my friend continued.
"I would like to see any of these ath
letes write an intelligent word let alone
speak one."

He implicitly questions whether sports re
ward appropriate values. How can the adula
tion that the American public pours onto its
top athletes be justified under any reasonable
ethical or intellectual code of values?
Becoming a great athlete surely requires
astonishing determination and dedication, in
addition to natural talent. But dedication to
what? Spending 45 hours per week on a bike
like Lance Armstrong could be construed as
self-indulgent instead of inspirational.
If watching sports is mere entertainment

equivalent to playing video games or watching
soap operas then why do we care so much
about the outcome? Why do we attach our hopes
and dreams to a particular team? Aren't we just
watching the same old theatrical performance
over and over, mesmerized by a social opium?
Perhaps I should love the Boston Celtics
just because I once pretended to be Larry Bird
and Dennis Johnson on the playground of my
childhood. Or because my father took me to
Celtics games in the old Boston Garden, just
so I would have the opportunity to see Larry
Bird play in person an opportunity nearly
thwarted by our "obstructed view" seats. But I
feel less affinity with current Celtics guard
Ricky Davis a player who last season pur
posely missed a shot at his own basket in an (il
legal) attempt to record a triple-double
than I do with a vegetable.
It is becoming more difficult to identify
with athletes whose allegiance to the dollar
often seems to surpass their professed alle
giance to their team. Players trade in uniforms
as often as they trade in cars, while owners
seek to buy championships.
We five in the era of "rent-a-team" where
last year's team may bear no relationship to
this year's. The predominant value demon

strated by most professional sports teams
seems to be: "If you can't win it, buy it."
Athletes tell their agents to get them trad
ed to a team that has a shot at a championship.
So Ray Bourque ends his hockey career with a
Stanley Cup in Colorado after being Boston's
"Mr. Hockey" for his entire career. Persever
ance, selflessness, team play, accepting the
outcome with equanimity knowing it's only a
game. Or self-promotion, self-aggrandize
ment, self-absorption, the feeling that hard
work and talent must have their reward. What
