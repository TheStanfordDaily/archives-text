# Stop the presses: BCS madness is solved once and for all
## 
### 
You can run, but you can't hide from
the uproar surrounding college
football's imperfect Bowl Champi
onship Series, which will linger into

next season like the fear of mad cow
disease after LSU and USC were
crowned co-national champions last
week.
BCS-bashers have repeatedly
cried foul over the past few weeks
and it nobody has been spared the
far-reaching whining of college
football analysts and fans alike.
On my flight to San Jose this
weekend, for example, I sat next to a

little boy who proudly proclaimed he just
learned the alphabet and then proceeded to
sing, "B-C-S-D-E-F-G ..." OK, so not real
ly, but it could happen.
Some critics paint the BCS as a system in
such dire need of a makeover that the Fab
Five from "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"
couldn't rescue the six-year old beast.
Sure, it's a bit absurd that this year's BCS
title game failed to produce a legitimate na

tional champion. It seems unfair that over 50
Division-I schools can't qualify for one of the
four BCS bowl games no matter their record.
Yes, the structure of the BCS is designed to

distribute large sums of money to the
power conferences and shut out col
lege football's little guys.
My biggest problem with all the
controversy surrounding this year's
BC-Mess, however, is the lesson inno
cent little children across America are
taking from it: Sharing is wrong. And
bad!
What's the problem with splitting
the national title anyway? The writers

say USC, the computers say LSU. Honestly,
both teams have legitimate cases for why
they should be No. 1, and if either team had
run the table, there would be no debate
whatsoever.
Everyone seems to think they have the so
lution for improving the system from im
plementing a playoff format to adding a fifth
game to the existing BCS bowls but the
odds of the system changing significantly be

fore 2006 are about as good as stat-geek Jeff
Sagarin, whose ratings are one component of
the BCS rankings, going on a date with some
one without a hard drive for a brain.
The BCS powers that be claim they are
opposed to a playoff because it would cut
into final exam periods. BCS Chairman
Mike Tranghese was even quoted as saying
that if a playoff format were used, "Gradua
tion rates would go down." Right, and limit
ing teams to a 10-game regular season sched
ule would cause graduation rates at schools
to skyrocket. Many top-notch football pro
grams have graduation rates lower than 10
percent as it is.
Pretending for a moment that the BCS re
ally isn't about the money, but rather doing
what's best for the academic well-being of
the athletes, the answer to this year's sticky
situation is questions.
That's right, a 10-question quiz adminis
tered to every LSU and USC player to de
cide once and for all which football team
boasts the nation's superior student-athletes.
With the full-month layoff from the end of

the regular season to the Sugar Bowl, stu
dent-athletes can hit the books. I've even
gone so far as to draft up an example of what
this year's quiz might have looked like:
1. What is your first name?
2. What is your last name?
3. What team do you play for?
4. What is your coach's name? (Note:
'Coach,' 'Sir' or 'Boss' will not suffice.)
5. If Heisman trophy winner Jason White
threw for three touchdowns and ran for
two more, how many total touchdowns did
he account for?
6. Who won the Heisman trophy this
year? (Hint: He accounted for five touch
downs in the previous question.)
7. What company sponsors the Sugar Bowl?
8. Touchdown: 6 Field Goal: ?
9. Where is the Las Vegas Bowl played?
(Hint: Think prostitutes.)
10. Spell BCS in the space provided.

Free Response: How would you change
the BCS? (This question will not be counted
toward your score, but the BCS presidents

would appreciate your input.)
See? It's simple. Administer the test.
Total the individual scores and award the na
tional title to the team with the highest aver
age score. The best part is that there's abso
lutely no computer element involved.
In all seriousness, I suppose I'd feel more
passionate about realistically revamping the
current system if Stanford had so much as
qualified for the Insight Bowl.
But, lest you forget, it doesn't take a com
puter to tell you that the Cardinal doubled its
win total this season from last. With a win
tonight in Tempe, the Stanford men's basket
ball team will have sextupled that number in
only their 12th game. Sagarin has nothing on
me, and the BCS, no matter how it's changed,
will never hold a candle to March Madness.

Scott Allen scored an eight out of 10 on his
own BCS quiz, which places him in the 99th
percentile. Think you've got a better solution

the uproar surrounding college
football's imperfect Bowl Champi
onship Series, which will linger into

next season like the fear of mad cow
disease after LSU and USC were
crowned co-national champions last
week.
BCS-bashers have repeatedly
cried foul over the past few weeks
and it nobody has been spared the
far-reaching whining of college
football analysts and fans alike.
On my flight to San Jose this
weekend, for example, I sat next to a

little boy who proudly proclaimed he just
learned the alphabet and then proceeded to
sing, "B-C-S-D-E-F-G ..." OK, so not real
ly, but it could happen.
Some critics paint the BCS as a system in
such dire need of a makeover that the Fab
Five from "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"
couldn't rescue the six-year old beast.
Sure, it's a bit absurd that this year's BCS
title game failed to produce a legitimate na

tional champion. It seems unfair that over 50
Division-I schools can't qualify for one of the
four BCS bowl games no matter their record.
Yes, the structure of the BCS is designed to

distribute large sums of money to the
power conferences and shut out col
lege football's little guys.
My biggest problem with all the
controversy surrounding this year's
BC-Mess, however, is the lesson inno
cent little children across America are
taking from it: Sharing is wrong. And
bad!
What's the problem with splitting
the national title anyway? The writers

say USC, the computers say LSU. Honestly,
both teams have legitimate cases for why
they should be No. 1, and if either team had
run the table, there would be no debate
whatsoever.
Everyone seems to think they have the so
lution for improving the system from im
plementing a playoff format to adding a fifth
game to the existing BCS bowls but the
odds of the system changing significantly be

fore 2006 are about as good as stat-geek Jeff
Sagarin, whose ratings are one component of
the BCS rankings, going on a date with some
one without a hard drive for a brain.
The BCS powers that be claim they are
opposed to a playoff because it would cut
into final exam periods. BCS Chairman
Mike Tranghese was even quoted as saying
that if a playoff format were used, "Gradua
tion rates would go down." Right, and limit
ing teams to a 10-game regular season sched
ule would cause graduation rates at schools
to skyrocket. Many top-notch football pro
grams have graduation rates lower than 10
percent as it is.
Pretending for a moment that the BCS re
ally isn't about the money, but rather doing
what's best for the academic well-being of
the athletes, the answer to this year's sticky
situation is questions.
That's right, a 10-question quiz adminis
tered to every LSU and USC player to de
cide once and for all which football team
boasts the nation's superior student-athletes.
With the full-month layoff from the end of

the regular season to the Sugar Bowl, stu
dent-athletes can hit the books. I've even
gone so far as to draft up an example of what
this year's quiz might have looked like:
1. What is your first name?
2. What is your last name?
3. What team do you play for?
4. What is your coach's name? (Note:
'Coach,' 'Sir' or 'Boss' will not suffice.)
5. If Heisman trophy winner Jason White
threw for three touchdowns and ran for
two more, how many total touchdowns did
he account for?
6. Who won the Heisman trophy this
year? (Hint: He accounted for five touch
downs in the previous question.)
7. What company sponsors the Sugar Bowl?
8. Touchdown: 6 Field Goal: ?
9. Where is the Las Vegas Bowl played?
(Hint: Think prostitutes.)
10. Spell BCS in the space provided.

Free Response: How would you change
the BCS? (This question will not be counted
toward your score, but the BCS presidents

would appreciate your input.)
See? It's simple. Administer the test.
Total the individual scores and award the na
tional title to the team with the highest aver
age score. The best part is that there's abso
lutely no computer element involved.
In all seriousness, I suppose I'd feel more
passionate about realistically revamping the
current system if Stanford had so much as
qualified for the Insight Bowl.
But, lest you forget, it doesn't take a com
puter to tell you that the Cardinal doubled its
win total this season from last. With a win
tonight in Tempe, the Stanford men's basket
ball team will have sextupled that number in
only their 12th game. Sagarin has nothing on
me, and the BCS, no matter how it's changed,
will never hold a candle to March Madness.

Scott Allen scored an eight out of 10 on his
own BCS quiz, which places him in the 99th
percentile. Think you've got a better solution
to fix the BCS? E-mail someone else. To dis
