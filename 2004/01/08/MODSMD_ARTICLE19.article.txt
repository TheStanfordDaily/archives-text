COLUMBUS, Ohio (U-WIRE)
Since signing Senate Bill 57 into
law the failure to disperse act
in December, Ohio Gov. Bob Taft is
looking to law enforcement and
Ohio State University officials to en
force and educate people about the
new law.
"He's hopeful that local police
will work with university administra
tors to inform people attending the
university of the change in law," said
Orest Holubec, spokesman for Taft.
Besides spreading awareness

through media outlets, Columbus,
Ohio police will warn violent or ri
otous individuals of the law before
making arrests.
"We'd give the warning, and then
we'd remove troublemakers and in
stigators," said Mike Weinman, leg
islative liaison for the Columbus Di
vision of Police. "Hopefully, folks
standing around will leave the area.
It's really practical for celebratory
riots."
The law will also aid law enforce
ment during emergency situations,
so they may maintain order around
crime and fire scenes.
"Fortunately, we don't have that

often carrying on at a fire scene
but we do at crime scenes," Wein
man said. "We can use it as a last re
sort if people try to crash crime
scenes."
The public sometimes does not
realize the importance of preserving
a crime scene, he said.
If individuals fail to disperse, the
law has increased the violation from
a minor misdemeanor to a fourth-de
gree misdemeanor and thus permits
police officers to arrest incompliant
individuals rather than simply fining
them.
"It's kind of fruitless for police of
ficers to stop and write tickets," said

Chris Ingram, legislative aide for
state Sen. Jeff Jacobson, who spon
sored the bill. "[The law] enables po
lice officers to notify people in the
way to evacuate the area."
Violators face a maximum of 30
days in jail and a $250 fine.
"Our hands were tied trying to
prove a riot," said Sergeant Brent
Mull, spokesman for the Columbus
Division of Police. "It was putting the
community at risk."
Previously, officers had to prove
that four or more people were in
volved in riotous behavior. Now,
they can arrest individuals.
"[Governor] Taft believes the bill

has been designed to protect law en
forcement," Holubec said. "The riots
and unfortunate aftermath played a
role in his signing of the bill."
Jacobson, R-Butler Township,
introduced the bill in March 2003
with the OSU riots in mind, but
other riots at Ohio University and
the University of Cincinnati oc
curred during the bill's legislative
process, Ingram said.
Some professionals see potential
holes in the legislation.
"It's a 'Dragnet' type of law," said
David Goldberger, professor of law
at OSU. It's like when you're catch
ing a fish with a net, you catch every

thing else. You're not just dealing
with certain people; you're dealing
with everyone in the vicinity. It gives
police the ability to arrest people
who have not done anything wrong."
Goldberger acknowledged the
law enforcement's responsibility to
maintain order and control, but he
believes the law should only apply to
emergency situations.
"These kinds of laws are used at
the discretion of the police officers,
and it doesn't have to be an emer
gency. It should only be used for
emergency situations," he said.
"Nonetheless, state courts have been
inclined to uphold such statutes."
