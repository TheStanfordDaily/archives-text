# Men battle and No.3 'Zona on tough road trip
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's basketball team (11-0,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) is the underdog heading into
Tucson, Ariz., but you wouldn't know it by all the talk
surrounding the Cardinal's highly anticipated match
up against No. 3 Arizona (9-1,1-0) on Saturday.
For the time being, at least, no one has anything
negative to say about this undefeated Stanford team.
"[Arizona State head coach] Rob Evans probably
said it best after our game against ASU on Saturday,"
recalled Arizona head coach Lute Olson. "Even
though we beat them pretty handily, he said, 'We've
got a better team (Stanford) coming in next week.'
And I think that's probably the feeling of a lot of peo
ple."
"Basically it's the same team [Stanford] had a year
ago," Olson continued. "They're a year older.
They're far and away the most experienced team in
the league, and I think that he has a bench he can go
to that is pretty deep. When you look at them you
don't see any weaknesses."
According to Olson and many other college hoops
aficionados, this same oF group of Stanford boys has
apparently transformed itself into an entirely differ
ent team a far cry from the troop of scrappy un
derdogs that surprised national powerhouses game
after game last season.
Adjectives like "scrappy" and "inexperienced"
have been seamlessly replaced with descriptors like
"poised" and "mature." And with little commotion,
this team has quietly climbed into the national spot
light a position ripe with expectation.
But the biggest surprise of all remains the fact that
Stanford has done it all without its most notable star,
Josh Childress. Because of a stress reaction in his left
foot, the junior swingman has played only limited
minutes against two of the Cardinal's least intimidat
ing conference opponents, Washington and Washing
ton State.
"We have probably played a little more consis
tently without Childress than we might have thought,
and we're probably a little bit overrated right now,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "We've
had two or three good wins, and most of the others are
wins that you would expect us to get, so the record is
deceiving We'll just continue to try to win as
many games as we can."
Like the Cardinal, the Wildcats have been forced
to acclimate themselves to life without one of their
most prominent figures, although in Arizona's case
it's a permanent adjustment. Junior for
ward Isaiah Fox was lost for the entire sea
son in late November when he sustained an
injury to his left knee.
To replace the injured Fox, Arizona
brought in Serbian transfer Ivan Radenovic
on Dec. 20. The freshman forward has av
eraged 12 points and 7.3 boards in his first
three games as a Wildcat.
"He hasn't had a whole lot of time to
practice with the team, so they're trying to
fit him in, but I'm sure as time goes on
they're going to expand his game a little
bit," Evans said. "He can really shoot the
basketball. He's very active and agile
He's a great addition for them."
Arizona leads the conference in scoring
offense, averaging just under 87 points per
game. Sophomore guard Hassan Adams
leads the Wildcats in scoring with 17.6
points per game, and both junior center
Channing Frye and junior guard Salim
Stoudamire have averaged just under 15
points per game. This trio, along with
sophomore forward Andre Iguodala, are
an athletic bunch that could give the Cardi
nal defense fits.
Which isn't to say that Stanford's bal
anced scoring attack won't cause problems
for the Wildcats.
"[Stanford's] ability to hit the three is a
challenge," Olson said. "You can't drop
and help inside, because if you do they're

going to hit a high percentage of their
threes."
For Pac-10 fans, Saturday afternoon's
match-up remains the most competitive ri
valry in the conference. Stanford has won
three consecutive games at Lute & Bobbie
Olson Court, and Arizona has done the
same at Maples Pavilion.
"They're a great team, we're a great
team, so it should be a good game," junior
center Rob Little said.
But no matter how excited Stanford is to
face Arizona the Pac-10's only other na
tionally ranked team the Cardinal will
first have to compete against a dangerous
Arizona State squad (6-4, 0-1) tonight in
Tempe.
The Sun Devils boast the conference's
leading scorer and most dominating player
in 6-foot-8 center Ike Diogu. Diogu's aver
age of 23.7 points per game and 9.7 re
bounds per game will present a compelling
challenge for the Stanford frontcourt of se
nior forward Justin Davis and juniors Rob
Little and Nick Robinson.
Evans had praise of his own for Stan
ford's players.
"They're not only bigger and stronger
inside, they're also bigger and stronger on
the perimeter," Evans said. "They've obvi
ously worked extremely hard in the offsea
son. They're just an outstanding basketball
team."
Tipoff is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight in
Tempe before Stanford travels to Tucson
to face off against the Wildcats at 3:30 p.m.
on Saturday. Both games will be televised
on Fox Sports Net and, as always, will be
broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.

tionally ranked team the Cardinal will
first have to compete against a dangerous
Arizona State squad (6-4, 0-1) tonight in
Tempe.
The Sun Devils boast the conference's
leading scorer and most dominating player
in 6-foot-8 center Ike Diogu. Diogu's aver
age of 23.7 points per game and 9.7 re
bounds per game will present a compelling
challenge for the Stanford frontcourt of se
nior forward Justin Davis and juniors Rob
Little and Nick Robinson.
Evans had praise of his own for Stan
ford's players.
"They're not only bigger and stronger
inside, they're also bigger and stronger on
the perimeter," Evans said. "They've obvi
ously worked extremely hard in the offsea
son. They're just an outstanding basketball
team."
Tipoff is set for 7:30 p.m. tonight in
Tempe before Stanford travels to Tucson
to face off against the Wildcats at 3:30 p.m.
on Saturday. Both games will be televised
on Fox Sports Net and, as always, will be
broadcast on KZSU 90.1 FM.
The No. 4 Stanford men's basketball team (11-0,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) is the underdog heading into
Tucson, Ariz., but you wouldn't know it by all the talk
surrounding the Cardinal's highly anticipated match
up against No. 3 Arizona (9-1,1-0) on Saturday.
For the time being, at least, no one has anything
negative to say about this undefeated Stanford team.
"[Arizona State head coach] Rob Evans probably
said it best after our game against ASU on Saturday,"
recalled Arizona head coach Lute Olson. "Even
though we beat them pretty handily, he said, 'We've
got a better team (Stanford) coming in next week.'
And I think that's probably the feeling of a lot of peo
ple."
"Basically it's the same team [Stanford] had a year
ago," Olson continued. "They're a year older.
They're far and away the most experienced team in
the league, and I think that he has a bench he can go
to that is pretty deep. When you look at them you
don't see any weaknesses."
According to Olson and many other college hoops
aficionados, this same oF group of Stanford boys has
apparently transformed itself into an entirely differ
ent team a far cry from the troop of scrappy un
derdogs that surprised national powerhouses game
after game last season.
Adjectives like "scrappy" and "inexperienced"
have been seamlessly replaced with descriptors like
"poised" and "mature." And with little commotion,
this team has quietly climbed into the national spot
light a position ripe with expectation.
But the biggest surprise of all remains the fact that
Stanford has done it all without its most notable star,
Josh Childress. Because of a stress reaction in his left
foot, the junior swingman has played only limited
minutes against two of the Cardinal's least intimidat
ing conference opponents, Washington and Washing
ton State.
"We have probably played a little more consis
tently without Childress than we might have thought,
and we're probably a little bit overrated right now,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "We've
had two or three good wins, and most of the others are
wins that you would expect us to get, so the record is
deceiving We'll just continue to try to win as
many games as we can."
Like the Cardinal, the Wildcats have been forced
to acclimate themselves to life without one of their
most prominent figures, although in Arizona's case
it's a permanent adjustment. Junior for
ward Isaiah Fox was lost for the entire sea
son in late November when he sustained an
injury to his left knee.
To replace the injured Fox, Arizona
brought in Serbian transfer Ivan Radenovic
on Dec. 20. The freshman forward has av
eraged 12 points and 7.3 boards in his first
three games as a Wildcat.
"He hasn't had a whole lot of time to
practice with the team, so they're trying to
fit him in, but I'm sure as time goes on
they're going to expand his game a little
bit," Evans said. "He can really shoot the
basketball. He's very active and agile
He's a great addition for them."
Arizona leads the conference in scoring
offense, averaging just under 87 points per
game. Sophomore guard Hassan Adams
leads the Wildcats in scoring with 17.6
points per game, and both junior center
Channing Frye and junior guard Salim
Stoudamire have averaged just under 15
points per game. This trio, along with
sophomore forward Andre Iguodala, are
an athletic bunch that could give the Cardi
nal defense fits.
Which isn't to say that Stanford's bal
anced scoring attack won't cause problems
for the Wildcats.
"[Stanford's] ability to hit the three is a
challenge," Olson said. "You can't drop
and help inside, because if you do they're

going to hit a high percentage of their
threes."
For Pac-10 fans, Saturday afternoon's
match-up remains the most competitive ri
valry in the conference. Stanford has won
three consecutive games at Lute & Bobbie
Olson Court, and Arizona has done the
same at Maples Pavilion.
"They're a great team, we're a great
team, so it should be a good game," junior
center Rob Little said.
