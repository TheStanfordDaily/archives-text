### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 4 Stanford men's basketball team (11-0,2-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) is the underdog heading into
Tucson, Ariz., but you wouldn't know it by all the talk
surrounding the Cardinal's highly anticipated match
up against No. 3 Arizona (9-1,1-0) on Saturday.
For the time being, at least, no one has anything
negative to say about this undefeated Stanford team.
"[Arizona State head coach] Rob Evans probably
said it best after our game against ASU on Saturday,"
recalled Arizona head coach Lute Olson. "Even
though we beat them pretty handily, he said, 'We've
got a better team (Stanford) coming in next week.'
And I think that's probably the feeling of a lot of peo
ple."
"Basically it's the same team [Stanford] had a year
ago," Olson continued. "They're a year older.
They're far and away the most experienced team in
the league, and I think that he has a bench he can go
to that is pretty deep. When you look at them you
don't see any weaknesses."
According to Olson and many other college hoops
aficionados, this same oF group of Stanford boys has
apparently transformed itself into an entirely differ

derdogs that surprised national powerhouses game
after game last season.
Adjectives like "scrappy" and "inexperienced"
have been seamlessly replaced with descriptors like
"poised" and "mature." And with little commotion,
this team has quietly climbed into the national spot
light a position ripe with expectation.
But the biggest surprise of all remains the fact that
Stanford has done it all without its most notable star,
Josh Childress. Because of a stress reaction in his left
foot, the junior swingman has played only limited
minutes against two of the Cardinal's least intimidat
ing conference opponents, Washington and Washing
ton State.
"We have probably played a little more consis
tently without Childress than we might have thought,
and we're probably a little bit overrated right now,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "We've
had two or three good wins, and most of the others are
wins that you would expect us to get, so the record is
deceiving We'll just continue to try to win as
many games as we can."
Like the Cardinal, the Wildcats have been forced
to acclimate themselves to life without one of their
most prominent figures, although in Arizona's case
