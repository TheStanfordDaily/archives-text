# UC-San Diego begins work on first-ever bomb-blast simulator
## 
### MEAGHAN FIELD THE GUARDIAN 
(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA â€”The
University of California at San
Diego announced Dec. 13 the begin
ning of construction on the world's
first bomb blast simulator. The sim
ulator will be built at the Field Sta
tion at Camp Elliot, and will be used
by structural engineers at the Jacobs
School of Engineering to test the ef
fects of bomb blasts on structures.
The blast simulator is construct
ed through a contract from the
Technical Support Working Group,
which is a federal interagency entity
organized to fight terrorism. The re
sults from the simulator will be used
to devise methods to protect high
risk buildings in the event of terror
ist bombings.
"No two blast loads are the same.
In order to do detailed develop
ment, we need to do fully repeatable
tests which can only be done in a

lab," said Frieder Seible, dean of
UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineer
ing. "The whole goal for us is to
move from field testing on buildings
to field testing on components to
quasi-start testing in the laboratory
to real-time blast testing under labo
ratory conditions. And this is what
we're doing at Camp Elliot."
The project will cost $4.2 milhon
and is expected to be complete and
active by early 2005.
Previous field tests have been
conducted at various air force bases,
including at the White Sands and
Kirkland bases in New Mexico.
Until now, these test blasts done on
real structures have been the only
option for engineers. According to
Seible, completely accurate results
are impossible to obtain during
these tests, as each blast differs from
the next.
There have been field tests con
ducted on full-scale four-story struc
tures, along with more focused tests

that measure how a certain element
of a structure will hold up under the
impact of a blast. These more fo
cused experiments usually test the
strength of columns, as the ability of
a column to hold up under a blast is
directly related to how the structure
will react. Although the blast load
typically impacts only a column, if
the column is destroyed, the struc
ture will not be able to stand.
"For example, here in America,
like in the Oklahoma City bombing,
the blast loads typically affect our
structures in a way that there is a re
gressive structural collapse follow
ing the initial blast loading," Seible
said. "This collapse accounts for
most of the casualties."
The previous tests on columns
have showed that wrapping a col
umn in carbon composite can help
the column to withstand the original
blast.
Another technique is to wrap the
columns in steel. That technique

also has proved successful in stop
ping much of the damage so far.
These techniques strengthen the
column and make it able to with
stand the bending and swaying that
occurs during and after a bombing.
Both wrapping materials can be
retrofitted to structures, making
current buildings safe against blasts
without changing most of the struc
ture of the building.
The simulator will allow for fur
ther tests on columns and buildings
to take place, both using previously
developed technologies in old and
new ways and developing new tech
nologies. The engineers will be able
to refine the wrapping technologies
by continuous tests on the same
structure. They will also be able to
use these technologies on parts of
the building not previously tested,
such as walls.
The blast simulator is construct
ed as a floating slab on rubber bear
ings, which ensures that the excita

tions from the blasts will not be felt
anywhere else. The blast is simulat
ed by creating an impact through
loading units that can be adjusted
according to the strength the engi
neer would like to test. The loading
units are elastic pads and can be
shaped and arranged differently to
create different layouts for an ex
periment and allow for more tests.
The blast simulator does not simu
late the thermal energy that occurs
during a blast, but only the pressure
created. According to Seible, this is
because in most cases, thermal load
is not important in terms of the
structural response.
"The goal of the program is to
identify the response of structures
during the blast loads," Seible said.
The tests will be focused on com
mon blast scenarios. These scenar
ios will be repeated multiple times in
order to determine the ability of a
structure to resist energy imposed
by the blast. High-speed cameras

will be used to capture the result.
The ability to view each moment of
impact is important for the develop
ment of structural technology, and
was not available for use in field
tests as the cameras would have
been destroyed in the blast. The
tools used in these tests are particu
lar to the laboratory conditions and
are some of the main reasons behind
the change from field tests to simu
lations.
"It is very important to us to de
velop analytical tools which allow us
to simulate these blast loads and
their impact on structures," Seible
said. "So what we're doing here is
developing a facility which will
allow us to validate our analytical
model and tools."
The blast simulator will be creat
ed in a site adjacent to the world's
first outdoor shake table, which will
be completed by September 2004
and will be used to test structures
during simulated earthquakes.
