# Haryasz front-'Page' news for Card
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The tiny town of Page, Ariz.,
on the shores of Lake Powell, is
a four-and-a-half hour drive
from the campus of Arizona
State. But for Matt Haryasz,
who was born and raised in
Page, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team's game against the
Sun Devils in Tempe tonight
will be a sort of homecoming
away-from-home.
Two years ago, Tempe was
the site of the high school bas
ketball state championship
game between Haryasz's Page
Sand Devils and Sunnyslope. By
Haryasz's estimate, 6,000 fans
made the trek to cheer on the
team from a town with a pop
ulation of 8,000.
"We're in the middle of
nowhere, the middle of the
Navajo reservation. It's about
two-and-a-half hours to the
closest town," the sophomore
forward said of his hometown.
"The community got really in

volved and enthralled with our
team. They love basketball."
Since Haryasz graduated
from Page High School, which
he said was about 60 percent
Navajo, local fans have followed
his progress from benchwarmer
to regular contributor. Some
have even shifted their alle
giance from the Arizona schools
to Stanford.
"A lot of people [in Page] can
probably tell you who's on the
Stanford team and what our
record is," Haryasz said.
So it's a good bet that the
lanky junior will see some old
friends in the crowd at Thursday
night's game. But not all the fa
miliar faces will be friendly:
Haryasz knows many of the Ari
zona State players because he
visited the school before even
tually choosing to attend Stan
ford.
"It was really tough between
Arizona State and Stanford," he
said. "I came out there and met
all the players, met the coach
es."

Haryasz said he was attracted
to Arizona State because of the
proximity to his friends and
family.
"It would have been comfort
able, and I could have fit right
in. Stanford was the tougher
place to go . . . But I'm so happy
it worked out the way it did,"
Haryasz said.
When Stanford plays No. 3
Arizona on Saturday, Wildcats
head coach Lute Olson is likely
to be less happy about the way
things worked out. Arizona
didn't offer Haryasz a scholar
ship, largely because it had
landed three marquee big men
the year before: Channing Frye,
Denis Latimore and Isaiah Fox.
Now, Latimore has transferred,
Fox is out for the year with an
injury and Arizona's main im
pediment to a championship
season is its lack of depth.
Haryasz said he doesn't hold
a grudge, but wouldn't he at
least like to show the Wildcats
what they're missing?

Sophomore Matt Haryasz has made the most of his playing time this season, establishing himself as a force
off the bench for Stanford. Haryasz returns to his home state of Arizona tonight as the Cardinal faces ASU.
