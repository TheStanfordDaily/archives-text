## Blood drive helps mitigate shortage 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Medical School
Blood Center held an emergency drive
yesterday in an attempt to replenish
near-record low blood supplies in the
Bay Area. Organizers called the drive
a success, with 93 people donating a
total of 59 units of blood.
"It was a great blood drive," said
Doreen Leith, supervisor of the de
partment that organizes blood drives.
"I've never seen so many donors in
such a short period of time. The com
munity came through for us and we
would like to thank them."
The blood drive was considered a
success because while the "bloodmo
bile" usually handles at most 10
donors per hour, thus a maximum of
60 donors per six hours, yesterday
around 15 people gave blood per
hour for a total of 93 people. But even
despite the new donations, the blood
shortage still might continue, accord
ing to Leith.
"We just have to go from day-to
day."
The drive was in response to a
blood shortage that Leith said was
very rare and the largest she has seen
at the center.
The center needs to collect 180
units a day to maintain its blood sup
ply. Before the drive it had 92 units of
O-positive blood although it would
like to have a minimum of 250 unit

and 38 units of O-negative although it
would like to have a minimum of 100
units, according to Leith.
"We need to keep the blood sup
ply right up there," Leith said. "If we
don't have blood to unshelf when
they need it then the surgery isn't
possible. It's very important that we
always have blood readily available."
This is especially true for Stanford
Hospital, Leith said, which also has a
trauma center. In cases of extreme
blood shortages, hospitals ask pa
tients with elective surgeries to
reschedule, but the center has not
come to this point yet.
According to Leith, at this time of
year it is always difficult to maintain
its blood supply, but this year it has
been even more so. Blood supplies
typically decrease around the holi
days because when people go on va
cation and the University shuts down
for two weeks, the center holds fewer
blood drives, half of their usual num
ber, and must go to other places to
find donors.
The number of donors was also
down because of the flu season,
which usually causes decreased dona
tions, started early and struck harder
than usual, and only healthy individu
als are allowed to give blood.
Additionally, a recent patient un
derwent a liver transplant that used

10 units of blood products per hour.
Leith said that the procedure was an
unusual case that "put us in a hole."
"We had to try and very quickly
to recoup what had gone out,"
Leith said. "We sometimes are
short and we see the levels going
down, but the patient was using
and we weren't bringing in. We
didn't have enough blood to with
stand."
The blood drive was organized as
an emergency measure to replenish
the blood supply. On Tuesday, the
center also asked patients, visitors
and others at Stanford Hospital via
the P.A. system to give blood, shut
tling people to where they could do
nate. Employees are also calling peo
ple personally to inform them of the
situation and ask for them to donate.
Other blood banks in the Bay

Area, including Blood Centers of the
Pacific which serves 40 hospitals and
the American Red Cross, are also
currently experiencing critically low
levels of blood supply, the greatest
shortage in years. Before the drive,
the Stanford Blood Center had less
than a half-day's supply of type-0
blood, and likewise the Blood
Centers of the Pacific has less than
a half-day's stock left, according
to The San Jose Mercury News,
and is rationing its blood, accord
ing to a press release.
The fact that other local blood
centers are experiencing shortages
makes the situation more difficult,
since centers are usually able to
share their supplies in time of
need. Also, they are unable to re
ceive import shipments of blood
from other regions due to a nation
wide shortage.
"We are all in the same boat,"
Leith said. "The problem is everyone
else is short too. This time of year no
one has anything to send."
