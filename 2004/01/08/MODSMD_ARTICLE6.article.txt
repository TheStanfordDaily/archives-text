## Blood drive helps mitigate shortage 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford Medical School
Blood Center held an emergency drive
yesterday in an attempt to replenish
near-record low blood supplies in the
Bay Area. Organizers called the drive
a success, with 93 people donating a
total of 59 units of blood.
"It was a great blood drive," said
Doreen Leith, supervisor of the de
partment that organizes blood drives.
"I've never seen so many donors in
such a short period of time. The com
munity came through for us and we
would like to thank them."
The blood drive was considered a
success because while the "bloodmo
bile" usually handles at most 10
donors per hour, thus a maximum of
60 donors per six hours, yesterday
around 15 people gave blood per
hour for a total of 93 people. But even
despite the new donations, the blood
shortage still might continue, accord
ing to Leith.
"We just have to go from day-to
day."
The drive was in response to a
blood shortage that Leith said was
very rare and the largest she has seen
at the center.
The center needs to collect 180
units a day to maintain its blood sup
ply. Before the drive it had 92 units of
O-positive blood although it would
like to have a minimum of 250 unit

and 38 units of O-negative although it
would like to have a minimum of 100
units, according to Leith.
"We need to keep the blood sup
ply right up there," Leith said. "If we
don't have blood to unshelf when
they need it then the surgery isn't
possible. It's very important that we
always have blood readily available."
This is especially true for Stanford
Hospital, Leith said, which also has a
trauma center. In cases of extreme
blood shortages, hospitals ask pa
tients with elective surgeries to
reschedule, but the center has not
come to this point yet.
According to Leith, at this time of
year it is always difficult to maintain
its blood supply, but this year it has
been even more so. Blood supplies
typically decrease around the holi
days because when people go on va
cation and the University shuts down
for two weeks, the center holds fewer
blood drives, half of their usual num
ber, and must go to other places to
find donors.
The number of donors was also
down because of the flu season,
which usually causes decreased dona
tions, started early and struck harder
than usual, and only healthy individu
als are allowed to give blood.

derwent a liver transplant that used
