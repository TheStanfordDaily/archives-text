# Dining cautious about mad cow
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
In response to health concerns from
the recent discovery of mad cow disease
in the United States, Stanford Dining
has taken additional precautions to en
sure that it does not serve contaminated
beef, according to University officials.
On Dec. 23, U.S. government offi
cials diagnosed a 6-year old cow in
Washington state with the first recorded
case of bovine spongiform en
cephalopathy, commonly known as
mad cow disease. According to Nadeem
Siddiqui, executive director of Stanford
Dining, he and his employees contacted
the vendors that supply meat to the din
ing halls immediately after the out
break.
"We have been assured verbally and
in writing by all of our vendors and sup
pliers that the beef we had and will be re
ceiving is cleared by the [United States
Department of Agriculture] and is safe
for consumption," Siddiqui said.
He added that the University's food
vendors all have "strong guidelines for
safety." In addition, Dining will regular
ly maintain its food shipments and take
precautions to ensure the quality of its
beef.
Mad cow disease causes the
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans,
which leads to the wasting away of the
brain. Although no human cases have
been reported in the United States yet,
senior Chris Lau is taking extra precau
tions and temporarily avoiding beef.
"Beef was my life before mad cow,"
Lau said. "There is nothing I looked for
ward to more that a filet mignon for din
ner. I did a little research, though, and I
think that the problem has the potential
to get much worse. I haven't sworn off

beef for life, but I'm definitely going to
hold off on eating it for awhile."
On the other hand, senior Johnny
Chen will not let the scare prevent him
from consuming his favorite source of
protein.
"I eat meat, and I'm not going to let a
few little cows take away from some
thing that I enjoy eating so much," Chen
said.
Though the infected cow was discov
ered in Washington, USDA officials
traced its origin to a Canadian farm after
performing DNA tests. That cow, along
with a shipment of 81 others, arrived in
the United States in September 2001.
The cow most likely contracted the dis
ease after consuming feed that con
tained parts of other cows that were in
fected.
According to The New York Times,
agriculture officials are currently trying
to track down the 81 cows in the ship
ment and quarantining herds because of
ties to the original cow. On Tuesday,
they began destroying a herd of 449
calves in Washington because one was
born to the infected cow.
Following the outbreak, Japan
banned all beef imports from the United
States. More than 30 other countries
joined the ban, and despite the USDA's
recent adoption of more stringent rules
and regulations to protect against the
disease, none of the importing nations
have resumed purchasing U.S. beef, ac
cording to The Times.
The declining demand for U.S.
beef has caused prices to drop as much
as 10 percent in the past two weeks,
The Times reported, leaving agricul
ture officials and lawmakers scram
bling for ways to remedy the problem
and to persuade countries to resume
their imports.
