# NCAA's postseason football system up for revision at February meeting
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Following the 2003 college football season's split national cham
pionship, talks are set to take place next month to reform the Bowl
Championship Series, the current college football postseason sys
tem. Possible changes include eliminating a computerized ranking
process and establishing an extra bowl game.
The lucrative system was put into place in 1998 to replace inde
pendently run football bowl games. In 1997, two teams, Nebraska
and Michigan, split the national championship, as they did not play
each other and Nebraska was voted No. 1 in the final coaches' poll
and Michigan was tabbed as the top team in the season-end Associ
ated Press poll. The BCS system was put into place to pit the top two
teams against each other in the season's last bowl game to decide the
national champion.
The BCS had its problems along the way, but never like this sea
son.
The BCS encountered a problem this previous season when Uni
versity of Southern California, ranked number one by the media and
the coaches, was bypassed for the Sugar Bowl where BCS Nos. 1 and
2 Oklahoma and LSU played instead. The result was a co-champi
onship title between the AP's No. 1, USC, and the BCS-endorsed
Sugar Bowl winner, LSU (the coaches' poll stipulates that coaches
must vote the BCS title game winner as their final No. 1).
"I think it was obvious that USC should have been number one
based on their record and performance in games," said sophomore
Albert Chang, an avid football fan. "It's clear that the numbers in
BCS polls messed that up and now some revamping is in order."
The BCS system consists of four profitable sports showcases: the
Rose Bowl, the Nokia Sugar Bowl, the FedEx Orange Bowl and the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Each bowl gives regional considerations to the
champions of the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific

10 and Southeastern Conferences. A complicated computerized sys
tem of polls, computer rankings and other factors determine which
teams get to play at the four bowls, with one of the bowls being
played between the two top-ranked BCS teams.
Many reforms to the current system have been suggested, includ
ing elimination of a computerized system in favor of a BCS board to
decide which teams should play in the bowls. Many others have rec
ommended a playoff system similar to basketball where non-BCS
