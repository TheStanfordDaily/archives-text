# NCAA's postseason football system up for revision at February meeting
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Following the 2003 college football season's split national cham
pionship, talks are set to take place next month to reform the Bowl
Championship Series, the current college football postseason sys
tem. Possible changes include eliminating a computerized ranking
process and establishing an extra bowl game.
The lucrative system was put into place in 1998 to replace inde
pendently run football bowl games. In 1997, two teams, Nebraska
and Michigan, split the national championship, as they did not play
each other and Nebraska was voted No. 1 in the final coaches' poll
and Michigan was tabbed as the top team in the season-end Associ
ated Press poll. The BCS system was put into place to pit the top two
teams against each other in the season's last bowl game to decide the
national champion.
The BCS had its problems along the way, but never like this sea
son.
The BCS encountered a problem this previous season when Uni
versity of Southern California, ranked number one by the media and
the coaches, was bypassed for the Sugar Bowl where BCS Nos. 1 and
2 Oklahoma and LSU played instead. The result was a co-champi
onship title between the AP's No. 1, USC, and the BCS-endorsed
Sugar Bowl winner, LSU (the coaches' poll stipulates that coaches
must vote the BCS title game winner as their final No. 1).
"I think it was obvious that USC should have been number one
based on their record and performance in games," said sophomore
Albert Chang, an avid football fan. "It's clear that the numbers in
BCS polls messed that up and now some revamping is in order."
The BCS system consists of four profitable sports showcases: the
Rose Bowl, the Nokia Sugar Bowl, the FedEx Orange Bowl and the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Each bowl gives regional considerations to the
champions of the Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific

10 and Southeastern Conferences. A complicated computerized sys
tem of polls, computer rankings and other factors determine which
teams get to play at the four bowls, with one of the bowls being
played between the two top-ranked BCS teams.
Many reforms to the current system have been suggested, includ
ing elimination of a computerized system in favor of a BCS board to
decide which teams should play in the bowls. Many others have rec
ommended a playoff system similar to basketball where non-BCS

teams would also be given more
of an opportunity to enter the top
brackets.
David Tipton, the defensive
line coach for Stanford's football
team, believes that there is an
overemphasis on having a nation
al champion, while adding that a
playoff style football series
would not be possible for Divi
sion I college football.
"Everyone is so incredibly
hung up on having a national
champion, but I don't really
know whether that's so impor
tant," Tipton said. "You can get
away with a playoff system better
in other sports because it would
be too physically draining and
time-consuming for football play
ers to play so many games."
According to Sports Illustrat
ed, BCS Commissioner Mike
Tranghese asserted that the BCS
is against doing away with the cur
rent 28-bowl system in favor of
playoffs because it presents a rev
enue advantage and allows more
football players a chance to play

in a high-profile bowl game, all of
which are nationally televised.
BCS coaches are also dis
cussing other suggestions, such as
mandating that the teams in the
title game win their conference
(Oklahoma this year and Nebras
ka two years ago both lost the Big
12 conference championship
game but still made and lost
the BCS title game). Some, this
year at least, would have liked to
see a game pitting the winners of
the top two BCS games, which
would've settled this year's split
national championship.
Stanford is one of a few
schools that has no complaints
about the BCS. Because the BCS
stipulates that the aforemen
tioned six major conferences'
champions all get a BCS berth,
Pac-10 champion Stanford played
in the Rose Bowl in 2000 despite
having three losses being ranked
No. 22 in the AP poll at the time.
The fate of the proposed BCS
changes will be determined after
next month's meeting of BCS col
lege presidents and the National
Coalition for Athletics Reform.

10 and Southeastern Conferences. A complicated computerized sys
tem of polls, computer rankings and other factors determine which
teams get to play at the four bowls, with one of the bowls being
played between the two top-ranked BCS teams.
Many reforms to the current system have been suggested, includ
ing elimination of a computerized system in favor of a BCS board to
decide which teams should play in the bowls. Many others have rec
ommended a playoff system similar to basketball where non-BCS

teams would also be given more
of an opportunity to enter the top
brackets.
David Tipton, the defensive
line coach for Stanford's football
team, believes that there is an
overemphasis on having a nation
al champion, while adding that a
playoff style football series
would not be possible for Divi
sion I college football.
"Everyone is so incredibly
hung up on having a national
champion, but I don't really
know whether that's so impor
tant," Tipton said. "You can get
away with a playoff system better
in other sports because it would
be too physically draining and
time-consuming for football play
ers to play so many games."
According to Sports Illustrat
ed, BCS Commissioner Mike
Tranghese asserted that the BCS
is against doing away with the cur
rent 28-bowl system in favor of
playoffs because it presents a rev
enue advantage and allows more
football players a chance to play

in a high-profile bowl game, all of
which are nationally televised.
BCS coaches are also dis
cussing other suggestions, such as
mandating that the teams in the
title game win their conference
(Oklahoma this year and Nebras
ka two years ago both lost the Big
12 conference championship
game but still made and lost
the BCS title game). Some, this
year at least, would have liked to
see a game pitting the winners of
the top two BCS games, which
would've settled this year's split
national championship.
Stanford is one of a few
schools that has no complaints
about the BCS. Because the BCS
stipulates that the aforemen
tioned six major conferences'
champions all get a BCS berth,
Pac-10 champion Stanford played
in the Rose Bowl in 2000 despite
having three losses being ranked
No. 22 in the AP poll at the time.
The fate of the proposed BCS
changes will be determined after
next month's meeting of BCS col
lege presidents and the National
Coalition for Athletics Reform.
