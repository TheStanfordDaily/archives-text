# Surprise donation aids Talisman trip to S. Africa
## 
### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a performance in Phoenix, Ariz, last month,
Talisman received a special Christmas present: a
$lO,OOO donation for their upcoming trip to South
Africa.
Talisman left for the show on Dec. 6 to perform for a
corporate award convention held by Money Mailer Inc.
at the Biltmore Hotel outside of Phoenix. The group
played four songs, but was so well received that the au
dience called for an encore, which Talisman delivered.
Money Mailer not only paid for Talisman's room and
board at the hotel but also, at the end of the banquet,
gave the group a generous donation. Godfred Otuteye,
CEO and president of Money Mailer, came up to the
stage, thanked Talisman for their performance and gave
the group a $lO,OOO donation to support their trip to
South Africa.
"We were shocked," said junior Ronald Ragin, a
member of the group. "They beckoned me onstage to
accept the donation, and I all I could say was, 'This must
be what it feels like to win a Grammy.'"
According to Ragin, Otuteye is a longtime Talisman
admirer. When learning that the group planned to visit
South Africa, Otuteye responded by having his compa
ny give them the donation.
Since most of Talisman's music is South African, the
opportunity to return to the roots of its music has been
a continuing goal for the group. Talisman has been to

South Africa once before, in 2000. It performed at a host
of schools, churches and community centers. The group
was so well received that at many of the concerts, the lo
cals sang along to the songs that they knew so well.
None of the current Talisman members experienced
the trip, yet they have yearned to visit the birthplace of
their group's musical repertoire.
"Sadly, we were unable to make it to South Africa
last year," said junior Jordan Husband, a member of
Talisman. "It is our goal to fundraise enough to go there
this year... we were teetering back and forth on the
trip, but with this donation, we'll be able to do it."
Currently, the group plans to leave for South Africa
right after Commencement. It will work closely with the
Amy Biehl Foundation, with which the group has a
long-standing relationship, in Cape Town and sing at
various locations in the townships.
From the trip, Talisman members hope to gain a new
cultural understanding of the music they sing.
"We will carry all that we learn and experience back
to Stanford with us," Ragin said. "In that way, we will
continue to fulfill our mission to bring culturally sub
stantive music to Stanford University and the surround
ing community."
Talisman still has quite a ways to go to fully fund
their trip. According to Husband, the donation should
cover about a fourth of the total costs of the trip. The
group also plans to fundraise their trip through the sales
of their new album, "Watch Me Fly," and through their
show during Parents' Weekend.
