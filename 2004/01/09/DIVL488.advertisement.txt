It's not Saddam
A Story calling for Investigation
In a news release sent to media worldwide on April 8,2003, Share International magazine
published information that Saddam Hussein had been injured in the first bombing of Iraq
on March 20; 2003 and died two days later from his injuries. Also according to our infor
mation, Hussein was buried quickly after his death by his sons, in accordance with Muslim
tradition.
So who has now been captured by American forces?
In our view certainly not Saddam Hussein but an obvious stand-in, of whom we understand
there are at least three: two cousins and a close friend all with similar family characteris
tics. We believe he is the same man — a cousin — seen on Iraqi television on April 4,
2003, who picked up a child and laughed and waved to the crowds. His body language was
completely different from that of Saddam Hussein. The end of his nose was much broad
er than that of Saddam and he had moles on his temple and forehead — identical with the
captured person. At that time commentators were perfectly ready to question the identity
of the man seen on video. Now everyone seems conveniently to have dropped any enquiry
or second thoughts.
The Americans claim that DNA samples taken from the captive relate to that of Saddam
Hussein. How do they know? With what are they comparing them? In any case, a cousin
would obviously share some of Saddam's genetic features. From the beginning of the Iraq
conflict the proven lies from this US administration, particularly about the weapons of
mass destruction, give little confidence that their information should be believed.
We are convinced that eventually the truth will emerge — that this confused man now cap
tured is not Saddam Hussein, but a double who may well have been part of a plot to keep
the fact of Saddam's death from the Iraqi people for as long as possible.
