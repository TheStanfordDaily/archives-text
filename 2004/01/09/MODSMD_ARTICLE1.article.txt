# Autumn 2004 classes to start later than usual
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University officials have decided
to reschedule the first day of classes
for Autumn Quarter 2004 to Mon
day, Sept. 27. Classes were originally
set to begin on Wednesday, Sept 22.
This would have meant that the first
day of New Student Orientation
would have taken place on Sept. 16,
coinciding with the Jewish holiday
Rosh Hashanah.
The rescheduling was approved
to avoid having a number of new stu
dents and their families miss Convo
cation, which takes place on the first
day of Orientation, due to religious
reasons.
Pushing the date back has
forced NSO to make several
changes, particularly because
Yom Kippur will now fall in the
middle of Orientation. In order to
accommodate more than 1,600 in
coming freshmen, NSO requires
facilities that can hold large
groups, such as auditoriums.

However, many of these facilities
have reportedly already been
booked by other organizations
for the events surrounding Yom
Kippur. Because of the holiday,
along with a University of South
ern California vs. Stanford foot
ball game on the same date, there
will be no Orientation program
ming for Sept. 25, giving students
a free day to explore the campus
on their own. To make up for the
lost day, the traditional six-day
Orientation will now be spread
over seven days.
According to Jared Scherer, the
director of NSO, another change in
next year's events involves a shift in
when the weekend falls within the
week of programming, which will af
fect programming involving depart
mental activities.
"Now that the dates are con
firmed, we will be taking a careful
look at all of our NSO program
ming and [will] determine what
will work best for everyone,"
Scherer said.
