# Meningitis is not your friend
## 
### 
Although school is barely back in
session, students are already
starting to worry about class
assignments and midterms. But
there's something else on which students
should also focus their attention. The
rash of meningitis cases in New Hamp
shire that infected five and killed one 18-
year-old woman last month should serve
as a grim reminder to all students that
they need to get meningitis vaccines as
soon as possible, particularly if they are
living in campus dormitories.
Meningococcal meningitis, an infec
tion of the brain, spinal cord and spinal
fluid that causes potentially fatal swelling
of the brain, can be transmitted simply by
sharing eating utensils, water bottles,
towels or bedding that have not been
properly washed. According to the Cen
ters for Disease Control and Prevention,
up to 15 percent of all cases are fatal.
While Stanford hasn't had any cases of
the infection in a number of years, ac
cording to Dr. Ira M. Friedman, director
of Vaden Health Center, all students are
encouraged to get the vaccine. Vaden
conducts an awareness campaign every
fall that targets incoming freshman, but

the vaccine is available at the health cen
ter year-round to any interested students.
The shot is $80 and is good for at least
three years.
We recommend that students take mea
sures to lower their risk of contracting
meningitis such as washing their hands
often, exercising, eating vitamin-rich
foods, getting enough sleep and by not
sharing utensils and other personal items.
While it may be tempting to share such
items when living in close quarters, stu
dents should try to keep things safe by
washing them with soap and hot water and
keeping their belongings separate. These
are all things students should do anyway,
but making certain that these practices are
in place will offer significant protection
against getting an infection.
We encourage all students to invest in
the meningitis vaccine â€”it will protect
you and others. It's never too late to get
the shot, and it's a small inconvenience in
exchange for an enormous benefit. Go to
the Vaden Web site for more details at

and do the responsible thing by not only
watching out for your mind but also for
your health.
