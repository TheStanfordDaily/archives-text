# OPINIONS
## DEATH AND DESTRUCTION 2003: A year in review guide 
### 
This was a traditional New Year's
forme. Ball drop. Blatant sym
bolism for many of our ineffec
tive leaders and directors of
Residential Education. And perhaps
also my academic productivity in 2003,
but that's none of your business. What is
your business is what went on around
the world. There were countless signifi
cant life-changing events that took place
in those 12 crazy months. It's unfortu
nate that we didn't get to hear about any
of them. Instead, we got the latest devel
opments in the Laci Peterson case.
Thank God for that.
No, no, 2003 had some mildly impor
tant stuff going on. Trista and Ryan's
wedding, the Florida Marlins ruining
the dreams of millions of people and de
serving to go to hell for it and some war
that happened in some country — I
think it was Iran. No, it was Ireland.
And while it was a fairly eventful
year for many, it was an exceptionally
sensational year for police departments
everywhere (except Stanford police
who only saw action chasing nerds on
bicycles). Look at the year's big name
arrests and trials — Martha Stewart:
robbing poor folks of their pensions;
Rush Limbaugh: popping OxyContin
like like that little Asian guy and frank
furters; Kobe Bryant: unlawful rear
entry; Michael Jackson: pocket pool in
occupied Osh Kosh pajamas; and, last
but not least, this kid I knew from high
school: whizzing behind a dumpster at
Taco Bell. Congratulations to pigs ev
erywhere.
Well, that's looking back. Let's look
forward. I'm starting us off with some
predictions for the coming year. If any of
these events play out as I've prophe
sized, feel free to refer to me as the "Ge
nius Fortune Teller of This Universe
and He's Sexy, Too." I won't stop you.
Predictions:
Michael Jackson flees the country
before a verdict is reached on the
charge of child molestation. After

months of hiding, he's spotted leading
a choir at a Parisian cathedral. Bush,
who vowed to bring the King of Pop to
justice, sends in 40,000 troops. After
toppling Chirac's government, Dubya
announces a new name for the smelly
country: "Freedom." He says, "Any
thing French must

now be referred to
as "Freedomish."
Jackson evades
American forces.
Jackson weds
unfunny comedian
Carrot Top and
gives birth to
Ronald McDonald.
Howard Dean
wins the democrat
ic nomination and
runs in the first

presidential election with nationwide
computer polling — a system tested
and perfected in Florida. Unfortunate
ly for Democrats, Bush is re-elected
with 100 percent of the vote.
Saddam Hussein offered $1 million
for an interview with Barbara Walters.
Turns it down for a role in the sequel
to "Dude, Where's My Car?" The for
mer brutal dictator performs his own
stunts including one in the last scene
where he gets his head chopped off by
an Iraqi executioner. The movie flops
at the box office, one viewer quoted as
saying, "Most sequels are worse than
the original, but it's pretty pathetic
when the original sucked."
After a bizarre brainstorming ses
sion, News Corp media mogul Rupert
Murdoch and Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, seeking to expand their respec
tive industrial empires, announce an
unprecedented merger. They will be
surgically combined into one filthy rich
bastard.
The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red
Sox face each other in the World
Championship Series. After splitting
the first six games, the entire Western
world tunes in to the broadcast of
game seven at Fenway Park. In the 8th

inning, police foil a plot by Salami Bin
Laden to end the ballgame in a fairly
inconsiderate manner. The MLB can
cels the game for safety reasons never
reschedules it. Thus, both teams lose.
A van full of angry Sox and Cubs fans
hunt down Bin Laden and punish him
within 36 hours. An impressed CIA
Director George Tenet publicly asks
how they recognized the terrorist lead
er in those glasses, red and white
striped sweater, and pompom hat.
Martha Stewart gets five years of
hard time. Guards, responding to a
raucous in her cell, witness an irate
Stewart DDTing alpha prisoner and
cellmate Big Bertha Leibowitz.
Martha earns the title: "Bitch to be
reckoned with," granting her daily ac
cess to smuggled angel dust and the
macaroni salad of any woman in her
path.
After a public uproar over beef in
dustry execs running an advertisement
promoting Mad Cow Disease as "cool
er than cool" and "the pet rock of the
2000s," the industry attempts to revive
its market value by introducing a new
line of innovative beef-based products
including beef crew socks, meat cur
tains and hamburger shampoo.
Republicans pass a bill deregulating
the U.S. prison system. Former heads of
Enron and Worldcom pool their funds
and purchase Leland Stanford Junior
University, converting it to Leland Stan
ford Junior Penitentiary for Corporate
Malfeasance. Residential Education re
vives Secret Snowflake and the original /
reasonable / effective Alcohol Policy in
return for kickbacks and cauldrons of
"baby stew." The Hoover Institute at last
feels gets respect from the community.

A.J. Magnuson becomes a rock star and
marries Britney Spears. Has the marriage
annulled the next day. Marries her again.
Makes breakfast the next morning. An
nuls it again that afternoon for the last
time, he swears. Changes his mind again
and doesn't care what anyone thinks be
cause you're all just jealous anyway.

The Chicago Cubs and Boston Red

inning, police foil a plot by Salami Bin

A van full of angry Sox and Cubs fans

After a public uproar over beef in

promoting Mad Cow Disease as "cool

A.J. Magnuson
This was a traditional New Year's
forme. Ball drop. Blatant sym
bolism for many of our ineffec
tive leaders and directors of
Residential Education. And perhaps
also my academic productivity in 2003,
but that's none of your business. What is
your business is what went on around
the world. There were countless signifi
cant life-changing events that took place
in those 12 crazy months. It's unfortu
nate that we didn't get to hear about any
of them. Instead, we got the latest devel
opments in the Laci Peterson case.
Thank God for that.
No, no, 2003 had some mildly impor
tant stuff going on. Trista and Ryan's
wedding, the Florida Marlins ruining
the dreams of millions of people and de
serving to go to hell for it and some war
that happened in some country — I
think it was Iran. No, it was Ireland.
And while it was a fairly eventful
year for many, it was an exceptionally
sensational year for police departments
everywhere (except Stanford police
who only saw action chasing nerds on
bicycles). Look at the year's big name
arrests and trials — Martha Stewart:
robbing poor folks of their pensions;
Rush Limbaugh: popping OxyContin
like like that little Asian guy and frank
furters; Kobe Bryant: unlawful rear
entry; Michael Jackson: pocket pool in
occupied Osh Kosh pajamas; and, last
but not least, this kid I knew from high
school: whizzing behind a dumpster at
Taco Bell. Congratulations to pigs ev
erywhere.
Well, that's looking back. Let's look
forward. I'm starting us off with some
predictions for the coming year. If any of
these events play out as I've prophe
sized, feel free to refer to me as the "Ge
nius Fortune Teller of This Universe
and He's Sexy, Too." I won't stop you.
Predictions:
Michael Jackson flees the country
before a verdict is reached on the
charge of child molestation. After

months of hiding, he's spotted leading
a choir at a Parisian cathedral. Bush,
who vowed to bring the King of Pop to
justice, sends in 40,000 troops. After
toppling Chirac's government, Dubya
announces a new name for the smelly
country: "Freedom." He says, "Any
thing French must

now be referred to
as "Freedomish."
Jackson evades
American forces.
Jackson weds
unfunny comedian
Carrot Top and
gives birth to
Ronald McDonald.
Howard Dean
wins the democrat
ic nomination and
runs in the first

presidential election with nationwide
computer polling — a system tested
and perfected in Florida. Unfortunate
ly for Democrats, Bush is re-elected
with 100 percent of the vote.
Saddam Hussein offered $1 million
for an interview with Barbara Walters.
Turns it down for a role in the sequel
to "Dude, Where's My Car?" The for
mer brutal dictator performs his own
stunts including one in the last scene
where he gets his head chopped off by
an Iraqi executioner. The movie flops
at the box office, one viewer quoted as
saying, "Most sequels are worse than
the original, but it's pretty pathetic
when the original sucked."
