# REDHAGE'S REMARKS
## Travelers should just be themselves 
### 
I'm leaving on Thursday to go
spend a little more time in South
America. Each of my trips thus
far has been for a different pur
pose. The first trip, to Venezuela, was
strictly vacation. Next was a study
abroad in Santiago. Later that year I
did my thesis research in Ecuador.
This time, I'm going to do an adven
ture race in Patagonia. While each of
these experiences is noteworthy to
me, none stray far from the beaten
path of a Stanford student. Around
these parts, I've been hard-pressed to
find someone who hasn't been
"abroad" in some capacity. (Does this
differ for engineers? I'm not sure.)
Something I've also encountered
while at Stanford, at least in my circles,
is the notion that it's vitally important to
preserve indigenous cultures. Likewise,
I've heard many students question
whether they should ever be traveling
in remote areas (even though they still
do it) where their "modern world" in
fluence might somehow change the cul
ture or quaintness therein. In a related
vein, I have myself questioned whether
I could ever live or work in a country
very different from my native one, be
cause I am unsure about whether I
could ever understand another nation's
culture enough to function sufficiently
sensitively in my daily life there.
While such values and fears are valid
for how they reflect people's sensitivity to
the world, they skirt one of life's unavoid
able truths. Things change. It is a simple
truth to say that cultures, both "indige
nous" and "modern," are changing and
will continue to change every day,
whether you're around or not. But with
this thing called "life," you get the privi
lege of participating in such changes. I

think it'd be a shame to regard your abili
ty to live in and affect the world around
you as "pollution."
Of course, there is the possibility of

going into foreign
and trying to shove
your ideals down
other people's
throats. In my
view, this is the life
of missionaries
and imperialists. A
good friend point
ed out, for exam
ple, that the way in
which foreign vol
unteers shape the
availability of con-

traception in Africa can lead to seri
ous health problems, so maybe it's not
okay that a particular American
makes the choice to go volunteer in
Africa if he or she will only make
things worse.
Is it okay to make things worse? This
I see as a separate issue. The possibility
that a foreigner will do bad in another
culture is not a reason for people to
avoid traveling or participating in "cul
tural diffusion." People can do "bad"
wherever they are — they don't need to
travel to show ignorance or intolerance
to one another. Good guidelines for
traveling abroad, then, are not to rub
off on others as little as possible, but
rather, to act like a good person should.
Be respectful at home and be respectful
away from home. Care about people
and the world around you, no matter
where you are. These rules don't
change along with national borders.
Another important consideration relat
ing particularly to the idea of influencing
"indigenous cultures" is that you weren't

bom into the only culture that can critically
think. People raised in other countries' in
digenous cultures, for example, can choose
just as well as you (and actually better) how
they should deal with outside influences and
new information. No one needs you to tell
them whether or not to absorb your influ
ence or the influence of other foreigners.
Though it may be one thing for you
to stroll into Oaxaca, Mexico and lobby
for English to be the only language, it is
another altogether for you to go teach
English there to those who want to
leam. By offering an educational op
portunity, you are not forcing anything
down anyone's throat, and by partici
pating in the diffusion of English, you
are not leading to the demise of indige
nous Mexican cultures. Besides, if the
skill you offer is in demand, then if not
you, someone else will be the teacher.
The fact of the matter is, things in the
world will change. Given this, you should
make your choices about whether to
travel by deciding: 1) Whether it is im
portant to you and 2) Whether you can
do so in the way that you want to. Just be
thoughtful. I learned during my first trip
to South America that I'd never want to
return before I spoke Spanish decently.
This has become one of my traveling
ethics. Everyone must set his or her own
guidelines. But most importantly, if you
care about being culturally sensitive, con
sider acknowledging that you play a role
in cultural change. This could do won
ders for your wish that change be made
appropriately.

will continue to change every day,
whether you're around or not. But with
this thing called "life," you get the privi
lege of participating in such changes. I

think it'd be a shame to regard your abili
ty to live in and affect the world around
you as "pollution."
Of course, there is the possibility of

going into foreign
and trying to shove
your ideals down
other people's
throats. In my
view, this is the life
of missionaries
and imperialists. A
good friend point
ed out, for exam
ple, that the way in
which foreign vol
unteers shape the
availability of con-

traception in Africa can lead to seri
ous health problems, so maybe it's not
okay that a particular American
makes the choice to go volunteer in
Africa if he or she will only make
things worse.
Is it okay to make things worse? This
I see as a separate issue. The possibility
that a foreigner will do bad in another
culture is not a reason for people to
avoid traveling or participating in "cul
tural diffusion." People can do "bad"
wherever they are — they don't need to
travel to show ignorance or intolerance
to one another. Good guidelines for
traveling abroad, then, are not to rub
off on others as little as possible, but
rather, to act like a good person should.
Be respectful at home and be respectful
away from home. Care about people
and the world around you, no matter
where you are. These rules don't
change along with national borders.
Another important consideration relat
ing particularly to the idea of influencing
"indigenous cultures" is that you weren't

bom into the only culture that can critically
think. People raised in other countries' in
digenous cultures, for example, can choose
just as well as you (and actually better) how
they should deal with outside influences and
new information. No one needs you to tell
them whether or not to absorb your influ
ence or the influence of other foreigners.
Though it may be one thing for you
to stroll into Oaxaca, Mexico and lobby
for English to be the only language, it is
another altogether for you to go teach
English there to those who want to
leam. By offering an educational op
portunity, you are not forcing anything
down anyone's throat, and by partici
pating in the diffusion of English, you
are not leading to the demise of indige
nous Mexican cultures. Besides, if the
skill you offer is in demand, then if not
you, someone else will be the teacher.
The fact of the matter is, things in the
world will change. Given this, you should
make your choices about whether to
travel by deciding: 1) Whether it is im
portant to you and 2) Whether you can
do so in the way that you want to. Just be
thoughtful. I learned during my first trip
to South America that I'd never want to
return before I spoke Spanish decently.
This has become one of my traveling
ethics. Everyone must set his or her own
guidelines. But most importantly, if you
care about being culturally sensitive, con
sider acknowledging that you play a role
in cultural change. This could do won
ders for your wish that change be made
appropriately.

I'm leaving on Thursday to go
spend a little more time in South
America. Each of my trips thus
far has been for a different pur
pose. The first trip, to Venezuela, was
strictly vacation. Next was a study
abroad in Santiago. Later that year I
did my thesis research in Ecuador.
This time, I'm going to do an adven
ture race in Patagonia. While each of
these experiences is noteworthy to
me, none stray far from the beaten
path of a Stanford student. Around
these parts, I've been hard-pressed to
find someone who hasn't been
"abroad" in some capacity. (Does this
differ for engineers? I'm not sure.)
Something I've also encountered
while at Stanford, at least in my circles,
is the notion that it's vitally important to
preserve indigenous cultures. Likewise,
I've heard many students question
whether they should ever be traveling
in remote areas (even though they still
do it) where their "modern world" in
fluence might somehow change the cul
ture or quaintness therein. In a related
vein, I have myself questioned whether
I could ever live or work in a country
very different from my native one, be
cause I am unsure about whether I
could ever understand another nation's
culture enough to function sufficiently
sensitively in my daily life there.
While such values and fears are valid
for how they reflect people's sensitivity to
the world, they skirt one of life's unavoid
able truths. Things change. It is a simple
truth to say that cultures, both "indige
nous" and "modern," are changing and
will continue to change every day,
whether you're around or not. But with
this thing called "life," you get the privi
lege of participating in such changes. I
