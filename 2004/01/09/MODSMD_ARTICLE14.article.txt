## Teaching reading well is critical to students' future academic success 
### HERBERT J. WALBERG 
Because learning in most subjects de
pends on reading skills, reading profi
ciency can be considered the most im
portant goal in the early grades. Yet a
National Assessment of Educational Progress
survey shows that only 29 percent of fourth
graders are proficient in reading. Children who
fall substantially behind in reading in the early
grades are unlikely to catch up — meaning
that the process of dropping out of high school
often starts in the early years.
The problem is more acute for children who
live in poverty. By age 4, poor children are ex
posed to about 13 million words used by their
parents, mostly in simple sentences, whereas

the affluent child is exposed to about 45 million
words, often in more complex sentences.
Researchers have synthesized a great num
ber of control-group studies that reveal scien
tific principles for effectively teaching reading.
Preschoolers, for example, benefit greatly from
talking with and receiving coaching from their
parents, from whom they learn vocabulary,
grammar, pronunciation and a general knowl
edge of the world. Their parents and teachers
can also foster sound and letter recognition,
knowledge of how letters combine to form
sounds and "decoding," or sounding out words.
After mastering these elements, students
need sufficient practice to gain fluency and
meaningful oral reading. If fourth graders are
still struggling with sounding out words, and if

they need a tongue between their teeth to re
member the sound blend of "th," they are un
likely to enjoy reading and thrive academical
ly. The more students read out loud and to
themselves, the more they build their fluency
as well as their vocabulary and the knowledge
to understand new texts.
As readers progress, they learn "compre
hension strategy" — the identification of ques
tions or purposes — to guide their reading and
measure their progress. They need explicit in
struction in how to skim material for a quick
overview or to find a given fact or idea, but
they also need to learn to read a poem or sci
entific passage reflectively, intensively and
perhaps repeatedly until they have a deep and
thorough understanding. Skilled readers have

learned to adapt such methods to their purpos
es and to look for milestones of their progress.
Wise teachers know the inefficiency of
teaching students things they already know
and things they are not yet able to learn. Par
ents, teachers and students themselves can
make reading time more efficient by choosing
material that is sufficiently — but not overly
— challenging. Moreover, choosing material
that is inherently interesting for particular stu
dents may enhance motivation.
Finally, students need to know how they are
progressing. Conversations with teachers and
parents, classroom discussions and quizzes and
formal examinations can provide useful infor
mation about students' mastery of texts and
the strengths and weaknesses of their specific

reading skills.
Each of these principles has an excellent
record of fostering skilled, masterful reading.
If all children were afforded the scientific
principles for effectively teaching reading,
perhaps nine in ten rather than three in ten
would be proficient readers by fourth grade,
and we could expect their success to show in
later grades and in high school completion
rates.
