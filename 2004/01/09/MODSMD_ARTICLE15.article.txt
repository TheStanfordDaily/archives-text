## Childress eeks out win with 9 seconds to play 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
TEMPE, Ariz. — No. 4 Stanford (12-0, 3-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) went into Wells Fargo Arena
expecting to face a hostile Arizona State student
section and an offensively dominant forward in
Pac-10 leading scorer Ike Diogu. Neither was a
huge factor in the first half, although the Cardinal
barely escaped Tempe with a 63-62 victory.
The student section, which drew criticism from
Arizona head coach Lute Olson last weekend
after the Wildcats beat the Sun Devils by 19 at
Wells Fargo Arena, didn't seem all that vulgar and
Stanford's other concern, Diogu, was stifled of
fensively by an aggressive Cardinal defensive
scheme.
Needless to say, the sophomore forward is the
main attraction at Arizona State. He's the Sun
Devils (6-5, 0-2) first Associated Press Preseason
All-American ever and he's the reason why ex
pectations are much higher than usual for that
"other" team out in the desert this season.
But with all that national attention and all
those heightened expectations come a heightened
awareness by opposing teams whenever he's on
the court.
The Cardinal drove this point home last night
in its 63-62 victory over the Sun Devils, holding
Diogu to a seven points and only one field goal in
the first half.
Diogu saw a Stanford double-team every time
he caught the ball in the low-post as Stanford hus
tled its way to a 37-24 first half lead.
Before last night's game Diogu was averaging
23.7 points and nine rebounds per game.
Stanford held him to 13 and six, off 4-of-8
shooting from the field.
All this isn't to say that ASU didn't put up
quite a fight. After the Cardinal went on a 17-7
run to close the first half — a run that was primar
ily led by Stanford's second-string — the Sun
Devils quickly closed the 13-point gap.
Freshman forward Serge Angounou scored his
first points of the day when he hit a wide-open 17-
footer with just under seven minutes to go in the
game, putting the Sun Devils up 56-55.
"Give Arizona State credit, they played a great
second half," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "We're fortunate to get out of here
with a win, I don't think there's any question
about that."

While the Cardinal held Diogu in check for
the majority of the match, ASU guards Jason
Braxton and Stevie Moore kept the Sun Devils in
the game. The athletic duo combined for 30
points, scoring off slashing layups and tough
jumpers.
The game between Stanford and ASU in Tempe
went down to the wire last season as well. Stan
ford barely edged out ASU at Wells Fargo Arena,
escaping with a 58-57 victory over the Sun Devils.
Childress put Stanford ahead for good last year
with 40 seconds remaining in the match when he
scored on a late put-back.
This game was eerily similar.
With 1:29 remaining in the game and Stanford
down by three, a foul by ASU's Moore sent sopho
more Chris Hernandez to the line. The redshirt
sophomore hit both free throws bringing the Car
dinal within one-point, down 62-61.
After the Sun Devils failed to convert on the
other end — Braxton missed a free throw in a
one-and-one situation with 20 seconds left on the
clock — Stanford got the ball back for one last
possession.
Hernandez found senior forward Justin Davis
down on the low-post, Davis missed the layup, but
Childress was close behind on the rebound and
slammed the ball through the rim, bringing the
score to 63-62 in favor of the Cardinal and silenc
ing an upset-hungry Sun Devil crowd with nine
seconds remaining on the clock. Davis finished
the game with 11 points.
"That's one of those make-or-break situa
tions," Montgomery said. "Josh [has] got long
arms and he's a good rebounder."
"Josh made a big play [...]" added senior guard
Matt Lottich, who led all scorers with 18 points off
6-of-15 shooting. "I'm sure he likes this building."
Childress once again came off the bench and
played limited minutes in the Cardinal victory.
Childress played in his third game of the season
and scored 14 points, including the game-winning
basket, in just 26 minutes against the Sun Devils.
The Sun Devils are coming off their first 20-win
season since 1995 and because of a rigorous Pac
10 schedule have been forced to play back-to-back
games against top-five teams for the first time in
over 20 years.
The unbeaten Cardinal will travel to Tucson
next to take on No. 3 Arizona on Saturday. Tipoff
is set for 3:30 p.m. (PST) and will be televised on
Fox Sports Net.

huge factor in the first half, although the Cardinal
barely escaped Tempe with a 63-62 victory.
The student section, which drew criticism from
Arizona head coach Lute Olson last weekend
after the Wildcats beat the Sun Devils by 19 at
Wells Fargo Arena, didn't seem all that vulgar and
Stanford's other concern, Diogu, was stifled of
fensively by an aggressive Cardinal defensive
scheme.
Needless to say, the sophomore forward is the
main attraction at Arizona State. He's the Sun
Devils (6-5, 0-2) first Associated Press Preseason
All-American ever and he's the reason why ex
pectations are much higher than usual for that
"other" team out in the desert this season.
But with all that national attention and all
those heightened expectations come a heightened
awareness by opposing teams whenever he's on
the court.
The Cardinal drove this point home last night
in its 63-62 victory over the Sun Devils, holding
Diogu to a seven points and only one field goal in
the first half.
Diogu saw a Stanford double-team every time
he caught the ball in the low-post as Stanford hus
tled its way to a 37-24 first half lead.
Before last night's game Diogu was averaging
23.7 points and nine rebounds per game.
Stanford held him to 13 and six, off 4-of-8
shooting from the field.
All this isn't to say that ASU didn't put up
quite a fight. After the Cardinal went on a 17-7
run to close the first half — a run that was primar
ily led by Stanford's second-string — the Sun
Devils quickly closed the 13-point gap.
Freshman forward Serge Angounou scored his
first points of the day when he hit a wide-open 17-
footer with just under seven minutes to go in the
game, putting the Sun Devils up 56-55.
"Give Arizona State credit, they played a great
second half," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "We're fortunate to get out of here
with a win, I don't think there's any question
about that."

While the Cardinal held Diogu in check for
the majority of the match, ASU guards Jason
Braxton and Stevie Moore kept the Sun Devils in
the game. The athletic duo combined for 30
points, scoring off slashing layups and tough
jumpers.
The game between Stanford and ASU in Tempe
went down to the wire last season as well. Stan
ford barely edged out ASU at Wells Fargo Arena,
escaping with a 58-57 victory over the Sun Devils.
Childress put Stanford ahead for good last year
with 40 seconds remaining in the match when he
scored on a late put-back.
This game was eerily similar.
With 1:29 remaining in the game and Stanford
down by three, a foul by ASU's Moore sent sopho
more Chris Hernandez to the line. The redshirt
sophomore hit both free throws bringing the Car
dinal within one-point, down 62-61.
After the Sun Devils failed to convert on the
other end — Braxton missed a free throw in a
one-and-one situation with 20 seconds left on the
clock — Stanford got the ball back for one last
possession.
Hernandez found senior forward Justin Davis
down on the low-post, Davis missed the layup, but
Childress was close behind on the rebound and
slammed the ball through the rim, bringing the
score to 63-62 in favor of the Cardinal and silenc
ing an upset-hungry Sun Devil crowd with nine
seconds remaining on the clock. Davis finished
the game with 11 points.
"That's one of those make-or-break situa
tions," Montgomery said. "Josh [has] got long
arms and he's a good rebounder."
"Josh made a big play [...]" added senior guard
Matt Lottich, who led all scorers with 18 points off
6-of-15 shooting. "I'm sure he likes this building."
Childress once again came off the bench and
played limited minutes in the Cardinal victory.
Childress played in his third game of the season
and scored 14 points, including the game-winning
basket, in just 26 minutes against the Sun Devils.
The Sun Devils are coming off their first 20-win
season since 1995 and because of a rigorous Pac
10 schedule have been forced to play back-to-back
games against top-five teams for the first time in
over 20 years.
The unbeaten Cardinal will travel to Tucson
next to take on No. 3 Arizona on Saturday. Tipoff
is set for 3:30 p.m. (PST) and will be televised on
Fox Sports Net.

TEMPE, Ariz. — No. 4 Stanford (12-0, 3-0 Pa
cific 10 Conference) went into Wells Fargo Arena
expecting to face a hostile Arizona State student
section and an offensively dominant forward in
Pac-10 leading scorer Ike Diogu. Neither was a
huge factor in the first half, although the Cardinal
barely escaped Tempe with a 63-62 victory.
