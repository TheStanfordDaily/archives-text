# Despite injury. Powell dominates

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team (12-2, 5-0 Pacific 10 Conference) has had
better halves — to say the least. However, the
Cardinal was able to escape from Maples
Pavilion with a 60-46 victory over Arizona
State last night.
The first half of Stanford's matchup with Ari
zona State (8-5, 2-2) was easily its ugliest of the
season. Stanford had 13 turnovers — more than
double what it had in the duration of its win over
Washington last Sunday.
"I don't think anyone was having a big cele
bration in the locker room after this one," Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I think
this really got our attention."
The turnovers led to a low-scoring affair, with
the two teams combining for just 48 points in the
first half (a 27-21 Cardinal lead).
Arizona State employed a scrappy, aggressive
defense and it gave the Cardinal fits all night.
The Sun Devils stayed on top of the Stanford
shooters — allowing the fewest open looks from
behind the three-point arc that the Cardinal had
seen in quite a few games.
Three point firepower was what allowed the
Cardinal to break open its past two games —
sinking an astounding 26 treys at a 59.1 percent
clip in its past two victories at Washington and
Washington State — but the Cardinal hit just 5-

16 last night, four coming off the hands of senior
forward Nicole Powell.
Most notably, junior Sebnem Kimyacioglu,
who seemed to have broken out of her season
long slump after averaging 15.8 points per game
in the Cardinal's last four matchups, hit just one
field goal on 1-8 shooting.
The Cardinal's offensive woes allowed ASU
to stay in the game and forced Powell to play 37
minutes on a recovering ankle. However, Powell
showed no signs that she had severely sprained
her ankle less than three weeks ago.
After scoring 11 points in the first half, Powell
simply took over in the second — just when she
was needed most.
With 8:05 to go in the second half and the
feisty Sun Devils trailing by just three points,
Powell went on an almost super-human run. She
scored 11 straight Cardinal points, stretching a
42-39 Stanford lead to 53-42 in a span of just 3:50.
While Powell clearly became the focal point of
the Stanford offense, she would not admit to
making a conscience effort to take over the
game.
"I think I just tried to let the game come to
me," Powell said.
"I felt like I had some open looks and I just
tried to knock them down. I think we missed a lot
of layups in the first half."
Powell just missed out on a double-double,
finishing with 29 points, nine rebounds and four
steals.

"She's so versatile and can play both inside
and outside so well," said Arizona State junior
guard Betsy Boardman, who guarded Powell for
most of the evening.
Powell's offense was backed up by excellent
team defense. In the final eight minutes the Sun
Devils made just three field goals.
ASU head coach Charli Turner-Thome at
tributed her team's stagnant offense to an inabil
ity to get into a flow, which was partially due to
her team's defensive style.
"We don't necessarily like to play that slow of
a game," Turner-Thorne said. "But it seemed to
be the best way to go against Stanford.
In addition to taking away the Cardinal's
three point shot, ASU played excellent defense
down low, holding Stanford's key post players —
Kristen Newlin, Azella Perryman and T'Nae
Thiel — to a combined nine points.
The Cardinal was without the services of se
nior center Chelsea Trotter who was forced to sit
with knee pain, a problem that has plagued her
throughout her Stanford career.
The Cardinal will be without Trotter for what
VanDerveer called an "indeterminate" amount
of time. And, unfortunately for Stanford, she will
definitely miss Saturday's key matchup with Ari
zona. Last year, Trotter played an integral role in
slowing down the Wildcats' star-sophomore
Shawntinice Polk.
Stanford faces Arizona Saturday at 2 p.m. As
always, the game will be broadcast on KZSU.
