# Enough with the holiday treats, it's time for a run
## 
### 
Let's start by saying that some of you
are going to relate, and the rest of
you probably like eating at McDon
ald's or have gym memberships.

Oh, and happy 2004 to you all.
Fall quarter was such a soul
sucking energy leech that I spent
most of my vacation sleeping in.
My alarm clock curiously went out
of commission during finals week
and stayed that way all break.
Some would take that as a sign to
ask Santa for a new alarm clock. I
just slept in.
And every late morning / early
afternoon I faced the same certain

future. I had to run. No, it wasn't a flashback
to the drudgery of track team. Besides, I had
long relieved my determined father-turned
personal-running coach of his duties, and it
was only slightly a "too many holiday cook
ies 21st century female guilt stay fit" thing.
This is where I'm going to lose a lot of you.

A lot of you can't understand why some of us
have to run. I'll be the first to tell you it's sick,
really. It's definitely not fun, unless you con
sider the relief of finishing, and no one looks

forward to it, you just look forward to
being done. But once a runner, you
can't turn back. Come injury or a new
swimming hobby, there is that sneaky
little guilt creeping after you like
Smeagol / Gollum on a cold night
camping on some rock. Good movie,
bad analogy.
Even in this clan of runner slaves,
there are a few weirdos. The Ro
driguez sisters in high school had
matching tattoos, matching broken

legs they ran on and come tears or blood or
vomit, or all three mixed together, they ran.
It was just sick. Then there was this really
nice blond girl who hadn't yet experienced
the full, perpetual bloated burden of puber
ty. We'd be doing hill sprints and she'd
smoke everyone, effortlessly skipping

around flowers and bushes along the way,
smiling. Straight out of "The Sound of
Music", which my dad forced me to see over
break, by the way. My mom had gotten the two of
them tickets and he pulled one of those "I just got
laser surgery on my eyes and can't see well enough
to appreciate it" excuses.
You can try other things. Long hikes in
the wilderness, intramurals, yoga, ballet.
They'll all keep you in shape and make you
grow in different, vital ways. Except intra
murals, which are pointless. But swimming,
spinning, Ashtanga, none of it does it for run
ners in quite the same way.
So I procrastinated, ran, binged, slept in,
ran, ate some more seven layer bars, walked,
until the day after Christmas, I went on a
long slow run and unexpectedly realized I
loved it. I loved breathing hard and feeling
tired and sweating. I loved it in the first mile,
I loved it in the final stretch and everything in
between, I loved pissing off the traffic cop
when I ran in front of all the holiday traffic by

the mall. I felt some shadow of disappoint
ment when I crossed the finish line, endor
phin high and all.
Before you think I'm getting all inspira
tional, or discovered some fundamental
truth in life, within 10 minutes I was
downing ginger snaps and within 24
hours I was over loving anything about
running and procrastinating again. Call
it the Stanford personality. Call it not
knowing how to sit still.
But let's face it. We're going to have to ex
ercise our entire lives if we want to put off
getting all flabby and broken down. You
know, when your muscle mass deteriorates
into monstrous arm flaps or disappears
under a bluish wrinkly layer of chapped
skin? Old age is not pretty. Very few people
age well, very few have access to plastic
surgery, very few who get it done don't look
freaky, and the rest of us are going to have to
work regularly at staying healthy. Sounds
basic, and you'd think more people would be

down. Oh, and a good 50 percent or so of us
are going to bitch about why we didn't take
advantage and stay in shape when we were
"in our prime."
I'm not getting all superficial on you, I sim
ply would not like getting up from my rocker
and walking to the bathroom to be a ten
minute painful ordeal when I'm (fill in appro
priate old age). These bodies are with us till
the end, so we can sit back while they slowly
decay and our grandkids think we smell
funny, or we can get back into nature a few
times a week, sweat a little just like archaic
man did back in the day, and age healthy.
I would say go find a fun exercise hobby, but
most of you have already doomed yourselves to
bad old age anyway. And for all the addicts at
Stanford: It's not supposed to be fun.

has been going on long slow compensatory
runs ever since.
