# Turnovers plague women
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Where's the ball? Someone need
ed to clue in both teams during last
night's Stanford/Arizona State match
up.
Stanford got a good scare last
night, when the turnovers and lack of
perimeter shooting brought Arizona
State within two points of the Cardi
nal.
"We have to take care of the ball,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We know that, but it was rein
forced."
For most of the game it seemed
like neither team was making any
thing but turnovers. That may be an
overstatement, but shooting for the
Card was way down in the beginning
of the first half.
Stanford led the way with 13
turnovers at the half, but the Sun Dev
ils came close with 11. By the end of
the game, Arizona State was ahead
slightly with 21 turnovers to Stan
ford's 19. Prior to the game, both
teams had similar turnover records,
with Stanford averaging 15.5 and Ari
zona State averaging 14.5 a game.
Stanford was already approaching its
average at the half.
In the first 11 minutes of the game,
senior guard Susan Borchardt had
nine points and two turnovers, and a
few careless-looking passes that
weren't in keeping with her usual ball
handling.
And while she may have been one
of the few Cardinal women besides
senior forward Nicole Powell who
was scoring, she wasn't the only one
giving up the ball.
Stanford led only 27-21 at the half
against Arizona State. It's possible
that Stanford has had a worse first half
this season, but this was by far its slop
piest Pac-10 game.
VanDerveer attributed the
turnovers against the Sun Devils to
the intensely physical style of the op
posing team.
"Some of it was just adjusting to
how physical and aggressive they
were," VanDerveer said. "They had
more [turnovers] than us [by the end.]"
Anzona State head coach Charli
Turner Thorne didn't think that
turnovers were the problem for the
Sun Devils.
"I don't think we had too many
turnovers to win, but we just didn't get
it done on the other end," Thorne
said.
VanDerveer felt that the Cardinal
was influenced by the repeated
turnovers of the Sun Devils.

"Sometimes, they're kind of con
tagious. You turn over. They turn
over. I was getting used to playing
with them right up on them. Guys
would say they were in their shirt, and
that's something different to play
against."
Maybe the Cardinal decided to
take it easy and save their energy for
Arizona on Saturday. Maybe the
physicality of the Sun Devils was a
tough match for Stanford.
But even going up against an in
your-face team is no excuse for nearly
20 turnovers: They've been a problem
for the Cardinal all season.
The Cardinal may have had its
lowest number of turnovers this sea
son during last Sunday's game against
Washington, but in three of its last
seven games Stanford has had 20 or
more turnovers. Its season high was
during its loss to No. 2 Texas Tech,
when it finished the game with 22.
VanDerveer may attribute this
game's numbers to the toughness of
the Sun Devils, and the fact that the
season high came against Texas Tech
and 20 more came from Tennessee
seems to support that.
The Cardinal just doesn't have the
same physical strength as a lot of the
top teams. Arizona State isn't even a
ranked team, but it highlighted one of

Stanford's biggest weaknesses.
The Cardinal is a smart team, but it
has difficulty when bodies are being
knocked around. And this lack of
sheer athleticism may keep the Cardi
nal out of the top four this year.
The turnovers eased slightly in the
second half of last night's game, but
the shots still weren't there, allowing
Arizona State to creep ever closer to
Stanford, narrowing the Cardinal
lead to two points, before Powell
opened the game up with her 11
straight points in the second half.
Both Powell and VanDerveer
tried to deny that she "took over the
game."
But let's be honest. The game was
all Nicole Powell. With almost half of
the game's 60 points, and the scoring
streak that served as the catalyst for a
strong Cardinal win, Powell made the
game. When she stopped letting the
other players have the ball to take
missed shots, Powell started up the
game. Both Arizona and Stanford are
the two remaining undefeated teams
in the Pac-10.
Her brief time out during winter
break in order to nurse her ankle gave
the other players a chance to shine.
However, Powell is back. It's hard for
anyone else to shine when she is on
the court.

against Arizona State. It's possible
that Stanford has had a worse first half
this season, but this was by far its slop
piest Pac-10 game.
VanDerveer attributed the
turnovers against the Sun Devils to
the intensely physical style of the op
posing team.
"Some of it was just adjusting to
how physical and aggressive they
were," VanDerveer said. "They had
more [turnovers] than us [by the end.]"
Anzona State head coach Charli
Turner Thorne didn't think that
turnovers were the problem for the
Sun Devils.
"I don't think we had too many
turnovers to win, but we just didn't get
it done on the other end," Thorne
said.
VanDerveer felt that the Cardinal
was influenced by the repeated
turnovers of the Sun Devils.

"Sometimes, they're kind of con
tagious. You turn over. They turn
over. I was getting used to playing
with them right up on them. Guys
would say they were in their shirt, and
that's something different to play
against."
Maybe the Cardinal decided to
take it easy and save their energy for
Arizona on Saturday. Maybe the
physicality of the Sun Devils was a
tough match for Stanford.
But even going up against an in
your-face team is no excuse for nearly
20 turnovers: They've been a problem
for the Cardinal all season.
The Cardinal may have had its
lowest number of turnovers this sea
son during last Sunday's game against
Washington, but in three of its last
seven games Stanford has had 20 or
more turnovers. Its season high was
during its loss to No. 2 Texas Tech,
when it finished the game with 22.
VanDerveer may attribute this
game's numbers to the toughness of
the Sun Devils, and the fact that the
season high came against Texas Tech
and 20 more came from Tennessee
seems to support that.
The Cardinal just doesn't have the
same physical strength as a lot of the
top teams. Arizona State isn't even a
ranked team, but it highlighted one of

Stanford's biggest weaknesses.
The Cardinal is a smart team, but it
has difficulty when bodies are being
knocked around. And this lack of
sheer athleticism may keep the Cardi
nal out of the top four this year.
The turnovers eased slightly in the
second half of last night's game, but
the shots still weren't there, allowing
Arizona State to creep ever closer to
Stanford, narrowing the Cardinal
lead to two points, before Powell
opened the game up with her 11
straight points in the second half.
Both Powell and VanDerveer
tried to deny that she "took over the
game."
But let's be honest. The game was
all Nicole Powell. With almost half of
the game's 60 points, and the scoring
streak that served as the catalyst for a
strong Cardinal win, Powell made the
game. When she stopped letting the
other players have the ball to take
missed shots, Powell started up the
game. Both Arizona and Stanford are
the two remaining undefeated teams
in the Pac-10.
Her brief time out during winter
break in order to nurse her ankle gave
the other players a chance to shine.
However, Powell is back. It's hard for
anyone else to shine when she is on
the court.

Where's the ball? Someone need
ed to clue in both teams during last
night's Stanford/Arizona State match
up.
Stanford got a good scare last
night, when the turnovers and lack of
perimeter shooting brought Arizona
State within two points of the Cardi
nal.
"We have to take care of the ball,"
said head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"We know that, but it was rein
forced."
For most of the game it seemed
like neither team was making any
thing but turnovers. That may be an
overstatement, but shooting for the
Card was way down in the beginning
of the first half.
Stanford led the way with 13
turnovers at the half, but the Sun Dev
ils came close with 11. By the end of
the game, Arizona State was ahead
slightly with 21 turnovers to Stan
ford's 19. Prior to the game, both
teams had similar turnover records,
with Stanford averaging 15.5 and Ari
zona State averaging 14.5 a game.
Stanford was already approaching its
average at the half.
In the first 11 minutes of the game,
senior guard Susan Borchardt had
nine points and two turnovers, and a
few careless-looking passes that
weren't in keeping with her usual ball
handling.
And while she may have been one
of the few Cardinal women besides
senior forward Nicole Powell who
was scoring, she wasn't the only one
giving up the ball.
Stanford led only 27-21 at the half
against Arizona State. It's possible
that Stanford has had a worse first half
this season, but this was by far its slop
piest Pac-10 game.
