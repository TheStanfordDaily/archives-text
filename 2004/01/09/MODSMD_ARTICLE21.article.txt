# In Olympic year, Card competes against top competitor, Michigan
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's swimming team left
the comfort and relative warmth of the Farm yes
terday morning to take on No. 6 Michigan in Ann
Arbor. The first session of the meet begins
tonight, which the conclusion of the meet sched
uled for tomorrow afternoon.
Although below the freezing point outside, the
competition in the indoor pool will be hot and
fierce. Like the Cardinal (2-0), the Wolverines
(2-3) are a perennial swimming powerhouse and
should provide tough competition, though during
last year's dual meet Stanford topped Michigan
148.5-89.5.
Michigan is known for its strong distance
swimming program, led by sophomores Peter
Vanderkaay and Davis Tarwater. Vanderkaay
earned NCCA All-American honors as a fresh
man last year, and Tarwater, also a freshman last
year, distinguished himself as a valuable competi
tor for the Wolverines. The Cardinal, however,
also boasts a power-packed roster, including,
freshman Shaun Phillips, a distance guru himself,
and versatile sophomore Tobias Oriwol.
Almost more important than the opponent for
the Cardinal is the pool setup in which they are
racing. Basic competitive swimming allows for

three different courses. Short and long course
meters yield 25-meter and 50-meter length pools,
respectively. A short course yards setup produces
a 25-yard pool and stands as the basic format for
the majority of NCAA competitions.
The only exception to the NCAA format of short
course yards occurs during an Olympic year.
Every fourth year, the NCAA championship
meet is held in a short course meters format.
However, most regular meets throughout that
season, including the Pacific 10 Conference
Swimming Championship, are still held in short
course yards.
Since 2004 is an Olympic year, the NCAA
championship meet will be held in short course
meters come this March. In order to help prepare
themselves for the course switch, the teams de
cided to hold this weekend's meet in short course
meters. Although the sheer difference in length
equates to only one or two strokes per lap, the
times do change significantly. Because of the un
familiarity of the format, swimmers will not be as
focused on the times themselves.
"In years past we have focused on getting best
times," senior tri-captain Scott Ransenberg said.
"But this year people are concentrating more on
racing and less on the time standards. It brings a
whole different atmosphere to the meets."
