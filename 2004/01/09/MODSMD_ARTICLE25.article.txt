5 Worst Reality TV Shows of2003 That You Watched Anyway
1. "The Surreal Life" — I'd like to shake the hand of the man who
thought it would be a great idea to shove the seven most pathetic people
alive — MC Hammer, Brande Roderick, Corey Feldman, Gabrielle Car
teris, Vince Neil, Jerri Manthey and for godsakes Emmanuel Lewis — into
a house together.
2. "Road Rules/Real World Challenge: The Gauntlet" — Why the
same five episodes of this unbelievably boring and uninteresting show are
replayed over and over again on MTV is something I will never understand.
3. "Average Joe" — What a surprise, a former beauty queen with the IQ
of a celery stick chooses the chiseled stud instead of the awkward "Average
Joe."
4. "Room Raiders" — This show is pure class: college students with
painfully strong Long Island accents who permanently belong in Cancun
choose among three people based on the skankiness of their underwear and
the stains on their bed.
5. "Ex-treme Dating" — The terrifyingly annoying host and lack of witty
commentary make this one sorry excuse for a dating show.
Five Most Entertaining Reality TV Shows of 2003
1. "Joe Millionaire" — Who can forget Evan and Sarah getting it on in
the bushes complete with slurping sounds, Mojo's 20 piece puzzle of herself,
and Evan's skillful use of the English language? (It's domestic you dumb
ass.)
2. "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" — All I want for my birthday is the
Fab Five.

3. "NewlyWeds" — Her refusal
to eat buffalo wings because she
"doesn't eat buffalo," her confusion
over Chicken of the sea and her con
stant references to her bodily func
tions are only some of the gems that
come from Jessica Simpson's mouth.
4. "Real World Paris" — The fa
miliar characters are still there for the
show that started it all: the pretty vir
gin, charming frat boy, fashionable
gay man — and this time there's even
a cocky Stanford kid!
5. "The Simple Life" — Sticking
her hand up a cow's ass and dressing
up like a giant hamburger, Paris
Hilton has come a long way since the
sex video.
