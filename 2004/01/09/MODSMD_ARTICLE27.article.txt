COLD MOUNTAIN
3 stars
A gripping, yet tedious account
of an unrequited romance between a
prim and proper preacher's daugh
ter (Nicole Kidman) and a mild man
nered laborer (jude Law). Artfully told
by director Anthony Minghella ("The
English Patient"), the true beauty of
the film lies in what is left unsaid,
rather than what is said. When it is
said, it is said best by Ruby (Renee
Zellweger), who steals the show and
gives hope to an otherwise bleak
and depressing story.
Kidman and Law give tour-de
force performances as they capture
the heartache of souls ravaged by
the civil war. Minghella's film is both
subtle and harsh, haunting and hope
less. <***. iL /\jL| '
