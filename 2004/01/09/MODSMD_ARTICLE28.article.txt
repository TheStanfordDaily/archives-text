## Intermission interviews one of the sexiest men alive 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
There's something about Ben Affleck. Maybe it's the undeniable sex appeal.
Maybe it's the never-ending romance rumors. Maybe it's the charming charis
ma.
Whatever it is, that je ne se quai keeps audiences clamoring for more.
After co-writing "Good Will Hunting" with childhood pal Matt Damon,
tearing up the movie screen with blockbusters like "Armageddon" and pro
ducing the reality television series "Project Greenlight," it would seem Affleck
is more than just another pretty face. But how does Ben Affleck truly see him
self?
"7 think I see myself as somebody who is not totally limited to doing any of
those things and lama product of a kind of a time in movies when a lot of those
boundaries were kind of being broken down and guys like Kevin Smith were sort
of doing all these different things in all these different ways and so it did not seem
that unusual for me to take on a bunch of different roles.
"I was an actor when I was child so I always sort of think of myself as an actor
but it is something that I sort of feel like I want to graduate from for some odd rea
son. Iam not sure if that is rational or if that is my own insecurity or the fact that
I did not graduate, for example, from college so I am just yearning to graduate
from somewhere. But that is how I feel right now."
Affleck's latest role casts him as Michael Jennings, a reverse engineer, in the
psychological action film "Paycheck." Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick,
who also inspired "Blade Runner" and "Minority Report," and under the di
rection of John Woo ("MI:2"), Affleck considered it a winning combination.
11 1 am a huge fan of science fiction in general and Philip K. Dick in particular,
and an enormous fan of John Woo. So it really made the decision [to do the filmJ
quite easy...
"I had not read 'Paycheck' actually until I got the script and I thought,' This
is really smart. It is sort of unusually smart for a Hollywood blockbuster type
movie... '
"I think I was really excited that you had the combination of a visual kind of
stylist like John Woo with a really strong story from Philip K. Dick. It seemed
like a real no-brainer to me to do the movie."
One of the perks of working with director John Woo, known for his charac
teristic action sequences such as the slow-motion motorcycle fight scene in
"Mission Impossible 2," was the chance to do some real stunt-work. "Pay
check" afforded Affleck the opportunity to bring his love of motorcycle-riding
to the big screen. But did he really do all his own stunts?
"And if you didn't why are you such a pussy? Yes, I did some and I did not
do others. What keeps you from doing them is that the insurance people kind of
will not let you to a certain extent. I just think as an actor it is your job. You should
do as much of it as they will let you do. It also looks better and works better for
the movie. Sometimes a stuntman can be really obvious and it takes me out of
the movie and it is hard to suspend belief when all of a sudden there is the guy with
the bad wig on who is like flying behind the boat or whatever he is doing. So I
think I have tried to do as much as I possibly can.
"I think it makes the movie better. When I did not it was because they said,
'No.' John was very protective and sometimes he would sort of stop me from try
ing to do stuff. But I was pretty game to do as much as I could."
With "Paycheck" in theaters now, what is next for Ben Affleck? First, a
Kevin Smith ("Clerks," "Dogma") film, "Jersey Girl," which will be released
March 19.
"7 loved the movie. I think it is easily Kevin Smith's best movie. It is proba
bly my favorite movie I have ever been in and I just think it is great. One of the
reasons why I did not sweat the sort of cataclysmic disastrous reception of 'Gigli'
was because I really knew that I had something great coming out. I have that to
look forward to and that is a movie that I am enormously proud of."
And then what? Would he consider reuniting with Matt Damon on future
projects?
"7 would like to collaborate again with Matt Damon. We wrote 'Good Will
Hunting' to get ourselves work as actors and so it sort of fulfilled that goal...
You know, it's like, when we were younger, in our early 20s it was like all gravy.

We all hung around with all of our friends when we were out of work and then
everybody went off and, like, got jobs and work, and it is harder to see your
friends unless you work with them.
1 want to write another script with Matt and I look forward to doing that
maybe some time towards the middle of this year, and I would like to direct it.
That is sort of the next evolution. Ultimately I would rather be I think focusing
more on writing and hopefully directing than on acting as time goes on."
With "Paycheck" grossing $38.6 million so far, it would seem Affleck is at
the top of his game. But does he have any regrets? "Gigli" maybe?
"I do not regret 'Gigli' at all. Actually, for one thing, I made a relationship dur
ing that movie that was really important to me and that is more important than
my career. Second of all, 'Gigli' was a real important movie forme because it was
a really risky role to take on. Since you take a big risk you fail. That is sort of in
herent in the nature of taking risks, but it has let me know that I was still taking
chances and being brave and not just sort of, like, doing the same middle of the
road type of stuff, and I also think I really grew a lot as an actor.
"But you know I have very few regrets. I regret in some ways that Jen and I
were so available in our relationship in kind of the early stages when we were just
getting together that we were kind of open about it, and I think that story sort of
metastasized and took on a life of its own that then turned around to be sort of
mutated and corrupted and not right. That was sort of disappointing, but again,
it is not like I am not going to make choices in my life predicated because I am
afraid they will be damaging to my career because I think that is a fast track to sell
ing your soul anyway."
