Chris Lee's Top Five Movies of2003

1. "The United States of Leland" — Nearly a whole year
after I first saw it, Matthew Ryan Hoge's screenwriting /
directorial debut remains unreleased, even with the
clout of producer Kevin Spacey. Led by Ryan Gosling's
understated performance as the title character, the
movie left me in a pensive, ethereal state that I have not
experienced again since. That or the drugs.
2. "Elephant" — Gus Van Sant's Columbine-inspired
take on a high school shooting is bold not only in its quiet,
assured direction but in its unwavering dedication to ob
jectivity; never has high school been depicted so cold and
so true. Light on message, but provocative in substance.
3. "City of God" — Directors Katia Lund and Fernando
Meirelles present a vivid, visceral portrait of living in one
of Rio de Janeiro's harshest neighborhoods, full of
crime, violence and drugs. The movie's hyperkinetic en
ergy nearly bursts off the screen to convey the raw but
precious nature of life.
4. "Pirates of the Caribbean" — A lighthearted script,
apt direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakout role
for Keira Knightley are really all here to support one
thing: Johnny Depp's quirky, inimitable performance as
Captain Jack Sparrow. Probably the most fun to be had
all year (and from Jerry Bruckheimer no less).
5. "The Last Samurai" — Like "Pirates," probably one
of the pleasant surprises of the year. Tom Cruise is up to
snuff as always, but the real star is Ken Watanabe as the
eponymous samurai. Historically questionable, but nev
ertheless a rousing mixture of "Braveheart," "Glory"
and Kurosawa that does justice to the modern epic.

4. Shock and Awe

Vauhini Yara's Top 5 Albums of 2003
1. OutKast — "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"
2. The Shins — "Chutes Too Narrow"
3. Broken Social Scene — "You Forgot It in People"
4. The Libertines — "Up the Bracket"
5. The Postal Service — "Give Up"

and what about Best Canadians?
1.Hot Hot Heat
2. Broken Social Scene
3. Stars
4. The Deadly Snakes
5. Alanis Morisette

Favorite Film: "28 Days Later" — Zombies! Danny Boyle's nightmarish
thrill-ride through post-apocalyptic England shifts effortlessly from pant-wet
ting scares to quieter, meditative moments as characters come to terms with
the end of their worlds. The film also boasts tough, memorable turns from
leads Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, an inventive script that learns all the
right lessons from George Romero's "Dead" trilogy and haunting visuals of a
ghostly, abandoned London.
Runner-up: "Capturing the Friedmans" — A creepy, cautionary study of the
disintegration of a family and a community, with brilliant use of wrenching
home videos.
Most Overrated: "Lost in Translation" — Sure, director Sophia Coppola has
a good eye, and she gets impressive, sensitive performances from Bill Murray
and Scarlett Johansson, but is there a single line of dialogue in Coppola's script
that isn't a cliche? Japanese mispronunciation is funny the first time, not so
much the tenth.
Favorite Performance: Bruce Campbell in "Bubba Ho-tep" — It's not sur
prising that Bruce Campbell does a mean impersonation of the King, nor that
said impersonation is, at times, absolutely hilarious. The real surprise is the re
gret, resignation and humanity that Campbell brings to his elderly Elvis, and
how perfectly it fits this sweet, melancholy fable of wasted fives and graceful
endings.
Favorite Scene: The House of Blue Leaves in "Kill Bill Volume 1" — The sad
fatalism in the final glance between the Bride (Uma Thurman) and O-Ren
Ishii (Lucy Liu) is breathtaking. Bloody, bloody poetry.

Will Oremus's Top 5 Albums of2003
1. Mando Diao — "Bring 'Em In": These Swedish garage rock
revivalists made the catchiest, most bitchin' rock debut since
The Strokes' "Is This It."
2. My Morning Jacket — "It Still Moves": You know when
you're driving down a two-lane country road and you crest a
hill and your stomach floats weightless for a second? That's
what this album feels like.
3. Led Zeppelin — "How the West Was Won": Pick your own
rock cliche justification for why this rock cliche live album de
serves to make the list: a) They're the greatest of all time; b)
'Nuff said.
4. The Libertines — "Up the Bracket": Appropriate that in the
year Joe Strummer died this London band emerged to sum
mon the spirit and soul of the early Clash.
5. Bubba Sparxxx — "Deliverance": With the help of Timba
land, this rural white fatboy turned country-rap from an oxy
moron to an art form.

Anna North's Top Five Movies of2003
I was going to learn French in 2003.1 was going to take up
painting. I was going to get back in touch with my old friends
from high school and be a good role model for my little broth
er. Instead, I saw movies. But you don't have to make the same
mistake. Below are the five movies most worth junking my
higher aspirations for. See only them, and you'll still have time
to take voice lessons, visit your family or untie that baby that's
lying on the train tracks. I still feel pretty bad about that one.
5. "Pirates of the Caribbean" — This film, I'll admit, has prob
lems. Don't we all. What we don't all have is Johnny Depp
sashaying up and down docks and decks in a performance he
says he based on Warner Bros, cartoon skunk Pepe LePew. He
alone catapults "Pirates" into the top five.
4. "Elephant" — So understated it almost isn't there, "Ele
phant" provides an antidote to post-Columbine hysteria.
Rarely does a filmmaker simply let you look, but that's what
Gus van Sant does here, and what we see is surprisingly lovely.
3. ".Swimming Pool" — There are five reasons to see this
movie. Four are breasts. Two belong to a woman over 40, and
their suppleness gave me hope for my future. The fifth reason
is a surprising thriller plot that lifts "The Swimming Pool"
above the level of sultry French babe-fest.
2. "City of God" — Do you like to watch a little kid shoot up a
whorehouse? Probably not, but "City of God," set in a Brazil
ian ghetto of that name, has enough beauty to make its excori
ating violence endurable. Watching this coming-of-age tale is a
little bit like getting kicked in the stomach. But afterwards you
might want to get kicked again.
1. "Mystic River" — It aspires to be the next great American
tragedy, which has sunk more than one film in a cesspool of
gloom and gore. But this movie soars, thanks to Sean Penn's
hunted-wolf ferocity and the terrible logic with which his story
unfolds. Laurence Fishburne provides some much-needed
leavening as a sarcastic cop whose eye-rolls are worth a thou
sand words.

is a surprising thriller plot that lifts "The Swimming Pool"
above the level of sultry French babe-fest.
2. "City of God" — Do you like to watch a little kid shoot up a
whorehouse? Probably not, but "City of God," set in a Brazil
ian ghetto of that name, has enough beauty to make its excori
ating violence endurable. Watching this coming-of-age tale is a
little bit like getting kicked in the stomach. But afterwards you
might want to get kicked again.
1. "Mystic River" — It aspires to be the next great American
tragedy, which has sunk more than one film in a cesspool of
gloom and gore. But this movie soars, thanks to Sean Penn's
hunted-wolf ferocity and the terrible logic with which his story
unfolds. Laurence Fishburne provides some much-needed
leavening as a sarcastic cop whose eye-rolls are worth a thou
sand words.

Chris Lee's Top Five Movies of2003

1. "The United States of Leland" — Nearly a whole year
after I first saw it, Matthew Ryan Hoge's screenwriting /
directorial debut remains unreleased, even with the
clout of producer Kevin Spacey. Led by Ryan Gosling's
understated performance as the title character, the
movie left me in a pensive, ethereal state that I have not
experienced again since. That or the drugs.
2. "Elephant" — Gus Van Sant's Columbine-inspired
take on a high school shooting is bold not only in its quiet,
assured direction but in its unwavering dedication to ob
jectivity; never has high school been depicted so cold and
so true. Light on message, but provocative in substance.
3. "City of God" — Directors Katia Lund and Fernando
Meirelles present a vivid, visceral portrait of living in one
of Rio de Janeiro's harshest neighborhoods, full of
crime, violence and drugs. The movie's hyperkinetic en
ergy nearly bursts off the screen to convey the raw but
precious nature of life.
4. "Pirates of the Caribbean" — A lighthearted script,
apt direction from Gore Verbinski and a breakout role
for Keira Knightley are really all here to support one
thing: Johnny Depp's quirky, inimitable performance as
Captain Jack Sparrow. Probably the most fun to be had
all year (and from Jerry Bruckheimer no less).
5. "The Last Samurai" — Like "Pirates," probably one
of the pleasant surprises of the year. Tom Cruise is up to
snuff as always, but the real star is Ken Watanabe as the
eponymous samurai. Historically questionable, but nev
ertheless a rousing mixture of "Braveheart," "Glory"
and Kurosawa that does justice to the modern epic.

1.Hot Hot Heat
2. Broken Social Scene
3. Stars
4. The Deadly Snakes
5. Alanis Morisette

Favorite Film: "28 Days Later" — Zombies! Danny Boyle's nightmarish
thrill-ride through post-apocalyptic England shifts effortlessly from pant-wet
ting scares to quieter, meditative moments as characters come to terms with
the end of their worlds. The film also boasts tough, memorable turns from
leads Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, an inventive script that learns all the
right lessons from George Romero's "Dead" trilogy and haunting visuals of a
ghostly, abandoned London.
Runner-up: "Capturing the Friedmans" — A creepy, cautionary study of the
disintegration of a family and a community, with brilliant use of wrenching
home videos.
Most Overrated: "Lost in Translation" — Sure, director Sophia Coppola has
a good eye, and she gets impressive, sensitive performances from Bill Murray
and Scarlett Johansson, but is there a single line of dialogue in Coppola's script
that isn't a cliche? Japanese mispronunciation is funny the first time, not so
much the tenth.
Favorite Performance: Bruce Campbell in "Bubba Ho-tep" — It's not sur
prising that Bruce Campbell does a mean impersonation of the King, nor that
said impersonation is, at times, absolutely hilarious. The real surprise is the re
gret, resignation and humanity that Campbell brings to his elderly Elvis, and
how perfectly it fits this sweet, melancholy fable of wasted fives and graceful
endings.
Favorite Scene: The House of Blue Leaves in "Kill Bill Volume 1" — The sad
fatalism in the final glance between the Bride (Uma Thurman) and O-Ren
Ishii (Lucy Liu) is breathtaking. Bloody, bloody poetry.

Will Oremus's Top 5 Albums of2003
1. Mando Diao — "Bring 'Em In": These Swedish garage rock
revivalists made the catchiest, most bitchin' rock debut since
The Strokes' "Is This It."
2. My Morning Jacket — "It Still Moves": You know when
you're driving down a two-lane country road and you crest a
hill and your stomach floats weightless for a second? That's
what this album feels like.
3. Led Zeppelin — "How the West Was Won": Pick your own
rock cliche justification for why this rock cliche live album de
serves to make the list: a) They're the greatest of all time; b)
'Nuff said.
4. The Libertines — "Up the Bracket": Appropriate that in the
year Joe Strummer died this London band emerged to sum
mon the spirit and soul of the early Clash.
5. Bubba Sparxxx — "Deliverance": With the help of Timba
land, this rural white fatboy turned country-rap from an oxy
moron to an art form.

Anna North's Top Five Movies of2003
I was going to learn French in 2003.1 was going to take up
painting. I was going to get back in touch with my old friends
from high school and be a good role model for my little broth
er. Instead, I saw movies. But you don't have to make the same
mistake. Below are the five movies most worth junking my
higher aspirations for. See only them, and you'll still have time
to take voice lessons, visit your family or untie that baby that's
lying on the train tracks. I still feel pretty bad about that one.
5. "Pirates of the Caribbean" — This film, I'll admit, has prob
lems. Don't we all. What we don't all have is Johnny Depp
sashaying up and down docks and decks in a performance he
says he based on Warner Bros, cartoon skunk Pepe LePew. He
alone catapults "Pirates" into the top five.
4. "Elephant" — So understated it almost isn't there, "Ele
phant" provides an antidote to post-Columbine hysteria.
Rarely does a filmmaker simply let you look, but that's what
Gus van Sant does here, and what we see is surprisingly lovely.
3. ".Swimming Pool" — There are five reasons to see this

higher aspirations for. See only them, and you'll still have time
to take voice lessons, visit your family or untie that baby that's
lying on the train tracks. I still feel pretty bad about that one.
5. "Pirates of the Caribbean" — This film, I'll admit, has prob
lems. Don't we all. What we don't all have is Johnny Depp
sashaying up and down docks and decks in a performance he
says he based on Warner Bros, cartoon skunk Pepe LePew. He
alone catapults "Pirates" into the top five.
4. "Elephant" — So understated it almost isn't there, "Ele
phant" provides an antidote to post-Columbine hysteria.
Rarely does a filmmaker simply let you look, but that's what
Gus van Sant does here, and what we see is surprisingly lovely.
3. ".Swimming Pool" — There are five reasons to see this
movie. Four are breasts. Two belong to a woman over 40, and
their suppleness gave me hope for my future. The fifth reason
is a surprising thriller plot that lifts "The Swimming Pool"
above the level of sultry French babe-fest.
2. "City of God" — Do you like to watch a little kid shoot up a
whorehouse? Probably not, but "City of God," set in a Brazil
ian ghetto of that name, has enough beauty to make its excori
ating violence endurable. Watching this coming-of-age tale is a
little bit like getting kicked in the stomach. But afterwards you
might want to get kicked again.
1. "Mystic River" — It aspires to be the next great American
tragedy, which has sunk more than one film in a cesspool of
gloom and gore. But this movie soars, thanks to Sean Penn's
hunted-wolf ferocity and the terrible logic with which his story
unfolds. Laurence Fishburne provides some much-needed
leavening as a sarcastic cop whose eye-rolls are worth a thou
sand words.
