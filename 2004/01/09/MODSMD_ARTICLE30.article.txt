# The 						Sexiest Hobbit Alive Intermission Interviews Elijah Wood
## 
### RYAN SANDS 
You might remember Elijah Wood as Mel
Gibson's mop-topped son in "Forever Young."
Or as that kid who rode around on a dolphin and
wore a Smashing Pumpkins' shirt in every scene
of "Flipper." Or maybe you know him as the one
who didn't get dropped off a cliff at the end of
"The Good Son." However, if you're one of the
million who have become enraptured with the
wildly successful film adaptations of JRR
Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, you
will forever know Elijah Wood as Frodo Bag
gins, hobbit and ring-bearing hero. The Decem
ber release of "The Return of the King,"
marked the end of a long, groundbreaking film
making process for its cast and crew.
In the weeks leading up to the release of "The
Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Eli
jah Wood and other cast members embarked on
a whirlwind press tour, with stops in New
Zealand, Europe, Japan and The United States.
On the morning of Dec. 3, the first day of the
film's North American press tour, I was able to
speak over the phone with Elijah Wood about
the last film in the epic trilogy.
On that day, he would take part in 14 round
table interviews, appear on "The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno" AND attend the Los Angeles
premiere of "Return of the King." Despite the
dauntingly long day of interviews ahead of him,
Elijah Wood was easy-going and cheery, speak
ing freely about his love of indie rock music,
hanging out with Macauly Caulkin as a kid, and
the bittersweet end to his four-year journey
making "The Lord of the Rings."
INTERMISSION: I heard you were just in New
Zealand again.
ELIJAH WOOD: Yeah, we went to New
Zealand for the world premiere there, which
was unbelievable. 125,000 people in the street
and people from all over the world traveled to be

out there for it. It was unbelievable; I've never
seen anything quite like it before.
INT: It must be pretty nice to get the whole
"LOTR" gang back together?
WOOD: It is. I mean, that's what's nice about
these press tours. As exhausting as they are, It's
wonderful; In some ways it's like a massive re
union. We sort of all get together again and rem
inisce about our experiences. There's a special
significance this time around, seeing as how it's
for the last film.
INT: I wanted to ask you a bunch of dorky "Lord
of the Rings" questions, but I had to ask this first,
since I just watched the movie recently; can you
share any of your "The Good Son" memories?
WOOD: [Laughs]. Um... God, I don't know. It
was a blast to work on. I lived in a small little
house when we were making it — in Rockport,
Ma. — and one of the particular interesting
events was that a huge tropical storm that hit
Massachussets during the making of the movie.
I remember one particular night, we had a sleep
over at Mac's house. The power went out, and
we ended up playing hide and go seek in the
dark, which was really fun. That's a fond memo
ry...
INT: You know, It seems like everyone our age
has this experience where they leave home for
the first time, whether they go abroad, or head
off to college. I know you were in New Zealand
for a year and a half, so did your time making the
"Lord of the Rings" films parallel that sort of ex
perience?
WOOD: Oh yeah, certainly. At 18 years old, it's
the time in which you normally would go to col
lege, so for me it kind of supplanted my college
experience. I knew going into it that it would
very much be a life journey, as much as it would
be just simply making a movie. I knew it would
it stretch the boundaries of what filmmaking and
what a normal filmmaking process would be,

and it really became something very profound in
the sense that I essentially made a family in New
Zealand and an incredible group of friends that
I'll have for the rest of my life. I think there are
certainly a lot of parallels with the experience
that you would have at college, including that of
the difficulty of leaving and leaving the people
that you've spent so much time with behind. I
mean, it's been a four-year process; even though
the principal photography [lasted] a year and a
half, I've been back every year since. And it's
been a massive learning experience for me.
INT: On all the posters and advertisements for
this film, Frodo looks like he's gonna die, like
he's fallen apart physically. How hard was that
emotionally and mentally, to portray the
changes that the character goes through in this
last film?
WOOD: I think the real challenge of the role
was to take a character from such a innocent, rel
atively positive state to that of a character com
pletely depleted physically and emotionally. But
it was also what I loved the most about the jour
ney. I mean, I think the third film and where
Frodo goes in it is the most fun for me, the most
exciting material to work with. So, it was actual
ly really good fun. I really enjoyed the process of
figuring out how the ring was deteriorating you
over time, and to really visualize and to articu
late that depletion, it was good fun. I think the
most challenging element of that whole thing
was more that we were shooting so out of se
quence.
INT: Along with shooting scenes out of se
quence, you also had to go back to New Zealand
for reshoots and pickups the following summers.
How hard was it to get back into the swing of
things?
WOOD: I think the first time may have been
slightly difficult just because that was the longest
period of time I had been removed from the
movie, from the principal photography ending
in December of 2000 to going back in June of
2001.1 hadn't really planned on going back to do
pickups or to become that character again. I re
member Peter [Jackson] showed us some
footage and sat us down to get us familiar with
the character again. But, once we started filming
again it was essentially as if we'd never left be
fore. And consequently, every time I've been
back it's actually been second nature to get back
into the character, because I've played Frodo for
so long.
INT: I was one of those people who had only

read "The Hobbit," and never finished the
"LOTR" trilogy. I actually think it was a good
way to go into the movie in a lot of ways, because
I was familiar with Tolkien's Middle Earth, but
not knowing the actual plot, it was a lot easier to
get wrapped up in the films and enjoy them.
WOOD: Yes, definitely.
INT: What do you say to the people who can't
get over the differences between the books and
the films? Do you think its good to hold the films
up against the book continuously?
WOOD: Well, I think it's something that really
can't be denied. The books have been around
since the 50s and have been read and reread by
millions of people. I kind of love the fact that
people are as critical as they are, because it
means they're passionate about it, either way.
And I think that for the most part, we've pleased
the fans and they seem very happy with the in
terpretation of the books, which is an incredibly
difficult thing to do across the board. I think it's
only natural that people have little gripes here
and there about the small details and changes
we've made along the way, and the things that
aren't there that they miss from the books; there
are some people who are more forgiving than
others and some people who are less forgiving,
but it's natural and expected when it comes to a
novel like that.
INT: You've been working on these films for
four years and become so tied to the character of
Frodo. You've done other films since then, so I
wonder, how hard was it to move on profession
ally, and are you nervous about the whole Mark
Hamill [who played Luke Skywalker in the orig
inal "Star Wars" trilogy] syndrome?
WOOD: I'm not too worried about that, I've
been lucky enough to have a career thus far and
to be somewhat known before "Lord of the
Rings," which wasn't really the case so much
with Mark Hamill. I don't think that's going to
happen as long as I continue to work and portray
roles that are different and in movies that people
go see. But in terms of jumping into something
else after "LOTR," it was in some ways a relief
because I was suddenly a part of something that
didn't include green screen and prosthetic
makeup; it was back to basics, which was really
quite refreshing actually. I think after LOTR
you can do anything, in a way; it's all of the ex
tremes and prepares you for anything.
