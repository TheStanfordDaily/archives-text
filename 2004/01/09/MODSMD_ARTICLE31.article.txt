# A 						Hard Hobbit to Break: 'Return of the King'
## 
### ANTHONY HA 
A brief message for the few readers who still have not
seen "The Return of the King":
Huh? What are you waiting for?
Possible explanations:
"It's three and a half hours long!" Now that's just
ridiculous. "The Return of the King" is only half an hour
longer than the first two films in the trilogy. Like "The Fellow
ship of the Ring" — and, to a lesser extent, "The Two Towers"
— this is a movie that's constantly propelling itself forward,

juggling two, three or more story
lines. If anything, "Return" is too
short.

"I haven't seen the first two
movies." Well, go see them now,
silly. "Return" is probably gonna be
in theaters for a while, but don't wait
too long — you want to see it on the
big screen.

"I saw the first two movies and I didn't like them."
Oh. Well. Fair enough. I guess Tolkien isn't for anyone. But if
it's only because you giggle at the sound of names like Aragorn
and Legolas, maybe you should pull the stick out of your ass
then try watching them again.
Go watch the damn movie(s)!
Moments when I cried. For real!
Frodo (Elijah Wood) abandons his loyal friend Sam
(Sean Astin) on the steps of Cirith Ungol. This is probably the
most heartwrenching moment of the film, with best friends
turned against each other, the hero of the first two films trans
formed into a sickly, paranoid shadow of his former self, and
Sam left on his knees, sobbing. Wood, Astin and Andy Serkis
as Gollum are, needless to say, wonderful.
King Theoden (Bernard Hill) rides ahead of his
troops, tapping their spears, before charging into the Battle of
the Pelennor Fields. Even if it's kinda sappy, doomed nobility

always gets to me. "Return" is packed with this brand of old
school, "we lucky few, we band of brothers" heroism. Viewers
have spent so much time with these characters, and they real
ize how high the stakes are, so these moments generally work
perfectly.
The Grey Havens. If you've seen read the books or
seen the movies, you know what I'm talking about. Sure, "The
Lord of the Rings" is a swashbuckling adventure, but it's also
the story of the fall from the Third to the Fourth Age of Mid
dle Earth, from a time of magic and elves to the age of men.
This melancholy longing for the past is easy to ridicule, but it's
my favorite part of the books and the films, and those threads

come together beautifully
in this scene.
OK, will George
Lucas please just go away
now?
People have writ
ten that "Star Wars" is the
mvtholoev of our times —

which, first of all, no — but "The Lord of the Rings" films have,
on top of everything else, revealed the terrible emptiness and
claustrophobic smallness of Lucas's universe. Granted, "Star
Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back" are fun movies, but is
there anything they achieve that "The Lord of the Rings"
doesn't do better? Peter Jackson has created a heroic epic that
is at once more awe-inspiringly huge in scale and more mov
ingly personal than anything that George Lucas could ever
dream up, and Jackson's grand finale is spectacular and mov
ing, rather than a repeat of the first film with some unconvinc
ing melodrama thrown in. After seeing how good this sort of
film can be, will people still settle for "Star Wars"?
Well, "Episode I" made bucketloads of money, so ...
maybe.
So what's with giving the movie only four stars?
For all its considerable power, "The Return of the
King" is still very much "Tolkien Goes To War," drowning out
some of his subtlety, subtext and character development with
its martial drumbeat. I can't help but wish that Jackson had
spent a little less time dithering about with his computerized

soldiers and more with Frodo and Sam's journey, which is the
heart of the book and the film.
On a more petty note, I was a bit miffed that Faramir
(David Wenham) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto), my favorite
characters from the books, got such short shrift.
Anyway, as with the novel, "The Return of the King"
isn't really a film that stands on its own, but rather the climac
tic three-and-a-half hours of "The Lord of the Rings," bringing
all the seeds planted in the first two films to fruition. Now we
can appreciate the entirety of Jackson's achievement, which is
to create / adapt an epic that is truly greater than the sum of its
part, an adventure that will not soon be forgotten.

dream up, and Jackson's grand finale is spectacular and mov
ing, rather than a repeat of the first film with some unconvinc
ing melodrama thrown in. After seeing how good this sort of
film can be, will people still settle for "Star Wars"?
Well, "Episode I" made bucketloads of money, so ...
maybe.
So what's with giving the movie only four stars?
For all its considerable power, "The Return of the
King" is still very much "Tolkien Goes To War," drowning out
some of his subtlety, subtext and character development with
its martial drumbeat. I can't help but wish that Jackson had
spent a little less time dithering about with his computerized

soldiers and more with Frodo and Sam's journey, which is the
heart of the book and the film.
On a more petty note, I was a bit miffed that Faramir
(David Wenham) and Eowyn (Miranda Otto), my favorite
characters from the books, got such short shrift.
Anyway, as with the novel, "The Return of the King"
isn't really a film that stands on its own, but rather the climac
tic three-and-a-half hours of "The Lord of the Rings," bringing
all the seeds planted in the first two films to fruition. Now we
can appreciate the entirety of Jackson's achievement, which is
to create / adapt an epic that is truly greater than the sum of its
part, an adventure that will not soon be forgotten.

" 'TheReturn of the King'
brings all the see
the first two films to fruition."

A brief message for the few readers who still have not
seen "The Return of the King":
Huh? What are you waiting for?
Possible explanations:
"It's three and a half hours long!" Now that's just
ridiculous. "The Return of the King" is only half an hour
longer than the first two films in the trilogy. Like "The Fellow
ship of the Ring" — and, to a lesser extent, "The Two Towers"
— this is a movie that's constantly propelling itself forward,

juggling two, three or more story
lines. If anything, "Return" is too
short.

"I haven't seen the first two
movies." Well, go see them now,
silly. "Return" is probably gonna be
in theaters for a while, but don't wait
too long — you want to see it on the
big screen.

"I saw the first two movies and I didn't like them."
Oh. Well. Fair enough. I guess Tolkien isn't for anyone. But if
it's only because you giggle at the sound of names like Aragorn
and Legolas, maybe you should pull the stick out of your ass
then try watching them again.
Go watch the damn movie(s)!
Moments when I cried. For real!
Frodo (Elijah Wood) abandons his loyal friend Sam
(Sean Astin) on the steps of Cirith Ungol. This is probably the
most heartwrenching moment of the film, with best friends
turned against each other, the hero of the first two films trans
formed into a sickly, paranoid shadow of his former self, and
Sam left on his knees, sobbing. Wood, Astin and Andy Serkis
as Gollum are, needless to say, wonderful.
King Theoden (Bernard Hill) rides ahead of his
troops, tapping their spears, before charging into the Battle of
the Pelennor Fields. Even if it's kinda sappy, doomed nobility

always gets to me. "Return" is packed with this brand of old
school, "we lucky few, we band of brothers" heroism. Viewers
have spent so much time with these characters, and they real
ize how high the stakes are, so these moments generally work
perfectly.
The Grey Havens. If you've seen read the books or
seen the movies, you know what I'm talking about. Sure, "The
Lord of the Rings" is a swashbuckling adventure, but it's also
the story of the fall from the Third to the Fourth Age of Mid
dle Earth, from a time of magic and elves to the age of men.
This melancholy longing for the past is easy to ridicule, but it's
my favorite part of the books and the films, and those threads

come together beautifully
in this scene.
OK, will George
Lucas please just go away
now?
People have writ
ten that "Star Wars" is the
mvtholoev of our times —

which, first of all, no — but "The Lord of the Rings" films have,
on top of everything else, revealed the terrible emptiness and
claustrophobic smallness of Lucas's universe. Granted, "Star
Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back" are fun movies, but is
there anything they achieve that "The Lord of the Rings"
doesn't do better? Peter Jackson has created a heroic epic that
is at once more awe-inspiringly huge in scale and more mov
ingly personal than anything that George Lucas could ever
dream up, and Jackson's grand finale is spectacular and mov
ing, rather than a repeat of the first film with some unconvinc
ing melodrama thrown in. After seeing how good this sort of
