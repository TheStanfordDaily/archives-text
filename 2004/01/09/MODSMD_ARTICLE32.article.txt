# Class of 2003: Top of the Headline Heap
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
There were the great (Jack Black), the near
great (Hugh Jackman), and the decidedly less than
great (Michael Jackson), but when the dust cleared
and 2003 had ended, only a few performers truly
emerged victorious. Here's a look at those who
made 2003 worth a second look.
Will Ferrell: When 2003 began, Ferrell was
punching the clock as a player on "Saturday Night
Live." But then came "Old School" and by the end
of the year, he was headlining a major hit ("Elf'),
raking in the cash ("Elf' grossed more than $171
million), tickling critics' funny bones and prancing
in tights.
Scarlett Johansson: How does one go from
quiet roles in films like "The Horse Whisperer" to
earning two golden globe nominations for best ac
tress ("Girl with a Pearl Earring" and "Lost in
Translation")? Johansson took 2003 to flex her se
rious acting muscles, and it undoubtedly paid off.
Clay Aiken: When Ruben Studdard took home
the "American Idol" title, America gasped. Then
they all went out and bought Clay's album.
Aiken's "Measure of a Man" went on to sell over
two million copies.

Jessica Simpson: For someone whose two
greatest accomplishments are getting married and
eating tuna fish, the girl's somehow risen to the top.
The success of MTV's "Newlyweds," the reality
diary show following Simpson and husband Nick

Roberto Cavalli: Who else but designer Cavalli
would dream up super-short skirts paired with
pointy-toed shoes? Okay, well most men probably,
but who else could get everyone from Jewel to Be
yonce to actually wear them? Cavalli's designs res

onated with women so much that it made them
wanted to get rid of their pinky toes and slip on a
pair of stilettos.
Arnold Schwarzenegger: Well, he said he'd be
back, didn't he? With the resurrection of the "Ter
minator" series ("T3: Rise of the Machines") cash
ing in at the summer box office, how was
Schwarzenegger to follow up? He made his agen
da political. Before you knew it, Schwarzenegger
was on the campaign trail for California governor,
Gray Davis was shaking in his boots and the media
was having a field day with a host of bad Ah-nold
jokes.
Pirates: Before Johnny Depp, before Orlando
Bloom, there were the sailors of the seven seas.
The fact that they made it to the big screen, por
trayed by two of Hollywood's sexiest men, brought
pirates back in a huge way.
OutKast: I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, I am for real,
OutKast is hott. Hot with two ts. Hot with two hit
singles in the Billboard top five ("Hey ya!" at num
ber one and "The Way you Move" at number two).
Hot with one of the top albums of the year
("Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"). It makes you
want to shake it like a Polaroid picture.


Lachey, has brought Simpson new fans and new
fame. I hear she's trying to get a singing career too.
