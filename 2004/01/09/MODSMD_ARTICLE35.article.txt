# No Doubt rocks the 'Singles' scene
## 
### MIKE ORME 
So it's come to this. After 16 years, four major-label releases and a reserved
seat in MTV's heavy rotation, No Doubt has now released a singles collection.
This comes as tricky territory for No Doubt. This year has seen a rash of best
of releases from '90s acts. However, the lukewarm reception to comps such as
Nirvana and Bjork's "Family Tree" drive home the point that neither new ma
terial (like the former) nor slick packaging (like the latter) can reproduce the

magic that made these acts worthy of a Greatest Hits in the first place.
However, No Doubt is a different animal. Unlike the comparatively album
based rock of Nirvana and Bjork, No Doubt's energetic mixture of new-wave
Madness and funky Fishbone succeeded on the strength of multiple singles re
leased one after another, as "Tragic Kingdom" virtually owned MTV's Buzz
Bin in 1995.
Thus, it should be fitting that a band which rode so strongly on its singles
should have a strong singles collection, right? Indeed, "Singles 1992-2003"
gives a good glimpse at the popular milestones of No Doubt's 11-year record
ing career... although that's not necessarily a good thing.
At times, the collection reminds us of the sheer abandon and flexibility of No
Doubt's music. "Hella Good," co-written by the Neptunes, offers a dirty club
beat and a daring departure from the ska/new-wave sound of "Tragic King
dom." In "Just a Girl," Gwen Stefani's vibrato rips through the track like a
Shockwave and kicks off the disc with the energy No Doubt used to propel their
unique career. "Spiderwebs" sounds as fresh as it did in '96, seamlessly inte
grating No Doubt's influences into a catchy track which transcends late '90s re
vival ska.
The disc also includes one new song, a cover of new-wave group Talk-Talk's
"It's My Life." No Doubt's distorted take remains true to the angst-ridden spir
it of the original, while adding their own distinct flavor to the mix.
However, with a compilation like "Singles" come missteps as well as tri
umphs. For all their seamless shape-shifting, No Doubt too often offers forget
table pop-punk on "Singles," and some songs are addled by formulaic song
writing and forgettable melodies. Tracks like "New" and "Bathwater" (both
from "Return of Saturn") were dead on arrival when released, and serve as
filler here.
Additionally, the band's experiments with dance-hall reggae on tracks like
"Underneath it All" fall flat in the context of their earlier work. "Hey Baby"
appears third on the album, after "Just a Girl" and "It's My Life," and after
these upbeat, new-wave influenced tracks, put the album in an undeservedly
downbeat mood.
"Singles" provides a number of enjoyable tracks from No Doubt's varied
catalogue. However, for all their strengths, some of their tracks are merely pass
able, and others which need, simply, to be skipped. If you're a die-hard No
Doubt fan, you might rather pick up the "Boom Box" boxed set, which includes
b-sides and extensive live cuts on DVD. Otherwise, you might benefit from
picking this album up, but chances are you're better off taking a trip to iTunes
and dropping four or five bucks on a few choice tracks rather than spending fif
teen dollars on "Singles." And hey, why not — after all, No Doubt is in essence
a singles band, right?
