# Stone Temple Pilots: Their Hits are Heavier than a 747
## 
### LY CHHENG 
The Beatles probably stared it with their "l's"
album. Then, Elvis decided to stick his lip in the mix.
Amidst a legal Armageddon Michael Jackson
squeezed out his own "l's" album; and just recently
The Red Hot Chili Peppers took their socks off to
reveal their hits package. The trend with record la
bels seems to be if an artist is deceased or running

out of quality material, then the best thing
to do is make a mix CD and sell it for
$14.99... the public will eat it up-and eat
it up we do! Out of the smoke and ashes
comes the California grunge / rock /
feather boa outfit the Stone Temple Pilots
with their reflective singles compilation —
adequately titled "Thank You" — which

delivers magnificently as a final curtain call for the
band.
Appearing out of the wake of a musical explo
sion and attempting to plant their own stake in the
ruins seems to be the recurring theme with the Pi
lots. In the early '90s, STP arrived like a slight or
gasm in the refractory period of grunge's big bang.
(Nirvana, Pearl Jam) Despite initially being written
off as Pearl Jam clones, their debut "Core" went on
to be certified 8X platinum and the singles "Sex
Type Thing," "Wicked Garden" and "Plush" all be
came Alt-rock radio station staples.
In fact, the Pilots have managed to keep putting
song after song on the radio in rapid-fire fashion for

over a decade. If a band's strength is proportional to
the strength of its singles then these guys are heavy
weights. You probably don't comprehend how
many friggin' classic songs these guys have pro
duced-luckily "Thank You" is like a shot of adren
aline to your hippocampus to remind you. It opens
with the modern rock sing-a-long "Vasoline,"
which revs up its engine and drives right into your
eardrum. Just as you are recovering, however, they

stomp on your head with the metallic-riff jugger
naut "Down."
Do these guys ever let up? No! As you lick your
wounds they bitch slap you with the grunge romp
"Wicked Garden" — a song that can't help but
make you want to put on some pruning shears and
get down with your bad self. Okay, finally a
breather... "Big Empty" — a track from "The
Crow: The Motion Picture Soundtrack" — is a bal
lad for all to enjoy, especially undead mimes.
"Plush" — the hook-laden opus in which Scott
sings .. ."Weeerrreeeelll, whhheeennnn daaaaaa
dooooogs begin tuh smuhhhhhellllher!!" is on here
too.

Only after listening to this album does one fully
appreciate the ridiculously large range of singer
Scott Weiland and the outstanding adaptability of
the band. Guitarist Dean Deleo and bassist Robert
Deleo can create soft acoustic gems like "Sour Girl"
and "Creep," but still manage to make industrial
moments of hedonistic endeavors like "Sex Type
Thing" and the previously unreleased "All in the
Suit that You Wear." Underneath it all is a pop sen-

sibility for melody and hooks. Weiland
shows off his incredible ability to stick
his voice inside your head and never let
up like on "Days of the Week", which is
probably the poppiest song on here. A
special treat at the end of the album is
the acoustic version of "Plush", which

shows off Weiland's beautiful tone and
subtle vocal nuances. Together these guys can go
from the Beatlesque suppleness of "Lady Picture
Show" to the Doors-like, in your face, breakneck
squawk of "Interstate Love Song" and "Trippin' on
a Hole in a Paper Heart." The hits are all here
friends-the songs you know and love.
So are they thanking us for giving them tons of
money to spend on more guitars and heroin? Or are
they thanking us for loving their classic songs? In a
perfect world it would be the latter. Maybe we
should thank these Temple Pilots for giving us one
last token to worship them by-so to these four over
sexed multi-millionaires I say ... "No — Thank
You!"

The Pilots have managed to keep
putting song after song
rapid-fire fashion for over a decade.
