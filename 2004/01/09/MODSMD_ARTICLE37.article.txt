# Stanford Alum serenades Intermission
## Six questions with Dar Williams 
### NICOLE BECKLEY 
With the release of her sixth album, "The Beauty of
the Rain," and an upcoming one-woman benefit concert, it's
safe to say that Dar Williams has come a long way her early
touring days: 30 dates in 60 days, by way of her Honda. After
leaving Stanford, Williams set out make it as a playwright, but
found a higher calling in music. Now, even at six months preg
nant, Williams is bringing her folk-rock sound back to Palo
Alto to do a show benefiting Barron Park School.
INTERMISSION: How would you describe your music?
Does it fit into a single category?
DAR WILLIAMS: Probably not... I grew up with a the folk
pop of the '60s; singer-songwriter pop music, like Simon and

Garfunkel and the Beatles. We had a lot of classical music, and
then a lot of straightforward folk music. As I got older, there
was a lot of pop music, and then I got into theater in college,
and I really fell in love with experimental pop ... like Kate
Bush.
I love the songwriting of folk music. I love well writ
ten songs that last for a long time, and that can be in any genre.
INT: In your latest album, "The Beauty of the Rain," you work
with some really amazing musicians (including Bela Fleck and
John Popper), how did that come about?
WILLIAMS: It happened when my manager was talking with
his sons ... he loved Neil Young, and he turned his sons on to
that, and then his sons turned him on to a whole bunch of stuff
that they thought was following in the tradition of those musi
cians, bands like Traffic and The Band, which are like the jam
bands now, like String Cheese Incident and Phish ... so there

was this cross-pollination where he found out through his sons
that basically the people in the jam bands have the same
philosophies (...) that I did. And he's like, 'so basically, my
bet is, if you guys got into a studio together, your music would
work because politically you work. Your minds and your pol
itics have so much in common even though you're sort of seen
as a girl with a guitar folk artist, and they're these total jam
band guys.' I think it totally worked out. And I think that that
has to do with the fact that when musicians get together, they
just get along. I mean, it's like, when you go in the studio, you
try and hang your ego on the door, so that you can work ... so
I invited them and they came.
INT: What's your personal approach to song-writing?
WILLIAMS: It's something that just kind of flies into one's
head. And if you're lucky, it all comes at once. Usually what
will happen is a central phrase will appear in my head. One day
I was walking along and I couldn't get this musical phrase out
of my head with the words attached that said, 'go to the woods,
go to the woods, go to the woods,' and I thought, 'Well, what is
this song? What is the song 'go to the woods' going to be
about?'That excites my imagination because I do believe that
unconsciously songs want to be written, and they give you
these little flags. And you have to kind of follow the flag until
you go, 'A hope, that's what I wanted to write about.'... Gen
erally something will just land in my head and it's actually
something that your normal real life tells you to bat aside, like
when you can't get an annoying song out of your head. Where
as with this, you should actually afford yourself the time and
opportunity to go with it, because I think the first impulse gives
you the most information. And then it's kind of a knitting pro
ject that you pick up and put down when you feel so inspired.
I try not to work when I don't feel inspired, because I've tried
that and I just write pages of crap.
INT: What musicians inspire you currently?
WILLIAMS: I just came off a tour with Patty Griffin, and
Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter, and I really loved
their music, I just love listening to it every night, that's what I
listen to ... I listen to the news. My husband and I are like lit
tle sociologists. We listen to Democracy and Pacifica, Coun
terspin, and then we watch a little CNN ... you know, musi
cians are also storytellers, so sometimes I'm in a music place,
and sometimes I'm in a storytelling place. The news is kind of
like how we tell stories, and that's what I'm interested in these
days.
INT: When did you know this was what you wanted to do?
WILLIAMS: It took a while. I was in Boston and I wanted to
be a playwright... but there wasn't a kind of growing edge in
theater. In the meantime, there was a music revival of open
mics... in the early '90s there was this really fertile time,
where any day of the week you could spend two dollars and
play two songs, and that became my field work, and theater
kind of went to the wayside.
INT: Was your family supportive?
WILLIAMS: Completely ... my family was like, 'you know
we don't want you to be aimless,' and I didn't want to be aim
less. It's a waste of time. I saw a lot of friends of mine making
CDs that were terrible, and I was too much of an environmen
talist to want that to happen. What a waste of plastic ... I think
we [my family] all had our doubts at the same time, but it just
so happened that that was the same time that I was recording
my first CD ... and then the ride of my life began, and nobody
questioned it.

when you can't get an annoying song out of your head. Where
as with this, you should actually afford yourself the time and
opportunity to go with it, because I think the first impulse gives
you the most information. And then it's kind of a knitting pro
ject that you pick up and put down when you feel so inspired.
I try not to work when I don't feel inspired, because I've tried
that and I just write pages of crap.
INT: What musicians inspire you currently?
WILLIAMS: I just came off a tour with Patty Griffin, and
Shawn Colvin and Mary Chapin Carpenter, and I really loved
their music, I just love listening to it every night, that's what I
listen to ... I listen to the news. My husband and I are like lit
tle sociologists. We listen to Democracy and Pacifica, Coun
terspin, and then we watch a little CNN ... you know, musi
cians are also storytellers, so sometimes I'm in a music place,
and sometimes I'm in a storytelling place. The news is kind of
like how we tell stories, and that's what I'm interested in these
days.
INT: When did you know this was what you wanted to do?
WILLIAMS: It took a while. I was in Boston and I wanted to
be a playwright... but there wasn't a kind of growing edge in
theater. In the meantime, there was a music revival of open
mics... in the early '90s there was this really fertile time,
where any day of the week you could spend two dollars and
play two songs, and that became my field work, and theater
kind of went to the wayside.
INT: Was your family supportive?
WILLIAMS: Completely ... my family was like, 'you know
we don't want you to be aimless,' and I didn't want to be aim
less. It's a waste of time. I saw a lot of friends of mine making
CDs that were terrible, and I was too much of an environmen
talist to want that to happen. What a waste of plastic ... I think
we [my family] all had our doubts at the same time, but it just
so happened that that was the same time that I was recording
my first CD ... and then the ride of my life began, and nobody
questioned it.
Dar Williams will be performing at Palo Alto High School on
Jan. 17 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are on sale by e-mail at dartick
ets@sbcglobal.net for $25, $35 and $75.
With the release of her sixth album, "The Beauty of
the Rain," and an upcoming one-woman benefit concert, it's
safe to say that Dar Williams has come a long way her early
touring days: 30 dates in 60 days, by way of her Honda. After
leaving Stanford, Williams set out make it as a playwright, but
found a higher calling in music. Now, even at six months preg
nant, Williams is bringing her folk-rock sound back to Palo
Alto to do a show benefiting Barron Park School.
INTERMISSION: How would you describe your music?
Does it fit into a single category?
DAR WILLIAMS: Probably not... I grew up with a the folk
pop of the '60s; singer-songwriter pop music, like Simon and

Garfunkel and the Beatles. We had a lot of classical music, and
then a lot of straightforward folk music. As I got older, there
was a lot of pop music, and then I got into theater in college,
and I really fell in love with experimental pop ... like Kate
Bush.
I love the songwriting of folk music. I love well writ
ten songs that last for a long time, and that can be in any genre.
INT: In your latest album, "The Beauty of the Rain," you work
with some really amazing musicians (including Bela Fleck and
John Popper), how did that come about?
WILLIAMS: It happened when my manager was talking with
his sons ... he loved Neil Young, and he turned his sons on to
that, and then his sons turned him on to a whole bunch of stuff
that they thought was following in the tradition of those musi
cians, bands like Traffic and The Band, which are like the jam
bands now, like String Cheese Incident and Phish ... so there

was this cross-pollination where he found out through his sons
that basically the people in the jam bands have the same
philosophies (...) that I did. And he's like, 'so basically, my
bet is, if you guys got into a studio together, your music would
work because politically you work. Your minds and your pol
itics have so much in common even though you're sort of seen
as a girl with a guitar folk artist, and they're these total jam
band guys.' I think it totally worked out. And I think that that
has to do with the fact that when musicians get together, they
just get along. I mean, it's like, when you go in the studio, you
try and hang your ego on the door, so that you can work ... so
I invited them and they came.
INT: What's your personal approach to song-writing?
WILLIAMS: It's something that just kind of flies into one's
head. And if you're lucky, it all comes at once. Usually what
will happen is a central phrase will appear in my head. One day
I was walking along and I couldn't get this musical phrase out
of my head with the words attached that said, 'go to the woods,
go to the woods, go to the woods,' and I thought, 'Well, what is
this song? What is the song 'go to the woods' going to be
about?'That excites my imagination because I do believe that
unconsciously songs want to be written, and they give you
these little flags. And you have to kind of follow the flag until
you go, 'A hope, that's what I wanted to write about.'... Gen
erally something will just land in my head and it's actually
something that your normal real life tells you to bat aside, like
when you can't get an annoying song out of your head. Where
