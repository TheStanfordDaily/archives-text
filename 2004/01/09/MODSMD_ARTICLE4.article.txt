# Biomedical research to receive less funding
## 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
The National Institutes of Health will
level its budget this year, ending a five
year increase in funding for biomedical
research, a change that could negatively
impact young, individual researchers.
The change in funding is expected to
affect the biomedical research at Stan
ford in two primary ways.
First, there will be less money to fund
young scientists trying to break into the
field because NIH already has many
commitments to fulfill.

"I do worry about the availability of
funding to support new grants for junior
faculty who have not yet developed a
proven track record of success in re
search," said Dr. Philip Pizzo, dean of the
School of Medicine. "We are lucky to be
able to recruit outstanding young inves
tigators and I am confident that they will
be highly competitive — but it will be
more challenging for them."
Furthermore, NIH is changing its di
rection to focus more on interdiscipli
nary team research. Thus, funding will
tend to go toward teams rather than in
dividuals.
"We don't know how we'll fare
under those circumstances," said Arthur
Bienenstock, vice provost and dean of
research and graduate policy. "I would
say we're entering a period of uncertain
ty."

Though the University anticipates
short-term adjustment difficulties, ad
ministrators are confident that Stanford
faculty members should be able to over
come these obstacles.
"I do not believe it will have an ad
verse impact on our research efforts at
Stanford," Pizzo said. "We have an out
standingly talented faculty at Stanford
who will continue to be successful in re
ceiving NIH funding even during more

fiscally challenging times."
"If the ideas are exciting enough,
even new projects should be successful,"
said Russ Altman, professor of Genetics
and Medicine.
NIH funding, which has nearly dou
bled in recent years, only supports bio
medical research, Bienenstock said. Re
search in other departments such as en
gineering or the social sciences will not
be affected.
Funding from other federal agencies,
including the Department of Energy,
Department of Defense, National Sci
ence Foundation and NASA, has only
risen in recent years in response to infla
tion.
Yet the research at Stanford support
ed by these agencies has nonetheless
done well, said Bienenstock.
"The fact that the NIH budget has
doubled in the past five years is an extra
ordinary affirmation by the American
public and our government of the im
portance of biomedical research," Pizzo
said.
Some researchers believe that the
leveling in funding will actually have a
positive impact on the quality of research
at Stanford.
"It will probably increase quality
since there is increased scrutiny," Alt
man said.
However, he also noted that research
might suffer if investigators spend more
time competing for funding and less time
performing research, or if promising
new ideas cannot get funded.
There may also be a shift toward al
ternative sources of funding, such as in
dividual donors or industry supporters.
"Stanford probably generates more
good ideas than NIH can fund, and so it
becomes necessary to creatively find al
ternative sources of funding," Altman
said.
The leveling in NIH funding is ex

pected to affect graduate students and
post-doctoral students rather than un
dergraduates.
"I think that a decrease in the re
search funding levels will also lead to a
decrease in the number of grants held by
the average scientist," said Daniel Madi
son, professor of Molecular and Cellular
Physiology. "This will, in turn lead to a

decrease in the number of research posi
tions in laboratories for both pre- and
post-doctoral scientists."
However, the end of the increase in
funding will also keep researchers on
their toes.
"A healthy amount of competition
for funding is good," added Madison,
"because it keeps all of us sharp."
