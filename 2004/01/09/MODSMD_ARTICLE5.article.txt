# Filesharing down on campuses, up at Stanford
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
The number of college students esti
mated to be sharing files over the Inter
net has decreased by more than half
since last spring, but the number of
complaints of students illegally down
loading music at Stanford has actually
increased this year.
Although the decrease of file shar
ing shown in a report released Sunday
by the Pew Internet and American Life
Project correlates with the first wave of
lawsuits filed by members of the
Recording Industry Association of
America against individuals illegally
downloading music, the cause of the de
cline is uncertain.
The Pew Internet and American
Life Project, which analyzes the role of
the Internet in American society and

culture, conducted a survey on file shar
ing last spring and again in November
and December, after the RIAA's Sep
tember announcement that it would file
the lawsuits.
Twenty nine percent of Internet
users were estimated to be download
ing music files after the Pew project re
leased its spring survey results. Tliat fig
ure dropped to 14 percent in the fall sur
vey. Among college students, 56 per
cent were estimated to be downloading
music after the spring survey, but the es
timate dropped to 24 percent in the fall.
"This is another encouraging in
dication that we are on the right
track," said RIAA Chairman and
CEO Mitch Bainwol about the Pew
study. "We must continue on this
course. It is essential to fostering an
environment where legal online
music services can flourish."

As part of their efforts to curb the il
legal distribution of entertainment on
file sharing networks such as Kazaa, the
recording industry and motion picture
industry have been working closely
with universities and have formed the
Joint Committee of the Higher Educa
tion and Entertainment Communities.
According to the RIAA, the committee
was formed to offer information to uni
versity officials about the problem that
illegal downloading poses and to help
them adapt their computer usage poli
cies so they address the issue.
Illegal downloading "is not exclu
sive to campuses, but one reason cam
puses are focused on is that they have
some of the biggest bandwidth and state
of the art computer systems, so just the
availability of the tools makes it possible
there," said MPAA representative
Rich Taylor. "But in terms of how many

students are involved, it's difficult to es
timate. Our goal is to provide them with
a legitimate alternative."
Stanford computer usage policies
clearly state that the university will not
facilitate the pirating of intellectual
property through its computer net
works.
It is unclear whether or not the de
crease in music downloading found
among college students by the Pew pro
ject applies to Stanford students.
"We don't have any way to track
that, but what comes to our office are
complaints from the recording indus
try," said David Hoffman, Stanford
manager of information security ser
vices. "Judging by the number of com
plaints that have come in, those are up
from last year. It could just be that the
