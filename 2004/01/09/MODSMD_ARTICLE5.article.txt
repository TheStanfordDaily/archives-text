# Filesharing down on campuses, up at Stanford
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
The number of college students esti
mated to be sharing files over the Inter
net has decreased by more than half
since last spring, but the number of
complaints of students illegally down
loading music at Stanford has actually
increased this year.
Although the decrease of file shar
ing shown in a report released Sunday
by the Pew Internet and American Life
Project correlates with the first wave of
lawsuits filed by members of the
Recording Industry Association of
America against individuals illegally
downloading music, the cause of the de
cline is uncertain.
The Pew Internet and American
Life Project, which analyzes the role of
the Internet in American society and

culture, conducted a survey on file shar
ing last spring and again in November
and December, after the RIAA's Sep
tember announcement that it would file
the lawsuits.
Twenty nine percent of Internet
users were estimated to be download
ing music files after the Pew project re
leased its spring survey results. Tliat fig
ure dropped to 14 percent in the fall sur
vey. Among college students, 56 per
cent were estimated to be downloading
music after the spring survey, but the es
timate dropped to 24 percent in the fall.
"This is another encouraging in
dication that we are on the right
track," said RIAA Chairman and
CEO Mitch Bainwol about the Pew
study. "We must continue on this
course. It is essential to fostering an
environment where legal online
music services can flourish."

As part of their efforts to curb the il
legal distribution of entertainment on
file sharing networks such as Kazaa, the
recording industry and motion picture
industry have been working closely
with universities and have formed the
Joint Committee of the Higher Educa
tion and Entertainment Communities.
According to the RIAA, the committee
was formed to offer information to uni
versity officials about the problem that
illegal downloading poses and to help
them adapt their computer usage poli
cies so they address the issue.
Illegal downloading "is not exclu
sive to campuses, but one reason cam
puses are focused on is that they have
some of the biggest bandwidth and state
of the art computer systems, so just the
availability of the tools makes it possible
there," said MPAA representative
Rich Taylor. "But in terms of how many

students are involved, it's difficult to es
timate. Our goal is to provide them with
a legitimate alternative."
Stanford computer usage policies
clearly state that the university will not
facilitate the pirating of intellectual
property through its computer net
works.
It is unclear whether or not the de
crease in music downloading found
among college students by the Pew pro
ject applies to Stanford students.
"We don't have any way to track
that, but what comes to our office are
complaints from the recording indus
try," said David Hoffman, Stanford
manager of information security ser
vices. "Judging by the number of com
plaints that have come in, those are up
from last year. It could just be that the

filesharing on Stanford campus have increased.
recording industry is being more aggres
sive about the complaints."
Hoffman explained that the best
way to track illegal downloading is from
year to year because of the peaks in
downloading during certain seasons.
Rich Holeton, Stanford's head of
Residential Computing, said that asso
ciating the results of the Pew report with
the RIAA's lawsuits is an oversimplifi

cation of the matter and cited the
recording industry's initial reports of a
decline in downloading which failed to
consider the decline in downloading
that naturally occurs over the summer.
"I don't doubt that industry scare
tactics, mainly the threat and reality of
lawsuits against individuals, have influ
enced many to modify their download
ing behavior, but even if the Pew results
are from fall quarter, other factors may
be contributing too, such as the im
provement in the legal online services,"
Holeton said. "Improving those legal
services has long been a goal of enter

tainment industry critics and improving
them further might very well have a
much greater effect than continued dra
conian enforcement efforts, in my opin
ion."
Taylor gave a similar critique of the
Pew survey results.
"We're observing it and there's cer
tainly figures that suggest it's having an
impact, but there are a number of fac
tors involved, like our public education
campaign," he said. "I think people
have to be careful not to contribute it to
one factor. Even though the numbers
have gone down, there's still a large

number of illegal downloaders."
Senior Robert Morales is one stu
dent, at least, who thinks the lawsuits
could have caused the decrease in
downloading.
"I think the industry made a smart
move by targeting individuals," he said.
"I used to download music quite a bit
here at Stanford, but now I've stopped,
not so much out of fear, but to avoid any
inconvenience. I don't think it's worth
the risk any longer."

industry have been working closely
with universities and have formed the
Joint Committee of the Higher Educa
tion and Entertainment Communities.
According to the RIAA, the committee
was formed to offer information to uni
versity officials about the problem that
illegal downloading poses and to help
them adapt their computer usage poli
cies so they address the issue.
Illegal downloading "is not exclu
sive to campuses, but one reason cam
puses are focused on is that they have
some of the biggest bandwidth and state
of the art computer systems, so just the
availability of the tools makes it possible
there," said MPAA representative
Rich Taylor. "But in terms of how many

students are involved, it's difficult to es
timate. Our goal is to provide them with
a legitimate alternative."
Stanford computer usage policies
clearly state that the university will not
facilitate the pirating of intellectual
property through its computer net
works.
It is unclear whether or not the de
crease in music downloading found
among college students by the Pew pro
ject applies to Stanford students.
"We don't have any way to track
that, but what comes to our office are
complaints from the recording indus
try," said David Hoffman, Stanford
manager of information security ser
vices. "Judging by the number of com
plaints that have come in, those are up
from last year. It could just be that the

filesharing on Stanford campus have increased.
recording industry is being more aggres
sive about the complaints."
Hoffman explained that the best
way to track illegal downloading is from
year to year because of the peaks in
downloading during certain seasons.
Rich Holeton, Stanford's head of
Residential Computing, said that asso
ciating the results of the Pew report with
the RIAA's lawsuits is an oversimplifi

cation of the matter and cited the
recording industry's initial reports of a
decline in downloading which failed to
consider the decline in downloading
that naturally occurs over the summer.
"I don't doubt that industry scare
tactics, mainly the threat and reality of
lawsuits against individuals, have influ
enced many to modify their download
ing behavior, but even if the Pew results
are from fall quarter, other factors may
be contributing too, such as the im
provement in the legal online services,"
Holeton said. "Improving those legal
services has long been a goal of enter

tainment industry critics and improving
them further might very well have a
much greater effect than continued dra
conian enforcement efforts, in my opin
ion."
Taylor gave a similar critique of the
Pew survey results.
"We're observing it and there's cer
tainly figures that suggest it's having an
impact, but there are a number of fac
tors involved, like our public education
campaign," he said. "I think people
have to be careful not to contribute it to
one factor. Even though the numbers
have gone down, there's still a large

number of illegal downloaders."
Senior Robert Morales is one stu
dent, at least, who thinks the lawsuits
could have caused the decrease in
downloading.
"I think the industry made a smart
move by targeting individuals," he said.
"I used to download music quite a bit
here at Stanford, but now I've stopped,
not so much out of fear, but to avoid any
inconvenience. I don't think it's worth
the risk any longer."

The number of college students esti
mated to be sharing files over the Inter
net has decreased by more than half
since last spring, but the number of
complaints of students illegally down
loading music at Stanford has actually
increased this year.
Although the decrease of file shar
ing shown in a report released Sunday
by the Pew Internet and American Life
Project correlates with the first wave of
lawsuits filed by members of the
Recording Industry Association of
America against individuals illegally
downloading music, the cause of the de
cline is uncertain.
The Pew Internet and American
Life Project, which analyzes the role of
the Internet in American society and

culture, conducted a survey on file shar
ing last spring and again in November
and December, after the RIAA's Sep
tember announcement that it would file
the lawsuits.
Twenty nine percent of Internet
users were estimated to be download
ing music files after the Pew project re
leased its spring survey results. Tliat fig
ure dropped to 14 percent in the fall sur
vey. Among college students, 56 per
cent were estimated to be downloading
music after the spring survey, but the es
timate dropped to 24 percent in the fall.
"This is another encouraging in
dication that we are on the right
track," said RIAA Chairman and
CEO Mitch Bainwol about the Pew
study. "We must continue on this
course. It is essential to fostering an
environment where legal online
music services can flourish."

As part of their efforts to curb the il
legal distribution of entertainment on
file sharing networks such as Kazaa, the
recording industry and motion picture
industry have been working closely
with universities and have formed the
Joint Committee of the Higher Educa
tion and Entertainment Communities.
