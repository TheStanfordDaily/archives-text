## Subway should open on weekends 
### 
Since opening its doors this fall,
Subway has quickly become one
of the campus's most popular
lunch and dinner destinations. At
the noon hour every weekday, crowds of
people line up to order BMTs on wheat
and turkey and cheese on white at the
Tresidder dining room. Stanford Dining
and the employees of the Subway fran
chise in Tresidder have done a great job
attracting and retaining their clients, and
we applaud them for this.
But we think that it is high time to ex
pand the hours at Subway. The crowds
drawn to the Tresidder eatery have
demonstrated that demand for Subway's
delicious sandwiches is high. With few
campus eateries open on Saturdays and
Sundays, we think that Subway ought to
open its doors on the weekends.
On weekdays, Row Houses have lunch
and dinner provided by their chefs, din
ing halls are open, Bytes Cafe, the Thai
Cafe, Cubberly Cafe, the Law and Busi
ness School Cafeterias and many other
campus eateries open their doors to stu
dents, faculty and staff. But on the week
end, only dining halls, the Coffee House
and the Treehouse are the only on-cam
pus options for students with rumbling
tummies. Many are forced to go off-cam
pus for meals, and some make do on

Easy-Mac for a shockingly unhealthy
number of consecutive meals.
If Subway opened its doors on the
weekend, given adequate publicity, it
would almost undoubtedly turn a profit.
Because most of the costs of running a
fast-food restaurant are fixed — fran
chise fees, equipment, rent — the
marginal cost of opening the eatery for
an extra hour is relatively low. Given the
reasonably low wages paid to workers at
Subway, we believe that enough people
would buy sandwiches over the weekend
to support a curtailed weekend schedule.
Demand is likely to be highest for Sub
way between the hours of noon and 6 or
7 p.m. on weekends. Few students wake
up hungry for a big sandwich at 9 a.m.,
and most students have late-night plans
that don't involve hanging out at Tresid
der, but during most of the afternoon, a
large population is left on campus with
few places to eat.
We hope that Stanford Dining will
consider piloting weekend hours, and
hope that if they do open Subway during
the weekends, it will not be at the ex
pense of closing other eateries down. On
the weekends, students are underserved
in terms of campus restaurants, and
opening Subway would be an excellent
fix to this problem.
