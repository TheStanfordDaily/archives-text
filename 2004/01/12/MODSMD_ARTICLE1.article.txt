### MICHAEL MILLER SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Seven Stanford students pleaded
no contest on Friday to a misde
meanor charge of providing alcohol
to minors in a case that sparked a
University investigation into the
Delta Delta Delta sorority. The
sorority chapter has been placed on
temporary suspension, pending the
University's findings.
The charge resulted from a police
investigation that looked into haz
ing, sexual assault and providing al
cohol to minors during a Big Sister/
Little Sister pledge event on May 7,
2003. No other charges were filed.
At the event, four freshman football
players hosted a power hour, where
four sorority pledges drank a shot of
beer every minute for an hour, ac
cording to the police report. The al
cohol was purchased by five sorority
members.
According to the police, the foot
ball players, Julian Jenkins, Marcus
McCutcheon, Terrall "T.J." Rush
ing and Gerald Commissiong,
picked up the four girls that night
and took them to Jenkins' room in
Larkin. There, behind a closed door,
the four girls drank for an hour and
danced for a few minutes before
going to the restroom to throw up.
A week later, police received a
call from one of the girls who alleged
that she was coerced into sexual acts
later that night, while the other three
girls were still in the restroom. A po
lice investigation into the charges

continued, and the Santa Clara
County District Attorney decided to
charge all suspects with providing al
cohol to minors.
"Sometimes there are different
levels of responsibility," said Super
vising Deputy District Attorney Jay
Boyarsky. "Sometimes it's most fair
to pick a charge or a crime that
everyone committed." The football
players served the alcohol and the
sorority members assisted in trans
porting and purchasing the alcohol,
according to the police report.
"This doesn't mean there may
not have been other acts or things
that occurred that night that were
obnoxious or disappointing or
frightening or bad in many ways,"
Boyarsky said. "This is not a ques
tion of do we think it happened, it
has to be: Can we prove it beyond a
reasonable doubt?"
The sorority members charged in
the case were Ambar Carvalho,
Marissa Urbano, Ana Avramovic,
Manja Dobraca and Leticia
Ramirez. Carvalho was identified as
the risk manager for the sorority in
the police report, though there were
no alcohol monitors at the Big Sis
ter/ Little Sister event because big
sisters were supposed to be anony
mous to their little sisters.
Commissiong, Carvalho,
Avramovic and Urbano declined to
comment when reached by phone.
The other students charged could
not be reached.
The University is continuing a
separate investigation into the Tri-
