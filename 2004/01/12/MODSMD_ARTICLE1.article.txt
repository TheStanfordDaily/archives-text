# Seven plead no contest in Tri-Delt incident
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Seven Stanford students pleaded
no contest on Friday to a misde
meanor charge of providing alcohol
to minors in a case that sparked a
University investigation into the
Delta Delta Delta sorority. The
sorority chapter has been placed on
temporary suspension, pending the
University's findings.
The charge resulted from a police
investigation that looked into haz
ing, sexual assault and providing al
cohol to minors during a Big Sister/
Little Sister pledge event on May 7,
2003. No other charges were filed.
At the event, four freshman football
players hosted a power hour, where
four sorority pledges drank a shot of
beer every minute for an hour, ac
cording to the police report. The al
cohol was purchased by five sorority
members.
According to the police, the foot
ball players, Julian Jenkins, Marcus
McCutcheon, Terrall "T.J." Rush
ing and Gerald Commissiong,
picked up the four girls that night
and took them to Jenkins' room in
Larkin. There, behind a closed door,
the four girls drank for an hour and
danced for a few minutes before
going to the restroom to throw up.
A week later, police received a
call from one of the girls who alleged
that she was coerced into sexual acts
later that night, while the other three
girls were still in the restroom. A po
lice investigation into the charges

continued, and the Santa Clara
County District Attorney decided to
charge all suspects with providing al
cohol to minors.
"Sometimes there are different
levels of responsibility," said Super
vising Deputy District Attorney Jay
Boyarsky. "Sometimes it's most fair
to pick a charge or a crime that
everyone committed." The football
players served the alcohol and the
sorority members assisted in trans
porting and purchasing the alcohol,
according to the police report.
"This doesn't mean there may
not have been other acts or things
that occurred that night that were
obnoxious or disappointing or
frightening or bad in many ways,"
Boyarsky said. "This is not a ques
tion of do we think it happened, it
has to be: Can we prove it beyond a
reasonable doubt?"
The sorority members charged in
the case were Ambar Carvalho,
Marissa Urbano, Ana Avramovic,
Manja Dobraca and Leticia
Ramirez. Carvalho was identified as
the risk manager for the sorority in
the police report, though there were
no alcohol monitors at the Big Sis
ter/ Little Sister event because big
sisters were supposed to be anony
mous to their little sisters.
Commissiong, Carvalho,
Avramovic and Urbano declined to
comment when reached by phone.
The other students charged could
not be reached.
The University is continuing a
separate investigation into the Tri-
Delt incident and may come to dif
ferent conclusions. According to a
sorority statement, Tri-Delt will be
reviewed for possible violations of
the alcohol and health and safety
policies of the University and the
executive board policies of Tri-
Delt. The University has assigned
its own investigator to the case,
which will be brought to the Orga
nizational Conduct Board in the
next few weeks.
The current temporary suspen
sion that has been placed on the
sorority prohibits any gatherings in
the house of more than five people
with alcohol present.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director Gary Migdol, the Athletic
Department has imposed no penal
ties against the football players.
The no contest pleas, which
came after a few hours of discussion
among the many lawyers in the
case, are equivalent to guilty pleas
according to Boyarsky, and carried
fines from $250 to nearly $l,OOO and
24 to 50 hours of community ser
vice. McCutcheon and Rushing
were not present and waited to dis
cuss the plea bargain with their
lawyers before a later hearing.
Carvahlo, who arranged the
power hour, Jenkins and Commis
siong agreed to fines of $912.50 and
community service, a larger penalty
than the $250 or less the other par
ties agreed to pay.
The case, referred to as the
"Stanford 9" by the courtroom
clerk, was a compromise, according
to Boyarsky.
"I see it as a compromise be
cause based on what the Stanford

police department brought us there
were a range of charges we could
have brought. It was a compromise
in terms of what were those in
volved in the event charged with."
Boyarsky said that for this
charge, the range between mini
mum and maximum penalties was
small, and providing alcohol to mi
nors yields no jail time.
"The defendants who weren't in
the dorm room might see them
selves as victims, but bad things can
happen when alcohol is involved,"
Boyarsky said. "It should serve as a
cautionary tale at Stanford."
University investigation
While the court case has ended,
the University investigation contin
ues.
According to Nanci Howe, the
assistant dean and director of stu
dent activities, one of the major dif
ferences between the police and
University investigations is that the
OCB reviews problematic group
behavior, while the police focus on
individual behavior.
"The police and University are
separate entities," said Morris
Graves, associate dean of students,
not specifically speaking about the
incident. "Something may not vio
late California state law, but it could
still violate University policy."
For example, the University
Greek Guide specifies that hazing
is "any activity or situation in
which pledges or actives are ex
pected to commit an unlawful act
or violate the Fundamental Stan
dard or Honor Code. Almost any
thing that pledged members are
required to do that initiated mem
bers don't is hazing. Ask yourself if

you could explain a questionable
activity to your parents, the par
ents of a pledge, a University offi
cial or a judge. If you don't think
you could, then it is probably haz
ing."
The OCB uses four criteria
when determining the sanctions,
such as alcohol probation or sus
pension, for problematic behav
ior. These include past precedent
for similar cases, the severity of
the violation, the pattern and his
tory of the group's behavior and
what the group has done to ac
cept responsibility and address
the situation.
If the OCB finds that the inci
dent is egregious, it can choose to
forward the case to the Greek
Housing Review Board, which
could place the sorority on a hous
ing probation or suspension.
"Chapter members are cooper
ating with the investigation, as it is
top priority to ensure the safety and
well being of all Tri-Delt members
in addition to the entire Stanford
community," the sorority said in a
statement. "Tri-Delt will continue
to strive for the excellence for
which it was recently recognized in
a letter of commendation by the
University."
Although the exact dates have
not been set, the case and two oth
ers still pending OCB review from
last spring is expected to be com
pleted by the end of February, ac
cording to Graves.
"Our ultimate goal is to keep
these things from happening and to
protect the students, University and
community from harm," said
Graves. "We must hold folks ac
countable and uphold the Universi
ty standards and values."
