# Make some friends on Friendster
## 
### 
Want to hook up with that hottie in I-
Hum section? In the olden days, the
ritual was so laborious: find out her
name, her friends, her dorm, her
after-section activities and then try to approach
her, you know, in that I-like-you sort of way.
And, in the end, you hope she isn't taken by an
other man. If luck be a lady, maybe your affec
tions will even be reciprocated.
But now, thanks to the Web site Friendster,
college singletons don't have it so hard. The on
line service works as follows: Web surfers regis
ter, post their pics and then "connect" to their
friends with access to bios of friends of then
friends. Henceforth, communities form.
Strangers meet. And love actually blossoms.
The popularity of the site has already been
demonstrated at Stanford, where dating so

says the talk of the town isn't the norm. Lone
ly on a Friday night? You can find hundreds of
your fellow students on the site, linked some
times by class or by dorm or even by organiza
tion, like, The Stanford Daily.
You can browse for a weekend fling or a long
term love interest; skim their interests, favorite
films and even see if the posters are on the look
out for a significant other. It's like cruising the li
brary for love, only faster. And more efficient.
No wonder that millions have joined Friendster
since it was started by San Francisco native
Jonathan Abrams last year.
And you should, too.
After all, there's nothing more disappointing
than surfing the Net, logging in and discovering
that cutie you're looking for isn't part of the
Friendster network. Friendly, it's not.
