## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK How she left Oxford behind 
### 
When I was a little girl,
bath mats were magic
carpets that could
whisk me far, far away,
across seas of linoleum and rivers of
caulk. I dreamt of exploring foreign
lands, places full of excitement and
adventure. Like a conquering hero,
I'd return home forever changed
and really tired.
Well kids, guess what: Dreams
really do come true! Almost a
month has passed since I left the
lovely grayness of Oxford behind
me. And now, my world fills up with
lessons:
1.) Europeans could use some
more personal freshness. A lot
more.
What is personal freshness? I
don't know. But the good people of
Europe are in dire need of it, espe
cially those who take the Tube.
Poor water pressure, cramped
living quarters and an abundance of
non-breathable synthetic fabrics are
all involved as well. I guess personal
freshness is ultimately one of those
things best defined by its absence
kind of like carbon-14 dating.
2.) Susan B. Anthony knew her
shit.
After visiting various cities in
Spain, Italy, France, Ireland and
England, I've come to realize that
women have more opportunities for
education and advancement in
America than anywhere else in the
world. I am very grateful and en
couraged by this fact. And then I am
depressed.
In any case, it turns out that the

vote really does matter. So let's use
it, if only to say, "Keep up the good
work, 19th Amendment!"
3.) I love American men.
American men possess, in vary
ing proportionality, an ideal mix of
respect and optimism when interact
ing with the ladies. Their behavior
bridges the gap between the Euro
pean preference for greeting Amer
ican women with either cold silence

or sexual harass
ment. In contrast
to the overly eager
Spanish and Ital
ians, American
men don't instant
ly assume you're a
slut, but unlike the
English, they still
have hope that
you might be one.
You see? Opti
mism!

I'm convinced this is what de
Tocqueville was talking about when
he wrote about the indomitable
American spirit and all that.
4.) It feels good to be expend
able.
In America, when a building gets
old and decrepit, they tear it down
and build a new one (Tresidder is a
notable exception). But in England,
they put a sign out front and charge
an entrance fee.
Also, in Europe, people actually
RUN OUT of things to buy and
not just of big-ticket items like
iPods and Volkswagons either, but
of everyday necessities like bagels
and bagged salad. Entire shelves
would be bare at my local grocery

store by the end of the week, like in
TV news scenes of Winn Dixies
across Florida during hurricane
watch. Panicked, I'd be compelled
to buy liters of water and C batter
ies by the cartful.
5.) Beer is not so gross.
I once thought beer was just a
quick route to frequent urination
and weight gain. But the merry pubs
of England have shown me that
downing a pint is also a something of
a social tradition, and a good way to
be drunk while staying well hydrat
ed.
I still can't say I like the taste of
beer, but I do appreciate its mildly
alcoholic fillingness. So the next
time I'm in a pub, and there's no
Diet Coke to be had, then sure, pass
me a beer.
Things associated with Europe
that I really, really hate:
1.) Umlauts Inherently evil.
2.) My passport photo An
ugly passport photo only gets uglier
with time.
3.) Hitler What a bastard. The
English hate Hitler on a day-to-day
basis more than we Americans do,
having been bombed by the Nazis,
and then having to hear us say, "If it
weren't for us, you'd be speaking
German right now," forever after.

ing with the ladies. Their behavior
bridges the gap between the Euro
pean preference for greeting Amer
ican women with either cold silence

or sexual harass
ment. In contrast
to the overly eager
Spanish and Ital
ians, American
men don't instant
ly assume you're a
slut, but unlike the
English, they still
have hope that
you might be one.
You see? Opti
mism!

I'm convinced this is what de
Tocqueville was talking about when
he wrote about the indomitable
American spirit and all that.
4.) It feels good to be expend
able.
In America, when a building gets
old and decrepit, they tear it down
and build a new one (Tresidder is a
notable exception). But in England,
they put a sign out front and charge
an entrance fee.
Also, in Europe, people actually
RUN OUT of things to buy and
not just of big-ticket items like
iPods and Volkswagons either, but
of everyday necessities like bagels
and bagged salad. Entire shelves
would be bare at my local grocery

store by the end of the week, like in
TV news scenes of Winn Dixies
across Florida during hurricane
watch. Panicked, I'd be compelled
to buy liters of water and C batter
ies by the cartful.
5.) Beer is not so gross.
I once thought beer was just a
quick route to frequent urination
and weight gain. But the merry pubs
of England have shown me that
downing a pint is also a something of
a social tradition, and a good way to
be drunk while staying well hydrat
ed.
I still can't say I like the taste of
beer, but I do appreciate its mildly
alcoholic fillingness. So the next
time I'm in a pub, and there's no
Diet Coke to be had, then sure, pass
me a beer.
Things associated with Europe
that I really, really hate:
1.) Umlauts Inherently evil.
2.) My passport photo An
ugly passport photo only gets uglier
with time.
3.) Hitler What a bastard. The
English hate Hitler on a day-to-day
basis more than we Americans do,
having been bombed by the Nazis,
and then having to hear us say, "If it
weren't for us, you'd be speaking
German right now," forever after.
