## Bush right to heed call to the stars 
### GEOFF KOCH STAFF COLUMNIST 
Why Mars? Sure there is
enthusiasm enough
for the apparent suc
cess of the rover Spir
it. Space fans, of course, fervently
hope that the rover avoids that
pesky airbag and successfully rolls
off its landing pad and begins the
task of exploration in earnest. Fin
gers are crossed that Spirit's twin
rover, Opportunity, safely joins it
on Mars on Jan. 24 as scheduled.
Beyond the true believers any
one with even a passing curiosity,
thanks in part to saturated media
coverage, has been treated to the
full color and literally alien images
that Spirit is beaming back to Earth.
Yet as President Bush prepares
to announce a new space initiative
which may include plans to send
men and women to Mars, skepti
cism hangs in the air.
In the face of a jobless recovery,
an ongoing and complicated com
mitment to Iraq and a ballooning
federal deficit, perhaps the money
would be better spent on entirely
terrestrial concerns, critics say. And
regardless, plans for manned space
flight will need to be tempered by
NASA reforms called for in the
wake of the Columbia accident and
a commitment to continued robotic
missions.

United States spending on space
as a percentage of GDP has steadily
diminished since the days of the
Apollo program. Today slightly
more than 0.1 percent of the GDP is
spent on NASA. In 1966, by con
trast, space spending topped 0.75
percent of the economy $BO bil
lion in today's dollars.
Apollo's big budgets had more
than a few critics. After meeting
President Kennedy's goal to send a
man to the moon and return him
safely to Earth, trouncing the Sovi
ets in the space race in the process,
manned space flight floundered for
a purpose.
Yet that $BO billion, almost ex
actly what President Bush recently
asked of Congress for ongoing op
erations in Iraq, bought more than
round trip ticket to our nearest
planetary neighbor. It captured the
imagination of people around the
world.
Hundred of Poles flocked to the
United States Embassy in Warsaw
to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz
Aldrin walk on the moon in 1969.
Other countries issued postage
stamps in honor of the accomplish
ment and a Peruvian woman who
gave birth during the mission
named her son Neil Armstrong. In
all more than 500 million people
were riveted to televisions when
Armstrong took "one giant leap for
mankind."

There is little in today's federal
budget, or in the United States
economy in general, that inspires
wonder. If anything, American
hegemony, be it military or eco
nomic, engenders discomfort, fear
and outright resentment even
among United States allies and
friends. Will the $BO billion spent in
Iraq inspire the next generation of
optimistic explorers?
Those optimistic explorers, or at
least those curious about our place in
the solar system, are still out there.
Consider the traffic to NASA's Mars
related Web sites of late. Between
Jan. 4 and 7 these sites were hit more
than a billion times. In comparison,
these sites received 2.8 billion hits in
all of 2003. It would take more than
20,000 CDs, a stack more 100 feet
high without cases, to store the 15 ter
abytes of information downloaded
during those three days.
Bush is right to restart manned
space flight, particularly if he extends
an invitation to other nations to join
the United States in its interplane
tary endeavors. The hope in turning
together to the stars is that we, as
human beings, may become motivat
ed by a challenge greater than the
one we pose to each other today.
