## Women sink Arizona, ASU 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Sunday's game between the
No. 7 Stanford women's basket
ball team (13-2, 6-0 Pacific 10
Conference) and the Arizona
Wildcats (12-4, 4-1) was sup
posed to be a hotly contested
matchup between the two re
maining unbeaten teams in the
conference. Instead, the Cardinal
opened the game with a near-per
fect first half and turned the con
test into a laugher, resulting in a
84-62 victory.
Stanford came blazing out of
the gate on both the offensive and
defensive ends of the floor, jump
ing out to a 9-0 lead and not allow
ing the Wildcats to score until 4:37
into the first half.
"[Former Stanford star] Vanes
sa Nygaard once said that I'm a
coach in search of the perfect
game," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "And really our
first half was almost flawless."
It's not often that praise like that
comes from the mouth of Van-
Derveer— but it was more than
deserved on Saturday.
The Cardinal was absolutely re
lentless in the first half. Stanford
shot an astounding 60.7 percent
from the field in the half, which
powered a 23-5 run that opened
the game.
Arizona head coach Joan Bon
vicini called several timeouts to at
tempt to stop the bleeding, but
there was nothing that could cool
down the Cardinal shooters
who by halftime had built a 44-12
lead.
The Wildcats feature a high
powered offensive attack led by
the Shaq-like sophomore center
Shawntinice Polk and junior guard
Dee-Dee Wheeler. Polk averages
16.7 points per game, 9.5 rebounds
per game and 2.7 blocks per game
while Wheeler puts up 17.4 ppg, 4.3
rpg and 5.1 assists per game.
On Saturday, however, the
Wildcat offense was no match for
the Cardinal defense, which cur

rently leads the Pac-10 in points al
lowed per game.
Anchoring Stanford's defense
was junior T'Nae Thiel, who start
ed as a result of Chelsea Trotter's
knee problems. Thiel, who is mak
ing her way back into the rotation
after foot surgery, had the unenvi
able assignment of guarding Polk
and she proved herself to be
more than capable.
Thiel, who gives up a good four
inches and who knows how many
pounds to the 6-foot-5 center, frus
trated the Polk all afternoon. Ari
zona was seldom able to feed the
ball to Polk in the post and when
she was able to get the ball, she was
too far outside to do anything pro
ductive with it. Polk finished the
game with as many turnovers as
points (six), but chipped in on the
boards, pulling down eight re
bounds.
Polk may have been slowed by
an injury sustained on Arizona's
first possession of the ballgame.
The center tweaked her right knee
while going for a rebound and had
to be helped off the court by team
mates. She recovered quickly
though, returning to the court mid
way through the first half. Howev
er, if she was feeling any pain it
wasn't evident as her movement
wasn't at all slowed.
"[Polk's] obviously got us off
balance a little bit," said Bonvicini.
"She's a big part of what we do, but
she was able to come back really
quickly."
The Cardinal offense was just as
stellar as its defense. Four players
Nicole Powell (15 points), Thiel
(11), Kelley Suminski (11) and
Krista Rappahahn (16) record
ed double-digit scoring figures and
two others Azella Perryman
and Sebnem Kimyacioglu—just
missed that mark, finishing with
nine points apiece.
Stanford moved the ball around
extremely well, tallying 26 assists
on 31 field goals. Powell led the
way in the assist category with

and another 13 points in Stanford's victory over Arizona State on Saturday.
