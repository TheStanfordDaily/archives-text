# Three-pointers key to Cardinal win
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
You live by the three, you die by the three. At least that's been the
case for the No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team (13-2, 6-0 Pacific
10 Conference).
This weekend's matchups with Arizona and Arizona State were cases in
point of the Cardinal's reliance on its outside shooting.
Stanford has the ability to light things up from downtown, as seen in Sat
urday's dominating win over Arizona when it shot 15-27 from three-point
range an outstanding 55.6 percent clip.
The Cardinal's 15 treys one short of the single-game school record
powered a Stanford offense that seemed unstoppable.
Stanford's roster boasts four players that shoot well enough to be con
sidered three-point shooting specialists on almost any squad in the nation in
juniors Sebnem Kimyacioglu, Susan Borchardt, Kelley Suminski and sopho
more Krista Rappahahn. And you can't forget senior Nicole Powell, who, as
the most versatile player in the country, is by no means a specialist, but can
shoot the three with anybody.
The Cardinal certainly has more shooting talent than any other team in
the Pac-10 and its talent can rival almost any team in the nation.
Head coach Tara VanDerveer is certainly aware of her team's shooting
prowess and isn't afraid to let her players fire at will. The Cardinal has at
tempted more three-point field goals than any other team in the Pac-10, but
has also drained more.
Fifteen of the Cardinal's 116 three-point field goals came on Saturday
and it could not have frustrated Arizona more.
"I don't think they could have shot three-pointers better than that in
practice," said Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini.
The talent of Stanford's shooters makes the three-pointer a high-per
centage shot, but no shooter or team of shooters can hit the three with
that kind of consistency every time it takes the court. An off night is in
evitable at some point.
Thursday night was one of those off nights for the Cardinal. The Cardi
nal shot just 2-for-9 from behind the arc in the first half and went into the
locker room with just 27 total points and a six-point lead against a far less tal
ented Sun Devil squad.
The Cardinal was able to find a way to win without much of an outside
game with the exception of two huge back-to-back threes from Powell in
the second half against a team like Arizona State, but come NCAA Tour
nament time these types of shooting performances will likely result in a loss.
Stanford's two losses have come against top-five programs (Ten
nessee and Texas Tech) and the Cardinal shot a combined 9-38 from
three-point range.
Despite the clear correlation between the game's end result and Stan
ford's outside shooting performance, VanDerveer has repeatedly stated
that she is comfortable with the team's shot selection.
"We're taking shots that we can make," VanDerveer said. "So why
wouldn't we keep taking them?"
While Stanford's off shooting nights have shown its vulnerability, the up
side cannot be questioned. The ability to drain the three powered Stanford's
almost flawless first half against Arizona. The trey accounted for 24 of the
Cardinal's 44 first half points and the Cardinal's 32-point lead, which, even
if the Wildcats had equivalent firepower, would have needed a miracle to
overcome.
