# Gymnasts own the floor in weekend meet
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Six members of the sixth-ranked Stanford's women's gymnastics team were in
tently warming up no-handed handsprings, double twisting layouts and double
pike saltos at last Friday's meet as fans clapped to "All Right Now" in the back
ground. Suddenly, the gymnasts stopped in their tracks and formed a circle on the
floor.
"5-6-7-8," Flip?
Instead of just jumping on the climactic beat of "All Right Now," the gymnasts
flipped synchronized back tucks. "Whoo!" the fans cheered.
The women's gymnastics team has kicked off the floor exercise with its own
touch of "All Right Now" for at least four years, but the Cardinal has rarely kicked
off its season with such high-scoring routines on the floor exercise.
Last season, floor was the Cardinal's weakest event in almost half the meets
and the average team score on floor was 49.05, lower than any of the other
three events.
"In the past, we have not lived up to our potential on floor," Stanford head
coach Kristen Smyth said.
At Friday's meet, however, the team posted a collective score of 49.15, one
tenth higher than last year's average. The Cardinal won the meet by a sizable mar
gin, posting a collective score of 196.2 over Central Michigan's score of 194.475,
Sacramento State's 191.475 and San Jose State's 191.075.
Senior Lise Leveille led the charge on floor exercise with a 9.925 and won first
on the event, beating out the 9.9 of Kara Reighard of Central Michigan who
placed 11th on floor at last year's nationals. Leveille also won the All-Around
with a 39.425.
Leveille debuted a new routine to remixed tango music. Despite flashy new
choreography, Leveille's old style still
shined through, complete with a big
smile and explosive tumbling passes.
"I enjoy performing it," Leveille
said. "I can play with it and have fun
with it. And there's still room for im
provement so that's exciting too."
Seniors Caroline Fluhrer and
Shelly Goldberg and sophomore Na
talie Foley also debuted new floor
routines. Foley, who opened her rou
tine with some of the highest tum
bling all night, took second on floor
for the Cardinal and third overall
with a 9.85.
Despite the team's improvement,
Smyth wants more on floor.
"There were some really nice indi
vidual performances; Lise Leveille
and Lindsay Wing were stunning. But
as a team we can do a lot better,"
Smyth said.
Smyth wants to improve the gym
nasts' tumbling, confidence and disci
pline on the exercise. She is also looking
for Goldberg, who fell at the end of her
routine on Friday, to step up her ability

to follow through at meets.
"We did well [Friday], but can defi
nitely improve," said Wing who scored
a 9.8 on floor. "We can clean up our
form on tumbling, be crisper in the cor
ners and work on our performance
level even more."
"Floor should be the team's strength
this year with the kind of dance and
tumbling talent we have," Smyth said.
"If we do what we need to do, we should
be among the nation's top four teams
on floor."
Floor was the team's second-highest
scoring event Friday, trailing the un
even bars by .015.
Fluhrer, an All-American on bars,
swung high for the Cardinal with a
huge Tkatchev release and a double
layout dismount which she stuck with
out a flinch. The crowd chanted for a
10, but the judges gave it a 9.925 to win
the event.
Foley and Wing, also All-Ameri
cans on bars, respectively posted a 9.9
and 9.85 to take second and third.
Freshmen Erin Geary and Stacy Spran
do, a national champion on bars as a
high school senior, debuted on bars for
the Cardinal and Sprando contributed
with a 9.8.
The Cardinal was rock solid on bal
ance beam as in past years, with the one

two punch of Pacific-10 Conference
balance beam champions Wing and
Leveille leading the team with a 9.85
and 9.825, respectively. Foley also post
ed a 9.825 and each Stanford gymnast
hit her routine without a fall.
Vault proved to be Stanford's weak
est event of the meet, with only two of
six gymnasts sticking their landings.
Leveille scored a 9.85 and tied for sec
ond place behind Central Michigan's
Mattie Crawford.
Sophomore Jessica Louie, who
competed all four events for the first
time, and Wing, who competed vault
only once last year, each vaulted to
9.625. Both Wing and Louie will in
crease the difficulty of their vaults as the
season progresses.
The Cardinal will hit the road this
weekend to face No. 9 ranked Arizona
State. The Sun Devils have not yet com
peted this season, but look to be a chal
lenging match-up for Stanford.
"ASU is a good team and will be
tough to compete against at their own
arena with their fans," Wing said.
"We need to take what we did
tonight on the road," Smyth said.
"We need to be a bit more aggressive
and precise, particularly on floor [...
.] I'm definitely looking for floor to
lead this team."
