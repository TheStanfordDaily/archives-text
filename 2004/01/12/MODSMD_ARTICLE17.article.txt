# Kelly takes coaching job with Blue Devils
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford football team's offensive coordina
tor, David Kelly, left the Farm to work at Duke on
Friday. Kelly will coach the Blue Devils' wide re
ceivers and serve as associate head coach.
Kelly, an original member of Stanford head
coach Buddy Teevens' staff and the Cardinal's as
sociate head coach, will join Ted Roofs staff at
Duke. Kelly and Roof both were on the staff at
Georgia Tech in 2000 and 2001, where Kelly
coached wide receivers.
"Being from the South, I love Stanford, but
here is the same school on the East Coast, back
home, with a valued friend that I have a tremen
dous amount of confidence in," Kelly said. "Those
intangibles were the major reason this decision
was made."
Roof was named head coach midway through
last season, so this off-season has been his first chance
to hire his own coaching staff. Duke went 4-8 last
year, 2-4 under Roof —including, incidentally, a 41-
17 win over Georga Tech.
Georgia Tech defeated then-No. 11 Stanford,
coached by Tyrone Willingham, in the 2001 Seattle
Bowl. Kelly's receivers torched the Cardinal sec
ondary for 266 receiving yards, including 10 catches

for 106 yards by Kelly Campbell, who now plays for
the Minnesota Vikings.
After Willingham left the Farm to coach Notre
Dame, Kelly switched from one bowl game sideline
to the other, joining Teevens to serve as Stanford's
wide receivers coach in 2002. His promotion to of
fensive coordinator this year coincided with im
proved offensive productivity for the Cardinal. Stan
ford scored 20.5 points per game this year while going
4-7, both improvements over the 16.9 points per
game and 2-9 record the Cardinal posted in 2002.
"We're very excited to have David join our staff,"
Roof said. "He's a great football coach, a great re
cruiter and, more importantly, a fantastic person."
Teevens and the Cardinal were sorry to see the
outspoken Kelly leave the Farm. Kelly's vacant
coaching position has not yet been filled.
"David has been a tremendous asset to our foot
ball staff and our program," Teevens said. "We wish
him and his family all the best at Duke."
Kelly leaves the Stanford program on good
terms.
"I would go to the end of the world for Buddy
Teevens," Kelly said. "But Buddy Teevens himself
would say, anytime you get tremendous opportu
nities that are going to enhance your living in what
ever areas are important to you, you have to take a
hard look at it."
