# Postseason trauma leaves Babin a free-agent fan
## 
### 
First off, congratulations where con
gratulations are due: to the women
for taking it to both Arizona schools
at home, and to the "road warriors"

in the desert, for sneaking a nail
biter out in Tempe, Ariz, before flat
out dominating the Wildcats on
their own turf, again. Though it's a
long season and everyone knows
that nothing matters until March,
you have to like the basketball
you're seeing so far this season...
Now on to the sport that I really
spent my weekend watching the
NFL playoffs.

The postseason started off horribly for
me. I spent the weekend before the start of
winter quarter driving back to Stanford from
Colorado, and had the extreme misfortune
of getting stuck for four hours on Interstate
70 just west of Vail, Colo., on Sunday. When
you're on a 1,400-mile, 21-hour car ride, you

really don't want to spend any extra time in
the car. Especially when you're not moving
and you're stuck in a blizzard. But there's
more than that. You see it gets even worse

when your only companion is a
younger sibling who wants absolutely
no part in driving, would very much
prefer to fly and feels the need to tell
you this every few minutes.
And then the final nail in the
proverbial coffin you're still within
radio range for the Broncos-Colts
game.
You see at the beginning, I
thought this was a blessing. Hey, I
may be stuck here on the highway for

hours, but at least I have the Broncos. With
the advantages of a healthy Jake Plummer
and a healed Clinton Portis, Denver was
playing a team that they treated like a J.V.
squad just 14 days before. This was all I had
to look forward to for the next couple hun
dred minutes. A lone star in a cloudy sky.

The peanut in my Cracker Jack. My needle
in the haystack.
(Ok, you see where I'm going with it.)
And then the game started.
The Colts scored on their first drive. On
their sixth play. Even on the radio it was ugly.
But the Broncos came right back and
slammed in a field goal. It looked for a mo
ment like it would be the shoot-out everyone
predicted, a match up between two of the
AFC's most potent offenses.
The Colts supported that view with then
next possession, scoring again on only eight
plays. And then they scored again. And
again. And again. And again ...
My anger at the situation was reaching
boiling point. I wanted to be out of the traf
fic jam and off of that closed highway right
then not even to get closer to Califor
nia, but just to get the hell out of the range
of 850 KOA radio. It was like an auditory
sports train wreck it was ugly, awful,
deadly . .. and I couldn't turn away from

it. I was haunted, depressed ... and still
stuck in traffic.
It was, clearly, a royal beating. 41-10 in the
end. The Colts didn't even have to punt once.
Eventually, thankfully, the game was
over. And the highway reopened.
Though if the Broncos dismantling has
had one benefit, it's been the fact that I've
now been able to enjoy incredible games as a
non-partisan fan. I was the contrarian to my
Seattle friends as Hasselbeck talked smack
at the beginning of overtime. I sweated bul
lets with my friends from Boston as the
Foxboro Fanatics watched their game with
the Titans go down to the wire. As I write this
I'm pulling for McNabb to lead the Eagles on
a last second comeback.
Freed from my Broncos monogamy, I'm
now a free-agent fan. It's incredibly liberat
ing. (And a great excuse to watch every
game, every day.) It's fine that I really could
care less about Carolina. And even though I
was pulling for McNair and the Titans on

Saturday, I feel completely justified backing
the Pats next week against Peyton and the
@#%s Colts.
(Not that I'm still bitter about that game
last week, or anything ...)
I have a friend, from an un-named universi
ty, who is currently back in Denver and slightly
less than employed. He described himself to me
as a "professional sports fan." My God he
must feel like this everyday, with every sport,
and any team. Tell you what, don't tell the folks
in the EPS department, but I might look into
something like that, the way the job market is
looking now.
Until the Broncos season starts up, again,
anyway...

tional Policy Studies who is convinced that
John Elway could have beaten the @#%s
Colts. Seriously. Email him at babin@stan

over. And the highway reopened.
Though if the Broncos dismantling has
had one benefit, it's been the fact that I've
now been able to enjoy incredible games as a
non-partisan fan. I was the contrarian to my
Seattle friends as Hasselbeck talked smack
at the beginning of overtime. I sweated bul
lets with my friends from Boston as the
Foxboro Fanatics watched their game with
the Titans go down to the wire. As I write this
I'm pulling for McNabb to lead the Eagles on
a last second comeback.
Freed from my Broncos monogamy, I'm
now a free-agent fan. It's incredibly liberat
ing. (And a great excuse to watch every
game, every day.) It's fine that I really could
care less about Carolina. And even though I
was pulling for McNair and the Titans on

Saturday, I feel completely justified backing
the Pats next week against Peyton and the
@#%s Colts.
(Not that I'm still bitter about that game
last week, or anything ...)
I have a friend, from an un-named universi
ty, who is currently back in Denver and slightly
less than employed. He described himself to me
as a "professional sports fan." My God he
must feel like this everyday, with every sport,
and any team. Tell you what, don't tell the folks
in the EPS department, but I might look into
something like that, the way the job market is
looking now.
Until the Broncos season starts up, again,
anyway...

First off, congratulations where con
gratulations are due: to the women
for taking it to both Arizona schools
at home, and to the "road warriors"

in the desert, for sneaking a nail
biter out in Tempe, Ariz, before flat
out dominating the Wildcats on
their own turf, again. Though it's a
long season and everyone knows
that nothing matters until March,
you have to like the basketball
you're seeing so far this season...
Now on to the sport that I really
spent my weekend watching the
NFL playoffs.

The postseason started off horribly for
me. I spent the weekend before the start of
winter quarter driving back to Stanford from
Colorado, and had the extreme misfortune
of getting stuck for four hours on Interstate
70 just west of Vail, Colo., on Sunday. When
you're on a 1,400-mile, 21-hour car ride, you

really don't want to spend any extra time in
the car. Especially when you're not moving
and you're stuck in a blizzard. But there's
more than that. You see it gets even worse

when your only companion is a
younger sibling who wants absolutely
no part in driving, would very much
prefer to fly and feels the need to tell
you this every few minutes.
And then the final nail in the
proverbial coffin you're still within
radio range for the Broncos-Colts
game.
You see at the beginning, I
thought this was a blessing. Hey, I
may be stuck here on the highway for

hours, but at least I have the Broncos. With
the advantages of a healthy Jake Plummer
and a healed Clinton Portis, Denver was
playing a team that they treated like a J.V.
squad just 14 days before. This was all I had
to look forward to for the next couple hun
dred minutes. A lone star in a cloudy sky.

The peanut in my Cracker Jack. My needle
in the haystack.
(Ok, you see where I'm going with it.)
And then the game started.
The Colts scored on their first drive. On
their sixth play. Even on the radio it was ugly.
But the Broncos came right back and
slammed in a field goal. It looked for a mo
ment like it would be the shoot-out everyone
predicted, a match up between two of the
AFC's most potent offenses.
The Colts supported that view with then
next possession, scoring again on only eight
plays. And then they scored again. And
again. And again. And again ...
My anger at the situation was reaching
boiling point. I wanted to be out of the traf
fic jam and off of that closed highway right
then not even to get closer to Califor
nia, but just to get the hell out of the range
of 850 KOA radio. It was like an auditory
sports train wreck it was ugly, awful,
deadly . .. and I couldn't turn away from

it. I was haunted, depressed ... and still
stuck in traffic.
It was, clearly, a royal beating. 41-10 in the
end. The Colts didn't even have to punt once.
Eventually, thankfully, the game was
over. And the highway reopened.
