# Card takes out Michigan
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weeekend in Ann Arbor, Mich., the No. 3
Stanford men's swim team took on the No. 6 Michi
gan Wolverines. The meet was held in an unfamiliar
short course meters format in preparation for the
upcoming NCAA Swimming and Diving Champi
onships, which will use that arrangement.
As expected, the Wolverines were well-prepared
for the arrival of the Cardinal. Using its strong dis
tance-swimmers to heighten the team's energy,
Michigan led Stanford 87.5-76.5 after the first day of
competition. However, despite cold weather
even by Michigan standards and a boisterous
crowd, the Cardinal outscored the Wolverines 139-
104 on the second day to clinch the victory by a final
score of 215.5-191.5.
Just as expected, Michigan started the first ses
sion with a bang. The Wolverines are known for
dominant distance-swimmers, and the first individu
al event of the meet was the 1,500-meter freestyle—
the longest event in swimming. After the Cardinal
easily took the 200-meter medley relay, Michigan
swept the 1,500, finishing 1-2-3. Leading the way for
the Wolverines was sophomore All-American Peter
Vanderkaay.
Encouraged by its early success, Michigan went
on to split the four individual events with Stanford
before winning the last event of the day, the 800-
meter free-relay. Junior Jayme Cramer and senior
Peter Marshall won the 100-meter butterfly and
backstroke, respectively, for the Cardinal, but then
efforts proved insufficient to prevent a first day
deficit for their squad.
Beginning the second day of the meet, the Cardi
nal knew they needed to bring more energy to the
pool. In order to gain that extra charge, the Cardinal
looked to its stellar freshman class, and the frosh de
livered.
"The biggest change between the days was the
freshman," explained senior Andrew Schnell.
"They came out the second day fighting, never giv
ing up. It was good to not see [them] quit."
The first event of the day was the 400-meter med
ley-relay, and the Cardinal promptly took first and
second places. The 1-2 finish erased the deficit and
propelled the Cardinal into the lead. However, the
next event was another Michigan favorite, the 800-
meter freestyle.
The Wolverines expected a 1-2-3 like they had in
the 1,500 free, an outcome that would certainly bring

momentum back to their side of the deck. However,
Cardinal sophomore Tobias Oriwol had other plans,
taking second place in the event. Oriwol nearly took
down Vanderkaay, finishing less than half a second
behind. After the 800 the Wolverines regained the
lead, but Oriwol's efforts to break up the sweep
brought the Cardinal swimmers to their feet.
"[Oriwol] gave us the confidence to know that we
could come out on top," freshman Kyle Ransom
said. "He was the jump start our team needed."
In the next event, the 200-meter freestyle, Michi
gan's Dan Ketchum proved victorious, increasing
the Wolverines' lead to 115.5-103.5.
That lead, however, did not last for more than ten
minutes as the Cardinal swept the next two events 1-
2-3-4 and 1-2-3. In the 50-meter freestyle, freshman
Ben Wildman-Tobriner led the way followed by se
niors Bobby O'Bryan, Schnell and Scott Ransen
berg. Shortly after, senior Markus Rogan won the

200-meter individual medley, with freshmen
Hongzhe Sun and Keenan Newman finishing sec
ond and third.
The flurry of points gave the Cardinal a 14-point
lead, and the team never looked back.
Marshall proceeded to win the 100-meter
freestyle for Stanford, followed by another victo
ry for Rogan in the 200-meter backstroke. The
Wolverines did finish 1-2 in the 400-meter
freestyle, but it was too little too late for "Big
Blue." Newman finished the individual event
schedule with another win for the Cardinal in the
200-meter breaststroke.
With added support from diver Adam Peterson,
who won the 1-meter springboard event, the Cardi
nal's Saturday charge led it to victory.
The Cardinal now turns its attention to this
Saturday, when Stanford hosts the University of
Pacific.

That lead, however, did not last for more than ten
minutes as the Cardinal swept the next two events 1-
2-3-4 and 1-2-3. In the 50-meter freestyle, freshman
Ben Wildman-Tobriner led the way followed by se
niors Bobby O'Bryan, Schnell and Scott Ransen
berg. Shortly after, senior Markus Rogan won the

200-meter individual medley, with freshmen
Hongzhe Sun and Keenan Newman finishing sec
ond and third.
The flurry of points gave the Cardinal a 14-point
lead, and the team never looked back.
Marshall proceeded to win the 100-meter
freestyle for Stanford, followed by another victo
ry for Rogan in the 200-meter backstroke. The
Wolverines did finish 1-2 in the 400-meter
freestyle, but it was too little too late for "Big
Blue." Newman finished the individual event
schedule with another win for the Cardinal in the
200-meter breaststroke.
With added support from diver Adam Peterson,
who won the 1-meter springboard event, the Cardi
nal's Saturday charge led it to victory.
The Cardinal now turns its attention to this
Saturday, when Stanford hosts the University of
Pacific.

The No.3 Cardinal got outscored by the No. 6 Wolverines in the first day of competition, until on Day 2,
Stanford was jumpstarted by a great performance from sophomore Tobias Oriwol. The Cardinal swept
the 50-meter freestyle and the 200-meter IM to overtake Michigan for the win.
Last weeekend in Ann Arbor, Mich., the No. 3
Stanford men's swim team took on the No. 6 Michi
gan Wolverines. The meet was held in an unfamiliar
short course meters format in preparation for the
upcoming NCAA Swimming and Diving Champi
onships, which will use that arrangement.
As expected, the Wolverines were well-prepared
for the arrival of the Cardinal. Using its strong dis
tance-swimmers to heighten the team's energy,
Michigan led Stanford 87.5-76.5 after the first day of
competition. However, despite cold weather
even by Michigan standards and a boisterous
crowd, the Cardinal outscored the Wolverines 139-
104 on the second day to clinch the victory by a final
score of 215.5-191.5.
Just as expected, Michigan started the first ses
sion with a bang. The Wolverines are known for
dominant distance-swimmers, and the first individu
al event of the meet was the 1,500-meter freestyle—
the longest event in swimming. After the Cardinal
easily took the 200-meter medley relay, Michigan
swept the 1,500, finishing 1-2-3. Leading the way for
the Wolverines was sophomore All-American Peter
Vanderkaay.
Encouraged by its early success, Michigan went
on to split the four individual events with Stanford
before winning the last event of the day, the 800-
meter free-relay. Junior Jayme Cramer and senior
Peter Marshall won the 100-meter butterfly and
backstroke, respectively, for the Cardinal, but then
efforts proved insufficient to prevent a first day
deficit for their squad.
Beginning the second day of the meet, the Cardi
nal knew they needed to bring more energy to the
pool. In order to gain that extra charge, the Cardinal
looked to its stellar freshman class, and the frosh de
livered.
"The biggest change between the days was the
freshman," explained senior Andrew Schnell.
"They came out the second day fighting, never giv
ing up. It was good to not see [them] quit."
The first event of the day was the 400-meter med
ley-relay, and the Cardinal promptly took first and
second places. The 1-2 finish erased the deficit and
propelled the Cardinal into the lead. However, the
next event was another Michigan favorite, the 800-
meter freestyle.
The Wolverines expected a 1-2-3 like they had in
the 1,500 free, an outcome that would certainly bring

momentum back to their side of the deck. However,
Cardinal sophomore Tobias Oriwol had other plans,
taking second place in the event. Oriwol nearly took
down Vanderkaay, finishing less than half a second
behind. After the 800 the Wolverines regained the
lead, but Oriwol's efforts to break up the sweep
brought the Cardinal swimmers to their feet.
"[Oriwol] gave us the confidence to know that we
could come out on top," freshman Kyle Ransom
said. "He was the jump start our team needed."
In the next event, the 200-meter freestyle, Michi
gan's Dan Ketchum proved victorious, increasing
the Wolverines' lead to 115.5-103.5.
That lead, however, did not last for more than ten
minutes as the Cardinal swept the next two events 1-
2-3-4 and 1-2-3. In the 50-meter freestyle, freshman
Ben Wildman-Tobriner led the way followed by se
niors Bobby O'Bryan, Schnell and Scott Ransen
berg. Shortly after, senior Markus Rogan won the

200-meter individual medley, with freshmen
Hongzhe Sun and Keenan Newman finishing sec
ond and third.
