# Workers upset over mandatory vacations
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
The University's money-saving measure of shutting Stanford down
over winter break has left some employees annoyed about being forced
to use their vacation days.
"It's really a shame, because it means that when [my family] are able
to take vacation, I won't be able to spend time with them because I had
to use up my vacation days," said Ajit Chaudhari, a mechanical engi
neering research associate. "The great benefit of having vacation days
is to give employees flexibility to take vacation when they want to, so
it's a lot less valuable when I lose that flexibility."
Chaudhari was forced to use five of his 15 allotted vacation days for
the year.
Chris Dyrby, a research assistant in the Biomechanical Engineering
department and motion analysis engineer at Stanford Hospital, had al
ready taken a long trip this academic year, so his vacation days were al
ready seriously depleted.
"Emotionally, it really ticked me off that they forced us to use our
vacation in order to do this," he said.
Dyrby said that he had expressed his concerns about the required
time off with his office manager, but while she understood his griev
ances, "there really wasn't anything that she could do about it."
Chaudhari didn't bother to complain "because it seemed like a de
cree from on high that wasn't up for discussion," he said. "It certainly
didn't seem as though there would be anyone who'd listen, and I un
derstand that desperate times call for desperate measures."
Susan Hoerger, director of employee and labor relations, said the
University has not received any employee complaints about the closure
and has, in fact, received positive feedback from those who "appreciat
ed having extra time off to spend with their families and friends during
the holidays."

Money-saving move or lost
productivity?
This year's closure, unlike previ
ous shutdowns, was required of all
areas except essential operations,
rather than voluntarily chosen by in
dividual departments. Departments
were also "strongly encouraged" to
stayed closed for the week after
Dec. 26, although the final decision
was left to department managers.
Employees were alerted of this in a
July memo from Randy Livingston,
vice president for business affairs.
University officials say the shut
down was enforced to save money
both through utility costs and by re
quiring employees to use their va
cation time.
During the closure, employees
received four or five paid days off
and had to use two or five days of ac
crued vacation time, personal time
off or approved leave without pay,
depending on whether their depart
ment was closed during the second
week.
"We realize this may not be opti
mal for every employee," Liv
ingston said in a press release before
the closing. "This was a decision we
made in the interests of the overall
university."
Dyrby said he was annoyed
about the forced use of vacation
times, though he is not against the
shutdown in itself. Chaudhari ob
jected to the fact that the closing in
terrupted research work.
"After two weeks off, it takes a
considerable amount of time to get
my brain back in gear to think about

the problems I'm trying to solve,"
he said.
For this reason, Chaudhari said
he thinks that the forced closing is
detrimental to both employees and
the University.
"The University loses money in
lost productivity over the time that
research staff, and probably admin
istrative staff as well to some de
gree, has to get back up to speed,"
he said.
But in the press release, Liv
ingston defended the decision.
"Given that so much of the uni
versity population was going to be
absent, it appeared to make sense to
close whole buildings and depart
ments rather than to keep them open
for just a few employees," he said.
Administrators intend to contin
ue winter closing during the week of
Christmas, Hoerger said. Closing
during the following week will be
decided on a year-to-year basis.
Chaudhari said that while he un
derstands the financial need for a
closure, he would prefer if it weren't
so extreme.
"Since the University was run
ning a deficit, I could accept a shut
down as an alternative to layoffs or
other more painful cuts," he said.
"However, I don't think it's appro
priate as a normal university policy
in years when we aren't. There are
many employees whose primary
function is to do research, like my
self. We can still do a lot of work
even if all administrative and sup
port staff is not around."
So while Chauhari accepts the
utility shutdown, he hopes in the fu
ture that he will not be prohibited
from working.
"I'd be happy to bring in a per
sonal space heater to keep warm if
the University wants to shut down
the heat in all buildings," he said. .
