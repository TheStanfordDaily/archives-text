# Workers upset over mandatory vacations
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
The University's money-saving measure of shutting Stanford down
over winter break has left some employees annoyed about being forced
to use their vacation days.
"It's really a shame, because it means that when [my family] are able
to take vacation, I won't be able to spend time with them because I had
to use up my vacation days," said Ajit Chaudhari, a mechanical engi
neering research associate. "The great benefit of having vacation days
is to give employees flexibility to take vacation when they want to, so
it's a lot less valuable when I lose that flexibility."
Chaudhari was forced to use five of his 15 allotted vacation days for
the year.
Chris Dyrby, a research assistant in the Biomechanical Engineering
department and motion analysis engineer at Stanford Hospital, had al
ready taken a long trip this academic year, so his vacation days were al
ready seriously depleted.
"Emotionally, it really ticked me off that they forced us to use our
vacation in order to do this," he said.
Dyrby said that he had expressed his concerns about the required
time off with his office manager, but while she understood his griev
ances, "there really wasn't anything that she could do about it."
Chaudhari didn't bother to complain "because it seemed like a de
cree from on high that wasn't up for discussion," he said. "It certainly
didn't seem as though there would be anyone who'd listen, and I un
derstand that desperate times call for desperate measures."
Susan Hoerger, director of employee and labor relations, said the
University has not received any employee complaints about the closure
and has, in fact, received positive feedback from those who "appreciat
ed having extra time off to spend with their families and friends during
the holidays."
