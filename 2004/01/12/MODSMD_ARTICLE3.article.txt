# Upset in Tucson
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
TUCSON, Ariz. It didn't feel like an upset this time
around.
The still-undefeated No. 4 Stanford men's basketball
team (13-0,4-0 Pacific-10 Conference) made it look a little
too easy in Tucson.
All the talk about Stanford being the most mature and
experienced team in the Pac-10 seemed to become a reality
on Saturday as the Cardinal clearly out-executed, out-de
fended and out-shot an athletic and highly-touted Arizona
team in an 82-72 victory over the No. 3 Wildcats (10-2,2-1)
at McKale Center.
But what's really scary really, really scary for fu
ture Cardinal opponents is how poised Stanford looked
throughout the game.
Simply put, Stanford was just better than Arizona on
Saturday.
Point blank.
No hype necessary.
Undeniably better.
The Cardinal led by as many as 20 points with four min
utes left to play, which if Stanford could have hung on
would have been the Wildcats worst loss in Arizona's head
coach Lute Olson's 21-year tenure in Tucson.
The Cardinal will have to settle for second place in the
record books for now.
Arizona made the loss look "respectable" after fresh
man point guard Mustafa Shakur led a 24-14 run with four
minutes remaining in the game.
Shakur led all scorers with 20 points 14 of which he
scored during the run. The Cardinal's lead diminished con
siderably once Arizona put in a full-court man press and
Stanford went into its spread offense in an attempt to run
down the clock.
