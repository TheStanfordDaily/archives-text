# Upset in Tucson
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
TUCSON, Ariz. It didn't feel like an upset this time
around.
The still-undefeated No. 4 Stanford men's basketball
team (13-0,4-0 Pacific-10 Conference) made it look a little
too easy in Tucson.
All the talk about Stanford being the most mature and
experienced team in the Pac-10 seemed to become a reality
on Saturday as the Cardinal clearly out-executed, out-de
fended and out-shot an athletic and highly-touted Arizona
team in an 82-72 victory over the No. 3 Wildcats (10-2,2-1)
at McKale Center.
But what's really scary really, really scary for fu
ture Cardinal opponents is how poised Stanford looked
throughout the game.
Simply put, Stanford was just better than Arizona on
Saturday.
Point blank.
No hype necessary.
Undeniably better.
The Cardinal led by as many as 20 points with four min
utes left to play, which if Stanford could have hung on
would have been the Wildcats worst loss in Arizona's head
coach Lute Olson's 21-year tenure in Tucson.
The Cardinal will have to settle for second place in the
record books for now.
Arizona made the loss look "respectable" after fresh
man point guard Mustafa Shakur led a 24-14 run with four
minutes remaining in the game.
Shakur led all scorers with 20 points 14 of which he
scored during the run. The Cardinal's lead diminished con
siderably once Arizona put in a full-court man press and
Stanford went into its spread offense in an attempt to run
down the clock.

Hernandez tallied 12 points and 9 assists in Stanford's 82-72 victor/over
Arizona in Tucson, Ariz, on Saturday.
The Wildcats caused six turnovers during the stretch, making the
last-minute run the only hiccup in an otherwise blemish-free outing
by the Cardinal.
"Arizona's too good a team not to make a run at you at some
point," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "The thing
that was most pleasing was that it didn't happen in the first four min
utes [of the second half], because then you have a whole lot more to
play. And when it did happen we were able to counter."
All and all, the game was won and lost during the first half as the
Cardinal took advantage of Arizona's early shooting woes the
Wildcats shot a dismal 19.4 percent from the field managing just
20 points in the opening 20 minutes of play.
That's an average of one point a minute for all you math majors
out there.
"19.4 percent in the first half, that's the only thing you need to
look at," Olson said.
This scoring drought comes from an up-tempo Arizona team that
was leading the Pac-10 in scoring offense with an average of 86.7
points per game before entering the contest.
"We knew that they were a great team in transition," said senior
forward Justin Davis who finished with a double-double (10 points
and 10 boards) despite playing only 18 minutes due to foul trouble.
"We didn't want to get into an up-and-down game with them."
Stanford was successfully able to shutdown Arizona's main scor
ing threats in the first half. Sophomore guard Salim Stoudamire,
who was guarded mostly by junior swingman Josh Childress, went 0-
for-6 from the field, scoring zero points and both Hassan Adams and
Channing Frye combined for only six points in the opening period.
"If you take [Stoudamire] out of the game, you've got four other
guys who have got to pick up the slack," said a frustrated Olson.
Stanford, on the other hand, finished with five players in double
figures. Childress led all Cardinal scorers with 19 points and six
boards, while senior guard Matt Lottich finished with 17 points off
6-of-8 shooting from the field. Lottich along with fellow seniors
Davis and Joe Kirchofer will finish their Stanford careers 4-0 at
McKale.
"Sometimes when you're at home you get caught up in the
crowd," said Lottich of Stanford's success in Tucson. "But when
you're on the road it's just you and your team."
"There are not going to be many teams capable of beating [Stan
ford]," Olson added. "We can't count on anyone else. They are too
experienced, too well-coached."
Basically, if it wasn't already present, the pressure is now there
it's more tangible and less theoretical. And questions about the Car
dinal's ability to win this Pac-10 race have been replaced (perhaps
prematurely) by questions surrounding its ability to put together an
undefeated 2004 campaign.
Regardless, with a long Pac-10 schedule ahead of the Cardinal,
there are still questions surrounding Stanford, although they have
been altered a bit as the season has progressed.
Will Stanford continue to beat the teams that it is "supposed" to
beat?
Or will the Cardinal succomb to lesser Pac-10 foes?
Stay tuned folks because, after all, winning a Pac-10 title can't be
that easy.
Or can it?
