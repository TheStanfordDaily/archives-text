# SIG sponsors meeting with int'l criminal court justice
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
Ten Stanford students will meet the presi
dent and chief justice of the International
Criminal Court, Philippe Kirsh, at an event
today organized by the World Affairs Council
where he will be speaking about the impor
tance of the court.
Stanford in Government Chair Nina Bil
imoria said the students will receive free tickets
to the event due to the relationship that Stan
ford in Government has developed with the
World Affairs Council this year.
The court came into effect in 2003 to deal
with crimes against humanity, genocide and
crimes of war.
According to Melissa Hanham, a program
officer at the council, the Clinton administra
tion was instrumental in passing the treaty to
create the court, but the Bush administration
left it unsigned, along with just six other coun
tries. The treaty was signed by 120 countries.
"The number one argument that people
have against it is that they are afraid the court
will be used as a political vessel to attack the
United States because of anti-American senti
ment," Hanham said. "However, that argu
ment is unfounded. There are many safe

guards in place to prevent that from happen
ing."
Because neither Iraq nor the United States
has signed the treaty, there is no chance that
Saddam Hussein will be tried by the court.
Before the court existed, regional courts
were created to deal with war crimes. Hanham
said that the problem with those courts is that
they were created on an ad hoc basis after the
crimes had been committed.
"The international court would remove
that inefficiency, and it would be a deterrent,"
Hanham said. "The universality of the court is
also important. The more people that sign on,
the stronger the court becomes."
The program tonight is part of Kirsh's cam
paign to educate people in the United States
about the court. Next week he will speak in
Seattle and Washington D.C. The event, which
is sold out, starts at 6 p.m. at the council's head
quarters in San Francisco.
Bilimoria said that this time Stanford stu
dents were offered just 10 seats but that there
won't be the same cap for future events held by
the council.
"We've only had this relationship with the
World Affairs Council for one quarter," Bil
imoria said. "In the future, more students will
have the opportunity to go."
