# Stanford GSB leads pack in female enrollment

Though women make up only a third
of the student body at the Graduate
School of Business, die percentage of fe
male students has risen steadily over the
past decade as the school has upped its
outreach efforts and stands higher than
most of its peer institutions, according to
University officials.
Women constitute 37 percent of the
Business School class 0f2004 and 35 per
cent of the class of 2005, said Associate
Director of MBA Admissions Wendy
Hansen.
"We would love to see more women
in our applicant pool," Hansen said.
According to Hansen, Stanford has
recently pioneered an effort to attract as
diverse a class as possible.
"We are interested in seeing women
pursue management and leadership,

since we have traditionally not seen the
same presence in business school as in
law and medical schools," she said.
According to a recent report by The
New York Times, women have consti
tuted nearly half of the entrants to law
school and medical school in the past
decade, but make up just 30 percent of
the student body at top business schools.
"The traditional view is that it's just
about business and Wall Street,"
Hansen said.
A University of Michigan and Cata
lyst study in 2000 found that women do
not pursue an MBA or career in business
not only because they lack adequate in
formation about business, but also be
cause they lack female role models.
"There are many role models of fe
male doctors and attorneys, but we don't
see as many role models of that in busi
ness," Hansen said.
The Business School offers a tight

knit alumni community and student-run
affiliation groups for women and minori
ties, including the Women in Manage
ment and the Black Business Student
Association.
Anitra Waller, a business student and
the president of Black Business Student
Association President, was drawn to
Stanford's reputation in the Organiza
tional Behavior Department.
After earning a degree in finance
from Baruch College, Waller worked as
an internal auditor with Procter & Gam
ble. Two years later, she decided to take
a chance and apply to business school.
"I felt that an MBA would give me a
basic foundation in the different areas of
management so that I'd be able to
change careers," Waller said. "I knew
that B-school would give me the analyti
cal and creative thinking skills to help me
deal with the variety of problems in a
business environment."

Hansen believes that, in general, the
overall quality and reputation of Stan
ford's MBA program can lead to career
enhancement and flexibility.
"It's important to not only look at the
experience for two years, but also how
that is going to benefit you for a lifetime,"
she said.
In 1971, the Business School began
offering the option for MBA students to
receive a public management certificate,
which about 25 percent of the past two
graduating classes at the Business School
have received.
That program influenced Stephanie
Soler, president of the Women in Man
agement organization, to choose Stan
ford. Soler attained her bachelor's de
gree in American Studies from Stanford,
and decided to pursue an MBA because
"I felt like my career had plateaued, and
