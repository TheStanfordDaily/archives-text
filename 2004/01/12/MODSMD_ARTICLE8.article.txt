## Monkey business 
### NICOLE WRIGHT 
It's quiet, no one's talking, and I need more information. So I pull a Nancy
Drew —make that a Liu Hulan, the Chinese female detective from the Lisa See
thrillers—and sidle into the nearest room. Two tanned little boys with spiky black
crew cuts peer at me from their position on the sofa, and then turn back to their
video game.
I came to EAST House to get the facts about the residents' upcoming celebra
tion of East Asian culture, EAST Fest, which will coincide with the Chinese lunar
new year, the year of the monkey, but it's been hard to find any EAST-dwellers
willing to go on the record. A guy with a heavy Eastern European accent vehe
mently shakes his head when asked if he knows anything, and when I catch a girl
in the open kitchen with her hand in a cookie jar, she all but flees. Lui Hulan can't
have it much worse tracking quarries through the gloomy caves along the edge of
the Yangtze River.
So here I am in the lounge of the East Asian theme dorm, working my way
through some hefty photo albums to ferret out the waaaay-back-in-the-80's origins
of EAST Fest. It's not what I expected: There are pics of guys cross-dressing,
feigned marriage, feigned pregnancy and what looks like feigned imminent
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. A panoramic shot of a girl's gams and a close-up of
her feet. Okay. Two kimonoed ingenues beam beneath a cheesecake poster of a

Chippendale wearing nothing but a scowl and a towel. But when it comes to
anything remotely resembling a good old traditional East Asian celebration,
no dice.
Ever hopeful, however, I forge ahead. Finally, I come to a photo of a guy
cuddled up with a cute little Playmate (the cooler, not Pam Anderson before
she made it big). Nude except for a tiny pair of boxers and some gargantuan
"Miami Vice" shades, he is hoisting a beer stein in one hand and a copy of Vic
tor Fuchs' "How We Live" in the other. He is basking in the light of an over
head desk lamp, and his admirable legs are resting atop his desk. There aren't
that many books in his bookshelf, but there is a huge bottle of wine.
What is striking is that these snapshots are 50... American. Why are these
the ones preserved for posterity? Why are the EAST photo albums filled al
most entirely with portraits like this one, with virtually no photos of students
engaging in cultural theme activities? Someone could flip through the entire
ty of these albums without knowing that EAST is a cultural theme house. On
the other hand, why would anyone expect otherwise? It would be unreason
able to expect EAST to be all culture, all the time.
As residents of the house begin to open up to me, they tell me quite a bit
about how the new year will be celebrated, and about Asian traditions in gen
eral. But I also learn that several non-Asian residents feel disconnected from
the dorm theme activities. Also, as problem sets and textbooks beckon, stu
dents eschew devoting significant amounts of time to learning about East
Asian culture. Perhaps these are some reasons why tradition inevitably gives
way to contemporary culture, even in a house dedicated to preserving that
culture.
As I rise to leave, one little boy zips forward and adjusts the sound on the
monolith-screen TV, pumping up the volume of some generic American
garage bandits' yowls. On the shelves nearby, Asian history books gather
dust. I run my fingers across the tops of the books, like a fastidious house
keeper, and my fingertips are coated with white powder.
As I amble up the stone walkway to EAST House under a towering grove
of eucalyptus trees, I think to myself that the residence's decorative theme this
year, "EAST of Eden," is apropos. Surrounded by an expanse of verdant
lawn and bathed in the gentle late-afternoon sunlight, the name seems fitting.
I lived here last year, and enjoyed it. It was here that I developed a yen, if you'll
excuse the pun, for Japanese mayonnaise, Mi Goreng (scrumptious Indone
sian ramen) and J-pop, among other things. It was here that I attended "Spir
ited Away" outings and learned more about Chinese opera, and about the id
ioms of the Japanese language in which my grandfather was fluent. When stu
dents asked me for Draw recommendations last year, I recommended EAST
House.
On a hunch, I nudge open the kitchen door and happen upon the chef,
known to many by the monomoniker "Sean," ala Fabio or Cher. "Hi!" I call,
rushing up to him. "Hi!" he shouts, rushing up to me. We hug.
"I have at least 360 recipes from around the world. I'm trying to write a
cookbook," Sean says, "but it's difficult. I need people to help me." He grins
cheekily at me.
For many people our age, knowledge of other cultures begins in the
kitchen, so to speak (as attested to by the popularity of films such as "Like
Water for Chocolate," "Big Night" and "Eat Drink Man Woman.") So, I
think, why not start there?
As usual, Sean is duded up in immaculate chefs whites. He gently shifts
aside a sizzling tray of what looks like tempura vegetables so we can talk. All
of a sudden, I feel hungry. "My personality is wanting people to share their
different cultures," is his immediate answer to my question about his role in
the house. "It's all about sharing different cultures and different f00d... This
house gives me a lot of opportunity to do [that]. It's not just Asian food —it's
different backgrounds."
Sean says that his job "is more than cooking—it's sharing different cultures

and food with the residents. It's very challenging." He smiles. "I know I've made a
good dish if you say, "That's [just like] what my mom makes at home.'"
The job of a theme house chef, however, also involves beckoning students
out of their culinary comfort zone. "The Japanese eat raw fish in sushi and
[some people] are like, 'Oh my god, it's so gross.' It's not gross, it's their culture.
I was born in Cambodia but grew up in Thailand. In my culture, we eat raw
beef." Sean adds that he finds inspiration from non-Asian cultures, too: "I learn
a lot from American culture. I'm really getting into Southern food-I just got
back from New Orleans." (A personal note: I can tell you that Sean's fried
chicken is the real deal.)
Sean says that, by and large, the residents have no problem with trying some
thing new. "Mostly I get good feedback-'lt's different but it's good'—and that's
what I want to accomplish."
As I leave the kitchen, I mull over his words: "It's different but it's good:" stu
dents of all backgrounds learning to appreciate the unknown. This is the ideal of
the theme house concept.
But is it reality? After all, the Steinbeck novel "East of Eden" (from which the
EAST staff plucked this year's theme) is a tale of conflict. As I begin chatting up
the residents, there are signs of trouble in paradise. When I speak to people I knew
last year, they are gracious but guarded. Some decline to answer even innocuous
questions about house life, such as "What committee are you on for EAST Fest?"
Several students admit that they have not done much legwork for the committees
yet; perhaps this, the sense that they have not been as involved in East Asian cul
ture as much as they think they should be, is why they demur from answering my
questions. If I had a dollar for each time someone asked me to keep something "off
the record," I'd have enough dough to dig in at Miyake's.
One resident who is sure of her role in the upcoming festivities is junior Erica
Li. "I'm making desserts," says the veteran EASTer, who also lived in the house
last year. "Probably boiled taro, so people know it's not just a pearl milk tea flavor."
Here I should probably let you know that Li is cool and spunky, the kind of girl who
shows up for a Fleet Street show in a tux instead of a tube top. She says that she
hopes her choir group will perform the "Masochism Tango" as part of EAST Fest.
When I inquire about die dorm atmosphere this year, Li says, "It's not what I
expected. There are some pretty 'downtown' Asian people here." When I look
askance at the unfamiliar term, she clarifies that this refers to "people who are re
ally, in their essence, in reality, Asian."
"I have a duty. I think it involves decorating," says senior Frank Chen, smiling
sheepishly. Of life at EAST, he says, "It's very close-knit community. There's just
a sense of community."

Frank is happy with his luck of the draw, but I also hear from less-satisfied res
idents. Here's a sampling:
An Asian-American EASTer says that the dorm environment has gotten better,
but qualifies this by saying, "I'm not sure I can talk about that without hurting peo
ple's feelings."
"I'm not involved in this dorm," says one white student, scratching his head un
comfortably.
As for cookie-jar girl: "Um, I'm really not the right person to ask about EAST
Fest... I don't really feel connected in this dorm," she says. "I mean, I live here,
but I don't do anything here."
Yet another white student erupts in chuckles when I ask about EAST Fest ac
tivities. "I'm not the best person to ask," the student says, practically doubling over
with laughter. As way of explanation, the student tells me about what went down
when she entered house meeting the night before, holding a piece of paper. The
RA looked at it and asked the student whether she wanted to make an outside an
nouncement. Although the student has been living in the 60-student house since
September, the RA had no idea who she was. "I was like, 'I live here!'" the student
says. "So you see, it's not my community."
The EAST resident fellows, who took over this year from another pair of fel-

lows who had been at the house for awhile, are trying to instill a sense of commu
nity, says RF Cheena Murphy-Shigematsu, who exudes a calm, kindly aura. "I
know some foreign students here and they might be homesick and have no place
to go during the vacation. So I try to make it a home for them."
Murphy-Shigematsu says she attempts to make all students feel comfortable in
their residence. "I like to respect their culture. In this dorm it [came] naturally.
Many different backgrounds-Japanese-American, maybe only two, Chinese-
American, Korean, second-generation [Asian-Americans]."
Of EAST Fest in particular, "I'm not involved so much," Murphy-Shigematsu
says. But she does have a hand in cultivating the dorm environment. "I enjoy being
with students, and my students are... interested in Japanese culture, and I'm from
Japan. Every Thursday we have a language table. It's nice to speak Japanese with
students."
How exactly does Murphy-Shigematsu try to make EAST feel like home?
"Through the kids," she responds immediately. "I have two little boys, and they
enjoy being with students. I have a family, so I like to make students comfortable
with my kids [so they can] see different-age children." As if on cue, one of the little
boys I saw in the lounge pops up under her arm. He widens his eyes at me and runs
away.
On a tip, I visit the Governor's Corner office, where Student Affairs Specialist
Sharon Wong presides, to view her collection of EAST Fest posters, which date
back to 1992. Wong says that she enjoys attending the celebration. One time, she
remembers, the festivities were held in a large hall, and she wondered how the stu
dents would attract enough visitors. On entering the lobby, Wong recalls, "I was
shocked. It was full." That year, Wong says, "I remember they had
a snacks in the lobby and performances inside," but a couple years later, atten
dance tapered off and EAST Fest was moved to smaller facilities. Nevertheless,
Wong says that area residents attend the annual festival. "I think a lot of people ex
pect this and look forward to it."
Jan. 22,2004 will be the first day of the Year of the Monkey.
By the Chinese calendar, this is the year 4701.
On a breezy Thursday afternoon at Moonbeams, I rendezvous with senior
Yvonne Chen, Academic Theme Associate for EAST House, at Moonbeams.
When I first pass, she's not there. When I pass by once more, she is settled in a cafe
seat, reading quietly. Chen is articulate, with a friendly, gentle manner to boot, and
since, last I heard, she is a triple major in Chemical Engineering, East Asian Stud
ies and Classics, EAST Fest should be in capable hands. "In the past, EAST Fest

had a more academic focus. Now, some of the residents are Asian to begin with, so
they probably have a better idea of East Asian culture," she says. Even novices are
involved in planning the festivities, though, Chen tells me: "Every resident of
EAST house is part of a committee for EAST Fest."
Chen says that it's been a good year for EAST Fest funding. "CEAS [the Cen
ter for East Asian Studies] always provides us with a certain amount of funding,
and we also got a lot of funding from ResEd this year. In the past, we got residents
to go to different dorms to ask for funds, but fortunately we didn't have to do that
this year."
For Chen, the lunar new year around which EAST Fest is geared this year is the
source of many pleasant memories. "I grew up in Taiwan, and there, Chinese New
Year is the biggest holiday by far-traditionally it's the time when everyone gets to
gether. There are all sorts of rituals-all sorts of foods for dinner." In China, Chen
says, the newyear brings with it several quirky customs. For example: "You should
never finish your fish." The characters for "fish" and "extra" are the same, Chen
says, and "you always want to have wealth and resources left over for next year."
"In the past, EAST Fest hasn't been as well-publicized as I would like it to be,"
says Chen. "In the 80s, there were not as many talks" about East Asian culture on
campus. EAST filled the vacuum by providing a two-week long speaker series
through EAST Fest. Now, Chen says, "Stanford as a whole has changed a lot" in
terms of providing venues for exploration and analysis of East Asian culture. Due

to the events offered by CEAS, ethnic community centers and language pro
grams, such as the regular Brown Bag Lunches, Chen said, the speaker series of
fered at EAST Fest is not the only way for the Stanford community to learn
more about East Asian culture, but more of "a way to become introduced to it."
"I don't want to seem like I'm dumbing [EAST Fest] down," Chen says, "but
now it's a cultural experience rather than heavy academic lecturing." This year's
performances, for example, are scheduled for the afternoon, when more stu
dents can attend, rather than in the evening.
"I've [had] a lot of help from my residents in planning EAST Fest in general
some of them are from East Asia. But a lot of them are not really exposed to East
Asian culture," Chen says. "I don't know if enlightening is a too-heavy word for
this, but that's what I'm trying to do."
Senior Karen Wang, an EAST House resident this year and last, attended a
couple of the in-house lectures last year. "I thought it was interesting because I
wouldn't have gone to those lectures otherwise," she said.
Her roommate, senior Elizabeth Yin, said that she and Karen have been work
ing on the publicity team, and that they just recently finalized this year's flyer.
She said that the academic bustle of Stanford life can make it difficult to find time
to attend other campus events and lectures focused on East Asian culture. "I
think it's a unique experience to have these opportunities at college, but for a lot
of students, it's a matter of time," she said.
No, the EAST house RA is not Asian. Or Asian-American. So people keep
telling me before I finally meet the sole Resident Assistant at EAST House, se
nior Wael Salloum, in the flesh. In fact, Salloum says, he had not even set foot in
EAST House before last year, when he was deciding on which house he wanted
to serve as an RA. Salloum tells me that he applied for an RA spot at only two
places, including EAST House. "I picked it because I didn't know much about
East Asian culture at all, but my draw group was Asian, and they introduced me
to it," he says.
Salloum's clothes are neatly pressed. As we sit down to talk, I note his close
cropped crew cut and well-groomed facial hair. His metallic necklace gleams as
he settles into a light wooden chair in the fading late-afternoon light of die EAST
House dining room. He is the type of person who immediately sets others at
ease, and I can tell why he was chosen as an RA.
"A lot of residents ask me about my culture-I'm half-Lebanese and half-Pales
tinian," says Salloum. "As I'm an RA, there are no flags up in my room. There
used to be Palestinian, Lebanese, and American flags in my room-there are
none now."
He continues, "I would not want to be on one side or the other. In the past, in
conversations between Palestinians and others, I have been caught and the mid
dle and have had to serve as the mediator. I don't want to be in that position."
Nowadays, Salloum says, he avoids hot-button issues and sticks to less contro
versial topics such as "Palestinian food, dress, culture."
When I allude to the challenge of making residents feel comfortable and in
cluded, he says, "In any house, those without priority will feel left out. No more
than half the staff is Asian. The staff is meant to be diverse. If you have a staff
that's purely Asian, that would be a bad thing."
Salloum says that the planning of EAST Fest is Chen's domain. "I'm involved
in planning it. I get residents involved, and I head up a committee for EAST Fest.
[But] Yvonne is in charge of EAST Fest, so I don't make any decisions." Salloum
says that he did approve of the direction EAST Fest was taking under Chen's
watch. "We felt that EAST Fest needed to be more fun. Now it's [going to be] a
lotmore relaxed. The only concern we have is whetherpeople [will] go to the lec
tures."
As for theme events, Salloum says, "Last quarter we've had almost an event a
day for the last three weeks, it's calmed down now." With a grin, he says that
more informal events have included dining lessons: "I learned to use chopsticks-
I learned Chinese grip, Japanese grip, etc."
Overall, however, Salloum says, "I'm not learning about Asian culture [so

much] as Asian-American culture."
In many ways, Salloum's words essentialize the EAST experience, and, indeed,
any contemporary theme dorm experience. Even at a place like EAST, students
cannot completely immerse themselves in any one culture. Could this be a good
thing, since people cannot isolate themselves in one particular culture at the ex
pense of learning about the great diversity that's at their fingertips in a place like
Stanford? This is what I wonder as I wander down the halls and out the door, past
the all-in-English signs on the entryway walls, past the demure buds blooming on
the residents' door nameplates
