## Class presidents need to update seniors 
### 
Over the course
of the past week, Shayna Fernandez
one of the four Senior Class Presi-

dents elected
last spring by the Class of
'O4 has been deleted
from the signature line of
the Senior Class Presi
dents' e-mail account. No
official announcement
has been made about the
status of Fernandez, and
the remaining three pres
idents have yet to spell
out a plan to fill the void
left by her resignation.
The Senior Class has a
right to know why one of
its elected leaders has
stepped down from her
post. The Senior Class
has a right to know how

the remaining three plan to accommodate for her
absence. And the Senior Class has a right to know
this information in a timely and accurate fashion.
The Senior Class Presidents have failed to keep
their constituents informed about the status of
their leadership, and we hope that a full explana
tion will be forthcoming.
This editorial board attempted to contact the
Senior Class Presidents yesterday evening, but
the public officials who are supposed to be ac
countable to their constituents provided eva
sive answers to the most basic questions about
Fernandez's resignation. Beyond "personal rea
sons" not related to health or family, no one was
ready to flesh out the rationale for her resigna-

tion, and the administration's plans to fill in her
vacancy was elucidated only in the vaguest terms.
This is unacceptable.

We do not need or want
to know the intimate de
tails of -why Fernandez re
signed. But some sort of
announcement to the Se
nior Class should have
been made. To keep the
1,600-some students who
depend on these four lead
ers in the dark about these
developments is negligent
of the Senior Class Presi
dents.
While the three re
maining presidents plan to
divide up Fernandez's
workload for the remain
der of winter quarter, at
which time Fernandez will

officially resign, this ill-conceived "action plan"
does not reassure those seniors who have been let
down by their leaders. Leadership requires re
sponsibility. It requires commitment. Neither
Fernandez nor her colleagues have demonstrated
these qualities in their recent actions.
The Senior Class Presidents let their con
stituents down last week. We hope that today,
they will begin to repair the damage they have
done. The Senior Class needs to be reassured that
its leadership is responsive to its constituents. If
the administration doesn't become more ac
countable and less of an elitist club soon,
some seniors may permanently lose faith in their
leaders.

" Leadership requires
responsibility. It requires
commitment. Neither
Fernandez nor her
colleagues have demon
strated these qualities in
their recent actions."
