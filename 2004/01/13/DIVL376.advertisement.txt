LUCIA JOYCE:
To DANCE IN THE WAKE
BY CAROL LOEB SHLOSS
Tuesday, January 13, 2004
12:00PM • Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
The author of this ground
breaking new study of the
life of Lucia Joyce (1907-
1982), the daughter of
James Joyce, shares an
artistic sensibility with her
subject that gives her a spe
cial insight for viewing
Lucia's life. Shloss's assidu
ous research has turned up
numerous facts about
Lucia's medical and
psychiatric history that
contradict what other
biographers have said; she
takes issue with Richard
Ellmann, Jane Lidderdale
and Brenda Maddox for
accepting versions of
Lucia's life from unreliable
sources. Because it is so
astutely reasoned, howev
er, it will surely stand as a
vivid testament to Lucia's
talents as a creative artist,
as well as a corrective to
the ways that the facts of
herlife have been hidden
and distorted by earlier
Joyce scholars.
