# Popular administrator to leave after 23 years
## Associate Director of UAC leaves big shoes to fill both in advising and African American communities 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Diann McCants,
associate director of
peer and academic
support at the Un
dergraduate Advis
ing Center, has an
nounced that she
will be leaving Stan
ford at the end of the
year.
McCants came to
Stanford in 1981 as a
graduate student in
the Psychology De
partment and has
since served as asso
ciate director of the
African and Afro-
American Studies

Program, resident fellow of Ujamaa
House from 1995 to 2001 and profes

sor for Introduction to African and
Afro-American Studies.
According to her colleagues and
students, McCants's many diverse
positions provided her with a unique
blend of experiences.
Aisha Lowe, who was first ac
quainted with McCants as a fresh
man during McCants' first year as a
resident fellow in Ujamaa in 1995,
described McCants as a role model

and parent figure.
"Diann was a
helper across the
board," Lowe said.
"It is her nature and
character to always
extend a helping
hand. In every role
she had kindness and
consideration that
isn't always there."
Lowe pointed out
that McCants was a
leader to numerous
individuals, especial
ly those in Stanford's
African American
community.
"Her length of


Diann McCants
time and many diverse experiences
gave her a full understanding of what
it means to be black at Stanford,"
Lowe said. "She was able to experi
ence all her roles on campus from a
role as an African American."
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford,
director of the Program in African
and Afro-American Studies, was
first associated with McCants five or
six years ago when they were both
starting their positions in the pro
gram. He pointed out that McCants
is one of a few "very valuable" black
administrators and staff members to
leave in the last couple years.
Director of Advising Lori White
hired McCants to serve as associate
director for peer and academic sup
port. White first met McCants when

White was completing her doctoral
degree at Stanford in the School of
Education and needed McCants' as
sistance with statistical analysis for
her dissertation.
"It is always tough for a university
to lose an African American staff
member, particularly one such as
Diann," White said. "She has been
visible in such diverse arenas the
classroom, the residence halls and
University administration and
has made such an impact on the cam
pus through her availability to any
student who needed someone with
whom to talk, as well as her research
interests in the area of student suc
cess, the courses she taught in psy
chology and African American stud
ies and her presence as a role model."
White said that as an associate di
rector of peer and academic support,
McCants enhanced the training and
support provided to students partici

pating as peer staff because her many
contacts on campus helped diversify
the students who applied to be peer
advisers and peer tutors.
White also mentioned that Mc-
Cants was a "fabulous teacher who
inspired a number of African Amer
ican students to major in psychology
and / or related fields such as African
and African American studies and /
or stimulated an interest in research
on African American issues."
McCants came to Stanford as a
graduate student 23 years ago with
the goal of helping to lead to a better
understanding the needs and prob
lems of certain underrepresented
groups, according to a speech by Psy
chology Prof. Ewart Thomas, master
of ceremonies at McCants' farewell
function.
"She has certainly achieved her
stated goal of helping us at Stanford
to understand the needs and prob

lems of underrepresented groups,
and for that we are eternally grate
ful," Thomas said.
Despite McCants' departure,
Rickford is still optimistic about the
future of the African American com
munity at Stanford.
He acknowledged that individu
als have done a good job in McCants'
absence in her program, as she grad
ually relinquished her teaching du
ties at Stanford.
"McCants' leaving Stanford is
ameliorated by the fact that she had
stopped being a resident scholar a
few years ago," Rickford said. "It
was a gradual withdrawal rather than
a sudden pull-out, and a few people
have stepped up to the plate to fill her
shoes."
After this year, McCants will
move to the Washington, D.C. area
with her children, to join her hus
band, who has a new job there.
