### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
While Christmas shopping at
Wal-Mart this winter vaca
tion, I suddenly stumbled
upon an insight for my inau
gural column for The Daily this quarter.
Having stuffed my shopping cart with food,
clothing and electronic gadgets, I arrived at
one end of the shopping mall. Walking to
ward the other end, I searched for the
check-out counter with the smallest num
ber of customers in line (obviously, one
should consider the number of check-out
items rather than the number of people in
queue. For the purpose of illustration, how
ever, let's assume we want to minimize the
latter.)
After passing by a few lanes, I thought to
myself: suppose I keep walking. For every
single counter I arrive at, I can make the de
cision whether to stop at the end of the line
there and wait, or to abandon that counter,
hoping to find another one with fewer cus
tomers in line. Assuming that I'm not al

lowed to go back to any counter that I've
previously passed by and that without
glasses, I cannot see the number of cus
tomers in the lanes that I haven't passed by
yet, how should I make my decision so that
I can most likely check-out at a counter
with the fewest customers in line? Let's as
sume further that the number of customers
in line is static, meaning that they don't
change as I walk from one end of the mall
to the other.
Obviously, it doesn't seem wise to start
queuing at the very first lane that I en
counter because I'm forgoing the opportu
nity to see the rest of the lanes in the mall
and therefore possibly missing out on lanes
that have only one or two customers. On
the other hand, it's probably a bad idea to
be overly cautious and wait until I almost
reach the other end of the mall before mak
ing a final decision. In this scenario, my
choices will be extremely limited since I
cannot turn around: Henceforth, the prob
lem boils down to the following: When I
reach a lane, after examining the number of
customers in line, should I join them in

waiting or leave them for a possibly more
time-saving lane? By doing the former, I'm
at the risk of forgoing possibly better lanes;
by doing the latter, I'm at the risk of aban
doning the best lane that I will ever see.
Readers familiar with my column last
quarter might start questioning how this ar
ticle is in any way related to my usual topic
of dating and marriage after all, my col
umn is titled "I Got Game [Theory]." Well,
here it comes.
Finding the right partner is like walking
past an array of counters. The quality of
each potential mate you pass by corre
sponds to the "quality" of each lane, char
acterized by the number of customers wait
ing in that lane. The restriction that you are
not allowed to turn around more or less
corresponds to the fact that after parting
with someone, it will be very hard to date
that person.
So adapting some preliminary conclu
sions on counter-selection that we arrived
at to dating, we can see that it's probably
unwise to jump on the first dating opportu
nity and be really serious about it. On the

other hand, nor is it a good idea to wait until
you are 50 before you start making your de
cisions on dating.
Both of these problems, counter-selec
tion and mate-selection, can be abstracted
as variations of a one-pass search through
an array for its maximum element. There
are many other real-life examples that fit
this model. For instance, consider the case
when you try to find parking space in a
long, narrow parking lot situated by a
restaurant, your destination.
On the one hand, you want to park as
close to the restaurant as possible; but on
the other hand, if you keep forgoing empty
spaces until you are too close to the restau
rant, you might be out of luck. Solutions to
such problems require a probabilistic un
derstanding of the situation specifically,
we would need to model the payoffs of dif
ferent actions taken. Stay tuned for some
real mathematics next week.

waiting or leave them for a possibly more
time-saving lane? By doing the former, I'm
at the risk of forgoing possibly better lanes;
by doing the latter, I'm at the risk of aban
doning the best lane that I will ever see.
Readers familiar with my column last
quarter might start questioning how this ar
ticle is in any way related to my usual topic
of dating and marriage after all, my col
umn is titled "I Got Game [Theory]." Well,
here it comes.
Finding the right partner is like walking
past an array of counters. The quality of
each potential mate you pass by corre
sponds to the "quality" of each lane, char
acterized by the number of customers wait
ing in that lane. The restriction that you are
not allowed to turn around more or less
corresponds to the fact that after parting
with someone, it will be very hard to date
that person.
So adapting some preliminary conclu
sions on counter-selection that we arrived
at to dating, we can see that it's probably
unwise to jump on the first dating opportu
nity and be really serious about it. On the

other hand, nor is it a good idea to wait until
you are 50 before you start making your de
cisions on dating.
Both of these problems, counter-selec
tion and mate-selection, can be abstracted
as variations of a one-pass search through
an array for its maximum element. There
are many other real-life examples that fit
this model. For instance, consider the case
when you try to find parking space in a
long, narrow parking lot situated by a
restaurant, your destination.
On the one hand, you want to park as
close to the restaurant as possible; but on
the other hand, if you keep forgoing empty
spaces until you are too close to the restau
rant, you might be out of luck. Solutions to
such problems require a probabilistic un
derstanding of the situation specifically,
we would need to model the payoffs of dif
ferent actions taken. Stay tuned for some
real mathematics next week.
