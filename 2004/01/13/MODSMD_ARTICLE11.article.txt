## The 						Stanford Daily Editorials Illegal immigrants deserve help 
### 
California is home to more illegal im
migrants than any other state ac
cording to a 2000 Immigration and
Naturalization Service report
about 2.2 million out of an estimated seven
million nationwide. Some of these immi
grants perform crucial tasks: They wash
dishes, serve food and clean offices. And
now, thanks to an effort supported by Presi
dent George W. Bush, they may have an op
portunity to drop their illegal status and be
come "guest workers." We applaud the pres
ident for his efforts to legitimize and recog
nize the hard work done by illegal immi
grants, and we hope more changes are forth
coming.
Under the guest-worker program, cur
rent-illegal immigrants would be allowed to
stay in the United States for three years, with
the possibility of extensions. While granting
temporary visas to all of the country's illegal
immigrants estimated by some groups to
be as many as double the INS estimate of
seven million would be an overwhelming
job for the Homeland Security Department,
the importance of this plan as a first step to
ward getting the U.S. immigration system in
order cannot be overstated.
We agree with advocates of the proposal
who say it will allow workers to get fair
wages and access to services in the United

States, including health care and insurance.
These workers deserve the respect of their
employers and fellow employees, and they
should have the same right to benefits that
come with legitimately holding a job.
Moreover, if Congress passes Bush's pro
posal for the guest-worker program (a tricky
proposition in itself), then California Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger's push to repeal a
measure granting driver's licenses to illegal
immigrants, which has been characterized by
some politicians as racist, will become moot.
By getting temporary visas, immigrants
would then have access to driver's licenses
and auto insurance, which is a win-win situa
tion for everyone who drives.
While immigration into the United States
remains an issue that draws much anger and
heated opinion on both sides of the aisle,
Bush's proposal gets the messy topic onto
the table for further discussion. It is yet to be
resolved how many of these guest workers
would eventually obtain permanent legal
status, and questions have been raised about
how this program might facilitate terrorism.
But the fact remains that giving illegal immi
grants some sort of legal status is not only the
best move toward self-sufficiency and fair
treatment, but we believe it is also the best
route to forming a comprehensive and effec
tive immigration policy.
