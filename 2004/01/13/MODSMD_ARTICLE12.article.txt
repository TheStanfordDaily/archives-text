# Whooping it up for Card hoops
## 
### 
Last Saturday, the men's basketball
team upheld their perfect season and
notched a victory against No. 3 Ari
zona. The Cardinal's win dropped
Arizona to No. 7 in the Associated Press
coaches' poll, and Stanford took one step
closer to the top position. The team now
stands at No. 3 going into this Saturday's
game against Cal. We commend the team's
players for their newfound success, which
comes as a relief following this fall's football
season. The Stanford community was waiting
for a team around which it could rally, and the

men's basketball team has provided just that.
The team played against Washington State
in its first Pac-10 game on Jan. 2 after taking
down then-No. 1 Kansas and then-No. 1*
Gonzaga earlier in the season. The Cardinal
took Washington State to the boards and
nailed a 73-51 win, beginning the team's
dominance within the conference.
The Cardinal now holds a 13-0 record and
is heading the Pac-10. Students have been
showing up in droves at Stanford's home
games. The team should be congratulated on
their season thus far.
