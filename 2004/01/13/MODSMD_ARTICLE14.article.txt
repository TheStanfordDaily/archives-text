# WELCOME TO WALLACE WORLD
## Fighting terror is a digital affair 
### 
Above the Golden Gate
Bridge, facing out into the
San Francisco Bay, stand
the turrets and hollow gun
casings of an abandoned military
outpost - recently abandoned.
It seems antiquated in our ultra
modern world of cyber terrorism
and surgical bombing, but just half a
century ago, during the Korean War
and World War 11, soldiers stood at
the ready with guns facing east, just
in case our enemies tried to walk
through the front door and damage
the critical port of San Francisco.
The crumbling, overgrown mili
tary bases in the hills above the city,
with the look and feel of bad govern
ment construction, are some of the
last remnants of the old ways of de
fense. The soldiers that once would
man the guns of such posts, finger at
the trigger, are now wanning desk
chairs, fingers poised over keyboards,
patrolling cyber space for trouble.
Trouble doesn't walk in the front
door anymore. In fact, trouble doesn't
have an address either. Knowing U.S.
soldiers were being trained in cyber
warfare, and so, last year I filed a Free
dom of Information Act request for
all of the investigations closed in 2002
with one of the cyber intelligence
agencies of the U.S. military. My mis
sion: to find out what was happening
in this war we never hear about.
I received truckloads of docu
ments - most of them almost black
with heavy and nervous redacting.
While the agency filled my request,
they called me numerous times for
me to explain exactly what I wanted
with the information. It seems the
government would prefer if no one
knew about this work, neither the
enemy nor Joe Six-pack American.
Truthfully, I can't understand
most of the reports, and all of the
good cases with international hack
ers were sent on to the CIA. So, I
didn't get the full scoop, but I still
caught a glimpse of the new virtual
battlefield where many of our active
duty soldiers - big guys in camou

flage with side arms - are fighting an
enemy they can only detect matrix
like through a sea of computer code.
The shot across the bow is what
the agency people call a "knock."

Soldiers patrol
our computer sys
tems of greatest
national security;
when an intruder
attempts entry
into the system,
they first "knock"
on the outer fire
walls. Most of
these knocks are
detected and then
a soldier tries to

follow the would-be intruder
through a maze of headers and code.
Sites like the Department of Defense
receive thousands of "knocks" a day.
Some of the "knocks" are not de
tected until the intruder has slipped in
side the system and is only discovered
because information is taken out of
the site. Operation Moonlight Maze
was the hunt a few years back for the
Russian hacker who took untold
streams of data out of the Pentagon
system before he was detected and
shut out. Our intelligence believes this
was a Russian government-sanc
tioned activity - and Russia is an ally.
At this point, it's unclear - the
government isn't talking, and my
stacks of documents only speak for
one of many cyber-intelligence
agencies - just how many of these
"knocks" are from organized terror
groups, nation states - both friend
and foe - or free agent hackers trying
to stir up chaos. But what is clear is
that despite the thick firewalls and
the forces on duty protecting our
systems, it wouldn't be hard for a
good hacker could put the hurt on.
Consider operation "Eligible Re
ceiver," a Pentagon project to gauge
the thickness of our virtual fortress.
Back in 1998, the Department of
Defense planned a war game, com
missioning 35 government hackers
to try and take down the country.

Reports of this operation vary wild
ly, from a complete cover-up and de
nial to the description "electronic
Pearl Harbor."
Pentagon official John Hamre
went on record saying: "A year ago,
concerned for this, the department
undertook the first systematic exer
cise to determine the nation's vul
nerability and the department's vul
nerability to cyber war. And it was
startling, frankly. We got about 30,
35 folks who became the attackers,
the red team ... We didn't really let
them take down the power system
in the country, but we made them
prove that they knew how to do it."
The Washington Post reported,
"Many details of the exercise,
dubbed Eligible Receiver, remain
closely held. But according to offi
cial sources, a group of 35 NSA spe
cialists simulated a series of rolling
power outages and 911 emergency
phone overloads in Washington and
a handful of other cities. They
showed that large-scale blackouts
could be caused by targeting com
puterized sensing and control de
vices known as Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition systems,
which have become common substi
tutes for human monitors in operat
ing electrical, oil, gas, transportation
and water treatment systems."
What all of this means to me is that
we are moving toward the time when
wars won't be fought with mortars
and rounds; when battle guns will be
as antiquated as the crumbling out
posts along the Pacific; when comput
er geeks will be our sentinels. So if
you think a pop-up ad is the most peril
you could encounter online, think of
the soldiers typing long hours, chas
ing evil with an IT degree and a
modem. In our no-borders, no city
walls world we enjoy, we still employ
soldiers at the watchtowers.

At this point, it's unclear - the
government isn't talking, and my
stacks of documents only speak for
one of many cyber-intelligence
agencies - just how many of these
"knocks" are from organized terror
groups, nation states - both friend
and foe - or free agent hackers trying
to stir up chaos. But what is clear is
that despite the thick firewalls and
the forces on duty protecting our
systems, it wouldn't be hard for a
good hacker could put the hurt on.
Consider operation "Eligible Re
ceiver," a Pentagon project to gauge
the thickness of our virtual fortress.
Back in 1998, the Department of
Defense planned a war game, com
missioning 35 government hackers
to try and take down the country.

Reports of this operation vary wild
ly, from a complete cover-up and de
nial to the description "electronic
Pearl Harbor."
Pentagon official John Hamre
went on record saying: "A year ago,
concerned for this, the department
undertook the first systematic exer
cise to determine the nation's vul
nerability and the department's vul
nerability to cyber war. And it was
startling, frankly. We got about 30,
35 folks who became the attackers,
the red team ... We didn't really let
them take down the power system
in the country, but we made them
prove that they knew how to do it."
The Washington Post reported,
"Many details of the exercise,
dubbed Eligible Receiver, remain
closely held. But according to offi
cial sources, a group of 35 NSA spe
cialists simulated a series of rolling
power outages and 911 emergency
phone overloads in Washington and
a handful of other cities. They
showed that large-scale blackouts
could be caused by targeting com
puterized sensing and control de
vices known as Supervisory Control
and Data Acquisition systems,
which have become common substi
tutes for human monitors in operat
ing electrical, oil, gas, transportation
and water treatment systems."
What all of this means to me is that
we are moving toward the time when
wars won't be fought with mortars
and rounds; when battle guns will be
as antiquated as the crumbling out
posts along the Pacific; when comput
er geeks will be our sentinels. So if
you think a pop-up ad is the most peril
you could encounter online, think of
the soldiers typing long hours, chas
ing evil with an IT degree and a
modem. In our no-borders, no city
walls world we enjoy, we still employ
soldiers at the watchtowers.

Above the Golden Gate
Bridge, facing out into the
San Francisco Bay, stand
the turrets and hollow gun
casings of an abandoned military
outpost - recently abandoned.
It seems antiquated in our ultra
modern world of cyber terrorism
and surgical bombing, but just half a
century ago, during the Korean War
and World War 11, soldiers stood at
the ready with guns facing east, just
in case our enemies tried to walk
through the front door and damage
the critical port of San Francisco.
The crumbling, overgrown mili
tary bases in the hills above the city,
with the look and feel of bad govern
ment construction, are some of the
last remnants of the old ways of de
fense. The soldiers that once would
man the guns of such posts, finger at
the trigger, are now wanning desk
chairs, fingers poised over keyboards,
patrolling cyber space for trouble.
Trouble doesn't walk in the front
door anymore. In fact, trouble doesn't
have an address either. Knowing U.S.
soldiers were being trained in cyber
warfare, and so, last year I filed a Free
dom of Information Act request for
all of the investigations closed in 2002
with one of the cyber intelligence
agencies of the U.S. military. My mis
sion: to find out what was happening
in this war we never hear about.
I received truckloads of docu
ments - most of them almost black
with heavy and nervous redacting.
While the agency filled my request,
they called me numerous times for
me to explain exactly what I wanted
with the information. It seems the
government would prefer if no one
knew about this work, neither the
enemy nor Joe Six-pack American.
Truthfully, I can't understand
most of the reports, and all of the
good cases with international hack
ers were sent on to the CIA. So, I
didn't get the full scoop, but I still
caught a glimpse of the new virtual
battlefield where many of our active
duty soldiers - big guys in camou

flage with side arms - are fighting an
enemy they can only detect matrix
like through a sea of computer code.
The shot across the bow is what
the agency people call a "knock."

Soldiers patrol
our computer sys
tems of greatest
national security;
when an intruder
attempts entry
into the system,
they first "knock"
on the outer fire
walls. Most of
these knocks are
detected and then
a soldier tries to

follow the would-be intruder
through a maze of headers and code.
Sites like the Department of Defense
receive thousands of "knocks" a day.
Some of the "knocks" are not de
tected until the intruder has slipped in
side the system and is only discovered
because information is taken out of
the site. Operation Moonlight Maze
was the hunt a few years back for the
Russian hacker who took untold
streams of data out of the Pentagon
system before he was detected and
shut out. Our intelligence believes this
was a Russian government-sanc
tioned activity - and Russia is an ally.
At this point, it's unclear - the
