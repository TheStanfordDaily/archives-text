# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### 
Edit Board went too far on edit about
Senior Class Presidents

While I can appreciate the efforts
of the Editorial Board to make the
Opinions page more relevant to life
on campus, recent pieces have made
me feel more like I am reading US
Weekly than The Stanford Daily.
There is a line between investigative
and sensational journalism, and it's
not a particularly fine one.
Yesterday's piece questioning the
resignation of Ms. Fernandez from
her position as Senior Qass President
was not about accountability (as the
Board claims); rather, it was about vil
ifying four people who, at best, are a
little late getting out some news and
who, at worst, made a mistake ("Class
presidents need to update seniors,"
Jan. 12). As for the notion that the Se
nior Class administration constitutes
an "elitist club," this sounds more like
the wording of an editorial board with
a collective chip on its shoulder than a
legitimate concern.
The intended purpose of yester
day's piece is an admirable one: en
couraging elected officials to be open
and accountable. However, the way
in which it was written is entirely in
appropriate, unnecessarily aggressive
and offensive to the journalistic mis
sion. You don't have to sell papers.
Remember? They're free.
JORDAN BROWN
Senior, Political Science
Regarding your editorial on where
in the world is Shayna Fernandez,
perhaps you should refrain from
making blanket statements about se
niors who may not, in point of fact,
give a flying (censored) about the
issue. I realize that it is difficult to
come up with a subject for an editori
al and you are thus forced to use what
ever you can, but your exaggerations
transform the most mundane occur
rences into terrifying affronts to the
human race and its outlying sub
sidiaries. (Not to mention that if you
truly "do not need or want to know
the intimate details," then "personal
reasons" should be a valid excuse for
you not to pry.)
Shayna presumably has many
things to get done, as do we all (espe
cially winter quarter of senior year),
and really, as long as her absence
doesn't affect the regularity of Pub,
excuse me, P*b Nights, is it really a
matter requiring high-falutin' bray

ing? "Leadership requires responsi
bility! It requires commitment! The
fate of the free world rests on the Se
nior Class Presidents' ability to keep
our country strong!" (OK, I added
the exclamation points. And the last
sentence.)
I should point out that there's also
no reason for me to be reacting so
strongly as to write this letter, but one
alarmist turn deserves another. Be
sides, it fills more space in your news
paper, and thus, serves as my civic ser
vice for the day.
(In conclusion, I believe that) the
Senior Class will somehow find the
strength to carry on, and their faith in
their leaders will not falter. Our pres
idents will stand strong and proud
once more. Then will we smite the
evils and plagues of this world, etc.,
etc., and enjoy a good mug of proba
tion-inducing drink.
Should the Senior Qass Presidents
have let us know about this? Sure
(and they now have). Is it a matter
that necessitates raising The Daily's
alert status to "orange?" Seems a bit
alarmist. If you're going to speak on
behalf of the Senior Class, you should
either be an authorized representa
tive of said class (e.g. the presidents)
or you should take a poll and be able
to say that the majority of seniors are
in agreement with your opinion. Oth
erwise, your statements (for example:
"This ill-conceived 'action plan' does
not reassure those seniors who have
been let down by their leaders" - first
off, as recently explained to the Se
nior Qass by its presidents, your state
ments regarding this "action plan"
are factually incorrect, and secondly, I
don't recall you asking all the seniors
if they were reassured or not, or, more
to the point, whether they cared or
not) serve only to ruffle feathers for
no good reason.

Tri-Dehs shouldn't have been named

I wanted to respond to the article
that was written about the Delta
Delta Delta sorority ("Seven plead
no contest in Tri-Delt incident," Jan.
12). As an alumna of the University,
and previous chair of the Organiza
tional Conduct Board and a past offi
cer for the Tri-Delta Sorority, I was
disappointed on several fronts as to
the way the story was presented in
The Daily. Unlike other national

publications, I think that The Daily
has often sought to circulate pertinent
information amongst the student
body, faculty and staff at the Univer
sity in order to foster better commu
nication. I think that the content of
the article contained misrepresenta
tions of organizations, events that
transpired, but most critically, misrep
resentations of individual students. I
believe that articles like this are detri
mental to a positive learning environ
ment, as well as the social environ
ment on campus. In three of my four
years at Stanford, I worked with the
Organizational Conduct Board and
chaired many cases that involved seri
ous infractions of University policy
and sometimes state laws.
In all those cases, when The Daily
reported on these incidents, specific
individuals were not identified but
the organization's leaders were inter
viewed and asked to comment. I be
lieve it is detrimental to the commu
nity to label certain individuals in a
Daily article and subject them to the
scrutiny and questions of their peers
and, most unfortunately, their pro
fessors. If Stanford is supposed to be
a strong learning environment, and if
The Daily seeks to foster it, it might
be more beneficial to write an article
about how to learn from mistakes, as
opposed to how to alienate individu
als who were involved. Additionally,
I think that giving details of police in
vestigations is not the job of The
Daily. Finally, I just wanted to com
ment that it is unnecessary to paint a
picture of an organization by singling
out certain individuals to blame.
As a past member and officer of
the Tri-Delta Sorority, I can say that
the strength of our organization has
always been in attacking problems
as a group and standing behind our
members. In our organization, we
would never seek to blame or call
out individuals for acts that the en
tire organization needs address. I
am proud of the way sorority lead
ership is holding to this premise in
the face of these challenges. Tri-
Delta is as strong as ever, working
together to create the strong sup
portive environment that I was priv
ileged to be a part of for four years
at Stanford. I am confident that the
officers, University and Greek com
munity will be sure to support the
organization into the future.

Tri-Dehs shouldn't have been named

I wanted to respond to the article
that was written about the Delta
Delta Delta sorority ("Seven plead
no contest in Tri-Delt incident," Jan.
12). As an alumna of the University,
and previous chair of the Organiza
tional Conduct Board and a past offi
cer for the Tri-Delta Sorority, I was
disappointed on several fronts as to
the way the story was presented in
The Daily. Unlike other national

publications, I think that The Daily
has often sought to circulate pertinent
information amongst the student
body, faculty and staff at the Univer
sity in order to foster better commu
nication. I think that the content of
the article contained misrepresenta
tions of organizations, events that
transpired, but most critically, misrep
resentations of individual students. I
believe that articles like this are detri
mental to a positive learning environ
ment, as well as the social environ
ment on campus. In three of my four
years at Stanford, I worked with the
Organizational Conduct Board and
chaired many cases that involved seri
ous infractions of University policy
and sometimes state laws.
In all those cases, when The Daily
reported on these incidents, specific
individuals were not identified but
the organization's leaders were inter
viewed and asked to comment. I be
lieve it is detrimental to the commu
nity to label certain individuals in a
Daily article and subject them to the
scrutiny and questions of their peers
and, most unfortunately, their pro
fessors. If Stanford is supposed to be
a strong learning environment, and if
The Daily seeks to foster it, it might
be more beneficial to write an article
about how to learn from mistakes, as
opposed to how to alienate individu
als who were involved. Additionally,
I think that giving details of police in
vestigations is not the job of The
Daily. Finally, I just wanted to com
ment that it is unnecessary to paint a
picture of an organization by singling
out certain individuals to blame.
As a past member and officer of
the Tri-Delta Sorority, I can say that
the strength of our organization has
always been in attacking problems
as a group and standing behind our
members. In our organization, we
would never seek to blame or call
out individuals for acts that the en
tire organization needs address. I
am proud of the way sorority lead
ership is holding to this premise in
the face of these challenges. Tri-
Delta is as strong as ever, working
together to create the strong sup
portive environment that I was priv
ileged to be a part of for four years
at Stanford. I am confident that the
officers, University and Greek com
munity will be sure to support the
organization into the future.

Edit Board went too far on edit about
Senior Class Presidents

While I can appreciate the efforts
of the Editorial Board to make the
Opinions page more relevant to life
on campus, recent pieces have made
me feel more like I am reading US
Weekly than The Stanford Daily.
There is a line between investigative
and sensational journalism, and it's
not a particularly fine one.
Yesterday's piece questioning the
resignation of Ms. Fernandez from
her position as Senior Qass President
was not about accountability (as the
Board claims); rather, it was about vil
ifying four people who, at best, are a
little late getting out some news and
who, at worst, made a mistake ("Class
presidents need to update seniors,"
Jan. 12). As for the notion that the Se
nior Class administration constitutes
an "elitist club," this sounds more like
the wording of an editorial board with
a collective chip on its shoulder than a
legitimate concern.
The intended purpose of yester
day's piece is an admirable one: en
couraging elected officials to be open
and accountable. However, the way
in which it was written is entirely in
appropriate, unnecessarily aggressive
and offensive to the journalistic mis
sion. You don't have to sell papers.
Remember? They're free.

Regarding your editorial on where
in the world is Shayna Fernandez,
perhaps you should refrain from
making blanket statements about se
niors who may not, in point of fact,
give a flying (censored) about the
issue. I realize that it is difficult to
come up with a subject for an editori
al and you are thus forced to use what
ever you can, but your exaggerations
transform the most mundane occur
rences into terrifying affronts to the
human race and its outlying sub
sidiaries. (Not to mention that if you
truly "do not need or want to know
the intimate details," then "personal
reasons" should be a valid excuse for
you not to pry.)
Shayna presumably has many
things to get done, as do we all (espe
cially winter quarter of senior year),
and really, as long as her absence
doesn't affect the regularity of Pub,
excuse me, P*b Nights, is it really a
matter requiring high-falutin' bray

ing? "Leadership requires responsi
bility! It requires commitment! The
fate of the free world rests on the Se
nior Class Presidents' ability to keep
our country strong!" (OK, I added
the exclamation points. And the last
sentence.)
I should point out that there's also
no reason for me to be reacting so
strongly as to write this letter, but one
alarmist turn deserves another. Be
sides, it fills more space in your news
paper, and thus, serves as my civic ser
vice for the day.
(In conclusion, I believe that) the
Senior Class will somehow find the
strength to carry on, and their faith in
their leaders will not falter. Our pres
idents will stand strong and proud
once more. Then will we smite the
evils and plagues of this world, etc.,
etc., and enjoy a good mug of proba
tion-inducing drink.
Should the Senior Qass Presidents
have let us know about this? Sure
(and they now have). Is it a matter
that necessitates raising The Daily's
alert status to "orange?" Seems a bit
alarmist. If you're going to speak on
behalf of the Senior Class, you should
either be an authorized representa
tive of said class (e.g. the presidents)
or you should take a poll and be able
to say that the majority of seniors are
in agreement with your opinion. Oth
erwise, your statements (for example:
"This ill-conceived 'action plan' does
not reassure those seniors who have
been let down by their leaders" - first
off, as recently explained to the Se
nior Qass by its presidents, your state
ments regarding this "action plan"
are factually incorrect, and secondly, I
don't recall you asking all the seniors
if they were reassured or not, or, more
to the point, whether they cared or
not) serve only to ruffle feathers for
no good reason.
