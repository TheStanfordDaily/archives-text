## It is important to determine how well our school teachers are doing 
### MARGARET E. RAYMOND 
Good schools are synonymous with
good teachers, but current methods of as
sessing teacher effectiveness are inade
quate. Educators need a new approach to
measuring teacher performance, consistent
with new attention being given by policy
makers to student academic outcomes.
Such a shift will require an adjustment of
the definition of good teachers, accompa
nied by changes in which aspects of teach
ing are considered important.
Today's view of teacher effectiveness re
lies on a static view of qualifications. Most
states gauge teacher quality by input mea
sures: What training a teacher possesses; or
process measures: What activities or peda
gogy a teacher delivers. These measures do
not correlate well enough with student aca

demic gains to be trusted as a way to assess
teachers. Worse, each teacher who passes
the minimum threshold is considered
equivalent to any other, a commodity ap
proach that serves them and their students
poorly.
Instead, we must begin evaluating teach
er effectiveness on the basis of the direct
impact that teachers have on student
achievement. Whatever else a teacher may
provide, we need teachers who can "deliv
er the goods" in terms of moving their stu
dents ahead academically.
Only by assessing student outcomes can
we get a clear measure of teacher perfor
mance. In concept, this solution seems
straightforward. But we must be able to
link students to their teachers and examine
the impact a teacher has had on his or her
students over the course of several years.

Such associations require a unique teacher
identification number, which is currently
absent in many states.
At the same time, it would be irresponsi
ble to treat the academic gains a teacher
creates in a year's time as the sole factor in
determining an individual teacher's effec
tiveness. Existing research indicates that
other factors also contribute to student
learning gains, such as prior achievement
and family and peer characteristics. Simple
aggregations of student gains should not be
relied on as a solitary measure of teacher
performance.
What is needed is a way to separate the
important contributions that teachers
make from family, school and other influ
ences. It is unfair to attribute everything
that goes on in schools to teachers. But our
current school accountability programs do

not separate the role of teachers from such
things as how closely aligned a district's cur
riculum is to state academic standards,
turnover in staffing or new administrative
leadership. Although we currently know
little about the interplay of these effects, we
will need to better understand them to
know which factors amenable to public in
tervention hold the best promise for im
provements in our schools.
Two related changes are necessary.
First, states need unique teacher identifica
tion numbers (similar to those for students)
that follow them throughout pubic school
service, thus enabling analyses of the value
of resources and their returns on improving
student education outcomes. Evaluation of
auricular programs, teacher development
and new reform programs are then imme
diately within reach, resulting in more in

formed decisions about school spending. In
this time of budget constraints, any means
to better target existing resources is a boon.
Second, all states need to expand their
data on students and teachers so that the
underlying relationships among student,
school, family and teacher factors can
emerge.
These vitally needed steps are missing
from the good-faith efforts under way to
improve our schools. For further informa
