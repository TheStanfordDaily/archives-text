## Spencer weeds out the pretenders and contenders 
### 
There are times when the sports and enter
tainment worlds collide. When Bennifer
goes to a Red Sox game. Most Super Bowl
Half time shows.
When Snoop says he's given up weed to try out
for the Raiders.
Last Sunday was one of those nights.
Out on the town with Ben Huston, Emerson
Sykes, Luppe Luppen, Sammy Lubega and Greg
Larson, who insisted his name was "Salvadore,"
we were just wandering around (what we call
"bulldogging"), trying to find some entertain
ment.
But HE found us.
With what seemed like a stroke of divine inter
vention, we came across a mob of photographers,
semi-reporters and camera crews, the sleazy guys
who show up on "Celebrities: Uncensored."
We knew who they were waiting for.
It was him.
The king of the metrosexuals, the only man to

bone Britney, the man who
every frat guy emulates.
It was Justin Timberlake.
So as we explored the area,
trying to be the first to spot
Justin, we came across a white
stretch limo, obviously waiting
for the prime time to make its
entrance onto the scene.
Now I'd like to say that we
just maturely walked past, only
to have Justin pop his head out

and say, "What's up guys, you want to chill
tonight?" I'd like to say we kept our composure.
I'd like to say we respected his privacy.
We danced around that limo like little school
girls. Salvadore rushed up to the back window,
motioning for the Prince of Pop to roll it down.
Ben tried to steal a glance from all sides of the
car. I was busy making sure I hadn't peed my
pants.
Just as Ben decided he was going to just go for
it and open the door, the limo started rolling to the
club. We followed the car as if our jackets were
caught in the closing of the trunk.
Sure enough, as the limo pulled up to the club,
the door swung open, only to reveal the stubbled
model of a man. Showing off his trademark swag
ger, style and hot friends, Justin walked into the
club with supreme indifference to everything
going on in the world, including this young colum
nist.
But what a moment, what command of the au
dience, what a brush with fame. Our hearts were
pounding, our egos filled, our bodies sufficiently
rocked.
All until a photographer for InStyle magazine
told us not to be so quick to walk away. He told us
that that wasn't Justin, it was a look-alike, the win
ner of a contest two days ago, now used for duping
the press and fans alike.
BULLSH*T!!!
How could you tease me like that, Justin? How
could you let me down? How could you, like so
many sports teams now, be just a pretender?
(Segue alert!)
That's right sports fans, not all is lost, Spencer
still writes about sports on occasion, and this little
vignette is a metaphor for the NFL playoffs. You
see, the playoffs are like an InStyle photographer.
They highlight weaknesses, they have no morals,
and the make the pretenders known.
The biggest pretender of the bunch: the Kansas
City Chiefs. I'm not sure that there has ever been
a year like this one, where two teams in college
and pro football seemed to have the entire season
locked up, drawing comparisons to all-time great
teams, only to fold completely in the end of the
season. Oklahoma and Kansas City, both relying
on high scoring shootouts, eventually got shot.
The second biggest pretender of the playoffs
has got to be Carolina. Their win over Dallas was
legit, but their win over a crumbling St. Louis fran
chise is being overblown. Now, I'm the biggest fan
of a team believing in itself to do great things, but
eventually, a hot player (Delhomme) at a crucial
position (QB) will not be enough.
Take a look at last year's Mighty Ducks. Riding
the play of J.S. Giguere for as long as they could,
they went deep into the playoffs, but eventually, a
better, more experienced New Jersey Devils team
beat them.
I say this with utmost certainty, the Eagles will
be in the Super Bowl.
However, on the AFC side of things, we have a
matchup that is shaping up to be the greatest AFC
title game of my lifetime. Neither of these teams
are pretenders, hopping out of white limos that
they didn't pay for; both the Colts and Patriots are
legit. These are the two best teams in football right
now the Colts are firing on all cylinders, and the
Patriots are riding a winning streak that's very
reminiscent of their title run two years ago. Now,
I won't go as far to say that this is the "Super
Bowl," because I think that the Eagles, in a semi
fluke game, could beat either team, but I don't
think it's likely.
My prediction: The Patriots will bring it, and
bring it hard. There are no better motivators than
a passionate crowd, a freezing stadium and a team
that loves it all. The Patriots will win in a low-scor
ing affair, playing their game, not letting Peyton
play his, 17-9.
So friends, I know this column has taken more
turns than "Lost in Translation" has awkward mo
ments, but I'm glad you've stayed with me to the
end. Sorry about that. Just wait 'til the weekend,
because there will be some good stuff on the tube.

chise is being overblown. Now, I'm the biggest fan
of a team believing in itself to do great things, but
eventually, a hot player (Delhomme) at a crucial
position (QB) will not be enough.
Take a look at last year's Mighty Ducks. Riding
the play of J.S. Giguere for as long as they could,
they went deep into the playoffs, but eventually, a
better, more experienced New Jersey Devils team
beat them.
I say this with utmost certainty, the Eagles will
be in the Super Bowl.
However, on the AFC side of things, we have a
matchup that is shaping up to be the greatest AFC
title game of my lifetime. Neither of these teams
are pretenders, hopping out of white limos that
they didn't pay for; both the Colts and Patriots are
legit. These are the two best teams in football right
now the Colts are firing on all cylinders, and the
Patriots are riding a winning streak that's very
reminiscent of their title run two years ago. Now,
I won't go as far to say that this is the "Super
Bowl," because I think that the Eagles, in a semi
fluke game, could beat either team, but I don't
think it's likely.
My prediction: The Patriots will bring it, and
bring it hard. There are no better motivators than
a passionate crowd, a freezing stadium and a team
that loves it all. The Patriots will win in a low-scor
ing affair, playing their game, not letting Peyton
play his, 17-9.
So friends, I know this column has taken more
turns than "Lost in Translation" has awkward mo
ments, but I'm glad you've stayed with me to the
end. Sorry about that. Just wait 'til the weekend,
because there will be some good stuff on the tube.

There are times when the sports and enter
tainment worlds collide. When Bennifer
goes to a Red Sox game. Most Super Bowl
Half time shows.
When Snoop says he's given up weed to try out
for the Raiders.
Last Sunday was one of those nights.
Out on the town with Ben Huston, Emerson
Sykes, Luppe Luppen, Sammy Lubega and Greg
Larson, who insisted his name was "Salvadore,"
we were just wandering around (what we call
"bulldogging"), trying to find some entertain
ment.
But HE found us.
With what seemed like a stroke of divine inter
vention, we came across a mob of photographers,
semi-reporters and camera crews, the sleazy guys
who show up on "Celebrities: Uncensored."
We knew who they were waiting for.
It was him.
The king of the metrosexuals, the only man to

bone Britney, the man who
every frat guy emulates.
It was Justin Timberlake.
So as we explored the area,
trying to be the first to spot
Justin, we came across a white
stretch limo, obviously waiting
for the prime time to make its
entrance onto the scene.
Now I'd like to say that we
just maturely walked past, only
to have Justin pop his head out

and say, "What's up guys, you want to chill
tonight?" I'd like to say we kept our composure.
I'd like to say we respected his privacy.
We danced around that limo like little school
girls. Salvadore rushed up to the back window,
motioning for the Prince of Pop to roll it down.
Ben tried to steal a glance from all sides of the
car. I was busy making sure I hadn't peed my
pants.
Just as Ben decided he was going to just go for
it and open the door, the limo started rolling to the
club. We followed the car as if our jackets were
caught in the closing of the trunk.
Sure enough, as the limo pulled up to the club,
the door swung open, only to reveal the stubbled
model of a man. Showing off his trademark swag
ger, style and hot friends, Justin walked into the
club with supreme indifference to everything
going on in the world, including this young colum
nist.
But what a moment, what command of the au
dience, what a brush with fame. Our hearts were
pounding, our egos filled, our bodies sufficiently
rocked.
All until a photographer for InStyle magazine
told us not to be so quick to walk away. He told us
that that wasn't Justin, it was a look-alike, the win
ner of a contest two days ago, now used for duping
the press and fans alike.
BULLSH*T!!!
How could you tease me like that, Justin? How
could you let me down? How could you, like so
many sports teams now, be just a pretender?
(Segue alert!)
That's right sports fans, not all is lost, Spencer
still writes about sports on occasion, and this little
vignette is a metaphor for the NFL playoffs. You
see, the playoffs are like an InStyle photographer.
They highlight weaknesses, they have no morals,
and the make the pretenders known.
The biggest pretender of the bunch: the Kansas
City Chiefs. I'm not sure that there has ever been
a year like this one, where two teams in college
and pro football seemed to have the entire season
locked up, drawing comparisons to all-time great
teams, only to fold completely in the end of the
season. Oklahoma and Kansas City, both relying
on high scoring shootouts, eventually got shot.
The second biggest pretender of the playoffs
has got to be Carolina. Their win over Dallas was
legit, but their win over a crumbling St. Louis fran
chise is being overblown. Now, I'm the biggest fan
