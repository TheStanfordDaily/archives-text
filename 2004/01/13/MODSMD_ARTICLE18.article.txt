# ON THE DEFENSIVE
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
A year ago, Cardinal baseball fans
flooded Sunken Diamond every weekend
expecting to see a Stanford win, and with
good reason. There were few teams in the
NCAA with the offensive power to hit ace

John Hudgins, and those that could had
trouble finding holes in the solid Stanford
defense.
But now that Hudgins and Ryan Mc-
Cally the other staple in the Cardinal
starting rotation have left the Farm,
along with three starting position players,
some preseason prognosticators question

whether the 2004 squad will be able to give
Stanford its sixth straight College World
Series appearance.
And to the doubters, the Cardinal
bullpen has just one piece of advice: Think
again.
While Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess will be the first to admit that having

two sophomores in his starting three is
definitely not ideal Mark Romanczuk
and Matt Manship will be regulars on the
mound this season he also knows that
his pitchers have enough talent to make

their ages a non-factor.
After all, Romanczuk and Man
ship didn't exactly have typical
freshman years on the Farm.
Romanczuk, who is Stanford's
only returning starter, posted a 12-2
record last year and was named the
National Freshman of the Year,
while Manship paced the Cardinal
with nine saves and made the Fresh
man All-American squad.
"The thing is, [Romanczuk and I]
got a lot of experience last year,"
Manship said. "I pitched about 70 in
nings and Mark had probably 100.
This is not anything new for us."
In addition, Romanczuk will find
an extra push of motivation from his
desire to improve upon his perfor
mance in the College World Series.
The lefty struggled in both of his
starts in Omaha, despite stellar
pitching in Regionals and Superße
gionals and said that he is ready to
head back to the CWS to "right that
wrong".
Though many hurlers will throw
opening pitches for the Cardinal in
the early weeks of the season, Mar
quess will eventually narrow it down
to three or four regulars. In addition
to Manship and Romanczuk, senior
David O'Hagan will likely become a
starter after a great season of relief
pitching in 2003.
O'Hagan also brings three years
of experience to the bullpen, which
Marquess and his pitchers agree is
an advantage.
"[O'Hagan] has just as much, if
not more experience than anyone on
the team, and that's good for us,"
Manship said.
Romanczuk added that
O'Hagan, along with himself, Man
ship and sophomore reliever Kodiak
Quick will hopefully be able to band
together and form a solid leadership
that will strengthen the Stanford
bullpen.
The Cardinal's pitching staff also
has the benefit of a gifted freshman
class.
"We gained five freshman pitch
ers," Marquess said. "And two or
three of them are ahead . . .
[though] all of them are doing well.

Greg Reynolds, Matt Leva and
Blake Holler did very well in the fall
and have a chance to really con
tribute this season."
And whatever surprises Stan
ford's bullpen has in store for its op
ponents, Cardinal pitchers won't
face too many surprises on the field,
as the defense behind them is just as
dependable as last year's.
Last season's draft and gradua
tion left holes at shortstop, catcher
and right field for the Cardinal, but
so many experienced position play
ers are returning this year that the
gaps will be easy to fill.
Senior utility player Brian Hall
who started at first base for much
of last year will take over the out
field spot vacated by Carlos
Quentin. Senior Sam Fuld will start
in center for the fourth year straight
and junior Danny Putnam will main
tain his position in left.
The starting job at second and
shortstop are still up for grabs,
though sophomore Jed Lowrie will
definitely start at one of the two po
sitions, according to Marquess.
Freshman Adam Sorgi and sopho
more Chris Lewis could play at the
other position.
Despite the graduation of Ryan
Garko, Marquess said that new
starting catcher Donny Lucy, a ju
nior, and his sophomore backup,
John Hester, makes catcher the
strongest defensive position for
Stanford.
"Donny is one of the better
catchers in college baseball," Mar
quess said. "In terms of receiving
and throwing, he is a better defen
sive catcher than Garko was, and
he'll go earlier in the draft than
Garko did because of that."
Sophomore John Mayberry, Jr.
missed the last part of the 2003 sea
son due to injury, but he will return
to his place at first base, while third
base will belong to senior Jonny
Ash.
All in all, Marquess is pleased
with the challenge that his defense
will present to the teams Stanford
faces.
"We're in better shape defensive
ly now than we were at the same
time last year," he said.

while Manship paced the Cardinal
with nine saves and made the Fresh
man All-American squad.
"The thing is, [Romanczuk and I]
got a lot of experience last year,"
Manship said. "I pitched about 70 in
nings and Mark had probably 100.
This is not anything new for us."
In addition, Romanczuk will find
an extra push of motivation from his
desire to improve upon his perfor
mance in the College World Series.
The lefty struggled in both of his
starts in Omaha, despite stellar
pitching in Regionals and Superße
gionals and said that he is ready to
head back to the CWS to "right that
wrong".
Though many hurlers will throw
opening pitches for the Cardinal in
the early weeks of the season, Mar
quess will eventually narrow it down
to three or four regulars. In addition
to Manship and Romanczuk, senior
David O'Hagan will likely become a
starter after a great season of relief
pitching in 2003.
O'Hagan also brings three years
of experience to the bullpen, which
Marquess and his pitchers agree is
an advantage.
"[O'Hagan] has just as much, if
not more experience than anyone on
the team, and that's good for us,"
Manship said.
Romanczuk added that
O'Hagan, along with himself, Man
ship and sophomore reliever Kodiak
Quick will hopefully be able to band
together and form a solid leadership
that will strengthen the Stanford
bullpen.
The Cardinal's pitching staff also
has the benefit of a gifted freshman
class.
"We gained five freshman pitch
ers," Marquess said. "And two or
three of them are ahead . . .
[though] all of them are doing well.

Greg Reynolds, Matt Leva and
Blake Holler did very well in the fall
and have a chance to really con
tribute this season."
And whatever surprises Stan
ford's bullpen has in store for its op
ponents, Cardinal pitchers won't
face too many surprises on the field,
as the defense behind them is just as
dependable as last year's.
Last season's draft and gradua
tion left holes at shortstop, catcher
and right field for the Cardinal, but
so many experienced position play
ers are returning this year that the
gaps will be easy to fill.
Senior utility player Brian Hall
who started at first base for much
of last year will take over the out
field spot vacated by Carlos
Quentin. Senior Sam Fuld will start
in center for the fourth year straight
and junior Danny Putnam will main
tain his position in left.
The starting job at second and
shortstop are still up for grabs,
though sophomore Jed Lowrie will
definitely start at one of the two po
sitions, according to Marquess.
Freshman Adam Sorgi and sopho
more Chris Lewis could play at the
other position.
Despite the graduation of Ryan
Garko, Marquess said that new
starting catcher Donny Lucy, a ju
nior, and his sophomore backup,
John Hester, makes catcher the
strongest defensive position for
Stanford.
"Donny is one of the better
catchers in college baseball," Mar
quess said. "In terms of receiving
and throwing, he is a better defen
sive catcher than Garko was, and
he'll go earlier in the draft than
Garko did because of that."
Sophomore John Mayberry, Jr.
missed the last part of the 2003 sea
son due to injury, but he will return
to his place at first base, while third
base will belong to senior Jonny
Ash.
All in all, Marquess is pleased
with the challenge that his defense
will present to the teams Stanford
faces.
"We're in better shape defensive
ly now than we were at the same
time last year," he said.
A year ago, Cardinal baseball fans
flooded Sunken Diamond every weekend
expecting to see a Stanford win, and with
good reason. There were few teams in the
NCAA with the offensive power to hit ace

John Hudgins, and those that could had
trouble finding holes in the solid Stanford
defense.
But now that Hudgins and Ryan Mc-
Cally the other staple in the Cardinal
starting rotation have left the Farm,
along with three starting position players,
some preseason prognosticators question

whether the 2004 squad will be able to give
Stanford its sixth straight College World
Series appearance.
And to the doubters, the Cardinal
bullpen has just one piece of advice: Think
again.
While Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess will be the first to admit that having

two sophomores in his starting three is
definitely not ideal Mark Romanczuk
and Matt Manship will be regulars on the
mound this season he also knows that
his pitchers have enough talent to make

their ages a non-factor.
After all, Romanczuk and Man
ship didn't exactly have typical
freshman years on the Farm.
Romanczuk, who is Stanford's
only returning starter, posted a 12-2
record last year and was named the
National Freshman of the Year,
while Manship paced the Cardinal
with nine saves and made the Fresh
man All-American squad.
