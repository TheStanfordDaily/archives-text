# Manship looks to move from stern to bow
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In the last two decades or so, a number
of Major League starters have found suc
cess after becoming closers. Some of these
players are household names: Dennis
Eckersley, whose credentials as a closer
recently won him a spot in the Hall of
Fame despite a decade of mediocrity as a
starter; John Smoltz, who returned from
career-threatening elbow surgery and
thrived after setting up shop in the Braves'

bullpen; and Eric Gagne, a bust as a starter
who won the Cy Young award last year
after becoming a closer in 2002.
Now, try to name a closer, any closer,
who has transformed himself into a start
ing pitcher. Not so easy, is it? Anybody
come up with Scott Williamson? I didn't
think so.
Stanford sophomore Matt Manship
will try to set a new precedent this season
when he becomes the team's Saturday
night starter. It will be a new role for Man
ship, who had a standout freshman season

as the team's closer, leading the Cardinal
with nine saves, but he is prepared for the
assignment.
"Last year I hadn't played in college
before, I was just getting my feet wet,"
Manship said. "Now, people expect things
of me."
He has experience starting, however;
he did it all through high school.
"I just have to reincorporate that rou
tine and try to remember what I did back
then," Manship said.
By all accounts, he's up for the chal

lenge.
"He's already proven that he's very
competitive, which is the one thing you
need from any pitcher but especially from
a starter," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "He came into pressure
packed situations last year, so this transi
tion should not really be a problem for
him."
Judging by the results, Manship
seemed plenty comfortable in a difficult
role last season, posting a 3.98 ERA
in 63.1 innings and compiling 50
strikeouts on his way to becoming a
freshman All-American. Now, he
joins sophomore Mark Romanczuk,
a 12-game winner last year, in the
starting rotation. Romanczuk is the
only holdover from last season's ro
tation, and Manship will be counted
on to replace some of the firepower
the team lost with the departures of
starters John Hudgins and Ryan Mc-
Cally, who combined to win 21
games last year.
"I expect him to have a great
year," Romanczuk said. "I remem
ber one game in particular at USC
last year that he started and did very
well in ... I think he can handle any
type of role."
Manship held the Trojans to three
runs in seven and two-thirds innings
to get the win in that game, one of
two starts he made last season.
He is well aware of what he has to
do to succeed as a starter, and he
talked about the differences be
tween coming into a game for one or
two innings and pitching for the ma
jority of a game. He said that he will
have to use his changeup more often
to keep hitters off-balance because
they will see him more than once in a
game, whereas as a closer he could
rely more on his fastball. He also said
that he will try to get hitters out on
fewer pitches.
"You can't conserve energy for
later, but you have to have it in the
back of your mind that you're going
to be throwing multiple innings,"
Manship said. "You have to gener
ate more ground balls, because then
you will throw fewer pitches ... lo
cation is important, you really need
to keep the ball down."
As Manship steps into the rota
tion he also steps into more of a lead
ership role, one that he seems equal
ly well suited to handle.
"He has leadership qualities be
yond his years," Romanczuk said.
"People respect and listen to him, es
pecially the young kids."
Marquess said that Manship leads
by example.
"He's a really hard worker, very

dedicated and very serious about
baseball," he said.
Manship pitched in his first
winter inter-squad game on Sun
day and threw well, according to

Marquess.
"We have another two or three
weeks, and he'll progress well," Mar
quess said. "He's right where he
needs to be."

That's a hopeful sign for closers
looking to make the transition to
starter everywhere, and for a team
hoping to capture the championship
that eluded it last year.

Stanford sophomore pitcher Matt Manship, who led the Cardinal with nine saves in 25 appearances last season,
will look to be equally dominant in a starting role this season for head coach Mark Marquess.
