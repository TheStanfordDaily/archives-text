In the last two decades or so, a number
of Major League starters have found suc

players are household names: Dennis
Eckersley, whose credentials as a closer
recently won him a spot in the Hall of
Fame despite a decade of mediocrity as a

"He's already proven that he's very
competitive, which is the one thing you
need from any pitcher but especially from
a starter," said Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess. "He came into pressure

him."
Judging by the results, Manship
seemed plenty comfortable in a difficult
