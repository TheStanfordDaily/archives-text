# Med school applications up, B-school down

### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While Stanford's Graduate School of Business received significantly
fewer applications this year to its MBA program, the Medical School re
ceived slightly more.
The lack of an overall trend in the number of applications received this
year at Stanford's professional schools suggests that economic factors have
not played a role in these fluctuating numbers, despite the lingering eco
nomic recession, according to directors of the Business School and Medical
School.
The Business School's MBA Program has experienced a decline over the
past few years. In 1999, the school received 6,606 applications, but then saw
declines for three of the next four years, with just 5,089 in 2003 an overall
decline of 23 percent.
However, the Medical School received 5,445 applications in 2003, a 4 per
cent increase from 5,247 in 2002. This year promises another rise, with the
American Association of Medical Colleges estimating a three percent in
crease in applications nationally. These increases follow a period in which the
Medical School applications fell seven out of eight years from a peak in 1995
of 7,006 to 5,247 in 2002 a drop of 25 percent.
Stanford Law School could not be contacted for the release of similar ad
missions statistics.
These fluctuations in graduate school applications do not appear to be
linked to the economy, the admissions officials said. If the two were connect
ed, a strong economy like the one experienced in the late 1990s would
cause a decrease in applications, as college graduates would have an easier
time of finding work. A weak economy like today's would conversely moti
vate people to obtain higher credentials in a more competitive job market.
However, while both the medical and business schools saw sharp de
creases during the booming years of the 19905, they continued to see marked
declines in application numbers during the leaner years of 2000 to the pre
sent.
"I don't think there's a correlation there," said Albert Chevez, associate
director of admissions for the Medical School.
Wendy Hansen, associate director of MBA Admissions, agreed that the
economy did not entirely dictate application numbers. She added, however,

that faith in various job industries does affect the number of applications the
business school receives from workers in those industries.
"Certainly, we may see more or fewer MBA applicants from particular in
dustries depending on how people feel about job stability and opportuni
ties," she said.
Students also denied any connection between the economy and the deci
sion to apply to graduate school.
"The economy has no effect on my decision to apply to medical school
right out of college," said senior Emily Hon.
A law school applicant agreed.
"The economy did not change my desire to attend law school right away,"
said senior Bimal Patel.
