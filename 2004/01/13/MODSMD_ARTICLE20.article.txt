## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling team (3-4) seemed to have vic
tory in their grasp literally after sophomore Luis
Vendrell's pin in the waning seconds of his match against
Cal State Bakersfield's Anthony Baza preceded fifth
ranked Matt Gentry's seventh consecutive win in dual

meet competition to start the season.
Gentry's 10-5 decision gave the Cardinal an 18-15 lead
over No. 23 Bakersfield heading into the final bout of the
home meet on Sunday, where Stanford redshirt freshman
Brian Perry suffered a tough pin at the hands of Christian
Arellano to give the Roadrunners a 21-18 win.
Junior Brad Metzler, currently ranked No. 20 at 141,
notched his 15th win of the season, and Stanford's John
Garfinkel (184) and Imad Kharbush (174) tallied victo
ries as well.
Freshman Tanner Gardner, who came into the match
fifth on the team with 11 wins, dropped a narrow 7-6 de
cision to fourth-ranked Efren Ceballos.
The Cardinal return to action this Thursday at home
against Oregon. The dual meet will be held in Burnham
Pavilion and begin at 7 p.m.
