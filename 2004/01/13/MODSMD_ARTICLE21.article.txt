TARA KIRK

The senior swimmer captured two individual
titles in the 100 and 200 meter breast, as No. 4
Stanford glided past Pacific 144-107 in a non-con
ference meet. Kirk, whose time in the 100 breast
(1:08.42) was the only NCAA 'A' qualifying time
of the meet, also helped the Cardinal's 200 meter
medley relay team to a first-place finish. Kirk has
won all 29 of her races in the 100 breast during her
collegiate career.

JOSH CHILDRESS

In just his third game back from a stress reac
tion in his left foot that caused him to miss the
first nine games, Childress tipped in a Justin
Davis miss with nine seconds remaining to give
the Cardinal a dramatic 63-62 victory over Ari
zona State. The All-America candidate followed
Thursday's heroics with 19 points, seven re
bounds and five assists in Stanford's 82-72 upset
of Arizona in Tucson.
