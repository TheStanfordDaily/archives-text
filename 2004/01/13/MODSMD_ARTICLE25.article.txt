## Oregon State has big plans for tiniest technologies

(U-WIRE) CORVALLIS, Ore. Sen. Ron
Wyden has big plans for resurrecting the Oregon econo
my big plans based on the tiniest of technologies.
Along with Sen. George Allen of Virginia, Wyden co
sponsored the recently passed 21st Century Nanotechnolo
gy Research and Development Act, which will provide $3.7
billion for research and education in nanotechnology in
2005.
He wants to see much of this funding come to his home
state, and has already appropriated $1.2 million in federal
funding for the development of a collaborative nanotech
nology research center in Oregon.
This signature Multiscale Materials and Devices Re
search Center, a collaboration between Oregon State Uni
versity, the University of Oregon, Portland State University
and Pacific Northwest National Lab, is already in operation
developing "multiscale" devices combining nano- and
micro-technology.
The Hewlett-Packard Corvallis campus has donated
space for this venture until a new center is built on the OSU
campus.
Sen. Wyden visited the OSU campus last Friday to wit
ness first-hand a current OSU and PNNL project to create
portable cooling devices based on this multiscale technology.

With primary support for the project coming from the
military, the current goal is development of backpack air
conditioning devices that can be worn by soldiers working in
hot climates or wearing protective suits.
Further applications of this technology include similar
backpacks for firefighters and rescue workers.
Wyden and a group of researchers from OSU's College
of Engineering, the collaborating universities and other in
terested Oregon technology companies gathered in Dr.
Deborah Pence's mechanical engineering lab for a demon
stration of the break-through first step of the project, a tiny
heat exchanger.
The senator was greeted by OSU President Ed Ray. "I
appreciate your ability to think big about small devices,"
Ray said.
He recounted Wyden's many legislative triumphs. "You
have an understanding of the broad needs of the people of
Oregon, and your record of success is unmatched elsewhere
in the U. 5.," he said.
Rebecca Cullion, one of Pence's Ph.D. students, took the
floor and began the demonstration by inviting Wyden to
make a wager. "Mr. Senator, I bet you a dollar that you, on
your person, have something that could save lives in chemi
cal warfare," she said.
The Rhode Island native laid a bill on the demonstration
table, as the senator laughingly protested that he could not
accept a bet.

Previous research on mini air conditioners involved heat
exchangers that pump coolant through small parallel chan
nels, which, Cullion explained, "is like trying to suck a thick
milkshake through a coffee stirrer."
Dr. Pence discovered a better solution in nature by look
ing at the human heart.
Only the size of a fist, the heart pumps blood throughout
the entire body by using a network of branching fractillate
channels, each successive branch becoming smaller in diam
eter, Cullion said. Pence's lab created a new, patentable heat
exchanger using these fractal patterns in place of the old par
allel channel design.
Cullion demonstrated the easy flow of liquid through the
branched channels on a larger-scale model.
She attributed the project's ultimate success to a cooper
ative effort between all of the departments in OSU's College
of Engineering.
The next step will be to develop the housing for the heat
exchanger to make it into a backpack air conditioning unit
a project that will likely be finished within two years.
The device will also have future applications in the com
puter industry for its ability to cool chips.
Cullion summed up her presentation by reclaiming her
dollar bill. "Because you have a heart, I keep my dollar," she
told Wyden.
"This is the face of Oregon's economic future," an im
pressed Wyden proclaimed.

"The reason that I've really poured my heart and soul
into nanotechnology is that it has the potential of the com
puter revolution, and Oregon has the chance to be out
front."
The lab demonstration was followed by a round table dis
cussion among all the participants.
Ron Adams, head of the College of Engineering, pre
sented Wyden with a plaque in OSU colors featuring a piece
of the fractal channel design, in appreciation for the sena
tor's support for nanotechnology research.
Wyden urged continued collaboration and innovation in
research on multiscale devices to secure as much of the $3.7
billion in federal nanotechnology funding for the state of
Oregon as possible, and suggested applying the technology
to energy issues.
"I'm really encouraging full-steam ahead on so-called
'green nanotechnology,"' Wyden said. "I want to make
Oregon the green energy capital of the world, and nan
otechnology is one of those key elements of a green ener
gy future."
The senator criticized the current administration for its
lack of fiscal responsibility, which has led to the national
deficit and the lack of funding for education and research.
"I think what's going on here is some of the most im
portant work imaginable," Wyden concluded. "I will
do everything I possibly can to back you up in this
work."

table, as the senator laughingly protested that he could not
accept a bet.

Previous research on mini air conditioners involved heat
exchangers that pump coolant through small parallel chan
nels, which, Cullion explained, "is like trying to suck a thick
milkshake through a coffee stirrer."
Dr. Pence discovered a better solution in nature by look
ing at the human heart.
Only the size of a fist, the heart pumps blood throughout
the entire body by using a network of branching fractillate
channels, each successive branch becoming smaller in diam
eter, Cullion said. Pence's lab created a new, patentable heat
exchanger using these fractal patterns in place of the old par
allel channel design.
Cullion demonstrated the easy flow of liquid through the
branched channels on a larger-scale model.
She attributed the project's ultimate success to a cooper
ative effort between all of the departments in OSU's College
of Engineering.
The next step will be to develop the housing for the heat
exchanger to make it into a backpack air conditioning unit
a project that will likely be finished within two years.
The device will also have future applications in the com
puter industry for its ability to cool chips.
Cullion summed up her presentation by reclaiming her
dollar bill. "Because you have a heart, I keep my dollar," she
told Wyden.
"This is the face of Oregon's economic future," an im
pressed Wyden proclaimed.

"The reason that I've really poured my heart and soul
into nanotechnology is that it has the potential of the com
puter revolution, and Oregon has the chance to be out
front."
The lab demonstration was followed by a round table dis
cussion among all the participants.
Ron Adams, head of the College of Engineering, pre
sented Wyden with a plaque in OSU colors featuring a piece
of the fractal channel design, in appreciation for the sena
tor's support for nanotechnology research.
Wyden urged continued collaboration and innovation in
research on multiscale devices to secure as much of the $3.7
billion in federal nanotechnology funding for the state of
Oregon as possible, and suggested applying the technology
to energy issues.
"I'm really encouraging full-steam ahead on so-called
'green nanotechnology,"' Wyden said. "I want to make
Oregon the green energy capital of the world, and nan
otechnology is one of those key elements of a green ener
gy future."
The senator criticized the current administration for its
lack of fiscal responsibility, which has led to the national
deficit and the lack of funding for education and research.
"I think what's going on here is some of the most im
portant work imaginable," Wyden concluded. "I will
do everything I possibly can to back you up in this
work."
(U-WIRE) CORVALLIS, Ore. Sen. Ron
Wyden has big plans for resurrecting the Oregon econo
my big plans based on the tiniest of technologies.
Along with Sen. George Allen of Virginia, Wyden co
sponsored the recently passed 21st Century Nanotechnolo
gy Research and Development Act, which will provide $3.7
billion for research and education in nanotechnology in
2005.
He wants to see much of this funding come to his home
state, and has already appropriated $1.2 million in federal
funding for the development of a collaborative nanotech
nology research center in Oregon.
This signature Multiscale Materials and Devices Re
search Center, a collaboration between Oregon State Uni
versity, the University of Oregon, Portland State University
and Pacific Northwest National Lab, is already in operation
developing "multiscale" devices combining nano- and
micro-technology.
The Hewlett-Packard Corvallis campus has donated
space for this venture until a new center is built on the OSU
campus.
Sen. Wyden visited the OSU campus last Friday to wit
ness first-hand a current OSU and PNNL project to create
portable cooling devices based on this multiscale technology.

With primary support for the project coming from the
military, the current goal is development of backpack air
conditioning devices that can be worn by soldiers working in
hot climates or wearing protective suits.
Further applications of this technology include similar
backpacks for firefighters and rescue workers.
Wyden and a group of researchers from OSU's College
of Engineering, the collaborating universities and other in
terested Oregon technology companies gathered in Dr.
Deborah Pence's mechanical engineering lab for a demon
stration of the break-through first step of the project, a tiny
heat exchanger.
The senator was greeted by OSU President Ed Ray. "I
appreciate your ability to think big about small devices,"
Ray said.
He recounted Wyden's many legislative triumphs. "You
have an understanding of the broad needs of the people of
Oregon, and your record of success is unmatched elsewhere
in the U. 5.," he said.
Rebecca Cullion, one of Pence's Ph.D. students, took the
floor and began the demonstration by inviting Wyden to
make a wager. "Mr. Senator, I bet you a dollar that you, on
your person, have something that could save lives in chemi
cal warfare," she said.
