# Illinois police to use race as a factor in traffic stops for new study
## 
### JENNIFER GOLZ THE COLUMBIA CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) CHICAGO A new Senate bill requiring Illi
nois police to take a driver's race into consideration when mak
ing traffic stops took effect Jan. 1.
The Illinois Department of Transportation will collect data
over the next four years to determine if decisions regarding traf
fic stops are based on police officers' perception of the driver's
race.
The four-year study is believed to be a knee-jerk reaction to
the actions of Highland Park and Mount Prospect Police De
partments, which have both been sued for racial profiling in the
past.
Vehicles that are stopped for statute or ordinance violations
are subject to the new study. Whether a citation is given or not,
officers are now required to take note of the driver's race.
The bill requires that the driver be put into one of the fol
lowing categories: Caucasian, African-American, Native Amer
ican/Alaskan, Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander.
However, the police officers are not allowed to ask the race of
the individual.
"In places where officers have attempted [to obtain the dri
ver's race] it has caused more controversy," said Tom Kelso,
staff assistant for special projects with IDOT. "The officer's in
terpretation of what the race [of the driver] is, that is important."
But the interpretation may not always be accurate when classi
fying drivers of Middle Eastern descent. According to Kelso, of
ficers in question have been advised to put Middle Eastern dri
vers into the Caucasian category. But the Chicago Police De
partment has been classifying these drivers as Asian.
Northwestern University will analyze the data collected by

IDOT over the next four years.
Alexander Weiss, director of the Center for Public Safety at
Northwestern, said it doesn't matter if the police officers get the
race wrong.
"The fact of the matter is the extent to which the officer
makes decisions on the basis of someone's race," Weiss said.
But Safaa Zarzour, chairman for the Chicago chapter of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nonprofit organiza
tion that promotes the positive image of Muslims and Islam in
America, said the organization's goal is for a color-blind society.
"If information is going to be collected, then we should be con
cerned that the higher rate of stopping Arabs will be under the
radar because they are classified as white," Zarzour said.
Ed Yohnka, director of communications for the American
Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, said the question of adding a cat
egory to classify people of Middle Eastern descent was discussed
during the legislative process, but it didn't raise a high enough
level of concern at the time to warrant the extra race group.
"Police officers are not profiling in this form; they are simply
measuring the way they are behaving on the street," Yohnka
said. "Law enforcement agencies can set benchmarks based on
the data and decide what to do, whether it be additional training,
supervision of a particular officer or taking some sort of disci
pline."
This is a new procedure for Chicago police officers, accord
ing to Patrick Camden, the deputy director of news affairs for
the CPD. Racial profiling of any kind has been prohibited for at
least the past two years.
"Police officers stop a vehicle based on the observation of
the vehicle, not the individual driving it," Camden said. "But
we're complying with the law that was passed. This is just an
other form that has to be filled out is all."
