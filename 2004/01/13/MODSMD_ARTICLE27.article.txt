# Princeton will cover domestic partners
## 
### BEN POLLAK THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. One day after the
New Jersey Senate's decision to legally recognize gay and
lesbian domestic partners, Princeton University announced
Friday that the Student Health Plan will extend coverage for
same-sex domestic partners.
The University "felt it was the right thing to do," Associ
ate Director of University Health Services Janet Finnie
said.
Only a small portion of the graduate and undergraduate
student body will be affected by the change in Student
Health Plan, but "for those it does effect, it [is] important."
Finnie said the University's announcement was indepen
dent of the State Senate's vote.
On Jan. 9, Director of University Health Services Daniel
Silverman circulated an email authored by Finnie that ex
plained the change.

Finnie said she and other members of the University

community "have been working on [the health plan reform]
for several months."
Various students and campus groups have been instru
mental in enacting this policy change, Finnie said.
Graduate students who live with same-sex partners
raised the issue with Debra Bazarsky, the LGBT Student
Services Coordinator; an active alumni group also brought
the issue to the University's attention, placing special em
phasis on the senate's actions, Finnie said.
"The student health plans operation group recommend
ed [the issue] to the cabinet" and President Tilghman,
Finnie said. "The ultimate decision was in the hands of the
cabinet."
Finnie said the University, which already extends health
coverage to the same-sex partners of employees, felt it was
important to have "consistent policies."
In order to be eligible for the new coverage, couples must
register their same-sex domestic partner with the Universi
ty before enrolling in the Student Health Plan. The period
of enrollment extends until Feb. 27.
