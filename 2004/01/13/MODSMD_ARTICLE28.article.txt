(U-WIRE) LA JOLLA, Calif.
Chilean President Ricardo Lagos received
the UCSD Medal, the highest award grant
ed by the University of California-San
Diego, on Jan. 9. After being presented the
medal by Acting Chancellor Marsha A.
Chandler, Lagos addressed approximately
500 students, dignitaries and other audience
members in a public speech. Later in the
day, the Institute of the Americas also pre
sented Lagos with its Award for Democracy
and Peace.
"Your leadership is something that has
been studied by our students and faculty and
will continue to be studied by many genera
tions to come," Chandler said to Lagos dur
ing the presentation. "You've informed us,
you've educated us, but most importantly,
you've inspired us."
A prominent political figure since the
1980s, Lagos was one of the principle actors
in helping to bring down Chile's dictator,
Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Since his election
in 2000, Lagos has led the country to eco
nomic growth, cutting the country's poverty
rate in half. Lagos studied law at the Uni
versity of Chile and received a doctorate in
economics from Duke University.
"Just the fact that the economy has pros
pered as much as it has, is just inspiring to
other Latin American countries, and it was
interesting to hear some of his opinions,"
said Adriana Ambriz, a Thurgood Marshall
College senior.
During his speech, Lagos spoke about
the necessity of building bridges between his
country and the United States.
"The Americans and Chile belong to one
hemisphere, and we share common values,"
Lagos said. "Those values that we share
make it possible to see in a common way the
future. Now is the time to break down barri
ers that exist among our people."
Lagos also spoke about the different as
pects of his country's growth. He stated that
there are areas of common values in which
the foundation of the bridge can be built
upon, including democracy, human rights,
economic systems and social cohesion.

"The commitment to human rights
means that all of us have to act in a consis
tent manner using democratic methods to
fight against terrorism, because terrorism is
the final expression of denial of human
rights," Lagos said.
Lagos also discussed the importance of
creating strong public policies, including
providing citizens with education and hous
ing. After his speech, Institute of the Amer
icas President Jeffrey Davidow asked Lagos
questions ranging from free-trade agree
ments and the relationship between Cuba
and other countries in Latin America, to the
roles of the United States and the United
Nations.
The Institute of the Americas, an organi
zation working to bring government and
business leaders from the Americas to dis
cuss issues of globalization, governmental
regulations and poverty alleviation, pre
sented its award to Lagos during a luncheon
given in his honor. Established in 1987, the
award recognizes contributions in areas of
democracy, peace and social and economic
reform in the Americas. Other recipients of
the award include President Oscar Arias
Sanchez of Costa Rica, President Carlos
Saul Menem of Argentina and most recent
ly, in 2001, President Ernesto Zedillo of
Mexico.
"Lagos is the principle actor in the
restoration of democracy in Chile and the
promotions of Chile's economic prosperi
ty," Davidow said. "Lagos led his country to
signing a free-trade agreement with the
United States."
Some attendees of the public lecture
commented that the Lagos' speech was
helpful in understanding more about Chile.
Thurgood Marshall College junior Estercita
Aldinger said that although she previously
did not know much about Lagos, his presen
tation helped her discover more about the
country.
"It's refreshing to see a president that ac
tually stands for the ideals that should be
stood for, especially in Latin America where
we lack a lot of good policies that actually
change the country for the better," Aldinger
said. "It seems that Lagos did that."
