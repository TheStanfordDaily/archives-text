# Experts predict Schwarzenegger's budget won't pass
## 
### DMITRI PIKMAN DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES Though Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger just announced the state budget
this Friday, many experts are already saying it will not be
able to pass through the Legislature in its current form.
In order to go into effect on July 15, the proposed
budget must be approved by two-thirds of the state Sen
ate and two-thirds of the Assembly.
With the governor's political party being the minori
ty in the Legislature, experts are predicting major delays
in the approval of the budget.
"There's never a chance for any budget to go through
without some changes. There's at least a couple of mil
lion if not more moving parts to any budget, and
it's our job to react, amend and suggest an alternative
way of going," said Los Angeles Democrat Sheila
Kuehl.
Fiscal experts say, apart from general difficulties
stemming from passing a budget, the particular nature
of this year's budget could also cause some friction when
it comes time for its approval.
"At the end of the day, it's very surprising that, even
with all the cuts, if we look at the gap between spending
and taxes to be collected, we're still looking at about a $6
billion gap that does not narrow," said Daniel Mitchell,
a professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Manage
ment.

He added that since the proposed budget does not
seem to close the tax-to-expenditures gap, it will leave
the issue on the table. Democrats might use this as justi
fication for requesting higher taxes, something
Schwarzenegger promised not to do.
Professor Joel Aberbach, the founding director of
the Center for American Politics and Public Policy, also
said that even though it's too early to speculate on any
bargaining which may occur between the Legislature
and the governor, it is likely that Democrats will oppose
some aspects of the proposed budget.
"Obviously the Democrats would prefer to raise rev
enues to help offset the cuts, or at least some of them, to
make sure the cuts are not so severe," he said.
The cuts proposed by the governor include a shift of
$1.3 billion in property taxes from local governments, al
most $9OO million in cuts to the state's Medi-Cal pro
gram and an $BOO million cut to state programs designed
to bring welfare recipients into the work force.
Education was not spared either, with higher fees for
university and community college students being pro
posed.
Mitchell said not only will the state limit the funding,
it will also monitor very closely where the money is
being used.
"With the money that still trickles down to the
schools, there is a lot of micromanagment happening,"
Mitchell added. "Even though the state is contributing
less and less to support the university, it still controls

where the money will be going."
Another area in which major cuts would be enacted
given the present budget proposal would be health ser
vices.
Jennifer Sigafoos, a public policy analyst for the Cal
ifornia Family Health Council, a non-profit organiza
tion which works to improve access to health services for
all Californians, said the cuts to health-related programs
would be devastating to those who need help most.
"We are very concerned about cuts to programs that
benefit the neediest in our society at a time when our
way of life creates more and more pressure, driving
more people to seek aid through these programs,"
Sigafoos said.
In his budget announcement, the governor proposed
to cap enrollment for "Healthy Families," a program
which provides low-cost health care for children under
19 years of age.
Under the budget proposal, families wishing to enroll
in the program would go on a waiting list, and could only
enroll once a family already participating in "Healthy Fam
ilies" drops out.
Schwarzenegger also proposed a "provider rate" cut,
which would pass the cost of health care from the state to the
individual clinics, many of which would have tremendous
difficulty in bearing these costs, Sigafoos said.
Shawn Martin, a health specialist at the Legislative An
alysts Office, a nonpartisan group responsible for analyzing
the proposed budget, said that though it is hard to accurate

ly estimate the impact of the cuts, the "provider rate" cuts
could potentially have a negative impact on the quality of
health care in the state.
"With the proposed reduction to Medi-Cal provider
rates, some service providers would decide that with the re
duced rates, they would no longer want to participate in the
program," Martin said.
Though the governor previously pledged to protect local
governments from major cuts, in his budget he proposed a
$1.3 billion property tax shift away from local governments.
The governor went on to say that local governments
would be compensated, at least initially, once he rolls back
the vehicle license fee tax enacted by his predecessor, for
mer Gov. Gray Davis. But the governor did not specify the
manner or amount of compensation.
Some members of the Legislature, however, still find
fault with this part of the proposal.
Kuehl said the governor has placed himself in a difficult
position by repealing the car registration tax and that he is
now trying to get out of that pitfall by taking money away
from local governments.
"Cities and counties are still in dire straits ... because of
what the governor did about the auto tax," Kuehl said.
By repealing the registration tax, the governor cost
cities and counties $2 billion this fiscal year, and $4 billion
next fiscal year, she added.
"And now the governor found money to cover that
budget hole in the ... budget(s) of the local govern
ments," Kuehl said.
