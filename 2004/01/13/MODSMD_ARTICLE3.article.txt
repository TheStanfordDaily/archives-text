# Representative Anna Eshoo visits campus to discuss Middle East
## Politician criticizes administration's policies on Iraq 
### ANDREW HENDEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At a town meeting held
at Tresidder last night,
House Democrat Anna
Eshoo the representa
tive from Stanford's dis
trict emphasized the
importance of diplomacy
when it comes to foreign
policy, criticizing a "[Pres
ident George] Bush doc
trine of preemption and
unilateralism."
The event was co-spon
sored by the Stanford De
mocrats and Hillel.
"The greatest tragedy
about the [latest war in
Iraq] is that people are
now saying, 'Well, you
know, if they don't be
have, I guess we'll have to
invade,' but that is not the
case," Eshoo said. "We
have much to do in terms
of our diplomatic arsenal,
our economic arsenal and
our democratic arsenal.
We cannot be trigger
happy."
Eshoo, a member of the
Congressional Committee
on Intelligence, added that
Congress still does not
know about the informa
tion on which Bush based
his decision to go to war.
She also voiced disap
proval about Bush's un
willingness to involve
other nations in the
process of rebuilding Iraq.
"We cannot let arro
gance reign," she said.
Eshoo also questioned
the success of Operation
Iraqi Freedom.
"The war on Iraq has
brought about the capture
of Saddam Hussein and
what has it done for Amer
ica?" she asked.
However, given that

the United States did go to
war in Iraq, Eshoo
stressed the importance of
finishing the nation-re
building process. Eshoo
said that during the Koso
vo War, the Republicans
would come to Congress
every week with proposals
that would set a deadline
for the removal of U.S.
troops.
"We broke it so we have
a responsibility to fix it,"
Eshoo said. "We cannot
set a deadline. Life is not
tidy when it comes to these
things."
Dylan Mefford, presi
dent of the Stanford De
mocrats, brought up the
number of American casu
alties in Iraq.
"If we were to take one
second for each life that
has been lost, we would be
in silence for over eight
minutes," Mefford said.
Although she opposed
the most recent war in

Iraq, Eshoo said the "war
on terrorism is real" and
that the United States
should not be "naive."
Eshoo stressed the im
portance of resolving the
Israel-Palestine conflict as
part of that war on terror
ism. According to Eshoo,
that conflict causes mount
ing tensions, which help
terrorist organizations re
cruit suicide bombers.
"Bush didn't even men
tion Palestine and Israel in
his list of countries to
watch," Eshoo said.
During the question
and-answer session, one
audience member inter
rupted Eshoo while she
was talking about Israel.
The audience member ar
gued that the event's ques
tions were staged and that
Eshoo was only concerned
for Israel.
Eshoo defended herself
by saying that she was not
in favor of everything that

Israel was doing.
"I'm not saying no criti
cism shall ever be leveled
against a democracy," she
said. "That is not what this
is about."
Eshoo ended her
speech by mentioning the
upcoming election.
"It matters how we use
our power," she said. "It
matters how we use our
ideas. It matters whose in
charge. It matters who
goes out and votes."
Several members of the
Stanford Republicans
were present at the event.
Executive Director Ali
Jamal said that Eshoo and
the Republicans share the
same common goal.
"Although we all want
the same end result of
democracy and peace in
the Middle East, the issues
that come into question
are which steps to imple
ment to receive this de
sired effect," he said.

has been lost, we would be
in silence for over eight
minutes," Mefford said.
Although she opposed
the most recent war in

Iraq, Eshoo said the "war
on terrorism is real" and
that the United States
should not be "naive."
Eshoo stressed the im
portance of resolving the
Israel-Palestine conflict as
part of that war on terror
ism. According to Eshoo,
that conflict causes mount
ing tensions, which help
terrorist organizations re
cruit suicide bombers.
"Bush didn't even men
tion Palestine and Israel in
his list of countries to
watch," Eshoo said.
During the question
and-answer session, one
audience member inter
rupted Eshoo while she
was talking about Israel.
The audience member ar
gued that the event's ques
tions were staged and that
Eshoo was only concerned
for Israel.
Eshoo defended herself
by saying that she was not
in favor of everything that

Israel was doing.
"I'm not saying no criti
cism shall ever be leveled
against a democracy," she
said. "That is not what this
is about."
Eshoo ended her
speech by mentioning the
upcoming election.
"It matters how we use
our power," she said. "It
matters how we use our
ideas. It matters whose in
charge. It matters who
goes out and votes."
Several members of the
Stanford Republicans
were present at the event.
Executive Director Ali
Jamal said that Eshoo and
the Republicans share the
same common goal.
"Although we all want
the same end result of
democracy and peace in
the Middle East, the issues
that come into question
are which steps to imple
ment to receive this de
sired effect," he said.
