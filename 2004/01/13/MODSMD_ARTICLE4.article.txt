# Haas offers new faculty prize
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new faculty award, the Miriam Roland
Volunteer Service Prize, has been established
at the Haas Center for Public Service to annu
ally recognize faculty who involve students in
community service. It is the first time that a ser
vice award has been created specifically for fac
ulty, and its $5,000 prize makes it one of the
larger faculty awards.
According to Leonard Ortolano, the direc
tor of the Haas Center, the prize does not point
to a new emphasis on service but rather a new
recognition for faculty involved in service.
"It gives the University the ability to recog
nize those faculty," Ortolano said. "We are
looking forward to the increased attention that
the prize gives to faculty and students engaged

in service."
An Ad Hoc committee involving represen
tatives from all of the University's schools de
termined the criteria for selection, which in
volves "a personal commitment to service" and
a "demonstrated record of involving students
in service." Other factors that were considered
include "innovative approaches to integrating
academic scholarship and volunteer service"
and "the significance of the nominee's contri
butions."
Once the Feb. 13 nomination deadline has
passed, the Haas Center will assemble all of the
applications and submit them to an inter
school selection committee, composed of a
representative from each school. The prize will
be awarded during the Founders / Community
