## Chemotherapy when dinosaurs roamed the Earth? 
### 
Dog-Shaped Asteroid
Astronomers believe that a recently re
discovered asteroid may actually be two.
Hermes was discovered in 1937 and then
not seen for 66 years until the Arecibo
telescope in Puerto Rico found it again. It
is a near-Earth asteroid, measuring be-

tween one and two kilo
meters. This means it
roams the general space
where Earth orbits and
is large enough to cause
global disruption should
it strike our planet (but
rest assured, as
tronomers have calcu
lated it cannot hit the
Earth in the next 100
years). In the next few

days, data from different telescopes will
confirm that Hermes is actually a binary
pair of asteroids or, more unlikely, that it
has the shape of a dog bone. About 16 per
cent of known asteroids are binary pairs.
Dinosaurs suffered from Cancer
For the first time scientists have found
evidence that brain tumors also occurred
in dinosaurs. A team of researchers work
ing in Montana observed what seems like
cancer in the fossilized remains of a crea
ture that died 72 million years ago. "Al
though we haven't conclusively identified
the type of brain tumor found in this spec
imen, we are sure the tumor impaired the
mobility of the dinosaur," said Rachel
Reams, a veterinary pathologist at Eli
Lilly and Co., who participated in the re
search. "It almost certainly affected its
balance and locomotor function," she
added. The finding suggests that problems
affecting human beings today may be
much older and pervasive than previously
though.
New Bird Species Threatened
Scientists have discovered a new bird
species in southeastern Venezuela. It has
been named Carrizal Seedeater, or Amau
rospina carrizalensis, after the islet in the
Caura River where it was found. Males are
light gray with blue feathers whereas fe
males are different shades of brown. Cur
rently only three individuals have been
sighted and scientists have no estimate of
the total population. The discoverers had
little time to celebrate though since a hy
droelectric dam is being built on the Caura
River and can destroy the bird's only
known habitat. Conservation Internation
al has called on the Venezuelan govern
ment to designate the area as a wildlife re
serve.
Gasoline from Plants
Biodiesel may be an alternative to fos
sil fuels to power vehicles. Biodiesel is
diesel oil made from vegetable oils of all
sorts. It was actually developed over a cen
tury ago by Rudolf Diesel, but did not be
come popular because fossil fuels are
cheaper to process. To reduce costs and
make the processing less hazardous, cur
rently many researchers are experiment
ing with enzymes. These would oxidize
oils to make alcohol the same way food is
digested in our stomach. Others are work
ing to reduce the emission of nitrogen
oxide compounds, one of the big disad
vantages of biodiesel. Despite the chal
lenges, enthusiasm is abundant: At the
226 th American Chemical Society Na
tional Meeting in New York eight presen
tations were on biodiesel.
Wave-Particle duality in Molecules
Physicists at the University of Vienna
in Austria observed wave-particle duality
in a biomolecule. Photons, or the compo
nents of light, have long been known to
have a dual nature but this is the first time
this phenomenon has been observed in a
biological system. In their experiment the
researchers passed porphyrin molecules
through three diffraction gratings and ob
served interference fringe patterns char
acteristic of quantum behavior. The big
picture: Reality may be much more com
plex than what we think in terms of classi
cal physics.
World's Largest Cosmic-Ray Detector
With the completion of its 100 th detec
tor, the Pierre Auger Observatory is now
the biggest cosmic-ray detector in the
world. The $55 million observatory is
being constructed in the Pampa Amarilla
in western Argentina, with the collabora
tion of 14 countries. Upon it completion in
2005, Pierre Auger will have 1,600 detec
tors and 24 fluorescence telescopes. Each
detector will be separated by 1.5 kilome
ters, thus occupying a total area of 3,000
square kilometers, making it the largest
experiment ever built. The main use of the
observatory will be study how and where
cosmic rays from outer space achieve their
ultra high energies.
