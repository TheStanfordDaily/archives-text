# SHAKEN – NOT STIRRED
## New earthquake research center seeks to get to the bottom of one of the planet's oldest mysteries. 
### CAMILLE RICKETS STAFF WRITER 
It's Oct. 17,1989,5:04 p.m.: A 7.0 earthquake rocks the San Francisco Bay, killing close
to 70 people and leaving fires, rockslides and a giant crack in the Bay Bridge in its wake.
Known as the Loma Prieta quake, this shaker resulted from a slip in the San Andreas fault.
Today, this fault line is not only the Bay Area's greatest earthquake threat, but also its best
hope for understanding, and maybe even predicting, future quakes.
After more than a decade of preparation, the ambitious San Andres Fault Observato
ry at Depth is a reality. A team effort between Stanford and the United States Geological
Survey, the observatory will allow scientists to, well, observe earthquakes where they
begin—below the earth's surface. The $20.5 million project is the first of its kind and
promises to answer longstanding questions left unsatisfied by computerized models and
past excavations.
"The research many people do around the world on earthquakes is done from the per
spective of the laboratory," says Mark Zoback, Stanford professor of geophysics and a pri
mary investigator for the project. "The San Andreas project will do two things. First, it will
address problems that have arisen from other studies and look at exactly what is going on
underground at the fault while measuring it as it is happening. Second, we will observe what
happens right before the fault begins to rupture."
He adds," [The observatory] is not necessarily there to predict earthquakes, but rather to
determine whether they are predictable."
The observatory will eventually be located 2.4 miles below the surface after three years
of drilling. The project has leased the site of the center, located on a small ranch outside of
Parkfield, Calif., for 20 years, during which time researchers will be able to collect data 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Parkfield, located between Los Angeles and San Francis
co, was selected as a site of continuous movement, allowing for continuous yet small 2.0
quakes. Zoback stresses the importance of the San Andreas fault and its implication for
California residents. He says that although it is always tricky to apply findings to other sites,
the fault is a good starting point.
"We are going to measure all sorts of things about the forces in the earth that have been
speculated about, the pressure of fluids and so on," Zoback says. "It has been predicted that
there is very high fluid pressure within the fault. But we don't know if this is true, or where
these fluids come from. We will be able to measure if the pressure is high or low. When the
pressure goes up its more likely to initiate and earthquake."
Fluid pressure is just one of many hypotheses the observatory will tackle once drilling is
underway. In 2002, the project created a 1.4-mile-deep "pilot hole," and installed instru
ments to monitor pressure, temperature, seismic waves and many other variables. All of the
equipment is designed to withstand severe shaking. This initial effort helped observatory
researchers work out kinks in the system before attacking the main hole.
The San Andreas fault divides the Pacific and North American tectonic plates currently
moving in opposite directions. Quakes are produced when these plates slide against each
other. The drilling for the main borehole will start on the Pacific plate and continue along
an L-shape. The final hole will be three miles long. The last segment of the hole will extend
into the North American plate. The drilling will occur across three summers, concluding in
September of 2007.
"Earthquakes start miles below ground," William Ellsworth, chief scientist for the ob
servatory's Earthquake Hazards team, told the Stanford News Service. "Faults may rupture
at the surface in large earthquakes, but the place where the forces are stored and released
are deep within the fault. The observatory hole will go deep enough to get into the heart of
the fault zone, where earthquakes really begin."
The San Andreas fault poses more of a threat is some locations than others. Zoback
compares the fault to a block being pulled by a spring. The block can move in either two
ways, either snapping back quickly after tension builds, or simply sliding at the same pace
as the spring. In some areas, such as Parkfield, the fault moves at an even pace, yet at oth
ers, drastic motion is needed to release years of mounting stress.
"The Pacific plate is moving roughly four centimeters a year," Zoback says. "After 100
years, it has four meters to catch up, which would mean a magnitude, seven plus earth
quake."
Zoback anticipates that the observatory will present opportunities to both faculty mem
bers and students, commenting that the site, "complements both our teaching and research
mission." The center will likely become a hub for class field trips, and even undergraduate
research.
Naomi Boness, a doctoral candidate in geophysics spent the summer of 2002 managing
data collected from the pilot hole. Joined by other grad students who helped her compile a
comprehensive database now available to scientists around the world, Boness realized what
a great opportunity the observatory project presents to students at all levels of study.
"The amount of data we are collecting is so extensive that there would be opportunities
galore," she says, adding that the amount of existing data would allow students to design

ments to monitor pressure, temperature, seismic waves and many other variables. All of the
equipment is designed to withstand severe shaking. This initial effort helped observatory
researchers work out kinks in the system before attacking the main hole.
The San Andreas fault divides the Pacific and North American tectonic plates currently
moving in opposite directions. Quakes are produced when these plates slide against each
other. The drilling for the main borehole will start on the Pacific plate and continue along
an L-shape. The final hole will be three miles long. The last segment of the hole will extend
into the North American plate. The drilling will occur across three summers, concluding in
September of 2007.
"Earthquakes start miles below ground," William Ellsworth, chief scientist for the ob
servatory's Earthquake Hazards team, told the Stanford News Service. "Faults may rupture
at the surface in large earthquakes, but the place where the forces are stored and released
are deep within the fault. The observatory hole will go deep enough to get into the heart of
the fault zone, where earthquakes really begin."
The San Andreas fault poses more of a threat is some locations than others. Zoback
compares the fault to a block being pulled by a spring. The block can move in either two
ways, either snapping back quickly after tension builds, or simply sliding at the same pace
as the spring. In some areas, such as Parkfield, the fault moves at an even pace, yet at oth
ers, drastic motion is needed to release years of mounting stress.
"The Pacific plate is moving roughly four centimeters a year," Zoback says. "After 100
years, it has four meters to catch up, which would mean a magnitude, seven plus earth
quake."
Zoback anticipates that the observatory will present opportunities to both faculty mem
bers and students, commenting that the site, "complements both our teaching and research
mission." The center will likely become a hub for class field trips, and even undergraduate
research.
Naomi Boness, a doctoral candidate in geophysics spent the summer of 2002 managing
data collected from the pilot hole. Joined by other grad students who helped her compile a
comprehensive database now available to scientists around the world, Boness realized what
a great opportunity the observatory project presents to students at all levels of study.
"The amount of data we are collecting is so extensive that there would be opportunities
galore," she says, adding that the amount of existing data would allow students to design

It's Oct. 17,1989,5:04 p.m.: A 7.0 earthquake rocks the San Francisco Bay, killing close
to 70 people and leaving fires, rockslides and a giant crack in the Bay Bridge in its wake.
Known as the Loma Prieta quake, this shaker resulted from a slip in the San Andreas fault.
Today, this fault line is not only the Bay Area's greatest earthquake threat, but also its best
hope for understanding, and maybe even predicting, future quakes.
After more than a decade of preparation, the ambitious San Andres Fault Observato
ry at Depth is a reality. A team effort between Stanford and the United States Geological
Survey, the observatory will allow scientists to, well, observe earthquakes where they
begin—below the earth's surface. The $20.5 million project is the first of its kind and
promises to answer longstanding questions left unsatisfied by computerized models and
past excavations.
"The research many people do around the world on earthquakes is done from the per
spective of the laboratory," says Mark Zoback, Stanford professor of geophysics and a pri
mary investigator for the project. "The San Andreas project will do two things. First, it will
address problems that have arisen from other studies and look at exactly what is going on
underground at the fault while measuring it as it is happening. Second, we will observe what
happens right before the fault begins to rupture."
He adds," [The observatory] is not necessarily there to predict earthquakes, but rather to
determine whether they are predictable."
The observatory will eventually be located 2.4 miles below the surface after three years
of drilling. The project has leased the site of the center, located on a small ranch outside of
Parkfield, Calif., for 20 years, during which time researchers will be able to collect data 24
hours a day, seven days a week. Parkfield, located between Los Angeles and San Francis
co, was selected as a site of continuous movement, allowing for continuous yet small 2.0
quakes. Zoback stresses the importance of the San Andreas fault and its implication for
California residents. He says that although it is always tricky to apply findings to other sites,
the fault is a good starting point.
"We are going to measure all sorts of things about the forces in the earth that have been
speculated about, the pressure of fluids and so on," Zoback says. "It has been predicted that
there is very high fluid pressure within the fault. But we don't know if this is true, or where
these fluids come from. We will be able to measure if the pressure is high or low. When the
pressure goes up its more likely to initiate and earthquake."
