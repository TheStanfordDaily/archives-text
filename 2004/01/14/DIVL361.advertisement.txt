Seeking Common Ground
illuminates puzzles about
democracy in education and
chronic conflicts that contin
ue to make news. Americans
mistrusted government, yet
they entrusted the civic edu
cation of their children to
public schools. American his
tory textbooks were notori
ously dull, but they were also
highly controversial.
Although the people liked
local control of schools, edu
cational experts called it
"democracy gone to seed"
and campaigned to "take the
schools out of politics."
Reformers argued about
whether it was more
democratic to teach all stu
dents the same subjects or to
tailor curriculum to individu
als. And what was the best
way to "Americanize" immi
grants, asked educators: by
forced-fed assimilation or by
honoring their ethnic her
itages?
