### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Award-winning journalist and
Stanford Report editor James
Robinson died of non-Hodgkins
lymphoma yesterday at the age of
44. Robinson served as the associate

director of the Stan
ford News Service
and was editor of
the University's fac
ulty / staff newspa
per.
"Our communi
ty is profoundly
saddened by the
loss of James
Robinson," said
University Presi
dent John Hen
nessy. "He touched
many of us with his
professional and
personal integrity,
and we will always
be inspired by his
courageous fight

against cancer."
Robinson came to the University
in 1998 after establishing himself as a
top daily newspaper journalist
through reporting positions at the

Springfield Republican, the Hart
ford Courant, the Houston Chroni
cle and Agence France-Presse.
"We will all miss his wit, his
warmth, his vitality and his wicked
intellect. But most of all, we will just
miss him," said Elaine Ray, director
of the Stanford News Service.

Under his editor
ship, the Stanford fac
ulty / staff paper won
the Gold Medal for
Excellence from the
Chronicle for the Ad
vancement and Sup
port of Education
(CASE) in 2002.
"Although James
will be deeply missed
by his colleagues, we
are fortunate that his
presence will live on
in the words he wrote
and the many friend
ships he made," Hen
nessy said.
Robinson was
admired by the com-

munity for his skill as a newspaper
reporter.
"James was the consummate


James Robinson
newspaperman who also had a keen
understanding of the intricacies and
idiosyncrasies of higher education,"
said Ray. "He challenged our staff to
reach into their creative reserves to
give Stanford Report and Stanford
Report Online a more dynamic and
organic look and feel. Under his
guidance the News Service's publi
cations flourished without losing

their journalistic edge."
Robinson was a Romance lan
guage polyglot. As a certified inter
preter, he spoke French, Italian and
Spanish fluently.
A native of Newton, Mass., he
loved travel from an early age. When
he was 12, he spent six months trav
eling around France. At the same
time, he began his career in journal
ism, joining the staff of the Newton
Times when he was only 13 years old.
He worked as a volunteer, setting
headlines for the non-profit newspa
per. He was co-editor of the Newton

South High School newspaper.
He traveled further in Italy, Spain
and France while he was a student at
Wesleyan University. Upon gradu
ating, he went to Georgetown Uni
versity, where he was certified as a si
multaneous interpreter. From there,
he attended Columbia University's
School of Journalism. There, he
earned his master's degree in 1985
and received the John McHugh
Award for a radio documentary on
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.
He covered numerous issues dur
ing his multi-lingual career, includ

ing the Loma Prieta earthquake and
the Olympics in Albertville, France.
"James had a caring nature and
spirit of adventure that served him well
in his journalism career and earned
him devoted friends all over the coun
try. His resilience was inspiring," said
long time friend Rick Berke and editor
at the New York Times.
A memorial will be held at 4 p.m.
on Friday at Memorial Church. A
fund has been established to support
the James S. Robinson Award for
Student Journalists at Stanford Uni
versity.
