# The
						lowdown on the O.C.

2 I'm from "the 0.C.," and
while Orange County of
fers plenty of opportunities
to fight reprobate young
ys and flaunt my luxurious
upper-middle class lifestyle, I'm
bored much of the time. Three weeks
for Winter Break were bad

enough; I'll die if I have to
spend the entire summer at
home. I'd really like to travel
internationally. What does
Stanford have to offer me?
A I can sympathize: I,
/I too, am from "the
/ 1 0.C.," and while
X new teen
drama glorifies our county,
life in Orange is actually quite

humble. My typical Saturday night at
home consists of either a movie out
with friends or mindless vandalism.
It's a good thing that you're start
ing to think about this early; now's the
time. Stanford offers an array of
overseas opportunities, and many are
either free or nearly free.
If you're a sophomore (or even if
you're not), you can start checking out
your options at the Sophomore Reori
entation tonight in the Arrillaga
Alumni Center at 8 p.m. The Bechtel

International Center, Undergraduate
Research Programs and others will
have information booths there.
Another good opportunity pre
sents itself (Like my careful avoid
ance of the passive tense?) on Jan. 14
in the form of Stanford in Govern
ment's 2004 Fellowship Night. SIG

offers paid internships to cool
places like the World Bank in
Mexico and NGOs in Africa.
A caveat: remember applying
to college? Applying to some
SIG international fellowships
can be just as selective. And if
you're a freshman, just forget
it.
More? Check the Haas
Center. The awkward for
eign spelling of its name just

goes to show you how international
can be. It houses groups like Volun
teers in Latin America, Volunteers in
Asia, and Project Dosti, which sends
volunteers to India.
Good luck with your search. If
you fail, don't despair: go hunt down
a ridiculously attractive Newport
Beach girl and take her to Tijuana
for a mid-year's Chrismukka cele
bration. Or ask Answer Girl for
more suggestions. I'm sure she's not
busy.
