## Course Guide gets an incomplete

At long last, the student staff of the
ASSU Course Guide have begun to
update their Web site. In theory, the
Web site is a useful compilation of stu

world, people are not paid when they do not do
the job they were hired for. We hope that things
will be different this year.

about Stanford classes.
But in practice, the site
has long been out of date,
and some students have
lost confidence in this
service.
According to current
and former directors of the
Course Guide, the outdat
ed data is due to misman
agement and technical
problems. While we are
happy that the Guide is cur
rently being updated, the
fact that the Guide lay un
tended for a year is distress
ing. The student body paid

The problems with the
ASSU Course Guide are
not all recent, however.
This page has not endorsed
the organization for Spe
cial Fee support since 2000,
when it praised the new
technology that tied the
Course Guide to the Time
Schedule. But the brand
new technology of 2000 did
not continue to impress
this newspaper's Editorial
Board, which has noted
every year since 2001 that
the site has only been up
dated sporadically, and
that it is not as useful as it
could be because of the de-

rate, functioning course guide during academic year
2002-2003, and the organization did not live up to its
promises.
In the recent past, updating of the Course
Guide has been spotty, with science classes kept
more current than humanities and social science
evaluations because of the Course Guide's close
connection to the Tau Beta Pi Engineering hon
ors society. To update only the science classes of
the Course Guide is to not live up to the very mis
sion of the organization it is as if The Stanford
Daily only published on Tuesdays and Fridays
because our friends at The Stanford Progressive
decided to help us out on those days.
What's more, last year the leaders of the
Course Guide continued to collect their salary as
if everything was running fine. This is unethical at

caying technology underlying the system.
Student confidence in the Course Guide is not
very high, and for good reason. Senate Chair Josh
Shipp took a positive step when he put a hold on
the Course Guide's bank account last week. Not
ing that "There needs to be more accountability
and institutionalization," Shipp is taking the ini
tiative to make sure that students will have a use
ful, up-to-date and accurate Course Guide in the
future.
We hope that he will be able to help the orga
nizers of the Course Guide update this woefully
out-of-date site, and that closer oversight by the
ASSU will lead to a more accountable organiza
tion. Students pay for this service; if they aren't
benefiting from the Course Guide, then student
money is being wasted.
