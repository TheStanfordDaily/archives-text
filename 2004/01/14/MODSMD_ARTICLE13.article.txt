## MINDFUL MUSINGS In search of greener grass 
### 
One December morning,
while many kids went to
school to learn their
ABC's and master their
multiplication tables, little girls and
boys in California such as Maria and
Juan stayed home. The reason?
Their parents were part of an eco
nomic boycott protesting the repeal
of a law that allowed undocument
ed immigrants a.k.a. illegal
aliens to apply for and receive
driver's licenses. Juan's parents
didn't go to work that day, so they
stayed home to take care of the kids,
hoping that their efforts would con
vince American legislators and
politicians the importance of the il
legal immigration labor force in
California. Unfortunately, the
protest had little impact, as a rela
tively small number of people par
ticipated, but the message was clear:
Illegal immigration is a key issue
that needs to be attended to urgent
ly. As The Daily mentioned in its
editorial yesterday ("Illegal immi
grants deserve help," Jan. 13) politi
cians are scrambling to deal with
this central topic, and President
George W. Bush is eager to push it
into the agenda, improving his rat
ings with Hispanic voters.
Sure, some might say, shrugging
their shoulders, but it doesn't affect
me, so why should I care? Many
harbor resentment toward illegal
immigrants, but the fact is that the
demand for this labor source exists:
They work in thousands of restau
rants and cafes, take care of kids
and housework in homes around
the country and toil away at con
struction sites, often taking jobs at
lower pay than American citizens
are willing to receive. And while
many immigrants use social services
such as welfare, they're not neces
sarily getting a free ride. A study
published by the Center for Urban
Economic Development at the Uni
versity of Illinois at Chicago recent
ly demonstrated that nearly 70 per
cent of undocumented workers paid
payroll taxes such as Social Security
and unemployment insurance.
It is the quintessential search
for the greener grass, the precious
green card in this instance. So then

you may ask: Why don't they just
do it the legal way? Legal immigra
tion into the United States is not
easy, and I can speak from person
al experience here. As I'm sure
many international students will
agree, visas are expensive and diffi
cult to obtain, and the processing
for permanent resident status and
citizenship is also costly and time
intensive. Long lines, piles of pa-

perwork and a
complicated pro
cess awaits any
one trying to live
and/or work in
the States. I cur
rently live in the
United States
with a green
card, and trust
me, that little
card (which isn't

actually green) is worth its weight
in gold, considering how difficult it
was to obtain. The process will only
become more difficult as national
security issues increase, and more
extensive processing and back
ground checks will only mean two
things: more time to wait and more
money to pay.
With all of these hurdles to
jump, there are millions of immi
grants who simply cannot afford ev
erything legal immigration implies -
thus working and here illegally. The
promise of a better job, financial se
curity and better education for the
kids overrides the many risks asso
ciated with illegal immigration. In
Mexico, a worked might earn as lit
tle as $4 in one day, whereas here
even receiving a salary below the
minimum wage workers can at
least make eight to 10 times that
amount.
So what has the government
done about this issue? In past years,
amnesties were granted to illegal
immigrants, offering legal status
and citizenship to most workers in
the States. The 1986 program fo
cused on penalizing employers who
hired illegal immigrants rather than
punishing the employees. Critics ar
gued that this only increased illegal
immigration after this period, as
workers from abroad would rely on
occasional amnesties and would be

more likely to live and/or work in
the States illegally. Currently, as
The Daily mentioned yesterday,
President Bush has proposed a plan
to offer renewable three-year tem
porary work visas to immigrant
workers, imposing a fee to those
who are currently in the U.S. illegal
ly and offered for free to those who
apply from abroad. After they are
finished with their work visa status,
they will get "financial incentives"
to go home.
Will it work? The Daily is right
in advocating the proposal, but it
may not be the best route, at least in
the long term. It provides a tempo
rary solution, but needs a more
complete follow-up program that
addresses the problem once the
visas expire, assisting those who
want to apply for a more permanent
status. If immigrants find little or no
help with immigration once their
temporary legal status expires, they
will continue to stay in the United
States illegally, and we'll be right
back to square one.
Keep in mind that we cannot
consider this population as an "ex
pendable" work force. People make
great efforts to come to live in the
United States. They move their en
tire families here and enroll their
kids in schools. They try to learn the
language. We can't just kick them
out once they've "fulfilled" their
purpose. This simply isn't socially
responsible business practice. Ad
ditionally, outreach programs to in
form immigrants about the propos
al will need to be culturally sensitive
and offered in multilingual format
in order to serve those who need it
the most.
This is clearly a complicated
issue, and I applaud the Bush ad
ministration (for once!) for bringing
it to the table, but it needs further
development. The United States
may indeed offer greener grass for
many people, but only good man
agement will ensure that we all ben
efit in the end.
