Senior class presidents express
commitment to classmates

We are writing to express our
deep commitment and dedication to
the senior class as well as concerns
about Monday's editorial ("Class
presidents need to update seniors,"
Jan. 12).
In an e-mail sent to our class
members Monday morning, we in
cluded the statement that we origi
nally told a Daily reporter a few days
before the editorial was published.
We stated that, "Shayna has elected
to take one quarter off from her role
as senior class president for academ
ic and personal reasons. We fully
support her during this time, and
look forward to having her rejoin
our slate and executive cabinet in
the spring."
We wished the editorial board
would have taken this into account
in its editorial when it wrote, "Over
the course of the past week. . . .
[Shayna] has been deleted from the
signature line of the class presi
dents'] e-mail account." It has been
over one month since we quietly re
moved her contact information.
And in another statement by The
Daily: "We do not need or want to
know the intimate details of why
Fernandez resigned." Our original
statement to you repeated in the
second paragraph should have
thus addressed all concerns suffi
ciently, especially conflicting state
ments like, "The Senior Class has a
right to know why one of its elected
leaders has stepped down from her
post." Had our original statement
been printed, this question would
not have to have been asked.
All four class presidents dis
cussed and agreed that a campus
wide announcement was not in the

best interest of the affected parties.
We were confident that our class
mates would instead be more con
cerned with the events and pro
grams that were being organized for
the senior class. Also, our assurance
that Shayna would be rejoining our
team in the spring allowed us to
make the decision that the small
time-frame in which she would be
gone was a small enough issue to not
bring up. We acknowledge that by
not being upfront about the deci
sion, we deprived those members of
our class who are curious enough to
know the details of our leadership
structure the information they de
serve. For this, we sincerely apolo
gize.
The three of us are truly hon
ored to continue pouring our energy
and effort into working for the Se
nior Class. We are excited to bring
the Class of 'O4 two quarters more
eclectic and exciting than the last.
While we are capable of handling
the redistribution of work this quar
ter, our job difficulty is further dif
fused by the help of our very capable
executive cabinet, which consists of
10 vice-presidents in charge of the
areas of social events, community
service, academic and career pro
grams, Senior Gift, publicity, media
and communications, promotions,
Commencement and special affairs,
networking and strategic alliances
and public relations. We hope that
seniors will recall the career events,
pub nights, community service
events and even last week's sold-out
pub crawl as memorable highlights
of fall quarter and that they look
forward to those of the near future
like this week's senior shirt event
and February's semi-formal.
In the meantime, Shayna will
continue to contribute to the Senior

Class with other endeavors such as
Senior Wills and a "101 Things To
Do Before You Graduate" initiative
tailored to the Class of 'O4 (details
can be found later this quarter on
our Web site, http://www.stan
ford2oo4.com). This will further
complement our overarching mis
sion to provide our classmates with
an enriching and undeniably memo
rable senior year. The three of us
will continue to be available to an
swer questions and update the class
twice a week as we have been doing
since September 2003.

Meningitis information
Invaluable'

As a parent who has lost a col
lege-age student to vaccine-pre
ventable meningococcal meningitis,
and as Executive Director of the Na
tional Meningitis Association, I
want to thank you and commend
you for the great editorial you ran
("Meningitis is not your friend," Jan
9).
The information that you are
providing to your students is invalu
able, especially the statement, "We
encourage all students to invest in
the meningitis vaccine it will pro
tect you and others." We wish that
other college health centers had the
same proactive position as does Dr.
Friedman.

Meningitis information
Invaluable'

As a parent who has lost a col
lege-age student to vaccine-pre
ventable meningococcal meningitis,
and as Executive Director of the Na
tional Meningitis Association, I
want to thank you and commend
you for the great editorial you ran
("Meningitis is not your friend," Jan
9).
The information that you are
providing to your students is invalu
able, especially the statement, "We
encourage all students to invest in
the meningitis vaccine it will pro
tect you and others." We wish that
other college health centers had the
same proactive position as does Dr.
Friedman.

formation. Thank you.

Senior class presidents express
commitment to classmates

We are writing to express our
deep commitment and dedication to
the senior class as well as concerns
about Monday's editorial ("Class
presidents need to update seniors,"
Jan. 12).
In an e-mail sent to our class
members Monday morning, we in
cluded the statement that we origi
nally told a Daily reporter a few days
before the editorial was published.
We stated that, "Shayna has elected
to take one quarter off from her role
as senior class president for academ
ic and personal reasons. We fully
support her during this time, and
look forward to having her rejoin
our slate and executive cabinet in
the spring."
We wished the editorial board
would have taken this into account
in its editorial when it wrote, "Over
the course of the past week. . . .
[Shayna] has been deleted from the
signature line of the class presi
dents'] e-mail account." It has been
over one month since we quietly re
moved her contact information.
And in another statement by The
Daily: "We do not need or want to
know the intimate details of why
Fernandez resigned." Our original
statement to you repeated in the
second paragraph should have
thus addressed all concerns suffi
ciently, especially conflicting state
ments like, "The Senior Class has a
right to know why one of its elected
leaders has stepped down from her
post." Had our original statement
been printed, this question would
not have to have been asked.
All four class presidents dis
cussed and agreed that a campus
wide announcement was not in the

best interest of the affected parties.
We were confident that our class
mates would instead be more con
cerned with the events and pro
grams that were being organized for
the senior class. Also, our assurance
that Shayna would be rejoining our
team in the spring allowed us to
make the decision that the small
time-frame in which she would be
gone was a small enough issue to not
bring up. We acknowledge that by
not being upfront about the deci
sion, we deprived those members of
our class who are curious enough to
know the details of our leadership
structure the information they de
serve. For this, we sincerely apolo
gize.
The three of us are truly hon
ored to continue pouring our energy
and effort into working for the Se
nior Class. We are excited to bring
the Class of 'O4 two quarters more
eclectic and exciting than the last.
While we are capable of handling
the redistribution of work this quar
ter, our job difficulty is further dif
fused by the help of our very capable
executive cabinet, which consists of
10 vice-presidents in charge of the
areas of social events, community
service, academic and career pro
grams, Senior Gift, publicity, media
and communications, promotions,
Commencement and special affairs,
networking and strategic alliances
and public relations. We hope that
seniors will recall the career events,
pub nights, community service
events and even last week's sold-out
pub crawl as memorable highlights
of fall quarter and that they look
forward to those of the near future
like this week's senior shirt event
and February's semi-formal.
In the meantime, Shayna will
continue to contribute to the Senior

Class with other endeavors such as
Senior Wills and a "101 Things To
Do Before You Graduate" initiative
tailored to the Class of 'O4 (details
can be found later this quarter on
our Web site, http://www.stan
ford2oo4.com). This will further
complement our overarching mis
sion to provide our classmates with
an enriching and undeniably memo
rable senior year. The three of us
will continue to be available to an
swer questions and update the class
twice a week as we have been doing
since September 2003.
