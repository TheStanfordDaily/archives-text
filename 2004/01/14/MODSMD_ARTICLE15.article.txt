## Modern day technological change threatens winter holidays 
### 
No one has better captured the meaning of
human existence in nature than Henry
David Thoreau in "Walden," a book that
includes the line: "I went to the woods because I
wished to live deliberately, to front only the es
sential facts of life, and see if I could not learn
what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived."
The concern did not lie in missing a weekend
ski trip to Heavenly. It did not lie in bombing
down the resort's most challenging bowl. It did
not even lie in forgetting to take a picture of
Lake Tahoe. No. It was to have missed feeling
the whole body shiver from a lungful of crisp
mountain air. It was to have missed letting the
world fade away beneath six inches of fresh
plow. It was to have never sat at a mountain sum
mit, look out over the Sierras and instantly un
destand all that there was to understand. It was

to have missed out on some
thing that once experienced,
no one else could ever take
away: emotion.
That emotion is now en
capsulated in a microchip.
That microchip is now em
bedded inside the Head Ski
Company's latest and great
est model released this past
December, the Cyber iC3OO.

What's a computer doing in a ski? Making
"riding and taming the mountain easier," ac
cording to those who designed the ski and eye
witness news reporters who tested it. Head built
the iC3OO with an overly-exaggerated width in
the tip and tail to allow for sharper turns as well
as greater rebound and resulting velocity, essen
tially creating a ski that turns itself. However,
such an extreme sidecut leads to instability in the
iC3OO the main reason no other company has
constructed such a dramatically shaped model
causing the ski's core to twist and inherently
lead to the rider's lack of control and imminent
endangerment.
So Head built into the iC3OO an electronic
chip to sense and counteract excessive lateral
torque by sending bursts of electrical pulses
down its length. The result: A product con
sumers can purchase for $1,300 and try to keep
up with as the ski turns, stabilizes and absorbs
terrain without the use of knees and thighs old
models once sacrificed. The iC3OO has systemat
ically rendered the skier an optional accessory,
an accessory that has the model on back order
through the spring.
It doesn't make sense though computer
skis on top of the winter sports world. The same
sport that unofficially boasted a hearty Pilsner as
its thirst quencher of choice. The same sport
whose most notorious athlete, Alberto Tomba,
could be found at the center of the party with a
snow bunny on each arm the night before each of
the four Olympic games he medalled in. The
same sport that lived and breathed going back to
Walden Woods.
Sure the iC3OO is helping thousands of skiers
jump from intermediate to advanced at the ching
of every Ski Barn cash register. And sure people
are making better turns, skiing faster and are
more technically sound than ever. But that's ex
actly what's wrong.
Skiing values have shifted from apres hob
nobbing to scientific performance. A skiing ad in
a 1968 Sports Illustrated issue features a moun
tain man cruising the slopes with a cigarette
hanging from his lip. A skiing ad from a 2000
issue now reads "There's time to rest when
you're dead."
The leisure sport of skiing must be dozing in a
king size bed somewhere beside Thoreau be
cause it's been dead now for years. Performance
is in. Quality is out. Quantity is in. Ski trips last a
weekend if you're lucky. There's a SUV priced
and sized for everyone on the planet and a near
by superhighway to take them to the mountains.
Winter clothing is not just warm anymore but
waterproof, windproof, ripstop and available for
the whole family. There's a shaped ski for any
and every caliber sportsman, and a highspeed 6-
person lift to spit them out at any summit 30
times a day. There are 10 different "carve better"
classes to take, ultra carb lite beers for the seri
ous winter athlete, slopeside villages that bed
tens of thousands a night, travel packages to get
to any mountain from anywhere and walkie
talkies to keep us connected the entire time.
The performance-focused technology intri
cately woven through every ski resort, though,
has done everything but connect the skier to liv
ing. Transcendentalists journey to the wilder
ness to find the exact technological society from
which they sought refuge, where the tacit law of
efficiency, performance and technology rules
the land and the concept of leisure, taking in a
lungful of Sierra mountain air and letting oneself
figure out everything there is to understand
about the world in an afternoon bears a heavy
stigma.
The legs still burn at the end of a long run
from riding skis that can find their own way
down the trail, but no longer from working the
mountain and life for all it's worth. Going to the
woods no longer entails going anywhere at all
and that little microchip in Head's newest prod
uct is just a small reminder.

ski trip to Heavenly. It did not lie in bombing
down the resort's most challenging bowl. It did
not even lie in forgetting to take a picture of
Lake Tahoe. No. It was to have missed feeling
the whole body shiver from a lungful of crisp
mountain air. It was to have missed letting the
world fade away beneath six inches of fresh
plow. It was to have never sat at a mountain sum
mit, look out over the Sierras and instantly un
destand all that there was to understand. It was

to have missed out on some
thing that once experienced,
no one else could ever take
away: emotion.
That emotion is now en
capsulated in a microchip.
That microchip is now em
bedded inside the Head Ski
Company's latest and great
est model released this past
December, the Cyber iC3OO.

What's a computer doing in a ski? Making
"riding and taming the mountain easier," ac
cording to those who designed the ski and eye
witness news reporters who tested it. Head built
the iC3OO with an overly-exaggerated width in
the tip and tail to allow for sharper turns as well
as greater rebound and resulting velocity, essen
tially creating a ski that turns itself. However,
such an extreme sidecut leads to instability in the
iC3OO the main reason no other company has
constructed such a dramatically shaped model
causing the ski's core to twist and inherently
lead to the rider's lack of control and imminent
endangerment.
So Head built into the iC3OO an electronic
chip to sense and counteract excessive lateral
torque by sending bursts of electrical pulses
down its length. The result: A product con
sumers can purchase for $1,300 and try to keep
up with as the ski turns, stabilizes and absorbs
terrain without the use of knees and thighs old
models once sacrificed. The iC3OO has systemat
ically rendered the skier an optional accessory,
an accessory that has the model on back order
through the spring.
It doesn't make sense though computer
skis on top of the winter sports world. The same
sport that unofficially boasted a hearty Pilsner as
its thirst quencher of choice. The same sport
whose most notorious athlete, Alberto Tomba,
could be found at the center of the party with a
snow bunny on each arm the night before each of
the four Olympic games he medalled in. The
same sport that lived and breathed going back to
Walden Woods.
Sure the iC3OO is helping thousands of skiers
jump from intermediate to advanced at the ching
of every Ski Barn cash register. And sure people
are making better turns, skiing faster and are
more technically sound than ever. But that's ex
actly what's wrong.
Skiing values have shifted from apres hob
nobbing to scientific performance. A skiing ad in
a 1968 Sports Illustrated issue features a moun
tain man cruising the slopes with a cigarette
hanging from his lip. A skiing ad from a 2000
issue now reads "There's time to rest when
you're dead."
The leisure sport of skiing must be dozing in a
king size bed somewhere beside Thoreau be
cause it's been dead now for years. Performance
is in. Quality is out. Quantity is in. Ski trips last a
weekend if you're lucky. There's a SUV priced
and sized for everyone on the planet and a near
by superhighway to take them to the mountains.
Winter clothing is not just warm anymore but
waterproof, windproof, ripstop and available for
the whole family. There's a shaped ski for any
and every caliber sportsman, and a highspeed 6-
person lift to spit them out at any summit 30
times a day. There are 10 different "carve better"
classes to take, ultra carb lite beers for the seri
ous winter athlete, slopeside villages that bed
tens of thousands a night, travel packages to get
to any mountain from anywhere and walkie
talkies to keep us connected the entire time.
The performance-focused technology intri
cately woven through every ski resort, though,
has done everything but connect the skier to liv
ing. Transcendentalists journey to the wilder
ness to find the exact technological society from
which they sought refuge, where the tacit law of
efficiency, performance and technology rules
the land and the concept of leisure, taking in a
lungful of Sierra mountain air and letting oneself
figure out everything there is to understand
about the world in an afternoon bears a heavy
stigma.
The legs still burn at the end of a long run
from riding skis that can find their own way
down the trail, but no longer from working the
mountain and life for all it's worth. Going to the
woods no longer entails going anywhere at all
and that little microchip in Head's newest prod
uct is just a small reminder.

No one has better captured the meaning of
human existence in nature than Henry
David Thoreau in "Walden," a book that
includes the line: "I went to the woods because I
wished to live deliberately, to front only the es
sential facts of life, and see if I could not learn
what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived."
