# Men show promise despite losses
## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Coach Don Shaw, the per
formance of the Stanford men's
volleyball team (2-2) this week
end was indicative of the hard
play against fierce competition
his squad will have to show him
all season.
In a tight two-day schedule
that started Friday at the Santa
Barbara tournament, the Cardi
nal lost to No. 1 seed Long Beach
State in five games and was de
feated in three games by Santa
Barbara the following morning.
Stanford rallied that afternoon to
beat Pacific in another five game
contest.
In spite of the losses, Shaw said
he was satisfied with his team's
play.
"I'm not into moral victories. I
would rather have won," Shaw
said, referring to the match
against Long Beach, in which the
No. 8 seed Cardinal dropped an
11-9 lead to lose the fifth game by
two. "But I felt the effort was
there."
Effort was certainly there for
junior outside hitter David Vogel,
who posted a career-high 19 kills
after undergoing knee surgery
just a month ago.
Stanford faced the Gauchos on
Saturday morning in the consola
tion round that provided Shaw,
who was less concerned about the
overall outcome of the tourna
ment after the loss to Long
Beach, an opportunity to rotate
his players.
"[lt was] about getting guys ex
perience and resting the guys that
we had," Shaw said of the 3-0 loss
against the tournament hosts.
Even so, the Cardinal played
solidly, and saw contributions
from younger players.
The team was led in kills by
sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy with 10, followed by red
shirt junior Pat Bomhack, who
recorded seven kills and nine as
sists. Sophomore Jeremy Jacobs
registered a team-high 23 assists,
and freshman Josh Schwarzapel
collected seven digs.
Hours later, Stanford faced off
against Pacific in a match that fea

tured stellar play from some of its
more seasoned players and came
away with a five-game victory.
The Tigers took games one and
four, but ultimately fell to the
Cardinal in the fifth, 15-13.
Vogel continued to dominate
the Cardinal offensive, notching a
team-high 16 kills, and chipped in
on the defensive end as well with
eight digs.
Junior middle blocker Craig
Buell posted 15 kills and Jacobs
led the team in digs with 10.
Junior All-Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation setter Kevin
Hansen handed out 61 assists as
part of consistent play that im
pressed Shaw.
"He has to play well in order
for us to play well," said Shaw of
his setter. "And he did a good job
of that."
While the Cardinal returned to
Stanford with a losing record in
the tournament, Shaw remains
positive about his team's
strengths, especially in light of the
competitive MPSF conference
and the fact that eight of the
squad's 12 members are freshmen
and sophomores.
"When you have an off year,
nobody's going to feel sorry for
you," Shaw said. "Nothing's
going to be easy."
But Shaw says the tenacity his
squad showed this weekend is in
dicative of their skills as a team.
"I like our team as far as chem
istry and work ethic. I have no
complaints there. It's just that on
paper, we've lost a lot of talent,"
Shaw said.
Last June, Stanford graduated
three time All-American Curt
Toppel, in addition to standouts
Billy Strickland and Will Curtis.
The trio posted nearly 1,000 kills
between them last season alone.
In spite of their losses to grad
uation, Shaw feels confident in
his team.
. "You can be 1-2 and not be so
happy about it, or you can be 1-2
and be happy about it," Shaw
said. "We're in a better place
competitively than I thought we'd
be."
The Cardinal will take on Los
Angeles this Friday and Irvine on
Saturday in Burnham Pavilion.

Junior outside hitter Craig Buell attempts a block in a match last season. Despite losing three
key seniors, including perennial Ail-American opposite hitter Curt Toppel, the Cardinal is
looking to have a successful rebuilding campaign. Buell will be key in the Cardinal's offensive

tion round that provided Shaw,
who was less concerned about the
overall outcome of the tourna
ment after the loss to Long
Beach, an opportunity to rotate
his players.
"[lt was] about getting guys ex
perience and resting the guys that
we had," Shaw said of the 3-0 loss
against the tournament hosts.
Even so, the Cardinal played
solidly, and saw contributions
from younger players.
The team was led in kills by
sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy with 10, followed by red
shirt junior Pat Bomhack, who
recorded seven kills and nine as
sists. Sophomore Jeremy Jacobs
registered a team-high 23 assists,
and freshman Josh Schwarzapel
collected seven digs.
Hours later, Stanford faced off
against Pacific in a match that fea

tured stellar play from some of its
more seasoned players and came
away with a five-game victory.
The Tigers took games one and
four, but ultimately fell to the
Cardinal in the fifth, 15-13.
Vogel continued to dominate
the Cardinal offensive, notching a
team-high 16 kills, and chipped in
on the defensive end as well with
eight digs.
Junior middle blocker Craig
Buell posted 15 kills and Jacobs
led the team in digs with 10.
Junior All-Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation setter Kevin
Hansen handed out 61 assists as
part of consistent play that im
pressed Shaw.
"He has to play well in order
for us to play well," said Shaw of
his setter. "And he did a good job
of that."
While the Cardinal returned to
Stanford with a losing record in
the tournament, Shaw remains
positive about his team's
strengths, especially in light of the
competitive MPSF conference
and the fact that eight of the
squad's 12 members are freshmen
and sophomores.
"When you have an off year,
nobody's going to feel sorry for
you," Shaw said. "Nothing's
going to be easy."
But Shaw says the tenacity his
squad showed this weekend is in
dicative of their skills as a team.
"I like our team as far as chem
istry and work ethic. I have no
complaints there. It's just that on
paper, we've lost a lot of talent,"
Shaw said.
Last June, Stanford graduated
three time All-American Curt
Toppel, in addition to standouts
Billy Strickland and Will Curtis.
The trio posted nearly 1,000 kills
between them last season alone.
In spite of their losses to grad
uation, Shaw feels confident in
his team.
. "You can be 1-2 and not be so
happy about it, or you can be 1-2
and be happy about it," Shaw
said. "We're in a better place
competitively than I thought we'd
be."
The Cardinal will take on Los
Angeles this Friday and Irvine on
Saturday in Burnham Pavilion.

Junior outside hitter Craig Buell attempts a block in a match last season. Despite losing three
key seniors, including perennial Ail-American opposite hitter Curt Toppel, the Cardinal is
looking to have a successful rebuilding campaign. Buell will be key in the Cardinal's offensive
attack this year.
