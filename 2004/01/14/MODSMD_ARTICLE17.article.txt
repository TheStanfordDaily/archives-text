# Wash. St., OSU join Card with Pac-10 upsets
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Last weekend in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, then-No. 4 Stanford (13-0, 4-0 Pac
-10) knocked off then-No. 3 Arizona (10-2,

UPDATE

2-1), assuming its third-ranked spot in the
national polls and remaining undefeated,
and two traditional conference doormats
asserted themselves at home.
The Cardinal's convincing 82-72 win

over the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., left no
doubt about who the Pac-10's top team is.
While Stanford backed up the hype that it
has been garnering from coaches around
the conference lately, newcomer Dick
Bennett has helped Washington State
equal last year's conference win total. The
Cougars (8-6,2-2) defeated Southern Cal
ifornia (7-6,2-2), 76-61. Oregon (7-6,1-2)
State defeated rival Oregon (6-4,1-2) for
the first time in five years, 90-81, by clos
ing the game on a 12-0 run.
Five players scored in double figures to
lead Stanford, while Mustafa Shakur had

a career-high 20 points in Arizona's losing
effort. The Wildcats shot just 4-of-21 from
three-point range and struggled in half
court sets, collecting just 10 assists to the
Cardinal's 22.
In the Cougars' big win, Marcus Moore
was for once overshadowed by a team
mate. Nigerian junior-college transfer Jeff
Varem poured in a surprising 22 points on
9-of-12 shooting and also contributed a
team-high seven rebounds. USC got 22
points from stand-alone standout
Desmon Farmer, who knocked down five
threes.

Oregon State, a team that last year
struggled mightily on offense, gave up a
career-high 39 points to star Oregon for
ward Luke Jackson, who went 14-of-14
from the charity stripe and also found time
to pull down 16 rebounds and yet the
Beavers still managed to pull off the
comeback win. David Lucas led the way
with 24 points, including 22 in the second
half.
Prior to its win on Saturday, Washing
ton State played a game that surely
brought back memories for Big Ten
fans accustomed to watching Ben
nett coach slow-paced Wisconsin
teams, losing 48-45 to UCLA (8-3,
4-0). Moore led all scorers with just
13 points, while the Bruins' T.J.
Cummings had 12 points and eight
boards as UCLA ground out the
victory in Pullman, Wash.
UCLA played a faster-paced
game on Saturday, edging Washing
ton (5-7, 0-4) in overtime, 86-84.
Cummings again led the way with 22
points and 11 boards, and Dijon
Thompson's two free throws with 10
seconds left in OT gave the visiting
Bruins the victory after they blew a
13-point lead with just 3:32 left in
the second half.
Lorenzo Romar's Huskies
forced a whopping 24 turnovers,
and got 29 points, seven rebounds
and five assists from Will Conroy,
but shot only 29-of-71 from the
field.
The Huskies were coming off an
88-80 loss to USC on Thursday that
saw them send the Trojans to the
free-throw a total of 39 times byway
of 27 fouls committed. Errick
Craven's 20 led five USC players in
double figures, while Conroy's 21
led all scorers. The guard totaled 50
points in his breakout weekend.
Prior to its disappointing loss to
Stanford on Saturday, Arizona
coasted to an easy 95-75 win over an
inexperienced Cal squad. The
Golden Bears (6-7, 2-2) were be
hind 50-22 at the half. Salim
Stoudamire scored 18 points on just
eight shots for the Wildcats, hitting
4-of-5 threes. Freshman Marquise
Kately led Cal with 18 points.
Cal did salvage its road trip with
a 74-62 win over Arizona State (6-6,
0-3) on Saturday. Kately again led
the team, scoring 17, while Ike
Diogu posted a monstrous one-man
effort for a team that saw only one
other player score more than five
points. Diogu manhandled Cal's big
men, hitting 15-of-17 free throws on
his way to 31 points and 13 re
bounds.
Arizona State looked much
more impressive on Thursday, as it

put a scare into Stanford, which
managed a 63-62 victory only on a
last-second putback by Josh Chil
dress. Diogu only had 13 points and
six boards, yet the Sun Devils fought
hard, getting 16 points from JC
transfer Steve Moore and 13 from
Jason Braxton. Childress had 14 and

11 boards in 26 minutes off the
bench for the Cardinal, which was
led by Matt Lottich's 18 points and
six assists.
Tomorrow, Oregon hosts Wash
ington, Washington State takes a
trip to Oregon State, Arizona State
plays at UCLA and Arizona visits

On Saturday, Washington plays

Oregon and USC welcomes Ari

Junior Nick Robinson and the Stanford men's basketball team have established themselves as the team to beat in
the Pac-10 after Thursday's last second victory over Arizona State and Saturday's dismantling of Arizona.
Last weekend in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, then-No. 4 Stanford (13-0, 4-0 Pac
-10) knocked off then-No. 3 Arizona (10-2,

UPDATE

2-1), assuming its third-ranked spot in the
national polls and remaining undefeated,
and two traditional conference doormats
asserted themselves at home.
The Cardinal's convincing 82-72 win

over the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., left no
doubt about who the Pac-10's top team is.
While Stanford backed up the hype that it
has been garnering from coaches around
the conference lately, newcomer Dick
Bennett has helped Washington State
equal last year's conference win total. The
Cougars (8-6,2-2) defeated Southern Cal
ifornia (7-6,2-2), 76-61. Oregon (7-6,1-2)
State defeated rival Oregon (6-4,1-2) for
the first time in five years, 90-81, by clos
ing the game on a 12-0 run.
Five players scored in double figures to
lead Stanford, while Mustafa Shakur had

a career-high 20 points in Arizona's losing
effort. The Wildcats shot just 4-of-21 from
three-point range and struggled in half
court sets, collecting just 10 assists to the
Cardinal's 22.
In the Cougars' big win, Marcus Moore
was for once overshadowed by a team
mate. Nigerian junior-college transfer Jeff
Varem poured in a surprising 22 points on
9-of-12 shooting and also contributed a
team-high seven rebounds. USC got 22
points from stand-alone standout
Desmon Farmer, who knocked down five
threes.

Oregon State, a team that last year
struggled mightily on offense, gave up a
career-high 39 points to star Oregon for
ward Luke Jackson, who went 14-of-14
from the charity stripe and also found time
to pull down 16 rebounds and yet the
Beavers still managed to pull off the
comeback win. David Lucas led the way
with 24 points, including 22 in the second
half.
Prior to its win on Saturday, Washing
ton State played a game that surely
brought back memories for Big Ten
fans accustomed to watching Ben
nett coach slow-paced Wisconsin
teams, losing 48-45 to UCLA (8-3,
4-0). Moore led all scorers with just
13 points, while the Bruins' T.J.
Cummings had 12 points and eight
boards as UCLA ground out the
victory in Pullman, Wash.
UCLA played a faster-paced
game on Saturday, edging Washing
ton (5-7, 0-4) in overtime, 86-84.
