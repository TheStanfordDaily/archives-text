2-1), assuming its third-ranked spot in the
national polls and remaining undefeated,
and two traditional conference doormats
asserted themselves at home.
The Cardinal's convincing 82-72 win

over the Wildcats in Tucson, Ariz., left no
doubt about who the Pac-10's top team is.
While Stanford backed up the hype that it
has been garnering from coaches around
the conference lately, newcomer Dick
Bennett has helped Washington State
equal last year's conference win total. The
Cougars (8-6,2-2) defeated Southern Cal
ifornia (7-6,2-2), 76-61. Oregon (7-6,1-2)
State defeated rival Oregon (6-4,1-2) for
the first time in five years, 90-81, by clos

Five players scored in double figures to

three-point range and struggled in half

Cardinal's 22.
In the Cougars' big win, Marcus Moore
was for once overshadowed by a team
mate. Nigerian junior-college transfer Jeff
Varem poured in a surprising 22 points on
9-of-12 shooting and also contributed a
team-high seven rebounds. USC got 22
points from stand-alone standout
Desmon Farmer, who knocked down five
threes.

Oregon State, a team that last year
struggled mightily on offense, gave up a
career-high 39 points to star Oregon for
ward Luke Jackson, who went 14-of-14
from the charity stripe and also found time
to pull down 16 rebounds and yet the
Beavers still managed to pull off the
comeback win. David Lucas led the way
with 24 points, including 22 in the second
half.
Prior to its win on Saturday, Washing
