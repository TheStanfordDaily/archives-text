# Logar making impact in first year at Farm

She boasts a solid 5-2 match record after just one quarter at Stanford.
She clinched a victory while suffering from a broken tailbone.
She competed in the 2003 U.S. Open.
Just two months shy of her 19th birthday, Stanford freshman women's tennis player
Theresa Logar asserts that with a Flushing Meadows debut under her belt, she can now "die
happy."
"It was the best experience of my life," Logar said. "I didn't realize what it was like until
I got there, [just] being in the players' locker room with Kim Clijsters' locker right by mine."
While an effervescent Logar swoons over her groundbreaking summer experience, it's
not hard to envision the tireless efforts which transformed her from childhood prodigy to
collegiate powerhouse. In a recent league match against Hawaii, Logar played in the No. 2
position for the second-ranked Cardinal, racking up a punishing 6-1, 6-0 win over Justine
Boutet.
Her success started simply enough. Logar, quickly disappointed with the parent-initiat
ed likes of Irish step dancing and ballet, opted for a tennis racket at the fledgling age of 5.
"[I remember] my grandpa telling me, for every shot you get over the net, I'll give you a
penny," she said.
That day, Logar made 50 shots.
In subsequent months, a tenacious Logar and the tennis courts dotting the landscape of
her Rochester Hills, MI home became inseparable. After just six months of play, Logar was
already investing four days a week in practice and improving by leaps and bounds.
She might relate the astonishment and praise her youthful prowess garnered, but her
modesty and refreshing sense of humor soon draw her attention elsewhere.
For instance, she would rather discuss the quirky details of her childhood practices.
"I know I was heartbroken the day they told me I couldn't play 'Hot Dog Tennis' any
more," chuckled Logar, recalling the ketchup-doused snack she would receive after a Fri
day afternoon's work.
Logar also speaks fondly of her grandfather, who served as her instructor and coach for
several years.
"My friends all used to call him 'The Milkman' because he only wore white pants and a
white T-shirt [to my matches]," said Logar, who began playing tournaments when she was
8. "I swear, he must have had at least 20 pairs of white pants."
Despite Logar's easygoing nature, she thrives on the fiercely competitive spirit that ten
nis instills in her.
