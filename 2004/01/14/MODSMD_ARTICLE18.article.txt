# Logar making impact in first year at Farm

She boasts a solid 5-2 match record after just one quarter at Stanford.
She clinched a victory while suffering from a broken tailbone.
She competed in the 2003 U.S. Open.
Just two months shy of her 19th birthday, Stanford freshman women's tennis player
Theresa Logar asserts that with a Flushing Meadows debut under her belt, she can now "die
happy."
"It was the best experience of my life," Logar said. "I didn't realize what it was like until
I got there, [just] being in the players' locker room with Kim Clijsters' locker right by mine."
While an effervescent Logar swoons over her groundbreaking summer experience, it's
not hard to envision the tireless efforts which transformed her from childhood prodigy to
collegiate powerhouse. In a recent league match against Hawaii, Logar played in the No. 2
position for the second-ranked Cardinal, racking up a punishing 6-1, 6-0 win over Justine
Boutet.
Her success started simply enough. Logar, quickly disappointed with the parent-initiat
ed likes of Irish step dancing and ballet, opted for a tennis racket at the fledgling age of 5.
"[I remember] my grandpa telling me, for every shot you get over the net, I'll give you a
penny," she said.
That day, Logar made 50 shots.
In subsequent months, a tenacious Logar and the tennis courts dotting the landscape of
her Rochester Hills, MI home became inseparable. After just six months of play, Logar was
already investing four days a week in practice and improving by leaps and bounds.
She might relate the astonishment and praise her youthful prowess garnered, but her
modesty and refreshing sense of humor soon draw her attention elsewhere.
For instance, she would rather discuss the quirky details of her childhood practices.
"I know I was heartbroken the day they told me I couldn't play 'Hot Dog Tennis' any
more," chuckled Logar, recalling the ketchup-doused snack she would receive after a Fri
day afternoon's work.
Logar also speaks fondly of her grandfather, who served as her instructor and coach for
several years.
"My friends all used to call him 'The Milkman' because he only wore white pants and a
white T-shirt [to my matches]," said Logar, who began playing tournaments when she was
8. "I swear, he must have had at least 20 pairs of white pants."
Despite Logar's easygoing nature, she thrives on the fiercely competitive spirit that ten
nis instills in her.

"I live for the matches," she said.
"When you're out there, it's just
you, the ball and the opponent and
you're just chasing shots all over the
court."
Logar's strong determination
underscores her host of junior cir
cuit accomplishments.
Before setting foot on the Farm,
she was ranked second in the Unit
ed States Tennis Association Girls'
18 League, and emerged victor
over top-seeded Sasha Podkolzina
at the prestigious Super National
Hard Courts Tournament in San
Jose last August.
The epic 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 final battle
against California rival Podkolzina
brought an initial bout of frustra
tion and self-doubt for Logar, but
Logar rallied back stronger than
ever.
"She fired a ball at me when I
was at the net, down 2-3, in the sec
ond set," Logar said. "I got so mad
that I won four straight games [af
terward], and by the time I won that
set I knew I could win the match."
Logar continued, "That's the
beauty of matches that you can't

simulate [in practice]. There's so
many things that happen on the
court that can either make or
break you.
You know, if Sasha's shot hadn't
almost hit me in the second set, I
think she would have won the
match."
An incredible ability to channel
her emotions into showdown suc
cess also makes Logar one of few
people who can say they've played
and won a match with a bro
ken bone.
In December 2000 at the Or
ange Bowl, Logar was achingly
close to victory over opponent
Maria Kirilenko when she
slipped on the baseline, fractur
ing her tailbone.
"I heard it snap," said Logar,
who still managed to make good on
her 5-4,30-15 lead in the second set.
"I could barely walk to go up and
shake her hand afterwards."
But Logar refused to be side
lined then, and she employs the
same steady optimism as she enters
her first season of dual match play.
"You know when you come in as
a freshman you're the outsider, but
I think [l'm] starting to get comfort
able with everybody," Logar said.
"And knowing that my result
doesn't just affect me but 13 others,
I'm really starting to love it."
