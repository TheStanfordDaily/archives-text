Stanford Hospital and Clinics reported revenues ex
ceeding expenses by $36 million and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital had revenues that exceeded expens
es by $60.2 million in the 2003 fiscal year, ended Aug. 31,
according to financial reports released last month.
For both hospitals, the report shows an improvement
from previous years. In the 2002 fiscal year, Stanford
Hospital and Clinics earned $12.5 million. Previously,
the hospital had a significant deficit in 2000 and 2001 due
to efforts for a merger and a subsequent separation from
the University of California-San Francisco Medical Cen
ter. Other issues included tensions from a nursing strike
in 2000.
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital reported rev
enues of $38.7 million in the 2002 fiscal year.
According to Packard Children's Hospital spokesper
son Robert Dicks, a primary source of revenue is reim
bursements the hospital receives for the care it provides
to some of the sickest children in the state. He said that
careful financial management also contributes to the
hospital's financial strength.
Many credit the turnaround at Stanford Hospital and

Clinics to the arrival of Martha Marsh as president and
chief executive.
Marsh joined the hospital in June 2002 after it had
gone through two years of losses and was projecting a $lO
million deficit. The hospital rebounded and reported a
positive income for that fiscal year.
"Our staff has done an excellent job of refocusing re
sources on quality care and service," Marsh said. "We
are so pleased to be able to put Stanford back on a strong
financial footing so we can reinvest in new programs and
services for patients and their families, new equipment
and facility improvements."
Supply costs were reduced by 20 percent through ne
gotiating contracts with a small number of vendors to
capitalize on volume discounts. The management team
also said it improved business systems and operations to
boost productivity and cost efficiency.
"The financial environment for hospitals is still very
challenging," Marsh said. "We continue to make critical
investments to endure the highest quality patient care.
To provide the latest technologies to our patients re
quires significant financial resources."
In June, Stanford Hospital and Clinics sold $250 mil
lion in revenue bonds. The money from these bonds will

go towards finishing an ambulatory cancer treatment
center and supporting patient care projects, including in
vesting in medical diagnostic equipment, patient pro
grams, seismic improvements and information technolo
gy improvements.
In light of its strong financial performance of late, the
Children's Hospital also plans on devoting funds to
building its endowment and reinvesting in facilities and
patient health care services.
"We use our profits to invest in our future, so that we
can continue to be here to provide for sick children and
search for cures for the most complex childhood dis
eases," Dicks said.
The Packard Hospital board has set aside $55 million
of this past year's profits for construction and plans on
spending $350 million over the next five years on ex
panding programs and facilities and remodeling the ex
isting hospital.
The two hospitals are affiliated with the Stanford Uni
versity Medical Center and their finances are reported in
the University's annual report, but the hospitals are sep
arate legal and financial entities that function indepen
dently from each other and the University.
