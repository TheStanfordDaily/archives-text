# Junior wins Mitchell scholarship
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The second time malaria struck ju
nior Alex Bradford, one of the nation's
12 recently named George J. Mitchell
Scholars, he was hitchhiking in a rickety
pickup to Kampala, the capital of Ugan
da, after spending time with the Masai
people of southern Kenya.
"I was sleeping on this cowhide and
didn't have a mosquito net," Bradford

said. "I didn't realize I
had malaria until I was
on this truck, almost
back in the city of Kam
pala, and my ass started
to hurt like hell, and
then my back started to
hurt like hell, and then
my legs started to hurt
like hell, and I realized
it was something other
than the truck ride."

After gaining back the 20 pounds the
disease had stolen from him and spend
ing some time in a hospital bed, Brad
ford was ready to rededicate himself to
understanding and stemming the HIV /
AIDS pandemic in the developing
world, a passion that has driven him
since before high school.
That passion was recognized recently
when Bradford was awarded the George
J. Mitchell Scholarship in a highly selec
tive nationwide competition that awards
12 Americans a year of postgraduate
study at universities in Ireland and
Northern Ireland.
Bradford, who is majoring in human
biology with a 4.0 GPA while also serv
ing as the junior class co-president,

thought he didn't have a chance.
"I was really surprised when I found
out I won," he said. "I was in Minnesota,
and I was woken up by a phone call, and
the director of the program had this tone
in his voice that led me to believe I had
not won.
"By the time he had told me which
was about two minutes after we started
talking I was convinced I hadn't won.
When he told me, 'Congratulations,
we'd like to offer you the scholarship,' I
was totally surprised."
Among other things, Bradford distin
guished himself from other applicants by
publishing a guidebook for young peo
ple interested in social activism. The
book, published in 2001, is entitled
"Generation Y for the Global Village."
"It's a resource that outlines 250 ways
to get involved in various levels of social
entrepreneurship and volunteerism,"
Bradford said. "The book is broken
down into 20 chapters, each having a
theme" such as poverty, education or
health care.
He wrote the book in the summer of
2001, before coming to Stanford, while
working a day job at a hospital in Min
nesota.
"It's a little project that I did because
I was looking for the same resource and
couldn't find one, so I decided to go
ahead and try to do it myself," he said.
Another one of Bradford's "little
projects" was to found the Stanford Un
dergraduate Research Journal during
his freshman year.
Bradford has spent other summers
working for the World Bank and the late
Senator Paul Wellstone, and spent one
of his Stanford quarters in Washington

interning at the United Nations Devel
opment Program. But his focus has al
ways been on battling the HIV pandem
ic.
"One of my good friends died of
AIDS," he said. "She was an immigrant
from Africa. That inspired me to take a
year off and travel to Africa to work
with kids and AIDS patients."
Bradford did just that after he had his
high school diploma in hand. He spent a
year before coming to Stanford volun
teering in refugee camps in northern
Kenya, building an AIDS clinic in South
Africa and working at a camp for "inter
nally displaced persons" in Uganda.
This dedicated activism continued at
Stanford, where Bradford teamed up
with other students to start the Student
Global AIDS Walk, a phenomenon that
debuted last April in 10 cities across the
United States and is now a self-sustain
ing, nationwide enterprise. The dona
tions from the walk were used to help
combat mother-to-child AIDS transmis
sion in developing nations and to aid po
litical awareness in domestic circles.
After graduating this spring, Brad
ford is headed for Dublin City Universi
ty, where he plans on studying in the
business school to prepare for a job at
McKinsey & Company, a consulting
firm.
"I'd like to develop a business back
ground," he said. "The NGO communi
ty is strongly underrepresented in terms
of business acumen and business skills."
But, of course, a year spent abroad
can't be all work and no play.
"I'm looking forward to three hours
at the pubs and golfing," he said. "I grew
up caddying in Minneapolis."

After graduating this spring, Brad
ford is headed for Dublin City Universi
ty, where he plans on studying in the
business school to prepare for a job at
McKinsey & Company, a consulting
firm.
"I'd like to develop a business back
ground," he said. "The NGO communi
ty is strongly underrepresented in terms
of business acumen and business skills."
But, of course, a year spent abroad
can't be all work and no play.
"I'm looking forward to three hours
at the pubs and golfing," he said. "I grew
up caddying in Minneapolis."

The second time malaria struck ju
nior Alex Bradford, one of the nation's
12 recently named George J. Mitchell
Scholars, he was hitchhiking in a rickety
pickup to Kampala, the capital of Ugan
da, after spending time with the Masai
people of southern Kenya.
"I was sleeping on this cowhide and
didn't have a mosquito net," Bradford

said. "I didn't realize I
had malaria until I was
on this truck, almost
back in the city of Kam
pala, and my ass started
to hurt like hell, and
then my back started to
hurt like hell, and then
my legs started to hurt
like hell, and I realized
it was something other
than the truck ride."

After gaining back the 20 pounds the
disease had stolen from him and spend
ing some time in a hospital bed, Brad
ford was ready to rededicate himself to
understanding and stemming the HIV /
AIDS pandemic in the developing
world, a passion that has driven him
since before high school.
That passion was recognized recently
when Bradford was awarded the George
J. Mitchell Scholarship in a highly selec
tive nationwide competition that awards
12 Americans a year of postgraduate
study at universities in Ireland and
Northern Ireland.
Bradford, who is majoring in human
biology with a 4.0 GPA while also serv
ing as the junior class co-president,

thought he didn't have a chance.
"I was really surprised when I found
out I won," he said. "I was in Minnesota,
and I was woken up by a phone call, and
the director of the program had this tone
in his voice that led me to believe I had
not won.
"By the time he had told me which
was about two minutes after we started
talking I was convinced I hadn't won.
When he told me, 'Congratulations,
we'd like to offer you the scholarship,' I
was totally surprised."
Among other things, Bradford distin
guished himself from other applicants by
publishing a guidebook for young peo
ple interested in social activism. The
book, published in 2001, is entitled
"Generation Y for the Global Village."
"It's a resource that outlines 250 ways
to get involved in various levels of social
entrepreneurship and volunteerism,"
Bradford said. "The book is broken
down into 20 chapters, each having a
theme" such as poverty, education or
health care.
He wrote the book in the summer of
2001, before coming to Stanford, while
working a day job at a hospital in Min
nesota.
"It's a little project that I did because
I was looking for the same resource and
couldn't find one, so I decided to go
ahead and try to do it myself," he said.
Another one of Bradford's "little
projects" was to found the Stanford Un
dergraduate Research Journal during
his freshman year.
Bradford has spent other summers
working for the World Bank and the late
Senator Paul Wellstone, and spent one
of his Stanford quarters in Washington

interning at the United Nations Devel
opment Program. But his focus has al
ways been on battling the HIV pandem
ic.
"One of my good friends died of
AIDS," he said. "She was an immigrant
from Africa. That inspired me to take a
year off and travel to Africa to work
with kids and AIDS patients."
Bradford did just that after he had his
high school diploma in hand. He spent a
year before coming to Stanford volun
teering in refugee camps in northern
Kenya, building an AIDS clinic in South
Africa and working at a camp for "inter
nally displaced persons" in Uganda.
This dedicated activism continued at
Stanford, where Bradford teamed up
with other students to start the Student
Global AIDS Walk, a phenomenon that
debuted last April in 10 cities across the
United States and is now a self-sustain
ing, nationwide enterprise. The dona
tions from the walk were used to help
combat mother-to-child AIDS transmis
sion in developing nations and to aid po
litical awareness in domestic circles.
