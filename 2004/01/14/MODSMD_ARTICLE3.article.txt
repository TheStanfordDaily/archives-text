# Representatives travel on behalf of Cordell

Stanford and Palo Alto representatives will be traveling to
Sacramento today to attend a state Senate meeting on behalf of
a bill that would allow Vice Provost for Campus Relations
LaDoris Cordell to sit on the Palo Alto city council without dis
rupting business between Stanford and the city.
Section 1090 of the government code has inhibited business
negotiations between Stanford and Palo Alto since Jan. 1, when
Cordell took her seat, because it forbids city councils from ne
gotiating contracts with a corporation for which a city council
member works.
Stanford does not fall under an exemption to the law made
for nonprofit organizations, as was originally thought, since the
University is set up as a trust.
State Senator Byron Sher introduced a bill earlier this month
that would alter that exemption so that it would include trusts that
operate as nonprofits, such as Stanford. Palo Alto Mayor Bern
Beecham, acting City Attorney Wynn Furth and a member of the
Stanford legal department will be attending hearings on the bill
held by the state Senate's Local Government Committee.

"This is a bill they're doing specifically on behalf of the city
of Palo Alto," said Beecham, who was appointed by the city
council to a committee on the issue of Cordell's council posi
tion. "There may be no significant issue brought up with the
bill [at the meeting], but just in case there is, we want to be
there to respond to it, to provide the background and rationale
for what we're doing."
Typically, a Senate bill cannot be voted on until a month
after it has been introduced, but that procedural delay can be
waived with a four-fifths vote of the Senate. If it is waived, ac
cording to Beecham, the Senate could vote the bill on as early
as next week.
In order to become law, the bill must pass with a two-thirds
vote, be approved by the Assembly and be signed by the gover
nor.
Until the situation can be resolved, the city council has sim
ply opted to hold off on negotiating any contracts with Stanford.
Even though there are many ongoing contractual negotiations
between the city and Stanford, dealing with everything from the
Stanford Shopping Center to Marguerite schedules, none was
so pressing that it could not be put on hold for at least the first
quarter of this year.
