# Billionaire Munger to fund new dorm

As plans progress for a new
graduate student residence behind
the School of Law, some students
and faculty are apprehensive
about the project and the control
that has been exercised by its

donor, which The
Daily has learned to

building and envi

oppose the resi

petition that urges
the University to
obey specific guide
lines for future con

These guidelines,
some which have

been neglected, range from ener

recommendations.
"We, the undersigned, encour
age Stanford University to consid

petition reads. "We view trade
