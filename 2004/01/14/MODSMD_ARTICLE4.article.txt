# Billionaire Munger to fund new dorm
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
As plans progress for a new
graduate student residence behind
the School of Law, some students
and faculty are apprehensive
about the project and the control
that has been exercised by its

donor, which The
Daily has learned to
be Los Angeles bil
lionaire Charles
Munger.
Munger, a part
ner of prominent in
vestor Warren Buf
fett, is the sole
donor for the new
residence, which
would be built in the
parking lot behind
Stern Hall and the

Law School. While the amount of
the donation has not yet been set
and plans are far from being final
ized, Munger said he has major in
fluence over the design and loca
tion of the new housing.
Environmental concerns,
parking shortage 8c congestion
There are 1,200 graduate stu
dents without campus housing, in
cluding a third of Stanford's 570
law students. Living in Palo Alto,
where the cost of living is astro-

nomical, is difficult for those stu
dents, who often have little income
to spend, Law School Dean Kath
leen Sullivan told The Daily in Oc
tober.
But critics say they are worried
about how the project is being car
ried out.
Students for a Sustainable

Stanford, a group
that endorses green
building and envi
ronmental aware
ness, has rallied to
oppose the resi
dence, circulating a
petition that urges
the University to
obey specific guide
lines for future con
struction projects.
These guidelines,
some which have

been neglected, range from ener

tution, which we believe will thrive
for centuries to come."
Other complaints include the
fear of a parking shortage and con
gestion on the east side of campus.
The new dorm would require the
relocation of several houses on
Salvatierra Walk and would likely
overshadow surrounding buildings
and open space.
Need for more graduate
housing
In response to those objections,
Munger said that opposition was
to be expected.
"Any design or planning on
campuses is partly political, partly
bureaucratic," he said. "It could be
a success or a mess. People will
hate it regardless, but Stanford is
in desperate need of graduate

housing and it needs to take better
care of its students."
Munger expressed concern that
the University will lose its compet
itive edge if adequate housing isn't
provided in the immediate future.
He pointed to the example of the
University of Michigan, where
new law student housing actually
raised the school's national rating.
Robert Reidy, vice provost of
land and buildings, defended
Munger's plans.
"The desire for more beds on
campus is great and Mr. Munger
provides a unique opportunity in
the form of a donation to assist in
meeting our housing needs," he
said. "We are attempting to bal
ance the need for housing, the size
of the proposed facility and the im
pact to the campus."
But History Prof. Peter Stan
sky, chair of the committee for
University land and buildings, ex
pressed wariness about the pro
ject's management.

"I've heard nothing official
about [the residence] and nothing
but disconcerting rumors," he said.
"In general, I think that ordinary
procedures should be followed for
a building and that exceptions
should not be made for particular
donors."
Conflict with architect
Munger, who also serves as a
partner at the Los Angeles law
firm Munger, Tolles and Olson,
has been praised for smart invest
ment strategies and criticized for
his big-business attitude. He is
widely known for his philanthropy
and is the subject of Janet Lowe's
biographical, "Damn Right! Be
hind the Scenes with Berkshire
Hathaway Billionaire Charles
Munger."
Many members of the Munger
family have attended Stanford, in
cluding Charles Munger's daugh
ter, University Trustee Wendy
Munger. The family has funded

construction projects at other in
stitutions and wishes to make a
similar contribution to the Stan
ford community.
During the months of prelimi
nary discussion about the dorm,
several disagreements arose be
tween Munger and former Univer
sity Architect David Neuman over
details of the construction project.
It is unclear whether this conflict
prompted Neuman's decision to
leave Stanford for a position at the
University of Virginia. Neuman
could not be reached for comment.
While it was rumored that
Munger had contracted his own ar
chitect and builder, he said that he
hadn't yet decided, although he
definitely wants the help of profes
sionals who will adhere to his pref
erences. Munger stressed that con
tracting outside companies is in no
way new for the University, which
employed a private architect to
renovate the Law School's class
rooms and library.

"The recent changes to the Law
School are examples of some of
the best architecture on campus,"
he said. "I wanted to do the same."
While it is uncertain whether
Munger's initial interest in con
tracting out the project was influ
enced by his relationship with
Neuman, he admitted that it
"would be fair to say that I didn't
want to work with him."
Still, Munger maintained that
Neuman was the real father of the
project and that their original vi
sion for the new residence was al
most identical. Both men hoped to
model the building after law hous
ing at the University of Michigan,
but tension increased as plans be
came more specific.
"I do not think it had any influ
ence [on Neuman's decision to
leave]," University President John
Hennessy said. "Final decisions on
the project have yet to be made."
Neuman, who also served as
vice provost for planning, was

named architect for the University
of Virginia in November and start
ed his new position on Jan. 1 after
14 years at Stanford. The search
for a replacement has not yet
begun, Hennessy said.
'The most beautiful park
ing garage'
Munger maintains that the
dorm will benefit Stanford's cam
pus.
"If you build really good hous
ing next door to the Law School, it
will be a huge advantage for Stan
ford," Munger said. "It will form a
community that doesn't yet exist in
American education. The students
will educate each other."
The University aims to accom
modate the many graduate stu
dents who have been forced to live
off campus, particularly those
from the Law School, and the new
residence will likely provide more
spaces than necessary in order to
allow for future growth. In the
meantime, these spaces may be
filled with students from varied
graduate programs and even un
dergraduate students.
Munger anticipates that the res
idence will eventually house busi
ness students who would also prof
it from the close proximity to cam
pus and community atmosphere
this housing would provide.
When asked about some of the
more logistical concerns, including
crowding and parking, Munger re
iterated that any project of this
scale poses challenges that require
innovative solutions.
"The current plan is to preserve
every building," he said.
According to Munger, one way
to achieve this is through parking
garages.
"Parking garages are the best
way to preserve the Stanford am
bience. The current plan is to have
a parking garage covered in ivy. It
will be the most beautiful parking
garage and the most green, too."
Both Reidy and Hennessy said
that plans are still in preliminary
stages and that it remains uncer
tain whether the residence will be
built at all. As of now, construction
will likely start in 2004 or 2005, and
the residence will open its doors in
2006.

Other complaints include the

The new dorm would require the
relocation of several houses on
Salvatierra Walk and would likely
overshadow surrounding buildings
and open space.
Need for more graduate

In response to those objections,
Munger said that opposition was
to be expected.
"Any design or planning on
campuses is partly political, partly
bureaucratic," he said. "It could be
a success or a mess. People will
hate it regardless, but Stanford is
in desperate need of graduate

Conflict with architect
Munger, who also serves as a
partner at the Los Angeles law
firm Munger, Tolles and Olson,
has been praised for smart invest
ment strategies and criticized for
his big-business attitude. He is
widely known for his philanthropy
and is the subject of Janet Lowe's
biographical, "Damn Right! Be

Hathaway Billionaire Charles
Munger."
Many members of the Munger
family have attended Stanford, in
cluding Charles Munger's daugh
ter, University Trustee Wendy
Munger. The family has funded

construction projects at other in
stitutions and wishes to make a
similar contribution to the Stan
ford community.
During the months of prelimi
nary discussion about the dorm,
several disagreements arose be
tween Munger and former Univer
sity Architect David Neuman over
details of the construction project.
It is unclear whether this conflict
prompted Neuman's decision to
leave Stanford for a position at the
University of Virginia. Neuman
could not be reached for comment.
While it was rumored that
Munger had contracted his own ar
chitect and builder, he said that he
hadn't yet decided, although he
definitely wants the help of profes
sionals who will adhere to his pref
erences. Munger stressed that con
tracting outside companies is in no
way new for the University, which
employed a private architect to
renovate the Law School's class
rooms and library.

"The recent changes to the Law
School are examples of some of
the best architecture on campus,"
he said. "I wanted to do the same."
While it is uncertain whether
Munger's initial interest in con
tracting out the project was influ
enced by his relationship with
Neuman, he admitted that it
"would be fair to say that I didn't
want to work with him."
Still, Munger maintained that
Neuman was the real father of the
project and that their original vi
sion for the new residence was al
most identical. Both men hoped to
model the building after law hous
ing at the University of Michigan,
but tension increased as plans be
came more specific.
"I do not think it had any influ
ence [on Neuman's decision to
leave]," University President John
Hennessy said. "Final decisions on
the project have yet to be made."
Neuman, who also served as
vice provost for planning, was

named architect for the University
of Virginia in November and start
ed his new position on Jan. 1 after
14 years at Stanford. The search
for a replacement has not yet
begun, Hennessy said.

erences. Munger stressed that con
tracting outside companies is in no
way new for the University, which
employed a private architect to
renovate the Law School's class
rooms and library.

"The recent changes to the Law
School are examples of some of
the best architecture on campus,"
he said. "I wanted to do the same."
While it is uncertain whether
Munger's initial interest in con
tracting out the project was influ
enced by his relationship with
Neuman, he admitted that it
"would be fair to say that I didn't
want to work with him."
Still, Munger maintained that
Neuman was the real father of the
project and that their original vi
sion for the new residence was al
most identical. Both men hoped to
model the building after law hous
ing at the University of Michigan,
but tension increased as plans be
came more specific.
"I do not think it had any influ
ence [on Neuman's decision to
leave]," University President John
Hennessy said. "Final decisions on
the project have yet to be made."
Neuman, who also served as
vice provost for planning, was

named architect for the University
of Virginia in November and start
ed his new position on Jan. 1 after
14 years at Stanford. The search
for a replacement has not yet
begun, Hennessy said.
'The most beautiful park
ing garage'
Munger maintains that the
dorm will benefit Stanford's cam
pus.
"If you build really good hous
ing next door to the Law School, it
will be a huge advantage for Stan
ford," Munger said. "It will form a
community that doesn't yet exist in
American education. The students
will educate each other."
The University aims to accom
modate the many graduate stu
dents who have been forced to live
off campus, particularly those
from the Law School, and the new
residence will likely provide more
spaces than necessary in order to
allow for future growth. In the
meantime, these spaces may be
filled with students from varied
graduate programs and even un
dergraduate students.
Munger anticipates that the res
idence will eventually house busi
ness students who would also prof
it from the close proximity to cam
pus and community atmosphere
this housing would provide.
When asked about some of the
more logistical concerns, including
crowding and parking, Munger re
iterated that any project of this
scale poses challenges that require
innovative solutions.
"The current plan is to preserve
every building," he said.
According to Munger, one way
to achieve this is through parking
garages.
"Parking garages are the best
way to preserve the Stanford am
bience. The current plan is to have
a parking garage covered in ivy. It
will be the most beautiful parking
garage and the most green, too."
Both Reidy and Hennessy said
that plans are still in preliminary
stages and that it remains uncer
tain whether the residence will be
built at all. As of now, construction
will likely start in 2004 or 2005, and
the residence will open its doors in
2006.
