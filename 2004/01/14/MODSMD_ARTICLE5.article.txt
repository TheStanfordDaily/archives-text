# Alcohol sales in Terman spark protest, debate
## 
### WHITNEY SADO DESK EDITOR 
Alcoholic beverages were sold in the
Terman Engineering Center's cafeteria
for the first time yesterday, inspiring a
small protest and a meeting with two Uni
versity officials.
The controversy arose over the fact
that alcohol would be sold in close prox
imity with laboratory materials. John
Zimmerman, the graduate student in Civil
and Environmental Engineering who is
spearheading the ongoing dispute, argues
that this is a dangerous procedure.
"My concern is that it doesn't make
sense to sell alcohol where there are labs,"
Zimmerman said. "We're talking about al
cohol being next to radioactive materials,
flammable and compressed gases. As far
as I know, beer and wine have not been
sold as long as Terman has been there."
Zimmerman said he spoke with all of
the major chemical manufacturers he
could think of, including Dow and
DuPont. None of these corporations sell
any alcoholic beverages in the cafeterias
that serve their labs, according to his re
search.
Zimmerman met \vith Dean of Engi
neering Jim Plummer and Senior Associ
ate Dean of Engineering Channing
Robertson for an hour yesterday morning
to discuss his concerns.
Zimmerman said the deans were
"friendly" and "informative" but ulti
mately disagreed with Zimmerman's re
quest that the sale of alcohol be prohibit-

Ed in Terman's cafeteria.
"Their position was that since alcohol is
already sold at a number of locations on
campus that are near labs, it is difficult for
them to justify not allowing it to be sold in
Terman near our lab," Zimmerman said.
"When I pointed out that corporations are
not selling beer and wine near their labs,
Dean Plummer stated that universities are
much more willing to allow the exercise of
personal freedoms, as long as there is no
clear risk involved."
Zimmerman said he intends to pursue
this issue at the University level. He does
not want to expel the new contractor from
Terman; rather, he is operating under the
assumption that the University has the au
thority, according to its contract, to stop
the sale of alcohol for whatever reason.
"I was told by [Associate Vice Presi
dent in the Office of Research Adminis
tration] Anne Hannigan that the person
who originally wrote the contract included
a clause giving the University that power,"
he said.
Zimmerman has started a petition and
says he has already gathered signatures
from the majority of the people with of
fices in Terman's basement the loca
tion of the labs. Although this suggests
that Zimmerman has his colleagues' sup
port on this issue, only a couple of demon
strators were at the protest.
This did not faze Zimmerman, who ex
pected a small turnout.
"I don't plan on shouting," he said. "It's
not my nature, and I don't think it's pro
ductive in this case."
