## NICOLE WRIGHT EAT MY SHORTS, BART: NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND 
### 
My domestic partner and I are sitting together on
a bus that is going nowhere. It is late on a Wednes
day evening. Although we have been together for a
while now, few of my friends have made her
delectable acquaintance. She is doe-eyed, apple
cheeked. Testing her, I suggest that we sit apart, os
tensibly so we can lounge like Route 67 queens on
bright-blue plastic padded thrones. I wonder if it
bodes ill for our relationship that my partner ac
cedes so easily to my request; I sneak a sidelong
gaze at her complacent expression and tell myself,
Don't lose sleep over it.
But I can't sleep, even if I wanted to, for the un
forgiving seats have been molded to the Spartan
glutes of an angular twelve-year-old boy. From
where I am sitting I cannot touch her.
Just then, a craggy old man clambers up the
ridged steps into our chilly little carriage. My part
ner requests a dollar to pay for her ticket and I press
the coins gently into her palm. I think, Your hands
are always warmer
than mine.
"A couple! It's rare to see such a loving couple
these days," croaks the shriveled burgher. He wrig
gles his pelvis off his seat like a wizened Elvis,
thrusts into the air, sighs rapturously, and wraps his
trench coat tightly around himself in glee, hugging
himself.
"Where are you two from? San Francisco? Heh,
heh, heh."
I smile and start to respond, but my partner
shoots me a Look. We have discussed this, what to
say when people inevitably ask about our lifestyle,
and she has warned me not to indulge them. She
whips out a large hardback and brandishes it in front
of her face.
Another elderly man joins our little party. He is
a regal old pimp, complete with faux-jeweled-head
ed cane, long coat with tails, and dapper hat, which
he does not remove, tipped at a rakish angle. On his
neck is an enormous wart. It is turgid, bluish, almost
turquoise, and I cannot help but keep casting furtive
glances at it.
The bus starts up. It's cold—several of the win
dows won't close. Halfway through our silent ride,
the mad hatter, who has been staring at my partner,
turns and gives me the most obscene wink.
Welcome, folks, to the world of mass transit. This
is how the other half lives.
Riding in the bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed (yeah!)
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
—Weird A 1 Yankovich, "Another One Rides the Bus"

As an experiment for the benefit of Stanford
kind, I decide to use masstransit for an entire jour
ney from Palo Alto to Berkeley. This is why, a
month later, I am sitting on a bench at the Caltrain
station. My partner left me two days ago (she said
that she "can't wait" for me any longer, if you really
must know), and so I am alone traveling home for
winter break. But that is not what this column is
about, you schadenfrauder you.
Gearing up for the trip, I gird myself with the
"mass trans" armor I used in high school: jacket,
bulky sweatshirt, saggy jeans. I affect a cold, indig
nant expression not dissimilar to that of Misa Ue
hara fighting through the weeds in "The Hidden
Fortress." I am ready.
I've upped the challenge by traveling on a week
end, when the Caltrain does not run; the substitute
bus lines takes much longer. I do not know it yet,
mercifully, but it will take me six hours to get home,
as compared to one or two by car. I will board a bus,
another bus, a train, another train. And then yet an
other bus. I will survive.
On Sundays, the Marguerite comes only once
every hour on the hour, so I had to take the line
going in the opposite direction to come here, which
takes one hour and fifteen minutes. Other Stanford
students look at my luggage and say: "0h... you're
going... home? On this? You don't have a car? 0h...
We're just using this to get to the ma 11..."
I set some limits to whatever tribulations I might have
to endure. First, I would always have a car.
—"Nickel and Dimed," Barbara Ehrenreich
Desiring to experience this whole transport rig
marole as would the masses, I take as my model the
Great Leader, who once said, "If you want to know
the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eat
ing it yourself... All genuine knowledge originates in
direct experience." If only my co-proletariat
denizens were so succulent. On this bench at the Palo
Alto bus station, I'm squished between a "friendly"
woman and a little man who has plenty of room left
on his side, but insists on giving his briefcase a perch
atop the seat. I emphatically do not want to taste
them. My partner once used pear bath gel... My wist
ful reminiscing is interrupted by a pair of long-in-the
tooth construction workers in tight jeans, who stop
directly in front of me. What a view—if I were Robert
Mapplethorpe, I'd be having a field day; but frankly,
these don't impress me much. For one and a half
hours, Vladerriere, Arsestragon, and I wait for
Godot, or the KX, whichever comes first.

"I thought this bus
was coming a half
hour ago," I politely
tell a leather-jacket
ed chain-smoker be
hind me.
"When it
comes, it comes," she
says, and exhales
wearily. Her lipstick
is bunched in the cor
ners of her mouth.

A recent full-color, full-page ad in the New York
Times (I've been told that kind of space cost up
wards of $200,000) shows a picture of a wide-eyed
girl with the words, "I date guys I meet on the bus."
This is not a bright idea, nor is it likely. People on
the bus are too shy to talk to each other, so they use
trash as transference objects. A man sitting across
from me rolls a tabloid into a tube and, for miles,
rubs it at groin level while trying to stare into my
eyes. Every so often, he grunts. I pretend to sleep.

I am ap
proaching an
escalator at the
Millbrae BART
terminal. I am
the only soul
around save for
a tallish fellow
with an un
kempt mullet
and a toolkit.
Dawdling, he
waits until I

reach the first step, then gets on right behind me. I
can feel his hot breath on my neck. Straight out of
bad film noir.
"Oh, I forgot," I say, enunciating with
Stanislavsky gusto as if I have just entered from
stage left, and scramble down the steps. He follows
suit. I step back on. He steps on. I hop off. He hops
off. Now the "Dueling Banjos" track from "Deliv
erance" is going to be playing in my head for the
rest of the afternoon.
"Look," I say at last. "Just get on." Because
you're sure not getting off if I have anything to say
about it, I think. Chastened, he looks back once at
me before facing forward.
One of my favorite New Yorker covers of all
time depicts a subway fantasy: a man in a fedora,
clutching a pile of books, stares at a devastating
redhead absorbed in a novel, decolletage spilling
out, short skirt, exquisite legs.
But real people who take the subway are not
cute. Judging by the young man who asks me to
read the subway map for him, some are not liter
ate. The inhabitants of my BART car look like ex
tras who didn't get called back for the "Satyricon"
orgy scene: flaking mascara, straggly retro hairdos,
rumpled suits, a faint whiff of odeur de corps. No
wonder we've never heard tell of a "mile-low
club."
I switch to the Richmond line. Two men with
doughy stomachs hanging over their belts plop
down across from me and flip though a porn calen
dar. I am the only female in the subway car. I dis
tract myself by pronouncing the name of the Soy
lent Green-looking dishwashing soap product ad
vertised on the wall in French. Italian. Japanese.
Ibo.
Often when I take public transport, for some
reason, my fellow commuters are compelled to
warn me away from the excess of life. "You remind

me of my daughter, before," says my seatmate.
"Before what?" I ask. "She's in rehab now, got
two little boys. She's working at the —Hotel down
in , I'm proud of her." My subsequent seatmate
clutches my knee when his stop is called. "You
won't get into any of that kinky stuff with any of
them, or the drank, willya? Promise me!" he orders.
His nostrils flare, and his eyeballs are dilated. This
is what Sartre meant when he said "Hell is other
people."
Why do they never play music to mollify the

masses down here? These people could use some
Vivaldi. "The dominant blues syntagm in Ameri
ca," explains scholar Houston Baker, "is an instru
mental imitation of train-wheels-over-track-junc
tures... desire and absence are driving conditions of
blues performance." But the advent of the subway
has conspired to make things quiet here on the
Richmond line, except for a drunk man slurring
"Moon River" to himself. " Arma virumque canoT'
Not he. He sings of Anna Karenina's despera
tion,of the yearning of Baraka's Clay, his Lula's in
scrutable rage.
In cars, we are never subject to the baffling
whims of strangers. We are insulated, protected in
a compact Thermos of warmth, self-preservation,
good music, friends who have been screened for the
more dire socio-pathetic (no, that's not a typo) ten
dencies.
"Excuse me," a man comes up to me and says,
"but are you Persian?" He scrutinizes me.
"You're Persian," he nods. He asks whether I
want to talk about my newfound ethinicity. Per
haps there's an upside to all this lonely stranger
dom. On BART, people assume I'm Persian, les
bian, straight, pubescent, cold uptown girl, at-risk
youth, whatever. And I let them. I cloak myself in
anonymity.
The brand-bus seats of the bus I am going to
ride are already covered with indelible black
scrawls. A girl in a black wig, six-inch-heel thigh
high boots, and little black booty shorts with
"DKNY" stamped on the keister teeters past me
onto the bus.
Just then, my partner shows up, smiling. Elena
has suprised me. I jump in with my beloved sister,
we crank up the radio, and, not a moment too soon,
we leave it all behind.
