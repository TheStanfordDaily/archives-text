# Book Closer
## Some students hit the books after graduation with inner-city and underprivileged children. Teach for America breaks the bubble for these young grads. 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
Most of my teachers done learned me pretty good in
high school, but one teacher, "Ms. Smith," was rather
lacking. "You know I'm getting my paycheck whatever
y'all do, so keep on doing whatever it is y'all do," she
would say, as she switched on the seventh episode of an
Elvis documentary (she divided American history into
three epochs: "the Indians," the Dust Bowl,
"Schindler's List," and Elvis). Those of us unfortunate

enough to be stuck in the back row spent most
of our time dodging fireballs that the kid in
front made with his lighter.
When I catch sight of Beth Berselli '97,
alumni recruiter for Teach for America and
first-year student at the Stanford Business
School, I somehow suspect that she's not the
kind of slacker who considers it educational to
watch decrepit bluesman grilling fluffernutter
sandwiches. With her blow-dried hair, chic
garb, and professional poise, she's the
archetypical Teach for America "corps mem
ber"(read: teacher). Berselli is back on cam
pus to recruit like-minded Stanford students,
"goal-oriented individuals with demonstrated
leadership abilities," at a luncheon this
Wednesday for prospective applicants and a
reception this Thursday for students who have
been accepted early to the program.
Berselli taps a snappy red folder which
she's brought with her, filled with info, on the
desk between us and gets down to business
about the national organization, which is
funded both by the government and by pri
vate sector interests. "Teach for America's
mission can be stated in two parts: in the short
term, recruiting outstanding recent college
grads to teach in low-income urban and rural
public schools...ln the long term, [we're] try
ing to close the achievement gap between mi
nority and non-minority students."
It's a big job, and so the Teach for America
admissions process is very selective: out of
16,000-strong applicant pool last year, only
1,800 hopefuls made the final cut. As Berselli
points out, just getting into Teach for Ameri
ca is comparably as hard as getting into, well,
Stanford. Actually, it's harder: that's an
8.88% admissions rat, for you non-math ma
jors.
The program, however, is open to fuzzies
and techies alike. What seems to set Teach for
America corps members is not their expertise
in specific academic areas so much as a shared
go-getter philosophy. Think a secular version
of the Protestant work ethic. Except with a
relatively modest monetary reward as the
fruit of one's labors: a salary, paid by the
school district, ranging from $20,000 to
$41,000, plus a 4,725 educational stipend for
each of two years of work. Yep, there's a two
year commitment. A warning for flighty types:
that's 312 times as long as Britney Spears'
now-defunct marriage. Choose well.
In fact, all the Teach for America "corps
members" whom I contact are on top of their
stuff. When I e-mail them, some respond at
IM speed. Emily Bobel 'O3, who, appropriate
ly enough, is in the midst of lesson
planning when I contact her, apologizes for
being too brief and then proceeds with a
lengthy, glowing account of her experience as
a TFA corps member. "I was originally placed
in Detroit and then relocated to New York
after the Detroit site closed," she tells me.
Bobel joined TFA in an effort to combat the
educational status quo. "I was frustrated by

the startling statistics of the graduation rates and educa
tion levels of children in lower income levels. The best
way I could actually make a difference was by using my
education, dedication and enthusiasm to teach and in

spire the kids."
Senior Mike Scrafford, Stanford's campaign coordi
nator for TFA, feels that he has opted to pursue his true
calling in life, resisting pressure to do otherwise. Scraf
ford will teach math in rural North Carolina next year.
"Deciding to apply and then join Teach for America was
definitely a difficult choice," Scrafford says. "I personal
ly feel a sense of social pressure at Stanford to go to law
school or med school immediately after graduation or to
join an investment banking or consulting firm. This
pressure is particularly acute because I'm an Economics

major. However, after thinking about what would result
in me being passionate to do my job day after day, I re
alized that some sense of directly serving others would
have to be present in what I do."

Like other Teach for America corps members whom
I contacted, Scrafford said that he was introduced to the
program by word-of-mouth. "After hearing about TFA
from a friend and looking into what it was trying to ac
complish, and more importantly after talking to alums
of the program, it became clear that Teach for America
is a program that I am really excited about becoming a
part of after graduation," he said.
Going out and grabbing that brass ring right after
leaving college is a common pattern for TFA corps
members, who usually plunge into the "real world"

teaching right after college. In conversation, their e
mails and speech alike are filled with exclamation
points, a sign of the potent mix of ambition and social re
sponsibility that fuels them.

"The most challenging part is keeping my lessons ex
citing enough to a) get [the students] to do work and b)
tell me after class how cool science is!" Emily Cuatto
'O3, who taught in the greater New Orleans Area ex
claims.
Cuatto says that she enjoys being able to see the re
sults of the long hours she puts in at the school. "My fa
vorite part of working with the students is seeing their
faces when they have scored well on a test or lab and
begging to take it home to show their parents. Or, per
haps it was all the Christmas cards I got telling me how

thankful they were that I cared about them and
believed in them," Cuatto says.
Inevitably, though, Stanford grads' initial ide
alism was somewhat diminished by confrontation
with day-to-day realities encountered in under
served schools. Cuatto spoke for several others
when she said that class discipline can be a daunt
ing task. "I spend more than half of my day trying
to create a disciplined environment. My students
often refuse to listen to me, follow directions, or
obey the rules," Cuatto said. "It's frustrating
preparing hours of (what you think are) dynamic
lessons and then having to scrap the whole thing
because of a fight, and it's upsetting to know that
you are letting down the other students who do
want to learn because you are taking so much
time dealing with the misbehaving kids."
Stationed in Arizona, Berselli found a similar
challenge in the disparity in her students' readi
ness for school. "One kid didn't know the alpha
bet and another was reading at seventh-grade
level," she said. As most of her fifth-grade stu
dents were Mexican or Mexican-American, lan
guage barriers compounded classroom discipline
problems. Also, Berselli said, "There weren't a
lot of resources... I had a lot of frustration when I
wouldn't find a working Xerox machine. There
weren't enough textbooks. I would turn in a
grant, and, four months later, I still wouldn't have
my money." She shakes her head. "And, you
know, it's my money."
Despite all this, however, Berselli definitely
thinks that her tenure with Teach for America
was worth it. "I completely changed what I want
ed to do. I was burnt out in journalism, and I
thought I'd try a change." Berselli says that after
earning her MBA, she plans to become a superin
tendent. She's also toying with the idea of open
ing a charter school (as other TFA alumni have
done, according to literature supplied by the or
ganization.)
Berselli adds that she still stays in touch with
her students; she even maintains a phone number
in Arizona so they can phone her. "I think all of
my students should go to college. Kids can do
more than people give them credit for."
Although, like Bobel, Cuatto plans to move
onto law school, she likewise believes that she
made the right choice in joining TFA. "I am
entirely satisfied with my decision. I never
knew how challenging it would be, but I also
had no idea how great I would feel about my
work. It's amazing to be in a job where you can
see the results of your influence over the
course of a day, or week, or month. It's great
to see my kids get excited about learning and
know that you are responsible for their enthu
siasm."
For now, Scrafford has inherited the others'
rose-colored glasses, but looks forward to con
fronting the challenges. "I have always been in
terested in education issues and disparities in ac
cess to a good public education in a country that
aspires to offer everyone a chance at a high stan
dard of living." We all know about the problems
in American education. To paraphrase that old
chestnut, these are students willing to put their fu-

tures on the line in order to become part of what will un
doubtedly be a complex and hard-won solution. Now,
why don't you get off your duff? And I don't mean Hi
lary.

An apple for the teacher? Sure, if the underserved school districts (in which Teach for America corps members often work) could
find room in already-strained budgets. Some teachers even lack sufficient quantities of basic materials, such as textbooks.
