# GSC to conduct survey on graduate life
## Questions will address concerns about housing, academic issues and quality of life 
### NEKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
After a busy fall quarter, the Graduate Student Council is gearing up to call
campus-wide attention to academic issues, by working with the Committee on
Graduate Studies to finalize a winter quarter survey for students in every one of
Stanford's seven graduate schools.
Since last spring, a team of graduate students, faculty and staff members have
comprised a subcommittee whose objective is "to conduct a survey to deter
mine the pervasiveness" of academic issues, according to the survey's organiz
er Grace Chang, a student in the medical school.
Chang spoke about the upcoming survey to council members at the Jan. 7
weekly meeting, where members expressed support for the project as one of
their advocacy efforts for the year.
The online survey will ask questions on various aspects of graduate acade
mics, from program requirements and coursework to advising and training for
the future, Chang said, adding that one focus should be the adviser-student re
lationship.
According to council Chair Steve Allison, "some students have great advis
ers and programs, while others can be very frustrating."
Chang, the current graduate student representative on the Faculty Senate
and last year's council chair, explained that the subcommittee was born after a
well-received talk she gave to the Senate on what she calls one of the most press
ing graduate student issues in academics.
The subcommittee currently consists of four other graduate students, two
members of the faculty, and Dean of Research and Graduate Policy Claudia
Schweikert.
As council chair, Allison has lent financial and labor support to the survey
and has since reviewed a draft of the list of survey questions.
Chang hopes to see the survey's results presented not only before the Facul
ty Senate, the point of origin for academic policies at Stanford, but also in other

relevant forums and journals.
Although the development of the survey "has already gotten some parts of
the University administration to be more aware of academic problems that
graduate students must deal with," Allison cited the need for "concrete data
about academic issues" if changes are to be made.
Chang emphasized that the survey will not merely identify the important is
sues, but rather, motivate the search for solutions.
To date, Chang is unaware of any previous large-scale survey "on how
satisfied students are with their academic progress," adding that this quar
ter's project is unique because its "express purpose" is to initiate policy
changes.
"The results of the survey will be used to create University policies and
mechanisms to deal with the problems which arise," she predicted.
