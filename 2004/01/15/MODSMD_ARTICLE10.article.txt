QMy dorm is going on its ski trip
this weekend. I am from balmy
Southern California, and I al
ready think Stanford is hellishly
>w should I dress to keep warm in
Tahoe?
A Are you joking? Or did some
one dare you to ask a dumb
question? Or, maybe, are you
the type that pipes up during
lecture? Like every single lecture? Multiple
times?
Well, at risk that you're saying yes to

one or more of those questions, I'll give you

a serious answer anyway.
I should add, though, that
if all your answers are ac
tually no, I'm not too con
fident you should go at all.
It's just that I wouldn't
want you to end up pok
ing your eye out with your
own ski.
But to answer your
question: During the day
at least, it's actually not

too chilly over there. Of course it's snowy,

but when you're moving around you warm
up pretty quickly. A lot of times, I end up
peeling down to a T-shirt.
I should probably mention though, that
I'm from Michigan. See, back home, even
60-degree weather will prompt people
(well, girls and the occasional old man) to
bust out the short shorts. Plus, I kinda ski a
lot, so I probably move around a lot more
than ski virgins like you might. And that's
even accounting for the arm-flailing.
Probably the best advice I can give you
is to dress in layers. If you have tight-woven
shirts and a hat, and a waterproof jacket,

gloves and pants, just bring those and you
can probably even return that sweater you
bought. Honestly. Even if you think you
might go skiing at night which I don't re
ally see happening you should only need
a scarf and a hoodie in addition. And final
ly, pack lots of socks.
Last but not least, bring stuff that you
don't mind getting alcohol spilled on. If you
can't figure out why, honey, don't email me
just ask your RA.
