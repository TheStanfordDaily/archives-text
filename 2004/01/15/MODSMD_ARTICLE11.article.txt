## Bookstore gets some competition 
### 
It's no secret that the Stanford Bookstore
sells class books at high prices. For years, the
Bookstore provided the only local source for
students to buy those obscure academic

texts their professors
assign. With some
textbooks costing
more than $l5O, stu
dents can spend as
much as $4OO a quar
ter for their books,
many of which can't
be sold back to the
Bookstore at the end
of the term.
Fortunately, due
to the efforts of the
ASSU and of the op
portunities accorded
by the Internet, new
textbook suppliers
have broken into the
market. This influx of
books irtto the Stan

ford market has forced the Bookstore to lower
prices at least marginally.
From Jan. 5-8, the ASSU organized an event
that sold psych 1, chem 33 /133, physics 51 and
math 51 textbooks. The event was created in
order to lower the costs of living on campus.
According to ASSU vice president Joey Na
toli, the price of a used physics book was lowered

at the Bookstore recently because of this compe
tition. And Stanford students can only hope that
this program will continue to force the Bookstore
to lower prices in the future.

Though he calls the re
cent event a success, Na
toli said he hopes to ex
pand the program to in
clude a greater selection
of books in the future.
As the Stanford Book
store's prices remain
high, efforts on campus
and online bookstores
have been taking busi
ness away from the on
campus bookstore.
Many students even sell
used books to each
other, either via su.mar
ket or to friends and
dormmates. We hope
that the Bookstore
learns from this compe

tition that it needs to sell books at the new market
prices. This is not just good business, but good
practice to make a S4OK education a little more
affordable.
We applaud the ASSU's efforts to offer alter
natives to purchasing books from the Stanford
Bookstore. The program is a step in the right di
rection for improving student life at Stanford.

"Though the Stanford Book
store 's prices remain high, ef
forts on campus... have been
taking business away from the
on-campus bookstore.
