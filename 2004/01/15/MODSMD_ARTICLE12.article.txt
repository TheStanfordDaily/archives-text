# It ain't right to nix Pub Night
## 
### 
At 5:54 a.m. Monday, the senior class
presidents dispatched an e-mail,
which included an overdue update
on the status of "elite agent" 004,
who is more commonly known as Shayna Fer
nandez. Apparently, for some time now Fer
nandez has been scouring the Eastern Region
of the Oamigzwareytsus Islands in search of an
elusive Crystal envelope, which the senior
class presidents assure us contains the location
of the Senior Formal. We kid you not. The se
nior class presidents actually sent this e-mail to
the senior class list, not only insulting their
constituents' right to a reasonable explanation
to a straightforward question regarding an
MIA public official, but also clogging the in
boxes of 1,600 people who deserve better.
And then, there was more.
In the same e-mail, the senior class presi
dents announced that Senior Pub Night, the
traditional trek to establishments such as the
Dutch Goose and the Nut House, was canceled
this week in favor of a scaled down Wednesday
night at the Treehouse. Earlier this week, the
senior class presidents stated that many people
had ski trips and that they hoped to save
money for the other pub nights, reasoning,
"those Margarita shuttles ain't cheap, cow
boy." We don't have a problem with the Tree
house per se, but expecting some 1,600 seniors

to swarm the Treehouse en masse in a quest to
acquire a senior class T-shirt seems like a poor
substitute for Thursday night's usual revelry.
Did Fernandez's disappearance cause this
void in the senior class's social schedule? We
don't know. It would be irresponsible of us to
suggest it did. Only the senior class presidents
can tell us that. But if they choose to provide a
similar explanation to our questions posed in
Monday's editorial, we would rather not have
any explanation at all. Especially since many
are still waiting for a real, thorough and suffi
cient explanation to the last question we posed.
In last Monday's email to the class, they
stated, "Dang, we didn't know you cared about
us that much!" Sorry, but the events of senior
year do matter to many people, as does plan
ning future reunion events and
activities.While many people at this Universi
ty might care little about the happenings in
volving senior class presidents, it is not too
much to ask that they treat the senior class
with the respect they deserve?
Such cockiness seems odd considering that
in last year's election, the current class presi
dents who ran as "Fire it up," beat out at least
four other slates by only a few votes. Clearly
there were many people who wanted to serve
as senior class presidents. It just doesn't look
like the winners do.
