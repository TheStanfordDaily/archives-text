## ORDER IN THE COURT? Practicing for 'The Practice' 
### 
My very first column in
this paper listed off
some bad reasons to
go to law school. I now
realize that I was remiss in not list
ing perhaps the number one bad
reason: An addiction to "Ally
Mc√üeal," "The Practice," "Law and
Order," "Law and Order: SUV,"
"Law and Order: SVU" or "Law
and Order: Jaywalking."
There are a few reasons why
such an addiction is a bad reason for
going to law school. First, it's rarely
a good idea to make vocational de
cisions based upon jobs that look
good on television. If it were, I'd
make my living wearing a hairy blue
Muppet suit and eating other peo
ple's ridiculously large chocolate
chip cookies.
Second, most law school classes
have nothing to do with anything
you see on law-related TV shows.
For instance, my first semester Civil
Procedure class spent a great deal of
time on "personal jurisdiction," the
doctrine concerning whether or not
a particular defendant can be sued
in a particular state. Unfortunately,
we spent so much time on this
bedrock concept of civil procedure
that we ran out of time for more
Nielsen-worthy topics such as what
to do when your client insists he's
Santa Claus.
Third, being a trial attorney is
really, really hard. Television
makes it seem ridiculously easy.
Someone walks into your office and

tells you they have a fascinating
case coming to trial in 15 minutes.
You agree to take the case, review
the relevant documents during the
opening credits, and you're ready to
go. You get your avuncular witness
es to tell their sob story on direct.
You show on cross that none of the
opposing party's witnesses possess
es any of the five senses, and, more
over, all of them were all in Sch

enectady when
the alleged inci
dent took place.
Finally, you deliv
er a closing so
powerful that the
jury members are
ready to give you
custody of their
firstborn chil
dren. Heck, if
you're Perry

Mason, you never even get to the
closing: You just browbeat a confes
sion out of whoever is on the stand
around 47 minutes past the hour,
pack up your briefcase, and go
home.
Unfortunately, I'm now
learning that it doesn't work like
that in real life. I'm enrolled in an
intensive two week course on
"Advocacy Skills" (the exception
to the general rule that law school
classes don't teach you what to do
in trial) and I'm beginning to
doubt I can ever be as good as Cal
ista Flockhart.
Objecting is one thing that looks

much easier on television. Even
when my objections are sustained,
it's usually by accident:
ME (standing): Objection, your
honor! Leading the witness!
REAL LAWYER ACTING
AS JUDGE: This is cross-examina
tion, counsel. You're allowed to
lead the witness. But I'll sustain on
hearsay grounds.
ME: Woo-hoo! (Exchanges a
chest-bump with co-counsel.)
Consider also this example of
feedback after an exercise where I
questioned potential jurors:
REAL LAWYER: I really liked
how you asked the jurors what they
were thinking about when they first
saw the plaintiff in a neck brace.
Drawing attention to the plight of
your client is gold when you're the
plaintiff's attorney.
ME (sheepishly): Actually, I
was the defense attorney.
REAL LAWYER: Urn...might
want to make that clear to the jury,
then.
I bet Sam Waterston never
makes that mistake. But, then
again, he never gets the chance to:
On TV, the jury just appears magi
cally during the commercial break.

Eric Feigin is busily preparing for a
mock trial next weekend. If anyone
has an available tape of that "Brady
Bunch" episode where Carol and the
kids go to court over a car accident,
please contact him at
