# UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN
## The
						quest for fluency 
### SARAH LUSTBADER STAFF COLUMNIST 
The second best compliment
you can receive as an American in
Italy is being taken for an Italian
upon sight. This means, at least in
1 Florence, that you are dressed up
and look fabulous, even at 8 a.m.,
you own big sunglasses, you have a
cigarette in your hand (or you're
fishing for one in your bag,) and
you give off an air that makes oth
ers feel unworthy of your attention.
I received this compliment rarely. I
don't smoke.
The greatest honor of all, how
ever, lies in being mistaken for an
Italian after speaking. This one is a
bit trickier to accomplish. Not only
must you fulfill all requirements for
looking like an Italian (see above),
but you must also speak with "flu
ency." I arrived in Florence think
ing that I could surely achieve this
goal of "fluency." Living with an
Italian family that speaks very little
English will provide a fun and easy
way to reach fluency, I had thought.
Au contraire.
Here are a few obstacles that
each day were thrown in my direc

tion: Before my morning coffee (a
time when I ordinarily expect abso
lutely nothing of those around me
so that the same can be asked of
me), I would be wracking my brain
for the Italian word for "mi
crowave" and the proper preposi
tion to use in a comparison.
Then I had to start in with the
conjugating. Apparently mumbling
the ends of your words doesn't cut
it in Italian the way it does in En
glish, because people tend to get
confused as to whether you're say
ing he got arrested, you got arrest
ed or worst case scenario I
got arrested. It seems trivial, the
difference between an "a" and an
"o," but, believe me, it's a big deal.
I'd get to my studio art class, at
which point we would all engage in
a lively round of "what did the pro
fessor just tell us to do in his rapid
Italian with a heavy Florentine ac
cent?" Are we supposed to do five
sketches and then a drawing or
spend five minutes on each draw
ing? Maybe he said that we should
be smoking at least five cigarettes
per drawing .. .
At the dinner table, an optimal

time to engage in Italian conversa
tion, my host sisters and mom
would often enquire about my per
sonal life. This process was almost
excruciating at first, and not be
cause I'm shy. I'm not shy at all.
It isn't easy describing the intri
cacies of your last romantic fling in
another language. Knowing vague
ly synonymous words no longer
suffice: You need an awareness of
the connotations of each word in
addition to a keen sense of the cul
tural differences that make dating
here different from dating there.
Also, you might want a vague grasp
of what is deemed appropriate and
inappropriate behavior, so that
your host mom doesn't get the
wrong (or right) idea about you.
Speaking fluently was suddenly
very involved. I became discour
aged, and then even more discour
aged by my inability to say "dis
couraged" in Italian so I could ex
press my discouragement to my
host family.
Somehow, though, without my
noticing, I began to understand
