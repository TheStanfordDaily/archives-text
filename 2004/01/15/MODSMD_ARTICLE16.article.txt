IPs not her RA's fault she doesn't
participate in dorm activities

Monday's article about EAST
House ("Monkey Business," Jan.
12) unfairly represented our Resi
dent Assistant, Wael Salloum. In its
correct context, the house meeting
anecdote I supplied was meant to
highlight my own scarceness at
EAST, not my RA's negligence.
Salloum is a great RA precisely be
cause he respects my choice to
spend time outside of EAST, and
yes, he knows each resident of the
house. Furthermore, I have never
expected ResEd to engineer "my
community" for me. Students make
their community what they will, and
for some, piled-on residential pro
gramming isn't the priority.

Protesters spark more laughs
than debate

I would like to thank Mr. Zim
merman and Mr. Tang for their
comic relief ... err, I mean protest

ing on Tuesday ("Alcohol sales in
Terman spark protest, debate," Jan.
14). I haven't laughed that hard in a
while.
It is unfortunate that Mr. Zim
merman believes that his coworkers
in the Terman basement are so im
mature that they are incapable of
resisting a tall frosty beer before
playing with toxic chemicals. Per
haps he can petition his department
to include a "don't drink at the lab"
section in their safety orientation.
Better yet, he can stand outside his
coworkers labs with a breathalyzer,
so instead of foisting his distrust of
his coworkers upon the rest of us he
can directly address any potential
problems that he sees, and leave us
beer loving people who don't play
with chemicals (and walk home)
alone.

More questions need to be asked
in regard to Law School housing

I do not believe the correct
questions are being asked with re
gards to the proposed Law School

housing.
The first I would ask is might
there be another possible location.
For example, the reserved area next
to the Schwab Center seems it
would be an ideal place for a new
residence, and in fact there is plan
to build housing there in the future.
It is away from the center of cam
pus, would foster a community of
Law students, and would be geo
graphically (and programmatically)
close to the Business School resi
dence.
The second and possibly more
important question is how will the
campus be affected during con
struction. The plan is to reroute a
delivery road, move two buildings,
move approximately 300 parking
spaces and then build a massive res
idence. Will this affect traffic on
Campus Drive? Will the noise af
fect students in Stern and the Row?
Will the delivery route still be
open? Are we going to temporarily
lose the bike shop, the Rogers
house, the Owen house and 300 or
more parking spaces? What will we
do if that happens?
