IPs not her RA's fault she doesn't
participate in dorm activities

Monday's article about EAST
House ("Monkey Business," Jan.
12) unfairly represented our Resi
dent Assistant, Wael Salloum. In its
correct context, the house meeting
anecdote I supplied was meant to
highlight my own scarceness at
EAST, not my RA's negligence.
Salloum is a great RA precisely be
cause he respects my choice to
spend time outside of EAST, and
yes, he knows each resident of the
house. Furthermore, I have never
expected ResEd to engineer "my
community" for me. Students make
their community what they will, and
for some, piled-on residential pro
gramming isn't the priority.

Protesters spark more laughs
than debate

I would like to thank Mr. Zim
merman and Mr. Tang for their
comic relief ... err, I mean protest

ing on Tuesday ("Alcohol sales in
Terman spark protest, debate," Jan.
14). I haven't laughed that hard in a
while.
It is unfortunate that Mr. Zim
merman believes that his coworkers
in the Terman basement are so im
mature that they are incapable of
resisting a tall frosty beer before
playing with toxic chemicals. Per
haps he can petition his department
to include a "don't drink at the lab"
section in their safety orientation.
Better yet, he can stand outside his
coworkers labs with a breathalyzer,
so instead of foisting his distrust of
his coworkers upon the rest of us he
can directly address any potential
problems that he sees, and leave us
beer loving people who don't play
with chemicals (and walk home)
alone.

More questions need to be asked
in regard to Law School housing

I do not believe the correct
questions are being asked with re
gards to the proposed Law School

housing.
The first I would ask is might
there be another possible location.
For example, the reserved area next
to the Schwab Center seems it
would be an ideal place for a new
residence, and in fact there is plan
to build housing there in the future.
It is away from the center of cam
pus, would foster a community of
Law students, and would be geo
graphically (and programmatically)
close to the Business School resi
dence.
The second and possibly more
important question is how will the
campus be affected during con
struction. The plan is to reroute a
delivery road, move two buildings,
move approximately 300 parking
spaces and then build a massive res
idence. Will this affect traffic on
Campus Drive? Will the noise af
fect students in Stern and the Row?
Will the delivery route still be
open? Are we going to temporarily
lose the bike shop, the Rogers
house, the Owen house and 300 or
more parking spaces? What will we
do if that happens?
I believe the haste in this project
is completely undue. First, Crothers
Hall offers priority for Law stu
dents, which can be used to build a
community of law students if that is
what is currently desired.
Second, first-year law students
(and all grad students)who apply by
the housing deadlines and are will
ing to live anywhere are guaranteed
housing.
Third, this winter, all single,
continuing students who did not
severely limit their choices were ac
tually assigned in the assignment
round. Students who are off-cam
pus typically want to be there or

could not get the studio apartment
they wanted.
Fourth, living off-campus is not
as prohibitively expensive as it was
just three years ago. The least-ex
pensive rooms on campus are the
Crothers double-occupancy rooms
at just under $4OO per month. But
the more popular studios and sin
gle-occupancy rooms range from
about $7OO per month to well over
$BOO per month. Schwab goes for
about $l,OOO per month.
A quick browse through Com
munity Housing's database of
rentals reveals multiple listings for
private rooms in shared houses for
$6OO or less. These can often be
rented month-to-month or short
term unlike university housing and
are often far nicer than university
rooms. Cars are not necessary to

live in Palo Alto or Menlo Park, but
even then, a large number of grad
students do own a car.
I just do not believe there is the
urgency to justify the speed with
which this proposed dorm has
moved forward.
I think that as a University, we
need to step back to see how best to
plan the layout of our campus.
Once this building is built, there is
no going back. I think more careful
analysis must be conducted and
then the proposal tweaked, re
thought or possibly changed in
favor of something more practical
in the long run. We cannot get in a
habit of carelessly using our limited
space here on campus.
