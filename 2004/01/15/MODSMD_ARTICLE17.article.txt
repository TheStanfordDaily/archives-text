## New classes on Charlie Hustle, Bracketology and Childress's 'Fro 
### 
There's no better way to put it. Shopping
just isn't my bag or my Medium
Brown Bag either.
Putting my Christmas shopping off to
the last minute every year probably doesn't help
my negative attitude toward one of America's fa
vorite pastimes. But, honestly, does it get any
worse than an overly pressing can-I-help-you
with-anything sales clerk?
Yeah, you actually can help me with some
thing. Give me a second to figure out what store
I'm in. I can't be the only one who feels this way.
Class shopping, however, is a whole new bag.
Chances are you've already got a pretty good idea
of what classes you want to take this quarter, es
pecially if you're a freshman with I-Hum and
PWR still tying you down like the proverbial
monkey that recently vacated Peyton Manning's
back.

If you're PreMed .. . well, I
guess you've pretty much got
your classes planned out until
the end of time or when the
Red Sox win a World Series,
whichever comes first.
But if your class schedule
this quarter isn't set in stone
perhaps you're thinking about
finding a replacement for that 9
a.m. death wish be sure to
give these late additions to the

Stanford Bulletin a look. There are some good
GER-satisfiers to be found in the bunch and some
quality subjects taught by an extraordinary cast of
visiting professors.
STAT 65 Bracketology 101
Professor: Lunardi, Joe
Details: If the letters RPI mean absolutely
nothing to you, this introductory class is just what
you need. Wow your college hoops-watching
friends with your ability to project the 65-team
men's basketball tournament field two months
before the Big Dance! Learn how to calculate
what teams are on the bubble, who will ultimate
ly make the cut and who will be left out come Se
lection Sunday. No prerequisites, no papers and
no midterms. Half of final grade will be projecting
tournament field the night before brackets are re
leased. The other half will be based on perfor
mance in class bracket pool. Don't be left on the
bubble, sign up now!
HAIR 101 Pick-and-Roll
Professor: Childress, Josh
Details: What's the secret to J-Chil's ill game?
No, not his Afro, but it sure does make him stand
out even more on the court. Find out how you,
too, can rock the fresh Childress 'Do in style and,
who knows, he might show you a sick baseline
move or two. Hair required. Game optional. Pref
erence to Sixth Man Club members.
FINANCE 103 (Formerly ETHICS 101)
Vegas, Baby, Vegas
Professor: Rose, Pete
Details: Baseball's all-time leading hit leader,
Charlie Hustle (in more ways than one) himself,
reveals the ins and outs of sports betting in this
one-time only course offering. From his No. 1 rule
of gambling, when in doubt, bet against the Reds,
to how to hold a 14-year poker face and then
admit you were bluffing, this class is high class
through and through. Stanford athletes are wel
come. The Honor Code does not apply and the
final consists of an essay on why Rose should be in
the Hall of Fame.
CHEM 8 (Team) Chemistry
Professor: Bryant, Kobe
Details: Learn the latest in shoulder therapy,
plus how to get along with Shaq and keep a team
chock full of future Hall of Famers from sponta
neously combusting.
FOOD 5 Soup for You
Professor: McNabb, Donovan
Details: Do you yearn for Campbell's Chunky
Soup like a construction worker on the cold
streets of Philadelphia? In this one-unit culinary
class, Donovan McNabb and his mother will fill
you up right with two great Campbell's soup
recipes: microwave and stove-top. Course will in
clude guest lecture from former Stanford hard
hitter John Lynch in full uniform, no less
and will tackle deep questions like, "Why does
Donovan's Chunky Soup always spoil in the NFC
title game?" Go Panthers.
HISTORY 1991 The Redskins Under
Gibbs
Professor: Gibbs, Joe
Details: Relive the glory days of the Fun
Bunch, the Hogs and the Posse with anecdotes
from the coach who led the fabled franchise to
three Super Bowl titles (and who will make it four
in the near future). Read up on great leaders like
Doug Williams and Mark Rypien, and go deep
into the sad unraveling of the dynasty in the past
decade under the likes of Norv Turner, Marty
Schottenheimer and Steve Spurrier. (Aside:
Teevens should woo Spurrier to fill the Cardinal's
open offensive coordinator position. After a pair
of sad seasons apart, the two could flourish once
again together)
PUBLPOL 007 The Jump Ball in the 21st
Century and Beyond
Professor: Vitale, Dick
Details: The alternating possession rule in col
lege basketball is awful with a capital-A, baby!
It's a crime to punish a great defensive play! It's
time to get rid of that rule! Every lecture will con
sist of Dickie-V's reasons for doing so, of which
there are exactly two.
Happy shopping! And don't forget your gift
receipt.

There's no better way to put it. Shopping
just isn't my bag or my Medium
Brown Bag either.
Putting my Christmas shopping off to
the last minute every year probably doesn't help
my negative attitude toward one of America's fa
vorite pastimes. But, honestly, does it get any
worse than an overly pressing can-I-help-you
with-anything sales clerk?
Yeah, you actually can help me with some
thing. Give me a second to figure out what store
I'm in. I can't be the only one who feels this way.
Class shopping, however, is a whole new bag.
Chances are you've already got a pretty good idea
of what classes you want to take this quarter, es
pecially if you're a freshman with I-Hum and
PWR still tying you down like the proverbial
monkey that recently vacated Peyton Manning's
back.

If you're PreMed .. . well, I
guess you've pretty much got
your classes planned out until
the end of time or when the
Red Sox win a World Series,
whichever comes first.
But if your class schedule
this quarter isn't set in stone
perhaps you're thinking about
finding a replacement for that 9
a.m. death wish be sure to
give these late additions to the

Stanford Bulletin a look. There are some good
GER-satisfiers to be found in the bunch and some
quality subjects taught by an extraordinary cast of
visiting professors.

nothing to you, this introductory class is just what

friends with your ability to project the 65-team
men's basketball tournament field two months
before the Big Dance! Learn how to calculate
what teams are on the bubble, who will ultimate
ly make the cut and who will be left out come Se
lection Sunday. No prerequisites, no papers and
no midterms. Half of final grade will be projecting
tournament field the night before brackets are re
leased. The other half will be based on perfor
mance in class bracket pool. Don't be left on the
bubble, sign up now!
HAIR 101 Pick-and-Roll
Professor: Childress, Josh
Details: What's the secret to J-Chil's ill game?
No, not his Afro, but it sure does make him stand
out even more on the court. Find out how you,
too, can rock the fresh Childress 'Do in style and,
who knows, he might show you a sick baseline
move or two. Hair required. Game optional. Pref
erence to Sixth Man Club members.
FINANCE 103 (Formerly ETHICS 101)
Vegas, Baby, Vegas
Professor: Rose, Pete
Details: Baseball's all-time leading hit leader,
Charlie Hustle (in more ways than one) himself,
reveals the ins and outs of sports betting in this
one-time only course offering. From his No. 1 rule
of gambling, when in doubt, bet against the Reds,
to how to hold a 14-year poker face and then
admit you were bluffing, this class is high class
through and through. Stanford athletes are wel
come. The Honor Code does not apply and the
final consists of an essay on why Rose should be in
the Hall of Fame.

chock full of future Hall of Famers from sponta

Soup like a construction worker on the cold
streets of Philadelphia? In this one-unit culinary
class, Donovan McNabb and his mother will fill
you up right with two great Campbell's soup
recipes: microwave and stove-top. Course will in
clude guest lecture from former Stanford hard
hitter John Lynch in full uniform, no less
and will tackle deep questions like, "Why does
Donovan's Chunky Soup always spoil in the NFC
title game?" Go Panthers.
HISTORY 1991 The Redskins Under
Gibbs
Professor: Gibbs, Joe
Details: Relive the glory days of the Fun
Bunch, the Hogs and the Posse with anecdotes
from the coach who led the fabled franchise to
three Super Bowl titles (and who will make it four
in the near future). Read up on great leaders like
Doug Williams and Mark Rypien, and go deep
into the sad unraveling of the dynasty in the past
decade under the likes of Norv Turner, Marty
Schottenheimer and Steve Spurrier. (Aside:
Teevens should woo Spurrier to fill the Cardinal's
open offensive coordinator position. After a pair
of sad seasons apart, the two could flourish once
again together)
