# Senior Gill leads No. 10 Cardinal
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
What do you get when you mix seven
rookies and a potential Olympian?
Add two sophomores and one junior,
and you have the No. 10 ranked Stanford
men's gymnastics team.
The team's goal for the season is to be
among the six teams competing at the
NCAA finals. The gymnasts look to have
the work ethic and talent to do so, but with
seven rookies on an 11-man team, they
will have to clear the hurdle of inexperi
ence first.
"We're a pretty young and inexperi
enced team. Our captain Dan Gill is a
rock-solid anchor though," said Thorn
Glielmi, who is entering his second season
as head coach.
Senior Gill is the reigning NCAA
champion on vault, a three time Ail-

American and a national team member in
the hunt to qualify for the 2004 Olympics.
Gill is favored to win the NCAA All-
Around title this year and is also gunning
for two event titles out of floor, vault and
high bar.
However, as the lone senior on the
team, Gill's primary goal is to lead the
Cardinal to the NCAA finals. According
to Gill, this could be a challenge given the
team's relative inexperience.
"It's important for the new guys to get
the experience they'll need this year and
in future years," Gill said. "I try to lead by
example and not let them feel discour
aged, so that they can realize their poten
tial. They are all really talented."
Although the new team has talent
six of the seven rookies have competed
multiple times in the Junior Olympics
Glielmi maintained that his gymnasts'
greatest asset lies in their ability to work

hard.
"Our strength is definitely our work
ethic," he said. "We have a great group of
guys who work hard and enjoy what
they're doing."
At Tuesday night's practice, most of
the gymnasts stayed for extra strength
training, technique drills and stretching an
hour after practice had officially ended.
According to freshman Peter Derman,
this is nothing unusual, but rather the
norm for team practices.
"We stay late because we want to be
here and we want to get better," Derman
said.
The team's work ethic shows up in the
classroom as well. The gymnasts have a
team GPA of 3.475, the highest mark for
men's gymnastics team in the NCAA and
the third highest for men's teams at Stan
ford.
Derman's goal for his freshman season

is to be "one of those ... what's it called
when you get top honors in the NCAA?,"
he asked, revealing his inexperience.
"An All-American," his teammates re
sponded with a laugh.
Derman and fellow freshman Alex
Schorsch have the talent to be All-Ameri
cans on the rings, said Gill, who calls the
two rookies "proteges" of team manager,
Marshall Erwin, 2002 NCAA rings cham
pion.
Erwin has stayed on as team manager
while he finishes a double major in philos
ophy and computer science and David
Durante, a class of 'O2 alumnus of the Car
dinal gymnastics team, still trains with the
team everyday in pursuit of a birth on the
U.S. Olympic team.
"Dave is a model gymnast in terms of
his technique and work ethic," Gill said.

Senior Dan Gill competes on the rings last season. Gill is the only senior on this year's men's gymnastics team, which is ranked tenth in the country going into the season.
On a team with seven freshmen, Gill's experience and leadership should be invaluable. Gill is the reigning NCAA champion on vault, a three-time Ail-American and the
favorite to win the NCAA All-Around title this year.
