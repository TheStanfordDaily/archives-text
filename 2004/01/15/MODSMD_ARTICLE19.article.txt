Wrestling takes on Oregon tonight
The Stanford men's wrestling team is
set to host league rival Oregon tonight
in what should be a tough league
matchup for the Cardinal (3-4).
The Cardinal is looking to shake off
a devastating 23-18 loss to No. 23 Cal
State Bakersfield this past Sunday, as
the Cardinal blew a tight lead with red
shirt freshman Brian Perry (165) get
ting pinned in the decisive last match.

Stanford comes into tonight's dual led
by juniors Matt Gentry (157) and Brad
Metzler (141), who are both off having
outstanding years so far. Both are
ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10 in their re
spective weights, while nationally Gen
try is ranked N0.5 and Metzler No. 20.
Against Oregon, Gentry will be
looking to continue his perfect season,
as the junior enters the dual with an un
blemished 23-0 record including six
pins.
In addition to Gentry and Metzler,
sophomores Luis Vendrall (149) and
Imad Kharbush (174) and senior John
Garfinkel (184) are also coming off im
pressive wins last weekend. Vendrall
notched a clutch pin against the Road
runners on Sunday, which, for a mo
ment, seemed to secure a Cardinal vic
tory in the second-to-last match of the
dual.
Tonight's showdown against the
Ducks will take place at Burnham
Pavilion at 7 p.m.

season poll
