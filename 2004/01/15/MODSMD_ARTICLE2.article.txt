# Senate approves bill to allow Cordell to serve
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
At a meeting yesterday that was
attended by Stanford and Palo Alto
representatives, the state Senate

Local Government
Committee ap
proved a bill to
amend a law that
prohibits Palo Alto
from conducting
business with Stan
ford due to Vice
Provost for Campus
Relations LaDoris
Cordell's associa
tion with both.
State Senator
Byron Sher will
take the bill to the
senate floor next
week. Because it is
an urgency bill, it
will require a two
thirds vote to pass in

the senate. Should it pass, it will be
sent to the assembly and then to the
governor's office.
The bill was introduced by Sher
and would amend section 1090 of the
government code to exempt all non
profit organizations including

those set up as trusts, such as Stan
ford. Section 1090 forbids city coun
cils from negotiating contracts with a
corporation for which a city council
member works and has halted all
business between Stanford and Palo

Alto since Cordell
took her seat as a city
councilperson on Jan.
1.
The problem was
not anticipated be
cause Stanford em
ployees and people af
filiated with the Uni
versity including
Sher have com
monly held seats on
the city council with
out any trouble due to
the handful of exemp
tions to the law. Sher
served as mayor of
Palo Alto and also
taught at the Stanford
Law School. None of

those exemptions apply to Cordell,
though.
The bill was approved with a four
to one vote, with Senator Dennis
Hollingsworth opposing it.


LaDoris Cordell
Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham,
acting City Attorney Wynn Furth
and a member of the Stanford legal
department attended the meeting in
Sacramento in support of the bill.
"Senator Sher introduced the
bill and explained why it was neces
sary, and he explained that he had
represented Palo Alto and was able
to do so successfully," Beecham
said. "I spoke for a few minutes and
explained that the community has
enthusiastically elected Cordell,
and we need this bill in order to pro
ceed with the business we have with
Stanford."

One Palo Alto resident was also
present to speak against the bill.
Beecham said the trip to Sacra
mento was worthwhile because "you
can never take anything for granted
you need to go and represent
your arguments in the best possible
way."
Until the situation can be re
solved, the city council has simply
opted to hold off on negotiating any
contracts with Stanford. Even
though there are many ongoing con
tractual negotiations between the
city and Stanford, dealing with
everything from the Stanford Shop
ping Center to Marguerite sched
ules, none was so pressing that it
could not be put on hold for at least
the first quarter of this year.
