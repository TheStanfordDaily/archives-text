## 
### Elizabeth Newman DAILY BRUIN (U. CALIFORNIA-LOS ANGELES 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES UCLA men's
basketball coach Ben Howland stressed im
proved rebounding as a necessity in this week's
games against Arizona State and Arizona, espe
cially for sophomore centers Michael Fey and
Ryan Hollins.
"They've got to do a better job," Howland
said.
In conference play, the pair has combined for
only 16 rebounds in 160 minutes.
During Saturday's 86-84 overtime victory
against Washington, Fey started at center and
played 39 minutes, but did not grab one rebound.
Hollins played for 17 minutes and only secured a
single rebound on the defensive end of the court.
Two days earlier against Washington State,

Hollins snatched two rebounds and Fey did not
pull down any.
"We're hoping to get better as the season pro
gresses," Howland said. "It is something we're
going to emphasize in practice the next couple
days."
Walcott to remain at point guard
Howland confirmed that redshirt junior Ryan
Walcott will remain UCLA's backup point guard
after a lackluster performance against Washing
ton on Saturday night. After junior Cedric Boze
man committed two fouls only two seconds apart
and fouled out with six minutes left in regulation
play, Walcott entered to finish the contest but lost
a nine-point lead, forcing the game into overtime.
Melting in the face of Washington's press, Wal
cott missed all four of his attempted field goals
and all three of his 3-point attempts, and turned
the ball over three times.

"Ryan will be fine," Bozeman said. "Ryan
knows when he goes in, he'll play well. We just
need to keep pumping confidence in him."
Injury Report
Injured shooting guard junior Brian Morrison
is unlikely to play in this week's games after rein
juring his hamstring during a walk-through be
fore Thursday night's game against Washington
State.
"It's unfortunate," Howland said. "We'd like
to get him back."
Senior T.J. Cummings, who injured his right
big toe against Oregon State, has been continuing
a treatment including ice, heat and ultra-sound,
as well as metal inserts and a cushion in his shoes
to prevent movement.
"It's like I got a baby in my foot," he said.
Although the injury is still bothering him, Cum
mings says he thinks it will heal soon.
