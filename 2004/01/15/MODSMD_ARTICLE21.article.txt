Oregon State University and Ari
zona State University have agreed to
switch dates for the 2004 football sea
son, officials at both schools an
nounced Tuesday.
The Pacific-10 Conference opener
for both programs will be played
Sept. 25 at Sun Devil Stadium in
Tempe, Ariz. Both schools had a bye
that Saturday of the season and both
desired to move their bye date back
to Oct. 9, the original date of the
game. The change in dates also
makes the game attractive for televi
sion purposes.
"When you look at the date and
the schedule within the Pac-10, this
game becomes an attractive choice
for ABC or FOX television," OSU
Director of Athletics Bob De Carolis

said. "This also benefits both pro
grams from a standpoint of pushing
the bye week back toward the middle
of the season."
The only other conference game
scheduled for Sept. 25 is USC at Stan
ford. The rest of the Pac-10 schedule
includes Washington at Notre Dame,
California at Southern Mississippi
and Idaho at Oregon.
Oregon State is tentatively set to
open the season Sept. 4 at Reser Sta
dium against the Temple Owls.
The rumor that the Beavers might
play a larger BCS opponent is still cir
culating, with national champion
LSU still a possibility.
In order for Oregon State to play a
new school for their 2004 season
opener, the Beavers will have to find
an opponent for Temple.
De Carolis told the Oregonian in
Tuesday's paper that he has given
himself a deadline of Jan. 31 to find
the Owls an opponent or continue
with the regularly scheduled game.
