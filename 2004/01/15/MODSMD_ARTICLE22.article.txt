# Marten ekes out win over Penguin
## 
### T.J. ECKLEBERG SENIOR ASSOCIATE MANAGING EDITOR OF NEWS/STAFF WRITER 
It was a dark day for The Daily penguin.
Excluded from the Editor In Chief election
ballot for the first time in memory, the hand
somely attired polar biped failed in his last-ditch
e-mail campaign to garner write-in votes.
Instead, Opinions Editor Brendan Marten, a
junior, will assume the paper's editorship on Feb.
1.
"You know, the stuffed penguin's perfor
mance in the grill session lacked a certain je ne
sais quoi," said Special Sections Managing Edi
tor Mark Dominik, "but I thought he would at
least force a runoff."
Many had thought that the penguin, with its
propensity to remain unflappable even while
being hurled across the room by Daily staffers,
would have been ideally suited to that essential
task. But Marten, too, often exudes an arctic cool
as he strides silently through the office, nodding
uncertainly to everyone he passes.
"I can be stoic," Marten insisted as he casual
ly shot a penguin-jumper from behind the arc of
beer cans and Associated Press Style Guides.
"Real stoic," he added meaningfully.
Marten has already laid out a plan for his first
and only â€”lOO days in office.
"The Donald Duck poster is coming down,"
he pledged. "Looks too much like a damned pen
guin."
Well after the post-election hubbub had sub
sided, senior and longtime Daily editor Vauhini
Vara pranced into the office, her polka-dotted
pajamas complementing her slightly tipsy smile.
"Hey guys, when's that election going on?"
she demanded cheerily.
"You look like you just stepped off the set of
an Outkast video," typesetter extraordinaire
Amanda Canevaro said.
"Touche," Vara exclaimed through a mouth
ful of tequila.
Among the hallmarks of Marten's platform is
his commitment to increase the number of edi
tors to quadruple digits, a level of democracy un
precedented in the paper's annals.
"I thought your... platform was absolutely
throbbing with brilliant ideas," cooed opinions
editor Anna Galan, blatantly angling for the cov
eted Head Copy Editor position.
Many will now scramble for a position at the
paper in the fall.
"I'm a good leader," said Eric Eldon, a senior.
"I'm good with staff development and stuff."
"I can't wait to watch his staff develop," de
clared Senior Staff Writer Erin Archerd.

was not at last nighTs festivities because Marten ignored his pleas to adopt the Callahan 2-editor system.
