## UCLA students underutilize professor's office hours 
### JENNIFER CASE DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) UCLA Chemistry professor Her
bert Kaesz works diligently in his office, planning as
signments and lectures. He looks up occasionally and
glances toward the doorway of his office, but then
quickly returns to his work.
Kaesz is not simply spending extra time working in
his quiet office. These are his office hours. But, there
are usually no students for him to advise.
"The traffic of students during office hours typical
ly increases as we approach an exam, but other times,
we're the loneliest guys around," Kaesz said.
At the start of a new quarter, many professors are
finding that their offices are empty during their sched
uled office hours, and this comes as no surprise.
Many aspects of attending a large university such as
UCLA can make the educational experience an imper
sonal one. Along with large class sizes, UCLA's mini
mum progress requirement which was implemented
in fall 2001 requires students to take a full load of
classes each quarter.
Additionally, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's bud

get proposal released Friday calls for an increase in the
student-faculty ratio at the University of California by
5 percent.
One solution to what can often seem like the imper
sonal feel of UCLA are the office hours professors are
required to hold. Yet many students do not take ad
vantage of the opportunity for a more personal rela
tionship with their professors.
"A lot of times students choose not to come in. In
the first couple of weeks there is very little traffic, and
students are falling behind. When they start to panic,
they come in," Kaesz said.
Many students believe the best time to visit a pro
fessor during office hours is right before a big exam.
"I typically go three to four times in a quarter, and it
is generally for help on a paper," said Payshun Hamm,
a fifth-year African American studies student.
Professors are required by their departments to
hold a certain number of office hours, and they en
courage students to come and ask questions.
"Sometimes very few to no students attend my of
fice hours, and that is why I don't like to be in a remote
room. I prefer to be in my office doing my own work in
the instance that no students show up," Kaesz said.

Many professors who teach large classes believe stu
dents should come to office hours to build a personal
relationship with them. They say it is nearly impossible
to know all of their students unless they come to office
hours.
"I encourage undergraduate students in my class to
come in and make themselves known. I find that they
do better, and we can get to know each other in case
they want me to write them a letter of recommenda
tion," said history professor Claudia Rapp. "It's a good
way to establish a good rapport, and those students
have an advantage."
Some students said this personal connection with
their professors was why they chose to use office hours.
"There have been a couple of professors that I have
had a connection with and wanted to get to know bet
ter, so I see them on a regular basis during their office
hours," said third-year history student Courtney
Quinn.
Some departments provide alternatives to office
hours so students who may be unable to attend during
the regularly scheduled times can still talk to their pro
fessors.
The chemistry department has implemented a pro

gram called virtual office hours, where students can
communicate with their professors via e-mail. An ad
vantage to this program is the fact that students en
rolled in the course can see the questions and answers
of other students.
"We've been using the VOH program for about five
years, and it's really excellent. Sometimes it eliminates
students asking the same questions, which is helpful to
me," Kaesz said.
Fifth-year math student Huy Tran said virtual help
from his professors is a good solution, but only for cer
tain problems that can be answered with one answer.
"Sometimes I e-mail for math homework help. But,
usually, if I have a conceptual problem, I go to the of
fice hours because it requires a conversation," Tran
said.
Professors often believe that some of their office
hours are a waste of a valuable resource for their stu
dents.
"I really think office hours are very important, and
they are a great resource for students. (Students)
should take advantage of them as much as possible, and
especially as early in the quarter as possible," Rapp
said.

the instance that no students show up," Kaesz said.

Many professors who teach large classes believe stu
dents should come to office hours to build a personal
relationship with them. They say it is nearly impossible
to know all of their students unless they come to office
hours.
"I encourage undergraduate students in my class to
come in and make themselves known. I find that they
do better, and we can get to know each other in case
they want me to write them a letter of recommenda
tion," said history professor Claudia Rapp. "It's a good
way to establish a good rapport, and those students
have an advantage."
Some students said this personal connection with
their professors was why they chose to use office hours.
"There have been a couple of professors that I have
had a connection with and wanted to get to know bet
ter, so I see them on a regular basis during their office
hours," said third-year history student Courtney
Quinn.
Some departments provide alternatives to office
hours so students who may be unable to attend during
the regularly scheduled times can still talk to their pro
fessors.
The chemistry department has implemented a pro

gram called virtual office hours, where students can
communicate with their professors via e-mail. An ad
vantage to this program is the fact that students en
rolled in the course can see the questions and answers
of other students.
"We've been using the VOH program for about five
years, and it's really excellent. Sometimes it eliminates
students asking the same questions, which is helpful to
me," Kaesz said.
Fifth-year math student Huy Tran said virtual help
from his professors is a good solution, but only for cer
tain problems that can be answered with one answer.
"Sometimes I e-mail for math homework help. But,
usually, if I have a conceptual problem, I go to the of
fice hours because it requires a conversation," Tran
said.
Professors often believe that some of their office
hours are a waste of a valuable resource for their stu
dents.
"I really think office hours are very important, and
they are a great resource for students. (Students)
should take advantage of them as much as possible, and
especially as early in the quarter as possible," Rapp
said.
