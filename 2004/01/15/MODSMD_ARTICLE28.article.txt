# Univ. of Oregon puts focus on Office of Multicultural Affairs
## 
### CHELSEA DUNCAN OREGON DAILY EMERALD 
(U-WIRE) Even after the University of Oregon admin
istration filled its newly created position of vice provost for in
stitutional equity and diversity, students of color on campus re
main concerned the campus is short of resources that support
their needs. Sophomore Khanh Le said the prime example is the
Office of Multicultural Affairs associate director position,
which has remained unfilled since the former associate director
left in July.
Le said the university is cutting resources that support students
and faculty of color as diversity increases on campus.
"Diversity's increasing, but they're cutting funding of re
sources that support diversity," he said.
The Office of Multicultural Affairs isn't just a resource for stu
dents of color, but also a resource for people of all backgrounds,
Le added.
Associated Students of UO co-multicultural advocate Mark
Padoongpatt said the office is important for retaining students
and faculty of color, who he said seem to be going through a "re
volving door."
"The only reason we seem to be hiring professors of coloris be
cause professors of color keep leaving," he said.
Padoongpatt said the university still struggles with retaining
students of color who decide to transfer, and many current stu
dents often consider transferring to a more supportive environ
ment. He said a full staff at the department is therefore important.
Office of Multicultural Affairs Director Carla D. Gary agreed
that the associate director position is important to students as well
as to the office.
"That's a position that's vital for running the office," she said,
adding that her position is more administrative, and the associate

position provides more of an advising role for students.
Gary said she understands why students are concerned that
this position is not being filled, especially since the funding is
available.
"The students are concerned, and understandably, that this
appears to be contrary to the notion that we support diversity,"
she said.
The administration chose not to immediately fill the position
and allow the new vice provost to aid in the construction of lead
ership roles for diversity issues.
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies Karen Sprague said
the position of associate director was originally created to assist
with the daily operations of the office. The director position is a
part-time post that also includes part-time work as the university
advocate.
Now that the associate director is gone, however, Sprague said
the office's director will be able to work in that position full time.
"It seems to me that the new vice provost would be able to pick
up that advocacy work," she said.
Sprague added that this allows for the new vice provost to have
some flexibility as he takes on his new role.
"To me, this is a very good situation for him to enter," she said,
adding that once the new vice provost is established, he may de
cide the associate director position is necessary after all.
But Le said the administration isn't showing a commitment to
adding positions that support diversity when "they cut one and
hire another."
Padoongpatt said students of color want to feel included by
being connected with others who understand their backgrounds
and by being part of the decision-making process of diversity is
sues.
"We just need our support system as well as every other stu
dent needs their support system," he said.
