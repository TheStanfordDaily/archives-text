# Penn able to keep stable credit rating
## 
### BROOKE DALEY DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN 
(U-WIRE) In contrast to the na
tional trend of declining credit ratings and
increasing debt facing private colleges due
to the poor economy, Penn's credit ratings
have remained stable while showing a de
cline in debt. This trend has triggered in
creases in expenses and decreases in pri
vate gifts across the country.
As expenses rise, universities are fur
ther competing for students because tu
ition payments provide the majority of rev
enue for most private institutions. As re
ported by the Chronicle of Higher Educa
tion, most private schools are dependent
on tuition for at least 70 to 80 percent of
total revenue.
Penn has managed to avoid the issue of
tuition dependence, because only a third of
the University's revenue, exclusive of the

Health System, comes from tuition and
fees, according to Senior Vice President for
Finance and Treasurer Craig Carnaroli.
With Congress in talks over establishing
price controls in response to rising tuition
costs, Penn's high percentage of revenue
independent of tuition would help main
tain the University's fiscal stability in the
face of such caps.
The University has also bucked the na
tional trend of rising debt that faces many
private institutions across the country by
retiring about $5O million in debt this past
year, according to Carnaroli.
In 2002, Penn was reviewed by rating
agencies that issue credit ratings on a par
ticular series of bonds, and had its outlook
revised from negative to stable, with the
change being attributed to the Health Sys
tem.
The Health System has recently re
gained stable financial footing under the

leadership of CEO Ralph Muller.
Carnaroli attributes Penn's stable cred
it ratings and decline in debt to the Univer
sity's generous and consistent donation
base.
"While many peer institutions have
faced a weakness in giving because of the
weak economy, we have actually had the
opposite trend. People are still very loyal
and generous in giving to Penn and it
makes a big difference," he said.
In addition, the University has shown
itself to be fairly independent of changes
in the economy. "We did a study about
two years ago measuring the sensitivity
of the University to recession, and very
few of our revenues correlated well with
changes in" gross domestic product,
Carnaroli said. "However, we have seen
some pressure on expenses and a greater
demand for financial aid because of the
weaker economy."
