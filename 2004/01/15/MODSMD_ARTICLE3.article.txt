# Accident on campus
## 
### 
A bicyclist was sent to the
Stanford Hospital emergency
room last night after colliding
with a car at the corner of Lomita
and Mayfield Avenue. Police re
ceived the call at 9:45 p.m. that
the accident had occurred.
Police said they believe that
both the male bicyclist and driver
of the vehicle are Stanford stu
dents.
"The residence dean will be
notified about the event," said
Sgt. Hilary Karp of the Stanford
Police Department. "The high
way patrol will be doing an inves

tigation of this event as well."
Police do not yet know if this
accident involved alcohol or
whether criminal charges will be
filed in this case.
"It's a possibility," Karp said.
"But there is a difference be
tween being at fault and being
criminally at fault."
All injury accidents that occur
on the Stanford campus are in
vestigated by the highway patrol
because it falls under their juris
diction as private property in an
unincorporated county.
