# Dartmouth to track fraternity rush to evaluate Greek life
## 
### KEVIN GARLAND THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) When rush starts Monday, the Dart
mouth Interfraternity Council for the first time will
track patterns concerning the number of men going to
certain houses.
The final sink numbers will be viewed as well, and
in the future, compared on an annual basis.
"The reason for tracking these numbers is so that
the IFC can have an idea of the relative popularity of
certain houses, and thereby determine which houses
are shrinking or growing on campus," Dartmouth IFC
Vice President Dave Hodapp, a senior, said.
Rush numbers will help provide a look at the whole
fraternity system, Hodapp said.
The IFC will see if more or less people are rushing
from year to year, and the relative health of the sys
tem.
Still, IFC President Jonathan Lazarow 'O5 was
quick to note that "less people doesn't necessarily
mean less popularity."
Besides the availability of statistics, rush will remain
roughly the same this year. No structural changes will

take place, and no changes in policies are underway.
"We're trying for continuity, it's easier that way,"
Lazarow said. "It's a very easy and painless process."
The rush process runs from Monday to Thursday
next week. Somewhat different from sorority rush, few
rules exist for the week. There is little governance over
the rushees, apart from alcohol being prohibited and a
time schedule, according to Hodapp.
However, Hodapp stressed that the alcohol policy
is strictly enforced.
The first three days of rush will consist of open
houses at the different fraternities from 6 to 9 p.m.
Each house will offer a different setting, Lazarow said.
"It's a really laid-back process, each house has dif
ferent kinds of food and that doesn't necessarily rep
resent the quality of the house," Lazarow said.
Like sororities, some fraternities have had to adjust
how rush is run since it was moved to Winter term after
heated debate between the administration and Greek
leaders.
"It's been really troublesome because so many ju
niors are off in the winter," Hodapp said, "You have a
large contingent of kids in the spring that don't know
the pledges from the winter."
