# Gov. might propose grad tuition hikes
## 
### ADAMFOXMAN DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) In a move that a high
level University of California at Los An
geles official said could be an "absolute,
total disaster for graduate education,"
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger might pro
pose a substantial increase in graduate
student fees for the University of Califor
nia system.
Although Schwarzenegger has proposed
a 10 percent per year cap for undergraduate
fee increases, the Los Angeles Times re
ported Thursday that his budget could in
clude a fee hike of up to 40 percent for grad
uate students at the UC and California State
University systems.
Reactions from graduate students
ranged from anxiety to disappointment and
indignation.
"I agreed to pay a certain amount to
come here in 2002, and nothing has changed
since to make my education worth almost
twice its original price," said Ben Weston, a
second-year law student.
Others, like Marilyn Gray, vice president
for academics of the Graduate Student As
sociation, expressed feelings of confusion
and anxiety.
"Overall fellowship money will go
down," Gray said.
"Everyone is panicking and struggling
not to lose ground," she said.
Marc Lewis, a graduating UCLA law stu
dent, said increased fees could contribute to
a decrease in access as well as narrowed job
opportunities for law students.
"If you start saddling people with a lot of
debt you can handicap what people can do
with their degree," Lewis said, adding that
increased debt could force more people to
choose higher-paying jobs instead of public
service.
The UC's graduate and professional
schools were hit hard by last year's UC-wide
cuts, and some graduate students and ad
ministrators are concerned that a further
round of cuts and fee increases could be se
verely detrimental to the UC's ability to
compete for the best graduate students.
Jim Turner, assistant vice chancellor for
UCLA's graduate division, said the level of
support the UC provides its graduate stu
dents is not adequate to compete with other
top research institutions, and an increase in
fees for graduate and out-of-state students

could cause a rapid decline in the UC's qual
ity and academic reputation.
Graduate student services have already
been cut because of a lack of funding, and
UCLA has been forced to do more with less.
"You start looking at the number of staff,
and the number of graduate students, and
we suck," Turner said.
An institution's reputation is based, in
large part, on recruiting high-caliber gradu
ate students. Good faculty want to work
with good graduate students, so being beat
out for the most qualified graduate students
could cause a university to lose respected
professors.
And some worry the UC may already be
losing that competition.
"We are already finding that we are hav
ing a harder time competing for the best stu
dents," said Bill Roy, UCLA graduate
council chairman and a professor of sociolo
gy-
Roy said graduate education is more de
pendent on funding than undergraduate ed
ucation because most graduate students get
financial support for both fees and living ex
penses from their institutions.
According to a survey conducted by the
UC Office of the President, UCLA doctoral
students reported being offered an average
of $2,500 more in stipends by non-UC com
petitors. The difference is closer to $4,500
when adjusted for the cost of living near
UCLA.
In addition, 60 percent of UCLA doctor
al students are guaranteed long-term sup
port, but competing institutions like the
universities of Michigan and Wisconsin
offer long-term support to an average of 85
percent of applicants.
Budget cuts and increased fees could also
decrease access to the UC's graduate and
professional schools.
The Law Fellows Program, for example,
which has helped increase the number of
underrepresented minorities attending
UCLA Law School by 136 percent since
1999, could be in limbo for funding.
"It is difficult to constantly adjust to a
funding schedule and an economic situation
that seems to be so volatile," said Leo Tru
jillo-Cox, director for the Institute of Out
reach and a professor at the UCLA School
of Law.
"The law school is hurting for diversity as
it is," Lewis said, "so anything that would
harm diversity is negative."
