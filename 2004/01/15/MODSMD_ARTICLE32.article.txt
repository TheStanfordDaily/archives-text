# Faculty brats thrive at Dartmouth

### FRANCES CHA THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) For many students, college is an opportuni
ty to get as far away from their parents as possible. But for a sur
prising number of Dartmouth College students, parents aren't
a continent or even a state away. Rather, they're stationed in
their offices in Dartmouth Row, Sanborn House or Wilder
Hall. An average of four to six children of faculty members
apply to Dartmouth every year, according to the Admissions
Office.
But faculty children are given no institutional advantage in
the admissions process, according to Dean of Admissions Karl
Furstenberg. Their applications go through the same admis
sions process as all applicants from anywhere in the country, he
said.
However, "as they know Dartmouth and its academic ex
pectations well, the pool of faculty children is usually a well
qualified group," Furstenberg said.
Most of these students hail from Hanover Ffigh School and
have virtually grown up on the Green, but many said that de
ciding to apply to Dartmouth was not so obvious a choice as
one might think.
"My parents really didn't influence me in my decision to
come to Dartmouth," Sarah Ayres said.
Her father, Matthew Ayres, is a professor in the Biology de
partment. Ayres said that she came to Dartmouth for the same
reasons that everyone else chooses to come here —because of
its rigorous academic program.
Of her college experience thus far, Ayres thinks that she's

having a similar experience as if she were to go to a different
school. In fact, she said she actually spends less time at home
than do some of her friends.
"I know people who live in Connecticut and Massachusetts
who go home much more often than I do," Ayres said. "I think
it's the thought that I could go home whenever I want," she
added, laughing.
Professor Ayres said that it was fun to occasionally bump
into his daughter at school, but he agreed that it was not much
different from having her go somewhere else for school. He
also added that his daughter's experience has provided more
perspective on what it is like to be a Dartmouth student and has
helped him improve as an advisor and professor.
Lauren Lotko, Ayres's roommate this term, is also the
daughter of Dartmouth faculty members. Her mother is in the
Physics Department, and her father teaches at the Engineering
School. Lotko agreed with Ayers in the sentiment that her par
ents did not influence her choice to attend the College.
"My decision was completely independent from my par
ents," she said.
For one of the newest additions to the Dartmouth commu
nity, Jacob Crumbine, that decision was not a foregone con
clusion. When his final choices for college came down to Dart
mouth and Columbia, Crumbine said that his mother, a Dart
mouth English professor, helped him by remaining objective
and weighing the pros and cons of both schools.
Crumbine's mother, Nancy Crumbine, is teaching English
5 this year, so she has had several of her son's classmates as stu
dents. "It's weird to overhear students talking about her,"
Crumbine said, "but, so far, the reviews have all been good."
