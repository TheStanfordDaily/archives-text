# Stanford in Government announces new requirements for 2004 fellowships
## Opportunities include work in South Korea, Indonesia, and Brazil 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This summer's Stanford in Government pro
gram will put a stronger emphasis on faculty-stu
dent partnerships and public service, the group re
vealed last night when it announced its 29 place
ments for this summer's fellowship program.
This year's Fellowship Night provided
prospective applicants with insight into their fel
lowships through the personal accounts of three
student speakers, who spoke about their diverse
experiences. Some of the opportunities involved
diplomatic relations, traveling and living
abroad, research and contact with high-level
public officials such as state assembly members.
New fellowship opportunities include working
in South Korea, Brazil and even Indonesia.
"After hearing about all of the fellowship op
portunities and the inspiring comments made by
the guest speakers, I definitely feel motivated to
apply," said junior Adam Phail-Liff.
The presentation underscored new stipula
tions for fellowship members, which include a
signed Statement of Academic Commitment.
This agreement requires the student to keep in
contact with a faculty member during their up
coming spring and autumn quarters. By doing
so, Stanford in Government aspires to aid fel
lows in applying their summer fellowship expe
riences into future academic work.
"Ultimately, we hope this faculty-student in
teraction will open the doors to discourse both
before and after fellowship members' sum
mers," said Nina Bilimoria, chair of the organi
zation.
Through fellowships, Stanford in Govern
ment hopes to provide students with an oppor
tunity to gain experience with matters of gov
ernment, public policy and research in a select
ed field. Students who participate in the pro
gram assume several important duties and inter

act with a broad group of organizations on the
state, local and international level.
"The program offers students an experience
that is broader and more challenging than a typ
ical summer internship," said Vice Chair of Fel
lowships Alexander Rosas, a senior.
Last year, more than 170 incoming sopho
mores, juniors and seniors applied for a fellow
ship. This year, that number is expected to in
crease.
"We feel this year's attractive fellowship op
portunities will draw a broader range of appli

cants from different majors and backgrounds,"
Bilimoria said.
Students who are interested in the program
must submit a resume, letter of recommenda
tion, transcript and a 750-word personal state
ment about their reasons for applying. Soon
thereafter, a committee will select five appli
cants for each position. These finalists are then
interviewed and one is selected for position con
sideration. The host office, where a final deci
sion is made, then evaluates the remaining stu
dent's application.
