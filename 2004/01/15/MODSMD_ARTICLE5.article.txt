# Court ruling will help protect users' identities from record companies
## 
### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
A new federal court ruling has diminished the ability of
the recording industry to obtain the names of those who il
legally share music online, making it more difficult to pros
ecute students who share files illegally.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit made a unanimous deci
sion in a case filed by Verizon Communications Inc. along
with colleges from which the Recording Industry Associa
tion of America had sought names. This decision could cur
tail the number of subpoenas that colleges have received in
which the RIAA demands the names of students it sus

pects of swapping music over the Internet.
It is uncertain whether the RIAA will find new ways to
hold colleges themselves accountable for their students'
copyright infringement or whether the ruling will affect
students who continue sharing files despite the recording
industry's warnings and university requests.
The court found that a special provision of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act on which the industry group
had been relying did not apply in cases in which the copy
righted material is stored on computers that are beyond the
service provider's reach.
The provision "does not authorize the issuance of a
subpoena to an ISP acting as a mere conduit for the trans
mission of information sent by others," the judges said, rul

ing that the provision applies only to a service provider
"engaged in storing on its servers material that is infring
ing."
RIAA subpoenas have mostly been served to colleges
where campus computer networks have been used for the
exchange of music files stored on computers owned by stu
dents. The subpoenas allow quick access to the names of
thousands of suspected file sharers, including college stu
dents. Without this information, the RIAA would only
have the Internet addresses of their computers. Once the
individuals' names have been obtained, people can be sued
for copyright infringement.
Since September, 382 people have been sued, but it is
unclear how many are college students. Most of the col

leges that have received subpoenas from the RIAA have
complied with them.
Richard Holeton, the head of Residential Computing,
confirmed that the RIAA and other copyright owners have
no way of obtaining a student's personal information with
out subpoenaing the University.
"They can't [discover a student's identity}," Holeton
said, "because the [lnternet Service Provider] is the one
who knows what IP address goes with what person."
According to the ResComp Web site, once the Univer
sity receives a complaint, it issues a warning to the student
demanding that he remove the illegal
file cited in the complaint. If a student
fails to respond within 24 hours, his
Internet connection is terminated
until he complies.
"If we receive a valid subpoena,
we will generally comply with that
subpoena," said Debra Zumwalt,
Stanford's general counsel. "If there
was a defect in the subpoena or it is
overboard, then we would try to
work it out or, if necessary, chal
lenge the improper aspects of the
subpoena."
The decision translates into more
time and energy costs for groups who

are seeking copyright violators'
names because they can only obtain
them through conventional legal pro
cedures. The now-defunct fast-track
process required signatures of feder
al-court clerks, not federal judges,
who might subject the requests to
greater scrutiny.
But Sheldon E. Steinbach, vice
president and general counsel of the
American Council on Education,
cautions colleges or students from
thinking that the appeals-court ruling
will keep the music industry from
prosecuting infringers.
"It seems patently clear to me,"
he said, "that the recording industry
needs to try to keep the issue alive in
order to reverse the societal as
sumption that downloading is free
and legal."
