### ELIZABETH MADJLESSI DESK EDITOR 
A new federal court ruling has diminished the ability of
the recording industry to obtain the names of those who il
legally share music online, making it more difficult to pros
ecute students who share files illegally.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit made a unanimous deci
sion in a case filed by Verizon Communications Inc. along
with colleges from which the Recording Industry Associa
tion of America had sought names. This decision could cur
tail the number of subpoenas that colleges have received in
which the RIAA demands the names of students it sus

pects of swapping music over the Internet.
It is uncertain whether the RIAA will find new ways to
hold colleges themselves accountable for their students'
copyright infringement or whether the ruling will affect
students who continue sharing files despite the recording
industry's warnings and university requests.
The court found that a special provision of the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act on which the industry group
had been relying did not apply in cases in which the copy
righted material is stored on computers that are beyond the
service provider's reach.
The provision "does not authorize the issuance of a
subpoena to an ISP acting as a mere conduit for the trans
mission of information sent by others," the judges said, rul

ing that the provision applies only to a service provider
"engaged in storing on its servers material that is infring
ing."
RIAA subpoenas have mostly been served to colleges
where campus computer networks have been used for the
exchange of music files stored on computers owned by stu
dents. The subpoenas allow quick access to the names of
thousands of suspected file sharers, including college stu
dents. Without this information, the RIAA would only
have the Internet addresses of their computers. Once the
individuals' names have been obtained, people can be sued
for copyright infringement.
Since September, 382 people have been sued, but it is
unclear how many are college students. Most of the col

leges that have received subpoenas from the RIAA have
complied with them.
Richard Holeton, the head of Residential Computing,
confirmed that the RIAA and other copyright owners have
no way of obtaining a student's personal information with
out subpoenaing the University.
"They can't [discover a student's identity}," Holeton
said, "because the [lnternet Service Provider] is the one
who knows what IP address goes with what person."
According to the ResComp Web site, once the Univer
sity receives a complaint, it issues a warning to the student
