## Vinni encourages guilt-free sex â€” and lots of it 
### 
What's better than an or
gasm? Millions of years
of evolution dictates
nothing can be, and
modern society seems to agree. From
chocolate cake (better than sex choco
late cake) to alcohol (screaming or-

gasm shots), we
compare everything
to sex because sex is
simply the best, sim
ply the most plea
surable action we
know how to do.
But if sex is so great,
why do we still
lower our voices
when we talk about
it, and for the

love of God why aren't we all hav
ing more of it?
Sex is on TV and in movies, plas
tered across billboards and buses, in
serted into our every nook and cranny
(pun very much intended); sex is ev
erywhere except where it should be the
most: our bedrooms. While I know
some of us are having more sex than
Hugh Heffner in his heyday, many
more of us are having less sex than Bob
Dole before Viagra. The 50s are over
and while our economy capitalizes on
sex by using it as the ultimate market
ing tool, our society sits on its fat ass
watching more sex than having it. It
kills me.
I propose a sexual revolution; any
one interested? Despite the efforts of
our compatriots in the 60s, sex never
quite lost its puritanical feel. We never
quite got over the old world idea that
sex is something dirty, something that
one should feel guilty about and prac
tice only in necessity. The ideas of the
past still have us by the balls, seen
today in the promotion of abstinence,
the fact that people still feel guilty mas
turbating and the lunacy that is South
ern sex education, an oxymoron if ever
one existed.
We need to stop feeling guilty about
having lots and lots of sex because
there's absolutely no reason to feel
negative about such a positive activity.
The excuse of the past was that sex was
a sin, to be committed only for the pur
pose of procreation. Most of us are
over that idea, accepting sex as a nor
mal biological process and a fun one at
that. We need to ditch the remaining
negative bullshit we attach to sex and
realize that treated correctly there is no
downside to sex. Sex is pure. Sex is pro
found.
Now, before you strip naked and
jump on the person sitting next to you,
let me remind you that the 60s are over.
Even if such a thing as "free love" ex
ists or could exist, our world, filled with
STDs and rapists, is not suited to it. Be
sides the fact that sleeping with ran
dom people you don't know is a sure
fire way to get yourself killed, people
are social beings who desire relation
ships as much as they do sex. I propose
the next sexual revolution be founded
not on the idea of free sex, but on the
concept of responsible sex and lots
of it.
Other than knowledge and experi
ence, the only thing that makes sex
even better as the best feeling felt on
earth is a deep relationship with the
person you're having sex with. There
are two major components to sex: the
physical and the emotional. The physi
cal component, what our bodies feel, is
evolutionarily hardwired into us and
we could be bucking with the ugliest
bastard in the world and still feel all the
same physical sensations as we would
with hottie Ryan Philippe (I don't
mean it baby, I love you) or Paris
Hilton (I'm convinced she'd snap).
What makes the difference between
billion-dollar sex and sex that was just
a bit better than what you could have
done yourself is the emotional compo
nent of sex, what our soul feels. It's
within this component that passion is
found, the element that takes what
would normally be humdrum sex and
turns it into the stuff dreams are made
of. You can only tap into the emotion
al component of sex if you know the
other person on an emotional level.
The deeper your knowledge of this
component, the more passionate you
can be and the better the sex you will
have, promise. Not to mention, the
more comfortable you are with a per
son the more willing you will be to try
new kinds of sex that feel even better.
So have more relationships, more
sex, more fun. Then read my column.

our compatriots in the 60s, sex never
quite lost its puritanical feel. We never
quite got over the old world idea that
sex is something dirty, something that
one should feel guilty about and prac
tice only in necessity. The ideas of the
past still have us by the balls, seen
today in the promotion of abstinence,
the fact that people still feel guilty mas
turbating and the lunacy that is South
ern sex education, an oxymoron if ever
one existed.
We need to stop feeling guilty about
having lots and lots of sex because
there's absolutely no reason to feel
negative about such a positive activity.
The excuse of the past was that sex was
a sin, to be committed only for the pur
pose of procreation. Most of us are
over that idea, accepting sex as a nor
mal biological process and a fun one at
that. We need to ditch the remaining
negative bullshit we attach to sex and
realize that treated correctly there is no
downside to sex. Sex is pure. Sex is pro
found.
Now, before you strip naked and
jump on the person sitting next to you,
let me remind you that the 60s are over.
Even if such a thing as "free love" ex
ists or could exist, our world, filled with
STDs and rapists, is not suited to it. Be
sides the fact that sleeping with ran
dom people you don't know is a sure
fire way to get yourself killed, people
are social beings who desire relation
ships as much as they do sex. I propose
the next sexual revolution be founded
not on the idea of free sex, but on the
concept of responsible sex and lots
of it.
Other than knowledge and experi
ence, the only thing that makes sex
even better as the best feeling felt on
earth is a deep relationship with the
person you're having sex with. There
are two major components to sex: the
physical and the emotional. The physi
cal component, what our bodies feel, is
evolutionarily hardwired into us and
we could be bucking with the ugliest
bastard in the world and still feel all the
same physical sensations as we would
with hottie Ryan Philippe (I don't
mean it baby, I love you) or Paris
Hilton (I'm convinced she'd snap).
What makes the difference between
billion-dollar sex and sex that was just
a bit better than what you could have
done yourself is the emotional compo
nent of sex, what our soul feels. It's
within this component that passion is
found, the element that takes what
would normally be humdrum sex and
turns it into the stuff dreams are made
of. You can only tap into the emotion
al component of sex if you know the
other person on an emotional level.
The deeper your knowledge of this
component, the more passionate you
can be and the better the sex you will
have, promise. Not to mention, the
more comfortable you are with a per
son the more willing you will be to try
new kinds of sex that feel even better.
So have more relationships, more
sex, more fun. Then read my column.
