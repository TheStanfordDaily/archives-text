# Moo Drive Me Crazy

### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
Last week my Statistics professor put up
a problem on the board about "downer
cows" animals who are too sick to make
it to the slaughterhouse on their own but still
wind up on our dinner plates. The Holstein
cow found with bovine spongiform en
cephalopathy last month happened to be a
downer cow.
And so I started thinking about mad cow
disease as I filled in numbers on the bivari
ate frequency distribution: are Stanford stu
dents all that concerned about eating infect
ed beef? It appears as though not everybody
at the Farm is swearing off the burgers.
Stanford Dining and chefs at row houses
are going out of their way to ensure student
safety. Michael Ryan, the chef at Narnia
House, explained how he'd switched gears
after learning about the possible risk of
BSE.
"I'm making a conscious effort to serve
less beef," he said. "As a precaution, I'm
avoiding things like T-bone steak that come
from areas close to the cow's backbone."
Narnia beef-eaters will be happy to know
that Ryan is taking the quality up a notch.
"In addition to avoiding meat close to the
spinal cord, I'm also buying more expensive
beef like Black Angus," he said. "It's better
quality and I'm hoping that it's safer as
well."
Ryan explained that he is thinking about
putting out a questionnaire asking students
how concerned they are, though he hasn't
noticed a decline in beef consumption or
a lot of complaints, for that matter. He
seemed happy with the student response to
beef night.
"See, people didn't seem to have a prob
lem with the beef," he said, gesturing at a
nearly empty platter. He proceeded to pick
up to pick up a piece of meat, slice it in half
on the cutting board and pop it into his
mouth.
And from what I can tell, he's right: Stu
dents don't appear to be shying away from
the Big Macs and fillet mignon.
Sophomore Mike Medrano said that the
BSE scare wasn't affecting him.
"I really don't care about the whole
thing," he said. "The only concern I have is
that there was a shipment of American beef
sent out to Guam and I have family out
there. But I'm not worried about mad cow
disease. I'll probably eat more beef now be
cause it's cheaper."
I talked to senior Noah Cates after a beef
and cous-cous dinner and he didn't seem too
bothered by the cow crisis either.
"Now that you mentioned mad cow dis
ease I just realized that I was eating beef,"
Cates said. "I don't think about it at all. I
read some statistic that you're more likely to
get struck by lightening [than eat contami
nated beef]."
Jaime Poskin, a beef-eating sophomore,
speculated that people care more about
their low-carb diets than about the risks of
eating contaminated meat.
"I just don't think the price of beef will go
down dramatically because of the Atkins
Diet," he said.
Senior Onny Chatterjee was a little more
cautious at least for a little while.
"I didn't think mad cow disease was a big
deal until the Bush Administration an
nounced that it wasn't," Chatterjee said.
He explained how he temporarily
stopped eating beef.
"But the food at my dining hall was so
bad that I gave in and ate a hamburger kind
of without realizing it," he said. "I figure
something's going to kill me eventually and
it would probably healthier to stop smoking
than to stop eating beef."
