COMMONLY ASKEP QUESTIONS
bout reducing , reusing, recycling, buying recycled, and composting
} Is the cap of a recyclable plastic bottle also recyclable?
Q Is the cap of a recyclable plastic bottle also recyclable?
A nope. The cap is made of a different type of plastic than the bottle,usually #3-#7, which aren't recy
cled yet. When plastic bottles are processed for recycling, caps and lids must be separated and trashed.
Overall recycling costs would be reduced if consumers removed the caps before recycling. Remove plas
tic caps, rinse, and flatten the bottle before recycling.
Q Why can't pizza boxes be recycled?
A The cardboard becomes soiled with grease, cheese, and other foods once the pizza has been placed in
the box. Once soiled, the paper cannot be recycled because the paper fibers will not be able to be sepa
rated from the oils during the pulping process.
Q What should I do with slightly used
paper plates, napkins, or cups?
A Although these items are paper, they should
be placed in the garbage. Often times these
items are soiled with food, which is a contami
nant. Many paper products have a thin plastic
lining to give strength to the product and to pre
vent leaking. This plastic lining is a contaminant
in the pulping process. Please throw paper
plates, napkins, and cups in the garbage.
Q What do / do with broken lightbulbs or
drinking glasses?
A They should be wrapped in paper (to protect the
garbage collector) and placed in the garbage. Glass bot
tles and jars (beverage and food containers) are the
only types of glass accepted in Stanford's recycling pro
gram. Frosted glass, drinking glasses, vases, plate
glass, pyrex, mirrors, and ceramics should not be
placed in your recycling bin.
