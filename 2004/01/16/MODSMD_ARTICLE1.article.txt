# No. 3 Cardinal to face Cal
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Last year, an unranked Stanford team
dropped its Pacific-10 Conference opener
to the California Golden Bears. It hurt like
any loss to Cal, but it was the fourth of nine
losses the squad would suffer and the squad
put it behind them and moved forward
quickly.
Tomorrow, though, there is a lot more
on the line when Cal comes to town the
No. 3 Cardinal is the Pac-10's only unde
feated team and the clear frontrunner to
win the conference. Fortunately, this year's
Golden Bears squad (6-7, 2-2 Pac-10) is a
shadow of last year's veteran unit, but that
would just magnify a slip-up by the Cardi
nal (13-0,4-0).
Stanford has won 11 of its last 13 con
tests against Cal, though, and 10 straight at
Maples Pavilion. And with every game now
on the national radar, the Cardinal is not
about to take the Bears lightly. And, of

course, Mike Montgomery is not about to
heighten expectations or tensions for the
Cardinal.
"Rivalry is, I mean I hate to say this, but
it's more of a football thing," Montgomery
said. "You play them once a year and
you've got all that buildup and hype. In
basketball, with Thursday-Saturday games,
two games a year [against a Pac-10 oppo
nent] and all that stuff, it just doesn't get to
the same level— but I'm happy that it
doesn't."
Regardless of the rivalry question, Stan
ford will be playing a very different Cal
team than the one that went to the NCAA
Tournament last March.
A pair of Bay Area freshman forwards
now leads Cal: 6-foot-8 phenom Leon Powe
of Oakland and explosive 6-foot-5 Mar
quise Kately of San Francisco. Powe aver
ages a team-leading 15.7 points and 9.5 re
bounds per game and may not be at Cal for
long if he heeds the NBA's siren song.
Kately led Cal in scoring last week, totaling

35 points in the Bears' loss to No. 7 Arizona
and win over Arizona State.
Powe has been frustrated lately with the
double-teams he's been encountering, but
it has created more of a scoring role for
Kately, who started the year on the bench.
"I told him, 'You are doing great things
for us,"' Cal coach Ben Braun said. "I don't
know a lot of freshmen that get the kind of
attention he does. He can't get frustrated if
he gets 20 one night and not as many the
next."
How Powe fares against Stanford's
tough man-to-man defense will have a lot to
do with how Cal fares tomorrow.
"Powe is really good," Montgomery
said. "He's caused a lot of problems for
people."
Israeli senior Amit Tamir is the lone
holdover from last year's nucleus. He's
struggled this year, hitting just 41 percent
from the field and 34 percent from down
town for 10.8 points per game. He pulls
down 5.4 boards per game and will pull the

Cardinal big men out of the paint with his
perimeter-oriented play. He launches over
four three-point shots per game.
If Cal is to spring an upset, it will start
with its talented big men.
While Stanford has a solid perimeter
game, Tamir is the only consistent threat
from downtown for Cal, which also hap
pens to be an undersized squad. Tamir, a
forward by trade, starts out of position at
center, and the Bears' starters do not have a
height advantage over the Cardinal at any
position.
Mike Montgomery's Stanford squad
may try to pound the ball inside to 6-foot-9
Justin Davis, a Berkeley native, and 6-foot
-10 Rob Little in hopes of wearing out Cal's
big men or getting them in foul trouble.
Davis averages 11.5 points and 7.5 boards
and Little 10.5 points and 5.8 rebounds de
spite both playing relatively limited min
utes. Junior Nick Robinson will add his

pressure defense to the frontcourt mix for
the Cardinal and could prove important in
disrupting Cal's offense.
Junior forward Josh Childress, still com
ing back from a stress reaction, will prove
difficult for Cal to defend. In four games
coming off the bench, he's averaged 11.8
points and 6.2 rebounds in just 19.8 minutes
per game astonishing productivity, espe
cially when you consider that he's hit just 2-
of-10 three-pointers so far.
"He was a major factor in our success
over the weekend," Montgomery said of
the Cardinal's wins over Arizona State and
No. 7 Arizona. "In terms of the things he's
able to do, he's probably close to what he's
able to do [when healthy]."
As if the size advantage wasn't enough,
though, the Cardinal backcourt has a big
edge on Cal as well. Chris Hernandez, the
prototypical Montgomery point guard, has
been nailing 55 percent of his three-point
ers and 94 percent of his free throws. His
10.6 points and 5.5 assists per game dwarf
the 7.0 and 3.8 posted by Cal freshman
point guard Ayinde Übaka, who shoots just
34 percent from the field and 26 percent
from downtown.
At shooting guard, Cal starts last year's
point guard, Richard Midgley, a 6-foot-2
Englishman. Midgley shot 44 percent from
downtown last year but, like Tamir, has
struggled this year, connecting on only 29
percent of his threes and 37 percent overall.
He averages just 7.7 points and 1.9 assists.
His performance last year, though, suggests
he won't stay cold for too much longer.
Midgley go up against senior shooting
guard Matt Lottich, who leads Stanford in
scoring with 13.9 points per game and is sec
ond in assists with 4.2 per contest.
Off the bench, Cal has a great number of
possible contributors, but no consistent
standouts. Coach Ben Braun has already
found a way to use 16 different players this
year, and the highest-scoring reserve, for
ward Dominic McGuire, averages only 5.2
points. Montgomery will counter with Chil
dress who, until he re-enters the starting
lineup, will remain the Pac-10's most pro
ductive reserve.
"Starting is not really an issue," Mont
gomery said. "He's one of the best players
in the conference."
While Stanford works to maintain its
perfect consistency play a game, win a
game Cal has been battling youthful ups
and downs, and Braun is not sure exactly
what his team will be able to do against
Stanford.
"We are still in the learning stages," he
said. "I keep reminding our staff and our
players that this is not an overnight fix."
Gametime is 8 p.m. tomorrow. The
game will be broadcast on Fox Sports Net,
KNEW 910 AM and, as always, KZSU 90.1
FM.

ages a team-leading 15.7 points and 9.5 re
bounds per game and may not be at Cal for
long if he heeds the NBA's siren song.
Kately led Cal in scoring last week, totaling

35 points in the Bears' loss to No. 7 Arizona
and win over Arizona State.
Powe has been frustrated lately with the
double-teams he's been encountering, but
it has created more of a scoring role for
Kately, who started the year on the bench.
"I told him, 'You are doing great things
for us,"' Cal coach Ben Braun said. "I don't
know a lot of freshmen that get the kind of
attention he does. He can't get frustrated if
he gets 20 one night and not as many the
next."
How Powe fares against Stanford's
tough man-to-man defense will have a lot to
do with how Cal fares tomorrow.
"Powe is really good," Montgomery
said. "He's caused a lot of problems for
people."
Israeli senior Amit Tamir is the lone
holdover from last year's nucleus. He's
struggled this year, hitting just 41 percent
from the field and 34 percent from down
town for 10.8 points per game. He pulls
down 5.4 boards per game and will pull the

Cardinal big men out of the paint with his
perimeter-oriented play. He launches over
four three-point shots per game.
If Cal is to spring an upset, it will start
with its talented big men.
While Stanford has a solid perimeter
game, Tamir is the only consistent threat
from downtown for Cal, which also hap
pens to be an undersized squad. Tamir, a
forward by trade, starts out of position at
center, and the Bears' starters do not have a
height advantage over the Cardinal at any
position.
Mike Montgomery's Stanford squad
may try to pound the ball inside to 6-foot-9
Justin Davis, a Berkeley native, and 6-foot
-10 Rob Little in hopes of wearing out Cal's
big men or getting them in foul trouble.
Davis averages 11.5 points and 7.5 boards
and Little 10.5 points and 5.8 rebounds de

utes. Junior Nick Robinson will add his

pressure defense to the frontcourt mix for
the Cardinal and could prove important in
disrupting Cal's offense.
Junior forward Josh Childress, still com
ing back from a stress reaction, will prove
difficult for Cal to defend. In four games
coming off the bench, he's averaged 11.8
points and 6.2 rebounds in just 19.8 minutes
per game astonishing productivity, espe
cially when you consider that he's hit just 2-
of-10 three-pointers so far.
"He was a major factor in our success
over the weekend," Montgomery said of
the Cardinal's wins over Arizona State and
No. 7 Arizona. "In terms of the things he's
able to do, he's probably close to what he's
able to do [when healthy]."
As if the size advantage wasn't enough,
though, the Cardinal backcourt has a big
edge on Cal as well. Chris Hernandez, the
prototypical Montgomery point guard, has
been nailing 55 percent of his three-point
ers and 94 percent of his free throws. His
10.6 points and 5.5 assists per game dwarf
the 7.0 and 3.8 posted by Cal freshman
point guard Ayinde Übaka, who shoots just
34 percent from the field and 26 percent
from downtown.
At shooting guard, Cal starts last year's
point guard, Richard Midgley, a 6-foot-2
Englishman. Midgley shot 44 percent from
downtown last year but, like Tamir, has
struggled this year, connecting on only 29
percent of his threes and 37 percent overall.
He averages just 7.7 points and 1.9 assists.
His performance last year, though, suggests
he won't stay cold for too much longer.
Midgley go up against senior shooting
guard Matt Lottich, who leads Stanford in
scoring with 13.9 points per game and is sec
ond in assists with 4.2 per contest.
Off the bench, Cal has a great number of
possible contributors, but no consistent
standouts. Coach Ben Braun has already
found a way to use 16 different players this
year, and the highest-scoring reserve, for
ward Dominic McGuire, averages only 5.2
points. Montgomery will counter with Chil
dress who, until he re-enters the starting
lineup, will remain the Pac-10's most pro
ductive reserve.
"Starting is not really an issue," Mont
gomery said. "He's one of the best players
in the conference."
While Stanford works to maintain its
perfect consistency play a game, win a
game Cal has been battling youthful ups
and downs, and Braun is not sure exactly
what his team will be able to do against
Stanford.
"We are still in the learning stages," he
said. "I keep reminding our staff and our
players that this is not an overnight fix."

Senior shooting guard Matt Lottich will try to
replicate his 6-of-8 shooting performance in
Tucson, Ariz.
Last year, an unranked Stanford team
dropped its Pacific-10 Conference opener
to the California Golden Bears. It hurt like
any loss to Cal, but it was the fourth of nine
losses the squad would suffer and the squad
put it behind them and moved forward
quickly.
Tomorrow, though, there is a lot more
on the line when Cal comes to town the
No. 3 Cardinal is the Pac-10's only unde
feated team and the clear frontrunner to
win the conference. Fortunately, this year's
Golden Bears squad (6-7, 2-2 Pac-10) is a
shadow of last year's veteran unit, but that
would just magnify a slip-up by the Cardi
nal (13-0,4-0).
Stanford has won 11 of its last 13 con
tests against Cal, though, and 10 straight at
Maples Pavilion. And with every game now
on the national radar, the Cardinal is not
about to take the Bears lightly. And, of

course, Mike Montgomery is not about to
heighten expectations or tensions for the
Cardinal.
"Rivalry is, I mean I hate to say this, but
it's more of a football thing," Montgomery
said. "You play them once a year and
you've got all that buildup and hype. In
basketball, with Thursday-Saturday games,
two games a year [against a Pac-10 oppo
nent] and all that stuff, it just doesn't get to
the same level— but I'm happy that it
doesn't."
Regardless of the rivalry question, Stan
ford will be playing a very different Cal
team than the one that went to the NCAA
Tournament last March.
A pair of Bay Area freshman forwards
now leads Cal: 6-foot-8 phenom Leon Powe
of Oakland and explosive 6-foot-5 Mar
quise Kately of San Francisco. Powe aver
