### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In March, a new Stanford hos
pital facility, the new Center for
Cancer Treatment and Preven
tion/Ambulatory Care Pavilion,
will open for patient care.
The much-anticipated build
ing, which has plans that date
back to the mid-1990'5, seeks to
improve the quality of patient
and outpatient treatment by of
fering an advanced, yet homey,
atmosphere.
According to Charlotte Ja
cobs, professor of medicine and
director of Stanford's Clinical
Cancer Center, in terms of tech
nology and "state-of-the-art fa
cilities," the four-story, $162 mil
lion building will reflect dramatic
advances in cancer treatment.
In addition to housing sophis
ticated new equipment such as
linear accelerators that will deliv
er radiation therapy and the only
PET/CT simulator on the west
coast, the new facility will offer a
radiation therapy suite, a mam
mography and diagnostic radiol
ogy unit, 80 exam rooms, more
than 50 chemotherapy stations,
social and nutritional services,
and a clinical research suite.
The Ambulatory Care Pavil
ion, which is on the top floor of
the new facility, adds space that
will nearly triple the space now
dedicated to outpatient surgery;
it will include 16 operating
rooms, the hospital's endoscopic
surgery center, the sports medi
cine surgery suite, the ophthal

mology program and temporary
outpatient pediatric surgery ser
vices for Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital.
Altogether, the new facility to
tals 218,000 square feet, substan
tially expanding Stanford's space
to treat cancer patients; John
Gaston, project manager for the
center, notes that currently just
80,000 square feet at Stanford
Hospital is dedicated to cancer
treatment.
In terms of improving the hos
pital atmosphere, the new facility
boasts of bright corridors and
exam rooms, where the Clinical
Cancer Center says patients and
their families will be able to find
a positive and healing environ
ment. The building's interior de
sign will be full of color and detail
and will include specially selected
artwork. Indoor fountains and
gardens will also be part of the fa
cility, in the hope of providing "a
serene environment where pa
tients and families can gather."
"Given the stress of cancer
therapy, the new Stanford facility
will seek to provide care in a hu
manistic, caring and sensitive en
vironment," said Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine
and a pediatric cancer specialist.
Another major component of
the new facility is that it will en
able members of Stanford's clini
cal faculty to work cooperatively,
which the Clinical Cancer Center
claims is crucial to pursuing new
medical knowledge and designing
