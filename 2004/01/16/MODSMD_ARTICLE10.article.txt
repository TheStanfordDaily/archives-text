# Stanford to open new cancer center
## 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In March, a new Stanford hos
pital facility, the new Center for
Cancer Treatment and Preven
tion/Ambulatory Care Pavilion,
will open for patient care.
The much-anticipated build
ing, which has plans that date
back to the mid-1990'5, seeks to
improve the quality of patient
and outpatient treatment by of
fering an advanced, yet homey,
atmosphere.
According to Charlotte Ja
cobs, professor of medicine and
director of Stanford's Clinical
Cancer Center, in terms of tech
nology and "state-of-the-art fa
cilities," the four-story, $162 mil
lion building will reflect dramatic
advances in cancer treatment.
In addition to housing sophis
ticated new equipment such as
linear accelerators that will deliv
er radiation therapy and the only
PET/CT simulator on the west
coast, the new facility will offer a
radiation therapy suite, a mam
mography and diagnostic radiol
ogy unit, 80 exam rooms, more
than 50 chemotherapy stations,
social and nutritional services,
and a clinical research suite.
The Ambulatory Care Pavil
ion, which is on the top floor of
the new facility, adds space that
will nearly triple the space now
dedicated to outpatient surgery;
it will include 16 operating
rooms, the hospital's endoscopic
surgery center, the sports medi
cine surgery suite, the ophthal

mology program and temporary
outpatient pediatric surgery ser
vices for Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital.
Altogether, the new facility to
tals 218,000 square feet, substan
tially expanding Stanford's space
to treat cancer patients; John
Gaston, project manager for the
center, notes that currently just
80,000 square feet at Stanford
Hospital is dedicated to cancer
treatment.
In terms of improving the hos
pital atmosphere, the new facility
boasts of bright corridors and
exam rooms, where the Clinical
Cancer Center says patients and
their families will be able to find
a positive and healing environ
ment. The building's interior de
sign will be full of color and detail
and will include specially selected
artwork. Indoor fountains and
gardens will also be part of the fa
cility, in the hope of providing "a
serene environment where pa
tients and families can gather."
"Given the stress of cancer
therapy, the new Stanford facility
will seek to provide care in a hu
manistic, caring and sensitive en
vironment," said Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine
and a pediatric cancer specialist.
Another major component of
the new facility is that it will en
able members of Stanford's clini
cal faculty to work cooperatively,
which the Clinical Cancer Center
claims is crucial to pursuing new
medical knowledge and designing
well-coordinated treatment
plans.
"It will bring physicians to
gether from various specialties so
that their expertise can be
brought to bear on optimizing the
treatment plan for each patient,"
Pizzo said.
The Clinical Cancer Center
points out that Stanford specialists
pioneered this "multidisciplinary
approach" to cancer care, in which
a team of experts, including sur
geons, radiation oncologists,
pathologists and others, work to
gether to diagnose, treat and sup
port individual patients. The Clin
ical Cancer Center adds that this
new building embodies that ap
proach.
"The building is a reflection of
our multidisciplinary approach to
cancer," Jacobs said. "It will inte
grate research into the clinic
more effectively to quicken our
pace with new therapeutic ap
proaches, and it's a reflection of
our care and concern for patients,
allowing them to get most of their
care under one roof in a support
ive environment."
The Clinical Cancer Center
claims that having all physicians
and services in one location will
help patients avoid the inconve
nience of traveling from one spot
to another for tests and clinic vis
its.
"The center will provide 'one
stop shopping' for the patient
with cancer," said Richard
Hoppe, interim medical director
of the Clinical Cancer Center.
"Previously, cancer care services
were spread throughout the med
ical center and patients had to
walk long distances from one ser

vice point to another. Everything
will now be conveniently located
in one building."
Though the new facility be
longs to the hospital, not the
School of Medicine, Pizzo be
lieves that the facility will be very
helpful for the Medical School
and its oncology program.
"One of the major areas of em
phasis for the school is cancer re
search," Pizzo said. "We have re
cently formed the Stanford Insti
tute for Cancer/Stem Cell Biolo
gy and Medicine that unites the
school and Stanford Hospital and
Clinics. We are also in the midst
of applying to become an NCl
designated Comprehensive Can
cer Center. The new Clinical
Cancer Center will provide a fa
cility that helps Stanford Medi
cine achieve its goal of being a
leading center in cancer treat
ment and prevention."
The new facility is located on
Blake Wilbur Drive, adjacent to
Stanford Hospital and Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
