# Editor warns of 'Judeophobia' in media
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
A new revival of anti-Semitism needs to be
suppressed, said associate editor for the
Jerusalem Report Stuart Schoffman in a speech
at the Tresidder Oak Room called "The Resur
gence of Global Anti-Semitism."
Schoffman began his speech by relaying per
sonal anecdotes and noting that several maga
zines over the past year and half have been pub
lishing articles and stories about the rise in anti-
Semitism.
"You know global anti-Semitism is back in
fashion when it makes the cover of Vanity Fair,"
he said.
Schoffman said his particular discussion
would be focused on Judeophobia since the
word 'Semite' may potentially refers to a broad
er category of middle-easterners. Schoffman be
lieves the new wave of Judeophobia is grounded
on technological opportunity. He gave the ex
ample of how hard it was to find an anti-Semitic
pamphlet published by Henry Ford when he was
younger and how it is now possible to search on
Google for a slew of Judeophobic literature.

"Schoffman articulated grave problems for
anti-Semitism, a lot of which people didn't real
ize like the Henry Ford pamphlets," said se
nior Michael Butler. "It is definitely something
that Americans should be aware of."
Schoffman noted that Jews have historically
been seen as guests in other people's countries
and have never fully assimilated because of their
different cultural and religious practices.
Though this "peculiarity" among other national
ities is part of the reason for xenophobia, the
ability to retain Jewish traditions has maintained
Judaism's survival, he argued.
"The antidote for anti-Semitism has become
the reason for it," Schoffman said. "Israel has
become the Jew among the nations."
Schoffman referred to Israel's much-debated
legitimacy as both the cause and solution to
Judeophobia. He said that while anti-Semitism
was suppressed after the Holocaust, the taboo of
aversion toward Jews was lifted with the intifa
da.
"I think [Schoffman] was very even-handed
and showed the need for co-existence and coop
eration between the Israelis and Palestinians,"
said Adele Lieberman, a resident of Menlo Park.

"He was really saying that anti-Semitism is there
no matter what happens, and that's very disturb
ing to me as an American Jew. He also spoke as
an Israeli, which was more credible to me [since]
he has his family there."
Though Schoffman claimed that provocative
acts like suicide terrorism have elicited "over-re
actions" on the part of the Israeli government,
he argued that a democratic Jewish state is nec
essary. Schoffman also emphasized the common
mistake of conflating anti-Zionism and anti-
Semitism, and labeled himself as a Zionist yet a
sympathizer of Palestinians.
"Arafat ruined it for his people and my peo
ple," he said, articulating a growing need for co
operation.
Schoffman offered two challenges to push
anti-Semitism into remission. First, he urged
people to use intelligence not to give fuel to anti-
Semitism. The second was a democratic pre
scription to lead the way in showing patience and
tolerance.
Schoffman emphasized his hope for a subsid
ing of Judeophobia, though he described anti-
Semitism as "a disease that can never be cured
but, hopefully, will be treated."
