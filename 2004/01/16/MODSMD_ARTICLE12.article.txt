# Students gear up for election '04
## 
### CYNTHIA CHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For once, the Stanford College Republicans
and Stanford Democrats have something in
common.
As the democratic candidates for president
gear up for this year's election, starting with
Monday's much-anticipated lowa caucus,
members of Stanford's political organizations
are working to achieve the same goal: to get out
the vote.
Over the next few weeks, the Stanford Col
lege Republicans and Stanford Democrats will
be canvassing White Plaza to register students
to vote in an effort to mobilize a group that
many see as the new swing voters.
' Last week, the Stanford College Republi
cans formed Stanford Students for Bush, a
group "dedicated to ensuring President Bush's
re-election through garnering the support of
college students," said junior Joe Fairbanks,
president of the Stanford College Republicans.
While the group has yet to finalize the details of
its plans for the coming months, the organiza
tion's agenda includes holding voter registra
tion drives and community forums about elec
tion issues.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Democrats began
its voter registration drive on Tuesday. The
goal, according to the group's president, junior
Dylan Mefford, is to register 1,000 new voters
by the California primary on March 2.
Young people: The new swing voters
Why the fuss about the student vote?
In a Dec. 29 op-ed in The New York Times,
Chuck Todd, editor in chief of the political
newsletter The Hotline, wrote that in any elec
tion "swing voters remain the most coveted,
and most influential, demographic in American
politics." For the 2004 elections, many political
strategists and academics, including Todd, pre
dict that young people will be the swing vote.
Even the Democratic presidential candi
dates know they cannot ignore young voters.
On Nov. 4 CNN and Rock the Vote, a nonprof
it, nonpartisan organization dedicated to en
gaging young people in the political process,
co-hosted a town hall meeting in which young
people were allowed to question the candi
dates. Among the candidates, Howard Dean
has been the most effective in gaining support
from young people, which has contributed
largely to the success of his campaign, as The
Daily reported in October.
Members of Stanford Students for Howard
Dean have been registering voters in White
Plaza twice a week since the beginning of fall
quarter. According to the group's tabling coor
dinator Conan Carey, a doctoral candidate in
Japanese literature, about five to eight people
approach the table each day. Some students
register to vote, and others even sign up on the
Dean campus list, which already has 160 peo
ple.
A survey of 1,202 college students nation
wide found that more than two-thirds were reg
istered to vote. The study was conducted by
Harvard University's Institute of Politics and
released last September.
The big question is whether those students
will do what they say they will do. Voters
younger than 30 account for a quarter of the
voting-age population. Yet in 2000, only 36 per
cent of people between the ages 18 of 29 voted,
compared to about 67 percent of people be
tween the ages of 65 and 74.

For students,
a calm before the storm?

Whether or not Stanford students will take a
greater interest in politics as the election sea
son kicks into full gear, with the lowa caucus on
Monday, is unclear.
According to senior Nina Bilimoria, chair of
Stanford in Government, a nonpartisan student
group that promotes political awareness and
involvement on campus, students who are not
involved in campus political groups such as the
Stanford College Republicans or the Stanford
Democrats tend not to attend political events,
including those sponsored by SIG.
"We are having trouble attracting new peo

pie to our events," she said, adding that she sees
the same group of people at most of the politi
cal events she attends.
But Bilimoria said she is hopeful that the
SIG Fellowship Program, through which Stan
ford undergraduates can gain government or
public policy work experience, will attract stu
dents who currently are not interested or in
volved in politics. She explained that she is
hoping for a "domino ripple effect": Students
first find out about SIG fellowships through
their academic interests, be it civil engineering
or the environment, but then they develop an
interest in politics and policy work.
About 200 students attended SlG's Fellow
ship Night on Wednesday.
"I would estimate that this number is slight
ly higher than last year, although Fellowship
Night has traditionally drawn good representa
tion from undergraduate students," said Vice
Chair of Fellowships Alexander Rosas, a se
nior.
Though Rosas would not conclude that the
increase in turnout is linked to the November
elections, he said that "it could be that an inter
est in the upcoming presidential election draws
more students to an interest in political issues.
Washington, D.C., will definitely be an inter
esting place to be this summer, and through our
campus awareness and fellowships programs,
SIG definitely hopes to offer meaningful per
spectives on the election events."
Meanwhile, the Stanford in Washington
program, which offers students the opportunity
to intern and study in the nation's capital,
hasn't noticed an unusual rise in interest from
students eager to spend election season in
Washington.
While the number of students who applied
for the spring term was higher than the other
two terms this academic year, it was not a
record, according to Adrienne Jamieson, the
program's director.
"As far as I can see, the upcoming election
did not have all that much to do with why stu
dents applied," she said. "For the most part, I
think people apply for a term that works for
them in their academic schedule."
However, Jamieson predicted that as the de
mocratic primaries progress, more students
could become interested in the Stanford in
Washington program.

"I suppose you could hypothesize that elec
tions heighten student interest in politics for a
while but I wonder if folks are deeply en
gaged at this point in the [election] cycle," she
said. "Once we get through lowa and New
Hampshire, this may change. I'll be curious
about the fall application cycle in this regard."
No endorsement for Democrats
The Stanford Democrats have pot endorsed
any of the eight democratic candidates: Gener
al Wesley Clark (Ret.), Governor Howard
Dean, Senator John Edwards, Congressman
Dick Gephardt, Senator John Kerry, Congress
man Dennis Kucinich, Senator Joe Lieberman
and Reverend A 1 Sharpton. Carol Moseley
Braun pulled out of the race yesterday and en
dorsed Dean.
"It is the policy of the Stanford Democrats
to not endorse candidates in the primaries,"
said junior Dylan Mefford, the group's presi
dent. "In line with democratic values, we seek
to be inclusive and welcome students regard
less of which candidate they support. Our role
is to create open forums in which to discuss the
various candidates and enable supporters to
explain their reasons for supporting their cho
sen candidate."
In the press release announcing the start of
the Stanford Democrats' voter registration
drive, Mefford claimed, "Young people across
America have been disillusioned by the poli
cies of the Bush administration, and have come
to see our government as unresponsive and un
caring." Mefford said that a Democrat in office
would "turn this country around."
Fairbanks disagreed.
"I think our members view this year's demo
cratic candidates as a particularly disappoint
ing group with little to offer," he said. "They all
have a very angry demeanor that turns a lot of
people off, and that's hurting them now and
will hurt the nominee against Bush. We think
that after all the name-calling, finger-pointing
and flip-flopping on major issues just to ap
pease the radical portion of the democratic
base, the only winner that will come out of the
primaries will be President Bush."
Fairbanks says that Stanford Students for
Bush is not only for Republicans.

Israeli journalist Stuart Schoffman spoke yesterday in Tresidder Union about
rising global anti-Semitism, especially in the media.
"We [Stanford College Repub

With the lowa caucus only a

Israeli journalist Stuart Schoffman spoke yesterday in Tresidder Union about
rising global anti-Semitism, especially in the media.
"We [Stanford College Repub
licans] are running the organiza
tion and were chosen by the State
GOP to run it, but we are not ex
clusively Republicans, as we are
seeking like-minded Democrats
and Independents," he said.
With the lowa caucus only a

seems to be in the clear lead. Even
Dean told CNN's Larry King, via
telephone, that the race is a "four
way tie" between himself,
Gephardt, Kerry and Edwards.
For once, the Stanford College Republicans
and Stanford Democrats have something in
common.
As the democratic candidates for president
gear up for this year's election, starting with
Monday's much-anticipated lowa caucus,
members of Stanford's political organizations
are working to achieve the same goal: to get out
the vote.
Over the next few weeks, the Stanford Col
lege Republicans and Stanford Democrats will
be canvassing White Plaza to register students
to vote in an effort to mobilize a group that
many see as the new swing voters.
' Last week, the Stanford College Republi
cans formed Stanford Students for Bush, a
group "dedicated to ensuring President Bush's
re-election through garnering the support of
college students," said junior Joe Fairbanks,
president of the Stanford College Republicans.
While the group has yet to finalize the details of
its plans for the coming months, the organiza
tion's agenda includes holding voter registra
tion drives and community forums about elec
tion issues.
Meanwhile, the Stanford Democrats began
its voter registration drive on Tuesday. The
goal, according to the group's president, junior
Dylan Mefford, is to register 1,000 new voters
by the California primary on March 2.
Young people: The new swing voters
Why the fuss about the student vote?
In a Dec. 29 op-ed in The New York Times,
Chuck Todd, editor in chief of the political
newsletter The Hotline, wrote that in any elec
tion "swing voters remain the most coveted,
and most influential, demographic in American
politics." For the 2004 elections, many political
strategists and academics, including Todd, pre
dict that young people will be the swing vote.
Even the Democratic presidential candi
dates know they cannot ignore young voters.
On Nov. 4 CNN and Rock the Vote, a nonprof
it, nonpartisan organization dedicated to en
gaging young people in the political process,
co-hosted a town hall meeting in which young
people were allowed to question the candi
dates. Among the candidates, Howard Dean
has been the most effective in gaining support
from young people, which has contributed
largely to the success of his campaign, as The
Daily reported in October.
Members of Stanford Students for Howard
Dean have been registering voters in White
Plaza twice a week since the beginning of fall
quarter. According to the group's tabling coor
dinator Conan Carey, a doctoral candidate in
Japanese literature, about five to eight people
approach the table each day. Some students
register to vote, and others even sign up on the
Dean campus list, which already has 160 peo
ple.
A survey of 1,202 college students nation
wide found that more than two-thirds were reg
istered to vote. The study was conducted by
Harvard University's Institute of Politics and
released last September.
The big question is whether those students
will do what they say they will do. Voters
younger than 30 account for a quarter of the
voting-age population. Yet in 2000, only 36 per
cent of people between the ages 18 of 29 voted,
compared to about 67 percent of people be
tween the ages of 65 and 74.

For students,
a calm before the storm?

Whether or not Stanford students will take a
greater interest in politics as the election sea
son kicks into full gear, with the lowa caucus on
Monday, is unclear.
According to senior Nina Bilimoria, chair of
Stanford in Government, a nonpartisan student
group that promotes political awareness and
involvement on campus, students who are not
involved in campus political groups such as the
Stanford College Republicans or the Stanford
Democrats tend not to attend political events,
including those sponsored by SIG.
"We are having trouble attracting new peo

pie to our events," she said, adding that she sees
the same group of people at most of the politi
cal events she attends.
But Bilimoria said she is hopeful that the
SIG Fellowship Program, through which Stan
ford undergraduates can gain government or
public policy work experience, will attract stu
dents who currently are not interested or in
volved in politics. She explained that she is
hoping for a "domino ripple effect": Students
first find out about SIG fellowships through
their academic interests, be it civil engineering
or the environment, but then they develop an
interest in politics and policy work.
About 200 students attended SlG's Fellow
ship Night on Wednesday.
"I would estimate that this number is slight
ly higher than last year, although Fellowship
Night has traditionally drawn good representa
tion from undergraduate students," said Vice
Chair of Fellowships Alexander Rosas, a se
nior.
Though Rosas would not conclude that the
increase in turnout is linked to the November
elections, he said that "it could be that an inter
est in the upcoming presidential election draws
more students to an interest in political issues.
Washington, D.C., will definitely be an inter
esting place to be this summer, and through our
campus awareness and fellowships programs,
SIG definitely hopes to offer meaningful per
spectives on the election events."
Meanwhile, the Stanford in Washington
program, which offers students the opportunity
to intern and study in the nation's capital,
hasn't noticed an unusual rise in interest from
students eager to spend election season in
Washington.
While the number of students who applied
for the spring term was higher than the other
two terms this academic year, it was not a
record, according to Adrienne Jamieson, the
program's director.
"As far as I can see, the upcoming election
did not have all that much to do with why stu
dents applied," she said. "For the most part, I
think people apply for a term that works for
them in their academic schedule."
However, Jamieson predicted that as the de
mocratic primaries progress, more students
could become interested in the Stanford in
Washington program.

"I suppose you could hypothesize that elec
tions heighten student interest in politics for a
while but I wonder if folks are deeply en
gaged at this point in the [election] cycle," she
said. "Once we get through lowa and New
Hampshire, this may change. I'll be curious
about the fall application cycle in this regard."
No endorsement for Democrats
The Stanford Democrats have pot endorsed
any of the eight democratic candidates: Gener
al Wesley Clark (Ret.), Governor Howard
Dean, Senator John Edwards, Congressman
Dick Gephardt, Senator John Kerry, Congress
man Dennis Kucinich, Senator Joe Lieberman
and Reverend A 1 Sharpton. Carol Moseley
Braun pulled out of the race yesterday and en
dorsed Dean.
"It is the policy of the Stanford Democrats
to not endorse candidates in the primaries,"
said junior Dylan Mefford, the group's presi
dent. "In line with democratic values, we seek
to be inclusive and welcome students regard
less of which candidate they support. Our role
is to create open forums in which to discuss the
various candidates and enable supporters to
explain their reasons for supporting their cho

program, which offers students the opportunity
to intern and study in the nation's capital,
hasn't noticed an unusual rise in interest from
students eager to spend election season in
Washington.
While the number of students who applied
for the spring term was higher than the other
two terms this academic year, it was not a
record, according to Adrienne Jamieson, the
program's director.
"As far as I can see, the upcoming election
did not have all that much to do with why stu
dents applied," she said. "For the most part, I
think people apply for a term that works for
them in their academic schedule."
However, Jamieson predicted that as the de
mocratic primaries progress, more students
could become interested in the Stanford in
Washington program.

"I suppose you could hypothesize that elec
tions heighten student interest in politics for a
while but I wonder if folks are deeply en
gaged at this point in the [election] cycle," she
said. "Once we get through lowa and New
Hampshire, this may change. I'll be curious
about the fall application cycle in this regard."
No endorsement for Democrats
The Stanford Democrats have pot endorsed
any of the eight democratic candidates: Gener
al Wesley Clark (Ret.), Governor Howard
Dean, Senator John Edwards, Congressman
Dick Gephardt, Senator John Kerry, Congress
man Dennis Kucinich, Senator Joe Lieberman
and Reverend A 1 Sharpton. Carol Moseley
Braun pulled out of the race yesterday and en
dorsed Dean.
"It is the policy of the Stanford Democrats
to not endorse candidates in the primaries,"
said junior Dylan Mefford, the group's presi
dent. "In line with democratic values, we seek
to be inclusive and welcome students regard
less of which candidate they support. Our role
is to create open forums in which to discuss the
various candidates and enable supporters to
explain their reasons for supporting their cho
sen candidate."
In the press release announcing the start of
the Stanford Democrats' voter registration
drive, Mefford claimed, "Young people across
America have been disillusioned by the poli
cies of the Bush administration, and have come
to see our government as unresponsive and un
caring." Mefford said that a Democrat in office
would "turn this country around."
Fairbanks disagreed.
"I think our members view this year's demo
cratic candidates as a particularly disappoint
ing group with little to offer," he said. "They all
have a very angry demeanor that turns a lot of
people off, and that's hurting them now and
will hurt the nominee against Bush. We think
that after all the name-calling, finger-pointing
and flip-flopping on major issues just to ap
pease the radical portion of the democratic
base, the only winner that will come out of the
primaries will be President Bush."
Fairbanks says that Stanford Students for
Bush is not only for Republicans.

Israeli journalist Stuart Schoffman spoke yesterday in Tresidder Union about
rising global anti-Semitism, especially in the media.
"We [Stanford College Repub
licans] are running the organiza
tion and were chosen by the State
GOP to run it, but we are not ex
clusively Republicans, as we are
seeking like-minded Democrats
and Independents," he said.
With the lowa caucus only a
weekend away, no one candidate
seems to be in the clear lead. Even
Dean told CNN's Larry King, via
telephone, that the race is a "four
way tie" between himself,
Gephardt, Kerry and Edwards.
