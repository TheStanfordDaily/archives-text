## Mars mission has us seeing red 
### 
Man has not set foot on the moon for over
three decades, and he has never set foot
on Mars. However, thanks to a new
space exploration initiative that was
announced on Wednesday by President George W.
Bush, humans may have an opportunity to return to
the moon in as little as a decade. Moreover, they
may even set foot on Mars by 2030. This is an ambi
tious proposal that certainly will provide the Na-

Times, it is speculated that President Bush may
suggest a NASA budget increase of about a billion
dollars over the next five years alone. This is not in
cluding increases that would be sure to follow in
future years. The cost of a Moon landing would be
about $5O billion, and it is uncertain how much a
mission to Mars would ring up at the cash register
although it was estimated back in 1989 when the
first President Bush suggested a Mars expedition

tional Aeronautics and
Space Administration
with a clear direction
for its program efforts
in future years.
However, we believe
that this is not necessar
ily money well spent.
While a mission to the
moon and to Mars may
yield many benefits in
terms of technological
developments and ad
vancements in our un
derstanding of the phys
ical world, these do not
outweigh the significant
costs that such space ef
forts would impose on
the American public.
Last week, we ex

that the outing would
require some $4OO bil
lion in funding.
Needless to
say, a trip to Mars is no
Sunday drive in terms
of the financial burden
that it would pose upon
the federal budget.
And in an era of record
deficits and an ongoing
military effort in Iraq,
this is not the time to*
commit ourselves to an
other costly venture,
especially one with few
clear or immediate ad
vantages. As Bush cuts
spending for domestic
programs, we have to
wonder where his pri-

pressed our approval of the progress of the Mars
rover project that is currently underway on the
Red Planet. However, it is important to remember
that the cost of the Mars rover project would be
dwarfed by a set of moon and Mars missions, if en
acted as outlined earlier this week. The two identi
cal Mars rovers "Opportunity" and "Spirit"
only cost $B2O million to produce and launch. On
the other hand, according to The New York

orities lie.
President Bush likely wants to ensure that his
presidency is a memorable one, and he may be
lieve that a mission to Mars is just the thing to
achieve that. However, there are many more im
portant concerns on the homefront that need to be
addressed. We ask, where could be a better place
to start building a presidential legacy than right
here on planet Earth?
