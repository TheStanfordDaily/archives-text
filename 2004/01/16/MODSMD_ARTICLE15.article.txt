## OP-ED Chirac shouldn't seek headscarf ban 
### MAHA AMIN EZZEDDENE 
In a French public high school, stu
dents can come to class wrapped in J.
Lo designer tops and jeans, with ear
rings in their tongues. Their T-shirts
can express their adoration of Nike,
Michael Jackson, world peace or pop
idol. Paint your face blue, white and
red before the national team plays:
That's probably OK too. Self-expres
sion is a part of growing up in France.
Unless you believe in God.
Last month, claiming to live up to
the country's strict allegiance to secu
larism, President Jacques Chirac called
for a ban of the Muslim headscarf, the
Jewish skullcap, large crosses or any
"ostentatious" display of religious
faith. Much of the debate in the last
month has centered on the right of
Muslim girls to cover their hair at
school, an act of modesty required by
their religion. According to Chirac, the
Muslim headscarf is "an act of aggres
sion" against secularism.
"The Islamic veil whatever
name we give it the kippa and a
cross that is of plainly excessive dimen
sions: These have no place in the
precincts of state schools," said Chirac
on Dec. 17. "Secularism is one of the
great conquests of the republic... We
cannot let it weaken."

Alma and Lila Levy, 16- and 18-
year-old sisters, were ordered to stay
out of their school in Paris until they
took off their scarves. According to the
BBC, school authorities told the girls
that their clothes were "ostentatious"

and unsuitable for sports. The girls' fa
ther, a Jewish lawyer, told the BBC,
"Saying to them that just because they
practice the religion of their ancestors
they are doing something ugly is a sure
fire way of causing an explosion."
Like Alma and Lila, many young
French women have already decided
what choice they will make when au
thorities ask them to leave school
grounds. Forced to choose between
pursuing their education and religious
observance, a crowd of 6,000 demon
strating women in France recently in
sisted they would not remove the head
scarf. More than just a religious sym
bol, the headscarf safeguards the puri
ty and self-respect highly valued by
Muslim women. The scarf functions in
two worlds; an act of devotion to God
and a practical manner of ensuring re
spect and protection outside of the
home, at school and in the workplace.
While some French politicians predict
that banning the headscarf will actually
liberate Muslim women ignorant of
their own subjugation, it is ironic that a
government that led the French revo
lution will force young women to con
form to a particular model of liberation
or else lose access to public education.
In forcing schoolchildren to con
form to a specific interpretation of sec
ularism, France becomes no better
than many third-world countries that
ignore human rights and force behav
ior on entire populations. The Euro
pean Convention on Human Rights
guarantees the right to manifest and
express personal faith, as long as it does

not infringe upon the rights of others.
Indeed, several human rights organiza
tions have joined synagogues, churches
and mosques in protesting the pro
posed law.
Since when do human rights viola
tions make news? Why worry about
France when women in Afghanistan
are uneducated, citizens of Saudi
Arabia can't express their thoughts
and black South Africans can't find
land to live on? Of all of these
tragedies, France is the only country
that perpetrates human rights viola
tions claiming to be a bastion of free
dom that respects all beliefs and
whose anthem declares: "Oh liberty
can man resign thee, Once having felt
thy generous flame?"
Freedom is neither written in stone
in a vault in the U.S. capital nor is it an
ornament hung in the walls of the U.N.
General Assembly. Freedom is creat
ed indeed, defended through
the vigor of civil society, especially
when she is falsely invoked to hide the
illiberal policies of militaries, dictators
and states. Alarmed by the French gov
ernment's encroachment upon her cit
izen's freedoms, human rights organi
zations are calling for an international
day of protest in front of French em
bassies tomorrow.
The French once led a revolution
founded on the ideals of liberty, equal
ity and fraternity. Today, they have a
reputation to restore.
