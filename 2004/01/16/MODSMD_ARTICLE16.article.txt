## Superintendents need to set sights lower 
### PAUL T. HILL 
In many cities, the job of school su
perintendent offers all the satisfactions
of the town spear catcher. Able people
often leave the job pierced in soul if not
in body. Cities such as Seattle and Port
land can get qualified men and women
to apply for the job but can't keep ap
plicants interested long enough to hire
anyone.
A few hardy souls, such as Boston's
Tom Payzant and San Diego's Alan
Bersin, hang in there. But most super
intendents either quit in frustration or
are fired when school boards that can't
settle on anything else agree that the su
perintendent is no good.
Superintendents are not all equally
well prepared or skillful, but the prob
lem is more with the job than with the
people. School superintendents are ex
pected to keep everyone happy, even
such groups as parents of gifted and dis
advantaged children who are in a zero
sum competition for money. They are
supposed to maintain a warm, fuzzy re
lationship with teachers whose unions
are constantly undercutting reform ef
forts and grabbing any new money that
becomes available for salaries and
smaller class sizes. They are supposed

to get results out of a district central of
fice, many of whose staff members are
tenured lifers or have their own power
bases in local churches, neighborhoods
and political clubs.
Superintendents are ultimately
fired or driven to distraction by school
boards, which do a wonderful job of
representing all the conflicts and confu
sions that exist in their communities.
It's hard to see how school boards as
constituted can do anything else: They
too face fractured communities and in
compatible demands. But unlike the
superintendent, they have somebody
on whom they can take out their frus
trations.
Education insiders keep searching
for a mutant strain of individuals who
can succeed under these circumstances.
But the real problem is with the jobs
themselves, both of superintendent
and of school board member.
These jobs are setups. Superinten
dents and school board members are ex
pected to take responsibility for things
that they can't influence because state
and federal regulations and collective
bargaining agreements stand in the way.
The scope of the superintendents' nomi
nal powers hiring all the teachers,
spending all the money, choosing all the

books, managing all the buses is so
great that every kind of conflict or
grievance comes straight to them.
The key to making superintendent
and school board jobs doable is to re
fine the excessive powers and duties to
the few that matter, such as focusing on
charter schools rather than hiring
teachers, holding schools accountable
for children's learning instead of deal
ing with grievances, sending dollars to
the schools that parents choose in place
of fiddling with centrally administered
budgets, withdrawing support from
schools that do not teach effectively,
developing new schools to replace
failed ones and letting parents choose
among schools rather than trying to
make the best of a bad family-school
match. â€¢
Superintendents and school boards
can trade in grandiose roles for simpler
but more consequential ones and catch
a lot fewer spears in the bargain.
