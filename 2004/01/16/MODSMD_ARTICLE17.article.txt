Students for a Sustainable Stanford
not 'opposed' to Law School dorm

The Daily's characterization of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
as "opposed" to the Law School
dorm project is not accurate ("Bil
lionaire Munger to fund new dorm,"
Jan. 14).
Our concern is that the Law
School dorm project appears to be
moving forward outside of the nor
mal Stanford project delivery pro
cess and that the University may ig
nore the energy efficiency and sus
tainability goals outlined in the
Guidelines for Sustainable Build
ings. In bypassing the process, the
University and the donor run the
risk of leaving the campus with an
inefficient building designed with
out the input of the greater Stanford
community.
The Law School dorm should go
through the University planning
process and follow the Guidelines
for Sustainable Building, as must
every other building project on this
campus.
While an energy-efficient build
ing may involve higher upfront costs,
the lifecycle costs of such a building
can be significantly lower. In fact,
careful investment in building an en
ergy efficient dorm will result in a
substantially higher rate of return
than investment returns from the en

dowment. The relative returns are
even more attractive when compared
with investments of comparable risk.
Operations and maintenance
costs are the hardest dollars to raise.
The donor would leave strong lega
cy if the dorm generated continual
financial benefits to the school in
the form of low annual energy and
maintenance costs.
We would like to see the Law
School dorm become a green build
ing and a flagship example of Stan
ford's early adoption of principles
that are both cost effective and envi
ronmentally friendly. Stanford
should be a leader in sustainable
and energy efficient building.

Story on BART misrepresents
public transportation

Nicole Wright's column ("Eat
my shorts, BART," Jan. 14) offers a
hyperbolic and inaccurate picture of
public transit in the Bay Area, un
fairly portraying it as a disturbing
"freak show" loaded with misan
thropic oddballs. Caltrain and
BART riders are on the balance
medium-income professionals, not
the groin-rubbing misfits that
Wright describes. According to Cal

train, 68 percent of its riders have
college degrees, and nearly half of
these have post-graduate degrees.
One in five Caltrain passengers has
a household income of $lOO,OOO to
$149,999 per year. While these are
not quite the demographics of the
express train from Grand Central to
Greenwich, it is a myth that Califor
nia's public transit is only used by
those who cannot afford to drive. In
fact, 78 percent of Caltrain riders
have access to cars they simply
choose the train because they find it
a more attractive option.
Bashing public transit is all too
fashionable among Stanford stu
dents. Worse, it is trendy for artsy
types like Wright to think of their
transit trips as a sort of romantic
"slumming" adventure to the
depths of society. If I could have a
dime for every novice photographer
who thought "Weird People I Met
on the Bus" was a good project idea,
I'd be a rich man.
While I understand that exag
geration often has literary value, this
story uses it irresponsibly. Wright's
frivolous and inaccessible essays are
usually pretty harmless, but this one
propagates the destructive belief
that the private automobile is the
only civilized way to get around.
