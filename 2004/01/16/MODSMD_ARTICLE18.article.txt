# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## The 						Stanford hills are alive with the sound of... grand theft 
### 
Throughout my childhood, the in
candescent beams emitting from
my television after dusk did a bril
liant job of skewing my perception
of the world. For example, the other night
during an emotionally intense conversation
with an ex-girlfriend, some dude was play
ing a piano inside my head and every word I
said (well, whispered ... OK! I'm a dork!)
was suddenly so profound.
Another ill effect of Hollywood indoctri
nation is my view of a police officer as either:
A) An anti-conventional badass with a
five o'clock shadow and a score to settle, 0r...
B) Some goof with the IQ of a cheese
burger whose shirt buttons are in all the
wrong holes.
Since all type-A cops serve in ninth
precinct NYC and will only stray elsewhere
to screw jurisdiction and track a crime boss
for a dynamite finale, I'm not inclined to
take our lovable campus squad very seri
ously. I had to be told that "Super Troop
ers" wasn't their 1998 highlight film.
But I'm trying. I'm trying really hard to
grant them the respect that any graduate of
the academy deserves (minus that bitch
Lieutenant Harris). I genuinely believe that
my TV-sponsored stereotypes would be
surmountable if it weren't for the SUPD's
persistence in fitting them like a Hyundai to
your mom's panties.
What?!
If you disagree, take a minute to check

out the weekly police blotter. While most
calls to duty consist of issuing MIPs to a few
careless frosh who should've left their solo

cups indoors, our boys in
tan occasionally see action
that could only come out
of a cartoon. Here are a
few examples:
Wednesday, Nov. 19,
2003, "An unknown sus
pect tried to ride off with a
bike near Varian. The
owner yelled at the suspect,
who returned the bike."
Tuesday, Dec. 16,2003,

"A man located 400 golf balls in Mirrielees
while working dorm security. It was designated
a suspicious circumstance."
If you think that's nuts, this happened
on the same day:
Tuesday, Dec 16, 2003, "A $1 bill was
turned into the police department after it
was found by a man on a trail."
A man on a trail? Are you serious? I
don't even want to speculate as to what
would possess someone to do that. Sounds
like a real situation on their hands. I hope
everything turned out all right.
OK, so the police logs do nothing to un
dermine my preconceptions of the SUPD as
an all-star Barney Fife squad. Neither do
any of my personal encounters. Last spring,
I had $2,000 worth of musical equipment
ganked out of my Jeep's backseat. When I

reported it stolen, they were helpful, but
also laughed about how a foolish girl had
been robbed of all of her credit cards from
the same parking lot a week earlier.
First of all, thanks for the warning, guys.
In terms of prioritization, the SUPD puts
preventing auto burglaries just below
"walking around and looking tough."
Second of all, it was clear they weren't
going to solve the case. My first indication of
this came when I solved it by myself, by acci
dent. I spotted the equipment at the San
Jose Guitar Center, the largest music store
in the area the most obvious place to
check. I notified the SUPD to announce the
good news, assuming that my property
would be back in my anxious hands within a
few days and that the perpetrator would
soon be apprehended and served his justice
with a side of prison peas.
Though I had a copy of the thief's driver's
license and verification that the guitar was in
deed mine, justice came about as fast as
drunken intercourse. It was two months be
fore I was reunited with my instrument. I un
derstand their logistical limitations in search
ing for everybody's lost stuff, but what about
pursuing the guys who drove down to campus
just to rob me? That mysterious man, whom
we only know his name, address, date of
birth, social security number, height, weight
and eye and hair color, runs free like that wolf
that ate Bambi. I gotta get an analogy book.
There are more hideous episodes in the

recent history of SUPD. Like when they ar
rested my sophomore roommate for sexual
assault five days after the accusation was
made, having never, in those five days, con
sulted the DA. My poor friend had his name
unjustly splashed across all the local papers
and would have had to clank a tin mug
against steel bars all weekend had he not
posted the $50,000 bail that night. The case
was thrown out in the next week.
How about when my junior year room
mate was issued a DUI after the senior formal
when the police tailed him from Tresidder to
Suites and didn't have any reason to issue a
breathalyzer test except that, after he safely
parked at his destination, they asked him if he
had had anything to drink and he said yes.
"No, we don't reward honesty, but have
a happy graduation!" In this case, their sus
picions must have formed when my friend
was walking to his car. If they truly cared
about safety, they would be preventing
drunk people from getting into their cars
and not scoring DUIs like touchdowns at a
Pee Wee football game. Oh man.
How about when they camcorded last
year's "Exotic Erotic" an annual party
where students arrive scantily-clad? I was
one of those unoriginal attendees who
asked for a "Girls Gone Wild" T-shirt and
whether Snoop Dogg was coming. It was all
hilarious, until I started having nightmares.
These are all anecdotes, not data, and
only what I have seen of their lack of con

cern for students; however, everyone is fa
miliar with nitpicky traffic patrols, cops
dishing out MIPs like Halloween candy, and
intersection-ambushes for harmless bikers
(To bikers: why stop? Save some cash and
make a break for it) all perpetrated with
a level of disrespect that seems typical of
small town police forces. It's not what we
should expect from citizens given the au
thority "To Protect and Serve."
In all fairness, Stanford Police officers do
exist who are both reasonable and helpful; it's
just that their thankless dedication is eclipsed
by the few lazy farts on the force who are bit
ter with age and awaiting retirement.
The good news is that the nice ones are
generally the young ones and they're rising
in the ranks. I suggest that we do future gen
erations a favor and establish a rapport with
the new officers. Respect is something that
can only be sustained if it's mutual. If they
serve it, we have an obligation to volley. It'd
be a shame if we let them go ice cold like
their predecessors. And I'm not talking
cooler than being cool.
