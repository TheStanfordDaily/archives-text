## Can you judge an athlete by his sweatpants? 
### 
What does a Stanford athlete
look like?
It's cold, and it sucks. Ev
eryone looks miserable,
; and the "popular group" of blond
; Greeks hanging around the clock tower
that is the perpetual marker of sunny
! weather at Stanford has gone into hiding,
j Probably in stylish winter clothes.
It is a telling time on the Farm because
it becomes painfully and frostily obvious
; who is from Southern California or the
tropics, and who is from the rest of the
weather-unblessed United States.

The latter category originates from
•places where people think fleece is
'stylish, have coordinating scarf-beanie
glove sets, and really get psyched for

Tahoe season. The rest
of us wear flip flops
and we're miserable.
Yah, our toes get cold
but once they're numb
you don't mind much
anyway.
It is also a time
when, if you had any
doubt whether that
tall, muscular black
male in your class was

an athlete, now you can be sure.
Today we 're going to be talking about
type casting athletes. It's a sensitive sub
ject, really, because there are people who
errantly assume that any tall, muscular
black male at Stanford must be here on a
sports-ride, aka free and easier admis
sion, and that the definition of athlete
stops with them. Exclude the female ath
letes, exclude the polo team you don't
know about anyway, exclude my dearly
beloved men's cross country team who
still hasn't gotten over my initial asser
tion that there is a hierarchy of athletes,
and that they're on the bottom.
Case in point: What team members
may or may not have received oral sex in
the drunken Delta Delta Delta scandal?
No, cross country team, not you.
So we're agreed that "athlete" means
football basketball water polo soccer, in
basically that descending order. We're
going to sidestep the issue of whether it is
s narrow or racist or unfair or accurate to
; categorize all tall, muscular black males
at Stanford as athletes. We're also not
going to deal with admissions drama, fi
nancial aid and all those other boring is
r sues.
* You can tell a Stanford athlete in the
; winter specifically by his characteristic
* gray matching Nike sweats and nice
* boots. I know, because after four long
; years of all-female social sciences cours
* es, and four years before that of high
I school all-girls femi-Nazi hell, one of
* them wound up in my class!
* Okay, that's about the gist of my
J story. I took my cousin to prom. Except
that if you are in a state of denial about
t the high status of athletes, ask yourself if
I you could get away with gray matching
sweats and nice boots and still look good
. in class. Or at a party. I wore sweats to a
Sigma Chi party once, but then again, I
took my cousin to prom. Not really but
someone else did.
On a politically frustrated related
note about getting away with things, I
; hate TSA and all our new "safer" airport
■ security. They seized my nail clippers
t while my friend's sister got on the plane
I with a hedgehog in her bra.
» No, I'm serious. They're nocturnal, so
I it just chilled in her bra quite warmly.
J And the plane was removed from any
'* threat of me clipping my neighbor for the
{ window seat.
?• So by the way, there's no imitating the
f. athlete sweat combo look. It can't be
t done. Not with Reebok sweats, almost
■ the-same-color-gray sweats, Wal-Mart
.'discount sweats, even the actual Nike
♦sweats.
I once got a hold of a pair of XXL
football gray Nike sweats and still didn't
look like an athlete, although I got a lot
of bitchy "what a slut" looks. It's a fine
fine, then, between the "baggy sweats"
v look and the "I hooked up with a football
' player and am wearing the sweats as
some sort of flaunted psychological
vprize" look.
v; - By the way I didn't hook up with him
v snd he still didn't call me back.
viS I guess things could be worse. We
£cpuld be going to a real Ivy League school
you have to scurry through under
ground snow tunnels to get to class for six
* months out of the year, and they're not
>bven Division-I, so why would you want
I, to take their sweats anyway.
;%/ And for those who don't know it's
vtrue that you lose all your heat through
'' your head and your feet.

What does a Stanford athlete
look like?
It's cold, and it sucks. Ev
eryone looks miserable,
; and the "popular group" of blond
; Greeks hanging around the clock tower
that is the perpetual marker of sunny
! weather at Stanford has gone into hiding,
j Probably in stylish winter clothes.
It is a telling time on the Farm because
it becomes painfully and frostily obvious
; who is from Southern California or the
tropics, and who is from the rest of the
weather-unblessed United States.

The latter category originates from
•places where people think fleece is
'stylish, have coordinating scarf-beanie
glove sets, and really get psyched for

Tahoe season. The rest
of us wear flip flops
and we're miserable.
Yah, our toes get cold
but once they're numb
you don't mind much
anyway.
It is also a time
when, if you had any
doubt whether that
tall, muscular black
male in your class was

an athlete, now you can be sure.
Today we 're going to be talking about
type casting athletes. It's a sensitive sub
ject, really, because there are people who
errantly assume that any tall, muscular
black male at Stanford must be here on a
sports-ride, aka free and easier admis
sion, and that the definition of athlete
stops with them. Exclude the female ath
letes, exclude the polo team you don't
know about anyway, exclude my dearly
beloved men's cross country team who
still hasn't gotten over my initial asser
tion that there is a hierarchy of athletes,
and that they're on the bottom.
Case in point: What team members
may or may not have received oral sex in
the drunken Delta Delta Delta scandal?
No, cross country team, not you.
So we're agreed that "athlete" means
football basketball water polo soccer, in
basically that descending order. We're
going to sidestep the issue of whether it is
s narrow or racist or unfair or accurate to
; categorize all tall, muscular black males
at Stanford as athletes. We're also not
going to deal with admissions drama, fi
nancial aid and all those other boring is
r sues.
* You can tell a Stanford athlete in the
; winter specifically by his characteristic
* gray matching Nike sweats and nice
* boots. I know, because after four long
; years of all-female social sciences cours
* es, and four years before that of high
I school all-girls femi-Nazi hell, one of
