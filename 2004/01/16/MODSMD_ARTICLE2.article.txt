# SNAPSHOTS OF A LEADER

### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
So much of the aura surrounding redshirt
sophomore Chris Hernandez reads like a twisted
folk-legend that's been altered over time.
Like the way your grandfather used to tell you
that he walked 20 miles to school, up a hill and
through the snow, every single day even during
the summer.

Likewise, some of the
truths surrounding
Hernandez sound
just as far-fetched.

"Legend has
it" that Hernandez
once played a high
school game with

nine stitches in his
hand and finished out
another with a gash that

later required seven stitches.
And Sixth Man Club members watched
two seasons ago as the then-freshman hustled
his way toward 14 points, four assists and two
steals (in a three-point loss to UCLA), visi
bly grimacing as he repeatedly dove for
loose ball after loose ball despite playing
with what he then-called "a slight sepa
ration" in his left shoulder.
"Chris he's our leader from a
mental standpoint and a physical stand
point," said senior guard Matt Lottich
after Stanford's win over then-No. 3
Arizona last weekend. "He's just so
strong."

Everybody's saying it, Hernan
dez is just a tough-minded kid, a gritty
athlete who's had his share of injuries and
with the exception of the left foot that he

broke twice last year Hernandez has pret
ty much figured out how to play through the pain,
including a nagging injury to his back that has

forced him to sit out two games this season already
and requires that he stand up for the majority of
games even when he's on the sidelines.
(Hernandez first broke his foot during practice in
late October of 2002. After returning to action a lit
tle over a month later, he then re-broke his foot after
only 18 minutes of play. The NCAA granted him a
medical redshirt, allowing him to repeat his sopho
more year all over again this year.)
"I think having [Lottich] and Hernandez as
your two guards gives you a certain persona,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"They're both tough kids who set the tone."
In many ways, Hernandez's absence from the
program last season was the pink elephant in the
room screaming for attention.
Leaving Stanford fans asking, "what if?" and
wondering, "if only."

"It was hard," said Hernandez matter-of-fact
ly about his missed season. "I've never sat out
that long [before]. It was like I wasn't part of the
team. I wasn't practicing. I wasn't traveling. I
was separated from all the guys that was the
hardest part."

To a certain extent, a lot of the worry about
Hernandez missing last season was based on
both speculations and lofty expectations for the
6-foot-2 point guard from Fresno, Calif., who av
eraged just over 13 minutes a game during his
freshman campaign.

In other words, he was a potentially strong
piece to an evolving Stanford puzzle.
Emphasis on "potentially."
"Chris was an unknown [coming into this sea
son] because he was out [last year]," Mont
gomery said.

But to the chagrin of Montgomery and Hernan
dez's teammates, he has quickly established himself
as the integral component this season that many spec
ulated he could be.

"We [lost] Julius Barnes but we put Chris
