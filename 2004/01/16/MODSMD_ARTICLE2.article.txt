# SNAPSHOTS OF A LEADER
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
So much of the aura surrounding redshirt
sophomore Chris Hernandez reads like a twisted
folk-legend that's been altered over time.
Like the way your grandfather used to tell you
that he walked 20 miles to school, up a hill and
through the snow, every single day even during
the summer.

Likewise, some of the
truths surrounding
Hernandez sound
just as far-fetched.

"Legend has
it" that Hernandez
once played a high
school game with

nine stitches in his
hand and finished out
another with a gash that

later required seven stitches.
And Sixth Man Club members watched
two seasons ago as the then-freshman hustled
his way toward 14 points, four assists and two
steals (in a three-point loss to UCLA), visi
bly grimacing as he repeatedly dove for
loose ball after loose ball despite playing
with what he then-called "a slight sepa
ration" in his left shoulder.
"Chris he's our leader from a
mental standpoint and a physical stand
point," said senior guard Matt Lottich
after Stanford's win over then-No. 3
Arizona last weekend. "He's just so
strong."

Everybody's saying it, Hernan
dez is just a tough-minded kid, a gritty
athlete who's had his share of injuries and
with the exception of the left foot that he

broke twice last year Hernandez has pret
ty much figured out how to play through the pain,
including a nagging injury to his back that has

forced him to sit out two games this season already
and requires that he stand up for the majority of
games even when he's on the sidelines.
(Hernandez first broke his foot during practice in
late October of 2002. After returning to action a lit
tle over a month later, he then re-broke his foot after
only 18 minutes of play. The NCAA granted him a
medical redshirt, allowing him to repeat his sopho
more year all over again this year.)
"I think having [Lottich] and Hernandez as
your two guards gives you a certain persona,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"They're both tough kids who set the tone."
In many ways, Hernandez's absence from the
program last season was the pink elephant in the
room screaming for attention.
Leaving Stanford fans asking, "what if?" and
wondering, "if only."

"It was hard," said Hernandez matter-of-fact
ly about his missed season. "I've never sat out
that long [before]. It was like I wasn't part of the
team. I wasn't practicing. I wasn't traveling. I
was separated from all the guys that was the
hardest part."

To a certain extent, a lot of the worry about
Hernandez missing last season was based on
both speculations and lofty expectations for the
6-foot-2 point guard from Fresno, Calif., who av
eraged just over 13 minutes a game during his
freshman campaign.

In other words, he was a potentially strong
piece to an evolving Stanford puzzle.
Emphasis on "potentially."
"Chris was an unknown [coming into this sea
son] because he was out [last year]," Mont
gomery said.

But to the chagrin of Montgomery and Hernan
dez's teammates, he has quickly established himself
as the integral component this season that many spec
ulated he could be.

Hernandez in and really we
[haven't missed] a beat there and
in some respects we're stronger,"
Montgomery said. "We have bet
ter leadership [now]."
And, for several reasons, his
play this season has left many ar
guing that he was the missing link
from this team a year ago.

First off all, Hernandez has fig
ured out a way to be an offensive
threat from within the preexisting
offensive framework trading
flashy plays for easy buckets, which
is the main difference between Her
nandez and Barnes.
Moreover, because of the con
sistent offensive development from
his teammates in the frontcourt
sophomore Matt Haryasz, juniors
Rob Little, Josh Childress and Nick
Robinson and seniors Justin Davis
and Joe Kirchofer and the al

ways ready-to-score presence of
Lottich, Hernandez hasn't been
saddled with the burden of putting
up big numbers every night like
Barnes was. Even though he's ca
pable of doing just that.
He's shooting 55 percent from
behind the three-point arch, 94
percent from the charity stripe
and averaging 10.6 points per
game.
And add to that the fact that he's
leading a team in assists that's aver
aging 17.6 per game what results

is a well-rounded team a de
scription that definitely eluded the
Cardinal last season in Hernandez's
absence.
"[Chris] is our security blanket.
He settles us down. It's good to
have him in there," Montgomery
said.
Which isn't to say that's there's
not room for improvement, accord
ing to Montgomery.
"I pointed out the fact that they
turned the ball over 20 times
[against Arizona]," Montgomery

said a statistic that Hernandez
felt personally responsible for.
"Chris felt real bad about the
turnovers," Montgomery said after
Stanford's win over the Wildcats.
"He apologized to me after the
game. He's a tough kid."
Which is, perhaps, too simple a
description for all that Hernandez
has been through, all the injuries
that he's endured throughout his
basketball career.
"A lot of people like to call me
the so-called 'tough guy,' 'the

leader,' " Hernandez says, using
his fingers as quotation marks with
a smile. "But I wish people would
just think of me as a player."
If he continues on the road he's
on and his body holds up through
the journey, maybe, just maybe,
Hernandez's vision of himself will
become a permanent part of the
legend.
But, then again, even legends
are held captive to time.

Everybody's saying it, Hernan
dez is just a tough-minded kid, a gritty
athlete who's had his share of injuries and
with the exception of the left foot that he

broke twice last year Hernandez has pret
ty much figured out how to play through the pain,
including a nagging injury to his back that has

forced him to sit out two games this season already
and requires that he stand up for the majority of
games even when he's on the sidelines.
(Hernandez first broke his foot during practice in
late October of 2002. After returning to action a lit
tle over a month later, he then re-broke his foot after
only 18 minutes of play. The NCAA granted him a
medical redshirt, allowing him to repeat his sopho
more year all over again this year.)
"I think having [Lottich] and Hernandez as
your two guards gives you a certain persona,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"They're both tough kids who set the tone."
In many ways, Hernandez's absence from the
program last season was the pink elephant in the
room screaming for attention.
Leaving Stanford fans asking, "what if?" and
wondering, "if only."

"It was hard," said Hernandez matter-of-fact
ly about his missed season. "I've never sat out
that long [before]. It was like I wasn't part of the
team. I wasn't practicing. I wasn't traveling. I
was separated from all the guys that was the
hardest part."

To a certain extent, a lot of the worry about
Hernandez missing last season was based on
both speculations and lofty expectations for the
6-foot-2 point guard from Fresno, Calif., who av
eraged just over 13 minutes a game during his
freshman campaign.

In other words, he was a potentially strong
piece to an evolving Stanford puzzle.
Emphasis on "potentially."
"Chris was an unknown [coming into this sea
son] because he was out [last year]," Mont
gomery said.

But to the chagrin of Montgomery and Hernan
dez's teammates, he has quickly established himself
as the integral component this season that many spec
ulated he could be.

Hernandez in and really we
[haven't missed] a beat there and
in some respects we're stronger,"
Montgomery said. "We have bet
ter leadership [now]."
And, for several reasons, his
play this season has left many ar
guing that he was the missing link
from this team a year ago.

First off all, Hernandez has fig
ured out a way to be an offensive
threat from within the preexisting
offensive framework trading
flashy plays for easy buckets, which
is the main difference between Her
nandez and Barnes.
Moreover, because of the con
sistent offensive development from
his teammates in the frontcourt
sophomore Matt Haryasz, juniors
Rob Little, Josh Childress and Nick
Robinson and seniors Justin Davis
and Joe Kirchofer and the al

ways ready-to-score presence of
Lottich, Hernandez hasn't been
saddled with the burden of putting
up big numbers every night like
Barnes was. Even though he's ca
pable of doing just that.
He's shooting 55 percent from
behind the three-point arch, 94
percent from the charity stripe
and averaging 10.6 points per
game.
And add to that the fact that he's
leading a team in assists that's aver
aging 17.6 per game what results

is a well-rounded team a de
scription that definitely eluded the
Cardinal last season in Hernandez's
absence.
"[Chris] is our security blanket.
He settles us down. It's good to
have him in there," Montgomery
said.
Which isn't to say that's there's
not room for improvement, accord
ing to Montgomery.
"I pointed out the fact that they
turned the ball over 20 times
[against Arizona]," Montgomery

said a statistic that Hernandez
felt personally responsible for.
"Chris felt real bad about the
turnovers," Montgomery said after
Stanford's win over the Wildcats.
"He apologized to me after the
game. He's a tough kid."
Which is, perhaps, too simple a
description for all that Hernandez
has been through, all the injuries
that he's endured throughout his
basketball career.
"A lot of people like to call me
the so-called 'tough guy,' 'the

leader,' " Hernandez says, using
his fingers as quotation marks with
a smile. "But I wish people would
just think of me as a player."
If he continues on the road he's
on and his body holds up through
the journey, maybe, just maybe,
Hernandez's vision of himself will
become a permanent part of the
legend.
But, then again, even legends
are held captive to time.
No matter how far-fetched that
sounds.
So much of the aura surrounding redshirt
sophomore Chris Hernandez reads like a twisted
folk-legend that's been altered over time.
Like the way your grandfather used to tell you
that he walked 20 miles to school, up a hill and
through the snow, every single day even during
the summer.

Likewise, some of the
truths surrounding
Hernandez sound
just as far-fetched.

"Legend has
it" that Hernandez
once played a high
school game with

nine stitches in his
hand and finished out
another with a gash that

later required seven stitches.
And Sixth Man Club members watched
two seasons ago as the then-freshman hustled
his way toward 14 points, four assists and two
steals (in a three-point loss to UCLA), visi
bly grimacing as he repeatedly dove for
loose ball after loose ball despite playing
with what he then-called "a slight sepa
ration" in his left shoulder.
"Chris he's our leader from a
mental standpoint and a physical stand
point," said senior guard Matt Lottich
after Stanford's win over then-No. 3
Arizona last weekend. "He's just so
strong."

Everybody's saying it, Hernan
