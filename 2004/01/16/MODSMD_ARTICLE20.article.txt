# Wrestles pin win against Ducks
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford wrestling team (4-4) came into last night's
home dual meet against Oregon (1-6) having lost eight
straight and 29 of 31 duals overall to the Ducks.
At first glance, Thursday's 31-6 final score would seem to
indicate much of the same Duck domination, only it was the
Cardinal who did the dominating this time.
Junior Brad Metzler, ranked No. 12 in the nation at 141
pounds, clinched the victory with a pin in the first period of
his bout.

"Coming in here, we definitely had the confidence to
beat these guys," Metzler said. "We felt like there was no
way we could be beat. Right now we're on the rise and ev
eryday we're getting tougher and tougher."
After Stanford redshirt freshman Brian Perry dropped
the opening bout at 165, sophomore Imad Kharbush re
sponded with a hard-fought 10-8 decision, his 14th win of
the season.
Senior John Garfinkel's 13-2 major decision gave Stan
ford a 7-3 advantage before Oregon senior Jake Leair
brought the Ducks to within 7-6.
The momentum of the meet swung on the outcome of
the next bout. Stanford's Shawn Ritzenthaler, just 1-3 on
the season coming into the bout, fell behind in the first peri
od and trailed 6-3 in the second before knotting the score at
six apiece 30 seconds before the buzzer.
Stanford fans among the Burnham Pavilion crowd began
banging the bleachers as the third and final period began,
wherein Ritzenthaler fell behind again, 8-6, after an Oregon
takedown. The Cardinal heavyweight tied the score 8-8 with
a reversal and put Cardinal fans on their feet with the deci
sive takedown with 15 seconds remaining in the bout.
From there, freshman Tanner Gardner continued his im
pressive start to the season with a 3-2 decision via riding
time, and senior Paul Gross put Stanford up 16-6 with a 6-1
decision over Oregon's Jason Harless, who was ranked No.
20 in the nation and No. 3 in the Pac-10 at 133.
Gross' victory set up Metzler's polishing off of the
Ducks. The junior captain made quick work of Oregon's
Skyler Woods, pinning him in the first period to put the Car
dinal ahead 22-6. The pin was Metzler's fourth of the season
and improved his record to 16-2, including a 7-1 mark in
dual meets.
An 11-6 decision by Stanford sophomore Luis Vendrell
at 149, his second dual meet win of the season, followed.

The Cardinal's top wrestler, junior Matt Gentry, had the
easiest night of any Stanford wrestler, winning via forfeit to
close out the scoring.
Stanford's win came on the heels off a tough 21-18 loss to
Cal State-Bakersfield, a meet in which the team wrestled
well despite picking up the loss. The Cardinal dropped last
year's bout to Oregon 32-6, the sixth of what would become
a season-long seven straight losses in dual meets.
Things seemed to have turned around for the squad this
year.

"We've got 10 guys in our lineup who have a lot of
heart," Stanford head coach Steve Buddie said. "This has
been the most enjoyable year by far of my coaching career.
Everyone's working equally hard and the bottom line is it's
just extremely enjoyable to come to work with these guys
right now."
Thirty-one wrestles will compete for Stanford at this Sat
urday's Aggie Open in Davis, Calif. The team returns to
dual meet action on Jan. 23 at Cal Poly and the next home
meet will be Jan. 30 against Cal State-Fullerton.
