# Team chemistry key for Cardinal success
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In his 26th year as a college basketball
head coach, Mike Montgomery isn't prone
to bouts of wild enthusiasm.
So when he says of this year's Stanford
team, "There's not much to be unhappy
with, really," that's his version of a rave re
view.
With a perfect 13-0 record and two wins
over top five opponents, the No. 3 Cardinal
has been perhaps the most successful team
in college basketball so far this season.
What's shocking to many of the national
media who are just now turning their atten
tion to Stanford is the team's relative lack of
star power.
Josh Childress, the only Cardinal player
who was considered a marquee prospect in
high school, missed the team's first nine vic
tories. Pundits marveled that Stanford was
so successful in his absence, but just as im
pressive is how seamlessly he has been
woven into the fabric of the team since his
return.
Stanford isn't a team built on over
whelming natural ability. Duke, the team
ranked one spot ahead of the Cardinal na
tionally, could hardly fail to be successful

with seven former McDonald's High School
Ail-Americans on its roster. On paper,
Stanford's players possess ability more com
parable to those at California, which is un
ranked and has a losing record.
What sets the Cardinal apart? Mont
gomery said it's the way the team works to
gether.
"You've got a good combination where
you've got some size, you've got some
depth, you've got kind of a driver / slasher /
glider in Josh, you've got a real role / un
selfish kid in Nick [Robinson]," Mont
gomery said. "You've just got a lot of differ
ent ingredients, and everybody's on the
same page."
Montgomery hesitated to compare this
year's squad to his best teams of the past,
but he indicated that its blend of personali
ties and abilities is a rare pleasure for a
coach.
"I like this team," he said. "I don't think
there's much selfishness, I don't think any
body's too concerned about his numbers,
and we've got great leadership. I like all
those things. But I don't know one of the
teams I think we had four first-round draft
picks on, and I don't know if we've got that
on this team."
The team with four NBA draft picks was

the 2000-01 club, which began the season 20-
0 en route to a 31-3 final record and a loss to
Maryland in the NCAA Regional Final.
That team had three obvious stars: Casey
Jacobsen, Jason Collins and Jarron Collins.
One could argue that this year's team has
none.
Childress is sensational, but he has yet to
start a game and the team has shown it can
win without him. In various games, Chris
Hernandez, Matt Lottich, Rob Little and
Justin Davis have all stepped up to lead the
team. All five are averaging between 10.5
and 13.9 points per game. Which is the
team's best defender? Maybe none of the
above Robinson (6.7 ppg) is often pin
pointed as the Cardinal's most reliable stop
per.
Perhaps the most striking indicator of
how important balance is to this team is the
fact that Montgomery kept the starting line
up constant when Childress returned to the
lineup. Rather than risk upsetting the
team's chemistry, Montgomery has brought
the junior forward off the bench in all four
games since his return.
Montgomery downplays the significance
of the starting lineup.
"We've got eight guys that are going to
start against Cal," he said. Technically,

that's illegal, but perhaps it's true symboli
cally— "the players seem equally uncon
cerned about who goes in at what time and
for how many minutes.
"Our team is such a tight-knit group of
guys, no one really cares who gets the cred
it," sophomore forward Matt Haryasz said.
"On any given night, it could be a different
guy who steps up. Almost every game a dif
ferent guy comes up big for us."
Seven different players have led the team
in scoring in different games this year, and
no player has done so more than four times.
Haryasz has never led the team in scoring,
but is one of the five players to lead the team
in rebounding at least once.
Montgomery said one main reason for
the balance is that the team is full of players
who know they have to work hard to be suc
cessful at the college level.
"You look at Duke, and maybe Arizona
and UCLA in the past, they're getting the
[high school recruit] that you look at and
say, 'Wow, look at him, he can do this, this,
this and this,"' Montgomery said. "I do
think that over the years things have
changed to where a lot of people won't take
guys and spend time with them. They want
to get the finished product, so they'll
consistently look for the best athlete.
But that's just never been something

we've been able to do here, and it
wasn't something I could do at Mon
tana."
Instead, Montgomery has landed
players like Lottich, Little and Robin
son, who have transformed them
selves from awkward benchwarmers
to bona fide starters and leaders.

The California game will offer
Stanford's upperclassmen another
chance to show how experience and
cohesiveness can trump raw ability,
as they match up against California's
trio of talented freshman starters:
Marquise Kately, Ayinde Übaka,
and Leon "The Show" Powe.

the junior forward off the bench in all four
games since his return.
Montgomery downplays the significance
of the starting lineup.
"We've got eight guys that are going to
start against Cal," he said. Technically,

that's illegal, but perhaps it's true symboli
cally— "the players seem equally uncon
cerned about who goes in at what time and
for how many minutes.
"Our team is such a tight-knit group of
guys, no one really cares who gets the cred
it," sophomore forward Matt Haryasz said.
"On any given night, it could be a different
guy who steps up. Almost every game a dif
ferent guy comes up big for us."
Seven different players have led the team
in scoring in different games this year, and
no player has done so more than four times.
Haryasz has never led the team in scoring,
but is one of the five players to lead the team
in rebounding at least once.
Montgomery said one main reason for
the balance is that the team is full of players
who know they have to work hard to be suc
cessful at the college level.
"You look at Duke, and maybe Arizona
and UCLA in the past, they're getting the
[high school recruit] that you look at and
say, 'Wow, look at him, he can do this, this,
this and this,"' Montgomery said. "I do
think that over the years things have
changed to where a lot of people won't take
guys and spend time with them. They want
to get the finished product, so they'll
consistently look for the best athlete.
But that's just never been something

we've been able to do here, and it
wasn't something I could do at Mon
tana."
Instead, Montgomery has landed
players like Lottich, Little and Robin
son, who have transformed them
selves from awkward benchwarmers
to bona fide starters and leaders.

The California game will offer
Stanford's upperclassmen another
chance to show how experience and
cohesiveness can trump raw ability,
as they match up against California's
trio of talented freshman starters:
Marquise Kately, Ayinde Übaka,
and Leon "The Show" Powe.
In his 26th year as a college basketball
head coach, Mike Montgomery isn't prone
to bouts of wild enthusiasm.
So when he says of this year's Stanford
team, "There's not much to be unhappy
with, really," that's his version of a rave re
view.
With a perfect 13-0 record and two wins
over top five opponents, the No. 3 Cardinal
has been perhaps the most successful team
in college basketball so far this season.
What's shocking to many of the national
media who are just now turning their atten
tion to Stanford is the team's relative lack of
star power.
Josh Childress, the only Cardinal player
who was considered a marquee prospect in
high school, missed the team's first nine vic
tories. Pundits marveled that Stanford was
so successful in his absence, but just as im
pressive is how seamlessly he has been
woven into the fabric of the team since his
return.
Stanford isn't a team built on over
whelming natural ability. Duke, the team
ranked one spot ahead of the Cardinal na
tionally, could hardly fail to be successful

with seven former McDonald's High School
Ail-Americans on its roster. On paper,
Stanford's players possess ability more com
parable to those at California, which is un
ranked and has a losing record.
What sets the Cardinal apart? Mont
gomery said it's the way the team works to
gether.
"You've got a good combination where
you've got some size, you've got some
depth, you've got kind of a driver / slasher /
glider in Josh, you've got a real role / un
selfish kid in Nick [Robinson]," Mont
gomery said. "You've just got a lot of differ
ent ingredients, and everybody's on the
same page."
Montgomery hesitated to compare this
year's squad to his best teams of the past,
but he indicated that its blend of personali
ties and abilities is a rare pleasure for a
coach.
"I like this team," he said. "I don't think
there's much selfishness, I don't think any
body's too concerned about his numbers,
and we've got great leadership. I like all
those things. But I don't know one of the
teams I think we had four first-round draft
picks on, and I don't know if we've got that
on this team."
The team with four NBA draft picks was

the 2000-01 club, which began the season 20-
0 en route to a 31-3 final record and a loss to
Maryland in the NCAA Regional Final.
That team had three obvious stars: Casey
Jacobsen, Jason Collins and Jarron Collins.
One could argue that this year's team has
none.
Childress is sensational, but he has yet to
start a game and the team has shown it can
win without him. In various games, Chris
Hernandez, Matt Lottich, Rob Little and
Justin Davis have all stepped up to lead the
team. All five are averaging between 10.5
and 13.9 points per game. Which is the
team's best defender? Maybe none of the
above Robinson (6.7 ppg) is often pin
pointed as the Cardinal's most reliable stop
per.
Perhaps the most striking indicator of
how important balance is to this team is the
fact that Montgomery kept the starting line
up constant when Childress returned to the
lineup. Rather than risk upsetting the
team's chemistry, Montgomery has brought
the junior forward off the bench in all four
games since his return.
