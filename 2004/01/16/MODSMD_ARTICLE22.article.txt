# Women split forces in Las Vegas, Seattle
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis is striving
for success this weekend at two separate
tournaments. Six players are headed to the
Freeman Memorial Tennis Championships
in Las Vegas today, while three more ven
tured to the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Tournament in Seattle.
Victories at both tournaments have just
slipped through the Cardinal's fingers in
previous years.
In 2001, former Cardinal Gabriela Las
tra dropped in the final round of Freeman
to Villmarie Castellvi of Tennessee, 4-6, 6-
2,4-6.
In 2002, Castellvi handed a swifter brand
of disappointment to Cardinal Amber Liu,
winning in just two sets, 6-4,6-3.
Cardinal senior Lauren Barnikow
reached the top division of Pac-10 Indoor fi
nals both years, losing to UCLA's Jewel Pe
terson in 2001 and Oregon's eighth-ranked
Daria Panova in 2002.
"[Barnikow] is back to hope to at least
equal her past performances," said head
coach Lele Forood.
"The first flight is really strong, and
sometimes it just depends on your draw,"
Barnikow said. "I might not be seeded so
I'm not really going in saying I [only] want to
win [the championship]. I'd prefer to get
some good matches and get ready for the
[dual match] season."
Currently ranked at No. 20, Barnikow

has gotten off to something of a rocky start
this season. Ranked tenth last September,
she then fell in the Round of 16 in three of
four individual competitions
Barnikow fared better at the Stanford
hosted ITA Northwest Regional Champi
onships in October. However, her run
ended in the quarterfinals against California
freshman Sasha Podkolzina, whose arsenal
of unbeatable serves and baseline-fired
drop shots paved the way for a 6-3,6-1 Bears
victory.
The Pac-10 Indoor stage is all but set for
a melee this weekend. Heralded as the pre
mier conference in the nation, Pac-10 mem
bers have snatched up 14 of 22 national titles
since the 1982 inception of NCAA women's
tennis. The second-ranked Card will have to
fend off No. 3 Cal nipping at its heels, as well
as No. 6 Southern California, No. 7 Wash
ington, and No. 11 UCLA.
The remaining four teams, Arizona
State, Arizona, Oregon and Washington
State are in the top 51 nationwide.
Though the draw was unavailable as of
press time, it is very likely that Barnikow
will face two hard-hitting opponents who
stifled her success earlier this season. Cali
fornia's No. 2 Raquel Kops-Jones, a junior,
and No. 18 Podkolzina are both bound for
Seattle.
"I had a really close match with Raquel,
it was over three hours long," said
Barnikow, recalling her 5-7, 6-3, 3-6 loss to

Sophomore Amber Liu, who won the NCAA singles championship last year, will sit out
of the tournaments this weekend in preparation for a challenger in Hawaii.
