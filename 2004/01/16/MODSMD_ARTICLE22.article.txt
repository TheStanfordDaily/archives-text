# Women split forces in Las Vegas, Seattle
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 2 Stanford women's tennis is striving
for success this weekend at two separate
tournaments. Six players are headed to the
Freeman Memorial Tennis Championships
in Las Vegas today, while three more ven
tured to the Pacific-10 Conference Indoor
Tournament in Seattle.
Victories at both tournaments have just
slipped through the Cardinal's fingers in
previous years.
In 2001, former Cardinal Gabriela Las
tra dropped in the final round of Freeman
to Villmarie Castellvi of Tennessee, 4-6, 6-
2,4-6.
In 2002, Castellvi handed a swifter brand
of disappointment to Cardinal Amber Liu,
winning in just two sets, 6-4,6-3.
Cardinal senior Lauren Barnikow
reached the top division of Pac-10 Indoor fi
nals both years, losing to UCLA's Jewel Pe
terson in 2001 and Oregon's eighth-ranked
Daria Panova in 2002.
"[Barnikow] is back to hope to at least
equal her past performances," said head
coach Lele Forood.
"The first flight is really strong, and
sometimes it just depends on your draw,"
Barnikow said. "I might not be seeded so
I'm not really going in saying I [only] want to
win [the championship]. I'd prefer to get
some good matches and get ready for the
[dual match] season."
Currently ranked at No. 20, Barnikow

has gotten off to something of a rocky start
this season. Ranked tenth last September,
she then fell in the Round of 16 in three of
four individual competitions
Barnikow fared better at the Stanford
hosted ITA Northwest Regional Champi
onships in October. However, her run
ended in the quarterfinals against California
freshman Sasha Podkolzina, whose arsenal
of unbeatable serves and baseline-fired
drop shots paved the way for a 6-3,6-1 Bears
victory.
The Pac-10 Indoor stage is all but set for
a melee this weekend. Heralded as the pre
mier conference in the nation, Pac-10 mem
bers have snatched up 14 of 22 national titles
since the 1982 inception of NCAA women's
tennis. The second-ranked Card will have to
fend off No. 3 Cal nipping at its heels, as well
as No. 6 Southern California, No. 7 Wash
ington, and No. 11 UCLA.
The remaining four teams, Arizona
State, Arizona, Oregon and Washington
State are in the top 51 nationwide.
Though the draw was unavailable as of
press time, it is very likely that Barnikow
will face two hard-hitting opponents who
stifled her success earlier this season. Cali
fornia's No. 2 Raquel Kops-Jones, a junior,
and No. 18 Podkolzina are both bound for
Seattle.
"I had a really close match with Raquel,
it was over three hours long," said
Barnikow, recalling her 5-7, 6-3, 3-6 loss to

Sophomore Amber Liu, who won the NCAA singles championship last year, will sit out
of the tournaments this weekend in preparation for a challenger in Hawaii.

"[This time] I just need to make
sure I'm feeling good about my
game. I just need to step it up on
some big points. I've lost to some
good players, but it would be nice to
beat 'em, and I'm ready to beat 'em,"
added Barnikow.
Indoor action also marks the re
turn of Stanford's Kara Guzman, a
junior, to the competitive fray. Guz
man suffered a shoulder injury on
the first day of practice this year, and
has not played a tournament since
last April.
"I'm a little nervous," Guzman
said. "Last year, I'd been really well
prepared and played several tourna
ments over the summer, as well as
Regionals [in the fall]."
Last year, Guzman advanced to
third flight semifinals at Pac-10 In
door before losing to Washington's

Erin Hoe, 2-6,0-6.
"[Since my injury], I've been
doing physical therapy for at least an
hour every day," Guzman said. "I've
[mostly] been concentrating on try
ing to get the speed back in my
serve."
Sophomore Jessica Leek will also
compete at the Pac-10 tournament.
Six of the remaining Stanford
teammates are headed for Las
Vegas, where they pose a significant
threat to a 32-member singles play
ing field. Players are drawn nation
wide, particularly from the south
eastern region, home to No. 1 Flori
da, reigning NCAA Champion.
"It's a nice mix of players we
don't usually see in dual [match
play]," Forood said. "We're [espe
cially] eager to see some Gators that
we're not familiar with."
Alice Barnes, a sophomore cur
rently ranked No. 21, lasted until
semifinals in 2003 before deferring
to Castellvi, 2-6,1-6. Like Barnikow,
she has struggled through her share
of individual tournaments this year,
dropping from her sixth place pre
season ranking.
Freshman Theresa Logar, who is

unseeded in the Freeman tourna
ment, has her own share of chal
lenges to overcome in Sin City.
"I kind of have a vendetta be
cause I played a tournament there in
April and I lost in the finals," Logar
said. "I can't play that tournament
again but maybe if I go back to the
same place... there's hope."
Still absent from the Cardinal
lineup are Liu and seventh-ranked
junior Erin Burdette.
"Amber is going to play a chal
lenger in Hawaii as part of her last
pro fling before the season kind of
grinds into high gear," Forood said.
After having surgery on her right
wrist last October, Burdette is mak
ing a brilliant recovery and will be
ready for match play in two weeks
against Texas Christian.
"I hit with her for a long time [on
Wednesday]," Forood said. "She's
doing great, we're just taking every
thing slow."
Forood also imparts her opti
mism on her team's prospects this
weekend. "It's our final preseason
tournaments, and everybody has a
chance to really go for it."
