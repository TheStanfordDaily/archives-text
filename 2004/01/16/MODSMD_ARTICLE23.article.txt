# UOP up next for swimmers

The third ranked Stanford men's
swim team will take on the Universi
ty of Pacific Tigers tomorrow at the
Avery Aquatics Complex. The Car
dinal, now 2-0 after last weekend's
victory at Michigan, look to improve
their record.
Although the meet should be ex
citing and quite fast, not all of the
Cardinal swimmers will be in the
lineup come Saturday's dual meet.
With meets against both Arizona

and Arizona State just a week away,
coach Skip Kenney feels that some
swimmers would benefit more from
a workout than a meet.
Even though a few superstars will
be sitting out the competition, the
Cardinal will hardly have a sub-par
lineup. Ail-Americans Dan Trupin
and Gary Marshall should lead the
way and will probably produce some
fast times for the team. Further
more, the freshman class is looking
for a strong showing from its mem
bers after an exciting meet last

weekend.
Coming off last weekend's in
tense meet against Michigan, the
Cardinal is looking to carry momen
tum into the Arizona meets. The
team is also looking forward to com
peting again in the short course
yards format after competing in me
ters in Ann Arbor.
After they take on the Tigers, the
men turn their attention to highly
ranked Arizona and Arizona state,
meets which will also be held at
Avery.

The No. 3.men's swimming team looks for a win this weekend against University of the Pacific, even with several of
its top swimmers sitting out of the competition.
