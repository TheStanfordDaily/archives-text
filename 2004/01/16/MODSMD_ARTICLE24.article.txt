## Latino studies major added at U. Nebraska 
### AMBER BROZEK DAILY NEBRASKAN 
(U-WIRE) LINCOLN, Neb. In the
past 10 years, the Latino population in Ne
braska has increased 155 percent.
Lucy Garza, project coordinator for the
University of Nebraska at Omaha Office of
Latino/Latin American Studies of the Great
Plains, is ready to capitalize on that statistic.
Garza's office is taking new steps to bet
ter prepare students to work with the na
tion's increasing Latino population. A new
Latino/Latin American studies major at
UNO will be available to students in fall
2004.
"Student interest in Chicano/Latino Stud
ies has exploded in the last three years, mim
icking demographic trends and their implica
tions for the Omaha metropolitan area and
the state as a whole," said Lourdes Gouveia,
director of the UNO Office of Latino/Latin
American Studies, in a Dec. 22 statement.
Nebraska experienced the largest Latino
population growth of all the Great Plains
states, and about one-third of Nebraska's
Latino population lives in Omaha, she said.
"Businesses, social agencies, policy mak
ers, scholars and students are eager to tap
into the knowledge base and training oppor
tunities at UNO," she said.
The new major was the first accomplish
ment by the office since its start last Septem-

ber, said Jonathan Benjamin-Alvarado, as
sistant director of the program and a politi
cal science professor at UNO.
The office was created after the existing
program at UNO received a $1 million fed
eral grant from the Department of Educa
tion, sponsored by Nebraska Sen. Chuck
Hagel.
Benjamin-Alvarado said the program
worked on the creation of the new office and
major for over a year.
The NU Board of Regents approved the
program's proposal of the major at its Dec.
13 meeting. And with the funding, the office
will continue for four years before the office
will seek additional funds.
The program, created in 1996, consisted
only of an interdisciplinary minor in Chi
cano/a Latino/a Studies offered by the UNO
College of Arts and Sciences.
The new major, under the same college,
brings together issues related to both Lati
nos in Nebraska and in Latin America, Ben
jamin-Alvarado said.
The major will require students to com
plete two introductory interdisciplinary sur
vey courses one in Chicano/Latino Studies
and one in Latin American studies. Students
also will take 21 hours of additional Lati
no/Latin American studies courses, 16 hours
of Spanish, complete three hours of research
and take a senior-level capstone course.
Existing UNO faculty members will teach

the Latino/Latin American Studies courses.
Students who pursue the major will be
able to work with Latinos in the community
through outreach programs developed by
the office.
With growing immigration numbers, and
President George W. Bush's proposed im
migration reform, the issue of Latinos in Ne
braska and across the United States needs to
be addressed, Benjamin-Alvarado said.
"Oftentimes, immigration is looked at as
a problem," he said. "But it can also be
looked at as an opportunity for students and
the community."
Some examples, he said, are in public
health and in education. Latinos will contin
ue to immigrate to the United States and in
dividuals will need to better relate to that
population, Benjamin-Alvarado said.
At this point, most of the Latino/Latin
American studies students are double ma
jors, he said, including majors in teaching,
business and law.
The office is already working on a com
munity exchange program with students and
families in Mexico and other Latin Ameri
can countries, he said.
Miguel Carranza, University of Nebras
ka-Lincoln associate professor of sociology
and ethnic studies and coordinator for Lati
no and Latin American studies at UNL, said
UNO's new major of Latino/Latin Ameri
can studies was a good merger of fields.

He said he didn't think UNL would have
to compete with the new program and
major.
"We could use this as an opportunity to
collaborate research," Carranza said.
Also, instead of concentrating just on
Latin American studies, as UNL's offered
interdisciplinary major does, UNO's new
major incorporates the U.S.-Latino experi
ence.
UNL and UNO have been cooperating in
the creation of the Latino/Latin American
Studies major. UNO students can take class
es at UNL for the major and UNL students
can take classes at UNO.
But Carranza said UNL was in the
process of developing its own major, which
would be in the ethnic studies department.
Students in the major would be able to have
a concentration in Latin American studies,
African studies or Native American studies.
He said UNL's new major would not af
fect the existing interdisciplinary major pro
gram or the UNL-UNO cooperation.
Benjamin-Alvarado said new majors
don't take away from interdisciplinary
major programs, but rather bring students
together.
Although only about a dozen students have
declared an interest in the new major at UNO,
Benjamin-Alvarado said he hoped interest
would grow after the major gets going next
fall.
