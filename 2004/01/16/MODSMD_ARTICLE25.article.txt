# New California budget cuts will hit low-income students
## 
### RORY VALLIS THE CALIFORNIA AGGIE 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS â€”Students
struggling to cover the recently in
creased tuition next year can expect
less help from financial aid. Along
with proposing an increase in stu
dent fees, Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's new budget
would nearly halve financial aid rev
enues taken from those fees.
Currently, 33 percent of student
fees are returned to financial aid, but
the proposal would reduce that
number to 20 percent. University of
ficials are concerned that the pro
posal could threaten students' abili
ty to pay the full cost of tuition and
campus-based miscellaneous fees.
University of California Presi
dent Robert Dynes said of the UC in
a press release that "these cuts

would have a very serious impact on
its tradition of providing a top-qual
ity, accessible, affordable education
for Californians."
In an e-mail statement, UC
Davis Chancellor Larry Vander
hoef called the outreach cut "the
most hurtful of all budget cuts" be
cause the university would lose its
ability to "keep elementary school
students on track toward at least
having the option of attending a
four-year university."
"That program likely will be ter
minated," wrote Vanderhoef, "and
so middle-income families will again
have a larger burden than many of
them are able to bare [sic]."
The governor's budget acknowl
edged the possibility that decreases
in enrollment and financial aid may
burden families and suggested that
students could find recourse in the

less expensive California Communi
ty College System.
Anticipating this recourse, the
budget would allot the community
college system an additional $500
million in 2004-2005 as "extra
growth funding to maintain access
and accommodate expected new
freshman enrollment."
Students will still be able to
apply for federal Pell Grants and
state-funded Cal Grants. Howev
er, the new budget reduces the
maximum allowable income for
Cal Grant eligibility by 10 percent.
Further, Cal Grant awards would
be uncoupled from tuition, so they
would not take into account the re
cent fee increases. Vanderhoef
said low-income students will get
the highest priority for extra finan
cial aid money that might become
available.
