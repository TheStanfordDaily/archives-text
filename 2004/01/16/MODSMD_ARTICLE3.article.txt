# Supercharged Cal to test women
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 women's basketball team seeks to
continue its 6-0 Pac 10 winning streak with a vic
tory tonight at the Golden Bears' home court.
With a 13-2 overall record, the Cardinal faces a
Cal team that has struggled so far this season,
finishing a lackluster 2-4 in conference play.
The undefeated Cardinal is coming off back
to-back wins against Arizona State and Arizona
last weekend. Cal lost to both of those teams in
close games at Haas Pavilion. A victory over
Stanford would be huge for the barely-there
Bears.
"They're going to try to take advantage," said
senior forward Nicole Powell. "They feel like
they have a legitimate shot at beating us. I think
they're going to come out and give it everything
they have."
Even with Cal's losses last weekend, the Car
dinal is ready for a tough game. The Bears can be
a physical team, a trait that has caused Stanford
trouble in the past.
"They play really hard. They take it to you,"

said junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu. "Last
year, we barely won there. We can't underesti
mate them and they're much improved from last
year as well."
Powell has been named Pac 10 Women's Bas
ketball Player of the Week for the second time
this season her seventh award while at Stan
ford. She attributed her selection to strong team
efforts against the Sun Devils and Wildcats last
weekend.
"Our team had a great weekend," Powell
said. "Arizona State was a tough one, but we
pulled it out. And especially the Arizona game,
they were a top 25 team. It was a total team ef
fort. I think that's what it came down to."
The Cardinal is by far the preeminent Pac 10
team this season. It leads the conference in free
throw percentage (.812), 3-point field goals
(116) and defensive rebounds (407). Stanford
currently trails Cal in field goal percentage, with
the Cardinal shooting .458 to Cal's .463.
The perimeter game is shaping up to be one of
Stanford's greatest strengths. Even though she
had a slow start, Kimyacioglu leads the confer
ence in 3-pointers with 32 for the season.

"At the beginning of the year, Susan [Bor
chardt] was lighting it up and carrying us on the
perimeter. And then Nicole and Kelly [Sumins
ki] really got going too. Krista [Rappahansj's
been going to whole season," Kimyacioglu said.
"I'm one of the last ones to join the party, but
I'm still happy to be there."
Sophomore guard Rappahan has been shoot
ing strong this year. She leads the team in field
goal percentage (.585) and 3-point field goal
percentage (.618).
Kimyacioglu compared shooting three point
ers in women's basketball with dunks by men.
Since women take the ball to the rim less often,
many of the most exciting shots come from the
outside.
"Three's are really big to get the crowd going
in a women's game," she said.
Powell, Kimyacioglu and junior guard Kelley
Suminski are all averaging double digits in Pac 10
scoring, with Powell averaging 22.3 points per game.
