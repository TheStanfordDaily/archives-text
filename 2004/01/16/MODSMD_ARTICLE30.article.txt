# Rookie Newlin playing well
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
If it's possible to make a seamless transition from a small high
school in Wyoming to a perennially top-10 ranked Division I college
program, Kristen Newlin might just be doing it.
When the wiry 6-foot-5 forward / center arrived at the Farm, she
was the only recruited freshman to join the No. 7 Stanford women's
basketball team (13-2, 6-0 Pacific 10) (Markisha Coleman would
later walk on) and at possibly its deepest position.
With juniors Azella Perryman, T'Nae Thiel and Chelsea Trotter
having already established themselves as effective post players, one
would expect Newlin to be fighting for limited minutes.
Injuries, however, changed everything. Both Perryman and Thiel
missed significant time at the beginning of the season with foot in
juries, leaving a spot open in the rotation for Newlin and she
made the most of it.
Not only did Newlin get minutes, she started her very first game
in a Cardinal uniform. And while the freshman did not remain in the
starting lineup, she certainly made an impression and now aver
ages over 20 minutes per game.
In 15 games, Newlin is putting up more than solid numbers 7.4
ppg and 6.4 rpg (seventh best in the Pac-10).
Newlin's impact has been all the more impressive because of the
extreme difference in level of competition between what she experi
enced in high school. She was one of only three girls in Wyoming to
go on to play Division I ball.
"Yeah, there really wasn't much [competition]," Newlin said.
"But if I tried hard enough, I could always find it."
In order to develop her skills, Newlin would play one-on-one with
her coach or play against boys. In the summers, she traveled with a
Colorado AAU team (Wyoming didn't have one).
Finding competition was not Newlin's only challenge in high
school. Between her junior and senior seasons Newlin tore her ACL,
an injury that kept her out of action for five months.
The knee injury didn't stop colleges from calling though. In addi
tion to Stanford, basketball powerhouses Tennessee, Texas, Arizona
State and lowa State showed interest in Newlin.
It was Newlin's visit to Stanford that made up her mind.
"It was a gut feeling," she said. "My visit just struck me. I was
hooked."
Since her arrival to the Farm, Newlin's offensive and rebounding
statistics have been solid, but what might be even more impressive is
her work on the defensive end of the floor. By her own confession,
defense wasn't Newlin's main priority in high school.
"I admit, I didn't play much defense in high school. I was five inch
es taller than everyone else."
However, things are starting to change and they are changing
quickly. Newlin has become Stanford's shot-blocking specialist, av
eraging 2.13 per game third highest in the Pac-10. In an early sea
son victory over Boston, Newlin tied Stanford's single-game block
record with six. A month later, she made the record her own by swat
ting down eight shots in Stanford's victory over Washington State.
"She's a really nice player," said WSU head coach Sherri Murrell
after her team's loss. "She moves really well for her size and her shot
blocking is great."
Not only does her shot-blocking ability give opponents fits, but it
fires up her teammates as well.
Newlin's most memorable moment on the court was a huge block
in Stanford's win over Washington. With the Huskies making a run,

their star-guard Giuliana Mendiola had a baseline layup, but Newlin
came from behind and essentially spiked the ball out of her hands,
stopping Washington momentum.
"It gets the team going and if it's a home floor it gets the crowd
going," Newlin said. "It's something I've always enjoyed doing."
While Newlin has only 15 games under her belt, she is playing like
a seasoned veteran. And although it may be somewhat unexpected,
it certainly isn't unwelcome. In her short time as a Cardinal, she has
already shown she has what it takes to help the team make a run at a
National Championship come March.

tion to Stanford, basketball powerhouses Tennessee, Texas, Arizona
State and lowa State showed interest in Newlin.
It was Newlin's visit to Stanford that made up her mind.
"It was a gut feeling," she said. "My visit just struck me. I was
hooked."
Since her arrival to the Farm, Newlin's offensive and rebounding
statistics have been solid, but what might be even more impressive is
her work on the defensive end of the floor. By her own confession,
defense wasn't Newlin's main priority in high school.
"I admit, I didn't play much defense in high school. I was five inch
es taller than everyone else."
However, things are starting to change and they are changing
quickly. Newlin has become Stanford's shot-blocking specialist, av
eraging 2.13 per game third highest in the Pac-10. In an early sea
son victory over Boston, Newlin tied Stanford's single-game block
record with six. A month later, she made the record her own by swat
ting down eight shots in Stanford's victory over Washington State.
"She's a really nice player," said WSU head coach Sherri Murrell
after her team's loss. "She moves really well for her size and her shot
blocking is great."
Not only does her shot-blocking ability give opponents fits, but it
fires up her teammates as well.
Newlin's most memorable moment on the court was a huge block
in Stanford's win over Washington. With the Huskies making a run,

their star-guard Giuliana Mendiola had a baseline layup, but Newlin
came from behind and essentially spiked the ball out of her hands,
stopping Washington momentum.
"It gets the team going and if it's a home floor it gets the crowd
going," Newlin said. "It's something I've always enjoyed doing."
While Newlin has only 15 games under her belt, she is playing like
a seasoned veteran. And although it may be somewhat unexpected,
it certainly isn't unwelcome. In her short time as a Cardinal, she has
already shown she has what it takes to help the team make a run at a
National Championship come March.
