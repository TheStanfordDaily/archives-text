RETURN OF THE KING
4 stars
If you haven't seen it, what are
you waiting for? Only a half hour
longer than the first two of the trilogy,
the film is constantly propelling itself
forward, juggling two, three or more
story lines.
Even if you haven't seen the first
two and giggle at the sound of the
names "Aragon" and "Legolas," go
see this movie! You want to catch it
on the big screen.
The most heartwrenching mo
ment of the film comes when Frodo
abandons his byal friend Sam on the
steps of Cirith Ungol. "Return" is
packed with this brand of old-school,
"we lucky few, we band of brothers"
heroism. Viewers have spent so
much time with these characters, and
they realize how high the stakes are,
so these moments generally work
perfectly.
As with the novel, "The Return of
the Kings" isn't really a film that
stands on its own, but rather the cli
mactic three-and-a-half hours of "The
Lord of the Rings," bringing all the
seeds planted in the first two films to
fruition. Now we can appreciate the
entirety of Jackson's achievement,
which is to create/adapt an epic
that is truly greater than the sum of its
part, an adventure that will not soon
be forgotten.
