# This 'Polly' ain't pretty
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
Does Frankenstein turn you on? Do you fan
tasize about creatures composed of the used,
dead parts of others, crudely spliced together
and forced into life? If so, you'll love "Along
Came Polly."
It's got the gross-out gags from "There's
Something About Mary." The lovably stodgy

main character from "Meet the Parents."
The free-spirited gal with the heart of gold
from, well, just about every romantic come
dy. There's nothing wrong with these ele
ments in principle. They just worked better
before they were dead and rotting.
Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) is a neurotic
risk analyst for insurance companies,
pathologically afraid of food contamination
and open flames. At the beginning of the
film, he's married to Lisa (Debra Messing),
but things quickly and predictably go awry.
He's left to navigate the singles scene with
all of the insecurity of an early Woody
Allen, but none of the humor. His idea of a

snappy comeback to a Cuban guy: "Me no estas
too good."
Stiller seems aware that he's digging up old
bones in this performance. The woeful why-me
face he used to such effect in "Meet the Parents"
has acquired bitterness here, as though Stiller is
actually as humiliated as his character by the
film's awkward, disgusting situations.
The result: When Reuben gets his face
smeared up against a pair of sweaty man-breasts,

or his ear tweaked by the pee-stained fingers of
his boss (an appropriately repulsive Alec Bald
win), we cringe rather than laugh.
Then along comes Polly Prince (Jennifer
Aniston). She enjoys extreme sports, salsa danc
ing, travel and messy, hip clothing. Add a clut
tered apartment and a stupid, adorable pet, and
you have a leading lady entirely composed of the
discarded parts of her predecessors. No wonder

she and Reuben have no chemistry. It's hard to
get that special spark from reanimated flesh.
Still, they try. They go on a few awkward
dates, which put Reuben's health and self-re
spect in peril in a variety of unfunny ways. The
aforementioned chest-wipe is pretty much par
for the course.
Add to the mix an oafish best friend — Philip
Seymour Hoffman at his most porcine — and a
subplot about a rich and danger-loving client

whose risks Reuben must assess, and you get a
film whose first half makes you viscerally dread
its second. The surprise: This dread is, at least
partially, unwarranted.
"Along Came Polly" does get better. That's
not to say it becomes good it never loses its
dependence on romantic comedy cliche. But it
starts, unbelievably, to have moments. Reuben
begins to show some spine, and the results are
rather appealing. He delivers a line about throw
pillows that actually made me laugh out loud.
And, in a climactic scene whose details it would
be unfair to divulge, Hoffman remembers that
he's funny.
However, the film can't completely redeem it
self. Though his relationship with Polly does
change Reuben for the better, it doesn't draw on
any latent good qualities, doesn't convince us
that he's really been worth our time. As my date
put it, he just becomes "marginally less lame."
And Aniston, though she seems to be valiantly
trying, can't really raise Polly from the dead.
The casting choice is a confusing one anyway
Aniston seems far better suited to another Hol
lywood cliche the girl next door.
If you're thinking of seeing "Along Came
Polly," allow me to suggest an alternative. Rent
"There's Something About Mary." Rent "Meet
the Parents." Rent "Annie Hall." Then spend
two hours switching back and forth between the
three. At least that way you can make your own
monster.
