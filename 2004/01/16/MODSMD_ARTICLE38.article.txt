# 'Big Fish'; flop, flop
## 
### CAROLYN CHEN 
Tim Burton's "Big Fish" opens with a
voiceover in a mildly awkward Southern
accent, "There are some fish that can't
be easily caught." Enter a big fish it's
swimming away from the camera. Then
the words "Big Fish" appear in the cen
ter of the screen. They're big.
Fortune cookies are subtler than this.
"Big Fish" is not a terrible movie, but
it comes as a disappointment from the
guy who brought us the beautiful gothic
meets-suburbia fairytale "Edward Scis
sorhands" (1990) and the deliciously
creepy, animated "The Nightmare be
fore Christmas" (1993). It's like he went
crazy and took Oprah pills or some
thing. Seriously, the story line (learn
a lesson from a guy before he
dies!) parallels that of "Tuesdays
with Morrie."

The big fish of the title Edward
Bloom (played by Albert Finney in
his old age, and by Ewan McGregor
as a young man) tells tall tales that his
son Will (Billy Crudup) does not ap-

predate. Will works as a fact-checker. We suspect he is emotionally stilted,
because he wears too many collared shirts and he's never lit in happy colors.
The story begins when the unhappy son returns to find the truth about his
dying father, with whom he hasn't spoken in years. Edward retells the stories
of his life, from his Tom-Sawyer-like Alabama childhood through his ad
ventures as a traveling salesman, which are all shown in fabulous colors. In
short, dying father teaches unhappy son a lesson he will never forget.

This premise doesn't have to
be inherently cringe-inducing: I'm to
tally in favor of fathers and sons and
communication in America. However,
the movie is intent on dispensing tablets
of folksy wisdom in a Southern drawl:
"The biggest fish get that way by never
getting caught" and "You're not too big
this town is just too small for you."
There are too many moments where a
character says something that's sup
posed to be pithy and the string orches
tra immediately starts swelling, and in
stead of tearing up as you'd like to, you
think, manipulative bastards, because
there was no emotional set-up to the
poignant moment â€” there's just the
orchestra shouting, "Poignant moment!
Cry!"
Many of Edward's adventures,
shown in flashbacks, involve him
meeting and freeing a freak: a giant,
a werewolf, conjoined twins, Steve
Buscemi. This is cruel. Tim Burton,
you are better than this.
The film does have beautiful

moments. Burton excels at devising
things that are just fun to look at: There's a web of suspended lights over a
small southern town, a clothesline laden with dangling shoes and a bed built
to contain an unnatural growth spurt, which illustrates Burton's talent for
odd contraptions. A baby pops out and zooms through a hospital, like a fish.
An airplane slides through the dark night sky, like a fish. The big fat CGI cat
fish at the beginning looks incredibly huggable. So does Albert Finney. Al-

The movie too often feels
like a variety show...
