# 'Big Fish'; flop, flop
## 
### CAROLYN CHEN 
Tim Burton's "Big Fish" opens with a
voiceover in a mildly awkward Southern
accent, "There are some fish that can't
be easily caught." Enter a big fish it's
swimming away from the camera. Then
the words "Big Fish" appear in the cen
ter of the screen. They're big.
Fortune cookies are subtler than this.
"Big Fish" is not a terrible movie, but
it comes as a disappointment from the
guy who brought us the beautiful gothic
meets-suburbia fairytale "Edward Scis
sorhands" (1990) and the deliciously
creepy, animated "The Nightmare be
fore Christmas" (1993). It's like he went
crazy and took Oprah pills or some
thing. Seriously, the story line (learn
a lesson from a guy before he
dies!) parallels that of "Tuesdays
with Morrie."

The big fish of the title Edward
Bloom (played by Albert Finney in
his old age, and by Ewan McGregor
as a young man) tells tall tales that his
son Will (Billy Crudup) does not ap-

predate. Will works as a fact-checker. We suspect he is emotionally stilted,
because he wears too many collared shirts and he's never lit in happy colors.
The story begins when the unhappy son returns to find the truth about his
dying father, with whom he hasn't spoken in years. Edward retells the stories
of his life, from his Tom-Sawyer-like Alabama childhood through his ad
ventures as a traveling salesman, which are all shown in fabulous colors. In
short, dying father teaches unhappy son a lesson he will never forget.

This premise doesn't have to
be inherently cringe-inducing: I'm to
tally in favor of fathers and sons and
communication in America. However,
the movie is intent on dispensing tablets
of folksy wisdom in a Southern drawl:
"The biggest fish get that way by never
getting caught" and "You're not too big
this town is just too small for you."
There are too many moments where a
character says something that's sup
posed to be pithy and the string orches
tra immediately starts swelling, and in
stead of tearing up as you'd like to, you
think, manipulative bastards, because
there was no emotional set-up to the
poignant moment — there's just the
orchestra shouting, "Poignant moment!
Cry!"
Many of Edward's adventures,
shown in flashbacks, involve him
meeting and freeing a freak: a giant,
a werewolf, conjoined twins, Steve
Buscemi. This is cruel. Tim Burton,
you are better than this.
The film does have beautiful

moments. Burton excels at devising
things that are just fun to look at: There's a web of suspended lights over a
small southern town, a clothesline laden with dangling shoes and a bed built
to contain an unnatural growth spurt, which illustrates Burton's talent for
odd contraptions. A baby pops out and zooms through a hospital, like a fish.
An airplane slides through the dark night sky, like a fish. The big fat CGI cat
fish at the beginning looks incredibly huggable. So does Albert Finney. Al-

The movie too often feels
like a variety show...

bert Finney pours a bottle of water over his head
at one point, one of the greater moments of the
film.
However, the movie too often feels like a vari
ety show as if "Forrest Gump" met a real Tim
Burton movie, stamped the life out of it and in
jected it with guest appearances by, like, every
movie that ever made money, ever: There's a car
chase, a short kung fu sequence that was just long
and irrelevant enough to offend me, a brushing
away of popcorn kernels frozen in the air (like the

bullets in "The Matrix"), anthropomorphized
trees (like whomping willow from "Harry Pot
ter"), a car stuck in a tree ("Harry Potter"), a ring
in a river ("Lord of the Rings"), large spiders in a
blue-lit forest ("Harry Potter" and "Lord of the
Rings"). Some of these objects are really pretty
and involve skillful special effects, but the ab
sence of originality ruins your sense of awe.
The cast includes a lot of interesting actors
who don't get a whole lot to do. Ewan McGregor,
as the young Bloom, looks like he's enjoying him
self, as does Albert Finney, the dying Bloom. As
a witch and another mysterious woman in
Bloom's life, Helena Bonham Carter manages
some of the film's only moments of psychological
depth (but I always think she has psychological
depth, maybe because I always think she looks
kind of disturbed). As Bloom's wife Sandra, Jes

sica Lange (who's won two Academy Awards),
does a good job of looking gratefully at her hus
band. Alison Lohman, as the young Sandra, does
a good job of looking like Jessica Lange. Steve
Buscemi, a lost poet, looks like Steve Buscemi.
Poor guy.
Ultimately, "Big Fish" is about the transfor
mative power of storytelling. The unhappy fact
checker learns that the truth about his father is
his stories. Unfortunately, the movie can't stop
poking you in the eye with this moral, and it feels
too much like Tim Burton trying to justify his
own weirdness. "Big Fish" offers plenty of small
moments to make you happy, but they don't gel.

crazy and took Oprah pills or some
thing. Seriously, the story line (learn
a lesson from a guy before he
dies!) parallels that of "Tuesdays
with Morrie."

The big fish of the title Edward
Bloom (played by Albert Finney in
his old age, and by Ewan McGregor
as a young man) tells tall tales that his
son Will (Billy Crudup) does not ap-

predate. Will works as a fact-checker. We suspect he is emotionally stilted,
because he wears too many collared shirts and he's never lit in happy colors.
The story begins when the unhappy son returns to find the truth about his
dying father, with whom he hasn't spoken in years. Edward retells the stories
of his life, from his Tom-Sawyer-like Alabama childhood through his ad
ventures as a traveling salesman, which are all shown in fabulous colors. In
short, dying father teaches unhappy son a lesson he will never forget.

This premise doesn't have to
be inherently cringe-inducing: I'm to
tally in favor of fathers and sons and
communication in America. However,
the movie is intent on dispensing tablets
of folksy wisdom in a Southern drawl:
"The biggest fish get that way by never
getting caught" and "You're not too big
this town is just too small for you."
There are too many moments where a
character says something that's sup
posed to be pithy and the string orches
tra immediately starts swelling, and in
stead of tearing up as you'd like to, you
think, manipulative bastards, because
there was no emotional set-up to the
poignant moment — there's just the
orchestra shouting, "Poignant moment!
Cry!"
Many of Edward's adventures,
shown in flashbacks, involve him
meeting and freeing a freak: a giant,
a werewolf, conjoined twins, Steve
Buscemi. This is cruel. Tim Burton,
you are better than this.
The film does have beautiful

moments. Burton excels at devising
things that are just fun to look at: There's a web of suspended lights over a
small southern town, a clothesline laden with dangling shoes and a bed built
to contain an unnatural growth spurt, which illustrates Burton's talent for
odd contraptions. A baby pops out and zooms through a hospital, like a fish.
An airplane slides through the dark night sky, like a fish. The big fat CGI cat
fish at the beginning looks incredibly huggable. So does Albert Finney. Al-

The movie too often feels
like a variety show...

bert Finney pours a bottle of water over his head
at one point, one of the greater moments of the
film.
However, the movie too often feels like a vari
ety show as if "Forrest Gump" met a real Tim
Burton movie, stamped the life out of it and in
jected it with guest appearances by, like, every
movie that ever made money, ever: There's a car
chase, a short kung fu sequence that was just long
and irrelevant enough to offend me, a brushing
away of popcorn kernels frozen in the air (like the

bullets in "The Matrix"), anthropomorphized
trees (like whomping willow from "Harry Pot
ter"), a car stuck in a tree ("Harry Potter"), a ring
in a river ("Lord of the Rings"), large spiders in a
blue-lit forest ("Harry Potter" and "Lord of the
Rings"). Some of these objects are really pretty
and involve skillful special effects, but the ab
sence of originality ruins your sense of awe.
The cast includes a lot of interesting actors
who don't get a whole lot to do. Ewan McGregor,
as the young Bloom, looks like he's enjoying him
self, as does Albert Finney, the dying Bloom. As
a witch and another mysterious woman in
Bloom's life, Helena Bonham Carter manages
some of the film's only moments of psychological
depth (but I always think she has psychological
depth, maybe because I always think she looks
kind of disturbed). As Bloom's wife Sandra, Jes

sica Lange (who's won two Academy Awards),
does a good job of looking gratefully at her hus
band. Alison Lohman, as the young Sandra, does
a good job of looking like Jessica Lange. Steve
Buscemi, a lost poet, looks like Steve Buscemi.
Poor guy.
Ultimately, "Big Fish" is about the transfor
mative power of storytelling. The unhappy fact
checker learns that the truth about his father is
his stories. Unfortunately, the movie can't stop
poking you in the eye with this moral, and it feels
too much like Tim Burton trying to justify his
own weirdness. "Big Fish" offers plenty of small
moments to make you happy, but they don't gel.
Tim Burton's "Big Fish" opens with a
voiceover in a mildly awkward Southern
accent, "There are some fish that can't
be easily caught." Enter a big fish it's
swimming away from the camera. Then
the words "Big Fish" appear in the cen
ter of the screen. They're big.
Fortune cookies are subtler than this.
"Big Fish" is not a terrible movie, but
it comes as a disappointment from the
guy who brought us the beautiful gothic
meets-suburbia fairytale "Edward Scis
sorhands" (1990) and the deliciously
creepy, animated "The Nightmare be
fore Christmas" (1993). It's like he went
crazy and took Oprah pills or some
thing. Seriously, the story line (learn
a lesson from a guy before he
dies!) parallels that of "Tuesdays
