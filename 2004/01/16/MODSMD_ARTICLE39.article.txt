# 'La Boheme' goes through the motions
## 
### HART GILULA 
When times are tough,
no less than 25 perfor
mances of Puccini's clas
sic score, perhaps to
counter the smaller box
office draws of San Fran
cisco Opera's more eclec
tic offerings "The
Mother of Us All," "The
Cunning Little Vixen"
and "Doktor Faust".
This revival of Mark
Lamos's production
stands well in the shadow
of Baz Luhrmann's Bo
hemian extravaganza.
Luhrmann's "La Bo
heme" (his name su
percedes Puccini's on the
marquee) premiered in
San Francisco last year
and has since gone to
Broadway and spawned
touring productions. In
terestingly enough,
Lamos' production pre
miered at the Orpheum
Theatre during the War
Memorial's renovation, a
conceit not unlike
Luhrmann's rotating cast
performed in a tradition
al, non-operatic theater.
In his production,
Luhrmann's vision is the
star of the show. Puccini's
music is nice background,
too. But back in the War
Memorial, Puccini has re

"La Boheme" balances the budget. Budget balancing has brought us

gained the spotlight. Staging Boheme is somewhat of a liability, though: It does not simply per
form itself. SF Opera's Music Director, Donald Runnicles conducted solidly, though he ap
proached the performance as if he was going through the motions with none of the exuber
ance he displayed conducting "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," for example.
The music is classic and any true opera fan has seen the opera many times (this was my

fifth) but it requires a strong, well-balanced cast that can build on the opera's enormous rep
utation, not an ensemble that fades into the background of the work's canonicity.
Indeed, the interpersonal dynamics of the young Bohemians strangely lack the requisite

spark. Also with
one exception, the
voices fail to deliv
er a proper singing
of the score. Vin
son Cole sings
Rodolfo with
forced vocal pro
duction, often lag
ging behind the
beat while his
voice catches up
with the music.
Marc e 11 o ,
meanwhile, usual
ly plays backup to
Rodolfo, the tenor
and star of the
show. Baritone
Mariusz Kwiecien,
a graduate of the
Met Young Artist
program, possess
es the most unique
and robust voice of
the evening. Too
bad Puccini didn't
write Marcello an
aria.
O1 g a
Guryakova, mean
while, sings Mimi
with a pleasant
voice but muddled
diction. Musetta's
second act aria,
"Quando men' vo"
is usually a show-

stopper, but Dina Kuznetsova's performance failed to elicit any applause.
While this production and cast serve as a solid introduction to the opera for neophytes, it falls
short of "La Boheme" returns in June with a new cast, and hopefully some new artistic inspira
tion.
