# 'House' not worth its weight in sand
## 
### PAUL NAVARRO ANDY MOON 
Although Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley deliver convincing performances, even great
acting can't turn a decent script into a masterpiece. Based on the best-selling novel by Andre

Dubus 111, "House of Sand and Fog" explores the lives of a
broken woman and an Iranian-American immigrant family
through their struggle over a house. On the one hand is
Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a woman who lacks a supportive
family while battling addiction and recovering from a failed
marriage. On the other hand is Massoud Amir Behrani
(Ben Kingsley), a former colonel in the Iranian army who is
forced to work several menial jobs in order to support his
family. Both characters are well developed, with detailed
backgrounds that add a depth to each of their personalities.
Kathy inherited the house from her father, who had
worked for years to raise the money to purchase it. Howev
er, in her desperate state she failed to open her mail, and was
unaware of the eviction notices that were piling at her front
door. It turns out that the county wrongfully evicted her, but
the mistake was not discovered until after Mr. Behrani had
already purchased and moved into the house. Behrani
planned sell the house immediately and turn a huge profit;
it was exactly what he needed to allow him to reach the bet-

ter life he had always longed for in America. At first, Behrani has no sympathy for Kathy, and
Kathy does not understand Behrani's apparent greed. However, she is persistent in her quest for
the house, and the struggle that ensues leads to a highly unexpected climax that is both surpris

ing and unlikely.
"House of Sand and Fog" features several impressive performances, notably Ben Kingsley's
emotional portrayal of a misunderstood and alienated immigrant trying to make it in America.
Jennifer Connelly reprises a familiar role as a lost and tortured soul looking for direction when

her home, the one certain thing in her life, is taken away
from her. Also, Shohreh Aghidashloo, who plays Behrani's
wife, contributes beautifully to the film as a believable and
compassionate character instilled with a fear of her past.
Unfortunately, Ron Eldard's role as Kathy's lover, Lester, is
choppy and I often found myself wondering why he was
doing what he was doing.
My major complaint is that the "house" theme was
pushed way past its logical limit; I felt myself wondering
what the heck the big deal was halfway through the movie.
The breathtaking transition between scenes of marvelous
panoramas surrounding the house felt more appropriate for
a nature channel than for this movie. Overall, the effort that
went into trying to build mystique and awe about the house
was to no avail; I was much more captivated by the charac
ters' past and the way it influenced their actions.
Though the film relies on highly improbable un
derpinnings, it manages to do so without the cliche Holly
wood scripting that is all too common in blockbuster movies.

While the movie did have far too many loose ends left untied, the finish felt entirely fresh com
pared to the cheesy endings of other similarly dramatic movies (Matrix: Revolutions?). "House
of Sand and Fog" has a few issues, but is still definitely worth a look.
