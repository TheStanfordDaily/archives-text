# INTERMISSION THE POLYPHONIC SPREE
## 
### JULIAN WASS RYAN SANDS STAFF WRITERS 
Imagine for a minute that Phil Spector,
renowned record producer, suspected mur
derer and confirmed lunatic had 25 secret
love children. Imagine further that these
mini-Spectors were all raised inside a big pas
tel colored house filled with soft pillows and
paintings of baby animals. The only TV show
they were allowed to watch was Sesame
Street and the only record they had was
"Here Comes the Sun." Then pretend for a
minute that when they were of age, they were
let loose into the world and they started a
band. If you can imagine all this, you have
some idea of what the Polyphonic Spree
sounds like.
Led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of the
90's alt-rock group Tripping Daisy, The Spree
have been sharing their sunshine-orchestral
pop with the world for nearly four years. To
hear the group on record harkens similar
bands such as the Flaming Lips, My Morning
Jacket or Grandaddy. Seeing the Spree live is
a truly unique experience; it becomes evident
that, unlike the previously named groups, the
Polyphonic Spree's sound comes not from
overdubs and studio wizadry, but from good
old fashioned numbers. Onstage, all in
matching white robes with colored trim at the
bottom, the Spree features not only tradition
al rock instrumentation, but also a floutist, a
horn section, a string section, three key
boardists, two percussionists, a theremin
player and a nine piece chorus. In the middle
of this madness is vocalist Delaughter.
We spoke with chorus member Michael
Turner, who described DeLaughter as the
"visionary of the group." Turner has been
with the group since it's earlier days as a mere
10 piece, and shared with Intermission the
unique experience it is to be a piece of what
many have described as not a group, but a
"Happening."

INTERMISSION: So, how did you get into
the Polyphonic Spree?

TURNER: Well, the first show that I saw was
in April of 2001 and I was totally blown away,
so I started going to every show after that. I
had a good friend who knew Jennifer Jobe,
who's in the choir. And we got to be friends
at the show's I'd come to. After a while, she
noticed how enthusiastic I was about it and
she invited me to come to a rehearsal one
night. I got to meet Tim [DeLaughter] and he
said, "Just hang onto the mic all night and let
me hear how you sound." The next night I
was in the show.
INT: Do you have any say on what color goes
on the bottom of your robe?
TURNER: I think when they started, all
these robes were made and people just
grabbed a color that appealed to them, I
guess. You come in and if you're lucky
enough you get a choice, but it really doesn't
matter; I think I've had seven or eight differ
ent colors since I joined. My first one was pink
and huge.
INT: And what will you be wearing tonight?
TURNER: I think tonight I'll probably wear
ing the crimson red
INT: Can you tell us a little about rehearsals?
Even in bands with four members it's tough
to keep people focused, so I'm really curious
how yours work.
TURNER: For a working rehearsal, usually
the way it starts is that Tim will come in with
an idea of a song, something he's been work
ing on for a while, or maybe something that's
just come into his head, and he'll say," I have
an idea for this kind of sound, or these are the
basic chord structures I'm looking at, or this is
the basic melody or feeling," and he'll play
through it a few times on the guitar or piano
or whatever. And one by one, whenever

somebody hears a part for
their instrument

or starts to get a feeling, they'll join in and the
song builds from there. Once the musicians
have at least a working structure, the choir
comes in and we hear what's going on and
start writing vocal parts. And then rehearsals
from there are just like with any other band,
you play with the songs and you listen for
what works and what doesn't; you're trying to
have a good time, so you make it as open a
process as you can.
It's always fun to watch it happen, because
you start to see how the dynamics of our per
sonal relationships enter into the process of
making music and the way people take on dif
ferent roles in the rehearsal and writing
process. Different people catch on at differ
ent times and sometimes this song that later
ends up being a big rock song, maybe the first
instrument that caught on in the beginning
was the flute or the trombone, or maybe it
was the harp or a vocal aria. With that many
people, a song could go any way and that
process gets compounded 24 times.
INT: You mentioned you had a background
in music, and I've always been curious about
a band that's so large, is everyone's musical
background completely different?
TURNER: Absolutely. I mean you have
someone like our bass player who is a really
solid rock bass player, and then you think,
"Well, there's a harp up on stage —that guy's
not coming from a rock perspective." But it's
funny to see what you'd expect someone to
listen to based on what they played, and then
have someone like Ricky Rasura who plays
the harp and the bulk of what he listens to is
stadium rock. And then me, I don't listen to a
lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes
> the

Beatles. And that's about as cohesive as it
gets.

INT: How does it work out for the band play
ing live at venues with small stages? Do you
have to change the setup of each show?
TURNER: Yeah, the setup sometimes has to
change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while
you get a stage that's a little too big, or a little
too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and
we opened up for Flaming Lips and Radio
head and a bunch of great bands that day; and
I remember going out on stage feeling a little
bit overwhelmed by the size of it. The crowd
was so huge and you had all this energy com
ing at you, and you have the feeling, "Our
piano player is way over there and this guy's
way over there." Ideally, I think the more
room there is to play around and have fun,
when you're not worried about elbowing
somebody in the face and you can just swing
around; But, we'll fit anywhere we'll make
it work.
INT: You mentioned that the size of the band
expands and contract, so do you look to re
place an instrument if someone can't make it
on a tour?
TURNER: It's rare that someone can't come
for a certain tour. Usually the change hap
pens when somebody's been with the band
for a while and their life is starting to feel like
they need to be doing something else, or
whatever. Whenever somebody leaves,
whatever energy comes along in that absence
always seems to make things better. It's real
ly rare that anything comes along that makes
the experience worse. It's just something that
you have to adapt to, with people coming and
going from the band, with various sizes of
stages, with all the different moments in the
music, with the rehearsal process every
thing about it seems so mutable and full of
possibility. That's been one of the things that
has made me wanna stay with it through the

good times and the hard times, just knowing
that you never know what's going to happen to
morrow.
INT: You've done a lot of shows in England,
and toured Japan this past summer; What's the
reception of the band in other countries?
TURNER: Oh, it's awesome! All the traveling
we've had the opportunity to do in this band has
been so fascinating because you see the way dif
ferent cultures respond. The first time we went
over to the UK, to play in London, we hadn't
played outside of Texas and the way they were
responding to us was really different from the
response we had ever gotten over here. It seems
like with the entertainment in England, they're
looking for things off the beaten path or any
thing that seems unfamiliar but still has an ele
ment of being fun or innocent. It seems like
they're looking for something that they haven't
seen before, where in the United States people
are looking for something that they feel they al
ready understand. And then a year later to go
over to Japan, it's just like ten-fold over there.
We went over there and our first show
was playing to 30,000 people. At our first club
show in that part of the world let alone in
that country or city we had a huge outpour
ing of love from people who were crowded
around the club door when we came out and
then chased our van down the road when we
went back to the hotel. It was so welcoming and
I had to ask myself, 'Would you ever get that
with an American crowd?' They got so excited,

and I wanted to be excited with them; with the
English it was the same way, except maybe they
were a little bit drunker.

INT: Do you guys play in the daytime much?
TURNER: Yeah, I'd say we've been lucky enough to have a pretty fair spread of that. A lot of
our songs incorporate themes of sunshine and there's a very "sunny" vibe to all of it, and I think
it's neat to see the way a crowd of thousands of people reacts to 24 people belting out the word
"sun" in full harmony right at the moment on a rainy day when the clouds start to part and the
sun pours in that's happened a number of times, and it's very strange. It's a weird syn
chronicity that's been very inspiring. It's really beautiful in a different way from a crowd of peo
ple packed into a smoky club late at night where everybody feels a little seedy, and then this
band comes on and they don't seem like what you're used to seeing when you're feeling really
seedy, and there's an energy to it that's also really exciting. It's neat to see when the crowd's re
ally into it and we're really into to, and you have that synchronicity, whether it's inside or out
side, daytime or nighttime, like that 'love moment,' or the 'fun moment,' or the 'ah, I just be
came aware of something moment.' To take aside the record deals or the robes or 'when am I
gonna eat?' and to know that for years now I've been able to be a part of something where that
moment just happens over and again is encouraging to me and makes it all worth it.

INT: Do you think if logistics weren't an issue at all, like transportation or the size of the stage,
the band would be larger and keep expanding?
TURNER: Well, I don't think so, because if Tim and everybody else had been thinking of lo
gistics to begin with, I don't really think they would have put together a band of 25 people to try
and take out on the road. It's one of the greatest things about Tim is that we really don't care
that is not my job to worry about it. I mean look at us you get 25 of us, all playing different
instruments, throw 'em on a stage, put them in a bunch of white robes and have them jump
around and clap and sing songs about the sun, and you're touring internationally three years
later and have videos on MTV, and you have people all over the world saying, "what you do
matters to me." And I can do this every day of my life, it works out. Did that happen because
we were worrying about how we were gonna get paid? No, absolutely not. I think the possibili
ties with this band are pretty limitless right now. My dream with this band has already come to
be, to be doing what I'm doing right now.

"Okay, who's idea was it to go camping in these white robes?": The Polyphonic Spree is welcomed to the jungle

lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes
> the

Beatles. And that's about as cohesive as it
gets.

INT: How does it work out for the band play
ing live at venues with small stages? Do you
have to change the setup of each show?
TURNER: Yeah, the setup sometimes has to
change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while
you get a stage that's a little too big, or a little
too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and
we opened up for Flaming Lips and Radio
head and a bunch of great bands that day; and
I remember going out on stage feeling a little
bit overwhelmed by the size of it. The crowd
was so huge and you had all this energy com
ing at you, and you have the feeling, "Our
piano player is way over there and this guy's
way over there." Ideally, I think the more
room there is to play around and have fun,
when you're not worried about elbowing
somebody in the face and you can just swing
around; But, we'll fit anywhere we'll make
it work.
INT: You mentioned that the size of the band
expands and contract, so do you look to re
place an instrument if someone can't make it
on a tour?
TURNER: It's rare that someone can't come
for a certain tour. Usually the change hap
pens when somebody's been with the band
for a while and their life is starting to feel like
they need to be doing something else, or
whatever. Whenever somebody leaves,
whatever energy comes along in that absence
always seems to make things better. It's real
ly rare that anything comes along that makes
the experience worse. It's just something that
you have to adapt to, with people coming and
going from the band, with various sizes of
stages, with all the different moments in the
music, with the rehearsal process every
thing about it seems so mutable and full of
possibility. That's been one of the things that
has made me wanna stay with it through the

good times and the hard times, just knowing
that you never know what's going to happen to
morrow.
INT: You've done a lot of shows in England,
and toured Japan this past summer; What's the
reception of the band in other countries?
TURNER: Oh, it's awesome! All the traveling
we've had the opportunity to do in this band has
been so fascinating because you see the way dif
ferent cultures respond. The first time we went
over to the UK, to play in London, we hadn't
played outside of Texas and the way they were
responding to us was really different from the
response we had ever gotten over here. It seems
like with the entertainment in England, they're
looking for things off the beaten path or any
thing that seems unfamiliar but still has an ele
ment of being fun or innocent. It seems like
they're looking for something that they haven't
seen before, where in the United States people
are looking for something that they feel they al
ready understand. And then a year later to go
over to Japan, it's just like ten-fold over there.
We went over there and our first show
was playing to 30,000 people. At our first club
show in that part of the world let alone in
that country or city we had a huge outpour
ing of love from people who were crowded
around the club door when we came out and
then chased our van down the road when we
went back to the hotel. It was so welcoming and
I had to ask myself, 'Would you ever get that
with an American crowd?' They got so excited,

and I wanted to be excited with them; with the
English it was the same way, except maybe they
were a little bit drunker.

INT: Do you guys play in the daytime much?
TURNER: Yeah, I'd say we've been lucky enough to have a pretty fair spread of that. A lot of
our songs incorporate themes of sunshine and there's a very "sunny" vibe to all of it, and I think
it's neat to see the way a crowd of thousands of people reacts to 24 people belting out the word
"sun" in full harmony right at the moment on a rainy day when the clouds start to part and the
sun pours in that's happened a number of times, and it's very strange. It's a weird syn
chronicity that's been very inspiring. It's really beautiful in a different way from a crowd of peo
ple packed into a smoky club late at night where everybody feels a little seedy, and then this
band comes on and they don't seem like what you're used to seeing when you're feeling really
seedy, and there's an energy to it that's also really exciting. It's neat to see when the crowd's re
ally into it and we're really into to, and you have that synchronicity, whether it's inside or out
side, daytime or nighttime, like that 'love moment,' or the 'fun moment,' or the 'ah, I just be
came aware of something moment.' To take aside the record deals or the robes or 'when am I
gonna eat?' and to know that for years now I've been able to be a part of something where that
moment just happens over and again is encouraging to me and makes it all worth it.

INT: Do you think if logistics weren't an issue at all, like transportation or the size of the stage,
the band would be larger and keep expanding?
TURNER: Well, I don't think so, because if Tim and everybody else had been thinking of lo
gistics to begin with, I don't really think they would have put together a band of 25 people to try
and take out on the road. It's one of the greatest things about Tim is that we really don't care
that is not my job to worry about it. I mean look at us you get 25 of us, all playing different
instruments, throw 'em on a stage, put them in a bunch of white robes and have them jump
around and clap and sing songs about the sun, and you're touring internationally three years
later and have videos on MTV, and you have people all over the world saying, "what you do
matters to me." And I can do this every day of my life, it works out. Did that happen because
we were worrying about how we were gonna get paid? No, absolutely not. I think the possibili
ties with this band are pretty limitless right now. My dream with this band has already come to
be, to be doing what I'm doing right now.

"Okay, who's idea was it to go camping in these white robes?": The Polyphonic Spree is welcomed to the jungle

Imagine for a minute that Phil Spector,
renowned record producer, suspected mur
derer and confirmed lunatic had 25 secret
love children. Imagine further that these
mini-Spectors were all raised inside a big pas
tel colored house filled with soft pillows and
paintings of baby animals. The only TV show
they were allowed to watch was Sesame
Street and the only record they had was
"Here Comes the Sun." Then pretend for a
minute that when they were of age, they were
let loose into the world and they started a
band. If you can imagine all this, you have
some idea of what the Polyphonic Spree
sounds like.
Led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of the
90's alt-rock group Tripping Daisy, The Spree
have been sharing their sunshine-orchestral
pop with the world for nearly four years. To
hear the group on record harkens similar
bands such as the Flaming Lips, My Morning
Jacket or Grandaddy. Seeing the Spree live is
a truly unique experience; it becomes evident
that, unlike the previously named groups, the
Polyphonic Spree's sound comes not from
overdubs and studio wizadry, but from good
old fashioned numbers. Onstage, all in
matching white robes with colored trim at the
bottom, the Spree features not only tradition
al rock instrumentation, but also a floutist, a
horn section, a string section, three key
boardists, two percussionists, a theremin
player and a nine piece chorus. In the middle
of this madness is vocalist Delaughter.
We spoke with chorus member Michael
Turner, who described DeLaughter as the
"visionary of the group." Turner has been
with the group since it's earlier days as a mere
10 piece, and shared with Intermission the
unique experience it is to be a piece of what
many have described as not a group, but a
"Happening."

INTERMISSION: So, how did you get into
the Polyphonic Spree?

TURNER: Well, the first show that I saw was
in April of 2001 and I was totally blown away,
so I started going to every show after that. I
had a good friend who knew Jennifer Jobe,
who's in the choir. And we got to be friends
at the show's I'd come to. After a while, she
noticed how enthusiastic I was about it and
she invited me to come to a rehearsal one
night. I got to meet Tim [DeLaughter] and he
said, "Just hang onto the mic all night and let
me hear how you sound." The next night I
was in the show.
INT: Do you have any say on what color goes
on the bottom of your robe?
TURNER: I think when they started, all
these robes were made and people just
grabbed a color that appealed to them, I
guess. You come in and if you're lucky
enough you get a choice, but it really doesn't
matter; I think I've had seven or eight differ
ent colors since I joined. My first one was pink
and huge.
INT: And what will you be wearing tonight?
TURNER: I think tonight I'll probably wear
ing the crimson red
INT: Can you tell us a little about rehearsals?
Even in bands with four members it's tough
to keep people focused, so I'm really curious
how yours work.
TURNER: For a working rehearsal, usually
the way it starts is that Tim will come in with
an idea of a song, something he's been work
ing on for a while, or maybe something that's
just come into his head, and he'll say," I have
an idea for this kind of sound, or these are the
basic chord structures I'm looking at, or this is
the basic melody or feeling," and he'll play
through it a few times on the guitar or piano
or whatever. And one by one, whenever

somebody hears a part for
their instrument

or starts to get a feeling, they'll join in and the
song builds from there. Once the musicians
have at least a working structure, the choir
comes in and we hear what's going on and
start writing vocal parts. And then rehearsals
from there are just like with any other band,
you play with the songs and you listen for
what works and what doesn't; you're trying to
have a good time, so you make it as open a
process as you can.
It's always fun to watch it happen, because
you start to see how the dynamics of our per
sonal relationships enter into the process of
making music and the way people take on dif
ferent roles in the rehearsal and writing
process. Different people catch on at differ
ent times and sometimes this song that later
ends up being a big rock song, maybe the first
instrument that caught on in the beginning
was the flute or the trombone, or maybe it
was the harp or a vocal aria. With that many
people, a song could go any way and that
process gets compounded 24 times.
INT: You mentioned you had a background
in music, and I've always been curious about
a band that's so large, is everyone's musical
background completely different?
TURNER: Absolutely. I mean you have
someone like our bass player who is a really
solid rock bass player, and then you think,
"Well, there's a harp up on stage —that guy's
not coming from a rock perspective." But it's
funny to see what you'd expect someone to
listen to based on what they played, and then
have someone like Ricky Rasura who plays
the harp and the bulk of what he listens to is
stadium rock. And then me, I don't listen to a
lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes

change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while

too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and

gonna eat?' and to know that for years now I've been able to be a part of something where that
moment just happens over and again is encouraging to me and makes it all worth it.

INT: Do you think if logistics weren't an issue at all, like transportation or the size of the stage,
the band would be larger and keep expanding?
TURNER: Well, I don't think so, because if Tim and everybody else had been thinking of lo
gistics to begin with, I don't really think they would have put together a band of 25 people to try
and take out on the road. It's one of the greatest things about Tim is that we really don't care
that is not my job to worry about it. I mean look at us you get 25 of us, all playing different
instruments, throw 'em on a stage, put them in a bunch of white robes and have them jump
around and clap and sing songs about the sun, and you're touring internationally three years
later and have videos on MTV, and you have people all over the world saying, "what you do
matters to me." And I can do this every day of my life, it works out. Did that happen because
we were worrying about how we were gonna get paid? No, absolutely not. I think the possibili
ties with this band are pretty limitless right now. My dream with this band has already come to
be, to be doing what I'm doing right now.

"Okay, who's idea was it to go camping in these white robes?": The Polyphonic Spree is welcomed to the jungle

Imagine for a minute that Phil Spector,
renowned record producer, suspected mur
derer and confirmed lunatic had 25 secret
love children. Imagine further that these
mini-Spectors were all raised inside a big pas
tel colored house filled with soft pillows and
paintings of baby animals. The only TV show
they were allowed to watch was Sesame
Street and the only record they had was
"Here Comes the Sun." Then pretend for a
minute that when they were of age, they were
let loose into the world and they started a
band. If you can imagine all this, you have
some idea of what the Polyphonic Spree
sounds like.
Led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of the
90's alt-rock group Tripping Daisy, The Spree
have been sharing their sunshine-orchestral
pop with the world for nearly four years. To
hear the group on record harkens similar
bands such as the Flaming Lips, My Morning
Jacket or Grandaddy. Seeing the Spree live is
a truly unique experience; it becomes evident
that, unlike the previously named groups, the
Polyphonic Spree's sound comes not from
overdubs and studio wizadry, but from good
old fashioned numbers. Onstage, all in
matching white robes with colored trim at the
bottom, the Spree features not only tradition
al rock instrumentation, but also a floutist, a
horn section, a string section, three key
boardists, two percussionists, a theremin
player and a nine piece chorus. In the middle
of this madness is vocalist Delaughter.
We spoke with chorus member Michael
Turner, who described DeLaughter as the
"visionary of the group." Turner has been
with the group since it's earlier days as a mere
10 piece, and shared with Intermission the
unique experience it is to be a piece of what
many have described as not a group, but a
"Happening."

INTERMISSION: So, how did you get into
the Polyphonic Spree?

TURNER: Well, the first show that I saw was
in April of 2001 and I was totally blown away,
so I started going to every show after that. I
had a good friend who knew Jennifer Jobe,
who's in the choir. And we got to be friends
at the show's I'd come to. After a while, she
noticed how enthusiastic I was about it and
she invited me to come to a rehearsal one
night. I got to meet Tim [DeLaughter] and he
said, "Just hang onto the mic all night and let
me hear how you sound." The next night I
was in the show.
INT: Do you have any say on what color goes
on the bottom of your robe?
TURNER: I think when they started, all
these robes were made and people just
grabbed a color that appealed to them, I
guess. You come in and if you're lucky
enough you get a choice, but it really doesn't
matter; I think I've had seven or eight differ
ent colors since I joined. My first one was pink
and huge.
INT: And what will you be wearing tonight?
TURNER: I think tonight I'll probably wear
ing the crimson red
INT: Can you tell us a little about rehearsals?
Even in bands with four members it's tough
to keep people focused, so I'm really curious
how yours work.
TURNER: For a working rehearsal, usually
the way it starts is that Tim will come in with
an idea of a song, something he's been work
ing on for a while, or maybe something that's
just come into his head, and he'll say," I have
an idea for this kind of sound, or these are the
basic chord structures I'm looking at, or this is
the basic melody or feeling," and he'll play
through it a few times on the guitar or piano
or whatever. And one by one, whenever

somebody hears a part for
their instrument

or starts to get a feeling, they'll join in and the
song builds from there. Once the musicians
have at least a working structure, the choir
comes in and we hear what's going on and
start writing vocal parts. And then rehearsals
from there are just like with any other band,
you play with the songs and you listen for
what works and what doesn't; you're trying to
have a good time, so you make it as open a
process as you can.
It's always fun to watch it happen, because
you start to see how the dynamics of our per
sonal relationships enter into the process of
making music and the way people take on dif
ferent roles in the rehearsal and writing
process. Different people catch on at differ
ent times and sometimes this song that later
ends up being a big rock song, maybe the first
instrument that caught on in the beginning
was the flute or the trombone, or maybe it
was the harp or a vocal aria. With that many
people, a song could go any way and that
process gets compounded 24 times.
INT: You mentioned you had a background
in music, and I've always been curious about
a band that's so large, is everyone's musical
background completely different?
TURNER: Absolutely. I mean you have
someone like our bass player who is a really
solid rock bass player, and then you think,
"Well, there's a harp up on stage —that guy's
not coming from a rock perspective." But it's
funny to see what you'd expect someone to
listen to based on what they played, and then
have someone like Ricky Rasura who plays
the harp and the bulk of what he listens to is
stadium rock. And then me, I don't listen to a
lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes
> the

Beatles. And that's about as cohesive as it
gets.

INT: How does it work out for the band play
ing live at venues with small stages? Do you
have to change the setup of each show?
TURNER: Yeah, the setup sometimes has to
change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while
you get a stage that's a little too big, or a little
too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and
we opened up for Flaming Lips and Radio
head and a bunch of great bands that day; and
I remember going out on stage feeling a little
bit overwhelmed by the size of it. The crowd
was so huge and you had all this energy com
ing at you, and you have the feeling, "Our
piano player is way over there and this guy's
way over there." Ideally, I think the more
room there is to play around and have fun,
when you're not worried about elbowing
somebody in the face and you can just swing
around; But, we'll fit anywhere we'll make
it work.
INT: You mentioned that the size of the band
expands and contract, so do you look to re
place an instrument if someone can't make it
on a tour?
TURNER: It's rare that someone can't come
for a certain tour. Usually the change hap
pens when somebody's been with the band
for a while and their life is starting to feel like
they need to be doing something else, or
whatever. Whenever somebody leaves,
whatever energy comes along in that absence
always seems to make things better. It's real
ly rare that anything comes along that makes
the experience worse. It's just something that
you have to adapt to, with people coming and
going from the band, with various sizes of
stages, with all the different moments in the
music, with the rehearsal process every
thing about it seems so mutable and full of
possibility. That's been one of the things that
has made me wanna stay with it through the

good times and the hard times, just knowing
that you never know what's going to happen to
morrow.
INT: You've done a lot of shows in England,
and toured Japan this past summer; What's the
reception of the band in other countries?
TURNER: Oh, it's awesome! All the traveling
we've had the opportunity to do in this band has
been so fascinating because you see the way dif
ferent cultures respond. The first time we went
over to the UK, to play in London, we hadn't
played outside of Texas and the way they were
responding to us was really different from the
response we had ever gotten over here. It seems
like with the entertainment in England, they're
looking for things off the beaten path or any
thing that seems unfamiliar but still has an ele
ment of being fun or innocent. It seems like
they're looking for something that they haven't
seen before, where in the United States people
are looking for something that they feel they al
ready understand. And then a year later to go
over to Japan, it's just like ten-fold over there.
We went over there and our first show
was playing to 30,000 people. At our first club
show in that part of the world let alone in
that country or city we had a huge outpour
ing of love from people who were crowded
around the club door when we came out and
then chased our van down the road when we
went back to the hotel. It was so welcoming and
I had to ask myself, 'Would you ever get that
with an American crowd?' They got so excited,

and I wanted to be excited with them; with the
English it was the same way, except maybe they
were a little bit drunker.

INT: Do you guys play in the daytime much?
TURNER: Yeah, I'd say we've been lucky enough to have a pretty fair spread of that. A lot of
our songs incorporate themes of sunshine and there's a very "sunny" vibe to all of it, and I think
it's neat to see the way a crowd of thousands of people reacts to 24 people belting out the word
"sun" in full harmony right at the moment on a rainy day when the clouds start to part and the
sun pours in that's happened a number of times, and it's very strange. It's a weird syn
chronicity that's been very inspiring. It's really beautiful in a different way from a crowd of peo
ple packed into a smoky club late at night where everybody feels a little seedy, and then this
band comes on and they don't seem like what you're used to seeing when you're feeling really
seedy, and there's an energy to it that's also really exciting. It's neat to see when the crowd's re
ally into it and we're really into to, and you have that synchronicity, whether it's inside or out
side, daytime or nighttime, like that 'love moment,' or the 'fun moment,' or the 'ah, I just be
came aware of something moment.' To take aside the record deals or the robes or 'when am I
gonna eat?' and to know that for years now I've been able to be a part of something where that
moment just happens over and again is encouraging to me and makes it all worth it.

INT: Do you think if logistics weren't an issue at all, like transportation or the size of the stage,
the band would be larger and keep expanding?
TURNER: Well, I don't think so, because if Tim and everybody else had been thinking of lo
gistics to begin with, I don't really think they would have put together a band of 25 people to try
and take out on the road. It's one of the greatest things about Tim is that we really don't care

matters to me." And I can do this every day of my life, it works out. Did that happen because
we were worrying about how we were gonna get paid? No, absolutely not. I think the possibili
ties with this band are pretty limitless right now. My dream with this band has already come to

INT: Can you tell us a little about rehearsals?
Even in bands with four members it's tough
to keep people focused, so I'm really curious
how yours work.
TURNER: For a working rehearsal, usually
the way it starts is that Tim will come in with
an idea of a song, something he's been work
ing on for a while, or maybe something that's
just come into his head, and he'll say," I have
an idea for this kind of sound, or these are the
basic chord structures I'm looking at, or this is
the basic melody or feeling," and he'll play
through it a few times on the guitar or piano
or whatever. And one by one, whenever

somebody hears a part for
their instrument

or starts to get a feeling, they'll join in and the
song builds from there. Once the musicians
have at least a working structure, the choir
comes in and we hear what's going on and
start writing vocal parts. And then rehearsals
from there are just like with any other band,
you play with the songs and you listen for
what works and what doesn't; you're trying to
have a good time, so you make it as open a
process as you can.
It's always fun to watch it happen, because
you start to see how the dynamics of our per
sonal relationships enter into the process of
making music and the way people take on dif
ferent roles in the rehearsal and writing
process. Different people catch on at differ
ent times and sometimes this song that later
ends up being a big rock song, maybe the first
instrument that caught on in the beginning
was the flute or the trombone, or maybe it
was the harp or a vocal aria. With that many
people, a song could go any way and that
process gets compounded 24 times.
INT: You mentioned you had a background
in music, and I've always been curious about
a band that's so large, is everyone's musical
background completely different?
TURNER: Absolutely. I mean you have
someone like our bass player who is a really
solid rock bass player, and then you think,
"Well, there's a harp up on stage —that guy's
not coming from a rock perspective." But it's
funny to see what you'd expect someone to
listen to based on what they played, and then
have someone like Ricky Rasura who plays
the harp and the bulk of what he listens to is
stadium rock. And then me, I don't listen to a
lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes
> the

Beatles. And that's about as cohesive as it
gets.

INT: How does it work out for the band play
ing live at venues with small stages? Do you
have to change the setup of each show?
TURNER: Yeah, the setup sometimes has to
change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while
you get a stage that's a little too big, or a little
too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and
we opened up for Flaming Lips and Radio
head and a bunch of great bands that day; and
I remember going out on stage feeling a little
bit overwhelmed by the size of it. The crowd
was so huge and you had all this energy com
ing at you, and you have the feeling, "Our
piano player is way over there and this guy's
way over there." Ideally, I think the more
room there is to play around and have fun,
when you're not worried about elbowing
somebody in the face and you can just swing
around; But, we'll fit anywhere we'll make
it work.
INT: You mentioned that the size of the band
expands and contract, so do you look to re
place an instrument if someone can't make it
on a tour?
TURNER: It's rare that someone can't come
for a certain tour. Usually the change hap
pens when somebody's been with the band
for a while and their life is starting to feel like
they need to be doing something else, or
whatever. Whenever somebody leaves,
whatever energy comes along in that absence
always seems to make things better. It's real
ly rare that anything comes along that makes
the experience worse. It's just something that
you have to adapt to, with people coming and
going from the band, with various sizes of
stages, with all the different moments in the
music, with the rehearsal process every
thing about it seems so mutable and full of
possibility. That's been one of the things that
has made me wanna stay with it through the

good times and the hard times, just knowing
that you never know what's going to happen to
morrow.
INT: You've done a lot of shows in England,
and toured Japan this past summer; What's the
reception of the band in other countries?
TURNER: Oh, it's awesome! All the traveling
we've had the opportunity to do in this band has
been so fascinating because you see the way dif
ferent cultures respond. The first time we went
over to the UK, to play in London, we hadn't
played outside of Texas and the way they were
responding to us was really different from the
response we had ever gotten over here. It seems
like with the entertainment in England, they're
looking for things off the beaten path or any
thing that seems unfamiliar but still has an ele
ment of being fun or innocent. It seems like
they're looking for something that they haven't
seen before, where in the United States people
are looking for something that they feel they al
ready understand. And then a year later to go
over to Japan, it's just like ten-fold over there.
We went over there and our first show
was playing to 30,000 people. At our first club
show in that part of the world let alone in
that country or city we had a huge outpour
ing of love from people who were crowded
around the club door when we came out and
then chased our van down the road when we
went back to the hotel. It was so welcoming and
I had to ask myself, 'Would you ever get that
with an American crowd?' They got so excited,

and I wanted to be excited with them; with the
English it was the same way, except maybe they
were a little bit drunker.

INT: Do you guys play in the daytime much?
TURNER: Yeah, I'd say we've been lucky enough to have a pretty fair spread of that. A lot of
our songs incorporate themes of sunshine and there's a very "sunny" vibe to all of it, and I think
it's neat to see the way a crowd of thousands of people reacts to 24 people belting out the word
"sun" in full harmony right at the moment on a rainy day when the clouds start to part and the
sun pours in that's happened a number of times, and it's very strange. It's a weird syn
chronicity that's been very inspiring. It's really beautiful in a different way from a crowd of peo
ple packed into a smoky club late at night where everybody feels a little seedy, and then this
band comes on and they don't seem like what you're used to seeing when you're feeling really
seedy, and there's an energy to it that's also really exciting. It's neat to see when the crowd's re
ally into it and we're really into to, and you have that synchronicity, whether it's inside or out
side, daytime or nighttime, like that 'love moment,' or the 'fun moment,' or the 'ah, I just be
came aware of something moment.' To take aside the record deals or the robes or 'when am I
gonna eat?' and to know that for years now I've been able to be a part of something where that
moment just happens over and again is encouraging to me and makes it all worth it.

INT: Do you think if logistics weren't an issue at all, like transportation or the size of the stage,
the band would be larger and keep expanding?
TURNER: Well, I don't think so, because if Tim and everybody else had been thinking of lo
gistics to begin with, I don't really think they would have put together a band of 25 people to try
and take out on the road. It's one of the greatest things about Tim is that we really don't care
that is not my job to worry about it. I mean look at us you get 25 of us, all playing different
instruments, throw 'em on a stage, put them in a bunch of white robes and have them jump
around and clap and sing songs about the sun, and you're touring internationally three years
later and have videos on MTV, and you have people all over the world saying, "what you do
matters to me." And I can do this every day of my life, it works out. Did that happen because
we were worrying about how we were gonna get paid? No, absolutely not. I think the possibili
ties with this band are pretty limitless right now. My dream with this band has already come to
be, to be doing what I'm doing right now.
