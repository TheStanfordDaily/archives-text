# INTERMISSION THE POLYPHONIC SPREE
## 
### JULIAN WASS RYAN SANDS STAFF WRITERS 
Imagine for a minute that Phil Spector,
renowned record producer, suspected mur
derer and confirmed lunatic had 25 secret
love children. Imagine further that these
mini-Spectors were all raised inside a big pas
tel colored house filled with soft pillows and
paintings of baby animals. The only TV show
they were allowed to watch was Sesame
Street and the only record they had was
"Here Comes the Sun." Then pretend for a
minute that when they were of age, they were
let loose into the world and they started a
band. If you can imagine all this, you have
some idea of what the Polyphonic Spree
sounds like.
Led by Tim DeLaughter, previously of the
90's alt-rock group Tripping Daisy, The Spree
have been sharing their sunshine-orchestral
pop with the world for nearly four years. To
hear the group on record harkens similar
bands such as the Flaming Lips, My Morning
Jacket or Grandaddy. Seeing the Spree live is
a truly unique experience; it becomes evident
that, unlike the previously named groups, the
Polyphonic Spree's sound comes not from
overdubs and studio wizadry, but from good
old fashioned numbers. Onstage, all in
matching white robes with colored trim at the
bottom, the Spree features not only tradition
al rock instrumentation, but also a floutist, a
horn section, a string section, three key
boardists, two percussionists, a theremin
player and a nine piece chorus. In the middle
of this madness is vocalist Delaughter.
We spoke with chorus member Michael
Turner, who described DeLaughter as the
"visionary of the group." Turner has been
with the group since it's earlier days as a mere
10 piece, and shared with Intermission the
unique experience it is to be a piece of what
many have described as not a group, but a
"Happening."

INTERMISSION: So, how did you get into
the Polyphonic Spree?

TURNER: Well, the first show that I saw was
in April of 2001 and I was totally blown away,
so I started going to every show after that. I
had a good friend who knew Jennifer Jobe,
who's in the choir. And we got to be friends
at the show's I'd come to. After a while, she
noticed how enthusiastic I was about it and
she invited me to come to a rehearsal one
night. I got to meet Tim [DeLaughter] and he
said, "Just hang onto the mic all night and let
me hear how you sound." The next night I
was in the show.
INT: Do you have any say on what color goes
on the bottom of your robe?
TURNER: I think when they started, all
these robes were made and people just
grabbed a color that appealed to them, I
guess. You come in and if you're lucky
enough you get a choice, but it really doesn't
matter; I think I've had seven or eight differ
ent colors since I joined. My first one was pink
and huge.
INT: And what will you be wearing tonight?
TURNER: I think tonight I'll probably wear
ing the crimson red
INT: Can you tell us a little about rehearsals?
Even in bands with four members it's tough
to keep people focused, so I'm really curious
how yours work.
TURNER: For a working rehearsal, usually
the way it starts is that Tim will come in with
an idea of a song, something he's been work
ing on for a while, or maybe something that's
just come into his head, and he'll say," I have
an idea for this kind of sound, or these are the
basic chord structures I'm looking at, or this is
the basic melody or feeling," and he'll play
through it a few times on the guitar or piano
or whatever. And one by one, whenever

somebody hears a part for
their instrument

or starts to get a feeling, they'll join in and the
song builds from there. Once the musicians
have at least a working structure, the choir
comes in and we hear what's going on and
start writing vocal parts. And then rehearsals
from there are just like with any other band,
you play with the songs and you listen for
what works and what doesn't; you're trying to
have a good time, so you make it as open a
process as you can.
It's always fun to watch it happen, because
you start to see how the dynamics of our per
sonal relationships enter into the process of
making music and the way people take on dif
ferent roles in the rehearsal and writing
process. Different people catch on at differ
ent times and sometimes this song that later
ends up being a big rock song, maybe the first
instrument that caught on in the beginning
was the flute or the trombone, or maybe it
was the harp or a vocal aria. With that many
people, a song could go any way and that
process gets compounded 24 times.
INT: You mentioned you had a background
in music, and I've always been curious about
a band that's so large, is everyone's musical
background completely different?
TURNER: Absolutely. I mean you have
someone like our bass player who is a really
solid rock bass player, and then you think,
"Well, there's a harp up on stage â€”that guy's
not coming from a rock perspective." But it's
funny to see what you'd expect someone to
listen to based on what they played, and then
have someone like Ricky Rasura who plays
the harp and the bulk of what he listens to is
stadium rock. And then me, I don't listen to a
lot of stadium rock; I was raised in a lot of the
different chorals styles, musical theater and
jazz singing, but most of what I listen to out
"side of that has been '70s glam rock. I don't
think you could pin down one particular in
fluence, I mean everybody comes from such a
different place. I think there might be a few
bands that everybody in the band agrees on,
like the Beatles, but everybody pretty much

anywhere likes
> the

Beatles. And that's about as cohesive as it
gets.

INT: How does it work out for the band play
ing live at venues with small stages? Do you
have to change the setup of each show?
TURNER: Yeah, the setup sometimes has to
change from night to night. Of course, the
bigger the better, but every once in a while
you get a stage that's a little too big, or a little
too spread out. I remember we played the
Glasbury festival in the UK this summer, and
we opened up for Flaming Lips and Radio
head and a bunch of great bands that day; and
I remember going out on stage feeling a little
bit overwhelmed by the size of it. The crowd
was so huge and you had all this energy com
ing at you, and you have the feeling, "Our
piano player is way over there and this guy's
way over there." Ideally, I think the more
room there is to play around and have fun,
when you're not worried about elbowing
somebody in the face and you can just swing
around; But, we'll fit anywhere we'll make
it work.
INT: You mentioned that the size of the band
expands and contract, so do you look to re
place an instrument if someone can't make it
on a tour?
TURNER: It's rare that someone can't come
for a certain tour. Usually the change hap
pens when somebody's been with the band
for a while and their life is starting to feel like
they need to be doing something else, or
whatever. Whenever somebody leaves,
whatever energy comes along in that absence
always seems to make things better. It's real
ly rare that anything comes along that makes
the experience worse. It's just something that
you have to adapt to, with people coming and
going from the band, with various sizes of
stages, with all the different moments in the
music, with the rehearsal process every
thing about it seems so mutable and full of
possibility. That's been one of the things that
has made me wanna stay with it through the
