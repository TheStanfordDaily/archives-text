# Durable, Daring Duran, Duran?

### MACKENZIE COOPER 
Ah, the 80s. Spandex pants, side ponytails and white Miami Vice suits.
Wait... do I really miss any of that? Maybe not. But the music new wave,
keyboard-synth, UK pop the music I miss.
Turns out I'm not the only one with this idea. Originally released in 1983,
Duran Duran's classic album "Seven and the Ragged Tiger" was recently re
released in an attempt to regenerate interest in the 80s and 90s UK pop band.
Not that the buzz hasn't been growing: Duran Duran earned MTV's presti
gious Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2003 Video Music Awards and
are currently working on their first album of new material in several years.
The time is ripe for a recap.
Once declared "The Fab Five" by Rolling Stone, this band epitomized 80s
new wave pop attitude. "Seven and the Ragged Tiger" boasted several hit
singles among them the worldwide hit "Union of the Snake" and the
band's first #1 U.S. hit "The Reflex" (both male takes on early Madonna)
but nothing today's average listener would recognize.
The album upholds the keyboard-heavy new-wave pop ethos of the infa
mous single "Hungry Like The Wolf" (one of MTV's top 15 most played
videos of all time) but places a greater emphasis on vocals than previous al
bums. This makes all the difference. The last track, "The Seventh Stranger,"
is easily the best on the album, with singer Simon Leßon's voice shining.
Other notable tracks are "Cracks in the Pavement," about painful memories
of a past experience and "New Moon on Monday," a song about waiting for
a romantic interest to make a decision. Both songs were semi-hits when they
were originally released.

"Seven and the Ragged Tiger" marked the height of Duran Duran's fame
in the 1980s. After the album, the band did not produce another #1 hit single
until 1992's "Ordinary World" and "Come Undone" began their triumphant
return to the music scene.
For anyone who remembers "The Breakfast Club" with fondness and
knows who the Brat Pack is, "Seven and the Ragged Tiger" is a must-have,
a classic the nine songs may be similar to each other, but the product is
vastly different from the music that dominates the scene today. So, go ahead;
capture the "Tiger." It was great then, and it's still great now.


David Bowie, eat your heart out.
