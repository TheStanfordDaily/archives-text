# Apparently, there is a 'Reason' to like Hoobastank

"Hoobastank?!"
Well, certainly not mine
if you're asking whose
arse is emitting a foul
odor. But if you're ask
ing about the quartet
from Calabassass, Ca.lif.
then you're in luck be
cause they've released
their sophomore album,
"The Reason" and there
is reason to read on.
On their second out
ing, the band delivers
nicely with the same
semi-heavy, modern
rock, pop formula previ
ously employed on their
2001 debut album, the
self-titled "Hoobas
tank." On the opening
track, "Same Direction,"
they start off with a nice,

soft clean guitar, just prattling along innocently, going wacka wacka, then
wacka wacka, then more wacka wacka, then WAM BITCH, WACKA THIS!

Watch out ladies these guys mean business
and business means stamping their Vans on the
distortion pedal, rocking out and throwing their
bodies and guitars in every single direction with a
flagrant disregard for decency! Duck for cover be
cause these musical shamans are attempting to
channel the musical spirits of Black Sabbath,
Metallica and The Doors!

Well, not really I embellish. Sorry to disap
point you die-hard fans, but these guys aren't that

good. These guys are going for hard, but they come off more like their prede
cessors Staind and Incubus. (Not "5.C.1.E.N.C.E." Incubus but "Make Your
self" Incubus, which isn't bad, but of course Incubus would've done better.)

The first single
"Out of Con
trol" is a good
gauge of what
this album is
about basi
cally the same
thing the first
one was about,
but slightly
tweaked to
sound a little
better. Their
debut album
gave birth to
three radio
friendly singles;
this album has a
similar poten
tional. Tracks
like "Escape"
and "Let it Out"
have the heavi
ness to please

the metal
posers, the hooks to please the Linkin' Park fans and the sing-a-long lyrics to
please everyone listening to the radio.

And, of course, for all the guys who want
a perfect love track to put on their mix CDs for
their ladies, there are the essential Incubus-like
make-out track like "The Reason" (the titles
song) in which singer Doug Robb sings for all the
little 13-year-old Asian girls with braces, "I've
found a reason for me/ to change who I used to
be/a reason to start over new/ and the reason is
you". I mean if your girlfriend doesn't have sex

with you after hearing that then you must look like Gollum or something.
Guitarist Daniel Estrin, meanwhile, shows he can do the soft guitar thing

They have the
hooks to
Linkin' Park fans
