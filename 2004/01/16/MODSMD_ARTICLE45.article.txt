# Polysics: Even parole officers dig these Japanese punks
## 
### ALICE KIM STAFF WRITER 
So I was talking to my parole officer the other day, and she said what she says every time we meet
"Alice, you oughtn't throw bricks through windows and put your feet through department store
doors." But I never listen, because life is so boring and what'll I do with this rage that keeps boiling
up in me?
But this is my third strike, and I'm in bad trouble. This time, she adjusts her aviator glasses, slides
a CD across the diner table and says, "This might help." It's "Neu," by Polysics. I'm desperate for a
little rehabilitation so I rip the shrink-wrap off with my teeth and stick it in the car stereo when on
the way home.
And holy crap, guess what? I'm cured! I owe it all to the controlled, nerdy violence of Polysics!
The excitement starts with the first track "Go Aliead Now." Synth splats and demented guitar riffs
trade insults for a while, until a Japanese guy busts in and shouts at you that's right to "GO
AHEAD NOW!"
This album is brilliant. When I listen to it, I don't need to throw bricks anymore, because "Neu"
makes me feel like I'm throwing bricks IN MY MIND. Now, how do you achieve bricks of the mind
with an album, especially one made by Japanese art-punk geek Devo acolytes?
Well, it just happens. You'll find that you are helpless to stop the onslaught. Especially when
"Neu" is as effective and damaged-sounding as the best punk rock, if punk rock grew up to work a

decent job in computers and got a little money and fashion sense. Polysics use synthesizers, the
whole guitar/drum/bass mess and vocoders (which produces an eerie, swallowed-sounding voice) all
together to devastating effect.
As spastic and sputtering "Neu" sounds, it manages to be completely endearing and most im
portant of all, danceable as all fuck. "Making Sense" is Polysics' most 'Top of the Pops type hit sin
gle,' with Hiroyuki Hayashi's glamorous, barely-recognizable-as-English vocals. It starts with a
ragged drumbeat, with each additional instrument joining the song one by one, until KABOOM!
You get the idea. Basically, this is fun music for fun people, who don't mind getting kicked in the
head a little while dancing. You'll be able to find all the splintery, batshit-insane madness you desire
in "Neu."
And so, the next time you kids feel like picking up a fat brick and hurling it through a window,
just chill. Remember my story, and how I was saved from a life of crime and destruction by an album
called "Neu." My parole officer tells me I'll be able to work in elementary schools with children if I
keep up the good behavior.


Dudes, when I was your age, I rode a vacuum cleaner.
