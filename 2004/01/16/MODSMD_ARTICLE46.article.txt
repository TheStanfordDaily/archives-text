# Phantom Planet lacks personality, guy from 'Rushmore'
## 
### MIKE ORME 
Boys and girls, in case you don't know, there's a new school of rock in town. This school start
ed three short years ago with the appearance of groups like the Strokes and has produced dis
tinguished alumni like The Rapture and Hot Hot Heat. All in all, these kids are better dressed,
more stylishly groomed, and just plain more fun than the rockers of the 90's. The new school
makes rock music with actual beats beats that like-minded indie kids can dance badly to in
their rooms, at shows, even at clubs. Most importantly, with a curriculum of equal parts pop and
avant-garde, this school is perhaps the first major new movement since the pre-grunge days to
stand up in the hard rock spotlight and look Led Zeppelin in the eye.
Somewhere in this mix lies Phantom Planet, which has actually been in the game since 1994,
releasing their major-label debut, "Phantom Planet is Missing," in 1998. Their sound, however,
places them firmly in the ranks of the new indie kids, and their new self-titled release provides a
surprisingly detailed survey of their contemporaries' styles.
But as you'd expect from any survey, "Phantom Planet" lacks personality.
Up until recently, Phantom Planet boasted the star-power and drumming skills of one Jason
Schwartzman, star of such screen gems as "Slackers," "SlmOne" and a funny little flick called
"Rushmore." Halfway through the recording of this album, Schwartzman left to resuscitate his
acting career, which means he got an offer to star in a movie that mattered more to him than play
ing drums with these guys.
The rest of the band was shocked, but they regrouped and hired a new drummer, Jeff Conrad.
While Conrad plays quite capably here (and also gives it a rest for some well-placed Casio key
board beats in "Knowitall"), Schwartzman's departure obviously changes the entire dynamic of

the band. Sadly, Phantom Planet's music is not memorable enough for their relevance to be un
affected by the departure of their moonlighting star.
That's not to say "Phantom Planet" is a failure. The album shape-shifts from song to song, giv
ing at-a-glance reads of reggae influences, rock swagger and a few choice melodies. The opener
"Happy Ending" will draw inevitable Strokes comparisons, while "Badd Business" and "Ist
Things Ist" recall Spoon. Shades of The Dismemberment Plan can be found all over "Phantom
Planet" in the form of aggressive, guitar-oriented tunes tempered by the infectious beats coming
from the rhythm section.
At its best, "Phantom Planet" balances the harsh sounds of groups like Brainiac with more
playful pop-punk, resulting in a sound somewhat like early Elvis Costello. The problem is that
"Phantom Planet" doesn't reach those heights nearly enough, too often sounding like it's aping
some other record. There are some good moments, like the pop of "After Hours" followed by
the closing, infectious dance tune "The Meantime," but in the end, "Phantom Planet" just
doesn't take enough risks.
There's no denying the talent at work on this album. Indeed, "Phantom Planet" is a gleeful
display of what the new school of rock is doing right. Unfortunately, these guys could use a little
initiative in setting themselves apart from the rest of the class. And losing the title of "band with
the guy from 'Rushmore'" isn't going to do them much good in that respect.
