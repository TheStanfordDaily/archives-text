# SFMOMA's 'Supernova' burns bright
## 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
What contemporary art do you think will be
remembered in 200 years?
I was asked that question in an interview re
cently and here was my answer: Determining
whether or not a particular artist or even a par
ticular artistic movement will be considered
important in 20 years much less 200 can be ex
tremely tricky business. If you asked a Parisian
in the 1860s if the Impressionists would be
thought of as one of the most ground-breaking
movements in the history of painting 140 years
later, your question probably would have been
greeted with laughter. The only kind of con
temporary art that you can confidently say will
be remembered in 200 years, I said, is public
art such as the yet-to-be-built Sept. 11 memor
ial because it is tied to such an important his
torical event (as an aside, you can see the de
signs of the eight finalists at www.wtcsite
memorial.org/finalists.html).
I think I gave a clever answer, but it was
mostly a cop-out. As a critic, part of one's job
is to evaluate art without the benefit of hind
sight. SFMOMA's current show "Supernova:
Art of the 1990s from the Logan Collection,"
on view through May 23, provides visitors with
an opportunity to see the different sorts of art

being produced by contemporary artists. Such
a show is more of a rarity at modern art muse
ums than you might think. Take, for example,
the other shows on view at SFMOMA: retro

spectives of photographer Diane
Arbus and collage-maker Ro
mare Bearden (opening Feb. 7).
Both are deceased artists whose
importance and influence have al
ready been decided by critics and
historians alike. The artists in the
Supernova show have already
gained some measure of acclaim
in the art world otherwise they
wouldn't make it into such a
major museum show but their
historical fate is far from being de
cided. This uncertainty gives the
show a rough-edged immediacy
that museum exhibits often lack.
"Supernova" showcases more
than 80 paintings and sculptures
from the collection of Vicki and
Kent Logan. The Logans, who
started collecting art in 1993, do
nated 250 works to SFMOMA in
1997 and the works in this exhibit

were selected from among that
donation. "Supernova" has an inter
national flavor: it includes artwork

from Chinese, Japanese, British and German
artists as well as that of Americans.
The title of the show "Supernova" is
taken from a five-panel painting by the Japan
ese artist Takahashi Murakami. It suits the
show's contents. Like a supernova, the objects
in the SFMOMA show explode with energy

and scream for attention. A
gigantic sunflower rises from
the ground as if the gallery
floors were fertile soil. A pink
neon sign with the words
"Fantastic to Feel Beautiful
Again" illuminates one of the
museum's walls. A 10-foot
high hour-glass shaped sculp
ture constructed of hundreds
of white sculpted human
brains seems to float on the
surface of the floor. A star
tlingly real leg juts out from a
wall as if to trip museum visi
tors. A life-size female Japan
ese Anime character jumps
rope with a cord made up of a
milk stream projected from
her enormous breasts. Walk
ing through the "Supernova"
show is a bit like being ab
sorbed into a Salvador Dalf
painting: The environment
provokes unfamiliar reac
tions with its odd juxtaposi
tions, often in a humorous
way.

Some of the pieces in the ex
hibit reminded me of Paris

Hilton
more flash
than sub
stance,
seeking at
tention for
its own
sake. Huan
Zhang's
"To Add
One Meter
to an Un
known

Mountain"
left me scratching my head. The photo shows
at least 10 naked people piled on top of one an
other on an "unknown mountain." Their faces

are turned away from the camera. Is the mes
sage that nature is our foundation and that
man can only improve upon it slightly? Or
maybe the subjects' nakedness symbolizes
human vulnerability in the face of all-powerful
nature. Whatever interpretation one propos
es, the photo can't escape its own silliness.

Damien Hirst's "Philip" from his "Twelve
Disciples" series is simply creepy. The work is
a decayed bull's head in a glass case filled with
formaldehyde. You might remember Hirst
from 1999 when then-New York mayor Rudy
Guliani tried to browbeat the Brooklyn Muse
um of Art into closing an exhibit featuring
Hirst's carved-up creatures because they were
"disgusting" and "offensive." The controversy
didn't seem to hurt Hirst's career I recently
noticed a piece similar to "Philip" being adver
tised in an art magazine by an auction house
for between $400,000 and $600,000. I under
stand that one of the aims of Hirst's project is
to challenge the notion that beauty is a pre
requisite to successful art a valid point
but that doesn't make me like "Philip" any bet
ter.
One of the show's strong points is the pres
ence of paintings from some of today's best fig
urative painters. John Currin's "Laughing
Nude" and Lisa Yuskavage's "Good Evening,
Hamass" prove that figurative painting is not a

defunct genre in an age when performance,
conceptual, video and abstract art are more
popular. A painter whose work cannot easily
be categorized into either figurative or ab
stract is Chuck Close. His "Robert" from 1997
is a human face divided into a system of diago
nal grids. If you stand up close, each diamond
of the grid seems filled with an abstract amoe
bae-like form, but from far away the face
comes into practically photographic focus. The
fact that Close suffered a stroke in 1988 that
left him wheel-chair bound and with limited
function in his upper limbs a paintbrush has

to be strapped to his hand because he is unable
to hold it makes "Robert" all the more in
credible.
Another highlight of the show is the art of
Felix Gonzales-Torres, whose work explores
themes of impermanence and incompleteness.
His "Untitled (Memorial Day Weekend)" is a
stack of posters lying on the gallery floor. Vis
itors are free to take as many posters as they
want. The stack diminishes over the course of
the day and then the museum replenishes the
stack before it reopens the following day. This
piece cleverly trumps many assumptions we
have about art and museums: that we're not al
lowed to touch art, that art should be made to
last, and that we should be able to see the
artist's hand in the work, just to name a few.
Sadly, Gonzales-Torres died of AIDS in 1995.
"Supernova" has more hits than misses and,
on the whole, I was more entertained than any
thing else. When I looked up the term "super
nova" in the dictionary, it turned out to be an
even more appropriate title than I first

thought: "an extremely bright, short-lived ob
ject that emits vast amounts of energy." Most
but not all of the art in the exhibit will, I
believe, be short-lived and not be remembered
in 200 years, but that doesn't make it any less
compelling to view as spectacle in the present
moment.

'Supernova' h
edged immediacy that
museum
exhibits of lack.

One of the show's strong
points is the presence of paint
ings from some of today's best
figurative painters.
