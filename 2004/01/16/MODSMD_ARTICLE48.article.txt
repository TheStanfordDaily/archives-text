# Roxy says: Hickies suck!!!
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Sometimes, when two peo
ple fall in love, they go to Paris,
stroll through the Louvre, and make
tender, expressive love to each
other, exchanging supposedly
tantric gazes that are really just sort
of creepy. And sometimes, when
two people fall in like, they go to
Death Cab shows in the city, stroll
through the streets of North Beach,
go home and pretend they're just

going to watch a movie but really
end up doing it on the futon. And
sometimes, when two people fall
into record-breaking streaks of
celibacy, they go to Ernie's, buy
enough Mad Dog to fill up a bathtub
with, get drunk via osmosis, and do
horrible things to each other in the
back of a Volvo that just barely
qualify as legal. Or so I hear.
But no matter how you like
to get down, eventually one morning
you will wake up, look in the mirror,

and find your once pure and virginal
skin violated by a hickey. One if
you're lucky, ten if you have particu
larly thick neck-skin and a decreased
sensitivity to the feeling of someone
hovering the fuck out of your collar
bones. Because hickies don't care
who you are. They don't care if
you're rich, they don't care if you're
poor, they don't care who you wor
ship, and they especially don't care
about that time you studied abroad
and had an earth-shattering revela

tion about life/capitalism/how to pro
nounce "bruschetta" so please shut
up already. What, you go away for
three months and suddenly you're
Amerigo fucking Vespucci?
Anyway, the key here is
prevention. This is fairly easy if you
are in a somewhat committed rela
tionship in which communication is
not solely limited to text messages at
3am. Just tell them gently, "Hey, if
you don't stop trying to suck the skin
off my neck I'm going to kick your
ass." This is especially effective when
accompanied by a few well-executed
kung fu moves. For those of you
equipped with a magic stick, tasteful
ly suggest that while their powers of
suction are not so much appreciated
in "Canada" they may be much bet
ter received in say "Mexico." And by
Mexico, I mean south of the border.
And by south of the border I mean
your penis. Easy, right?
For those of you who find
yourselves more comfortable un

dressing rather than addressing
your partners, prevention becomes
a little tougher. But still, entirely
within the realm of possibility. Be
cause random hookups are driven
mostly by animalistic drives, use
that to your advantage by instituting
some sort of Pavlovian reward sys
tem. Bring a bag of gummy
bears/chocolate/cocaine with you
next time. Give away for good be
havior, take back for bad. This is so
instinctual that you won't even have
to explain the rules. After all, were
we not culled from the same primor
dial soup? Underneath these fancy
clothes and civilizations and iPods,
are we not merely monkeys with
thumbs who can talk?

And when, despite your best
efforts, prevention fails, slap on some
foundation, don a turtleneck, and re
alize you've seen enough episodes of
"Growing Pains" and "Step by Step"
to know that neither of these solutions
is going to fool anyone for a second.
