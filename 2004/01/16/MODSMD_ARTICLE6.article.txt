## Repeat after me: Joel Stein is back again 
### JOEL STEIN FRIDAY, MARCH 5, 1998 
Editors' note: Revivals of standards such as "Kiss
Me Kate" are a given on Broadway and in MedAud
alike. Re-printing Joel Stein's column regarding
"repetition" on Broadway? That's dramatic irony
for you. Actually, it's just Alanis Morrisette irony
for you. Without further ado about nothing . . .

Repetition. Nightmarish repetition. Like when
that damn ball keeps bouncing down the stairs
right into that expensive vase Mom always warned
us about. Repetition on top of repetition. Like
when, as 11-year-olds who should have been out
side making fun of fat kids, we got excited at the
prospect of watching, yet again, the episode where
that damn ball keeps bouncing down the stairs
right into that expensive vase Mom always warned
us about.
Even on Broadway, where, not long ago, pro
ducers were hip to nothing but the most ridiculous,
inherently irritating pitches ("No, the whole cast
will be on roller skates — for the whole show."
"Picture this: They're in Vietnam and they're
scared, so they sing."), a Bradylike sense of repe
tition is setting in.
This spring, Broadway offers "The Goodbye
Girl" (movie), "Kiss of the Spider Woman" (book
and movie), "Tommy"(album, movie and con
cert), and "Annie Warbucks"(second attempt at
an "Annie" sequel that will never see the stage.)
Even fashion, which successfully transformed
its lack of creativity into something hip by calling
it "retro," has become perversely repetitive, and,
yes, a little too Bradyesque. Everyone knows plat
form shoes are an insult to the aesthetic, but at
least they're a time-tested insult to the aesthetic.
Repetition offers a kind of safety that's hard to
find anywhere else. It's an oddly comforting feel
ing to know you can open the paper in the morning
and find the Dallas Mavericks have still only won
four games. And it's an even nicer thought to
know that every game the fans come, the televi
sion stations broadcast and the guy on ESPN with
the huge forehead earnestly reports the score.
Now that even the globe itself doesn't seem sta
ble, we've reverted to a pre-Columbus kind of
fear. But watching sitcoms is an easier way to find
salvation than repeating that Hail Mary thing over
and over. Because even if it's a brand-new sitcom
(say, "Blossom") you'll at least know the plot: mis
taken identity? Misunderstood overheard phone
conversation? Child's forgotten birthday? Girl
friend from the past who has somehow-magically
and without surgical scars-turned incredibly beau
tiful? Actually, that one must have been a dream
from last night. And the night before. And the
night before that.
Repetition has become so socially acceptable
that pop groups haven't considered a drummer a
necessary band member for years. As a successful
rapper, an artist of words, why waste your time
writing a whole song's worth of music? Why not
just take a really good riff of whatever happens to
be in the CD player (like the first two seconds of
"Under Pressure") and play it over and over again.
It will make people feel good and they won't even
notice the homoerotic undertones.
The New, the Pepsi, nay, the Crystal Pepsi Gen
eration, built a whole culture around bits of the
past, haphazardly rearranged into something not
-quite new. Just saying "Mr. T." makes them giggle —
in a relieved, kind of, I've-been-there kind of way.
Pretending that it all might add up to something
different, they've fooled themselves into becom
ing the junior high vice principal who puts on the
cheap blue jackets and red paisley tie on the last
day of school thinking, "Maybe this year, the kids
won't start a huge food fight in the cafeteria."
Modern karma is going to get you, in a cyclical,
"Groundhog Day" kind of way. It's a kind of nice,
supportive feeling, like the little adrenaline rush
you can't seem to suppress when the band plays
"All Right Now." Nobody is going to try some
thing new, something crazy; and if they do, they'll
do it again and again until you get used to it
("Look, Madonna's breasts! Look, Madonna's
breasts! Look, Madonna's breasts! . . . ").
The only impression anyone is going to leave in
your mind is one of those nice, hypnotic ones.
Commercials are better when they're on a lot. And
even if you don't want to admit it, late last summer
you started to sort of like that "Life is a Highway"
song.
And so, years from now, after you've given the
vast majority of your retirement earnings to
Blockbuster ("It would have been much cheaper if
we just bought 'When Harry Met Sally' for the
f$39.95." "Shut up and pass the Pringles.") you will
be deep in a stage-four REM sleep, dreaming a dif
ferent Brady nightmare. And you will be awak
ened by a monster, and he or she will tell you that
you will relive your life over and over for all eter
nity.
When this happens, stick your tongue down its
throat as far as it will go and laugh as hard as you
possibly can, given that your tongue is halfway
down a monster's throat. If you are brave, you will
thank it for the happiest times and the most
painful times, and for not having any open mouth
sores.
But most likely, you'll just be happy that this
time around, you'll have a better chance of getting
the jokes.
