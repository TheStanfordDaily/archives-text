It ain't spring cleaning
time, so don't throw out
those dusty ballet shoes just
yet. Ram's Head, Stan
ford's theatrical society, is
in the middle of auditions
for its spring musical, "Kiss
Me Kate."
Those lucky enough to
nab a callback slot were no
tified yesterday. (Sorry to
the rejects.)
While auditions were
closed to the public,
prospective actors and di
rectors alike were happy to
share their experiences.
Rohan Verma, a fresh
man who tried out on
Wednesday, said the audi
tion process was relatively
straightforward. Students
performed songs and
staged one-minute mono
logues as well as impro
vised dance sequences.
In addition, each hope
ful was tested on tonal
memory and their potential
chemistry with the cast as a
whole. (Hubba, hubba.)
Many had acted in previous
years, according to casting
directors. But all wannabe
thespians were given con
sideration.
"Remember, experi
ence and talent are not
equal," explained Matt
Dyer, a Ram's Head direc
tor
Like any good improv
act, the audition sessions
were rife with happen
stance moments of mirth.
Trang Pham, the producer
of "Kiss Me Kate," re
members that the most
amusing moment of audi
tions occurred when a male
hopeful delivered an origi
nal monologue on the sub
ject of men with breasts.
"That was a good one,"
she says, laughing.
The sleep-deprived pro
ducers also Smiled when re
calling how they jumped on
stage to perform a dance
with a person who was
about to audition solo.
According to Pham,
about 4,000 people will
probably see Ram's Head
perform the musical this
spring. "The main dance
sequence," Dyer promises,
"is extremely fun and
cute."
"Kiss Me Kate" is loose
ly based on Shakespeare's
comedy "The Taming of
the Shrew," and won best
musical at the Tony's in
1949. It was made into a
film in 1953, and won five
Tony Awards when
brought back to Broadway
in 2000.
