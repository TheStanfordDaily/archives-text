Turns out the old saying that all you
need to put on a play is "two boards and
a passion" is not quite right. Even if a
quixotic young producer were to modify
this phrase to "two broads and a pas
sion," it still wouldn't work. Fact is, the
staff of the upcoming Hip-Hopera,
which is set to bow on Feb. 27 and 28,
needs a few good MEN to fill some roles,
and they need them fast.
The 'hip-hopera' "is a dance and the
atrical production that aims at connect
ing black women's pasts with their pre

sent," says Debbie Burke, director of the
production. "Through the characters,
the production will give a voice to black
women by allowing them to share their
stories with many different communi
ties."
Some "of the biggest factors in these
women's lives are the men they interact
with," Burke says. " 'The Hip-Hopera'
needs men right now. Rehearsal is already
in progress. We need strong male actors
who are willing to deal with mature and
sensitive 'taboo' sexual and racial sub
jects.'"
In February, the show will be held in
Ricker Dining Hall in Sterling Quad.

The production is supported by the
Committee on Black Performing Arts,
the ASSU and URO funding.
Via a story line involving three gener
ations of black women (Inka, a slave in
1845, Magnolia, a Roaring Twenties jazz
singer, and LaShelle, a modern business
woman), Burke says, "this production
explores issues of black women's expres
sion and voice, fears of slavery, interra
cial relationships, spirituality, forgive
ness and self-acceptance."
Actors of all races are needed, Burke
emphasized. The production, she says,
"aims at healing and centralization and
hopes to involve a multi-cultural cast

and audience in the telling of the story."
Major roles available include Massa
Quincy Fletcher (master of Fletcher
Plantation, family man); a "gin-smooth
mysterious brother;" and Todd (kind
hearted novelist and boyfiend).
Minor roles available include:
Mr.Roland; overseer; slaves; sheriff;
William(unfaithful husband); mayor's
sons; and townsfolk.
