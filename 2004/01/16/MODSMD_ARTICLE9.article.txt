Six people were injured early yes
terday morning when a Marguerite
shuttle collided with a construction
crane.

The accident took place around
6:45 a.m. near a campus construction
site on Welch Road and Pasteur
Drive. The crane operator had just
parked at the site and had not yet
lifted the arm out of the roadway
when the bus struck it, said Universi
ty Department of Public Safety Lt.
Del Bandy in a press release.
The last time passengers were
injured in a Marguerite accident
was in the fall of 2002, when a
shuttle was rear-ended by a tow
truck, whose driver had fallen

asleep, according to Brody Hamil
ton, director of Parking & Trans
portation Services. More recently,
about a year ago, a Marguerite
shuttle slid into a car on a rainy
day. No shuttle passengers were
harmed, but the car's occupant
was injured. Outside of those inci
dents, Hamilton said, Marguerite
shuttles have "an excellent safety
record."
When the shuttle collided with

the crane, many of the 20 passengers
fell from their seats. Of the six trans
ported to Stanford Hospital, three
complained of back pain, one had a
shoulder injury, one had an arm in
jury and one suffered from hip and
knee injuries. The bus driver, who
also complained of pain to his shoul
der, said he would take himself to
the hospital.
According to Stanford News Ser
vice spokesman Ray Delgado, it is
too early to know who was responsi
ble for the accident.
"There's still an investigation
that the California Highway Patrol is
conducting," he said. "No one
knows who's liable for the accident
at this point, whether it's the con
struction company or the bus dri
ver."
The California Highway Patrol
could not immediately be reached
for comment.
Delgado said part of the shuttle
was significantly damaged when it
hit the crane's boom, about nine feet
from the ground.
"It's not totaled, but it's definite
ly out of commission," he said.
Hamilton said he does not expect
shuttle service to be affected. There
are 21 buses in the Marguerite fleet.
