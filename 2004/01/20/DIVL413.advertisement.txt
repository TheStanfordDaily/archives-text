Express your independence.
Buy cars and SUVs that get
the best mileage.
We're all looking for a way to
express our independence. And
what better way than to purchase a
car that helps break our chain of
dependence on Middle East oil?
The technology exists today to
build cars, trucks, and SUVs that
use less fuel, cut down on global
warming pollution, and keep more
money in your wallet. But American
auto manufacturers say there's no
demand for these vehicles. You
have the power to prove them
wrong. Learn about the best buys
for you and the planet by going to
www.nrdc.org. And while you're
there, tell Detroit you're not buying
their excuses.
