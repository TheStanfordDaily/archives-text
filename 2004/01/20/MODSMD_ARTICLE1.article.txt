# Overcrowding leaves ski trippers out in cold
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The removal of scores of students from
ski trip houses last weekend has left some
wondering whether more spacious hous
ing arrangements should be instituted in
the future.
The staff of East Florence Moore
Hall scrambled to find last-minute ac
commodations last weekend during
their trip to Lake Tahoe after Alondra,
Cardenal and Faisan were evicted from
their two houses.
Also, Arroyo was forced to obtain an
other rental house after locals threatened
legal action.
When East FloMo's buses unloaded in
front of the two houses they had rented, a
neighbor called to complain about the
noise.
Alondra Resident Computer Coordi
nator Peter Deng and Cardenal Struc
tured Liberal Education Tutor Justin
Rosenstein, both juniors, managed to
convince the police to allow the students
to stay, Rosenstein said.
"We didn't get kicked out right away,
but they did demand to count how many
people were in the house and that we re
duce the number to what was the number
on the contract," said Genny Guzman, a
resident assistant in Alondra, about a rep
resentative sent to investigate the rental
house.
Although the extra people were forced
out of the two houses, they were not with
out shelter for the night.
"Peter and I managed to negotiate to
get two extra houses, which was not an
ideal solution because it means our party
was divided into four, but at least we
weren't out in the cold that night," Rosen
stein said.
The company rented the two extra
houses for only one night.
"The next morning we went to the cor
porate headquarters, basically, and they
told us there was no way in hell they were
going to let us spend the next night,"
Rosenstein said.
Rosenstein and Guzman said the com
pany agreed to refund the money for the
second night's rental.
"We kept basically climbing the corpo
rate ladder trying to negotiate with some
one until the company co-owner said that
we had ruined the company's reputation,"
Rosenstein said. "He refused to speak to
us. It was possible that they were going to
get sued and lose their license."

Rosenstein and Guzman, who served
as spokespeople on behalf of the staffs of
the three dorms regarding the matter, de
clined to name the company, citing legal
reasons.
The three dorms were able to rent out
an entire hotel for the next night.
"The upside of this was since we had
the hotel to ourselves, there were no noise
restrictions," Rosenstein said. "I think
most of the students agreed that the hotel
was actually better. Not only was it totally
legal, but everyone was together, more or
less, and [there were] big areas for every
one to get together, huge rooms for them
to stay in, and everyone had a bed."
These were not the only benefits of
renting out the hotel, according to
Guzman.

"There were no lines for the bathroom,
and we didn't have to worry about getting
caught," Guzman quipped.
Rosenstein said that Stanford should
modify its tradition of squeezing stu
dents into houses too small to accommo
date them.
"P think that the Stanford tradition
should change from this highly illegal
practice that has the potential to ruin
people's ski trips to something which is
actually better, in our opinion," Rosen
stein said.
Guzman said that the trip was very
stressful for staff members who had to
make alternate plans for the dorms, and
that this stress can easily be avoided in the
future by abiding by rental contracts.
"I think this has the potential to change

how ski trips are organized and run be
cause we took a chance on the system that
had mostly worked in the past," Guzman
said. "We got in big trouble and had to do
a lot of scrambling so that many people
could still have a successful ski trip. The
staff was working the whole time to try to
accommodate us because we'd violated
the contracts, essentially."
Rosenstein said he did not assign
blame to anyone for the incident.
"I don't think anyone was at fault in the
situation, really, except for the Stanford
tradition," Rosenstein added. "The rental
company was in the right to say we were in
breach of contract under the assumptions
they were making about how many people

Trying to economize, dorms tend to squeeze more students than allowed into rental houses during their ski trips. Last weekend, stu
dents from Arroyo and East FloMo were forced to find other accommodations after being asked to leave for having too many peo-
[there would be]. The neighbor was
in his right to complain that there
were all these college kids running
around right next door to him, and he
knew that that wasn't cool."
Meanwhile, Arroyo tried lodging
43 people in a 20-person house, elic
iting threats of legal action.
"The neighbors around us called

the rental agency and reported us,"
said junior Kristen Carothers, Ar
royo's peer health educator. "They
threatened to call their lawyers on
the following Monday."
Arroyo was given the option of ei
ther leaving or renting another house
several miles away. They opted for
the latter and split their group.
"We decided we'd rather contin
ue our trip than leave early,"
Carothers said. "The rental agency
was very helpful and offered the best
help they could, given that the peo
ple in Tahoe are trying to shut down

their business."
Carothers said that she believes
residents of Tahoe seek to reduce
the area's emphasis on tourism.
"Many of the people who actual
ly live in Tahoe are trying to ban va
cation rentals, because they believe
that the groups who travel there do
more harm than good," she said.
Rosenstein warned future snow
trip planners about putting too many
students in a house.
"It's not worth it to take that risk,
especially when there's a superior al
ternative," he said.
