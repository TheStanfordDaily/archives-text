# VIRTUAL REALITY CHECK
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
It's a beautiful day in Alphaville. The birds are chirping, kids are running
through the grass ... the prostitutes are working their corners. Where does such
a Utopia exist, you ask? Where

else but your computer?
Sorry to disappoint, but Al
phaville is just the biggest of sever
al simulated towns that make up
the world of the popular Internet
game "The Sims Online." Owned
and managed by Electronic Arts,
the game allows literally thou
sands of people to live as comput
erized characters of their own de
sign. Sims eat, sleep, shower,
dance, marry, reproduce ... the
list goes on and on. Gone are the
days when people fired up com
puter games to skip out on wash
ing the dishes or vacuuming the
living room. These chores have ac
tually become part of the fun.
But "The Sims Online" is not
the only massively multiplayer
role-playing game out there. In
fact, it's trumped by the complex
medieval adventure "Everquest,"
a game so addictive it has been
fondly nicknamed Ever-crack.
"The Sims" empire may have a
population of 80,000, but that's
nothing compared to the 430,000
subscribers currently hooked on
"Quest."
So who are all these people?
Teenage boys, right? Guys who
rather slay dragons or date the vir
tual babe down the street than try
out for the soccer team? Well, no.
Actually the average age for
gamers is 26. And, while more
males romp around the kingdoms
of "Everquest," 60 percent of the
people who play "The Sims On
line" are women. Many of these
people have jobs, families, pets,
mortgages, yet they somehow find
time to play games 22 hours a
week.
Still, 22 hours doesn't seem like
so giuch if you're leading a double
life as a CEO, a lounge singer or a
Mafioso (just a few of the occupa
tions available for your Sims). The
Sims franchise, initially developed
by Maxis, has been around for sev
eral years, including countless
game packs and updates including
Sims Vacation, Hot Date and The
Sims Livin' Large. Each update
granted Sims more capabilities,

more furniture to own, more clothes to buy, more things to do with your new Sim
pals.
Why would people rather inhabit a world of pixels? After all, you can't taste the
brownish blobs that represent food, or feel the air-jet bubbles in your new heart
shaped Jacuzzi. What's the point?
"People have a chance to enter a world with comparatively little in the way of
established power structures and institutions, at least in comparison to the real
world," says sophomore Max Etchemendy, who doesn't play RPG games himself
but thinks they serve a purpose for the'masses searching for a gaming fix. "I've
heard that rooms full of players bow to very powerful characters that enter. The
chance to acquire that kind of respect within a subculture no doubt holds some ap
peal."
"The Sims Online" was just the next logical step for the Maxis moguls, allowing
players to work real jobs, visit each other's houses and even speak to each other by
typing messages in little word bubbles above their Sims' heads.
What wasn't predictable was the development of a seedy underbelly in what
was intended to be the cyberspace version of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. Alphav
ille is home to brothels, casinos, a growing organized crime ring and even a district
for what has been termed the Bondage, Discipline and Sadomasochism communi
ty-

The situation is almost laughable. Even more so, when you learn that a visit to
Buxom Bertha, the local prostitute entails a slow dance and a nap, with both char
acters trading sexually explicit phrases a la word bubble.
At the same time, the more sketchy aspects of the game do have real world con
sequences. Right now, the story steaming up the virtual pages of the Alphaville
Herald exposes several underage gamers (a few as young as 13) who have been act-

ing as prostitutes. Turning a trick
earns these "girls" up to 500,000
simoleons, which translates roughly
into $l5. Little better than Monopoly
money, right? Well, yes, until people
started selling simoleons on e√üay for
real cash. Just to give you a taste, an
electronic pet cheetah sold for $25 on
the Internet auction site.
The New York Times recently ran a
story about the editor of the Alphav
ille Herald, real-life philosophy pro
fessor Peter Ludlow, who was kicked
out of the game for calling attention
to these disturbing details. Ludlow
supposedly accused Electronic Arts
of overlooking some of the more
morally questionable goings on. Ap
parently, he was evicted from his
house, had his furniture confiscated
and even had to big goodbye to his
two cats. Someone pass the tissue.
In truth, censorship would be bad
news for sales. How can you limit a
product that succeeds because it al
lows people do things they would
never dream of in real life? Many
have questioned the influence of vio
lence in games like Everquest on the
human psyche. Yet very few have
batted an eyelash at the sexual con
tent of games like "The Sims On
line." After all, no one is going to
identify him or herself as a minor if
applying for a job at the Hotel Eroti
ca. *
Salon.com recently ran a series of ar
ticles investigating The Sims and the
damage it might be waging on the di
vide between fantasy and reality.
Writer Janelle Brown speculated on
what people's actions in the game say
about human nature.
"We want to see tiny humans attack
ing each other, having sex, feeling
sick and neglecting their children-liv
ing out the malicious fantasies that
we ourselves must repress everyday,"
she writes. "If everything runs
smoothly, after all, there's no fun in
playing God."
As of now, the sky's the limit for
games such as The Sims and Ev
erquest. The graphics will no doubt
become more sophisticated, more ac
tion will be available and whole new
worlds will be born out of those that

currently exist.
While some think that the boundless opportunities in the RPG business will
eventually lead to a Matrix-type future where people drool into their keyboards
while raising a family in the main-frame, others believe these games are just a flash
in the pan. They'll hold the public's attention for a short period before fading into
the many thousands of other games that decorate the shelves at Best Buy.
There are arguments on both sides of the issue. Some corporations have con
sidered using software like "The Sims Online" to train employees in strategic
thinking. Technology pundits believe some aspects of these games help people
who might otherwise have trouble to build strong social connections where they re
ceive comfort and acceptance.
"What is unique about a good RPG is that it brings people with very different
motivations together," says graduate student Nick Yee, who is teaching an Ev
erquest-focused component of the Stanford class History of Computer Design. "It
creates connections that allow them to collaborate to achieve common goals."
So next time your organic chemistry study group calls you up to meet, maybe
you should ask them if they'd rather talk over amino acids while taking a dip in
your Olympic sized pool. Then again, you could just tell them you can't make it be
cause the baby won't stop crying and you promised your wife you'd mow the lawn
before she got home. Wouldn't be lying, would it?
