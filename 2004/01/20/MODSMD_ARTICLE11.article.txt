### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
As more and more Stanford students
are getting infected by the flu, many have
taken extreme caution to avoid the plague.
One resident actually suggested to me that
people might have picked up the disease
while reliving themselves in bathrooms.
This thought alarmed me to the possibility
of getting infected on bathroom stalls and
got me thinking about the best strategy to
pick the appropriate stall in order to mini
mize the risk of coming down with the
plague.
Intuition tells me that one should pick
the stall least used by her fellow residents.
The less a stall is utilized, the less infectious
viruses and germs should be spread on the
stall. However, how does one pick the most
"unpopular" stall? Different people have
different preferences on stalls: Some love
the spacious stalls for the handicapped;
some are accustomed to using the inner
most stalls as they provide a sense of secu
rity; others, on the other hand, like sitting
on stalls closest to the window (to avoid ol
factory suffering). There doesn't seem to

be a type of stall that caters to everybody's
taste. Even if there is one such type that at
tracts more users than others, its populari
ty would not last, either. Its frequent uti
lization will eventually lead to littering and
smell that are more prominent than the less
frequently used ones, hence driving its po
tential users away.
So it seems that the approach of identi
fying the least used stall beforehand is in
feasible. How about randomly selecting a
stall, then? In order to deduce a strategy*of
stall choice that will minimize one's proba
bility of getting infected, let's make the fol
lowing assumptions. Since nobody knows
how likely it is to get infected on any of the
stalls and hence everybody employs more
or less stable strategies when choosing
which one to sit on, we can assume that the
probability of getting infected on each of
the stalls is static (it stays the same over
time). For the purpose of illustration, we
can further simplify our model by assuming
that there are only two stalls in the bath
room, A and B. The central question, then,
becomes, how should one decide which
stall to sit on without knowing the two
stalls' respective probabilities of infecting

their users with some virulent disease?
Suppose the probability for stall A to in
fect its user is a and that for stall B is b. As
sume further that the user will enter the
bathroom twice. She could employ one of
the following strategies:
1. Each time she enters the bathroom,
toss a coin. If it's head, use stall A; if it's tail,
use stall B.
2. The first time she enters the bath
room, toss a coin. If it's head, use stall A
and stick with it the second time as well.
Otherwise, if it's tail, use stall B both times.
3. Use stall A the first time and stall B
the second time.
With the first stategy, one of the follow
ing four cases could result with equal likeli
hood: She uses stall A both times; she uses
stall B both times; she uses A the first time,
B the second time; and she uses B the first
time, A the second time. The probabilities
of not getting infected in each of the above
cases are, (l-a) A 2, (l-b) A 2, (l-a)(l-b), (1-
b)(l-a). Hence, the total probability of not
getting infected is l/4*(l-a) A2+l/4*(l

b) A 2+l/4*(l-a)(l-b)+l/4*(l-b)(l-a).
With the second strategy, one of the fol
lowing two cases occurs with equal likeli
hood: she uses stall A both times or she
uses stall B both times. The probability of
not getting infected in the first case is (1-
a) A 2 and that for the second case is (1-b) A 2.
TTie total probability of not getting infected
for this strategy is l/2*(l-a) A 2+l/2(l-b) A 2.
With the third strategy, the probability
of not getting infected should be (l-a)(l-b).
The actual comparison of these three
probabilities involves expanding the for
mulae. For the sake of simplicity, let's plug
in a=o.l and b=o.2. The three probabilities
turn out to be .7225, .725, and .72. Hence
forth, employing the second strategy ren
ders the highest probability of not getting
infected. So it seems that one should ran
domly choose a bathroom stall and stick
with it during her entire stay in the dorm.
