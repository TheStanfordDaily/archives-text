## Candidates must mobilize youth 
### 
As appalling as it may sound, only eight per
cent of individuals between the ages of 18
to 29 took the time to vote in 2000 presi
dential primaries that were held before
March 7. Needless to say, this is nothing short of an
embarrassment to democracy.
We believe that it is important for all young voters
to exercise their right to voice their respective opin
ions on how our government should function. How
ever, it is also the responsibility of political candidates
to ensure that they address the concerns of all cross
sections of the population. Historically, presidential
hopefuls have paid little attention to young voters, as
candidates have typically operated off the assumption
that there is no reason to cater to a group that will de
liver minimal support on election day. However, cur
rent Democratic primary contenders such as Howard
Dean and Dennis Kucinich, among others, have made
special efforts this year to deal with the issues on

younger voters' minds. These efforts have paid off.
With John Kerry's surprise win last night in lowa,
it seems that "Hurricane" Howard's momentum has
slowed. However, Dean remains a viable nominee
candidate in many people's eyes, and this can largely
be attributed to his grassroots support â€”mostly com
posed of young, enthusiastic campaign volunteers.
Other Democratic contenders and President Bush
should pay attention to this broad base of support that
escalated Dean from being a "nobody" to a candidate
favored by many to win the Democratic primaries.
We agree that college-aged students need to in
volve themselves in the political process to a greater
extent. Voting is a right that should not be taken light
ly. But also, we think that candidates should give
young voters more reason to get involved. As individ
uals such as Dean and Kucinich have demonstrated,
targeting young voters does not only enhance democ
racy, but it likewise enhances one's electoral chances.
