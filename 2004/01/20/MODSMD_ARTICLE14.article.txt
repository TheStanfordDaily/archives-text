# OPINIONS
## WELCOME TO WALLACE WORLD We must realize MLK's dream 
### 
A few years back, I found myself
on a dusty road in Guinea Sta
tion, Va. It's a one stop-sign
town of a couple hundred peo
ple that could be characterized as the
wrong side of the tracks except the whole
town is built almost on top of the railroad
tracks.
The railroad is the only reason the
shabby settlement exists at all—just a
handful of dilapidated homes, lived in by
the same handful of families for more
than a hundred years. Guinea Station is
noted only for its poverty and backward
thinking, which is saying something in
southern Virginia.
My job as a census counter brought
me to the area my first visit and I
was busy accounting for every resident
when I saw two children, arms laced
around each other's shoulders, walking
down the middle of the street. They didn't
hear my car until I was right beside them,
and giggling they ran ahead, a little tow
headed white child and a little black child.
In a place renowned for racism, it
struck me that I had just seen the realiza
tion of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. If
equality could have found root even in
Guinea Station, then I believe a truly col
orblind society is within grasp.
It's been 35 years since MLK's assassi
nation, since the time when the dream he
spoke so passionately about was just that
in many parts of the country. But because
of MLK's original approach to a very un
original problem that crops up over and
over in history, America is different. The
playing field, to borrow that overworked
expression, has been leveled in many
places. More black Americans are en
rolled in college than any other time; the

corporate world and even a Republican
president's cabinet reflect the different

races of America.
And while the
image of the two chil
dren happily playing
unaware ofracial prej
udice would please
MLK, most of the
other race statistics
would certainly not
encourage the cham
pion of civil rights.
Some of the im
provements of the

Civil Rights movement have actually
eroded since the 1960s while others statis
tics have barely budged in the intervening
decades.
For instance, the typical white family
household is worth more than six times the
average black household. Black unemploy
ment is twice the rate of white unemploy
ment right now a larger gap than during
King's campaign. Black infants are more
than twice as likely to die before their first
birthday, showing a drop in black infant
mortality rates in the last several decades.
For every dollar of white per-capita
income, African Americans had 55 cents
in 1968. Now that number has increased
by two lousy pennies. At this pace, it
would take blacks 581 years to get the re
maining 43 cents.
The statistics are even more dismal if
you look at prison sentences and the great
number of African American men who
waste their fives behind bars. If current
rates of incarceration continue, one out of
three African American males born
today will be imprisoned at some point
during their lifetimes.

Home ownership, though improving
for whites by 10 percent since 1970, (from
65 percent to 75 percent) has only risen
from 42 percent to 48 percent for blacks.
And according to a study released by
the Harvard Civil Rights Project, schools
are just as segregated today as they were
in 1969. Over the last 15 years, progress
has wound backwards and white students
have "little contact" with minority stu
dents in many parts of the country.
These discouraging statistics aren't
meant to take anything away from the
man we celebrated yesterday or the cause
he spent his days and his life fur
thering. But I wonder how MLK would
prefer we celebrate his memory.
I'm not crazy enough to think that all
problems can be solved by the govern
ment, but what if instead of a day off
work, all branches of the government
spent one day considering ways to even
the disparity between whites and blacks
in this country? I know. It's just a silly and
naive thought, but as important as it is to
run MLK's speeches on television during
his holiday, I wish we'd spend that time
talking about the parts of the dream that
are not yet realized.
Americans are so anxious about race,
that honest discussion, free of politicking
and sensationalism rarely occurs. In my
mind, this is the "dream" MLK envi
sioned for his children. A government
holiday is a nice and a fitting honor for his
work, but I believe a more fitting memo
rial would be to follow King's lead and
employ some original thinking to sort out
some of these unoriginal problems.

today will be imprisoned at some point
during their lifetimes.

Home ownership, though improving
for whites by 10 percent since 1970, (from
65 percent to 75 percent) has only risen
from 42 percent to 48 percent for blacks.

the Harvard Civil Rights Project, schools

I'm not crazy enough to think that all
problems can be solved by the govern
ment, but what if instead of a day off
work, all branches of the government
spent one day considering ways to even
the disparity between whites and blacks
in this country? I know. It's just a silly and
naive thought, but as important as it is to
run MLK's speeches on television during
his holiday, I wish we'd spend that time
talking about the parts of the dream that
are not yet realized.
Americans are so anxious about race,
that honest discussion, free of politicking
and sensationalism rarely occurs. In my
mind, this is the "dream" MLK envi
sioned for his children. A government
holiday is a nice and a fitting honor for his
work, but I believe a more fitting memo
rial would be to follow King's lead and
employ some original thinking to sort out
some of these unoriginal problems.

A few years back, I found myself
on a dusty road in Guinea Sta
tion, Va. It's a one stop-sign
town of a couple hundred peo
ple that could be characterized as the
wrong side of the tracks except the whole
town is built almost on top of the railroad
tracks.
The railroad is the only reason the
shabby settlement exists at all—just a
handful of dilapidated homes, lived in by
the same handful of families for more
than a hundred years. Guinea Station is
noted only for its poverty and backward
thinking, which is saying something in
southern Virginia.
My job as a census counter brought
me to the area my first visit and I
was busy accounting for every resident
when I saw two children, arms laced
around each other's shoulders, walking
down the middle of the street. They didn't
hear my car until I was right beside them,
and giggling they ran ahead, a little tow
headed white child and a little black child.
In a place renowned for racism, it
struck me that I had just seen the realiza
tion of Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream. If
equality could have found root even in
Guinea Station, then I believe a truly col
orblind society is within grasp.
It's been 35 years since MLK's assassi
nation, since the time when the dream he
spoke so passionately about was just that
in many parts of the country. But because
of MLK's original approach to a very un
original problem that crops up over and
over in history, America is different. The
playing field, to borrow that overworked
expression, has been leveled in many
places. More black Americans are en
rolled in college than any other time; the

corporate world and even a Republican
president's cabinet reflect the different

races of America.
And while the
image of the two chil
dren happily playing
unaware ofracial prej
udice would please
MLK, most of the
other race statistics
would certainly not
encourage the cham
pion of civil rights.
Some of the im
provements of the

Civil Rights movement have actually
eroded since the 1960s while others statis
tics have barely budged in the intervening
decades.
For instance, the typical white family
household is worth more than six times the
average black household. Black unemploy
ment is twice the rate of white unemploy
ment right now a larger gap than during
King's campaign. Black infants are more
than twice as likely to die before their first
birthday, showing a drop in black infant
mortality rates in the last several decades.
For every dollar of white per-capita
income, African Americans had 55 cents
in 1968. Now that number has increased
by two lousy pennies. At this pace, it
would take blacks 581 years to get the re
maining 43 cents.
The statistics are even more dismal if
you look at prison sentences and the great
number of African American men who
waste their fives behind bars. If current
rates of incarceration continue, one out of
three African American males born
today will be imprisoned at some point
during their lifetimes.
