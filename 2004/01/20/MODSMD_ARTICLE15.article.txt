## A 						lesson in journalistic integrity 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Pete Rose's "admission" to a high
school journalism class that he bet on
baseball one year before he came clean
in his autobiography and the decision
by that school's editorial staff not to print
the story should be required reading
at every journalism school in this coun
try. Apparently, high school journalists
can teach the big boys a thing or two
when it comes to ethics.
The real story is not what Rose said
or when he said it. After all, it really
doesn't matter much whether Rose lied
for 13 or 14 years about betting on base
ball. Similarly, his acknowledgment to
the class is somewhat ambiguous. Rose
posed the question to himself: "You
mean, why did I bet on baseball?" He
answered: "Well it was because I made
mistakes." Rose then went on to admit
betting on football without directly re
ferring to the baseball bets.
Veteran editors would no doubt cas
tigate reporters for failing to ask Rose
follow-up questions to clarify the base
ball betting. Even if Rose had refused to
elaborate or attempted to deny the
videotaped comments, the school's
newspaper, The Calabasas Courier, had
plenty of material to run what would
have been a major national news story.
At the least, the story would have
brought Calabasas High School a great

deal of recognition and possibly some fi
nancial opportunities. But the newspa
per's editors chose not to run the story
because they couldn't be sure that what
Rose said wasn't just a "slip of the
tongue."
Even more pointedly, The Mercury
News Wire Service reported that the for
mer co-editor in chief Nick Reder said
that his paper's editorial board decided
against publishing Rose's comment "out
of respect for Rose, who appeared be
fore the journalism class because he was
friends with one student's father." In
other words, the newspaper made a con
scious decision to bury a really big story
for ethical reasons.
The lesson strikes at the ethics that
regularly confront news reporting
sources. Newspapers must constantly
balance the public's right to know and
the paper's desire to sell its product
against responsibly reporting the news,
particularly when those reports can po
tentially harm sources. Newspapers fre
quently manipulate the news by includ
ing partial quotes that may or may not
convey the sense of what the author of
those quotes intended. The public editor
of The New York Times, Daniel Okrent,
referred to just such a phenomenon in an
editorial in that paper ("The quote, the
whole quote and nothing but the quote,"
Jan. 4). The Times, in reporting a speech
by President Bush, had dropped the pref

acing words "if necessary" in a statement
the president made. Those words were
important to understand the context of
his speech, and The Times rectified its
omission by printing a correction several
days later. Okrent suggests, however,
that The Times' response may have been
inadequate to fully repair the damage
done.
The San Jose Mercury News is guilty
of the same omission in the headline to
its story about Rose and the high school
("Rose told students in 'O2: 'I bet on
baseball,'" Jan. 16). Although the story
goes on to make clear that the quote to
the students was not a declarative one by
Rose but merely part of a question, the
headlining intent, to titillate readers, is
misleading. While the reporting does no
harm to its principles, it does leave the
paper open to charges of misrepresenta
tion by taking quotes "out of context."
My intent, though, is not to specifical
ly chide The Mercury News for its head
line, but to commend Calabasas High
Schools' editors for refusing to run the
story. Unlike the headline in The San
Diego Union-Tribune, "Did the school
miss Rose scoop in '02?" I would prefer
to think that the real scoop is that the high
school demonstrated a level of integrity
that established papers might emulate.
