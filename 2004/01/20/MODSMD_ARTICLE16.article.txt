Headscarf can be seen as
'demeaning' to Muslim women

Although I personally wholeheart
edly agree with Maha Amin Ezzed
dine's discussion on individual freedom
and rights ("Chirac shouldn't seek
headscarf ban," Jan. 16), I do question
the claim made on the functions of the
headscarf: "More than just a religious
symbol, the headscarf safeguards the
purity and self-respect highly valued by
Muslim women. The scarf functions in
two worlds; an act of devotion to God
and a practical manner of ensuring re
spect and protection outside of the
home, at school and in the workplace."
By questioning this statement, by no
means am I saying that Muslim women
should not be allowed to wear the head
scarf. In present-day France, I just do not
understand how the headscarf functions
in safeguarding the purity and self-re
spect of a Muslim woman or protects her
in any manner. I recognize it as a sacred
religious symbol and an embodiment of
a right to freedom of religion or cultural
preservation. At the same time, I think
that the issue of the headscarf is more
complicated than that.
Based on Ezzeddine's argument, I
understood that individual liberty
should not be denied on any basis.
Fair enough. But I think examining
France's secularism and I'd like to
clarify, not the denial of one religion's
rights is a historical irony and re
sponse worth examining. It may be
based in a fear of religious fanaticism.
Yes, this still doesn't justify the limi
tations placed on the liberty of Muslim
women. But some could make the argu

ment that in limiting the role of religion,
an arbitrary factor at birth (you don't
choose the family that you are born
into), officials are allowing room for
growth of schoolchildren in a religion
free environment. Do all schoolchildren
have enough knowledge on religious
choice, history and practices to under
stand the choice between wearing a
headscarf or not? Some may, but others
may have been forced into the practice
by their families. French officials may
point out that within the confines of their
own homes, these families can teach re
ligion and can be religious, still inculcat
ing these children with religious values.
I argue that France sees something
dangerous in the headscarf. Again, I be
lieve that a woman should have the
choice to wear the headscarf. On the
flipside though, I think that what they
fear of the headscarf is embodied above,
and a point that should not be rashly dis
counted: If a headscarf does protect
women or symbolizes self-respect, why
not force all Muslim women to wear it?
Personally, I think the headscarf is
what one makes of it. For one, it may
represent some display of piety that she
equates with self-resp'ect. But for oth
ers, it places the burden of a woman's
protection on herself. It holds her ac
countable for the way people treat her
and view her. For some women, it rep
resents a forced cultural symbol of
modesty in today's world. Why should a
woman have to cover to feel modest, re
spected or protected? Why not hold the
perpetrator accountable? Why should
a headscarf be needed to earn respect in
some Muslim circles? I find that there is
something inherently demeaning in

such an idea and just wanted to give you
something to think about regarding the
implications of the freedom itself.

Daily has 'personal vendetta'
against Senior Class Presidents

Apparently, The Daily has a per
sonal vendetta against Senior Class
Presidents Ryan Taylor, Mary Him
menkool and Mikey Lee. What else
could explain their continued imma
ture and inappropriate attacks?
In their recent editorial, editors
correlated the absence of a pub night
with Fernandez's "quarter-off" status
("It ain't right to nix Pub Night," Jan.
15). I'd like to go on the record to say
that I'm completely satisfied with the
Senior Class Presidents and their cab
inet's commitment to providing the
Senior Class with quality events.
Maybe the last line of last Thurs
day's editorial was most telling of the
personal politics beneath the surface
of these editorials. The editors are still
lingering over the election results with
the frustration of a Florida Democrat.
They say: "Such cockiness seems odd
considering that in last year's election,
the current class presidents who ran as
'Fire it up,' beat out at least four other
slates by only a few votes. Clearly
there were many people who wanted
to serve as senior class presidents."
I think those people are in office.

Maybe the last line of last Thurs

personal politics beneath the surface
of these editorials. The editors are still
lingering over the election results with
the frustration of a Florida Democrat.
They say: "Such cockiness seems odd

the current class presidents who ran as
'Fire it up,' beat out at least four other
slates by only a few votes. Clearly
there were many people who wanted
to serve as senior class presidents."
I think those people are in office.

Headscarf can be seen as
'demeaning' to Muslim women

Although I personally wholeheart
edly agree with Maha Amin Ezzed
dine's discussion on individual freedom
and rights ("Chirac shouldn't seek
headscarf ban," Jan. 16), I do question
the claim made on the functions of the
headscarf: "More than just a religious
symbol, the headscarf safeguards the
purity and self-respect highly valued by
Muslim women. The scarf functions in
two worlds; an act of devotion to God
and a practical manner of ensuring re
spect and protection outside of the
home, at school and in the workplace."
By questioning this statement, by no
means am I saying that Muslim women
should not be allowed to wear the head
scarf. In present-day France, I just do not
understand how the headscarf functions
in safeguarding the purity and self-re
spect of a Muslim woman or protects her
in any manner. I recognize it as a sacred
religious symbol and an embodiment of
a right to freedom of religion or cultural
preservation. At the same time, I think
that the issue of the headscarf is more
complicated than that.
Based on Ezzeddine's argument, I
understood that individual liberty
should not be denied on any basis.
Fair enough. But I think examining
France's secularism and I'd like to
clarify, not the denial of one religion's
rights is a historical irony and re
sponse worth examining. It may be
based in a fear of religious fanaticism.
Yes, this still doesn't justify the limi
tations placed on the liberty of Muslim
women. But some could make the argu

ment that in limiting the role of religion,
an arbitrary factor at birth (you don't
choose the family that you are born
into), officials are allowing room for
growth of schoolchildren in a religion
free environment. Do all schoolchildren
have enough knowledge on religious
choice, history and practices to under
stand the choice between wearing a
headscarf or not? Some may, but others
may have been forced into the practice
by their families. French officials may
point out that within the confines of their
own homes, these families can teach re
ligion and can be religious, still inculcat
ing these children with religious values.
I argue that France sees something
dangerous in the headscarf. Again, I be
lieve that a woman should have the
choice to wear the headscarf. On the
flipside though, I think that what they
fear of the headscarf is embodied above,
and a point that should not be rashly dis
counted: If a headscarf does protect
women or symbolizes self-respect, why
not force all Muslim women to wear it?
Personally, I think the headscarf is
what one makes of it. For one, it may
represent some display of piety that she
equates with self-resp'ect. But for oth
ers, it places the burden of a woman's
protection on herself. It holds her ac
countable for the way people treat her
and view her. For some women, it rep
resents a forced cultural symbol of
modesty in today's world. Why should a
woman have to cover to feel modest, re
spected or protected? Why not hold the
perpetrator accountable? Why should
a headscarf be needed to earn respect in
some Muslim circles? I find that there is
something inherently demeaning in

such an idea and just wanted to give you
something to think about regarding the
implications of the freedom itself.

Daily has 'personal vendetta'
against Senior Class Presidents

Apparently, The Daily has a per
sonal vendetta against Senior Class
Presidents Ryan Taylor, Mary Him
menkool and Mikey Lee. What else
could explain their continued imma
ture and inappropriate attacks?
In their recent editorial, editors
correlated the absence of a pub night
with Fernandez's "quarter-off" status
("It ain't right to nix Pub Night," Jan.
15). I'd like to go on the record to say
that I'm completely satisfied with the
Senior Class Presidents and their cab
inet's commitment to providing the
Senior Class with quality events.
