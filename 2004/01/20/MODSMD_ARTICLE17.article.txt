# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Bush's new target: 'Ares of Evil' 
### 
I have to disagree with Friday's edito
rial ("Mars mission has us seeing
red," Jan. 16). It is imperative that
President Bush spend oodles of tax
payers' money on a mission to Mars. Let
me explain.
It's not The Daily's fault, but they lack
access to highly classified documents.
Thus, their editorial did not have all the
facts. As a humor columnist, I am privy to
information of the most sensitive level of
national security. Therefore, for the first
time ever, I reveal to you these startling
facts: Sources in the CIA now are certain
that despite not finding Osama Bin
Laden anywhere on the planet Earth, he
must be hiding somewhere on Mars.
Calm down, the president is taking steps
to remedy the situation. President Bush is
calling for bipartisan support in this new
front of the war on terror.
Bush wants to rearrange the NASA
budget to squeeze $ll billion for the pro
ject, and then raise NASA's budget by
another billion for the remainder. Most of
the money will go toward outfitting CIA
and FBI bureaucrats with pressure sensi
tive briefcases, so they can misplace files
and ignore each other on the Red Planet.
Also, Bush is looking into the practicality
of outfitting U.S. spacecraft with "spider
hole" penetrating bombs, equipped to
work in Mars' thin atmosphere. (This
columnist refuses to comment on the sex
ual innuendo of the last joke.)
There will be no place to hide for al
Qaeda and their Martian allies. Presi

dent Bush has issued an ultimatum:
"The Martian people must turn over all

information they
have on al Qaeda's
whereabouts, as
well as give all docu
ments regarding its
Weapons of Martian
Destruction pro
grams." If the Mar
tians do not comply
or if they don't re
spond— Bush will
call Howard Dean a
Martian and invade

both the Red Planet and Vermont.
As expected, many people disagree
with President Bush's plan to travel to /
invade Mars. The Daily proposes the idea
of making this planet a better one before
trying to explore others. Tree-hugging
liberals like them will probably point out
that it's bad enough that we blow up our
own planet, let alone somebody else's.
Let me assure you readers that Bush
hasn't screwed up a damn thing our
planet is fine and that we are perfectly
free to muck up somebody else's if we
want to. Even without U.N. approval.
On a basic level, what else do we have
to spend money on right now? I mean,
why not blast several billion bucks into
outer space? Should we tackle the soaring
Medicare costs? Reduce the deficit?
Fund the war on terror? Those are minor
problems; much less pressing than ex
ploring Mars. It's not like Medicare costs

will become unbearable to our genera
tion when baby boomers retire. Haha!
That would never happen. And it would
be so much cooler to see U.S. troopers
(equipped with lasers guns, of course)
searching for Bin Laden in a barren red
desert on Mars rather than in a barren
yellow desert in the Middle East.
Sure, in a recent Associated Press poll,
the majority of respondents revealed that
they would rather have the president
spend the money on domestic programs.
The minority, however, vehemently be
lieves we should go to Mars so that "we
can finally find Spock."
So, we'll be paying for a one-billion
dollar increase in NASA's budget for a
mission that is, we are assured, really ur
gent and necessary in this time of crisis.
We are also assured that the one billion
dollars that we will be shelling out will be
more than sufficient to get us to the moon
and to Mars. There is no reason to suspect
that NASA will require more, like it has
every other major project. There is also
no reason for environmentalists, mem
bers of our generation or charity organi
zations to be angry by the fact that Bush is
ignoring a strong percentage of Ameri
cans who object to this scheme.
And Mars: There is no reason to
worry. We come in peace.

invade Mars. The Daily proposes the idea
of making this planet a better one before
trying to explore others. Tree-hugging
liberals like them will probably point out
that it's bad enough that we blow up our
own planet, let alone somebody else's.
Let me assure you readers that Bush
hasn't screwed up a damn thing our
planet is fine and that we are perfectly
free to muck up somebody else's if we
want to. Even without U.N. approval.
On a basic level, what else do we have
to spend money on right now? I mean,
why not blast several billion bucks into
outer space? Should we tackle the soaring
Medicare costs? Reduce the deficit?
Fund the war on terror? Those are minor
problems; much less pressing than ex
ploring Mars. It's not like Medicare costs

will become unbearable to our genera
tion when baby boomers retire. Haha!
That would never happen. And it would
be so much cooler to see U.S. troopers
(equipped with lasers guns, of course)
searching for Bin Laden in a barren red
desert on Mars rather than in a barren
yellow desert in the Middle East.
Sure, in a recent Associated Press poll,
the majority of respondents revealed that
they would rather have the president
spend the money on domestic programs.
The minority, however, vehemently be
lieves we should go to Mars so that "we
can finally find Spock."
So, we'll be paying for a one-billion
dollar increase in NASA's budget for a
mission that is, we are assured, really ur
gent and necessary in this time of crisis.
We are also assured that the one billion
dollars that we will be shelling out will be
more than sufficient to get us to the moon
and to Mars. There is no reason to suspect
that NASA will require more, like it has
every other major project. There is also
no reason for environmentalists, mem
bers of our generation or charity organi
zations to be angry by the fact that Bush is
ignoring a strong percentage of Ameri
cans who object to this scheme.
And Mars: There is no reason to
worry. We come in peace.

Sophomore Chris Holt thinks Mars can
solve all our problems, from deficits to dat
ing. E-mail Chris at cholt@stanfordedu
