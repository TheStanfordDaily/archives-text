# RECCHIA'S REMARKS
## Learning to speak beyond 'geek' 
### 
People deprived of social interac
tion have been known to suffer
torturing anxiety, vivid hallucina
tions and violent insanity. So it's
no surprise that my own behavior under
went unsettling changes after my closest
companions departed for college last
September, leaving me alone to ponder
the cruelties of Stanford's quarter system.
My behavioral transformation began
innocently enough spending more
time on-line, reading more technical non
fiction but soon I noticed more drastic
changes. I found myself oft embrangled
in pointless but eternal AOL Instant
Messenger conversations, culminating in
exchanges of multifarious "smiley-faces."
I started hanging out with people who
own video game soundtracks and answer
"yes" to either-or questions. I began
dreaming in ASCII, the code that com
puters use to translate bits and bytes into
meaningful letters and symbols. When I
heard my parents use the words "com
puter algorithms" in a conversation about
what their son did for fun, I finally real
ized the awful truth: What had started out
as a few nerdish tendencies had blos
somed into full-fledged geekdom.
In the same way that a domesticated
lemur returns to a feral state when re
leased into the wild, I was reverting to my
natural techno-addict in the absence of
controlling factors such as peer pressure
and the instinct to impress women. With
hardly a week remaining before New Stu
dent Orientation, I was forced to ask my

self: Could I turn it around before I arrived
at Stanford? Or was I destined to kick off

the year as a social
outcast, wandering
the halls of Green Li
brary like a ghoulish
urban legend?
At first, it ap
peared that the latter
might be the case.
Stanford students
were a different
breed than I had en
countered in small
town Colorado.

They played sports with names like
"broomball" and "squash." They drank
Jamba Juice and ate Vietnamese food.
They somehow managed to get their
problem sets done before their 10 a.m.
Chem sections, regardless of how many
beers they'd chugged the night before.
Clearly, these people were cooler than I
was by several orders of magnitude. De
spite numerous dorm outings and group
activities early in the year, sometimes I
just didn't feel like part of the crowd.
After taking a few moments to reflect
over winter break, however, I realized
that perhaps other people weren't entire
ly to blame for my introversion. From
that point forward, I made valiant at
tempts to coerce my social butterfly out of
its comfortable cocoon. I went out for
Thai food, played an Xbox for the first
time in my life and just spent a lot more
time "hanging out," even if it meant en

during the sensational sounds of Wilbur
Dining's oft-skipping CD player. By actu
ally speaking with people rather than ad
dressing their digital avatars, I realized a
few valuable truths that I would never
have gleaned while staring at my comput
er monitor: First, that saying "LOL" in
genuine conversation garners weird
looks; and second, that everyone has dif
fering interests and idiosyncrasies, none
less valid than any other.
So what if I've seen Monty Python
and can quote bad translations of 'Bos
video games? It's a part of who I am, and
here it's no less socially acceptable than
my penchant for piano or my fondness for
cross-country racing. After a lifetime of
contending with the cliques and popular
ity contests of high school, I feel that Stan
ford is a place where I can "be myself'
and whoever doesn't like it can kiss my
ASCII. (I haven't met anyone who
doesn't like it yet.)
So although most of the broomball
playing, exotic-food-eating Jamba Juice
drinkers are way ahead of me, here's a tip
for any remaining late bloomers like my
self: There comes a time to put down the
books, ditch the computer and get to
know the people who might be your life
long friends if you just take the time to
say "hello."

After taking a few moments to reflect
over winter break, however, I realized
that perhaps other people weren't entire
ly to blame for my introversion. From
that point forward, I made valiant at
tempts to coerce my social butterfly out of
its comfortable cocoon. I went out for
Thai food, played an Xbox for the first
time in my life and just spent a lot more
time "hanging out," even if it meant en

during the sensational sounds of Wilbur
Dining's oft-skipping CD player. By actu
ally speaking with people rather than ad
dressing their digital avatars, I realized a
few valuable truths that I would never
have gleaned while staring at my comput
er monitor: First, that saying "LOL" in
genuine conversation garners weird
looks; and second, that everyone has dif
fering interests and idiosyncrasies, none
less valid than any other.
So what if I've seen Monty Python
and can quote bad translations of 'Bos
video games? It's a part of who I am, and
here it's no less socially acceptable than
my penchant for piano or my fondness for
cross-country racing. After a lifetime of
contending with the cliques and popular
ity contests of high school, I feel that Stan
ford is a place where I can "be myself'
and whoever doesn't like it can kiss my
ASCII. (I haven't met anyone who
doesn't like it yet.)
So although most of the broomball
playing, exotic-food-eating Jamba Juice
drinkers are way ahead of me, here's a tip
for any remaining late bloomers like my
self: There comes a time to put down the
books, ditch the computer and get to
know the people who might be your life
long friends if you just take the time to
say "hello."
