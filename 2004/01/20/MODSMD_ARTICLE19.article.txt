## Rest assured, Spencer's a much bigger idiot than you 
### 
U-w"say this with utmost certainty, the Ea-
I gles will be in the Super Bowl."
I Spencer Porter, Jan. 12,2004
Yeah yeah, that's right, the Eagles imploded,
a man who resembles a French fur trader (Koy
Detmer, honestly, the guy looks like the love
child of Bronson Pinchot and Pepe Le Pew)
played quarterback for the final drives of their
season and a team that went 1-15 two years ago is
going to the Super Bowl. I was wrong. I'm sorry.
You know friends, this is just a continuation
on a theme: I am not very bright. I have been told
this by many people, at various times, in various
situations, but honest to God, I am an idiot. Just
ask the sports teams at Stanford I've disparaged

(field hockey, water polo, foot
ball ...), my friends or any of
my ex-girlfriends, and they'll
all agree, I tend to say stupid
things.
At times, I get lucky. A stab
in the dark nails the donkey's
ass, finds the mark, hits the
proverbial bulls-eye if you will
(... and you will). And for
those of you who haven't
skipped past this column and

made it to the glorious land we like to call "the
crossword," enjoy Spencer's tale of woe that was
his weekend, because it's a doozy.
So it's Sunday afternoon, and I'm yet to taste
the defeat of Philadelphia. I go into my girl
friend's room (OK, so not really "girlfriend," be
cause we haven't had "the talk," but yes, we're
dating and yes, she's a girl, and that's good
enough for me). Anyway, she'll be called
"Cayenne," because, well, she's hot. (I know, I'm
so cute!)
Anyway, I walk into her room, past her empty
roommate's bed, briskly sweeping her off her
feet. I set her down on her bed as we start to cud
dle for a bit, because, well, I'm a sweetheart.
Now, I don't want to kiss and tell, but maybe we
were making out a little bit, maybe I was speak
ing rather loudly, and maybe we were having a
rather intimate conversation.
And when I say "we," I mean "I."
Because all the while, Cayenne was acting a
little weird. There I was, energetic, romantic, but
not really doing anything out of the ordinary for
a nice afternoon alone in her room. But she was
looking at me strangely, squirming away, looking
at me as if she was allergic to all things Spencer.
Finally, I got the message: She wants me to
leave, she's not happy, she wants her space. Fine.
I reluctantly released her from my tender grasp,
joking that I might just "accidentally" cop a feel
as I left, a running joke in our little relationship.
So as I got up to leave, "accidentally" letting a
hand linger where a middle school chaperone
would swat it away, I turned around just in time
to see her roommate oh-so awake, mouth agape,
eyes wider than naturally healthy, shocked be
yond comprehension.
Silence.
So hot right now. Like an idiot, so hot.
I am so incredibly stupid that I could not per
form the most basic of functions in a relationship
checking to see if the roommate is in the room.
It's almost as stupid as writing Stanford Daily
columns about embarrassing sexual situations
that you know your parents will read. Ahh, good
times.
But this was just the beginning of the day. Two
huge NFL Conference Championship games
were about to start, and I thought that maybe
they could salvage the day for me, validating my
two predictions in my last column (Patriots 19-7
and an Eagles win).
And at first, things started coming up
Spencer! Just as foretold here, the Patriots
rocked, shocked and clocked the Colts. The Pa
triot DBs cleaned out the Colts receivers,
Foxboro was rocking and Antowain Smith came
up with some huge plays in the open field. But
the stat of the game summed up how good the Pa
triots defense is: Peyton Manning completed as
many passes to Marvin Harrison (who is on his
team) as he did to Ty Law (who is not). That's
bad. But the Pats won 24-14, damn close to my
prediction. That's good!
But Fate is a devil mistress (did I just write,
"Fate is a devil mistress" in my column? I am
such a dork), and she tricked me! Riding high off
my Patriots win, I was envisioning a beautiful
Super Bowl of the Patriots blowing out an im
ploding Eagles team. I was watching Tom Brady
picking out receivers, Ty Law punishing Dono
van McNabb and Adam Vinatieri knocking
down clutch field goals left and right.
Then all of a sudden Pepe Le Detmer is on the
field, down 11 points, wearing a uniform that the
smelly kid on your little league team rocked
droopy, sagging, a helmet two sizes too big it
was a travesty. I mean, honestly, how is a guy sup
posed to inspire confidence during a fourth quar
ter drive when he looks like he forgot to do laun
dry for an entire season? Sure enough, Detmer
threw a pick with 5:16 left in the game, sealing a
game, season and roller-coaster day for me.
So who will win the big one? I'm going to say
the Patriots, but to tell the truth, Carolina scares
me. There's no telling what a focused side can do
in a pressure situation. Just look at the giraffe
from "Man vs. Beast," it just makes it tough for
me to bet against the animal kingdom after that
stellar performance.
But I'll take the Patriots in Houston, 30-13.

Because all the while, Cayenne was acting a
little weird. There I was, energetic, romantic, but
not really doing anything out of the ordinary for
a nice afternoon alone in her room. But she was
looking at me strangely, squirming away, looking
at me as if she was allergic to all things Spencer.
Finally, I got the message: She wants me to
leave, she's not happy, she wants her space. Fine.
I reluctantly released her from my tender grasp,
joking that I might just "accidentally" cop a feel
as I left, a running joke in our little relationship.
So as I got up to leave, "accidentally" letting a
hand linger where a middle school chaperone
would swat it away, I turned around just in time
to see her roommate oh-so awake, mouth agape,
eyes wider than naturally healthy, shocked be
yond comprehension.
Silence.
So hot right now. Like an idiot, so hot.
I am so incredibly stupid that I could not per
form the most basic of functions in a relationship
checking to see if the roommate is in the room.
It's almost as stupid as writing Stanford Daily
columns about embarrassing sexual situations
that you know your parents will read. Ahh, good
times.
But this was just the beginning of the day. Two
huge NFL Conference Championship games
were about to start, and I thought that maybe
they could salvage the day for me, validating my
two predictions in my last column (Patriots 19-7
and an Eagles win).
And at first, things started coming up
Spencer! Just as foretold here, the Patriots
rocked, shocked and clocked the Colts. The Pa
triot DBs cleaned out the Colts receivers,
Foxboro was rocking and Antowain Smith came
up with some huge plays in the open field. But
the stat of the game summed up how good the Pa
triots defense is: Peyton Manning completed as
many passes to Marvin Harrison (who is on his
team) as he did to Ty Law (who is not). That's
bad. But the Pats won 24-14, damn close to my
prediction. That's good!
But Fate is a devil mistress (did I just write,
"Fate is a devil mistress" in my column? I am
such a dork), and she tricked me! Riding high off
my Patriots win, I was envisioning a beautiful
Super Bowl of the Patriots blowing out an im
ploding Eagles team. I was watching Tom Brady
picking out receivers, Ty Law punishing Dono
van McNabb and Adam Vinatieri knocking
down clutch field goals left and right.
Then all of a sudden Pepe Le Detmer is on the
field, down 11 points, wearing a uniform that the
smelly kid on your little league team rocked
droopy, sagging, a helmet two sizes too big it
was a travesty. I mean, honestly, how is a guy sup
posed to inspire confidence during a fourth quar
ter drive when he looks like he forgot to do laun
dry for an entire season? Sure enough, Detmer
threw a pick with 5:16 left in the game, sealing a
game, season and roller-coaster day for me.
So who will win the big one? I'm going to say
the Patriots, but to tell the truth, Carolina scares
me. There's no telling what a focused side can do
in a pressure situation. Just look at the giraffe
from "Man vs. Beast," it just makes it tough for
me to bet against the animal kingdom after that
stellar performance.
But I'll take the Patriots in Houston, 30-13.

U-w"say this with utmost certainty, the Ea-
I gles will be in the Super Bowl."
I Spencer Porter, Jan. 12,2004
Yeah yeah, that's right, the Eagles imploded,
a man who resembles a French fur trader (Koy
Detmer, honestly, the guy looks like the love
child of Bronson Pinchot and Pepe Le Pew)
played quarterback for the final drives of their
season and a team that went 1-15 two years ago is
going to the Super Bowl. I was wrong. I'm sorry.
You know friends, this is just a continuation
on a theme: I am not very bright. I have been told
this by many people, at various times, in various
situations, but honest to God, I am an idiot. Just
ask the sports teams at Stanford I've disparaged

(field hockey, water polo, foot
ball ...), my friends or any of
my ex-girlfriends, and they'll
all agree, I tend to say stupid
things.
At times, I get lucky. A stab
in the dark nails the donkey's
ass, finds the mark, hits the
proverbial bulls-eye if you will
(... and you will). And for
those of you who haven't
skipped past this column and

made it to the glorious land we like to call "the
crossword," enjoy Spencer's tale of woe that was
his weekend, because it's a doozy.
So it's Sunday afternoon, and I'm yet to taste
the defeat of Philadelphia. I go into my girl
friend's room (OK, so not really "girlfriend," be
cause we haven't had "the talk," but yes, we're
dating and yes, she's a girl, and that's good
enough for me). Anyway, she'll be called
"Cayenne," because, well, she's hot. (I know, I'm
so cute!)
Anyway, I walk into her room, past her empty
roommate's bed, briskly sweeping her off her
feet. I set her down on her bed as we start to cud
dle for a bit, because, well, I'm a sweetheart.
Now, I don't want to kiss and tell, but maybe we
were making out a little bit, maybe I was speak
ing rather loudly, and maybe we were having a
rather intimate conversation.
And when I say "we," I mean "I."
Because all the while, Cayenne was acting a
