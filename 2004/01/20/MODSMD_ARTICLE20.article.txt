# No. 2 Stanford sneaks past Cal

### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Despite going up by 16 points Stan
ford's largest lead of the game with just
under six minutes remaining in the game, the
now second-ranked Cardinal (14-0,5-0 Pacific
10 Conference) didn't put the Golden Bears
(7-7,2-3) away until the game's final minute.
Sparked by a sudden offensive burst from
Cal's Richard Midgely who scored 14 of his
game-leading 19 points in the final five min
utes before fouling out with 17 seconds left
a young California team found itself within
four points of the Cardinal with 45 seconds re
maining on the clock.
"We're a team that echoes Richard," said
Cal head coach Ben Braun after his team's 68-
61 loss to Stanford on Saturday at Maples
Pavilion. "We have guys that battle, fight, play
hard [ ]Our guys came out with fire and we
showed it from the beginning to the end of the
game."
But even in the midst of Cal's 22-13 run to
end the game, Stanford still seemed to main
tain its poise, going 11-of-12 from the free
throw line in the game's final minutes. Stan
ford shot an impressive 89 percent (25-of-28)
from the charity stripe in the game.
"I was a little irritated that we missed those
three [free-throws]," Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said jokingly after the win.
"We shot free throws down the stretch, which
was critical."
Seniors Justin Davis, Matt Lottich, juniors
Rob Little and Josh Childress and redshirt
sophomore Chris Hernandez all hit big free
throws in the clutch, keeping the Bears from
overcoming the seven-point deficit that they
had accumulated in a low-scoring first half.
Stanford's stellar free throw shooting per
formance happened in light of a less than im
pressive first half offensive display.
It took a little more than four minutes be
fore the game's first field goal was scored a
fastbreak layup by junior swingman Nick
Robinson which he converted after stealing
the ball from a California guard. The layup

Stanford's 68-61 victory over California on Sat
urday wasn't very pretty by any stretch of the imag
ination, as both teams struggled offensively in a first
half that saw only 14 combined field goals.
But a win is a win, right?
Umm ... yeah.
In fact, this particular win, against this particular
Pac-10 foe, catapulted the still-undefeated (repeat:
still-undefeated) Cardinal into sole possession of
first place in the conference, a game ahead of
UCLA which split with the Arizona schools and
two games ahead of U of A, who beat up the Bruins
on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, after losing by nine
points to USC two days earlier.
Yeah, USC.
It makes Stanford's win over the Wildcats at
Tucson feel a little less glamorous doesn't it?
Well, it took a 40-point effort by Trojan guard
Desmon Farmer to ink the 99-90 USC upset. After
Farmer's inspiring performance against Arizona,
Arizona State beat the Trojans by 15 on Saturday.
So couple Arizona's consecutive Pac-10 losses
and then-No. 11 UNC's upset over then-No. 1 Con
necticut and what you've got is an undefeated Stan
ford team (emphasis on the undefeated) that is
ranked No. 2 in both polls today.
For the moment, Stanford's victory over Ari
zona resulted in a flurry of heightened national
media attention.
Right now, it's that zero in the Cardinal's loss
column that's got everyone talking and all the major
media outlets lining up for tickets (or press passes,
for that matter).
The Cardinal issued credentials to 79 mem
bers of the media for Saturday's contest against
Cal the second-most ever for a game at Maples
Pavilion.
"We haven't lost yet, which means we have done
a good job up to this point. That's all it means,"
Montgomery said. "It doesn't mean we're better
than anybody. It's not a burden, it's fun. I want to
win every game we play, but if we start thinking that
translates into something, then we're not going to
have much luck."

"I thought we fell prey to shots

Stanford went into the locker

fort.
The intensity was certainly

there, as both teams hustled and
dove for loose balls in front of a sell
out Maples crowd and a vocal Sixth
Man Club.
And while scoring picked up a
bit in the second half the Cardi
nal quickly jumped to a 14-point
lead after a few slashing layups from
Robinson and Davis, two Lottich 3-
pointers, a couple of dunks by Little
and a 15-foot pull-up jumper by se
nior center Joe Kirchofer it was
the free-throws that really cement
ed the deal down the stretch.
"Cal certainly wasn't intimidat
ed and played very well," Mont
gomery said. "They're good and
they're going to get better."
Childress played 27 minutes and
recorded a double-double for the
Cardinal (10 points and 10 re
bounds) in the victory. Lottich led
all Stanford scorers with 15 points
and Davis added 13 points and
seven boards.

utes before fouling out with 17 seconds left
a young California team found itself within
four points of the Cardinal with 45 seconds re
maining on the clock.
"We're a team that echoes Richard," said
Cal head coach Ben Braun after his team's 68-
61 loss to Stanford on Saturday at Maples
Pavilion. "We have guys that battle, fight, play
hard [ ]Our guys came out with fire and we
showed it from the beginning to the end of the
game."
But even in the midst of Cal's 22-13 run to
end the game, Stanford still seemed to main
tain its poise, going 11-of-12 from the free
throw line in the game's final minutes. Stan
ford shot an impressive 89 percent (25-of-28)
from the charity stripe in the game.
"I was a little irritated that we missed those
three [free-throws]," Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said jokingly after the win.
"We shot free throws down the stretch, which
was critical."
Seniors Justin Davis, Matt Lottich, juniors
Rob Little and Josh Childress and redshirt
sophomore Chris Hernandez all hit big free
throws in the clutch, keeping the Bears from
overcoming the seven-point deficit that they
had accumulated in a low-scoring first half.
Stanford's stellar free throw shooting per
formance happened in light of a less than im
pressive first half offensive display.
It took a little more than four minutes be
fore the game's first field goal was scored a
fastbreak layup by junior swingman Nick
Robinson which he converted after stealing
the ball from a California guard. The layup

Stanford's 68-61 victory over California on Sat
urday wasn't very pretty by any stretch of the imag
ination, as both teams struggled offensively in a first
half that saw only 14 combined field goals.
But a win is a win, right?
Umm ... yeah.
In fact, this particular win, against this particular
Pac-10 foe, catapulted the still-undefeated (repeat:
still-undefeated) Cardinal into sole possession of
first place in the conference, a game ahead of
UCLA which split with the Arizona schools and
two games ahead of U of A, who beat up the Bruins
on Saturday at Pauley Pavilion, after losing by nine
points to USC two days earlier.
Yeah, USC.
It makes Stanford's win over the Wildcats at
Tucson feel a little less glamorous doesn't it?
Well, it took a 40-point effort by Trojan guard
Desmon Farmer to ink the 99-90 USC upset. After
Farmer's inspiring performance against Arizona,
Arizona State beat the Trojans by 15 on Saturday.
So couple Arizona's consecutive Pac-10 losses
and then-No. 11 UNC's upset over then-No. 1 Con
necticut and what you've got is an undefeated Stan
ford team (emphasis on the undefeated) that is
ranked No. 2 in both polls today.
For the moment, Stanford's victory over Ari
zona resulted in a flurry of heightened national
media attention.
Right now, it's that zero in the Cardinal's loss
column that's got everyone talking and all the major
media outlets lining up for tickets (or press passes,
for that matter).
The Cardinal issued credentials to 79 mem
bers of the media for Saturday's contest against
Cal the second-most ever for a game at Maples
Pavilion.
"We haven't lost yet, which means we have done
a good job up to this point. That's all it means,"
Montgomery said. "It doesn't mean we're better
than anybody. It's not a burden, it's fun. I want to
win every game we play, but if we start thinking that
translates into something, then we're not going to
have much luck."

ford's favor.

dinal never quite looked in sync of

a dramatic turnaround from Stan
ford's dominating defensive execu

"I thought we fell prey to shots
they wanted us to take, rather than
taking the shots we wanted," Mont
gomery said. "Cal is good defen

Stanford went into the locker
room at the half after scoring just 24
points and going 8-for-22 from the
field and l-for-6 from beyond the arc.
That said, the low-scoring effort
by both teams wasn't for lack of ef
fort.
The intensity was certainly

there, as both teams hustled and
dove for loose balls in front of a sell
out Maples crowd and a vocal Sixth
Man Club.
And while scoring picked up a
bit in the second half the Cardi
nal quickly jumped to a 14-point
lead after a few slashing layups from
Robinson and Davis, two Lottich 3-
pointers, a couple of dunks by Little
and a 15-foot pull-up jumper by se
nior center Joe Kirchofer it was
the free-throws that really cement
ed the deal down the stretch.
"Cal certainly wasn't intimidat
ed and played very well," Mont
gomery said. "They're good and
they're going to get better."
Childress played 27 minutes and
recorded a double-double for the
Cardinal (10 points and 10 re
bounds) in the victory. Lottich led
all Stanford scorers with 15 points
and Davis added 13 points and
seven boards.
Stanford will face UCLA and
USC this week at Maples Pavilion.
Despite going up by 16 points Stan
ford's largest lead of the game with just
under six minutes remaining in the game, the
now second-ranked Cardinal (14-0,5-0 Pacific
10 Conference) didn't put the Golden Bears
(7-7,2-3) away until the game's final minute.
