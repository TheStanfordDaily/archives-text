# No. 7 Card pulls away in second half
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Shots weren't falling. Turnovers
were rampant. It just didn't look like
the Cardinal's night. But All-Ameri
can senior forward Nicole Powell
worked what is becoming her cus
tomary second-half magic and led the
No. 7 Stanford women's basketball
team (14-2, 7-0 Pacific 10 Confer
ence) to a 63-53 victory over Califor
nia (9-7,2-5).
The Cardinal wasn't the only
team struggling to hold onto the ball,
though, as Stanford and Cal com
bined for four turnovers before either
team scored a point.
Cal employed a defense similar to
the one Stanford had trouble with in
its victory over Arizona State, staying
tight on the Cardinal shooters and
getting hands on the ball and in pass
ing lanes whenever possible.
The tactic proved effective, as the
Bears limited the Cardinal to just 21
points in the first half. Additionally,
Cal stifled Stanford's usual three
point effectiveness, holding the Car
dinal to l-for-6 shooting from beyond
the arc in the first half.
"We have such great shooters on
our team," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We know people
are going to be out on us, and that's
what Cal did."
While the Cal defense was suc
cessful, the squad did not have the
same fortune on the offensive end of
the floor. The Bears recorded nine

turnovers in the first half while shoot
ing only 34.6 percent from the floor
and 40 percent from the charity
stripe. The Cardinal took a 21-20 lead
into halftime.
In the second half, Stanford
changed its approach on the offensive
end.
"We spread people out a little bit
more and had Nicole run our offense
a little bit, attacking with the ball."
said Vanderveer. "We just adjusted
to playing against their pressure."
VanDerveer and the Cardinal
saw results from their adjustments on
Stanford's first possession of the sec
ond half. Powell drove toward the
basket and when the defense con
verged on her, she dished to an open
Susan Borchardt, who coolly buried a
three.
Powell and Borchardt were both
outstanding in the second half, tally
ing 15 and 16 points, respectively, in
the second period.
"For us, different people have
stepped up, but Nicole and Susan
have really been constants," said
VanDerveer. "They've both played
really well all season long and they
just hold us together."
Powell played all but 1:08 of the
game and forced Cal to throw five dif
ferent defenders at her all while
getting absolutely hammered.
"Die constant in every game is to
play me really physical," said Powell.

Junior guard Susan Borchardt scored 19 points in the women's basketball team's 63-53 win
over California on Friday night at Haas Pavilion.
"To try to pound me whenever they
can or get cheap shots. It's something
expected. I just try to take it in and be
productive in what I'm doing."
Despite playing on an ankle that
is not yet 100 percent after a severe
sprain, Powell continued to take the
ball to the rack and showed no fear of
the Bears' physical play. In addition
to her game-high 25 points, the se
nior crashed the boards and pulled
down 11 rebounds for her eighth
double-double of the season.
A combination of Powell's pene
tration and better shooting from the
entire Cardinal squad (42.9 percent
in the second half) helped Stanford
stretch its lead to 10 with 8:47 re
maining.
Cal, however, was not about to
give up. The Bears managed to chip
the Stanford lead to just five on a
Leigh Gregory fastbreak layup with
6:47 on the clock, but for every Cal
run, the Cardinal had an answer and
never allowed the Bears to get closer
than five.
On the Cardinal's very next pos

session, Powell countered with an
old-fashioned three-point play.
The two teams would essentially
trade baskets for the next few min
utes, with the Cardinal holding on to
a seven to eight point cushion. How
ever, Borchardt would stick the dag
ger into the Bears' back by sinking a
trey with 1:44 left on yet another
kickout by Powell.
Borchardt's three put the Cardi
nal up by 10 and even after a three
point play by Cal guard Nihan Anaz,
which cut the lead to seven, Cal had
no option but to foul. Stanford at
tempted eight free throws in the final
35 seconds and sank them all.
The Cardinal also saw strong play
from junior forward Azella Perry
man, who saw increased playing time
due to the foul trouble of junior
T'Nae Thiel and freshman Kristen
Newlin and the injury to junior
Chelsea Trotter.
Perryman was a monster on the
boards, pulling down eight rebounds
for Stanford. She also chipped in
with six points and added a block.
Trotter missed her third straight
game due to knee pain, which has
plagued her throughout her Stan
ford career. The Cardinal is hoping
to have her back for this weekend's
matchups with UCLA and Southern
