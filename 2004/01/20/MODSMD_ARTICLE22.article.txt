# Volleyball downs two ranked opponents

### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Stanford men's volleyball
team, the 2004 season was supposed to be
a rebuilding year. But when the Cardinal,
then No. 11, defeated No. 2 UCLA and
No. 10 UC-Irvine last weekend, it certain
ly didn't seem that way. Buoyed by an en
ergetic crowd in Burnham Pavilion, the
Cardinal (4-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated the Bruins in a four
game contest on Friday, and returned the
following night to inch by the Anteaters
by winning 17-15 in the decisive fifth
game.
The first game of the weekend was
much like the ones that followed it, as the
Cardinal and Bruins exchanged points
until sophomore Nick Manov served for
two winning plays for a 30-28 Stanford vic
tory. The Cardinal took the second game

more convincingly, enjoying their biggest
leads at 21-17 and 26-20 before ultimately
winning 30-25.
But in the third game, the Bruins im
proved their defense and pulled out to an
early 5-1 lead.
"We came out a little slow; maybe we
were a little fatigued," said junior outside
hitter David Vogel, who posted a team
high 16 kills. "We were trying to avoid the
block rather than hitting the block."
Blocking, Stanford junior middle
blocker Craig Buell agreed, was a key to
the Bruin's success. Buell himself, who
registered eight kills in the match, some
times took on three blockers at a time.
"Their middle blockers played a really
good match," he said.
The Bruins maintained a steady advan
tage throughout game three and enjoyed
their largest lead at 22-16 en route to a 30-
25 win.

UCLA looked threatening as it opened
game four with a 10-6 lead, but a kill by
Stanford sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy tied the game at 11 and forced a
Bruin timeout. Though UCLA pulled out
another three-point lead, a block from
Buell, a kill from Reddy and another from
Vogel off of three consecutive serves
evened the game once more at 15-15.
But the Bruins refused to give in, tak
ing the lead by two at 24-22 resulting in a
Stanford time out. When the Cardinal re
turned to the floor, it quickly tied up the
game and then took a 27-26 lead off a kill
by Vogel that it would maintain until
Reddy ended the match with his fifth kill
of the game and 13th of the night.
The game three loss was indicative of
Stanford's need to improve their consis
tency, according to the players.
"We're a little streaky still," Buell
noted of the Cardinal's up-and-down

play.
Perhaps Stanford's least streaky player
was junior Kevin Hansen, who tallied 49
assists, seven kills and a team-high nine
digs.
"He's a stud," Buell said of his teammate.
"He's a star."
Stanford coach Don Shaw was also im
pressed by his setter's all around effort.
"Hansen was everywhere for us
tonight," he said. "He's a great player and
he played like it tonight. But it really was
a team effort tonight.Everyone shared the
load. For us to be successful, we need to
have that kind of balance."
Reddy was equally positive about the
win and what it meant for the team.
"It shows that we're getting better, that
we came back and won the fourth game,"
he said.
The win over the Bruins
was only a warm up for the
five-game match Irvine had in
store for the Cardinal, a match
that opened with Stanford
dropping the first two games,
30-25 and 30-28. Both teams
were plagued by service er
rors, which constituted over
20 points in the first two games
alone. But the Anteaters com
pensated for their errors with
the superb hitting of Jimmy
Pelzel, who, by the end of the
second game, led the team in
kills with 14. Buell paced the
Cardinal with eight.
Stanford and Irvine ex
changed points for the first
moments of game three, until
a pass by Stanford sophomore
libero Jeremy Jacobs set up a
kill for a 6-4 lead, immediately
followed by an attack by Buell
to give the Cardinal a three
point advantage.
A 4-1 run extended Stan
ford's lead to five, prompting
Irvine to call its second and
last timeout of game three. An
ace from Manov and a kill
from Buell pushed Stanford's
lead to 13-7.
After Irvine closed the gap
to 20-18, Manov answered with
another ace for the Cardinal.
"I think Nick Manov and
William Clayton coming off
the bench helped us a lot,"
Shaw said.
Clayton, a sophomore,
posted six kills for the Cardi
nal.
Later, Buell capitalized on
a quick from Hansen to put
the Cardinal ahead 23-21 and
Stanford went on to win by
three.
Early in game four, a bad
pass sent Vogel careening into
the bleachers on an attempted
save. Uninjured, Vogel stayed
in to lift the Cardinal with a
kill to a 14-13 lead in a game
that remained close through
out.
An Irvine hitting error tied
the game at 27 and a kill off an
overpass pushed the Cardinal

up by one. Stanford went on to
win by two, 30-28.
In the fifth and final game,
Irvine took control early and
led 8-6 when the teams
switched sides at the eight
point mark.
The Anteaters extended
their lead to 10-6 before two
service errors brought the
Cardinal to within two. Two
consecutive kills by Stanford
sophomore middle blocker
Chris Ahlfeldt put Stanford
ahead 12-10. Pelzel responded
for Irvine with a kill that was
answered by Clayton, who hit
down the line to force an
Anteater timeout with the
score at 13-12.
In two huge consecutive
plays, Buell blocked for points
to carry the Cardinal to a tie at
14. An Irvine kill and a block
ing error caused another tie at
15, and from there a block by
Ahlfeldt and an Irvine hitting
error led to a 17-15 Stanford
victory.
Ahlfeldt said the win carried
an added importance for him.
"This was kind of a revenge
from last year they
knocked us out of the play
offs," he said of tl\e Anteaters.
Even so, he said, he thought
his team played steadily.
"We were just going one
play at a time. We weren't try
ing to get ahead of ourselves."
Ahlfeldt also commented
on the stellar play of Irvine's
Pelzel, who posted 37 kills in
the match.
"We knew they were going
to set Pelzel, so we focused on
him and it paid off," he said.
Pelzel led the Anteater of
fensively, while Spencer
Bemus was the second most
effective hitter for Irvine, reg
istering 11 kills in the five
games. The Cardinal offense
was spread more evenly
among Buell and Vogel with
17 kills apiece, and Ahlfeldt,
who posted ten.
Hansen emphasized the
group effort in the win, as well
as Stanford's diehard attitude
throughout the grueling five
game match.
"Perseverance was huge
for us," he said. "We dug deep
and came together as a team."

3-2 win over No. 10 UC-Irvine at burnham Pavilion on Saturday. Stanford knocked off
No. 2 UCLA in four games on Friday night.
For the Stanford men's volleyball
team, the 2004 season was supposed to be
a rebuilding year. But when the Cardinal,
then No. 11, defeated No. 2 UCLA and
No. 10 UC-Irvine last weekend, it certain
ly didn't seem that way. Buoyed by an en
ergetic crowd in Burnham Pavilion, the
Cardinal (4-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated the Bruins in a four
game contest on Friday, and returned the
following night to inch by the Anteaters
by winning 17-15 in the decisive fifth
game.
The first game of the weekend was
much like the ones that followed it, as the
Cardinal and Bruins exchanged points
until sophomore Nick Manov served for
two winning plays for a 30-28 Stanford vic
tory. The Cardinal took the second game

more convincingly, enjoying their biggest
leads at 21-17 and 26-20 before ultimately
winning 30-25.
But in the third game, the Bruins im
proved their defense and pulled out to an
early 5-1 lead.
"We came out a little slow; maybe we
were a little fatigued," said junior outside
hitter David Vogel, who posted a team
high 16 kills. "We were trying to avoid the
block rather than hitting the block."
Blocking, Stanford junior middle
blocker Craig Buell agreed, was a key to
the Bruin's success. Buell himself, who
registered eight kills in the match, some
times took on three blockers at a time.
"Their middle blockers played a really
good match," he said.
The Bruins maintained a steady advan
tage throughout game three and enjoyed
their largest lead at 22-16 en route to a 30-
25 win.

UCLA looked threatening as it opened
game four with a 10-6 lead, but a kill by
Stanford sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy tied the game at 11 and forced a
Bruin timeout. Though UCLA pulled out
another three-point lead, a block from
Buell, a kill from Reddy and another from
Vogel off of three consecutive serves
evened the game once more at 15-15.
But the Bruins refused to give in, tak
ing the lead by two at 24-22 resulting in a
Stanford time out. When the Cardinal re
turned to the floor, it quickly tied up the
game and then took a 27-26 lead off a kill
by Vogel that it would maintain until
Reddy ended the match with his fifth kill
of the game and 13th of the night.
The game three loss was indicative of
Stanford's need to improve their consis
tency, according to the players.
"We're a little streaky still," Buell
noted of the Cardinal's up-and-down

play.
Perhaps Stanford's least streaky player
was junior Kevin Hansen, who tallied 49
assists, seven kills and a team-high nine
digs.
"He's a stud," Buell said of his teammate.
"He's a star."
Stanford coach Don Shaw was also im
pressed by his setter's all around effort.
"Hansen was everywhere for us
tonight," he said. "He's a great player and
he played like it tonight. But it really was
a team effort tonight.Everyone shared the
load. For us to be successful, we need to
have that kind of balance."
Reddy was equally positive about the
win and what it meant for the team.
"It shows that we're getting better, that
we came back and won the fourth game,"
he said.
The win over the Bruins
was only a warm up for the
five-game match Irvine had in
store for the Cardinal, a match
that opened with Stanford
dropping the first two games,
30-25 and 30-28. Both teams
were plagued by service er
rors, which constituted over
20 points in the first two games
alone. But the Anteaters com
pensated for their errors with
the superb hitting of Jimmy
Pelzel, who, by the end of the
second game, led the team in
kills with 14. Buell paced the
Cardinal with eight.
Stanford and Irvine ex
changed points for the first
moments of game three, until
a pass by Stanford sophomore
libero Jeremy Jacobs set up a
kill for a 6-4 lead, immediately
followed by an attack by Buell
to give the Cardinal a three
point advantage.
A 4-1 run extended Stan
ford's lead to five, prompting
Irvine to call its second and
last timeout of game three. An
ace from Manov and a kill
from Buell pushed Stanford's
lead to 13-7.
After Irvine closed the gap
to 20-18, Manov answered with
another ace for the Cardinal.
"I think Nick Manov and
William Clayton coming off
the bench helped us a lot,"
Shaw said.
Clayton, a sophomore,
posted six kills for the Cardi
nal.
Later, Buell capitalized on
a quick from Hansen to put
the Cardinal ahead 23-21 and
Stanford went on to win by
three.
Early in game four, a bad
pass sent Vogel careening into
the bleachers on an attempted
save. Uninjured, Vogel stayed
in to lift the Cardinal with a
kill to a 14-13 lead in a game
that remained close through
out.
An Irvine hitting error tied
the game at 27 and a kill off an
overpass pushed the Cardinal

up by one. Stanford went on to
win by two, 30-28.
In the fifth and final game,
Irvine took control early and
led 8-6 when the teams
switched sides at the eight
point mark.
The Anteaters extended
their lead to 10-6 before two
service errors brought the
Cardinal to within two. Two
consecutive kills by Stanford
sophomore middle blocker
Chris Ahlfeldt put Stanford
ahead 12-10. Pelzel responded
for Irvine with a kill that was
answered by Clayton, who hit
down the line to force an
Anteater timeout with the
score at 13-12.
In two huge consecutive
plays, Buell blocked for points
to carry the Cardinal to a tie at
14. An Irvine kill and a block
ing error caused another tie at
15, and from there a block by
Ahlfeldt and an Irvine hitting
error led to a 17-15 Stanford
victory.
Ahlfeldt said the win carried
an added importance for him.
"This was kind of a revenge
from last year they
knocked us out of the play

Even so, he said, he thought
his team played steadily.
"We were just going one
play at a time. We weren't try

Ahlfeldt also commented
on the stellar play of Irvine's
Pelzel, who posted 37 kills in
the match.
"We knew they were going
to set Pelzel, so we focused on
him and it paid off," he said.
Pelzel led the Anteater of
fensively, while Spencer
Bemus was the second most
effective hitter for Irvine, reg
istering 11 kills in the five
games. The Cardinal offense
was spread more evenly
among Buell and Vogel with
17 kills apiece, and Ahlfeldt,
who posted ten.
Hansen emphasized the
group effort in the win, as well
as Stanford's diehard attitude
throughout the grueling five
game match.
"Perseverance was huge
for us," he said. "We dug deep
and came together as a team."
