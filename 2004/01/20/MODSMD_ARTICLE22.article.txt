# Volleyball downs two ranked opponents

### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Stanford men's volleyball
team, the 2004 season was supposed to be
a rebuilding year. But when the Cardinal,
then No. 11, defeated No. 2 UCLA and
No. 10 UC-Irvine last weekend, it certain
ly didn't seem that way. Buoyed by an en
ergetic crowd in Burnham Pavilion, the
Cardinal (4-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) defeated the Bruins in a four
game contest on Friday, and returned the
following night to inch by the Anteaters
by winning 17-15 in the decisive fifth
game.
The first game of the weekend was
much like the ones that followed it, as the
Cardinal and Bruins exchanged points
until sophomore Nick Manov served for
two winning plays for a 30-28 Stanford vic
tory. The Cardinal took the second game

more convincingly, enjoying their biggest
leads at 21-17 and 26-20 before ultimately
winning 30-25.
But in the third game, the Bruins im
proved their defense and pulled out to an
early 5-1 lead.
"We came out a little slow; maybe we
were a little fatigued," said junior outside
hitter David Vogel, who posted a team
high 16 kills. "We were trying to avoid the
block rather than hitting the block."
Blocking, Stanford junior middle
blocker Craig Buell agreed, was a key to
the Bruin's success. Buell himself, who
registered eight kills in the match, some
times took on three blockers at a time.
"Their middle blockers played a really
good match," he said.
The Bruins maintained a steady advan
tage throughout game three and enjoyed
their largest lead at 22-16 en route to a 30-
25 win.

UCLA looked threatening as it opened
game four with a 10-6 lead, but a kill by
Stanford sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy tied the game at 11 and forced a
Bruin timeout. Though UCLA pulled out
another three-point lead, a block from
Buell, a kill from Reddy and another from
Vogel off of three consecutive serves
evened the game once more at 15-15.
But the Bruins refused to give in, tak
ing the lead by two at 24-22 resulting in a
Stanford time out. When the Cardinal re
turned to the floor, it quickly tied up the
game and then took a 27-26 lead off a kill
by Vogel that it would maintain until
Reddy ended the match with his fifth kill
of the game and 13th of the night.
The game three loss was indicative of
Stanford's need to improve their consis
tency, according to the players.
"We're a little streaky still," Buell
noted of the Cardinal's up-and-down

play.
Perhaps Stanford's least streaky player
was junior Kevin Hansen, who tallied 49
assists, seven kills and a team-high nine
digs.
"He's a stud," Buell said of his teammate.
"He's a star."
Stanford coach Don Shaw was also im
pressed by his setter's all around effort.
"Hansen was everywhere for us
tonight," he said. "He's a great player and
he played like it tonight. But it really was
a team effort tonight.Everyone shared the
load. For us to be successful, we need to
have that kind of balance."
Reddy was equally positive about the
win and what it meant for the team.
"It shows that we're getting better, that
we came back and won the fourth game,"
