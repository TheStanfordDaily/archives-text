# Women gymnasts upset by ASU
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Arizona State upset the Stanford women's
gymnastics team on Sunday with a 195.825 to
195.5 victory in Tempe, Ariz. The Cardinal is now
3-1 and has slipped from a preseason rank of six
to a current rank of 14 in the NCAA.
Stanford started the meet on the uneven bars
with solid performances by senior Lindsay Wing
and freshman Stacey Sprando. Senior Lise Lev
eille, usually a powerhouse on every event, strug
gled through her routine with two falls, but her
teammates weren't rattled.
Sophomore Natalie Foley and senior Caroline
Fluhrer, both All-Americans on bars, took the
reigns and scored a 9.9 and a 9.925, respectively.
Foley tied for third on the event and Fluhrer
earned second place, trailing sophomore Ashley
Kelly of ASU who scored a 9.95. ASU edged out
the Cardinal on bars, 49.2 to 49.075.
Stanford moved to the vaulting table, but al
though it outdid ASU 48.575 to 48.425 on the
event, head coach Kristen Smyth wanted more.
Only three of Stanford's six vaults were difficult

enough to warrant a full 10.0 start value. (In gym
nastics, routines are given a start value of up to 10
points based on their difficulty; the judges subse
quently deduct from that start value if the gym
nast makes mistakes in her routine.)
"We're starting a bit slow on vault this year.
But by the next meet on Friday we're looking to
have five vaults start from a 10, and by the end of
the season we'll have six vaults that start from a
10," Smyth said.
Leveille and Foley tied for first place on vault,
both competing full-twisting layout Yerchenko
vaults that start from a 10.0. Sophomore Glyn
Sweets, an All-American on vault, also started
from a 10.0 and took sixth with a 9.75 in her first
meet of the season.
Smyth wants Fluhrer, a Pacific-10 vault cham
pion as a freshman, to step up her performance on
vault and is also looking for sophomore Jessica
Louie to improve the difficulty of her vault at the
next meet on Friday.
Stanford did not deliver on floor exercise,
which Smyth expects to be the team's strength
this season. Despite strong performances from
senior Shelly Goldberg who opened with a much

improved routine from last week's meet, and
Leveille, who won the event with a 9.925, the
team lost floor exercise 49.05 to 48.775.
Wing watered down her first tumbling pass,
decreasing the start value of her routine from a
10.0 to a 9.8, and Fluhrer fell on her first tumbling
pass.
"It's not an endurance problem, but more of a
confidence thing," Smyth said. "The potential is
definitely there on floor, but I'm looking for the
team to have a different attitude towards the
event."
Stanford finished the meet on balance beam,
traditionally its strongest event, and hit six for six
routines. Foley nailed a 9.9 routine, which tied
her for first with ASU's Kelly and Wing pulled
through with a 9.85 to tie her for third. But that
was not enough. The Cardinal narrowly fell short
of ASU, 49.15 to 49.075.
"We need to work on taking the kind of confi
dence and energy we have in front of our home
crowd and bringing it on the road," Smyth said.
"We didn't bring it on Sunday, but we'll need to
be able to do that because Pac-10's, regionals and
nationals are all on the road. Its early yet."
