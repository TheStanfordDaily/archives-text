# Football takes a backseat as Babin hits the slopes

### 
While I can't say it was entirely
due to the persuasive powers
of last week's columns in this
section, I too found myself on
a house ski trip this past weekend. Yes, I
know I'm a grad student (and a T.A.,
moreover), that I'm not supposed to do
this stuff anymore, that I should just let
go of my undergrad years and hold onto

the memories, that I
should move on, etc. etc.
But how can you say no
to Tahoe? Coming from
Colorado, I find myself
fairly spoiled when it
comes to winter sports in
general, and skiing in
particular. I can leave
my house and be on a lift
40 minutes later. It's not
uncommon for me to ski

in November, July and every month in
between.
I remember as a freshman I looked
down on Tahoe as anyone from Col
orado, Utah, Wyoming or the Swiss Alps

might. My first day at Heavenly, it was
raining at the bottom of the mountain.
Raining. I couldn't believe it.
The array of cheap motels, in-and-out
wedding chapels, casino lights and liquor
stores was all new to me. I was used to
quiet ski towns with warm bars and cold
beer, not giant billboards for " 'X!'
Caesar's All New Adult Review Featur
ing Playmate of the Month."
What's the attraction, then? How to
explain the fact that I was unable to keep
myself from the place this last weekend,
even though it hadn't snowed in a week
and I was sick as a dog?
Who knows. There are the simple,
clear explanations: The fact that even
sliding down an icy sheet of Sierra Ce
ment, the view of that lake falling away
into the horizon beneath you is still un
believable. The fact that "The Brewery"
makes the best beer between the New
Belgium headquarters in Fort Collins
and the North Coast shack in Fort Bragg.
The fact that the blinking lights of the
casinos are attractive now that I'm over

21.
Then there are the more subtle expla
nations: The nostalgia I feel for sneaking
onto the mountain to sled in garbage
bags, evading night security and Snowcat
grooming machines. The desire to finally
get back at Caesar's for taking my money
for two years (which finally happened
this trip, by the way).
The fact that even a bad day skiing is
better than almost any other day.
And finally, the reason that gives me
an excuse to write this column be
cause a ridiculously crowded house in
South Lake filled with beer, food and
friends is an absolutely fantastic place to
watch NFL Conference Championship
games.
Well let's be honest. Almost any place
filled with beer, food and friends would
be a good place for a game any game.
And in a weekend filled with the begin
ning of the Australian Open, with the 14-
year-old phenom (yes, a loaded term, but
I think in this case perfectly acceptable)
Wie making everyone in the PGA be

sides Tiger, Ernie and Vijay look over
their collective shoulder, with the Tar
Heels knocking off then-No. 1 Connecti
cut to clear the way for the Cardinal to
rise to No. 2 in both polls (with 24 first
place votes, no less!), with Duke still
looking damned tough in taking it to
Wake Forest, with Carmelo Anthony
dropping a 31-point bomb on the Heat
(OK, so maybe a few of you missed that
one) it just so happens that the NFL,
as it usually does, took center stage.
Now you're probably expecting me
(like last year, for those of you with good
memories) to talk about lounging around
and watching the game, about my crazy
friend who bet on a 13-way parlay at Har
rah's, about that psycho guy down the
hall from Philly who wore his McNabb
jersey for the entire trip.
But I'm not going to do that.
(First of all, because I already did it
last year. Then again, the Eagles did pret
ty much the same thing as last year, didn't
they . . . )
But more importantly, I can't do that

because I didn't see either game. Nope.
Even with a stocked fridge, with a warm
sleeping bag laid out in front of the 37-inch
television. Didn't see a single snap.
Why not?
Because I went skiing. I wanted to look
down on the stateline. I wanted to look
over one shoulder and see one of the most
beautiful lakes I've ever seen, then look
over the other and see a Godforsaken bar
ren desert. I wanted to run into old friends
in the lift line and meet someone new on
the lift. I wanted to dull the pain of the last
run down Gunbarrel with an Alpine
Amber at the Brewery. Don't know when
I'll be back, after all.
Though if it snows this week, I'm guess
ing it'll be Friday.
