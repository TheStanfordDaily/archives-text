# Threes are key to Card's success
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Three-pointers don't just get the crowd going,
they also make or break the game. Just ask the No.
7 Stanford women's basketball team. The Cardi
nal's perimeter shooting, specifically shots by se
nior guard Susan Borchardt and senior forward
Nicole Powell, helped Stanford (14-2,7-0 Pacific 10
Conference) pull away from Cal (9-7,2-5) last Fri
day night, 63-53.
Or ask Cal head coach Caren Horstmeyer, who
pinpointed the reason her team was dealt its third
straight defeat after the game.
"The key of the game to me: They hit five three
pointers and they shot 62 percent from the three
point line in the second half and that's their game.
It was a one point game at half time and they only
had one three [in the first half.]"
Which isn't to say that having a good inside
game is not important. The Cardinal does have a
solid game under the basket and, of course, the
total package is what wins games and tourna
ments.But Stanford's perimeter play makes a big

difference, especially in clutch situations.
In front of a rowdy Haas Pavilion crowd, Stan
ford struggled to open up and maintain a lead.
After coming out of the half ahead by only one
point, it took threes by Borchardt and Powell to
seal the deal for the Cardinal, with the Bears still
holding Stanford to 37 percent shooting from the
floor.
Granted, the game was a tough defensive match
on both sides. Going into the game, Cal had the
highest shooting percentage in the Pac-10 (.463)
with Stanford a close second (.458). The only other
team to hold Stanford to under 40 percent this sea
son is No. 2 Texas Tech.
Borchardt, who only scored three points in the
first half, scored 16 after the break, including two
three-pointers. The first one came less than a
minute in and the second put Stanford up by 10
with 1:44 to play. The junior iced the Stanford win
with six free throws in the final 30 seconds.
"We had people make big shots for us," said
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "Down the
stretch Susan hit a big three and Nicole hit a big
three."

There's a definitiveness to a 3-point shot that
psychologically intimidates teams in a way that a
regular field goal can't. It's not even about quanti
ty. The three-pointer provides a more visceral pres
sure, a slap in the face rather than an elbow nudge.
Powell took advantage of shots from the
perimeter, since the Bears had her heavily guarded
and made easier shots from the inside nearly im
possible.
"[We] don't let her get by us," Horstmeyer said.
"That's where's she's really good at being able to
hang and shoot and see a pass ... We we're trying
not to give her easy baskets."
Stanford leads the Pac-10 in the number of 3-
point field goals made with 122 overall and 67 in
conference play. The Cardinal also leads the Pac-10
in its 3-point field goal percentage (.489). It aver
ages 7.6 three pointers a game, compared with 4.1
for it's opponents. In scoring terms, that's a differ
ence of 10.5 points a game, nearly the margin by
which Stanford defeated Cal.
The difference adds up. The Cardinal is a great
team all-around, but the threes are what allow
Stanford to dominate.
