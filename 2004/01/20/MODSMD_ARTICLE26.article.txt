# No. 9 Card ekes by UM

### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
When the nine men of Stanford's No. 9 men's gymnas
tics team stepped onto the floor to face No. 4 Michigan at
the Whitfield Invitational on Saturday, they were ready to
tackle their routines. But when they stepped off the floor,
they weren't prepared for the meet's results.
"When they announced that Michigan took second
place with a 211 there was dead silence in the gym," said
Stanford head coach Thorn Glielmi. "When they an
nounced that Stanford won with a 211.075 there was still si
lence. Our guys were just looking at each other with their
mouths open, going, 'What, we won?' "
Five of the nine Stanford teammates had never com
peted in an NCAA meet, so Glielmi said he wasn't sur
prised that his team was shocked by the meet result.
More shocking was Stanford freshman Peter Derman's
still rings routine. Derman was the last to compete on the
apparatus and right before his dismount, one of the rings
snapped in half. The rings are made of hollow fiberglass,
but they have a safety rope inside to protect the gymnast in
the event of a break. According to Glielmi, however, the
rings hardly ever break, let alone in a meet setting.
Derman was not injured but had to compete his entire
routine again; a particularly difficult challenge on the rings
which require an enormous amount of strength and ener
gy-
Derman kept his nerve even as a rookie, however, and
proved his steal by winning the event with a 9.25.

Senior and captain Dan Gill won the all-around with a
54.55 and won vault with a 9.4. He took second on high bar
with an outstanding performance that earned a 9.5, Stan
ford's top individual score for the evening.
Junior Kelly Lang hit his parallel bars routine to earn a
9.25, good enough for first place in the event. The highlight
of Lang's routine was a Healy on one bar in a combination,
a very difficult skill that he debuted on Saturday night.
"But the best part of the meet has got to be shutting
down that 'Go Blue' cheer," Glielmi said.
As a team, the men won still rings by 0.7, vault by 0.75
and parallel bars by 1.3. They fell short to the Wolverines
on floor exercise by 1.4, high bar by 1.175, and pommel
horse by just 0.1. The margin of victory in the team all
around score was only 0.075.
"We really realized that every tenth does count," Gliel
mi said. "Beating Michigan by .075 brought that message
home to the team."
The men will compete at the Pacific Coast Invitational
in Oakland next Saturday.
"Now that the first meet jitters are over, our goal is to
compete just like we practice," Glielmi said. "There were
lots of little mistakes from the young guys on Saturday, but
that's to be expected. We anticipate making those changes
for the meet this weekend."
The team will be missing its leader next weekend, how
ever, so the young team members will have to step up their
performance. Gill will be attending a senior national team
training camp in order to prepare him to earn a spot on the
2004 Olympic team.
