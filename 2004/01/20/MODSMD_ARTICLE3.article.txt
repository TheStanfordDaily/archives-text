In remembrance of the work of Martin Luther
King, Jr., the 2004 MLK Jr. Celebration continues
with events this week, in an effort to foster greater
intellectual discovery about King.
The MLK Jr. Celebration committee, made up
of administrators and students and chaired by
Black Community Services Center Director Jan
Barker Alexander, has coordinated lectures, per
formances and a school supply drive for the
schools of East Palo Alto.
"Students need to take advantage of the oppor

MLK projects that take place at this campus,"
Barker Alexander said. "This is the special sort of

The celebration will culminate at the end of the

for it, so it's a lose-lose situation because the
teachers can't afford to pay for their own needs,
and those of their own families and then for 30 or
40 students."
Mcßae and the other students involved collect
ed a list of the supplies needed at the School of
Wisdom and Knowledge, the San Francisco 49er
Academy, Costano Elementary School and the
Cesar Chavez Academy. The requested items in
