## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
In remembrance of the work of Martin Luther
King, Jr., the 2004 MLK Jr. Celebration continues
with events this week, in an effort to foster greater
intellectual discovery about King.
The MLK Jr. Celebration committee, made up
of administrators and students and chaired by
Black Community Services Center Director Jan
Barker Alexander, has coordinated lectures, per
formances and a school supply drive for the
schools of East Palo Alto.
"Students need to take advantage of the oppor
tunity to learn more about Dr. King through the
MLK projects that take place at this campus,"
Barker Alexander said. "This is the special sort of
outside-of-the-classroom learning that happens at
Stanford."
The celebration began on Jan. 10, with the
opening of the Gandhi, King and Ikeda Exhibit on
the second floor of Tresidder Union.
Barker Alexander said the speakers at tomor
row's panel, "The Dream in Today's World"
including History Prof. Clayborne Carson and
Vice Provost of Campus Relations LaDoris
Cordell "will give personal reflections what the
Dream means to them and what it means in
today's world."
The celebration will culminate at the end of the
month, when students who have been coordinating
a school supply drive will present their donations
to four schools in East Palo Alto.
Sarena Mcßae, who has been organizing the
supply drive in conjunction with the Black Com
munity Services Center and the Haas Center, said
that this project is "in celebration of [Martin
Luther King's] birthday, his legacy, his memories."
"Teachers have to go into their own pockets if
they need something for their classroom that is
not provided in their budget," Mcßae said. "Ei
ther the students go without or the teachers pay
for it, so it's a lose-lose situation because the
teachers can't afford to pay for their own needs,
and those of their own families and then for 30 or
40 students."
Mcßae and the other students involved collect
ed a list of the supplies needed at the School of
Wisdom and Knowledge, the San Francisco 49er
Academy, Costano Elementary School and the
Cesar Chavez Academy. The requested items in
cluded pencil sharpeners, glue sticks, binder paper
and an overhead projector.
"We just feel like, as Stanford students, we're in a
very privileged situation," Mcßae
said. "We had the resources; that's
why we're here today, and we felt a
responsibility to give back to our
community, to help another student

or teachers. For teachers, it's easy to
get discouraged if you don't have
what you need all the time, or you're
teaching without all the necessary
resources."
The students asked about 42
dorms to make $5O donations.
Other events in the upcoming
weeks include a lecture on Thurs
day night entitled "The Dream in a

Hip-Hop Context," a multi-faith
Martin Luther King Jr. worship
service on Sunday with actor Aldo
Billingslea preaching as King, Jr.
and a lecture Jan. 28 featuring
Rev. James Lawson, the former
president of the Southern Christ
ian Leadership Conference and a
personal friend of King.
