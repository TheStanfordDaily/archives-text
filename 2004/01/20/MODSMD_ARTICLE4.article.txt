Chants of "Shame on France" and "Religious freedom
for all" could be heard in the streets of San Francisco on
Saturday as a group of Stanford students joined hundreds
of protesters in a peaceful march from San Francisco's Civic
Center to the French Consulate.
The group was protesting French President Jacques
Chirac's proposed law that would ban all religious apparel
such as Muslim hijabs, or headscarves, Christian crosses,
Jewish yarmulkes, Sikh turbans and other outward reli

within France.
The San Francisco march was sponsored by the Muslim
Students Association, the Council on American-Islamic

round of speeches from leaders representing various reli

Once in front of the Consulate, the rally resumed with
speeches from representatives of Muslim, Christian and
Sikh groups, later sending a delegation inside to meet with
French officials.
Saliha Shakir, an associate member of the Muslim
Women's League, called on President Chirac to put an end
to the proposed ban.
"Tyranny will never triumph over freedom," she said.
"Democracy in the modern era is the right of all people, re
gardless of race or religion."
Rev. Charles Gibbs, another speaker at the rally, point
ed out that the protest took place during Martin Luther
King, Jr. weekend.
"During this long weekend, we celebrate the efforts of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.," he said. "If he were here
today, Dr. King would be marching with us for freedom in
support of our brothers and sisters in France."
Cynthia Pettross came to the protest to show unity with
members of different faiths in France.
"Personally, it doesn't matter to me whether I wear a
cross or not, but I believe that the hijab can deeply affect the
faith of a Muslim woman, and it's not fair for her to have to
remove it," she said. "And now with France restricting free-
