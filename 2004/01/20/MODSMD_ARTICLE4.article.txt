# Rally held in SF to protest proposed French law
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE 
Chants of "Shame on France" and "Religious freedom
for all" could be heard in the streets of San Francisco on
Saturday as a group of Stanford students joined hundreds
of protesters in a peaceful march from San Francisco's Civic
Center to the French Consulate.
The group was protesting French President Jacques
Chirac's proposed law that would ban all religious apparel
such as Muslim hijabs, or headscarves, Christian crosses,
Jewish yarmulkes, Sikh turbans and other outward reli
gious displays in public schools to promote secularism
within France.
The San Francisco march was sponsored by the Muslim
Students Association, the Council on American-Islamic
Relations and other religious groups. It coincided with
protests led in major cities around the world, including
Paris.
The rally began at 11 a.m. in front of City Hall with a
round of speeches from leaders representing various reli
gious groups in the Bay Area. After the speeches, protest
ers marched up Market Street past Union Square and Chi
natown to the French Consulate.
Once in front of the Consulate, the rally resumed with
speeches from representatives of Muslim, Christian and
Sikh groups, later sending a delegation inside to meet with
French officials.
Saliha Shakir, an associate member of the Muslim
Women's League, called on President Chirac to put an end
to the proposed ban.
"Tyranny will never triumph over freedom," she said.
"Democracy in the modern era is the right of all people, re
gardless of race or religion."
Rev. Charles Gibbs, another speaker at the rally, point
ed out that the protest took place during Martin Luther
King, Jr. weekend.
"During this long weekend, we celebrate the efforts of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.," he said. "If he were here
today, Dr. King would be marching with us for freedom in
support of our brothers and sisters in France."
Cynthia Pettross came to the protest to show unity with
members of different faiths in France.
"Personally, it doesn't matter to me whether I wear a
cross or not, but I believe that the hijab can deeply affect the
faith of a Muslim woman, and it's not fair for her to have to
remove it," she said. "And now with France restricting free-

dom of religion, what's next? Free
dom of speech?"
In defense of the proposed ban,
French officials state the law would
be an effort to promote secularism
and a separation between church
and state within France. They also
claim that outward expressions of re
ligious symbols detract from French
character and nationalism.
Many students from various reli

gions and universities across the Bay
Area, including Stanford, came out
in large numbers to show their disap
proval of the proposed French law.
Sophomore Tanya Haj-Hassan,
vice-president of Stanford's Muslim
Students Awareness Network, de
fended the wearing of the hijab.
"What many people don't under
stand is that the hijab is not just an
other religious symbol," she said.
"It's a form of religious devotion.
Asking Muslim women to take off
their hijab is like asking members of
other religions to stop going to
church or temple."

Freshman Shelley Cheung said
she believes the proposed law in
fringes upon basic human rights.
"I think it's important for Mus
lims to make their voices heard," she
said. "I don't think Chirac should be
able to tell people what to do or
wear. It's not fair to the French peo
ple."
Haj-Hassan said she is Muslim
and does not wear the hijab.
"But if I chose to wear the hijab, I
should not be denied the right to ed
ucation as Muslim women who wear
the hijab in France will be if this law
passes," she said.
