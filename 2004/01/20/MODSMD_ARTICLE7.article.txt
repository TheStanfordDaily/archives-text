# Council approves new apartments and stores for East Palo Alto
## 
### MELISSA CHEE 
The East Palo Alto City Council has unan
imously approved a contract that will combine
retail and residential development, part of a
long-term plan by the city to expand its tax
base, create employment for residents and im
prove services.
Cummings Park Christian Methodist Epis
copal Church is selling its 1.1 acres of vacant
land adjacent to the Ravens wood 101 Shop
ping Center. The land will be used to construct
retail shops at ground level, with 34 apartment
units built two stories above the stores.
"This project just seems new in East Palo
Alto because ever since our business dis
trict was wiped out in the 1950s when

Bayshore Highway was upgraded to a freeway
we have been a bedroom colony supplying
employees and retail dollars to businesses in
neighboring cities," Bay said.
This mixed-use development will bring ad
ditional business and housing to East Palo
Alto. Initial projected revenues for the city
total more than $112,000.
"Vertical mixed-use with housing over
retail makes great use of space and will also
enliven a corner of our shopping center that is
currently under-utilized," said Chris Bay, an
East Palo Alto member of the council. "Verti
cal mixed-use is the dominant development
pattern in cites worldwide, across cultures and
across centuries, once sprawl is no longer an
option."

Another space-saving idea is a mechanical
system that will allow the stacking of three ve
hicles in one residential parking space.
"I would like to see more projects like this,"
Bay said. "As in many small cites with limited
space, residents want development of services
and the tax base, but don't want intrusion into
low-density neighborhoods. So vertical
mixed-use makes good sense."
Goro Mitchell, executive director of the
Community Development Institute in East
Palo Alto, believes the Cummings project is a
step in the right direction, citing its provision of
low-cost housing.
Adhering to the city policy that 20 percent
of new housing units be sold below market
rate, seven apartments will be designated

below market rate.
"Many people don't have $250,000 to
spend on a house," he said. "I know folks who
never thought they'd be able to find low-cost
housing in East Palo Alto. However, East Palo
Alto housing has done a really great job pro
viding affordable housing."
The project will also provide opportunity
for small business growth. Upon completion,
an additional 22,000 square feet of retail space
will be available.
The developer is seeking permission for a
full-service restaurant. The developer will also
lease 1,400 square feet for a dollar a year to a
nonprofit organization to promote micro
business.
"The Cummings project is very exciting be

cause it offers a location for mom-and-pop
type businesses," Mitchell said. "It's a great
opportunity for micro-businesses to grow."
Carlos Martinez, the director of East Palo
Alto's redevelopment agency, believes the
project will support the creation of local job
opportunities, increase revenues for the city,
create low- and moderate-income housing
and promote new and private sector busi
nesses.
"The project will create construction jobs
and retail opportunities for East Palo Alto res
idents, it will provide more and complemen
tary goods and services to the community and
to the retail center and will enhance the per
formance of the retail center by bringing more
shoppers," he said.
