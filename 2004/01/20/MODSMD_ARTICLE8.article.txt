# UCLA forces Taco Bell to examine labor practices

(U-WIRE)LOS ANGELES Taco Bell is con
sidering approaching the U.S. Department of Labor to
review the wages and living conditions of farmworkers
who produce the fast food chain's tomatoes.
The restaurant is struggling to maintain its presence
on the UCLA campus as it works to comply with con
ditions set out by board members of the Associated
Students of UCLA in December 2003.
Board members of the association voted after hear
ing presentations on labor abuses committed by grow
ers against tomato pickers in Immokalee, a region in
Florida from where the restaurant purchases its toma
toes.
These farmworkers, most of whom came from
Mexico, reportedly suffered criminal abuses at the
hands of their supervisors and were forced to work
overtime without pay.
The conditions specified that Taco Bell must pay for
a third party to investigate labor practices of its tomato
suppliers in the Immokalee region. A written report

must be submitted to the association by April 30.
However, Taco Bell has concerns! with some of
ASUCLA's provisions, said Laurie Schalow, director
of public relations for the restaurant chain.
Taco Bell cannot force its suppliers to comply with
the UCLA code of conduct, she said, but suppliers will
still have to abide by the restaurant's own code of con
duct. Taco Bell currently is updating its code of con
duct to include anti-slave labor language, Schalow
added.
In addition, Taco Bell cannot force inspections on
its tomato suppliers, she said.
Bob Williams, ASUCLA interim executive direc
tor, said board members felt the restaurant was mov
ing "somewhat in the direction that we want."
Williams added, however, that the association still
needs Taco Bell to involve the Coalition of Immokalee
Workers in the process of selecting the third party to
conduct the review.
Figures from the Department of Labor show that
the rate at which farmworkers are paid, 40 to 50 cents
for each 32-pound bucket of tomatoes, has remained
the same since 1978.
