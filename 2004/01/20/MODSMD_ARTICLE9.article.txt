2005: Encounter with Titan
In 2005 a man-made spacecraft may
splash down in a non-Earth ocean. Titan,
the largest satellite of Saturn and half as
large as the moon, is the only satellite in the
solar system with a serious atmosphere.

However, due to the
heavy smog in the atmo
sphere, astronomers
know little about its sur
face. For decades re
searchers have speculated
that Titan could have seas
made of hydrocarbons.
Three years ago, a study
in Science provided evi
dence for rain. All this
shall be revealed in two
years when the Cassini

spacecraft sends a probe down to Titan's
surface. The mission will also help deter
mine how Titan has formed organic
molecules and how it regenerates methane.
Mutation increases Longevity
Scientists in Israel have identified a ge
netic mutation that apparently causes peo
ple to live longer. The mutation alters an en
zyme involved in regulating lipoproteins
and their particle size. These molecules are
popularly known as "good cholesterol" and
their larger quantity and size better protect
the body from diseases of aging such as
heart attack, stroke and diabetes. The re
searchers found that centenarians were
three times as likely to have the mutation
than the general population and centenari
ans' offspring were twice as likely to have it.
Pharmaceuticals, especially Pfizer, have al
ready expressed an interest in developing
drugs that would mimic the actions of this
mutation.
Early Humans in North America
The discovery of ancient animal bones in
western Canada suggests that humans may
have migrated from North America to Asia
much earlier than previously thought. The
bones belong to bears, mountain goats and
other animals that lived 16,000 years ago.
This finding challenges the conventional
theory that this area was frozen and could
not sustain a human population. Moreover,
it supports the coastal migration theory,
which holds that humans reached North
American using boats, although only human
remains or artifacts would confirm that. The
most widely accepted migration theory is
that humans crossed a strait between
Siberia and Alaska on foot 12,000 years ago.
MRI and the Nobel Prize
This year's Nobel Prize in Medicine is a
celebration of an interrelated discovery.
American Paul C. Lauterbur and Briton Sir
Peter Mansfield were awarded the Nobel
for their pioneering work in forming images
of living tissues and organs using MRI. MRI
is essentially an outgrowth of nuclear mag
netic resonance (NMR), an analytical tech
nique used in chemistry labs for decades.
NMR uses magnetic fields to show how
atoms in a molecule align. MRI takes that
one step further by forming an image from
the radio signals. In recent years, re
searchers have refined the methods by su
perconducting quantum interference de
vices (SQUIDs), which uses helium detec
tors at low temperatures and gives finer im
ages.
Light bending in Opposite Direction
Physicists have observed negative refrac
tion in an ordinary crystal for the first time.
Refraction is when light bends due to the
density of the material, as in when sunrays
hit water. Negative refraction means the
light is bent in the opposite direction to or
dinary materials. The theory was proposed
more than 30 years ago but the first experi
mental evidence came in 2000. Yong Zhang
and collaborators at the National Renew
able Energy Laboratory in the United
States made their observations on an alloy
containing yttrium, vanadium and oxygen.
They believe that demonstrating negative
refraction in "such a simple material" will
make it easier to study more complicated
optical phenomena.
Microscope reveals Hidden Atoms
Researchers at Stanford and the Univer
sity of Augsburg in Germany have designed
a new microscope that can reveal hidden
atoms. Current scanning tunneling micro
scopes (STMs) can only detect half of the
carbon atoms in the hexagonal surface unit
cell. To achieve their feat, the team reduced
the oscillation of the microscope tip and op
erated it at the very low temperature of 5K
to reduce noise. "[W]e can now image mat
ter and see where all the atoms are and
where the conductive states are localized,"
Franz Giessibl of Augsburg told Physic
s Web. The researchers believe the micro
scope will be especially useful to study or
ganic and biological materials that are too
difficult to analyze using traditional imaging
techniques.
