# Athletes visit capital to fight sports bill
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Several members of Stanford's Cardinal Council,
an organization representing student-athletes, trav
eled to Sacramento on Monday as part of the council's
ongoing efforts to stop bill SB 193, the "Student-Ath
lete Bill of Rights."
The bill, introduced by State Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City) last February, seeks to reform the
way California colleges and universities treat their
student-athletes. Murray's stated aim in introducing
the bill was to improve the lot of California college
athletes, whom he felt were poorly rewarded for their
efforts.
The Cardinal Council said it opposed the bill be
cause, if passed, it would place California state law in
direct contradiction of the rules of the NCAA, college
sports' governing body.
"To make a long story short, if the bill passes, Stan
ford, along with every single other California institute
of higher education, will not be able to compete in the
NCAA," said Michael Bruce, head of Cardinal Coun
cil.
Murray has long contended that things would not
come to that.
"Do we want to play chicken? No," he told the
Contra Costa Times in October. "But if the alterna
tive is to do nothing because this behemoth institution
doesn't want to change, then we should step up to the
challenge."
SB 193 swiftly passed the state Senate last May, but
is up for a General Assembly vote in coming months.
Bruce, a senior swimmer, and David Bergeron, a
junior football player, were joined by UC-Berkeley's
Ashley Miller and University of Southern Califor
nia's Lindsay Oman on the trip to the state capital. In
Sacramento, they met with each member of the As
sembly's higher education committee, which current
ly has the bill under consideration, and presented the
committee with a petition signed by 700 California
student-athletes urging the Assembly to kill the bill.
The bill would also expire if it were not passed by July.
The petition does not take issue with Murray's
concerns so much as with his methodology.
"We agree with most of the ends that Sen. Murray
would like to see achieved, but we believe his means
risk too much for the marginal benefits that SB 193
will achieve," Bruce said. "We say 'marginal' because
the NCAA is already considering the two primary is
sues just raised in the bill scholarship limits and
out-of-season health insurance."
Bruce said the NCAA has also instituted a system
in recent years to better address student-athletes' con

cerns a system that Cardinal Council is part of. The
system involves campus organizations like the coun
cil, conference organizations like the Pac-10's stu
dent-athlete council and a national organization.
The student-athletes also tried to meet with Mur
ray, but he was unable to meet with them face-to-face.
The council met with two of his staffers instead.
Bergeron said he thought the visits went well.
"All of the committee members were very recep
tive and appreciated us coming to them and voicing
our opinions," he said.
Bruce, too, said the trip to Sacramento appeared
to be a success.

"After making our rounds, we essentially got a
strong majority of the committee (nine of 13) to com
mit to killing the bill," Bruce estimated. "We didn't
meet with two, or the tally could've been 11 of 13."
The delegation did not try to meet with Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger, but said that should the bill
come before the Assembly, they would want to take
that step.
"If the bill were to pass out of committee and be on
the floor of the Assembly, we would take the next step
of going to the governor," Bergeron said. "Without
his signature, the bill would not come into law."

Football is one of many varsity sports that could be barred from the NCAA if Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver
City) is successful in his bid to pass a "Student-Athlete Bill of Rights."
