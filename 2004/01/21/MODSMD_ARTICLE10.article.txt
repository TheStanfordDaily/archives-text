## 'Loveline' crew the best we can get? 
### 
Tonight, the ASSU Speaker's Bu
reau presents its third event of the
year: "Loveline's" Dr. Drew Pinsky
and Adam Carolla. For those of you
who don't remember, Pinsky and Carolla
hosted a MTV show a few years ago. While
we are happy that the Speaker's Bureau is
hosting another event, if it was going to bring
washed-up MTV personalities to campus, it
might has well have aimed for Jenny Mc-
Carthy. Or if the organizers were really in for
a challenge, they should have tried for Car
men Electra she's even trying to mount a
comeback.
But no. Stanford got Pinsky and Carolla.
On mouthshut.com, Pinsky and Carolla's
show has been dubbed "a terrible concept."
One reviewer warns: "It doesn't get more pa
thetic than this." The mediocre on-air perfor
mance of these two personalities begs the
question: Why do we need to watch one more
albeit live episode of a canceled show?
Since leaving MTV, the two have written a
book, "The Dr. Drew and Adam Book: A
Survival Guide To Life and Love," that was
well-received by critics. Pinsky has also run a
drug-rehab clinic in Southern California,
and the two have worked to put together a
successful speaking tour in recent years.
While we encourage Pinsky and Carolla to
keep up their good work, their resume begs
the question: Couldn't we have done better?
There are scores of students at Stanford with
community service records that rival Pinsky's
and CaroUa's. Need sex advice? Ask a Peer
Health Educator or utilize the resources at the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center. While
Pinsky and Carolla seem to be genuinely good
people who try to help young adults with issues
facing them, it doesn't seem like they will bring
any new perspectives or services to campus.
Last weekend, an array of state and na

tional political heavyweights made stops at
the San Jose Convention Center for the Cal
ifornia Democratic Party's State Conven
tion. Presidential candidate Rep. Dennis
Kucinich, U.S. House of Representatives Mi
nority Leader Nancy Pelosi and U.S. Sen.
Barbara Boxer all were scheduled to speak,
among many others.
We believe Stanford University ought to
have capitalized on the proximity and visibil
ity of the convention by asking some of the
speakers to visit campus. Stanford is not itself
in a large city that attracts a lot attention out
side of this school's academic pursuits, but it
is between two of the most prominent cities
in America San Francisco and San Jose
and it should use those connections when
ever possible to attract important visitors.
Perhaps these speakers should want to
stop by campus without any urging from or
ganizers here, but because people like Lt.
Gov. Cruz Bustamante and San Francisco
Mayor Gavin Newsom, who also spoke at the
convention, are so occupied with their polit
ical lives and already jam-packed schedules,
it may not occur to them that many of their
constituents are at Stanford and deserve
some of their time. It is therefore up to the
administration and student organizations to
seek them out and request their presence at
one of the foremost universities in the Unit
ed States, even if only for an hour or two.
While bringing speakers like Pinsky and
Carolla to campus must have taken some ef
fort, it does not make up for the dearth of
world leaders and influential figures we have
speaking at Stanford. Asking a low-cost, easy
to-book speaker to campus is certainly less
complex than booking Kofi Anan or Nelson
Mandella, but the technical and cost aspects of
bringing these speakers to campus should not
provide an easy excuse for not doing so.
