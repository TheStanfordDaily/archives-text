## MINDFUL MUSINGS Michelle says: Just eat it, already! 
### 
I hope that sometime in your
Stanford career you have the
chance to visit Mendocino. It is
a beautiful little county a few
hours north of Stanford, well
known for its great wines, good
food and picturesque ambiance. I
used to have no quibbles with this
bucolic area, aside from the fact
that it markets to a very upper-crust
crowd, but I recently read that Men
docino is offering up a measure on
March 2 that would ban all geneti
cally engineered food from being
raised or kept in the area, and I am
disappointed to see that such a
pleasant little town has decided to
take this unreasonable action.
I'm sure you've heard of the de
bate regarding genetically modified
organisms (GMOs): Green Peace
refers to them as "frankenfoods;"
Europeans are terrified of anything
closely associated with them and
refuse to import them into the con
tinent; and Taco Bell received terri
ble press a few years ago when it
was discovered that a certain ship
ment of taco shells containing
GMO corn that had not yet been
deemed "safe" for human con
sumption by the FDA. The debate
rages on and neither the Biotech
companies nor the
environment/consumer-protection
groups are easing up. In many Eu
ropean countries, consumer pres
sure against genetic engineering has
been so powerful that you are guar
anteed GMOs will not end up in
your shopping cart, but in the Unit
ed States, one quick trip to the Stern
or Wilbur dining halls and you will
be loading up your plate with
GMOs.
Yes, they are everywhere. Gasp!
You exclaim. I can't eat anymore!
First there was the mercury scare,
so you stopped eating tuna. Then
the first case of mad cow disease ap
peared in the United States, so that
took away your beef. Now I'm
telling you that you're eating genet
ically engineered food everyday.
But please, don't panic and keep on
chowing down your food. You
won't keel over. In fact, there has
yet to be a definitive study demon
strating that GMOs are bad for you.
Yes, there are risks associated with
the insertion of genes from one or
ganism to another, possibly causing
food allergies, but GMOs have to
go through a rigorous process, un
dergoing up to 1,800 tests through
the FDA before they are approved
fit for human consumption, so this
should not be a main concern. If you
were really concerned about what
you ate, you wouldn't be protesting
GMOs, you'd be protesting the
many pesticides sprayed on your
food that are known and proven
carcinogens and neurotoxins. If
you're going to make a fuss about
your food, at least allocate your en
ergy wisely.
What about environmental con

cerns? Many people are worried
that GMOs will introduce a host of
environmental problems. Scientists
and environmental groups are
afraid that "super-weeds" will de
velop when GMO pollen mixes with
nearby plants, creating weeds that
will be resistant to common pesti
cides and herbicides, thereby forc-

ing farmers to
use more toxic
chemicals or sim
ply spray more
frequently. But
there are ways to
minimize this
risk: Farmers can
plant "buffer
zones," where
non- G M O
plants are plant
ed around a field

so that nearby weeds and plants will
always have a variety of genes with
which to combine.
Another environmentally
touchy issue concerns the distur
bance of delicately balanced ecosys
tems with the introduction of new /
foreign genes. A few years ago, an
article came out in the highly es
teemed science publication "Na
ture" detailing a preliminary study
demonstrating that GMO corn
pollen could drift to milkweed
plants, the primary food of monarch
butterflies and warning of the pos
sibility that monarch butterfly pop
ulations could be harmed. The an
nouncement exploded in the popu
lar press and little towns like Mon
tecito had parades against GMOs.
People dressed up like monarch
butterflies and harmoniously
protested the big, bad biotech com
panies. Then a series of comprehen
sive studies coordinated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Agri
culture Research Service division,
were completed, and researchers
determined that only one type of
GMO corn posed any significant
environmental concern a type of
corn that was being phased out by
Monsanto (a major developer of ge
netically engineered crops). Clear
ly, more studies will be needed to
determine the possible and actual
environmental impacts, but before
the panic about GMOs spreads, we
need to have tangible evidence that
GMOs are indeed environmentally
harmful.
I wouldn't give the green light to
every GMO out there on the mar
ket. I still believe much more re
search needs to be done before we
can deem GMOs as completely and
positively safe, but I am also against
the propaganda pervasively spread
by environmental groups, such as
Green Peace, that exaggerate or
misrepresent information about the
technology. Had these groups actu
ally read the study published in Na
ture concerning the monarch but
terflies, they would have realized
that the experiment was performed

in the laboratory and did not dupli
cate real-world environmental con
ditions, and was intended to be a
preliminary report, not a conclusive
body of evidence against GMOs.
Mendocino County's decision to
create a GMO-free zone is only an
other step in the perpetuation of un
warranted fears. GMOs, if carefully
monitored and regulated, have the
potential to not only increase yields
(of vast importance in countries
where malnutrition and undernutri
tion is an issue), but also have the
potential of even reducing the im
pact of agriculture on the environ
ment. Farmers have been "geneti
cally modifying" crops for thou
sands of years, manually selecting
for specific qualities in plants that
they wanted to promote. Genetic
engineering has sped up that pro
cess immensely, allowing farmers to
directly insert desirable genes from
plant relatives or even other
species, hence the term "franken
foods." But these foods need not be
scary nor dangerous: Researchers
can boost the vitamin or macronu
trient content of foods; farmers may
be able to use fewer pesticides if
their crops can manufacture natural
protections against insects; and spe
cific essential fatty acids (omega-3s)
could be incorporated into veg
etable matter fed to farmed fish,
thus lessening the over-fishing
problems associated with aquacul
ture.
In an ideal world, we would all be
eating organic fruits and vegetables
raised in a sustainable manner, but
the reality is that many major agri
cultural companies are still not will
ing to switch to organic methods
and that in developing countries,
the high yields necessary to the feed
populations may not be achievable
through traditional farming meth
ods alone. Many people are con
cerned that biotech companies will
essentially control farmers who
choose to use their GMO products,
making them increasingly reliant on
these technologies, but this can be
ameliorated through increased gov
ernment-funded research or gov
ernment subsidies.
As you go to eat your dinner
today, simply consider your relative
risks. The probability that a geneti
cally engineered apple is going to do
you any damage is probably lower
than the chance that a non-GMO
hamburger and fries will clog up
your arteries.
Hopefully, the folks up in Men
docino will come to their senses
eventually and make the rational
decision, because it really is a great
place to go and I know they mean
the best for their county.

refuse to import them into the con
tinent; and Taco Bell received terri
ble press a few years ago when it
was discovered that a certain ship
ment of taco shells containing
GMO corn that had not yet been
deemed "safe" for human con
sumption by the FDA. The debate
rages on and neither the Biotech
companies nor the
environment/consumer-protection
groups are easing up. In many Eu
ropean countries, consumer pres
sure against genetic engineering has
been so powerful that you are guar
anteed GMOs will not end up in
your shopping cart, but in the Unit
ed States, one quick trip to the Stern
or Wilbur dining halls and you will
be loading up your plate with
GMOs.
Yes, they are everywhere. Gasp!
You exclaim. I can't eat anymore!
First there was the mercury scare,
so you stopped eating tuna. Then
the first case of mad cow disease ap
peared in the United States, so that
took away your beef. Now I'm
telling you that you're eating genet
ically engineered food everyday.
But please, don't panic and keep on
chowing down your food. You
won't keel over. In fact, there has
yet to be a definitive study demon
strating that GMOs are bad for you.
Yes, there are risks associated with
the insertion of genes from one or
ganism to another, possibly causing
food allergies, but GMOs have to
go through a rigorous process, un
dergoing up to 1,800 tests through
the FDA before they are approved
fit for human consumption, so this
should not be a main concern. If you
were really concerned about what
you ate, you wouldn't be protesting
GMOs, you'd be protesting the
many pesticides sprayed on your
food that are known and proven
carcinogens and neurotoxins. If
you're going to make a fuss about
your food, at least allocate your en
ergy wisely.
What about environmental con

cerns? Many people are worried
that GMOs will introduce a host of
environmental problems. Scientists
and environmental groups are
afraid that "super-weeds" will de
velop when GMO pollen mixes with
nearby plants, creating weeds that
will be resistant to common pesti
cides and herbicides, thereby forc-

ing farmers to
use more toxic
chemicals or sim
ply spray more
frequently. But
there are ways to
minimize this
risk: Farmers can
plant "buffer
zones," where
non- G M O
plants are plant
ed around a field

so that nearby weeds and plants will
always have a variety of genes with
which to combine.
Another environmentally
touchy issue concerns the distur
bance of delicately balanced ecosys
tems with the introduction of new /
foreign genes. A few years ago, an
article came out in the highly es
teemed science publication "Na
ture" detailing a preliminary study
demonstrating that GMO corn
pollen could drift to milkweed
plants, the primary food of monarch
butterflies and warning of the pos
sibility that monarch butterfly pop
ulations could be harmed. The an
nouncement exploded in the popu
lar press and little towns like Mon
tecito had parades against GMOs.
People dressed up like monarch
butterflies and harmoniously
protested the big, bad biotech com
panies. Then a series of comprehen
sive studies coordinated by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Agri
culture Research Service division,
were completed, and researchers
determined that only one type of
GMO corn posed any significant
environmental concern a type of
corn that was being phased out by
Monsanto (a major developer of ge
netically engineered crops). Clear
ly, more studies will be needed to
determine the possible and actual
environmental impacts, but before
the panic about GMOs spreads, we
need to have tangible evidence that
GMOs are indeed environmentally
harmful.
I wouldn't give the green light to
every GMO out there on the mar
ket. I still believe much more re
search needs to be done before we
can deem GMOs as completely and
positively safe, but I am also against
the propaganda pervasively spread
by environmental groups, such as
Green Peace, that exaggerate or
misrepresent information about the
technology. Had these groups actu
ally read the study published in Na
ture concerning the monarch but
terflies, they would have realized
that the experiment was performed

in the laboratory and did not dupli
cate real-world environmental con
ditions, and was intended to be a
preliminary report, not a conclusive
body of evidence against GMOs.
Mendocino County's decision to
create a GMO-free zone is only an
other step in the perpetuation of un
warranted fears. GMOs, if carefully
monitored and regulated, have the
potential to not only increase yields
(of vast importance in countries
where malnutrition and undernutri
tion is an issue), but also have the
potential of even reducing the im
pact of agriculture on the environ
ment. Farmers have been "geneti
cally modifying" crops for thou
sands of years, manually selecting
for specific qualities in plants that
they wanted to promote. Genetic
engineering has sped up that pro
cess immensely, allowing farmers to
directly insert desirable genes from
plant relatives or even other
species, hence the term "franken
foods." But these foods need not be
scary nor dangerous: Researchers
can boost the vitamin or macronu
trient content of foods; farmers may
be able to use fewer pesticides if
their crops can manufacture natural
protections against insects; and spe
cific essential fatty acids (omega-3s)
could be incorporated into veg
etable matter fed to farmed fish,
thus lessening the over-fishing
problems associated with aquacul
ture.
In an ideal world, we would all be
eating organic fruits and vegetables
raised in a sustainable manner, but
the reality is that many major agri
cultural companies are still not will
ing to switch to organic methods
and that in developing countries,
the high yields necessary to the feed
populations may not be achievable
through traditional farming meth
ods alone. Many people are con
cerned that biotech companies will
essentially control farmers who
choose to use their GMO products,
making them increasingly reliant on
these technologies, but this can be
ameliorated through increased gov
ernment-funded research or gov
ernment subsidies.
As you go to eat your dinner
today, simply consider your relative
risks. The probability that a geneti
cally engineered apple is going to do
you any damage is probably lower
than the chance that a non-GMO
hamburger and fries will clog up
your arteries.
Hopefully, the folks up in Men
docino will come to their senses
eventually and make the rational
decision, because it really is a great
place to go and I know they mean
the best for their county.

I hope that sometime in your
Stanford career you have the
chance to visit Mendocino. It is
a beautiful little county a few
hours north of Stanford, well
known for its great wines, good
food and picturesque ambiance. I
used to have no quibbles with this
bucolic area, aside from the fact
that it markets to a very upper-crust
crowd, but I recently read that Men
docino is offering up a measure on
March 2 that would ban all geneti
cally engineered food from being
raised or kept in the area, and I am
disappointed to see that such a
pleasant little town has decided to
take this unreasonable action.
