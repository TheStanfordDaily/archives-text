## Senior has no regrets about Berlin 
### DAN URBAN GUEST COLUMNIST 
If you've asked me how I liked
my fall quarter at the Stanford pro
gram in Berlin, please don't take it
personally if I brushed you off with
"good" and tried to change the sub
ject. It really was "good" in the best
sense of the overused word, but I
probably just didn't have enough
time or energy to give you a proper
answer.
I'm equally reticent when I'm
asked just why I had such a good
time. Not because I can't think of
anything that I remember fondly,
but because I can't think of any
thing that will immediately impress.
If you went to Oxford, you can tell
people that you had a pint at the
same table where J.R.R. Tolkien
asked his friend C.S. Lewis what he
thought about writing a book on
hobbits and rings of power.
Everybody will marvel at your
sophistication when you come back
from Paris talking about the Louvre
between drags on your cigarette. If
your stories about climbing to the
top of Brunelleschi's dome in Flo
rence don't impress anybody, at
least the designer threads you
brought back might.
Ten seconds and you're done;
your acquaintance has received the
quick answer she was hoping for
and walks away satisfied knowing
that your overseas experience was
uniquely cool.
It's not that easy in Berlin's
case. If I tell you about Potsdamer

Platz or the Gedachtnis Kirche or
Unter den Linden, you'd give me a
very blank stare (or turn this page of
The Daily to read about something
cooler like our basketball team).
What I loved so much about
Berlin was not any one particular
aspect, but just simply being there.
Small, almost seemingly mundane
things, when added together, creat
ed a deep and genuine appreciation
for life in the city. Like stopping at
the bakery at my U-bahn (subway)
station every morning on my way to
the center for a Streuselschneckel
(I'm not making this name up), run
ning through one of the city's many
tree-filled parks or deciding on a
whim to go to the opera and getting
in for 10 bucks despite wearing blue
jeans and a T-shirt.
If I had to pick a single highlight
from the quarter, it probably
wouldn't be anything that hap
pened in Berlin, but Slovenia. Most
of the 18 of us in the program
couldn't have found the country on
a map before going (Americans at
Stanford, maybe, but Americans
nonetheless), but our five days
there were a blast.
Mrs. Helen Bing, or Bling Bing
as we affectionately call her, funded
the trip for the Berlin and Florence
programs. Of course, staying in a
hostel that used to be a prison, the
invitation to the American ambas
sador's house and the personal Q
and A session with the former
prime minister who led the nation
out of the former Yugoslavia were
hits.

For me, though, no memory will
last longer than the snowball fight at
a Slovenian castle that sat at least
100 meters above a lake, and trying
to throw the snowballs far enough
to hit the water. See, it's the small
things.
When people ask me about
Berlin, Slovenia is one of the first
things in my mind, and all because a
generous woman lavished some of
her money on a bunch of kids she'll
probably never even meet.
You just can't predict what
you'll love so much about your time
abroad, which is one reason why
you just need to kick yourself out
the door and go.
There are always plenty of rea
sons not to the time away from
friends, the uneasiness over trans
planting yourself into a new place
with new people, the academic hic
cup in your perfect four-year plan,
the lack of regular water with ice
cubes and free refills... the list goes
on.
I missed a third of my senior
year with friends whom I might not
see very much after this spring, and
the housing I got stuck in is less than
ideal. But I have no regrets, and I
highly doubt you would, either.

Daniel Urban is a senior in me
chanical engineering who loves
Berlin but is thrilled to be back in
the States where Baja Fresh lets him
pile his cup full of ice and refill his
Sprite as many times as he wants.
