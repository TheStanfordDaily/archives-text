# Sluggers must step up for Card
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
There's an old baseball adage that says "good
pitching beats good hitting." Fans will always debate
the idea and offensive powerhouses will always hope
that it doesn't hold true, but for Stanford coach Mark
Marquess, it's a fact.
"The better teams have better pitching. I've always
felt that good pitching gets good hitting out," Mar
quess said.
Guess that means the Cardinal will have to shoot
for great hitting.
"Normally when you do well by that I mean get
ting to the postseason and maybe winning the league
two or three of your players have their best year,
and that's what happened to us last year," Marquess
said.
Last season's Stanford squad was highlighted by
breakout years for three players: Ryan Garko, Carlos
Quentin and current junior Danny Putnam. The trio
topped the team's offensive stats, hitting .402, .396
and .348, respectively.
Now with the departures of Garko and Quentin
who drove in a combined 156 runs last year the
Cardinal has the task of rebuilding its hard-hitting
lineup.
"It seems like we always lose a couple of cogs in the
lineup every year and we always seem to rebound
pretty well," said senior outfielder Sam Fuld. "I think
that our pitching is good enough to carry us, but there
are always guys that are ready to step up and have
breakthrough years [offensively]."
Those career years could very likely come from
anywhere in the Stanford dugout. Marquess said that
Fuld, Putnam, seniors Brian Hall and Jonny Ash, ju
nior Chris Carter and sophomores John Mayberry, Jr.
and Jed Lowrie all have the potential to make huge
offensive impacts for the Cardinal.
"Danny Putnam has the ability to have a year sim
ilar to [Quentin's]," Marquess said. "He's very capa
ble and so is Mayberry. I think that Brian Hall will
have a career year. He's been about a .280 hitter, but
he's the fastest guy on the team and if he has his best
year, that will help us."
Putnam, who hit 16 homers last season —just two
shy of the club leader will likely move into the
number three spot in the lineup. Carter, who is the
squad's designated hitter and at times, its left fielder,
could hit at clean-up.
Marquess said that Mayberry, Jr., after missing the
last quarter of the 2003 season due to a thumb injury,
is more than ready to step back into the batter's box
for the Cardinal and will definitely hit somewhere in
the heart of the lineup.

After losing two of its top producers to the Major Leagues, the Stanford baseball team will have to step up offensive production
to achieve its fifth-straight trip to the College World Series.
that's been nagging you and per
form at the highest level," Mayber
ry, Jr. said of his injury, which affect
ed his swing last season. "Last year
was my freshman year and I was
kind of up and down. I had high mo
ments and low, so this year I'm
working on staying consistent."
The three-four-five punch of the
Stanford lineup will be augmented
at the lead-off spot by Fuld, who
brings an important leadership com
ponent to the Cardinal, in addition
to a bat that could break more than
a few offensive records by June.
The owner of the fourth-best
Cardinal batting average, however,
managed to cause skepticism about
his offensive power last year. In an
article on Fuld last season, Baseball
America pondered the cause for the
centerfielder's hitting slump, which
resulted in a .321 average.
"If last year was an off year and

he has a better year, then we'll take
that anytime," Marquess said with a
smile. "But it's all relative. For Fuld,
.321 is a slump, but hitting .321 is
great in college baseball."
Fuld said that he was ready to im
prove the batting average, though as
a lead-off hitter, his main focus is
just to get on base he led the 2003
squad in runs scored.
The All-American also admitted
that breaking a couple of records
would be great, but that the thought
is completely secondary in his hopes
for the season.
"My whole thought process is
putting the team first and the indi
vidual second. I'm focused on the
team's success," Fuld said.
With Stanford's large contingent
of returning players seven of
whom batted above .290 last season
and a few newcomers like fresh
men Adam Sorgi and Jim Rapoport,
team success seems well within
reach.
"We've got the same elements of
power and speed, basically every as
pect [that helped us win last sea
son]," Mayberry, Jr. said.

After losing two of its top producers to the Major Leagues, the Stanford baseball team will have to step up offensive production
to achieve its fifth-straight trip to the College World Series.
that's been nagging you and per
form at the highest level," Mayber
ry, Jr. said of his injury, which affect
ed his swing last season. "Last year
was my freshman year and I was
kind of up and down. I had high mo
ments and low, so this year I'm
working on staying consistent."
The three-four-five punch of the
Stanford lineup will be augmented
at the lead-off spot by Fuld, who
brings an important leadership com
ponent to the Cardinal, in addition
to a bat that could break more than
a few offensive records by June.
The owner of the fourth-best
Cardinal batting average, however,
managed to cause skepticism about
his offensive power last year. In an
article on Fuld last season, Baseball
America pondered the cause for the
centerfielder's hitting slump, which
resulted in a .321 average.
"If last year was an off year and

he has a better year, then we'll take
that anytime," Marquess said with a
smile. "But it's all relative. For Fuld,
.321 is a slump, but hitting .321 is
great in college baseball."
Fuld said that he was ready to im
prove the batting average, though as
a lead-off hitter, his main focus is
just to get on base he led the 2003
squad in runs scored.
The All-American also admitted
that breaking a couple of records
would be great, but that the thought
is completely secondary in his hopes
for the season.
"My whole thought process is
putting the team first and the indi
vidual second. I'm focused on the
team's success," Fuld said.
With Stanford's large contingent
of returning players seven of
whom batted above .290 last season
and a few newcomers like fresh
men Adam Sorgi and Jim Rapoport,
team success seems well within
reach.
"We've got the same elements of
power and speed, basically every as
pect [that helped us win last sea
son]," Mayberry, Jr. said.
There's an old baseball adage that says "good
pitching beats good hitting." Fans will always debate
the idea and offensive powerhouses will always hope
that it doesn't hold true, but for Stanford coach Mark
Marquess, it's a fact.
"The better teams have better pitching. I've always
felt that good pitching gets good hitting out," Mar
quess said.
Guess that means the Cardinal will have to shoot
for great hitting.
"Normally when you do well by that I mean get
ting to the postseason and maybe winning the league
two or three of your players have their best year,
and that's what happened to us last year," Marquess
said.
Last season's Stanford squad was highlighted by
breakout years for three players: Ryan Garko, Carlos
Quentin and current junior Danny Putnam. The trio
topped the team's offensive stats, hitting .402, .396
and .348, respectively.
Now with the departures of Garko and Quentin
who drove in a combined 156 runs last year the
Cardinal has the task of rebuilding its hard-hitting
lineup.
"It seems like we always lose a couple of cogs in the
lineup every year and we always seem to rebound
pretty well," said senior outfielder Sam Fuld. "I think
that our pitching is good enough to carry us, but there
are always guys that are ready to step up and have
breakthrough years [offensively]."
Those career years could very likely come from
anywhere in the Stanford dugout. Marquess said that
Fuld, Putnam, seniors Brian Hall and Jonny Ash, ju
nior Chris Carter and sophomores John Mayberry, Jr.
and Jed Lowrie all have the potential to make huge
offensive impacts for the Cardinal.
"Danny Putnam has the ability to have a year sim
ilar to [Quentin's]," Marquess said. "He's very capa
ble and so is Mayberry. I think that Brian Hall will
have a career year. He's been about a .280 hitter, but
he's the fastest guy on the team and if he has his best
year, that will help us."
Putnam, who hit 16 homers last season —just two
shy of the club leader will likely move into the
number three spot in the lineup. Carter, who is the
squad's designated hitter and at times, its left fielder,
could hit at clean-up.
Marquess said that Mayberry, Jr., after missing the
last quarter of the 2003 season due to a thumb injury,
is more than ready to step back into the batter's box
for the Cardinal and will definitely hit somewhere in
the heart of the lineup.
