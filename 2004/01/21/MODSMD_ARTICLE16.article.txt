# Short and sweet, Putnam prepares to lead team
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford offense lost two of its
most powerful weapons when catcher
Ryan Garko, a first-team All-American
and the Pac-10 co-Player of the Year,
and right fielder Carlos Quentin, a first
round pick in last year's draft, left the
Farm and joined the farm systems of the
Cleveland Indians and Arizona Dia
mondbacks, respectively.
Good thing junior left fielder Danny
Putnam's still around to provide some
pop in the middle of the order and help
his teammates out. Putnam, along with
senior center fielder Sam Fuld, will as

sume more of a leadership role this year
when Stanford prepares to start the sea
son without two of the most potent of
fensive players in recent team history.
"My role is the same in terms of al
ways playing hard and pulling for team
mates, or dropping a word to a guy, like,
'Hey, keep your head up,' " Putnam said.
"It's just that I'll be more vocal this year.
I sort of hung in the shadows last year,
just watching Garko and Quentin, so this
year I'll have to step up."
If they hope to emulate his success,
Putnam's teammates will listen. He fin
ished second on the team to Garko with
16 home runs and 66 RBI last year as a
sophomore, his breakout season after

seeing sparse playing time his freshman
year. Because of that performance he
was named to the pre-season All-Amer
ica team, along with Fuld and sopho
more first baseman John Mayberry, Jr.
This year Putnam will be the main cog in
the Cardinal offense, likely batting in the
third or fourth spot.
Though the stats indicate otherwise,
Putnam is not an imposing figure. He is
listed at 5-foot-10, one of the shortest
players on the team. He is polite and soft
spoken. But don't try telling pitcher Mark
Romanczuk that he's not scary when he
has a Louisville Slugger in his hands.
"I've probably faced 1,000 hit
ters in my life, and Danny's proba
bly one of the three toughest to get
out," Romanczuk said. "He just
has no weaknesses."
That's high praise from a mem
ber of last year's U.S. National
team, on which Putnam also
played.
Putnam clearly has great physi
cal tools, but it is his tireless work
ethic that sets him apart as a hitter.
Though he was already one of the
best hitters in college baseball, Put
nam said that he worked on "con
trolling the strike zone" during his
summer with the National team.
"Every time I have a bad day,
after practice I'll say, why was
today bad?," he said. "Well, the
answer's usually because I swung
at five or six pitches out of the
zone. I'm trying to put a good
swing on a ball in the zone, and if I
can do that the ball will go where it
needs to go."
It is remarkable that a hitter
like Putnam leaves so much to
chance, but he seems to know that
his success as a hitter depends on
the pitcher as well. Romanczuk
said that Putnam is constantly

making adjustments.
"If you throw a pitch that works
once, he'll be ready for it the sec
ond time," Romanczuk said.
"You'll think, 'OK, I threw that
pitch once, I can get him on it
again,' but he'll adjust to it... It's
tough to get him out, and you have
to be at your best to succeed."
Hopefully, Putnam's tenacity
and work ethic will rub off on his
teammates. But it is just as impor
tant that his confidence does, too.
"We've gone to the World Series
for five straight years, but no one's
happy with winning the Pac-10 or
getting to our sixth straight World
Series," he said. "We're going to get
there and win it this time."
If the whole team is as dedicat
ed as Putnam is, that prediction
should come true.
It seems likely that he will be se
lected in the first few rounds of the
draft, but he says that his end goal
is beyond that.
"My goal since I was a little kid
has always been to be an impact
player in the big leagues," he said.
"All I can control is loving to play
out here, and see where it takes
me.
Putnam is well on his way to re
alizing that goal. But he knows that
he will need the help of his team
mates to fulfill his dream of win
ning the College World Series.

draft, but he says that his end goal
is beyond that.
"My goal since I was a little kid
has always been to be an impact
player in the big leagues," he said.
"All I can control is loving to play
out here, and see where it takes
me.
Putnam is well on his way to re
alizing that goal. But he knows that
he will need the help of his team
mates to fulfill his dream of win
ning the College World Series.
The Stanford offense lost two of its
most powerful weapons when catcher
Ryan Garko, a first-team All-American
and the Pac-10 co-Player of the Year,
and right fielder Carlos Quentin, a first
round pick in last year's draft, left the
Farm and joined the farm systems of the
Cleveland Indians and Arizona Dia
mondbacks, respectively.
Good thing junior left fielder Danny
Putnam's still around to provide some
pop in the middle of the order and help
his teammates out. Putnam, along with
senior center fielder Sam Fuld, will as

sume more of a leadership role this year
when Stanford prepares to start the sea
son without two of the most potent of
fensive players in recent team history.
"My role is the same in terms of al
ways playing hard and pulling for team
mates, or dropping a word to a guy, like,
'Hey, keep your head up,' " Putnam said.
"It's just that I'll be more vocal this year.
I sort of hung in the shadows last year,
just watching Garko and Quentin, so this
year I'll have to step up."
If they hope to emulate his success,
Putnam's teammates will listen. He fin
ished second on the team to Garko with
16 home runs and 66 RBI last year as a
sophomore, his breakout season after

seeing sparse playing time his freshman
year. Because of that performance he
was named to the pre-season All-Amer
ica team, along with Fuld and sopho
more first baseman John Mayberry, Jr.
This year Putnam will be the main cog in
the Cardinal offense, likely batting in the
third or fourth spot.
Though the stats indicate otherwise,
Putnam is not an imposing figure. He is
listed at 5-foot-10, one of the shortest
players on the team. He is polite and soft
spoken. But don't try telling pitcher Mark
Romanczuk that he's not scary when he
has a Louisville Slugger in his hands.
"I've probably faced 1,000 hit
ters in my life, and Danny's proba
bly one of the three toughest to get
out," Romanczuk said. "He just
has no weaknesses."
That's high praise from a mem
ber of last year's U.S. National
team, on which Putnam also
played.
Putnam clearly has great physi
cal tools, but it is his tireless work
ethic that sets him apart as a hitter.
Though he was already one of the
best hitters in college baseball, Put
nam said that he worked on "con
trolling the strike zone" during his
summer with the National team.
"Every time I have a bad day,
after practice I'll say, why was
today bad?," he said. "Well, the
answer's usually because I swung
at five or six pitches out of the
zone. I'm trying to put a good
swing on a ball in the zone, and if I
can do that the ball will go where it
needs to go."
It is remarkable that a hitter
like Putnam leaves so much to
chance, but he seems to know that
his success as a hitter depends on
the pitcher as well. Romanczuk
said that Putnam is constantly

making adjustments.
"If you throw a pitch that works
once, he'll be ready for it the sec
ond time," Romanczuk said.
"You'll think, 'OK, I threw that
pitch once, I can get him on it
again,' but he'll adjust to it... It's
tough to get him out, and you have
to be at your best to succeed."
Hopefully, Putnam's tenacity
and work ethic will rub off on his
teammates. But it is just as impor
tant that his confidence does, too.
"We've gone to the World Series
for five straight years, but no one's
happy with winning the Pac-10 or
getting to our sixth straight World
Series," he said. "We're going to get
there and win it this time."
If the whole team is as dedicat
ed as Putnam is, that prediction
should come true.
It seems likely that he will be se
lected in the first few rounds of the
draft, but he says that his end goal
is beyond that.
"My goal since I was a little kid
has always been to be an impact
player in the big leagues," he said.
"All I can control is loving to play
out here, and see where it takes
me.
Putnam is well on his way to re
alizing that goal. But he knows that
he will need the help of his team
mates to fulfill his dream of win
ning the College World Series.
