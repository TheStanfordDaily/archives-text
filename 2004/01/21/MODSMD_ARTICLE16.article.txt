# Short and sweet, Putnam prepares to lead team
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford offense lost two of its
most powerful weapons when catcher
Ryan Garko, a first-team All-American
and the Pac-10 co-Player of the Year,
and right fielder Carlos Quentin, a first
round pick in last year's draft, left the
Farm and joined the farm systems of the
Cleveland Indians and Arizona Dia
mondbacks, respectively.
Good thing junior left fielder Danny
Putnam's still around to provide some
pop in the middle of the order and help
his teammates out. Putnam, along with
senior center fielder Sam Fuld, will as

sume more of a leadership role this year
when Stanford prepares to start the sea
son without two of the most potent of
fensive players in recent team history.
"My role is the same in terms of al
ways playing hard and pulling for team
mates, or dropping a word to a guy, like,
'Hey, keep your head up,' " Putnam said.
"It's just that I'll be more vocal this year.
I sort of hung in the shadows last year,
just watching Garko and Quentin, so this
year I'll have to step up."
If they hope to emulate his success,
Putnam's teammates will listen. He fin
ished second on the team to Garko with
16 home runs and 66 RBI last year as a
sophomore, his breakout season after

seeing sparse playing time his freshman
year. Because of that performance he
was named to the pre-season All-Amer
ica team, along with Fuld and sopho
more first baseman John Mayberry, Jr.
This year Putnam will be the main cog in
the Cardinal offense, likely batting in the
third or fourth spot.
Though the stats indicate otherwise,
Putnam is not an imposing figure. He is
listed at 5-foot-10, one of the shortest
players on the team. He is polite and soft
spoken. But don't try telling pitcher Mark
Romanczuk that he's not scary when he
has a Louisville Slugger in his hands.
