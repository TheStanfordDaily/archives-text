# No.2 Cardinal stays in front of the Pac
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
By and large, it was business as usual in the Pacific-10
Conference last week, with one big exception. Desmon
Farmer tallied a career-high 40 points as host Southern Cal
ifornia stunned then-No. 7 Arizona, 99-90, on Thursday.
Stanford defeated California, 68-61, on Saturday, en
abling them to move up to No. 2 in both national polls be
cause of formerly top-ranked Connecticut's loss to No. 7
North Carolina that same day.
The Pac-10 is not as deep this year as it has been in past
years, but all in all last week's action showed solid parity.
Other than Stanford, Oregon was the only team to make it
through the weekend without a loss, defeating both Wash
ington schools.
Against Arizona, Southern Cal played consistently from
start to finish, winning both halves of the game. Arizona
placed seven players in double figures, but did not get a lead
ing effort from anyone, while Farmer galvanized the Trojan
effort.
The Wildcats shot 41 percent, while USC shot 52 percent.
Farmer got his 40 on just 19 shots, hitting 7-of-ll three-point
ers. Errick Craven contributed an unexpected 12 points off
the bench and Greg Guenther Jr. had 11 points and 11
boards.
The Trojans' high didn't last for long, though, as Arizona
State came in on Saturday, shot 61 percent including 10-
of-14 accuracy on three-pointers and blitzed USC, 100-
85. Farmer scored 26 points on 7-of-17 shooting, but the Tro
jans shot just 39 percent, while Ike Diogu scored 27 points on

just nine shots, including 12-of-12 free throws and an un
characteristic 3-of-3 from downtown. Jamal Hill added 20 off
the bench.
Stanford and Cal played a sloppy first half, combining for
just 41 points, but both teams warmed up and scored 44
points apiece in the second half. Richard Midgley exploded
for 19 second-half points, while Amit Tamir added 15 and
Leon Powe 12 for Cal.
Stanford made 25-of-28 free throws to hold off the Gold
en Bears. For the Cardinal, Josh Childress had 10 points and
10 boards and Matt Lottich added 15 points and a team-high
three assists.
Arizona ended its weekend on a positive note, routing
UCLA, 97-72. Lute Olson became the Wildcats' all-time
winningest coach, while Ben Howland's Bruins suffered
their first conference loss. Channing Frye posted 26 points
and 10 boards, while Hassan Adams had 23 points and nine
rebounds and Salim Stoudamire chipped in 25 points.
UCLA got 19 from Dijon Thompson and 18 from Trevor
Ariza but shot just 40 percent, while Arizona shot 54 percent
and hit 14-of-23 from long range.
The Bruins were coming off a 66-58 win over Arizona
State on Thursday. The Sun Devils were paced by 17 from
Steve Moore and 15 from Diogu, but the pair combined to
shoot just 7-of-29 from the field. Thompson had 19 and Ariza
16 for UCLA, while T.J. Cummings added 21 points and 12
boards to lead the Bruins.
In last week's low-profile action, the Washington schools
visited the Oregon schools.
Oregon defeated Washington, 84-74, on Thursday. Luke
Jackson scored 24 and had seven rebounds and seven assists,

but 5-foot-10 senior James Davis sparked the victory with his
5-of-6 performance from downtown. The Huskies were led
by Brandon Roy's 18 on 8-of-10 shooting, while sparkplug
Nate Robinson added 16 off the bench.
In a sedate contest, Oregon State held off Washington
State, 51-42, on Thursday. David Lucas was the only partici
pant to score in double figures, and he had 21 points on 10-
of-15 shooting. The Cougars were led by Ezenwa Ukeagu's
nine points and shot an abysmal 29 percent from the field.
The two teams combined to shoot 5-of-29 on three-pointers.
The Cougars fared no better on Saturday, falling to the
Ducks, 60-45. Jackson scored 19 and Davis had 10 on 4-of-6
shooting. The Cougars once again failed to produce a dou
ble-digit scorer, as Shami Gill led the team with nine points
and 13 rebounds.
In a completely antithetical game, Washington out
gunned the Bears in overtime, 103-99, on Saturday. The
Huskies were, not surprisingly, led by Robinson, who came
off the bench to score an energetic 25 points including a
game-tying three-pointer at the end of regulation.
The Huskies rallied from a 16-point second-half deficit in
gaining their first conference victory of the year. Lucas had
20 and Chris Stephens had 23 to lead the Beavers, while Will
Conroy had 19 and Brandon Roy 17 to aid the Huskies.
Tomorrow, Oregon State plays at No. 14 Arizona, No. 2

Saturday, Cal hosts UCLA, USC comes to Stanford, Ore
gon State takes a trip to Arizona State and Washington
comes calling on rival Washington State.

through the weekend without a loss, defeating both Wash
ington schools.

boards.

State came in on Saturday, shot 61 percent including 10-
of-14 accuracy on three-pointers and blitzed USC, 100-
85. Farmer scored 26 points on 7-of-17 shooting, but the Tro
jans shot just 39 percent, while Ike Diogu scored 27 points on

just nine shots, including 12-of-12 free throws and an un
characteristic 3-of-3 from downtown. Jamal Hill added 20 off
the bench.
Stanford and Cal played a sloppy first half, combining for
just 41 points, but both teams warmed up and scored 44

for 19 second-half points, while Amit Tamir added 15 and
Leon Powe 12 for Cal.

10 boards and Matt Lottich added 15 points and a team-high
three assists.

UCLA, 97-72. Lute Olson became the Wildcats' all-time

Ariza but shot just 40 percent, while Arizona shot 54 percent
and hit 14-of-23 from long range.
The Bruins were coming off a 66-58 win over Arizona
State on Thursday. The Sun Devils were paced by 17 from
Steve Moore and 15 from Diogu, but the pair combined to
shoot just 7-of-29 from the field. Thompson had 19 and Ariza
16 for UCLA, while T.J. Cummings added 21 points and 12
boards to lead the Bruins.
In last week's low-profile action, the Washington schools
visited the Oregon schools.

5-of-6 performance from downtown. The Huskies were led
by Brandon Roy's 18 on 8-of-10 shooting, while sparkplug
Nate Robinson added 16 off the bench.

State, 51-42, on Thursday. David Lucas was the only partici
