# Tragedy overshadows Card win over Cal
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's victory over the California
women's basketball last weekend was
overshadowed by the tragic news that
California reserve Alisa Lewis died
Monday morning from apparent menin
gitis.
The 20-year-old junior from Spokane,
Wash., was rushed to the hospital suffer
ing from severe flu-like symptoms and
though the final cause of death will not
be determined until more test results are
in, the team and some of the staff have
been treated with precautionary antibi
otics, as was the Stanford team. Universi
ty health officials said that bacterial
meningitis is rare and not spread through
casual contact. Following established
public health procedures, the university
informed city and county public health

officials.
At a press conference on Tuesday,
California head coach Caren Horstmey
er, stated, "Alisa was one of the nicest,
hardest working players I've had the op
portunity to coach. We're all in a state of
shock."
Further information regarding memo
rial services and the team's scheduled
games in Southern California this week
end was unavailable at press time.
No. 6 Stanford's 63-53 win against Cal
(9-7, 2-5 Pacific 10 Conference) this
weekend improved its overall record to
14-2, keeping the Cardinal unbeaten in
conference play. Stanford was led by the
efforts of senior forward Nicole Powell
who collected her eighth double-double
on the season and 38th overall with 25
points and 11 rebounds. Stanford will
take to the road this weekend against
UCLA and the University of Southern

California to try and maintain its confer
ence streak.
In other Pac-10 play, the University of
Arizona (14-4, 6-1) beat both the SoCal
squads at home to remain one game be
hind the Cardinal. The victories extend
ed the Wildcats' home-winning streak to
23 games, thanks in part to the efforts of
Pac-10 Player of the Week, sophomore
center Shawntinice Polk who shot 80.0
percent from the field this weekend on
16-of-20 shooting. Polk scored 17 points
and garnered a career-high four steals
during Arizona's 75-64 win over the
Women of Troy and added another 21
points and 13 boards for her 28th career
double-double as the Wildcats defeated
the Bruins 70-54.
USC (8-7, 5-2) for its part, avoided a
complete sweep in the desert by edging
Arizona State (10-6, 4-3) Saturday 68-65.
The Women of Troy started their sev

enth lineup of the season against the Sun
Devils with freshmen Eshaya Murphy,
Jamie Hagiya and Jamie Funn, sopho
more Meghan Gnekow and senior Ebony
Hoffman.
Murphy averaged a team-best of 13
points over the weekend and helped her
team grab sole possession of the third
spot in the Pac-10.
UCLA (8-8, 3-4) did not fare as well in
the neighboring state, falling to the Sun
Devils 73-58. Arizona State was led by
sophomore forward Kristen Kovesdy,
who scored 24 points while junior Betsy
Boardman added 16. The win ties the
team with Oregon State for the fourth
spot in conference standings. The Sun
Devils out-rebounded the Bruins 44-27
in the win with sophomore Amy Denson
grabbing a season-high 12 boards.
Oregon State (10-6, 4-3) split
its road trip, defeating Washing
ton State (4-13, 0-8) 62-51 on
Thursday in a game that saw se
nior post Brina Chaney break the
school's blocked shot record with
her 177 th career block. Oregon
State saw another player step up
big against Washington (10-7, 3-
5) as junior guard Shannon How
ell scored a career-high 40 points
in Saturday's 87-74 loss. Howell
shot 14-for-28 from the field, in
cluding 5-of-10 from behind the
three and was a perfect 7-for-7 at
the free throw line. Despite Sat
urday's loss, the Beavers remain
in the top half of the conference

standings.
Washington's sweep began
with a huge win over Oregon (10-
7, 2-5), 95-50. The score is the
highest seen in the Pac-10 this
season as freshman Breanne
Watson led her team with a ca
reer-high 22 points. The Huskies
maintained their momentum
heading into Saturday's game
against Oregon State behind se
nior Gioconda Mendiola who
also notched a career-high 22
points that included six three
pointers.
Oregon remains just behind
Washington in conference stand
ings after splitting the weekend,
beating Washington State 60-50.
With another sweep this week
end, the Cardinal will clearly sep
arate itself from the rest of the
Pac-10, while the rest of the con
ference seems to be battling for
second place.

Senior forward Nicole Powell scored 25 points in the women basketball
team's 63-53 win over California at Haas Pavilion on Friday night.
Stanford's victory over the California
women's basketball last weekend was
overshadowed by the tragic news that
California reserve Alisa Lewis died
Monday morning from apparent menin
gitis.
The 20-year-old junior from Spokane,
Wash., was rushed to the hospital suffer
ing from severe flu-like symptoms and
though the final cause of death will not
be determined until more test results are
in, the team and some of the staff have
been treated with precautionary antibi
otics, as was the Stanford team. Universi
ty health officials said that bacterial
meningitis is rare and not spread through
casual contact. Following established
public health procedures, the university
informed city and county public health

officials.
At a press conference on Tuesday,
California head coach Caren Horstmey
er, stated, "Alisa was one of the nicest,
hardest working players I've had the op
portunity to coach. We're all in a state of
shock."
Further information regarding memo
rial services and the team's scheduled
games in Southern California this week
end was unavailable at press time.
No. 6 Stanford's 63-53 win against Cal
(9-7, 2-5 Pacific 10 Conference) this
weekend improved its overall record to
14-2, keeping the Cardinal unbeaten in
conference play. Stanford was led by the
efforts of senior forward Nicole Powell
who collected her eighth double-double
on the season and 38th overall with 25
points and 11 rebounds. Stanford will
take to the road this weekend against
UCLA and the University of Southern

California to try and maintain its confer
ence streak.
In other Pac-10 play, the University of
Arizona (14-4, 6-1) beat both the SoCal
squads at home to remain one game be
hind the Cardinal. The victories extend
ed the Wildcats' home-winning streak to
23 games, thanks in part to the efforts of
Pac-10 Player of the Week, sophomore
center Shawntinice Polk who shot 80.0
percent from the field this weekend on
16-of-20 shooting. Polk scored 17 points
and garnered a career-high four steals
during Arizona's 75-64 win over the
Women of Troy and added another 21
points and 13 boards for her 28th career
double-double as the Wildcats defeated
the Bruins 70-54.
USC (8-7, 5-2) for its part, avoided a
complete sweep in the desert by edging
Arizona State (10-6, 4-3) Saturday 68-65.
The Women of Troy started their sev

enth lineup of the season against the Sun
Devils with freshmen Eshaya Murphy,
Jamie Hagiya and Jamie Funn, sopho
more Meghan Gnekow and senior Ebony
Hoffman.
Murphy averaged a team-best of 13
points over the weekend and helped her
team grab sole possession of the third
spot in the Pac-10.
UCLA (8-8, 3-4) did not fare as well in
the neighboring state, falling to the Sun
Devils 73-58. Arizona State was led by
sophomore forward Kristen Kovesdy,
who scored 24 points while junior Betsy
Boardman added 16. The win ties the
team with Oregon State for the fourth
spot in conference standings. The Sun
Devils out-rebounded the Bruins 44-27
in the win with sophomore Amy Denson
grabbing a season-high 12 boards.
Oregon State (10-6, 4-3) split
its road trip, defeating Washing
ton State (4-13, 0-8) 62-51 on
Thursday in a game that saw se
nior post Brina Chaney break the
school's blocked shot record with
her 177 th career block. Oregon
State saw another player step up
big against Washington (10-7, 3-
5) as junior guard Shannon How
ell scored a career-high 40 points
in Saturday's 87-74 loss. Howell
shot 14-for-28 from the field, in
cluding 5-of-10 from behind the
three and was a perfect 7-for-7 at
the free throw line. Despite Sat
urday's loss, the Beavers remain
in the top half of the conference

standings.
Washington's sweep began
with a huge win over Oregon (10-
7, 2-5), 95-50. The score is the
highest seen in the Pac-10 this
season as freshman Breanne
Watson led her team with a ca
reer-high 22 points. The Huskies
maintained their momentum
heading into Saturday's game
against Oregon State behind se
nior Gioconda Mendiola who
also notched a career-high 22
points that included six three
pointers.
