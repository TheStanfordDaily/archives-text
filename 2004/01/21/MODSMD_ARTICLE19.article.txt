# Logar wins Freeman Memorial, team captures Pac-10 win
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This weekend, three members
of the No. 2 Stanford women's ten
nis team (1-0) headed to Pacific-10
Conference Indoor Champi
onships in Seattle. Six remaining
competitors took the road less
traveled, playing instead in the
Freeman Memorial Women's Ten
nis Championships in Las Vegas.
And that has made all the dif
ference.
For Stanford senior Lauren
Barnikow, competition at the Pac
-10 tournament came coupled with
disappointment. Seeded fourth in
the top tournament bracket, No.
20 Barnikow fell short in the first
round to Washington's unseeded
Claire Carter, 6-3,3-6,1-6.
Meanwhile it was no holds
barred for freshman Theresa
Logar, who claimed her first colle
giate title at Freeman Memorial.
After surviving the top-seed, No.
13 Tammy Encina of Tennessee,
in semifinal action, the unseeded
Cardinal breezed by North Car
olina's Aniela Mojzis in the finals,
6-2,6-1.
Logar, who recently broke into
the top-100 nationwide ranks at
No. 84, made good on her hopes to
avenge a junior-circuit loss in Las
Vegas last April. Her mission went
off without a hitch at first, as Logar
conceded a meager eight games in
her first three rounds of play.
Teammate Story Tweedie-
Yates, a junior, watched from the
sidelines as Logar stifled her op
ponents.
"The girls did not know what to
do with her pace," Tweedie-Yates
said. "She was just slinging balls
[and] she totally caught them off
guard."
Logar had another thing com
ing for her in the semifinals, where
third-seed Encina insisted upon a
three-set battle before finally giv
ing in, 6-1,4-6,0-6.
Tweedie-Yates bore her own
share of three-set burdens, deferring
to Stanford sophomore Alice
Barnes in the quarterfinals, 7-6,6-7,
6-2.
"Neither of us was playing ex
cellently," Tweedie-Yates said.
"[But] it's important to play
matches in those kinds of trying
situations and I'm really glad that
one of us pulled [the win] out be
cause that means Stanford pulled
it out."
Second-seeded Barnes lost to
runner-up Mojzis in the semifi
nals, 2-6,2-6.
Back in Seattle, Barnikow's
imposing familiarity with the

courts at Lloyd Nordstrom Tennis
Center quickly slipped away. De
spite two consecutive years of
reaching finals in the top competi
tive bracket, this year Barnikow
was left to fend for herself in con
solation rounds of play.
"This was my first tournament
since November," Barnikow said.
"I was a little rusty more men
tally than physically."
Barnikow continued, "I was in
control of the match [against
Carter] the first set and a half.
Then there was a game where I
lost a little confidence, I got a little
tentative and with that she took
advantage."
Following her early dismissal,
Barnikow defeated Kady Pooler
of Arizona State, 6-1, 6-1, and
Maja Mlakar of Arizona, 6-0, 6-2
in the back draw. She then sailed
over California's Catherine
Lynch, 6-1, 6-3, to clinch the con
solation singles title.
No. 73 Tweedie-Yates added
her insight into Barnikow's trying
weekend.
"We had a pretty uneven show
ing of who was at each tourna
ment," said Tweedie-Yates in ref
erence to the greater concentra
tion of high-ranked players at Pac
-10. "That's probably why Lauren
lost in the first round."
For instance, the Bears' No. 2
Raquel Kops-Jones and Oregon's
No. 8 Daria Panova dominated
play in Seattle. Panova's final vic
tory marked her second consecu
tive Pac-10 indoor title, and her
third Pac-10 title in the past two
years.
Injuries also plagued the Car
dinal in Pac-10 competition. Play
ing in the third bracket, junior
Kara Guzman dislocated her
shoulder while serving in the sec
ond set against top-seeded Laura
Gordon of UCLA.
After being blanked in the first
set, Guzman was forced to retire
despite showing signs of making a
comeback, 0-6,4-2. Guzman's un
fortunate showing at Pac-10 was
meant to mark her return to
match play, after injuring her
shoulder on the first day of prac
tice in September.
Sophomore Jessica Leek also
competed in the third flight at In
door, suffering a first-round loss
to Ebru Burduroglu of Arizona
State, 2-6,2-6.
Through all its ups and downs, the
Cardinal remains mentally tough.
"We never really peak at the
beginning of the year, and how
well we've done so far is pretty
good," Tweedie-Yates said. "I
think we're on the right track."
