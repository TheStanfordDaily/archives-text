# Graduate center building stalled
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
Construction of the Graduate
Student Community Center
which was supposed to begin in De
cember has been stalled until
the project receives approval from
Santa Clara County, delaying its
scheduled opening date of next
September.
"Work is started on under
ground utilities," said Project
Manger Susan Rozakis. "I antici
pate major building work will pro
ceed next week, once final ap
proval is received from the coun
ty."
Associate Dean of Graduate
Student Life Chris Griffith and
members of the Graduate Student

Council started planning the center
two years ago, but the idea has
been in the works for more than
five years. The building's planners
hope it will bring graduate students
together for social activities and
meetings, providing a much-need
ed central space for graduate stu
dents to gather.
Rozakis said that they had want
ed to start work prior to the winter
season, making the delay less than
optimal.
The building was scheduled to
open in September 2004 but now
the planned opening has been
pushed back to a later date next fall
quarter, according to Rozakis.
A building permit from the
county is needed to construct any
building. The Santa Clara County

Building Inspection Office checks
to see whether construction plans
meet building, mechanical, plumb
ing and electrical codes and, if they
do not, will tell the applicant what
the deficiencies are, according to
the Santa Clara County Web site. A
permit is then issued when the plan
is approved and passes clearance
from the Santa Clara County Plan
ning Office.
The 12,000 square-foot building
will be two stories high and is being
built next to Studio One of Escon
dido Village on the Mirrielees
parking lot. It will have a large
meeting room, conference rooms, a
snack bar and cafe, a workstation
and administrative office space.
The center is being funded by
alumnus John Arrillaga.

These cars in the Mirrielees parking lot will be displaced once construction commences on the new Graduate Student
Community Center. Construction was temporarily delayed until a permit can be obtained.
