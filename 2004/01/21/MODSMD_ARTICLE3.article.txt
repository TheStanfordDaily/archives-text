# 'Loveline' hosts to offer sex solutions tonight
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DESK EDITOR 
Students will have the opportunity to get all of their questions
about love, sex and relationships answered tonight when Dr. Drew
Pinsky and Adam Carolla bring their long-running show, "Love
line," to Memorial Auditorium.
The event, sponsored by the ASSU Speakers Bureau, will take
the same format as Pinsky and Carolla's national radio show and for
mer MTV talk show. The audience will ask questions and the hosts
will respond with a mixture of humor and practical advice.
"The Speakers Bureau will have people roaming the auditorium
with handheld mikes which audience members can use to ask ques
tions," said senior Vinita Kailasanath, director of the Speakers Bu
reau.
"Loveline" is one of five or six major events put on each year by
the Speakers Bureau. After talks by two serious, more politically ori
ented speakers, the organization decided to host an event that will be
lighter in tone.
" 'Loveline' has a broad appeal to college students, and, luckily,
Mem Aud was available on a day that fit their schedule," Kailasanath
said.
Roughly 1,650 tickets are being distributed for the event. Students
who did not get tickets yesterday will have their last chance today in
White Plaza and outside of the Packard Electrical Engineering build
ing from 11:30 a.m. to 1:15 p.m. Tickets will be free, with up to two
tickets per SUID and up to two SUIDs per person.
Future speakers coming to campus include Candace Bushnell, the
author of the book upon which "Sex and the City" is based, and po
tentially Boutros Boutros Ghali.
