# Study shows memories can be repressed

Researchers from Stanford and the University
of Oregon have shown that the human brain is ca
pable of voluntarily repressing unwanted memo
ries, a concept that was introduced by Sigmund
Freud more than 100 years ago.
The results were published this month in a
paper titled "Neural Systems Underlying the Sup
pression of Unwanted Memories," co-authored by
Psychology Prof. John Gabrieli, in the journal Sci
ence. Gabrieli studies the brain basis of how
human memory is made and forgotten. He re
searched repression as one example of voluntary,
willful forgetting.
"Our research supported that view that the
brain mechanisms we understand quite a bit about
. . . can support an example of repression,"
Gabrieli said.
The experiment conducted at Stanford last
year not only demonstrated the human capabil
ity to repeatedly block unwanted thoughts until

they can no longer remember them, but also speci
fied which brain regions supported this practice.
The idea of repressed memories is a topic that
has been debated among laymen and scientists
alike for over a century. The first controlled exper
imental evidence that memory repression does
exist was published three years ago in Nature by
the recent paper's lead author Michael Anderson,
an associate professor of psychology at the Univer
sity of Oregon. Anderson and Gabrieli have now
built on that research by showing the brain's ca
pacity to repress memory and how it is implement
ed.
"Repression has been a vague and controversial
construct for over a century," Anderson told The
Stanford Report. "The study provides a clear
model for how this occurs by grounding it firmly in
an essential human ability the ability to control
behavior . . . This idea is that the neurobiological
mechanism that we have evolved to control overt
might be recruited to control internal ac-
