# Study shows memories can be repressed

### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
Researchers from Stanford and the University
of Oregon have shown that the human brain is ca
pable of voluntarily repressing unwanted memo
ries, a concept that was introduced by Sigmund
Freud more than 100 years ago.
The results were published this month in a
paper titled "Neural Systems Underlying the Sup
pression of Unwanted Memories," co-authored by
Psychology Prof. John Gabrieli, in the journal Sci
ence. Gabrieli studies the brain basis of how
human memory is made and forgotten. He re
searched repression as one example of voluntary,
willful forgetting.
"Our research supported that view that the
brain mechanisms we understand quite a bit about
. . . can support an example of repression,"
Gabrieli said.
The experiment conducted at Stanford last
year not only demonstrated the human capabil
ity to repeatedly block unwanted thoughts until

they can no longer remember them, but also speci
fied which brain regions supported this practice.
The idea of repressed memories is a topic that
has been debated among laymen and scientists
alike for over a century. The first controlled exper
imental evidence that memory repression does
exist was published three years ago in Nature by
the recent paper's lead author Michael Anderson,
an associate professor of psychology at the Univer
sity of Oregon. Anderson and Gabrieli have now
built on that research by showing the brain's ca
pacity to repress memory and how it is implement
ed.
"Repression has been a vague and controversial
construct for over a century," Anderson told The
Stanford Report. "The study provides a clear
model for how this occurs by grounding it firmly in
an essential human ability the ability to control
behavior . . . This idea is that the neurobiological
mechanism that we have evolved to control overt
might be recruited to control internal ac-
tions such as memory retrieval as
well."
In the experiment, 24 people
were given 36 pairs of nouns and
were tested on their memory of
them until they answered about
three-fourths correctly.
They were then tested while
using functional magnetic reso
nance imaging to scan their brains.
Researchers divided the word
pairs into three sets. For the first
set, they asked subjects to look at
the first word of the pair and recall
and think of the second word, and
for the second set, they asked them
not to recall or think of the second
word. Then, subjects were retested
on all of the word pairs and re
searchers discovered that subjects
remembered fewer of the word
pairs in the set they had actively
tried not to think about than in the
third, baseline, set of pairs that
they had not seen during the 30-

minute brain scanning portion of
the experiment.
"People's memory gets worse
the more they try to avoid thinking
about it," Anderson said to The
Stanford Report. "If you consis
tently expose people to a reminder
of a memory that they don't want
to think about, and they try not to
think about it, they actually don't
remember it as well as memories
where they were not presented
with any reminders at all."
The researchers identified the
systems in the brain that play a role
in actively suppressing memory
using the fMRI scans. Specifically,
they showed a connection between
increased left and right frontal cor
tex activation, the part of the brain
used to repress memory, and the
reduced activation of the hip
pocampus, the part of the brain
used to remember experiences.
Also, they showed that subjects'
increased activation of the frontal
cortex led to an improved ability to
suppress unwanted memory.
Memory repression has recently
become a highly controversial

issue in relation to childhood sexu
al abuse cases because of the lack
of experimental or scientific evi
dence that they do exist and are not
just false memories. Gabrieli said
that their research has limited im
plications for the subject, though,
because the experiment tested
healthy volunteers using neutral
words in a very different situation
from sexual assault occurrences.
The research opens the field
for more exploration of memory
repression, according to Gabrieli.
For example, researchers can
now test whether these findings
also apply to emotionally salient
experience by using more emo
tionally powerful stimuli in
healthy people.
Another interesting extension
would be to research the capacity
of memory suppression in people
who want to repress memories and
cannot for example, people who
are depressed and dwell too much
on negative experiences or post
traumatic stress disorder patients
who remember traumatic experi
ences all too well.
