# ASSU may lose two sophomore senators
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Owing to a strange coincidence, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate is on the verge of losing two senators.
Shyam Ravindran and Jason Sinocruz, both sopho
mores, have expressed concerns that they will be un
able to fulfill their senatorial responsibilities this
quarter. Now, The Senate faces the difficult task of
expelling the senators, granting them leaves of ab
sence or waiting for their resignation.
After a lengthy discussion at last night's meeting,
The Senate was unable to reach a conclusion. Chair
Josh Shipp, a junior, made it clear that the issue must
be resolved by next week.
The cases of Ravindran and Sinocruz are quite dif
ferent, making their temporal proximity all the more
unusual.
Ravindran decided over winter break to stop out
for the quarter "to pursue research," according to
Shipp; he is not formally a Stanford student at the mo
ment.
Sinocruz is attending school this quarter, but for
various undisclosed reasons cannot fulfill his duties as

a senator and "is considering resigning," Shipp said.
According to several sources, both senators would
prefer a leave of absence to dismissal or resignation.
However, neither The Senate bylaws nor the senators
themselves seem clear on what, exactly, a leave of ab
sence suggests. For instance, can an absent member
still vote? What duties are available for an absent sen
ator to fulfill?
The current Senate term will expire early in spring
quarter, meaning that if either Ravindran or Sinocruz
were to return next quarter after a leave of absence,
only two or three meetings would remain in their
term.
Senate advisers Nanci Howe and Morris Graves
tried to frame the discussion in general terms, not
specifics. In deciding the issue, Graves implored the
senators to ask themselves, "What is going to be your
general outlook? What are your goals as the Senate as
a whole?"'
