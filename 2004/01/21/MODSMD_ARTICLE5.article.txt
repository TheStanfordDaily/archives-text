# ASSU may lose two sophomore senators
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Owing to a strange coincidence, the ASSU Under
graduate Senate is on the verge of losing two senators.
Shyam Ravindran and Jason Sinocruz, both sopho
mores, have expressed concerns that they will be un
able to fulfill their senatorial responsibilities this
quarter. Now, The Senate faces the difficult task of
expelling the senators, granting them leaves of ab
sence or waiting for their resignation.
After a lengthy discussion at last night's meeting,
The Senate was unable to reach a conclusion. Chair
Josh Shipp, a junior, made it clear that the issue must
be resolved by next week.
The cases of Ravindran and Sinocruz are quite dif
ferent, making their temporal proximity all the more
unusual.
Ravindran decided over winter break to stop out
for the quarter "to pursue research," according to
Shipp; he is not formally a Stanford student at the mo
ment.
Sinocruz is attending school this quarter, but for
various undisclosed reasons cannot fulfill his duties as

a senator and "is considering resigning," Shipp said.
According to several sources, both senators would
prefer a leave of absence to dismissal or resignation.
However, neither The Senate bylaws nor the senators
themselves seem clear on what, exactly, a leave of ab
sence suggests. For instance, can an absent member
still vote? What duties are available for an absent sen
ator to fulfill?
The current Senate term will expire early in spring
quarter, meaning that if either Ravindran or Sinocruz
were to return next quarter after a leave of absence,
only two or three meetings would remain in their
term.
Senate advisers Nanci Howe and Morris Graves
tried to frame the discussion in general terms, not
specifics. In deciding the issue, Graves implored the
senators to ask themselves, "What is going to be your
general outlook? What are your goals as the Senate as
a whole?"'
After relating a story about a student organization
that had to rewrite its bylaws after disobeying Uni
versity guidelines for two years and allowing non-stu-
dents to serve on its board, Graves
added: "In many ways, The Senate is
a role model for our student organi
zations, in terms of our expectations.
If you're prepared to allow a senator
to perform even though he's not a
currently enrolled student, what
kind of signal are you sending to
other student organizations that are
held to a different standard?"
Both Ravindran and Sinocruz
were supposed to appear at last
night's meeting to address the other
senators. According to Shipp,
Sinocruz called him and canceled a

few hours before the meeting, and
Ravindran simply failed to show up.
"I think I've made up my mind
now," said junior Alex Moore,
speaking about Ravindran. "I'm
going to vote to expel, to be hon
est. I think he should be encour
aged to stay, as much as possible,
but some people in here chose not
to sign up for abroad programs,
etc."
However, the issue may not come
to an expulsion vote. The students
may be granted leaves of absence or
they may resign. A decision must be
made by next week, though; a Senate
law requires that an expulsion bill
must be brought against any senator
that misses three meetings. An ab
sence next week will be both sena

tors' third.
Most statements at last night's
meeting were critical of Ravindran.
"You always have a choice," said
ASSU vice president Joey Natoli.
"He knew what he was doing. When
he ran for an elected office, he took
upon himself a responsibility."
Sinocruz, whose possible resigna
tion was announced only last night,
received less fire but little leniency.
" I think leave of absence is an ex
traordinarily special case and nei
ther of these cases warrant that,"
said sophomore Chris Lin. "It's not
like they got stranded in some high
land. These were conscious efforts
by these senators whether to do
extra things, whether to leave cam
pus."
