### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
It all started with a research paper on Haiti during her sophomore year of
high school. Since then, the island nation has led freshman Marie-Jo Mont-
Reynaud to a new language, new friends, a budding photography career and
the community service project of a lifetime. The recent winner of the
Sakapfet online photography contest, Mont-Reynaud uses her art to illus
trate Haiti's poverty and desperation as well as its humanity and hope.
Mont-Reynaud donated her $l,OOO contest prize to the funding of a school
and a veterinary project in the region where the photographs were taken. But
this is not the first time Mont-Reynaud has raised money for the people who
have touched her life. Last year, she organized a photo exhibit at her high
school, raising $2,000 for children's school fees and other necessities.
Hard to believe that just over three years ago, this charity mogul knew
very little about the country that has become her second home. When her
sophomore history teacher assigned a paper on colonization, Mont-Rey
naud chose Haiti because she assumed all the documents she needed would
be in French, a language she was already familiar with. Quickly she realized
that Creole would probably come more in handy if she wanted to talk to the
people themselves. She became the youngest person to audit a Creole
course, offered through the Stanford linguistics department. Since then, she
has gained fluency in the language through immersion.
"I got really excited about the historical research, but what I was really in
terested in was the second part of the project, looking at Haiti today," Mont-
Reynaud says. "That's when I really started learning about the problems
there, and I had the idea to go to the country that I had been reading so much
about."
Starting out as a volunteer in an orphanage in Port-au-Prince, she gradu
ally moved into the rural areas during the following summers and now
spends her time there living with a family in the mountains. This communi
ty lacks electricity and creature comforts, although Mont-Reynaud says the
air is fresh and the streets safe.
"I've actually been most interested in the political attitudes of rural in
habitants, and how it relates to other aspects of their lives, including church,
agriculture, family, etc.," she says. During the four months she's spent in
Haiti since the country sparked her interest, she's become close to the peo
ple she lived with, and hopes to return to these friendships this upcoming
summer.
Like any tourist on vacation, Mont-Reynaud snapped pictures wherever
she went. It was only when she reviewed the pictures at home that she saw
potential for artistic expression. The next year, she returned to Haiti, digital
camera in hand, prepared to document not only her own experience, but also
that of the people she has come to know intimately.
"It's funny because people who have actually studied photography tend
to be impressed by the technical aspects of my photos that I know nothing
about," says Mont-Reynaud, who has never taken a formal photography
class. "Some say I must have a natural eye, and I suppose that may be, but I
just think I got lucky."
"There are so many things to photograph in Haiti, so many scenes just
waiting to be shot," she adds. "It's hard not to get a good picture."
Photography has become Mont-Reynaud's voice when it comes to ex
posing the nation's poor living conditions and rallying support for Haitian
communities. It allows her to raise money to be directly given to organiza
tions she knows and cares for, while calling attention to some of the deeper
social and financial problems that plague people's everyday lives.
"I don't think of photography as an end so much as a means," she says. "I

really use it because it is a particularly effective way to deliver a message."
During her trips to Haiti, Mont-Reynaud follows her host family through
everything they do, to the fields, to the market, to the river for laundry.
Poignant pictures have come from everyday activities shelling beans,
pounding coffee, attending church, playing with the children.
"Sometimes you just sit around when the work is done in the evenings
and the sun has gone down and you just sit around the table by candlelight
and talk," she says, describing everyone she has met as incredibly social. She
describes her household, filled with the sounds of babies crying, people shar
ing chores, animals wandering through every room of the house.
"Everything feels very alive," she says. "I found when I got back to the
U.S. how completely isolated and impersonal everything is. It's so different
in Haiti. You would never pass anyone without looking at them and saying
hi how are you. Life has a very different feel to it."
One photograph of the two young children she lived with, Destin and
Jezilen, really hit home for Mont-Reynaud, who saw the picture has both
personally and politically meaningful.
"I know that [the children] face an unforgiving landscape of insurmount
able hills and future obstacles," she says. "In this photo, Destin and Jezilen
are not just standing on the edge of the mountain; they are living on the edge.
It is that condition that I am compelled to change."
Mont-Reynaud remembers a time when the children's father asked her
to help his family attain visas to the United States. Taken aback by this man
who had seemingly sacrificed his pride to beg her for impossible assistance,

she mentioned the incident to an older aid worker who told her, "Sometimes
in Haiti, your pride is the only thing you have to eat."
These words resonated with the young photographer who focused her
sights on Haiti's poverty and the singular goal to bring relief those who had
suffered for far too long.
"I look at my photo and see two Haitian children facing the bleakness of
their future, lit only by the last shimmer of the fading sun," she wrote in an
essay on the photograph. "I see Haiti's harshness and feel despair, but I also
see its beauty and have hope that the sun will rise above the mountains
again." *
It is this hope that Mont-Reynaud sees reflected in the faces of the peo
ple she photographs. She prefers taking pictures of people because she wants
others to see and feel the same need, culture and familiarity that she does
when she is in Haiti.
"For me, poverty now has a face, illness now has a name," she says. "They
are not empty words for me anymore. They call up memories of specific
faces, children, moments. And if someone else could feel that connection to
the people of Haiti through my photos, then I feel like my photography
would convey what I want it to."
Mont-Reynaud plans to return to Haiti this summer, hopefully on a un
dergraduate research grant in order to continue photo and film documen
tary. A potential political science or economics major, she doesn't have any
particular careers in mind, and says simply, "I'm just going to see where Haiti
takes me."

able hills and future obstacles," she says. "In this photo, Destin and Jezilen
are not just standing on the edge of the mountain; they are living on the edge.
It is that condition that I am compelled to change."
Mont-Reynaud remembers a time when the children's father asked her
to help his family attain visas to the United States. Taken aback by this man
who had seemingly sacrificed his pride to beg her for impossible assistance,

she mentioned the incident to an older aid worker who told her, "Sometimes
in Haiti, your pride is the only thing you have to eat."
These words resonated with the young photographer who focused her
sights on Haiti's poverty and the singular goal to bring relief those who had
suffered for far too long.
"I look at my photo and see two Haitian children facing the bleakness of
their future, lit only by the last shimmer of the fading sun," she wrote in an
essay on the photograph. "I see Haiti's harshness and feel despair, but I also
see its beauty and have hope that the sun will rise above the mountains
again." *
It is this hope that Mont-Reynaud sees reflected in the faces of the peo
ple she photographs. She prefers taking pictures of people because she wants
others to see and feel the same need, culture and familiarity that she does
when she is in Haiti.
"For me, poverty now has a face, illness now has a name," she says. "They
are not empty words for me anymore. They call up memories of specific
faces, children, moments. And if someone else could feel that connection to
the people of Haiti through my photos, then I feel like my photography
would convey what I want it to."
Mont-Reynaud plans to return to Haiti this summer, hopefully on a un
dergraduate research grant in order to continue photo and film documen
tary. A potential political science or economics major, she doesn't have any
particular careers in mind, and says simply, "I'm just going to see where Haiti
takes me."

Destin and Jezilen, two children from the Haitian mountain village of Latounelle, stand gazing into the distance. Freshman Marie-Jo Mont-Rey
naud stayed with the children's family during her three-month visit to Haiti, and this picture won her a first place award and $1,000.
It all started with a research paper on Haiti during her sophomore year of
high school. Since then, the island nation has led freshman Marie-Jo Mont-
Reynaud to a new language, new friends, a budding photography career and
the community service project of a lifetime. The recent winner of the
Sakapfet online photography contest, Mont-Reynaud uses her art to illus
trate Haiti's poverty and desperation as well as its humanity and hope.
Mont-Reynaud donated her $l,OOO contest prize to the funding of a school
and a veterinary project in the region where the photographs were taken. But
this is not the first time Mont-Reynaud has raised money for the people who
have touched her life. Last year, she organized a photo exhibit at her high
school, raising $2,000 for children's school fees and other necessities.
Hard to believe that just over three years ago, this charity mogul knew
very little about the country that has become her second home. When her
sophomore history teacher assigned a paper on colonization, Mont-Rey
naud chose Haiti because she assumed all the documents she needed would
be in French, a language she was already familiar with. Quickly she realized
that Creole would probably come more in handy if she wanted to talk to the
people themselves. She became the youngest person to audit a Creole
course, offered through the Stanford linguistics department. Since then, she
has gained fluency in the language through immersion.
"I got really excited about the historical research, but what I was really in
terested in was the second part of the project, looking at Haiti today," Mont-
Reynaud says. "That's when I really started learning about the problems
there, and I had the idea to go to the country that I had been reading so much
about."
Starting out as a volunteer in an orphanage in Port-au-Prince, she gradu
ally moved into the rural areas during the following summers and now
spends her time there living with a family in the mountains. This communi
ty lacks electricity and creature comforts, although Mont-Reynaud says the
air is fresh and the streets safe.
"I've actually been most interested in the political attitudes of rural in
habitants, and how it relates to other aspects of their lives, including church,
agriculture, family, etc.," she says. During the four months she's spent in
Haiti since the country sparked her interest, she's become close to the peo
ple she lived with, and hopes to return to these friendships this upcoming
summer.
Like any tourist on vacation, Mont-Reynaud snapped pictures wherever
she went. It was only when she reviewed the pictures at home that she saw
potential for artistic expression. The next year, she returned to Haiti, digital
camera in hand, prepared to document not only her own experience, but also
that of the people she has come to know intimately.
"It's funny because people who have actually studied photography tend
to be impressed by the technical aspects of my photos that I know nothing
about," says Mont-Reynaud, who has never taken a formal photography
class. "Some say I must have a natural eye, and I suppose that may be, but I
just think I got lucky."
"There are so many things to photograph in Haiti, so many scenes just
waiting to be shot," she adds. "It's hard not to get a good picture."
Photography has become Mont-Reynaud's voice when it comes to ex
posing the nation's poor living conditions and rallying support for Haitian
communities. It allows her to raise money to be directly given to organiza
tions she knows and cares for, while calling attention to some of the deeper
social and financial problems that plague people's everyday lives.
"I don't think of photography as an end so much as a means," she says. "I

really use it because it is a particularly effective way to deliver a message."
During her trips to Haiti, Mont-Reynaud follows her host family through
everything they do, to the fields, to the market, to the river for laundry.
Poignant pictures have come from everyday activities shelling beans,
pounding coffee, attending church, playing with the children.
"Sometimes you just sit around when the work is done in the evenings
and the sun has gone down and you just sit around the table by candlelight
and talk," she says, describing everyone she has met as incredibly social. She
describes her household, filled with the sounds of babies crying, people shar
ing chores, animals wandering through every room of the house.
"Everything feels very alive," she says. "I found when I got back to the
U.S. how completely isolated and impersonal everything is. It's so different
in Haiti. You would never pass anyone without looking at them and saying
hi how are you. Life has a very different feel to it."
One photograph of the two young children she lived with, Destin and
Jezilen, really hit home for Mont-Reynaud, who saw the picture has both
personally and politically meaningful.
"I know that [the children] face an unforgiving landscape of insurmount
able hills and future obstacles," she says. "In this photo, Destin and Jezilen
are not just standing on the edge of the mountain; they are living on the edge.
