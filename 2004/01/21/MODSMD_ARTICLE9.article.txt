# GREat Expectations: Filling in the Bubble
## 
### NICOLE WRIGHT DESK EDITOR 
I've held this column back for a while now.
Until the day I checked my mail and found the
little white slip I was looking for, it remained
strictly under wraps. After all, who knows what
lurks in the minds and hearts of the powers
that-be at the GRE? I sure wasn't rearing to
find out. Those odious whispers about the
death knell of gonna-make-you-sweat Big
Tests surely get back to them, and I didn't want
to end up with a "mysteriously" low score,
which I surmised would be the Graduate
Record Exam consiglieri's preferred method
of sending me off to sleep with the fishes. So
until my scores were safe in my hot little hands,
I kept this in the cooler.
What made me write this? Well, while sit
ting in Stern Dining recently, minding my own
business and scanning The Times, I noticed
that the only other students in the place were a
gaggle of red-blooded freshmen boys. With
their radiant, well-scrubbed faces and com
pact, sturdy limbs, they could have been the
offspring of Kyle Boiler and a particularly fer
tile glowworm. As a group, they looked like
one of those shiny Stanford brochure photos
brought to life.
Then one of them had to spoil the picture
perfection of it all and say, "You know, I think
[girls of a certain 'race'] are really hot, but they
only want to date guys of their own race."
One of his friends said, "Yeah, and the guys
all talk like this," and he did a pitiful "imita
tion" of "their" speech. The whole table erupt
ed in raucous laughter.
I flashed them my patented BBC-period
drama "Wither, knave!" Look, but to no avail.
Several of the guys smiled back at me, not im
pudently, but with genial grins. Then they con
tinued to make racist remarks not worth the
paper this is printed on. I looked at them again.
Again, they smiled back at me and departed.
My second impetus: While awaiting the
GRE all summer, I hung out after workwith a
guy from Alabama who enjoyed recounting his
Southern misadventures. He fondly remem
bered going to Dollyland, except for one gripe:
"Little kids would walk around, licking the
Dollypops, which showed her breasts and all. It
was just disgusting," he said. How is this dis

gusting? It's just anatomy.
After each incident, I regretted that I let
these things pass without calling the guys on
their insensitivity. What's more, after taking
the GRE, I noticed that I kept mixing up the
acronym with the GER. If we have "world cul
tures" and "gender studies" GER require
ments, why not a GRE on the same subjects?
Those guys I saw could have used some sensi
tivity training. Until some broken-nosed thug
slithers behind me and whispers, "Get the f***
down and give me an antonym for
'sesquipedalian,'" such knowledge may be
more relevant in terms of getting along in this
trigger-happy world.
Why not test your mettle on this quizlet,
modeled after the real GRE(tm)? Don't be
ig'nant, get edjimacated. I'll start you off easy.
.. Enjoy!
