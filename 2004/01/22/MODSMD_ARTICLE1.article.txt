# NorCal/SoCal rivalry heats up
## No. 2 Card tries to stay undefeated 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 2 Stanford will put its undefeated
record on the line tonight against UCLA,
the Pacific-10 Conference's second-ranked
team.
The Bruins (9-4,5-1 Pac-10) missed the
NCAA Tournament last year, but under
first-year head coach Ben Howland have
developed as a more disciplined, defen
sively minded squad.
"It's a different-look UCLA team,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Ben's kind of gone back to the basics.
They're very good in half-court defense."
Under longtime head coach Steve
Lavin, who was fired after last year's 10-19
season, the Bruins liked to play an uptem
po style. Under Howland, though, the de
fense — which allowed 78.6 points per
game last year — is clamping down on op
ponents, giving up 66.8 points per game this
season.
"It's just developing a mentality to try to
defend and rebound first, and that's where
you're going to win games," Howland said.
