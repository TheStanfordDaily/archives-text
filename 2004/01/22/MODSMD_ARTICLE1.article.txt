# NorCal/SoCal rivalry heats up
## No. 2 Card tries to stay undefeated 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
No. 2 Stanford will put its undefeated
record on the line tonight against UCLA,
the Pacific-10 Conference's second-ranked
team.
The Bruins (9-4,5-1 Pac-10) missed the
NCAA Tournament last year, but under
first-year head coach Ben Howland have
developed as a more disciplined, defen
sively minded squad.
"It's a different-look UCLA team,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Ben's kind of gone back to the basics.
They're very good in half-court defense."
Under longtime head coach Steve
Lavin, who was fired after last year's 10-19
season, the Bruins liked to play an uptem
po style. Under Howland, though, the de
fense — which allowed 78.6 points per
game last year — is clamping down on op
ponents, giving up 66.8 points per game this
season.
"It's just developing a mentality to try to
defend and rebound first, and that's where
you're going to win games," Howland said.
"You look at Stanford, our oppo
nent next, or Arizona, our opponent
last Saturday, and the emphasis on
rebounding has served them well
the last six, seven years in this con
ference."
The Bruins may be playing at a
more controlled pace, but their ros
ter is still populated with rangy, ath
letic players capable of creating
their own shots and scoring in tran
sition.
Stanford (14-0, 5-0) will have to
deal with UCLA's trademark quick
ness and athleticism — as well as a
size disadvantage, as all five of the
Bruins' starters are taller than their
Cardinal counterparts.
"Speed and quickness is always a
huge factor, [and] size can be a fac
tor if you utilize it properly," Mont
gomery said. "UCLA's always been
long ... you think you have a shot
on offense and you don't."
UCLA is led by Dijon Thompson,
a 6-foot-7 junior guard who averages
14.6 points and 5.5 rebounds per
game, and T.J. Cummings, a 6-foot-9
senior collecting 13.3 points and 6.6
rebounds per game as a post player.
While Thompson and Cummings
were regular contributors last year,
UCLA's offense has been bolstered
this year by the addition of lanky
freshman forward Trevor Ariza,
who averages 13.7 points and a
team-high 6.8 rebounds per game.
"I knew he'd be a very good ath
lete," Howland said. "He comes from
a very good high school program...
he's used to winning and is a kid that
understands about winning."
By and large, the Bruins have
been very competitive. They have
only lost one game by more than
four points — but that game was a
97-72 drubbing at the hands of No.
14 Arizona last weekend.
The Bruins shot just 40 percent,
while allowing Arizona to get open
for 23 three-pointers, of which the
Wildcats made 14.
"[The Wildcats] were very
good," Howland said. "We were re
ally, really poor. We didn't block
out well, we didn't defend well, we
got anxious offensively."
Against Stanford, the Bruins will
have athleticism on their side, but
will also be facing the Pac-10's most
fundamentally sound program. If
they crumble and revert to last
year's ways like they did against
Arizona, it could be a long after
noon for the UCLA faithful. How
land, though, has confidence that his
team can stay poised.
"I think shot selection is the most
important thing on offense," he
said. "I think our team, our players
have done a good job, with the ex
ception of the last game."
Against an athletic team like
UCLA, Stanford's advantage lies
not in how high its players can jump
or how fast they can run, but rather
in how well they execute the team's
game plan.

"We play closer to our abilities
than some," Montgomery said. "In
the highest-level games, we've put
forth the greatest effort. I don't
know how much harder we could
play."
On Saturday, Stanford will host
Southern California (8-7,3-3) which
couldn't have played much better
than it did last Thursday, when it
knocked off Arizona, 99-90.
In that game, senior Desmon
Farmer exploded for 40 points,
shooting 7-of-ll from long range, as
the Trojans won at home. It was a
surprising win, but it's hard to beat
any Pac-10 team that insists on scor
ing that many points — something
USC found out again two days later,
when it fell, 100-85, to Arizona
State, despite 26 more points from
Farmer.
"If the ball starts going down for
some of the guys in this league,
they're very tough to beat," Mont
gomery said. "You get a guy like
Desmon Farmer that gets you 40,
you've got a chance to win."
Farmer, the reigning Pac-10
Player of the Week, leads the Tro
jans in scoring at 19.7 points per
game and is also an excellent de
fender. He takes the majority of his
shots from outside, but the Trojans
have several solid post players.
Jeff McMillan is shooting 65.5
percent from the floor, by far the
best mark in the Pac-10. McMillan
averages 12.7 points and a team
high 8.4 rebounds per game. Center
Rory O'Neil isn't much of an inside
player, but he has a nice outside shot
and is chipping in nine points per
game. Gregg Guenther Jr., a foot
ball tight end, is a bruiser capable of
posting a double-double off the
bench.
In the backcourt, Errick Craven
averages 10.9 points and a team
high 3.3 assists. He starts alongside
Rodrick Stewart (6.4 points), while
Derrick Craven (5.9 points) and Lo
drick Stewart (9.6 points) see major
playing time off the bench. All four
of USC's twins are plus defenders.
USC coach Henry Bibby may try
to pressure the Cardinal and push
the tempo at times, but he knows
such moves might backfire.
"[Stanford is] deceptively quick
[and] they do score in transition," he
said. "They have a lot of intangibles
that help them — free-throw shoot
ing down the stretch, outside shoot
ing if you leave them open."
Stanford is shooting 74 percent
from the line and 36 percent from
downtown this year. The Cardinal's
49 percent field-goal accuracy poses
the biggest challenge to a team with
a free-wheeling offense like USC,
though. Stanford makes the most of
its possessions, while USC — which
shoots 45 percent from the floor and
allows its opponents to shoot 47 per
cent — relies on generating a lot of
possessions by forcing turnovers
and playing up-tempo.
Tonight's game begins at 5:30
p.m. and will be televised on Fox
Sports Net, while Saturday's contest
gets underway at 7 p.m. and will be
broadcast on KRON 4.

nent next, or Arizona, our opponent
last Saturday, and the emphasis on
rebounding has served them well
the last six, seven years in this con
ference."
The Bruins may be playing at a
more controlled pace, but their ros
ter is still populated with rangy, ath
letic players capable of creating
their own shots and scoring in tran
sition.
Stanford (14-0, 5-0) will have to
deal with UCLA's trademark quick
ness and athleticism — as well as a
size disadvantage, as all five of the
Bruins' starters are taller than their
Cardinal counterparts.
"Speed and quickness is always a
huge factor, [and] size can be a fac
tor if you utilize it properly," Mont
gomery said. "UCLA's always been
long ... you think you have a shot
on offense and you don't."
UCLA is led by Dijon Thompson,
a 6-foot-7 junior guard who averages
14.6 points and 5.5 rebounds per
game, and T.J. Cummings, a 6-foot-9
senior collecting 13.3 points and 6.6
rebounds per game as a post player.
While Thompson and Cummings
were regular contributors last year,
UCLA's offense has been bolstered
this year by the addition of lanky
freshman forward Trevor Ariza,
who averages 13.7 points and a
team-high 6.8 rebounds per game.
"I knew he'd be a very good ath
lete," Howland said. "He comes from
a very good high school program...
he's used to winning and is a kid that
understands about winning."
By and large, the Bruins have
been very competitive. They have
only lost one game by more than
four points — but that game was a
97-72 drubbing at the hands of No.
14 Arizona last weekend.
The Bruins shot just 40 percent,
while allowing Arizona to get open
for 23 three-pointers, of which the
Wildcats made 14.
"[The Wildcats] were very
good," Howland said. "We were re
ally, really poor. We didn't block
out well, we didn't defend well, we
got anxious offensively."
Against Stanford, the Bruins will
have athleticism on their side, but
will also be facing the Pac-10's most
fundamentally sound program. If
they crumble and revert to last
year's ways like they did against
Arizona, it could be a long after
noon for the UCLA faithful. How
land, though, has confidence that his
team can stay poised.
"I think shot selection is the most
important thing on offense," he
said. "I think our team, our players
have done a good job, with the ex
ception of the last game."
Against an athletic team like
UCLA, Stanford's advantage lies
not in how high its players can jump
or how fast they can run, but rather
in how well they execute the team's
game plan.

"We play closer to our abilities
than some," Montgomery said. "In
the highest-level games, we've put
forth the greatest effort. I don't
know how much harder we could
play."
On Saturday, Stanford will host
Southern California (8-7,3-3) which
couldn't have played much better
than it did last Thursday, when it
knocked off Arizona, 99-90.
In that game, senior Desmon
Farmer exploded for 40 points,
shooting 7-of-ll from long range, as
the Trojans won at home. It was a
surprising win, but it's hard to beat
any Pac-10 team that insists on scor
ing that many points — something
USC found out again two days later,
when it fell, 100-85, to Arizona
State, despite 26 more points from
Farmer.
"If the ball starts going down for
some of the guys in this league,
they're very tough to beat," Mont
gomery said. "You get a guy like
Desmon Farmer that gets you 40,
you've got a chance to win."
Farmer, the reigning Pac-10
Player of the Week, leads the Tro
jans in scoring at 19.7 points per
game and is also an excellent de
fender. He takes the majority of his
shots from outside, but the Trojans
have several solid post players.
Jeff McMillan is shooting 65.5
percent from the floor, by far the
best mark in the Pac-10. McMillan
averages 12.7 points and a team
high 8.4 rebounds per game. Center
Rory O'Neil isn't much of an inside
player, but he has a nice outside shot
and is chipping in nine points per
game. Gregg Guenther Jr., a foot
ball tight end, is a bruiser capable of
posting a double-double off the
bench.
In the backcourt, Errick Craven
averages 10.9 points and a team
high 3.3 assists. He starts alongside
Rodrick Stewart (6.4 points), while
Derrick Craven (5.9 points) and Lo
drick Stewart (9.6 points) see major
playing time off the bench. All four
of USC's twins are plus defenders.
USC coach Henry Bibby may try
to pressure the Cardinal and push
the tempo at times, but he knows
such moves might backfire.
"[Stanford is] deceptively quick
[and] they do score in transition," he
said. "They have a lot of intangibles
that help them — free-throw shoot
ing down the stretch, outside shoot
ing if you leave them open."
Stanford is shooting 74 percent
from the line and 36 percent from
downtown this year. The Cardinal's
49 percent field-goal accuracy poses
the biggest challenge to a team with
a free-wheeling offense like USC,
though. Stanford makes the most of
its possessions, while USC — which
shoots 45 percent from the floor and
allows its opponents to shoot 47 per
cent — relies on generating a lot of
possessions by forcing turnovers
and playing up-tempo.
Tonight's game begins at 5:30
p.m. and will be televised on Fox
Sports Net, while Saturday's contest
gets underway at 7 p.m. and will be

The No. 2 Cardinal hopes to continue its 14-0 start.
No. 2 Stanford will put its undefeated
record on the line tonight against UCLA,
the Pacific-10 Conference's second-ranked
team.
The Bruins (9-4,5-1 Pac-10) missed the
NCAA Tournament last year, but under
first-year head coach Ben Howland have
developed as a more disciplined, defen
sively minded squad.
"It's a different-look UCLA team,"
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery
said. "Ben's kind of gone back to the basics.
They're very good in half-court defense."
Under longtime head coach Steve
Lavin, who was fired after last year's 10-19
season, the Bruins liked to play an uptem
po style. Under Howland, though, the de
fense — which allowed 78.6 points per
game last year — is clamping down on op
ponents, giving up 66.8 points per game this
season.
"It's just developing a mentality to try to
defend and rebound first, and that's where
you're going to win games," Howland said.
