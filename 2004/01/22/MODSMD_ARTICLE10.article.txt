## Princeton buildings present difficulties for disabled 
### MARJORIE CENSER THE DAILY PRINCETONLAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J
— David Mann-Podrasky enrolled
in five classes last semester, but he
was forced to sit through part of a
sixth.
A quadriplegic since a swimming
accident at age 14, Mann-Podrasky
uses a wheelchair. His route to class
es in Princeton University's Mc-
Cosh Hall requires him to leave his
Christian ethics course early twice a
week.
"It was annoying to say the
least," he said. "It's sort of strange
walking through someone else's
class."
McCosh Hall is handicapped ac
cessible — technically. It has an ele
vator. But its ramps are flimsy and
steep, not in accordance with feder
al guidelines, acknowledged direc
tor of Physical Planning J on Hlafter.
Students with disabilities on
campus say they enjoy their Prince
ton experience; they often say if
given the chance to pick again, they
would absolutely choose the univer
sity. But these students sometimes
find they are unable to fully partici
pate in campus life, and some, such
as Mann-Podrasky, recognize more
can be done.
"I would say that as a whole [the
university's accessibility] is middle
of the road; they do what the law re
quires," he said. "Do they do a lot
more? I don't think so."
Home to many historic buildings,
Princeton struggles with the expens
es of bringing them up to date. Im
proving accessibility comes after
other priorities because of the small
number of disabled students on
campus.
Nassau Hall is a perfect example
of the obstacles. Constructed in
1756, Nassau Hall symbolizes
Princeton on keychains, sweatshirts
and glossy mailers. As a campus
tour guide, Mann-Podrasky leads
his visitors to the building, but un
like other guides, he can tell its story
only from the outside. To enter the
building from the front requires

climbing six steps, and the building
does not have an elevator.
Hlafter said there are plans to
renovate Nassau Hall, but the de
sign has not yet been worked out.
"I think we're going to be careful
about how we do it," he said. "Not
every historical building in the U.S.
is barrier-free. Some sit where you
destroy part of the fabric of history
if you put a ramp where it shouldn't
be."
When the Association for Dis
ability Awareness and Advocacy
held its Disability Awareness Week
last spring, few people attended its
sponsored lectures or films. Char
lotte Lanvers, president of the orga
nization, said that only emphasized
the need for the event.
"If success is measured by
turnout, then it wasn't very success
ful," she said. "But... as a beginning
point, I would say it was successful.
The entire point of an awareness
campaign is to attract the interest of
the student body."
Part of the association's problem
with low attendance must be attrib
uted to the low numbers of students
with disabilities on campus.
Forty-five undergraduates with
disabilities attend Princeton, ac
cording to Maria Flores-Mills, assis
tant dean of undergraduate stu
dents and liaison to students with
disabilities.
With a student body of 4,600, this
means less than 1 percent is dis
abled. Though Yale is about 700 stu
dents larger, three times as many
disabled students attend.
Certainly not every Princeton
student with disabilities feels ex
cluded from campus life. Eloise
Salmon is living her goal. She had
always wanted to attend Princeton,
even before she became paralyzed
at age 14 as the result of an autoim
mune response. When she visited
the university in the spring'of her
sophomore year of high school, she
saw navigating the campus as possi
ble, provided she take some individ
ual initiative. She purchased a mo
torized scooter, as her manual
wheelchair would not be sufficient

for climbing the large hill on which
campus is situated.
Salmon visited other campuses
during her search, including Muh
lenberg College and Yale Universi
ty. Her final decision came down to
Yale and Princeton. She acknowl
edged that she did not even visit
some campuses, such as Lehigh
University, because she knew its
hills would make mobility too hard.
Now a freshman, Salmon strug
gled to think of anything she would
improve about the university. From
her room in Forbes College, she
praised the accommodations of the
campus, pointing to the double
sized single room complete with
handicapped accessible bathroom.
Forbes College is the most acces
sible residential college because all
of its facilities are located in a single
building. Though the majority of
academic buildings on campus are
at least somewhat accessible, many
dormitories are completely inacces
sible.
Part of the problem stems from
the way in which the buildings were
first constructed, Hlafter said. The
high rock ledge below the earth's
surface and the high water table in
the area impacted the original con
struction of University buildings.
The rock made it difficult to dig
deeply and the dampness caused by
the water table encouraged the uni
versity to install windows in the
basement. As a result, the base
ments of many buildings are higher,
pushing every floor up and increas
ing the number of stairs needed to
enter the front door.
Hlafter knows the role the uni
versity's age has played in its inac
cessibility. He said that by the time
accessibility for the disabled be
came law in the 1960s, far more than
half of the university's buildings al
ready existed.
"There were a whole stock of
buildings not complying," he said.
"Since the 1970s, the university has
been attempting to address those fa
cilities building by building."
Hlafter added that, by law, previ
ously constructed inaccessible

buildings do not have to be made ac
cessible unless they undergo major
renovation. He said all new univer
sity buildings are fully accessible
and comply with current codes.
However, the ADA code does not
require every room or space in the
building to be accessible.
Hlafter defended Princeton's
progress so far.
"I think that it's doing things in a
responsible, continuous, effective
way. There's a limit to how much
you can accomplish. To do it faster,
something else has got to give,"
Hlafter said. "We've had about as
much construction on this campus
the last year or t,wo as we've ever
had. At some point, the quality of
life begins to go down."
Other campus buildings can pose
problems as well. Mann-Podrasky
said, as a tour guide, he met one stu
dent with disabilities who had want
ed to attend the informational ses
sion held by the Admissions Office.
Typically, the meeting is held in
West College, an accessible build
ing, but because of the large group,
the office moved the session to the
Faculty Room in Nassau Hall.
"Can you imagine trying to go to
an information session for the Uni
versity and they're not even putting
it in an accessible place?" Mann-Po
drasky asked. "What kind of mes
sage are you getting?"
Richardson Auditorium, the
largest auditorium on campus and
the site of freshman orientation and
many musical events, is also not
fully accessible. Elizabeth Green
berg, assistant director of the audi
torium, said the university added
two platforms for wheelchairs in the
seating area this summer. However,
to reach the only handicapped ac
cessible bathroom, located on the
lower level, patrons with disabilities
must exit the building, travel
halfway around and then reenter on
the ramp used by performers. In ad
dition, the ticket office, raised sev
eral steps above the ground, is inac
cessible.
Hlafter said his office is working
to add accessible restrooms and a

ticket office on the main level.
"The charge to the architects is to
develop a solution that can be real
ized for $1,000,000 or less," Hlafter
said in an e-mail. "So far they
haven't found an acceptable solu
tion, but they are still working on
the problem."
As a result of the many inaccessi
ble buildings, the university must
make accommodations on an indi
vidual basis. Theri Pickens has
myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular
disease, which leaves her debilitated
some days and able to walk others.
Before she moved into Scully
Hall, completed in 1998, the univer
sity installed an automatic door
opener activated by a button both in
her individual room and for the
door accessing her hallway.
The university also makes adap
tations unrelated to its physical
plan. Flores-Mills said she coordi
nates accommodations for under
graduate students. These may in
clude hiring notetakers, readers and
sign language interpreters, prioritiz
ing the clearing of paths and making
technology available. Salmon said
Flores-Mills even accompanied her
to New York City on a Sunday for a
class trip because Salmon could not
take the train.
But Mann-Podrasky said per
haps the largest problem is not the
buildings or the accommodations in
place; it's the unresponsiveness of
the university administration.
The Disability Services Network,
consisting of roughly 20 staff mem
bers from departments throughout
the university, is the main adminis
trative group designed to address
disability issues.
Mann-Podrasky criticized the
administrative network for refusing
to talk with students. He said the
group wouldn't allow the student
disabilities association to sit in on a
meeting and has not met with them
in any other forum.
"I e-mailed Vice Provost (Joann)
Mitchell and never got a response,"
Mann-Podrasky said. "I would go to
her office [in Nassau Hall], but it's
inaccessible."

sign has not yet been worked out.
"I think we're going to be careful
about how we do it," he said. "Not
every historical building in the U.S.
is barrier-free. Some sit where you
destroy part of the fabric of history
if you put a ramp where it shouldn't
be."
When the Association for Dis
ability Awareness and Advocacy
held its Disability Awareness Week
last spring, few people attended its
sponsored lectures or films. Char
lotte Lanvers, president of the orga
nization, said that only emphasized
the need for the event.
"If success is measured by
turnout, then it wasn't very success
ful," she said. "But... as a beginning
point, I would say it was successful.
The entire point of an awareness
campaign is to attract the interest of
the student body."
Part of the association's problem
with low attendance must be attrib
uted to the low numbers of students
with disabilities on campus.
Forty-five undergraduates with
disabilities attend Princeton, ac
cording to Maria Flores-Mills, assis
tant dean of undergraduate stu
dents and liaison to students with
disabilities.
With a student body of 4,600, this
means less than 1 percent is dis
abled. Though Yale is about 700 stu
dents larger, three times as many
disabled students attend.
Certainly not every Princeton
student with disabilities feels ex
cluded from campus life. Eloise
Salmon is living her goal. She had
always wanted to attend Princeton,
even before she became paralyzed
at age 14 as the result of an autoim
mune response. When she visited
the university in the spring'of her
sophomore year of high school, she
saw navigating the campus as possi
ble, provided she take some individ
ual initiative. She purchased a mo
torized scooter, as her manual
wheelchair would not be sufficient

for climbing the large hill on which
campus is situated.
Salmon visited other campuses
during her search, including Muh
lenberg College and Yale Universi
ty. Her final decision came down to
Yale and Princeton. She acknowl
edged that she did not even visit
some campuses, such as Lehigh
University, because she knew its
hills would make mobility too hard.
Now a freshman, Salmon strug
gled to think of anything she would
improve about the university. From
her room in Forbes College, she
praised the accommodations of the
campus, pointing to the double
sized single room complete with
handicapped accessible bathroom.
Forbes College is the most acces
sible residential college because all
of its facilities are located in a single
building. Though the majority of
academic buildings on campus are
at least somewhat accessible, many
dormitories are completely inacces
sible.
Part of the problem stems from
the way in which the buildings were
first constructed, Hlafter said. The
high rock ledge below the earth's
surface and the high water table in
the area impacted the original con
struction of University buildings.
The rock made it difficult to dig
deeply and the dampness caused by
the water table encouraged the uni
versity to install windows in the
basement. As a result, the base
ments of many buildings are higher,
pushing every floor up and increas
ing the number of stairs needed to
enter the front door.
Hlafter knows the role the uni
versity's age has played in its inac
cessibility. He said that by the time
accessibility for the disabled be
came law in the 1960s, far more than
half of the university's buildings al
ready existed.
"There were a whole stock of
buildings not complying," he said.
"Since the 1970s, the university has
been attempting to address those fa
cilities building by building."
Hlafter added that, by law, previ
ously constructed inaccessible

buildings do not have to be made ac
cessible unless they undergo major
renovation. He said all new univer
sity buildings are fully accessible
and comply with current codes.
However, the ADA code does not
require every room or space in the
building to be accessible.
Hlafter defended Princeton's
progress so far.
"I think that it's doing things in a
responsible, continuous, effective
way. There's a limit to how much
you can accomplish. To do it faster,
something else has got to give,"
Hlafter said. "We've had about as
much construction on this campus
the last year or t,wo as we've ever
had. At some point, the quality of
life begins to go down."
Other campus buildings can pose
problems as well. Mann-Podrasky
said, as a tour guide, he met one stu
dent with disabilities who had want
ed to attend the informational ses
sion held by the Admissions Office.
Typically, the meeting is held in
West College, an accessible build
ing, but because of the large group,
the office moved the session to the
Faculty Room in Nassau Hall.
"Can you imagine trying to go to
an information session for the Uni
versity and they're not even putting
it in an accessible place?" Mann-Po
drasky asked. "What kind of mes
sage are you getting?"
Richardson Auditorium, the
largest auditorium on campus and
the site of freshman orientation and
many musical events, is also not
fully accessible. Elizabeth Green
berg, assistant director of the audi
torium, said the university added
two platforms for wheelchairs in the
seating area this summer. However,
to reach the only handicapped ac
cessible bathroom, located on the
lower level, patrons with disabilities
must exit the building, travel
halfway around and then reenter on
the ramp used by performers. In ad
dition, the ticket office, raised sev
eral steps above the ground, is inac
cessible.
Hlafter said his office is working
to add accessible restrooms and a

ticket office on the main level.
"The charge to the architects is to
develop a solution that can be real
ized for $1,000,000 or less," Hlafter
said in an e-mail. "So far they
haven't found an acceptable solu
tion, but they are still working on
the problem."
As a result of the many inaccessi
ble buildings, the university must
make accommodations on an indi
vidual basis. Theri Pickens has
myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular
disease, which leaves her debilitated
some days and able to walk others.
Before she moved into Scully
Hall, completed in 1998, the univer
sity installed an automatic door
opener activated by a button both in
her individual room and for the
door accessing her hallway.
The university also makes adap
tations unrelated to its physical
plan. Flores-Mills said she coordi
nates accommodations for under
graduate students. These may in
clude hiring notetakers, readers and
sign language interpreters, prioritiz
ing the clearing of paths and making
technology available. Salmon said
Flores-Mills even accompanied her
to New York City on a Sunday for a
class trip because Salmon could not
take the train.
But Mann-Podrasky said per
haps the largest problem is not the
buildings or the accommodations in
place; it's the unresponsiveness of
the university administration.
The Disability Services Network,
consisting of roughly 20 staff mem
bers from departments throughout
the university, is the main adminis
trative group designed to address
disability issues.
Mann-Podrasky criticized the
administrative network for refusing
to talk with students. He said the
group wouldn't allow the student
disabilities association to sit in on a
meeting and has not met with them
in any other forum.
"I e-mailed Vice Provost (Joann)
Mitchell and never got a response,"
Mann-Podrasky said. "I would go to
her office [in Nassau Hall], but it's
inaccessible."
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J
— David Mann-Podrasky enrolled
in five classes last semester, but he
was forced to sit through part of a
sixth.
A quadriplegic since a swimming
accident at age 14, Mann-Podrasky
uses a wheelchair. His route to class
es in Princeton University's Mc-
Cosh Hall requires him to leave his
Christian ethics course early twice a
week.
"It was annoying to say the
least," he said. "It's sort of strange
walking through someone else's
class."
McCosh Hall is handicapped ac
cessible — technically. It has an ele
vator. But its ramps are flimsy and
steep, not in accordance with feder
al guidelines, acknowledged direc
tor of Physical Planning J on Hlafter.
Students with disabilities on
campus say they enjoy their Prince
ton experience; they often say if
given the chance to pick again, they
would absolutely choose the univer
sity. But these students sometimes
find they are unable to fully partici
pate in campus life, and some, such
as Mann-Podrasky, recognize more
can be done.
"I would say that as a whole [the
university's accessibility] is middle
of the road; they do what the law re
quires," he said. "Do they do a lot
more? I don't think so."
Home to many historic buildings,
Princeton struggles with the expens
es of bringing them up to date. Im
proving accessibility comes after
other priorities because of the small
number of disabled students on
campus.
Nassau Hall is a perfect example
of the obstacles. Constructed in
1756, Nassau Hall symbolizes
Princeton on keychains, sweatshirts
and glossy mailers. As a campus
tour guide, Mann-Podrasky leads
his visitors to the building, but un
like other guides, he can tell its story
only from the outside. To enter the
building from the front requires

climbing six steps, and the building
does not have an elevator.
Hlafter said there are plans to
renovate Nassau Hall, but the de
sign has not yet been worked out.
"I think we're going to be careful

some campuses, such as Lehigh
University, because she knew its
hills would make mobility too hard.
Now a freshman, Salmon strug
gled to think of anything she would
improve about the university. From
her room in Forbes College, she
praised the accommodations of the
campus, pointing to the double
sized single room complete with
handicapped accessible bathroom.
Forbes College is the most acces
sible residential college because all
of its facilities are located in a single
building. Though the majority of
academic buildings on campus are
at least somewhat accessible, many
dormitories are completely inacces
sible.
Part of the problem stems from
the way in which the buildings were
first constructed, Hlafter said. The
high rock ledge below the earth's
surface and the high water table in
the area impacted the original con
struction of University buildings.
The rock made it difficult to dig
deeply and the dampness caused by
the water table encouraged the uni
versity to install windows in the
basement. As a result, the base
ments of many buildings are higher,
pushing every floor up and increas
ing the number of stairs needed to
enter the front door.
Hlafter knows the role the uni
versity's age has played in its inac
cessibility. He said that by the time
accessibility for the disabled be
came law in the 1960s, far more than
half of the university's buildings al
ready existed.
"There were a whole stock of
buildings not complying," he said.
"Since the 1970s, the university has
been attempting to address those fa
cilities building by building."
Hlafter added that, by law, previ
ously constructed inaccessible

buildings do not have to be made ac
cessible unless they undergo major
renovation. He said all new univer
sity buildings are fully accessible
and comply with current codes.
However, the ADA code does not
require every room or space in the
building to be accessible.
Hlafter defended Princeton's
progress so far.
"I think that it's doing things in a
responsible, continuous, effective
way. There's a limit to how much
you can accomplish. To do it faster,
something else has got to give,"
Hlafter said. "We've had about as
much construction on this campus
the last year or t,wo as we've ever
had. At some point, the quality of
life begins to go down."
Other campus buildings can pose
problems as well. Mann-Podrasky
said, as a tour guide, he met one stu
dent with disabilities who had want
ed to attend the informational ses
sion held by the Admissions Office.
Typically, the meeting is held in
West College, an accessible build
ing, but because of the large group,
the office moved the session to the
Faculty Room in Nassau Hall.
"Can you imagine trying to go to
an information session for the Uni
versity and they're not even putting
it in an accessible place?" Mann-Po
drasky asked. "What kind of mes
sage are you getting?"
Richardson Auditorium, the
largest auditorium on campus and
the site of freshman orientation and
many musical events, is also not
fully accessible. Elizabeth Green
berg, assistant director of the audi
torium, said the university added
two platforms for wheelchairs in the
seating area this summer. However,
to reach the only handicapped ac
cessible bathroom, located on the
lower level, patrons with disabilities
must exit the building, travel
halfway around and then reenter on
the ramp used by performers. In ad
dition, the ticket office, raised sev
eral steps above the ground, is inac
cessible.
Hlafter said his office is working
to add accessible restrooms and a

ticket office on the main level.
"The charge to the architects is to
develop a solution that can be real
ized for $1,000,000 or less," Hlafter
said in an e-mail. "So far they
haven't found an acceptable solu
tion, but they are still working on
the problem."
As a result of the many inaccessi
ble buildings, the university must
make accommodations on an indi
vidual basis. Theri Pickens has
myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular
disease, which leaves her debilitated
some days and able to walk others.
Before she moved into Scully
Hall, completed in 1998, the univer
sity installed an automatic door
opener activated by a button both in
her individual room and for the
door accessing her hallway.
The university also makes adap
tations unrelated to its physical
plan. Flores-Mills said she coordi
nates accommodations for under
graduate students. These may in
clude hiring notetakers, readers and
sign language interpreters, prioritiz
ing the clearing of paths and making
technology available. Salmon said
Flores-Mills even accompanied her
to New York City on a Sunday for a
class trip because Salmon could not
take the train.
But Mann-Podrasky said per
haps the largest problem is not the
buildings or the accommodations in
place; it's the unresponsiveness of
the university administration.
The Disability Services Network,
consisting of roughly 20 staff mem
bers from departments throughout
the university, is the main adminis
trative group designed to address
disability issues.
Mann-Podrasky criticized the
administrative network for refusing
to talk with students. He said the
group wouldn't allow the student
disabilities association to sit in on a
meeting and has not met with them
in any other forum.
"I e-mailed Vice Provost (Joann)
Mitchell and never got a response,"
Mann-Podrasky said. "I would go to
her office [in Nassau Hall], but it's
inaccessible."
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J
— David Mann-Podrasky enrolled
in five classes last semester, but he
was forced to sit through part of a
sixth.
A quadriplegic since a swimming
accident at age 14, Mann-Podrasky
uses a wheelchair. His route to class
es in Princeton University's Mc-
Cosh Hall requires him to leave his
Christian ethics course early twice a
week.
"It was annoying to say the
least," he said. "It's sort of strange
walking through someone else's
class."
McCosh Hall is handicapped ac
cessible — technically. It has an ele
vator. But its ramps are flimsy and
steep, not in accordance with feder
al guidelines, acknowledged direc
tor of Physical Planning J on Hlafter.
Students with disabilities on
campus say they enjoy their Prince
ton experience; they often say if
given the chance to pick again, they
would absolutely choose the univer
sity. But these students sometimes
find they are unable to fully partici
pate in campus life, and some, such
as Mann-Podrasky, recognize more
can be done.
"I would say that as a whole [the
university's accessibility] is middle
of the road; they do what the law re
quires," he said. "Do they do a lot
more? I don't think so."
Home to many historic buildings,
Princeton struggles with the expens
es of bringing them up to date. Im
proving accessibility comes after
other priorities because of the small
number of disabled students on
campus.
Nassau Hall is a perfect example
of the obstacles. Constructed in
1756, Nassau Hall symbolizes
Princeton on keychains, sweatshirts
and glossy mailers. As a campus
tour guide, Mann-Podrasky leads
his visitors to the building, but un
like other guides, he can tell its story
only from the outside. To enter the
building from the front requires

climbing six steps, and the building
does not have an elevator.
Hlafter said there are plans to
renovate Nassau Hall, but the de
sign has not yet been worked out.
"I think we're going to be careful
about how we do it," he said. "Not
every historical building in the U.S.
is barrier-free. Some sit where you
destroy part of the fabric of history
if you put a ramp where it shouldn't
be."
When the Association for Dis
ability Awareness and Advocacy
held its Disability Awareness Week
last spring, few people attended its
sponsored lectures or films. Char
lotte Lanvers, president of the orga
nization, said that only emphasized
the need for the event.
"If success is measured by
turnout, then it wasn't very success
ful," she said. "But... as a beginning
point, I would say it was successful.
The entire point of an awareness
campaign is to attract the interest of
the student body."
Part of the association's problem
with low attendance must be attrib
uted to the low numbers of students
with disabilities on campus.
Forty-five undergraduates with
disabilities attend Princeton, ac
cording to Maria Flores-Mills, assis
tant dean of undergraduate stu
dents and liaison to students with
disabilities.
With a student body of 4,600, this
means less than 1 percent is dis
abled. Though Yale is about 700 stu
dents larger, three times as many
disabled students attend.
Certainly not every Princeton
student with disabilities feels ex
cluded from campus life. Eloise
Salmon is living her goal. She had
always wanted to attend Princeton,
even before she became paralyzed
at age 14 as the result of an autoim
mune response. When she visited
the university in the spring'of her
sophomore year of high school, she
saw navigating the campus as possi
ble, provided she take some individ
ual initiative. She purchased a mo
torized scooter, as her manual
wheelchair would not be sufficient

for climbing the large hill on which
campus is situated.
Salmon visited other campuses
during her search, including Muh
lenberg College and Yale Universi
ty. Her final decision came down to
Yale and Princeton. She acknowl
edged that she did not even visit
some campuses, such as Lehigh
University, because she knew its
hills would make mobility too hard.
Now a freshman, Salmon strug
gled to think of anything she would
improve about the university. From
