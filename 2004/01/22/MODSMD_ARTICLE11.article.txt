## Gay nuptials should be recognized 
### 
Watching the State of the
Union address on Tuesday
night, I held the modest as
sumption that the state of
the union would be discussed — how
wrong I was. Instead of an articulate
statement on America's progress to
ward its ideals of liberty, freedom and
equality before the law, I was smacked
across the face with a tongue-tied ser
mon urging a war against the education
al freedom of youth and the equality of
gay citizens.

We live in a land of institutionalized
hypocrisy. Our political leaders, little
more than high school bullies, promise
freedom and equality to all... so long
as you're straight. Up until recently,
politicians from many states denied gay
citizens the legal right to have sex. Had
it not been for the politically indepen
dent judiciary, they would still be de
nied this basic human right.

Continuing their
fight to break free
from the status of sec
ond-class citizen, gays
are now demanding
their right to mar
riage. Conservatives,
by which I mean Re
publicans, proclaim
from their political
pulpits that marriage
is a sacred institution,
established by reli-

gious tradition to be between a man and
a woman.
Let me say that I completely agree.
Marriage is a sacred institution. It was
first established by religious tradition,
first practiced between men and
women. But institutions change as soci
eties change. According to the Supreme
Court, Americans have a right to have
sex with members of the same sex; they
have a right to be gay.
Bush said in his address: "I believe
we should respect individuals as we take
a principled stand for one of the most
fundamental, enduring institutions in
our civilization." What better way to re
spect individuals than allowing them
the right to marry? What better way to
stand for the institution of marriage
than by modernizing it to meet the
rights of newly recognized citizens?
We must not allow our government
to legislate based on the religious
dogma of only part of our society. Mar
riage is a sacred institution to many peo
ple, but it is sacred to each in their own
way. Government does not have a right
to dictate in what way something is
holy. Government does not have a right
to recognize something as holy. Its job is
to uphold the rights of its people. There
are gay people in this country, they have
a right to be gay and they have a right to
marry.
Gay citizens are not the only second
class citizens in America. Citizens
under the age of 18 and 21 are not enti
tled to the same rights as their adult
peers. While citizens under the age of 21
are eligible for the draft, they cannot
drink alcohol.
Whether young people should have
more general rights is not a topic for a
humble sex columnist such as myself to
discuss. Whether young people should
have the right to know how to have safe
sex is a topic I have a right and obliga
tion to discuss.
President Bush declared on Tuesday
that he "will double federal funding for
abstinence programs, so schools can
teach this fact of life: Abstinence for
young people is the only certain way to
avoid sexually transmitted diseases." If
federal funding for sex education had
been greater when President Bush went
to school perhaps he would know that
abstinence is the only way for anyone,
not just young people, to avoid STDs.
Promoting abstinence in place of sex
education is irresponsible. The fact re
mains that young people have sex. They
always have and they always will. No
amount of federal funding is going to
change the reality that teenagers are
horny and will follow their evolutionar
ily ingrained instinct to get on one an
other. The only thing the government
can do to protect teens from STDs and
unwanted pregnancy, while they are mi
nors as well as when they become
adults, is to instruct them on how to
have safe, responsible sex.
We must fight for our sexual and do
mestic rights. The youth of America
have a right to know how to have safe
sex. The gay citizens of this country
have a right to marriage.

women. But institutions change as soci
eties change. According to the Supreme
Court, Americans have a right to have
sex with members of the same sex; they
have a right to be gay.
Bush said in his address: "I believe
we should respect individuals as we take
a principled stand for one of the most
fundamental, enduring institutions in
our civilization." What better way to re
spect individuals than allowing them
the right to marry? What better way to
stand for the institution of marriage
than by modernizing it to meet the
rights of newly recognized citizens?
We must not allow our government
to legislate based on the religious
dogma of only part of our society. Mar
riage is a sacred institution to many peo
ple, but it is sacred to each in their own
way. Government does not have a right
to dictate in what way something is
holy. Government does not have a right
to recognize something as holy. Its job is
to uphold the rights of its people. There
are gay people in this country, they have
a right to be gay and they have a right to
marry.
Gay citizens are not the only second
class citizens in America. Citizens
under the age of 18 and 21 are not enti
tled to the same rights as their adult
peers. While citizens under the age of 21
are eligible for the draft, they cannot
drink alcohol.
Whether young people should have
more general rights is not a topic for a
humble sex columnist such as myself to
discuss. Whether young people should
have the right to know how to have safe
sex is a topic I have a right and obliga
tion to discuss.
President Bush declared on Tuesday
that he "will double federal funding for
abstinence programs, so schools can
teach this fact of life: Abstinence for
young people is the only certain way to
avoid sexually transmitted diseases." If
federal funding for sex education had
been greater when President Bush went
to school perhaps he would know that
abstinence is the only way for anyone,
not just young people, to avoid STDs.
Promoting abstinence in place of sex
education is irresponsible. The fact re
mains that young people have sex. They
always have and they always will. No
amount of federal funding is going to
change the reality that teenagers are
horny and will follow their evolutionar
ily ingrained instinct to get on one an
other. The only thing the government
can do to protect teens from STDs and
unwanted pregnancy, while they are mi
nors as well as when they become
adults, is to instruct them on how to
have safe, responsible sex.
We must fight for our sexual and do
mestic rights. The youth of America
have a right to know how to have safe
sex. The gay citizens of this country
have a right to marriage.
