# THE 						RITE OF SPRING
## 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU STAFF WRITER 
As the winter frost begin to thaw, students bare all in traditional rites of passage.
In a ritualistic reenactment of Igor Stravinsky's scandalous 1913 opening of Le
Sacre du Printemps, which caused ballet-goers to riot in the streets of Paris, Stan
ford students strip bare. Few show the modesty of Botticelli's Venus, who covers
herself delicately with her hair as a nymph rushes to clothe her. But then again,
Stanford students aren't goddesses — and we all have our faults.

Stanford is a clothing-optional campus.
That's the conclusion I arrived at when I saw a man running stark naked
through the arches of the Braun Music Center one afternoon last week. A
couple of people turned around and snickered, but the guy really didn't at
tract that much attention. And why didn't he, I asked myself? Is nudity in
all of its varying degrees is old news on the Farm?
Stop and think for a second. How many times have you seen students
walking barefoot on campus? Have you ever been mooned? Did you catch
a glimpse of the half-dozen guys wearing white briefs and running through
the Quad last spring?
I'm not claiming that we live in a nudist colony, but I do think that Stan
ford is a birthday-suit friendly environment.
Practically all of the major university "must-dos" involve nudity of some
sort. Freshmen who have been here a mere few weeks are told to moon the
Golden Fleet during the Scavenger Hunt. Pulling your pants down is op
tional of course, but it wins your team extra points.
Full Moon on the Quad is another mooning favorite for frosh, seniors
and unwanted sketchy guests. Full Mooners tend to take the nudity up a
notch; it's legit to go topless or just in your birthday suit.
And fountain hopping? How many people remember to bring a Speedo
and a dry towel? (I heard from an excellent source that the post office is an
excellent place to warm up, by the way.)
Nakedness moves to a whole new dimension at the scandalous spring
bash Exotic Erotic. Admittance to the most packed party of the year re
quires a couple of dress code alterations: Women may wear only two arti
cles of clothing, men only one.
The crucial question remains: Can Stanford students have fun with all of
their clothes on? Do lots of layers come between us and a good time? Do
we feel the need to take it all off?
And by taking it all off, I'm not just talking about flashing, stripping
mooning and streaking. I'm thinking of less conspicuous acts of nudity —
small ways of saying "I can brave the elements."
Those who walk around barefoot, Hobbit style, should bear in mind that
Hobbits have hair on their feet. Humans don't. I'm assuming that advocates
of 24/7 barefootedness feel hindered by shoes or, for some reason, find
them unnecessary.
The January flip-flop wearers are making a more subtle statement. Ex
posing their toes to the world, they seem to proclaim that their feet can
brave the weather." Flip-floppers are merely conforming to California
dress code, despite the fact that it's in the 50s and usually raining.
Bad weather doesn't stop the mini-skirt fans either. Rainstorms, frost
and howling wind are bringing out large quantities of bare legs.
Looking around at all of the nudity — or pseudo nudity — I get the feel
ing sometimes that we live in a permanent state of Exotic Erotic.
This could explain why we don't keel over in shock when we see naked
people running past us in the middle of the day, or cover our eyes at Full
Moon on the Quad.
The exotic has left the erotic and nudity has become the norm.
Would it be a stretch to say the erotic is gone too? Is there anything sexy
anymore about strutting around with very little on?
