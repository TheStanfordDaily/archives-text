(U-WIRE) BLOOMINGTON, Ind.
— While the media has focused on the
controversy of easier access to birth con
trol pills, not many have paid attention
to the possible sexual side effects of this
contraceptive, until now.
Indiana University's Kinsey Institute
and the Regenstrief Institute for Health
Care of Indianapolis are in the midst of a
study investigating the correlation be
tween oral contraceptives and sexual
dysfunction in women.
"We're looking at the effects of the
pill on sexuality and well being and what
relationship there is between changes in
hormone level and changes in sexuality,"
said Cynthia Graham, a co-principal in
vestigator of the study and IU professor
of psychology. "We know the pill lowers

testosterone levels, and we know women
are more sensitive to that. It's been spec
ulated for a long time that some women
may be negatively influenced sexually by
this, but this is actually the first study of
its kind."
Testosterone occurs naturally in both
males and females but at much lower lev
els in females, Graham said. When start
ing on the pill, the level of testosterone
drops even more, negatively affecting
the sex drive of some women. Graham
said.
It has been theorized that testos
terone and estrogen are the driving
forces of libido, Graham said.
Teri Greco, the other co-principal in
vestigator, said she believes drug compa
nies have been "conveniently" ignoring

sexual side effects over the years.
"It has been known for years that oral
contraceptives can cause a loss in libido,"
Greco said. "Information from drug com
panies has always listed it as a possible
side effect. I'm not sure why it's not a pri
ority. Maybe the drug companies are not
comfortable with it as a side effect."
The idea for the study sprung from
Graham and Greco's mutual interest in
the subject of sexual dysfunction.
"I was interested in female sexual dys
function, and Cynthia was also interest
ed in that and oral contraceptives. So we
sat down and worked on a protocol idea,
how to recruit, eligibility and other crite
ria," Greco said.
As part of the study, women are inter
viewed twice, before and after starting

the pill, and given three free months of
the contraceptive Ortho Tri-Cyclen or
Ortho Tri-Cyclen LO.
The IU Health Center has been a
major recruitment site for the study.
"They've been very pleased with the
response so far. They wanted 60 women
for the study and so far they have 40 en
rolled," University Physician Dr. Diana
Ebling said. "It's an appealing study with
benefits such as being paid and free
pills."
Ebling also praised the goals of the
study.
"This is an area we need to know more
about," she said. "The study is asking
good questions."
Graham hopes the study will be con
cluded by June.
