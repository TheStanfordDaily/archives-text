## State of the Union missed key points 
### 
In Tuesday's State of the Union address,
President George W. Bush predictably
applauded his efforts in every major pol
icy area. But Bush's rosy picture of his ac
complishments and vague explanations of fu
ture proposals leave many unanswered ques
tions on both the domestic and international
fronts.
With voters less confident in Bush's domes
tic successes, the majority of the speech was
spent highlighting positive trends in the econo
my and a series of new initiatives, ranging from
programs to increase employment opportuni
ties for released prisoners to the extension of
abstinence education in schools.
But on the key domestic issues, Bush pro
vided little indication of how his administra
tion would meet critical challenges. In asking
Congress to permanently approve the $1.7 tril
lion tax cut passed on a temporary basis last
year, where was the explanation of how such a
plan would be financed, especially in light of a
rapidly growing budget deficit?
Bush spoke obliquely of reforming Social
Security to allow private investment, but
where was the comment on how such with
drawals would be sustained? His remarks on
the recent upward trends in the economy
sounded promising at first glance, but ob
scured the serious job crisis that continues to
plague the county and deny economic recov
ery to those most hurt by the recession.
And finally, while Bush may have won
election-year points from social conser
vatism with his criticism of the recent judicial
ruling on gay marriage and promotion of
"right" values, he left us wondering: What
happened to the American belief in guaran

teeing equal rights to all citizens?
Understandably, much of Bush's review of
the international scene focused on his crusade
against terrorism, with the word "war" used
more than 10 times and the defense of the
homeland framed as the administration's most
significant responsibility. Building on the mo
mentum of the recent capture of Saddam Hus
sein, Bush applauded the progress made in de
stroying the Bathist regime. But his rhetoric of
a war on terror did not answer our lingering
questions about the legitimate basis for U.S.
preemption, the seriousness of which was high
lighted in the speech's evasive reference to
Iraq's "weapons of mass destruction-related
program activities."
More unanswered questions about Bush's
foreign policies abound: What about a long
term action plan for Operation Iraqi Freedom
and a clear estimate of the costs? Despite talk
of the multilateral nature of the Iraq war, how
is Bush going to address the downturn in U.S.
relations with most of the world? And while
the situation in Iraq certainly commands a lot
of the attention of the administration and
media, what is going on in the rest of the
world? What is the administration's current
plan for pushing negotiations in the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict? Does it have any intent to
address climate change policy or deal with is
sues of environmental protection?
In an election year especially, one would
expect Bush to focus on what he perceives to
be his most important accomplishments. Yet
in doing so, the president sidestepped critical
issues in his governance over the last year
and left many wondering about the real state
of the union.
