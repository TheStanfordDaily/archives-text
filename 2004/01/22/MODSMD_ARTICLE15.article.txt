# Bush needn't push own marriage ideals
## 
### 
Last week, President Bush proposed
that $1.5 billion be spent on pro
grams to both encourage marriage
and to strengthen existing mar
riages. These funds would go to private orga
nizations that would then provide services to
a targeted, low-income population, although
the government-funded programs will be
available to any one who wants them. The
Bush administration believes that the coun
try would be well served by training people
on "interpersonal skills" that would help
form and promote healthy marriages. Bush
also points to numerous studies that children
raised in two-parent households are more
successful, both monetarily and emotionally,
than are children raised in one-parent house
holds. Of course, there are some dubious im
plications behind Bush's motives, including
the fact that this money would only be ap
plied to traditional marriages, excluding gay
couples. Political analysts have pointed to this
as a way for Bush to shore up his conservative
base.
Regardless of what you think of Bush's
motives for proposing this spending, the
plan has several potential problems. First,
while there is evidence that two-parent
households benefit children, there is little
empirical data on what sort of programs
work to either promote marriage in the first

place or to hold marriages together during
troubled times. Beside the
lack of proven efficacy and economic effi
ciency, there is also the dilemma of govern
ment being involved, even in a tangential
way, in such a personal decision as marriage.
There are so many considerations that go
into a decision such as this one. For the Bush
administration to issue a blanket encour
agement of marriage is troublesome both in
the fact that government should not be
making "moral" decisions for people and in
the fact that marriage may not be the best
decision for all couples. Women's groups es
pecially have been quick to point to the dan
ger that such programs will push women
into marriages that are abusive.
The final problem with Bush's plan to pro
mote marriage is that it does not consider all
the possible options to reach its goals. If
Bush's goal truly is to make more stable, lov
ing homes for children, he would not exclude
gay couples from this drive for marriage.
Bush is pushing the sanctity of family, mostly
as a boon for children, yet is also advocating
denying a sizeable portion of the population
the right to become a family. While promot
ing functional marriages and families is an ad
mirable idea, the Bush plan for doing this is
both ineffective and outside the realm of
appropriate government action.
