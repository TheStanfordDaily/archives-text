## ORDER IN THE COURT? Disclaimer: The first sentence is false 
### 
Since I grew up in San Diego,
I feel a religious duty to
watch MTV's new "Real
World: San Diego." Oh,
wait, you probably read the title.
You've probably figured out that
the real reason I watch is an un
quenchable voyeuristic thirst for re
ality soap operas. Damn you, edi
tors, and your appropriate titles!
(Disclaimer: I asked for that title.
And my editor, Anna, is a very nice
person and a pleasure to work
with.)

Where was I? Oh, yes: "Real
World: San Diego." Anyway, I was
watching last week, when I was
struck by a particularly interesting
exchange between two of the char
acters. Randy, a proselytizing ag
nostic, was explaining his beliefs, or
lack thereof, to housemate Robin.
(Disclaimer: I didn't invent the
phrase "proselytizing agnostic."
One of my classmates did.) Robin
told Randy that she believed in
God. Randy pounced on this as sup
port for his own views: "There you
go! You're an agnostic!" (Dis
claimer: I only saw this once, so I'm
probably misquoting him. But that
was the gist of it.)
Hmm . . . that's agnosticism?
Let's see: Merriam Webster's Col
legiate Dictionary defines an "ag
nostic" in part as "one who is not
committed to believing in either the
existence or the nonexistence of

God or a god." (Disclaimer: That's
actually the second listed definition.
The first is "a person who holds that
view that any ultimate reality (as
God) is unknown and probably un
knowable.") If Robin has a firm be
lief in the existence of God, she's no
agnostic.

Now, MTV's often been blamed

for corrupting
the minds of our
youth. (Dis
claimer: I don't
really have a
source for that,
but it sounds
true.) And this is
a good example
of why they de
serve this blame.
Imagine the

scene that must
have occurred in Pennsylvania
Dutch Country last week: A young
Amish child, fresh off viewing
"Real World: San Diego," becomes
confused as to the true meaning of
agnosticism. Though he remains
true to his faith, he rushes into his
parents' room, announcing:
"Mommy! Daddy! I'm an agnos
tic!" Chaos ensues. (Disclaimer:
The Amish, to my understanding,
do not believe in watching televi
sion. So it's doubtful that this actu
ally occurred.)

To avoid cruel misunderstand
ings like this, MTV owes it to the

viewing public to publish dis
claimers. Just some scrolling text at
the bottom of the screen, saying
something like "Randy is misrepre
senting the English language. An
agnostic is actually someone who is
noncommittal about the existence
of God. MTV wishes to disassociate
itself from any suggestion that igno
rance is cool. You should be doing
your homework instead of watching
this."

We here at The Daily Opinions
Department are putting our money
where our mouth is. (Disclaimer: I
speak only for myself here. My edi
tor hasn't even seen this column
yet.) Every time we make a ques
tionable assertion, fail to perform
adequate research, or set up a
straw-man argument simply to tear
it down, we'll let you know. (Dis
claimer: I'm going to quit doing this
next week, even though I find it re
ally helps me to meet the word limit
more quickly.) You can trust us
here at The Daily. (Disclaimer: No,
you can't. You can't trust any news
paper. You ever hear of Jayson
Blair? And what about that one
time the Boston Globe said that "9"
was a prime number?)
