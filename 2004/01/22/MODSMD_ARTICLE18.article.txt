# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
'Loveline' hosts are
welcome guests

Yet again, The Daily editors have
managed to misinform their readers.
On Wednesday, they slammed the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau for bringing
Dr. Drew and Adam Carolla to
speak frankly about sex and relation
ship issues on campus ("Loveline
crew the best we can get?" Jan. 21).
The Daily editors criticized the
speakers, claiming they were
washed-up, has-been celebrities with
a canceled TV show. What they
failed to mention was that Pinsky and
Carolla still have an extremely suc
cessful radio show which is broadcast
nationally, and a Web site that offers
pertinent information for teens with
issues â€”be they eating disorders,
friends in gangs or broken condoms.
In many homes, parents fail to edu
cate their children on how to make
smart decisions and how to maintain
healthy relationships, so Pinsky and
Carolla provide a much-needed ser
vice to those youth. Their advice,
while fresh and funny so that it ap
peals to a younger crowd, is simulta
neously well-grounded in medical
and counseling techniques. This
unique combination is what gains
them devoted listeners, like my 18-
year-old brother, who religiously lis

ten to the show in order to educate
and prepare themselves to make bet
ter decisions in future encounters.

The work that Counseling and
Psychological Services and Health
Promotion Services do is laudable,
but it does not seem to make a differ
ence on campus in terms of un
healthy drinking and relationship
habits. You suggested speaking with
a Peer Health Educator or a repre
sentative at the Sexual Health Peer
Resource Center about problems,
but many of these students are un
willing to say "Stop having sex!" if a
student comes in, scared of a catching
an STD. If all the "Loveline" hosts
manage to do in Memorial Auditori
um on Wednesday is convince some
listeners to stop embarrassing and
disrespecting themselves by random
ly hooking up with a drunk party
goer, I'd say that they managed to
successfully represent and sell a radi
cal idea on campus. Furthermore, if
The Daily really wants to "bring new
perspectives and services" to cam
pus, why did you suggest the familiar
ly liberal Bustamonte and Kucinich
instead of Republican Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger or Sen. Trent Lott?
Perhaps The Daily should consider
whether they themselves bring a
valuable new perspective and service
to campus.

Column on GMOs gave
the wrong idea

Michelle Keller's column on ge
netically modified organisms
("Michelle says: Just eat it already!"
Jan. 21) is terribly misled. First of all,
it doesn't make any sense why she
would discourage individual areas
like Mendocino county from ban
ning GMOs, especially when she
says, "In an ideal world, we would all
be eating organic fruits and vegeta
bles raised in a sustainable manner."
And most of her reasons for why
GMOs are good have nothing to do
with Mendocino County's own food
supply. Simply put, if Mendocino
County residents want to raise wild
tuna, for example, in a way that en
ables the fish to be free of mercury
and full of the healthy fish oils we
need without modifying the fish's
DNA, how is that a bad thing?
Secondly, Keller's naive fantasy
that genetic engineering can in
crease crop yields, can be supple
mented with essential nutrients and
that all of this is good for starving
and malnourished countries, simply
