# OUT OF AFRICA
## An eagle-eye view of race in America 
### MEKLIT WORKNEH STAFF COLUMNIST 
Role-playing is an essential every
day skill in the world we live in. For
instance, you might go from being a
student at Stanford, to being a Lati
no or Asian-American, to being an
activist, a researcher, a musician and
a spoken-word artist. It is interesting
how the multi-faceted lives we lead
here have brought about this skill of
chameleon-like metamorphosis
where we change and adapt to our
different environments.

In my lifetime, I have had to fit
many roles, primarily because of the
fact that I have traveled and lived in
several places. I have been an Ethiopi
an and an African. I have been an in
ternational student and I have been
from a developing nation. I have been
black. I still am all of these things.
I have been a member of the major
ity group and I have been a member of
the minority. But the international
view of the world that my upbringing
has exposed me to has allowed me to
see how in the global scheme of things,
regardless of whether I am represent
ing myself as black, as African or as
Ethiopian, I am still in the "minority."

The realization that I am a "minor
ity" was strange to me, having grown
up mostly in Africa where I would
have never thought to identify myself
as a minority in any sense. My self
identification in this manner came

upon my arrival in the United States.
And I have since wondered what the
psychological ramifications of this
identification have been on me. Be
cause never in my life had I walked
into a classroom and immediately re
alized I was a minority. Never in my
life had I wondered if other people
also noticed I was in the minority. I
wondered: Did my actions reflect my
minority status in the eyes of others?
Yes, these questions and many oth
ers invaded my mind for a good while,
especially my freshman year. I came
Stanford having never experienced
racism or any sort of severe concern
about race. It was interesting dis
cussing these thoughts with my moth
er who has never lived outside
Ethiopia. She had always grown up in
a homogenous society, and although
she had been exposed to a lot through
travel, this idea of identity role-playing
and racial identifications was never a
part of her life. Needless to say, she
told me not to dwell on such thoughts.
However, race can play a huge
role in the lives of "minorities" in
heterogeneous societies like the
United States. It was once I came to
the United States and to Stanford,
that I began to dwell upon things
such as the problematic nature of
referring to ourselves as minorities.
My ideas of race relations in the
United States prior to my arrival here
were most definitely skewed in many
different directions. My ideas of the

black experience in the United States
came from music, movies and a hand
ful of books. On the other hand, the
majority of teachers at my high
school in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,
were white Americans, Canadians
and Britons. Before I came to Stan
ford, a white American teacher at my
International High School explained
to me the problem of "black students
at universities choosing to dissociate
themselves from the larger communi
ty and depriving others of the chance
to get to know them." Once I came to
Stanford, I came to realize how twist
ed this statement was.

You would not see anyone com
plaining if all the kids from Poland
hung out together for example. But
having come from a background of in
ternational schools, which is probably
the closest thing to Dr. King's dream I
have ever seen, I was still saddened by
the ignorance, intolerance and lack of
understanding I saw across all levels.
As time passes however, I find
myself becoming more of an insider
than an outsider. I don't have any so
lutions to offer, I think the dialogues
are just starting, and there are many
who have been dwelling on this much
longer than I. But I don't think it's a
stretch to say the point here is that
racial issues are not in the black and
white we often make them out to be.

themselves from the larger communi
ty and depriving others of the chance
to get to know them." Once I came to
Stanford, I came to realize how twist
ed this statement was.

You would not see anyone com
plaining if all the kids from Poland
hung out together for example. But
having come from a background of in
ternational schools, which is probably
the closest thing to Dr. King's dream I
have ever seen, I was still saddened by
the ignorance, intolerance and lack of
understanding I saw across all levels.
As time passes however, I find
myself becoming more of an insider
than an outsider. I don't have any so
lutions to offer, I think the dialogues
are just starting, and there are many
who have been dwelling on this much
longer than I. But I don't think it's a
stretch to say the point here is that
racial issues are not in the black and
white we often make them out to be.
