# Sixth-ranked women to battle tough LA. teams
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coming off of a week in which the No. 6 women's
basketball team (14-2, 7-0 Pacific-10 conference)
notched another league victory and moved up a spot in
the national rankings, the Cardinal will now look to stay
perfect in the Pac-10 as it takes the road to face rivals
UCLA (8-8,3-4) and Southern California (8-7,5-2).
Friday's game against the Bruins should mark the
return of junior center Chelsea Trotter, who has been
out the last two weeks and sporadically throughout the
season with knee problems.
"I cannot wait," Trotter said. "As the old saying
goes, 'absence makes the heart grow fonder.' Having
not been able to play these past couple of weeks, I am
even more cognizant of how much I love basketball and
the team. Although I can offer my support from the
sidelines, it is much more rewarding to be supportive on
the court."
Worn cartilage has led to arthritis and head coach
Tara VanDerveer has been cutting back Trotter's time
at practice as well as on the court.
"As of right now, I basically go over the offenses,
watch from the sidelines and shoot some free throws.
