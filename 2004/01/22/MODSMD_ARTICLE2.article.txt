# Sixth-ranked women to battle tough LA. teams
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coming off of a week in which the No. 6 women's
basketball team (14-2, 7-0 Pacific-10 conference)
notched another league victory and moved up a spot in
the national rankings, the Cardinal will now look to stay
perfect in the Pac-10 as it takes the road to face rivals
UCLA (8-8,3-4) and Southern California (8-7,5-2).
Friday's game against the Bruins should mark the
return of junior center Chelsea Trotter, who has been
out the last two weeks and sporadically throughout the
season with knee problems.
"I cannot wait," Trotter said. "As the old saying
goes, 'absence makes the heart grow fonder.' Having
not been able to play these past couple of weeks, I am
even more cognizant of how much I love basketball and
the team. Although I can offer my support from the
sidelines, it is much more rewarding to be supportive on
the court."
Worn cartilage has led to arthritis and head coach
Tara VanDerveer has been cutting back Trotter's time
at practice as well as on the court.
"As of right now, I basically go over the offenses,
watch from the sidelines and shoot some free throws.

Freshman guard Markisha Coleman drives against an Arizona opponent earlier this season. The No. 6 women's basketball
team will travel to Los Angeles this weekend to face unranked conference foes UCLA and USC.
My activity is very limited," Trotter said.
There is no doubt that Trotter is key for
the Cardinal to reach its full potential.
'It changes your rotation a lot without
Chelsea," VanDerveer said. "You can only
play Kristen [Newlin] or T'Nae [Thiel]. It's
good to have the post rotation and be able
to play Nicole [Powell] at three more."
The Bruins are a relatively young team,
led by sophomore guard Nikki Blue, who
has 223 points and 92 rebounds this season
and averages 12.6 ppg in the conference.
She also leads the Pac 10 in steals, with 3.25
per game.
"They're perimeter-oriented," Van-
Derveer said of UCLA. "We need to focus
on getting the ball inside."
Freshmen guard Nicole Quinn has
scored in double digits her past seven games
while notching 27 assists. Sophomore guard
Lisa Willis had a career-high nine rebounds
at Arizona, where the Bruins were defeated
70-54 last weekend.
Stanford leads the Cardinal-Bruin series
30-19, and won all three contests last sea
son. The Bruins are 6-1 on their home court
this season while the Cardinal holds a 13-9
record all-time at storied Pauley Pavilion.
The Cardinal's opponent on Sunday,
USC, is currently third in the Pac-10. The
Women of Troy are 5-2 at home in the Los
Angeles Sports Arena and an unblemished
3-0 at home in league play.
The Trojans have been mixing up their
lineup this season. Jan. 17 saw its seventh
(and youngest) starting lineup of the year,
which featured three freshman players â€”
Eshaya Murphy, Jamie Hagiya and Jamie
Funn. USC is led by senior forward Ebony
Hoffman who has averaged 15.3 ppg and
8.7 rpg this season.
Stanford leads the series against the Tro
jans 29-17 and split last season with a Trojan
victory at home last January.
"USC is a bigger team and more physi
cal," VanDerveer said. "They play a very

aggressive style. We need to go in with our
strengths."
Both of the weekend's opponents have a
reputation for playing hard.
"I think the challenges that have
plagued us throughout the year will be pre
sent against UCLA and USC," Trotter
said. "Both of the teams are very athletic
and aggressive. We are going to have to
handle pressure, keep our composure and
play with confidence."
Stanford leads the Pac-10 in 10 differ
ent categories. It has the highest scoring
offense (77 ppg), free throw percentage
(.852), blocked shots (3.86 bpg) and as
sist / turnover ratio (1.22). The Cardinal
also leads in 3-point field goals made (67)
and 3-point field goal percentage (.489).
Also, interestingly, its 3-point shooting is
higher than its overall field goal percent
age of .453.
The long-range bombers lead the team
in scoring, including junior forward Seb
nem Kimyacioglu (142), junior guard Kel
ley Suminski (134) and junior Susan Bor
chardt (127).
Freshman center Kristen Newlin has
been a big contributor to the Cardinal's
lead in blocked shots, averaging 2.13 bpg.
Senior forward Nicole Powell is leading
the conference with an average of 20.8 ppg
and 11.0 rpg and is currently seventh in the
nation with a free-throw percentage of .903.
VanDerveer is confident that the team
has what it takes to make a deep post-sea
son run, especially as all the players begin to
contribute to the total game.
"Our team is playing at a different
level," she said. "We're getting better and
better with people really understanding
what they're doing. We're getting people to
the basket besides Nicole ... but we have to
be able to handle pressure."
With the shakedowns at the top of the
rankings, the NCAA title is beginning to
look like it's up for grabs.
"I think it's wide open," VanDerveer
said. "More similar to the guys' game. If you
have a team that is hungry and healthy, you
have a shot."
