## Super Bowl matchup makes 'Gigli' look like 'Casablanca' 
### 
You won't find them on the American
Film Institute's list of the 100 Great
est Movies of all time or even at the
local video rental store, but few cine
matic endeavors capture as much emotion,
drama and excitement as the Super Bowl re
caps produced by NFL Films.
The beautifully narrated half-hour master
pieces, aired at random hours on ESPN2
throughout most of the year, are shown in non
stop marathon fashion, game after game in nu
merical order leading up to the Super Bowl.
Given what transpired on Championship
weekend, here's hoping ESPN will air them
during this year's game. I might be inclined to
tune in for some Putt-Putt action, too.

In a library of football
highlight reels comparable
to "Casablanca" and "The
Shawshank Redemption,"
this year's Panthers-Patriots
battle could very well be the
"From Justin to Kelly" addi
tion to the shelf. (Yes,
"Gigli" is the popular bad
movie bomb analogy to drop
in this situation, but that
flick has taken so much heat

it's melted from memory.)
I can just see it now. I'll be watching the
Super Bowl recap marathon on ESPN 5 with
my kids 20 years from now, which by that time
will be well over a full 24 hours worth of Super
Bowl highlights. (Potential spouses, consider
yourselves forewarned.) Video of Buccaneers
coach Jon Gruden hoisting the Lombardi tro
phy following his team's victory over Oakland
in Super Bowl XXXVII will fade to black and
the next half-hour recap will open with the coin
flip of Super Bowl XXXIX, featuring none
other than the Redskins and Texans.

"What happened to Super Bowl X-X-X-V-
I-I- (deep breath) -I?" my daughter will ask.
"Oh, they edited that one out," I'll say.
"Trust me, you're not missing much."
I can't remember the last time I was less ex
cited for a Super Bowl. The Ravens-Giants
game a few years back, featuring Kerry Collins
and Trent Dilfer as the starting quarterbacks,
comes close, but this year's matchup takes the
cake.
You've got the defense-led Panthers, the
clear undercats in the eyes of Vegas and ana
lysts alike. Quarterback Jake Delhomme is a
nice story, but let's face it, this No-name wasn't
bagging groceries a year ago a la Kurt Warner.
And then you've got the Patriots, who boast
a similarly dominating defense, a 14-game win
streak and the oh-so-hot-or-cute-depending
on-who-you-ask Tom Brady. Sorry, even he
doesn't keep me up at night.
Don't get me started on the coaching
matchup between Bill Belichick and John Fox.
When I need my fill of men matching wits with
X's and O's, I'll head down to the local nursing
home on Tic-Tac-Toe Tuesday.
By no means am I rooting for a turnover
plagued, defense-heavy, boring game on Feb.
1, certainly not after my roommates and I re
neged on our initial thought to cancel the Super
Bowl party we've talked about having since the
first week of school. I just don't care too much
about the outcome. Who, besides Patriots fans,
really does?
Panthers fans? Is there such a thing? In the
Top 25 poll of what Carolinians care about,
Duke basketball is currently No. 1 (most loved
or most hated), Petey Pablo is No. 2, UNC is
No. 7, NASCAR is ranked disturbingly too
high, incredible BBQ chicken is in there some
where and the Super Bowl-bound Panthers
aren't even receiving votes. I'm kidding, Pan
thers fans. All three of you.
In a desperate effort to get a little more ex
cited about this year's Super Bowl, I played one
of my roommates in a GameCube version of
Super Bowl XXXVIII. With exposure to the
player names, he could at least act like he knew
something about either team come game day.
Playing as the Panthers, he won the toss and
elected to receive. Upon fielding the kickoff,
his player immediately began running the
wrong direction. Seconds passed before he
asked, in a condescending, 'you're such an
idiot' sort of tone, "What are you doing?"
Then, in a dare I say Spencer Porter-esque
moment, he realized he was the Panthers, that
he was the idiot running the wrong direction.
Four plays totaling minus-eight yards and a
turnover on downs later, he stood up and threw
the controller down.
"I'm done," he said. "The Panthers' play
book sucks."
"Yeah, but their defense rocks," I respond
ed, but to no avail.
I finished the game against the computer
opponent, coming back from a 14-point deficit
in the final minute with a frantic rally that cul
minated in a desperation 79-yard strike to Troy
Brown as time expired. In a decision that
haunts me to this day, I elected to go for two
and the win, but failed. Game over. The Pan
thers won. Go crazy.
Now that's NFL film-worthy.

ed, but to no avail.
I finished the game against the computer
opponent, coming back from a 14-point deficit
in the final minute with a frantic rally that cul
minated in a desperation 79-yard strike to Troy
Brown as time expired. In a decision that
haunts me to this day, I elected to go for two
and the win, but failed. Game over. The Pan
thers won. Go crazy.
Now that's NFL film-worthy.

You won't find them on the American
Film Institute's list of the 100 Great
est Movies of all time or even at the
local video rental store, but few cine
matic endeavors capture as much emotion,
drama and excitement as the Super Bowl re
caps produced by NFL Films.
The beautifully narrated half-hour master
pieces, aired at random hours on ESPN2
throughout most of the year, are shown in non
stop marathon fashion, game after game in nu
merical order leading up to the Super Bowl.
Given what transpired on Championship
weekend, here's hoping ESPN will air them
during this year's game. I might be inclined to
tune in for some Putt-Putt action, too.

In a library of football
highlight reels comparable
to "Casablanca" and "The
Shawshank Redemption,"
this year's Panthers-Patriots
battle could very well be the
"From Justin to Kelly" addi
tion to the shelf. (Yes,
"Gigli" is the popular bad
movie bomb analogy to drop
in this situation, but that
flick has taken so much heat

it's melted from memory.)
I can just see it now. I'll be watching the
Super Bowl recap marathon on ESPN 5 with
my kids 20 years from now, which by that time
will be well over a full 24 hours worth of Super
Bowl highlights. (Potential spouses, consider
yourselves forewarned.) Video of Buccaneers
coach Jon Gruden hoisting the Lombardi tro
phy following his team's victory over Oakland
in Super Bowl XXXVII will fade to black and
the next half-hour recap will open with the coin
flip of Super Bowl XXXIX, featuring none
other than the Redskins and Texans.

"What happened to Super Bowl X-X-X-V-
I-I- (deep breath) -I?" my daughter will ask.
"Oh, they edited that one out," I'll say.
"Trust me, you're not missing much."
I can't remember the last time I was less ex
cited for a Super Bowl. The Ravens-Giants
game a few years back, featuring Kerry Collins
and Trent Dilfer as the starting quarterbacks,
comes close, but this year's matchup takes the
cake.
You've got the defense-led Panthers, the
clear undercats in the eyes of Vegas and ana
lysts alike. Quarterback Jake Delhomme is a
nice story, but let's face it, this No-name wasn't
bagging groceries a year ago a la Kurt Warner.
And then you've got the Patriots, who boast
a similarly dominating defense, a 14-game win
streak and the oh-so-hot-or-cute-depending
on-who-you-ask Tom Brady. Sorry, even he
doesn't keep me up at night.
Don't get me started on the coaching
matchup between Bill Belichick and John Fox.
When I need my fill of men matching wits with
X's and O's, I'll head down to the local nursing
home on Tic-Tac-Toe Tuesday.
By no means am I rooting for a turnover
plagued, defense-heavy, boring game on Feb.
1, certainly not after my roommates and I re
neged on our initial thought to cancel the Super
Bowl party we've talked about having since the
first week of school. I just don't care too much
about the outcome. Who, besides Patriots fans,
really does?
Panthers fans? Is there such a thing? In the
Top 25 poll of what Carolinians care about,
Duke basketball is currently No. 1 (most loved
or most hated), Petey Pablo is No. 2, UNC is
No. 7, NASCAR is ranked disturbingly too
high, incredible BBQ chicken is in there some
where and the Super Bowl-bound Panthers
aren't even receiving votes. I'm kidding, Pan
thers fans. All three of you.
In a desperate effort to get a little more ex
cited about this year's Super Bowl, I played one
of my roommates in a GameCube version of
Super Bowl XXXVIII. With exposure to the
player names, he could at least act like he knew
something about either team come game day.
Playing as the Panthers, he won the toss and
elected to receive. Upon fielding the kickoff,
his player immediately began running the
wrong direction. Seconds passed before he
asked, in a condescending, 'you're such an
idiot' sort of tone, "What are you doing?"
Then, in a dare I say Spencer Porter-esque
moment, he realized he was the Panthers, that
he was the idiot running the wrong direction.
Four plays totaling minus-eight yards and a
turnover on downs later, he stood up and threw
the controller down.
"I'm done," he said. "The Panthers' play
book sucks."
"Yeah, but their defense rocks," I respond
ed, but to no avail.
