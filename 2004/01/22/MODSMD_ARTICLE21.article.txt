# Card has chance to avenge loss
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's volley
ball team (4-2, 2-0 Mountain Sports
Federation) has a big weekend ahead,
with an opportunity to avenge the five
game loss it suffered earlier this sea
son. On Friday, the Cardinal will take
on No. 2 Long Beach State (5-1, 1-0),
which edged by Stanford on Jan. 9 in
game five of the UCSB tournament.
The following day, Stanford will face
UCSD (2-1,1-0), the only Division II
team in the MPSF.
But despite the different nature of
their opponents, the Cardinal is antic
ipating both contests with equal inten
sity.
Junior setter Kevin Hansen was
clear that complacency was not an op
tion for his team.
"I think we need to keep improv
ing," he said after a long practice on
Tuesday. "It's not like we beat the two
best teams in the nation last weekend."
Well, not technically.
Hanson's referring to Stanford's
stellar performance last Friday night in
Burnham Pavilion, in which the Cardi
nal upset then-No.2 UCLA in four
games. On Saturday, the Cardinal re
turned to their home court to defeat
then-No.10 UC-Irvine in five.
Coach Don Shaw noted that the
scene has changed since the Cardinal
last took on Long Beach.
"That was really our first real com
petition," Shaw said. "We had nothing
to lose; we certainly didn't know what
to expect."
In its last match up against the 49ers,
Stanford took games one and four by a
slim margin, but was handily beat in
games two and four.
Thanks to the loss, players have a
better sense of what to look for in the
upcoming match.
"[The] number one [priority is]
stopping their best hitter, Scott
Touzinksy," said junior outside hitter
David Vogel.
Vogel registered a double-double in
the Cardinal's last meeting with Long
Beach, posting a career-high 19 kills
and 10 digs.
"If we can keep his hitting percent
age down, we can have a shot of win
ning," he continued.

Touzinksy recorded 20 kills and just
four errors to lead the 49ers to victory
over No. 15 USC last Friday, and 29
against the Cardinal in their last face
off.
Numbers like these make
Touzinksy one of 12 players in 49er his
tory to notch 1,000 kills in a career. In
addition, the senior has posted a daz
zling 128 aces, just four short of match
ing the best in the program's history.
Hansen pointed to serve return as a
key to the match.
"Their serving is really tough, so if
we can stay consistent in our passing,
that makes my job a lot easier,"
Hansen said.
He also explained that the threat of
the Long Beach attack did not stop at
Touzinksy.
"I don't think we've seen, as a
team, that many good hitters. We've
seen more teams with single guys," he
said.
Stanford is taking Saturday's match
up against San Diego just as seriously.
"They always play really hard,"
Hansen said. "We have to treat them
as the number one team in the na
tion."
Shaw agreed that nothing was a
given, in spite of the team's conference
status.
"UCSD is a good team," Shaw said.
"They've always been the doormat of
our conference because they're the
only division two team in the confer
ence."
But Shaw notes that this season San
Diego is "different." The Tritons boast
a more experienced roster, and are also
coming off of a successful weekend,
having upset USC on Saturday.
"If you're not ready to play against
those guys, you're in for a long night,"
Shaw said.
Shaw isn't assuming anything about
Long Beach and San Diego, and sus
pects that after the victories over
UCLA and Irvine, most competition
his team encounters will be equally
careful with the Cardinal.
"I don't think we're going to sneak
up on anybody," he said, "especially
after this weekend."
Stanford will play at The Pyramid
Friday at 7:30 p.m., before traveling to
UC-San Diego on Saturday for a 7 p.m.
game against the Tritons.
