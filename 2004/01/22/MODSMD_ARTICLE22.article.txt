# No. 5 tennis has disappointing showing
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The first tournament of the spring sea
son is over for the men's tennis team. It was
short and slightly painful, but it's over.
Six players traveled to Thousand Oaks,
Calif., on Friday to compete in the Sher
wood Cup, which featured teams from Cal,
UCLA, USC, San Diego State and Baylor
University. They ended their stay early
after failing to put any players through to
the final rounds on Monday.
The team, after being relatively success
ful during the fall preseason, is ranked No.
5 in the nation in the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association preseason poll as of January
13th. Three of Stanford's players — KC
Corkery, James Pade and Sam Warburg —
are also ranked nationally.
Two players, senior Joe Kao and fresh
man Chris Rasmussen, made a showing in
pre-tournament action on Thursday in
order to qualify for the main round of 32.
Rasmussen triumphed over Jason Nguyen
of UCLA 6-7, 6-1, 7-5, but then lost in the
next round to Adam Loucks of UCS 6-1,7-
6. Kao fell in the first round to opponent
Chris Surapol of UCLA 6-1, 6-2.
And then there was Friday.
It was one of those days that a team
would just like to forget, because there
wasn't much to look forward to after the
day was done.
None of the Stanford players won their
singles matches. All six remaining players
in the main draw were dealt losses and
forced into the consolation rounds.
Sophomore KC Corkery, ranked No. 43
nationally in the IT A preseason poll, was
defeated 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 by Cal's Daniel
Sepescan. Redshirt senior Carter Morris,
recently named Team Captain for this sea
son, lost to Kris Kwinta of UCLA, 4-6, 6-3,
6-4.
No. 82 nationally ranked sophomore
James Pade was dismissed 5-7, 7-5, 6-2 by
Johan Berg of USC, while Baylor's Matias
Marian narrowly beat junior Phil Sheng, 6-
3,1-6,7-6.
Following suit, freshman James Wan
fell 6-2, 6-3 to Jamil Al-Agba of USC. Fi
nally, junior Sam Warburg, ranked No. 71
in the ITA preseason poll, was the last team
member to bow out of the main competi
tion, taking a 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 defeat dealt by
Philip Grudler of UCLA.
The team fared better on Saturday
when they tried their luck in the consola
tion rounds. Pade triumphed over oppo
nent Balazs Veress of Cal by a score of 6-4,

3-6,7-5, while Warburg easily handled Jake
Leivent of Cal in two sets, downing him 6-
1,6-1. Wan, having an impressive freshman
season, battled to a 6-2, 7-6 victory over
Cal's Tyler Browne.
Two of Stanford's players were forced
out of singles competition, ending their
tournament play at The Sherwood Cup.
Kao was ousted by Wayne Wong of Cal, 6-
2, 7-5 while Rasmussen was defeated by
Brian Wright of USC, 6-3,6-3.
The Cardinal team also took to the
courts in doubles action, posting an equal
number of wins and losses for the day. The

nationally ranked No. 10 team of KC Cork
ery and James Pade routed UCLA's Jason
Nguyen and Chris Surapol by 8-4. The two
retired in the second round against Drew
Hoskins and Johan Berg of USC, however,
due to injury.
Stanford's duo of Chris Rasmussen and
Phil Sheng triumphed after a close 8-6
match over Philip Gruendler and Aaron
Yovan of UCLA. On the losses side, Joe
Kao and James Wan were defeated by Al
berto Francis and Kris Kwinta of UCLA by
a score of 8-5. Meanwhile, teammates
Carter Morris and Sam Warburg were

ousted from the main draw after narrowly
being overcome 9-8 by Parker Collins and
Daniel Langre of USC.
The team finished match play on Sun
day, competing in singles and doubles con
solation rounds. Kao, after losing his match
the day before, bounced back to obliterate
opponent Aaron Badart of USC, 7-6, 6-0.
Another win was picked up by Wan as he
defeated UCLA's Jason Nguyen 6-3,6-4.
As singles play continued, sophomore


Junior Sam Warburg (above) and the rest of the Cardinal men's team have been ranked No. 5 in the nation in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association preseason poll.
Pade was dropped 6-3,6-1 by Daniel
Jung of San Diego State while Ras
mussen was handed a 7-5,6-0 loss by
Chris Surapol of UCLA.

In doubles, Cardinal duo Morris
and Warburg claimed a 8-1 triumph
over Daniel Jung and Markus Dick
hart of San Diego State. On the flip
side, Rasmussen and Sheng were
overcome 8-4 by USC's Adam
Loucks and Ruben Torres.
The Cardinal's first dual match is
set for Jan. 24 against the University
of Tulsa held in Tulsa, Okla.
