# Swim to face Arizona schools at home
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER 
The Stanford men's swim team will face off
against Arizona State and Arizona this Friday and
Saturday at the Avery Aquatics Center.
The Sun Devils will be up first for the Cardinal,
with the Friday starting time slated for noon.
Then, just 24 hours later, the Cardinal goes head
to-head with eighth-ranked Arizona. Both meets
should provide some good weather and fast swim
ming, especially the Saturday competition against
the Wildcats.
Friday's meet should provide students with a
good excuse to skip class and to work on their
tans. The meet will feature traditional dual
meet events, but like the Michigan meet two
weeks ago, it will be held in the short course me
ters format.
As the Cardinal continues to prepare for the
NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships —
an event that will also be held in the unfamiliar short

course meters format — meets held in meters be
come all the more important.
"Short course meters helps prepare the team for
the true test against the entire nation that we face in
March," senior tri-captain Markus Rogan ex
plained in reference to NCAAs.
In addition to helping the team practice for
NCAAs, the meters format also acts as an in
ternational calibration. The rest of the world
relies on meters formats, so when Stanford
swimmers race in meters, they can compare
their times.
"Racing in meters showcases Stanford's talent to
the entire world," Rogari said.
Following Friday's affair, the Cardinal will com
pete against the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday.
Also starting at noon, the meet will jump back to the
short course yards format.
In addition to the course change, the event com
position will also be modified for Saturday's com
petition. The alterations to the events put more of

an emphasis on sprinting since there will be more
100-yard events.
One final change is that the meet will be swum in
conjunction with the women's teams from Stanford
and Arizona. Unlike usual dual meets, which fea
ture teams of only one gender, Saturday's event will
allow spectators to see even more top-notch ath
letes in action.
The meet should yield some fast times, especial
ly in the sprint events. Arizona star Lyndon Ferns
currently sits atop the nation in the 50- and 100-yard
freestyle events. Juan Veloz, currently first in the
nation in the 200-yard fly, will also be competing for
the Wildcats. Veloz recently tested positive for
steroids but is still allowed to compete in NCAA
competitions.
TTiis weekend marks the start the Pacific 10 Con
ference season for the Cardinal. Standing as the
third and second to last home meets of the year,
these competitions should provide an exciting
weekend of racing.
