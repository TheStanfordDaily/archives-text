### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The road to an undefeated first half of
conference play for the No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team heads straight
through Southern California this week
end.
The Cardinal (14-2,7-0 Pacific 10 Con
ference) faces some tough challenges,
first at UCLA (8-8,3-4) on Friday before
tipping off against the University of
Southern California (8-7,5-2) on Sunday.
While the Bruins sit in the bottom half
of the conference standings, the team's 6-
1 record at home is serious business and
should Stanford win at Pauley Pavilion,
the final stop before the conference's
halfway mark will pit the Pac-10's best
perimeter game against the league's best
three-point defensive game.
Indeed, USC would be only too happy
to mar the Cardinal's conference record
and its athleticism provides the basis for a
successful strategy. While Stanford leads
the Pac-10 in three-point field goal per
centages at .380, the Women of Troy
boast the best three-point defense, per
mitting only .293 shots. More importantly
perhaps, USC has only allowed 140 at
tempts — the lowest in conference play.
Stanford, for its part, can call on an im
pressive array of sharp-shooters begin
ning with junior forward Sebnem Kimya
cioglu, who leads her team with 33 threes
on the season while sophomore guard
Krista Rappahahn leads the conference,
shooting an impressive 70.6 percent be
yond the arch in Pac-10 play.
And really, that's only the beginning of
the Cardinal's shooting finesse. As
demonstrated against California (9-7, 2-
5) last Friday, the team has the experience
to pull off big shots in tight games —
thanks in large part to senior forward
Nicole Powell and redshirt junior Susan
Borchardt.
Acknowledging their huge contribu
tions in Stanford's win this past weekend,
head coach Tara VanDerveer stated,
"Nicole and Susan have really been con
stants. They've both played really well all
season long and they just hold us togeth
er."
As noted by any team in the Pac-10,
the starting point for any defensive strate

gy against Stanford involves containing
Powell, who averages double-doubles at
20.8 points per game and 11 boards. It's
not nearly as easy a feat as one might ex
pect — if you clog the lanes, she'll beat
you with the three.
Borchardt, along with the rest of the
Cardinal backcourt, is key in spreading an
opponent's defense away from the paint.
Against Cal, Borchardt lit up Haas Pavil
ion in the second half, notching 16 points
that included two three's — one less than
a minute into the half and one to ice the
game at 1:44.
If USC and UCLA really want to win
this weekend, they simply cannot leave
the Cardinal women alone outside.
There's a serious catch here though —
while the Women of Troy will have to
continue to keep their opponent's three
point attempts low, Stanford's strong in
side game cannot be ignored where the
impressive tandem of junior posts Azella
Perryman and T'Nae Thiel provide bal
ance to the Cardinal's effective offense.
With USC's three game home-winning
streak on the line, as well as an opportuni
ty to compete with the University of Ari
zona for the second spot in the Pac-10
standings at stake, the Women of Troy
will come out on Sunday ready to win.
The team's athleticism and fast-paced
game will see USC attacking the ball and
interrupting passing lanes on defense —
the squad leads the conference in steals
tallying an average of 12.27 a game.
Stanford, meanwhile, must prepare a
few contingency defensive strategies as
USC is still searching for a cohesive unit
on the floor. Against the Arizona teams
last weekend, USC started its seventh
line-up of the season, promoting three
freshmen to starting positions. The team's
one constant is its leader — senior for
ward/center Ebony Hoffman averages
15.3 points per game to go along with 8.7
rebounds. Among such a young squad,
Hoffman's maturity will be critical to
USC's success and containing her will be
critical for the Cardinal.
Stanford has the offensive and defen
sive performances to ensure that there's
no Hollywood ending for either of the
SoCal schools — it just has to make sure
that neither UCLA nor USC controls the
game's script.
