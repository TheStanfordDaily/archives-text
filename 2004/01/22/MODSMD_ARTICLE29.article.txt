# COMEBACK KID
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The defense of the No. 6 Stanford women's
basketball team (14-2,7-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
has been nothing less than stingy this season. The
Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in scoring defense, giv
ing up just 56.3 ppg, with junior forward T'Nae
Thiel as the anchor.
Thiel, however, hasn't been able to be on the
court for every game. She missed the first five
games of the season — not to mention the team's

September trip to Italy — with a stress fracture in
her left foot.
While many stress fractures can be treated
with a cast, crutches and rest, Thiel's injury re
quired surgery, which increased recovery time.
All in all, Thiel spent three months rehabilitating
and still feels that she is not all the way back.
"I would say I'm probably not 100 percent
yet," she said. "I still get sore, but it's progress
ing."
Thiel has seen a consistent increase in her min
utes and has worked her way back into the start

ing lineup after starting all 32 contests last year.
But, the transition has not been easy.
"Coming back was very frustrating on several
levels," Thiel said. "First, missing Italy, which we
had been raising money for and looking forward
to for a year. I stayed out here this summer, was
working out for this year and trying to get ahead
and then to end up several months behind was
frustrating."
The Texas-native is refreshingly honest about
the difficulty of returning from injury.
"[It] has been a challenge. I felt like I lost a lot
of my timing and have slowly been getting it
back," she said. But, it's still a work in progress. I
was rusty coming back after being off for three
months."
While she won't admit it, Thiel didn't seem to
miss a beat on the defensive end after her injury.
Instead of attributing it to her flat-out natural
ability on defense (which she clearly possesses),
Thiel quickly points to the pride she takes in
working hard on defense and what defensive as
pects she needed to concentrate on upon her re
turn.
"I feel like I was a little bit slower and not quite
as strong coming off my injury. So that took some
practice and some work."
Standing 6-foot-l, Thiel is almost never the
tallest, fastest or strongest player on the court —
but she still draws the toughest defensive
matchups at the post and usually succeeds in shut
ting down her opponent. Often giving up two-to
three inches to opposing players, Thiel looks for
other ways to be effective.
"I'm not ever the biggest player on the court —
or the quickest," she said. "So I rely a lot just on
being intelligent and just trying to identify and
take away the other players' best assets. And
that's worked pretty well for me so far."
Most would agree that it's worked better than
just "pretty well."
Thiel, named the Cardinal's co-Best Defensive
Player at last year's team banquet, was a big rea
son for Stanford's recent domination of Arizona,
the second-place team in the conference. She
matched up with Shawntinice Polk, a player
whom Thiel descibed as her toughest assignment
to date, and entirely shut her down.
Polk, who is four inches taller than Thiel and
probably as strong as some Division I men's play
ers, never established good position down low,
was forced to receive entry passes at the top of the
key and finished with just six points and as many
turnovers.
Thiel is yet to be satisfied with her game
though. Without any pretense, she freely offers an
evaluation as to what she wants to improve.
"I'm trying to develop more of an offensive
role on the team," Thiel said. "I don't want to hold
our team hostage as far as having to be on the
floor to play defense, but I feel like I can con
tribute in many different areas. I think I'm a
strong passer in our offense and I keep things
going."
And as she gets closer to 100 percent health
wise, Thiel's role in the offense has been more
pronounced. Just two weeks ago she scored a sea
son-high 11 points against Arizona while adding
five assists. She then added five more assists in the
Cardinal's victory over Cal.
Things aren't going to get any easier for Thiel
and the rest of the Stanford squad this weekend,
as the Cardinal face third-place Southern Califor
nia (7-6,4-1 Pacific 10 Conference) on Sunday.
The Women of Troy are led by forward and
National Player of the Year candidate Ebony
Hoffman, who will primarily be Thiel's responsi
bility. She will surely be up to the challenge as she
gets closer to full strength with each outing.

Standing 6-foot-l, Thiel is almost never the
tallest, fastest or strongest player on the court —
but she still draws the toughest defensive
matchups at the post and usually succeeds in shut
ting down her opponent. Often giving up two-to
three inches to opposing players, Thiel looks for
other ways to be effective.
"I'm not ever the biggest player on the court —
or the quickest," she said. "So I rely a lot just on
being intelligent and just trying to identify and
take away the other players' best assets. And
that's worked pretty well for me so far."
Most would agree that it's worked better than
just "pretty well."
Thiel, named the Cardinal's co-Best Defensive
Player at last year's team banquet, was a big rea
son for Stanford's recent domination of Arizona,
the second-place team in the conference. She
matched up with Shawntinice Polk, a player
whom Thiel descibed as her toughest assignment
to date, and entirely shut her down.
Polk, who is four inches taller than Thiel and
probably as strong as some Division I men's play
ers, never established good position down low,
was forced to receive entry passes at the top of the
key and finished with just six points and as many
turnovers.
Thiel is yet to be satisfied with her game
though. Without any pretense, she freely offers an
evaluation as to what she wants to improve.
"I'm trying to develop more of an offensive
role on the team," Thiel said. "I don't want to hold
our team hostage as far as having to be on the
floor to play defense, but I feel like I can con
tribute in many different areas. I think I'm a
strong passer in our offense and I keep things
going."
And as she gets closer to 100 percent health
wise, Thiel's role in the offense has been more
pronounced. Just two weeks ago she scored a sea
son-high 11 points against Arizona while adding
five assists. She then added five more assists in the
Cardinal's victory over Cal.
Things aren't going to get any easier for Thiel
and the rest of the Stanford squad this weekend,
as the Cardinal face third-place Southern Califor
nia (7-6,4-1 Pacific 10 Conference) on Sunday.
The Women of Troy are led by forward and
National Player of the Year candidate Ebony
Hoffman, who will primarily be Thiel's responsi
bility. She will surely be up to the challenge as she
gets closer to full strength with each outing.

Junior forward T'Nae Thiel shoots a free throw earlier this season. Thiel is almost at full strength after
suffering a stress fracture in her left foot, which is good news for the No. 6 Cardinal.
The defense of the No. 6 Stanford women's
basketball team (14-2,7-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
has been nothing less than stingy this season. The
Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in scoring defense, giv
ing up just 56.3 ppg, with junior forward T'Nae
Thiel as the anchor.
Thiel, however, hasn't been able to be on the
court for every game. She missed the first five
games of the season — not to mention the team's

September trip to Italy — with a stress fracture in
her left foot.
While many stress fractures can be treated
with a cast, crutches and rest, Thiel's injury re
quired surgery, which increased recovery time.
All in all, Thiel spent three months rehabilitating
and still feels that she is not all the way back.
"I would say I'm probably not 100 percent
yet," she said. "I still get sore, but it's progress
ing."
Thiel has seen a consistent increase in her min
utes and has worked her way back into the start

ing lineup after starting all 32 contests last year.
But, the transition has not been easy.
"Coming back was very frustrating on several
levels," Thiel said. "First, missing Italy, which we
had been raising money for and looking forward
to for a year. I stayed out here this summer, was
working out for this year and trying to get ahead
and then to end up several months behind was
frustrating."
The Texas-native is refreshingly honest about
the difficulty of returning from injury.
"[It] has been a challenge. I felt like I lost a lot
of my timing and have slowly been getting it
back," she said. But, it's still a work in progress. I
was rusty coming back after being off for three
months."
While she won't admit it, Thiel didn't seem to
miss a beat on the defensive end after her injury.
Instead of attributing it to her flat-out natural
ability on defense (which she clearly possesses),
Thiel quickly points to the pride she takes in
working hard on defense and what defensive as
pects she needed to concentrate on upon her re
turn.
"I feel like I was a little bit slower and not quite
as strong coming off my injury. So that took some
practice and some work."
