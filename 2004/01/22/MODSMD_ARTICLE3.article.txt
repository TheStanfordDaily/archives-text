# A 						Little work Goes A Long Way
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Some basketball players like hav
ing the keys to campus handed to
them before they commit to a col
lege. They goof around in practice,
play video games during the day and
party at night.
Rob Little is not one of those
players.
The junior from Hampton, Va.,
who is now the starting center on the
No. 2 basketball team in the country,
was naturally blessed with height.
The rest of his success has come
from hard work.
In his first two years at Stanford,
it often seemed that Little's destiny
as a ballplayer would be to take up
space. At 6-foot-10 and 285 pounds,
he was as solid as an oak tree and
spent almost as much time rooted to
the ground. His fundamental skills
were sound, but he fatigued quickly,
which contributed to mental mis
takes.
To this day, the "fun fact" on his
Espn.com player page reads: "Little
qualifies as one of the heaviest play
ers in college basketball."
But it's not true anymore.
During the offseason, Little
worked out religiously, training five
days a week and "resting" with ac
tivities like swimming, bike riding
and yoga.
More importantly, he gave up
sinful habits like late-night Domi
no's, late-night ice cream and
smoothies, and, well, Late Night. He
said people are constantly asking
him for the secret of how he slimmed
down to eight percent body fat from
14 percent.
"You've got to eat the right kind
of foods," he says. "It's no secret,
you just have to really stick to it."
He admitted that he has help
from his roommates, sophomore
guard Chris Hernandez and junior
forward Josh Childress.
"Chris and Josh keep tabs on me.
Chris is a bitch as far as not letting
me have snacks in the room," he
says, laughing.
Little used to cut an imposing fig
ure on the court merely because of
his size, but he now can intimidate
opponents with his athleticism. Fans
seeing Little for the first time this

year marvel at his newfound ability
to spring off the floor for a quick put
back or alley-oop dunk.
Since dunks aren't a statistical
category, the easiest place to gauge
Little's improvement numerically is
by the drop-off in fouls. Last year he
averaged a foul every six minutes on
the court. This year it's been one
every 12 minutes.
Head coach Mike Montgomery
recently pointed to Little's dedica
tion to improving his game as an ex
ample of how Stanford is able to
compete with programs that draw
far more heralded recruits.
"You've got to give Rob a ton of
credit for changing his make-up,"
Montgomery said. "He was a kid
that had to progress, and he's done
that."
Little doesn't just lead by exam
ple, though. A philosophy and polit
ical science double-major, he is quiet
off the court. But during practices
and games, he shouts, yells, points
and gesticulates. And in the locker
room, he sometimes takes on the
role of the philosopher, urging his
teammates to keep their successes
and failures in the proper perspec
tive.
"I think our biggest weakness
could be complacency," he says.
"We've blown leads a couple times
this year and let teams back in. The
biggest thing I fear, being undefeat
ed, is the one night you come into a
game thinking you're going to win
just because you're Stanford . .
.That's when we lose a game that we
should win."
When he's not playing center or
helping his teammates stay cen
tered, Little spends much of his time
studying.
"The first thing my parents ask
when they call me is, 'How's school
going?'," Little says. "My mom al
ways says, 'You need a 3.5 for your
law school application. You've got
to get your recommendations.' I'm
like, 'Mom, can't I at least try to go
to the NBA for a couple years?' "
Little might have a future in the
professional ranks —he sees him
self following in the tradition of
Mark Madsen, another Cardinal big
man who traded on hard work and

physicality — but he's proud to say
that he considers academics an im
portant part of his life.
"I'd be lying to myself if I said
academics isn't important to me," he
said. "It's not like you can just do
one thing. That's not how the world
works."
Rather than being resentful that
he has to work much harder at Stan
ford than he would elsewhere, Little
delights in the challenge.
"We've got such great academics
here, such great sports. You've got
to do something special to get recog
nition here, and that's humbling. It's
not like [some colleges] in the Mid
west, where if you play basketball
you've got 20 people serving your
feet. Stanford gives you a little taste
of what it's really going to be like out
there in the real world, because no
one's going to kiss your ass."

"I think it's great," he added. "No
one's going to give you credit just for
showing up. Let's produce, let's get
some wins. It breeds a very competi
tive, hard-working environment,
which I think we're going to meet in
the work world."
It may seem that Little's world al
ready is full of work, but he's quick
to disagree.
"When else are you going to have
a chance to read Kant, read Niet
zsche, Dworkin, John Rawls?" he
asked. "Nobody cares about philos
ophy in the real world, even though
it sets the fundamental basis of what
you believe."
When Little was, well, little, he
pretended to be Shaquille O'Neal on
the basketball court. Perhaps it's ap
propriate, since O'Neal has been
known to call himself the Big Aristo
tle. Asked whether he would fit that
description better, Little said he
wouldn't try to steal the Lakers
star's nickname.
"I guess if I made it to the NBA, I
could be the Big Kant," he says with
a smile.
