## Speaker tells crowd about 'what the media leaves out' 
### SARAH TENG 
In an event hosted by the Muslim
Student Awareness Network, Alison
Weir, a freelance journalist and direc
tor of If Americans Knew, spoke to a
small crowd about "What the Media
Leaves Out" last night.
Weir claimed that major news
sources such as the San Jose Mercury
News, the San Francisco Chronicle
and The New York Times often omit
ted injustices done to Palestinians,
choosing to focus on the plight of Is
raelis in the ongoing Middle East
conflict.
"What side are you on?" asked
Weir. "There are principles I try to
uphold — all human beings are equal
and entitled to the same rights — and
I am against discrimination. Those
are the only sides I take."
Weir presented facts to support
her belief in a lack of media coverage
on Palestinian deaths. She cited a re
cent study, which found that, over the
period of the study, there were 121 Is
raeli deaths and 384 Palestinian
deaths recorded in the conflict. Yet
only 14 of those Palestinian deaths
were reported on front-page head
lines of the San Jose Mercury News,
while 85 Israeli deaths were reported.
Weir also used anecdotal evidence
in her presentation. She mentioned
Rachel Corrie, a 25-year-old Ameri
can nonviolent peace activist who
was crushed to death by an Israeli
bulldozer as she tried to prevent the
Israeli military from destroying a
Palestinian family's home in the Gaza
Strip, stating that this event received
little attention from American news
papers.
Weir then presented photographs
of Palestinian citizens she had taken

during her month-long journey
through the Middle East, which in
cluded a smiling family, a Christian
couple, a young girl playing with a
dog and a little boy holding a frag
ment of the missile that came through
the wall of his house. Weir used these
images as a contrast against her per
ception of the American media's por
trayal of Palestinians as hostile ter
rorists.
Weir also commented on her ex
perience with the Palestinian people.
"I was tired of telling people that
Americans don't know what they're
doing ... that American newspapers
don't tell us," said Weir. "I'm not ask
ing for Pro-Palestinian coverage. I'm
just asking for accurate coverage."

dation Weir makes for resolving this
issue.
"Look at how few of us are here,"
Weir said. "We must inform our par
ents and neighbors, put on events like
this at libraries, synagogues, spread
the word to everyone we know."
The audience echoed Weir's mes
sage.
"Our goal is to raise awareness of
the issues," said senior Ali Hassan,
president of MS AN.
"It is never wise to believe what
ever you hear," senior Imran Moin
uddin said. "This talk will hopefully
open up a healthy debate."
