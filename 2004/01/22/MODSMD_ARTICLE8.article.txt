# 'Loveline' hosts rock MemAud
## Students pepper MTV hosts with questions from orgasms to illicit drugs 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
About 1,650 people crowded into the
first floor and balcony of Memorial Audi
torium last night for one of the largest
events sponsored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau this year.
Dr. Drew Pinsky and Adam Carolla,
best known for their roles as hosts of the
radio and MTV talk show "Loveline,"
answered questions about topics like
penis enlargement, the female orgasm
and the use of Viagra.
But Pinsky said that Stanford's audience
tended to ask fairly neutral questions com
pared to what they heard on the usual show.
"[The questions are] usually a little
wilder," he said.
"Right when we got out of the blocks,
the questions were not as wild," agreed
Carolla.
As crowds gathered outside Mem Aud
before the show last night, many said they
had been anticipating the event for some
time.
Director of the Speakers Bureau Vinita
Kailasanath, a senior, introduced the duo.
"It'll be unlike all of [the other] events
because tonight, you, the audience, will
control the show," Kailasanath said.
The first half of the show was continual
ly interrupted by microphone problems.
Nonetheless, Carolla poked fun at Stan
ford students.
"I know you guys out here, you're liber
al, you're Democrats, you're all, 'We love
the Bay,' " he said.
The two also addressed a heated campus
issue when an audience member asked
about Pinsky's opinion on the stringent Al
cohol Policy at Stanford.
"Every study that I've seen shows that
these policies are effective," said Pinsky,
coming down on the University's side of the
argument.
On the other hand, Carolla's advice was
to "just pad everything so no one hits their
head."
The audience initially seemed reserved,
asking questions about Carolla's show,
"Crank Yankers," and how much money
the two were being paid for the night (the
answer: $10,000 each). A few audience
members even brought gifts of nuts and
Crown Royal for the speakers, which Car
olla and Pinsky accepted hesitantly.
Carolla impressed some audience mem
bers by throwing cashews into their mouths,
interrupting Pinsky's more serious advice.
"Why do you have to get loaded if
hooking up is such a good thing?" asked
Pinsky.
"Guys get drunk getting girls drunk,"
answered Carolla with his trademark
humor.
"But emotionally significant conversa
tion is the way to truly connect with a girl,"
said Pinsky, making his final point.
The two also discussed the notion of the
"double standard" in society, in which
women who are very sexually active are
viewed in a more negative light than are
men who behave in the same manner.
"If a woman is sexually aggressive, men
will take note of that and move on with
their lives," Pinsky said. "It's actually
women who perpetuate this double stan
dard."

After the show, students who lingered in
the lobby said they enjoyed the show.
"I think this is the best event that I've
been to at Stanford," said Edwina Beaux,
Class of 2001.
"It was better than the Daily adver
tised," said junior Ali Brincat, referring to
an editorial published yesterday that criti
cized the Speakers Bureau for selecting
Pinsky and Carolla over someone with
more notoriety.
Carolla and Pinsky had also read the ed
itorial and spoke briefly about it after the

show.
"The editorial was scathing," said Pin
sky, "just scathing."
Nevertheless, the two were glad to have
the experience to talk to college students
about some important issues of sex, love
and drugs.
"We like dealing with people with real
issues on a real level," Pinsky said.
"We just like the free exchange of real
ideas ... we don't like the scripted for
mat," said Carolla. "We're just both inter
ested in how people work."
