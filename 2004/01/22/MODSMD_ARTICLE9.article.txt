# Libraries offer cash for coolest book collection
## 
### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford University is
known for its unusual tradi
tions: make-out sessions in
the Quad, the less-than-dig
nified Wacky Walk at Com
mencement.
Now, the University li
braries are establishing a
more highbrow tradition: a
book-collecting competition.
"Collecting books and
other printed materials is a
mark of a literate and cul
tured society," said the As
sociates of the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries in a press
release announcing the Byra
J. and William P. Wreden
Prize for Collecting Books
and Related Materials.
The competition, which
offers a $1,000 prize, was the
result of a conversation be
tween University Librarian

Michael Keller and William
P. Wreden Jr., who met three
years ago to discuss what
would be the most appropri
ate use of funds donated to
the libraries in Wreden's
parents' name.
"Keller enthusiastically
felt a renewed prize for book
collecting would be best, and
I concurred," Wreden said.
According to Wreden,
book-collecting contests
exist at most major universi
ties, including Harvard,
Princeton and Yale. The As
sociates of the Stanford Uni
versity Libraries offered a
similar prize at Stanford be
tween 1977 and 1981, but it
was discontinued until now,
though English Profs. Jay
Fliegelman and Stephen
Orgel are both noted book
collectors.
Wreden emphasized that
the contest will be judged on

the basis of creativity, origi
nality and the passion of stu
dents' collecting interests,
rather than the rarity or
value associated with their
collections.
"This prize especially
aims to recognize those who
demonstrate a creative and
innovative approach to col
lecting," said the Associates
in a press release.
To apply, students must
submit an annotated bibliog
raphy of their selection, ac
companied by a short essay
describing how they assem
bled their collection and de
tailing their plans for its
growth. The contest will be
judged by a panel of librari
ans and faculty, plus a book
seller and a book collector.
Some funding for the
competition will be provid
ed by the Book Club of Cal
ifornia.
