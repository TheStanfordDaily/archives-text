# Journalist speaks about Pearl's death
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
Two years after the death of
journalist Daniel Pearl, French
philosopher and journalist Bernard
Henri-Levy spoke in Encina Hall's
Oksenberg Room to discuss his
personal investigation into Pearl's
murder. Pearl, a Stanford graduate
and reporter for The Wall Street
Journal, was working on a story in
Pakistan at the time of his death.
After hearing about Pearl's
death while on an envoy mission to
Afghanistan for the French govern
ment, Henri-Levy decided to pur
sue his own investigation into
Pearl's murder, which led to the
creation of his book, "Who Killed
Daniel Pearl?"
"I cannot explain why, but I was
so deeply shocked, so deeply
moved that I decided to devote as
much time [as necessary], a few
months, a year, to try to find the
truth," said Henri-Levy of his rea
son for pursuing the investigation
into Pearl's death.
Henri-Levy described his novel
as a two-fold investigation of both
Pearl and Omar Sheikh, who
Henri-Levy claims is Pearl's mur
derer. Henri-Levy described
Sheikh as the mastermind of the
plot and a member of the Pakistani
secret service.
"Henri-Levy is an interesting
man, and it feels as though he's
trotting on grounds he's not al
lowed to trot on," said Eva Meyers
son Milgrom, senior researcher and
assistant professor at the Graduate
School of Business. "It was clear
from his talk that he went about
writing the book by putting himself
in other people's shoes: that of both

Pearl and the murderers."
Henri-Levy's hypothesis for
Pearl's murder is that the content of
Pearl's investigation was what
caused Al-Qaeda, the Pakistani se
cret service, and six or seven of
Pakistan's foremost jihad groups to
cooperate in Pearl's death.
He pointed out that one of the
repercussions of Pearl's death is
that journalists now have a more
difficult time working in that area.
"I just wanted to know, 'Why
Pearl?' " said Mark Kritz, a Los
Gatos resident of his reason for
coming to the talk. "Is every Amer
ican journalist at risk, or was there
something Pearl was doing in par
ticular? And apparently it was
something particular to Pearl."
Henri-Levy said he believes
Pearl was investigating three topics
at the time of his death. The first
was Richard Reid, the shoe
bomber, and his terrorist affilia
tions. The second was Mubark Ali
Shah Gilani, who Henri-Levy de
scribed as Osama bin Laden's
"spiritual Guru." Pearl was also in
vestigating Pakistan's nuclear pro
gram and the ties of its scientists to
Bin Laden.
While the Bush administration
identified Khalid Shaikh Mo
hammed as Pearl's killer, Henri-
Levy said he believes it is not prob
able that such a high-ranking Al-
Qaeda official would commit the
crime, pointing out that Fazel
Karim made no mention of Mo
hammed's affiliation to the death
when confessing to the police.
"I change myself, my mind,
throughout the book," said Henri-
Levy. "I try to go through the many
actors, the many plots and I don't
reach a final conclusion."
