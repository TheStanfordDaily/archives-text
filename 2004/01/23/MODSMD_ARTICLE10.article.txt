## Great Donation might not be so great 
### 
Last week, flyers advocating sup
port for the Great Donation ap
peared in the hallways and bath
rooms of dorms across campus.
Organizers explain the Great Donation as
an opportunity for Stanford students to
aid the less fortunate through an annual
fee collected by the ASSU â€” a charge
analogous to the Special Fees currently
collected by student groups. The proposal
is still in its infancy, and we urge the
ASSU to exercise caution when deter
mining whether to allow such a proposi
tion to appear on the upcoming spring
elections ballot.
Organizers are petitioning the ASSU to
add a special referendum to the spring
elections, through which students would
vote to either approve or reject the pro
posal. If passed, the Great Donation
would collect $3 per student annually. The
majority of the collected monies would be
donated to a charity of the student popu
lation's choosing, and the remainder
would be deposited into an endowment
for future sustainability.
In practice, organizers are requesting
that the Great Donation be permitted to
collect Special Fees from the student
body. But the ASSU specifically states
that the only groups permitted to collect
such fees are organizations with annual
budgets totaling more than $6,000.
The Great Donation, if enacted as pro

posed, would have minimal operating
costs, and it would most likely not meet
the $6,000 threshold. The numbers are not
particularly surprising, considering that
the organization would be little more than
a money-pusher. The premise behind
Great Donation is simple: Collect funds
from students, then forward those funds
to charities.
But where is the student involvement?
Where is the community engagement?
The Great Donation would require mini
mal involvement on the part of students,
save for a few financial transactions. It is
questionable whether the organization
would qualify as a student group, in any
sense of the term.
Granted, organizers are not positioning
the Great Donation as a traditional re
quest for Special Fees, but the ASSU
should exercise caution in deciding
whether to include the proposal on the
spring ballot. The Great Donation would
raise a number of issues not related to its
structural framework. Involuntary dona
tions would become a question of rele
vance, as would the political leanings of
chosen charities. Although students
would have the opportunity to request a
refund from the ASSU, we feel that this
burden ought not to lie on the student
body. We strongly urge the ASSU to
closely evaluate the implications of such a
proposal.
