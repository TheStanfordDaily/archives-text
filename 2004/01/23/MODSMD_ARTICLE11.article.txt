# JACK AND JILL, MINUS JACK
## The
						risks of being a risk-taker 
### 
Last Friday, I had the pleasure of
stumbling through an interview
on Ecuadorian television along
side the other members of my
adventure racing team. During the inter
view, the commentator asked me what
motivated me to come do such a race. On
the spot, I fabricated something about
how I had friends that had done such
races and I had always thought it'd be
cool to do one.
But what's the real reason? At first, I
thought the answer had something to do
with competition and how some people
are drawn to competitive environments
and experiences. But soon afterward, I
realized that my decision to do this race
had little to do with competition with oth
ers, but much to do with my attraction to
taking risks.
Somewhere along the way, I must
have learned that taking risks leads to re
wards that I enjoy. Perhaps it was ele
mentary school — raising my hand in
class could lead to my answering a ques
tion right, which could help me earn a
gold star sticker. Or trying out for a team
could lead to a wealth of opportunities in
the people I'd meet, games I'd get to play
and fun I'd have. At the same time, I al
ways loved being outdoors. So, I must
have started to become comfortable tak
ing my risks there. These days my favorite
rewards are reaching mountaintops and
great views or just having done the climb.

Of course, everyone has a different
view of what qualifies as dangerous, and

thus, what consti
tutes a "risk." Cer
tainly, traveling in
the wilderness is one
type. But driving a
car is another, and
most of us take this
risk. The level of risk
that an activity em
bodies really has
nothing to do with
how often people
choose to do it. The
question we ask our-

selves is what we have to gain. We often
already point out to one another that ev
eryone differs in his or her views about
what's worth risking things for — some
risk for love, some for a great job, some
for glory (and, thus, the phrase "each to
his or her own").
But what I hadn't thought as much
about until this past summer — when my
cousin died in a car accident — is how
much we truly are risking in going for our
own versions of "the gold" or just by our
manners of living daily life. What might
we be sacrificing? At Jon's funeral, I saw
more than a thousand people deeply
pained from the loss of a loved one, a
number of whom would be irrevocably
scarred for the rest of their lives. While
we each have our own lives to wield as we

will, is being too risky ever worth the ex
pense it may cause to the happiness of so
many others?
I may be absolutely positive that it's
worth my own effort to participate in some
crazy race across the Patagonian wilder
ness because it will bring me great satisfac
tion. But were I to get seriously injured
(which, of course, is quite possible), would
it be worth the price it could cost my friends
and family — to never get to climb, hike or
play soccer with me again? Should I play
with the possibility that all our futures to
gether could be thus altered?
Now, I know I'm not the only one who
thinks that taking some risks leads us to
the stuff that life is made of. Without these
things that we love, is life as worth living?
This, I'd always contended, is the case —
that worthwhile risks give life substance.
But more recently, I've realized that such
decisions are actually not so simple.
Maybe you guys have always considered
all implications of your risks, but I cer
tainly haven't. Weighing tradeoffs, in and
of itself, is a risky process. What I'm think
ing these days is that maybe idealism
shouldn't always outweigh practicality in
the decision-making process. Perhaps I'll
never again recommend overlooking the
happiness of your family or friends for a
bit of glory. Will you?
