## DEATH AND DESTRUCTION An ode to Residential Education 
### 
Whenever people mention the
word "ResEd," I say, "Don't
get me started." This time, I
say, "Allow me to begin."
Perhaps it's overdue. In part, I'm ad
dicted to procrastination. But I shameful
ly admit that I have been a bit intimidated
by the prospect of devoting an entire col
umn to Residential Education. You can't
predict what kind of shenanigans those
sinister hooligans are prepared to pulli
gan. Maybe that's not a word. Maybe
you're a jerk. Maybe my survival in the
past week after insulting the cops like I'm
the king of the earth has given me the
gusto I need to move on to smaller and
worse things. Here goes...
Like the feces of a vegan, I've been
consistent through and through. Not once
have I ever said anything kind about
ResEd. It's not that there's nothing to say
— I mean, Hitler and Satan and Roger
Clemens could probably dig deep for
some obscure compliments for the
biggest waste of space to ever assume the
title "department" — it's just that I don't
really like them. You can call me a com
plainer if you want, but I'm a reasonable
person with a natural revulsion to abuses
of undeserved authority.
Who are these jokers and what do they
do besides pack stuff up and take it away?
Good question, A.J., I'm glad you asked.
Let us look inward. Are you aware
of anything ResEd has done for you
that has justified their continued exis
tence? Can you think of a specific time
in your life when you could have stated
the following: "I am glad that the De
partment of Residential Education is
there for me. I am happier than I would
otherwise be. I wear purple licorice un
derpants?"
I heard all "No!'"s except from Assis
tant Director of Student Management
Augie Galvan. Without ResEd, he'd no
longer be the guy who torments Row staff
like your lecture hall SBD's that you pre
tend weren't from you even though your
classmates know damn well were, yet you
persist in contorting your face as if you
don't enjoy the aroma your own recipe —
which is sooooo untrue.
We might say that one thing ResEd
can implement with nearly non-negative
effect is the freshman dorm activity
dubbed "Crossing the Line." It's a bit
contrived and seems to do less good than
harm, but trust me, crossing the line is the

thing ResEd is best at.
Let's face it. ResEd sucks. I live off-

campus this year, so
they can't do any
thing to me. They
would if they could.
They can't so
they won't.
About a year
ago, it began. The
sucking. They are
parasites to our cam
pus livelihood.
We're losing liberty
to liability-candy
coated as concerns

for our well-being, which are as fabricat
ed as those rumors that I have a really, re
ally long... attention span.
Right now, the party scene sits snugly
in its tomb, waiting patiently to be ex
humed by its beloved student body. They
have systematically probated our frater
nities like it's a hobby. Yet, they have no
qualms about being naughty, like threat
ening to end an age-old tradition we
know as Full Moon on the Quad. Over
my dead undergraduate...
Freshmen must drink behind closed
doors. When they wander out stumbling
drunk with the fleet of ajar ambulance
doors awaiting them, ResEd is there, fully
prepared to disguise their passing of the
buck onto foolish youngsters as some
thing that it isn't love. What they love is
the taste of the cake they have. No irk
some responsibility, no financial liability,
no burden of accountability.
Another absurd new policy restricts
the distribution of publications in cam
pus dorms. Silence is violence. Who are
they protecting? Anybody with the abili
ty to read has an equal or greater ability
to not read.
Before the break, they banned Secret
Snowflake. I feel kind of stupid complain
ing about that. Secret Snowflake. It just
doesn't sound tough at all. But why did
they do it? Were they just taunting us? It
seems so unnecessary.
Here're some supplementary quick
ies purely for your pleasure:
No space for specifics, but I remember
when they lied and tried to get me into
trouble, but I hadn't done anything
wrong. When the Ombuds were about to
sit in on a meeting on my behalf, ResEd
defaulted, claiming to be too busy
through the end of the school year to ad

dress the issue, despite having earlier pro
vided numerous dates that I agreed to.
Last year I called an ambulance for an
intoxicated friend. Some community ser
vice obstacle personnel made a cameo
and delighted in serving no purpose but to
meddle. My friend was called in to ResEd
and forced to enroll in alcohol classes. I
won't call ambulances in the future.
In another incident, a residence dean
greeted one of my friends — who was
facing legal issues at the time — at his
dorm room doorway. He introduced
himself as the resident dean and assured
my friend that he was there to help, urged
him to trust him and to feel free to say
anything. My friend was later shocked to
learn of a Judicial Affairs case mounting
against him. A report had been filed that
regurgitated much of what he entrusted
to that despicable dean, complete with a
derogatory description of my friend's
physical appearance. Tact is clearly not
the name of the game.
Recently, a ResEd employee coerced
a member of staff in student housing to re
turn early from Winter Break for a meet
ing. The student intended to keep his job,
so he dropped some benjamins on a new
plane ticket only to find that no one else
was forced to show. That ResEd employ
ee refused to rectify the situation. The of
fice claims he's being reprimanded, but
my skepticism goes without saying.
So what's their motivation for being
so wicked?
A visit to the Web site may enlighten
us. Director of Residential Education
Jane Camarillo says, "I think in terms of
pluralistic communities, we are the first
line of intervention with students to inoc
ulate them into the idea that they are
members of a global community."
Oh, I get it —create pluralistic commu
nities through draconian measures, need
lessly eliminating social outlets and refusing
to provide adequate alternatives. Seems to
be working, Jane, because students all
across campus are vehemently united in
their outrage over your department's
countless displays of utter disrespect.
If George W. Bush is looking to
squeeze in another regime change before
he's de-elected in the fall, I know of a
good place to start.
