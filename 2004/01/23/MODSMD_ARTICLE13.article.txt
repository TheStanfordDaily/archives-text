# THE 						BIG PICTURE
## U.N. needs to go back to school 
### 
Take a walk down Mayfield and
you'll find Casa Italiana on the
comer. Keep going and you'll
pass la Maison Francaise, Haus
Mitteleuropa and Slavdom. Perhaps re
flecting this international legacy, Kofi
Annan, the United Nations Secretary-
General, recently selected one of our own,
Political Science Prof. Stephen Stedman,
to help develop suggestions for a much
needed revamping of the United Nations.
They could probably use a few pointers.
First and foremost, the United Na
tions must return to its roots. While most
of the historical hype surrounds Article
2(4), which forbids the "threat or use of
force" in international relations," the
true heart of the world body lies with Ar
ticle 1(4): *'to be a center for harmoniz
ing the actions of nations." As an open
forum for nations to meet and discuss,
the United Nations achieves an essential
condition for peace: An international
consciousness that "outlaws" ignorance
of the world's problems and the nations'
responses. While meetings and discus
sion may not prevent conflict, they do
coordinate global reaction and a new
charter will emphasize the United Na
tions' best weapon: the moral authority
of 191 nations acting together.
And it's authority the United Nations
needs. The U.S.-led war against Saddam
Hussein reminds the world that Iraq re
mained in breech of U.N. mandates for
weapons inspections for five years with
out response. Without consistency, the
United Nations will continue to fade. A

new charter should require member
states to respond immediately to viola-

tions of laws they
themselves created.
The old U.N.
charter was written
with Germany's
1939 invasion of
Poland in mind.
State sovereignty be
came the basis of in
ternational relations.
But recent history
has been such that
rulers and borders
are hardly absolute

and in response, peacekeeping—a no
tion completely absent from the original
charter—became the United Nations'
most vital and effective vocation. The new
United Nations must define and direct the
future of peacekeeping: How and when
it's appropriate, and according to what
guidelines it is carried out.
To go a step further, "pre-emptive
peacekeeping" should take a more cen
tral role. The aims of peace are better
served by addressing those sources of
conflict identified by former Secretary
General Boutros-Boutros Ghali's
Agenda for Peace: "poverty, disease,
famine, oppression and despair." The
new United Nations can effect positive
change only by focusing the world's at
tention before the fact instead of lamely
responding when decisions have already
been made.
One of the United Nation's greatest

decision makers was one of its first Secre
tary Generals: Dag Hammarskjold.
Quoting Danish philosopher Soren
Kirkigaard, he spoke to the heart of the
task facing Stedman and Annan's team:
"To succeed is to realize what is possible."
Instead of allowing unilateralism to
ruin its faith in collective security, the
United Nations can incorporate the prac
tice of "subcontracting." While today's
United Nations makes every conflict a
question of global concern, the more vi
able United Nations of the future will
allow regional actors to address regional
problems, with U.N. sanctions. Making
those sanctions easier to obtain will facil
itate the return of the more stubborn na
tions — notably the United States — to
the negotiating table and return the
moral authority where it belongs.
Most importantly, the United Na
tions must recognize what doesn't be
long. The U.N. system and the U.N. char
ter are essentially etched in stone — re
quiring nearly impossible levels of con
sensus for change. While this casts a long
shadow over the potential of Annan's ef
fort, if a new charter could be inked and
agreed to, it must accept what every Stan
ford student from the French house to
the frat house already knows: You can't
predict the future. Whether it's the next
math test or addressing armed conflict in
the world, flexibility reigns because it's
prepared for anything.
