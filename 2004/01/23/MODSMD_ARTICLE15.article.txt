Calabasas students should
have reported on Rose

Contrary to what Patrick Matti
more maintains in his Op-Ed earlier this
week ("A lesson in journalistic integri
ty," Jan. 20), the students at Calabasas
High School should have reported the
Pete Rose story when it landed in then
laps. But they were young; their mistake
is understandable. I didn't have the
world's best news sense as high schooler
either (where was their adviser?). But
Mattimore's defense is pretty
damnable.
He actually praises the journalism
class for declining to publish the story
because Rose appeared as a favor to a
student's father. "In other words," Mat
timore says, "the newspaper made a
conscious decision to bury a really big
story for ethical reasons." In fact, the op
posite is the case: The newspaper decid
ed to bury the story because its target
was well-connected. That seems decid
edly unethical to me. This, after all, is a
profession that presumes to serve its
readers — not its sources (even when

they're nice to reporters) or its re
porters' families.
Moreover, Mattimore has the gall
to suggest the case "should be required
reading at every journalism school in
this country," as if the students had done
something exemplary. He suggests, im
periously, that, for the sake of posterity,
it doesn't matter whether Rose lied for
13 or 14 years, and therefore it doesn't
matter if the world had to wait another
year to hear the admission from Rose's
own mouth. He may or may not be right,
but that's not the Calabasas kids' call to
make. Journalists don't have the luxury
of deciding when people should hear
what. Their charge is to report the news
if and when they discover it, not to bury
it as a favor to friends.

I read Patrick Mattimore's letter
with interest and a little despair ("A les
son in journalistic integrity," Jan. 20).
While he applauds the'high school jour
nalists for their "integrity," I sigh over

their lack of enterprise.
Sitting on a story "out of respect?"
It sounds like an excuse to me.
The conflict of interest Mattimore's
cites is a reality of journalism. Often, we
have to make hard news decisions. The
students took the easy way out.
They could have verified the "slip of
the tongue" by asking follow-up ques
tions. They could have contacted the
staff member's father and told him of
their decision to run the story. They
could have even interviewed him and
quoted his reactions. Those are ethical
strategies that we teach.

Daily edit on State of
Union address 'half-baked'

Did Nancy Pelosi and Tom Daschle
write The Daily's Thursday editorial
criticizing President George W. Bush's
State of the Union address? It sounded
a lot like their so-called response to the
State of the Union.
The editorial is just another exam
ple of half-baked and disregarded theo
ries, factual inconsistencies and a lack of
adequate research that has character
ized The Daily editorial staff over the
last couple of years. Key facts and wide
ly-accepted theories indicate that the
Daily editorial staff is once again just
mimicking the liberal manifesto, with
out providing any original thought.
How disappointing.
In asking how the president propos
es to finance making the recently passed
tax cuts permanent, The Daily ignores
the fact that revenues have increased al
most every time the federal government
has cut taxes. Economists, including
some at Stanford who are only a short
walk from the Daily offices, will tell you
that reducing tax rates generally in
creases the tax base by a greater per
centage than the rate reduction. This so
called "dynamic modeling" is frequent
ly ignored by liberals, who continue to
rely on a static model that went the way
of the dodo about 20 years ago.
The Daily criticized the economic
recovery that recently began as a jobless
recovery. While largely true to date,
those same economists that The Daily

ignored about tax cuts would also tell
you that unemployment is a lagging in
dicator of economic recovery. Since the
recovery has only begun in earnest in
the last two to three quarters, a recovery
in the job market should not be expect
ed yet. That being said, unemployment
rates have already begun to decline.
The Daily criticized the president
for the "downturn in U.S. relations with
most of the world." I guess the rest of the
world does not include the 40-plus coun
tries who are directly or indirectly sup
porting U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan
and Iraq. Instead, The Daily would have
you believe that it is composed the so
cialist regimes of France, Germany and
Russia and the despotic nations of the
Middle East, Asia and Africa. The for
mer three are obstructing efforts in Iraq
because they loaned several billion dol
lars to the deposed government of Sad
dam Hussein and company. The latter
countries are a large part of a United
Nations that has become nothing more
than a wholly ineffective debating soci
ety when it comes to tackling tough is
sues of terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction. Kudos to President Bush
for giving the United Nations an oppor
tunity to change its ways but then mov
ing on. A1 Gore would probably still be
debating there, seeking a consensus that
will never come.
I share The Daily's concern over the
budget. I wish the president had sent
Congress a budget with less than four
percent growth in spending in each of his
previous years. However, with tax-and
spend Democrats occupying nearly half
of the seats in the House and Senate,
perhaps this was a compromise he had to
make to avoid making any progress.
Finally, The Daily and its readers, in
evaluating the State of the Union,
should recall that the presidential oath
of office calls on the president to "pre
serve, protect and defend the Constitu
tion of the United States." After eight
years of policies of appeasement that
created the crises in Afghanistan, Iraq
and the nuclear nightmare of North
Korea, it is entirely refreshing to have a
president who understands his primary
responsibility and seeks to fulfill it.

timore says, "the newspaper made a
conscious decision to bury a really big
story for ethical reasons." In fact, the op
posite is the case: The newspaper decid
ed to bury the story because its target
was well-connected. That seems decid
edly unethical to me. This, after all, is a
profession that presumes to serve its
readers — not its sources (even when

they're nice to reporters) or its re
porters' families.
Moreover, Mattimore has the gall
to suggest the case "should be required
reading at every journalism school in
this country," as if the students had done
something exemplary. He suggests, im
periously, that, for the sake of posterity,
it doesn't matter whether Rose lied for
13 or 14 years, and therefore it doesn't
matter if the world had to wait another
year to hear the admission from Rose's
own mouth. He may or may not be right,
but that's not the Calabasas kids' call to
make. Journalists don't have the luxury
of deciding when people should hear
what. Their charge is to report the news
if and when they discover it, not to bury
it as a favor to friends.

I read Patrick Mattimore's letter
with interest and a little despair ("A les
son in journalistic integrity," Jan. 20).
While he applauds the'high school jour
nalists for their "integrity," I sigh over

their lack of enterprise.
Sitting on a story "out of respect?"
It sounds like an excuse to me.
The conflict of interest Mattimore's
cites is a reality of journalism. Often, we
have to make hard news decisions. The
students took the easy way out.
They could have verified the "slip of
the tongue" by asking follow-up ques
tions. They could have contacted the
staff member's father and told him of
their decision to run the story. They
could have even interviewed him and
quoted his reactions. Those are ethical
strategies that we teach.

Daily edit on State of
Union address 'half-baked'

Did Nancy Pelosi and Tom Daschle
write The Daily's Thursday editorial
criticizing President George W. Bush's
State of the Union address? It sounded
a lot like their so-called response to the
State of the Union.
The editorial is just another exam
ple of half-baked and disregarded theo
ries, factual inconsistencies and a lack of
adequate research that has character
ized The Daily editorial staff over the
last couple of years. Key facts and wide
ly-accepted theories indicate that the
Daily editorial staff is once again just
mimicking the liberal manifesto, with
out providing any original thought.
How disappointing.
In asking how the president propos
es to finance making the recently passed
tax cuts permanent, The Daily ignores
the fact that revenues have increased al
most every time the federal government
has cut taxes. Economists, including
some at Stanford who are only a short
walk from the Daily offices, will tell you
that reducing tax rates generally in
creases the tax base by a greater per
centage than the rate reduction. This so
called "dynamic modeling" is frequent
ly ignored by liberals, who continue to
rely on a static model that went the way
of the dodo about 20 years ago.
The Daily criticized the economic
recovery that recently began as a jobless
recovery. While largely true to date,
those same economists that The Daily

ignored about tax cuts would also tell
you that unemployment is a lagging in
dicator of economic recovery. Since the
recovery has only begun in earnest in
the last two to three quarters, a recovery
in the job market should not be expect
ed yet. That being said, unemployment
rates have already begun to decline.
The Daily criticized the president
for the "downturn in U.S. relations with
most of the world." I guess the rest of the
world does not include the 40-plus coun
tries who are directly or indirectly sup
porting U.S.-led efforts in Afghanistan
and Iraq. Instead, The Daily would have
you believe that it is composed the so
cialist regimes of France, Germany and
Russia and the despotic nations of the
Middle East, Asia and Africa. The for
mer three are obstructing efforts in Iraq
because they loaned several billion dol
lars to the deposed government of Sad
dam Hussein and company. The latter
countries are a large part of a United
Nations that has become nothing more
than a wholly ineffective debating soci
ety when it comes to tackling tough is
sues of terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction. Kudos to President Bush
for giving the United Nations an oppor
tunity to change its ways but then mov
ing on. A1 Gore would probably still be
debating there, seeking a consensus that
will never come.
I share The Daily's concern over the
budget. I wish the president had sent
Congress a budget with less than four
percent growth in spending in each of his
previous years. However, with tax-and
spend Democrats occupying nearly half
of the seats in the House and Senate,
perhaps this was a compromise he had to
make to avoid making any progress.
Finally, The Daily and its readers, in
evaluating the State of the Union,
should recall that the presidential oath
of office calls on the president to "pre
serve, protect and defend the Constitu
tion of the United States." After eight
years of policies of appeasement that
created the crises in Afghanistan, Iraq
and the nuclear nightmare of North
Korea, it is entirely refreshing to have a
president who understands his primary
responsibility and seeks to fulfill it.

Calabasas students should
have reported on Rose

Contrary to what Patrick Matti
more maintains in his Op-Ed earlier this
week ("A lesson in journalistic integri
ty," Jan. 20), the students at Calabasas
High School should have reported the
Pete Rose story when it landed in then
laps. But they were young; their mistake
is understandable. I didn't have the
world's best news sense as high schooler
either (where was their adviser?). But
Mattimore's defense is pretty
damnable.
He actually praises the journalism
class for declining to publish the story
because Rose appeared as a favor to a
student's father. "In other words," Mat
timore says, "the newspaper made a
conscious decision to bury a really big
story for ethical reasons." In fact, the op
