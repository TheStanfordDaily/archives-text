## Seeking Mid-East peace 
### ROBERT ZELNICK 
Those who have consistently sup
ported Israel, but not "Greater Is
rael," could be excused for experienc
ing a sense of vindication as one right
of-center Israeli leader after another
has urged unilateral Israeli with
drawals from the West Bank or Gaza
Strip, at least from those settlements
that are most difficult to justify or de
fend. The Likud's Yuval Steinitz,
head of the Knesset Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, has called
for a pullback from the Gaza Strip,
leaving the Palestinians to form their
state there. Ehud Olmert, mayor of
Jerusalem and a likely future candi
date for prime minister, wants to
abandon both Gaza and the more re
mote West Bank settlements. Others
urge partial withdrawal as long as Is
rael annexes the remaining land — a
formula that reportedly carries the
blessing of Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon.
Why the change in thinking among
Israeli hard-liners? Surely one reason
is the cost of the eroding but still trou
blesome Intifada. Another is the de
mographic threat of a Palestinian
population that may one day reject a
two-state solution and urge instead
majority rule in a single political enti
ty. Finally, the Israelis don't trust
Palestinian negotiators. With or with
out Arafat, they want no Oslo redux.
Defensible borders, they say, are
more important than negotiated bor
ders; and, particularly with the era
sure of the Iraqi threat from the east,
Israel's borders have never been more
defensible.
But a closer analysis suggests that
the advantages of a partial withdrawal
are modest and the downsides, great.
Palestinian extremists would treat a
pullback as a great victory — a vindi
cation for their strategy of terror. They
would seize the abandoned land and
continue their jihad against the Jewish
state. And their effort would be rein
forced because no one, not even the
United States, would recognize new,

unilaterally declared borders. World
opinion would hold the action illegal
and provocative. And this time, world
opinion would be right.
Moreover, the terms Israel could
achieve at the negotiating table are
nothing to sneer at. From Camp
David through Taba to Geneva,
every serious plan has contained pro
visions establishing an international
peacekeeping force. Every one has
provided for a demilitarized Pales
tinian state. Every one has forbidden
the Palestinians to enter alliances
hostile to Israel. Every one has al
lowed a continuing Israeli security
presence on Palestinian soil and the
right of Israeli military planes to con
duct exercises in Palestinian air
space. And every one has demanded
the renunciation of all claims not part
of the negotiated deal — by far the
best way to extinguish the Palestinian
"right of return" to villages inside Is
raeli territory.
In diplomacy as in war, timing is ev
erything. The moment is approaching
when negotiations with the Palestini
ans will be less a reward for terrorism
than a way for Israel to consolidate po
litical gains. Outside the Jerusalem
suburbs, which Israel would annex, the
settlements are monuments to the fa
naticism of the few compounded by
the political cowardice of the many.
They should revert to the Palestinians
as part of a negotiated peace. But with
drawing from them unilaterally makes
no more sense than building them in
the first place.
