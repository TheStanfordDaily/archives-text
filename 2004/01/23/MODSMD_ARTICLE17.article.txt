## Julie talks stereotypes and off-beat dancing 
### 
It seems last week's column caused
some confusion. So, let me make
things clear. I do not hate the cross
country team, I hate George Bush.
Although at times there's a thin line be
tween hatred and bewildered pity, and I've
said... I don't know, a million times, that
cross-country runners work their asses off
the hardest and have the least fun. Harder
than synchro, wrestling and football, but
minus the makeup, spandex singlets and
legions of groupies. So if bewildered admi
ration opposes bewildered pity, then I ac
tually love runners.
Tliey still have it rough, though. The
fastest kid in my junior high, Patrick, also

talked through his
nose and had a ran
dom habit of biting
people. Fastest run
ner, last guy you
want asking you to
dance to "End of
the Road." So I told
him my feet hurt.
Then again, dancing
with anyone during
the adolescent dis-

covery of the freak dance was dangerous
for any girl not wanting to get poked by
random boners.
Dancing. It's freshman year, and
every unfortunate campus party I attend
(yes freshmen, there at least used to be
parties every weekend at Stanford) the
same pretty good-looking black football
player who shall remain anonymous, gen
erally known freshman year for categori
cally dancing with off-beat white girls at
all campus parties (and not even the cute
white girls) was dancing with off-beat
ugly white girls. Never on-beat girls,
never cute girls, never black girls, never
on-beat cute black girls.
Let me be clear: Some people trip off
the black athlete-white girl phe
nomenon, and on one hand you can say
to each his own, and on the other hand
there is really a socio-racial phe
nomenon going on that should be open
to inquiry and discussion (i.e. why aren't
white guys dating black girls? They're
dating Asian girls. And so forth). And
either approach you take, it's okay to
have questions or not understand things
or express your opinions.
Here I will state my opinion as an ex
ample: People shouldn't be judged for
dancing with each other regardless of race,
gender or religious beliefs, but I still think
off-beat people shouldn't dance at all, and
it's okay to laugh at them.
Yah, I said it. Although I would like
that last comment to dig me a separate
hole, as I attempt to fill in the hole I dug
myself last week.
"Race." "Black." Too many people
float around this campus uncomfortably
not knowing how to refer to a black per
son, mumbling "African-American" even
if they're talking about Bob Marley. He
was Jamaican, guys.
This is what I have to say: It's one thing
to tell an athlete (any race) by his Nike
sponsored warm-ups. Warm-ups, athlete.
That's like telling a Pi Phi from her Uggs
boots, miniskirt and coke addiction. What!
But it is quite another thing to assume
that a tall, muscular black male walking
around Stanford must be an athlete. Be
cause along with any "trend" comes
stereotyping. Trend: A lot of athletes in
football / basketball are black, or a num
ber of black athletes date white girls.
Stereotype: The assumption that any
black athlete dating a white girl must be
doing it because he doesn't like black girls.
This is errant logic, in fact it's not even
logic, but none of us at Stanford are inno
cent to stereotyping of some sort, and I in
clude myself in the criticism. In the case of
assuming an athletic black guy at Stanford
is an athlete, the cognition essentially says
that the only place for a black male at Stan
ford is as an athlete, and this is both limit
ing and dangerous.
Slightly more innocuous example: I
see an extraordinarily tall girl in a pony
tail and assume she plays volleyball or
basketball.
The assumption, which happens quite
quickly and automatically, effectively
says that the only place for a tall girl here
is as an athlete. Although admittedly,
who's really concerned about tall girl dis
crimination.
We do not live in a politically correct
bubble. Just look at the Stanford Review.
But we are here for a few years in a place
conveniently set up to ask questions and
have discussions and learn a little.
Like, why would anyone get up in the
morning to do crew? Who does the make
up on the synchro swimmers? How come
wrestlers can starve and binge, but it's not
okay for my roommate to? And so forth.

You can reach Julie Ruvolo at julieo
lo@stanford.edu. And she thinks every
one should be free to dance, because
who really says what is on and offbeat
anyway. Besides the music, that is.
