# Cardinal extends win streak to 15
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All of UCLA's players managed to find
their way to Maples Pavilion last night, but
they looked completely lost once they got
on the court.
The Cardinal used stifling help-side de
fense and crisp offense to build a 24-point
first-half lead en route to a convincing 67-
52 victory over the Pacific-10 Conference's
second-place team. The win extended Stan
ford's record to 15-0 (6-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) while UCLA dropped to 9-5 (5-2).
The rattled Bruins kept calling timeouts
during the Cardinal's 31-7 first-half run, but
to no avail. Looking confused and disorga
nized against Stanford's disciplined zone
defense, UCLA generated just 21 points in
the half.
Their frustration carried over onto the
defensive end, where the Cardinal's superi
or execution made them pay almost every
time they got out of position.
"I thought we were pretty good once we
got rolling there in the first half and got
some momentum," Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery said.
Josh Childress used his quickness to
open seams in the Bruin defense, and when
UCLA moved to shut him down, Justin
Davis took advantage. Looking better and
more poised than any of UCLA's big men,
Davis hit his first nine shots en route to a
21-point, five-rebound outing in 26 minutes
of play. Childress had 14 points, six re
bounds, three assists, two blocks and two
steals in his first start of the season.
"We were beaten today by a vastly su
perior team in every aspect of the game,
and the most evident was just how much
stronger they are physically," UCLA head
coach Ben Howland said. "They're a very
disciplined team, a very unselfish team. It's
a very good team that's very deserving of
their national ranking."
In the second half, the Cardinal de
fended their lead by slowing the pace of its
half-court offense and coming down with
offensive rebounds to maintain posses
sion. When Montgomery inserted a lineup
full of substitutes five minutes into the
half, the Bruins promptly pulled within 13.
But shortly after Chris Hernandez re-en
tered for Jason Haas, he sank an open
three-pointer to squelch the UCLA run,
and the Bruins didn't seriously challenge
again.
Aside from some smooth stop-and
pop baskets by 6-foot-7 wing Dijon

Thompson, UCLA's offensive woes con
tinued in the second half as they failed to
solve Stanford's zone. Thompson fin
ished the game as the only Bruin in dou
ble figures with 15 points.
Whereas 21 of Stanford's 27 field goals
resulted from assists, UCLA finished the
game with just nine assists after struggling
to find passing lanes all night. The Cardinal
also won the rebounding battle 36-25.
Fittingly, it was with an offensive re
bound that Stanford sealed the deal in the
fourth quarter, as Nick Robinson hauled in
an errant Hernandez three-pointer and the
Cardinal reset their offense with two min
utes remaining. Lottich drained a three on
the possession to move the lead to 65-50 as
the crowd rose to its feet.
The early 5:30 p.m. start time didn't
seem to bother the Sixth Man Club, which
filled its upper-level section to the rafters
and cheered thunderously in response to
three pointers and alley-oop dunks. The
most impressive came in the second half
when Childress made eye contact with Rob
Little, slipped behind Bruin Trevor Ariza
and rose high above everyone else just in
time to slam Little's deft lob pass through
the hoop.
Locked down and worn out, UCLA's
offense had no response. During a time
out, the Sixth Man Club chanted, "Lavin's
better," in reference to Howland's slick
haired predecessor.
Despite appearances, Howland said his
team wasn't caught off-guard by Stan
ford's zone.
"They've been using that zone a lot at
home in particular," he said. "We didn't
know how to do a good job attacking the zone
on Saturday [against Arizona], so I'm not sur
prised that they used that a lot today. "
Montgomery wasn't particularly
pleased by his team's performance in the
second half, and he emphasized that there
is plenty of room for improvement despite
the still-perfect record and two-game con
ference lead.
"In the second half I thought UCLA be
came the aggressor ... and the shooting
percentages kind of reversed themselves,"
Montgomery said.
He pointed to decision-making and of
fensive execution as targets for improve
ment as the Cardinal defend their unbeaten
record at home against Southern California
tomorrow. The Trojans lost 63-62 to Cali
fornia last night in Berkeley to fall to 8-8 (3-
4), but they are the only Pac-10 team other
than Stanford to beat Arizona this year.
