# Women face Arizona at Burnham
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After losing to No. 17 Arizona State last
weekend, the No. 14 Stanford women's gym
nastics team (3-1) is fired up to hunt down some
Wildcats tonight as the squad takes on No. 6
Arizona (4-0) at home in Burnham Pavilion.
Sophomore Natalie Foley will help lead
the charge on all four events. In both of the
Cardinal's meets this season, Foley placed sec
ond in the All-Around and was a top competi
tor on vault, bars, beam and floor, never scor
ing less than a 9.8.
Earning seventh place in the All-Around at
NCAA Nationals and All-American honors
on vault, uneven bars and the All-Around as a
freshman last year, Foley is a fierce competi
tor. She competes some of the highest-level
tumbling on the team and is training the team's
most difficult vault — a full-and-a-half twist
ing Yerchenko.
Foley said she learned mental toughness
at an early age with the help of her father,
Steve Foley, who played 12 years for the Den
ver Broncos and still holds the team's inter
ception record.
Beneath Natalie Foley's competitive edge
and aggressive athleticism, however, lies a
quiet faith that motivates her gymnastics.
"God has given me the talent and ability to
do gymnastics," Foley said. "I try to perform to
the best of my ability to glorify God with the
talent He has given me."
Foley is a dedicated Christian who is in
volved in faith groups on campus like Corner
stone and Cardinal Life. She often psyches
herself up for meets by reading from the Bible.
"I really like [the passage] Philippians 4:13
and sometimes I say it before competing,"
Foley said. '"I can do all things through Christ
who strengthens me.'"
When she feels distracted in an arena full of
cheering fans and sharp-eyed judges, Foley
thinks to herself, "Audience of One."
"When I say that to myself I immediately
get a smile on my face and feel calmness in
side," Foley said. "I say, 'God this is for you,'
and no matter what happens, the routine is just
for God."
The judges are watching too, however, and
one of Foley's goals this year is to keep them
from deducting any points from her routine.
After scoring two 9.9's in last weekend's meet,
Foley is in the hunt to score a perfect 10.
At last year's meet against Arizona, Foley
came close with a career high of 9.975 on the
uneven bars. That score ties her with senior
teammate Caroline Fluhrer for the second

best performance on bars in Stanford gymnas
tics history.
Foley's performance on bars helped the
Cardinal edge out Arizona by 0.1 at last year's
meet and she is determined to see the team win
again tonight.
"I was so mad we lost to ASU last week
end," Foley said. "I don't want to see that hap
pen again this weekend. We can do it if we all
compete well."
Arizona was ranked No. 17 in the presea
son poll, well behind Stanford's best preseason
ranking ever at No. 6. But after defeating No.

10 UCLA, the reigning national champion, the
Wildcats climbed the ranks to tie with Iowa at
the No. 6 spot. Meanwhile, Stanford slipped to
No. 14 after its 195.825-195.5 loss to the Sun
Devils last weekend.
"Arizona is going to be a great team," said
Stanford head coach Kristen Smyth. "They're
coming off a win against UCLA and they're
very strong on vault."
Arizona is ranked No. 2 in the nation on
vault after posting a 49.4 in their meet against
UCLA. Although the Cardinal has only man
aged an average team score of 48.6375 on vault

this season, the gymnasts plan to boost the dif
ficulty of their vaults tonight so that five out of
six vaults start from a 10.0.
Stanford gymnasts, including Foley with a
9.9, had stellar performances on vault against
the Wildcats last year, taking the top five
scores on the event.
Tonight's meet will also have a show
down for the Ail-Around title. Foley's sea
son's best of 39.425 has been matched by se
nior teammate Lise Leveille, and Arizona's
junior Monica Bisordi who is ranked 18th in
the Ail-Around.

six vaults start from a 10.0.
Stanford gymnasts, including Foley with a
9.9, had stellar performances on vault against
the Wildcats last year, taking the top five
scores on the event.
Tonight's meet will also have a show
down for the Ail-Around title. Foley's sea
son's best of 39.425 has been matched by se
nior teammate Lise Leveille, and Arizona's
junior Monica Bisordi who is ranked 18th in
the Ail-Around.

Sophomore Natalie Foley has been leading the way for the Cardinal this year. Foley and the women's gymnastics squad face No. 6
Arizona tonight at home.
After losing to No. 17 Arizona State last
weekend, the No. 14 Stanford women's gym
nastics team (3-1) is fired up to hunt down some
Wildcats tonight as the squad takes on No. 6
Arizona (4-0) at home in Burnham Pavilion.
Sophomore Natalie Foley will help lead
the charge on all four events. In both of the
Cardinal's meets this season, Foley placed sec
ond in the All-Around and was a top competi
tor on vault, bars, beam and floor, never scor
ing less than a 9.8.
Earning seventh place in the All-Around at
NCAA Nationals and All-American honors
on vault, uneven bars and the All-Around as a
freshman last year, Foley is a fierce competi
tor. She competes some of the highest-level
tumbling on the team and is training the team's
most difficult vault — a full-and-a-half twist
ing Yerchenko.
Foley said she learned mental toughness
at an early age with the help of her father,
Steve Foley, who played 12 years for the Den
ver Broncos and still holds the team's inter
ception record.
Beneath Natalie Foley's competitive edge
and aggressive athleticism, however, lies a
quiet faith that motivates her gymnastics.
"God has given me the talent and ability to
do gymnastics," Foley said. "I try to perform to
the best of my ability to glorify God with the
talent He has given me."
Foley is a dedicated Christian who is in
volved in faith groups on campus like Corner
stone and Cardinal Life. She often psyches
herself up for meets by reading from the Bible.
"I really like [the passage] Philippians 4:13
and sometimes I say it before competing,"
Foley said. '"I can do all things through Christ
who strengthens me.'"
When she feels distracted in an arena full of
cheering fans and sharp-eyed judges, Foley
thinks to herself, "Audience of One."
"When I say that to myself I immediately
get a smile on my face and feel calmness in
side," Foley said. "I say, 'God this is for you,'
and no matter what happens, the routine is just
for God."
The judges are watching too, however, and
one of Foley's goals this year is to keep them
from deducting any points from her routine.
After scoring two 9.9's in last weekend's meet,
Foley is in the hunt to score a perfect 10.
At last year's meet against Arizona, Foley
came close with a career high of 9.975 on the
uneven bars. That score ties her with senior
teammate Caroline Fluhrer for the second

best performance on bars in Stanford gymnas
tics history.
Foley's performance on bars helped the
Cardinal edge out Arizona by 0.1 at last year's
meet and she is determined to see the team win
again tonight.
"I was so mad we lost to ASU last week
end," Foley said. "I don't want to see that hap
pen again this weekend. We can do it if we all
compete well."
Arizona was ranked No. 17 in the presea
son poll, well behind Stanford's best preseason
ranking ever at No. 6. But after defeating No.

10 UCLA, the reigning national champion, the
Wildcats climbed the ranks to tie with Iowa at
the No. 6 spot. Meanwhile, Stanford slipped to
No. 14 after its 195.825-195.5 loss to the Sun
Devils last weekend.
"Arizona is going to be a great team," said
Stanford head coach Kristen Smyth. "They're
coming off a win against UCLA and they're
very strong on vault."
Arizona is ranked No. 2 in the nation on
vault after posting a 49.4 in their meet against
UCLA. Although the Cardinal has only man
aged an average team score of 48.6375 on vault

this season, the gymnasts plan to boost the dif
ficulty of their vaults tonight so that five out of
six vaults start from a 10.0.
