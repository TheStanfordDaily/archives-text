# Native Americans at Stanford
## BUILD COMMUNITY 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
When Sandy Kjono stepped
into the Stanford bubble as a
freshman, she felt like she'd
been through it all before — the
feeling of being slightly disjoint
ed from other people, no one re
ally understanding the commu
nity she was from. This time,
though, she had others standing
there with her — other students
she could relate to and bond with
over similar experiences.
For Kjono and many other
Native American students, com
ing to Stanford means finding a
sense of community for the first
time outside of their own tribe. It
means finding people like them
selves, who have dealt with the
misconceptions of people who
are not Native American.
"Going to public schools in
the states kind of sucked because
nobody understood and there
was nobody to talk about any
thing with," Kjono said. "So
being here, even though I've
never met any other Mohawks,
it's kind of nice to feel a little bit
more comfortable that you can
otherwise. I feel comfortable
outside the reservation, but it's
just cool to be with people you
can relate to."
A diverse, but strong,
community
The Stanford American Indi
an Organization (SAIO) and the
groups it encompasses have per
formed the incredible feat of cre
ating a strong community for the

diverse group of students at
Stanford who identify them
selves as Native American.
Moreover, they have done great
things — last November, the
Stanford American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society
was named "Chapter of the
Year" at the Annual National
AISES Conference.
But while the Native Ameri
can students at Stanford have,
for the most part, a solid under
standing of one another — de
spite their tribal differences —
the community has not entirely
connected with the rest of Stan
ford. The feeling of living in a
bubble that many Stanford stu
dents experience is doubly felt
by Native students who, in Stan
ford's microcosm of diversity
and awareness, still deal with a
lack of understanding from their
peers.
About 3 percent of Stanford
students identify themselves as
Native American — a category
which includes American Indi
ans, Alaskan Natives and Native
Hawaiians. Among the students
who call themselves Native
American, there are over 70 dif
ferent tribes represented.
"The Native community is re
ally 'international' in every
sense of the word," said Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian
Program. "Just think about the
size of the United States and that
there are far more than 500 Indi
an nations here — as different
culturally, linguistically, reli-
