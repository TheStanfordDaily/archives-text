# Native Americans at Stanford
## BUILD COMMUNITY 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
When Sandy Kjono stepped
into the Stanford bubble as a
freshman, she felt like she'd
been through it all before — the
feeling of being slightly disjoint
ed from other people, no one re
ally understanding the commu
nity she was from. This time,
though, she had others standing
there with her — other students
she could relate to and bond with
over similar experiences.
For Kjono and many other
Native American students, com
ing to Stanford means finding a
sense of community for the first
time outside of their own tribe. It
means finding people like them
selves, who have dealt with the
misconceptions of people who
are not Native American.
"Going to public schools in
the states kind of sucked because
nobody understood and there
was nobody to talk about any
thing with," Kjono said. "So
being here, even though I've
never met any other Mohawks,
it's kind of nice to feel a little bit
more comfortable that you can
otherwise. I feel comfortable
outside the reservation, but it's
just cool to be with people you
can relate to."
A diverse, but strong,
community
The Stanford American Indi
an Organization (SAIO) and the
groups it encompasses have per
formed the incredible feat of cre
ating a strong community for the

diverse group of students at
Stanford who identify them
selves as Native American.
Moreover, they have done great
things — last November, the
Stanford American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society
was named "Chapter of the
Year" at the Annual National
AISES Conference.
But while the Native Ameri
can students at Stanford have,
for the most part, a solid under
standing of one another — de
spite their tribal differences —
the community has not entirely
connected with the rest of Stan
ford. The feeling of living in a
bubble that many Stanford stu
dents experience is doubly felt
by Native students who, in Stan
ford's microcosm of diversity
and awareness, still deal with a
lack of understanding from their
peers.
About 3 percent of Stanford
students identify themselves as
Native American — a category
which includes American Indi
ans, Alaskan Natives and Native
Hawaiians. Among the students
who call themselves Native
American, there are over 70 dif
ferent tribes represented.
"The Native community is re
ally 'international' in every
sense of the word," said Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian
Program. "Just think about the
size of the United States and that
there are far more than 500 Indi
an nations here — as different
culturally, linguistically, reli-
giously and so on as European nations are
from one another."
Though 3 percent may seem like a very
small segment of the population, Stanford
actually has one of the largest populations
of Native students when compared to the
majority of its peer institutions, according
to Assistant Dean of Admission Jarrid
Whitney.
A variety of programs
Though the recruitment of Native
American students does not differ signifi
cantly from the University's overall re
cruitment plan, said Whitney, high-achiev
ing Native American students are encour
aged to apply.
"We certainly reach out to programs
that serve Native students just as we do
with other programs that work with high
achieving students," he said. "When we
travel to a Native American community,
we spend significant time connecting and
talking with elders and educators about the
values of Stanford, in addition to visiting
students at the local high schools."
The Native American community pro
grams, which all fall under the umbrella or
ganization SAIO, are as diverse as the stu
dents involved. They include, among oth
ers, the Dine Club for Navajo students, the
Native American Law Student Association
and a Big and Lil' Sib program.
Sophomore Jackson Brossy, a SAIO co
chair, said he remembers that as a prospec
tive freshman, he was impressed by the
amount of Native American programming.
"I had also gotten into Princeton, and
Princeton's Native community is pretty
much nonexistent — they don't have any
thing nearly as great as we do here," he
said.

Brossy participated in a program called
SNIPS, the Stanford Native Immersion
Program, before his freshman year.
"It makes it easier for a lot of students to
transition from high school to college or
from wherever they're from to the Stanford
setting — they have a sense of community,
a sense of oneness," Brossy added.
Stanford's AISES national title gives
testament to the quality programming. The
group does community outreach through
projects focused on encouraging Native
high school students to go to college and
through tutoring programs for Stanford
students. According to Kjono, the AISES
president, the group is currently trying to
set up a scholarship fund that will help a
student prepare for the MCATs.
The cultural programs available for Na
tive American students may not be surpris
ing, considering Stanford's strong stance
on matters of diversity.
"At Stanford, we believe that a student
body that is both highly qualified and di
verse in terms of culture, class, race, ethnic
ity, background, work and life experiences,
skills and interests is essential to the educa
tional process," Dean of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid Robin Mamlet told The Daily
in April. "This diversity affects the student
body in all of the ways that our students ex
perience the University; as students learn
so much from one another, the range of
perspectives affects learning both in and
out of the classroom."
The Powwow
In promotional materials for Stanford,
there are often images and words of praise
for the largest, most well-known Native
American event here — the Stanford Pow
wow.
Planning the Powwow is an arduous,
year-round undertaking, completely han
dled by students, making it the largest stu
dent-run powwow in the country, with tens
of thousands of participants each spring.
Working on the Powwow committee,

both Kjono and Brossy said, is a daunting
task that, while rewarding, often discour
ages students from getting involved in
other activities.
The Powwow is "just kind of expected to
happen every year," said Kjono, "but it's a
huge, huge responsibility, and we actually
have people not come back after that be
cause it's just so much work that they either
fall behind in their studies or they just hate
life."
Brossy said he would like to see more
support for the event from the University.
"We could definitely use more help
monetarily," he said.
The event costs around $125,000, accord
ing to Grace Bull Tail, a member of the Pow
wow Committee. Forty thousand dollars of
that is used to pay Stanford for the use of fa
cilities, security and other costs. The com
mittee's main source of revenue comes from
vendors, though SAIO provides $10,000 —
one third of SAIO's entire budget. The rest
of the money comes from fundraising.
Money troubles for AISES
This year AISES is also facing tight
monetary constraints, after its funding, ac
cording to Kjono, was cut in half.
"That was kind of a shocker," Kjono
said.
AISES, along with other student techni
cal societies, will have an opportunity to
raise money today with the Opportunity
Job Fair, sponsored by the Stanford School
of Engineering.
Native issues 101
While the student leaders in the Native
community aren't entirely satisfied with
the financial support they've received for
their organizations, they are pleased with
the academic programs on campus perti
nent to Native issues. Stanford offers a
major and minor in Native American Stud
ies. According to the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity Web

site, the major and minor "promote the on
going discussion of how academic knowl
edge about Native Americans relates to the
historical and contemporary experiences
of Native American people and communi
ties."
Additionally, seminar classes are of
fered at the Native American Theme
House, Muwekma-tah-ruk.
"I took a seminar in the house, and it
was pretty cool because I didn't realize how
many Native authors there were," Kjono
said. "So it's kind of eye-opening, and I
think it's helpful when people from other
tribes learn about different tribes."

Despite the academic programs that
Stanford offers and the cultural program
ming the students work on, many people on
campus know very little about the Native
community beyond what goes on at the
Powwow.
"Sometimes people will say we're the
'minority of the minorities,'" Kjono said.
"There a lot of things that people just don't
understand, and a lot of things that have
been made politically correct or incorrect
for other minorities that do not necessarily
apply to Native Americans. I guess that's
kind of our job as a community: to educate
people."

president, the group is currently trying to
set up a scholarship fund that will help a
student prepare for the MCATs.
The cultural programs available for Na
tive American students may not be surpris
ing, considering Stanford's strong stance
on matters of diversity.
"At Stanford, we believe that a student
body that is both highly qualified and di
verse in terms of culture, class, race, ethnic
ity, background, work and life experiences,
skills and interests is essential to the educa
tional process," Dean of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid Robin Mamlet told The Daily
in April. "This diversity affects the student
body in all of the ways that our students ex
perience the University; as students learn
so much from one another, the range of
perspectives affects learning both in and
out of the classroom."
The Powwow
In promotional materials for Stanford,
there are often images and words of praise
for the largest, most well-known Native
American event here — the Stanford Pow
wow.
Planning the Powwow is an arduous,
year-round undertaking, completely han
dled by students, making it the largest stu
dent-run powwow in the country, with tens
of thousands of participants each spring.
Working on the Powwow committee,

both Kjono and Brossy said, is a daunting
task that, while rewarding, often discour
ages students from getting involved in
other activities.
The Powwow is "just kind of expected to
happen every year," said Kjono, "but it's a
huge, huge responsibility, and we actually
have people not come back after that be
cause it's just so much work that they either
fall behind in their studies or they just hate
life."
Brossy said he would like to see more
support for the event from the University.
"We could definitely use more help
monetarily," he said.
The event costs around $125,000, accord
ing to Grace Bull Tail, a member of the Pow
wow Committee. Forty thousand dollars of
that is used to pay Stanford for the use of fa
cilities, security and other costs. The com
mittee's main source of revenue comes from
vendors, though SAIO provides $10,000 —
one third of SAIO's entire budget. The rest
of the money comes from fundraising.
Money troubles for AISES
This year AISES is also facing tight
monetary constraints, after its funding, ac
cording to Kjono, was cut in half.
"That was kind of a shocker," Kjono
said.
AISES, along with other student techni
cal societies, will have an opportunity to
raise money today with the Opportunity
Job Fair, sponsored by the Stanford School
of Engineering.
Native issues 101
While the student leaders in the Native
community aren't entirely satisfied with
the financial support they've received for
their organizations, they are pleased with
the academic programs on campus perti
nent to Native issues. Stanford offers a
major and minor in Native American Stud
ies. According to the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity Web

site, the major and minor "promote the on
going discussion of how academic knowl
edge about Native Americans relates to the
historical and contemporary experiences
of Native American people and communi
ties."
Additionally, seminar classes are of
fered at the Native American Theme
House, Muwekma-tah-ruk.
"I took a seminar in the house, and it
was pretty cool because I didn't realize how
many Native authors there were," Kjono
said. "So it's kind of eye-opening, and I
think it's helpful when people from other
tribes learn about different tribes."

Despite the academic programs that
Stanford offers and the cultural program
ming the students work on, many people on
campus know very little about the Native
community beyond what goes on at the
Powwow.
"Sometimes people will say we're the
'minority of the minorities,'" Kjono said.
"There a lot of things that people just don't
understand, and a lot of things that have
been made politically correct or incorrect
for other minorities that do not necessarily
apply to Native Americans. I guess that's
kind of our job as a community: to educate
people."

The Stanford chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society won "Chapter
of the Year" due to the quality of its programming. The society aims to help undergraduates
interested in science and engineering.
When Sandy Kjono stepped
into the Stanford bubble as a
freshman, she felt like she'd
been through it all before — the
feeling of being slightly disjoint
ed from other people, no one re
ally understanding the commu
nity she was from. This time,
though, she had others standing
there with her — other students
she could relate to and bond with
over similar experiences.
For Kjono and many other
Native American students, com
ing to Stanford means finding a
sense of community for the first
time outside of their own tribe. It
means finding people like them
selves, who have dealt with the
misconceptions of people who
are not Native American.
"Going to public schools in
the states kind of sucked because
nobody understood and there
was nobody to talk about any
thing with," Kjono said. "So
being here, even though I've
never met any other Mohawks,
it's kind of nice to feel a little bit
more comfortable that you can
otherwise. I feel comfortable
outside the reservation, but it's
just cool to be with people you
can relate to."
A diverse, but strong,
community
The Stanford American Indi
an Organization (SAIO) and the
groups it encompasses have per
formed the incredible feat of cre
ating a strong community for the

diverse group of students at
Stanford who identify them
selves as Native American.
Moreover, they have done great
things — last November, the
Stanford American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society
was named "Chapter of the
Year" at the Annual National
AISES Conference.
But while the Native Ameri
can students at Stanford have,
for the most part, a solid under
standing of one another — de
spite their tribal differences —
the community has not entirely
connected with the rest of Stan
ford. The feeling of living in a
bubble that many Stanford stu
dents experience is doubly felt
by Native students who, in Stan
ford's microcosm of diversity
and awareness, still deal with a
lack of understanding from their
peers.
About 3 percent of Stanford
students identify themselves as
Native American — a category
which includes American Indi
ans, Alaskan Natives and Native
Hawaiians. Among the students
who call themselves Native
American, there are over 70 dif
ferent tribes represented.
"The Native community is re
ally 'international' in every
sense of the word," said Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian
Program. "Just think about the
size of the United States and that
there are far more than 500 Indi
an nations here — as different
culturally, linguistically, reli-
giously and so on as European nations are
from one another."
Though 3 percent may seem like a very
small segment of the population, Stanford
actually has one of the largest populations
of Native students when compared to the
majority of its peer institutions, according
to Assistant Dean of Admission Jarrid
Whitney.
A variety of programs
Though the recruitment of Native
American students does not differ signifi
cantly from the University's overall re
cruitment plan, said Whitney, high-achiev
ing Native American students are encour
aged to apply.
"We certainly reach out to programs
that serve Native students just as we do
with other programs that work with high
achieving students," he said. "When we
travel to a Native American community,
we spend significant time connecting and
talking with elders and educators about the
values of Stanford, in addition to visiting
students at the local high schools."
The Native American community pro
grams, which all fall under the umbrella or
ganization SAIO, are as diverse as the stu
dents involved. They include, among oth
ers, the Dine Club for Navajo students, the
Native American Law Student Association
and a Big and Lil' Sib program.
Sophomore Jackson Brossy, a SAIO co
chair, said he remembers that as a prospec
tive freshman, he was impressed by the
amount of Native American programming.
"I had also gotten into Princeton, and
Princeton's Native community is pretty
much nonexistent — they don't have any
thing nearly as great as we do here," he
said.

Brossy participated in a program called
SNIPS, the Stanford Native Immersion
Program, before his freshman year.
"It makes it easier for a lot of students to
transition from high school to college or
from wherever they're from to the Stanford
setting — they have a sense of community,
a sense of oneness," Brossy added.
Stanford's AISES national title gives
testament to the quality programming. The
group does community outreach through
projects focused on encouraging Native
high school students to go to college and
through tutoring programs for Stanford
students. According to Kjono, the AISES
president, the group is currently trying to
set up a scholarship fund that will help a
student prepare for the MCATs.
The cultural programs available for Na
tive American students may not be surpris

For Kjono and many other
Native American students, com
ing to Stanford means finding a
sense of community for the first
time outside of their own tribe. It
means finding people like them
selves, who have dealt with the
misconceptions of people who
are not Native American.
"Going to public schools in
the states kind of sucked because
nobody understood and there
was nobody to talk about any
thing with," Kjono said. "So
being here, even though I've
never met any other Mohawks,
it's kind of nice to feel a little bit
more comfortable that you can
otherwise. I feel comfortable
outside the reservation, but it's
just cool to be with people you
can relate to."
A diverse, but strong,
community
The Stanford American Indi
an Organization (SAIO) and the
groups it encompasses have per
formed the incredible feat of cre
ating a strong community for the

diverse group of students at
Stanford who identify them
selves as Native American.
Moreover, they have done great
things — last November, the
Stanford American Indian Sci
ence and Engineering Society
was named "Chapter of the
Year" at the Annual National
AISES Conference.
But while the Native Ameri
can students at Stanford have,
for the most part, a solid under
standing of one another — de
spite their tribal differences —
the community has not entirely
connected with the rest of Stan
ford. The feeling of living in a
bubble that many Stanford stu
dents experience is doubly felt
by Native students who, in Stan
ford's microcosm of diversity
and awareness, still deal with a
lack of understanding from their
peers.
About 3 percent of Stanford
students identify themselves as
Native American — a category
which includes American Indi
ans, Alaskan Natives and Native
Hawaiians. Among the students
who call themselves Native
American, there are over 70 dif
ferent tribes represented.
"The Native community is re
ally 'international' in every
sense of the word," said Denni
Woodward, assistant director of
the American Indian, Alaska
Native and Native Hawaiian
Program. "Just think about the
size of the United States and that
there are far more than 500 Indi
an nations here — as different
culturally, linguistically, reli-
giously and so on as European nations are
from one another."
Though 3 percent may seem like a very
small segment of the population, Stanford
actually has one of the largest populations
of Native students when compared to the
majority of its peer institutions, according
to Assistant Dean of Admission Jarrid
Whitney.
A variety of programs
Though the recruitment of Native
American students does not differ signifi
cantly from the University's overall re
cruitment plan, said Whitney, high-achiev
ing Native American students are encour
aged to apply.
"We certainly reach out to programs
that serve Native students just as we do
with other programs that work with high
achieving students," he said. "When we
travel to a Native American community,
we spend significant time connecting and
talking with elders and educators about the
values of Stanford, in addition to visiting
students at the local high schools."
The Native American community pro
grams, which all fall under the umbrella or
ganization SAIO, are as diverse as the stu
dents involved. They include, among oth
ers, the Dine Club for Navajo students, the
Native American Law Student Association
and a Big and Lil' Sib program.
Sophomore Jackson Brossy, a SAIO co
chair, said he remembers that as a prospec
tive freshman, he was impressed by the
amount of Native American programming.
"I had also gotten into Princeton, and
Princeton's Native community is pretty
much nonexistent — they don't have any
thing nearly as great as we do here," he
said.

Brossy participated in a program called
SNIPS, the Stanford Native Immersion
Program, before his freshman year.
"It makes it easier for a lot of students to
transition from high school to college or
from wherever they're from to the Stanford
setting — they have a sense of community,
a sense of oneness," Brossy added.
Stanford's AISES national title gives
testament to the quality programming. The
group does community outreach through
projects focused on encouraging Native
high school students to go to college and
through tutoring programs for Stanford
students. According to Kjono, the AISES
president, the group is currently trying to
set up a scholarship fund that will help a
student prepare for the MCATs.
The cultural programs available for Na
tive American students may not be surpris
ing, considering Stanford's strong stance
on matters of diversity.
"At Stanford, we believe that a student
body that is both highly qualified and di
verse in terms of culture, class, race, ethnic
ity, background, work and life experiences,
skills and interests is essential to the educa
tional process," Dean of Admission and Fi
nancial Aid Robin Mamlet told The Daily
in April. "This diversity affects the student
body in all of the ways that our students ex
perience the University; as students learn
so much from one another, the range of
perspectives affects learning both in and
out of the classroom."
The Powwow
In promotional materials for Stanford,
there are often images and words of praise
for the largest, most well-known Native
American event here — the Stanford Pow
wow.
Planning the Powwow is an arduous,
year-round undertaking, completely han
dled by students, making it the largest stu
dent-run powwow in the country, with tens
of thousands of participants each spring.
Working on the Powwow committee,

both Kjono and Brossy said, is a daunting
task that, while rewarding, often discour
ages students from getting involved in
other activities.
The Powwow is "just kind of expected to
happen every year," said Kjono, "but it's a
huge, huge responsibility, and we actually
have people not come back after that be
cause it's just so much work that they either
fall behind in their studies or they just hate
life."
Brossy said he would like to see more
support for the event from the University.
"We could definitely use more help
monetarily," he said.
The event costs around $125,000, accord
ing to Grace Bull Tail, a member of the Pow
wow Committee. Forty thousand dollars of
that is used to pay Stanford for the use of fa
cilities, security and other costs. The com
mittee's main source of revenue comes from
vendors, though SAIO provides $10,000 —
one third of SAIO's entire budget. The rest
of the money comes from fundraising.
Money troubles for AISES
This year AISES is also facing tight
monetary constraints, after its funding, ac
cording to Kjono, was cut in half.
"That was kind of a shocker," Kjono
said.
AISES, along with other student techni
cal societies, will have an opportunity to
raise money today with the Opportunity
Job Fair, sponsored by the Stanford School
of Engineering.
Native issues 101
While the student leaders in the Native
community aren't entirely satisfied with
the financial support they've received for
their organizations, they are pleased with
the academic programs on campus perti
nent to Native issues. Stanford offers a
major and minor in Native American Stud
ies. According to the Center for Compara
tive Studies in Race and Ethnicity Web

site, the major and minor "promote the on
going discussion of how academic knowl
edge about Native Americans relates to the
historical and contemporary experiences
of Native American people and communi
ties."
Additionally, seminar classes are of
fered at the Native American Theme
House, Muwekma-tah-ruk.
"I took a seminar in the house, and it
was pretty cool because I didn't realize how
many Native authors there were," Kjono
said. "So it's kind of eye-opening, and I
think it's helpful when people from other
tribes learn about different tribes."

Despite the academic programs that
Stanford offers and the cultural program
ming the students work on, many people on
campus know very little about the Native
community beyond what goes on at the
Powwow.
"Sometimes people will say we're the
'minority of the minorities,'" Kjono said.
"There a lot of things that people just don't
understand, and a lot of things that have
been made politically correct or incorrect
for other minorities that do not necessarily
apply to Native Americans. I guess that's
kind of our job as a community: to educate
people."

The Stanford chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society won "Chapter
of the Year" due to the quality of its programming. The society aims to help undergraduates
interested in science and engineering.
