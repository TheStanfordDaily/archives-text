# Davis powers through UCLA defense
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Under first-year head coach Ben Howland,
UCLA has worked its way to second place in the Pa
cific-10 Conference thanks to a renewed defensive
effort and conservative half-court offense. In a 67-52
victory last night at Maples Pavilion, though, power
forward Justin Davis and No. 2 Stanford (15-0, 6-0
Pac-10) showed the Bruins (9-5, 5-2) that they still
have a lot to learn.
Davis made his first nine shots and scored 21
points, while grabbing five offensive rebounds. The
6-foot-9, 230-pound Davis proved too much for
UCLA's long, lean big men to handle, and he
sparked both the Cardinal's 31-7 first-half run and
Stanford's second-half stand to hold off the re
silient Bruins, who outscored the Cardinal 31-25
after the break.
"He's just a very good player," Howland said of
Davis, a fifth-year senior. "They've done a great job
developing him. I think he's one of the best big guys
in the conference."
Davis had more points than all of UCLA's front
court players combined, and had just one fewer of
fensive rebound than the group.
On a night when Stanford's long-range shooters
weren't hitting consistently, Davis' consistent play
inside kept the Cardinal afloat.
The Cardinal's other big men, center Rob Little
and small forward Josh Childress, combined 23
points and 10 rebounds, but Davis was the go-to guy.
"Things that I was throwing up were just
falling in," Davis said. "Even I was surprised at
some of them."
Davis scored on a variety of shots —
turnarounds, layups, short jumpers, a transition
dunk, even an alley-oop — and came away with
several acrobatic offensive boards to keep posses
sions alive.
While Davis' shooting touch was soft tonight —
10-of-ll from the floor and 1-of-l from the line, with
his only miss coming on a difficult tip-in attempt — it
was his strength that overwhelmed the Bruins.
Davis had his way all night with 215-pound T.J.
Cummings and 215-pound seven-footer Ryan
Hollins. 257-pound seven-footer Michael Fey fared a
little better but fouled out in just 12 minutes of play.
"They physically beat you up," Howland said.
"[Hollins and Fey] are sophomores, and they have a
long way to go to play with the likes of Rob Little and
Justin Davis."
While Davis had the strength to muscle his way
under the basket and power in short bank shots, he
also got a few easy buckets and boards because of
his hustle.
"We definitely can match up to any team physi
cally," Davis said. "But I would say, a big part of it is
heart... our own personal desire to go hard."

Davis showed that desire by skying for rebounds
in traffic, going to the floor to fight for a rebound and
stepping out to bat away a pass.
UCLA junior guard Dijon Thompson, who led
the Bruins with 15 points on an array of jump shots,
was disappointed at the tentative play of the Bru
ins' big men. Stanford had consistent success with
pushing the ball and scoring points down low in the
early offense.
"I don't know what I have to say to our bigs to
get them back on defense," Thompson said.
"When they don't get back, it puts a lot of pressure
on the guards."
Without a big man to turn to in the post and un
able to penetrate Stanford's zone defenses, UCLA
jacked up jump shot after jump shot. While Thomp
son and Janou Rubin got hot in the second half from
the perimeter, Stanford controlled the boards and
was able to count on points down low from its big
men to stop UCLA's runs.
"We emphasize so much in practice, rebounding,
rebounding," Little said. "And it pays off."
UCLA seemed unprepared for Davis' large role
in the offense, and for his part, Davis was unde
terred by the double-teams the Bruins ran at him in
the post.
"Justin had a real nice game," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "Offensively, he was
good, and that's the area we were able to go to."
Howland felt his big men didn't have much of a
chance against Davis, given their lack of upper
body strength.
"We don't have a single guy in our program who
can bench-press 300 pounds," he said. "Being
stronger makes you a better player."
With guards Chris Hernandez and Matt Lottich
combining to shoot just 5-of-19 from the floor,
Davis' unexpected output kept the Cardinal com
fortably ahead of the Bruins throughout the contest.
Davis' 21 points tied his career high for a Pac-10
contest. His other 21-point game was set last year
against Washington State, which finished 2-16 in
conference, while last night's output came against a
strong UCLA team.
Had the Bruins won, Montgomery pointed out,
they would've replaced Stanford as the top team in
the Pac-10 standings. Little said the Cardinal was
well aware of Montgomery's misgivings about the
team's inconsistent play last weekend against Cali
fornia and the danger posed by the Bruins.
"Have you ever heard Coach Montgomery talk
before? He tells us we're the worst team in the coun
try," Little joked. "He just stays on us, and I think
that's how it should be."
Howland was more complimentary.
"They have great toughness," he said. "Stanford
was physically stronger at every starting position
tonight."
Especially at power forward.

also got a few easy buckets and boards because of
his hustle.
"We definitely can match up to any team physi
cally," Davis said. "But I would say, a big part of it is
heart... our own personal desire to go hard."

Davis showed that desire by skying for rebounds
in traffic, going to the floor to fight for a rebound and
stepping out to bat away a pass.
UCLA junior guard Dijon Thompson, who led
the Bruins with 15 points on an array of jump shots,
was disappointed at the tentative play of the Bru
ins' big men. Stanford had consistent success with
pushing the ball and scoring points down low in the
early offense.
"I don't know what I have to say to our bigs to
get them back on defense," Thompson said.
"When they don't get back, it puts a lot of pressure
on the guards."
Without a big man to turn to in the post and un
able to penetrate Stanford's zone defenses, UCLA
jacked up jump shot after jump shot. While Thomp
son and Janou Rubin got hot in the second half from
the perimeter, Stanford controlled the boards and
was able to count on points down low from its big
men to stop UCLA's runs.
"We emphasize so much in practice, rebounding,
rebounding," Little said. "And it pays off."
UCLA seemed unprepared for Davis' large role
in the offense, and for his part, Davis was unde
terred by the double-teams the Bruins ran at him in
the post.
"Justin had a real nice game," Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "Offensively, he was
good, and that's the area we were able to go to."
Howland felt his big men didn't have much of a
chance against Davis, given their lack of upper
body strength.
"We don't have a single guy in our program who
can bench-press 300 pounds," he said. "Being
stronger makes you a better player."
With guards Chris Hernandez and Matt Lottich
combining to shoot just 5-of-19 from the floor,
Davis' unexpected output kept the Cardinal com
fortably ahead of the Bruins throughout the contest.
Davis' 21 points tied his career high for a Pac-10
contest. His other 21-point game was set last year
against Washington State, which finished 2-16 in
conference, while last night's output came against a
strong UCLA team.
Had the Bruins won, Montgomery pointed out,
they would've replaced Stanford as the top team in
the Pac-10 standings. Little said the Cardinal was
well aware of Montgomery's misgivings about the
team's inconsistent play last weekend against Cali
fornia and the danger posed by the Bruins.
"Have you ever heard Coach Montgomery talk
before? He tells us we're the worst team in the coun
try," Little joked. "He just stays on us, and I think
that's how it should be."
Howland was more complimentary.
"They have great toughness," he said. "Stanford
was physically stronger at every starting position
tonight."
Especially at power forward.

Fifth-year senior Justin Davis was unstoppable against UCLA last night, scoring 21 points in the Cardinal's home win.
Under first-year head coach Ben Howland,
UCLA has worked its way to second place in the Pa
cific-10 Conference thanks to a renewed defensive
effort and conservative half-court offense. In a 67-52
victory last night at Maples Pavilion, though, power
forward Justin Davis and No. 2 Stanford (15-0, 6-0
Pac-10) showed the Bruins (9-5, 5-2) that they still
have a lot to learn.
Davis made his first nine shots and scored 21
points, while grabbing five offensive rebounds. The
6-foot-9, 230-pound Davis proved too much for
UCLA's long, lean big men to handle, and he
sparked both the Cardinal's 31-7 first-half run and
Stanford's second-half stand to hold off the re
silient Bruins, who outscored the Cardinal 31-25
after the break.
"He's just a very good player," Howland said of
Davis, a fifth-year senior. "They've done a great job
developing him. I think he's one of the best big guys
in the conference."
Davis had more points than all of UCLA's front
court players combined, and had just one fewer of
fensive rebound than the group.
On a night when Stanford's long-range shooters
weren't hitting consistently, Davis' consistent play
inside kept the Cardinal afloat.
The Cardinal's other big men, center Rob Little
and small forward Josh Childress, combined 23
points and 10 rebounds, but Davis was the go-to guy.
"Things that I was throwing up were just
falling in," Davis said. "Even I was surprised at
some of them."
Davis scored on a variety of shots —
turnarounds, layups, short jumpers, a transition
dunk, even an alley-oop — and came away with
several acrobatic offensive boards to keep posses
sions alive.
While Davis' shooting touch was soft tonight —
10-of-ll from the floor and 1-of-l from the line, with
his only miss coming on a difficult tip-in attempt — it
was his strength that overwhelmed the Bruins.
Davis had his way all night with 215-pound T.J.
Cummings and 215-pound seven-footer Ryan
Hollins. 257-pound seven-footer Michael Fey fared a
little better but fouled out in just 12 minutes of play.
"They physically beat you up," Howland said.
"[Hollins and Fey] are sophomores, and they have a
long way to go to play with the likes of Rob Little and
Justin Davis."
