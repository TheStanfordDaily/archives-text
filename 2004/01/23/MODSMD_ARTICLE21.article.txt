## Berkeley program reaches out to China 
### JESSE JARDIM DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY —The Haas
School of Business at the University of Califor
nia-Berkeley is crossing the Pacific to embark on
a $2 million deal to offer MBA courses in China
for five years beginning next fall, Berkeley offi
cials announced yesterday.
One of the largest China-U.S. university part
nerships, the program will bring five graduate
courses to a growing entrepreneurial hub on
China's coast.
The five courses on subjects including — fi
nancial risk management and economic con
cepts — will count toward an Executive MBA
program at Nankai University's newest campus
in Shenzhen.
A small fishing village just 20 years ago, Shen

zhen now has a population of more than 10 mil
lion. It is home to one of China's two largest
stock exchanges and will provide initial public
offerings for small businesses within the next few
months. The city is co-sponsoring the program.
"Haas is interested in having a global pres
ence," said Paul Stames, assistant dean for exec
utive learning at the business school. "Many stu
dents come to Berkeley from Asia. We want
Berkeley to go to Asia."
Indeed, the number of Haas' international
students has tripled over the last 20 years, with a
heavy influx of students coming from China.
"The Chinese demand for financial engineer
ing programs has gotten too large where it's no
longer reasonable for students to come to the
U.S. to get this kind of training," said John
O'Brien, executive director of the masters in fi
nancial engineering program.

And with Berkeley under financial strain
from dwindling state support, the program
brings in extra funds and also fosters exchange
between U.S. and Chinese business cultures.
Already, the school is negotiating 10 other
deals.
The program will target students with upper
and middle-management experience in their late
20s and early 30s.
The students will pay $22,000 for the 18-
month program at the university, ranked as one
of the top 10 in China by the Chinese Ministry of
Education. Its business school is ranked third in
the country.
More courses are planned when the program
grows larger.
"The students learn about American prac
tices and our faculty learns about Asian business
practices," Stames said.
