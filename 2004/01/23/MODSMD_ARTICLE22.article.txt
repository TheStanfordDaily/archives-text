# Columbia begins to post grades online
## 
### JESSICA GRESKO COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK— Both Barnard
College and Columbia University said goodbye to
paper grade sheets last semester. Barnard profes
sors posted their classes' grades online for the first
time, while Columbia, which introduced Web
grading in the spring, used an almost paperless
system.
Registrar offices at both campuses said that be
cause of the new system, grades were posted faster
than ever before. Although a minority of profes
sors did experience some problems entering their
grades, both offices have opted to fully commit to
online grading.
"Except for the business school, we did not
print paper grade sheets," said Columbia assistant
registrar Mel Francis. "We're not going back to
paper."
The two offices worked together this semester
to improve online grading and to introduce an in
tegrated grading roster for professors. For the first
time, Columbia professors logging in through Stu
dent Services Online and Barnard professors log
ging on through eBear could submit grades for
students from either school at the same time, an
option not available in the past.
Submitting grades for Columbia and Barnard
students together made teachers' lives easier, said
Barnard assistant chemistry professor Dina Mer
rer, who teaches a lecture class with more than 100
students. She also said submitting grades via the
web took 10 minutes once they were calculated,
while bubbling in the old paper sheets used to take
at least half an hour.
At Columbia grades were updated automati
cally overnight and required no manual process
ing. The Barnard registrar's office hopes to load
grades directly to the Web by the fall. Even with a
middle step, however, Barnard registrar Con

stance Brown said grades were posted more
quickly than last semester.
"Are we doing better, yes. Do we think it is be
cause of Web grading, yes," Brown said.
Both registrars admit that there are still a few
kinks to work out of the system. Some grades were
delayed unnecessarily because professors saved
their grades on SSOL but did not realize that they
needed to "submit" the grades for students to re
ceive them, a process that required a few more
mouse clicks.
Furthermore, both campuses had professors
— mostly adjunct — who had never activated
their University Network identification and
therefore could not use Web grading until they
were assigned an ID and password. In addition,
some professors had installed a pop-up blocker
on their computers and found that they had to
disable the program temporarily to use Web
grading.
Barnard assistant professor of anthropology
Paige West initially had trouble logging in to the
system using Netscape Navigator. The problems,
however, were quickly fixed, she said, making the
system "super, super easy to use and really conve
nient."
Almost all fall semester grades have now been
submitted. As of Thursday — just more than four
weeks after classes ended — the percentage of un
dergraduate classes at Columbia that had re
ceived grades was in the high 90s, with about 23 of
some 3,000 classes still missing grades, according
to deputy registrar John Carter. At Barnard, 99
percent of grades were posted by Friday, Brown
said.
But even with Web grading, some professors
had trouble submitting their grades on time for a
variety of reasons — including late work from stu
dents, unexpected trips and large classes. That's
not unusual, both registrars said.
Before winter break began, Columbia College

Student Council president Mik Vasarhelyi wrote
a letter to faculty encouraging professors to enter
their grades as promptly as possible. Vasarhelyi
said he did not receive any complaints regarding
late grades from students during break. He said
he considers the problem of late grades to be less
widespread than it was last year, when former
CCSC president Michael Novielli received a
large volume of complaints at the end of the fall
semester.
Engineering Student Council president Vijay
Sundaram said he had not received any com
plaints either, though one of his council members
reported a course's grades appearing incorrect
online. Barnard Student Government Associa
tion president Jeeho Lee said the 20 or so stu
dents she talked to had all received their grades
promptly.
But for the students who were in the minori
ty and missing grades, waiting proved frustrat
ing. Rebecca Weber waited until the second
week of January for two of her grades and ad
mitted to "checking Student Services Online
compulsively" while at home. Weber said she
was concerned about getting grades for a fellow
ship application as well as learning how she had
done.
Late grades can cause problems for students,
Vasarhelyi said, not just because they are interest
ed in the grade they received in a class, but also be
cause they are applying to graduate schools, sum
mer internship programs and fellowships that re
quire complete transcripts as part of their applica
tions.
"I talked to a few other people in the classes just
to verify it wasn't only my grade that was missing,"
Weber said. After some time, however, Weber
says she stopped worrying about her late grades.
"It has happened every semester. It will con
tinue to happen every semester. It's not the end of
the world," she said.
