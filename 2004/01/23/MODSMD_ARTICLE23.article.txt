# Animal testing sparks debate
## 
### ALLISON ROESER TUFTS DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MEDFORD,
Mass. —The Tufts University
School of Veterinary Medicine is
facing controversy after eutha
nizing five dogs earlier this
month. Five test dogs were put to
sleep on New Year's Day after
their legs had been purposefully
broken and re-healed using dif
ferent techniques.
After the dogs were put down,
their bodies were tested to determine
the strength of the healed bones.
The killings were defended by
doctors and veterinarians. The
doctors explained that these test
dogs were not suitable to have as
pets and had been bred for re
search purposes, following the
rules of the American Veterinary
Medical Association.
The dogs were given lethal in
jections, complying with AVMA
standards, and were euthanized
in a humane manner that would
have occurred in any veterinary
clinic, public relations manager
Barbara Donato said.
The Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, a federally
mandated board at the vet
school, gave the final approval
for the research.
Now is not a good time for the
vet school to face a public contro
versy as it is fighting to keep its
state funding which has been
under fire over the last few years.
Vet school students received a
letter stating that Tufts, in con
junction with an orthopedic orga
nization and pet-food company
Hills, would be providing the ma
jority of the funding, masters stu
dent Tara Turner said. The ma
jority of the protesting students
are in the Master of Science and
Animals in Public Policy pro
gram, which does not commonly
work with animals and instead fo
cuses on policy issues.
Several students were out
raged when they learned that the
school was to conduct this exper
iment, and many of these stu
dents conducted their own re
search to find non-lethal methods
that the veterinarians could use
in lieu of euthanasia.
Tara Turner is a student in the
masters program at the vet school
and has been active in this re
search process. But she is hearing
both support and criticism for her
efforts.
"We've received support from
the public, but mostly we have re

ceived angry e-mails from stu
dents, telling us that we're mak
ing a big deal out of this, and that
this story is making us look bad
— which I understand — but I
don't think they understand the
process we went through," Turn
er said.
Currently, nothing has hap
pened at the school since earlier
in January, when a principal in
vestigator was sent to answer stu
dents' questions.
"The meeting ended up being
the faculty asking questions to
the students," said Turner. Turn
er and a group of peers also tried
to talk to Dean Philip Kosch, but
due to scheduling conflicts, the
meeting has been postponed to
the end of the month.
The overwhelming amount of
attention and press received in
Grafton, Mass., has been enough
to upset local residents as well.
Lifelong Grafton resident
John LaPoint was concerned
with the speed and pervasiveness
that the news spread and how the
town was associated with the
killings.
"I personally feel that this pub
he relations blunder and the con
tinuing backlash against the vet
school does not play well in terms
of the town and Tufts trying to re
cruit new businesses," he said.
Residents have been writing
letters to the editor in the local
paper, The Grafton News, voic
ing their opinions, but as far as
LaPoint is aware, that is the ex
tent of the residents' actions
against the research.
"I don't think anyone in this
community is so naive as to not
understand that this is both a re
search and teaching facility, but I
am not aware of any news such as
this getting out to the general
community and news media,"
said LaPoint. "It has generally
been 'happy news' any time there
has been a mention of the Tufts
Vet School. There have generally
been good media relations, in a
pro-active way."
Examples of the healing meth
ods used in the dogs' legs were
the common "pins and rods"
treatment, and the newly devel
oped flexible bone brace. The
school's researchers claim that
this research has the potential to
yield incredible results and is a
vital experiment for the animal
medical field. If the research is
successful, it has the potential to
give dogs with tibia fractures a
newer and faster healing system.
