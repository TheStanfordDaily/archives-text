# Course Work funding expires, administrators explore alternatives

### EUGENIE KIM CAMILLE RICKETTS 
After the expiration of a grant from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation that used to fund Stanford's
CourseWork software, the University has been
scrambling to find a way to pay for the program's cost
ly maintenance.
Since CourseWork's inception two years ago, fac
ulty members have had free access to the service due
to the Mellon Foundation's grant, which amounted to
$500,000 over a two-year period. However, the termi
nation of the grant earlier this year has prompted the
University to ask departments to consider sharing an
nual costs, which Academic Computing has estimated
at $730,000 per year for maintenance alone.
Many faculty members were struck by the admin
istration's proposal to charge individual departments
or even instructors. In an e-mail sent out to the School
of Engineering last fall, Dean Jim Plummer wrote,
"The bottom line here is that the costs of using course
ware are going to be passed on to its users one way or
another."
Plummer said that Provost John Etchemendy rec
ommended a few courses of action for the school. Ei
ther the school could directly pay Academic Comput
ing to maintain the system, or the provost's office

could take care of the cost of maintenance, which
would still mean a $100,000 cut in the school's gener
al funds.
Etchemendy's third suggestion was for the school
to discontinue using CourseWork altogether.
Indeed, in response to the higher costs, the Elec
trical Engineering Department has abandoned
CourseWork for a free alternative: a program called
CCNet, which was developed by Stanford graduate
student Keyvan Mohajer. Professors who use the soft
ware said it works well, allowing for a smooth transi
tion from CourseWork.
Mohajer developed CCNet, which offers the same
range of tools as CourseWork, during his undergrad
uate study at the University of Toronto. After his
alma mater successfully adopted the software, he de
cided to license it to the Stanford Electrical Engineer
ing Department free of charge. However, he says this
type of software should reasonably cost $100,000 to
$400,000 per year.
"I wanted to contribute to my department," Mo
hajer said. "I was really, really happy to be here. I al
ways wanted to go to Stanford since I was 18, and I got
in, and they gave me funding."

Mohajer said he wanted to do
something for Stanford after being
accepted.
"So I offered not only the license
but also my time to promote, main
tain and support it, and I've been
doing that for the past four years,"
he explained.
Mohajer was surprised by the
amount of money the University is
requesting for system upkeep and
said that it would be necessary to cut
costs so that faculty remain willing to
use CourseWork. He added that he
would be willing to make CCNet
available to all departments on cam
pus if it could help reduce expenses.

At Stanford, CCNet requires no
maintenance costs and only a few
hours of work uploading new cours
es each quarter, for which Mohajer
assumes full responsibility.
This has led some engineering
faculty members to question why
CourseWork is so expensive.
Lois Brooks, director of Acade
mic Computing, says that almost all
of the expenses are used to pay six
staff members who manage differ
ent parts of the CourseWork soft
ware.
CourseWork provides services
for approximately 600 courses each
quarter, in contrast to the more than
150 engineering courses on CCNet.
It began in 1998, developed in the
Stanford Learning Lab by Scott
Stocker, the current director of Web
communications. The software was
created to allow human biology stu

dents to access problem sets online.
Since then, the project has adapted
to faculty needs and now includes
special resources for disabled and
foreign language students.
With the addition of these new
features, the Academic Computing
staff has invested more time and en
ergy in satisfying the growing num
ber of requests for new tools.
"We are a victim of our own suc
cess," said Daisy Flemming, one of
the key software developers.
"CourseWork is very successful, so
demand for features and requests for
support are high."
Flemming said the support team
plays an important role in the sys
tem's maintenance.
"They put in extra hours during
the weekend because they are very
committed to the project and want
the users to have good experiences

with the product," she said. "We re
ally need extra help and support, and
not managing to get any funding in
this area really let us down."
In contrast, Mohajer said that he
has received no requests for support
since CCNet went online at Stan
ford, which could help explain the
disparity between maintenance costs
for the two programs.
"I don't know where the $730,000
figure comes from," Stocker said. "I
would imagine that most of that is
staff positions."
But according to Brooks, every
one who helps maintain the Course-
Work system was already employed
by the University, and simply inte
grated the program into their exist
ing job descriptions.
Both Brooks and Stocker ac
knowledged that the University is
making an effort to cut costs in the

near future.
"I understand that they are begin
ning to work with several other uni
versities to adapt CourseWork into
an open-source system that would be
shared among those schools, which
eventually should lower the overall
cost for each university," Stocker
said.
Indeed, The Chronicle of Higher
Education reported yesterday that
Stanford, along with the Indiana
University system, the Massachu
setts Institute of Technology and the
University of Michigan at Ann
Arbor, has announced a $6.8 million
collaborative venture to create
open-source courseware tools and
related software for higher-educa
tion institutions.
The Mellon Foundation has do
nated $2.4 million for the project,
called the Sakai Project, and each of

the four institutions is providing ser
vices worth about $1.1 million over
two years.
"There have been a lot of break
throughs in Java technology since we
launched CourseWork," Flemming
said. "If we want to take advantage
of them we need to redesign the
framework. If we don't move for
ward with the rest of the world, our
code will become obsolete and our
services will become harder to main
tain."
For now, Brooks said that
Etchemendy will ultimately decide
who pays for CourseWork. One idea
is to distribute costs according to
which departments use the system
most. It is unlikely that individual
faculty members will be charged, but
if departments incur the new costs,
resources might be cut for both stu
dents and staff.
