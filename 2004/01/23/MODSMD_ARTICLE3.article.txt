# Course Work funding expires, administrators explore alternatives

After the expiration of a grant from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation that used to fund Stanford's
CourseWork software, the University has been
scrambling to find a way to pay for the program's cost
ly maintenance.
Since CourseWork's inception two years ago, fac
ulty members have had free access to the service due
to the Mellon Foundation's grant, which amounted to
$500,000 over a two-year period. However, the termi
nation of the grant earlier this year has prompted the
University to ask departments to consider sharing an
nual costs, which Academic Computing has estimated
at $730,000 per year for maintenance alone.
Many faculty members were struck by the admin
istration's proposal to charge individual departments
or even instructors. In an e-mail sent out to the School
of Engineering last fall, Dean Jim Plummer wrote,
"The bottom line here is that the costs of using course
ware are going to be passed on to its users one way or
another."
Plummer said that Provost John Etchemendy rec
ommended a few courses of action for the school. Ei
ther the school could directly pay Academic Comput
ing to maintain the system, or the provost's office

could take care of the cost of maintenance, which
would still mean a $100,000 cut in the school's gener
al funds.
Etchemendy's third suggestion was for the school
to discontinue using CourseWork altogether.
Indeed, in response to the higher costs, the Elec
trical Engineering Department has abandoned
CourseWork for a free alternative: a program called
CCNet, which was developed by Stanford graduate
student Keyvan Mohajer. Professors who use the soft
ware said it works well, allowing for a smooth transi
tion from CourseWork.
Mohajer developed CCNet, which offers the same
range of tools as CourseWork, during his undergrad
uate study at the University of Toronto. After his
alma mater successfully adopted the software, he de
cided to license it to the Stanford Electrical Engineer
ing Department free of charge. However, he says this
type of software should reasonably cost $100,000 to
$400,000 per year.
"I wanted to contribute to my department," Mo
hajer said. "I was really, really happy to be here. I al
ways wanted to go to Stanford since I was 18, and I got
in, and they gave me funding."
