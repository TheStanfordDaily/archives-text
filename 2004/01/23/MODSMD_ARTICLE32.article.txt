# Make a date with 'Tad Hamilton'
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
"Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!" is the
best romantic comedy of the year. It's also one
of the only romantic comedies so far. But never
mind that.
Kate Bosworth stars as Rosalee Futch, a
good-natured clerk at a Piggly Wiggly grocery
store in West Virginia, circa 1965. Her boss,
Pete (Topher Grace), is secretly in love with
her. (Oink, oink.) But she and her bosom bud
Cathy (Ginnifer Goodwin) are, like, totally in
love with the big screen idol Tad Hamilton
(Josh Duhamel).
As fate would have it, Rosalee wins a con
test, is shipped off to Hollywood and scores a
date with the star. And after a deep dinner con
versation about orthodontics, Tad falls in love
with Rosalee, buys a farm in West Virginia and
tries to win her over.
Got it? Good.
The premise by Victor Levin is simple
enough. But as directed by Robert Luketic, who
made a big splash in 2001 with "Legally
Blonde," "Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!"
finds just the right note of irony in celebrity with
out sacrificing the warmth of its performances.
Bosworth, who last appeared as the lead in
"Blue Crush," is equally capable here. In a way,
her role is a tightrope walk, as she is required to

find the right chemistry with both the leading
men.
Not only does she rise to the occasion, she
delivers her lines with a touch of small-town
charm that the screenplay couldn't have even
imagined. (Then again, this isn't "Monster" ...
and it shouldn't be.)
Topher Grace from "That '70s Show"
comes off as a young Tom Hanks with his acer
bic wit. Goodwin, who last stole the picture
among a screen full of talents in "Mona Lisa
Smile," does another admirable job.
And there are some well-constructed gags
involving Sean Hayes and Nathan Lane as
Tad's two agents, who fly to West Virginia in
the hope of trying to convince him to return to
Hollywood.
The producers of "Win a Date With Tad
Hamilton!" reportedly shopped the script with
big name stars like Ben Affleck and Hugh
Grant before finding Duhamel. And the movie
wouldn't have worked any other way: The ge
nius behind Luketic's direction is that
Duhamel, the small-time star, can play with the
Hollywood stereotypes without tarnishing his
own image.
And the actor, whose career so far has been
limited to soap opera work and the TV drama
"Las Vegas," sports the right image of jock
celebrity (think Brad from "The Real World:
San Diego") to complete the love triangle.

Of course, you can guess the film's ending a
mile away. (One could imagine a more biting
look at celebrity and romance, with a more dia
bolic Rosalee, had the material come from the
pen of, say, David Mamlet.)
But that doesn't matter much.

"Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!" doesn't
aim for the stars, so to speak. It's warm and
cheerful and has its heart in the right place. And
after a slow month at the movies, here's one that
finally works.
