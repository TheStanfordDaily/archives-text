# 'Butterfly' can't flap past silly screenplay
## 
### RAMIN SETOODEH EDITOR IN CHIEF 
in "The Butterfly Effect," Ashton
Kutcher wakes up trapped inside a
prison, a mental institution and — of
all terrors — a sorority house. But you

haven't lived yet until you've seen Mr.
Kutcher disbrachiated, spilling his guts
to the love of his life, who happens to
be dating his best friend, who happens
to detonate a mailbox bomb that kills
two in the neighborhood.
Much has been made of this dra

matic turn taken by Kutcher — notori
ous for his playful humor on "Punk'd"
and the flat comedies "Dude, Where's
My Car," "Just Married" and "The
Boss' Daughter." But this, dear read
ers, is a role not even the great Sir Lau
rence Olivier could pull off.

Kutcher, sporting facial hair that
looks like it came from a gerbil, plays
Evan Treborn, a hapless 20-some
thing who relives his life over again in
a more hyperbolic version of
"Groundhog Day."
First, we see Evan as a boy (John
Patrick Amedori) in love with the
neighborhood cutie, Kayleigh (Irene
Gorovaia). The pivotal scene in their
youth . . . well, I can't finish the sen
tence. Because there is more than one
pivotal scene, staged in alternative uni
verses, as Evan the adult revisits his
childhood and changes the past.
In the future — or the present, de
pending on how you tell time — Evan
continually reunites with the older
Kayleigh (Amy Smart), who herself
takes on a gamut of roles: from a soror
ity girl to a prostitute. (Now, now, hold
the jokes.)
The screenplay by J. Mackye Gru
ber and Eric Bress is cut like "21
Grams" meets "Memento" with bro
ken puzzle pieces. If the material had
come to me, say, in a college movie
writing seminar, this is how a critique
would read:
(1) "The Butterfly Effect" is titled
after a scientific theory that claims a
butterfly in Brazil can cause a tornado
in Texas just by flapping" its wings.
Funny that the movie tries to bring up
science when it can't even explain the
science of its own plot.

Evan jumps from the past to the
present and back again by reading old
journal entries. Say what? You can be
ludicrous in a sci-fi movie, but you have
to at least be able to conceptualize the
ludicrousness.
(2) There's enough plot here for at
least a dozen Lifetime TV movies.
Perhaps we need the mailbox detona
tion scene. But do we really need to
meet Evan's psychotic father who tries
to strangle him as a child? Or
Kayleigh's pedophile father (Eric
Stoltz) who tries to videotape her and
Evan in various sexual positions? Or
the scene where Evan's dog is torched
to death by Keyleigh's brother (Jesse
James)?
(3) And then there is the end of the
story. After all the leaping from one
life to the next, shouldn't the conclu
sion at least tie up some of the loose
threads of the story line? Nope. The fi
nale here plays like it's been tacked on
as an afterthought.
"The Butterfly Effect" might work
better on video — as a backdrop to a
drinking game. Every time Ashton
travels back in time, take a shot. Every
time a character is torched, knifed or
dies in some other gruesome way, take
another shot.
By the time Ashton is armless ...
Dude, you'll be too wasted to notice.


Ashton Kutcher and Amy Smart can't quite score in 'The Butterfly Effect/' which opens today.
