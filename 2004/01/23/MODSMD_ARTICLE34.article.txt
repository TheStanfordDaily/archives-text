# Don't Forget About ... Daedelus

### MIKE ORME 
A typical article on Daedelus, the luminary 26-year-old
DJ from Santa Monica, begins with an anecdotal comparison with
the mythical inventor Daedelus, father of unfortunate wanderer
and NES superstar Icarus. The anecdote would chronicle the pair's
imprisonment on Crete by King Minos and continue with Daedelus
building two pairs of wings so they could escape their island prison.
The story ends in tragedy when during their flight, young Icarus at
tempts to soar too close to the sun, his wings melt and he plummets

to his death while his helpless
father watches. As I said, I
could use that to start things
off, but then two significant
words come to mind: deriva
tive tripe.

The Daedelus we are covering here (born Alfred Weis
berg-Roberts) bears little resemblance to that poor character of
Greek myth, excepting his inventive nature. Our boy deals in a
unique brand of music combining the disparate feel of found sound
samples from the 30s and 40s with the beeps and clicks of IDM
(short for "Intelligent Dance Music," an overly pretentious name
for the relatively simple genre of largely undanceable electronica).

I know how this all sounds. My first reaction
to Daedelus's concept before I heard his music resem
bled my reaction to a recent art show I attended
where some guy had stuck stereos blaring Alice in
Chains inside a bunch of fake tree stumps in the mid
dle of a white room and turned on some green lights.
But while Daedelus takes a firm step into the

territory of the cliched, he sticks the listener with his tongue-in-cheek humor and elegant combi
nation of yesteryear melodies with futuristic flourishes. From his beginnings as a pirate radio DJ,
to becoming a member of the eclectic Dublab.com DJ collective (along with friend Dntel, aka

Jimmy Tamorello of Postal Service fame), Daedelus has crafted an enchanting style that escapes
imitation.

Take "Invention," Daedelus's 2002 debut from Plug Re
search. This album depicts the dreamy soundscape of a sterile
future quietly reflecting upon the bygone past. In "Inven
tion's" nostalgic world, electronic beeps and beats dance side
by-side with sweet clarinet melodies and soft brushed snares.
The few vocal tour guides are lonely, disconnected sound
bytes from forgotten books on tape which recite contempla
tive, enchanting stories.
Two tracks on "Invention" also feature the talents of avant
garde rappers Busdriver and Sach, who lay their beats over
"Quiet" and "Pursed Lips Reply," respectively. The Busdriv
er track is far and away the most successful, as Busdriver's
confident, playful baritone meshes well with Daedelus's
urban, late-night beats.
In fact, their collaboration was so successful that Daedelus
later laid down the music for the 2003 Busdriver and Radioin
active LP, "The Weather." On this upbeat album, Busdriver
and Daedelus gel so well that Radioinactive- himself some
thing of a PG-13 Eminem clone- struggles to keep up. Never
theless, "The Weather" is a genuine hip-hop winner, and its
success prompted even further re-working from Daedelus. In

the summer of 2003, he released "Rethinking the
Weather," an instrumental collection of beats culled
from the "Weather" sessions. "Rethinking" provides
an illuminating chronicle of the thought-process of
this creative beat-maker.
2003 saw Daedelus at one of his highest levels of
productivity; one only wonders what 2004 can bring

for him. Old friends like Tamorello and Dublab pal Mia Doi Todd are already beginning to find
mainstream success. With efforts like "Invention" and "The Weather" under his belt, Daedelus
should expect to fly high in 2004. Oh jeez-forget the "flying high" bit.
