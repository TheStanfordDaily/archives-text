# My sister's first words were 'Michael Jackson'

						Tale of Innocence Lost

Do you like Michael Jackson's nose? Do you like Michael Jack
son's music? "Number Ones" contains most of Jackson's huge dance hits:
"Billie Jean," "Beat it," "Bad" and "Smooth Criminal." They come back
with delicious familiarity, like an old addiction you never really kicked. In
middle school, we slow danced and first kissed to grunge rockers who blew
their brains out and songs that celebrated obsessive necrophiliac compul-

sions. There's no point in taking the moral
high ground — the 80s are in our blood. So
let your eyes roll back, and enjoy.
But hold on a minute. The prob
lem is that "Number Ones" also contains a

number of uncomfortably slow, soul-searching ballads with very clear
lyrics. Cringe-worthy moments include the self-help-ish "Man in the Mir
ror" ("I've been the victim of a selfish kind of love"), "One More Chance"
("This time I'm gonna do my best to make it right") and the hand-holding
uplifting-ness of "You Are Not Alone," which was written and produced
by fellow accused child molester R Kelly. Most of Jackson's vintage hits
had lyrics which were deliberately ambiguous—like his public persona
was, before he had anything to apologize for. Witness the genius of
"Smooth Criminal'"s chorus:

Annie are you ok
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie are you ok
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie
Annie are you ok
So, Annie are you ok
Are you ok, Annie

Annie are you ok
So, Annie are you ok,
Are you ok, Annie
Read this out loud. Isn't K a hypnotic letter?
If you ignore the yucky lyrics (or, as in my case, your English skills are
not sufficient for you to notice the lyrics without Googling), the album
does offer some nice listening. Michael Jackson makes such great high
pitched noises — not only the famous aaows, but also guhs, hoos, huh
huhs, uahs, ee-hee-hees and much, much more. (If you are into this kind
of thing, he goes "hoo" three beats in a row in the last part of "Bad." I
went "hoo" too. It was like a best-of-Pikachu's-vocabulary-fest.)
My favorite moment of "Billy Jean" is the part where a synthetic
trumpet appears out of nowhere, imitates a high-pitched-Michael-
Jackson-like sound, and is promptly run over by reverb-heavy strings.
Other favorite non-human-instrument bits: The syncopated glass-tap
ping sounds in "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough," the bottle-cap per
petuum mobile percussion and the Theremin on "Thriller," the
strangely avuncular laugh that morphs from ha to hu at the end of the
song, and the kung-fu-video-game intro to "Beat It." Also noteworthy
is "I Just Can't Stop Loving You," a duet with Siedah Garret. A chal
lenge: try to figure out which voice is Siedah Garret's.
Aow, aow!
Michael Jackson's face is possibly the most poignant image I've ever
seen. But the album art doesn't really show that much of his face. So ul
timately, we don't think the album is worth $15.99, (or $17.31 plus tax).

All the songs we really liked were either from "Thriller" or "Bad." If you

like them, you probably have them already. (Admit it! You do! You own music by Michael Jack
son! It's okay.) If you don't have them already, you probably know someone who does. Make a
friend. You are not alone.

"Number Ones"


Oh, Michael, you always were the coy one ...
