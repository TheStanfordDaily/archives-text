# DiFranco's 'Guess' better than yours
## 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
What does it take to be a true rock-folk-funk
goddess? What does it take to keep from selling
out, remaining a vanguard of the indie scene?
With some 16 albums under her belt, Ani
DiFranco offers up an "Educated Guess" (her
latest album) as to how she remains on top of the
indie heap. The result: A blend of soulful lyrics,
wrenching prose and sincere guitar in 14 tracks

that are pure Ani.
After starting her
own record label (Right
eous Babe records), de
claring her bisexuality
and profusely refusing to
sell out, DiFranco re
mains a steadfast indie

goddess. In the titular track of the album (track
three) "Educated Guess," DiFranco challenges
her listeners to, "use your education / and take
an educated guess / about me." "Educated
guess" is easily the most memorable track on the
album; its slow, lulling melody, sweeps the listen
er into the sound and offers enough of a hook to
make it repeat in your mind for days on end.
DiFranco's latest foray espouses the same
sort of wit and wisdom experienced on Lauryn
Hill's "Miseducation of Lauryn Hill," but with
out the studio finnesse, allowing for a more raw
and untouched feel. DiFranco plays with both
genre and style, achieving a jazzed up funky
sound on "Bliss Like This," and almost free
styling on "The True Story of What Was." The

album is successful because it is a true mixture of
musical types, transcending any sort of catego
rization.
"Educated Guess" is borne of pure feeling,
more than anything. She finds a way to be femi
nine, poetic and political, while unconcerned
with polish or pizzazz. One gets the sense that
her entire album could have been conceived in
one beautiful orgasm of emotion, without any re
working or re-styling. This is especially evident
on "Bodily" and "You Each Time," where

DiFranco displays more
interesting vocals, juxta
posed with elements of
near a cappella, as she al
lows just her voice and
the silence to cohere. So
much more than a "girl
with a guitar," DiFranco

appeals to anyone with a heart and soul.
While it's tempting to compare DiFranco to
Sheryl Crow, or Joan Baez or (heaven forbid!)
Jewel, DiFranco is unlike anyone else. What sep
arates her from so many of her contemporaries is
her powerful lyricism, working phrases like "To
the deep mahogany sheen of a roach /
I am trying to take an appreciative approach"
into her songs. Her prose is so subtle and sugges
tive that it is easy to overlook its weight, but her
voice commands you to stop and pay attention.
It's obvious that DiFranco makes music be
cause that's what she enjoys, that's what she feels
and she doesn't want to compromise. But that's
just an educated guess.

girl with a guitar'
