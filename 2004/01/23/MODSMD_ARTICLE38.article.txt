# The 						Crystal Method still not up to speed
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Crystal Method (TCM), like all great club-drugs, began circulating
underground. Tooth-grinding ravers of the L.A. circuit got hooked on
TCM's 12-inch LP singles years before the duo's first full-length album,
"Vegas," was released in 1997. After its critical and commercial success,
millions of Americans discovered what only the speed freaks had known
before: Crystal Method kept you dancing long after the body crashed.
Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland, the producer / musicians behind TCM,
helped bring electronic music to a wider American audience than ever be
fore. Singles off "Vegas" were used to sell everything from Gap khakis to
Mazda Miatas and littered the soundtracks of loud Jerry Bruckheimer
style movies.

But The Crystal Method epidemic predictably led to overuse, toler
ance, and then withdrawal. "Tweekend," their sophomore album, was re
leased in 2001 to mixed reviews. With their latest effort, "Legion of
Boom," TCM returns to the synthesized, metallic breakbeats that made
them famous, and they succeed ... a little too well.
"Legion of Boom" is a technically solid, well-organized album; in other
words, it's catchy but boring. Listening to the disc's first single, "Born Too
Slow," conjures up visions of sweaty-shiny Will Smith (shirtless, natch)
running in slow motion while things around him burn and / or

ex
plode. Either I'm experiencing what my mother calls "special moment of
the becoming woman time," or TCM has settled into the Moby-led fief-

They're so underground, they need dark glasses in the open! Suckers!
dom of predictable synthetic blah.
Perhaps I'm being too harsh â€” no
one is as lame as Moby! (That's what
makes him special.) TCM is more like
electro IKEA: good and functional, yah,
but anyone deeper than laminated parti
cleboard and taller than 4'H" doesn't re
ally want to shop there for home furnish
ings.
Luckily, TCM invited some interest
ing guests to help liven up the album.
Even heavily dubbed over, Lisa Kekaula
of the Bell Rays is a welcome vocal addi
tion to the blithely robotic "Realizer" and
the "something's crawling all over me"
rhythmic nervousness of "High and
Low."
Wes Borland (who quit Limp Bizkit
after realizing that not only does Fred
Durst suck, he's also a psycho-bitch)
lends his writing and guitar skills to a few
of the disc's more memorable tracks. His
finesse is especially evident in the ami
able, but complex guitar riffs of "Broken
Glass."
Borland's contribution to the clumsily
named "Weapons of Mass Distortion" is
less noticeable, but you've got to admire
TCM for at least trying to make a dance
worthy protest song. Not nearly as good
as Outkast's "B.O.B.," but then again,
what is really?
TCM is often hailed as the American
counterpart to the established U.K. mas
ters of electronica. However, the British
have history and experience on their side,
which makes them better. Always. Stellar
recent releases by the Chemical Brothers,
Basement Jaxx and Richard X further
prove this point.
But in this country, TCM rules. Their
work on "Legions of Boom" has been
nominated for five 2003 DanceStar
American Dance Music Awards, an
achievement that would be more impres
sive if only this year's honorary Outstand
ing Contribution to Music award wasn't
being presented to Moby.
