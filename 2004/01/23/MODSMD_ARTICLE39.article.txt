# On A Date With The Stars Of Tad Hamilton'

Top her Grace plays Pete, the grocery store
manager smitten by Rosalee — yet afraid to
confess his love. Grace first struck it big with
the lead role in Fox's "That '70s Show," which
will be entering its final season next year.
You don't play the hunk in this movie. Disappointed?
There are two guys that you can play as an actor, the
guy you want to be and the guy you are. And that's the
difference between Tom Cruise and Tom Hanks. And
I know which one I am.
Will you miss "That '70s Show" when it wraps next
year?
A sitcom is the most wonderful graduate school for
acting. The problem is that not a lot of people can get
into sitcoms. We've done our run. Next year is our sev
enth and final year. I'd do it forever if I could.
The critics have been pretty harsh on your co-star Ash
ton Kutcher. Care to comment on his acting ability?
Pass. Ashton is my brother — and he's a phenomenal
actor. We can sit and talk about Ashton all day but
he's not in this film.
Well, let's talk about your upcoming film "P.S." which
opens later this year.
Laura Linney and I are lovers. I lost my screen virgini
ty. She is the kindest... she is one of the great actors. I
was really nervous, really nervous — probably more
nervous than when I really lost my virginity.
You yell at a man dressed in a pig costume in "Tad
Hamilton!" Any pet peeves?
I hate when young Hollywood says, "I'm normal." It's
like saying, "I'm not cheating on you," to someone. It
only means one thing. A girl in the audience of "That
'70s" asked me to prom with her, crying. What do you
say to that? No one wanted me to say yes except for
her. [What happened?] I went to prom with her and
she's my girlfriend. No. I mean, you just say I'm busy
that night — which night is it?

Ginnifer Goodwin stole the spotlight last Christmas with a supporting role in "Mona Lisa Smile." Now she plays
Rosalee 's best friend at the Piggly Wiggly supermarket.

You have a wacky wardrobe in this movie?
My character lives in this romance world — that required more color. But they always make me have bigger
boobs. For once, I want to play the girl who has my-size boobs.
After this and "Mona Lisa Smile," are you afraid that you'll be pigeonholed as a supporting player?

I honestly find supporting roles are written more interestingly. Because oftentimes, they are the more clearly defined character.
How was it working with Julia Roberts in "Mona Lisa Smile" ?
She taught me how to keep balance. Because truthfully I don't want Julia Roberts' career — I'd rather have Marcia Gay Harden's career. Frankly, the char
acter actors, Meryl Streep excepted, will never be America's sweethearts.
Still adjusting to the Hollywood life?
"Mona" was my first experience with kind of being overwhelmed. I got out of the car at the premiere and I was shaking, I was terrified. I'd also never seen so
much paparazzi in my life. My face starts twitching, and I don't want to be smiling and I want to be crying. I turned to Julia Roberts and I grabbed her hand
and held on to it for dear life and I was like, does this still scare you? And she said, Every time.

It's not that I dislike it. It's something I woul

Yes. As long as we can be in the same place.
