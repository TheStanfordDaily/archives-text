# 'This Seat's Taken'... For Good!
## Student-led production even floors cynical Interminion 
### MERRIIT FORREST BAER 
There is a Resident Genius on campus. No, he cannot be

found curing cancer in the bio department,
nor is he solving Einstein's unfinished uni
fied relativity in an underground physics
lab. Actually, he's no techie at all. He's
writer / director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar of
the Stanford Drama Department, and his
senior project "Is This Seat Taken?" is an
achingly beautiful and twisted mounting of
dark comedy.
Billed as "a fairy tale," Iskandar's play
(which closed last Saturday) starts on
Thanksgiving and ends at Christmas, deliv
ering a sinister look at love, deception, be
trayal, youth and growth. "This Seat" in
dulges in the pathos of the dysfunctional
American family, highly reminiscent of the
writing styles of Alan Ball ("Six Feet
Under" and "American Beauty"). Address
ing themes such as homosexuality, incest,
depression and drugs, this fairy tale delivers
punch after punch and acts as a prime venue
for Iskandar's flair for sharp, witty dialogue.
His directorial vision crosses the bounds be-

tween cinematic and theatrical, which trans
lates to a chic, edgy production that should raise the bar for fu
ture senior projects.
Luckily, Iskandar is not the only starlet in this production
— the cast is truly remarkable. Rob Hiaasen leads the affected
family as the aggravated father who comes to terms not only
with his own exploding sexuality, but also his son's newfound
homosexuality. Hiaasen's strong performance lies in his ability

to show controlled change without overacting. Nicholas Allen's
touching turn as the gay son highlights the fine lines between
comedy and drama, showing his great versatility. Megan Cohen
plays a great Nanny and delivers many farcical lines with great
skill and ease. While each of these actors is truly wonderful, it
is their castmates who shine in the more outlandish and nu
anced roles.
Sarah Moser gives an intense performance as the privi-

leged, yet conflicted daughter. Her instincts are dead on, as her
innocent, though seemingly jaded character grapples with the
actions of her manic family. Greg Worswick definitely gives the
most natural performance of the production: As the stranger
turned lover, he delivers at every level and never seems out of
place. His understated performance is a delight to watch and

speaks immensely to the worth of subtlety. On the other end of
the spectrum, Chris Labrum is spectacular in a role that might
otherwise seem ridiculous. He handles the splashy role with a
wildly colorful performance. However, in a room full of talent,
Daphne Nayar stands out as absolutely incredible. Using a fine
balance of nuance and strength, she offers a sarcastic and dis
tant performance that explores the inherently thin line between
laughing and crying. Her devastating portrayal of the bereaved

mother is outstanding.
Produced by the incomparable Traci Tsai, the
crew for this production reads like a who's who
for Stanford theatre. Arguably the most elabo
rate set ever dreamt for Prosser Theater, De-
Mara Cabrera's interlaced sets work exception
ally well and combine a kitchen, dining room,
bedroom, bathroom, living room, as well as two
outdoor benches in the tiny space. As if that
wasn't enough, somehow she gets it to snow in
side of Prosser!
The lighting by Kim Falinski is sharp and ac
centuated, using shadows and color to create an
exceptional melange. Storm Staley and Ed
Iskandar's sound really adds vitality to the play
(such as the muted clocks used discreetly in sev
eral scenes) and employ beautiful and odd motifs
from "American Beauty," "Six Feet Under" and
"Angels in America." All of these tools find
shape under the stage direction of the artistically
gifted Kendra Arimoto and Bekah McNeil.
This gem of a production speaks volumes about

the state of student theatre at Stanford. Whereas I
am normally a tough critic, I am justly at a lack of

criticism for this nearly flawless production. Had it been writ
ten by Alan Ball, I would still be amazed at the wonderful pro
duction value, but with a student writer, this piece was simply
astonishing. Essentially, Iskandar has assembled a group of ex
ceptional colleagues and mounted a glorious staging of his bril
liant play.


I can tell from that lustful gaze that you got that scarf at Burbery! : The men share a moment and a seat.

rate set ever dreamt for Prosser Theater, De-
Mara Cabrera's interlaced sets work exception
ally well and combine a kitchen, dining room,
bedroom, bathroom, living room, as well as two
outdoor benches in the tiny space. As if that
wasn't enough, somehow she gets it to snow in
side of Prosser!
The lighting by Kim Falinski is sharp and ac
centuated, using shadows and color to create an
exceptional melange. Storm Staley and Ed
Iskandar's sound really adds vitality to the play
(such as the muted clocks used discreetly in sev
eral scenes) and employ beautiful and odd motifs
from "American Beauty," "Six Feet Under" and
"Angels in America." All of these tools find
shape under the stage direction of the artistically
gifted Kendra Arimoto and Bekah McNeil.
This gem of a production speaks volumes about

the state of student theatre at Stanford. Whereas I
am normally a tough critic, I am justly at a lack of

criticism for this nearly flawless production. Had it been writ
ten by Alan Ball, I would still be amazed at the wonderful pro
duction value, but with a student writer, this piece was simply
astonishing. Essentially, Iskandar has assembled a group of ex
ceptional colleagues and mounted a glorious staging of his bril
liant play.


I can tell from that lustful gaze that you got that scarf at Burbery! : The men share a moment and a seat.
