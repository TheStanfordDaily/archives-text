# That's Amore: Roxy in Florence
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
I have been in Florence for exactly one
week, and so far have gotten less play than a
freshman boy at a frat party. Here, in the city
of romance, most of my time is spent in para
noiac guard against the gypsies and in trying
to figure out how to split the bill. You knew
we were going out to eat. So why did you
bring a 50? WHY GOD WHY?!!
Not that I'm itching for some lovin' just
yet. After all, I did just return from a winter
break full of hooking up with fellow high
school alums as well as someone who may or
may not still be in high school. This topic re
mains open for debate. But eventually, after
settling in — "immersing," if you will — and
truly taking in the city, our minds will turn to
subjects other than Florence, or Paris, or

wherever else we happen to be. And after we
metaphorically harvest the cultural organs of
our respective cities, and transplant said or
gans into our own bodies and forever alter
the way we view the world — the way we
laugh and cry and eat panini— the hor
mones are going to kick back into gear. This
is not a prediction. This is a guaranteed fact
of life.
Unfortunately, when you're abroad, the
options are somewhat limited. This statement
is, of course, untrue... Children, there is a
whole new city full of people to hook up with!
A whole new city full of men with tiny cars
who apparently feel no need to compensate
for insufficiencies elsewhere! But as much as
I'd like to hear Italian phrases sexily whis
pered into my ear, I don't think I could ever
be that comfortable in a situation wherein I
couldn't understand the difference between

"You smell great" and "Can I try on your
panties?"
Then there are the people in your pro
gram; friends with whom you will probably
form "lifelong bonds." Sure it may sound like
a good idea to get on your fellow classmate:
You can stroll through quaint cobbled streets
hand-in-hand, shove your tongues down each
other's throats whilst sipping cappuccino, and
join the second-string mile-high club by doing
it in charter bus bathrooms.
Unless, of course, something goes terribly
wrong. And it will.
You'll realize they're not as cool as you ini
tially believed. Or they're not as funny.Or
maybe they're not even a student and you've
been making out with the gelato guy for the last
three weeks. Either way, there's always a lot of
risk involved when you choose to get busy with
someone in such close proximity. You think it's

hard avoiding that kid from ProFro weekend
whose shoes you booted in? Try avoiding
someone who makes up 15 percent of all your
social interactions on a daily basis.
I'm all for love abroad, but don't say I
didn't warn you when you find yourself
dropping out of the program and supporting
yourself by going down on tourists in the
Mickey D's bathroom. Because we all know
it happens. Don't let yourself be another
OSP statistic.
Besides, going out dancing in Italy is the
vertical equivalent of junior high dry hump
ing. By the end of the night you'll have been
eagerly felt up so many times you could
swear that you just had sex. Then you can
light up a Parliament and stumble home, just
like you did back at Stanford, except this
time if you get lost you can't spend the night
in the post office.
