# MC Lars hips up the Stanford scene
## Intermission interviews Stanford rapper Andrew Nielsen — a.k.a.MC Lars 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The purveyor of hard core hip-hop at Stanford is junior An
drew Nielsen, an English major who performs with his band the
Androids under the name MC Lars Horris, recently abridged to
MC Lars. MC Lars raps about topics from Shakespeare to John
Brown to campus life. His album "Radio Pet Fencing" was re
leased last September in the England by the label Truck
Records, and it was just released in the United States.
INTERMISSION: How did you meet the people in Truck
Records?
NIELSEN: I did the Oxford abroad program, and that was real
ly fun. And I was performing a lot in Oxford, because they have
a really cool music scene.
INT: Better than Stanford?
NIELSEN: [laughs] So much better. Not to hate on Stanford's
scene, but we really kinda don't have one. Stanford's cool, but
I think it's also cool that Stanford offers a liaison into other
worlds. But basically I was doing the rap stuff with my laptop
because my band was all here, and eventually people started
remembering my name, so then the record labels [started tak
ing notice] — I had three labels who wanted to put this out —
and the one I went with was the one that was based in Oxford.
INT: How widely released is it going to be? Am I going to be
able to find it in Borders?
NIELSEN: If you do Borders and search the computer, it's
there, but since it's my first album, they don't have a lot of first
albums in the chains. You can just order it from Borders, but it's
pretty much only on the shelves of independent record stores.
Amoeba should have it.
INT: How did you originally get into music and recording?
NIELSEN: My first recording was when I was eight. I was just
singing into a tape recorder like this. So I was recording at 11,1
was remixing my friend's stupid rap tracks or whatever with like
stupid computer beats. But the first song I wrote came when I
was 12, and I learned guitar. And I knew three chords. So it was
like E-minor, G, D, and then like a [farting noise]. And so that's
my song for like two minutes. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-[fart]. It's called "The Gas Man."
INT: How did it wander into hip hop?
NIELSEN: That's a really great question, because I don't
know, actually. I was doing these songs just by myself, because
I was in bands and stuff, but I realized that I can sing, but I can't
sing great, but I realized like if I take my voice, I rap passably.
INT: You don't sound like what I'd expect a rapper to sound
like. But that's all right.
NIELSEN: The biggest influence for me to start rapping
was...listening to the Bloodhound Gang. I don't know if that to
tally destroys any rap credibility to say they're my influence.
Them and Insane Clown Posse, [laughs] It's terrible, huh?
INT: I noticed that in your song "Hey, That's Me" there are a lot
of in-jokes about Stanford, like "satisfying women like GERs"
and you name-check a bunch of friends. Are you worried that
that is going to come off as too in-jokey?
NIELSEN: The guy who did the music video in England re
searched all the Stanford stuff, so it has Jorge Cham and "Ph.D"
and "27th Street." I think people in England were intrigued be
cause it's like, all this American slang of this university. I don't
know, I think people really like it here, or in England, but I don't
know if it's going to catch on in the rest of the U.S. [laughs] Prob
ably not that song.
INT: Do you know how the sales are in England?
NIELSEN: Yeah, it's selling well. It's sold almost 5,000. Which is

hard. I mean, it's good for a first band, but like, a good run is like
10,000, that's when you start making anything. Not that that's
what I'm in it for, at all.
INT: You told me earlier that you might be changing your stage
name. Are you just MC Lars now?
NIELSEN: Yeah, the problem is that no one knows how to spell
or say Horris, and they think it's horse, and so Horris will just be
like an inside thing, but MC Lars will be the main thing. But Hor
ris will be in the back of the book, of the CD, or something.
INT: Tell me about this big-shot producer you're working with.
NIELSEN: Yeah, when I did the September tour, this guy read
about me and contacted me. And I met him when he was out
here and he was the manager of all these big people, whatever,
and he hooked me up with this producer who's worked with Pub
lic Enemy and he did this band Brand New, he did their first
album - they're kinda emo, [laughs] I hadn't heard of them ei
ther, but apparently they're kind of big. So he did three songs
with me over winter break. And he was really fun to work with,
a real cool guy. I'd never been in a studio before, like a real

$50,000 studio, so it was awesome.
INT: So you're a sell-out whore now?
NIELSEN: I don't know. I will be if Apple uses my song.
INT: What is it that they're trying to do?
NIELSEN: So are we allowed to — should we talk about this?
INT: Let's talk about this.
NIELSEN: OK. So one of the songs I wrote is called, "iGenera
tion." Like iPod, but it's iGeneration. And these managers have
a connection with Apple. And so I'll know next week if they're
using it or not. But they're trying to use it for an ad, for their Mac
intosh.
INT: That's cool.
NIELSEN: It's cool, but it's not what I intended. I don't want to
be doing commercials.
INT: Tell me about how your songwriting process works.

NIELSEN: Well, I'll think of something funny or surprising and
write it down in my notebook or whatever. I'll look at it in a few
days, and if I like it still I'll start writing out verses, and then try
to think of what the feel is, and then try to create a beat, and my
friend Damondrick Jack is really good with moods, like if I have
an idea for a lyric and a beat that I want to go to, he'll tell me if
he thinks it works or not. So recently it's become a really collab
orative process with him.
INT: What do you want people to take away from your songs?
How do you want to make them feel?
NIELSEN: Well, can I quote Aristotle, or is that obnoxious? It's
obnoxious, isn't it?
INT: It's obnoxious, but go ahead.
NIELSEN: In his "Poetics," he talks about catharsis, he spells it
with a "k" — that's really obnoxious — but he says the goal of
anything like that is to leave people "lighted and delighted." So
that's what I hope. Because they're funny, and because I also
want people to be educated with my songs.

INT: So with a song like "Rapbeth," you want people to come
out of it with a better knowledge of Shakespeare?
NIELSEN: Yeah, and like, a kid who's never read "Macbeth"
can summarize the plot in class. That would be awesome.
INT: Then they don't have to read the book.
NIELSEN: I mean, yeah, then when they get to college, read
the book, read the play.
INT: Does it ever make you feel self-conscious that you're
like, a middle-class white boy wearing a Public Enemy T
shirt?
NIELSEN: I think what makes me self-conscious is that I get
criticized a lot for not having the best lyrical skills. And I think
that's OK, because there's a lot - like, Biggie, he doesn't have
the best skills, because you've got these words coming out of
his fat face, you know, he does it so well, but he's not like that
super-super fast. But what pisses me off is that people say I
don't have skills, and I'm trying to just be funny to get known.
I think that is not what I'm trying to do ...
... my lyrics are educated, and I'll say that proudly. But peo
ple who don't get that say, "Oh, he can't rap quickly, and he's
not rapping about typical stuff so the album's bad." That both
ers me a lot. Because you're not giving it a fair chance...
INT: So what's going on with those three songs besides
Apple?
NIELSEN: So in June, we're going to put out another EP, just
a six-song EP, those three songs and another three that I'm
working on, and hopefully that will lead to — this guy who's
organizing it, his name's Tom Gates, and he works for this
company called Network, and he's got all these ideas to get an
opening spot to support this big punk band in the summer, to
support the EP, and try to just generate press over there [in the
U.K.] and then get a deal here in the U.S. because of that. So
that's the plan. And I think it's kinda scary, but it's also excit
ing.

INT: So where did Lars Horris come from?
NIELSEN: Do you want the real one or the fake one?
INT: I want the real one.
NIELSEN: The fake one is that I tell people that I had an uncle
named Lars, but that's not true. Do you ever hear of "Heavy
weights, " that movie, it's like 96, a Disney movie? The guy
from Nickelodeon, he's in that movie. They go to a camp, and
there's a counselor named Lars, and I thought that was really
funny in sixth grade, so I took it. And Horris was, um, "Dr.
Quinn Medicine Woman," there's a barber named Horris. I
thought it was funny, because it sounded like "whores". So
when I was 12,1 thought that was funny, and so those two
names stuck with me for eight years.
INT: When did he become an alien?
NIELSEN: [laughs] That song's a metaphor, in that I'm doing a
genre that's not really about what I rap about. So then I be
came an alien that way, but I thought it'd be funny to make it
space age.

names stuck with me for eight years.
INT: When did he become an alien?
NIELSEN: [laughs] That song's a metaphor, in that I'm doing a
genre that's not really about what I rap about. So then I be
came an alien that way, but I thought it'd be funny to make it
space age.


This wristband gets me into all the parties! : MC Lars on his secret powers
The purveyor of hard core hip-hop at Stanford is junior An
drew Nielsen, an English major who performs with his band the
Androids under the name MC Lars Horris, recently abridged to
MC Lars. MC Lars raps about topics from Shakespeare to John
Brown to campus life. His album "Radio Pet Fencing" was re
leased last September in the England by the label Truck
Records, and it was just released in the United States.
INTERMISSION: How did you meet the people in Truck
Records?
NIELSEN: I did the Oxford abroad program, and that was real
ly fun. And I was performing a lot in Oxford, because they have
a really cool music scene.
INT: Better than Stanford?
NIELSEN: [laughs] So much better. Not to hate on Stanford's
scene, but we really kinda don't have one. Stanford's cool, but
I think it's also cool that Stanford offers a liaison into other
worlds. But basically I was doing the rap stuff with my laptop
because my band was all here, and eventually people started
remembering my name, so then the record labels [started tak
ing notice] — I had three labels who wanted to put this out —
and the one I went with was the one that was based in Oxford.
INT: How widely released is it going to be? Am I going to be
able to find it in Borders?
NIELSEN: If you do Borders and search the computer, it's
there, but since it's my first album, they don't have a lot of first
albums in the chains. You can just order it from Borders, but it's
pretty much only on the shelves of independent record stores.
Amoeba should have it.
INT: How did you originally get into music and recording?
NIELSEN: My first recording was when I was eight. I was just
singing into a tape recorder like this. So I was recording at 11,1
was remixing my friend's stupid rap tracks or whatever with like
stupid computer beats. But the first song I wrote came when I
was 12, and I learned guitar. And I knew three chords. So it was
like E-minor, G, D, and then like a [farting noise]. And so that's
my song for like two minutes. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-[fart]. It's called "The Gas Man."
INT: How did it wander into hip hop?
NIELSEN: That's a really great question, because I don't
know, actually. I was doing these songs just by myself, because
I was in bands and stuff, but I realized that I can sing, but I can't
sing great, but I realized like if I take my voice, I rap passably.
INT: You don't sound like what I'd expect a rapper to sound
like. But that's all right.
NIELSEN: The biggest influence for me to start rapping
was...listening to the Bloodhound Gang. I don't know if that to
tally destroys any rap credibility to say they're my influence.
Them and Insane Clown Posse, [laughs] It's terrible, huh?
INT: I noticed that in your song "Hey, That's Me" there are a lot
of in-jokes about Stanford, like "satisfying women like GERs"
and you name-check a bunch of friends. Are you worried that
that is going to come off as too in-jokey?
NIELSEN: The guy who did the music video in England re
searched all the Stanford stuff, so it has Jorge Cham and "Ph.D"
and "27th Street." I think people in England were intrigued be
cause it's like, all this American slang of this university. I don't
know, I think people really like it here, or in England, but I don't
know if it's going to catch on in the rest of the U.S. [laughs] Prob
ably not that song.
INT: Do you know how the sales are in England?
NIELSEN: Yeah, it's selling well. It's sold almost 5,000. Which is

hard. I mean, it's good for a first band, but like, a good run is like
10,000, that's when you start making anything. Not that that's
what I'm in it for, at all.
INT: You told me earlier that you might be changing your stage
name. Are you just MC Lars now?
NIELSEN: Yeah, the problem is that no one knows how to spell
or say Horris, and they think it's horse, and so Horris will just be
like an inside thing, but MC Lars will be the main thing. But Hor
ris will be in the back of the book, of the CD, or something.
INT: Tell me about this big-shot producer you're working with.
NIELSEN: Yeah, when I did the September tour, this guy read
about me and contacted me. And I met him when he was out
here and he was the manager of all these big people, whatever,
and he hooked me up with this producer who's worked with Pub
lic Enemy and he did this band Brand New, he did their first
album - they're kinda emo, [laughs] I hadn't heard of them ei
ther, but apparently they're kind of big. So he did three songs
with me over winter break. And he was really fun to work with,
a real cool guy. I'd never been in a studio before, like a real

$50,000 studio, so it was awesome.
INT: So you're a sell-out whore now?
NIELSEN: I don't know. I will be if Apple uses my song.
INT: What is it that they're trying to do?
NIELSEN: So are we allowed to — should we talk about this?
INT: Let's talk about this.
NIELSEN: OK. So one of the songs I wrote is called, "iGenera
tion." Like iPod, but it's iGeneration. And these managers have
a connection with Apple. And so I'll know next week if they're
using it or not. But they're trying to use it for an ad, for their Mac
intosh.
INT: That's cool.
NIELSEN: It's cool, but it's not what I intended. I don't want to
be doing commercials.
INT: Tell me about how your songwriting process works.

NIELSEN: Well, I'll think of something funny or surprising and
write it down in my notebook or whatever. I'll look at it in a few
days, and if I like it still I'll start writing out verses, and then try
to think of what the feel is, and then try to create a beat, and my
friend Damondrick Jack is really good with moods, like if I have
an idea for a lyric and a beat that I want to go to, he'll tell me if
he thinks it works or not. So recently it's become a really collab
orative process with him.
INT: What do you want people to take away from your songs?
How do you want to make them feel?
NIELSEN: Well, can I quote Aristotle, or is that obnoxious? It's
obnoxious, isn't it?
INT: It's obnoxious, but go ahead.
NIELSEN: In his "Poetics," he talks about catharsis, he spells it
with a "k" — that's really obnoxious — but he says the goal of
anything like that is to leave people "lighted and delighted." So
that's what I hope. Because they're funny, and because I also
want people to be educated with my songs.

INT: So with a song like "Rapbeth," you want people to come
out of it with a better knowledge of Shakespeare?
NIELSEN: Yeah, and like, a kid who's never read "Macbeth"
can summarize the plot in class. That would be awesome.
INT: Then they don't have to read the book.
NIELSEN: I mean, yeah, then when they get to college, read
the book, read the play.
INT: Does it ever make you feel self-conscious that you're
like, a middle-class white boy wearing a Public Enemy T
shirt?
NIELSEN: I think what makes me self-conscious is that I get
criticized a lot for not having the best lyrical skills. And I think
that's OK, because there's a lot - like, Biggie, he doesn't have
the best skills, because you've got these words coming out of
his fat face, you know, he does it so well, but he's not like that
super-super fast. But what pisses me off is that people say I
don't have skills, and I'm trying to just be funny to get known.
I think that is not what I'm trying to do ...
... my lyrics are educated, and I'll say that proudly. But peo
ple who don't get that say, "Oh, he can't rap quickly, and he's
not rapping about typical stuff so the album's bad." That both
ers me a lot. Because you're not giving it a fair chance...
INT: So what's going on with those three songs besides
Apple?
NIELSEN: So in June, we're going to put out another EP, just
a six-song EP, those three songs and another three that I'm
working on, and hopefully that will lead to — this guy who's
organizing it, his name's Tom Gates, and he works for this
company called Network, and he's got all these ideas to get an
opening spot to support this big punk band in the summer, to
support the EP, and try to just generate press over there [in the
U.K.] and then get a deal here in the U.S. because of that. So
that's the plan. And I think it's kinda scary, but it's also excit
ing.

INT: So where did Lars Horris come from?
NIELSEN: Do you want the real one or the fake one?
INT: I want the real one.
NIELSEN: The fake one is that I tell people that I had an uncle
named Lars, but that's not true. Do you ever hear of "Heavy
weights, " that movie, it's like 96, a Disney movie? The guy
from Nickelodeon, he's in that movie. They go to a camp, and
there's a counselor named Lars, and I thought that was really
funny in sixth grade, so I took it. And Horris was, um, "Dr.
Quinn Medicine Woman," there's a barber named Horris. I
thought it was funny, because it sounded like "whores". So
when I was 12,1 thought that was funny, and so those two
names stuck with me for eight years.
INT: When did he become an alien?
NIELSEN: [laughs] That song's a metaphor, in that I'm doing a

from Nickelodeon, he's in that movie. They go to a camp, and
there's a counselor named Lars, and I thought that was really
funny in sixth grade, so I took it. And Horris was, um, "Dr.
Quinn Medicine Woman," there's a barber named Horris. I
thought it was funny, because it sounded like "whores". So
when I was 12,1 thought that was funny, and so those two
names stuck with me for eight years.
INT: When did he become an alien?
NIELSEN: [laughs] That song's a metaphor, in that I'm doing a
genre that's not really about what I rap about. So then I be
came an alien that way, but I thought it'd be funny to make it
space age.


This wristband gets me into all the parties! : MC Lars on his secret powers
The purveyor of hard core hip-hop at Stanford is junior An
drew Nielsen, an English major who performs with his band the
Androids under the name MC Lars Horris, recently abridged to
MC Lars. MC Lars raps about topics from Shakespeare to John
Brown to campus life. His album "Radio Pet Fencing" was re
leased last September in the England by the label Truck
Records, and it was just released in the United States.
INTERMISSION: How did you meet the people in Truck
Records?
NIELSEN: I did the Oxford abroad program, and that was real
ly fun. And I was performing a lot in Oxford, because they have
a really cool music scene.
INT: Better than Stanford?
NIELSEN: [laughs] So much better. Not to hate on Stanford's
scene, but we really kinda don't have one. Stanford's cool, but
I think it's also cool that Stanford offers a liaison into other
worlds. But basically I was doing the rap stuff with my laptop
because my band was all here, and eventually people started
remembering my name, so then the record labels [started tak
ing notice] — I had three labels who wanted to put this out —
and the one I went with was the one that was based in Oxford.
INT: How widely released is it going to be? Am I going to be
able to find it in Borders?
NIELSEN: If you do Borders and search the computer, it's
there, but since it's my first album, they don't have a lot of first
albums in the chains. You can just order it from Borders, but it's
pretty much only on the shelves of independent record stores.
Amoeba should have it.
INT: How did you originally get into music and recording?
NIELSEN: My first recording was when I was eight. I was just
singing into a tape recorder like this. So I was recording at 11,1
was remixing my friend's stupid rap tracks or whatever with like
stupid computer beats. But the first song I wrote came when I
was 12, and I learned guitar. And I knew three chords. So it was
like E-minor, G, D, and then like a [farting noise]. And so that's
my song for like two minutes. Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
doo-doo-[fart]. It's called "The Gas Man."
INT: How did it wander into hip hop?
NIELSEN: That's a really great question, because I don't
know, actually. I was doing these songs just by myself, because
I was in bands and stuff, but I realized that I can sing, but I can't
sing great, but I realized like if I take my voice, I rap passably.
INT: You don't sound like what I'd expect a rapper to sound
like. But that's all right.
NIELSEN: The biggest influence for me to start rapping
was...listening to the Bloodhound Gang. I don't know if that to
tally destroys any rap credibility to say they're my influence.
Them and Insane Clown Posse, [laughs] It's terrible, huh?
INT: I noticed that in your song "Hey, That's Me" there are a lot
of in-jokes about Stanford, like "satisfying women like GERs"
and you name-check a bunch of friends. Are you worried that
that is going to come off as too in-jokey?
NIELSEN: The guy who did the music video in England re
searched all the Stanford stuff, so it has Jorge Cham and "Ph.D"
and "27th Street." I think people in England were intrigued be
cause it's like, all this American slang of this university. I don't
know, I think people really like it here, or in England, but I don't
know if it's going to catch on in the rest of the U.S. [laughs] Prob
ably not that song.
INT: Do you know how the sales are in England?
NIELSEN: Yeah, it's selling well. It's sold almost 5,000. Which is

hard. I mean, it's good for a first band, but like, a good run is like
10,000, that's when you start making anything. Not that that's
what I'm in it for, at all.
INT: You told me earlier that you might be changing your stage
name. Are you just MC Lars now?
NIELSEN: Yeah, the problem is that no one knows how to spell
or say Horris, and they think it's horse, and so Horris will just be
like an inside thing, but MC Lars will be the main thing. But Hor
ris will be in the back of the book, of the CD, or something.
INT: Tell me about this big-shot producer you're working with.
NIELSEN: Yeah, when I did the September tour, this guy read
about me and contacted me. And I met him when he was out
here and he was the manager of all these big people, whatever,
and he hooked me up with this producer who's worked with Pub
lic Enemy and he did this band Brand New, he did their first
album - they're kinda emo, [laughs] I hadn't heard of them ei
ther, but apparently they're kind of big. So he did three songs
with me over winter break. And he was really fun to work with,
a real cool guy. I'd never been in a studio before, like a real

$50,000 studio, so it was awesome.
INT: So you're a sell-out whore now?
NIELSEN: I don't know. I will be if Apple uses my song.
INT: What is it that they're trying to do?
NIELSEN: So are we allowed to — should we talk about this?
INT: Let's talk about this.
NIELSEN: OK. So one of the songs I wrote is called, "iGenera
tion." Like iPod, but it's iGeneration. And these managers have
a connection with Apple. And so I'll know next week if they're
using it or not. But they're trying to use it for an ad, for their Mac
intosh.
INT: That's cool.
NIELSEN: It's cool, but it's not what I intended. I don't want to
be doing commercials.
INT: Tell me about how your songwriting process works.

NIELSEN: Well, I'll think of something funny or surprising and
write it down in my notebook or whatever. I'll look at it in a few
days, and if I like it still I'll start writing out verses, and then try
to think of what the feel is, and then try to create a beat, and my
friend Damondrick Jack is really good with moods, like if I have
an idea for a lyric and a beat that I want to go to, he'll tell me if
he thinks it works or not. So recently it's become a really collab
orative process with him.
INT: What do you want people to take away from your songs?
How do you want to make them feel?
NIELSEN: Well, can I quote Aristotle, or is that obnoxious? It's
obnoxious, isn't it?
INT: It's obnoxious, but go ahead.
NIELSEN: In his "Poetics," he talks about catharsis, he spells it
with a "k" — that's really obnoxious — but he says the goal of
anything like that is to leave people "lighted and delighted." So
that's what I hope. Because they're funny, and because I also
want people to be educated with my songs.

INT: So with a song like "Rapbeth," you want people to come
out of it with a better knowledge of Shakespeare?
NIELSEN: Yeah, and like, a kid who's never read "Macbeth"
can summarize the plot in class. That would be awesome.
INT: Then they don't have to read the book.
NIELSEN: I mean, yeah, then when they get to college, read
the book, read the play.
INT: Does it ever make you feel self-conscious that you're
like, a middle-class white boy wearing a Public Enemy T
shirt?
NIELSEN: I think what makes me self-conscious is that I get
criticized a lot for not having the best lyrical skills. And I think
that's OK, because there's a lot - like, Biggie, he doesn't have
the best skills, because you've got these words coming out of
his fat face, you know, he does it so well, but he's not like that
super-super fast. But what pisses me off is that people say I
don't have skills, and I'm trying to just be funny to get known.
I think that is not what I'm trying to do ...
... my lyrics are educated, and I'll say that proudly. But peo
ple who don't get that say, "Oh, he can't rap quickly, and he's
not rapping about typical stuff so the album's bad." That both
ers me a lot. Because you're not giving it a fair chance...
INT: So what's going on with those three songs besides
Apple?
NIELSEN: So in June, we're going to put out another EP, just
a six-song EP, those three songs and another three that I'm
working on, and hopefully that will lead to — this guy who's
organizing it, his name's Tom Gates, and he works for this
company called Network, and he's got all these ideas to get an
opening spot to support this big punk band in the summer, to
support the EP, and try to just generate press over there [in the
U.K.] and then get a deal here in the U.S. because of that. So
that's the plan. And I think it's kinda scary, but it's also excit
ing.

INT: So where did Lars Horris come from?
NIELSEN: Do you want the real one or the fake one?
INT: I want the real one.
NIELSEN: The fake one is that I tell people that I had an uncle
named Lars, but that's not true. Do you ever hear of "Heavy
weights, " that movie, it's like 96, a Disney movie? The guy
from Nickelodeon, he's in that movie. They go to a camp, and
there's a counselor named Lars, and I thought that was really
