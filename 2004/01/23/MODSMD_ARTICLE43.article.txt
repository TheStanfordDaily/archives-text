BEVERLY HILLS — Celebrities here
can rest easier now because Ashton Kutch
er ain't going to "punk" them anymore.
The 25-year-old actor confirmed earlier
this month that he was calling it quits on
the MTV show "Punk'd" after this season.

"I am giving it up," Kutcher said. "Why give it up? Why not
do a sequel to 'Dude, Where's my Car' and make a lotta lotta of
money. Why not? Because I want to do something different.
Part of this is for me. I get off on coming up with new ideas and
playing new characters. I derive great joy out of that."

Kutcher made the announcement at the Four Seasons in
Beverly Hills while promoting his new drama "The Butterfly
Effect" with co-star Amy Smart.
"You know what's really crazy?" Kutcher asked a room
full of journalists. "When I started 'That '70s Show,' I didn't
know what a pilot was. I didn't know that shows got made that
didn't go to air and weren't successful. All the shows that I
watched were on for five, seven years — I watched 'The
Cosby Show,' I watched 'Roseanne.'
"I didn't watch shows that got canceled. So I didn't even
know that shows got canceled."
MTV picked up Kutcher's series "Punk'd" last year. The
show is an updated version of "Candid Camera," with gags
targeted at celebrities such as Justin Timberlake, Halle Berry
and Nick Lachey.
"We worked and worked and worked and it caught on,"
Kutcher said. "We made up a word. And people liked it and
people got it. You know, they took enjoyment from seeing
that somebody was having a worse day than they are."
In "The Butterfly Effect," Kutcher takes on a more seri
ous role — as 20-something Evan Treborn who travels back
in time to change the future and reunite with the woman he
loves (Smart).
The film's writers / directors, Eric Bress and J. Mackye
Gruber, said they were at first reluctant to cast Kutcher, known
until now for his comedic performances, in a dramatic film.
"When we were heard Ashton Kutcher, we said, 'No way,'
" Gruber said. "We were forced to have a meeting with him at
his house, and his insight into the character was amazing."
Bress added, "He didn't look anything like the clean
shaven guy. He had a lot of traits we envisioned for the char
acter. A lot of it is on faith. More than any other actor, he was
the guy."
Kutcher said he was attracted to what he saw as a deeper
significance in the role.
"I thought it was an original idea," Kutcher said. "I
thought the characters' deficiencies are a great metaphor for
society in general. He blacks out his traumatic moments and I
think as a society we black out traumatic moments. We don't
want to think about violence that goes on in the world."
Kutcher also cleared up a false rumor published in a tabloid
that he was dumped as the lead in "Elizabethtown" because di
rector Cameron Crowe was appalled by his acting ability.
"I started working with Cameron on it," Kutcher said. "I
idolize [him]. And Cameron decided that he wanted to shoot
the film in the spring and the timing was off. And I had already
shot several episodes of 'That '70s Show,' to back out was vir
tually impossible. And I wouldn't have had the time to get
ready for the role."
Orlando Bloom is reportedly in negotiations to take over
the role opposite Kirsten Dunst.
"The Butterfly Effect" opens today nationwide. The com
plete first season of "Punk'd" is now available on DVD.
