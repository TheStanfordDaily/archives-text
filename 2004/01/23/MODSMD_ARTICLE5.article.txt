### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Monday, Stanford's Institute for Interna
tional Studies will bring together a panel of five of
the University's leading foreign policy experts to
discuss the current situation in Iraq. The discus
sion, titled "What Are We Doing in Iraq?" will at
tempt to gauge how the situation in Iraq is pro
gressing after almost eight months of Coalition
control.
On May 1, President George W. Bush declared the
end of major combat operations in Iraq. Since then,
news of the politics and the nearly daily bloodshed oc
curring in Iraq have inundated the American media,
making the occupation of Iraq one of today's most
talked-about issues.
According to Klas Bergman, the associate director
for communications at the institute, the panelists,
composed of scholars from the Institute for Interna
tional Studies and the Hoover Institution, were cho
sen because their areas of expertise vary, so that the
panel will provide a sweeping view of the situation in
Iraq.
"We chose a panel we think will be able to cover
various aspects [of the situation]," Bergman said.

"They can give an idea of how we're doing after al
most a year in Iraq."
Two members of the panel, Political Science
Prof. Coit D. Blacker and International Relations
Prof. Stephen D. Krasner, are former members of
the National Security Council. Blacker, the mod
erator of the panel, worked in the White House
during the Clinton Administration and will dis
cuss U.S. foreign policy in relation to Iraq. Kras
ner is a democracy / regime-building expert, and
will evaluate the success of the efforts to rebuild
Iraq. Krasner worked on the council in 2002,
under Bush.
Business Prof. John McMillan will cover the
economic aspect of Iraq. The other two pan
elists, Profs. Donald K. Emmerson and
Michael McFaul, will provide insight into how
the rest of the world perceives the Iraq situa
tion. Emmerson is an Asia expert who deals
with Muslim nations such as Indonesia, and
McFaul is a Russia expert who also deals with
the Middle East.
The panel discussion will take place from 4:30
p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Bechtel Conference Center. It
is open to the public.
