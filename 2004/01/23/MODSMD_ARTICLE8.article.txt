## HERE COMES THE SUN 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Although I haven't investigated many engi
neers' rooms in my two years at Stanford, it
would be hard to find a dorm room more ob
viously inhabited by two engineers than that
of Eerik Hantsoo and Ad Shelton.
Last night, when I went to talk to them
about their experiences with the Stanford
Solar Car Project, I walked into a sparsely dec
orated dorm room, typical apart from a no
ticeably lower-than-average ceiling.
The abbreviated headroom is the result of
a jury-rigged loft: On either side of the room
stands a metal frame, and across them a thick
slab of wood forms a pseudo-ceiling. Or, more
appropriately, a pseudo-floor, for this is where
Hantsoo and Shelton lay their mathematics
and-fluid-dynamics-filled heads at night.
This kind of entrepreneurial engineering is
what drives Hantsoo (whose first name, Eerik,
is not a typo — it's Estonian), Shelton and
their friend and fellow Solar Car group mem
ber, Brian Belmont.
The three juniors have been involved with
the Stanford Solar Car Project since their
freshman year, when the fringe group boasted
a roster of only six members. Today its ranks
have more than trebled, and its dedicated
members successfully completed the 2,300-
mile Chicago-to-Los Angeles solar car race
last summer.
The 10-day race is "a Tour de France-type
race" along hilly route 66, Belmont said.
What kind of masochists would spend 2,300
miles in a solar car built by undergraduates?
one might ask.
"Solar racing is for kind of a funny breed,"
Hantsoo admits.
From making molds for the car's chassis,
designing its electrical systems and tinkering
with its aerodynamics (most of which took
place in their freshman year) to the actual
building of the machine (which wasn't even

entirely finished by the day of the race), the
three juniors and the club's other members
have dedicated a substantial portion of their
undergraduate career to a metal monster
that feeds off the sun's rays.
When I asked the three how much time
they dedicated to the car, I got chuckles.
"At one point, I was spending 80 to 90
hours a week in the machine shop," Shelton
said. While his was an extreme case, others
routinely put in 40 hours a week last spring,
as the July event drew nearer.
For much of the designing and building
time, the amateur carbuilders had only
themselves to rely on for information and in
novation. Occasionally, they got some help.
"We needed to learn how to use carbon
fiber because no one on the team knew how
to use it," Belmont said.
The team members contacted profession
als, and at one point drove a van down to
Boeing's Long Beach facilities to consults
with an expert working on "high-end, top
secret aerospace stuff," Hantsoo said.
"As we were leaving, he was like, 'Hey,
I've got a bunch of carbon fiber we were
going to throw out,"' Hantsoo told me. The
college kids ended up filling their van with
$50,000 of carbon fiber for the 400-mile
drive back to Stanford.
In total, the group received about $200,000
of in-kind donations from various sources.
The petty cash came from special fees, and the
group's adviser, John Bravman, helped them
secure some extra funds from sources like the
School of Engineering. The grunt work, how
ever, was all theirs.
In the short span of time between the end
of last school year and the July 3 departure
date, the group spent long hours in their shop
on Stock Farm Road.
"We had three tents on the roof," Shelton
said. "A couple of people slept on couches in
the same place we hacksawed stuff. We lived
off Chef Boyardee for about three weeks."

The smelly group members snuck showers in
random unoccupied dorms.
In many ways, the race itself was anticli
mactic. I asked them, "How did you guys do in
the race?"
"It depends on — " started Hantsoo.
"It doesn't depend on anything," Belmont
interrupted. "We didn't do well."
The group finished 15th out of 20 cars ("We
did beat Cal, though," Belmont made sure to
note) and accumulated a whopping 12-hour

penalty from just one battery fire.
"All cars were supposed to start at once,"
Belmont said. "Ours broke down, so we were
stuck there waiting." What's more, this aggra
vation came right after having to replace a
complicated, innovative braking system
(using "downhill mountain bike disc brakes,"
Shelton, the system's designer, said) with an
older, clunkier system in just eight hours. The
newer system had taken a full month to install.
"We ended up pushing the car up a lot of
hills when the car stalled due to lack of
power," Hantsoo added.
The group's rented 24-foot Ryder truck,
which followed the solar car on its journey,
had, luckily enough, been jam-packed with
tools.
"We basically packed the entire shop into
the truck," Hantsoo said. "And we ended up
needing pretty much everything in the truck."
By the end of the race, the car's designers
were happy simply to have finished. Solar cars
from other schools, such as Yale and Univer
sity of Michigan, didn't even pass the qualifi
cation round. And, despite the less-than-best
finish, Hantsoo and friends have no regrets.
"It was one of the most valuable learning
experiences I've ever had," he said. "If I
didn't do the numbers or the bonds right, my
friend Addison's sitting in the seat, going 85
m.p.h. It's his ass."
"Literally," added Ad with a smile.
Now, for a while at least, the Stanford Solar
Car Project is, ironically enough, turning its
back on the world of solar power. Their
newest, crazy-sounding idea is to build an
electric car and break the world distance
record of 450 miles on one battery charge.
"We think we can go 2,000 miles at 40
m.p.h.," Hantsoo said, almost conspiratorial
iy-
Their plan? Fit 10,000 lithium ion batteries,
each about twice the size of a AA, into a car
similar to the one they raced last summer. The
1,000 pounds of batteries should, they believe,
hold the juice of five times that amount of reg
ular lead acid car batteries.
"The goal is to have a car running some
time this summer," Hantsoo said.

$50,000 of carbon fiber for the 400-mile
drive back to Stanford.
In total, the group received about $200,000
of in-kind donations from various sources.
The petty cash came from special fees, and the
group's adviser, John Bravman, helped them
secure some extra funds from sources like the
School of Engineering. The grunt work, how
ever, was all theirs.
In the short span of time between the end
of last school year and the July 3 departure
date, the group spent long hours in their shop
on Stock Farm Road.
"We had three tents on the roof," Shelton
said. "A couple of people slept on couches in
the same place we hacksawed stuff. We lived
off Chef Boyardee for about three weeks."

The smelly group members snuck showers in
random unoccupied dorms.
In many ways, the race itself was anticli
mactic. I asked them, "How did you guys do in
the race?"
"It depends on — " started Hantsoo.
"It doesn't depend on anything," Belmont
interrupted. "We didn't do well."
The group finished 15th out of 20 cars ("We
did beat Cal, though," Belmont made sure to
note) and accumulated a whopping 12-hour

penalty from just one battery fire.
"All cars were supposed to start at once,"
Belmont said. "Ours broke down, so we were
stuck there waiting." What's more, this aggra
vation came right after having to replace a
complicated, innovative braking system
(using "downhill mountain bike disc brakes,"
Shelton, the system's designer, said) with an
older, clunkier system in just eight hours. The
newer system had taken a full month to install.
"We ended up pushing the car up a lot of
hills when the car stalled due to lack of
power," Hantsoo added.
The group's rented 24-foot Ryder truck,
which followed the solar car on its journey,
had, luckily enough, been jam-packed with
tools.
"We basically packed the entire shop into
the truck," Hantsoo said. "And we ended up
needing pretty much everything in the truck."
By the end of the race, the car's designers
were happy simply to have finished. Solar cars
from other schools, such as Yale and Univer
sity of Michigan, didn't even pass the qualifi
cation round. And, despite the less-than-best
finish, Hantsoo and friends have no regrets.
"It was one of the most valuable learning
experiences I've ever had," he said. "If I
didn't do the numbers or the bonds right, my
friend Addison's sitting in the seat, going 85
m.p.h. It's his ass."
"Literally," added Ad with a smile.
Now, for a while at least, the Stanford Solar
Car Project is, ironically enough, turning its
back on the world of solar power. Their
newest, crazy-sounding idea is to build an
electric car and break the world distance
record of 450 miles on one battery charge.
"We think we can go 2,000 miles at 40
m.p.h.," Hantsoo said, almost conspiratorial
iy-
Their plan? Fit 10,000 lithium ion batteries,
each about twice the size of a AA, into a car
similar to the one they raced last summer. The
1,000 pounds of batteries should, they believe,
hold the juice of five times that amount of reg
ular lead acid car batteries.
"The goal is to have a car running some
time this summer," Hantsoo said.

Although I haven't investigated many engi
neers' rooms in my two years at Stanford, it
would be hard to find a dorm room more ob
viously inhabited by two engineers than that
of Eerik Hantsoo and Ad Shelton.
Last night, when I went to talk to them
about their experiences with the Stanford
Solar Car Project, I walked into a sparsely dec
orated dorm room, typical apart from a no
ticeably lower-than-average ceiling.
The abbreviated headroom is the result of
a jury-rigged loft: On either side of the room
stands a metal frame, and across them a thick
slab of wood forms a pseudo-ceiling. Or, more
appropriately, a pseudo-floor, for this is where
Hantsoo and Shelton lay their mathematics
and-fluid-dynamics-filled heads at night.
This kind of entrepreneurial engineering is
what drives Hantsoo (whose first name, Eerik,
is not a typo — it's Estonian), Shelton and
their friend and fellow Solar Car group mem
ber, Brian Belmont.
The three juniors have been involved with
the Stanford Solar Car Project since their
freshman year, when the fringe group boasted
a roster of only six members. Today its ranks
have more than trebled, and its dedicated
members successfully completed the 2,300-
mile Chicago-to-Los Angeles solar car race
last summer.
The 10-day race is "a Tour de France-type
race" along hilly route 66, Belmont said.
What kind of masochists would spend 2,300
miles in a solar car built by undergraduates?
one might ask.
"Solar racing is for kind of a funny breed,"
Hantsoo admits.
From making molds for the car's chassis,
designing its electrical systems and tinkering
with its aerodynamics (most of which took
place in their freshman year) to the actual
building of the machine (which wasn't even

entirely finished by the day of the race), the
three juniors and the club's other members
have dedicated a substantial portion of their
undergraduate career to a metal monster
that feeds off the sun's rays.
When I asked the three how much time
they dedicated to the car, I got chuckles.
"At one point, I was spending 80 to 90
hours a week in the machine shop," Shelton
said. While his was an extreme case, others
routinely put in 40 hours a week last spring,
as the July event drew nearer.
For much of the designing and building
time, the amateur carbuilders had only
themselves to rely on for information and in
novation. Occasionally, they got some help.
"We needed to learn how to use carbon
fiber because no one on the team knew how
to use it," Belmont said.
The team members contacted profession
als, and at one point drove a van down to
Boeing's Long Beach facilities to consults
with an expert working on "high-end, top
secret aerospace stuff," Hantsoo said.
"As we were leaving, he was like, 'Hey,
I've got a bunch of carbon fiber we were
going to throw out,"' Hantsoo told me. The
college kids ended up filling their van with
$50,000 of carbon fiber for the 400-mile
drive back to Stanford.
