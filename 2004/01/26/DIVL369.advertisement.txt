Making Great
Water Better!
Starting February 2,2004
The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which provides domestic water to the
Stanford community, is switching from chlorine to chloramine disinfectant in order to
ensure that our drinking water always meets the highest standards.
Benefits will include longer lasting disinfection and fewer disinfection
by-products.
Important information for users who have fish or amphibians or need
highly processed water is located at web site listed below.
