# Cardinal presides over centennial mass
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, Cardinal Rodriguez
Mardiaga of Honduras processed
into Memorial Church for the
largest Catholic ceremony ever
held at Stanford, a centennial mass
that marked the Catholic Commu
nity's 100 years of service at the
University.
The Cardinal, speculated by
many to be Pope John Paul II's suc
cessor, presided over the mass in full
splendor with the Archbishop of San
Francisco and about 20 other mem
bers of the clergy.
A cohesive community
The huge turnout was a testament
to the growth of the Catholic com
munity at Stanford. In 1903, the
Stanford Newman Club was found
ed in the basement of St. Thomas
Aquinas Church in Palo Alto to
meet the needs of Catholics at Stan
ford. At that time, Catholics repre
sented a small minority on campus
and, like other religious groups,
could not celebrate denominational
services on campus.
Over the past century, Catholics
have worked with the University to
not only offer students and faculty
the opportunity to attend mass on
campus but also to be a part of a co
hesive community, according to or
ganizers of the event.
Now an estimated 30 percent to
40 percent of Stanford students and
faculty identify themselves as
Roman Catholics, making Catholi
cism the most-represented religious
group at Stanford. More than 800
students and faculty attend mass on
campus each week, at one of the
three Sunday celebrations.
The Catholic community, run by
an 11-person staff with two Domini

can priests and three chaplains in the
Old Union Clubhouse, offers reli
gious education classes, faith forma
tion groups, retreats, community
service projects and fun events like
ski trips and beach days.
Each year, the community bap
tizes about 50 infants and 10 adults,
confirms about 25 students and fac
ulty members, and weds about 75
couples.

Once marginalized, now
recognized
But the community was not al
ways this strong.
The Newman Club moved from
St. Thomas Aquinas Church to St.
Anne's Chapel in Palo Alto in 1952.
With mass off campus, attendance
rates were low and the community
was not very developed.
"I felt like religious people were

marginalized and off to the side at
that time," said Chaplain Nancy
Greenfield, who came to Stanford in
1968. "Now, the University has a
greater understanding of the impor
tance of religion and of different at
titudes of finding faith."
Change began slowly in 1966,
when Davie Napier, then Dean of
Chapel at Stanford, changed the
University's charter to allow denom-

inational services at Stanford. The focus
slowly shifted from St. Anne's to mass on
campus, and the number of Catholics at
Stanford grew as the school's applicants
were drawn from more diverse backgrounds.
In 1997, the Catholic community at Stan
ford was made a personal parish in its own
right in the Diocese of San Jose.
"The move from St. Anne's changed the
whole ministry," said Greenfield. "The
Catholic Community now has a unique role
here at Stanford. We're neither plugged in
like we would be at a catholic university nor
patched on like we used to be off campus,
and we have advantages either way."
"Its great that the community allows our
young people to find faith and make it their
own faith," said University President John
Hennessy, a practicing Catholic and member
of the Catholic community at Stanford.
"That is what we want for all students re
gardless of faith — the opportunity to dis
cover their own faith and to grow and mature
as adults."
Medical School Prof. Russ Altman and
his wife have noticed a great deal of growth
in the Catholic community since they came
to Stanford in the early 1980s. When their
oldest child, now 15, needed religious educa
tion, the parents created an ad hoc group to
fulfill the need. Now, their 8-year-old daugh
ter attends an established religious educa
tion program coordinated by Sister Gloria
Jones.
The Catholic community today
Over the past three years that Jones has
been at Stanford, she has helped the com
munity grow by organizing faith formation
groups for undergraduates, graduates,
young adults and permanent community
members.
In these small groups of about seven,
"students have a place to integrate their life
here and their faith; a place to question and
to build stronger relationships with God and
one another," Jones said.
"I have been a member of a small faith
community for a year now," said sophomore
Brian Payer. "It has been a chance for me to
learn about my faith, share experiences, dis
cuss ideas and problems. Most importantly,
my small group is a great support network. I
know that I can turn to my guys with any
thing and they will do whatever they can to

help me out."
Student-oriented services
Central to the Catholic experience at
Stanford is Sunday mass.
"Our Sundays are what keeps people com
ing back," Greenfield said. "For those stu
dents at Stanford who want to connect with
their religious heritage, it's very important
that when they choose to do so, they experi
ence the best that the religion has to offer."
Sunday mass at 4:30 p.m. in Memorial
Church is usually packed, and latecomers
often have to stand or find seats in the bal
cony. Homilies during mass, given by both
priests and female Chaplains Greenfield,
Jones and Theresa Pleins, are geared toward
the lives of Stanford students.
"The preachers have an uncanny ability
to speak directly to the students' needs, and
the staff will bend over backwards to accom
modate what the students want," Payer said.
For example, undergraduates expressed
an interest in having a candlelight mass at 10
p.m. to cater to the typical late-night student
schedule. The staff followed through with
the idea, and, although attendance started
out slow, it "has grown so much that the con
gregation spills out of the side chapel into the
main church," Payer said.
"Our job is to give a good experience of
church to students that they can take with
them when they leave," said Father Patrick
LaBelle. "We don't want them to just whine
that services are not as good once they leave
Stanford, which they often do, but for them
to reproduce what they've seen here."
Jeannie Kahwajy, Class of 2000, did just
that when she moved to Switzerland. She was
not satisfied with the ministry in her English
speaking church in Lausanne, Switzerland, so
she and two other Stanford alumni decided to
become more involved in the parish.
"We call it our little Stanford Annex,"
said Kahwajy, who came to Stanford this
weekend for the centennial celebration.
The celebration included a gala dinner
and dance on Saturday night and will con
clude with a lecture tonight at 7:30 p.m. by the
Cardinal on the solidarity of globalization.
At the gala on Saturday, the community
— complete with priests, nuns and brothers
— was dancing polkas and swing numbers to
live music with students, alumni and faculty
members.
"The community is bound by the spirit of
Jesus alive within us," Jones said between
dances. "That spirit is the source of our
unity; it is what we celebrate and share and
meet in one another."
