# Cardinal presides over centennial mass
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday, Cardinal Rodriguez
Mardiaga of Honduras processed
into Memorial Church for the
largest Catholic ceremony ever
held at Stanford, a centennial mass
that marked the Catholic Commu
nity's 100 years of service at the
University.
The Cardinal, speculated by
many to be Pope John Paul II's suc
cessor, presided over the mass in full
splendor with the Archbishop of San
Francisco and about 20 other mem
bers of the clergy.
A cohesive community
The huge turnout was a testament
to the growth of the Catholic com
munity at Stanford. In 1903, the
Stanford Newman Club was found
ed in the basement of St. Thomas
Aquinas Church in Palo Alto to
meet the needs of Catholics at Stan
ford. At that time, Catholics repre
sented a small minority on campus
and, like other religious groups,
could not celebrate denominational
services on campus.
Over the past century, Catholics
have worked with the University to
not only offer students and faculty
the opportunity to attend mass on
campus but also to be a part of a co
hesive community, according to or
ganizers of the event.
Now an estimated 30 percent to
40 percent of Stanford students and
faculty identify themselves as
Roman Catholics, making Catholi
cism the most-represented religious
group at Stanford. More than 800
students and faculty attend mass on
campus each week, at one of the
three Sunday celebrations.
The Catholic community, run by
an 11-person staff with two Domini

can priests and three chaplains in the
Old Union Clubhouse, offers reli
gious education classes, faith forma
tion groups, retreats, community
service projects and fun events like
ski trips and beach days.
Each year, the community bap
tizes about 50 infants and 10 adults,
confirms about 25 students and fac
ulty members, and weds about 75
couples.

Once marginalized, now
recognized
But the community was not al
ways this strong.
The Newman Club moved from
St. Thomas Aquinas Church to St.
Anne's Chapel in Palo Alto in 1952.
With mass off campus, attendance
rates were low and the community
was not very developed.
"I felt like religious people were

marginalized and off to the side at
that time," said Chaplain Nancy
Greenfield, who came to Stanford in
1968. "Now, the University has a
greater understanding of the impor
tance of religion and of different at
titudes of finding faith."
Change began slowly in 1966,
when Davie Napier, then Dean of
Chapel at Stanford, changed the
University's charter to allow denom-
