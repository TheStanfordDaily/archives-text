## Rodriguez a great speaker choice 
### 
This week, the Catholic Communi
ty at Stanford is celebrating its
centennial. Yesterday, Oscar An
dres Cardinal Rodriguez Maradi
aga, archbishop of Tegucigualpa, Hon
duras, former president of the Confer
ence of Latin American Bishops and one
of the most talked-about names to suc
ceed Pope John Paul II concelebrated
mass with Archbishop William J. Levada
of San Francisco and other local bishops.
Today, Rodriguez will speak to the Stan
ford community at 7:30 p.m. in Memorial
Church in a lecture entitled "The Solidar
ity of Globalization."
The choice of the Catholic Community
at Stanford to bring a prominent cleric
who has fought for ethical globalization
to campus enhances the lives of students
of all faiths. More than simply a celebra
tion of the 100th anniversary of one
faith's presence on campus, this event has
been transformed into a great learning
opportunity.
Rodriguez serves as an example of pub

lic service at its finest. More than 20 years
ago, when he was a bishop in the south of
Honduras, he worked with local farmers
to shelter thousands of refugees that had
poured into the country fleeing civil war
in El Salvador.
In the 1990s, he served as the Vatican's
emissary to the International Monetary
Fund, where he worked tirelessly for the
relief of third-world debt. And recently,
he has begun initiatives to partner
Catholic hospitals in Honduras with char
ity organizations in order to provide bet
ter health care to the poor.
We applaud Rodriguez for his work on
behalf of the poor and underprivileged,
and we think that the Catholic Communi
ty at Stanford has served the entire Uni
versity community well by bringing such a
prominent and active man to speak on
campus. We hope that the Catholic Com
munity will continue to bring such engag
ing speakers to the students, faculty and
staff of Stanford, and that other campus
groups will follow suit.
