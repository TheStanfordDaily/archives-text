## JENNIE FROM THE BLOCK The
						Dems need to get it together 
### 
I hate to admit it, but I'm not a
member of any organized po
litical party. I'm just a regis
tered Democrat.
So I watched the showdown in
Iowa with bated breath, hoping
that a new, more united Democrat
ic Party would somehow emerge.
No such luck, but the outcome has
helped narrow the playing field
considerably. Dick Gephardt and
Carol Moseley Braun are out (sigh,
I really believed they were "in it to
win it"), while Sens. John Kerry
and John Edwards surprised us all,
finishing comfortably ahead of
front-runner Gov. Howard Dean.
It seems that in the battle be
tween the head and the heart, vot
ers in Iowa went with Kerry's well
coiffed head. In response to his dis
appointing third-place finish,
bleeding heart Dean used the con
cession podium to FREAK OUT
in the creepiest nationally televised
pre-election address since Nixon's
Checkers speech.
(Memo to Dean: "CALI
FOOORNIA" and "NEWYORK!"
may very well be cool places to visit,
but no one needs to be this excited
about "goin' to SOUTH DA-KOH
TAAAA and ORRREGON!")
But the biggest winner of the
Iowa Caucus — besides the mak
ers of Red Bull energy drinks —
was Sen. Edwards of North Caroli
na, who jumped from Sharptonville
to second, and now poses a serious
threat to the Kerry campaign.
The come-from-behind Car
olinian versus the Massachusetts fa

vorite? It's like some kind of mystic
parallel to the Panthers versus the

Patriots. And ac
cording to the
highly scientific
Super Bowl The
ory of Democratic
Primaries, which I
just made up right
now, whoever
wins the game on
Sunday will win
the election. So
Tom Brady better
not fuck up.

I have nothing against Edwards,
but he still has plenty of time to gain
the candidacy; for now, he'd best
serve as a youthful vice president. In
Washington, where Strom Thur
mond actually died years before
anybody noticed, the 50-year-old
Edwards must look like Ashton
Kutcher.
Understandably, Edwards is op
posed to being prematurely singled
out as Kerry's running mate, and
not just because of the confusion
that will inevitably result since
they're both named John. When
Bill Maher asked him about such a
ticket last week, Edwards said petu
lantly, "But I don't want to be vice
president. I want to be president."
I hope the resolve behind that
statement goes the way of "I'm in it
to win it," because a Kerry / Ed
wards ticket would be ideal. To
gether, the senators possess the
two qualities absolutely necessary
for a successful Democratic presi
dential bid, which is best expressed

in an easy-to-remember rhyme:
Must be Southern (Edwards),
please not McGovern (Kerry).
Despite his waffling stance on
the war in Iraq, Kerry's not so ill in
tentioned as he is centrist. Back in
'71, after serving as a lieutenant in
Vietnam, Kerry asked the U.S. Sen
ate Committee of Foreign Rela
tions, "How do you ask a man to be
the last man to die in 1 Vietnam?
How do you ask a man to be the last
man to die for a mistake?" Then he
took all his war medals and threw
them in Nixon's fat face (symboli
cally, that is). I'm fairly convinced
that he still has a soul.
I'm not writing off Dean's candi
dacy just yet —it doesn't look
good for him though. If the polls
are accurate, and they never are,
Kerry ought to have an easy win in
New Hampshire tomorrow. Dean
had an impressive lead in the state
less than two weeks ago; a loss
would devastate his campaign.
But there will be an X-factor in
New Hampshire: Gen. Wesley
Clark, the only other Democratic
candidate who served in Vietnam,
could seriously cut into Kerry's
lead. I'll save my opinions on him
until after the votes are tallied. In
stead, I'll leave you with my fa
vorite Wes Clark quote, courtesy of
Rolling Stone Magazine: "I don't
know much about hip-hop. But I
do know OutKast can make you
shake it like a Polaroid picture."
