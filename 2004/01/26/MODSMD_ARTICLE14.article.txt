'Loveline' event helped to raise
awareness about serious issues

I'm writing to echo Becky
Neil's criticism printed in the
paper last Thursday ("'Loveline'
hosts are welcome guests," Jan.
22) of The Daily editorial
("'Loveline' crew the best we
can get?", Jan. 21), which
scorned the ASSU Speaker Bu
reau's choice of the Loveline
hosts. After attending the event,
I firmly believe that these criti
cisms are informed by an anti
quated disdain for popular cul
ture as a valid form of study and
framework for understanding
human behavior and a fear of
open sexuality that still pervades
much of American society.
Although it is only in recent
history that intellectuals began
studying popular culture and
media in the same way that ob
jects of "high culture" (litera
ture, art, architecture, music,
etc.) have always been examined
and viewed as tools of under
standing, it seems to me that
Stanford students would recog
nize the value of exposure to and
engagement with the hosts of a
show that is enormously popular
among American teenagers and
young adults — therefore re
vealing something about mod
ern American culture — and
that was revolutionary in its be
ginnings for its frankness about
issues of sexuality, drugs, rela
tionships, depression and self
esteem. If there are courses at

Stanford that study the Simp
sons, horror films, Eminem, co
medians, Seinfeld and "Rock,
Sex, and Rebellion," it seems to
me that not only has the intellec
tual world embraced popular
culture as a means of gaining
greater intimacy with the de
sires, fears and values of human
beings, but that being a modern
(and might I add, truly educat
ed) individual signifies being fa
miliar with and looking for
meaning in communicative
forms beyond politics or aca
demics and not just in "impor
tant figures" like Barbara Boxer
or Cruz Bustamante.
Furthermore, in a world
where the frank discussion of
sexuality, particular for tradi
tionally ignored groups, is still
smothered by Puritanism, it
hardly seems shameful to have a
night — no matter the specific
content that ends up being ad
dressed — in which the sole
purpose is to discuss openly and
honestly the sexual and identity
issues facing today's youth. As
Beckly correctly argued, it is not
enough just to have a SHPRC
on campus. To truly embrace
sexuality as normal, healthy and
a> valid motivation for discus
sion, we need more than a base
ment room in the new Vaden
Health Center that passes out
condoms and lubricant; we need
moments exactly like the
"Loveline" event to bring sexu
ality out from the dark and into
the open.

Given their own lack of illu
mination on this issue, I pose the
question back to the editorial
board: Are you "the best we
[Stanford students] can get?"

Rose story could have been
reported oy high schoolers

As a working journalist, I was
dismayed to read a column in
The Daily describing as "a les
son in journalistic integrity" a
high school newspaper's deci
sion not to print Pete Rose's ap
parent admission — more than
a year ago — that he gambled
on baseball, despite his many
earlier denials ("A lesson in
journalistic integrity," Jan. 20).
This column confuses ethics
with politeness. Guest colum
nist Patrick Mattimore quotes
the co-editor of The Calabasas
Courier saying the paper didn't
run the story "out of respect,"
since Rose agreed to speak to
the class because he was
friends with one of the stu
dents' parents.
"In other words," Mattimore
writes, "the [Calabasas] news
paper made a conscious deci
sion to bury a really big story
for ethical reasons."
Um, no. The newspaper made
a conscious decision to put a per
sonal friendship and "courtesy"
before a really big story. It failed
to report new information on an

issue that affects whether a base
ball legend should be in the Hall
of Fame or not.
Now, don't get me wrong. The
decline of manners in our soci
ety is truly regretable, and being
polite and tactful is commend
able. For example, I always
make it a point to say "Excuse
me, senator," before inquiring
about an elected official's Swiss
bank accounts.
However, courtesy is not syn
onymous with ethics, even if the
two are not mutually exclusive.
Mattimore rightly criticized
such journalistic atrocities as
the distorted partial-quote and
the misleading headline. Our
professional ethics deplore such
gaffes, most especially if they
are intentional. However,
Rose's videotaped speech,
while less-than-definitive, was
enough to warrant a story with
out any twisting whatsoever:
"You mean, why did I bet on
baseball? Well, it was because I
made mistakes. I made mis
takes. You know, when you do
something, you think you're not
going to get caught. It's not like
I'm the only guy in the world to
gamble."
Unless Rose specified that
his speech to the journalism
class was off the record, there
would be nothing unethical in
reporting it. In fact, passing on
the story was, at best, an ama
teuristic oversight. At worst, it
was favoritism and dereliction
of duty. Sure, it's just a high

school paper, so why pick on
them? Fair enough. No one ex
pects 17-year-olds to do the
same work as professionals.
But please, do not hold this up
as an example of integrity. Imag
ine if a newspaper's editorial
board declined to report on a
president's admission of miscon
duct because he gave it an exclu
sive interview. Polite and courte
ous that may be, but certainly
not ethical — and no lesson in
integrity.

'Gay nuptials' column
misses Icey rationale

While Vinni Intersimone's
column ("Gay nuptials should be
recognized," Jan. 22) provides
several strong arguments for the
legalization of gay marriage, it
fails to bring up the most obvious
argument. Intersimone states,
"[Marriage] was first established
by religious tradition, first prac
ticed between men and women.
But institutions change as soci
eties change." The most signifi
cant of those changes has been
the gradual secularization of
marriage.
Over many generations the
federal and state legislations
have attached secular rules and
regulations to marital status. As
a result, marriage carries count
less costs and benefits with it,
from taxes to judicial proceed

ings to discounted admission at
national parks. If legal implica
tipns are applied to marriage, it
no longer exists solely in the reli
gious or cultural realm. In other
words, marriage has become a
civic institution. Therefore, dis
crimination between those who
can and cannot marry results in
the creation of unique gover
nance of certain populations,
something that is unfair to all
Americans. This is no different
than telling a woman that she
cannot vote, prohibiting an
African-American from attend
ing a public school or, theoreti
cally, giving a tax break to tall
people.
As such, the only remaining
argument for disallowing gay
marriage is to question the le
gitimacy of homosexuality. In
other words, one could argue
that there is no discrimination
because homosexuals can still
marry someone of the opposite
sex. However, for the most
part, that argument is (correct
ly) not being made in main
stream politics.
If one accepts that homosexu
ality precludes one from hetero
sexual marriage, then to forbid
gay marriage is to discriminate
based on sexual preference, and
as long as marriage carries legal
consequences, our government
has the duty not to permit such
discrimination.
