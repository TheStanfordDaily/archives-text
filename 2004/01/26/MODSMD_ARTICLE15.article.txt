## Edit misrepresented 'Loveline' event 
### VINITA KAILASANATH 
We appreciate The Stanford
Daily's attempts to suggest
speakers to bring to campus
("'Loveline' crew the best we can
get?", Jan. 21). However, we
must respond to some of the rec
ommendations to correct some
of the editorial board's false as
sumptions.
The Daily suggests that Adam
Carolla and Dr. Drew are
"washed-up," focusing on their
canceled MTV show "Loveline."
However, they are more widely
known for their highly rated radio
show on Los Angeles's KROQ
that is syndicated on more than
100 radio stations, coast to coast,
and recorded five nights a week.
The event was not, as The Daily
claims, "One more ... episode of
a canceled show," but rather, an
episode of an ongoing and highly
popular radio show.
Dr. Drew is a board-certified
addictionologist, successful au
thor and regular on "Good
Morning America." Adam Car
olla has a large following among
teens and young adults due to
his involvement with "Love
line," "The Man Show" and
"Crankyankers." To compare
Carolla and Dr. Drew to former
Playboy Playmates and MTV
personalities Jenny McCarthy
and Carmen Electra is a cheap
shot that is both laughable and
disrespectful. For its critique of
Carolla and Dr. Drew, The
Daily relies on the opinion of
mouthshut.com, an odd choice
for reliable reviews. Further
more, referring to this event as a
"low-cost, easy-to-book speak
er" is irresponsible, given that
"Loveline" only does one such
engagement per year, and that

four months of planning that
went into the event.
The Daily seems to have mis
understood the purpose of the
event in suggesting that Peer
Health Educators and the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center
provide the same services as Dr.
Drew and Carolla. While aspects
of the show are certainly educa
tional, it is also entertaining and
humorous, which the more than
1,600 students who attended the
event can certainly attest to. The
PHEs and the SHPRC, as well as
Vaden's Health Promotion Unit,
were very pleased with our deci
sion to bring "Loveline" to cam
pus and, in fact, helped us to pub
licize the event.
The Daily suggests that we
have not made attempts to bring
important political speakers.
Presidential candidate Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, whom they
suggest, spoke at Stanford last
April. Yossi Beilin, negotiator of
the Oslo and Geneva Accords,
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, and Sen
ator and 2004 presidential candi
date John Kerry have all spoken
at Stanford in the past three
months. In fact, these last three
events were all cosponsored by
the Speakers Bureau, as The
Daily itself noted in its coverage
of these events. This could have
been easily reconfirmed with a
consultation with any represen
tative of the Speakers Bureau
before publishing the editorial.
The Speakers Bureau wel
comes suggestions about speak
ers that people would like to hear
speak on campus, but it is impor
tant to recognize the limitations
on these engagements. The
Daily's suggestions of Kofi
Annan or Nelson Mandela as
speakers are excellent in theory,

but impractical, as each of their
honoraria and travel costs rough
ly equal our budget for the entire
year and they accept a very limit
ed number of engagements. In
the past four months, the Speak
ers Bureau has considered more
than 250 speakers and had to rule
out a vast majority solely based
on price. We strive to bring a vari
ety of speakers with diverse back
grounds and interests in order to
cater to the broadest possible stu
dent audience.
We understand and share
the desire to bring big-name
speakers to campus, and fre
quently partner with other
groups to bring speakers to
campus. We have contacted
more than 80 student groups,
departments and centers on
campus this year alone. But the
simple reality is that few groups
have enough money to pay even
10 percent of the cost of one of
these speakers. In addition, we
try to coordinate with other col
leges and off-campus groups to
take advantage of speakers'
presence in this region to save
money. Thus, The Daily's call to
not let cost be "an easy excuse"
seems wholly unwarranted.
Perhaps Dr. Drew described
The Daily's editorial best when
he described it as "negative, just
plain negative and all over the
place." By publishing editorials
that disregard the facts and vi
ciously attack the personalities
that the Speakers Bureau brings
to campus, The Daily makes
Stanford an unwelcoming place
for speakers, loses journalistic in
tegrity and does a disservice to
the Stanford Community.

April. Yossi Beilin, negotiator of
the Oslo and Geneva Accords,
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, and Sen
ator and 2004 presidential candi
date John Kerry have all spoken
at Stanford in the past three
months. In fact, these last three
events were all cosponsored by
the Speakers Bureau, as The
Daily itself noted in its coverage
of these events. This could have
been easily reconfirmed with a
consultation with any represen
tative of the Speakers Bureau
before publishing the editorial.
The Speakers Bureau wel
comes suggestions about speak
ers that people would like to hear
speak on campus, but it is impor
tant to recognize the limitations
on these engagements. The
Daily's suggestions of Kofi
Annan or Nelson Mandela as
speakers are excellent in theory,

but impractical, as each of their
honoraria and travel costs rough
ly equal our budget for the entire
year and they accept a very limit
ed number of engagements. In
the past four months, the Speak
ers Bureau has considered more
than 250 speakers and had to rule
out a vast majority solely based
on price. We strive to bring a vari
ety of speakers with diverse back
grounds and interests in order to
cater to the broadest possible stu
dent audience.
We understand and share
the desire to bring big-name
speakers to campus, and fre
quently partner with other
groups to bring speakers to
campus. We have contacted
more than 80 student groups,
departments and centers on
campus this year alone. But the
simple reality is that few groups
have enough money to pay even
10 percent of the cost of one of
these speakers. In addition, we
try to coordinate with other col
leges and off-campus groups to
take advantage of speakers'
presence in this region to save
money. Thus, The Daily's call to
not let cost be "an easy excuse"
seems wholly unwarranted.
Perhaps Dr. Drew described
The Daily's editorial best when
he described it as "negative, just
plain negative and all over the
place." By publishing editorials
that disregard the facts and vi
ciously attack the personalities
that the Speakers Bureau brings
to campus, The Daily makes
Stanford an unwelcoming place
for speakers, loses journalistic in
tegrity and does a disservice to
the Stanford Community.

We appreciate The Stanford
Daily's attempts to suggest
speakers to bring to campus
("'Loveline' crew the best we can
get?", Jan. 21). However, we
must respond to some of the rec
ommendations to correct some
of the editorial board's false as
sumptions.
The Daily suggests that Adam
Carolla and Dr. Drew are
"washed-up," focusing on their
canceled MTV show "Loveline."
However, they are more widely
known for their highly rated radio
show on Los Angeles's KROQ
that is syndicated on more than
100 radio stations, coast to coast,
and recorded five nights a week.
The event was not, as The Daily
claims, "One more ... episode of
a canceled show," but rather, an
episode of an ongoing and highly
popular radio show.
Dr. Drew is a board-certified
addictionologist, successful au
thor and regular on "Good
Morning America." Adam Car
olla has a large following among
teens and young adults due to
his involvement with "Love
line," "The Man Show" and
"Crankyankers." To compare
Carolla and Dr. Drew to former
Playboy Playmates and MTV
personalities Jenny McCarthy
and Carmen Electra is a cheap
shot that is both laughable and
disrespectful. For its critique of
Carolla and Dr. Drew, The
Daily relies on the opinion of
mouthshut.com, an odd choice
for reliable reviews. Further
more, referring to this event as a
"low-cost, easy-to-book speak
er" is irresponsible, given that
"Loveline" only does one such
engagement per year, and that

four months of planning that
went into the event.
The Daily seems to have mis
understood the purpose of the
event in suggesting that Peer
Health Educators and the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center
provide the same services as Dr.
Drew and Carolla. While aspects
of the show are certainly educa
tional, it is also entertaining and
humorous, which the more than
1,600 students who attended the
event can certainly attest to. The
PHEs and the SHPRC, as well as
Vaden's Health Promotion Unit,
were very pleased with our deci
sion to bring "Loveline" to cam
pus and, in fact, helped us to pub
licize the event.
The Daily suggests that we
have not made attempts to bring
important political speakers.
Presidential candidate Rep.
Dennis Kucinich, whom they
suggest, spoke at Stanford last
April. Yossi Beilin, negotiator of
the Oslo and Geneva Accords,
U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, and Sen
