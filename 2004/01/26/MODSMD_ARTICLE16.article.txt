## American and European worldviews 
### RUSSELL A. BERMAN 
Rather than viewing Euro
pean anti-Americanism solely in
terms of current policy disputes,
we must look at our deep-seated
cultural differences. According
to "Views of a Changing World,"
a study conducted by the Pew
Global Attitudes Project, Amer
icans and West Europeans advo
cate very distinct philosophical
stances, especially regarding
matters of individual responsi
bility and the role of the state.
Asked to evaluate the state
ment "Success in life is pretty
much determined by forces out
side our control," 32 percent of
the Americans polled agreed, in
contrast to 48 percent in Eng
land, 54 percent in France, 66
percent in Italy and 68 percent
in Germany. Less than a third of
Americans view their lives as
defined by external forces, im
plying that the majority see the
world in terms of individual re
sponsibility. Meanwhile, Euro
peans minimize individual re
sponsibility and attribute much
greater importance to outside
forces. Whereas Europeans tend
toward a deterministic world
view, Americans focus on indi
vidual freedom.
The survey also measured
how public opinion chooses be
tween two competing values: the
value of the freedom of individ
uals to pursue goals without

state interference and the value
of a state guarantee that no one
be in need. Fifty-eight percent of
Americans — a significant ma
jority — chose freedom from
state interference as the most
important goal. This result
stands in stark contrast to Eu
rope, where freedom earns sup
port at dramatically lower rates:
only 39 percent in Germany, 36
percent in France, 33 percent in
England and a paltry 24 percent
in Italy. Whereas Americans are
predisposed to understand their
lives in terms of individual re
sponsibility and reject greater
state regulation, Europeans, by
and large, take the opposite po
sition: They view their lives in
terms of larger social forces and
expect the state to protect them
from need — even at the price
of a restriction of their freedom.
No wonder current domestic
politics in most European coun
tries involves the difficult task of
reforming firmly entrenched
welfare-state systems.
Not surprisingly, the cultural
difference between Americans
and Europeans has significant
foreign policy ramifications. The
American worldview of individ
ual responsibility underpins an
insistence on national sovereign
ty. In contrast, Europeans — es
pecially the French and the Ger
mans — tend to support re
straints on the power of individ
ual states. The lesson they take

away from the two world wars is
that curbs should be placed on
individual states to prevent them
from pursuing selfish interests.
As a result, European states are
gradually ceding elements of
their sovereignty to the super
state of the European Union. In
contrast, the United States has
repeatedly demonstrated its re
luctance to cede such authority
to international bodies.
This is the cultural basis for
the debate over multilateralism
and unilateralism. In practice,
the difference is, of course, hard
ly absolute. Although European
politicians insist on internation
al cooperation, they typically
continue to pursue national in
terests. Whereas the American
leadership insists on the right to
act independently, it has ap
pealed repeatedly to the United
Nations for support. Nonethe
less, the significant differences
in American and European
worldviews are likely to cause
political rifts long after the cur
rent battles such as Iraq and
Kyoto have faded.
