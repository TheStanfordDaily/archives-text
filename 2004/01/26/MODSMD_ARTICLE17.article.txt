## No. 2 men roll over L.A. schools, stay unbeaten 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
There's a lot of talk about the No. 2
Stanford men's basketball team being un
defeated right now, and in the second half
against Southern California, the Cardinal
certainly played like it didn't want to lose.
Not on this particular Saturday, against
this particular Trojan team. Not in front of
this boisterous, sellout crowd at Maples
Pavilion.
"I feel like we've been in a war," said
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery of
the extremely physical matchup against
the Trojans. "[But] that's what it's like
when you play SC."
In the Cardinal's (16-0, 7-0 Pacific-10
Conference) 77-67 win over the Trojans
(8-9,3-5), Stanford found a way to win de
spite the game's overt physicality (read:
damn-near knock-down, drag-out fight)
and a lackluster first half where the Cardi
nal shot a little more than 36 percent from
the field, went 0-for-6 from behind the arc
and managed to jog into the locker room
at half time, down by six points, 34-28,
trailing its opponent at the break for only
the second time this season. (The first
time, versus Rice in Houston on Nov. 30,
the Cardinal found itself down 28-22 at the
half.)
"I thought being down at the half didn't
hurt us," Montgomery said. "Obviously
we're not pleased. Are you going to keep
your poise and how are you going to react
to being behind? Are you going to right
yourself and make some plays? I think we
did that. All that stuff I think is going to
help you.
"It's not about being undefeated," he
continued. "We're trying, in our confer
ence, to get some separation if we can.
That's really our only goal right now."
In the second half, Stanford did just
that — first overcoming and then separat
ing itself from a surprisingly dangerous
USC squad that has already experienced
the triumph of Pac-10 upset once this sea
son.
The Trojans beat then-No. 7 Arizona
last weekend before falling two nights
later to unranked Arizona State in Los
Angeles. In the Arizona win, USC guard
Desmon Farmer posted a career-high 40
points.
"SC's for real," Montgomery said.
"They can defend and their style [of play
has] always been difficult for us."
However, Farmer couldn't duplicate
that same kind of offensive effort against
the Cardinal, although he did walk away

from Maples with 19 points off 5-for-ll
shooting from the field, despite constant
taunts from the Sixth Man Club.
They called him ugly, shouted "air
ball," at every touch and even wore mock,
yellow sweatbands around their foreheads
(made of crepe paper) as an homage to the
6-foot-5 senior from Flint, Mich.
But no, no, the star of the show wasn't
Farmer this time around, although he
commanded a lot of the audience's and the
Stanford zone's attention throughout the
game. The "lead" actors came from a team
full of role players — Stanford redshirt
sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez
and junior .. . umm .. .pick-whatever-po
sition-you-want-and-insert-it-here Nick
Robinson.
Hernandez led all Cardinal scorers
with 18 points, going 4-for-6 from the field
and shooting 3-of-3 from the three-point
line, including one deep (deep, deep) trey
that banked its way in as the shot clock
buzzer rang with six minutes left to play in
the game.
The shot, which Hernandez jokingly
said he "practices everyday," extended
the Cardinal's lead to 13 points, 63-50, and
culminated a 32-16 second half Stanford
run.
But it was Robinson who really got the
Cardinal going during the stretch, pushing
the full-court up-tempo nature of the
game along with Hernandez and scoring
nine points during the stretch off spectac
ular layups in traffic and pull-up jumpers.
Robinson finished with 13 points in 21
minutes in his second game as Stanford's
sixth man.
"We didn't play enough defense in the
second half," Farmer said. "I guess guys
broke down mentally on defense. We were
letting shots go that didn't go in the first
half."
Childress added 11 points and seven
boards to the Cardinal effort in his second
game as a starter. Junior center Rob Little
finished with 10 points and seven re
bounds and sophomore forward Matt
Haryasz tallied an impressive eight-point
performance with three blocks off the
bench for the Card.
"They got easy baskets. They made easy
shots," said USC head coach Henry Bibby
who was whistled for a technical foul three
and a half minutes into the first half. "They
bank shots in from the top of the key.
"We let them get going."
Stanford will travel to Corvallis, Ore.,

Junior swingman Nick Robinson goes in for the layup against USC on Saturday. Robinson
scored 13 points in the 77-67 Stanford victory.
on Thursday to face Oregon State
and then will head to Eugene, Ore.,
for a game against Oregon.
For the Trojans — who have
dropped three consecutive Pac-10
games since the win over the Wild
cats, including a 63-62 loss to Cali
fornia on Thursday — the disci
plinary woes continue.
Junior guard Errick Craven
(identical twin of USC guard Der
rick Craven) was kept out of the
starting lineup on Saturday by
Bibby because he bragged about
purposefully kicking Cal guard
Richard Midgely on Thursday.
Craven was replaced by fresh
man guard Lodrick Stewart (iden
tical twin of Trojan starting Ro
drick Stewart). L. Stewart (he was
the twin without the yellow head
band .. . maybe) scored 13 points.
