# Card wins, despite ugly game
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Saturday night's Stanford bas
ketball game started out with an un
comfortable guitar-solo interpreta
tion of the national anthem that fell
significantly short of the standard
set by Hendrix at Woodstock.
Things only got uglier from
there.
Just over three minutes into the
game, Southern California head
coach Henry Bibby was called for a
technical foul after yelling at the of
ficials, bringing the crowd noise to a
deafening pitch. The tension esca
lated as players threw elbows and
body-checks to establish position
inside.
When Stanford's Justin Davis
tried to jump up for one of the pre
cision alley-oop passes that had
worked so beautifully two nights
before against UCLA, he got
shoved from behind and couldn't
reach the basket for the dunk. No
whistles blew.
In a game filled with traveling vi- (
olations, hand-checks and pushes,
kicked balls, jump balls and
turnovers, it was the scrappy play of
Stanford's role players that made
the difference. Chris Hernandez,
Matt Haryasz and Nick Robinson
— Stanford's fifth, sixth and sev
enth-leading scorers — combined
for more than half the team's
points.
For the first 30 minutes, neither
team could get enough momentum
to take a commanding lead. Mid
way through the second half, an 8-0
run sparked by Hernandez and
Robinson finally gave the Cardinal
some elbow room, figuratively if
not physically.
With Stanford down 47-46,
Hernandez hit an open 3-pointer,
Joe Kirchoffer tipped in an offen
sive rebound, and Robinson fol
lowed it up with three the hard
way on a fast break to open a
seven-point lead.
The game's climax came on the
next Stanford possession, when
first Joe Kirchoffer and then Matt
Lottich barely managed to wriggle
their way out of aggressive traps
by USC defenders. The ball was
knocked loose for a moment at
half-court, but Jason Haas came
up with it and threw a cross-court
pass to find Robinson open on the
wing.
Robinson drove hard to the
basket, elevating and sinking a
lay-up but colliding with a USC
big man on the way. The referee's

whistle blew, and a breath-stop
ping moment passed before he sig
naled that the foul was on the Tro
jans, meaning that the basket was
good and Stanford was ahead by
eight.
Robinson missed the free
throw, but USC couldn't get closer
than seven points the rest of the
game.
Though the suspense was re
lieved in that three-minute burst,
the ugliness continued unabated
throughout the game.
It was best exemplified by a se
quence early in the second half
that featured four turnovers in just
50 seconds of scoreless play. It
began when Childress drove to
ward the basket and rose up to de
liver a pretty pass to Haryasz but
crashed into a Trojan and was
called for charging. Childress
protested the call angrily, but
Haryasz had fumbled the pass out
of bounds anyway.
USC's Rodrick Stewart then
bricked a short jumper and Chil

dress came up with the loose ball,
but got tripped up. Writhing on
the floor, he frantically tried to
call a timeout, but the referees
didn't see it and gave the ball back
to the Trojans. At the other end,
USC's Greg Guenther got
stripped by Rob Little and
Haryasz came up with the ball, but
he promptly threw an errant pass
out of bounds.
It was a rough night for the offi
cials, too, who were on the receiv
ing end of dozens of catcalls
throughout the evening. Some of
the most justified came when
Haryasz was called for an over
the-back foul on a visibly clean re
bound, sending the Trojans to the
line. But, appropriately, a lane vi
olation annulled the one-and-one
foul shot and gave the ball back to
Stanford.
Such miscues haunted the Tro
jans late in the game, as offensive
fouls and missed free throws pre
vented them from mounting a
rally.

After the game, libby blamed
both Stanford and tie referees for
a rough game that 1; claimed his
players weren't prep.red for.
"If they're physial and [the
referees] let it go tht way, then
that's the way teams hould play,"
Bibby said. "A lot >f contact is
going on, a lot of han -checking is
going on and there's lothing you
can do about it if that' the way the
game's going to be pla/ed."
But officials weren't exactly
turning a blind eye to tie physical
ity — they called an asounding 43
fouls in the game, 22 oi USC and
21 on Stanford.
Adding to the sloppness were
19 missed free thows, 35
turnovers and several rotable air
balls and bricks. And some un
orthodox off-court antic,:
• Six minutes afte: Bibby's
technical foul interrupted the
game, play was stopped fecause of
another technical diffi<ulty — a
referee lost his shoe.
• Desmon Farmer endired ver
bal jabs from the crowd ill night,
but they intensified after te threw
up an airball, and finalb turned
personal when the Sixth Nan sec
tion began chanting "Firmer's
ugly!"

• With Josh Childress about to
shoot a foul shot in the final sec
onds, the crowd's quiet was broken
by an ill-advised chant from a sin
gle member of the Sixth Man sec
tion. Turning toward Bibby, whose
estranged son Mike Bibby plays in
the NBA, the fan shouted "Your
son hates you!" Childress missed
the shot.
However, the fact that the win
wasn't pretty didn't make it any
less satisfying for the Cardinal.
"It's a situation where you
don't want to be blowing people
out by 30 and 40 at this point in the
season, because then maybe
you've peaked and are playing
your best ball," Hernandez said.
"It builds our character and team
mentality to know that we can pull
out a close one."
And Hernandez wasn't about
to apologize for the fact that the
game was rough.
"The reputation Stanford's got
ten over the years is sort of:
'They're soft, nice guys, passive,
you've got to be physical with
them.' In the off-season, we
thought, 'We have to show we're
not going to get pushed around,
and try to change this attitude that
people have about us.' "

19 missed free thows, 35
turnovers and several rotable air
balls and bricks. And some un
orthodox off-court antic,:
• Six minutes afte: Bibby's
technical foul interrupted the
game, play was stopped fecause of
another technical diffi<ulty — a
referee lost his shoe.
• Desmon Farmer endired ver
bal jabs from the crowd ill night,
but they intensified after te threw
up an airball, and finalb turned
personal when the Sixth Nan sec
tion began chanting "Firmer's
ugly!"

• With Josh Childress about to
shoot a foul shot in the final sec
onds, the crowd's quiet was broken
by an ill-advised chant from a sin
gle member of the Sixth Man sec
tion. Turning toward Bibby, whose
estranged son Mike Bibby plays in
the NBA, the fan shouted "Your
son hates you!" Childress missed
the shot.
However, the fact that the win
wasn't pretty didn't make it any
less satisfying for the Cardinal.
"It's a situation where you
don't want to be blowing people
out by 30 and 40 at this point in the
season, because then maybe
you've peaked and are playing
your best ball," Hernandez said.
"It builds our character and team
mentality to know that we can pull
out a close one."
And Hernandez wasn't about
to apologize for the fact that the
game was rough.
"The reputation Stanford's got
ten over the years is sort of:
'They're soft, nice guys, passive,
you've got to be physical with
them.' In the off-season, we
thought, 'We have to show we're
not going to get pushed around,
and try to change this attitude that
people have about us.' "
Saturday night's Stanford bas
ketball game started out with an un
comfortable guitar-solo interpreta
tion of the national anthem that fell
significantly short of the standard
set by Hendrix at Woodstock.
Things only got uglier from
there.
Just over three minutes into the
game, Southern California head
coach Henry Bibby was called for a
technical foul after yelling at the of
ficials, bringing the crowd noise to a
deafening pitch. The tension esca
lated as players threw elbows and
body-checks to establish position
inside.
When Stanford's Justin Davis
tried to jump up for one of the pre
cision alley-oop passes that had
worked so beautifully two nights
before against UCLA, he got
shoved from behind and couldn't
reach the basket for the dunk. No
whistles blew.
In a game filled with traveling vi- (
olations, hand-checks and pushes,
kicked balls, jump balls and
turnovers, it was the scrappy play of
Stanford's role players that made
the difference. Chris Hernandez,
Matt Haryasz and Nick Robinson
— Stanford's fifth, sixth and sev
enth-leading scorers — combined
for more than half the team's
points.
For the first 30 minutes, neither
team could get enough momentum
to take a commanding lead. Mid
way through the second half, an 8-0
run sparked by Hernandez and
Robinson finally gave the Cardinal
some elbow room, figuratively if
not physically.
With Stanford down 47-46,
Hernandez hit an open 3-pointer,
Joe Kirchoffer tipped in an offen
sive rebound, and Robinson fol
lowed it up with three the hard
way on a fast break to open a
seven-point lead.
The game's climax came on the
next Stanford possession, when
first Joe Kirchoffer and then Matt
Lottich barely managed to wriggle
their way out of aggressive traps
by USC defenders. The ball was
knocked loose for a moment at
half-court, but Jason Haas came
up with it and threw a cross-court
pass to find Robinson open on the
wing.
Robinson drove hard to the
basket, elevating and sinking a
lay-up but colliding with a USC
big man on the way. The referee's

whistle blew, and a breath-stop
ping moment passed before he sig
naled that the foul was on the Tro
jans, meaning that the basket was
good and Stanford was ahead by
eight.
Robinson missed the free
throw, but USC couldn't get closer
than seven points the rest of the
game.
Though the suspense was re
lieved in that three-minute burst,
the ugliness continued unabated
throughout the game.
It was best exemplified by a se
quence early in the second half
that featured four turnovers in just
50 seconds of scoreless play. It
began when Childress drove to
ward the basket and rose up to de
liver a pretty pass to Haryasz but
crashed into a Trojan and was
called for charging. Childress
protested the call angrily, but
Haryasz had fumbled the pass out
of bounds anyway.
USC's Rodrick Stewart then
bricked a short jumper and Chil

dress came up with the loose ball,
but got tripped up. Writhing on
the floor, he frantically tried to
call a timeout, but the referees
didn't see it and gave the ball back
to the Trojans. At the other end,
USC's Greg Guenther got
stripped by Rob Little and
Haryasz came up with the ball, but
he promptly threw an errant pass
out of bounds.
It was a rough night for the offi
cials, too, who were on the receiv
ing end of dozens of catcalls
throughout the evening. Some of
the most justified came when
Haryasz was called for an over
the-back foul on a visibly clean re
bound, sending the Trojans to the
line. But, appropriately, a lane vi
olation annulled the one-and-one
foul shot and gave the ball back to
Stanford.
Such miscues haunted the Tro
jans late in the game, as offensive
fouls and missed free throws pre
vented them from mounting a
rally.

After the game, libby blamed
both Stanford and tie referees for
a rough game that 1; claimed his
players weren't prep.red for.
"If they're physial and [the
referees] let it go tht way, then
that's the way teams hould play,"
Bibby said. "A lot >f contact is
going on, a lot of han -checking is
going on and there's lothing you
can do about it if that' the way the
game's going to be pla/ed."
But officials weren't exactly
turning a blind eye to tie physical
ity — they called an asounding 43
fouls in the game, 22 oi USC and
21 on Stanford.
