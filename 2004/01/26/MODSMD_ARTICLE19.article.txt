# Trojans overcome deficit to beat women
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
A win is a win, right?
And a split on one of the toughest con
ference road trips is nothing to be
ashamed of, right?
Well, yes and no. The No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team (15-3,8-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) defeated UCLA (9-9,
4-5) 78-71 on Friday night, but needed
overtime to finish off the Bruins. Howev
er, the Cardinal fell to USC on Sunday,
59-56, as the Women of Troy came back
from a 12-point deficit to pick up the win.
While the heavily favored Cardinal es
caped with the victory at Pauley, it got
quite a scare from unranked UCLA. And
because Stanford is the only ranked team
in the Pac-10, shouldn't it be blowing out
its conference opponents night in arid
night out?
The tight contest raised serious ques
tions about Stanford's ball-handling abil
ity and athleticism — the Bruins, led by
sophomore guard Nikki Blue, tallied 12
steals and forced 22 Cardinal turnovers.
Blue, who is averaging a conference
best 3.29 steals per game, terrorized the
Stanford ball-handlers, capitalized on
turnovers — leading the Bruins to a 25-6
advantage on points off turnovers — and
tested Stanford's usually stellar transition
defense, pushing the ball up-court on
every opportunity.
However, Stanford proved that there
just might be a reason that it has garnered
that top 10 ranking.
The Cardinal showed the heart and
mental toughness necessary to contend
for a National Championship — it didn't
fold when the going got tough, Nicole
Powell, once again, established herself as
that bonafide super star any team would
kill to have and role players stepped up
and made big plays when the team had its
back to the wall.
"I'm just really proud of our team for
finding a way to win," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We strug
gled with making plays in regulation, but
in overtime I thought people hit some re

ally big shots ... It was a heavyweight
fight."
The game was defined by runs, with
each team looking brilliant at times and
mediocre at others.
After being down by as many as seven
in the first half, the Cardinal worked its
way to a 10-point second-half advantage
only to blow that and allow UCLA to gain
a two-point lead. In the final 10 minutes,
the Bruins did not only do damage on the
scoreboard, but drew two offensive fouls
on Powell, pushing her total to four per
sonals.
Powell would remain in the game
while Stanford switched to a zone defense
to protect the All-American.
"I really didn't understand a couple of
the offensive fouls that they called on
me," Powell said. "In a situation like that
you just have to adjust. I didn't really
think it was as much a factor on offense as
it was on defense."
Regulation ended with four straight
three-pointers —two from each team.
Noelle Quinn and Lisa Willis hit for the
Bruins, while Suminski and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu did damage for the Cardi
nal.
Suminski's pressure three might have
been the most impressive — the junior hit
only one other field goal on the night, a
wide-open layup. She finished the night
just l-for-6 from three point land, but the
one she hit was certainly a difference
maker.
After Kristen Newlin — who seemed
to break through that "rookie wall" with
nine points and 10 rebounds — hit a
clutch free throw to tie the game at 65
with 1:05 left, neither team could score for
the rest of regulation, sending the game
into overtime.
Powell stole the show in the extra peri
od, scoring seven points, including a huge
three with Blue closing in on her to extend
the Cardinal lead to six. After essentially
sealing a Stanford victory, Powell
pumped her fist in Blue's face and got
back to work on defense. UCLA would
never get closer than four.
Despite the close game, Powell

summed things up as only she could.
"It never crossed my mind that we
were going to lose the game . . . More
than anything, I thought that we didn't
play the way we should have played,"
she said.
On Sunday, the Cardinal wasn't so
lucky, suffering its first defeat of confer
ence play in what is becoming a Stanford
trend at the L.A. Sports Arena. The Car
dinal picked up its second straight loss on
Southern California's home court, after
falling 75-72 last season.
Stanford blew a 12-point second half
lead to USC (10-7,7-2) — and unlike Fri
day's matchup against the Bruins, Powell
was not there at the end to save the day
for the Cardinal.
"People were looking to Nicole to
make plays and she struggled shooting,"
VanDerveer said. "We just never got into
an offensive flow."
Two of the biggest stars in the Pac-10,
Hoffman and Powell faced off, both going
ice cold in the first half. Powell finally
began to heat up in the second half, scor
ing 13 straight points and almost single
handedly pushed the Cardinal lead to 12.
However, after the Women of Troy
clawed their way back to within one, Pow
ell twisted her right ankle and was forced
to the sideline for, perhaps, the game's
most critical juncture. By the time she re
turned, the Cardinal had thrown the ball
away once again and USC had built a
three point lead.
Stanford had one last chance to tie, but
the Women of Troy defended the three
point line well, forcing Powell to throw up
a fade-away three from the corner. It
bounced on both sides of the rim, but she
couldn't get the shooter's roll as the clock
expired.
"It was important for the conference
that they finally got beat," said USC head
coach Chris Goebrecht. "Not that I have
anything against them, but the conference
needed this."
The Cardinal's loss certainly mixes
things up in the Pac-10. It is now tied for
first place with Arizona — and USC is hot
on its tail.

coach Chris Goebrecht. "Not that I have
anything against them, but the conference
needed this."
The Cardinal's loss certainly mixes
things up in the Pac-10. It is now tied for
first place with Arizona — and USC is hot
on its tail.

Junior guard Susan Borchardt makes a pass during a recent game against Arizona. Though
the Cardinal beat UCLA on Friday, the team fell to USC 59-56 last night.
A win is a win, right?
And a split on one of the toughest con
ference road trips is nothing to be
ashamed of, right?
Well, yes and no. The No. 6 Stanford
women's basketball team (15-3,8-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) defeated UCLA (9-9,
4-5) 78-71 on Friday night, but needed
overtime to finish off the Bruins. Howev
er, the Cardinal fell to USC on Sunday,
59-56, as the Women of Troy came back
from a 12-point deficit to pick up the win.
While the heavily favored Cardinal es
caped with the victory at Pauley, it got
quite a scare from unranked UCLA. And
because Stanford is the only ranked team
in the Pac-10, shouldn't it be blowing out
its conference opponents night in arid
night out?
The tight contest raised serious ques
tions about Stanford's ball-handling abil
ity and athleticism — the Bruins, led by
sophomore guard Nikki Blue, tallied 12
steals and forced 22 Cardinal turnovers.
Blue, who is averaging a conference
best 3.29 steals per game, terrorized the
Stanford ball-handlers, capitalized on
turnovers — leading the Bruins to a 25-6
advantage on points off turnovers — and
tested Stanford's usually stellar transition
defense, pushing the ball up-court on
every opportunity.
However, Stanford proved that there
just might be a reason that it has garnered
that top 10 ranking.
The Cardinal showed the heart and
mental toughness necessary to contend
for a National Championship — it didn't
fold when the going got tough, Nicole
Powell, once again, established herself as
that bonafide super star any team would
kill to have and role players stepped up
and made big plays when the team had its
back to the wall.
"I'm just really proud of our team for
finding a way to win," Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer said. "We strug
gled with making plays in regulation, but
in overtime I thought people hit some re

ally big shots ... It was a heavyweight
fight."
The game was defined by runs, with
each team looking brilliant at times and
mediocre at others.
After being down by as many as seven
in the first half, the Cardinal worked its
way to a 10-point second-half advantage
only to blow that and allow UCLA to gain
a two-point lead. In the final 10 minutes,
the Bruins did not only do damage on the
scoreboard, but drew two offensive fouls
on Powell, pushing her total to four per
sonals.
Powell would remain in the game
while Stanford switched to a zone defense
to protect the All-American.
"I really didn't understand a couple of
the offensive fouls that they called on
me," Powell said. "In a situation like that
you just have to adjust. I didn't really
think it was as much a factor on offense as
it was on defense."
Regulation ended with four straight
three-pointers —two from each team.
Noelle Quinn and Lisa Willis hit for the
Bruins, while Suminski and Sebnem
Kimyacioglu did damage for the Cardi
nal.
Suminski's pressure three might have
been the most impressive — the junior hit
only one other field goal on the night, a
wide-open layup. She finished the night
just l-for-6 from three point land, but the
one she hit was certainly a difference
maker.
After Kristen Newlin — who seemed
to break through that "rookie wall" with
nine points and 10 rebounds — hit a
clutch free throw to tie the game at 65
with 1:05 left, neither team could score for
the rest of regulation, sending the game
into overtime.
Powell stole the show in the extra peri
od, scoring seven points, including a huge
three with Blue closing in on her to extend
the Cardinal lead to six. After essentially
sealing a Stanford victory, Powell
pumped her fist in Blue's face and got
back to work on defense. UCLA would
never get closer than four.
Despite the close game, Powell

summed things up as only she could.
"It never crossed my mind that we
were going to lose the game . . . More
than anything, I thought that we didn't
play the way we should have played,"
she said.
On Sunday, the Cardinal wasn't so
lucky, suffering its first defeat of confer
ence play in what is becoming a Stanford
trend at the L.A. Sports Arena. The Car
dinal picked up its second straight loss on
Southern California's home court, after
falling 75-72 last season.
Stanford blew a 12-point second half
lead to USC (10-7,7-2) — and unlike Fri
day's matchup against the Bruins, Powell
was not there at the end to save the day
for the Cardinal.
"People were looking to Nicole to
make plays and she struggled shooting,"
VanDerveer said. "We just never got into
an offensive flow."
Two of the biggest stars in the Pac-10,
Hoffman and Powell faced off, both going
ice cold in the first half. Powell finally
began to heat up in the second half, scor
ing 13 straight points and almost single
handedly pushed the Cardinal lead to 12.
However, after the Women of Troy
clawed their way back to within one, Pow
ell twisted her right ankle and was forced
to the sideline for, perhaps, the game's
most critical juncture. By the time she re
turned, the Cardinal had thrown the ball
away once again and USC had built a
three point lead.
Stanford had one last chance to tie, but
the Women of Troy defended the three
point line well, forcing Powell to throw up
a fade-away three from the corner. It
bounced on both sides of the rim, but she
couldn't get the shooter's roll as the clock
expired.
"It was important for the conference
that they finally got beat," said USC head
coach Chris Goebrecht. "Not that I have
anything against them, but the conference
needed this."
