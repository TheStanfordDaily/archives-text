# Students seek special funds for humanitarian charity groups
## 
### ANTHONY HA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This spring, when Stanford undergraduates go on
line to select a new ASSU president and decide which
student groups will receive special fees funding, they
may face a new decision: whether to pay an extra $3 to
support aid groups such as Save the Children and Doc
tors Without Borders.
The effort to place this referendum on the next
ASSU ballot was initiated by the group Students for
the Great Donation, a brainchild of senior Pat
Bomhack.

"Jane and Le
land Stanford's
explicit desire was
that the Universi
ty would be of
benefit to civiliza
tion and humani
ty," Bomhack
said. "We are here
to get a better ed
ucation in order to
serve others, and
we think that the
ASSU should re
flect this stipulat
ed objective of our
university, even in
a small way. "
The proposal
has not been final
ized and must first
be approved by
the ASSU Under
graduate Senate.
This year, the

money would be donated to groups selected by Stu
dents for the Great Donation in collaboration with the
Senate; in the future, the groups will be selected by a
committee of senators or members of the general stu
dent body.
Bomhack said groups like Save the Children and
Doctors Without Borders are good candidates for the
donation because of efficient budgeting and lack of
political and religious affiliations.
The current referendum would only apply to under
graduates. Should someone bring forward a similar
proposal for graduate students, it would have to go be
fore the Graduate Student Council.
Bomhack initially came up with the idea when he
heard that the ASSU had accumulated $350,000 in a
buffer account set aside to pay students when they re
quest refunds on their special fees. Bomhack believed

that "the most rational, justifiable" use of the money
in the account was "to give it away as one great dona
tion."
According to Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior, the
ASSU soon decided that due to increasing refund re
quests, "it wasn't feasible to use that money in the near
future." Students for the Great Donation then worked
with the ASSU to revise the idea into its current form.
"The group has been very understanding of the con
straints we operate under," Shipp said. "We've been
working with them very closely, because we want them
to make the best presentation possible, so that it won't
be judged on a technicality, but rather on whether it's

a good idea for the
use of students' fees."
The group has
begun flyering dorm
bathrooms and other
campus locations to
publicize the idea and
has put up an online
petition that, as of
last night, had 148
signatures. Bomhack
said that he has re
ceived almost univer
sally positive feed
back.
Although his pro
posal is the first of its
kind to go before the
ASSU, last year stu
dents approved spe
cial fees for interna
tional aid-focused
groups such as Vol
unteers in Latin
America and the

World Refugee Academy.
After being approached by Bomhack, academics
Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn and Peter Singer —
whose book "Writings on an Ethical Life" prompted
Bomhack's initial idea — praised the proposal.
"The Great Donation is a great idea," Singer said.
"It could serve as an inspiration to others, both indi
viduals and institutions, and show the world that
American students at privileged universities really do
care about those who are less fortunate, no matter
where they are."
Bomhack, who is a member of the men's volleyball
team, noted that the core members of Students for the
Great Donation include two former ASSU senators, a
