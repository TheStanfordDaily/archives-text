# Cardinal wins back-to-back meets at home
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim team
hosted both Arizona State and Ari
zona last weekend and emerged with
two wins. Although Arizona State
was ranked No. 15 in the nation and
Arizona No. 7, the results of both
meets were identical: Cardinal dom
ination. The team improved to 5-0
overall and to 2-0 in the Pacific 10
Conference.
Arizona State came to town first,
competing against the Cardinal Fri
day at Avery Aquatics Center. Like
many Stanford swimming dual
meets, Friday's affair began with the
Cardinal sweeping the top two spots
in the 400-meter medley relay. From
there, the team never looked back,
winning the meet 127-107. The team
showed that it is one of the best in the
country by winning 10 of the 13
events in the meet and finishing 1-2
in seven of those events.
One of the more interesting story
lines of the meet came in the form of
a returning athlete. Friday's meet
marked the official comeback of se
nior breaststroker and locker room
leader senior Michael Bruce, who
missed the beginning of the season
due to a shoulder injury. After com
peting in an exhibition heat two

weeks ago, fruce was ready to com
pete last veekend and to score
points for tie Cardinal against the
Sun Devils.
Wasting io time, Bruce swam the
breaststrok- leg of the winning 400-
meter medsy relay to kick off the
meet. He also went on to win the
200-meter jreaststroke later in the
competitioi.
"After matching my teammates
compete fom the deck for the past
three moiths, I really enjoyed sim
ply being able to jump in and con
tribute," Iruce said. "When you're
healthy itis easy to forget the joy of
racing, bit after sitting on the deck
for so loig I've learned to appreciate
each chaice I get to swim fast."
With Iruce back in the Cardinal
lineup, tie team inched closer to its
champiciship form.
Aftei Friday's solid victory, the
Cardina looked to Saturday's meet
against \rizona to continue its fast
swimmiig. True to form, the Cardi
nal kicled off the meet against the
Wildcas by going 1-2 in the 400-yard
medle* relay. In the 1,000-yard
freestde, the Cardinal trio of
Markis Rogan, Shaun Phillips and
Michail McLean went 1-2-3 to give
the teim a commanding 31-4 lead
after jist two events. It was that kind
of day

The Cardinal would go on to vic
tories in 11 out of 13 events, winning
with a final score of 154-133. The
score was reasonably close because
the Cardinal went "unofficial" (not
counting the points) for the last two
events.
Bruce continued his strong come
back on Saturday with wins in the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke
events. Rogan also posted a strong
1,000-yard freestyle, with his win
ning time of 9:03.96 putting him third
in the nation.
Overall, the most impressive as
pect of the Cardinal's swimming was
not accomplished by individuals, but
by the team. Over the two-meet
span, the Cardinal lost only five of 26
total events. The team is shaping up
to be a true contender this season.
"Having the two meets back to
back allowed us to learn from our
first day races and then improve on
the events that we swam the second
day," explained junior Matt McDon
ald. "Perfecting the 'little things' is
very important heading into the
championship season."
The Cardinal will continue to
work on the 'little things' in two
weeks when they travel to southern
California to race in an exhibition
meet against Irvine Novaquatics and
in a Pac-10 meet against USC.

swimmiig. True to form, the Cardi
nal kicled off the meet against the
Wildcas by going 1-2 in the 400-yard
medle* relay. In the 1,000-yard
freestde, the Cardinal trio of
Markis Rogan, Shaun Phillips and
Michail McLean went 1-2-3 to give
the teim a commanding 31-4 lead
after jist two events. It was that kind
of day

The Cardinal would go on to vic
tories in 11 out of 13 events, winning
with a final score of 154-133. The
score was reasonably close because
the Cardinal went "unofficial" (not
counting the points) for the last two
events.
Bruce continued his strong come
back on Saturday with wins in the
100- and 200-yard breaststroke
events. Rogan also posted a strong
1,000-yard freestyle, with his win
ning time of 9:03.96 putting him third
in the nation.
Overall, the most impressive as
pect of the Cardinal's swimming was
not accomplished by individuals, but
by the team. Over the two-meet
span, the Cardinal lost only five of 26
total events. The team is shaping up
to be a true contender this season.
"Having the two meets back to
back allowed us to learn from our
first day races and then improve on
the events that we swam the second
day," explained junior Matt McDon
ald. "Perfecting the 'little things' is
very important heading into the
championship season."
The Cardinal will continue to
work on the 'little things' in two
weeks when they travel to southern
California to race in an exhibition
meet against Irvine Novaquatics and
in a Pac-10 meet against USC.
