## Vanderbilt looks into greek alcohol polity 
### KRISTIN SMITH VANDERBILT HUSTLER 
(U-WIRE) NASHVILLE, Tenn. — The Of
fice of Greek Life and the Panhellenic Council at
Vanderbilt are taking another look at greek alco
hol policies as three sorority houses are currently
under investigation for recent alcohol-related vio
lations.
The incidents include a new member from an
undisclosed house requiring medical attention
Monday, unauthorized drinking during Bid Day
activities and Sunday's car accident involving four
sorority members, according to greek life advisor
Kristin Torrey.
"Last year at this time some situations like this
solicited the creation of a new alcohol policy and
with any new policy, you need to have evaluations
and [the recent incidents] only add a reason to
reevaluate," Torrey said. "The seriousness of the
situations we are in must be dealt with as a com
munity and we need to protect our members as
well as all students."
Torrey and Panhellenic President Amy Dono
van met with the 10 house presidents Tuesday
night to discuss possible options for consequences
and ways to curb future alcohol violations.
"We discussed the idea of canceling all bid par
ties, but at this time we decided that was too rash
of a move to make," Donovan said.

Since the investigations are still ongoing for each
chapter involved, no punishments have been de
cided upon as of yet, though Kappa Alpha Theta's
centennial ball scheduled for next weekend has
been cancelled, Torrey said.
Torrey and Donovan both agreed that a major
problem lies in women drinking heavily before
sorority sponsored events such as Bid Day and
older members providing alcohol for underage
members.
The National Panhellenic Conference pro
hibits drinking on Bid Day.
"We discussed making the two hours before a
party a mandatory pre-party activity," Donovan
said. "In those two hours, you would be required to
go to dinner with you pledge class and come back
to the house for party pics, or something like that."
They also discussed bringing speakers to each
house who experienced a serious alcohol-related
incident within their own sorority house.
Donovan was adamant that Panhellenic aims to
prevent more alcohol-related incidents involving
sororities.
"If another incident happens, I would support
the removal of all social activities for all 10 chap
ters for the rest of the year," Donovan said. "I
don't think we should wait for someone to die. I
think greek women would give up their socials for
the lives of their sisters."
Torrey confirmed that those options were all dis

cussed, but none are final decisions.
"We need to have conversation with everyone:
The presidents, the new member educators, the
members. There is no answer thus far, but it's like
ly we'll be making some changes," she said.
Torrey said she felt the solution lied in all stu
dents showing "genuine care and concern for
those around them."
"It is not cool to sit and watch someone take 20
shots of vodka," she said. "My worst nightmare is
that one of our students dies."
The new alcohol rules passed in February 2003
included no hard liquor at fraternity parties, no al
cohol at new member events, required check-in
for sorority members going to off campus parties
and strict monitoring of "pre-party" consumption
of alcohol. These rules were passed after several
fraternities and sororities had alcohol-related in
cidents requiring medical care.
Jeanine Atkinson, director of the Office of Al
cohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Prevention, said
the next Greeks Advocating the Mature Manage
ment of Alcohol meeting required for Greek
members will focus on alcohol overdose.
"We are still supporting the amnesty clause for
students who take their friends to the hospital,
there should be no barriers," Atkinson said. "But
students need to start taking responsibility for
their own drinking habits and intervening when
others are drinking too much."
