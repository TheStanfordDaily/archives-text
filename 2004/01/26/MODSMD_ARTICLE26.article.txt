# UC students sue Gov. Schwarzenegger
## 
### CHARLES PROCTOR DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — Several stu
dents and the University of California Students
Association a system-wide lobbying organization
brought a lawsuit against the Schwarzenegger ad
ministration Wednesday, alleging that millions of
dollars in mid-year cuts to the UC were made ille
gally.
The petition, which was brought before the
state Supreme Court, seeks to block the imple
mentation of over $148 million in cuts that the
governor made in mid-December to various pro
grams, including the UC.
The lawsuit alleges that Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger overstepped his authority when
he bypassed the state Legislature to make the
cuts.
The suit was filed on behalf of UCS A, UCLA
second-year political science and Chicana/o stud
ies student Daniela Conde, one student from UC
Santa Barbara and two students from UC-Berke
ley. The Equal Justice Society and Californians
for Justice are also petitioners in the lawsuit.
The mid-year cuts to the UC wiped out funding
for the UC labor research institutes and cut out
reach funding to the UC by $33.3 million.
"The reasoning behind [the lawsuit] is pretty
simple we want the government and the people of
the state to understand the direct implication of
these mid-year budget cuts to the university and

the services they value," said Matt Kaczmarek,
the chairman of UCS A and internal vice president
of the Undergraduate Students Association
Council.
The mid-year cuts also drained general funds
that could have gone toward shoring up the gov
ernor's budget for the 2004-2005 fiscal year- a
budget that calls for $372 million in cuts to the UC,
Kaczmarek said.
Schwarzenegger's office referred questions
about the lawsuit to the state's Department of Fi
nance, which said the governor's actions were
legal.
"We wouldn't have taken this action unless
we were sure Schwarzenegger was on solid
legal ground in executing his executive branch
powers in the way that he did," said H.D.
Palmer, deputy director for the Department of
Finance.
The Equal Justice Society and Californians for
Justice signed on to the petition mostly because
they are worried about the cuts to outreach and
whether they will restrict access to higher educa
tion for minority students, representatives of the
two groups said.
The state Supreme Court must now decide
whether it will hear the case or hand it off to a
lower court.
The lawsuit's point of contention lies with two
budget statutes that dictate how and when the
governor can repeal the vehicle license fee, said
Nicholas van Aelstyn, a lawyer representing the

petitioners.
The petitioners say the governor violated one
statute when he repealed the vehicle license fee
without there being sufficient funds to make up
for the resulting budget gap.
Schwarzenegger repealed the license fee in an
executive order shortly after his inauguration, cre
ating a $4 billion gap in the state budget a gap
Schwarzenegger partially made up through cuts in
state funding.
The petitioners also say the governor did not
have the power to repeal the license fee or desig
nate cuts to the UC without consulting the state
Legislature.
"We believe [Schwarzenegger's] actions were
clearly in violation of the relevant statutes," van
Aelstyn said.
Kirk Stark, a UCLA law professor who spe
cializes in California law, said the basis of the law
suit has merit but budget statutes are often open
to interpretation, which may give the edge to
Schwarzenegger.
However, he added that the lawsuit does raise
some valid objections to the monetary shuffle
game that is the state budget process.
"Ultimately, I think this case is significant less
for its legal merit and more for its laudable politi
cal objections," he said.
"Stranger things have happened in California,
so the Supreme Court could decide it is now the
moment to do something surprising, but I'm a bit
skeptical," he added.
