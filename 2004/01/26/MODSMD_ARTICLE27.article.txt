### ADAM CAUSEY THE REVEILL 
(U-WIRE) BATONROUGE,
La. — The Louisiana Office of
Alcohol and Tobacco Control is
still analyzing evidence after the
December arrests of six men ac
cused of masterminding ; fake ID
ring to aid underage drinlers in al
cohol purchases.
Four of the arrested nen are
Louisiana State University stu
dents, and all six face praecution
for felony forgery charge; with a
maximum five-year prisonpenalty
and hard labor, authorities >aid.
All six men were released on
bond shortly after being aTested
by East Baton Rouge and Jeffer
son parish sheriff's officers.
A trial date has not beenset by
district attorneys in either paish.
East Baton Rouge Parish Sferiff's
officers arrested the followirg uni
versity students Dec. 10: Jeffrey
David Lee, 18, 4500 Buibank
Drive, Apt. 13103; and Jonithan
Courtney, 19, 3614 Brandon Lynn
Drive.
Brian Pontier, 19, 550 Lee
Drive, Apt. 8, also was arrested by
East Baton Rouge Parish officers
Dec. 10.
On Dec. 12 East Baton Rouge
Parish Sheriff's officers arrested
the following university students:
Bradley C. King, 20,2066 Burbank
Drive, Apt. 8; and Michael Keith
Nolan, 19,410 Jackson Hall.
Jefferson Parish officers arrested
Andrew Trujillo, 17, 4721 Acade
my Drive, Metairie, on Dec. 12.
All the men turned themselves
in to authorities.
Steve Spalitta, ATC director of
enforcement, said authorities will
continue searching for customers
who bought fake IDs from the six
men. Penalties for buyers will be le
nient if they voluntarily turn in
their fake IDs, he said.
ATC agents have not detei
mined whether buyers will face
criminal mischief charges or if they
will simply have to receive alcohol
use education. Spalitta did not
specify criminal mischief penalties
or mandatory education hours.
Spalitta said his office simply is
trying to stop future underage
drinking-related fatalities.
"We're not looking to trash the
career of college students," he said.
"We know the average kid's going
to toss the ID."
But Spalitta said simply throw
ing away fake IDs does not ensure
that customers will not be caught.
"The ID is their actual, definite
picture," he said. "Most — 99 per
cent — use their real name. They
just change their address."
ATC investigators also are
searching through records from
the six arrested men.
"The bottom line is we're more
than likely to have a positive ID on
[buyers]," Spalitta said.
The ATC started the investiga
tion that led to the arrests after the
Oct. 10 death of Corey Domingue,
a 19-year-old chemical engineering
sophomore.
Investigators said Domingue
died of alcohol poisoning.

In an Oct. 14, 2003, story in the
LSU student newspaper, Baton
Rouge Police Department Cpl.
Don Kelly said Domingue report
edly drank a fifth of rum in just a
few hours.
According to ATC records,
Domingue got his fake ID from
one of the six men who were ar
rested.
Don Moreau, East Baton
Rouge district attorney, said the six
men who were arrested are not fac
ing charges in Domingue's death,
and he was unsure whether charges
in the death will be pursued.
Domingue used the fake ID at
the Winn Dixie at the corner of
Burbank Drive and Lee Drive to
purchase the alcohol that eventual
ly led to his death.
Domingue used a Texas dri
ver's license although he lived in
Baton Rouge and was a Franklin,
La. native.
Spalitta said the fake IDs were
made from templates for Texas
and Iowa drivers licenses.
"They used Photoshop 7 soft
ware. It took 10 to 15 hours to
make the templates," he said. "It
took 15 minutes to make a single
driver's license according to one of
them [the suspects]."
Authorities estimated the six
suspects made at least hundreds, if
not thousands, of fake IDs and
charged from $100 to $200 per ID.
Since there are a number of Texas
residents attending the University,
Spalitta said many vendors would
not initially suspect the IDs. He
also said Texas driver's licenses
were easier to counterfeit than
Louisiana licenses.
Both states' licenses include
holograms, but the Texas IDs have
simply the word "Texas" in holo
graphic print. Louisiana licenses
include holographic prints of the
shape of the state, which are more
difficult to reproduce.
Nancy Mathews, executive di
rector of the Campus-Community
Coalition for Change, said college
culture emphasizes underage
drinking.
"I am saddened by these com
bined breaches of personal integri
ty because they placed other peo
ple in harm's way, both physically
and legally," she said.
Mathews said she plans for
CCCC to educate students more
about university alcohol polices
and the consequences for violating
those polices during the spring se
mester.
The fake ID crackdown is part
of the Responsible Vendor Act,
passed by the state legislature in
1997.
Murphy Painter, ATC commis
sioner, said at a press conference
Dec. 15 that almost 275,000 clerks
have completed the Responsible
Vendor Program since 2000. The
purpose of the program is to edu
cate vendors, their employees and
customers about responsible sell
ing, serving and consumption of al
cohol tobacco.
ATC statistics show that since
the act passed, underage alcohol
sales have fallen 65 percent at
stores and 79 percent at bars.

searching through records from
the six arrested men.
"The bottom line is we're more
than likely to have a positive ID on
[buyers]," Spalitta said.
The ATC started the investiga
tion that led to the arrests after the
Oct. 10 death of Corey Domingue,
a 19-year-old chemical engineering
sophomore.
Investigators said Domingue
died of alcohol poisoning.

In an Oct. 14, 2003, story in the
LSU student newspaper, Baton
Rouge Police Department Cpl.
Don Kelly said Domingue report
edly drank a fifth of rum in just a
few hours.
According to ATC records,
Domingue got his fake ID from
one of the six men who were ar
rested.
Don Moreau, East Baton
Rouge district attorney, said the six
men who were arrested are not fac
ing charges in Domingue's death,
and he was unsure whether charges
in the death will be pursued.
Domingue used the fake ID at
the Winn Dixie at the corner of
Burbank Drive and Lee Drive to
purchase the alcohol that eventual
ly led to his death.
Domingue used a Texas dri
ver's license although he lived in
Baton Rouge and was a Franklin,
La. native.
Spalitta said the fake IDs were
made from templates for Texas
and Iowa drivers licenses.
"They used Photoshop 7 soft
ware. It took 10 to 15 hours to
make the templates," he said. "It
took 15 minutes to make a single
driver's license according to one of
them [the suspects]."
Authorities estimated the six
suspects made at least hundreds, if
not thousands, of fake IDs and
charged from $100 to $200 per ID.
Since there are a number of Texas
residents attending the University,
Spalitta said many vendors would
not initially suspect the IDs. He
also said Texas driver's licenses
were easier to counterfeit than
Louisiana licenses.
Both states' licenses include
holograms, but the Texas IDs have
simply the word "Texas" in holo
graphic print. Louisiana licenses
include holographic prints of the
shape of the state, which are more
difficult to reproduce.
Nancy Mathews, executive di
rector of the Campus-Community
Coalition for Change, said college
culture emphasizes underage
drinking.
"I am saddened by these com
bined breaches of personal integri
ty because they placed other peo
ple in harm's way, both physically
and legally," she said.
Mathews said she plans for
CCCC to educate students more
about university alcohol polices
and the consequences for violating
those polices during the spring se
mester.
The fake ID crackdown is part
of the Responsible Vendor Act,
passed by the state legislature in
1997.
Murphy Painter, ATC commis
sioner, said at a press conference
Dec. 15 that almost 275,000 clerks
have completed the Responsible
Vendor Program since 2000. The
purpose of the program is to edu
cate vendors, their employees and
customers about responsible sell
ing, serving and consumption of al
cohol tobacco.
ATC statistics show that since
the act passed, underage alcohol
sales have fallen 65 percent at
stores and 79 percent at bars.
(U-WIRE) BATONROUGE,
La. — The Louisiana Office of
Alcohol and Tobacco Control is

and hard labor, authorities >aid.
All six men were released on
bond shortly after being aTested
by East Baton Rouge and Jeffer
son parish sheriff's officers.
A trial date has not beenset by
district attorneys in either paish.
East Baton Rouge Parish Sferiff's
officers arrested the followirg uni
versity students Dec. 10: Jeffrey
David Lee, 18, 4500 Buibank
Drive, Apt. 13103; and Jonithan
Courtney, 19, 3614 Brandon Lynn
Drive.
Brian Pontier, 19, 550 Lee
Drive, Apt. 8, also was arrested by
East Baton Rouge Parish officers
Dec. 10.
On Dec. 12 East Baton Rouge
Parish Sheriff's officers arrested
the following university students:
Bradley C. King, 20,2066 Burbank
Drive, Apt. 8; and Michael Keith
Nolan, 19,410 Jackson Hall.
Jefferson Parish officers arrested
Andrew Trujillo, 17, 4721 Acade
my Drive, Metairie, on Dec. 12.
All the men turned themselves
in to authorities.
Steve Spalitta, ATC director of
enforcement, said authorities will
continue searching for customers
who bought fake IDs from the six
men. Penalties for buyers will be le
nient if they voluntarily turn in
their fake IDs, he said.
ATC agents have not detei
mined whether buyers will face
criminal mischief charges or if they
will simply have to receive alcohol
use education. Spalitta did not
specify criminal mischief penalties
or mandatory education hours.
Spalitta said his office simply is
trying to stop future underage
drinking-related fatalities.
"We're not looking to trash the
career of college students," he said.
"We know the average kid's going
to toss the ID."
But Spalitta said simply throw
ing away fake IDs does not ensure
that customers will not be caught.
"The ID is their actual, definite
picture," he said. "Most — 99 per
cent — use their real name. They
just change their address."
ATC investigators also are
searching through records from
the six arrested men.
