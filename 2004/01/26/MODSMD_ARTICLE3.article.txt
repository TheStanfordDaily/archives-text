# Law prompts Stanford to change bookkeeping
## 
### LISE MARKEN 
Accounting scandals that have
rocked corporations in the past
few years may now lead to revised
governance policies at institu
tions outside the corporate sector,
including private nonprofit insti
tutions like Stanford.
Though the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, a federal law placing stricter
controls on corporate governance
practices, applies almost exclu
sively to publicly traded corpora
tions, it has spurred members of
the nonprofit community to call
for a reassessment of their own
governance practices.
"The passage of this bill should
serve as a wake-up call to the en
tire nonprofit community," says a
report recently released by Board
Source, a nonprofit governance
resource.
Board Source has teamed up
with Independent Sector to re

lease a set of guidelines for how
nonprofit institutions can update
their procedures to reflect the in
tent of Sarbanes-Oxley. Mean
while, Stanford has teamed up
with other universities to develop
another set of guidelines specifi
cally directed to institutes of
higher education, released by the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was
passed in 2002 in response to
charges that a number of large
corporations were involved in ac
counting fraud and insider trad
ing. The law attempts to ensure
that corporations have sufficient
internal controls in place to pre
vent these infractions and that the
board of directors and auditors of
a corporation are independent
enough to avoid conflicts of inter
est.

Though Stanford is not required
to abide by the provisions of that act,
the University finds them reason
able, according to Randy Livingston,
vice president of business affairs and
chief financial officer at Stanford's
Office of Business Affairs.
"The Trustees [and University
management] felt that many of the
provisions represent good manage
ment practice and should be adopted
as well," Livingston said.
For example, before Sarbanes-
Oxley, Stanford allowed its indepen
dent public accountant, Pricewater
house Coopers, to act as a consultant
to other parts of the University. The
independent public accountant's
main role is to conduct the Universi
ty's annual audit, and hiring the
same company as both an accoun

tant and a corsultant creates a con
flict of interes, calling into question
the objectivity of the audit. Stanford
put an end tc this practice in accor
dance with Scrbanes-Oxley.
Stanford has also given the Board
of Trustees Audit and Compliance
Committee 'a more direct role in
hiring the iidependent public ac
countants, nanaging their activities
and determning their fees," Liv
ingston said This measure is also in
tended to eisure the objectivity and
independent of the audit.
Howeve-, Stanford did not de
cide to pu all provisions of Sar
banes-Oxley into practice.
Section 104 of the bill, one of the
most well-known provisions, re
quires cooorations to certify to the
Securities and Exchange Commis
sion that 2 sufficient system of inter
nal controls is in place. However,
there is no equivalent organization
that Stanford can report to. It ap
proximates the requirement by pro
viding ar equivalent certification to

its independent public accountant.
A further requirement of Section
404 is that the accountant must certi
fy that the controls are in place.
However, this requirement is very
expensive to comply with, and, ac
cording to Livingston, "the audit
committee made the judgment that
it wasn't a worthwhile investment."
The extent to which universities
need to be concerned with comply
ing with the law is not clear, accord
ing to Economics Prof. John B.
Shoven.
"I think there is a difference [be
tween a University and a public cor
poration]," he said. "I don't think all
these [provisions] translate."
Shoven said the nature of the or
ganization should be taken into ac
count.
"It's not surprising that these
problems show up in the corporate
world where people are more likely
to be motivated by getting rich. Most
people in nonprofit are not motivat
ed by getting rich," he said.

Shoven also noted that universi
ties are already scrutinized by orga
nizations such as U.S. News & World
Report's university rankings.
"If the quality of a university goes
down, that gets out. There's no
shortage of information about col
leges," he said.
At the same time, however,
Shoven noted that some elements of
Sarbanes-Oxley do translate to uni
versities.
"The one that translates most is
re-checking controls so the top layer
of an organization is assured that
nothing inappropriate is going on at
lower levels," he said.
He also said the provisions that
deal with governance are important
for universities.
"You want to be sure that an in
dependent and knowledgeable
board of directors is looking over the
organization," he said. "[Being]
knowledgeable is as important as
[being] independent."

Oxley, Stanford allowed its indepen
dent public accountant, Pricewater
house Coopers, to act as a consultant
to other parts of the University. The
independent public accountant's
main role is to conduct the Universi
ty's annual audit, and hiring the
same company as both an accoun

tant and a corsultant creates a con
flict of interes, calling into question
the objectivity of the audit. Stanford
put an end tc this practice in accor
dance with Scrbanes-Oxley.
Stanford has also given the Board
of Trustees Audit and Compliance
Committee 'a more direct role in
hiring the iidependent public ac
countants, nanaging their activities
and determning their fees," Liv
ingston said This measure is also in
tended to eisure the objectivity and
independent of the audit.
Howeve-, Stanford did not de
cide to pu all provisions of Sar
banes-Oxley into practice.
Section 104 of the bill, one of the
most well-known provisions, re
quires cooorations to certify to the
Securities and Exchange Commis
sion that 2 sufficient system of inter
nal controls is in place. However,
there is no equivalent organization
that Stanford can report to. It ap
proximates the requirement by pro
viding ar equivalent certification to

its independent public accountant.
A further requirement of Section
404 is that the accountant must certi
fy that the controls are in place.
However, this requirement is very
expensive to comply with, and, ac
cording to Livingston, "the audit
committee made the judgment that
it wasn't a worthwhile investment."
The extent to which universities
need to be concerned with comply
ing with the law is not clear, accord
ing to Economics Prof. John B.
Shoven.
"I think there is a difference [be
tween a University and a public cor
poration]," he said. "I don't think all
these [provisions] translate."
Shoven said the nature of the or
ganization should be taken into ac
count.
"It's not surprising that these
problems show up in the corporate
world where people are more likely
to be motivated by getting rich. Most
people in nonprofit are not motivat
ed by getting rich," he said.

Shoven also noted that universi
ties are already scrutinized by orga
nizations such as U.S. News & World
Report's university rankings.
"If the quality of a university goes
down, that gets out. There's no
shortage of information about col
leges," he said.
At the same time, however,
Shoven noted that some elements of
Sarbanes-Oxley do translate to uni
versities.
"The one that translates most is
re-checking controls so the top layer
of an organization is assured that
nothing inappropriate is going on at
lower levels," he said.
He also said the provisions that
deal with governance are important
for universities.
"You want to be sure that an in
dependent and knowledgeable
board of directors is looking over the
organization," he said. "[Being]
knowledgeable is as important as
[being] independent."
Accounting scandals that have
rocked corporations in the past
few years may now lead to revised
governance policies at institu
tions outside the corporate sector,
including private nonprofit insti
tutions like Stanford.
Though the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, a federal law placing stricter
controls on corporate governance
practices, applies almost exclu
sively to publicly traded corpora
tions, it has spurred members of
the nonprofit community to call
for a reassessment of their own
governance practices.
"The passage of this bill should
serve as a wake-up call to the en
tire nonprofit community," says a
report recently released by Board
Source, a nonprofit governance
resource.
Board Source has teamed up
with Independent Sector to re

lease a set of guidelines for how
nonprofit institutions can update
their procedures to reflect the in
tent of Sarbanes-Oxley. Mean
while, Stanford has teamed up
with other universities to develop
another set of guidelines specifi
cally directed to institutes of
higher education, released by the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was
passed in 2002 in response to
charges that a number of large
corporations were involved in ac
counting fraud and insider trad
ing. The law attempts to ensure
that corporations have sufficient
internal controls in place to pre
vent these infractions and that the
board of directors and auditors of
a corporation are independent
enough to avoid conflicts of inter
est.

Though Stanford is not required
to abide by the provisions of that act,
the University finds them reason
able, according to Randy Livingston,
vice president of business affairs and
chief financial officer at Stanford's
Office of Business Affairs.
"The Trustees [and University
management] felt that many of the
provisions represent good manage
ment practice and should be adopted
as well," Livingston said.
