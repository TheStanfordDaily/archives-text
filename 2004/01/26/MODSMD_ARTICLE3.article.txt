# Law prompts Stanford to change bookkeeping

### LISE MARKEN 
Accounting scandals that have
rocked corporations in the past
few years may now lead to revised
governance policies at institu
tions outside the corporate sector,
including private nonprofit insti
tutions like Stanford.
Though the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, a federal law placing stricter
controls on corporate governance
practices, applies almost exclu
sively to publicly traded corpora
tions, it has spurred members of
the nonprofit community to call
for a reassessment of their own
governance practices.
"The passage of this bill should
serve as a wake-up call to the en
tire nonprofit community," says a
report recently released by Board
Source, a nonprofit governance
resource.
Board Source has teamed up
with Independent Sector to re

lease a set of guidelines for how
nonprofit institutions can update
their procedures to reflect the in
tent of Sarbanes-Oxley. Mean
while, Stanford has teamed up
with other universities to develop
another set of guidelines specifi
cally directed to institutes of
higher education, released by the
National Association of College
and University Business Officers.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was
passed in 2002 in response to
charges that a number of large
corporations were involved in ac
counting fraud and insider trad
ing. The law attempts to ensure
that corporations have sufficient
internal controls in place to pre
vent these infractions and that the
board of directors and auditors of
a corporation are independent
enough to avoid conflicts of inter
est.
