Gospel of Thomas" and scholar of early Christianity,
will present the Stanford Humanities Center's Harry

tives from the Gospel of Thomas" and on Wednesday on
"Politics and Religion: How and when do they begin to
separate?" She will also present two seminars on Jan. 27
and 29.
"Beyond Belief' explores the development of Christian
dogma through the lens of alternative early sources, especial
ly the Gospel of Thomas, a text which was uncovered in 1945

in Upper Egypt and which offers an alternative perspectives
on Jesus and other fundamental aspects of Christianity.
In 1979, Pagels won the National Book Award for her
book, "The Gnostic Gospels," which explored the texts un
covered with the Gospel of Thomas (known as the "Gnostic
Gospels").
Pagels is currently the Harrington Spear Paine Pro

deep Stanford roots. Her father was a professor of plant
biology and after having been raised at Stanford, she
went on to receive her bachelor's in history and her mas
ter's in classics at the University.
The Harry Camp Memorial Lectures are open to
the public; their purpose is to bring outstanding lec
turers to campus.
