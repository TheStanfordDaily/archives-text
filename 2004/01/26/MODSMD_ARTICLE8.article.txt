## Getting no love at Stanford? Joel Stein wants to help you out 
### JOEL STEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor's Note: I know that Valentine's Day is still three weeks
away, but what good is love advice on the day itself? You need
time to implement the sagacious advice of Joel Stein, former
writer for The Daily and currently a humor columnist with Time
magazine (see, some good things do come out of The Daily.)

Love. Exciting and new. Let it flow. Then run like hell.
That's right, kids, it's Valentine's Day, and you know what
that means. No, not misogynistic hair-treatments at the li
brary. It means Platonic discourses. So let's get right to it
then, shall we?
How do I, but a simple person, go about finding love?
Well, Polemarchus, some people say the easiest way to
find love is to let it come to you. Others say to go out and look
for it.
I say pretend you're dead. I'm talking the whole, Tom
Sawyer, feign-your-own-funeral, nine yards of it. Plan it out
way in advance. The month or two before the big day, meet
lots of really attractive people; become the editor of an L.A.
fashion magazine, do make-up for "Studs," offer to be one of
those kids who mop up sweat during women's volleyball
games — whatever it takes.
Then, when the time comes, scope out the people who
show up at the funeral. Nothing melts a heart quite like a res
urrection. Trust me, I know.
Oh wise one, what is love, and will it help me find an in
vestment-banking job?
No, Glaucon, love won't help you find a job, but it very
well may land you a big promotion somewhere down the
road. It's all how you play it.
The point is, love — like everything else you'll encounter
in your short, pathetic lives — is a power relationship. Some
one's calling the shots, and that person might as well be you.
So, next time you find yourself in love with that special some
one, ask yourself the following simple questions:
• Who actually decides whether you do Greek or
Japanese?
• Who sleeps on the side of the bed closer to the alarm
clock?
• Who does most of the work during sex?
• Who cleans up afterward?
• When eating meat, who eats no fat and who eats no lean?
• When you shower together, and there's only enough
conditioner for one of you, what usually happens?
• Are you, or have you ever been, a member of the League
of Revolutionary Struggle?
The most important thing to remember when using this
model of love is this: Orgasms are like victories. To think of
them otherwise is fooling yourself. The smartest thing you
can do is to keep an accurate tally sheet someplace incon
spicuous — like a bedpost. You'll thank me later.
What are love's exits and entrances?
Let me inform you, Adiemantus, of the five stages of every
relationship, so that you too can avoid the mewling and puk
ing that accompanies them.
Stage One: Vague Attraction. Excited stage in which you
pose incomprehensible, hypothetical questions to your
friends, such as: "If you liked someone, and you said 'Hi' and
they said 'Bonjour,' does that mean they're not interested?"
Stage Two: Initial Hook-Up. Usually marked by fear, pas
sion, relief and the instantaneous revival of fear. Next few
days marked by avoidance of person, but constant, unspoken
questions about what they are thinking. Possibly the most
thrilling, rewarding stage. Cherish it.
Stage Three: Coupling Up. Complete loss of indepen
dence. Clothes are shared in frightening combinations;
strange, regressive, mother-son-like speech patterns are
formed; studying becomes strange, useless mating ritual.
Opinion is formed about every restaurant in Palo Alto. Meal
card is given to friends in cheap, unsuccessful attempt to buy
their lost affection.
Stage Four: Beginning Of The End. Conversations stop
making sense. Discussions erratically waver between the
completely mundance ("What movie are we getting
tonight?") and the completely metaphysical ("I just don't
think it's working." "But I'll change." "But then you
wouldn't be you, and that's what I really like about you —
that yowness.")
Stage Five: The Dump. Usually marked by fear, passion,
relief and the instantaneous revival of fear. Next few days
marked by avoidance of person, but constant, unspoken
questions about what they are thinking. Possibly the most
thrilling, rewarding stage. Cherish it.
How can I be sure that this wonderful, beautiful experience
I call love isn't really making me terribly unhappy somewhere
deep inside?
The fear that total bliss is constricting your opportunities
and / or maturation as an individual is a complete sickness,
Crito. You are destined for a life of discontent, regret and
painfully expensive calls to that Jean Dixon 900-number.
Save yourself the pain and become a lawyer.
What do I do for Valentine's Day if I'm in a long-distance
relationship, and what role will Merlin Olson wind up play
ing?
Listen, any relationship where two people are separated
by more than eight or nine inches is a complete lie. Do your
self a favor and throw away the fantasy that 3,000 miles (or
the lounge between Paloma and Gavilan) has allowed you to
create. Come back home, Phaedo.
What can I, oh brave thinker, do to put my life back in some
kind of order after being used as love's bedpan?
There's only one solution to a broken heart, and that's re
venge. That's right, until you get that other person back, I
mean really get them back, you'll never be free. I mean never.
So get out there, Euthyphro, and do some damage. Don't be
afraid of the police. If they interfere, use the phrase "domes
tic dispute." They'll understand and leave you alone.
Hey, all in all, it's better to have loved and lost than to
spend your Valentine's Day going stag to the Governor's
Corner semi-formal.
But at least it's cheaper.
