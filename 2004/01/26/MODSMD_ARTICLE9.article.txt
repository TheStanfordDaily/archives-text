# SUPER-SIZE ME
## As fast-food portions get bigger, so do Americans' waistlines. The 'super-size' trend has even found its way into some home kitchens, say researchers. 
### Manette Newbold UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY 
(U-WIRE) — According to a Washington Uni
versity at St. Louis Web site, two-thirds of United
States citizens are overweight or obese. The ques
tion may be: Is bigger really better?
Larger portions and increased consumption is
widening today's society, putting more people at
risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood
pressure, cancer and a decreased quality of life.
The Washington University site stated that "al-

though it's true
that sedentary
lifestyles and
lack of exercise
put us at risk for
weight gain, it's
also true that
many Americans
are eating and
drinking more
than ever be
fore."
That same site
compared statis
tics from 1977
and today. On a
per-serving basis,
today's average
American con
sumes 93 more
calories per serv
ing of salty
snacks (e.g. pota
to chips, pretzels
and popcorn), 49
more calories per
serving of soft
drinks, 97 more
calories per serv
ing of hamburg
ers and 133 more
calories per serv
ing of Mexican
food (burritos,
tacos, enchi
ladas).
Between 1977
and 1996, salty
snacks, desserts,
soft drinks, burg
ers, French fries
and Mexican
food all have in
creased in size
and calories, ac
cording to a
study by the
Journal of the
American Medi
cal Association.
A study at the
University of
North Carolina
at Chapel Hill
proves that re
search correct.
Study co-au
thor Barry Pop
kin, a professor
of nutrition at
Chapel Hill, re
vealed that the
only fast-food
category whose
average portions

did not increase was
pizza, but even that
may be headed in the

same direction as restaurants introduce extra
cheesy crusts.
During the past 20 years:
• Hamburgers have expanded by 23 percent.
• A plate of Mexican food is 27 percent bigger.
• Snacks, whether potato chips, pretzels or crack
ers, are 60 percent larger.
Solid food isn't the only problem either. Popkin's
research also showed that soft drinks have increased
in size by 52 percent.
Lee Darley, a registered dietitian at the Utah
State University Student Health and Wellness Cen
ter, said, "If you think about soda pop ... when they
originally came out with the regular sodas, it was
like an eight-ounce bottle. And then, you know, we
went to the 12-ounce can and now we're to the 20-
ounce bottle and then the 1-liter bottle as one serv
ing."
Fountain drinks have also gone from big to gar
gantuan. In 1973, 7-Eleven introduced its popular
Gulp drinks in two sizes: 12- and 20-ounces. Today,
the drinks come in four sizes. The standard gulp is 16

ounces. The Double Gulp comes in at 64 ounces —
that's half a gallon and about 800 calories.
Darley also said the problem isn't just the size,
but the amount of time we give ourselves to drink
these larger portions.
"Society has gotten to be a much more fast-paced
society," he said. "Women are in the work force as
well. Traditionally, women were at home cooking
meals but now that they're in the work force, time is
of the essence so quick meals are easy, so people are
eating out more."
As fast food portions have risen, Darley added,

so has weight gain.
But eating out is not the only problem. Portions
at home have also been increasing. Darley said that
since we get accustomed to eating more from other
places, it continues in the home. He also said that it's
easy to eat a lot without even knowing it.
"If you sit down in front of the TV and you grab
the potato chip bag, you go on auto pilot," Darley
said. "You don't really realize how much you've
eaten because if it's just in the bag, you just keep dip
ping."
And all this means ...
As of January 2003, the Journal of The American
Dietetic Association found serving sizes on soda
have increased 2 ounces, orange juice, 1 ounce and
beer, 8 ounces.
If a person were to consume an extra 2 ounces of
soda a day for the whole year, by Dec. 31, that per
son would have added a total of 9,000 calories and a
three-pound weight gain to his / her diet. And that
doesn't include the calories or pounds gained by a

person who also drinks alcohol or juice, too.
Darley said, "If you go from a regular whopper
meal to an extra value meal that is not super-sized,
it's 1,200 calories. If you go up to super-sizing it adds
an extra 300 calories."
He figured that if a person were to super-size
once a week, he / she would gain an extra four and a
half pounds by year's end.
"You can see how small portions can add up over
a year," he said. "Slowly, you're putting it on and at
the end of the year you'll be heavier from last year's
resolution."

And it all started ...
In "Portion Distortion
— You don't Know the
Half of It," at
www.newamerica.net,
writer Shannon Brownlee
informed readers about the
truth behind bigger por
tions, fast-food and super
sizing.
She wrote, "Readers of
certain age can remember
a time when a trip to Mc-
Donald's seemed like a
treat and when a small bag
of French fries, a plain
hamburger and a 12-ounce
soda seemed like a full
meal. Fast food wasn't any
healthier back then; we
simply ate a lot less of it."
Brownlee explained
that today's oversized ap
petites have to do with
marketing strategies.
In 1983, when John
Marin became CEO of the
Taco Bell franchise he met
with Elliot Bloom, a young
marketer who had discov
ered that people didn't
care so much what they
were eating at fast food
restaurants, but liked the
idea that it was cheap and
easy "to-go" food.
Martin figured he could
capture a larger market if
Taco Bell lowered its main
menu prices: it worked.
People didn't spend less;
instead, they ordered
more.

By the late 1980s, sever
al fast-food franchises had
slashed their prices to the
minimum and restaurants
needed a new way to entice
consumers. What they
found was super-sizing.
By 1988, McDonald's
had introduced a 32-ounce
"super-size" soda and
"super-size" fries. Now,
super-sizing is in several
fast-food restaurants and
companies aren't losing a
dime. Rather, they are
making larger profits.
Darley said it's a bonus
for the producer and the
consumer. The producer
gets richer while the con-
* * * 1

sumer is receiving a bet
ter deal.
Ashley Harris, the assis-

tant manager of Logan's Taco Time, said customers
are eating more combo meals now and receiving dis
counts on fries and drinks that way. She also said
that although most of their food has stayed the same
in size, soft tacos have grown a little and drinks have
jumped from 32- to 44-ounces.
Will it ever end?
"I think super-sizing will get to a point where it
does have to slow down," Darley said. "At some
point people aren't going to be able to drink that
much even though it's a good deal. But still, what
they're at now could allow for a steady weight gain
for a long, long time."
Until the super-sized epidemic slows, however,
Darley said people can simply be more conscien
tious about their portion sizes and add exercise to
their lives.
"Are you walking up to school or are you taking
the bus or driving? Do you take the elevator or the
stairs?" he asked. "Daily activity matters. It can add
up."

Average Fast Food Portions: Increase over last 20 years

MARGO THOMA/The Stanford Daily
(U-WIRE) — According to a Washington Uni
versity at St. Louis Web site, two-thirds of United
States citizens are overweight or obese. The ques
tion may be: Is bigger really better?
Larger portions and increased consumption is
widening today's society, putting more people at
risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high blood
pressure, cancer and a decreased quality of life.
The Washington University site stated that "al-

though it's true
that sedentary
lifestyles and
lack of exercise
put us at risk for
weight gain, it's
also true that
many Americans
are eating and
drinking more
than ever be
fore."
That same site
compared statis
tics from 1977
and today. On a
per-serving basis,
today's average
American con
sumes 93 more
calories per serv
ing of salty
snacks (e.g. pota
to chips, pretzels
and popcorn), 49
more calories per
serving of soft
drinks, 97 more
calories per serv
ing of hamburg
ers and 133 more
calories per serv
ing of Mexican
food (burritos,
tacos, enchi
ladas).
Between 1977
and 1996, salty
snacks, desserts,
soft drinks, burg
ers, French fries
and Mexican
food all have in
creased in size
and calories, ac
cording to a
study by the
Journal of the
American Medi

A study at the
University of
North Carolina

proves that re
search correct.
Study co-au
thor Barry Pop
kin, a professor
of nutrition at
Chapel Hill, re
vealed that the
only fast-food
category whose
average portions

did not increase was
pizza, but even that
may be headed in the

same direction as restaurants introduce extra
cheesy crusts.
During the past 20 years:
• Hamburgers have expanded by 23 percent.
• A plate of Mexican food is 27 percent bigger.
• Snacks, whether potato chips, pretzels or crack
ers, are 60 percent larger.
Solid food isn't the only problem either. Popkin's
research also showed that soft drinks have increased
in size by 52 percent.
Lee Darley, a registered dietitian at the Utah
State University Student Health and Wellness Cen
ter, said, "If you think about soda pop ... when they
originally came out with the regular sodas, it was
like an eight-ounce bottle. And then, you know, we
went to the 12-ounce can and now we're to the 20-
ounce bottle and then the 1-liter bottle as one serv
ing."
Fountain drinks have also gone from big to gar
gantuan. In 1973, 7-Eleven introduced its popular
Gulp drinks in two sizes: 12- and 20-ounces. Today,
the drinks come in four sizes. The standard gulp is 16

ounces. The Double Gulp comes in at 64 ounces —
that's half a gallon and about 800 calories.
Darley also said the problem isn't just the size,
but the amount of time we give ourselves to drink
these larger portions.
"Society has gotten to be a much more fast-paced
society," he said. "Women are in the work force as
well. Traditionally, women were at home cooking
meals but now that they're in the work force, time is
of the essence so quick meals are easy, so people are
eating out more."
As fast food portions have risen, Darley added,

so has weight gain.
But eating out is not the only problem. Portions
at home have also been increasing. Darley said that
since we get accustomed to eating more from other
places, it continues in the home. He also said that it's
easy to eat a lot without even knowing it.
"If you sit down in front of the TV and you grab
the potato chip bag, you go on auto pilot," Darley
said. "You don't really realize how much you've
eaten because if it's just in the bag, you just keep dip
ping."
And all this means ...
As of January 2003, the Journal of The American
Dietetic Association found serving sizes on soda
have increased 2 ounces, orange juice, 1 ounce and
beer, 8 ounces.
If a person were to consume an extra 2 ounces of
soda a day for the whole year, by Dec. 31, that per
son would have added a total of 9,000 calories and a
three-pound weight gain to his / her diet. And that
doesn't include the calories or pounds gained by a

person who also drinks alcohol or juice, too.
Darley said, "If you go from a regular whopper
meal to an extra value meal that is not super-sized,
it's 1,200 calories. If you go up to super-sizing it adds
an extra 300 calories."
He figured that if a person were to super-size
once a week, he / she would gain an extra four and a
half pounds by year's end.
"You can see how small portions can add up over
a year," he said. "Slowly, you're putting it on and at
the end of the year you'll be heavier from last year's
resolution."

As of January 2003, the Journal of The American
Dietetic Association found serving sizes on soda
have increased 2 ounces, orange juice, 1 ounce and
beer, 8 ounces.
If a person were to consume an extra 2 ounces of
soda a day for the whole year, by Dec. 31, that per
son would have added a total of 9,000 calories and a
three-pound weight gain to his / her diet. And that
doesn't include the calories or pounds gained by a

person who also drinks alcohol or juice, too.
Darley said, "If you go from a regular whopper
meal to an extra value meal that is not super-sized,
it's 1,200 calories. If you go up to super-sizing it adds
an extra 300 calories."
He figured that if a person were to super-size
once a week, he / she would gain an extra four and a
half pounds by year's end.
"You can see how small portions can add up over
a year," he said. "Slowly, you're putting it on and at
the end of the year you'll be heavier from last year's
resolution."

And it all started ...
In "Portion Distortion
— You don't Know the
Half of It," at
www.newamerica.net,
writer Shannon Brownlee
informed readers about the
truth behind bigger por
tions, fast-food and super
sizing.
She wrote, "Readers of
certain age can remember
a time when a trip to Mc-
Donald's seemed like a
treat and when a small bag
of French fries, a plain
hamburger and a 12-ounce
soda seemed like a full
meal. Fast food wasn't any
healthier back then; we
simply ate a lot less of it."
Brownlee explained
that today's oversized ap
petites have to do with
marketing strategies.
In 1983, when John
Marin became CEO of the
Taco Bell franchise he met
with Elliot Bloom, a young
marketer who had discov
ered that people didn't
care so much what they
were eating at fast food
restaurants, but liked the
idea that it was cheap and
easy "to-go" food.
Martin figured he could
capture a larger market if
Taco Bell lowered its main
menu prices: it worked.
People didn't spend less;
instead, they ordered
more.

By the late 1980s, sever
al fast-food franchises had
slashed their prices to the
minimum and restaurants
needed a new way to entice
consumers. What they
found was super-sizing.
By 1988, McDonald's
had introduced a 32-ounce
"super-size" soda and
"super-size" fries. Now,
super-sizing is in several
fast-food restaurants and
companies aren't losing a
dime. Rather, they are
making larger profits.
Darley said it's a bonus
for the producer and the
consumer. The producer
gets richer while the con-
* * * 1

sumer is receiving a bet
ter deal.
Ashley Harris, the assis-

tant manager of Logan's Taco Time, said customers
are eating more combo meals now and receiving dis
counts on fries and drinks that way. She also said
that although most of their food has stayed the same
in size, soft tacos have grown a little and drinks have
jumped from 32- to 44-ounces.
Will it ever end?
"I think super-sizing will get to a point where it
does have to slow down," Darley said. "At some
point people aren't going to be able to drink that
much even though it's a good deal. But still, what
they're at now could allow for a steady weight gain
for a long, long time."
Until the super-sized epidemic slows, however,
Darley said people can simply be more conscien
tious about their portion sizes and add exercise to
their lives.
"Are you walking up to school or are you taking
the bus or driving? Do you take the elevator or the
stairs?" he asked. "Daily activity matters. It can add
up."
