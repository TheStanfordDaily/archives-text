# Special fees refund requests double; ASSU program faces bankruptcy
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The special fees system stands on the verge of a
monumental change, owing to a near-doubling of
refund requests in the past two years. ASSU lead
ers have drafted a number of proposed short-term
and long-term remedies which they will discuss
with other student representatives this week and
with the entire student population at a public
forum on Thursday at 8 p.m. in Tresidder Union.
The special fees system allows groups to peti
tion the student body for funding. The requests
are put to a campus-wide vote in spring. A 1972
student-led initiative, later enshrined in the ASSU
constitution, allows students to request refunds
from any special fees groups to which they are ide
ologically opposed or from which they do not re
ceive any benefit.
"There's been a big spike in refund requests
this year," said Kyle Alisharan, the ASSU finan
cial manager. "The numbers are staggering. While
the refund rate typically hovers around 8 percent,
fall quarter's rate surpassed 14 percent. Since re

fund requests carry over from one quarter to the
next, the winter quarter numbers, which will be re
leased later this week, will almost definitely be
higher."
These numbers cement a trend that began last
year, when a refund rate of 6.6 percent in fall quar
ter jumped to 13.2 percent in winter and then 17.2
percent in spring.
Short-term concern: avert bankruptcy
Now student leaders are facing the difficult
task of averting the bankruptcy of the special fees
system.
"The system would not keep running if this re
fund rate continued," said Senate Chair Josh
Shipp, a junior.
"If the special fee system bankrupted, student
life would be dramatically different," said ASSU
vice-president Joey Natoli, a junior. "It would be
the end of student life on campus. It would take
forever to rebuild the system, let alone the loss of
confidence based on the bankruptcy."
