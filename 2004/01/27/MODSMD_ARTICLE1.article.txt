# Special fees refund requests double; ASSU program faces bankruptcy
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The special fees system stands on the verge of a
monumental change, owing to a near-doubling of
refund requests in the past two years. ASSU lead
ers have drafted a number of proposed short-term
and long-term remedies which they will discuss
with other student representatives this week and
with the entire student population at a public
forum on Thursday at 8 p.m. in Tresidder Union.
The special fees system allows groups to peti
tion the student body for funding. The requests
are put to a campus-wide vote in spring. A 1972
student-led initiative, later enshrined in the ASSU
constitution, allows students to request refunds
from any special fees groups to which they are ide
ologically opposed or from which they do not re
ceive any benefit.
"There's been a big spike in refund requests
this year," said Kyle Alisharan, the ASSU finan
cial manager. "The numbers are staggering. While
the refund rate typically hovers around 8 percent,
fall quarter's rate surpassed 14 percent. Since re

fund requests carry over from one quarter to the
next, the winter quarter numbers, which will be re
leased later this week, will almost definitely be
higher."
These numbers cement a trend that began last
year, when a refund rate of 6.6 percent in fall quar
ter jumped to 13.2 percent in winter and then 17.2
percent in spring.
Short-term concern: avert bankruptcy
Now student leaders are facing the difficult
task of averting the bankruptcy of the special fees
system.
"The system would not keep running if this re
fund rate continued," said Senate Chair Josh
Shipp, a junior.
"If the special fee system bankrupted, student
life would be dramatically different," said ASSU
vice-president Joey Natoli, a junior. "It would be
the end of student life on campus. It would take
forever to rebuild the system, let alone the loss of
confidence based on the bankruptcy."

When this past fall's numbers
showed that last year's trend of in
creased refund requests was not
temporary, the Senate appointed a
committee to examine the phenom
enon and propose solutions.
To address the most immediate
problem of avoiding bankruptcy,
the committee proposed a number
of ideas, including raising the

spring fee amount by $5 for under
graduates and $1 for graduate stu
dents.
A more controversial suggestion
for a short-term fix is to pull money
out of the reserve accounts of stu
dent groups. Reserve funds are
monies that go unused by a group
one year and carry over to the next;
the group must petition the Senate
to tap into them. The leaders of
about a dozen student organizations
frith high refund rates have already
been notified by Alisharan that their
groups may lose some or all of their

reserves.
Alisharan, Natoli and Shipp
made it clear that none of these pro
posals are firm and that student
input is welcome. They also stressed
that they intend to leave groups' op
erating budgets untouched.
"We're completely open to pub
lic input," Shipp said.
Long-term concerns
The committee is worried about
the future of the special fees system;
such high refund rates are not sus
tainable.

Both Natoli and Alisharan
stressed that there is a discrepancy
between the way students view their
vote for a special fees group and
their request for a refund. Ideally,
students would only request refunds
from groups that they did not vote
for and were either ideologically op
posed or received no benefit from.
However, students have come to
view the refunds as free money.
"There's a disconnect between
what voting signifies and what ask
ing for a refund signifies," Alisha
ran said.

"People see that they can get a
check for $88 and they think, 'That's
a lot of beer,' " Natoli added.
Simply doing away with refunds
is not viewed as a likely possibility
â€” it would require a 2/3 vote of the
student population and could en
counter legal opposition. However,
Shipp said that one long-term solu
tion involves stricter criteria for spe
cial fee seekers. The current system
allows most groups onto the ballot
and then asks students to decide
whether they are fee-worthy or not.
Shipp said that this method simply is

not working.
Other long-term solutions that
the committee proposed include in
creasing efforts to educate voters
and possibly introducing a partial
refund system, which would allow
students to finance a portion of a
group's request.
"Special fees used to only be of
fered once every two years," Al
isharan said. "They were seen as
being outside the normal funding
pool. Nobody regards special fees as
special anymore. It's like groups'
yearly operating budget."
