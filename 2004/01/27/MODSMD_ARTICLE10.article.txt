Cracks in Earth's
natural space defenses

Earth's magnetic field has cracks that
let in space storms, according to a study
published in last month's Nature. Our
planet's magnetic field emanates from the

poles and extends way
past the atmosphere. It
absorbs the brunt of
solar storms — huge
clouds of charged parti
cles, ions and electrons
— that occur quite fre
quently. The thing is that
our magnetosphere ac
tually has natural holes
through which damag-

ing radiation can get through. Coronal
mass ejections, the most dangerous type of
solar storm, can then breach into the Earth
and damage satellite systems and even
land-based telecommunications. The
crack observed by the authors of the study
was as large as California.

We do not sell modified animals
California state regulators refused to
allow sales of a bio-engineered pet, citing
ethical concerns. GloFish is a zebra fish
that glows fluorescently. Commissioner
Sam Schuchat told the Canadian press:
"For me it's a question of values, it's
not a question of science. I think selling ge
netically modified fish as pets is wrong."
Yorktown Technologies of Texas, which
has the license to market the fish, argued
that the altered fish tolerate cold less than
the natural zebra fish and thus would not
survive California waters. Currently a
major environmental concern is that ge
netically modified farmed fish such as
salmon could get loose and devastate the
state's wild populations.
Finding mammoths
Japanese officials organizing a world
fair in 2005 are combing Siberia in search
of an intact, frozen mammoth. The fair
will count with 120 countries and its theme
is the wisdom of nature. According to lat
est studies, mammoths were hunted to ex
tinction by North American humans
12,000 to 13,000 years ago. Body parts of
infant mammoths have been found in the
past but the committee is hoping to score a
first by digging up a frozen adult mam
moth buried intact. If a preserved adult is
found special techniques will be needed to
dig it and transport to Japan. Attempts at
cloning the long-extinct mammal have
failed because none of the DNA samples
found were of high enough quality.
Reducing stroke damage
A recent study at the University of
Massachusetts-Dartmouth suggests that
cranberries might reduce brain damage
associated with stroke. Using rat brains to
simulate a stroke, the researchers found
that concentrated cranberry extract re
duced death of cells by as much as 50 per
cent. Catherine Neto, the lead author in
the study, said in a press release. "[This
study shows that cranberries] may not stop
a stroke from occurring initially, but it may
reduce the severity of the stroke." The
team currently does not know the amount
of cranberry juice needed for optical ef
fects. They also do not know the proper
ties responsible for the protective effect
but they believe it is due to a class of an
tioxidants known as anthocyanins, also
found in blueberries
Focusing Light
Three researchers from University of
Erlangen-Niirnberg in Germany claim to
have focused light down to the smallest
size ever. The trio produced a spot of 0.06
square microns using a radially polarized
beam from a helium-neon laser. Compar
atively, the width of a human hair is six or
ders of magnitude larger than this area.
According to the authors the theoretical
minimum size using their method is 0.26
square angstroms which is six orders of
magnitude smaller than the current
record.
Plasma Needle
Physicists and bioengineers in the
Netherlands have developed a new plas
ma-based approach to help medical proce
dures. Plasma are ionized gases at very
high temperatures. This is not to be con
fused with the blood particles of same
name: This plasma is actually a state of
matter (scientists currently recognize five
— solid, liquid, gas, plasma, Bose-Einstein
condensate). The problem is plasma typi
cally occurs at temperatures that would
kill living beings. The team developed a
needle whose tip as an electric field high
enough to ionize gas but still keeping tem
perature low. This way, physicians can use
it to remove diseased tissue and sterilize
wounds with extreme precision.
