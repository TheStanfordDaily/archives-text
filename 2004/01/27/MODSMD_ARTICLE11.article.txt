ogists are shaking things up with a new method that may allow scientists to pre
dict earthquakes months in advance.
The team of scientists from Russia, United States, Japan and France included
experts in pattern recognition, geodynamics and statistical physics. They have al
ready successfully predicted two earthquakes, including the recent earthquake
of magnitude 6.5 that struck San Simeon, Calif., in late December.
Short-term earthquake prediction is a field that has garnered little success;
many scientists believe prediction is generally

impossible.
"People have tried a wide range of methods
for many decades and so far none of them have
worked on a time scale shorter than a decade,"
said John Vidale, interim director of the Insti
tute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at
UCLA.
Reliable earthquake predictions could save
millions of lives and billions of dollars in dam
ages, as well as prevent ecological disaster.
Scientists heavily base earthquake predic
tions on subtle, but detectable signals that
emerge before strong earthquakes. Scientists
have studied a host of potential warning signals
known as precursors, which include foreshocks
and even weird animal behavior.
The team approached the problem of earth
quake prediction as one of pattern recognition.
The goal was to find precursory patterns of
medium and low magnitude earthquake se
quences that could signal a larger earthquake
in the future, said Vladimir Keilis-Borok, the
team's leader and professor in residence at
IGPP.
The researchers looked for patterns reflect
ing a rise in earthquake occurrences and earth
quake clustering in space and time.
The team also looked for simultaneous oc
currences of earthquakes at increasing dis
tances, and a rise in the ratio of medium mag
nitude earthquakes to smaller earthquakes.
The detection of these patterns is utilized by
the team to make their predictions.
Predictions made decades before the actual
quake are known as long-term, while interme
diate-term predictions are made years in ad
vance. Those made months before are called
short-term and immediate predictions come
within days or less.
Precursors are also divided by the same time
intervals. Previous studies looked for interme
diate-term precursors to determine the possi
bility of a large earthquake.
"In the new approach we study short-term
precursors in conjunction with intermediate
term ones," Keilis-Borok said.
The team considered a chain of earthquakes
as a possible short-term precursor. In the area
where a chain emerged, researchers looked for
intermediate-term precursors.
"If they were present, the chain is recog
nized as actual precursor, and a nine-month
alarm starts for that area," Keilis-Borok said.
If no intermediate-term precursors were pre
sent, then the chain of earthquakes was disre
garded.
In July, the team used this method to pre
dict an earthquake in Japan of magnitude 7
or higher by the end of December. A magni
tude 8.1 earthquake struck Hokkaido in late
September.
With two successes and no misses, the team

plans to continue testing and collecting more data to improve their prediction
method.
Most seismologists are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
"Ordinarily, I wouldn't believe it for a minute, but since his first two guess
es are right, we have to take this seriously," Vidale said.
"This appears to have some preliminary successes, but no one is sure yet and
time will tell," said professor of geophysics Emily Brodski.
The group is reluctant to release earthquake predication dates to the gen
eral public for fear of panic and economic damage, but they are watching for
a magnitude 6.4 or higher earthquake by September south of the Mojave
Desert.
