### ROBBIE YAN I GOT GAME [THEORY] 
I personally relish applying mathemati
cal models to the analysis of fascinating phe
nomena that would otherwise be character
ized as a part of the dull daily routine. As
this is my last "I Got Game [Theory]" col
umn, I would like to sample as many such
models as possible to engage the readers' in
terest in this hobby of mine.
Some of the models that I arrived at in pre
vious columns are for entertainment purposes
and don't explain anything. For instance, the
columns on the four axioms of dating were im
practical and I hope that no CS majors fol
lowed my advice. The other models, however,
although not yet entirely applicable, more or
less provide insight into the matters of focus.
For example, the usage of normal distribution
curve to deduce the ideal heights for men and
women provides some interesting results. The
following are two other cases where game the
ory can be applied.
During my dorm's ski trip two weeks
ago, I was enjoying a spectacular view of tall
pine trees outside of our cabin when I sud
denly stumbled upon a question: Why do
these trees have to grow this tall? The bio
logical reason seems straightforward: It's in
their genes â€” the DNA's dictate their
tremendous heights. However, over the
course of evolution, what forces have
shaped their blueprints to inject such a high

amount of growth hormone? Game theory
is somewhat helpful in reasoning for the an
swer: Each tree has one of two choices, stay
short or grow tall. What influences its choice
can be simplified as the amount of sunlight
it receives. If it stays short while others stay
short, its payoff is high due to ample amount
of sunshine; if it stays short while its neigh
bors grow tall, its payoff plummets as fair
share of the light is blocked by its neighbors;
if it grows tall when others stay short, its
payoff is high; and finally, if it grows tall
while others grow tall, its payoff is probably
the same as the aforementioned first case.
No matter what decisions other trees make,
each tree benefits the most by growing tall,
hence "the race all the way to the top."
The other scenario illustrating game the
ory at work is a decision that almost all Stan
ford students need to make daily: whether
to steer left or right or stop when encoun
tering an incoming biker on a narrow street.
Well, in this case, the payoff matrix will be
three-by-three since each person can make
one of three choices. A simple analysis will
show that very likely, both people will stop
their bikes because of the high negative pay
off of a head-on collision.
Not only does mathematical modeling il
lustrate logical connections between seem
ingly unrelated occurrences (as pinpointed
above), it also identifies the essence of
things with its simplistic expressions. Take a
symphony piece as an example: We can

view the entire piece as a vector in an N-di
mensional space, where N equals the num
ber of instruments employed in that sym
phony. If we project that symphony onto
the N base vectors, we would obtain the
sounds made by each individual instrument.
Folks into signal processing and Fourier
transform will recognize that we could view
each instrument as a base frequency and ex
tracting each instrument's contribution to
the piece is like taking the Fourier trans
form of the piece and obtaining the ampli
tude at each frequency.
Finally, if you are interested in modeling
life itself with math, we could view each in
dividual life as a finite state machine. The
states associated with the machine include
happiness, disappointment, excitement, re
gret etc. The alphabet that this machine ex
amines is daily occurrences in life. As things
happen, we jump from one state to another,
following the transition rules that we have
established for ourselves. As time evolves,
we constantly attempt to modify our transi
tion rules so that we can frequently visit the
states of pleasure and avoid those of de
pression. A wonderful life, then, could per
haps be characterized as a finite state ma
chine where all or most transitions lead to
states of happiness. Another way to per
ceive this model is that a wonderful life is a
finite state machine whose final state is one
of happiness and whose language it recog
nizes is the set of all daily occurrences.

Back to the topic of love, game theory
and other mathematical modeling methods
also lend help to explain patterns in dating.
One plausible reason for male aggression
and female selection of qualified candidates
in the mating business is that eggs are less
frequently produced than sperms. Hence,
males chasing after females seems to opti
mize the quality of the next generation.
I still have a hodgepodge of phenomena
that can be interestingly modeled with
math. For those of you who are fuzzy-sub
ject inclined, I challenge you to explore an
other dimension of your intelligence by
picking up a few pocketbooks on how math
governs everything from the trajectory of
stars in the universe to why nobody likes an
swering the professor's questions in your
classes. For those of you that are techie
minded, I encourage you to employ the
mathematical prowess that you have armed
yourself with and look up from your dia
grams and codes once in a while. Revere the
beautiful mathematical miracles that are oc
curring around you at this very second.

Robbie Yan has had a blast sharing his math
views with you all along. He would like to ex
press special thanks to his editor, Alex
Kendall, who finds himself debating with
Robbie about dynamic programming and
dating frequently. If you'd like to hear more of
Robbie's math rambling, you can reach him
