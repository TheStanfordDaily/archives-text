## CourseWork is overly expensive 
### 
The original grant has expired
from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation used to fund Stan
ford's version of CourseWork, an
Internet computer program that posts
class assignments online. Maintaining the
program in future years could cost as
much as $730,000 per year, a high price
that has left many questioning the impor
tance of this technology on campus.

A number of class
es at Stanford depend
on the CourseWork
system, which many
faculty use to post
class announcements
and links to docu
ments such as syllabi,
to organize section
assignments and to
enter in assignment
grades. Since many
professors have come
to rely on Course-
Work, it would be a
shame to remove this
important tool that
professors can use to
distribute materials
and information re
garding their courses.

An alternative to eliminating Course-
Work would be to pass the costs of the
program on to the individual departments
that use it. But we fear that this approach
would stop many departments from using
CourseWork. Smaller departments or hu
manities departments, which could con
sider such technology a lesser priority,
would be less likely to accommodate the

change. And more importantly, in a time
of strapped budgets across the University,
this is no time to lay an additional expense
on each individual department.
A better solution would be to adopt a
new, cheaper equivalent of the Course-
Work program that would have the same
capabilities, but at a cost less than that of the
Course Work-brand product. Although this
technology may be somewhat complex, the

computer engineer
ing minds at Stan
ford are among the
most qualified in the
world, and this is a
project that could
certainly be accom
plished by comput
er-minded Stanford
community mem
bers. The collabora
tion of Stanford, the
Indiana University
system, the Mas
sachusetts Institute
of Technology and
the University of
Michigan at Ann
Arbor to create
open-source course-

ware tools and related software for higher
education institutions is a step in the right
direction. We hope this $6.8 million effort
will produce a superior product that can be
used in the future.
And for now, the University must pri
oritize the CouseWork concept, while at
the same time not wasting money on a a
name-brand program that may not be as
economically efficient.
