## WELCOME TO WALLACE WORLD Kathryn asks: 'Quien es mas macho?' 
### 
The line between protec
torate and bully has al
ways been fuzzy for the
Bush administration, but
Richard Perle, neo-conservative
adviser to the Pentagon, sped
right past "saber rattling" and
picked a fight in a New York
Times editorial last week.
In an editorial called "The Big
Test for the Contenders," Perle,
currently the chair of the Defense
Policy Board in Washington,
D.C., that counsels Donald
Rumsfeld et al. in foreign policy
matters, and a former assistant to
the Secretary of Defense during
the Reagan administration,
called the whole lot of Democrat
ic presidential hopefuls wussies
for what he considered soft
stances on terrorism. The United
Nations, he pronounces, is no
longer a helpful partner, and in
the age of terrorism, a good de
fense is no longer the best of
fense. Any would-be presidents,
Perle says, must have the courage
to take the fight to the nations
that either shelter or finance ter
rorism organizations.
Perle spends the rest of his 500
words talking up the threat the
Saudi Arabia government poses
to the United States. He ends with
these thoughts: "... Either the
Saudis put an end to the direct
flow of money from the kingdom
to extremist organizations or else
the United States will no longer
have an interest in the continued
tenure of the present regime."
The continued tenure of the
present regime? That has the fa
miliar sound of the Bush bugle
call for a regime change, adding
one more nation to the "Axis of
Evil" lineup.
But ousting the royal family,
possibly the only Saudi Arabians
that still have a soft place for

Americans? This is the same Mid
dle Eastern country known for

both a stable
government and
prosperous
economy that
hosted thou
sands of U.S. mil
itary troops for
10 years and sup
ported some of
the logistics of
our Afghanistan
campaign de-

spite fierce protests from both the
neighbors and Saudi citizens. That
Saudi Arabia?
If you smell a sneaky intelli
gence campaign to convince
Americans of the evil of the Saudi
power structure, it's because this
isn't the first time Perle has played
the vanguard to a controversial
Bush foreign policy. He shopped
the Iraqi invasion around to mea
sure American sentiment even be
fore the terrorist attacks on Amer
ica. After two years of saturating
the media with his talking points,
the war began to feel necessary
and inevitable to many. And a du
bious war that is still searching for
a mandate was started.
There is some truth to Perle's
damaging yip yap. Some of the
Sept. 11,2001 terrorists as well as
Osama Bin Laden are Saudi
born. And intelligence sources in
sist that some strategic A1 Qaeda
funding has been traced back to
the oil-rich nation. It's also true
the Saudi sentiment is decidedly
anti-American. But these aren't
reasons to uproot a government,
considering the our stated mis
sion to the world of peace, and
short of that lofty idealism, the
dismal status of our twin regime
change projects in Afghanistan
and Iraq. We don't have conclu
sive evidence to tie the royal fam

ily to anti-American actions with
any more reliability than WMD
were tied to Saddam Hussein. Is
this the neo-democracy — a sys
tem of government intent on
shaping every government
through force or coercion more
to our liking? Is France, Germany
and England next?
It's this rough riders, "you're
either-with-us-or-with-the-terror-
ists" rhetoric that calls to mind the
word "empire" and spawns anti-
Americanism. It's never been U.S.
policy to democratize the Middle
East. Until now. There are many
frightening qualities to Perle's
treatise in our most visible daily
paper. But most frightening is the
sloppy use of war and the media in
diplomacy.
If this editorial with its implicit
threat is supposed to encourage
better behavior from the Saudis,
it's akin to a woman filing the di
vorce papers before asking her
husband to consider counseling.
When war is the first proposed so
lution, the inevitable escalation is
a dangerous business. And con
trary to Perle's conventional wis
dom, talking war isn't the test of a
brave or wise administration. Any
empty-headed bully can toss a
punch, but smart diplomacy is al
ways preferable to smart bombs.
Bravado and a rightwing hook
can't vanquish all the foes we are
gathering.
Big guns tend to make some
men talk big, but Perle is mistaken
if he believes dialing down the
machismo factor is the same thing
as weakness. No answer from the
Democratic contenders is better
than a wrong answer sure to incite
more trouble.

The line between protec
torate and bully has al
ways been fuzzy for the
Bush administration, but
Richard Perle, neo-conservative
adviser to the Pentagon, sped
right past "saber rattling" and
picked a fight in a New York
Times editorial last week.
In an editorial called "The Big
Test for the Contenders," Perle,
currently the chair of the Defense
Policy Board in Washington,
D.C., that counsels Donald
Rumsfeld et al. in foreign policy
matters, and a former assistant to
the Secretary of Defense during
the Reagan administration,
called the whole lot of Democrat
ic presidential hopefuls wussies
for what he considered soft
stances on terrorism. The United
Nations, he pronounces, is no
longer a helpful partner, and in
the age of terrorism, a good de
fense is no longer the best of
fense. Any would-be presidents,
Perle says, must have the courage
to take the fight to the nations
that either shelter or finance ter
rorism organizations.
Perle spends the rest of his 500
words talking up the threat the
Saudi Arabia government poses
to the United States. He ends with
these thoughts: "... Either the
Saudis put an end to the direct
flow of money from the kingdom
to extremist organizations or else
the United States will no longer
have an interest in the continued
tenure of the present regime."
The continued tenure of the
present regime? That has the fa
miliar sound of the Bush bugle
call for a regime change, adding
one more nation to the "Axis of
Evil" lineup.
But ousting the royal family,
possibly the only Saudi Arabians
that still have a soft place for

Americans? This is the same Mid
dle Eastern country known for

both a stable
government and
prosperous
economy that
