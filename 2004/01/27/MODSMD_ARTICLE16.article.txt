## Job losses call for new Valley story 
### 
Silicon Valley executives
were in Washington a few
weeks back asking for bil
lions in federal spending to
help U.S. tech workers remain
competitive in a global market.
Noble enough rhetoric, but as
quick as they were to ask for tax
payer money, these same execs
defended the accelerating prac
tice of "offshoring" — sending
tech jobs overseas.
While asking for government
assistance to remain competitive
is a time-honored tradition, the
incongruence here is jarring. The
heydays of the late 1990s recede in
the rearview mirror, but an unfor
tunate Silicon Valley myth re
mains fixed in the region's con
sciousness.
Stalwart and bold executives,
venture capitalists and technolo
gists took massive risks where
others feared to tread, reaping re
wards and building the Valley
from ground up. So goes the story.
Theirs was a world of unfettered
capitalism that succeeded, in no
small part, because of its indepen
dence from a stodgy and sclerotic

government.
The execs' comments in Wash
ington contained echoes of this
story. Government should know
its place. Gives us tax breaks for
research and development, spend
more on math and science educa
tion and pay to retrain our dis
placed workers. But leave the in
novation to us; we know what's
best.
A new story is needed, one that
pays appropriate homage to our
region's history. But for signifi
cant government contracts and
grants, the Valley would not exist.
Most technologies, from micro
electronics to semiconductors to
the Internet, were first subsidized
heavily by taxpayers.
And there is a tradition of
spending money to promote na
tional security. Consider that be
tween 1958 and 1974 the govern
ment spent nearly $1 billion in
semiconductor research and de
velopment— almost as much as
all private firms spent together —
mostly to help build advanced
weaponry. In 1965 the military
purchased 70 percent of the na

tion's output of integrated circuits.
Job losses may yet pose a long
term risk to our national security.
In any event, while entrepreneur
ship has built much here, in many
ways those stalwart risk-takers
merely stepped in to reap rewards
after university and corporate re
searchers had used government
money to work the kinks out.
As of November 2003, the Val
ley's unemployment rate was 7.2
percent, just ahead of Alaska, a
state with perennial job woes that
reported 7.3 percent.
Execs are right to raise the
alarm about lost U.S. jobs. But the
nation, of which they are still a
part despite claims of the irrele
vance of national borders in the
new economy, has a right to set
some conditions on how its tax
payers' money will be spent.
The execs should rest relatively
assured. The story once before had
a happy ending and there is no rea
son it won't again. They just have
to remember their roles in it.
