## Forget Freddy, Chad's the real future of soccer 
### 
have so many relationships
in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain
and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so
fast... MMMBop, ba duba dop, ba du bop, ba
duba dop, ba du bop, ba duba dop ba du, Yeah!"
You have heard of Freddy Adu. You know
about the 14-year-old soccer phenom who has
bridged the sports-pop culture gap. You've seen
a teenager who was the No. 1 pick of the MLS
draft, a child who signed a million-dollar en
dorsement contract with Nike, a kid the U.S.
media has proclaimed will save U.S. Soccer.
So you've seen Freddy Adu.
But I've seen the real future of U.S. Soccer,
certainly more so than your man Fred. He is 19
years old, 6-foot-4 and his favorite song is
"MMMBop." You may have seen Freddy Adu,
but I have seen Chad Marshall.

What you may not know
about Chad is a lot. You may
not know that Chad went to
Stanford, leaving this year (his
sophomore year) to go pro.
You may not know that he
was the No. 2 pick in this
year's MLS draft, playing
Carmelo, or perhaps Darko,
to Freddy's LeBron. Mostly
though, you may not know

that he is blatantly better than Freddy. DC
United, with the first pick, had no choice in
picking the crowd favorite, if just to boost atten
dance alone — Freddy is from the DC area. But
match their stats and it's obvious that Adu is
certainly not the best player in this draft class —
Chad leads the U-20 men's team, Adu's team as
well, in starts, games played and International
Games played in 2003. Don't try and tell me
that Freddy Adu is a better player now.
But all this is secondary, unimportant. To un
derstand how good a player Chad Marshall is, is
to understand how "normal" he is off the field.
And by "normal" I mean nothing of the sort.
In fact, when I told his roommate, sopho
more KC Coyne, that I was doing a column
about Chad, all KC wanted to make sure I in
cluded was his cooking and his dancing. Noted
for his love of (note the ease of cooking) grilled
cheese, spaghetti, pancakes and Hanson, KC
noted, "the pancakes were not anything out of
the ordinary, but he insisted upon using Mrs.
Butterworth's. You should talk about 'MMM
bop,' too, 'cause he would always blast that [ex
pletive] during preseason and do his Hanson
dance."
The kid's favorite song is "MMMBop."
Enough said, but of course, he dances to it.
Ridiculously bad dancing — a little head shake
here, a little arm rotation there, all the while
singing along at the very top of his register,
stretching for high notes that he honestly just
does not have, closing his eyes, raising his head
as if crooning to the florescent light fixture
above him.
But damn, the kid is good at kicking a ball.
You see, in college soccer, there are basical
ly two types of players: those who hit, and those
who get hit. And if you fall into that latter cate
gory, you better be quick enough to avoid those
hits. What makes Chad exceptional, however, is
his ability to be the best on the field in both
those categories. At 6-foot-4 and with great
ability in the air, opposing teams would be
forced to double- and triple-team him on set
pieces, literally pulling him down as a matter of
first and last defense. But put the ball on his feet
and he's just plain dirty — he reads the opposi
tion so well that they literally fold to him, falling
over themselves, too confused to make an at
tempt at the ball.
But I'll admit I have an ulterior motive in
writing this column. While Chad started 19 out
of our 20 Varsity games (a leg injury forced him
to sit out one game), I played in one, as a substi
tute, with six minutes and 42 seconds left in the
game. That was my entire playing season on
Varsity. Six minutes and 42 seconds of a 5-1 win.
But honestly, those were six minutes and 42
seconds that I didn't even expect coming into
the season. As the 24th player on a team of 24,1
was ecstatic just to be on the roster, to play in
practice, to live and die with the highs and lows
of a season. Six minutes and 42 seconds or not, I
was on the team.
I have resisted to write about my experiences
with the team for a variety of reasons, none of
which I'll go into detail now. But for Chad I
must make an exception. Why?
Like I said, I have an ulterior motive in writ
ing this column: documentation that 1,20 years
from now, will be able to say that for those six
minutes and 42 seconds of playing time, the only
playing time I got all year, Chad Marshall was
playing right alongside me.
Who knows if he will be the "Future of U.S.
Soccer"? Who knows if he will indeed be the
greatest defender this country ever produces, as
some have wondereci. Who knows if you'll ever
hear of him?
But 20 years from now, Hanson will certain
ly be a footnote in the annals of pop history.
Chad may be something much bigger.

Human Wall" Porter? Shoot him an e-mail at

those categories. At 6-foot-4 and with great
ability in the air, opposing teams would be
forced to double- and triple-team him on set
pieces, literally pulling him down as a matter of
first and last defense. But put the ball on his feet
and he's just plain dirty — he reads the opposi
tion so well that they literally fold to him, falling
over themselves, too confused to make an at
tempt at the ball.
But I'll admit I have an ulterior motive in
writing this column. While Chad started 19 out
of our 20 Varsity games (a leg injury forced him
to sit out one game), I played in one, as a substi
tute, with six minutes and 42 seconds left in the
game. That was my entire playing season on
Varsity. Six minutes and 42 seconds of a 5-1 win.
But honestly, those were six minutes and 42
seconds that I didn't even expect coming into
the season. As the 24th player on a team of 24,1
was ecstatic just to be on the roster, to play in
practice, to live and die with the highs and lows
of a season. Six minutes and 42 seconds or not, I
was on the team.
I have resisted to write about my experiences
with the team for a variety of reasons, none of
which I'll go into detail now. But for Chad I
must make an exception. Why?
Like I said, I have an ulterior motive in writ
ing this column: documentation that 1,20 years
from now, will be able to say that for those six
minutes and 42 seconds of playing time, the only
playing time I got all year, Chad Marshall was
playing right alongside me.
Who knows if he will be the "Future of U.S.
Soccer"? Who knows if he will indeed be the
greatest defender this country ever produces, as
some have wondereci. Who knows if you'll ever
hear of him?
But 20 years from now, Hanson will certain
ly be a footnote in the annals of pop history.
Chad may be something much bigger.

have so many relationships
in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain
and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so
fast... MMMBop, ba duba dop, ba du bop, ba
duba dop, ba du bop, ba duba dop ba du, Yeah!"
You have heard of Freddy Adu. You know
about the 14-year-old soccer phenom who has
bridged the sports-pop culture gap. You've seen
a teenager who was the No. 1 pick of the MLS
draft, a child who signed a million-dollar en
dorsement contract with Nike, a kid the U.S.
media has proclaimed will save U.S. Soccer.
So you've seen Freddy Adu.
But I've seen the real future of U.S. Soccer,
certainly more so than your man Fred. He is 19
years old, 6-foot-4 and his favorite song is
"MMMBop." You may have seen Freddy Adu,
but I have seen Chad Marshall.

What you may not know
about Chad is a lot. You may
not know that Chad went to
Stanford, leaving this year (his
sophomore year) to go pro.
You may not know that he
was the No. 2 pick in this
year's MLS draft, playing
Carmelo, or perhaps Darko,
to Freddy's LeBron. Mostly
though, you may not know

that he is blatantly better than Freddy. DC
United, with the first pick, had no choice in
picking the crowd favorite, if just to boost atten
dance alone — Freddy is from the DC area. But
match their stats and it's obvious that Adu is
certainly not the best player in this draft class —
Chad leads the U-20 men's team, Adu's team as
well, in starts, games played and International
Games played in 2003. Don't try and tell me
that Freddy Adu is a better player now.
But all this is secondary, unimportant. To un
derstand how good a player Chad Marshall is, is
to understand how "normal" he is off the field.
And by "normal" I mean nothing of the sort.
In fact, when I told his roommate, sopho
more KC Coyne, that I was doing a column
about Chad, all KC wanted to make sure I in
cluded was his cooking and his dancing. Noted
for his love of (note the ease of cooking) grilled
cheese, spaghetti, pancakes and Hanson, KC
noted, "the pancakes were not anything out of
the ordinary, but he insisted upon using Mrs.
Butterworth's. You should talk about 'MMM
bop,' too, 'cause he would always blast that [ex
pletive] during preseason and do his Hanson
dance."
The kid's favorite song is "MMMBop."
Enough said, but of course, he dances to it.
Ridiculously bad dancing — a little head shake
here, a little arm rotation there, all the while
singing along at the very top of his register,
stretching for high notes that he honestly just
does not have, closing his eyes, raising his head
as if crooning to the florescent light fixture
above him.
But damn, the kid is good at kicking a ball.
You see, in college soccer, there are basical
ly two types of players: those who hit, and those
who get hit. And if you fall into that latter cate
gory, you better be quick enough to avoid those
hits. What makes Chad exceptional, however, is
his ability to be the best on the field in both
those categories. At 6-foot-4 and with great
ability in the air, opposing teams would be
forced to double- and triple-team him on set
