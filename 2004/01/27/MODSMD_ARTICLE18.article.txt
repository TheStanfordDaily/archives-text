# Gibbs' life takes a new turn
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Former Stanford linebacker Coy Gibbs always dreamed
of making the NFL. As the youngest son of Hall of Fame
head coach Joe Gibbs, who won three Super Bowls with the
Redskins in 12 seasons from 1981-1992, football was just
about all the Fayetteville, Ark. native ever knew.
Today, Gibbs is finally realizing that dream, not as a
player, but as a coach. His 10-year path to the NFL since
leaving the Farm has been redundantly elliptical.
After leading the Cardinal in tackles as a senior in 1994,
and with no chance of playing at the next level, Gibbs left
school early to pursue a career in auto racing, initially work
ing as a lower assembly specialist for his father's race team.
After nine grueling years of long hours, road trips and
racing everything from trucks to Fate model stock cars,
Gibbs spent the past year as a rookie driver in the
NASCAR Busch Series, the circuit just below the sport's
highest level, the Nextel (formerly Winston) Cup.
Despite a couple of promising top-10 finishes, Gibbs fin
ished the season toward the bottom of the points standings,
which prompted the 31-year-old to decide it was time for
another life change.
"I sat back and said, 'Hey, I want to go coach,' " Gibbs
recalled in an interview with The Daily earlier this month.
Coy consulted friends and his father after that initial
inkling two months ago, but it was a conversation he had
with his dad two weeks later that shocked him and, soon
after, the entire NFL community.
"We sat down in the living room and I figured he was
going to try to talk me out of coaching again," Gibbs said.
"He said, 'You know what, I've been a little restless myself.
I think I want to get back in.' I told him I didn't expect him
to do that and he said, 'Listen, I'm not doing it for you.' "
"My first concern was he was going to tick mom off,"
Gibbs said with a laugh. "But I said, 'If you go coaching, I'm
going with you. If you don't, help me get a job!' "
On Jan. 8, with his wife Pat's go-ahead, Joe Gibbs an
nounced he was returning as head coach of the Redskins,
just more than one week after Steve Spurrier resigned. Coy
was named one of two quality control assistants on his staff.
According to Gibbs, the responsibilities of the entry
level coaching position include everything from breaking
down film and prepping game plans to getting drinks, but
most of all it provides great learning experience at the high
est level.
"I'm thinking in five years I'll learn what it would take
10 years to learn somewhere else," Gibbs said. "I'm ecstat
ic to be coaching, I feel at home, this is where I grew up. I'm
ecstatic to be a Redskin again."
Happily married and the father of 15-month-old Ty,
Gibbs is thrilled to be beginning a new chapter in his life.
Playing football, however, not cars or coaching, was his first
passion.
Before his junior year of high school, he transferred to
DeMatha in Hyattsville, Md., a Catholic school that was
quickly establishing a reputation as one of the premiere
high school football programs in the nation under head
coach Bill McGregor.
McGregor, who guided the Stags to their 13th league
title in 22 seasons last year, remembered Coy's two years at
DeMatha.
"He was either in the weight room or in the cafeteria
studying with a Big Gulp," McGregor said.
Coy had every intention of pursuing a career in football,
following in the footsteps of his revered father and older
brother J.D., who was a starting defensive back at William
& Mary at the time.
By the time Coy was a senior at DeMatha, however, the
odds of him playing football at the Division I level appeared
— like his build for a linebacker — small. College scouts
were regulars at DeMatha games, but they weren't there to

see Coy.
"Even our free safety was bigger than I was," said Gibbs,
who weighed about 220 pounds his senior year. "You know
you're not high on the priority list when you're getting like
10 letters and the guy beside you has to get a box to carry his
out."
A self-proclaimed East Coast guy and pessimist, Gibbs
began narrowing his future plans to less prominent foot
ball schools relatively close to home, such as William &
Mary, Colgate and Penn. Then Stanford came knocking.
Defensive coordinator Willie Shaw and head coach
Dennis Green made the trip to DeMatha and were im
pressed by what they saw on film and on the field in
Gibbs.
"He was an undersized linebacker but what Willie and
Dennis said they liked about him was that he played with
bent knees," McGregor said. "It's something I tell my
kids now because it gave him great leverage. Even though
he was only about 200 pounds, he played like he was 230
or 240."
Gibbs was as surprised as anyone when Stanford flew
him out for a visit.
"They actually offered me a scholarship and said, 'We
want you to take trips to other places before you decide,'
" Gibbs recalled. "I said, 'I've got nowhere else to go!' "
Gibbs settled on Stanford, where, following a solid
freshman season during which he received Pac-10 Player
of the Week honors, Gibbs suffered a setback when he
tore a ligament in his knee in practice the following
spring. In retrospect, Gibbs said he probably returned to
the field too soon and should've redshirted the next sea
son, but guided by the notion that football was his life, he
opted to play through the pain.
"When you're young, • you've got your priorities
screwed up," Gibbs lamented. "The only thing that got
me down was football. When I tore my knee up, it was al
most like it was my fault. You feel like you've let the team
down, you feel like you've let the coaches down."

Gibbs limped through his second year at Stanford, a
season in which the Cardinal claimed a share of the Pac
10 title, finished 10-3 and defeated Penn State in the
Blockbuster Bowl.
Between Coy's sophomore and junior season, Joe
Gibbs retired as head coach of the Redskins after a 9-7
season, citing a desire to spend more time with his family
as one of the main factors in his decision. While Coy
maintains he was never homesick, just upset about foot
ball, his father's retirement from coaching paved the way
for the growth of their father-son bond.
"What people don't realize is those were 18-hour
days," Gibbs said. "I didn't really get to know my dad
until after he retired. I realize how blessed we were, and
how blessed my family was and I wouldn't trade that ex
perience for the world, but it's a hard business."
Back on the Farm, coming off a difficult junior season
plagued by pain and a tough time adjusting to a switch to
the strong side, Coy poured all his energy into fdotball his
senior year.
"I didn't even go to classes my last quarter there be
cause I wanted to watch film," Gibbs said. "I played
games,-watched film and ate lunch ... played it like I was
in pro ball."
It was that type of dedication that McGregor remem
bers about Coy.
"Last week I was asked to speak at a banquet and in my
speech I talked about being the best that you can be," Mc-
Gregor said. "I actually used Coy as an example of
someone who got the maximum potential out of him
self."
Whereas bad knees and his diminutive size attribut
ed to the end of his football-playing days, Gibbs cited
his age as the reason he said goodbye to racing.
"I started way too late," Gibbs concedes. "I'm prob
ably not going to make it to the next level, I had to justi-

fy that to myself and I couldn't. I'm
done. I'll never be in a car again. I
promised my wife that."
His playing and racing days be
hind him, Gibbs has no regrets.
"I'm blessed to have been able to
do both," Gibbs said. "My first dream
was to play pro ball. My second one
was to be a Winston Cup driver. I
failed at both of them, but I still had a
pretty exciting time doing it."
Serving on the coaching staff of
the team he followed as a kid and
with his dad as his boss should prove
pretty exciting, too.
