## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Every year, Major League Soccer claims
the best of the country's collegiate stars, and in
the 2004 MLS Superdraft earlier this month,
the league snatched two of Stanford's own:
sophomore Chad Marshall and senior Mike
Wilson.
Marshall was selected second overall by the
Columbus Crew, behind only 14-year-old phe
nom Freddy Adu, who was chosen by the DC
United.
In his two seasons with the Cardinal, Mar
shall proved himself a formidable defender
and was key in the Cardinal's 2002 College
Cup drive. He garnered countless honors, in
cluding being named a semi-finalist for the
prestigious MAC Hermann Trophy.
Marshall has already stopped out of school
to compete for the U.S. Olympic squad — he
is currently playing in Mexico — and will
forgo his final two years at Stanford in order to
join the Crew upon his return.
The Crew, which recently acquired another
product of the Stanford soccer program,
Simon Elliot ('98), has high hopes for Mar
shall's transition to the professional arena.
"Chad Marshall is clearly an outstanding
player who has excelled in college and on the
world stage," Columbus head coach Greg An
drulis said after the draft. "He is a very valu
able addition, not only short term, but can
have a long-term effect on this team and orga
nization."
Wilson was chosen in the third round of the
Superdraft (27th pick overall) by the MLS de
fending champion San Jose Earthquakes. The
midfielder joins Cardinal alumni Roger
Levesque ('03) and Todd Dunivant ('03), as
well as two other new Bay Area recruits from
