# Stanford scientist develops satellite to study Amazon

### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A new technique created by a
Stanford scientist to study the de
pletion of the Amazon rainforest
could help fight against illegal log
ging.
Faculty scientist Greg Asner and
a multinational team are studying
the biophysical and biochemical
changes in the forest canopy. The
team has gained international
recognition for its work.
Asner, who is affiliated with the
Carnegie Institution at Stanford,
and his team are using a satellite to
observe the deforestation process.
"We developed the first approach
to detecting the widespread effects of
'forest thinning' for timber extrac
tion," Asner said. "Until now, this
has been virtually invisible to satel
lites. This is indeed a major break
through, and we are, for the first
time, applying the methods to the en
tire 5.5 million square kilometer
Amazon."
The information obtained via
satellite is then shared with environ
mental protection agencies to help
better target illegal loggers.
The rapidly shrinking Amazon
Basin is the world's largest rainfor
est and home to almost one third of
the world's species and an undeter
mined number of unknown species.
The Amazon is also integral in pro
viding oxygen and removing carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere.
Scientists are alarmed that a total
of 30,000 square kilometers of trop
ical forests are depleted in the Ama

zon each year.
"This effectively means that
twice as much of the Amazon is
being impacted by humans than pre
viously thought," Asner said.
Around 15,000 square kilome
ters per year — an area the size of
Massachusetts — are lost to clear
cutting and cattle pasturing alone.
According to the World Resources
Institute, more than 80 percent of
the Earth's natural forests have al
ready been destroyed.
The main agents of deforestation
include farmers, loggers and infra
structure developers. In the Ama
zon, one of the biggest threats is the
rampant logging by small operators
who often cut patches of trees — a
process called selective logging —
without first obtaining permits from
the country's environmental protec
tion agency.
"Somewhere between 80 percent
to 95 percent of the selective logging
is done illegally in certain parts of
the Brazilian Amazon," Asner said.
Because trees are often inter
twined or connected by vines, selec
tive logging damages a larger radius
of trees than those directly cut.
"Selective logging acts like a net
— when you take down one tree,
you end up taking five to 20 other
trees around it," Asner told The
Stanford Report.
Asner's research team includes a
Brazilian nongovernmental organi
zation, Brazil's environmental pro
tection agency, NASA and the U.S.
Forest Service. The team has spent
five years developing its remote
sensing system that measures timber
harvests and deforestation.
The study aims to estimate the
impact of selective logging on bio
geochemical processes in the Ama
zon and to determine the long-term
effects of timber harvesting on eco
logical functioning of tropical trees.
"We hope to understand the ef
fects of selective logging on the car
bon and fire dynamics of the Ama
zon," Asner said. "We also hope to
aid in efforts by our colleagues to im
prove harvesting practices, to make
them more sustainable."
Stanford students generally share

the widely held view that the re
maining rainforests in the world
should be protected.
"These rainforests are irreplace
able," said freshman Jay Huang.
"They're natural wonders of the
world, and we shouldn't destroy
them."
However, senior Ricky Wang
pointed out that the subject of defor
estation is not as clear-cut as it
seems.
"A lot of eco-groups are allied
with indigenous groups," he said.
"What they're finding now is that a
lot of the indigenous groups want
the land to cut down the trees for
their own uses. The question is not if
the rainforest is being exploited, but
who's benefiting from the exploita
tion."
