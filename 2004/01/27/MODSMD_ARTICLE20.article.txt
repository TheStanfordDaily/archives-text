# Men's tennis set to take on Hawaii
## 
### KAIYA REEVE 
Coming off a satisfying 6-1 victory over Tulsa on Satur
day in their first dual match of the season, the No. 5 Stan
ford men's tennis team is looking to continue its perfect
start to the spring season against unranked Hawaii today.
The match will be Stanford's first at home this season
and will begin at 1:30 p.m. The two teams met in Novem
ber, as the Cardinal overpowered the Rainbow Warriors 5-
2.
"Hawaii is a team that is building with a new coach,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould said. "I think coming off
this trip [in Tulsa], we have to stay focused on the match.
We can't rest on the last match."
Hawaii is looking to clutch onto their first win of the
season and will come into today's match with a 0-4 record.
Hawaii is 0-18 all-time against the Cardinal.
"No team in college tennis is an easy guaranteed win,
but in comparison to other teams we're going play,
they're not going to be our toughest," said junior Sam
Warburg.
John Nelson is in his first season as the Hawaii head
coach after Jim Schwitters retired after 38 years at the end
of last season.
In addition to the Cardinal's No. 5 ranking in the In
tercollegiate Tennis Association preseason poll, three of
Stanford's players are ranked.
Sophomore All-American KC Corkery is ranked No.
43 in the nation coming off an impressive freshman year
season. The doubles pair of Corkery and fellow sopho
more James Pade (No. 82, individually) is No. 10. The
pair made their mark on the collegiate tennis world last
year after climbing from non-ranked status to the No. 9
spot.
Warburg posted a 32-4 overall singles record last sea
son and is No. 71 in the preseason ITA rankings. Warburg
was 3-3 in the fall season.
These three players may well be the driving force be
hind the team this year, proved by their status as colle-
