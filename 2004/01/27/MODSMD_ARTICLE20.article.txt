# Men's tennis set to take on Hawaii
## 
### KAIYA REEVE 
Coming off a satisfying 6-1 victory over Tulsa on Satur
day in their first dual match of the season, the No. 5 Stan
ford men's tennis team is looking to continue its perfect
start to the spring season against unranked Hawaii today.
The match will be Stanford's first at home this season
and will begin at 1:30 p.m. The two teams met in Novem
ber, as the Cardinal overpowered the Rainbow Warriors 5-
2.
"Hawaii is a team that is building with a new coach,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould said. "I think coming off
this trip [in Tulsa], we have to stay focused on the match.
We can't rest on the last match."
Hawaii is looking to clutch onto their first win of the
season and will come into today's match with a 0-4 record.
Hawaii is 0-18 all-time against the Cardinal.
"No team in college tennis is an easy guaranteed win,
but in comparison to other teams we're going play,
they're not going to be our toughest," said junior Sam
Warburg.
John Nelson is in his first season as the Hawaii head
coach after Jim Schwitters retired after 38 years at the end
of last season.
In addition to the Cardinal's No. 5 ranking in the In
tercollegiate Tennis Association preseason poll, three of
Stanford's players are ranked.
Sophomore All-American KC Corkery is ranked No.
43 in the nation coming off an impressive freshman year
season. The doubles pair of Corkery and fellow sopho
more James Pade (No. 82, individually) is No. 10. The
pair made their mark on the collegiate tennis world last
year after climbing from non-ranked status to the No. 9
spot.
Warburg posted a 32-4 overall singles record last sea
son and is No. 71 in the preseason ITA rankings. Warburg
was 3-3 in the fall season.
These three players may well be the driving force be
hind the team this year, proved by their status as colle-
giate tennis elites and their collection
of awards and commendations.
"The leadership of the upper
classmen and the continued develop
ment of Pade and Corkery are our
strengths," said Stanford associate
head coach John Whitlinger.
Stanford's 6-1 season-opening
victory at Tulsa boosted team spirits.

"It was an awesome match, the
place was extremely packed," War
burg said. "We played really well. It's
always nice to go onto someone's
home court and silence the crowd."
"The match in Tulsa was a good,
strong start to our dual-meet sea
son," Gould said. "It was a very loud
crowd. Their doubles teams were
very, very good and we battled for
our fives in doubles and fortunately
were able to pull out the top two.
They were very well coached."
The victory also helped Stanford
rebound from a slightly disappoint

ing showing last weekend at the Sher
wood Cup Invitational.
"I thought the guys did a much
better job of getting into the points
and playing within themselves as
they hit the balls," Gould said. "We
did a much better job playing
smarter, setting up our abilities bet
ter and setting up our strengths. We
were also very impressive in the sin
gles matches."
The Cardinal will be back in ac
tion Feb. 5 to 8 at the National Team
Indoor Championships in Seattle,
Wash.
