# Volleyball loses two on road
## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team suffered simi
larly disappointing road losses last weekend, the ex
ception being in the opponents' vastly different reputa
tions. The Cardinal (4-4, 2-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) lost to Long Beach State on Friday night
and then to UC-San Diego on Saturday. Both matches
went to four games with the Cardinal coming out slug
gish in the first and then winning the second game. The
difference? Long Beach State is No. 2 and San Diego is
Division II.
Stanford came into the Pyramid looking to avenge a
five-game loss to the 49ers they suffered in a tournament
at UC-Santa Barbara earlier this season. But the 49ers'
Jeff Wooten, who posted six kills in game one, helped
Long Beach maintain an early lead en route to a 30-22
win.
"We didn't do a very good job defensively in the first
game," Stanford head coach Don Shaw said. "Then we
picked up the pace a little bit and served tougher. We did
a better job after that."
A much better job.
In fact, led by junior outside hitter David Vogel's six
kills, Stanford took game two, 30-27. According to
Vogel, the outcome boosted the Cardinal's confidence.
"We figured out, 'Hey, we can beat these guys,' " he
said.
But the next two games didn't materialize for Stan
ford. In spite of Vogel's career-high 20 kills and sopho
more middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt's 11-kill effort, the
Cardinal dropped game three 30-27 and game four 30-
28.
"We played well," said junior middle blocker Craig
Buell, who recorded 10 kills in defeat. "But we gave
away games three and four. We were in control and we
let them win."
Buell, Vogel and Shaw all agreed that the last few
points of the match were shadowed by calls that weren't
in the Cardinal's favor.
"We had a couple of calls that didn't go our way at the
end," Shaw said. "It was very close to being a five-game
match and it could have gone either way. I thought we
played fairly well. They're just a very good team."
"It was unfortunate that game four had to go that way
because I think the momentum was turning our way,"

Vogel said.
A surprisingly similar fight unfolded on Saturday
night, when Stanford faced UC-San Diego. Again, the
Cardinal lost in four games and again Stanford fell be
hind early. After Stanford evened the score at 13-13, the
Tritons went on an 8-2 run and the Cardinal never re
covered, losing 30-27.
"They came up on us early," Shaw said after game
one. "We did not play very well. We seemed to gain con
trol in game two and the beginning of game three."
Sophomore outside hitter Ben Reddy notched one of
his career-high 23 kills to claim a 16-13 lead the Cardinal
would maintain throughout game two. The team regis
tered a .441 hitting percentage but it was not enough to
claim the match. The San Diego defense allowed only
one other player, Buell, to post double digits on the at
tack. The middle hitter, who had 12 kills, said blocking
was key to the Triton's success.
"They blocked us off the court," Vogel said.
San Diego posted 17.5 blocks while the Cardinal reg
istered five.
"Really game three was the key to the match," Shaw
said. "We had a chance to put the game away and would
have gone up two games to one."
Instead, the Cardinal fell behind 3-1, losing the fourth
game by eight, 30-22.
"We couldn't recover from losing that game," Shaw
said. "We did not play well in game four."
Vogel said he would try to take the loss in stride.
"Personally, I was really disappointed that it went
that way, but I'm going to try to take it as a learning ex
perience," he said, going on to point out that Stanford
registered an impressive 49 digs as a team.
Shaw also maintained a positive attitude in spite of
the losses.
"UCSD was just the better team that night," Shaw
said. "That's just the way it's going to be in this con
ference. We have to play well in order to have a
chance to win matches. Everyone's good in this con
ference."
The Cardinal will take on UC-Santa Barbara on Fri
day at Maples Pavilion and Cal-State Northridge on Sat
urday in Burnham Pavilion.
"The games this coming weekend are going to be very
competitive," Shaw said. "They're two very good teams.
We're just going to have to try to bounce back and try to
play better than we did Saturday."

let them win."
Buell, Vogel and Shaw all agreed that the last few
points of the match were shadowed by calls that weren't
in the Cardinal's favor.
"We had a couple of calls that didn't go our way at the
end," Shaw said. "It was very close to being a five-game
match and it could have gone either way. I thought we
played fairly well. They're just a very good team."
"It was unfortunate that game four had to go that way
because I think the momentum was turning our way,"

Vogel said.
A surprisingly similar fight unfolded on Saturday
night, when Stanford faced UC-San Diego. Again, the
Cardinal lost in four games and again Stanford fell be
hind early. After Stanford evened the score at 13-13, the
Tritons went on an 8-2 run and the Cardinal never re
covered, losing 30-27.
"They came up on us early," Shaw said after game
one. "We did not play very well. We seemed to gain con
trol in game two and the beginning of game three."
Sophomore outside hitter Ben Reddy notched one of
his career-high 23 kills to claim a 16-13 lead the Cardinal
would maintain throughout game two. The team regis
tered a .441 hitting percentage but it was not enough to
claim the match. The San Diego defense allowed only
one other player, Buell, to post double digits on the at
tack. The middle hitter, who had 12 kills, said blocking
was key to the Triton's success.
"They blocked us off the court," Vogel said.
San Diego posted 17.5 blocks while the Cardinal reg
istered five.
"Really game three was the key to the match," Shaw
said. "We had a chance to put the game away and would
have gone up two games to one."
Instead, the Cardinal fell behind 3-1, losing the fourth
game by eight, 30-22.
"We couldn't recover from losing that game," Shaw
said. "We did not play well in game four."
Vogel said he would try to take the loss in stride.
"Personally, I was really disappointed that it went
that way, but I'm going to try to take it as a learning ex
perience," he said, going on to point out that Stanford
registered an impressive 49 digs as a team.
Shaw also maintained a positive attitude in spite of
the losses.
"UCSD was just the better team that night," Shaw
said. "That's just the way it's going to be in this con
ference. We have to play well in order to have a
chance to win matches. Everyone's good in this con
ference."
The Cardinal will take on UC-Santa Barbara on Fri
day at Maples Pavilion and Cal-State Northridge on Sat
urday in Burnham Pavilion.
"The games this coming weekend are going to be very
competitive," Shaw said. "They're two very good teams.
We're just going to have to try to bounce back and try to
play better than we did Saturday."

Junior outside hitter David Vogel goes for a kill earlier this season. Vogel and
the No. 6 Cardinal suffered 3-1 losses to No. 2 Long Beach State and UC-
San Diego over the weekend.
The Stanford men's volleyball team suffered simi
larly disappointing road losses last weekend, the ex
ception being in the opponents' vastly different reputa
tions. The Cardinal (4-4, 2-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) lost to Long Beach State on Friday night
and then to UC-San Diego on Saturday. Both matches
went to four games with the Cardinal coming out slug
gish in the first and then winning the second game. The
difference? Long Beach State is No. 2 and San Diego is
Division II.
Stanford came into the Pyramid looking to avenge a
five-game loss to the 49ers they suffered in a tournament
at UC-Santa Barbara earlier this season. But the 49ers'
Jeff Wooten, who posted six kills in game one, helped
Long Beach maintain an early lead en route to a 30-22
win.
"We didn't do a very good job defensively in the first
game," Stanford head coach Don Shaw said. "Then we
picked up the pace a little bit and served tougher. We did
a better job after that."
A much better job.
In fact, led by junior outside hitter David Vogel's six
kills, Stanford took game two, 30-27. According to
Vogel, the outcome boosted the Cardinal's confidence.
"We figured out, 'Hey, we can beat these guys,' " he
said.
But the next two games didn't materialize for Stan
ford. In spite of Vogel's career-high 20 kills and sopho
more middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt's 11-kill effort, the
Cardinal dropped game three 30-27 and game four 30-
28.
"We played well," said junior middle blocker Craig
Buell, who recorded 10 kills in defeat. "But we gave
away games three and four. We were in control and we
let them win."
Buell, Vogel and Shaw all agreed that the last few
points of the match were shadowed by calls that weren't
in the Cardinal's favor.
"We had a couple of calls that didn't go our way at the
