Extra chairs had to be set up yesterday afternoon in Enci
na Hall as members of the Stanford community came to hear
noted panelists address the question, "What are we doing in
Iraq?"
The event, sponsored by the Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies, consisted of four panelists addressing a va
riety of issues on Iraq, ranging from its economic future to the
immediate road map for a transitional government.
The panel was moderated by Coit Blacker, the institute's
director, who served as special assistant for national security
affairs under the Clinton administration. Other panelists in
cluded International Relations Prof. Stephen Krasner, the in

Iraq, emphasizing the importance of the Grand Ayatollah Ali
al-Husseini al-Sistani, a key Shi'ite leader. Sistani refuses to
talk with the United States, but Emmerson remains hopeful
that Sistani would not implement a society strictly governed
by clerics. Though a completely secular state is highly unlike
ly, Emmerson advocates an Islamic "cape," or a culturally Is
lamic government, as opposed to an Islamic state.
"We shouldn't oppose political Islam, or else this will only
drive people to violence," Emmerson said.
Emmerson also highlighted the importance of scaling our
expectations and maintaining a relativistic frame of mind, as
opposed to the idealistic views he said were portrayed by
President George W. Bush's most recent State of the Union
address, which called for the spread of freedom and democ-
