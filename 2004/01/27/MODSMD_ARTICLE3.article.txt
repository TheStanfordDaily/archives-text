# Profs discuss Iraq

### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Extra chairs had to be set up yesterday afternoon in Enci
na Hall as members of the Stanford community came to hear
noted panelists address the question, "What are we doing in
Iraq?"
The event, sponsored by the Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies, consisted of four panelists addressing a va
riety of issues on Iraq, ranging from its economic future to the
immediate road map for a transitional government.
The panel was moderated by Coit Blacker, the institute's
director, who served as special assistant for national security
affairs under the Clinton administration. Other panelists in
cluded International Relations Prof. Stephen Krasner, the in
stitute's deputy director, as well as SIIS Senior Fellow Don
ald Emmerson, Hoover Senior Fellow Michael McFaul and
Economics Prof. John McMillan.
The four panelists offered varying perspectives on both
the current situation in Iraq and their predictions for its fu
ture, though all admitted that they could not claim to be ex
perts on the situation.
McFaul opened by stating that U.S. plans for guiding the
transition are abysmal.

"We have no idea what we're doing," he said. "We're
making it up as we go along."
McFaul summarized the timeline proposed by Bush for
handing over sovereignty to the Iraqi people, commenting
that the June 30 deadline for granting sovereignty was unrea
sonable and perhaps influenced by the upcoming presidential
elections.
Emmerson spoke about the religious aspects of a future
Iraq, emphasizing the importance of the Grand Ayatollah Ali
al-Husseini al-Sistani, a key Shi'ite leader. Sistani refuses to
talk with the United States, but Emmerson remains hopeful
that Sistani would not implement a society strictly governed
by clerics. Though a completely secular state is highly unlike
ly, Emmerson advocates an Islamic "cape," or a culturally Is
lamic government, as opposed to an Islamic state.
"We shouldn't oppose political Islam, or else this will only
drive people to violence," Emmerson said.
Emmerson also highlighted the importance of scaling our
expectations and maintaining a relativistic frame of mind, as
opposed to the idealistic views he said were portrayed by
President George W. Bush's most recent State of the Union
address, which called for the spread of freedom and democ-
racy throughout the world.
McMillan echoed Emmerson by
saying that uncertainty, especially
economic uncertainty, was a fact,
and that mistakes often arise from
hubris.
McMillan presented figures that
showed the economic disintegration
of Iraq and a command economy
that he likened to the former Soviet
Union. He also questioned why the
"detailed economic road map" pro
posed by the Bush administration
has been kept secret, though one
known aspect of it is the goal to build
a stock market in one year. As a pos
sible aid to the current dire econom
ic situation, McMillan advocated the
fostering of entrepreneurship.
"Let the private sector grow or
ganically," McMillan advised.

Krasner, the last speaker on the
panel, stated that the administration
had admirable goals, but just didn't
know how to get there. He proposed
that the correct analog for Iraq was
not Germany or Japan, but instead
Korea, which developed and grew
economically with much foreign as
sistance and the presence of outside
forces.
Krasner offered three suggestions
for improving the current situation in
Iraq.
First, he suggested delaying direct
elections in Iraq. He then stated the
need to legitimize a government in
Iraq and obtain internal acceptance.
Krasner also proposed taking oil out
of the hands of the government,
where it has significant power to cor
rupt, and instead forming an Iraqi oil
trust monitored by Iraqis and inter
national forces. The collected rev
enue would then be controlled and
spent by an Iraqi legislature.
All panelists agreed that the key
to building a stable, democratic Iraqi

government and economy lies in de
pendable government institutions.
"Without institutions, a few will
get incredibly rich while the majority
do not benefit or are harmed,"
McMillan said.
The panelists also agreed on the
fact that the transition in Iraq will by
no means be quick and clean, due to
the fact that, at present, the relation
ship between the transitional gov
ernment and U.S. forces is highly ill
defined.
"Iraq can be an electoral democ
racy, but that will take staying power
on our side," McFaul said.
After each panelist presented for
10 minutes, the panelists had the op
portunity to reply to each other. The
audience was then given time to in
teract with the panel and ask ques
tions.
"The aim and the goal of the
event are to educate and inform,
using leading SIIS scholars, who will
discuss various elements of the situa
tion in Iraq," said Klas Bergman, as
sociate director for communications
at the institute. "I can't think of an in
ternational issue that's more impor
tant for everyone to discuss. Stan
ford University and SIIS want to
have a faculty and a student body

that participate in the debate about
today's major international issues."
However, few Stanford students
were in the crowd that consisted
mostly of faculty and other members
of the Stanford community.
"I think the situation in Iraq is an
important matter to discuss, and I
enjoyed hearing different perspec
tives, but I also find it unfortunate
that there weren't that many stu
dents in attendance," said freshman
Pete Duncan. "I think they should
better publicize these events. It
seemed like a lot of people from out
side Stanford knew about it, but not
many undergraduates."
Whether Stanford students didn't
attend because they didn't know
about it or because of apathy,
Bergman emphasized the signifi
cance of Iraq to the United States
and its interactions with the rest of
the world.
"Iraq is at the center of U.S. for
eign policy and the major interna
tional issue today," he said. "It is
today's most important foreign poli
cy issue, and the future of Iraq will
likely determine U.S. foreign policy
and U.S. relations with Europe and
the rest of the world for a long time
to come."

ture, though all admitted that they could not claim to be ex
perts on the situation.
McFaul opened by stating that U.S. plans for guiding the
transition are abysmal.

"We have no idea what we're doing," he said. "We're
making it up as we go along."
McFaul summarized the timeline proposed by Bush for
handing over sovereignty to the Iraqi people, commenting
that the June 30 deadline for granting sovereignty was unrea
sonable and perhaps influenced by the upcoming presidential
elections.
Emmerson spoke about the religious aspects of a future
Iraq, emphasizing the importance of the Grand Ayatollah Ali
al-Husseini al-Sistani, a key Shi'ite leader. Sistani refuses to
talk with the United States, but Emmerson remains hopeful
that Sistani would not implement a society strictly governed
by clerics. Though a completely secular state is highly unlike
ly, Emmerson advocates an Islamic "cape," or a culturally Is
lamic government, as opposed to an Islamic state.
"We shouldn't oppose political Islam, or else this will only
drive people to violence," Emmerson said.
Emmerson also highlighted the importance of scaling our
expectations and maintaining a relativistic frame of mind, as
opposed to the idealistic views he said were portrayed by
President George W. Bush's most recent State of the Union
address, which called for the spread of freedom and democ-
racy throughout the world.
McMillan echoed Emmerson by
saying that uncertainty, especially
economic uncertainty, was a fact,
and that mistakes often arise from
hubris.
McMillan presented figures that
showed the economic disintegration
of Iraq and a command economy
that he likened to the former Soviet
Union. He also questioned why the
"detailed economic road map" pro
posed by the Bush administration
has been kept secret, though one
known aspect of it is the goal to build
a stock market in one year. As a pos
sible aid to the current dire econom
ic situation, McMillan advocated the
fostering of entrepreneurship.
"Let the private sector grow or
ganically," McMillan advised.

Krasner, the last speaker on the
panel, stated that the administration
had admirable goals, but just didn't
know how to get there. He proposed
that the correct analog for Iraq was
not Germany or Japan, but instead
Korea, which developed and grew
economically with much foreign as
sistance and the presence of outside
forces.
Krasner offered three suggestions
for improving the current situation in
Iraq.
First, he suggested delaying direct
elections in Iraq. He then stated the
need to legitimize a government in
Iraq and obtain internal acceptance.
Krasner also proposed taking oil out
of the hands of the government,
where it has significant power to cor
rupt, and instead forming an Iraqi oil
trust monitored by Iraqis and inter
national forces. The collected rev
enue would then be controlled and
spent by an Iraqi legislature.
All panelists agreed that the key
to building a stable, democratic Iraqi

government and economy lies in de
pendable government institutions.
"Without institutions, a few will
get incredibly rich while the majority
do not benefit or are harmed,"
McMillan said.
The panelists also agreed on the
fact that the transition in Iraq will by
no means be quick and clean, due to
the fact that, at present, the relation
ship between the transitional gov
ernment and U.S. forces is highly ill
defined.
"Iraq can be an electoral democ
racy, but that will take staying power
on our side," McFaul said.
After each panelist presented for
10 minutes, the panelists had the op
portunity to reply to each other. The
audience was then given time to in
teract with the panel and ask ques
tions.
"The aim and the goal of the
event are to educate and inform,
using leading SIIS scholars, who will
discuss various elements of the situa
tion in Iraq," said Klas Bergman, as
sociate director for communications
at the institute. "I can't think of an in
ternational issue that's more impor
tant for everyone to discuss. Stan
ford University and SIIS want to
have a faculty and a student body

that participate in the debate about
today's major international issues."
However, few Stanford students
were in the crowd that consisted
mostly of faculty and other members
of the Stanford community.
"I think the situation in Iraq is an
important matter to discuss, and I
enjoyed hearing different perspec
tives, but I also find it unfortunate
that there weren't that many stu
dents in attendance," said freshman
Pete Duncan. "I think they should
better publicize these events. It
seemed like a lot of people from out
side Stanford knew about it, but not
many undergraduates."
Whether Stanford students didn't
attend because they didn't know
about it or because of apathy,
Bergman emphasized the signifi
cance of Iraq to the United States
and its interactions with the rest of
the world.
"Iraq is at the center of U.S. for
eign policy and the major interna
tional issue today," he said. "It is
today's most important foreign poli
cy issue, and the future of Iraq will
likely determine U.S. foreign policy
and U.S. relations with Europe and
the rest of the world for a long time
to come."

A panel of four noted Stanford academes discussed the current situation in
Iraq and expressed their hopes for its future in an overcrowded room in
Encina Hall yesterday.
Extra chairs had to be set up yesterday afternoon in Enci
na Hall as members of the Stanford community came to hear
noted panelists address the question, "What are we doing in
Iraq?"
The event, sponsored by the Stanford Institute for Inter
national Studies, consisted of four panelists addressing a va
riety of issues on Iraq, ranging from its economic future to the
immediate road map for a transitional government.
The panel was moderated by Coit Blacker, the institute's
director, who served as special assistant for national security
affairs under the Clinton administration. Other panelists in
cluded International Relations Prof. Stephen Krasner, the in
stitute's deputy director, as well as SIIS Senior Fellow Don
ald Emmerson, Hoover Senior Fellow Michael McFaul and
Economics Prof. John McMillan.
The four panelists offered varying perspectives on both
the current situation in Iraq and their predictions for its fu
ture, though all admitted that they could not claim to be ex
perts on the situation.
