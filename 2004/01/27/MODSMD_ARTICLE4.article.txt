# Speakers encourage 'American Dream'

### ALIYYA HAQUE 
Americans should rethink the core values that consti
tute the American dream by engaging in conversation
over these ideals, said San Francisco State Philosophy
Prof. Jacob Needleman and Stanford Dean of Religious
Life Rev. Scotty McLennan last night at Kresge Auditori
um.
The discussion, entitled "The American Soul: Found
ing Ideals and the American Dream," was presented by
the Aurora Forum at Stanford as part of Stanford's Con
tinuing Studies program. Inspired by Needleman's book
"The American Soul," this dialogue — presented as a
conversation between Needleman, McLennan and, later,
the audience — explained the need for "re-mythologizing
the founders, heroes and ideals of America."
At the start of the program, Needleman explained his
reasons for writing a book about the spiritual traditions
and visions that make up the American dream.
"I believe in a common vision of humanity," he said.
"In my book, I've attempted to discover the bridge be
tween the wisdom tradition of America and the practical
world in which we live. I wanted to see what light this com
mon vision could shed on the concrete problems of cul
ture such as religion, time and money."
Needleman discussed what he described as the burn
ing question of today — the meaning of America. He
stressed that Americans' ideals of freedom, indepen
dence, hard work and equality could be deepened when
exposed to the wisdom tradition of founding fathers such
as Washington and Jefferson.
"The founders were seekers of wisdom and wanted to
find the spiritual meaning in government, life and soci
ety," Needleman said. "The need for retelling the Ameri

can story in order to echo its values is needed. We have to
open a deeper meaning of these values."
Later in the conversation, McLennan brought up the
point that the United States, though considered a prag
matic nation, is at its origin based on an idea of virtues and
is also defined by this idea.
Needleman reiterated this concept, saying that the
United States is based on an idea about human nature and
how people live together.
"America did not come out of an idea based on mater
ial goods, power and security," Needleman said. "These
are all means to an end. Rather, there is a deeper meaning
behind this idea that I can describe by saying one is not
born an American. One becomes an American after one
understands the values that this country was founded on."
McLennan asked about the ideas and dreams that hold
America together.
"If it's because of some dream that this country is still
together, then what is this dream?" McLennan asked. "Is
it just to better ourselves financially, or is there some
deeper meaning?"
Needleman answered that the American dream for
most people involves a financial success, security and
higher status for themselves.
"Still, there is a vision underneath ail this," he said.
"Happiness does not just involve financial security, but a
way with connecting with virtues and goodness. In the
words of Jefferson, democracy depends on citizens think
ing together about democracy."
Needleman also commented on the need to review the
values of the founding fathers and to "re-mythologize"
these heroes based on their ideals.
"People often criticize Jefferson for being a slave-hold-
er," Needleman said. "But Jeffer
son understood the problem of
slavery because he was in the thick
of the problem and knew that slav
ery was wrong. This does not mean
that we should discount all that
Jefferson stood for."
Needleman concluded by an
swering his original question on
the true meaning of America.
"America is based on a form of
government that was designed in
tentionally to protect the search
for conscience," he said. "America
protects the freedom of people to
come together and search for
truth. And this dialogue between
Americans must continue for the
country to remain stable and not
dissolve."
After their initial conversation,
both Needleman and McLennan
fielded questions and engaged in
discussion with the audience. One
audience member stressed the
duty as an American citizen to use
freedom of speech when dissent
ing against the government.
"American citizens have both
rights and duties," Needleman re
sponded. "Free speech is a right
that implies allowing other people
to speak and also listening to what
they have to say. In this way, we
engage in real conversation with
each other and can understand
and penetrate the real problems of
America."

over these ideals, said San Francisco State Philosophy
Prof. Jacob Needleman and Stanford Dean of Religious
Life Rev. Scotty McLennan last night at Kresge Auditori
um.
The discussion, entitled "The American Soul: Found
ing Ideals and the American Dream," was presented by
the Aurora Forum at Stanford as part of Stanford's Con
tinuing Studies program. Inspired by Needleman's book
"The American Soul," this dialogue — presented as a
conversation between Needleman, McLennan and, later,
the audience — explained the need for "re-mythologizing
the founders, heroes and ideals of America."
At the start of the program, Needleman explained his
reasons for writing a book about the spiritual traditions
and visions that make up the American dream.
"I believe in a common vision of humanity," he said.
"In my book, I've attempted to discover the bridge be
tween the wisdom tradition of America and the practical
world in which we live. I wanted to see what light this com
mon vision could shed on the concrete problems of cul
ture such as religion, time and money."
Needleman discussed what he described as the burn
ing question of today — the meaning of America. He
stressed that Americans' ideals of freedom, indepen
dence, hard work and equality could be deepened when
exposed to the wisdom tradition of founding fathers such
as Washington and Jefferson.
"The founders were seekers of wisdom and wanted to
find the spiritual meaning in government, life and soci
ety," Needleman said. "The need for retelling the Ameri

can story in order to echo its values is needed. We have to
open a deeper meaning of these values."
Later in the conversation, McLennan brought up the
point that the United States, though considered a prag
matic nation, is at its origin based on an idea of virtues and
is also defined by this idea.
Needleman reiterated this concept, saying that the
United States is based on an idea about human nature and
how people live together.
"America did not come out of an idea based on mater
ial goods, power and security," Needleman said. "These
are all means to an end. Rather, there is a deeper meaning
behind this idea that I can describe by saying one is not
born an American. One becomes an American after one
understands the values that this country was founded on."
McLennan asked about the ideas and dreams that hold
America together.
"If it's because of some dream that this country is still
together, then what is this dream?" McLennan asked. "Is
it just to better ourselves financially, or is there some
deeper meaning?"
Needleman answered that the American dream for
most people involves a financial success, security and
higher status for themselves.
"Still, there is a vision underneath ail this," he said.
"Happiness does not just involve financial security, but a
way with connecting with virtues and goodness. In the
words of Jefferson, democracy depends on citizens think
ing together about democracy."
Needleman also commented on the need to review the
values of the founding fathers and to "re-mythologize"
these heroes based on their ideals.
"People often criticize Jefferson for being a slave-hold-
er," Needleman said. "But Jeffer
son understood the problem of
slavery because he was in the thick
of the problem and knew that slav
ery was wrong. This does not mean
that we should discount all that
Jefferson stood for."
Needleman concluded by an
swering his original question on
the true meaning of America.
"America is based on a form of
government that was designed in
tentionally to protect the search
for conscience," he said. "America
protects the freedom of people to
come together and search for
truth. And this dialogue between
Americans must continue for the
country to remain stable and not
dissolve."
After their initial conversation,
both Needleman and McLennan
fielded questions and engaged in
discussion with the audience. One
audience member stressed the
duty as an American citizen to use
freedom of speech when dissent
ing against the government.
"American citizens have both
rights and duties," Needleman re
sponded. "Free speech is a right
that implies allowing other people
to speak and also listening to what
they have to say. In this way, we
engage in real conversation with
each other and can understand
and penetrate the real problems of
America."
