# Construction on Graduate Community Center begins
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
A handful of graduate students,
University officials and staff joined
two bulldozers and a few dump
trucks yesterday morning to break
ground on the construction of the
Graduate Community Center, near
the Studio 1 apartments on Escondi
do Road.
According to Acting Dean of
Students Chris Griffith, she and sev
eral administrators and Graduate
Student Council members attended
the brief event shortly after 8 a.m. to
witness the beginning of construc
tion.
"It all looked very efficient and
professional," said Lisa Marin, a
graduate student in biological sci
ences, after watching a steam shovel
rip apart the first pieces of asphalt.
The attendees included Joan
Karlin of the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs, and
Mark Bonino, who recently re
placed Susan Rozarkis as project
manager.
Council Chair Steve Allison,
Deputy Chair Gayle Christensen and
former Chair Marin also attended.
After the morning's gathering,
Allison said that "students are very
enthusiastic about the Graduate
Community Center as construction
gets under way."
While there was no formal cere
mony planned, Griffith brought
bagels and juice for an impromptu
celebration.
"Many of the folks who were
there have been very involved in the
planning, so the moment did not pass
without celebration," Griffith said.

Originally scheduled to com
mence in November, the center's
construction was delayed while pro
ject managers awaited the final
building permit from Santa Clara
County.
Stanford received the permit on
Friday, finalizing plans for a hub of
graduate student life that was first
envisioned five years ago. The Cen
ter will provide graduate students

living both on- and off-campus with
meeting space, administrative of
fices and a pub-style restaurant.
The delay gave the council and
others on the planning committee
extra time to perfect the existing
plans for the center.
"The delay has been positive be
cause we've had additional time to
plan the details of the building inte
rior," Allison said.

He explained that the council
was able to tailor its plans for the
pub and food service areas to meet
health codes and to organize
telecommunications infrastructure
for wireless Internet access. Only
the center's lighting and furniture
remain to be determined in the final
