## PSU profs chime in on virus writing class 
### HOLLY ROSENE DAILY COLLEGIAN 
(U-WIRE) UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. —
Uproar about a 'virus-writing' class at the Univer
sity of Calgary, Canada has caused speculation re
garding its educational value in the computer sci
ence and engineering department at Pennsylvania
State University.
. Some professors have different views on
whether offering a course that includes instruc
tion on how to write virus codes could be benefi
cial to computer security.
"The University of Calgary had the right to do
so in interest of academic freedom," John Domi
co, assistant director of information technology at
Penn State, said.
Some faculty members in the department
don't think teaching students how to write viruses
is necessary in teaching computer security.
"Literature has shown us that you don't need
to teach how to write a computer virus," Raj
Acharya, head of the computer science and engi
neering department, said.
While the purpose of the class offered at the

University of Calgary was to help prevent viruses
and teach computer security, Don Heller, Penn
State associate professor of computer science and
engineering said he doesn't agree with the course.
"My reaction to a student who signs up for an
explicit course on virus software would be to dis
miss them," Heller said.
While Heller said he isn't fond of a class simply
on writing viruses, he sees a need for computer se
curity courses.
"It would be valuable to have a course in virus
protection, to recognize problems," Heller said.
Heller said there would be interest in a course
like that at Penn State and it is already a topic in
operating systems courses.
"What you see at Penn State is how to write, not
malicious code, but secure code," Domico said.
Both professors agree that the key to comput
er security is not knowing how to write a virus, but
rather knowing how to write a code that is secure.
"Money and resources are better spent in se
curing and prevention," Domico said.
Heller said he wonders about the safety of the
University of Calgary course, which used a sepa
rate computer lab and network, and students were

not permitted to take anything in or out of the
classroom.
"The idea that you can confine software in a
lab setting and study it without letting it get out to
the rest of the world has been proven wrong many
times," Heller said.
The security of the isolated setting depends on
the human element, which is why he would not at
tempt to offer a class like this, Acharya said.
"It is very difficult for a bunch of students to re
main disciplined," Acharya said.
One issue raised about such a class is whether
a student would be employable afterward.
"They would certainly be employable," Domi
co said.
Acharya said he agrees.
"If I was an employer, I would hire them. I
don't think they should have anything against
them," he said.
Heller isn't as confident as Domico in whether
students would be better able to obtain jobs after
taking a virus-writing class for prevention.
"In the context of prevention and analysis, it
looks a little better," Heller said.
