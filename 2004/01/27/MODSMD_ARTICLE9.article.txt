# Study examines how Mozart tunes affect brains of premies
## 
### BRIAN SEBASTIAN THE REVEILLE 
(U-WIRE) BATON ROUGE,
La. — Mozart and other classi
cal music is no longer reserved
for fancy concert halls. Now, with
the help of one Louisiana State
University professor, it can be
heard echoing through more spe
cialized chambers — hospital
incubators.
Music professor and Chair of
Music Educ-ation Jane Cassidy is
conducting research at Baton
Rouge's Woman's Hospital to
see if playing music to newborn
premature infants can stimulate
the babies' brains, so they can go
home earlier.
Cassidy, in compliance with
other researchers around the
country, has found that when
music is played to an infant, their
heart and respiratory rates im
prove and their head circumfer
ence increases.
"We've found that girl babies
in music therapy go home 11 days
earlier than girl babies with no
therapy," Cassidy said.
She said that boys did not
show the same results, which
means that girls and boys could
be wired differently.
Cassidy, who works only with
Dr. Steve Spedale at Woman's
Hospital, uses Mozart string
music and the "Rock-a-Bye" col
lection, a female singer with an
orchestral background, played
through her personal Walkman
CD player and a set of small
speakers.
Cassidy uses the music to try
to stimulate synapses, nerve cell
connections in the brain, and try
to encourage feeding reflexes.
Premature infants do not usu
ally have these reflexes because
the proper muscles have yet to be
properly formed. Cassidy tries to

build up these muscles by con
necting a touch sensitive pacifier
to a CD player.
This will teach the infants to
use their mouths to hear the
music, building up oral muscles
in exchange.
"I only have one baby right
now, but I've had 60, and hope to
end with 120," Cassidy said.
She said she works with
healthy babies between 1 and 4
pounds that were in the womb
for strictly 27 to 32 weeks in
stead, of the usual 40.
Most of her babies are tested
in isolettes, or incubators, which
provide for an excellent isolated
sound environment, Cassidy
said.
She said she has been working
on this project alone for three
years and expects to finish in
about three years.
"The study only lasts 17
days," Cassidy said. "It's just un
common to have a baby with all
the right conditions."
She said she usually works
with just one baby at a time.
Once Cassidy gets consent
from the parents, she starts by
measuring the head. Then she
will let the baby rest for a week.
After that week, she measures
the head again and starts to play
the music. The music is intro
duced very slowly and played at
three different decibel levels for
three separate groups of babies.
The music is played for 20
minutes a day for four days. The
order of which music is played
first depends on the study
group.
After the four days, Cassidy
measures the heads again, test
ing throughout the babies' heart
rate, respiratory rate and satu
ration level.
"So far, nothing seems to be
creating stress," Cassidy said.
