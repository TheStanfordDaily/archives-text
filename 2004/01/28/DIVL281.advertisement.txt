At home and in the office:
• The last person leaving a room turns out the lights.
• Use natural daylight when possible, instead of
artificial lights.
• Use washing machines and dishwashers in the early
mornings and late evenings.
• Run full loads of laundry. Glean out the dryer lint trap.
• Turn off computers, printers, faxes, TVs and radios,
when not in use.
• Contact us for more information, energy saving tips,
and answers to frequently asked questions.
