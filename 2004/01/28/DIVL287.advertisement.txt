"How I Write"
Conversations
Co-Sponsored by Undergraduate Research Programs
and the Stanford Writing Center
"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the
nuts and bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the
conversation will primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer compos
es, allowing us to examine habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and
delights. We will discuss how a writer generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines
research with composition, overcomes various impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic
innovations. Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that all writers can
learn and grow, and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights.
Join Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director of Undergraduate Research Programs for Honors
Writing, in a conversation on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers producing
work in all fields and genres.
