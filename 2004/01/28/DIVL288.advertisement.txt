"SiMfDtif FOR f EACE"
A Night of Jewish and Arab Comedy
Wed, Jan 28, 2004 @ Bpm
CoHo, Stanford's Tressider Union
Come for laughs as the Jewish American comedian Scott Blakeman and Palestinian-American
comedian Dean Obeidallah perform. They take up issues of family, Jewish and Arab upbring
ing in America, and of course, general political humor. They recently wowed a crowd of 250 at
Yale, and have individually made more than 30 national television appearances, including The
Late Show with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live.
