# Stanford Dining to unveil final phase of redevelopment
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ DESK EDITOR 
With Subway and Peet's Coffee already serving cus
tomers, the final phase of the Tresidder redevelopment
project is set to open today following a ribbon-cutting
ceremony at 11:15 a.m.
The food court, called Union Square, will offer sever
al food concepts new to Stanford's campus, including sal
ads by design, handmade wraps and bowls, takeout
pizza, fresh-made sushi and a global grill featuring a ro
tisserie, a tandoori oven and a smoker.
While Union Square's hours are currently set at 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, Nadeem Sid
diqui, executive director of Stanford Dining, expects that
Paradise Pizza will begin delivering its products at night
and on weekends after spring break. In addition, he and
his staff are also discussing extending Subway's service to
include the weekend.
Chef Steve Mesa designed the featured dishes and
spent several months testing and writing recipes. A few
of the dishes available include lamb kebabs, grilled
Japanese salmon, customized wraps and hand-tossed sal
ads with carved meats.
"I started to develop food at the Clark Center and
then I brought some of the ideas over here and investi
gated different food concepts," Mesa said. "In the last
month or so, we have worked on writing recipes, testing,
retesting and pricing the menu items."
Mesa and his staff prepared the new menu items in
tests runs on Monday and Tuesday, and guests were in
vited to taste them free of charge and to give feedback.
"The food is great," said Philip Dhingra, a senior.
"The quality is good, the spices are rich and the options
are plentiful and varied."
Sophomore Kevin Systrom agreed with Dhingra,
adding that the modern style of the building and the var
ious food choices are a welcome addition to campus.
"The international tastes offered at Union Square
complement the more domestic flavors of Subway and
Peet's Coffee," Systrom said.
In pricing the new menu items, Mesa and Director of
Retail Amanda Gotthold tried to create a tiered pricing
system and combo meals. Union Square offers several
meal possibilities under $5 and also features a grab-and
go station with complete bagged lunches.
"We want to keep things exciting," Gotthold said.
"It's all about learning what the customers want and then
making adjustments. We wanted things here that every
one can afford."

Gotthold also added that customer response to the
new facility will help the team of employees working at
Tresidder make the changes necessary to ensure that
business runs smoothly and efficiently.
"For the first two weeks, customers are trying to fig
ure things out and where to go," Gotthold said. "Once
they know how the system works, we can make changes
and work with their feedback."

Union Square, the new food court in Tresidder Union,
opens today.
While crews remodeled the kitchen and re
placing old equipment, several students designed
and painted a mural of the history of Stanford to
mark the opening of the final phase of the project.
In addition, Eric Montell, associate director of
Stanford Dining, has been collecting items for a
time capsule.
The completion of the dining facility brings to

an end a whirlwind string of projects for Stanford
Dining. In the past year. Dining remodeled Bran
ner's kitchen, opened LINX at the Clark Center
and spearheaded the Tresidder project.
"This is one of the fastest projects I have ever
done in my life," Siddiqui said. "One of the chal
lenges was making this space more operable and
user-friendly. It's still not perfect but it's better
than before."
Siddiqui attributes the success of the recent
projects to Dining's dedicated employees, and to
the Tresidder Dining Advisory Group, which has
met weekly since June to discuss the changes at
Tresidder.
