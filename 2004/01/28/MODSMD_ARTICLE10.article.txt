# Pell Grant amounts will not change

(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas Students will
be able to receive the same maximum Pell Grant
amounts as last fiscal year as part of a spending
plan Congress approved Thursday.
The plan also eliminates a proposed change in
the formula that determines a student's financial
need. More than 80,000 students would have lost
their Pell Grant eligibility if the change had oc
curred, the Chronicle of Higher Education report
ed Friday.
Some lobbyists are frustrated that there was
no increase in the $4,050 maximum Pell Grant al
lotment in a year when many colleges have raised
tuition or lost state funding. Pell Grants are given
to students with financial need and do not have to

be repaid.
"With the Pell Grant maximum grant frozen
for three years and most other student aid pro
grams frozen this year, college is becoming less
and less affordable for more students each year,"
said Becky Timmons, director of government rela
tions for the American Council on Education.
The University of Texas has about 7,500 Pell
Grant recipients who collect more than $2O million
a year, said Henry Urick, assistant director of Stu
dent Financial Services.
"We are always appreciative of extra grant as
sistance that can be provided, but the failure to in
crease the grants, while disappointing, is not un
expected," Urick said. "I would have been
pleased if they had doubled the amount, but un
fortunately, they could not find the funds for some
modest increase."

The lack of additional Pell Grant funds should
not significantly affect UT students even though
tuition has been increased, Urick said. Those who
qualify for Pell Grants would likely receive funds
set aside as part of the tuition hike for students
whose families make less than $BO,OOO a year.
Annie Clark, public relations sophomore, re
ceives a Pell Grant each semester that serves as a
substantial part of her financial aid package. Even
though she has three scholarships and the grant,
she still has to take out loans, she said.
"I'm grateful for what I receive, because if I
didn't, I'd have to take out extra loans or work
much harder for scholarships," Clark said. "The
grants are really helpful to people in my situation."
The spending bill also included increased funds
for the National Institutes of Health and the
AmeriCorps program.
