# Researcher will settle termination
## 
### BETH AARON UNIVERSITY DAILY 
(U-WIRE) LUBBOCK,
Texas A Texas Tech Univer
sity plague researcher who was
convicted of almost 50 felony
counts in December has agreed to
settle the terms of his termina
tion, despite earlier efforts to
fight them.
Health Sciences Center re
searcher Dr. Thomas Butler was
convicted of 47 felony counts of
embezzlement and mail and wire
fraud related to the plague scare
in January 2002.
Butler's attorney Floyd Hold
er declined to discuss the terms of
the settlement but said his client's
resignation from the HSC was ef
fective Friday.
"They made us an offer, and
we took the offer," he said. "It
was in the best interest for every
body. We could keep fighting, but
it wouldn't make much differ
ence, so we're paying them some
money and we're retiring."
HSC President Dr. M. Roy
Wilson said a settlement with
Butler will mark the end of Texas
Tech's involvement with the
matter.
"With restitution and resigna
tion, we will not pursue dis
missal," he said. "All issues with
Dr. Butler will be deemed re
solved."
Texas Tech General Counsel
Jeff Young said the details of But
ler's settlement should be worked

out sometime this month.
"Settlement negotiations are
ongoing and may be resolved
shortly," he said. "He has made a
written offer, and we are now in
the process of responding."
Phone calls made to Butler's
residence went unanswered Fri
day.
In December, Butler was con
victed of 47 felony counts includ
ing embezzlement, and mail and
wire fraud related to a bubonic
plague scare that involved an FBI
investigation and resulted in a
briefing to President George W.
Bush regarding the incident.
Texas Tech Chancellor Dr.
David Smith did not return phone
calls seeking comment on the set
tlement.
Earlier this month, a commit
tee was scheduled to hear Butler's
appeal, but it had not yet been
formed. The hearing intended to
address Butler's termination
from the university.
Though not directly involved
in the case, Tom Lehman, a pro
fessor in the department of geo
sciences, said he has followed the
case closely and believes the uni
versity prefers university officials
not engage in a hearing.
"(HSC) would rather that the
hearing not take place," he said.
"They'll rather he resign before
that happens, and they want him
to pay."
Dr. Richard Homan, dean of
the school of medicine, was not
available for comment.
