"I was very worried when I first fol
lowed your dad to Stanford because it
was my first time living in the States," my
mom used to say.
As I sit looking into Betty Farrell's
eyes, I can see where my mom found
counsel and how she overcame her wor
ries. There is an inexplicable aura about
Betty Farrell's face. Her eyes offer an
overwhelming sense of comfort, exuding
a vibrant glow, and shy wrinkles appear
around her eyes whenever she smiles.
Her lively, jovial voice belies her age.
Next to her sits Pat Farrell, his white hair
occasionally shifting as he nods enthusi
astically at her words.
Here is a couple that has grown with
Stanford. They have witnessed Stanford
growing not only as a university commu
nity, but also as an invaluable asset to the
fabric of a bigger community. Actually,
they have done more than watch. The
Farrells have actively taken part in shap
ing what Stanford is today, by volunteer
ing their time to engage with the student
and faculty of the university.
Since the early 1980s, Betty Farrell
has been involved with the University
through the Bechtel International Cen
ter. She was a vital part of the Bechtel's
English-in-Action, a subsidiary program
under the Community Committee for In
ternational Students. The non-profit or
ganization was started to ease the culture
and language transition for international
students of Stanford and their families to
California.
"I was the 'welcome to California
lady,' " says Farrell. As a volunteer, she
conducted weekly English conversation
classes and personally invited interna
tional families to her home to ease their
adjustment to the local culture.
A California native, Betty Farrell de
cided to get involved with the Bechtel
programs through her meeting with a
young Vietnamese woman nearly 25
years ago. Double-tasking between the
roles of a college student and the moth
er of three, the woman was in need of
dire help not only in language but also
in moral support. "After classes, she
would stop by my home for tutoring and
some emotional support," Farrell says.
Realizing that one woman could really
make a difference in another's life, Far
rell plunged into university involve
ment that has now continued for twenty

years.
Farrell's husband, Pat, has also been
connected to the university by slightly
different means. Involved in construc
tion, Pat Farrell has remodeled several
homes of the professors at Stanford.
"The most extensive remodeling was to
the home of the then Medical School De
partment head," he says. As president of
the community rotary club, Mr. Farrell is
still proactively engaged with the Stan
ford community and is a living connec
tion to the university.
The couple confesses that they have
actually gained more from their experi
ences than they have given to the univer
sity. "The students have become wonder
ful, life-lasting friends to us," they say.
The students who've been helped by the
Farrells have said their thanks by inviting
the couple to Korea, Japan and Ger
many.
"A Peruvian student we helped got
married to a visiting German Scholar
while she was at Stanford. Years ago,
they invited us to their castle in Ger
many, and what a great experience it
was," exclaims Betty Farrell.
Now, in their 70s, the Farrells enjoy
many international friendships that tran
scend school and country borders.
"When Betty and Pat came into my
life, they became more than English tu
tors," exclaimed my mom, one of Betty's
students from nearly 25 years ago.
They've become lifelong friends, one of
the first families I mark off on my Christ
mas list. I will never be able to forget
their help."
"Children of the students that we've
helped over 20 years ago still return to
our home to attend school," says Betty
Farrell. "Our home is full of artifacts, pic
tures, and mementos given to us by those
Stanford students we've helped."
Stanford University is thus based
upon an intricate and intimate web of
people in and out of the University. The
Farrells are merely two of the many com
munity volunteers who have contributed
to building the bridge between the school
and environment.
Indeed, such a priceless relationship
with community members is the true
'Stanford connection' that links the en
tire Stanford community. "Stanford is
the incubator of ideas for the whole Bay
Area," says Betty Farrell. This place is
more than just a university, but a com
munal existence rooted in the love for its
intellectual and social vigor.
