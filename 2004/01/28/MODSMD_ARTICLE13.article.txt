# 'Mister Wonderful' (the yes man) cometh
## 
### 
Forget Dr. Feelgood, the
band-lads formerly, and
rather unattractively,
known as Pigboy Char
lie. There's a new solo artist in
town to remedy modern ego mal
adies via textual healing hitting
the auditory sweet spot that is the
inner cochlea, and he goes by the
name "Mr. Wonderful."
The girls back home have been
raving about "Mr. Wonderful," so
I opt to size up the merchandise
by Googling him. His mug shot

pops up instant
ly. He's on the
small side, but
more than com
pensates for his
limited stature
with huge feet,
game show
host-caliber
pearly whites,
enormous
cobalt peepers

and an ample chin hard-wired for
evolutionary superiority. And de
spite his dreamboat looks, he's
eager to please: He poses with two
thumbs up, way up and his blurb
claims that he specializes in paci
fying women who push his but
tons.
The man is a dummy. And I
mean that literally.
It is a tad disturbing to note
that one of the best-selling gifts in
America lately and one of the
bestselling Christmas gifts last
year is a mass-market man
nikan (a little man doll) that flat
ters on command. Online stores
are out of stock of the thing. Even
in my native Berkeley,
cognoscenti hotbed, the talking
"Mr. Wonderful" doll (think
Teddy Ruxpin with a limited vo
cabulary and a body wax, o ye

children of the 80s) was the top
seller at Bed, Bath & Beyond.
What's sad is that this is no white
elephant gift sisters are buying
it for themselves. As I browsed at
Pegasus Books recently,, I
couldn't help but wonder about
the straitlaiced, trenchcoated ma
tron sedately paging through
Grossman's new translation of
"Don Quixote." Would she, in
the space of a few short hours, be
home tapping the button on Mr.
Wonderful's palm in order to
hear one of his 12 battery-operat
ed platitudes, such as "Let's cud
dle tonight," or "Why don't we go
to the mall? Don't you want some
new shoes?" Would the stud-col
lared riot grrrl sullenly flipping
through the "Indie" CDs at
Amoeba awaken the next day to a
prerecorded "You look so beau
tiful in the morning"?
Of course, this insatiable need
for praise, for approval begged,
borrowed or steel-riveted is not
limited to the fair sex alone. Con
sidering this, I had to wonder:
Why are we so desperate to gain
approval that we go to such
ridiculous lengths? (Albeit a
modest 12 inches high.)
"If anyone dared to say, 'Who
ever is not for me, is against me,'
he would immediately have all
men against him." Sound famil
iar? Well, this quote is of less re
cent vintage than the average
news junkie might guess. Time
was when Nietzsche's On the Ge
nealogy of Morals aphorism held
true, but oh, how times have
changed. Just like those dolls who
buy "Mr. Wonderful," the pow
ers-that-be want to hear unquali
fied praise without earning it first,
and they want it on-demand.
They would divide the world into

two camps our friends and our
foes. Those old friends who dis
approve of America's actions,
they say, are not neutral allies but
rather ingrate saboteurs. Ameri
ca is so desperate to regain our
former buddies' approval that a
plan was drawn up (unbeknownst
to us hoi polloi until just recently)
to deploy gumshoes to spy on Eu
ropean diplomats in order to pro
cure info that would bring some
fence-sitters over to our side. But
we're not desperate enough to at
tempt more substantial, and more
risky, tactics.
Those who take don't place a
premium on cosmetic tactics
used to gain others' approval are
viewed with suspicion. Recently,
in "Stand by Your Man '04":
Judy Dean's TV moment" (an
article on salon.com), Rebecca
Traister got snarky in an other
wise fair and balanced article
about Judy Dean, presidential
candidate Howard Dean's wife,
for failing to keep up with appear
ances: "[Judy] Dean is toothy; she
doesn't seem to use much hair
product; her face shows her age. It
was both fun and horrifying to
imagine her dismay at being set on
by a team of eager ABC makeup
artists, dying to go where only
Noxzema has been before. It was
also sad to watch her being forced
to look at a photo the only
photo? of Laura Bush in
evening wear." To pillory Judy
Dean for ruling out the Max Fac
tor, or for exclaiming multiple
times that she loves her job, she
reminds me of those high-pony
tailed Muffies in high school who
huddled in the bathroom during
lab break in a hallucinogenic cu
mulus of Herbal Essence, making
fun of the goth chemgenius for her

admittedly plentiful dandruff and
Velvet Goldmine eyeliner. It's de
tail, folks, details. Besides, if the
contest for First Ladydom were a
beauty pageant, all we'd get was a
winner who'd devise a universal
healthcare plan listing lipo as tax
deductible.
Is the iGeneration likewise
writing itself off in our rush to at
tain others' fast-track approval?
Even many of us college students
are neglecting introspection and
personal achievement and nab
bing grab-and-go material indica
tors of self-worth. This just in, hot
off the presses: The premium
frosh place on becoming "very
well-off financially" is the highest
in 13 years, according to the "An
nual Freshman Survey," released
days ago and written up in the El
Lay Times. Surveyors canvassed
some 267,449 students at 413 col
leges and universities, so I know
they didn't only question rarefied
folk like a fellow student-who
shall-remain-nameless, who wor
ried that he would still be driving
his "winter" car (a Mercedes,
thankyouverymuch) come spring
time because he hadn't yet found
a suitable SUV. Meanwhile, the
percentage of college freshmen
who consider it imperative to "de
velop a meaningful philosophy of
life" is at an all-time low. Granted,
it's an economic downturn, and
hopefully the data reflects a
youth-culture attitude that is
cyclical. But we might want to re
flect more on things if we wish to
attain Aristotle's eudaimonia
happiness, fulfilling one's poten
tial-instead of settling for Biggie-
Size monomania.

Our outlook is bleak
When approval is all we crave

and the moment is grand
Your pride is sickening
In your conformity
But this moment is grand
—Shai Hulud, "Eating Bullets of
Acceptance"
For a while, one of the "cool"
things to do in fifth grade was hang
out in Live Oak Park after school.
All the kids would engage in an
initiation rite that would have
done Margaret Meade proud,
queuing up to jump from one side
of the creek to the other while
someone's jam box blasted the de
funct backwards-dressing rap duo
Kriss Kross's "Jump" on continu
ous-loop autoplay in the back
ground. Two rules of jump club:
(1) you had to reach the other side
on the word "jump" in the song,
and (2) no tripping, or you were
roundly booed. So I jumped, and
that made all the difference.

"One day we reading were for our
delight
Of Launcelot, how Love did him
enthral.
Alone we were and without any
fear.
Full many a time our eyes together
drew
That reading, and drove the colour
from our faces;
But one point only was it that o 'er
came us.
When as we read of the much
longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne 'er from me shall
be divided,
Kissed me upon the mouth all pal
pitating.
Galeotto was the book and he who
wrote it.
That day no farther did we read
therein."

It is a tad disturbing to note

Of course, this insatiable need
for praise, for approval begged,

Why are we so desperate to gain

"If anyone dared to say, 'Who

Judy Dean's TV moment" (an
article on salon.com), Rebecca
Traister got snarky in an other
wise fair and balanced article
about Judy Dean, presidential
candidate Howard Dean's wife,
for failing to keep up with appear
ances: "[Judy] Dean is toothy; she
doesn't seem to use much hair
product; her face shows her age. It
was both fun and horrifying to
imagine her dismay at being set on
by a team of eager ABC makeup
artists, dying to go where only
Noxzema has been before. It was
also sad to watch her being forced
to look at a photo the only
photo? of Laura Bush in
evening wear." To pillory Judy
Dean for ruling out the Max Fac
tor, or for exclaiming multiple
times that she loves her job, she
reminds me of those high-pony
tailed Muffies in high school who
huddled in the bathroom during
lab break in a hallucinogenic cu
mulus of Herbal Essence, making
fun of the goth chemgenius for her

admittedly plentiful dandruff and
Velvet Goldmine eyeliner. It's de
tail, folks, details. Besides, if the
contest for First Ladydom were a
beauty pageant, all we'd get was a
winner who'd devise a universal
healthcare plan listing lipo as tax
deductible.
Is the iGeneration likewise
writing itself off in our rush to at
tain others' fast-track approval?
Even many of us college students
are neglecting introspection and
personal achievement and nab
bing grab-and-go material indica
tors of self-worth. This just in, hot
off the presses: The premium
frosh place on becoming "very
well-off financially" is the highest
in 13 years, according to the "An
nual Freshman Survey," released
days ago and written up in the El
Lay Times. Surveyors canvassed
some 267,449 students at 413 col
leges and universities, so I know
they didn't only question rarefied
folk like a fellow student-who
shall-remain-nameless, who wor
ried that he would still be driving
his "winter" car (a Mercedes,
thankyouverymuch) come spring
time because he hadn't yet found
a suitable SUV. Meanwhile, the
percentage of college freshmen
who consider it imperative to "de
velop a meaningful philosophy of
life" is at an all-time low. Granted,
it's an economic downturn, and
hopefully the data reflects a
youth-culture attitude that is
cyclical. But we might want to re
flect more on things if we wish to
attain Aristotle's eudaimonia
happiness, fulfilling one's poten
tial-instead of settling for Biggie-
Size monomania.

Our outlook is bleak
When approval is all we crave

and the moment is grand
Your pride is sickening
In your conformity
But this moment is grand
—Shai Hulud, "Eating Bullets of
Acceptance"
For a while, one of the "cool"
things to do in fifth grade was hang
out in Live Oak Park after school.
All the kids would engage in an
initiation rite that would have
done Margaret Meade proud,
queuing up to jump from one side
of the creek to the other while
someone's jam box blasted the de
funct backwards-dressing rap duo
Kriss Kross's "Jump" on continu
ous-loop autoplay in the back
ground. Two rules of jump club:
(1) you had to reach the other side
on the word "jump" in the song,
and (2) no tripping, or you were
roundly booed. So I jumped, and
that made all the difference.

"One day we reading were for our
delight
Of Launcelot, how Love did him
enthral.
Alone we were and without any
fear.
Full many a time our eyes together
drew
That reading, and drove the colour
from our faces;
But one point only was it that o 'er
came us.
When as we read of the much
longed-for smile
Being by such a noble lover kissed,
This one, who ne 'er from me shall
be divided,
Kissed me upon the mouth all pal
pitating.
Galeotto was the book and he who
wrote it.
That day no farther did we read
therein."
