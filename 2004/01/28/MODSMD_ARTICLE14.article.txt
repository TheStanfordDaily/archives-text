## Fee refunds reflect student discontent 
### 
ASSU leaders announced this
week a looming crisis with spe
cial fee reserves due to the near
doubling of the number of stu
dents who requested special fee refunds last
fall. The increase in refund requests puts a
financial strain on the special fees budget
and thus could force a depletion of funds.
We urge the ASSU to act prudently in ap
proving this year's groups and consider
long-term solutions to the student funding
catastrophe.
In the last four years, the gradual rise in
the refund rate has mirrored the rise in un
dergraduate student fees. From fall quarter
of 2000 to the start of the current school
year, ASSU undergraduate fees have in
creased nearly 40

J
percent while the re
fund rate has risen
from 5.35 percent to
14.08 percent. Part of
this increase in the
refund rate is unde
niably linked to in
creasing student
frustration at the
high fees automati
cally applied to their

bills.
While a quick and easy short-term answer
may appear to be raising fees for spring
quarter, such action is likely to intensify the
problem and cause even more students to
request refunds. Any lasting solution must
address these high rates of students reques
tion refunds and impose a more stringent
screening process for student groups on the
special fees ballot. The ASSU and students
have a vital role to play in achieving these
means.
ASSU leaders control the number of
groups that appear on the ballot and must
work to ensure groups that receive money
provide campus-wide services. Many stu
dent groups are doing amazing work that
currently relies heavily on special fee fund
ing to survive, but unless those activities
benefit the vast majority of campus, and not
just a small subset of the population, special
fees should not foot the bill. Instead, the
University should do more to support
groups whose mission is vital to creating a
rich and vibrant university community, but

do not service a large cross-section of the
student body.
While reform of the ASSU's protocol for
putting groups on the special fees ballot
must be part of any long-term solution, stu
dent voters must also realize their direct re
sponsibility in the refund crisis. Anecdotal
evidence shows a recent increase in the
number of students who approve group's
funding requests and then ask for refunds
on those same requests. Since the money to
finance refund requests comes of the ASSU
buffer fund and not student groups' current
operating funds, it might seem like a win
win situation. But the clear loser is a special
fee system on the verge of bankruptcy that
can no longer sustain such hypocrisy. To
vote yes on a group's funding request and

then to request a re
fund is to scam the
system and endan
gers a funding mech
anism that plays a
valuable role in im
proving student life
on campus. Any
long-term solution
implemented by the
ASSU must also ad

dress this disconnect in voting approval pat
terns and refund requests.
In the short term, one of the most promis
ing solutions to the crisis is to fund particu
larly high refund requests by using money
from group's special-fee reserves. Such a
proposal will protect groups' current oper
ating budgets and planned services, but will
decrease their fund of extra monies carried
over from one year to fhe next. Part of the
current problem stems from the attitude
that asking for a refund does not hurt stu
dent groups and is simply covered by vast
ASSU reserves. When student groups with
high refund rates start to feel the strain of
their peers' decisions to reduce their fund
ing, attitudes will start to change as well.
A system as complex and large as special
fees cannot be reformed over night, but un
less the ASSU and students deeply engage
in a dialogue about long-term solutions as
well as a short-term fix, the problems will
never be solved just shoved under the
rug until next quarter.
