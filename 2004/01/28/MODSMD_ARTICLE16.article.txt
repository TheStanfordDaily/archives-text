## MINDFUL MUSINGS How much would you pay? 
### 
When you hit junior year
at Stanford, you've
pretty much dug out
your little niche on
campus: You have your close bunch
of friends, your selected extracur
ricular activities, you've declared
your major (well, most of us have),
and you pretty much end up taking
classes with the same people over
and over again. It's not a bad life,
but you can start drifting into the
doldrums of Farm life.
So what could be better than to
freshen up your schedule than to
surround yourself with people who
are still excited about the Stanford
experience during the bleak winter
quarter the cheerful, enthusiastic
freshmen and to take a course
outside of your major. I decided to
step out of my Human Biology bub
ble this quarter and try a class in an
other department: Economics 1.
Yes, I'm in a class with 200 fresh
men and a cluster of upperclassmen.
It brings me back to my freshman
days: the times when I used to bike
to my large lecture courses with a
gaggle of my dorm buddies. We'd all
sit in a bunch in the same seats every
single day, whisper in class and sit
very still when the intimidating pro
fessor looked us directly in the eye.
Then, quite naturally, we'd freak
out in unison when the first
midterms were approaching.
These days, the upperclassmen
tend to arrive to their classes alone
maybe sitting with one or two
close friends or acquaintances. Our
thoughts are preoccupied with sum
mer internship applications and
cover letters, rather than on with
whom our roommates will set us up
for screw-your-roommate or how
much the new alcohol policy has
drowned out frosh party life.
But let's get back to Econ 1.1 re
ally think it is one of the best intro
ductory courses taught at Stanford,
and I would strongly suggest cutting
back on the I-Hum and making
Econ 1 a requirement freshman
year after all, if you don't know
how the United States tax system
works or you're lost whenever Alan
Greenspan talks about interest
rates, well then, drop the Aristotle
reader and think about taking this
course.
I know what you're thinking:
No, the professor didn't promise
me an "A" if I encouraged people
to take this course we're actually

still in negotiations about my com
pensation. (I'm still pushing for the

"A+." I'll let you
know what hap
pens.)
Anyhow, the
course has con
vinced me to think
about the world in
pure economic
terms.
Imagine if
Stanford was run
as a free market,
where you could

decide where your money would go
based on supply and demand. How
would the Stanford experience be
different? Would we find the ineffi
ciencies in the way that our institu
tion runs?
Now, Econ majors and those
who are taking upper-division
Econ courses, please forgive my
simplified economic analysis. I'm in
Econ 1, for goodness sakes, give me
a break. I'll, forgive you someday
when you go to the doctor one day
and you're not quite sure what a
Percutaneous Transluminal Coro
nary Angioplasty is because you
didn't take any upper-division
Hum√üio or Biology courses.
Back to our model of Stanford as
the ultimate free market. Now, to
be true economists, we have to
make a bunch of assumptions. My
first assumption here is that the pur
pose of Stanford is to provide a
high-quality undergraduate educa
tion. Clearly, Stanford serves a vari
ety of other purpose such as pro
viding sketchy grad students a place
to study while trying to date under
grads, and allowing professors to
change the world with ground
breaking research so they can pub
lish and research and publish and
research... and then maybe get
tenure to name a few examples.
But for our purpose here, we'll
focus on the undergrads.
Second, we'd have to assume
that there would be no required
courses because that would distort
our market, and besides, the world
would be better without GERs. Es
pecially those hard-to-fulfill Area
4s.
Let Adam Smith's "invisible
hand" work its magic! I'm sure at
some point someone around you
has calculated the cost of attending
your average 50-minute lecture at
Stanford. I've heard it's about $lOO.

I know, it hurts. And it hurts even
more when you fall asleep at lecture
or you sleep in. But what if you paid
the market price, the value that you
assigned to the course? Well, we all
know the answer to that question:
Many I-Hum courses would disap
pear. See, economics can make the
world better!
Yet other courses might be so as
tronomically expensive that we
would have all sorts of equity issues,
but hey, at least it would make you
think about the value of your edu
cation. Maybe if you consciously
knew you were paying a certain
amount to take a class, you'd go to
lecture more often or you'd try
harder. Or maybe professors would
make a course more interesting and
/ or applicable to boost the value of
a course. And, an important consid
eration: What would our willing
ness-to-pay figures reveal about
our educational values?
Or what if you could choose how
much to give to student life pro
grams, such as Residential Educa
tion? Some kids would be quick to
keep their bucks; while others are
generally pleased with the many
programs offered and would be
glad to continue sending their con
tributions. At least it would give the
University an opportunity to see
which programs students really
value and care about, and which
ones are simply a waste of money.
And then there are those infa
mous palm trees. I think I get an e
mail every year telling me the
shocking fact that they each cost
$40,000, and there's currently some
petition going around to allocate
that money differently. Would you
change the aesthetics of Stanford?
How much value would you assign
to the beauty of the campus? How
much would you be willing to pay to
make it look like it does today?
We could go on forever, but
hopefully this little economic exer
cise makes you think a bit about
where your money (or rather, your
parent's hard-earned S4OK) goes
every year. And perhaps it'll make
you think twice about sleeping in
lecture unless of course, it's I-
Hum, and then I completely under
stand.

Hey, are you taking Econ 1, too? E
