Taking a closer look at the
word 'minority 7

I am writing in response to Mek
lit Workneh's column ("An eagle
eye view race in America," Jan. 22).
Workneh's insights on the racial
conflicts and discriminations in the
United States warrant a second
thought. This past week marked the
celebration of Martin Luther King
Jr.'s dream. Sadly, on the Stanford
campus, many of us still fail to rec
ognize of the significance of his spir
its. I agreed with Workneh that our
roles and identities change in vari
ous circumstances. However, it is
our responsibility to manage all the
different roles to understand who
we actually are.
Role-playing has been exam
ined critically in the field of socio
logical social psychology. However,
few of us are experts in managing
our own action and identities in var
ious circumstances. It comes the
times that we have feelings of hap
piness, isolations, loneliness and
joy. What matters most is how we
manage ourselves when we are
among different groups.
Workneh's article points out a sig
nificant physical characteristic com
prise our identity, which plays a crit
ical part in shaping our action.
Just like Workneh, I have been a
majority, a minority and an interna
tional student for eight years. When
I am at home back in Hong Kong, I
am a majority. When I am in the
United States, I am a minority.
What does it mean to be someone
in between black and white? Most
of the study on race focuses on the
ethnic relations between the White
and the Black. Many believe that
Asians are the quiet group in the
United States, who cares less about
discrimination and racial conflicts
but exerts all their effort on educa
tional and status attainment. This is
the wrong perception that the pub
he has. Instead, the apparent apathy
of Asians in America has to do with

the ignorance and negligence of the
majority on their opinions. Who
cares what the Asians think if they
have limited political presence and
influence in the country.
During my tenure as a teaching
assistant on campus, I have taken
the opportunity to examine the dy
namic of students in the classrooms.
Sadly, some students still do raise
the eyebrows when students of the
minority (especially if they speak
with an accent) raise questions in
sections. In group discussions, I
have witnessed numerous accounts
that some minority students are de
â€¢ pleted of the opportunities to ex
press their viewpoints when they
are in a group with classmates of
other race. It is the invisible pres
sure that minorities experience
when they are in group settings.
They feel that they need to make a
superb statement to have their
ideas heard.
I highly challenge every reader
to take a closer look at their action
toward people of minority, whether
it is gender, race, religion, national
ity or sexual identity. Imagine your
self being a minority in a foreign
country. Take the opportunity to
study or work abroad. I believe that
you will have a new perspective of
what it means to be on the other
side of the spectrum.

The Great Donation is a
great idea

We believe the Great Donation
is a great idea. We are also opti
mistic that a majority of students
will agree. As such, we'd like to give
a quick reply to Friday's editorial
("Great Donation might not be so
great," Jan. 23).
The editorial criticizes the Great
Donation because it would require
minimal involvement on the part of
students, save for a few financial
transactions. To be sure, few stu

dents will be required in the actual
fulfillment of the Great Donation.
We are not asking for money to cre
ate international service opportuni
ties for students; that is for the Haas
Center and special fees groups. Our
idea is to give the money as directly
as possible to those who need it
most people dying of hunger,
disease and lack of shelter.
Let us be clear: We are not a stu
dent group in the conventional
sense. We are students seeking to
create an annual referendum
through which students can vote to
add $3 to the next year's ASSU fee.
The Daily is correct; our goal does
not fall under the umbrella of spe
cial fees groups. In fact, if this pro
posal passes, we will cease to be a
functioning group and the caretak
ing of the Great Donation will be
come a function of the ASSU.
We believe it is a cause for cele
bration that the Great Donation
will require little from students
merely the time it takes to cast a
vote and, if the referendum passes,
a refundable contribution of $3.
That's 30 seconds in front of a com
puter screen and less than the cost
of a Jamba Juice.
We think the Great Donation is
a service to students. Plenty of Stan
ford students walk around with the
awareness that the three bucks
they're shelling out for coffee could
save a life but don't have an option
to use that money for that purpose
while standing in line at Peet's or
Moonbean's.
This is a new idea. We feel it re
flects the sentiment of the student
body.
