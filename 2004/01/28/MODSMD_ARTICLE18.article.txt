## Super Bowl XXXVII: You gotta see this 
### 
Ray Lewis let loose the krunkest Super
Bowl introduction dance I have ever
seen in 2001. As he strutted, popped
and locked looking like a beast pos
sessed, the world could feel the pain this man was
about to uncork on the opposing offense. A
thousand miles away in front of my 80s techni
color Magnavox, I was afraid to look him in the
eye. A 15-inch tall image inside a TV, and I could
still feel this man's shoulder driving through my
gut and my back burying into the turf to the
sound of 50,000 gaping spectators "oh damn
ing" in And 1 Mixtape fashion.
Alex Snyder, the elementary school kid who
always tried to squeeze his seven-inch carrot top
in the same dirty hat from third to sixth grade
was a Bills fan. The hat was of course a bright
blue and red wool Starter adjustable that broad
casted Buffalo Bills in offset capital letters. The
ridicule that hat suffered under the crushing

power of size five Timberlands
and freezing-cold water foun
tains in the lockerroom.
As Alex was nicknamed "oh
fer" in those years, partially due
to his poor and untimely knock
knock jokes, but mostly the 0-4
his beloved bills posted in con
secutive Super Bowls, so was
suppressed the unsung feats of
his Buffalo team, the best of
which might just have occurred
in Super Bowl XXVII. A Larry

Allen fumble recovery and 370-pound showboat
down the sidelines en route to the lineman's first
career touchdown in midst of a 57-10 romp of
Buffalo, the icing on the Dallas victory cake, was
miraculously cut short by the determination of
the fleet-footed Bills all-pro receiver Don
Beebe, who closed 80 yards on Allen who
would later be caught with 20 pounds of marijua
na in his car in the offseason and strip the
showman at the goalline in an undeniably ad
mirable display of "you can have your win but
don't flaunt it, fatboy."
And Thurman Thomas rushing for 194 yards
against a Giants defense primed to stop the pass
in a Super Bowl XXV match. I snuck up to the
loft from bed as a 7-year-old to watch, on mute,
as Steve Christie shanked a World Champi
onship winning field goal while my mom and dad
slept in good conscience of their parenting skills
right above my head.
And then Willis Magahee had his leg put on
display in Joe Theisman fashion in the title game
in front of a national television audience. Yeah I
know it wasn't the Super Bowl, but how could a
hit like that not remind you of Ray Lewis ripping
off the funkiest ever intro dance and putting the
fear off all things holy into the Giants en route to
garnering Super Bowl MVP?
The Superbowl party in 1996 had the a tray of
four alarm buffalo wings that sent me running for
the Pepcid as a 12-year-old for the next two
weeks. In a Green Bay thrashing of New Eng
land those wings and the special order, "King-
Sized for George Muresan" 90,000 calorie, 10-
pound Nestle crunch bar melting by the stove
were the closest I would come to tasting the
sweetness of a football championship that year.
And every year after for that matter, as Mad
den 96, 97, 98 and Madden 64 offered no such
victory in player vs. CPU rematches of that 1996
thrashing, in every mode from all-pro to begin
ner. Until 2002.
Because in 2002 a heroic New Englander's
foot brought home a Patriots victory in New Or
leans as well as a few broken kneecaps to all
those Vegas had conned into throwing ten thou
to a six-point St. Louis spread. But as vivid as the
sight of a naive Tom Brady tossing his arms to
the sky in midst of a shower of red white and blue
confetti looms large in the mental sports data
bank, it can claim just second place to the Super
Bowl memory permanently ingrained in my
head on Jan. 30, 2000: the first quarter commer
cial break Victoria's Secret Spot.
Every model I'd dreamed of marrying since I
was an 11-year-old hooked on playing
M.A.S.H.O. at recess strutted that runway in
lace, fishnets and stilettos. Tyra walked out in
something really cool I didn't even know about.
Lights were flashing, techno was blaring in sur
round sound, legs were glittered and wives' ears
around the country were smoking. You ask me
who the MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV was and I
tell you, hands down: Heidi Klum.
When that ad came on, I melted through my
futon. My friend's 3-year-old brother beside me
sat motionless, mouth gaping, eyes fixed on the
screen and I could actually see the exact moment
his inner primate signaled he had become a man.
The dog drooled all over the floor. My friend's
dad came charging in at the sound of the music
and slipped barefoot on the drool. He landed
hard, somehow already transfixed on the screen,
and I could actually see the exact moment his
inner primate signaled he had become a man.
The Asian kid on the end of the sofa turned
white. The black kid in the armchair turned
Asian. My friend's mom came in and demanded,
"what is this crap?" The whole football world
lost its mind.
And it is with this Super Bowl history in mind
I turn to my remote, wishing it were a magic tele
vision 8 ball so I can ask it what this Sunday's
game might hold, and I might rest assured skip
ping out on a few hours of cramming at Green
might be the brunt of "remember when" stories
for years to come. But I already know the an
swer.
