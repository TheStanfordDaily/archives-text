# North defeats South in Pac-10 play
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Last weekend in the Pacific 10 Conference, the Bay Area
schools swept the visiting Los Angeles schools for the second
straight season, as California won back-to-back games for the
first time all season and moved into fourth place in the Pac-10.
Cal (8-8,4-3 Pac-10) edged Southern California (8-9,3-4),
63-62, on Thursday, and then knocked off fading UCLA (9-6,
5-3) on Saturday, 76-62 marking the third and fourth times
this season that the Golden Bears have held an opponent to
exactly 62 points.
Against the Trojans, Richard Midgley continued his resur
gence, racking up 22 points, seven rebounds and five assists to
lead the Bears, while freshman phenom Leon Powe chipped
in with 14 points and eight boards. Jeff McMillan had 12
points and pulled 11 off the glass for USC, which was led by
Desmon Farmer's 17-point effort. The game came down to
the wire, as USC led 62-61 before Cal's Ayinde Übaka sank
two late free throws.
Saturday saw a tired UCLA squad, fresh off its loss to Stan
ford, fall handily to the Bears. Powe had 19 points and 14
boards despite shooting just 7-of-16 from the free-throw line
and center Amit Tamir also added 19 points. UCLA, which
got to the line just 16 times (compared to Cal's 38), was led by
Dijon Thompson, who had 17 points on 5-of-14 shooting.
While the Bruins couldn't have headed home happy after
two double-digit defeats, it might have been an even tougher
weekend to swallow for the Trojans, which led Cal in the wan
ing moments of Thursday's game and held a 34-28 halftime
lead on the Cardinal, yet went home with the same old 0-2
record as UCLA did.
No. 2 Stanford (16-0,7-0) breezed past the Bruins, 67-52,
on Thursday and knocked off a determined USC squad, 77-
67, on Saturday.
An early 31-7 run catapulted the Cardinal to a 42-21 half
time lead over the Bruins. UCLA played better in the second
half, but the Cardinal still won comfortably, clearing its bench
and playing 14 players. Forward Justin Davis made his first
nine shots and finished with 21 points and five offensive re
bounds for the Cardinal, while Thompson was the only Bruin
in double figures. Thompson scored 15 points on 6-of-14
shooting, although he did not tally a single rebound or assist.
Farmer, one of the Pac-10's most exciting and excitable
players, brought his full intensity to Saturday's contest,
sparking an impressive, lightning-quick Trojan defense and
knocked down some tough jumpers as USC played perhaps
the best half of any Stanford opponent this year. But in the
second half, Stanford turned the Trojans' pressuring tactics
against them, pushing the ball upcourt for easy baskets in tran
sition before USC could settle into its defensive sets.
Nick Robinson had 13 points all in the second half
and ran the Trojans ragged. Chris Hernandez added 18 on just
six shots, hitting 3-of-3 three-pointers while dishing out 7 as
sists. Farmer led USC with 19 points, while the usually pro
ductive McMillan the Pac-10's runaway leader in field
goal percentage was neutralized, garnering just two points
on l-of-4 shooting while committing five turnovers and four
fouls in 26 minutes.
No. 9 Arizona asserted its status as the Pac-10's second
best team with a pair of convincing home wins that helped it
jump back into the top ten this week. The Wildcats entered
the weekend ranked No. 14, but ran roughshod over Oregon
State (8-9,2-5), 109-75, on Thursday and thrashed Oregon (9-
5,4-3) on Sunday, 90-66.
Hassan Adams and Salim Stoudamire scored 20 apiece
and Andre Iguodala chipped in 19 points, eight boards and
seven assists as Arizona outgunned Oregon State on Thurs

Washington (7-8,2-5) garnered its
second straight conference win after
opening Pac-10 play with five losses,
knocking off host Washington State
(8-9,2-5), 75-62, on Saturday.
Nate Robinson, a 5-foot-8 sopho

the Huskies, which shot 56 percent
from the floor and 9-of-17 from down
town. Will Conroy added 14 on 4-of-6
shooting, while Brandon Roy pulled
down a game-high 12 boards to go
with his nine points.
The Cougars hit 10-of-20 three
pointers themselves en route to their
second-most prolific offensive game
of the conference season, but couldn't
keep pace with their athletic visitors

from Seattle. The Cougars' Jeff
Varem had 14 points and Thomas Ke

Moore continued to struggle. The star
senior and NBA prospect shot just 4-

and no rebounds to his credit.

two double-digit defeats, it might have been an even tougher
weekend to swallow for the Trojans, which led Cal in the wan
ing moments of Thursday's game and held a 34-28 halftime
lead on the Cardinal, yet went home with the same old 0-2
record as UCLA did.
No. 2 Stanford (16-0,7-0) breezed past the Bruins, 67-52,
on Thursday and knocked off a determined USC squad, 77-
67, on Saturday.
An early 31-7 run catapulted the Cardinal to a 42-21 half
time lead over the Bruins. UCLA played better in the second
half, but the Cardinal still won comfortably, clearing its bench
and playing 14 players. Forward Justin Davis made his first
nine shots and finished with 21 points and five offensive re
bounds for the Cardinal, while Thompson was the only Bruin
in double figures. Thompson scored 15 points on 6-of-14
shooting, although he did not tally a single rebound or assist.
Farmer, one of the Pac-10's most exciting and excitable
players, brought his full intensity to Saturday's contest,
sparking an impressive, lightning-quick Trojan defense and
knocked down some tough jumpers as USC played perhaps
the best half of any Stanford opponent this year. But in the
second half, Stanford turned the Trojans' pressuring tactics
against them, pushing the ball upcourt for easy baskets in tran
sition before USC could settle into its defensive sets.
Nick Robinson had 13 points all in the second half
and ran the Trojans ragged. Chris Hernandez added 18 on just
six shots, hitting 3-of-3 three-pointers while dishing out 7 as
sists. Farmer led USC with 19 points, while the usually pro
ductive McMillan the Pac-10's runaway leader in field
goal percentage was neutralized, garnering just two points
on l-of-4 shooting while committing five turnovers and four
fouls in 26 minutes.
No. 9 Arizona asserted its status as the Pac-10's second
best team with a pair of convincing home wins that helped it
jump back into the top ten this week. The Wildcats entered
the weekend ranked No. 14, but ran roughshod over Oregon
State (8-9,2-5), 109-75, on Thursday and thrashed Oregon (9-

first time all season and moved into fourth place in the Pac-10.
Cal (8-8,4-3 Pac-10) edged Southern California (8-9,3-4),
63-62, on Thursday, and then knocked off fading UCLA (9-6,

Desmon Farmer's 17-point effort. The game came down to

two late free throws.
Saturday saw a tired UCLA squad, fresh off its loss to Stan
ford, fall handily to the Bears. Powe had 19 points and 14
boards despite shooting just 7-of-16 from the free-throw line
