# Cordell bill advances
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON STAFF WRITER 
The California Senate narrowly
approved a bill on Monday that
would allow Vice Provost for Cam
pus Relations LaDoris Cordell to sit
on the Palo Alto city council without
disrupting business between Stan
ford and the city.
In order to become law, the bill
must now be passed by the Assem
bly and signed by the governor.
Section 1090 of the government
code has inhibited business negotia
tions between Stanford and Palo
Alto since Cordell took her seat Jan.

1 because it forbids city councils
from negotiating contracts with a
corporation for which a council
member works. Stanford does not
fall under the exemption to the law
made for nonprofit organizations, as
was originally thought, since the
University is set up as a trust.
The bill, introduced earlier this
month by state Sen. Byron Sher, al
ters that exemption so that it in
cludes trusts that operate as non
profits, such as Stanford.
Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham,
along with others representing Stan
ford and Palo Alto, attended hear
ings on the bill held by the state
Senate's Local Government Com
mittee two weeks ago.
The bill narrowly passed with
two thirds, or 28, of the vote, re
ceiving only one more vote than
necessary.
According to Beecham, the bill
will now be sent to the Rules Com
mittee of the State Assembly.
From there, Beecham expects it to
go to the Local Government Com
mittee.
Until the situation can be re
solved, the city council has simply
opted to hold off on negotiating
any contracts with Stanford. Even
though there are many ongoing
contractual negotiations between
the city and Stanford, dealing with
everything from the Stanford
Shopping Center to Marguerite
bus schedules, none was so press
ing that it could not be put on hold
for at least the first quarter of this
fiscal year.
