# Conference fails to gain national reputation
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After three weeks of Pacific 10 Con
ference women's basketball play, things
were shaping up to be a one-team race.
No. 8 Stanford (15-3, 8-1 Pac-10) was
rolling over opponents by a margin of al
most 20 points per game, leaving oppos
ing players and coaches at a loss as to
how they could compete with the Cardi
nal.
And when Stanford demolished Ari
zona (16-4, 8-1), one of only two other
Pac-10 teams that had been able to crack
the top 25 and the team picked to finish
second in the conference, it looked as
though preseason talk of big things com
ing from the perennially weak Pac-10
Conference was just that talk. It
seemed almost inevitable that the Cardi
nal would sail though the rest of its
schedule, entirely unchallenged until
NCAA Tournament time.
However, things took a dramatic turn
just the next week. Cal put up a tough
fight, but would eventually succumb to
Stanford's deadly outside shooting and
the outstanding play of senior forward
Nicole Powell.
The following Friday, Stanford was
pushed to overtime by UCLA (9-9,4-5),
but was saved by Powell who is mak
ing a serious run at National Player of the
Year honors in what was considered by
almost every critic in the country to be a
two-player race between Connecticut's
Diana Taurasi and Duke's Alana Beard.
The Cardinal's luck would soon run
out though. On Sunday, it met its match
in a young and talented Southern Cali
fornia squad (10-7,7-2). The Trojans or
chestrated a balanced attack, led by se
nior Ebony Hoffman and eked out a 59-
56 comeback victory that left Stanford in
an unfamiliar position wondering
what went so wrong that it dropped a
very winnable game to an unranked con

ference foe.
The recent stumblings of the Cardinal
then begs the question is Stanford just
experiencing a midseason slump? Or
maybe that preseason talk of a deeper,
more talented Pac-10 had some merit.
After all, TJSC did almost pull off a
huge upset over then-No. 1 UConn, only
to squander a 15 point lead. Washington
(11-7,4-5) nearly upset then-No. 4 Texas
Tech, only to give up the go-ahead bas
ket with 11 seconds on the clock. Then-
No. 8 Purdue escaped UCLA by just one
point on a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds
on the clock. And before Oregon lost
star-forward Catherine Kraayeveld to a
season-ending ACL tear, it schooled
then-No. 9 LSU, 76-67.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves more re
spect.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves to send
more than two teams to NCAAs.
And while there's no doubt that Stan
ford would benefit from a stronger con
ference reputation, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer realizes that it hasn't
done enough to prove itself in recent
years.
"I think the Pac-10 has hurt itself with
close games, but not winning them. Also,
not doing that well in the NCAA Tour
nament."
As it stands now, the lack of recogni
tion for programs such as USC, Arizona,
Arizona State and Washington puts an
unfair amount of pressure on Stanford.
One or two off-nights during conference
play can spell disaster for the Cardinal's
NCAA Tournament seeding.
While the Trojans' weekend upset
was nothing for Stanford to be happy
about, it certainly makes the Pac-10 race
more interesting.
At the mid-season mark, the Cardinal
now shares first place with Arizona, who
took care of business at the Oregon
