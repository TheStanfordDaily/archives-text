# Conference fails to gain national reputation
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After three weeks of Pacific 10 Con
ference women's basketball play, things
were shaping up to be a one-team race.
No. 8 Stanford (15-3, 8-1 Pac-10) was
rolling over opponents by a margin of al
most 20 points per game, leaving oppos
ing players and coaches at a loss as to
how they could compete with the Cardi
nal.
And when Stanford demolished Ari
zona (16-4, 8-1), one of only two other
Pac-10 teams that had been able to crack
the top 25 and the team picked to finish
second in the conference, it looked as
though preseason talk of big things com
ing from the perennially weak Pac-10
Conference was just that talk. It
seemed almost inevitable that the Cardi
nal would sail though the rest of its
schedule, entirely unchallenged until
NCAA Tournament time.
However, things took a dramatic turn
just the next week. Cal put up a tough
fight, but would eventually succumb to
Stanford's deadly outside shooting and
the outstanding play of senior forward
Nicole Powell.
The following Friday, Stanford was
pushed to overtime by UCLA (9-9,4-5),
but was saved by Powell who is mak
ing a serious run at National Player of the
Year honors in what was considered by
almost every critic in the country to be a
two-player race between Connecticut's
Diana Taurasi and Duke's Alana Beard.
The Cardinal's luck would soon run
out though. On Sunday, it met its match
in a young and talented Southern Cali
fornia squad (10-7,7-2). The Trojans or
chestrated a balanced attack, led by se
nior Ebony Hoffman and eked out a 59-
56 comeback victory that left Stanford in
an unfamiliar position wondering
what went so wrong that it dropped a
very winnable game to an unranked con

ference foe.
The recent stumblings of the Cardinal
then begs the question is Stanford just
experiencing a midseason slump? Or
maybe that preseason talk of a deeper,
more talented Pac-10 had some merit.
After all, TJSC did almost pull off a
huge upset over then-No. 1 UConn, only
to squander a 15 point lead. Washington
(11-7,4-5) nearly upset then-No. 4 Texas
Tech, only to give up the go-ahead bas
ket with 11 seconds on the clock. Then-
No. 8 Purdue escaped UCLA by just one
point on a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds
on the clock. And before Oregon lost
star-forward Catherine Kraayeveld to a
season-ending ACL tear, it schooled
then-No. 9 LSU, 76-67.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves more re
spect.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves to send
more than two teams to NCAAs.
And while there's no doubt that Stan
ford would benefit from a stronger con
ference reputation, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer realizes that it hasn't
done enough to prove itself in recent
years.
"I think the Pac-10 has hurt itself with
close games, but not winning them. Also,
not doing that well in the NCAA Tour
nament."
As it stands now, the lack of recogni
tion for programs such as USC, Arizona,
Arizona State and Washington puts an
unfair amount of pressure on Stanford.
One or two off-nights during conference
play can spell disaster for the Cardinal's
NCAA Tournament seeding.
While the Trojans' weekend upset
was nothing for Stanford to be happy
about, it certainly makes the Pac-10 race
more interesting.
At the mid-season mark, the Cardinal
now shares first place with Arizona, who
took care of business at the Oregon

schools, defeating the Ducks, 70-66,
and downing the Beavers, 65-54. Ju
nior guard Dee-Dee Wheeler poured
in 22 points against Oregon before
fouling out and sophomore center
Shawntinice Polk led the way against
Oregon State with a double-double
of 20 points and 13 boards.
The Trojans are just one game be

hind after completing a weekend
sweep by overwhelming a grieving
California squad, whose reserve for
ward Alisa Lewis tragically died
from bacterial meningitis just four
days prior to the USC-Cal matchup.
Arizona State is continuing to
look strong, bouncing back from last
week's loss to USC with victories
over Oregon State and Oregon, 63-
56 and 69-67, respectively.
Stanford, USC, Arizona and Ari
zona State have clearly separated
themselves from the rest of the pack
with exactly half of conference play

remaining. But Washington, led by
reigning Conference Player of the
Year, Giuliana Mendiola, has the tal
ent to play spoiler after an extremely
disappointing start to the season.
And until those teams can rise to
the challenge and pull out wins in
non-conference action instead of set
tling for heart-breaking losses and
the knowledge that they can compete
with the best, Stanford will remain
the team that everybody is gunning
for night in and night out and
every game will remain an absolute
must-win.

Arizona State is continuing to
look strong, bouncing back from last
week's loss to USC with victories
over Oregon State and Oregon, 63-
56 and 69-67, respectively.
Stanford, USC, Arizona and Ari
zona State have clearly separated
themselves from the rest of the pack
with exactly half of conference play

remaining. But Washington, led by
reigning Conference Player of the
Year, Giuliana Mendiola, has the tal
ent to play spoiler after an extremely
disappointing start to the season.
And until those teams can rise to
the challenge and pull out wins in
non-conference action instead of set
tling for heart-breaking losses and
the knowledge that they can compete
with the best, Stanford will remain
the team that everybody is gunning
for night in and night out and
every game will remain an absolute
must-win.
After three weeks of Pacific 10 Con
ference women's basketball play, things
were shaping up to be a one-team race.
No. 8 Stanford (15-3, 8-1 Pac-10) was
rolling over opponents by a margin of al
most 20 points per game, leaving oppos
ing players and coaches at a loss as to
how they could compete with the Cardi
nal.
And when Stanford demolished Ari
zona (16-4, 8-1), one of only two other
Pac-10 teams that had been able to crack
the top 25 and the team picked to finish
second in the conference, it looked as
though preseason talk of big things com
ing from the perennially weak Pac-10
Conference was just that talk. It
seemed almost inevitable that the Cardi
nal would sail though the rest of its
schedule, entirely unchallenged until
NCAA Tournament time.
However, things took a dramatic turn
just the next week. Cal put up a tough
fight, but would eventually succumb to
Stanford's deadly outside shooting and
the outstanding play of senior forward
Nicole Powell.
The following Friday, Stanford was
pushed to overtime by UCLA (9-9,4-5),
but was saved by Powell who is mak
ing a serious run at National Player of the
Year honors in what was considered by
almost every critic in the country to be a
two-player race between Connecticut's
Diana Taurasi and Duke's Alana Beard.
The Cardinal's luck would soon run
out though. On Sunday, it met its match
in a young and talented Southern Cali
fornia squad (10-7,7-2). The Trojans or
chestrated a balanced attack, led by se
nior Ebony Hoffman and eked out a 59-
56 comeback victory that left Stanford in
an unfamiliar position wondering
what went so wrong that it dropped a
very winnable game to an unranked con

ference foe.
The recent stumblings of the Cardinal
then begs the question is Stanford just
experiencing a midseason slump? Or
maybe that preseason talk of a deeper,
more talented Pac-10 had some merit.
After all, TJSC did almost pull off a
huge upset over then-No. 1 UConn, only
to squander a 15 point lead. Washington
(11-7,4-5) nearly upset then-No. 4 Texas
Tech, only to give up the go-ahead bas
ket with 11 seconds on the clock. Then-
No. 8 Purdue escaped UCLA by just one
point on a three-pointer with 1.8 seconds
on the clock. And before Oregon lost
star-forward Catherine Kraayeveld to a
season-ending ACL tear, it schooled
then-No. 9 LSU, 76-67.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves more re
spect.
Maybe the Pac-10 deserves to send
more than two teams to NCAAs.
And while there's no doubt that Stan
ford would benefit from a stronger con
ference reputation, Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer realizes that it hasn't
done enough to prove itself in recent
years.
"I think the Pac-10 has hurt itself with
close games, but not winning them. Also,
not doing that well in the NCAA Tour
nament."
As it stands now, the lack of recogni
tion for programs such as USC, Arizona,
Arizona State and Washington puts an
unfair amount of pressure on Stanford.
One or two off-nights during conference
play can spell disaster for the Cardinal's
NCAA Tournament seeding.
While the Trojans' weekend upset
was nothing for Stanford to be happy
about, it certainly makes the Pac-10 race
more interesting.
At the mid-season mark, the Cardinal
now shares first place with Arizona, who
took care of business at the Oregon
