# UCLA fills final vacancy on football coaching staff
## 
### JESSICA BACH DAILY BRUIN (U. CALIFORNIA-LOS ANGELES 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES The UCLA foot
ball team announced Monday it has filled its last re
maining coaching vacancy with the hiring of Dino
Babers as wide receivers specialist.
Last season Babers served as the running backs
coach for the University of Pittsburgh after spending
two years at Texas A&M as the offensive coordina
tor and quarterbacks coach.
"Dino has coached in most of the major confer
ences and brings 17 years of full-time coaching expe
rience to our staff," coach Karl Dorrell said in a state
ment. "He has worked with all of the skill posi
tions, giving him a great feel for all aspects of an of
fense. Most of his experience is at the wide receiver
position, and that's where we will use him."
With the addition of Babers, last season's re
ceivers coach Jon Embree will switch to help the
tight ends a position at which he played and
coached during his tenure at Colorado.
The football staff will now have four coaches who
have offensive coordinating experience, a position
that has yet to be solidified in the offseason: Babers,
Dorrell, offensive line coach Tom Cable and current
offensive coordinator Steve Axman. While Axman
has remained both coordinator and quarterbacks
coach, Dorrell has hinted that changes could be
made.
Dorrell also announced that defensive line coach
Don Johnson will assume the duties of recruiting co

ordinator, taking over for the recently fired Gary
Bernardi.
Prep Quarterback Verbally Commits to UCLA
Last Friday, UCLA secured a verbal commitment
from quarterback Pat Cowan of St. John Bosco
High, giving the Bruins a desperately needed prep
quarterback.
Prior to Cowan's commitment, UCLA had
missed out on many more highly regarded prep quar
terback prospects, including Matt Tuiasosopo,
Rocky Hinds and Erik Ainge. All had originally ex
pressed interest in coming to Westwood, but eventu
ally decided against it.
Left with few other options, the Bruins turned
their attention to Cowan, the younger brother of cur
rent Bruin freshman receiver Joe Cowan. The 6-
foot-4, 197-pound senior chose UCLA over Idaho
and Sacramento State, and cancelled his scheduled
recruiting visit to Arizona after committing to the
Bruins.
Starting only in his senior season, Cowan led
Bosco to a 7-4 record, completing 92-of-197 passes
for 1,101 yards and five touchdowns.
While Cowan's commitment will give the Bru
ins needed depth at quarterback, his potential
will most likely be realized in the long term. Cur
rent starter Drew Olson still has two years of eli
gibility left, and UCLA has already received a
verbal commitment from junior college transfer
David Koral.
