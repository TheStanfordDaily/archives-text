# Journalist discusses violence in Israel
## 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Herb Keinon, a journalist and
diplomatic correspondent for The
Jerusalem Post spoke in Tresidder
Union's South Cypress room last
night about Israeli paranoia over re
cent violence.
Keinon, an American citizen
who is a current resident of a town
just outside Jerusalem, talked
about a widespread Israeli fear of
terrorist attacks and an Israeli call
for heightened security. Keinon
proposed that this fear, combined
with widespread public skepticism
of Israel, has had a strong influence
in shaping Israel's policies toward
its own security.
Keinon began his talk by de
scribing cultural differences.
"One of the main themes neces

sary to understand conflict in the
Middle East is to get a sense of what
living there is like ... it's a different
story living in the country," Keinon
said.
A husband and father of four
children, Keinon spent the first
third of his talk illustrating that per
spective. He explained that he has
to restrict his children's freedom by
not letting his 15- and 10-year-old
sons explore, and that he has to
shelter his children from the media
because he wants to keep them
away from "gore and fears."
"I'm a newspaperman who
doesn't allow his children to see the
paper with news of an attack, and I
don't want my kids to watch the
news because it creates fears,"
Keinon said.
Keinon reinforced throughout
his speech that Israelis' exposure to

"terrcfr happening at home," com
bined with the influence of the
media, causes them to demand
higher security in the form of securi
ty fences and road blockings, which
some people feel comes at the sacri
fice of human rights.
"Why does the nation tolerate
[fewer human rights]?" Keinon
asked. "It's the perception that
there are genuinely frightening,
gruesome and horrible things hap
pening just outside the door and
sometimes inside the door."
Keinon explained that some
measures, such as security fences,
even run against what Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon would like, but that
he is forced to tolerate them when
the public clamors for something
following an attack.
