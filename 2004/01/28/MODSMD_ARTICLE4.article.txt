# Journalist discusses violence in Israel
## 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Herb Keinon, a journalist and
diplomatic correspondent for The
Jerusalem Post spoke in Tresidder
Union's South Cypress room last
night about Israeli paranoia over re
cent violence.
Keinon, an American citizen
who is a current resident of a town
just outside Jerusalem, talked
about a widespread Israeli fear of
terrorist attacks and an Israeli call
for heightened security. Keinon
proposed that this fear, combined
with widespread public skepticism
of Israel, has had a strong influence
in shaping Israel's policies toward
its own security.
Keinon began his talk by de
scribing cultural differences.
"One of the main themes neces

sary to understand conflict in the
Middle East is to get a sense of what
living there is like ... it's a different
story living in the country," Keinon
said.
A husband and father of four
children, Keinon spent the first
third of his talk illustrating that per
spective. He explained that he has
to restrict his children's freedom by
not letting his 15- and 10-year-old
sons explore, and that he has to
shelter his children from the media
because he wants to keep them
away from "gore and fears."
"I'm a newspaperman who
doesn't allow his children to see the
paper with news of an attack, and I
don't want my kids to watch the
news because it creates fears,"
Keinon said.
Keinon reinforced throughout
his speech that Israelis' exposure to

"terrcfr happening at home," com
bined with the influence of the
media, causes them to demand
higher security in the form of securi
ty fences and road blockings, which
some people feel comes at the sacri
fice of human rights.
"Why does the nation tolerate
[fewer human rights]?" Keinon
asked. "It's the perception that
there are genuinely frightening,
gruesome and horrible things hap
pening just outside the door and
sometimes inside the door."
Keinon explained that some
measures, such as security fences,
even run against what Prime Minis
ter Ariel Sharon would like, but that
he is forced to tolerate them when
the public clamors for something
following an attack.
The other major perspective that
Keinon described was that of other
countries, specifically anti-semitism
in some European nations, a dis
trust of Israel as a state by the Unit
ed Nations and a friendly and sup
portive perspective from the United
States.
Keinon said he thinks negative
perspectives make "Israel think the
world is against them" and that
these feelings lead to a sense of iso
lation, strangulation and, ultimate
ly, make Israel "reluctant to take
steps toward peace."
Thus, Keinon concluded percep
tions from outside and from within
Israel make it hard for leaders like
Ariel Sharon to make foreign policy

decisions, in particular, regarding
land settlement agreements.
Sophomore Jordan Miller said he
appreciated Keinon's perspective.
"It was a really valuable talk as it
came from a journalist's perspec
tive, rather than a politician's,"
Miller said. "It was neat to hear how
the media interprets the conflict
and how they present it to the lay
people, the everyday citizens who
listen to it on the radio or read it in
the paper."
Miller also found it interesting
when Keinon spoke about an in
stance when Sharon, in the couple
of weeks immediately preceding
elections, used a conference at
which he was supposed to talk
about public scandal to discuss his
campaign.
"To actually hear a journalist say
that he was used was surprising and
ironic," Miller said. "It justified that
the media's portrayal of events and

of politics can be skewed and is
skewed, as this journalist spoke of
being manipulated."
Sophomore Michael Rosen ex
pressed agreement that the media
plays a significant and sometimes
troublesome role because public
perception of events and policies is
strongly influenced by what is read
in newspapers and what is seen on
television.
"The media has so much sway on
things, like the way they blew Dean
out of the water after a relatively
minor slip-up," Rosen said. "I don't
trust the media to shape the way the
public perceives world affairs. I
think they have their own interests
and thus can't remain objective."
Keinon's talk was sponsored by
the Stanford Israel Alliance and
co-sponsored by Israel Center of
San Francisco, Israel Center of the
Greater East Bay and Stanford
Hillel.
