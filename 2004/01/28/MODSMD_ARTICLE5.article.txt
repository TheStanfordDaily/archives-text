# Senate addresses special fee problem
## 
### MORGAN SPRINGER DEPARTING DESK EDITOR 
Special fees and senatorial resig
nation dominated last night's meet
ing of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate as senators dealt with rapid
ly rising special fee refunds, and
sophomore senators Shyam Ravin
dran and Jason Sinocruz explained
their divergent reasons for leaving
the ASSU.
The lengthy Senate session fo
cused on a report by Kyle Alisharan,
the ASSU financial manager, of the
findings of the special fees commit
tee. According to Alisharan, refund
rates have spiked this year from 6.5
percent in fall 2002 to 14.1 percent in
fall 2003, and could reach rates of up
to 25 percent by the end of the year.
He added, though, that there was
no need for panic.
"It's happened before, we caught

it early, and we've been spending an
incredible amount of time on this
issue," he said.
Special fee refunds are paid out of
a buffer that is set up to absorb a re
fund rate of 8 percent (the average
over the last five years). Were the
current rates to continue unad
dressed, groups would no longer re
ceive their full budget.
The special fees committee re
ported that the increase in the un
dergraduate fee from $56 to $9O in
the past four years, due to the ex
panding number of groups, may be a
major contributor to the problem.
This idea was echoed by Assis
tant Dean of Students Nanci Howe.
"I think the basic philosophy of
the special fees have changed," she
said. "They were intended to be
broad-based groups that serve large
portions of the student population.
There used to be only 12 to 15 groups

on the ballot."
Other issues cited include voters
who view the refunds as free money,
even if they voted in favor of the stu
dent group. This is a split from the
past, when refunds were meant to
address ideological issues.
The special fees committee pro
posed that, in the short term, a limit
be placed on the amount of refunds
paid from the buffer, with remaining
refunds paid out of a group's re
serves. Another suggestion was to
reclaim inactive group reserves.
Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior,
noted that this approach might not
work for newer groups with fewer
reserves.
"We're not too interested in mak
ing debt," he said.
As for long-term solutions, the
committee suggested more stringent
requirements to place groups on the bal
lot so as to lower fees, as well as more ed
ucation on the voting and refund sites as
to what refunds mean and how they im
pact groups.
Two senators resign
A separate issue on the agenda was
that of the two resigning senators.
Ravindran explained that he took the
quarter off to work on a research pro
ject.
"I quickly found out that as a non
registered student you can't participate
in extracurriculars," he explained.
Ravindran plans to return as a regis
tered student spring quarter and offered
his help with any ongoing Senate pro
jects despite his technical resignation.

Sinocruz offered far more detail in
his resignation speech. He began by
praising the leadership of the Senate and
explaining that he had thought in detail
about his resignation.
"To say that I've completely enjoyed
my past two quarters as an ASSU sena
tor would be a lie," he said. "Recently I
read Chris' comments in The Daily
about only granting a leave of absence in
an 'extraordinarily special case,' and I
agree 100 percent with his thoughts. It is
thus with a strange mixture of regret, joy
and liberation that I am officially step
ping down from the ASSU Senate this
evening."
Sinocruz explained that he was un
sure as to what the Senate accom
plished.
"I asked myself another question
if the Undergraduate Senate were to dis
appear from Stanford, what would be
the loss to campus?" he continued.
"Aside from not having a body to ap
propriate funds to different student
groups, an aspect of Senate that I think

is crucially important, I could not come
up with any definite, concrete answer to
my own question."
Sinocruz also suggested that there is a
"gap between the Senate and the under
graduate population that it serves," and
that, due to this gap, he's often found
"our work, at times, to be unfocused and
even bordering on trivial." He proposed
the need for a new mechanism to enable
communication between students and
the Senate.
Finally, Sinocruz explained that he
lacked passion for his position.
"Many times, I felt just like a busy
body pushing papers," he said.
He closed by entreating future sena
tors to "answer the questions still lack
ing and evaded by the Undergraduate
Senate today."
Upon the end of Sinocruz's oration,
Ravindran added a clarification.
"Me and Jason leaving at the same
time is just a coincidence. I respect his
views, but I disagree with them," Ravin
dran said.
