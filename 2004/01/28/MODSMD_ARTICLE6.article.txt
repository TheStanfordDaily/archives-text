# Philosophy profs host new radio show
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Philosophy Profs. John
Perry and Kenneth Taylor recently
began their radio show,
"Philoso?hy Talk," which has al
ready attracted the attention of The
New York Times Magazine and Lu
casfilm, Ltd.
The live show, which airs Tues
days at noon on the San Francisco
public radio station KALW, aims to
serve as an alternative forum for dis
cussing issues of contemporary soci
ety such as race, marriage and poli
tics. Perry and Taylor hope to bring
the method of philosophical dis
course to the general public to en
able others to think more deeply
about the issues surrounding them,
according to Perry.
"We try to be calm, reasonable
and we try to get down to basic con
cepts, as opposed to shouting at
each other," Perry said. "The more
[people] find out about the con
cepts and principles that underlie
their thinking, often the less sure
they are about their own opinions."
"Philoso?hy Talk" was origi
nally the brainchild of Perry, who
became inspired to do the show
when he first heard "Car Talk,"
the popular radio show that NPR
made national in the 'Bos. Howev
er, it was not until he teamed up
with Taylor that the two were able
to make his idea into a reality.
With the help of acclaimed radio
producer Ben Manilla, Perry and
Taylor began their first live, regular
airing of the show on Jan. 13. Pro
moted as "the program that ques
tions everything ... except your in
telligence," the show has a laid-back
tone.
"Ken and I like to think about
ourselves down at Stanford, at Phi
losophy Corner, with a couple of
friends and maybe a few brewskis
under a tree," said Perry in the in
troduction to yesterday's show.
Although the program often

deals with serious issues, asking
questions about whether race is a so
cial construct and if pre-emptive na
tional self-defense is a legitimate
policy, the hosts often inject humor
into their treatments of these ques
tions. Thus, the show's features of
lan Shoales as "The One Minute
Philosopher" and Amy Standen as
"the roving philosophical reporter"
are in line with the professors' own
opinions about philosophy.
"Philosophy is fun," Taylor said.
"And people are fun to talk to."
A feature on the show is sched
uled to appear in the next issue of
The New York Times Magazine. In
addition, the production company
Lucasfilm Ltd. recently filmed the

show to include as bonus material in
the "Indiana Jones" series, to ex
plain a scene in which a young Indi
ana Jones meets Aristotle.
KALW's station manager,
Nicole Sawaya, was also enthusias
tic about the success of "Philoso?hy
Talk," citing positive reviews from
both listeners of the show and from
other radio hosts.
"John and Ken are naturals," she
said. "They are funny and witty, and
we are thrilled at this collaboration.
I'm hoping that it's the beginning of
a relationship with the Stanford
brain trust."
Yet with all of the show's suc
cess, Perry and Taylor are, at the
moment, doing the radio show for

free, without charging the station
for their program. Because
KALW is a public station, the two
must make efforts to raise their
own funds from outside founda
tions and from the University it
self.
"It's a labor of love at this point,"
Perry said, but he and Taylor hope
that their situation will change soon.
"The University has been really
generous, but it hasn't been nearly
enough," Taylor said. "We're hop
ing that as the number of listeners
grows, more [funding] will follow."
Until then, he said, the two hosts
will continue to do the show for "as
long as people want to listen and as
long as we want to talk."
