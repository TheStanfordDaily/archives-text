## Iowa State S&M club under investigation 
### TOM BARTON IOWA STATE DAILY 
(U-WIRE) AMES, lowa
lowa State University's investigation
into a campus bondage and sado
masochism club, which has put an in
terim suspension on the group's ac
tivities, is ongoing, leaving the fate of
the group in the air.
Cuffs president Harlan "Duane"
Long Jr., senior in psychology, said
he was confident after talking with
Bethany Schuttinga, director of judi
cial affairs and head of the investiga
tion, the investigation would be fin
ished in time for the group to hold its
first meeting of the semester. How
ever, the investigation is still pro
ceeding, much to his disappointment,
Long said.
Following a meeting Friday, Long
said Schuttinga informed him Cuffs
would not be allowed to meet for its
first meeting, which was scheduled
for Monday, because Judicial Affairs
still needs to gather information.
"I'm very disappointed with the
university's decision to continue the
investigation and not allowing Cuffs

to hold its first meeting Monday,"
Long said. "I've done everything
they've asked, and I've provided
them with all the information I can.
I'm not sure what else they want or
what Ms. Schuttinga is looking for."
Cuffs, a campus organization
whose mission is to educate the cam
pus about sadomasochism, promote
safety and create a safe community
for those who practice S&M, has
been investigated by the university
because of concern about demon
strations performed at a Cuffs meet
ing Nov. 10.
The investigation was prompted
by the Dec. 15 Daily article "Pain and
Pleasure: The stigma over Cuffs
hurts community," which described
Long demonstrating on another
member how to properly use S&M
toys.
Schuttinga said officials in the Ju
dicial Affairs and Dean of Students
Office were concerned the group vi
olated Student Disciplinary Regula
tions by hitting a person during the
demonstration.
Schuttinga said Cuffs has not been
accused of violating any of the disci

plinary regulations, but could be ac
cused if the investigation finds there
have been violations. She declined to
comment on to which regulations
might have been violated. "We don't
release disciplinary action taken
against any individual or student
group," Schuttinga said.
Cuffs is under an interim suspen
sion, which prohibits them from
holding meetings, spending the orga
nization's money and asking for allo
cation of funds.
Schuttinga said she is "unable to
confirm or deny" a suspension has
been placed on Cuffs. However,
Long said the group has been put on
interim suspension.
Long said the meeting with Schut
tinga didn't provide a substantial dia
logue or information on how long the
investigation will continue.
"At this point, there's not much
we can do about it. We just have to
wait for the investigation to con
clude. Until [Schuttinga] completed
the investigation, we have to remain
on interim suspension." he said. "It's
frustrating because she didn't com
ment on anything more that I could

do on my end to facilitate the investi
gation."
Long said if members have to wait
too long, they will look elsewhere for
a place to go.
"My primary concern is the com
mitment of the members wavering as
the fate of the group is now uncer
tain. I'd really hate for it to take so
long that after weeks and weeks,
we're finally able to meet, but half of
the members have left," Long said.
"Missing one meeting won't do any
significant damage to the group, it's
the worry that we can't meet until
March or April, which will have a
detrimental effect on the group.'"
After taking last year off, Long
said the group had assured people it
would, but with the recent suspen
sion, the issue of continuity has been
called back into question.
"I'm confident the university is
just trying to perform a thorough in
vestigation," he said. "If the universi
ty finds we have violated a regula
tion, I would want to know how we
are different than those groups on
campus where there's physical con
tact and the potential for harm."
