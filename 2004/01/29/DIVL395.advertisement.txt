WILD CIVILITY
:
DAVID BIESPIEL
■:i;t;.: , '
David Biespiel teaches
English at Oregon State
University and is Writer
in Residence at The Attic
in Portland, Oregon.
His honors include a
Stegner Fellowship in
Poetry and the National
Endowment for the Arts
Fellowship in Literature.
He is also the author of
Shattering Air.
David Biespiel's long
poetic lines crackle with
rhythmic energy and
a jazzy, bittersweet
richness of language.
Rolling out across
the page like darkly
luminous highways, his
innovative, nine-line
"American sonnets"
promise adventure,
offering a variant on the
sonnet form that is both
lyric and dramatic and
bringing his masterful
formal inventiveness to
free verse.
