## Women try to rebound from SC loss 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a heartbreaking 59-56 loss to
Southern California last Sunday, the No. 8 Stan
ford women's basketball team (15-3,8-1 Pacific-10
Conference) is now locked in a tie atop the Pac-10
with Arizona. But with the Washington schools
heading to Maples this weekend, the Cardinal has
a chance to get some breathing room from the
Wildcats.
Stanford faces a tough opponent today in the
Huskies (11-7,4-5), whose fifth-place standing in
the conference belies their scoring potential.
Washington is riding a three-game winning
streak, and is eager to deliver Stanford a second
straight loss. Further shake ups may be on the
way for the conference.
Although many of the Cardinal's top players
have put up impressive numbers, only senior for
ward Nicole Powell has consistently scored in her
double digits. She leads the Cardinal both in scor
ing (21.3 ppg) and rebounds (11.2 rpg), and in the
past she has stepped up her play against confer
ence opponents, averaging 24.7 points in Pac-10
games.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin continues to
show her potential, notching four blocks against
the Trojans.
Like Stanford, the Huskies are a strong perime
ter-shooting team. They rank second in the Pac-10
in three-point field goal percentage (.373) and lead
the conference in scoring (74.9 ppg). The Cardinal,
however, is limiting its opponents to a conference
heading 57.3 points per game.
"They are a very good perimeter shooting
team," said junior guard Kelley Suminski. "We're
concentrating especially on their posts that like to
come out and shoot."
Senior guard Giuliana Mendiola leads Wash
ington in both scoring (19.3) and rebounding (6.4).
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer felt
that Mendiola has not been as much of a threat this
season.
"She does a lot for their team," said Van-
Derveer. "She has to do more this year."
