# Putting it on the Line
## Women try to rebound from SC loss 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Coming off a heartbreaking 59-56 loss to
Southern California last Sunday, the No. 8 Stan
ford women's basketball team (15-3,8-1 Pacific-10
Conference) is now locked in a tie atop the Pac-10
with Arizona. But with the Washington schools
heading to Maples this weekend, the Cardinal has
a chance to get some breathing room from the
Wildcats.
Stanford faces a tough opponent today in the
Huskies (11-7,4-5), whose fifth-place standing in
the conference belies their scoring potential.
Washington is riding a three-game winning
streak, and is eager to deliver Stanford a second
straight loss. Further shake ups may be on the
way for the conference.
Although many of the Cardinal's top players
have put up impressive numbers, only senior for
ward Nicole Powell has consistently scored in her
double digits. She leads the Cardinal both in scor
ing (21.3 ppg) and rebounds (11.2 rpg), and in the
past she has stepped up her play against confer
ence opponents, averaging 24.7 points in Pac-10
games.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin continues to
show her potential, notching four blocks against
the Trojans.
Like Stanford, the Huskies are a strong perime
ter-shooting team. They rank second in the Pac-10
in three-point field goal percentage (.373) and lead
the conference in scoring (74.9 ppg). The Cardinal,
however, is limiting its opponents to a conference
heading 57.3 points per game.
"They are a very good perimeter shooting
team," said junior guard Kelley Suminski. "We're
concentrating especially on their posts that like to
come out and shoot."
Senior guard Giuliana Mendiola leads Wash
ington in both scoring (19.3) and rebounding (6.4).
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer felt
that Mendiola has not been as much of a threat this
season.
"She does a lot for their team," said Van-
Derveer. "She has to do more this year."
The Cardinal leads the series against the


BETH LIEBERT/The Stanford Daily
Huskies 26-13, but split with Wash
ington last year. With a 77-69 victory
in Husky territory under their belt, a
home win is a must for the Cardinal.
"Our team has got to come out
and play with a lot of pride," Van-
Derveer said. "We're going to have to

play very well defensively. We're
going to have to rebound well. They
have really improved their defense.
It'll be a challenge for our team. Our
team is confident knowing we have
beaten them and beaten them up
there."
Saturday's opponent Washing
ton State is currently at the cellar of
the Pac-10 with a 0-9 record this sea
son. The team is led by senior for
ward Bianca McCall with 157 points

and freshman forward Kate Benz
with 151.
The Cougars have never defeated
the Cardinal, who leads the series 37-
0, and pounded the Cougars 90-69 at
their first meeting this season.
When Powell sat out the game
against Washington State earlier this
month because of her injured ankle,
the rest of the team stepped up to fill
the void. Suminksi led the team with
22 points and 10 assists and Newlin
had eight blocks.
Given the team's ability to play
well without Powell, some players
seem to lose themselves when she is
back on the court. VanDerveer at
tributes it to the type of games the
team has to play.
"Some of it is a certain style that

you play against. If we play against
teams that extend their defense and
we have trouble passing and drib
bling, then it becomes the Nicole
Powell show," she said.
The Cardinal is not down by its
loss to the Women of Troy, viewing it
more as a motivation than a defeat.
"It's not the end of the world,"
VanDerveer said. "Because we have
the Pac-10, we learn to come back
and be hungry in the tournament."
"Sometimes losing allows you to
change. We will make the most of this
loss."
The offense never materialized
against pressure from the Trojans.
"We were never in good offensive
flow," VanDerveer said. "At Stanford,
the challenge is always to play against

pressure defense."
VanDerveer is not ignoring the dan
ger of funneling the offense through
Powell. "Our offense is too predictable
and too oriented around one person,"
she said.
She stressed the need for better of
fensive play overall, but especially in the
post positions with more inside play.
"It was a main problem against
Tennessee and all year long," she said.
"Our teams have been successful when
we have established a low block pres
ence since we have such good perime
ter shooters... We have to get our in
side game going. Chelsea [Trotter] was
a big part of that. Kristen was a big part
early on. We need T'Nae [Thiel] and
Azella [Perryman] and they're not 100
percent."

The whole team has been working to
improve and revamp the Cardinal offense.
a "I think we have come a long way,"
Suminksi said. "We have tweaked our
offense a bit. Everyone's working hard
trying to find what everyone's role is.
Right now, we're at stage where we're
trying to fix things and come up with new
things."
But the key to victory will be in
finding a balance between a solid
perimeter game and more action
under the basket.
"I think we need to get the ball in
side more to give them a chance to
score and improve their game," Sum
inski said. "They can't improve with
out the ball, and a focus is to get the

home win is a must for the Cardinal.
"Our team has got to come out
and play with a lot of pride," Van-
Derveer said. "We're going to have to

play very well defensively. We're
going to have to rebound well. They
have really improved their defense.
It'll be a challenge for our team. Our
team is confident knowing we have
beaten them and beaten them up
there."
Saturday's opponent Washing
ton State is currently at the cellar of
the Pac-10 with a 0-9 record this sea
son. The team is led by senior for
ward Bianca McCall with 157 points

and freshman forward Kate Benz
with 151.
The Cougars have never defeated
the Cardinal, who leads the series 37-
0, and pounded the Cougars 90-69 at
their first meeting this season.
When Powell sat out the game
against Washington State earlier this
month because of her injured ankle,
the rest of the team stepped up to fill
the void. Suminksi led the team with
22 points and 10 assists and Newlin
had eight blocks.
Given the team's ability to play
well without Powell, some players
seem to lose themselves when she is
back on the court. VanDerveer at
tributes it to the type of games the
team has to play.
"Some of it is a certain style that

you play against. If we play against
teams that extend their defense and
we have trouble passing and drib
bling, then it becomes the Nicole
Powell show," she said.
The Cardinal is not down by its
loss to the Women of Troy, viewing it
more as a motivation than a defeat.
"It's not the end of the world,"
VanDerveer said. "Because we have
the Pac-10, we learn to come back
and be hungry in the tournament."
"Sometimes losing allows you to
change. We will make the most of this
loss."
The offense never materialized
against pressure from the Trojans.
"We were never in good offensive
flow," VanDerveer said. "At Stanford,
the challenge is always to play against

pressure defense."
VanDerveer is not ignoring the dan
ger of funneling the offense through
Powell. "Our offense is too predictable
and too oriented around one person,"
she said.
She stressed the need for better of
fensive play overall, but especially in the
post positions with more inside play.
"It was a main problem against
Tennessee and all year long," she said.
"Our teams have been successful when
we have established a low block pres
ence since we have such good perime
ter shooters... We have to get our in
side game going. Chelsea [Trotter] was
a big part of that. Kristen was a big part
early on. We need T'Nae [Thiel] and
Azella [Perryman] and they're not 100
percent."

The whole team has been working to
improve and revamp the Cardinal offense.
a "I think we have come a long way,"
Suminksi said. "We have tweaked our
offense a bit. Everyone's working hard
trying to find what everyone's role is.
Right now, we're at stage where we're
trying to fix things and come up with new
things."
But the key to victory will be in
finding a balance between a solid
perimeter game and more action
under the basket.
"I think we need to get the ball in
side more to give them a chance to
score and improve their game," Sum
inski said. "They can't improve with
out the ball, and a focus is to get the
ball to our post more.
Coming off a heartbreaking 59-56 loss to
Southern California last Sunday, the No. 8 Stan
ford women's basketball team (15-3,8-1 Pacific-10
Conference) is now locked in a tie atop the Pac-10
with Arizona. But with the Washington schools
heading to Maples this weekend, the Cardinal has
a chance to get some breathing room from the
Wildcats.
Stanford faces a tough opponent today in the
Huskies (11-7,4-5), whose fifth-place standing in
the conference belies their scoring potential.
Washington is riding a three-game winning
streak, and is eager to deliver Stanford a second
straight loss. Further shake ups may be on the
way for the conference.
Although many of the Cardinal's top players
have put up impressive numbers, only senior for
ward Nicole Powell has consistently scored in her
double digits. She leads the Cardinal both in scor
ing (21.3 ppg) and rebounds (11.2 rpg), and in the
past she has stepped up her play against confer
ence opponents, averaging 24.7 points in Pac-10
games.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin continues to
show her potential, notching four blocks against
the Trojans.
Like Stanford, the Huskies are a strong perime
ter-shooting team. They rank second in the Pac-10
in three-point field goal percentage (.373) and lead
the conference in scoring (74.9 ppg). The Cardinal,
however, is limiting its opponents to a conference
heading 57.3 points per game.
"They are a very good perimeter shooting
team," said junior guard Kelley Suminski. "We're
concentrating especially on their posts that like to
come out and shoot."
Senior guard Giuliana Mendiola leads Wash
ington in both scoring (19.3) and rebounding (6.4).
Stanford Head Coach Tara VanDerveer felt
that Mendiola has not been as much of a threat this
season.
"She does a lot for their team," said Van-
Derveer. "She has to do more this year."
The Cardinal leads the series against the
