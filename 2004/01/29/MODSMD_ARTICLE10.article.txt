### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Novelist and biographer Geoffrey Wolff, brother of
Stanford English Prof. Tobias Wolff, read a chapter
from his unpublished novel yesterday evening in the
Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks Hall. The acclaimed
author of 10 works, both fiction and non-fiction, enter

writing process.
The Creative Writing Program sponsored the event.
Geoffrey Wolff is the Director of the Graduate Fic

clude: "The Art of Burning Bridges: A Life of John
O'Hara"; "Black Sun, The Duke of Deception," a mem

"The Age of Consent."

The inspiration for the story, according to Wolff,
came from an actual event in Rhode Island many years
