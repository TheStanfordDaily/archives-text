## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Novelist and biographer Geoffrey Wolff, brother of
Stanford English Prof. Tobias Wolff, read a chapter
from his unpublished novel yesterday evening in the
Terrace Room of Margaret Jacks Hall. The acclaimed
author of 10 works, both fiction and non-fiction, enter
tained the crowd and answered questions regarding the
writing process.
The Creative Writing Program sponsored the event.
Geoffrey Wolff is the Director of the Graduate Fic
tion Program at UC-Irvine. His works of nonfiction in
clude: "The Art of Burning Bridges: A Life of John
O'Hara"; "Black Sun, The Duke of Deception," a mem
oir; and "A Day at the Beach," a collection of personal
essays. He also has published six novels, most recently
"The Age of Consent."
Geoffrey Wolff was introduced by his brother Tobias,
who is the author of the acclaimed memoir "This Boy's
Life" and the recently published novel "Old School." To
bias Wolff described his brother as a guiding figure in his
childhood.
"Geoffrey was my first great teacher," Wolff said. "It
is nothing short of a miracle that we're both here as writ
ers today."

Geoffrey Wolff then read from a novel he is currently
working on.
At the beginning of the novel, a prize patrol arrives at
main character Red's door, only to find that they have the
wrong house.
The audience in the Terrace Room chuckled appre
ciatively as Wolff described his character dealing with a
suave computer salesman.
"You're not buying a computer, you're buying a fam
ily," said the salesman to Red, though the very next day
he refused to help Red set up his computer.
Wolff himself admitted to an incident with his com
puter a few days before.
"I jumped up and down on my last computer," he
said. "I removed some memory chips before it was
thrown in the trash, but otherwise, the gesture was im
peccable."
The inspiration for the story, according to Wolff,
came from an actual event in Rhode Island many years
ago. A man allegedly went into the investment busi
ness with his neighbor, cheated his neighbor of money
and ultimately ended up killing the neighbor and his
family.
Wolff explained that he wanted to look at the exem-
plary aspects of the situation and see
how small frustrations led to the
large, final act.
After a full round of applause
at the conclusion of his reading,
Wolff answered questions re
garding his works and writing in
general. When asked why, unlike
his brother, he didn't write short
stories, Wolff replied that he just
couldn't.
"I love to read short stories more
than anything else, but it's an art I
don't have. I talk too much," he said.
In response to the inquiry of how
friendly the current environment
was to new publishers, he replied
that it was better than ever.
"I think it's the best time it's ever
been to publish fiction," Geoffrey
Wolff said.
According to Virginia Hess, a
coordinator for the Creative Writ
ing Program, the event was in
tended to provide students with
the opportunity to hear acclaimed

writers.
"The Creative Writing Pro
gram often brings noted writers to
campus to offer students the op
portunity to be exposed to the
best in contemporary writing,"
she said.
Stanford students in attendance,
as well as faculty and other members
of the Stanford community, agreed
that the event was meaningful and
enjoyable.
Freshman Wilmot Yeh com
mented that the speaker's manner
created a comfortable and welcom
ing atmosphere.
"I think his manner and the way
he read, as well as some of the un
planned pauses, made it a very
down-to-earth presentation," he
said.
"I thought the event was really
amazing," said junior Mia Ashton.
"I'm currently taking a class with
Tobias Wolff, and it was really a
treat to hear his brother speak. A
lot of people in this room are writ
ing or English majors, and these
kinds of programs are a great way to
build community."

"The Creative Writing Pro
gram often brings noted writers to
campus to offer students the op
portunity to be exposed to the
best in contemporary writing,"
she said.
Stanford students in attendance,
as well as faculty and other members
of the Stanford community, agreed
that the event was meaningful and
enjoyable.
Freshman Wilmot Yeh com
mented that the speaker's manner
created a comfortable and welcom
ing atmosphere.
"I think his manner and the way
he read, as well as some of the un
planned pauses, made it a very
down-to-earth presentation," he
said.
"I thought the event was really
amazing," said junior Mia Ashton.
"I'm currently taking a class with
Tobias Wolff, and it was really a
treat to hear his brother speak. A
lot of people in this room are writ
ing or English majors, and these
kinds of programs are a great way to
build community."
