As the election approaches, candidates may
find increased interest among young voters, ac
cording to a recent survey that indicates politi
cal awareness among college students is at its
highest level since 1994.
Conducted by Higher Education Research
Institute at the University of California-Los
Angeles, the survey found that 33.9 percent of
students agreed that "keeping up to date with
political affairs" is a very important or essen
tial life goal. This is a 1 percent raise from last
year and a significant increase from 2000's
record low of 28.1 percent. The study surveyed
276,449 first-year students at 413 colleges and
universities.
At the University of Virginia, a variety of
student groups and individuals have been
preparing for the elections.
"I think people are interested this year,"
said Sean Moynahan, a member of Hoos for
Wesley Clark. "Some people are not happy
with the administration and want to see a
change."

Hoos for Clark is one. of many candidate
support groups that have developed around
campus this year. Moynahan said his group
plans to "do phone banking" and gear their
message toward students who are still undecid
ed.
The University Democrats has been in
volved in a variety of different election efforts,
such as campaigning in New Hampshire last
weekend and registering voters at the begin
ning of the school year.
"We were really successful at our first meet
ing this year," said Dave Wasserman, Univer
sity Democrats campaign and party coordina
tor and founder of Hoos for Howard Dean.
Wasserman added that University Democrats
have fostered an atmosphere of "cheerful ca
maraderie," as members concentrate on sup
porting the candidates of their choice.
"We anticipate as it gets closer to a very
competitive race and political year, political in
volvement in the general election will be on the
rise," Wasserman said.
Other students said they are less informed
about the upcoming primary but interested in
the presidential election.
"For this upcoming election I've definitely

become more interested in the issues," fourth
year student Celine Clark said. "I would like to
vote in the primary, but as an out-of-state stu
dent, I'm uniformed as to how it works. I prob
ably represent a good majority of students
here."
The UCLA survey also showed an increase
in students who identify themselves as conser
vative, up to 21.1 percent versus last year's 20
percent. Students identifying themselves as
liberal decreased to 24.2 percent, compared to
last year's 25.3 percent, while close to half of
respondents said their views were politically
moderate.
"Dennis Miller called it the 'common sense
revolution,"' College Republicans Vice-Chair
Ali Ahmad said. "Students are swinging to the
right from where their professors and parents
stand on issues."
Ahmad added that membership of the Col
lege Republicans has increased steadily in the
past three years.
Moynahan said it is uncertain whether
turnout will be similar to previous years.
"Our generation may not turn out to be any
different from the past, but we'll see," he said.
