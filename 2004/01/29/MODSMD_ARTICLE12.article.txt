## It ain't right to fight, so keep it light 
### 
I hate the F-word. The mere
whisper of it makes me cringe.
Bracing for impact, my body
tenses as my mind recalls the
countless hours wasted in such a
soulless, negative activity. Humans

choose such base
and vile pursuits to
fill their lives with.
It's sad.
Why must we
fight?
Why?
Why!!!
If you com
pared the number
of fights in your
average relation-

ship with the total number of wars
in modern history you'll find the
numbers aren't much different.
People have this annoying tenden
cy to see things from different per
spectives, and when these perspec
tives conflict, as they all too often
do, you get civil wars or, within the
genre of sex and relationships, the
dreaded 'fight.'
From the Clintons to the Ricar
dos, fights are the bahe of every re
lationship. Whether it was Lucy's
spending all her money on a blue hat
or Bill's staining the blue dress,
fights spontaneously erupt from
every orifice of a relationship (not
even going to touch that one). The
best we can do is deal with them in a
way that leaves the relationship as
strong, or stronger, than the way it
was before.
In the middle of the anger, frus
tration and outrage you feel when
fighting, you have to remember that
there's a reason you're both feeling
so strongly. You don't fight with
your co-worker or even your friends
in the same way you fight with your
mate. You don't feel that intensity of
emotion that makes it so extremely
unpleasant.
There are only two reasons you
both feel that passion and fight with
that vigor: You love each other or
you hate each other. If it's the latter,
ditch the bitch. If it's the former, re
member you're feeling so strongly
because you care so much.
Besides keeping in mind how
much you love the person and how
much they love you, when having a
domestic spat remember President
Bush's number one rule on giving
public appearances: Minimize the
damage. Don't add more argu
ments if you don't really need to.
Don't piss the other person off any
more than it takes to get your point
of view across. Why make life hard
er? Why hurt you lover more? A
loving relationship includes re
membering that you love them
when you're fighting, as well as
when you're not.
The second thing to remember
when fighting is to be fair. If you're
fighting about your boyfriend's
dancing with another girl, it's hardly
pertinent to bring up the fact that he
forgot your birthday last week, espe
cially when he had a good excuse.
It's similarly unfair to bring into the
argument things that don't really
upset you but that you can use
against the other person. You may
legitimately be able to say that he
snores in his sleep, but it's not legiti
mate to bring up if it doesn't bother
you. Remembering the first rule of
fighting, limit the argument. Other
wise you'll never stop fighting.
Let's be honest. It's not that easy
to keep a clear head when you're
mad beyond belief or hurting a great
deal. Obviously you're making
things worse by calling them a
"whore" or by bring up Bill, Ted or
Betty, but it can be next to impossi
ble to remember you love them as
much as you do when you're fighting
as hard as you are. In such extreme
fights there may be nothing you can
do to stop the fight. Instead of leav
ing the room madder than hell, hug
the person you love, tell them you
love them and, remembering that
you love them more than anything
you're fighting about, leave the fight
for the next day.
