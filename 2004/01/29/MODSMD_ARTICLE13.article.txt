# JAGGED LITTLE PILLS
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS STAFF WRITER 
You forget to set the alarm, you sleep though it, it doesn't matter. What does
matter is that you're an hour late for Poetry and Poetics, plus you have marks on
your forehead from conking out on your keyboard. But who can blame you? You
have two papers due this afternoon, 100 pages of reading to catch up on and much
more you have decided not to write down in your planner for fear of slipping into
a deep dark depression. Sleep seems like the last thing you need but your body begs
to differ. Where to turn?
Pills are a common answer. Caffeine and Ritalin lead the pack with Adderall and
even Vicodin close on their heels. An increasing number of college folk are turning
to drugs to squeeze the most out of their day. In 2000, the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration reported that 3.9 million people in the Unit
ed States regularly use prescription drugs for non-medical reasons. Just one year
later the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse estimated that, in 2001 alone,
7 million people between the ages of 18 and 25 used these drugs non-medically at
least once.
When copious amounts of coffee and Red Bull just don't do the trick, pills can
start to look like an easy answer.
Many such students see the word "prescription" as a stamp of approval on drugs
like OxyContin. Those who pop pills without a physician's instructions are always at
risk of taking too many at improper time intervals, a potentially fatal combination.
"Unfortunately, sometimes people think of prescription drugs as being safe be
cause you know the quantity, you know the quality, you know the intended pur
pose," says Priscilla Quirk, coordinator of a college substance abuse prevention
program.
Ritalin, said to enhance concentration and even enthusiasm, has become im
mensely popular among college students. Some have even been known to crush it and
snort it like some of its more illicit cousins. It has become the butt of many a campus
joke, as in "You're such a spazz, take your Ritalin." Few realize that when taken in
excess, it can cause chronic insomnia, headaches, loss of appetite, dizziness, long-term
tremors, anxiety, weight loss, vomiting, psychotic episodes and severe depression.
Accidental addiction is a major problem related to these drugs. While doctors
recommend doses designed so that people don't develop unhealthy dependence on

pills, they commonly hand out far more than people need. It's not rare that a stu
dent athlete will get injured and require Vicodin during recovery, but not ne.arly as
much as they are allotted.
While Ritalin and Caffeine are used to stay awake, more students use Vicodin to
relax during precious moments of down time. Some have described their experience
with the drug as a feeling of being half asleep and half awake simultaneously. The
danger here is that students commonly associate relaxation time with drinking. The
mixture of pills and alcohol can be a ticket to the emergency room, whether or not
it's a round trip ticket depends on how much of each substance was consumed.
So where do kids score these drugs if most of them are available by prescription
only? There are several routes to getting a fix. If you think about it, you probably
have a friend of a friend of a friend whose cousin hurt their knee last year in lacrosse
and who got a fat supply of Vicodin. Totally legit, right? Maybe this person is look
ing to make a buck. Less legit, but hey, he's scratching your back so it can't hurt to
scratch back.
Actually, schools and even state governments are cracking down on the unpre
scribed use of potentially harmful medications. Some health centers monitor the
frequency of refills that students request, others require students to make an ap
pointment with a physician before receiving refills or to present photo identifica
tion.
Yet for every attack there's a counter. Students who can't acquire drugs on the
black market or through friendship networks might go so far as to fake symptoms.
Many college campus physicians even admit that they have probably prescribed
drugs to a student who was either exaggerating or fabricating a medical condition.
It is difficult to discern these situations with long waiting lists making for short ap
pointments and snap diagnoses.
Some campuses empower administrators to confiscate pills from students who
can't provide a documented prescription. They may also face hearings within the
campus judicial or disciplinary system. It is not unheard of that students caught with
unprescribed drugs be charged with a criminal misdemeanor.
With serious health and social consequences, there seems to be plenty of incen
tive for Stanford students to steer clear of pills. At the same time, administrators
and campus health workers should work toward instilling students with healthy pri
orities. After all, when it comes down to an extra hour of sleep or an A in organic
chemistry, there's no easy answer.
