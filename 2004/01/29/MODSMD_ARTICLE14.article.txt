# Answer Girl eats up the burning MSG question

### 
Q Answer Girl, I have a question
for you: What the hell is MSG,
really? And is it actually as bad
as people say it is?
A "MSG," also known as
"monosodium glutamate," or
"ajinomoto" if you're Japanese
[or "em-ES-suh jee" if you're
my dad, who also says things like "orange
juice con-SEN-tuh-rate"], is just the sodi
um salt of "glutamate," or glutamic acid, a
naturally occurring amino acid. While glu
tamic acid itself is pretty common actu
ally it's even produced by the human body
in nature it almost always comes pack
aged with other amino acids, in the form of
long protein chains. In MSG though, which
is synthesized artificially, it's "free" i.e.,
in it's basically in isolated form.
So apparently, MSG comes to us
through the diligent research of a tiny, mus-

tached Japanese man who lived around the

turn of the century,
named Dr. Kikunae
Ikeda. Noticing that
"there is a taste which is
common to asparagus,
tomatoes, cheese and
meat but which is not one
of the four well-known
tastes of sweet, sour, bit
ter and salty," Ikeda bap
tized this fifth taste
"umami" what we'd

probably call it "savory." From then on, our
petite professor protagonist patiently la
bored to isolate the responsible compound
and make a vogue new seasoning from it:
And, Hai-ya, MSG was born.
But despite what were probably just
Ikeda's innocent and benevolent intentions
to make food tastier, by the '9os "MSG"
had become a dirty word. It was blamed for
all sorts of things, and although the most

common complaint was for a sort of Chi
nese-food hangover, apparently a few peo
ple darkly hinted that it had psychoactive
potential (and no, not in a good-and-EBF
sort of way).
The thing is, research shows that abnor
mal function of glutamate receptors has
been linked with certain neurological dis
eases, such as Alzheimer's disease and
Huntington's chorea. What's more, al
though eating glutamate has not been shown
to have any adverse effects which is a
good thing since, dude, it's in all "savory"
tasting foods we eat injections of gluta
mate in laboratory animals have resulted in
damage to nerve cells in their brains.
But even after a stamp of approval by,
among others, The World Health Organi
zation, the Food and Drug Administration,
the Federation of American Scientists for
Experimental Biology, the Joint Expert
Committee on Food Additives of the Unit
ed Nations and the European Commis

sion's Scientific Committee for Food and
even after the establishment and subse
quent PR campaign by the International
Glutamate Information Service (go' look
up www.glutamate.org), the popularity of
MSG has never regained its lofty Reagan
era heights.
Fortunately for the legacy of Professor
Ikeda however, the life span of food fads is
pretty damn short. And I mean, really, if
ripped sweatshirts, pointy-toed shoes, and
Anna Nicole Smith can make comebacks,
why not MSG?
Sadly, this is Answer Girl's last column
at least before she moves onto bigger
and better dignified things next volume. On
the up side, it is also the last time this God
awful unflattering picture of her will be
printed, and the last time she will let her
friends make "Answer Girl" jokes without
receiving a punch in the throat.
