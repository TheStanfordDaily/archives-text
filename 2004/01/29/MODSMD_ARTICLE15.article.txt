## Career week does little to help 'fuzzies' 
### 
The Liberal Arts Career Week, spon
sored by the Career Development
Center, culminates today with the ca
reer and internship fair in the Tresid
der Union's Oak Lounge from noon to 4 p.m.
While useful in theory, we believe this fair does
little to truly help students find a job come
June.

The fair pales in
comparison to the sci
ence and engineering
job fair held in White
Plaza in the fall of each
school year. Stanford's
liberal arts students
get the short end of the
stick when it comes to
finding a job because
they are always in the
shadow of their more
"marketable" math
and science peers.
Stanford Universi
ty's focus on scientific
research has indeed
distinguished it as one

of the foremost universities in the nation, but
those students who come to campus to study
other disciplines must also be assured they will
receive the attention they deserve when it
comes to using their degrees in the real world.
Unfortunately, today's fair will not go far in
helping them achieve their goals. Of the 35 ca-

reer categories listed on the CDC Web-site's
searchable database, fewer than half just 14
industries will be present at today's fair.
This is evidence both of employers' view of
Stanford as a science-only school and perhaps
weak marketing of the University's other dis
ciplines.
Moreover, the advertising for the fair has

been disappointing,
and the panels held
this week have little
practical use for stu
dents who will find
themselves well-edu
cated and holding a
degree from a top
school with nothing to
do after graduation.
What students need is
the ability to network,
send out their resume
to as many places as
possible and meet re
cruiters face to face.
A stronger focus on
bringing a large num-

ber of employers to campus each year would
go far in meeting hiring needs.
We can only hope that in the future Liberal
Arts Career Week will not remain the waste of
resources it has become and that it will grow to
be something students can truly seek out dur
ing their search for an internship or job.
