In recent discussions about the validity of
certain campus groups, one group, Stan
ford in Government, can be applauded for
its efforts to include programming for a
wide range of students on campus. The program
is designed to help Stanford students become
good civic actors by encouraging student partic
ipation in government. Organizers have been
imminently successful in accomplishing this
goal, most notably through helping students to
find positions in government nationwide.
The SIG program should be congratulated
both for finding internships that are of interest
to students and for providing support that stu
dents need to do these internships and fellow
ships. Stanford students should pursue these
opportunities and help the office to find new
ones so that students to come can have the same
prospects and support that current students do.
Besides these internships and fellowships,

the SIG Program is also designed to remind stu
dents of the importance of getting involved in
politics and policy. College-aged voters are the
most unorganized and least heard group of vot
ers. SIG aims not only to inform students about
these issues but also to get us involved. Stanford
students are in a unique position to have a large
impact on all levels of politics, from local to na
tional. Using the resources and the guidance of
the SIG program, we should do all we can to
help the opinions of college students be heard
and considered.
SIG states on its Web site that one of its mis
sions is "to engage students and the greater
community in the governmental process, with
the aim of helping every voice to be heard
equally."Through its programs, Stanford in
Government can help turn students into citi
zens who participate fully and effectively in gov
ernment.
