# Remodeled Tresidder gets four stars
## 
### 
Nine months ago, when Tresidder
Memorial Union closed its dining
room for a fast-track remodel, the
eating area was sorely out of date.
The tables were chipped, the chairs uncom
fortable, the servery area dark and unwel
coming. The building screamed 1974 in all
the wrong ways. At

lunchtime yesterday,
the dining room
came into the 21st
century, when Vice
Provost for Student
Affairs Gene
Awakuni, Associate
Vice Provost for Res
idential & Dining
Enterprises Shirley
Everett and Execu
tive Director of Stan
ford Dining Nadeem
Siddiqui officially
opened a revamped
servery.

On a limited budget, and under extreme
time pressure, Tresidder Union has under
gone a stunning transformation. We con
gratulate the campus offices involved in the
remodel effort for working innovatively to
make Stanford's money stretch as far as pos
sible and for giving students, faculty and
staff a high-quality place to eat.
Before the remodel, it was rare to see stu
dents patronizing the Tresidder dining room,

even at lunchtime. Since Subway and Pete's
Coffee opened last quarter, students have
become a much more prominent presence at
Tresidder. At lunchtime, it is becoming diffi
cult to find a seat indoors. At night, 10 or 15
people still linger in the Subway line in the
hour before it closes, and students skim
course readers at tables, sipping coffee with

their friends. The
plasma screens, fed
with Stanford Din
ing's supply of
DVDs, give students
one more reason to
stop by Tresidder at
night. This changed
environment bodes
well for Stanford. We
now have a signifi
cantly stronger cam
pus center, and we
laud Stanford Dining
for working to create
a viable, fun, working

Union.
Tresidder, of course, is not an ideal stu
dent union. No renovation, no matter how
extensive, will make Tresidder look a hip
college hangout. But Residential & Dining
Enterprises have pulled off a renovation
that not only significantly improved the
quality of food at the Union just sample
the bleu cheese and pear salad but also
made the building a more habitable space.
