# OPINIONS
## ORDER IN THE COURT? Look out Matlock, a trial lawyer is born 
### 
Last weekend, I got the
chance to do my first jury
trial.
My clients were Barbara Rogers
and her young children, Tommy
and Jane Rogers. Their husband /
father Alan Rogers had been killed
by a Pacific Railroad train while he
was surveying near their tracks.
They were suing Pacific Railroad
for such negligent acts as giving
AJan incorrect information about
where and when the train would ar
rive, failing to bring an itinerary on
the train that would have warned
them he'd be near the tracks and
having a drunk engineer. The rail
road claimed that it was Rogers'
own fault for not being careful
enough near the tracks.
Before you start feeling too bad
for Barbara, Tommy and Jane, I
should tell you that none of this re
ally happened. My instructors
made it all up to give us a scenario
for the mock trials that ended our
January term course in "Advocacy
Skills." In actuality, my clients were
a poor-quality copy of a black-and
white photograph.
To be honest, doing a trial wasn't
quite as exciting as I had anticipat
ed. I thought it would be an enor
mous adrenaline rush, similar to
performing on stage. Instead, it was
one of the most nerve-wracking ex
periences ever. I kept worrying that

I'd screw up in one of various possi
ble ways, such as failing to get a wit
ness to mention a crucial fact, fum
bling around with the exhibits or
missing an important objection.
(All of which I of course did several
times.) I can only imagine how
much more nervous I'd have been
in a real trial. Or if the course had
been graded.
Because the instructors

didn't want to make up dif
ferent facts for each set of
students in the class, we
were assigned to six sepa
rate versions of the same
trial, all going on at the
same time Saturday after
noon. Interestingly, the
same set of facts yielded
wildly different results: two
hung juries (we were one of
these), three verdicts in

favor of the railroad (awarding only
10, 20 and 30 percent recovery to
the Rogers family), and one verdict
in favor of the Rogers family
(awarding them 70 percent recov
ery).
Why all the different results?
While it's tempting to credit /
blame the lawyering, I think the
personalities on the jury were much
more important than the skill of the
student-lawyers. Unlike what
would happen in a real trial, the
lawyers got the chance to watch the
jury deliberate after the trial con

eluded. I was impressed that they
pretty much ignored our closing ar
guments and conducted their own
examination of the facts and the
law. The dynamics were fascinat
ing: They divided into pro-plaintiff
and pro-defendant camps, arguing
back and forth about the facts and
inferences supporting their posi
tions. (My wife is still excited aboul

how she was able to brow
beat her jury into a pro-rail
road verdict.) That's really
the way it should work a
bunch of people trying to
reason things out together
and come to a consensus.
Of course, I have to admit
that our juries were a bit
atypical. Of the nine mem
bers of our jury, seven were
law students whom we al
ready knew. Among them

was one of my co-counsel's closest
friends. And the two non-law stu
dents were counting on us for a ride
back to campus. Not surprisingly,
all three of them were solidly in our
camp.
Lesson learned. Next time I do a
jury trial, I'm driving a bus to the
courthouse.
