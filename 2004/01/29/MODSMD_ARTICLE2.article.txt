# Men look to run unbeaten streak to 18 in Oregon
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
How long can it last?
Undefeated No. 2 Stanford (16-0, 7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will fly north this weekend to take on Oregon
State (8-9, 2-5) and Oregon (9-5, 4-3), and once again the
Cardinal is a clear and decisive favorite in both matchups.
As much as head coach Mike Montgomery and the Car
dinal players downplay the issue, Stanford gets closer to
making history every weekend a fact that neither the
media nor basketball fans have overlooked.
By the end of next weekend, Stanford could equal the
school-record 20-0 start by the 2000-01 team, which set a
school record for victories (31).
But that team disappointed in the postseason, losing in
the Elite Eight to Maryland, and each week, the Cardinal
insists that it is not satisfied and it is not looking ahead.
"Any notion of trying to go undefeated, no, that's not
something that's important to us," Montgomery said. "In
our league with 18 games [in the Pac-10 schedule], we're a
long way away from anything that's significant."
Fair enough. So what challenges will face Stanford
tonight against Oregon State and Saturday versus Oregon?
Tonight, Stanford faces a young, improved squad com
ing off three tough losses. No one really likes playing in Gill
Coliseum, and the Beavers are hungry for a win.
Last year, it took a last-minute barrage of three-point
ers by then-junior guard Matt Lottich to give the Cardinal
a narrow 57-54 victory over the Beavers and that was at
Maples. Stanford didn't have an easy time in Corvallis, ei
ther, winning 84-73.
Given that second-year head coach Jay John has a
younger, more enthusiastic squad this year, Cardinal fans
can expect the Beavers to put forth a strong effort.
Athletic forward David Lucas leads the Beavers, aver
aging 16.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game while shoot
ing an excellent 55 percent from the floor. Lucas is the
Beavers' closest thing to an elder statesman, since Oregon
State does not have a single senior on its roster.
Lucas, the son of former NBA star Maurice Lucas, has
come into his own this year after averaging 6.6 points per
game last year. Although he is not the same type of pun
ishing player that his father was, Lucas has found his own
game, Beavers head coach Jay John said.
"His ability to have the ball go into the basket is first and
foremost," John said with a laugh.
"He's also adapted fairly well to dif
ferent defenses."
Undersized guards J.S Nash and
Chris Stephens (both 6-foot-l) have
done an admirable job in the Beaver
backcourt. Sophomore Stephens av
erages 15.5 points per game and
jacks up a Lottich-esque 7.5 three
point attempts per game. Nash, an
experienced junior, scores 11.2
points per game and leads the team
in assists with 4.3 dimes per game.
The rest of Oregon State's play
ers could best be described as role
players or defensive specialists, al
though forward Jim Hanchett aver
ages 9.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per
game off the bench.
Like most of the Beavers,
though, Hanchett is undersized,
standing just 6-foot-5. The Beavers
start a three-guard, two-forward
lineup in which the tallest player is
6-foot-8.
Stanford will likely try to exploit
its size advantage inside, with senior
power forward Justin Davis coming
off a huge game a week ago against
USC (21 points), junior center Rob
Little continuing his solid play (19
points, 21 rebounds in last week's
two contests) and junior swingman
Josh Childress back in the starting
lineup.
The Beavers may turn to its big
bodies, 6-foot-10 Kevin Field and 6-
foot-11 Derek Potter, to slow the
Cardinal big men, although neither
is particularly productive they
combine to average 3.0 points per
game, and Field has yet to block a
shot this season (Potter has four).
The Beavers' biggest player, 7-foot
2, 306-pound English national Liam
Hughes, is redshirting his freshman
year.
John knows, though, that even if
he slows the Cardinal's big men,
Stanford can hurt the Beavers in
other ways.
"You can look at their statistics
and see five starters in double fig
ures," he said. "You can't say,
'We're going to take this away from
them.' Because then they say,
'Okay, you're doing this, so we're
doing that.' "
Freshman French national Ange
lo Tsagarakis has of late provided

the Beavers' best guard play off the
bench and is averaging 6.6 points in
just 16 minutes per game. He only
shoots 32 percent from the field, but
that's largely because 5.6 of his 6.6
field goal attempts per game come
from behind the arc.
The Beavers will look to get hot
from downtown and have a tenden
cy to get into up-tempo games. But,
their enthusiasm may not be enough
to keep pace with the Cardinal's ex
perience, size and teamwork.
If Gill Coliseum can be unpleas
ant last year Beaver fans hound
ed Julius Barnes mercilessly
throughout his 33-point perfor
mance there last year then
McArthur Court is downright hos
tile. The Sporting News named it the
nation's best basketball arena in
2001, and many Pac-10 athletes tab
it as their least favorite place to play.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
team that inhabits "the Pit" this year
isn't the same one that thrashed the
Cardinal there last year, 79-64.
Gone are guard Luke Ridnour
last year's Pac-10 Player of the Year
and now a Seattle Supersonics re
serve and forward Robert John
son, a starter and solid presence in
the post.
That doesn't mean that the
Ducks can't still run up the score,
though. Luke Jackson, a 6-foot-7 se
nior, gets it done all over the court,
averaging 22.3 points, 7.4 rebounds
and 4.9 assists per game. Jackson
can post up or finish in transition,
but he is also a deadly shooter, aver
aging 51 percent from the floor, 44
percent from downtown and 91 per
cent from the free-throw line. And
all this despite being the focal point
of opposing defenses.
"That's not us trying to go to him,
that's the type of versatile player he
is," said seventh-year Oregon head
coach Ernie Kent. "His game just al
lows him to play that way and have
those kind of stats ... I don't know
if anyone else in the country has the
kind of numbers that he has across
the board."
Jackson earned All-Pac-10 hon
ors last year, and ranks in the con
ference's top 10 in points, rebounds
and assists. Swingmen Childress and
Nick Robinson are the Cardinal
players most likely to match up
against Jackson, and their best ef
forts will be needed to slow the Ore
gon native.
6-foot-ll Australian sophomore

Lan Crosswhite will battle with the
Cardinal's big men down low and has
been known to get hot and break
loose for a big game on offense. He
averages 13.6 points and 6.2 assists
per game. He shoots 57 percent from
the floor and 82 percent from the
line, providing a very efficient low
post option for the Ducks.
Like Oregon State, Oregon has
some big bodies 6-foot-10 fresh
man Mitch Piatt, 6-foot-9 senior Jay
Anderson and 7-foot sophomore
Matt Short but prefers to go with
a smaller, quicker lineup. White
Crosswhite and Jackson both can
play inside, both have a three-point
touch, and the Ducks' backcourt is
even more perimeter-oriented.
5-foot-10 senior James Davis
launches more than 80 percent of his
shots from three-point range, while
Andre Joseph and Brandon Lincoln
all average multiple three-point at
tempts per game.
Davis averages 12.5 points per
game and is extremely dangerous if
he gets hot. There are very few
players in college basketball who
do nothing but shoot threes and
still manage to shoot a high per
centage and Davis is one of
those players. He shoots 52 percent
from the floor, 48 percent from
downtown and has not missed a
free throw all season. Davis
doesn't start, but will play signifi
cant minutes off the bench, espe
cially if he gets hot.
Joseph, a starter, is also quite ac
curate. He gets his 11.9 points per
game on 54 percent shooting, in
cluding 46 percent from long range.
Stanford used zone defenses ef
fectively last weekend in its victories
against UCLA and USC, but proba
bly won't take that chance against an
Oregon team that routinely puts five
long-range threats on the floor at
once. Its guards will try to deny the
Ducks their three-point looks, forc
ing them to drive or post up, where
they will face a size disadvantage.
Kent is up for the challenge.
"We're just going to fight like
crazy and see where things fall," he
said.
Montgomery believes that both
Oregon schools pose a threat to the
Cardinal's perfect season.
"On a single-game basis, I really
respect of all of the teams in this con
ference," he said. "We feel like our
league's tough enough where every
game presents a challenge."
How long can it last?

State does not have a single senior on its roster.
Lucas, the son of former NBA star Maurice Lucas, has
come into his own this year after averaging 6.6 points per
game last year. Although he is not the same type of pun
ishing player that his father was, Lucas has found his own
game, Beavers head coach Jay John said.
"His ability to have the ball go into the basket is first and
foremost," John said with a laugh.
"He's also adapted fairly well to dif
ferent defenses."
Undersized guards J.S Nash and
Chris Stephens (both 6-foot-l) have
done an admirable job in the Beaver
backcourt. Sophomore Stephens av
erages 15.5 points per game and
jacks up a Lottich-esque 7.5 three
point attempts per game. Nash, an
experienced junior, scores 11.2
points per game and leads the team
in assists with 4.3 dimes per game.
The rest of Oregon State's play
ers could best be described as role
players or defensive specialists, al
though forward Jim Hanchett aver
ages 9.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per
game off the bench.
Like most of the Beavers,
though, Hanchett is undersized,
standing just 6-foot-5. The Beavers
start a three-guard, two-forward
lineup in which the tallest player is
6-foot-8.
Stanford will likely try to exploit
its size advantage inside, with senior
power forward Justin Davis coming
off a huge game a week ago against
USC (21 points), junior center Rob
Little continuing his solid play (19
points, 21 rebounds in last week's
two contests) and junior swingman
Josh Childress back in the starting
lineup.
The Beavers may turn to its big
bodies, 6-foot-10 Kevin Field and 6-
foot-11 Derek Potter, to slow the
Cardinal big men, although neither
is particularly productive they
combine to average 3.0 points per
game, and Field has yet to block a
shot this season (Potter has four).
The Beavers' biggest player, 7-foot
2, 306-pound English national Liam
Hughes, is redshirting his freshman
year.
John knows, though, that even if
he slows the Cardinal's big men,
Stanford can hurt the Beavers in
other ways.
"You can look at their statistics
and see five starters in double fig
ures," he said. "You can't say,
'We're going to take this away from
them.' Because then they say,
'Okay, you're doing this, so we're
doing that.' "
Freshman French national Ange
lo Tsagarakis has of late provided

the Beavers' best guard play off the
bench and is averaging 6.6 points in
just 16 minutes per game. He only
shoots 32 percent from the field, but
that's largely because 5.6 of his 6.6
field goal attempts per game come
from behind the arc.
The Beavers will look to get hot
from downtown and have a tenden
cy to get into up-tempo games. But,
their enthusiasm may not be enough
to keep pace with the Cardinal's ex
perience, size and teamwork.
If Gill Coliseum can be unpleas
ant last year Beaver fans hound
ed Julius Barnes mercilessly
throughout his 33-point perfor
mance there last year then
McArthur Court is downright hos
tile. The Sporting News named it the
nation's best basketball arena in
2001, and many Pac-10 athletes tab
it as their least favorite place to play.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
team that inhabits "the Pit" this year
isn't the same one that thrashed the
Cardinal there last year, 79-64.
Gone are guard Luke Ridnour
last year's Pac-10 Player of the Year
and now a Seattle Supersonics re
serve and forward Robert John
son, a starter and solid presence in
the post.
That doesn't mean that the
Ducks can't still run up the score,
though. Luke Jackson, a 6-foot-7 se
nior, gets it done all over the court,
averaging 22.3 points, 7.4 rebounds
and 4.9 assists per game. Jackson
can post up or finish in transition,
but he is also a deadly shooter, aver
aging 51 percent from the floor, 44
percent from downtown and 91 per
cent from the free-throw line. And
all this despite being the focal point
of opposing defenses.
"That's not us trying to go to him,
that's the type of versatile player he
is," said seventh-year Oregon head
coach Ernie Kent. "His game just al
lows him to play that way and have
those kind of stats ... I don't know
if anyone else in the country has the
kind of numbers that he has across
the board."
Jackson earned All-Pac-10 hon
ors last year, and ranks in the con
ference's top 10 in points, rebounds
and assists. Swingmen Childress and
Nick Robinson are the Cardinal
players most likely to match up
against Jackson, and their best ef
forts will be needed to slow the Ore
gon native.
6-foot-ll Australian sophomore

Lan Crosswhite will battle with the
Cardinal's big men down low and has
been known to get hot and break
loose for a big game on offense. He
averages 13.6 points and 6.2 assists
per game. He shoots 57 percent from
the floor and 82 percent from the
line, providing a very efficient low
post option for the Ducks.
Like Oregon State, Oregon has
some big bodies 6-foot-10 fresh
man Mitch Piatt, 6-foot-9 senior Jay
Anderson and 7-foot sophomore
Matt Short but prefers to go with
a smaller, quicker lineup. White
Crosswhite and Jackson both can
play inside, both have a three-point
touch, and the Ducks' backcourt is
even more perimeter-oriented.
5-foot-10 senior James Davis
launches more than 80 percent of his
shots from three-point range, while
Andre Joseph and Brandon Lincoln
all average multiple three-point at
tempts per game.
Davis averages 12.5 points per
game and is extremely dangerous if
he gets hot. There are very few
players in college basketball who
do nothing but shoot threes and
still manage to shoot a high per
centage and Davis is one of
those players. He shoots 52 percent
from the floor, 48 percent from
downtown and has not missed a
free throw all season. Davis
doesn't start, but will play signifi
cant minutes off the bench, espe
cially if he gets hot.
Joseph, a starter, is also quite ac
curate. He gets his 11.9 points per
game on 54 percent shooting, in
cluding 46 percent from long range.
Stanford used zone defenses ef
fectively last weekend in its victories
against UCLA and USC, but proba
bly won't take that chance against an
Oregon team that routinely puts five
long-range threats on the floor at
once. Its guards will try to deny the
Ducks their three-point looks, forc
ing them to drive or post up, where
they will face a size disadvantage.
Kent is up for the challenge.
"We're just going to fight like
crazy and see where things fall," he
said.
Montgomery believes that both
Oregon schools pose a threat to the
Cardinal's perfect season.
"On a single-game basis, I really
respect of all of the teams in this con
ference," he said. "We feel like our
league's tough enough where every
game presents a challenge."
How long can it last?
Undefeated No. 2 Stanford (16-0, 7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will fly north this weekend to take on Oregon
State (8-9, 2-5) and Oregon (9-5, 4-3), and once again the
Cardinal is a clear and decisive favorite in both matchups.
As much as head coach Mike Montgomery and the Car
dinal players downplay the issue, Stanford gets closer to
making history every weekend a fact that neither the
media nor basketball fans have overlooked.
By the end of next weekend, Stanford could equal the
school-record 20-0 start by the 2000-01 team, which set a
school record for victories (31).
But that team disappointed in the postseason, losing in
the Elite Eight to Maryland, and each week, the Cardinal
insists that it is not satisfied and it is not looking ahead.
"Any notion of trying to go undefeated, no, that's not
something that's important to us," Montgomery said. "In
our league with 18 games [in the Pac-10 schedule], we're a
long way away from anything that's significant."
Fair enough. So what challenges will face Stanford
tonight against Oregon State and Saturday versus Oregon?
Tonight, Stanford faces a young, improved squad com
ing off three tough losses. No one really likes playing in Gill
Coliseum, and the Beavers are hungry for a win.
Last year, it took a last-minute barrage of three-point
ers by then-junior guard Matt Lottich to give the Cardinal
a narrow 57-54 victory over the Beavers and that was at
Maples. Stanford didn't have an easy time in Corvallis, ei
ther, winning 84-73.
Given that second-year head coach Jay John has a
younger, more enthusiastic squad this year, Cardinal fans
can expect the Beavers to put forth a strong effort.
Athletic forward David Lucas leads the Beavers, aver
aging 16.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game while shoot
ing an excellent 55 percent from the floor. Lucas is the
Beavers' closest thing to an elder statesman, since Oregon
State does not have a single senior on its roster.
Lucas, the son of former NBA star Maurice Lucas, has

The Beavers' biggest player, 7-foot
2, 306-pound English national Liam
Hughes, is redshirting his freshman
year.
John knows, though, that even if
he slows the Cardinal's big men,
Stanford can hurt the Beavers in
other ways.
"You can look at their statistics
and see five starters in double fig
ures," he said. "You can't say,
'We're going to take this away from
them.' Because then they say,
'Okay, you're doing this, so we're
doing that.' "
Freshman French national Ange
lo Tsagarakis has of late provided

the Beavers' best guard play off the
bench and is averaging 6.6 points in
just 16 minutes per game. He only
shoots 32 percent from the field, but
that's largely because 5.6 of his 6.6
field goal attempts per game come
from behind the arc.
The Beavers will look to get hot
from downtown and have a tenden
cy to get into up-tempo games. But,
their enthusiasm may not be enough
to keep pace with the Cardinal's ex
perience, size and teamwork.
If Gill Coliseum can be unpleas
ant last year Beaver fans hound
ed Julius Barnes mercilessly
throughout his 33-point perfor
mance there last year then
McArthur Court is downright hos
tile. The Sporting News named it the
nation's best basketball arena in
2001, and many Pac-10 athletes tab
it as their least favorite place to play.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, the
team that inhabits "the Pit" this year
isn't the same one that thrashed the
Cardinal there last year, 79-64.
Gone are guard Luke Ridnour
last year's Pac-10 Player of the Year
and now a Seattle Supersonics re
serve and forward Robert John
son, a starter and solid presence in
the post.
That doesn't mean that the
Ducks can't still run up the score,
though. Luke Jackson, a 6-foot-7 se
nior, gets it done all over the court,
averaging 22.3 points, 7.4 rebounds
and 4.9 assists per game. Jackson
can post up or finish in transition,
but he is also a deadly shooter, aver
aging 51 percent from the floor, 44
percent from downtown and 91 per
cent from the free-throw line. And
all this despite being the focal point
of opposing defenses.
"That's not us trying to go to him,
that's the type of versatile player he
is," said seventh-year Oregon head
coach Ernie Kent. "His game just al
lows him to play that way and have
those kind of stats ... I don't know
if anyone else in the country has the
kind of numbers that he has across
the board."
Jackson earned All-Pac-10 hon
ors last year, and ranks in the con
ference's top 10 in points, rebounds
and assists. Swingmen Childress and
Nick Robinson are the Cardinal
players most likely to match up
against Jackson, and their best ef
forts will be needed to slow the Ore
gon native.
6-foot-ll Australian sophomore

Lan Crosswhite will battle with the
Cardinal's big men down low and has
been known to get hot and break
loose for a big game on offense. He
averages 13.6 points and 6.2 assists
per game. He shoots 57 percent from
the floor and 82 percent from the
line, providing a very efficient low
post option for the Ducks.
Like Oregon State, Oregon has
some big bodies 6-foot-10 fresh
man Mitch Piatt, 6-foot-9 senior Jay
Anderson and 7-foot sophomore
Matt Short but prefers to go with
a smaller, quicker lineup. White
Crosswhite and Jackson both can
play inside, both have a three-point
touch, and the Ducks' backcourt is
even more perimeter-oriented.
5-foot-10 senior James Davis
launches more than 80 percent of his
shots from three-point range, while
Andre Joseph and Brandon Lincoln
all average multiple three-point at
tempts per game.
Davis averages 12.5 points per
game and is extremely dangerous if
he gets hot. There are very few
players in college basketball who
do nothing but shoot threes and
still manage to shoot a high per
centage and Davis is one of
those players. He shoots 52 percent
from the floor, 48 percent from
downtown and has not missed a
free throw all season. Davis
doesn't start, but will play signifi
cant minutes off the bench, espe
cially if he gets hot.
Joseph, a starter, is also quite ac
curate. He gets his 11.9 points per
game on 54 percent shooting, in
cluding 46 percent from long range.
Stanford used zone defenses ef
fectively last weekend in its victories
against UCLA and USC, but proba
bly won't take that chance against an
Oregon team that routinely puts five
long-range threats on the floor at
once. Its guards will try to deny the
Ducks their three-point looks, forc
ing them to drive or post up, where
they will face a size disadvantage.
Kent is up for the challenge.
"We're just going to fight like
crazy and see where things fall," he
said.
Montgomery believes that both
Oregon schools pose a threat to the
Cardinal's perfect season.
"On a single-game basis, I really
respect of all of the teams in this con
ference," he said. "We feel like our
league's tough enough where every
game presents a challenge."
How long can it last?
Undefeated No. 2 Stanford (16-0, 7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will fly north this weekend to take on Oregon
State (8-9, 2-5) and Oregon (9-5, 4-3), and once again the
Cardinal is a clear and decisive favorite in both matchups.
As much as head coach Mike Montgomery and the Car
dinal players downplay the issue, Stanford gets closer to
making history every weekend a fact that neither the
media nor basketball fans have overlooked.
By the end of next weekend, Stanford could equal the
school-record 20-0 start by the 2000-01 team, which set a
school record for victories (31).
But that team disappointed in the postseason, losing in
the Elite Eight to Maryland, and each week, the Cardinal
insists that it is not satisfied and it is not looking ahead.
"Any notion of trying to go undefeated, no, that's not
something that's important to us," Montgomery said. "In
our league with 18 games [in the Pac-10 schedule], we're a
long way away from anything that's significant."
Fair enough. So what challenges will face Stanford
tonight against Oregon State and Saturday versus Oregon?
Tonight, Stanford faces a young, improved squad com
ing off three tough losses. No one really likes playing in Gill
Coliseum, and the Beavers are hungry for a win.
Last year, it took a last-minute barrage of three-point
ers by then-junior guard Matt Lottich to give the Cardinal
a narrow 57-54 victory over the Beavers and that was at
Maples. Stanford didn't have an easy time in Corvallis, ei
ther, winning 84-73.
Given that second-year head coach Jay John has a
younger, more enthusiastic squad this year, Cardinal fans
can expect the Beavers to put forth a strong effort.
Athletic forward David Lucas leads the Beavers, aver
aging 16.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game while shoot
ing an excellent 55 percent from the floor. Lucas is the
Beavers' closest thing to an elder statesman, since Oregon
State does not have a single senior on its roster.
Lucas, the son of former NBA star Maurice Lucas, has
come into his own this year after averaging 6.6 points per
game last year. Although he is not the same type of pun
ishing player that his father was, Lucas has found his own
game, Beavers head coach Jay John said.
"His ability to have the ball go into the basket is first and
foremost," John said with a laugh.
"He's also adapted fairly well to dif
ferent defenses."
Undersized guards J.S Nash and
Chris Stephens (both 6-foot-l) have
done an admirable job in the Beaver
backcourt. Sophomore Stephens av
erages 15.5 points per game and
jacks up a Lottich-esque 7.5 three
point attempts per game. Nash, an
experienced junior, scores 11.2
points per game and leads the team
in assists with 4.3 dimes per game.
The rest of Oregon State's play
ers could best be described as role
players or defensive specialists, al
though forward Jim Hanchett aver
ages 9.2 points and 5.9 rebounds per
game off the bench.
Like most of the Beavers,
though, Hanchett is undersized,
standing just 6-foot-5. The Beavers
start a three-guard, two-forward
lineup in which the tallest player is
6-foot-8.
Stanford will likely try to exploit
its size advantage inside, with senior
power forward Justin Davis coming
off a huge game a week ago against
USC (21 points), junior center Rob
Little continuing his solid play (19
points, 21 rebounds in last week's
two contests) and junior swingman
Josh Childress back in the starting
lineup.
The Beavers may turn to its big
bodies, 6-foot-10 Kevin Field and 6-
foot-11 Derek Potter, to slow the
Cardinal big men, although neither
is particularly productive they
combine to average 3.0 points per
game, and Field has yet to block a
shot this season (Potter has four).
The Beavers' biggest player, 7-foot
2, 306-pound English national Liam
Hughes, is redshirting his freshman
year.

he slows the Cardinal's big men,
Stanford can hurt the Beavers in
