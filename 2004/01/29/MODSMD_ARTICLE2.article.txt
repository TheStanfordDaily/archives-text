How long can it last?
Undefeated No. 2 Stanford (16-0, 7-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will fly north this weekend to take on Oregon
State (8-9, 2-5) and Oregon (9-5, 4-3), and once again the
Cardinal is a clear and decisive favorite in both matchups.
As much as head coach Mike Montgomery and the Car
dinal players downplay the issue, Stanford gets closer to
making history every weekend a fact that neither the
media nor basketball fans have overlooked.
By the end of next weekend, Stanford could equal the
school-record 20-0 start by the 2000-01 team, which set a
school record for victories (31).
But that team disappointed in the postseason, losing in
the Elite Eight to Maryland, and each week, the Cardinal
insists that it is not satisfied and it is not looking ahead.
"Any notion of trying to go undefeated, no, that's not
something that's important to us," Montgomery said. "In
our league with 18 games [in the Pac-10 schedule], we're a
long way away from anything that's significant."
Fair enough. So what challenges will face Stanford
tonight against Oregon State and Saturday versus Oregon?
Tonight, Stanford faces a young, improved squad com
ing off three tough losses. No one really likes playing in Gill
Coliseum, and the Beavers are hungry for a win.
Last year, it took a last-minute barrage of three-point
ers by then-junior guard Matt Lottich to give the Cardinal
a narrow 57-54 victory over the Beavers and that was at
Maples. Stanford didn't have an easy time in Corvallis, ei
ther, winning 84-73.
Given that second-year head coach Jay John has a
younger, more enthusiastic squad this year, Cardinal fans
can expect the Beavers to put forth a strong effort.
Athletic forward David Lucas leads the Beavers, aver
aging 16.2 points and 6.1 rebounds per game while shoot
ing an excellent 55 percent from the floor. Lucas is the
Beavers' closest thing to an elder statesman, since Oregon
State does not have a single senior on its roster.
Lucas, the son of former NBA star Maurice Lucas, has
come into his own this year after averaging 6.6 points per
game last year. Although he is not the same type of pun
ishing player that his father was, Lucas has found his own
game, Beavers head coach Jay John said.
"His ability to have the ball go into the basket is first and
