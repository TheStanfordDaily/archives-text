1-Hum is valuable!

Michelle Keller's column
("How much would you pay?"
Jan. 28) points out the value of at
tending an introductory eco
nomics course is well taken. With
that said, could you not make as
strong an argument without bash
ing the worth of another disci
pline? The use of I-Hum as a
whipping boy is trite, and it has
become painfully tiresome to
read The Daily's perpetual jokes
about the worthlessness of hu
manistic inquiry. Perhaps, just as
you have discovered the value of
an education in economics, so too
will you come to value a humanis
tic education and then you can
spend time, energy, paper and ink

articulating it in your next col
umn. Until then, keep your eye
on what's central to your argu
ment, and please keep the unnec
essary anti-humanistic-intellectu
alism out of the picture.

Coursework editorial off

I find your editorial ("Course
work is overly expensive," Jan.
27) refreshing but factually
flawed. Coursework is indeed
expensive, but not because it is a
"brand-name" product
Coursework was developed in
house by Stanford, and is re
leased for free at http://get
coursework.stanford.edu. With

the knowledge from such basic
research, the reasons for its ex
pense are much cloudier, and
seem to be mostly maintenance
costs. I'm not sure if a new $6.8
million, multi-University initia
tive to create a brand new system
is going to solve anything, ex
pense-wise; as the Jan. 23 news
article points out, Coursework
was also initially funded by a
grant that now is running out.
Someone needs to find how ex
actly this system is costing
$730,000 per year especially
when a graduate student can run
an alternate system for the entire
EE department for free in his
spare time.
