## Oski, Connery and D'Farmer in 'Jeopardy!' 
### 
Alex Trebek: And welcome back to "Celebrity
Jeopardy! Sports Edition." As you may have
noticed, I've removed my headphones, my
ears have stopped ringing and Dick Vitale is
no longer with us hardly a coincidence. The dullest
contestant our producers could find, Cal's lovable bear
mascot, Oski, has replaced Mr. Vitale and will take con
trol of his money with a capital 'M,' baby. (Did I really
just say that? I hate my job.)
Sean Connery: Trebek, I think you're awesome with
a capital 'A,' baby!
Alex Trebek: Why, thank you Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: Awesome at sucking! Hahaha. Aha
hahaha.
Alex Trebek: Right. Anyway, let's take a look at the
scores. We've got quite the nail-biter heading into Dou
ble Jeopardy! This is more exciting than the Winter X
Games. Oski is in first place with $2OO thanks to several,

what Mr. Vitale would deem, "Cup
cake City" questions. Southern Cali
fornia guard Desmon Farmer is in sec
ond place with an awe-inspiring nega
tive $4,000, although his stylish, upside
down headband is far more "money"
than any dollar amount he could possi
bly accumulate today. Finally, and this
should come as no surprise, Mr. Con
nery is bringing up the rear with a
whopping negative $6,500.
Sean Connery: I beg your pardon,
Trebek. Bringing up the rear? Talking

about your mom again, are we? Hahaha. Ahahahaha.
Alex Trebek: It's an expression, Mr. Connery, an ex
pression.
Desmon Farmer: Expression? Don't go for second
best, baby, put your love to the test. You know, you
know, you've got to make him express how
Alex Trebek: Get a hold of yourself Mr. Farmer. I'm
not Ed McMahon and this is not "Star Search."
Desmon Farmer: That was "Express Yourself" by
Alex Trebek: I know what that was, Mr. Farmer. Can
we please get on with the game?
Desmon Farmer: Yeah, that's cool, but I'll drop 40 on
you afterward, old man.
Alex Trebek: Alright then. Let's take a look at the
categories: "Potent Potables"
Desmon Farmer: Come on, man! Why is that always
a category? Always!
Alex Trebek: In case you haven't noticed, this is not
the Los Angeles Sports Arena. We play by my rules here,
Mr. Farmer. It's called consistency, but you and your un
derachieving twin-laden team wouldn't know much
about that, would you? Moving on ... "Bear Mascots
Who Wear Ugly Sweaters," "Desmon Farmer Did This
Against Arizona," "Look Stupid," "Stanford Hoops,"
"Tap Water" and "Things You Say When You Answer
Your Phone." Oski, you have control of the board.
Please make a selection.
Oski: [Waving]
Alex Trebek: Like you, I'm speechless. OK, well let's
try "Bear Mascots Who Wear Ugly Sweaters" for $4OO.
The answer is: "This big 'O' doesn't like to 'ski.' It just
wanders around at Cal athletic events."
Desmon Farmer: [Buzzes in.]
Alex Trebek: Mr. Farmer.
Desmon Farmer: Who is Lute Olson? I dropped 40 on
his 'Cats earliertfhis month. 'Zona didn't know what hit
'em.
Alex Trebek: I'm sorry, that is incorrect.
Sean Connery: [Buzzes in.]
Alex Trebek: Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: Yeah, big 'O' in a bear costume...
who is Oprah?
Alex Trebek: Wrong. Oski, care to venture a guess?
Just say your name, Oski. Please.
Desmon Farmer: Say my name, say my name, when
no one is around you, say baby I love you
Alex Trebek: Thank you Destiny's Child. I didn't
think it was possible, but I actually miss Mr. Vitale right
now. And of course the correct answer was "Oski."
Make a selection, Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: I'll take Stan Ford Ho Ops for $BOO.
Alex Trebek: No, that's Stanford Hoops, Mr. Con
nery. Basketball.
Sean Connery: Whatever, Trebek. Co-Ops, Ho-Ops,
Hoops it's all the same.
Alex Trebek: The answer is: This school's men's bas
ketball team is ranked No. 2 in the latest Top 25 Poll.
Sean Connery: What is Duke?
Alex Trebek: Wrong again, Mr. Connery, though in
my eyes you're right. Moving on to Final Jeopardy, the
category is ... forget it, this is impossible. [Ripping up
card] I'll tell you what, write down your favorite article
of clothing. [Jeopardy music.] Perhaps you like jerseys or
headbands. Snowsuits are lovely, too. Any article of
clothing.
Let's start with Oski. You wrote down, "My other
sweater is cashmere." Profound. I'm sure it is, but unfor
tunately we can't accept that. You wagered ... "The
Axe." Well I suppose you were going to lose that next
year anyway, so no big loss there.
Moving on to Mr. Farmer, who looks rather pleased.
Please stop bobbing your head around like an imbecile,
you're making my neck hurt. You wrote down, "NIT
gear." It's a miracle. You're correct. Lucky for you,
you'll be getting some of that gear come March. You wa
gered ... "Go Trojans." Fabulous.
Finally, Sean Connery, let's see what you put down.
"Long John's." Simply amazing, we have entered un
chartered territory on this show. Not one, but two cor
rect answers in Final Jeopardy! And you wagered:
"sleeping with your mother." "Long John's sleeping with
your mother." Hilarious.
Sean Connery: HA. HA. Hahahahaha.
Alex Trebek: That's all for Jeopardy! Goodnight.

trol of his money with a capital 'M,' baby. (Did I really
just say that? I hate my job.)
Sean Connery: Trebek, I think you're awesome with
a capital 'A,' baby!
Alex Trebek: Why, thank you Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: Awesome at sucking! Hahaha. Aha
hahaha.
Alex Trebek: Right. Anyway, let's take a look at the
scores. We've got quite the nail-biter heading into Dou
ble Jeopardy! This is more exciting than the Winter X
Games. Oski is in first place with $2OO thanks to several,

what Mr. Vitale would deem, "Cup
cake City" questions. Southern Cali
fornia guard Desmon Farmer is in sec
ond place with an awe-inspiring nega
tive $4,000, although his stylish, upside
down headband is far more "money"
than any dollar amount he could possi
bly accumulate today. Finally, and this
should come as no surprise, Mr. Con
nery is bringing up the rear with a
whopping negative $6,500.
Sean Connery: I beg your pardon,
Trebek. Bringing up the rear? Talking

about your mom again, are we? Hahaha. Ahahahaha.
Alex Trebek: It's an expression, Mr. Connery, an ex
pression.
Desmon Farmer: Expression? Don't go for second
best, baby, put your love to the test. You know, you
know, you've got to make him express how
Alex Trebek: Get a hold of yourself Mr. Farmer. I'm
not Ed McMahon and this is not "Star Search."
Desmon Farmer: That was "Express Yourself" by
Alex Trebek: I know what that was, Mr. Farmer. Can
we please get on with the game?
Desmon Farmer: Yeah, that's cool, but I'll drop 40 on
you afterward, old man.
Alex Trebek: Alright then. Let's take a look at the
categories: "Potent Potables"
Desmon Farmer: Come on, man! Why is that always
a category? Always!
Alex Trebek: In case you haven't noticed, this is not
the Los Angeles Sports Arena. We play by my rules here,
Mr. Farmer. It's called consistency, but you and your un
derachieving twin-laden team wouldn't know much
about that, would you? Moving on ... "Bear Mascots
Who Wear Ugly Sweaters," "Desmon Farmer Did This
Against Arizona," "Look Stupid," "Stanford Hoops,"
"Tap Water" and "Things You Say When You Answer
Your Phone." Oski, you have control of the board.
Please make a selection.
Oski: [Waving]
Alex Trebek: Like you, I'm speechless. OK, well let's
try "Bear Mascots Who Wear Ugly Sweaters" for $4OO.
The answer is: "This big 'O' doesn't like to 'ski.' It just
wanders around at Cal athletic events."
Desmon Farmer: [Buzzes in.]
Alex Trebek: Mr. Farmer.
Desmon Farmer: Who is Lute Olson? I dropped 40 on
his 'Cats earliertfhis month. 'Zona didn't know what hit
'em.
Alex Trebek: I'm sorry, that is incorrect.
Sean Connery: [Buzzes in.]
Alex Trebek: Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: Yeah, big 'O' in a bear costume...
who is Oprah?
Alex Trebek: Wrong. Oski, care to venture a guess?
Just say your name, Oski. Please.
Desmon Farmer: Say my name, say my name, when
no one is around you, say baby I love you
Alex Trebek: Thank you Destiny's Child. I didn't
think it was possible, but I actually miss Mr. Vitale right
now. And of course the correct answer was "Oski."
Make a selection, Mr. Connery.
Sean Connery: I'll take Stan Ford Ho Ops for $BOO.
Alex Trebek: No, that's Stanford Hoops, Mr. Con
nery. Basketball.
Sean Connery: Whatever, Trebek. Co-Ops, Ho-Ops,
Hoops it's all the same.
Alex Trebek: The answer is: This school's men's bas
ketball team is ranked No. 2 in the latest Top 25 Poll.
Sean Connery: What is Duke?
Alex Trebek: Wrong again, Mr. Connery, though in
my eyes you're right. Moving on to Final Jeopardy, the
category is ... forget it, this is impossible. [Ripping up
card] I'll tell you what, write down your favorite article
of clothing. [Jeopardy music.] Perhaps you like jerseys or
headbands. Snowsuits are lovely, too. Any article of
clothing.
Let's start with Oski. You wrote down, "My other
sweater is cashmere." Profound. I'm sure it is, but unfor
tunately we can't accept that. You wagered ... "The
Axe." Well I suppose you were going to lose that next
year anyway, so no big loss there.
Moving on to Mr. Farmer, who looks rather pleased.
Please stop bobbing your head around like an imbecile,
you're making my neck hurt. You wrote down, "NIT
gear." It's a miracle. You're correct. Lucky for you,
you'll be getting some of that gear come March. You wa
gered ... "Go Trojans." Fabulous.
Finally, Sean Connery, let's see what you put down.
"Long John's." Simply amazing, we have entered un
chartered territory on this show. Not one, but two cor
rect answers in Final Jeopardy! And you wagered:
"sleeping with your mother." "Long John's sleeping with
your mother." Hilarious.
Sean Connery: HA. HA. Hahahahaha.
Alex Trebek: That's all for Jeopardy! Goodnight.

Alex Trebek: And welcome back to "Celebrity
Jeopardy! Sports Edition." As you may have
noticed, I've removed my headphones, my
ears have stopped ringing and Dick Vitale is
no longer with us hardly a coincidence. The dullest
contestant our producers could find, Cal's lovable bear
mascot, Oski, has replaced Mr. Vitale and will take con
trol of his money with a capital 'M,' baby. (Did I really
