# No. 7 Cardinal faces No. 10 Wash
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Since they know how to tame wildcats, a team of
huskies should not be too tough to handle.
The N0.7 Stanford women's gymnastics (4-1,1-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) team took down the No. 6 Arizona
Wildcats in a decisive 197.3-194.6 home meet last week
end. The team is looking for a repeat performance at
home tomorrow night against the No. 10 Washington
Huskies (5-1,1-1 Pac-10).
Last weekend's meet was definitely a confidence
booster for the Cardinal after having swallowed a dis
appointing loss to Arizona State the previous weekend.
Hie team came out against Arizona with great energy
and aggressive performances to register its highest
team score of the season and the fifth highest women's
team score in Stanford gymnastics history.
"We came into the meet really confident and ag
gressive because we were upset about losing last week
end," said senior Lise Leveille, who tied for first in the
all-around with sophomore Natalie Foley. "No one was
holding back everyone just did big gymnastics."
Stanford started the meet strong on vault, led by
Leveille and Foley who both stuck their landings to
score a 9.9 and 9.925, respectively. The team improved
the difficulty of their vaults from their meet last week
end and hopes to continue upgrading as the season con
tinues.
"I had been working really hard on my vault all fall
quarter, but I had yet to compete it like I've been prac
ticing it," Leveille said. "Tonight, though, it was just as
good as it is in the gym."
After vault, the Cardinal faced a slight setback on
the uneven bars when sophomore Jessica Louie fell on
a release move and was unable to finish her routine (or
compete in the remainder of the meet) due to pain in
her back.
"When Louie fell, it could have been a turning point
in the meet," Stanford head coach Kristen Smyth said.
"But the girls showed tremendous character and
stepped up their performances."
Freshman Stacy Sprando helped fill the gap left by
Louie by contributing to the team on bars and beam
with a 9.75 and 9.775, respectively. Sprando is one of
three freshmen on the team, but is the only one cur
rently competing. She is already a crowd favorite with
fans from her freshman dorm, who brought a banner
that read "Forget Stacy's Mom... Stacy's got it going
on."
The Cardinal certainly had it going on during the
floor exercise. Despite being short a competitor due to
Louie's injury, the team talked up 49.475 points on the
floor exercise, almost half a point higher than the Car
dinal's average team score on floor last year and its
highest floor score this season.
Senior co-captain Caroline Fluhrer scored a career
high on floor with a 9.95 to tie her for first on the event
with Leveille and Arizona's Katie Johnson.
The only major concern after last weekend's perfor
mance could be whether or not the team is peaking too
early in the season. But Smyth said that the team has
not yet hit full capacity.
The Cardinal has several additions to make in the
upcoming meets, including contributions from sopho
more Glyn Sweets, who has yet to compete on bars and
floor this season, as well Fluhrer, who has yet to com
pete on vault. Also, senior All-American Kendall Beck
will make her season debut on beam and perhaps vault
at tomorrow night's meet.
Beck's talent will be needed since the Huskies are
hungry for a win after losing to Stanford by a mere 0.025
last year and losing to Oregon State by the same narrow
margin last weekend. The team is led by seniors Emily
Pritchard, ranked No. 9 nationally in the all-around,
and Molly Seaman, ranked No. 12 on beam.
