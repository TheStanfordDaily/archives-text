# Men get chance for Cal revenge
## 
### KRISTEN BELL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the adage goes, if at first you don't succeed, try, try
again. Stanford's No. 10 men's gymnastics team (1-1) will
be doing just that as they try to beat California on Friday
after suffering a 216.2-203.9 loss to the Golden Bears last
weekend.
With senior captain Dan Gill at a national team train
ing camp last weekend and star freshmen Dylan Carney
and Peter Derman injured, the nine-man Cardinal team
lacked depth against the larger, more experienced Cal
squad.
A fully equipped team puts six gymnasts in each event
and counts the top four scores, but last weekend Stanford
was only able to put five gymnasts in floor exercise, pom
mel horse, rings and high bar, and just four gymnasts on
parallel bars. That meant almost every routine counted,
putting incredible pressure on all of the gymnasts.
Sophomore Sean Doolan stepped up to lead the
short-handed Cardinal with the team's highest score of
9.5 on floor exercise. But, he will not compete tomorrow
night due to a strained back.
Even with Gill, Derman, and possibly Carney back in
the mix this Friday, however, the Stanford team will face
a challenge against its rival across the Bay.
"If we have all our guns in a row, we can give them a
run," said Stanford head coach Thorn Glielmi. "But Cal
is a strong team, probably the team to beat this year and
it will be hard for us to get everyone in the lineup."
An upset over Cal will not be impossible, especially
since the Cardinal kicked off its season with a win over
No. 4 Michigan.
Stanford and Cal are equally matched on the pommel
horse, but Cal has much more depth on the high bar. Gill
and sophomore Nate Downs are Stanford's only gym
nasts able to deliver routines scoring a 9.5 or better on
high bar, according to Glielmi, but Cal has four such
gymnasts.
However, the Cardinal might be able to make up the
slack on the still rings, especially with Derman returning
to compete after recuperating from a bicep tendon
strain.
Stanford will also be competing against No. 16 Air
Force at the meet tomorrow night in Berkeley.
