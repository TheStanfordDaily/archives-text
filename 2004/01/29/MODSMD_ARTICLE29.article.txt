# Rappahahn a steady force off bench

### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One of the major problems that
opponents of the No. 6 women's bas
ketball team encounter is the team's
depth. After all, the Cardinal (15-3,8-
1 Pacific 10 Conference) can count on
clutch play not only by its starting
five, but also by its three reserves.
Just ask sophomore guard Krista
Rappahahn, a key reserve and an in
tegral part to Stanford's offensive
strategy.
Her numbers start to tell the story.
Rappahahn leads her team in both
field-goal percentages (.561) and
three-point percentages (.629).
During a time when the Cardinal
is struggling overall from the perime
ter, Rappahahn's consistency makes
her contributions critical and im
proves her confidence in her own
abilities.
"I started knocking down shots
and that gave me confidence," Rap
pahahn said. "And getting the oppor
tunity to play is really exciting for
_ 55
me.
It's been exciting to watch too. In
Pac-10 play this season, Rappahahn
posted big numbers against Washing
ton State with 16 points and four
three pointers. The guard followed
up that performance the next week
end at Arizona with another 16 points
including another four from behind
the three.
Rappahahn is quick to point out
that she cannot be defined by her of
fensive prowess alone.
"I don't want people to have the
opinion of me that I'm only a shoot
er," she said.
Indeed, her response is just what
makes the Cardinal so dangerous to
so many teams. She's not just a threat
from downtown, nor is her team just
about outside shooting.
Following last weekend's rough
road trip in which the Cardinal fell to
Southern California, Stanford now
faces the Washington schools at
home. The team is focused on open
ing the second half of the conference
season with a renewed determination
to step up its game to the next level.
Defensively, the Cardinal seeks to
push it up a notch this weekend, fore

ing its opponents out of their rhythm
and crashing the boards on both ends
of the court.
"On defense, we want to be more
aggressive and force more
turnovers," Rappahahn said. "Re
bounding is key."
Offensively, Rappahahn's skills
will be increasingly tested, showcas
ing her own maturity over the course
of the season. At a press conference
earlier this week, head coach Tara
VanDerveer highlighted the need to
expand the team's offensive options,
particularly down low.
"To have any chance of making a
run in the tournaments, we need to
establish an inside game," Van-
Derveer said. "We need to get the
ball [in the post] and get them scor
ing."
While her team will still depend on
the consistency the sophomore has
demonstrated thus far, Rappahahn is
already eager to help create a more
diverse offense.
"I love to pass the ball and see my
teammates succeed," Rappahahn
said. "We're working on feeding the
ball inside and if we can get that
going, it takes pressure off the guards
and makes the other teams respect all
the positions."
Recognizing that her shooting has
not gone unnoticed by other Pac-10
teams, Rappahahn's ready to in
crease her range and her shot selec
tion, in particular, her drives to the
hoop.
"Other teams have been playing
me really tight and driving to the bas
ket counters that tight defense," Rap
pahahn said. "My teammates do a re
ally good job creating opportunities
for me off driving and dishing into the
post and back out."
While lesser teams might face a bit
of a letdown at this critical halfway
juncture, the Cardinal is taking a hard
look at itself and making necessary
adjustments.
It's part of a work ethic that is sec
ond nature to these women.
When Rappahahn was disap
pointed with her shooting at the end
of last season, she simply devoted
extra hours to the gym, often side-by
side her teammates.
Such effort has already reaped re

ward for both Rappahahn, indi
vidually, and for her team.
Hard work is only half the story
though. With tournament time draw
ing ever nearer not to mention the
whole second half of Pac-10 play
about to unfold Rappahahn points
out that the secret to success also de

pends on a more elusive intangible.
"The team needs everyone play
ing with confidence," Rappahahn
said. "We all need to have fun out
there and remember that we do it be
cause we love the game."
If only most of us were that wise
when we were sophomores.
