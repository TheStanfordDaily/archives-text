# Robinson proves he can adjust
## 
### ARISHA HATCH MANAGING EDITOR 
Fitting in with the guys was never a big concern
for Nick Robinson when he first set foot onto
Stanford's campus.
"I imagine my teammates look at me as a little
more mature .. .like I'm at a different stage in my
life," Robinson said.
But then again, he's an adjuster.
He's versatile.
And almost four years since his arrival, he's
just one of the guys, although he is Stanford's el
dest player and all his teammates call him "Pops."
But back on that first day, he wasn't your typi
cal wide-eyed freshman.
Robinson arrived to campus at the age of 20
married after spending two years in Maceio,
Brazil while completing his Mormon mission.
He'd been a few places, seen a few things and
already signed two National Letters of Intent, one
when he first graduated from high school in 1998
and the other after he returned from Brazil two
years later.
So needless to say, life at Stanford would take
a little getting used to.
"Stanford, academically, was very different
from what I was doing the past few years.. .1
hadn't been studying," Robinson said. "And I
hadn't played basketball on a regular basis [while
in Brazil] so it was really difficult trying to adjust."
But, as mentioned above, Robinson is an
adjuster as he's shown over and over again

this season.
Easily Stanford's most versatile player, Robin
son can play the small forward position, the point
and the off-guard, allowing Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery several offensive and defen
sive options.
"I enjoy playing the game of basketball and
that includes playing at every position," Robinson
said. "Being able to handle the ball or post some
body up when I have to ... really allows me to
contribute to the team and my own enjoyment of
the game."
But most of all he's an unselfish player un
doubtedly a sign of maturity and he's by far
and away the most under-appreciated member of
a team chalk full of role players.
In many ways, his persona is emblematic of the
Cardinal's national identity the idea that the
whole, the entirety of the machine, is much more
important than its parts.
And to a certain extent, Robinson's latest on
court adjustment the transition from starter to
sixth man isn't all that new to him.
Last year, when Justin Davis went down with a
sprained knee, Robinson was thrust into the start
ing lineup for several weeks and filled in quite
nicely for Davis until his return.
But that doesn't mean the transition is any eas
ier this time around and while Robinson's certain
ly not complaining about his revised role, the cir
cumstances aren't quite the same either.

The highly-anticipated return of
Childress from injury coupled with
the Cardinal's undefeated record
led to a whole lotta' talk.
Stanford had been perfect up
until that point not perfect in an
"it's impossible to improve" kind of
way, but perfect in the sense that in
the moments that Stanford has des
perately needed to rise to the occa
sion, it has.
What would happen to team
chemistry when Childress returned?
How would he fit in?
What would be the affect on play
er rotation and minutes?
All these questions all assum
ing the inevitability of Childress' re
turn — often inadvertently glossed
over how integral Robinsop had
been up until that point.
Montgomery admitted that he,
too, forgot to consider how the
switch might affect Robinson.
In Robinson's first game off the
bench last week against UCLA, he

didn't seem like his old self. He fin
ished the contest with four points
off l-for-4 shooting from the field
but never looked in-sync.
"I thought that [against UCLA]
Nick was kinda feeling his way,"
Montgomery said.
On Saturday against USC, how
ever, Robinson had an impressive
outing proving that he's still an
impact player.
He scored nine points in a critical
second half stretch for the Cardinal,
which trailed the Trojans by six at the
half. He finished the game with 13.
"It's a transition I went through
last year [when Davis got injured],"
Robinson added. "'This year, it's
similar 1 just needed to make an
adjustment and watch what was
going on. Tonight, I was able to pro
vide a little energy."
And, speaking of changes,
"Pops" and his wife Meagan are ex
pecting a child due March 1
adding an interesting level of insan
ity to the Madness that is March.
Asked if he's ready for the new ad
dition, for all the adjustments that will
have to be made, Robinson laughs,
"Ready as I'm ever gonna be."

over how integral Robinsop had
been up until that point.
Montgomery admitted that he,
too, forgot to consider how the
switch might affect Robinson.
In Robinson's first game off the
bench last week against UCLA, he

didn't seem like his old self. He fin
ished the contest with four points
off l-for-4 shooting from the field
but never looked in-sync.
"I thought that [against UCLA]
Nick was kinda feeling his way,"
Montgomery said.
On Saturday against USC, how
ever, Robinson had an impressive
outing proving that he's still an
impact player.
He scored nine points in a critical
second half stretch for the Cardinal,
which trailed the Trojans by six at the
half. He finished the game with 13.
"It's a transition I went through
last year [when Davis got injured],"
Robinson added. "'This year, it's
similar 1 just needed to make an
adjustment and watch what was
going on. Tonight, I was able to pro
vide a little energy."
And, speaking of changes,
"Pops" and his wife Meagan are ex
pecting a child due March 1
adding an interesting level of insan
ity to the Madness that is March.
Asked if he's ready for the new ad
dition, for all the adjustments that will
have to be made, Robinson laughs,
"Ready as I'm ever gonna be."
Fitting in with the guys was never a big concern
for Nick Robinson when he first set foot onto
Stanford's campus.
"I imagine my teammates look at me as a little
more mature .. .like I'm at a different stage in my
life," Robinson said.
But then again, he's an adjuster.
He's versatile.
And almost four years since his arrival, he's
just one of the guys, although he is Stanford's el
dest player and all his teammates call him "Pops."
But back on that first day, he wasn't your typi
cal wide-eyed freshman.
Robinson arrived to campus at the age of 20
married after spending two years in Maceio,
Brazil while completing his Mormon mission.
He'd been a few places, seen a few things and
already signed two National Letters of Intent, one
when he first graduated from high school in 1998
and the other after he returned from Brazil two
years later.
So needless to say, life at Stanford would take
a little getting used to.
"Stanford, academically, was very different
from what I was doing the past few years.. .1
hadn't been studying," Robinson said. "And I
hadn't played basketball on a regular basis [while
in Brazil] so it was really difficult trying to adjust."
But, as mentioned above, Robinson is an
adjuster as he's shown over and over again

this season.
Easily Stanford's most versatile player, Robin
son can play the small forward position, the point
and the off-guard, allowing Stanford head coach
Mike Montgomery several offensive and defen
sive options.
"I enjoy playing the game of basketball and
that includes playing at every position," Robinson
said. "Being able to handle the ball or post some
body up when I have to ... really allows me to
contribute to the team and my own enjoyment of
the game."
But most of all he's an unselfish player un
doubtedly a sign of maturity and he's by far
and away the most under-appreciated member of
a team chalk full of role players.
In many ways, his persona is emblematic of the
Cardinal's national identity the idea that the
whole, the entirety of the machine, is much more
important than its parts.
And to a certain extent, Robinson's latest on
court adjustment the transition from starter to
sixth man isn't all that new to him.
Last year, when Justin Davis went down with a
sprained knee, Robinson was thrust into the start
ing lineup for several weeks and filled in quite
nicely for Davis until his return.
But that doesn't mean the transition is any eas
ier this time around and while Robinson's certain
ly not complaining about his revised role, the cir
cumstances aren't quite the same either.

The highly-anticipated return of
Childress from injury coupled with
the Cardinal's undefeated record
led to a whole lotta' talk.
Stanford had been perfect up
until that point not perfect in an
"it's impossible to improve" kind of
way, but perfect in the sense that in
the moments that Stanford has des
perately needed to rise to the occa
sion, it has.
What would happen to team
chemistry when Childress returned?
How would he fit in?
What would be the affect on play
er rotation and minutes?
All these questions all assum
ing the inevitability of Childress' re
turn — often inadvertently glossed
over how integral Robinsop had
been up until that point.
