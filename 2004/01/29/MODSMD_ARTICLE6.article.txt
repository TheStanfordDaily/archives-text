## GSC mulls student housing options 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Graduate students and Universi
ty administrators met to look at
prospective changes to the current
lottery system and other housing
policies at the first meeting of the
Graduate Housing Advisory Com
mittee for the 2003-2004 year last
Friday.
According to the ASSU Nomi
nations Commission Web site, "The
goal of the committee is to give
graduate students the opportunity
to raise issues regarding residence
life, to give input into policy issues
and to serve as a resource for staff
members."
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney, who has
served on the committee since its
inception over 20 years ago, de
scribed the hardest part of organiz
ing such a committee as "getting a
group [together] that can represent
all graduate students" and their di
verse needs including single,
couple and family housing.
The student members nominat
ed to this year's committee are Lisa
Marin, Sherry Wang, Gayle Chris
tensen, Maria Gonzalez-Alcantara,
Soubhik Dawn, Amita Chudg-ar
and Laura Cook. They were joined
by administrators from Graduate
Housing Operations, the Graduate
Student Life Office, Student Hous
ing and Residential and Dining En
terprises.
Whitney said that the biggest
challenge in graduate housing is to
help the students 80 percent of
whom return to campus residences
after their first year of guaranteed
housing obtain a desirable as
signment.
According to Marin, who
chaired the committee last year, the
Friday meeting focused on a contin
uous housing assignment proposal
created in last year's committee, as
well as a dynamic housing model,
designed by Gonzalez-Alcantara.
Gonzalez-Alcantara's model,
Marin said, would help "predict
how changes in the market as well
as the university policies and pric
ing would affect students' housing
preferences," using the results of a
small housing survey to be released
later this quarter.
Christensen and Marin recom
mended the continuous assign
ment proposal last year. Accord
ing to a statement they released in
the fall, this system would give stu
dents assigned to on-campus or
off-campus subsidized housing the
option to renew their contracts an
nually.
The plan has already received
the support of the Graduate Stu
dent Council, but is yet to be ap
proved by any University represen
tatives.
Although the committee and the
GSC have "worked hard at devel
oping this proposal and presenting
it to appropriate administrators,"
Marin and Christensen stated that
budget concerns have hindered its
progress, especially since it would
require expanding significantly
upon the 4,500 existing on-campus

graduate student spaces.
Whitney agreed, explaining that
the University incurs a great deal of
debt in continuing to house about
60 percent of its graduate students
a larger proportion than any of
its peer institutions.
Student Housing has nonethe
less managed to open more than
1,300 new bed spaces in on-campus
graduate residences over the past
five years, and continues to identify
sites in Escondido Village where
"infill housing" can take the place
of one- or two-story buildings,
Whitney said.
He added that the building of the
new law school dorm would benefit
all graduate students by alleviating
the on-campus housing crunch.
With an additional 600 off-cam
pus spaces subsidized by the
Provost's office this year, Whitney
claimed that currently, "Anybody
who's tenacious in the summer will
have housing in the fall."
Improving the continuity of
housing, however, requires new
University policy. Marin added that
no major changes in the graduate
lottery would take place until 2006,
as the committee is still trying to
gauge what impact new policies
would have on student housing de
cisions.
Whitney cited equity as a major
concern with proposals for continu
ous housing, since students with
good lottery results their first year
could prevent the less lucky ones
from ever accessing the most popu
lar housing options.
However, he expressed opti
mism that an increase in available
housing will eventually allow many
students to live in the same place
from year to year, with the possi
bility of a "lock-and-go" policy
that would reserve a student's as
signment over the summer months
for a flat fee.
Reducing the turnover rate in
graduate residence occupancy and
the associated moving and cleaning
costs would save both students and
the University money, Whitney
added.
Christensen also hopes to see
"students experience more stability
in housing" as a final outcome of
the discussion carried on by surveys
and committee meetings.
"The students have been very
helpful in shaping these programs,"
Whitney said, despite the difficulty
of getting every proposed idea to
materialize.
Between guaranteeing a first
year of housing to graduate stu
dents, offering them diverse op
tions and maintaining enough
spaces for students to "stay put" in
their residence for multiple years,
Whitney said the work of the com
mittee can be like "moving chess
pieces on a board."
Despite its late start this acade
mic year, the committee will meet
again in two to three weeks, contin
uing its work into spring quarter,
according to Whitney.
Whitney also predicted the cre
ation of an advisory committee for
undergraduate housing in the next
year or two.
