Comedians Scott Blakeman and
Dean Obeidallah used laughter to ad
dress divisive issues facing Jewish and
Arab Americans in last night's "Stand
Up for Peace" comedy event in the
CoHo.
"By bringing everyone together to
laugh, we're setting an example for what
should be going on in the Middle East,"
Blakeman said.
During the event, Obeidallah and
Blakeman related their experiences
growing up as Arab and Jewish Amer
icans, respectively. While speaking
from different cultural backgrounds,
both comedians expressed similar ex
periences with social prejudices and
stereotypes.
"We hoped this event would provide
a new atmosphere to discuss the com
plex and painful issues of Arab and Jew
ish identity in America, topics usually
covered with such seriousness that peo
ple get too angry to listen," said junior
Jonathan Elkin, co-organizer of the
Middle East Issues Dialogue group.
The two comedians also expressed
their opinions on political issues such
as the Patriot Act, the upcoming pres
idential race and the controversies
surrounding U.S. involvement in the
war in Iraq.
Junior Alberto Mann felt that the co
medians' abrasive treatment of conserv
ative policies made the show overtly lib
eral.
"The show gave me some good
laughs, but a lot of the jokes were anti-
Republican," Mann said. "Their humor
seemed more appropriate for a Democ
ratic convention."
Junior Imad Kharbush voiced similar

frustrations with the way political issues
were addressed.
"I was hoping that the comedians
would focus less on Bush and tackle
some of the deeper issues of the Pales
tinian-Jewish conflict," Kharbush said.
The concept for this touring act arose
when Obeidallah and Blakeman partici
pated in charity shows for a summer
camp called "Seeds of Peace," Obeidal
lah said. This program encouraged in
creasing cultural and political under
standing among Israeli and Palestinian
teenagers.
"We were very pleased that [Jews]
and Palestinians could laugh together,"
Obeidallah said. "These shows we are
doing now are an outgrowth of the
camp's purpose."
Both comedians have extensive ex
perience in the field of stand-up com
edy. Obeidallah has appeared on
shows such as ABC's "20 / 20" and
MSNBC's "Nachman." He is also the
co-creator of the New York Arab-
American Comedy Festival and has
written several comedy sketches for
"Late Night with Conan O'Brien."
Blakeman has made numerous na
tional television appearances, per
formed at the Just for Laughs Festival
in Montreal and has written sketches
for "Saturday Night Live."
When asked about their love for
comedy, both comedians expressed
tremendous enthusiasm.
"I love my job because it is creative
and I enjoy making people laugh,"
Obeidallah said.
"I come from a family filled with
humor, so I've always liked getting up in
front of people," Blakeman said. "To be
able to make people laugh and love
doing it is a dream that I'm thrilled has
come true."

As the blood-red rays of the dying sun sunk into the west, two
traveling bards regaled a group of CoHo patrons, relieving
them of their cares out for an instant.
