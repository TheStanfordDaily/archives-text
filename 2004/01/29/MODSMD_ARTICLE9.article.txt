# Weak dollar troubles students overseas
## 
### CORINA YEN DESK EDITOR 
The dollar's increasingly weak value against the euro has required stu
dents abroad to pinch their pennies more than in the past, although it has
not affected the Overseas Study Programs themselves, University officials
say.
The exchange rate is currently around 1.25 euros to $1 as the dollar con
tinues to sink in value, having lost around 60 percent to the euro in the past
two years, according to Reuters. The euro hit a record of 1.29 against the
dollar earlier this month.
"Studying abroad is expensive as it is, and having to deal with the unfa
vorable exchange rate makes you think twice about traveling, entrance fees
to museums or monuments, trying new foods, etc., all the things that make
being abroad so great in the first place," said junior Jen Chen, currently
studying in Paris. "You do them anyway because they're why you're here,
but it's always in the back of your mind."
Junior Lindsay Coleman, currently studying abroad in Florence, agreed
that students have been forced to take the weak dollar into account while
shopping.
"I am forced to be frugal with certain purchases, and it is hard in a city
that is surrounded by fashionable Italian shops," Coleman said.
Linda Campani, director of the Florence program, said that the dollar's
weakness has not had significant effects on program enrollment or students'
daily lives. Campani explained that because students live with families
abroad who cook their meals or give them a lunch allowance in euros, the
major everyday expenses of housing and food are unaffected by exchange
rates. Meanwhile, the home office of the Overseas Studies Programs still
has to absorb the effects of the low exchange rate.
"The continued weakness of the U.S. dollar is an important issue for any
one that is purchasing foreign items," said John Mallet, the finance manag
er for Overseas Studies Programs. "As we will continue to run centers over
seas, this will always be an issue for us. We just become more challenged on
how to respond to it."
Mallet is responsible for budgeting the costs of the different locations out
of the amount allotted by the University for overseas programs and also
works with the directors at the various centers to manage expenses. He said
that while all the programs are affected by the cost of doing business in local

communities, they have used currency reserve funds collected from better
economic times to balance the exchange rate.
Students who go abroad through the program pay normal Stanford tu
ition and housing fees, so these price are unaffected by currency exchange
rates.
"With any given amount of money that they bring with them for their
own entertainment and personnel travel, this will tend to go less far," Mal
let said. "However, we see it as a very individual thing with each student, as
their own personal lifestyles and spending habits vary considerably."
Coleman and Chen both agree that they have become thriftier in light of
the weak dollar.
Coleman said she noticed as soon as she arrived that many things, such
as soda, laundry and clothes, were more expensive. So while meeting basic

needs has not been a problem, Cole
man said the weak dollar has made
it hard to buy other things.
"I waste far less money in terms
of impulse purchases or consum
ables," Chen said. "I definitely try to
be as frugal as possible so that I can
use my money toward more con
crete things, such as traveling."
The effect on weekend trips and
excursions in the local area, a high
light of the programs, has been sig
nificant.
"From what I have heard from
my friends who studied here last
year, they definitely had much more
freedom with regards to where they
could go and what they could do be
cause the exchange rate was much
better," Coleman said.

Chen said she and fellow stu
dents face a tradeoff between buy
ing food and traveling.
"Many of us complain about the
tradeoff between things like food
and things like train fare for
daytrips," she said. "We all want to
travel, but we spend a lot of time try
ing to find the cheapest way to do it.
We don't eat as well as we'd like to
as often as we'd like to."
Despite the weak dollar forcing
Coleman to keep tighter purse
strings, it has not kept her from en
joying the program.
"The weak dollar only puts a
small damper on my wonderful ex
perience here," she said.
"We all know we're probably
never going to get another chance
to be abroad in a non-vacation set
ting, so we still try to see and do as
much as possible, just while paying
a bit more attention to prices,"
Chen said.
