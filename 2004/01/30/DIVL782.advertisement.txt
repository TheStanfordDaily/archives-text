/S Kinda sad that
Volume 224 is over, huh? I
mean, think of all the bridges
these editors built and all the
groups on campus they J
befriended. S
— I don't
think the administration
/ has ever felt more of a bond with \
an editorial staff before, auite frankly.
k 1 can't even begin to list the names ofy
' those who were really touched /
by their work.
Too bad we couldn't
' pull our weight around here. \
There they are, extending hand
after hand to the community, and
\ all we do is talk about tv and
high. God, we suck.
/ sorry, 1 wasn't \
listening. Those eyes are
looking right at us, and
Vit's really creeping /
•v. me out.
