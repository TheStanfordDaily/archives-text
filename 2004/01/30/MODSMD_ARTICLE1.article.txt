### VAUHINI VARA MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford ranked ninth last year among medium
sized universities whose graduates volunteer in the
Peace Corps, according to a recent report by the or
ganization.
With 36 graduates serving in the Peace Corps,
Stanford moved up one notch in the rankings, from
tenth place the previous year, when 32 Stanford grad
uates were volunteers.
The rise in involvement of Stanford graduates
could be related to an increase in student interest in
international issues. In the 2002-2003 academic year,
120 students graduated with degrees in international
relations the highest level in at least 10 years. In
contrast, during the high-tech boom of the 19905, the
number of international relations degrees conferred
hovered between 80 and 90.
"I think that many students realize that Peace
Corps experience can lead to interesting careers in
world affairs," Dennis McMahon, a Peace Corps
spokesperson, told The Stanford Report.
According to McMahon, the Peace Corps recruits
actively at Stanford. Representatives from the organi
zation often visit campus to speak to students who are

studying specific topics that are in demand in the
Peace Corps.
A history of Peace Corps involvement
The Peace Corps recognized Stanford for the first
time last year, after it changed its ranking system to in
clude medium-sized and small schools.
"Before that, it was a listing of all schools, and it
was usually the largest schools that ranked highest,"
McMahon said. "So, this system is much more equi
table and recognizes the contributions of schools with
smaller undergrad enrollments."
However, the involvement of Stanford graduates
in the Peace Corps is not a new development; the Uni
versity ranks No. 12 on a list of colleges for the all-time
number of volunteers it has yielded. Since the organi
zation was created in 1961, the Peace Corps has at
tracted 1,277 Stanford graduates. UC-Berkeley ranks
first on the all-time list, with 3,173 volunteers.
The Peace Corps has programs in 75 countries
around the world, the majority of which are in Africa,
Latin America, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia,
Central Asia and the Pacific. Volunteers typically
spend two years in a given country, plus three months
of training.
