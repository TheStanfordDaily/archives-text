# THE
						STANFORD DAILY Editor's Note
## Daily Editor says farewell 
### 
I was 11, maybe 12, when I moved out of
my childhood home. The U-Haul was
parked in front and my father slapped
his hand against his thighs. "Let's go.'"
We were late. But for what? In the next mo
ment, the car pulled away and we left the
neighborhood of my most vivid adolescent
memories: tadpole-filled creeks, snow an
gels, scooter rides, trick-or-treating in plastic
K-Mart costumes.
As a teenager, I moved often — into new
cities, schools and versions of myself. Then
came Stanford: the swaying palm trees, a
square dorm room and the chance to put
down roots. Three Octobers ago, after din
ner, I walked down Santa Teresa Avenue
and, in the shadows, discovered a decrepit
building with a triangle roof that glowed.
It was the Stanford Daily office. The
floors were sticky, the lighting was dim and
one editor smelled suspiciously of pot.
I was home at last.
So here I am: on my last night as editor in
chief of a newspaper that has educated me
more than any Stanford instructor. I sit in my
old leather chair; in my favorite green
sweater; in my office that's never been more
cluttered with old press releases and wrin
kled copy.
Past editors in chief have described The
Stanford Daily as an institution with a legacy
that transforms ambitious writers into jour
nalists. Others have suggested that it is a col
lege newspaper that covers local events.
But is it just that?
For the reporters and editors who work
at The Stanford Daily, this paper is not a
profession. It is a livelihood, it is torture, it is
free dinners and bottles of beer, it is the so-

porific walk home after a 12-hour work
shift. It is all the grainy colors of post-ado
lescence — the drama of a secret crush, the
anxiety of planning for the future, the brim
ming energy of a moment's genius —
against the backdrop of newsroom catastro
phes. There are breaking stories, broken
computers, deadlines, disenchanted readers
and copy littered with errors.
It is overwhelming and it is exhausting. It
is the life of a student journalist, a precarious
balance between classes and eight other com
mitments.
And I loved every moment of it.
In a few hours, we will send the final issue
to bed. I will sweep up the press releases. I
will wipe food stains off my desk. And I will
pack up some of my old most prized posses
sion: a tattered AP Stylebook, an old Donald
Duck poster and four years of newspaper
clippings.
The other editors will have gone home
and the newsroom will be empty — except
for me, the faint smell of cigarette smoke and
years of memories. Thank you to all who con
tributed to Volume 224. Tonight I will swal
low a gulp of air and turn out the lights for the
last time.

Ramin Setoodeh
Editor in Chief, volume 224
