## UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN Anti-Semitism has not gone away 
### SARAH LUSTBADER 
If asked, would you reveal your re
ligion? As a Catholic from Texas
introducing yourself on your first
day in Branner, you probably
would. As a Jewish reporter in Pak
istan, maybe not.
Last Friday, Steven LeVine, a for
eign correspondent for the Wall Street
Journal and a visiting fellow at the
Center on Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law described a simi
lar discussion between himself and
Daniel Pearl, his former reporting
partner. At the time, LeVine had ad
vocated keeping religion private.
Pearl responded, "I would never hide
my faith."
It is difficult to contemplate Pearl's
idealism today except in light of his
death, which LeVine maintains was
unrelated to his religion.
French philosopher and journalist
Bernard-Henri Levy, author of "Who
Killed Daniel Pearl," disagrees. He
believes that Pearl's religion did play a
role in his kidnapping. Indeed, in the
Muslim town where Pearl was work
ing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories
were routine. The Times Book Re
view also described his videotaped de
capitation as the ritual slaughter of an
American Jew. Pearl famously pro
claimed his heritage in the moments
before his execution at the hands of Is
lamic terrorists.
Since the beginning of the second
Infata and the Sept. 11 attacks a year
later, there has been an undeniable
surge in global anti-Semitism, and the
issue of when to reveal one's identity
has become relevant to many Jews,
not only foreign correspondents.

During the few months I spent in
Europe this fall, it seemed that every
day I would open the International
Herald Tribune and find another ver
bal or violent assault against Jewish
people.
In October, Malaysian leader Ma
hathir bin Muhammad received a
standing ovation during a speech in
which he asserted, "Jews rule the
world by proxy." When criticized by a
handful of world leaders, he repeated
his statement, arguing that the con
demnation only proved him right.
A high-ranking German parlia
mentarian then compared Jews during
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution to the
Nazis during WWII, saying they could
be described as a "race of perpetra
tors." He, too, refused to apologize for
his statements.
I remember distinctly a Sunday in
mid-November, when I read that two
synagogues in Istanbul had just been
bombed and a Jewish school in France
was burned down.
These separate acts of terror I en
countered against a backdrop of over
whelming anti-Israel sentiment. The
distinction between Jews and Israelis,
blurry enough here in the United
States, is much murkier in Europe.
How else to explain a public opin
ion poll among E.U. citizens in which
they named Israel the world's num
ber-one threat to world peace? Israel,
more so than Iraq, North Korea and
the favorite of the French the Unit
ed States?
Thus, the "Palestina Liberia" graf
fiti around Florence was somewhat
unnerving; more so the swastikas.
When meeting Italian students, I won
dered what they would think if they

knew I was Jewish. I never hid my
faith, but I did not jump at the oppor
tunity to share it.
The hatred was most palpable in
Slovenia, where violent anti-Semitic
slogans were strewn everywhere. One
Slovenian university student (a politi
cal science major) explained matter
of-factly to my friend exactly why he
hated the Jews. She pointed to me. He
shrugged and repeated himself.
I had no more desire to talk about
religion.
Anti-Semitism is everywhere. It
has often been described as a "virus"
that periodically infects nations that
house Jews, particularly European na
tions. In the past, Jews have been
hated for not having their own state;
now, it seems most of the hatred is di
rected toward the Jewish state.
I feel comfortable talking about my.
religion here, because where resent
ment exists, it is manifested in particu
larly heated debates about the Middle
East or seemingly benign jabs about
thriftiness and big noses. In Western
Europe and even more so in Eastern
Europe, blatant expressions of anti-
Semitism are proliferating. They are
also increasingly accepted. (Wasn't it
Berlusconi who recently asserted that
Mussolini never killed anybody?)
The more time I spent in Europe,
the less inclined I felt to speak. Any
notion of changing people's views van
ished. I do not know how Daniel Pearl
ever hoped to share his Judaism while
reporting from a small Muslim town in
Pakistan. He must have been a brave 1
man.

the less inclined I felt to speak. Any

Pakistan. He must have been a brave 1
man.

If asked, would you reveal your re
ligion? As a Catholic from Texas
introducing yourself on your first
day in Branner, you probably
would. As a Jewish reporter in Pak
istan, maybe not.
Last Friday, Steven LeVine, a for
eign correspondent for the Wall Street
Journal and a visiting fellow at the
Center on Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law described a simi
lar discussion between himself and
Daniel Pearl, his former reporting
partner. At the time, LeVine had ad
vocated keeping religion private.
Pearl responded, "I would never hide
my faith."
It is difficult to contemplate Pearl's
idealism today except in light of his
death, which LeVine maintains was
unrelated to his religion.
French philosopher and journalist
Bernard-Henri Levy, author of "Who
Killed Daniel Pearl," disagrees. He
believes that Pearl's religion did play a
role in his kidnapping. Indeed, in the
Muslim town where Pearl was work
ing, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories
were routine. The Times Book Re
view also described his videotaped de
capitation as the ritual slaughter of an
American Jew. Pearl famously pro
claimed his heritage in the moments
before his execution at the hands of Is
lamic terrorists.
Since the beginning of the second
Infata and the Sept. 11 attacks a year
later, there has been an undeniable
surge in global anti-Semitism, and the
issue of when to reveal one's identity
has become relevant to many Jews,
not only foreign correspondents.

During the few months I spent in
Europe this fall, it seemed that every
day I would open the International
Herald Tribune and find another ver
bal or violent assault against Jewish
people.
In October, Malaysian leader Ma
hathir bin Muhammad received a
standing ovation during a speech in
which he asserted, "Jews rule the
world by proxy." When criticized by a
handful of world leaders, he repeated
his statement, arguing that the con
demnation only proved him right.
A high-ranking German parlia
mentarian then compared Jews during
the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution to the
Nazis during WWII, saying they could
be described as a "race of perpetra
tors." He, too, refused to apologize for
his statements.
I remember distinctly a Sunday in
mid-November, when I read that two
synagogues in Istanbul had just been
bombed and a Jewish school in France
was burned down.
These separate acts of terror I en
countered against a backdrop of over
whelming anti-Israel sentiment. The
distinction between Jews and Israelis,
blurry enough here in the United
States, is much murkier in Europe.
How else to explain a public opin
ion poll among E.U. citizens in which
they named Israel the world's num
ber-one threat to world peace? Israel,
more so than Iraq, North Korea and
the favorite of the French the Unit
ed States?
Thus, the "Palestina Liberia" graf
fiti around Florence was somewhat
unnerving; more so the swastikas.
When meeting Italian students, I won
dered what they would think if they

knew I was Jewish. I never hid my
faith, but I did not jump at the oppor
tunity to share it.
The hatred was most palpable in
Slovenia, where violent anti-Semitic
slogans were strewn everywhere. One
Slovenian university student (a politi
cal science major) explained matter
of-factly to my friend exactly why he
hated the Jews. She pointed to me. He
shrugged and repeated himself.
I had no more desire to talk about
religion.
Anti-Semitism is everywhere. It
has often been described as a "virus"
that periodically infects nations that
house Jews, particularly European na
tions. In the past, Jews have been
hated for not having their own state;
now, it seems most of the hatred is di
rected toward the Jewish state.
I feel comfortable talking about my.
religion here, because where resent
ment exists, it is manifested in particu
larly heated debates about the Middle
East or seemingly benign jabs about
thriftiness and big noses. In Western
Europe and even more so in Eastern
Europe, blatant expressions of anti-
Semitism are proliferating. They are
also increasingly accepted. (Wasn't it
Berlusconi who recently asserted that
Mussolini never killed anybody?)
