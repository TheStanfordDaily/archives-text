## Often the real news isn't news at all 
### 
I do not know the Karanastasis
family personally. They are the
San Jose couple who were reunit
ed with their golden retriever,
Bella, last week. The family lost their
dog and another family adopted the
dog before returning it to the original
owners. Judging by letters to the editor,
the decision by the adoptive pet family
to return the dog was a popular one.
Watching the story grow to literally
swamp the letters, pages for three days
and capture front page headlines on
Thursday, one must conclude that the
story was really big news.
I also do not know any of the three
children around the world that will die
from fully preventable childhood
measles in the time it takes you to read
my editorial. According to the World
Health Organization, childhood
measles, which is of course only one of
many preventable diseases that strike
children in the predominantly poor na
tions of the world, killed 745,000 chil
dren in 2001. Each one of those lives
could have been saved by a vaccination
that costs less than 25 cents. Given the
lack of attention to that story, one must
conclude that was not news at all.
The case of the single diseased cow
from Washington which has so alarmed
us over the last two months has been big
news because of its "potentially" devas

taring consequences. The fact is that
less than 150 people have died from
"Mad Cow Disease" since it was first di
agnosed 18 years ago. That's about the
same number of people that will die
today in traffic accidents in this country.
According to the National Safety
Council nearly one third of those
deaths could be prevented if the cars,
occupants were to wear seat belts. Of
course, that is not news either.
What is news is that we frequently
focus our attention on the wrong sorts
of things. Just as surely as we make
mountains out of molehills, we make
molehills out of mountains. We sensa
tionalize the trivial and trivialize or ig
nore altogether items that should con
cern us. We view the world not so
much through rose-colored glasses as
through distortion goggles.
Newspapers contribute to our dis
tortions, primarily by causing us to
look in the wrong directions. For ex
ample, as a result of the dog nonstory
negative attention was focused on the
Humane Society and policies that have
served them admirably well for years
are now under attack and subject to re
vision. Sales of pet microchips in
creased by 26 percent in Santa Clara
County last week, which may be a good
thing, but nevertheless shows how the
public,s paranoia may be fed. The

adoptive family was, according to one
nelwspaper, "vilified across the na
tion," and their 10-year-old daughter
was harassed at school by classmates.
Our cognitive misperceptions have
important consequences for the ways
in which we view the world and for the
manner in which the world is reflected
back to us through the news. As a high
school social studies teacher, I fre
quently asked my classes to examine
newspapers to determine how the pa
pers reported local, state, national, and
international news. The students con
cluded that regardless of the news re
porting source, that newspapers em
phasized disaster and conflict in inter
national news reports, political news at
the national and state levels, and
human interest stories at the local level.
The consequence is that we tend to
view foreigners with distrust and sus
picion. What is more, we begin to be
lieve that "those" people are not like
us, that their problems are far more in
tractable and not worth worrying
about. Unfortunately, it becomes way
too easy for us to devote our energies
to a lost local dog, rather than to dedi
cating ourselves to a two-bits foreign
measles solution.
