## How to really help endangered species 
### 
It's great news that most Ameri
cans now identify themselves as
environmentalists. Unfortu
nately, a small number have
embraced environmentalism with a
religious fervor, basing their beliefs
more on faith and dogma than on
data and science.
The agenda of these radical envi
ronmentalists has less to do with pro
tecting the environment and more to
do with an antipathy toward business,
profits and certain technologies. Iron
ically, their efforts to achieve their
own narrow vision of what consti
tutes a "good society" are often inim
ical to protecting the environment.
For example, exploiting a techni
cality that links the Endangered
Species Act (ESA) to pesticide regis
tration, environmental groups have
filed a spate of nuisance lawsuits that
attempt to prevent the Environmen
tal Protection Agency (EPA) from
registering or reregistering pesticides.
The environmental groups allege
that, by failing to consult with the
agencies that administer the ESA
the National Marine Fisheries Ser
vice and the Fish and Wildlife Service
before registering a pesticide, the
EPA has not complied fully with the
law, despite the fact that the Fish and
Wildlife Service's Endangered
Species Act Consultation Handbook
makes it clear it does not have the au

thority to "force an action agency to
consult." Even the custodians of the
ESA do not feel that they have the
power to compel consultations de
spite current regulations seeming to
require such an exchange.
These suits are not substantive but
procedural; no actual damage to
threatened or endangered species
from the EPA's actions has been
demonstrated. And never mind that
pesticides control vermin, increase
agricultural productivity, reduce the
need to convert wild lands into farm
land, prevent the growth of harmful
fungi and bacteria on crops, reduce
prices to consumers and undergo ex
haustive testing and regulatory re
view to ensure their safety.
Although the ESA requires all
federal agencies to take into account
possible adverse effects on endan
gered species, Congress recognized
the value of pesticides by directing
that pesticide registration by the
EPA (under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide and Rodenticide Act)
should "minimize the impacts to per
sons engaged in agricultural food
and fiber commodity production
and other affected pesticide users
and applicators."
The various government agencies
involved have recently devised a solu
tion to the procedural problem: Be
cause the EPA boasts vast and com

prehensive experience in assessing
the potential risks of pesticides to
plant and animal species — including
those listed as endangered under the
ESA — the Fish and Wildlife Service
and National Marine Fisheries Ser
vice have proposed a rule that will
eliminate the requirement for the
EPA to consult with other agencies on
pesticide registration. This technical
revision will not only assure greater
consistency in the assessment of pesti
cides but, by freeing regulators to
more expeditiously license environ
mentally friendly products, will also
better protect endangered species and*
their habitats. And, of course, it will
render the lawsuits moot.
This change will not fix other ex
isting flaws in the ESA, but it will at
least prevent this legislation from en
abling activists to interfere with the
development and registration of an
essential class of agricultural and con
sumer products.
