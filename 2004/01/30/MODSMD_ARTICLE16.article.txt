# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Oops, where'd the money go? Stanford wrestlers say, 'It ain't me' 
### 
Some folks are born silver spoon in
hand. Lord, don't they help them
selves. The University Athletic
Department recently toyed with
the idea of providing stipends for Stan
ford football players to cover daily ex
penses like groceries, toiletries and Tri
Delt debaucheries. Nevermind the luxu
ries already included: a fleet of 70-plus
full boat scholarships, exclusive access to
workout facilities, hotel stays on nights
before HOME games .. .
Unfortunately, to anyone looking to
rant about excess in college football: that
rotten old stump on which you're at
tempting to stand is crumbling the way of
the cookie. The football team generates
its own wealth, and, thus, has the right to
waste it.
What? You thought I was going to
complain or something? You know that's
not my style.
You know that, right?
Well then. As my brother, Jeremy,
says when I gleefully return home for the
holidays, "To hell with you."
Every once and a while, you gotta
throw the campus a bone, stare at the sun
shine for a bit. According to me, one of
the greatest sources of light on campus is
the current success of Stanford Wrestling.
It's our very own "triumph in the face of
adversity" tale.
Before I tell it, however, it'll help to
provide some background on a sport that
too many people are ignorant about.
Wrestling dates back tens of thou
sands of years and can be found on every
continent except the South Pole where
University President John Hennessy
Fed Exes Stanford traditions year to
year. It has been depicted in cave draw
ings, referenced in the Old Testament,
practiced in the original Ancient Greek

Olympic games. It crosses gender lines,
including both male and other. PETA

should be proud that it
even breaks animal bar
riers in allowing alliga
tors in on the action.
Say that twice, like
super fast.
The sport boasts 11
presidents including
Abraham Lincoln,
George Washington,
Theodore Roosevelt
and Dwight D. Eisen

hower; some comedic legends such as
Robin Williams, John Belushi, Chris Far
ley, Jay Leno, Bill Maher and Paul
Reubens; Hollywood superstars such as
Kirk Douglas, Ashton Kutcher, Jay
Mohr, Seth Stephens and Tom Cruise;
and musical geniuses like Kurt Cobain,
Maynard James Keenan, Ludacris and
Garth Brooks. And O.J. Simpson
NEVER wrestled.
But its celebrities are less a function of
its tendency to appeal to outstanding in
dividuals than its ability to create them.
Wrestling teaches lessons that apply to all
aspects of our lives. When two opponents
step out onto the mat, they bring only the
weapons they've amassed through a pro
cess of grueling work and diligence.
Chance is not a player. Nothing gets
snagged by goal posts or greedy fan, no
such thing as equipment advantages and
the wind can't carry shit.
It's not some contrived game that
some dude made up so he could be good
at something. Like water polo, that stupid
little game where you close your eyes and
try to find people in a pool. Wrestling is
natural and simulates combat. It's a high
variable sport, where a competitor needs
to be quick, agile, strong, conditioned,

strategic, focused, creative, and insane,
parched, and hungry. No, it ain't easy and
that's why it's popularity is growing in
mostly all domains. The number of high
school wrestlers increases by 7,000 each
year.
But since 1972, the growth of the sport
has been stunted in one significant area:
NCAA competition. Title IX, a measure
taken to correct for gender inequality has
taken its toll, eliminating 40 percent of
college programs three times the total
number of water polo teams in Div. 1
competition. While some schools manage
to maintain their programs, like how Ne
braska saved men's wrestling by adding
women's bowling and women's rifle, that
option is restricted to universities with
athletic departments oozing with revenue
from men's football and basketball the
only sports that seem to generate more
than they absorb.
The Stanford athletic machine is simi
larly fueled by the prosperity of its foot
ball and basketball programs. When it
comes to teams reaping the benefits, how
ever, Stanford wrestling is no fortunate
one. University funding was cut years
ago, a compassionate decision to wither
the program slowly, like pinching the in
travenous. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
But WAIT! What you say? The team is
alive?
Hallelujah! The team is alive!
Not only is Stanford wrestling alive,
it's kicking ass. Eight of the 10 starters
have winning records, they've placed six
finalists in the recent Aggie Open with
four champs, three grapplers are nation
ally ranked, and they just last week de
feated Cal Poly in dual meet for the first
time in four years. Oh, and Cal Poly is
ranked this year. Booyah!
Here's some silver lining for a golden

year: Team captain Matt Gentry will be
representing the West Coast in the
NWCA All-Star classic where he'll pit his
number three standing ranking against
the nation's number two from Ohio. Oh,
and former Cardinal wrestler Patricia Mi
randa is poised to snag a gold medal at
this summer's Olympics when
women's wrestling will be offered for the
first time ever. It just don't stop ...
Yet they subsist on a meager lump of
cash comprised of hard-earned alumni
dollars and merchandise sales. How do
they make ends meet?
They spend Sunday mornings tidying
Stanford Stadium to make necessary
funds to bolster their schedule. They
counter the winter break boot from hous
ing by spending weeks living out of suit
cases and crowded in sleeping bags on the
floors of a few welcoming hosts in order
to train. They limit themselves to less
than two scholarships to disperse among
35 members, which means they don't take
free books for granted like some of the
other teams. These guys know that victo
ry will compensate them and for now,
passion suffices.
This isn't lemonade out of lemons.
This is water into chardonnay. Seemingly
impossible, yet there before our very
eyes.
There has to be more to the story than
talent or hunger or determination. While
you can't discount the skill set of the 35
members of the team, you have to ac
knowledge that ability is uniform at the
D-l level. It takes more than a band of
warriors to triumph on a battlefield
that's brimming with them. No, here is a
peculiar alchemy of the ordinary athlete.
I believe that the magic recipe involves
the wizardry of head coach Steve Buddie
and assistant coaches Jay Jackson and

Kevin Klemm.
I have had the pleasure of being
coached by Steve and Jay. I was very hes
itant about wrestling when I came here,
and so my departure from the team was
inevitable. But it came two years later
than it should have, due to those two guys
alone. You'll have more luck striking oil
on campus than finding people who are
more respectful and encouraging. They
deserve this emerging age of glory.
This year's performance hints at a for
mula of dynastic consequence. It foretells
a future of financially independent colle
giate wrestling, and the possibility that
success and self-sufficiency need not be
mutually exclusive.
Perhaps this is all a blessing. When
they reap the rewards of big showings at
both the PAC-10 and NCAA champi
onships this year, they'll be free of the
burden of other people to thank. This
team has come a long way with a deficit of
positive publicity and hardly a tinge of
campus support.
Tonight the Stanford Wrestling team
faces off against Cal State Fullerton at 6
p.m. in the Ford Center. Go see what I'm
talking about. Watch Matt Gentry domi
nate his opponent with the fluidity of an
angry ocean. Witness Luis Vendrell's re
lentless opposition or Brad Metzler's
technical virtuosity. See Imad Kharbush's
skyworks as tosses his opponents like
around confetti at Mardi Gras. Steve, Jay,
Kevin and the entire roster deserve
packed gym tonight, so bring your Stan
ford body down.
And buy a T-shirt while you're at it.
The black ones are wicked cool.

Some folks are born silver spoon in
hand. Lord, don't they help them
selves. The University Athletic
Department recently toyed with
the idea of providing stipends for Stan
ford football players to cover daily ex
penses like groceries, toiletries and Tri
Delt debaucheries. Nevermind the luxu
ries already included: a fleet of 70-plus
full boat scholarships, exclusive access to
workout facilities, hotel stays on nights
before HOME games .. .
Unfortunately, to anyone looking to
rant about excess in college football: that
rotten old stump on which you're at
tempting to stand is crumbling the way of
the cookie. The football team generates
its own wealth, and, thus, has the right to
waste it.
What? You thought I was going to
complain or something? You know that's
not my style.
You know that, right?
Well then. As my brother, Jeremy,
says when I gleefully return home for the
holidays, "To hell with you."
Every once and a while, you gotta
throw the campus a bone, stare at the sun
shine for a bit. According to me, one of
the greatest sources of light on campus is
the current success of Stanford Wrestling.
It's our very own "triumph in the face of
adversity" tale.
Before I tell it, however, it'll help to
provide some background on a sport that
too many people are ignorant about.
Wrestling dates back tens of thou
sands of years and can be found on every
continent except the South Pole where
University President John Hennessy
Fed Exes Stanford traditions year to
year. It has been depicted in cave draw
ings, referenced in the Old Testament,
practiced in the original Ancient Greek

Olympic games. It crosses gender lines,
including both male and other. PETA

should be proud that it
even breaks animal bar
riers in allowing alliga
tors in on the action.
Say that twice, like
super fast.
The sport boasts 11
presidents including
Abraham Lincoln,
George Washington,
Theodore Roosevelt
and Dwight D. Eisen

hower; some comedic legends such as
Robin Williams, John Belushi, Chris Far
ley, Jay Leno, Bill Maher and Paul
Reubens; Hollywood superstars such as
Kirk Douglas, Ashton Kutcher, Jay
Mohr, Seth Stephens and Tom Cruise;
and musical geniuses like Kurt Cobain,
Maynard James Keenan, Ludacris and
Garth Brooks. And O.J. Simpson
NEVER wrestled.
But its celebrities are less a function of
its tendency to appeal to outstanding in
dividuals than its ability to create them.
Wrestling teaches lessons that apply to all
aspects of our lives. When two opponents
step out onto the mat, they bring only the
weapons they've amassed through a pro
cess of grueling work and diligence.
Chance is not a player. Nothing gets
snagged by goal posts or greedy fan, no
such thing as equipment advantages and
the wind can't carry shit.
It's not some contrived game that
some dude made up so he could be good
at something. Like water polo, that stupid
little game where you close your eyes and
try to find people in a pool. Wrestling is
natural and simulates combat. It's a high
variable sport, where a competitor needs
to be quick, agile, strong, conditioned,

strategic, focused, creative, and insane,
parched, and hungry. No, it ain't easy and
that's why it's popularity is growing in
mostly all domains. The number of high
school wrestlers increases by 7,000 each
year.
But since 1972, the growth of the sport
has been stunted in one significant area:
NCAA competition. Title IX, a measure
taken to correct for gender inequality has
taken its toll, eliminating 40 percent of
college programs three times the total
number of water polo teams in Div. 1
competition. While some schools manage
to maintain their programs, like how Ne
braska saved men's wrestling by adding
women's bowling and women's rifle, that
option is restricted to universities with
athletic departments oozing with revenue
from men's football and basketball the
only sports that seem to generate more
than they absorb.
The Stanford athletic machine is simi
larly fueled by the prosperity of its foot
ball and basketball programs. When it
comes to teams reaping the benefits, how
ever, Stanford wrestling is no fortunate
one. University funding was cut years
ago, a compassionate decision to wither
the program slowly, like pinching the in
travenous. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
But WAIT! What you say? The team is
alive?
Hallelujah! The team is alive!
Not only is Stanford wrestling alive,
it's kicking ass. Eight of the 10 starters
have winning records, they've placed six
finalists in the recent Aggie Open with
four champs, three grapplers are nation
ally ranked, and they just last week de
feated Cal Poly in dual meet for the first
time in four years. Oh, and Cal Poly is
ranked this year. Booyah!
Here's some silver lining for a golden

year: Team captain Matt Gentry will be
representing the West Coast in the
NWCA All-Star classic where he'll pit his
number three standing ranking against
the nation's number two from Ohio. Oh,
and former Cardinal wrestler Patricia Mi
randa is poised to snag a gold medal at
this summer's Olympics when
women's wrestling will be offered for the
first time ever. It just don't stop ...
Yet they subsist on a meager lump of
cash comprised of hard-earned alumni
dollars and merchandise sales. How do
they make ends meet?
They spend Sunday mornings tidying
Stanford Stadium to make necessary
funds to bolster their schedule. They
counter the winter break boot from hous
ing by spending weeks living out of suit
cases and crowded in sleeping bags on the
floors of a few welcoming hosts in order
to train. They limit themselves to less
than two scholarships to disperse among
35 members, which means they don't take
free books for granted like some of the
other teams. These guys know that victo
ry will compensate them and for now,
passion suffices.
This isn't lemonade out of lemons.
This is water into chardonnay. Seemingly
impossible, yet there before our very
eyes.
There has to be more to the story than
talent or hunger or determination. While
you can't discount the skill set of the 35
members of the team, you have to ac
knowledge that ability is uniform at the
D-l level. It takes more than a band of
warriors to triumph on a battlefield
that's brimming with them. No, here is a
peculiar alchemy of the ordinary athlete.
I believe that the magic recipe involves
the wizardry of head coach Steve Buddie
and assistant coaches Jay Jackson and

Kevin Klemm.
I have had the pleasure of being
coached by Steve and Jay. I was very hes
itant about wrestling when I came here,

comes to teams reaping the benefits, how
ever, Stanford wrestling is no fortunate
one. University funding was cut years
ago, a compassionate decision to wither
the program slowly, like pinching the in
travenous. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
But WAIT! What you say? The team is
alive?
Hallelujah! The team is alive!
Not only is Stanford wrestling alive,
it's kicking ass. Eight of the 10 starters
have winning records, they've placed six
finalists in the recent Aggie Open with
four champs, three grapplers are nation
ally ranked, and they just last week de
feated Cal Poly in dual meet for the first
time in four years. Oh, and Cal Poly is
ranked this year. Booyah!
Here's some silver lining for a golden

year: Team captain Matt Gentry will be
representing the West Coast in the
NWCA All-Star classic where he'll pit his
number three standing ranking against
the nation's number two from Ohio. Oh,
and former Cardinal wrestler Patricia Mi
randa is poised to snag a gold medal at
this summer's Olympics when
women's wrestling will be offered for the
first time ever. It just don't stop ...
Yet they subsist on a meager lump of
cash comprised of hard-earned alumni
dollars and merchandise sales. How do
they make ends meet?
They spend Sunday mornings tidying
Stanford Stadium to make necessary
funds to bolster their schedule. They
counter the winter break boot from hous
ing by spending weeks living out of suit
cases and crowded in sleeping bags on the
floors of a few welcoming hosts in order
to train. They limit themselves to less
than two scholarships to disperse among
35 members, which means they don't take
free books for granted like some of the
other teams. These guys know that victo
ry will compensate them and for now,
passion suffices.
This isn't lemonade out of lemons.
This is water into chardonnay. Seemingly
impossible, yet there before our very
eyes.
There has to be more to the story than
talent or hunger or determination. While
you can't discount the skill set of the 35
members of the team, you have to ac
knowledge that ability is uniform at the
D-l level. It takes more than a band of
warriors to triumph on a battlefield
that's brimming with them. No, here is a
peculiar alchemy of the ordinary athlete.
I believe that the magic recipe involves
the wizardry of head coach Steve Buddie
and assistant coaches Jay Jackson and

Kevin Klemm.
I have had the pleasure of being
coached by Steve and Jay. I was very hes
itant about wrestling when I came here,
and so my departure from the team was
inevitable. But it came two years later
than it should have, due to those two guys
alone. You'll have more luck striking oil
on campus than finding people who are
more respectful and encouraging. They
deserve this emerging age of glory.
This year's performance hints at a for
mula of dynastic consequence. It foretells
a future of financially independent colle
giate wrestling, and the possibility that
success and self-sufficiency need not be
mutually exclusive.
Perhaps this is all a blessing. When
they reap the rewards of big showings at
both the PAC-10 and NCAA champi
onships this year, they'll be free of the
burden of other people to thank. This
team has come a long way with a deficit of
positive publicity and hardly a tinge of
campus support.
Tonight the Stanford Wrestling team
faces off against Cal State Fullerton at 6
p.m. in the Ford Center. Go see what I'm
talking about. Watch Matt Gentry domi
nate his opponent with the fluidity of an
angry ocean. Witness Luis Vendrell's re
lentless opposition or Brad Metzler's
technical virtuosity. See Imad Kharbush's
skyworks as tosses his opponents like
around confetti at Mardi Gras. Steve, Jay,
Kevin and the entire roster deserve
packed gym tonight, so bring your Stan
ford body down.
And buy a T-shirt while you're at it.
The black ones are wicked cool.
