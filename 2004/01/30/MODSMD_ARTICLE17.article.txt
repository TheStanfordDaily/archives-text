## Julie ponders the existence of the cheerleader 
### 
In the world of professional sports,
there are athletes and there are
cheerleaders. Okay, to be more spe
cific, in the worlds of the NBA and
NFL, there are ridiculously high-paid
and sought-after athletes, and their
.cheerleaders. No, no, I'm not about to
argue that the two groups should be paid
equally, or even compared, and I could
care less about the whole salary cap issue.
Who are these girls and why are they
dancing around in pleather and fake eye
lashes? Contrary to conventional wis
, dom, they're not out there to raise team
spirits or fan enthusiasm.
Sure, they might tell you otherwise.
One of this year's Raiderettes, a.k.a.
Football's Fabulous Females, back on

the squad after an 18-
year hiatus, claims
she's "grown so pas
sionate about com
munity involvement."
Community in
volvement, my ass.
Check out the Dallas
Cowboy's Cheerlead
ers web site (the offi
cial one, not the porn
knockoff site that re-

lentlessly assaulted my screen). Cheer
leader after cheerleader, 80-something
percent of whom are single, by my count,
talks about her pet doggie and how she as
pires to be a respected actress in the fu
ture, or at least famous in general. Which
I guess is only slightly less interesting than
the information you get at the 49ers Gol
drush site: zodiac signs, favorite foods, fa
vorite charities. I feel transported back to
the days of 90210 fanbooks, and how
. Kelly enjoyed cooking for the cast, and
Brenda's favorite band was ÜB-40.
If Brenda wasn't your favorite, but
you don't exactly like her ex-boyfriend's
ex-amateur video partner Paris Hilton,
consider this: Paris is dating Nick Carter,
of the permanently defunct Backstreet
Boys. If we consider the possibility that
ihe video was a drastic but successful
publicity stunt, dating an ex-member of a
failed boy band is a way worse stunt.
They're both blond, that's kind of cute.
Ahh Paris, getting more meaningless
publicity, and here in my column!
- Cheerleading is no joke. I met a 49ers
girl who just got her boobs done because
she thought it would help her out in this
year's auditions. And I mean, they look
great. See, they re-audition each year and it
js highly competitive. Laker Girls won't
even post audition information on-line
they only take one-third of a percent of the
girls who make it to auditions anyways, and
you thought Stanford was competitive?
By the way, professional cheerleaders
don't actually cheer, so don't ask them to if
you ever meet one. They dance at games,
sign lots of autographs and take pictures
with fans, show up and look nice at count-
Jess publicity venues, and pump out pretty
Lot calendars. The Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders even have a show group that
ban be hired out to perform their enter
tainment extravaganza, "America and
Her Music." Can you get any more middle
America? I never want to see this show.
I kind of want to see this show. It's the
whole morbid fascination thing, like that
channel that shows surgeries, or the en
tirety of MTV programming.
Cheerleaders have their place in na
tionally broadcast games and official
NFL/NBA web sites because people
like looking at them. It's not like your av
erage fan knows a double pirouette from
a side battement anyway, although he
probably knows what the splits are, be
cause all good beer-drinking straight
American men like the splits. That's why
strippers do the splits too.
Now this is really a fine point. Just be
cause no one cares if the girls actually
dance well does not mean that they are
not good dancers. In fact, they're excel
lent technical dancers, even if you think
the choreography is a little deficient on
the creative side, which it definitely is.
I tried out for the San Jose Saber Ki
ttens freshman year after the Dollies reject
ed me, and before I knew that the Saber-
Cats play arena football. Embarrassing, I
know. They rejected me too, so even the
Saber Kittens must be somewhat selective.
So do cheerleaders hook up with the
players? I have no idea.
But what began as a subservient "girls
cheer passively on the side lines for the
able-bodied males" has warped into "tal
ented dancers cheer on the side lines to ad
vance their own careers and pull in internet
viewers and big bucks for the corporate
giant." That's kind of progressive, right?
Never a cheerleader: Julie.
Good cheerleader: Paula Abdul.
Bad cheerleader: George W.

talking to her tabby cat long distance on
the phone, and one day would like to be
famous in general.

ihe video was a drastic but successful
publicity stunt, dating an ex-member of a
failed boy band is a way worse stunt.
They're both blond, that's kind of cute.
Ahh Paris, getting more meaningless
publicity, and here in my column!
- Cheerleading is no joke. I met a 49ers
girl who just got her boobs done because
she thought it would help her out in this
year's auditions. And I mean, they look
great. See, they re-audition each year and it
js highly competitive. Laker Girls won't
even post audition information on-line
they only take one-third of a percent of the
girls who make it to auditions anyways, and
you thought Stanford was competitive?
By the way, professional cheerleaders
don't actually cheer, so don't ask them to if
you ever meet one. They dance at games,
sign lots of autographs and take pictures
with fans, show up and look nice at count-
Jess publicity venues, and pump out pretty
Lot calendars. The Dallas Cowboys
Cheerleaders even have a show group that
ban be hired out to perform their enter
tainment extravaganza, "America and
Her Music." Can you get any more middle
America? I never want to see this show.
I kind of want to see this show. It's the
whole morbid fascination thing, like that
channel that shows surgeries, or the en
tirety of MTV programming.
Cheerleaders have their place in na
tionally broadcast games and official
NFL/NBA web sites because people
like looking at them. It's not like your av
erage fan knows a double pirouette from
a side battement anyway, although he
probably knows what the splits are, be
cause all good beer-drinking straight
American men like the splits. That's why
strippers do the splits too.
Now this is really a fine point. Just be
cause no one cares if the girls actually
dance well does not mean that they are
not good dancers. In fact, they're excel
lent technical dancers, even if you think
the choreography is a little deficient on
the creative side, which it definitely is.
I tried out for the San Jose Saber Ki
ttens freshman year after the Dollies reject
ed me, and before I knew that the Saber-
Cats play arena football. Embarrassing, I
know. They rejected me too, so even the
Saber Kittens must be somewhat selective.
So do cheerleaders hook up with the
players? I have no idea.
But what began as a subservient "girls
cheer passively on the side lines for the
able-bodied males" has warped into "tal
ented dancers cheer on the side lines to ad
vance their own careers and pull in internet
viewers and big bucks for the corporate
giant." That's kind of progressive, right?
Never a cheerleader: Julie.
Good cheerleader: Paula Abdul.
Bad cheerleader: George W.

In the world of professional sports,
there are athletes and there are
cheerleaders. Okay, to be more spe
cific, in the worlds of the NBA and
NFL, there are ridiculously high-paid
and sought-after athletes, and their
.cheerleaders. No, no, I'm not about to
argue that the two groups should be paid
equally, or even compared, and I could
care less about the whole salary cap issue.
Who are these girls and why are they
dancing around in pleather and fake eye
lashes? Contrary to conventional wis
, dom, they're not out there to raise team
spirits or fan enthusiasm.
Sure, they might tell you otherwise.
One of this year's Raiderettes, a.k.a.
Football's Fabulous Females, back on

the squad after an 18-
year hiatus, claims
she's "grown so pas
sionate about com
munity involvement."
Community in
volvement, my ass.
Check out the Dallas
Cowboy's Cheerlead
ers web site (the offi
cial one, not the porn
knockoff site that re-

lentlessly assaulted my screen). Cheer
leader after cheerleader, 80-something
percent of whom are single, by my count,
talks about her pet doggie and how she as
pires to be a respected actress in the fu
ture, or at least famous in general. Which
I guess is only slightly less interesting than
the information you get at the 49ers Gol
drush site: zodiac signs, favorite foods, fa
vorite charities. I feel transported back to
the days of 90210 fanbooks, and how
. Kelly enjoyed cooking for the cast, and
Brenda's favorite band was ÜB-40.
If Brenda wasn't your favorite, but
you don't exactly like her ex-boyfriend's
ex-amateur video partner Paris Hilton,
consider this: Paris is dating Nick Carter,
of the permanently defunct Backstreet
Boys. If we consider the possibility that
ihe video was a drastic but successful
publicity stunt, dating an ex-member of a
failed boy band is a way worse stunt.
