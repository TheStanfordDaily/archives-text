# Card extends streak
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Corvallis, Ore. For 25 min
utes Oregon State looked like
the No. 2 basketball team in the
country. Or, more accurately,
No. 2 Stanford looked like the
lowly Beavers (8-10, 2-6 Pacific
10 Conference), unable to gener
ate any offensive rhythm against
a team that is ranked near the
bottom of the conference in
points allowed.
But the Cardinal (17-0, 8-0)
used superior defense to survive
a dreadful shooting night (39 per
cent) and pull out a 62-48 victory
at the Gill Coliseum in Corvallis.
Stanford open the game by
missing 14 of its first 19 shots and
had just 10 points by the seven
minute mark of the first half. The
Beavers opened up a seven-point
lead behind shooting guard Chris
Stephens' perfect marksman
ship. Stephens, finished with a
game-high 24 points, made all
three of his first half 3-point at
tempts.
As the first half wound down,
Justin Davis almost single-handi
ly brought the Cardinal back. On
consecutive possessions, he
blocked a shot, threw down a
thunderous rebound dunk,
forced his man into a traveling vi
olation on defense and scored on
a put-back after an offensive re
bound. Stanford ended the half
with a 29-23 lead and looked to

expand from there.
But Oregon State started the
second half much the same way it
began the first, with two more 3-
pointers from Stephens and a
pretty mid-range jumper from
forward David Lucas. To make
matters worse for the Cardinal,
Davis went down with a quadri
cep injury and did not return,
though he said after the game
that the injury wasn't serious.
With Stanford down 31-29,
Josh Childress sparked a 12-0 run
with two 3-pointers propelling
the Cardinal to a lead it would
safeguard the rest of the night
with steals and blocked shots on
defense. Childress led the team
with 17 points, along with four re
bounds and five blocks.
On a night when starting
guards Matt Lottich and Chris
Hernandez hit just l-of-16 shots,
reserve forward Matt Haryasz
provided an important lift off the
bench. During the decisive sec
ond half run, Haryasz hit three
baskets, pulled down three re
bounds and blocked a shot. He
finished with 10 points, seven re
bounds and six blocks in 18 min
utes of play.
Unable to hit from the outside
for most of the night, Stanford
tried to use its size and athleti
cism to work over the smaller
Beavers in the paint. Instead, the
Cardinal was outrebounded for
the first time this season, by a
team that had yet to outrebound

a single conference opponent.
"That's something we pride
ourselves on, and for us to lose
the war on the boards tells the
tale of why we struggled,"
Haryasz said after the game.
"They fought hard, give them
credit for going to the boards on
us. That's kind of an effort thing."
It wasn't the lack of effort that
led to l-of-12 and 0-of-4 shooting
nights for Lottich and Hernan
dez, respectively they were
just plain cold.
"We struggled offensively,"
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We didn't
shoot the ball very well and
didn't execute."
Victories away from home are
rarely easy to come by, but few
would have expected Stanford to
have so much trouble against the
Beavers, who earlier in the sea
son lost to the likes of Portland,
Boise State and even the EA
Sports Southwest All-Stars.
"Winning on the road is still a
big deal," Montgomery said. "It's
really hard to do, but for us we're
trying to improve."
The Cardinal may have to
play better to defeat Oregon on
Saturday at Mac Arthur Court,
where the Ducks beat Stanford
last year. The game is at 3 p.m.,
and will be televised on Fox
Sports Net.
The Ducks ran their record to
10-5 (5-3) after a 68-56 win over
Berkeley last night in Eugene.

the No. 2 basketball team in the
country. Or, more accurately,
No. 2 Stanford looked like the
lowly Beavers (8-10, 2-6 Pacific
10 Conference), unable to gener
ate any offensive rhythm against
a team that is ranked near the
bottom of the conference in
points allowed.
But the Cardinal (17-0, 8-0)
used superior defense to survive
a dreadful shooting night (39 per
cent) and pull out a 62-48 victory
at the Gill Coliseum in Corvallis.
Stanford open the game by
missing 14 of its first 19 shots and
had just 10 points by the seven
minute mark of the first half. The
Beavers opened up a seven-point
lead behind shooting guard Chris
Stephens' perfect marksman
ship. Stephens, finished with a
game-high 24 points, made all
three of his first half 3-point at
tempts.
As the first half wound down,
Justin Davis almost single-handi
ly brought the Cardinal back. On
consecutive possessions, he
blocked a shot, threw down a
thunderous rebound dunk,
forced his man into a traveling vi
olation on defense and scored on
a put-back after an offensive re
bound. Stanford ended the half
with a 29-23 lead and looked to

expand from there.
But Oregon State started the
second half much the same way it
began the first, with two more 3-
pointers from Stephens and a
pretty mid-range jumper from
forward David Lucas. To make
matters worse for the Cardinal,
Davis went down with a quadri
cep injury and did not return,
though he said after the game
that the injury wasn't serious.
With Stanford down 31-29,
Josh Childress sparked a 12-0 run
with two 3-pointers propelling
the Cardinal to a lead it would
safeguard the rest of the night
with steals and blocked shots on
defense. Childress led the team
with 17 points, along with four re
bounds and five blocks.
On a night when starting
guards Matt Lottich and Chris
Hernandez hit just l-of-16 shots,
reserve forward Matt Haryasz
provided an important lift off the
bench. During the decisive sec
ond half run, Haryasz hit three
baskets, pulled down three re
bounds and blocked a shot. He
finished with 10 points, seven re
bounds and six blocks in 18 min
utes of play.
Unable to hit from the outside
for most of the night, Stanford
tried to use its size and athleti
cism to work over the smaller
Beavers in the paint. Instead, the
Cardinal was outrebounded for
the first time this season, by a
team that had yet to outrebound

a single conference opponent.
"That's something we pride
ourselves on, and for us to lose
the war on the boards tells the
tale of why we struggled,"
Haryasz said after the game.
"They fought hard, give them
credit for going to the boards on
us. That's kind of an effort thing."
It wasn't the lack of effort that
led to l-of-12 and 0-of-4 shooting
nights for Lottich and Hernan
dez, respectively they were
just plain cold.
"We struggled offensively,"
Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "We didn't
shoot the ball very well and
didn't execute."
Victories away from home are
rarely easy to come by, but few
would have expected Stanford to
have so much trouble against the
Beavers, who earlier in the sea
son lost to the likes of Portland,
Boise State and even the EA
Sports Southwest All-Stars.
"Winning on the road is still a
big deal," Montgomery said. "It's
really hard to do, but for us we're
trying to improve."
The Cardinal may have to
play better to defeat Oregon on
Saturday at Mac Arthur Court,
where the Ducks beat Stanford
last year. The game is at 3 p.m.,
and will be televised on Fox
Sports Net.
The Ducks ran their record to
10-5 (5-3) after a 68-56 win over
Berkeley last night in Eugene.
