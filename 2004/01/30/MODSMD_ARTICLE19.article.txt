# Baseball opens season against Cal Fullerton
## 
### SEAN HOWELL CONTRIB UTING WRITER 
As the Stanford baseball team ran into the locker
room after yesterday's practice while darkness en
veloped Sunken Diamond, Cal State Fullerton took
the field to get in some extra batting practice under
the stadium lights. It is unconventional for the visit
ing team to practice on the home team's field, but
then again, this isn't your conventional series.
No. 4 Fullerton rolls into town this weekend for a
three-game set to kick off the 2004 season, and you
can bet they'll be looking for a little revenge. The Ti
tans beat the Cardinal four times last year, including
once in the College World Series, but Stanford had
the last laugh, twice avoiding elimination by defeat
ing their old rival on consecutive days to advance to
the finals.
No. 6 Stanford's players will tell you that every
game is important, but this is not just another series.
"This series is huge," senior center fielder Sam
Fuld said. "These three games would be important
no matter what, but the rivalry we have with them
adds to it."
"It ups the ante," sophomore pitcher Mark Ro
manczuk, tonight's starter, added.
Head coach Mark Marquess praised Fullerton's
team and said that this will be a good test for his ball
club, as it was last season, when the Titans swept the
Cardinal in the opening series.
"We're anxious to play someone else," Marquess
said. "They have a great program ... This game will
show us where we need to improve and where we
don't."
The series will be an opportunity for the Cardinal
to see how its starting rotation measures up to one of
the country's best. The Titans return all three of the
starting pitchers that drove them to the semifinal
round of the CWS last season. That stands in stark
contrast to Stanford's rotation, which will be one of
the team's biggest question marks.
"They have solid pitching, which separates them
from the rest of the teams out West," Marquess said.
"We have good pitching, but our staffs not as proven
as theirs is."
Indeed, Romanczuk is the only proven pitcher in

the rotation, having won 12 games last season.
Sophomore Matt Manship, who closed last year, will
start on Saturday, and Marquess said that the Sunday
starter will be selected from the pitchers who don't
throw in relief in the first two games of the series.
Though the team lost John Hudgins and Ryan
McCally, who combined to win nearly half of its
games last year, Romanczuk thinks the staff has a
chance to be better as a whole this year.
"We're 10 or 11 pitchers deep, so we can do some
damage this year," he said.
Marquess also talked about the depth of the staff,
saying that he has been impressed by the team's five
freshmen pitchers. He said that he will have the lux
ury of using at least three pitchers in each game, lim
iting the starters to four or five innings.
Stanford's offense, despite having lost two of the
most prolific offensive players in team history in
Ryan Garko and Carlos Quentin, seems to be on
more solid ground. Junior Donny Lucy will take
over for Garko at catcher, and utility player Brian
Hall will replace Quentin in right field. In addition,
middle infielder Tobin Swope, who graduated last
year, will probably be replaced by sophomore Chris
Lewis tonight, though freshman Adam Sorgi might
also get some playing time at second base during the
series.
"We're fine," said Fuld of the offense. "We still
have a lot of guys coming back, and guys will have
breakout seasons. It happens every year."
Fuld, a First Team preseason All-American, pro
vided the biggest boost to the offense by simply de
ciding to return for his senior season after being
drafted by the Cubs in the 24th round last summer.
He is especially valuable in the clutch, holding the all
time College World Series record with 24 hits.
"He's one of the best center fielders and leadoff
hitters in college baseball, and just his return im
proves our offense and defense by at least 30 per
cent," Marquess said.
Stanford looks good on paper, but the true test
will come this weekend, a fact that Fuld can attest to.
"I'm confident, but it's always a mystery of how
it's going to go," he said. "Last year we felt pretty
good and we went down to Fullerton and got swept,
so you never know what's going to happen."
