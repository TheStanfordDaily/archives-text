# Campaign donations high

### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford employees and students
contributed more to President
George W. Bush and former Ver
mont Gov. Howard Dean than all
but four college and universities na
tionwide in 2003, according to a re
port from the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics. A search by The
Stanford Daily of contributions to
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry
could find only one college, Harvard,
that donated more than Stanford.

Donations of more than $2OO to
presidential campaigns by Stanford
employees and students totaled
third highest among U.S. colleges
and universities.
Most Stanford donations came
from faculty and non-teaching staff;
only a few students donated in excess
of $2OO. In comparison, three times
as many Harvard students donated
to political campaigns.
"The problem with apathy is that

the average interest [among Stan
ford students] is low, while there's
only a core group of students on our
campus who take an active interest
in politics and always will they're
more in tune and interested," said
senior Nina Bilimoria, chair of the

nonpartisan Stanford in Govern
ment. "At all our events, we get this
similar group of people who circu
late among the same circles."
