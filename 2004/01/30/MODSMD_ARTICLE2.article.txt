# Campaign donations high
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford employees and students
contributed more to President
George W. Bush and former Ver
mont Gov. Howard Dean than all
but four college and universities na
tionwide in 2003, according to a re
port from the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics. A search by The
Stanford Daily of contributions to
Massachusetts Senator John Kerry
could find only one college, Harvard,
that donated more than Stanford.

Donations of more than $2OO to
presidential campaigns by Stanford
employees and students totaled
third highest among U.S. colleges
and universities.
Most Stanford donations came
from faculty and non-teaching staff;
only a few students donated in excess
of $2OO. In comparison, three times
as many Harvard students donated
to political campaigns.
"The problem with apathy is that

the average interest [among Stan
ford students] is low, while there's
only a core group of students on our
campus who take an active interest
in politics and always will they're
more in tune and interested," said
senior Nina Bilimoria, chair of the

nonpartisan Stanford in Govern
ment. "At all our events, we get this
similar group of people who circu
late among the same circles."

According to Federal Election
Commission records, Dean, Kerry
and Bush collectively received 81
percent of total donations from
Stanford employees and students
$17,700, $13,150 and $11,500, re
spectively. Connecticut Senator Joe
Lieberman, North Carolina Senator
John Edwards and Missouri Con
gressman Dick Gephardt each gar
nered between $2,000 and $4,250.
Ohio Congressman Dennis
Kucinich received $750 while retired
General Wesley Clark of Arkansas
and the Reverend A 1 Sharpton of
New York received no Stanford
contributions in excess of $2OO.

"The Democratic nominee will
always have a great deal of support
on a liberal college campus that's
given," said junior Joe Fairbanks,
president of the Stanford College
Republicans, in response to the fact
that the democratic presidential can
didates received 88 percent of dona
tions from Stanford.
"The fact that Bush has been able
to raise nearly two-thirds of what a
liberal democrat [Dean] has raised
on a college campus, without even
campaigning, is an extremely posi
tive sign," he said. "Just imagine

what Bush will be able to raise once
he's in full campaign mode."
Gephardt dropped out of the
race after coming in fourth in the
lowa Democratic caucus.

Federal law requires presidential
candidates to report the employ
ment data for only those contribu
tors who donate more than $2OO, so
the data does not reflect small
donors, who were responsible for a
majority of the contributions to the
Dean and Kucinich campaigns.
These small contributors constituted
a third of Clark's donations and a
quarter of Carol Moseley Braun's,
compared with 12 percent for Bush,
Kerry and Gephardt, and less than
10 percent for Edwards, Lieberman
and Sharpton.
Among Stanford's political sci
ence professors, there was only one
donation to a presidential campaign
$5OO to Edwards from a courtesy
professor. One professor emeritus
and two current professors donated a
total of $1,050 to two liberal political
action committees that do not involve
themselves in presidential campaigns.
From the Department of Eco
nomics, one professor donated
$2,000 to Bush while another donat
ed $250 to Lieberman.
Bilimoria said it was possible that
most professors from those depart
ments had been reluctant to donate
to political campaigns to try to main

tain their neutrality to minimize per
ceptions of bias.
Most of Stanford's political con
tributions came from employees of
Stanford Hospital and the Stanford
Medical School.

During the first nine months of
2003, democratic presidential candi
dates collectively raised $9B million
nationwide while $B3 million was
donated to Bush, who is running un
opposed for the republican presi
dential nomination.
"The democrats have raised as
much money as they have only be
cause they are in full campaign mode
and in a hotly contested primary,"
Fairbanks said. "The fact that Bush
hasn't even officially started cam
paigning and has been able to raise
as much as he has is a sign of his great
support both on college campuses
and nationwide."
In the final three months of 2003,
the Bush campaign stated that it had
raised an additional s47'million, for
a total of $l3O million in 2003. The
Kerry campaign claimed to have
raised over $1 million in the week
after the senator won the lowa de
mocratic caucus and another
$630,000 in the 48 hours following
his victory on Tuesday in the New
Hampshire democratic primary.
Stanford Democrats and Gener
ation Dean did not respond to re
quests for an interview.
