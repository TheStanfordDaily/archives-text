# Card women dominate
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The Washington women's basketball team (11-8, 4-6 Pacific 10 Conference) came to
Maples Pavilion looking for a knock-down, drag-out battle to the finish a chance to re
deem themselves after a heart-breaking early-season loss at home to No. 8 Stanford (16-3,
9-1). And while it may not have been a drag-out battle to the finish the Cardinal domi
nated, 85-59 it certainly was knock-down.
The Huskies showed just how physical they wanted to be from the moment the clock
started, getting called for two personal fouls in just the first nine seconds of the contest.
Stanford was far from intimidated, exerting a dominant inside game that had been ab
sent from the Cardinal's repertoire in recent Pac-10 play. Posts T'Nae Thiel, Chelsea Trot
ter, Kristen Newlin and Azella Perryman combined for 31 points on 12-for-21 shooting. Per
ryman led the way with 15 points and added four rebounds and one steal.
"Azella had a great game," said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "For me, this
was her best game of the season."
The Cardinal never allowed Washington to get into a rhythm the Huskies were forc
ing shots, turning the ball over and relying too much on last season's Pac-10 Player of the
Year, Giuliana Mendiola, on whom Stanford played particularly good defense. Mendiola
finished with just 15 points, well below her season average.
Additionally, the Cardinal turned up the heat on center Andrea Lalum, who lit up Stan
ford's defense for 20 points the last time the two teams faced off. Lalum was held to five
points on l-of-7 shooting.
Led by its staunch defense, Stanford pulled away with 11:27 to go in the opening period,
going on a 20-5 over the next 8:02 to stretch its lead to 21 points and the Cardinal would
never look back.
