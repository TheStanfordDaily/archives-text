# Card women dominate
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The Washington women's basketball team (11-8, 4-6 Pacific 10 Conference) came to
Maples Pavilion looking for a knock-down, drag-out battle to the finish a chance to re
deem themselves after a heart-breaking early-season loss at home to No. 8 Stanford (16-3,
9-1). And while it may not have been a drag-out battle to the finish the Cardinal domi
nated, 85-59 it certainly was knock-down.
The Huskies showed just how physical they wanted to be from the moment the clock
started, getting called for two personal fouls in just the first nine seconds of the contest.
Stanford was far from intimidated, exerting a dominant inside game that had been ab
sent from the Cardinal's repertoire in recent Pac-10 play. Posts T'Nae Thiel, Chelsea Trot
ter, Kristen Newlin and Azella Perryman combined for 31 points on 12-for-21 shooting. Per
ryman led the way with 15 points and added four rebounds and one steal.
"Azella had a great game," said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "For me, this
was her best game of the season."
The Cardinal never allowed Washington to get into a rhythm the Huskies were forc
ing shots, turning the ball over and relying too much on last season's Pac-10 Player of the
Year, Giuliana Mendiola, on whom Stanford played particularly good defense. Mendiola
finished with just 15 points, well below her season average.
Additionally, the Cardinal turned up the heat on center Andrea Lalum, who lit up Stan
ford's defense for 20 points the last time the two teams faced off. Lalum was held to five
points on l-of-7 shooting.
Led by its staunch defense, Stanford pulled away with 11:27 to go in the opening period,
going on a 20-5 over the next 8:02 to stretch its lead to 21 points and the Cardinal would
never look back.
Stanford sent yet another message in the
second half, starting the period with a 7-0
run that increased the lead to 27.
And after two straight baskets by
Chelsea Trotter put the Cardinal up by 35,
VanDerveer put in the end of the bench to
finish off the night.
"If anyone thought Stanford was in a
mini-slump, I think [this game] answers
that," Washington head coach June Daugh
erty said. "We did not bring it."
The 85-point explosion and even distri
bution of scoring was extremely encourag
ing for the Cardinal offense. Senior All-

American Nicole Powell averaged 27.3
points in Stanford's last three matchups, but
needed only 16 to lead the Cardinal to last
night's blowout victory. Additionally she
kept her six-game streak of double-doubles
alive, pulling down 10 rebounds.
The balanced scoring may have been the
key to Stanford's over-powering win. Four
players reached double figures Powell,
Perryman, Sebnem Kimyacioglu (11) and
Susan Borchardt (12).
The Cardinal's ball movement was also
clearly improved from its previous three
games. Kimyacioglu, Thiel and Kelley
Suminski each had four assists, while Bor
chardt chipped in three.
And limiting Pac-10's scoring leader to
just 59 points speaks volumes about Stan
ford's defense. The .Cardinal recorded a
season-high nine steals and forced 19
Husky turnovers.

However, despite the dominating win,
things weren't all sunshine and roses for
Stanford. With 12:06 to go in the second
half, freshman phenom Kristen Newlin
landed awkwardly and had to be taken out
of the game with what appeared to be a
right knee injury.
At press time VanDerveer had no in
formation regarding Newlin's injury, but
the Cardinal can only hope that she
avoided the dreaded anterior cruciate lig
ament tear which claims far too many sea
sons in women's basketball. Newlin suf
fered an ACL tear between her junior
and senior seasons of high school, but was
able to walk off the court on her own.
Newlin will undergo an MRI today to de
termine the severity of the injury.
She contributed seven points, four re
bounds and a blocked shot before leaving
the game.

The Washington women's basketball team (11-8, 4-6 Pacific 10 Conference) came to
Maples Pavilion looking for a knock-down, drag-out battle to the finish a chance to re
deem themselves after a heart-breaking early-season loss at home to No. 8 Stanford (16-3,
9-1). And while it may not have been a drag-out battle to the finish the Cardinal domi
nated, 85-59 it certainly was knock-down.
The Huskies showed just how physical they wanted to be from the moment the clock
started, getting called for two personal fouls in just the first nine seconds of the contest.
Stanford was far from intimidated, exerting a dominant inside game that had been ab
sent from the Cardinal's repertoire in recent Pac-10 play. Posts T'Nae Thiel, Chelsea Trot
ter, Kristen Newlin and Azella Perryman combined for 31 points on 12-for-21 shooting. Per
ryman led the way with 15 points and added four rebounds and one steal.
"Azella had a great game," said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "For me, this
was her best game of the season."
The Cardinal never allowed Washington to get into a rhythm the Huskies were forc
ing shots, turning the ball over and relying too much on last season's Pac-10 Player of the
Year, Giuliana Mendiola, on whom Stanford played particularly good defense. Mendiola
finished with just 15 points, well below her season average.
Additionally, the Cardinal turned up the heat on center Andrea Lalum, who lit up Stan
ford's defense for 20 points the last time the two teams faced off. Lalum was held to five
points on l-of-7 shooting.
Led by its staunch defense, Stanford pulled away with 11:27 to go in the opening period,
going on a 20-5 over the next 8:02 to stretch its lead to 21 points and the Cardinal would
never look back.
Stanford sent yet another message in the
second half, starting the period with a 7-0
run that increased the lead to 27.
And after two straight baskets by
Chelsea Trotter put the Cardinal up by 35,
VanDerveer put in the end of the bench to
finish off the night.
"If anyone thought Stanford was in a
mini-slump, I think [this game] answers
that," Washington head coach June Daugh
erty said. "We did not bring it."
The 85-point explosion and even distri
bution of scoring was extremely encourag
ing for the Cardinal offense. Senior All-

American Nicole Powell averaged 27.3
points in Stanford's last three matchups, but
needed only 16 to lead the Cardinal to last
night's blowout victory. Additionally she
kept her six-game streak of double-doubles
alive, pulling down 10 rebounds.
The balanced scoring may have been the
key to Stanford's over-powering win. Four
players reached double figures Powell,
Perryman, Sebnem Kimyacioglu (11) and
Susan Borchardt (12).
The Cardinal's ball movement was also
clearly improved from its previous three
games. Kimyacioglu, Thiel and Kelley
Suminski each had four assists, while Bor
chardt chipped in three.
And limiting Pac-10's scoring leader to
just 59 points speaks volumes about Stan
ford's defense. The .Cardinal recorded a
season-high nine steals and forced 19
Husky turnovers.

However, despite the dominating win,
things weren't all sunshine and roses for
Stanford. With 12:06 to go in the second
half, freshman phenom Kristen Newlin
landed awkwardly and had to be taken out
of the game with what appeared to be a
right knee injury.
At press time VanDerveer had no in
formation regarding Newlin's injury, but
the Cardinal can only hope that she
avoided the dreaded anterior cruciate lig
ament tear which claims far too many sea
sons in women's basketball. Newlin suf
fered an ACL tear between her junior
and senior seasons of high school, but was
able to walk off the court on her own.
Newlin will undergo an MRI today to de
termine the severity of the injury.
She contributed seven points, four re
bounds and a blocked shot before leaving
the game.
