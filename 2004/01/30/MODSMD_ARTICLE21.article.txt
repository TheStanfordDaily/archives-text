# Tennis heads to Hawaii

### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After a stunning 7-0 shutout of Texas Christian on Monday, No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
(2-0) is set for success today against Hawaii.
Otherwise put, the forecast is bleak for the unranked Rainbow Wahine.
In 2001, Stanford blanked Hawaii. Twice.
In 2002, Stanford blanked Hawaii. Twice.
In fact, records as far back as 1995 show Hawaii facing swift defeat at the hands of the Car
dinal each and every year.
Today's event at Taube Family Tennis Stadium marks the second season showdown of the
two teams. In their first meeting in November, the Wahine eked out a lone match victory on its
home turf.
Playing in the No. 6 position, Stanford sophomore Jessica Leek fell to Kana Aikawa, 4-6,4-
6. Aikawa, a freshman who stands just 5-foot-l, has yet to complete more than three matches
in her collegiate career.
Meanwhile, Leek, who is 1-6 this season in individual and dual match competition, is look
ing to boost her match play success. Her last victory came in October over Leigh Orne of Gon
zaga, 6-4, 6-3, during the Round of 64 at the St. Mary's College Invitational.
"Everybody will pretty much play [only] singles or doubles," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "We're trying to play a lot of players to get ready for [Team Indoors competition] next
week."
In an ever-changing lineup, the doubles tandem of senior Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin
Burdette remains steadily top-ranked. On Monday, the pair downed Paty Aburto and Karla
Mancinas of Texas Christian, 8-3.
Burdette appears to be in fine form after
undergoing wrist surgery earlier in the sea
son. Despite her recent absence, No. 7 Bur
dette upped her ranking from No. 11 in the
preseason, after reaching the finals at the
Riviera /ITA All-American Women's Ten
nis Championships in October.
"Mentally and physically I think we're
well rested and primed to go," said No. 20
Barnikow.
For some players, rest periods have
been few and far between. Freshman
Theresa Logar (11-2) is still going strong
after clinching her first collegiate title two
weeks ago at the Freeman Memorial Ten
nis Championships in Las Vegas. Playing
in the No. 3 position, Logar sailed over the
Florned Frog's Aburto, 6-3, 6-0.
Logar's efforts have earned her a spot in
the top-100 nationwide rankings. She cur
rently stands at No. 84.
Anne Yelsey, a freshman who reached
semifinals at the ITA Northwest Champi
onships in October, broke into the top-100
at No. 74. Playing in the No. 6 spot on Mon

day, Yelsey defeated Gloriann Lopez in
straight sets, 6-3,6-2.
Sophomore Alice Barnes made note of
her teammates' solid performances against
Texas Christian.
"I was particularly impressed with
how the freshmen handled [one of] their
first college dual matches," Barnes said.
"I remember it was a very nervy affair for
me last year, but Anne and Theresa
played really well and looked very much
at home."
The Cardinal displays unwavering confi
dence and unity going into its match today.
"Overall, our team has really improved
with regards to our competitive mindset
[and] our attitudes on the court," Logar
said.
Barnes added, "We will be very confi
dent going into the match with Hawaii. But
as always, we won't make the mistake of un
derestimating them. We know that a team
wouldn't come all this way just to make up
the numbers, so we will be taking
them very seriously."
Of course, every match counts on the
road to the NCAA Championships in May.
"We have a point to prove this season,
and a title to regain," Barnes said.
Watch as the Cardinal takes another step
in the right direction, today at 1:30 p.m. at
Taube.
