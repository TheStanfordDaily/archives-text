# Tennis heads to Hawaii

After a stunning 7-0 shutout of Texas Christian on Monday, No. 2 Stanford women's tennis
(2-0) is set for success today against Hawaii.
Otherwise put, the forecast is bleak for the unranked Rainbow Wahine.
In 2001, Stanford blanked Hawaii. Twice.
In 2002, Stanford blanked Hawaii. Twice.
In fact, records as far back as 1995 show Hawaii facing swift defeat at the hands of the Car
dinal each and every year.
Today's event at Taube Family Tennis Stadium marks the second season showdown of the
two teams. In their first meeting in November, the Wahine eked out a lone match victory on its
home turf.
Playing in the No. 6 position, Stanford sophomore Jessica Leek fell to Kana Aikawa, 4-6,4-
6. Aikawa, a freshman who stands just 5-foot-l, has yet to complete more than three matches
in her collegiate career.
Meanwhile, Leek, who is 1-6 this season in individual and dual match competition, is look
ing to boost her match play success. Her last victory came in October over Leigh Orne of Gon
zaga, 6-4, 6-3, during the Round of 64 at the St. Mary's College Invitational.
"Everybody will pretty much play [only] singles or doubles," said Stanford head coach Lele
Forood. "We're trying to play a lot of players to get ready for [Team Indoors competition] next
week."
In an ever-changing lineup, the doubles tandem of senior Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin
Burdette remains steadily top-ranked. On Monday, the pair downed Paty Aburto and Karla
Mancinas of Texas Christian, 8-3.
