# Post play key for women
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer came
into last night's game against Washington (11-8,4-6
Pacific-10 Conference) with one big objective to
improve the No. 8 Cardinal's (16-3, 9-1) inside
game. To do this, she had to find a way to get the ball
inside and to keep her best post players in the game
as much as possible. This is no easy feat considering
most of them have been plagued by chronic injuries
during the season.
With her bad knees, junior center Chelsea
Trotter will probably never see an entire half
this season. Junior forwards Azella Perryman
and T'Nae Thiel came into the rotation late.
Freshman center and rising-star Kristen Newlin
has played a variety of roles this season, some
times starting and sometimes supporting. And
with any luck, the knee injury that took her out
of the game last night won't keep her out for the
rest of the season.
Amazingly, in this game it didn't feel like there
were any supporting players. Solid performances
were turned in by many of the Cardinal women, and
for the first game in a long time it didn't look like
"The Nicole Powell Show."
"They're big kids and they get into passing
lanes," said Washington head coach June Daugh
tery. "They did that all night."
The perimeter shooting wasn't bad, 46.2 per
cent for the game, but the ball was brought to
the basket again and again. The Cardinal got
the job done in a big way, with an almost 20 per
cent improvement in shooting over last Sun
day's loss to USC.
Senior forward Nicole Powell turned in great
numbers of course, with 16 points and 10 re
bounds in 28 minutes of play. But four women
turned in double digits, Stanford's best team
performance to date. And the ensemble cast was
magnificent.
"We're more than great shooters," Van-
Derveer said. "We came off the game against
USC and we were able to focus on what we need
ed to do and we did it."
VanDerveer said this past week that she was
thinking of mixing up the line-up. It appeared that
she followed through against the Huskies, starting
the game with Powell, Kelley Suminski, Susan Bor
chardt, Sebnem Kimyacioglu and Thiel. Rapid sub
stitutions throughout the game kept the players
fresh and eager.
"I made the decision in my mind that if some
one was going to take time off out on the court,

they were going to come out," VanDerveer said.
"If the shot was going out there and I didn't see
people rebounding that needed to rebound or if
they were supposed to do something ... If we had
people who wanted to go in, then that's what we
needed to do."
VanDerveer has been trying to find a way to
get Powell in at the small-forward position all
season; maybe she's finally found a way to do it.
She certainly did something right with the drills
and the rotation for this game. The Cardinal
has never looked better than against the
Huskies.
It's interesting that in the past VanDerveer
has highlighted the importance of good
matchups with Trotter, but seemed to feel that
she wanted some combination of Trotter and
Thiel or Trotter and Newlin. Instead, she tried
putting Thiel and Newlin in together early in the
first half, but quickly pulled Newlin out and re
placed her with Thiel when Newlin missed a shot
from the line.
The Cardinal's game under the basket could
improve even more dramatically if Trotter could
play a whole game. Trotter's absence is probably
be one of the biggest "what if..." questions of the
season.
Trotter's abilities were nicely highlighted
last night by several shots under the basket,
particularly in the 12th minute where she
scored four points extremely quickly. She has
the presence to bring herself into position and
maintain her spot on the floor without drawing
the foul.
Still, the post player that shined was Perry
man. She scored 15 points, the second highest
for the night, and definitely showed off just how
good the Cardinal can be when it passes the ball
inside the key.
Quick, physical, determined ... Perryman plays
the whole court. Nice shots, tenacity and good
boards combine to make her one of the Card's best
weapons.
The combination of Thiel and Perryman in the
second half appeared to work especially well,
though a large part of that may have been due to
Perryman's excellent playing. Her skill and spirit
were most evident last night when she fought for a
rebound and missed from underneath, only to steal
the ball and drive in for layup with 4:28 left to play in
the second half.
If Stanford can keep up this level of team
work for the rest of the season, and the players
can stay off the injured list and on the court, then
the second half of the season looks bright.
