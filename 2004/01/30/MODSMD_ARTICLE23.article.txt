# No. 8 men set to face two top-10 teams
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Move over, basketball, the No. 8
Stanford men's volleyball team (4-4,
2-2 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) takes Maples Pavilion tonight.
The Cardinal will face off against
No. 5 UC-Santa Barbara in Stan
ford's biggest stadium at 7 p.m., be
fore relocating to their usual venue,
Burnham Pavilion, to take on No. 6
California State Northridge on Sat
urday at the same time. In the mean
time, though, they'll try to maintain
the steady win streak that the men's
basketball team has enjoyed on the
Maples court.
Stanford last faced Santa Bar
bara as the first match in a consola
tion round at the Gaucho's home
tournament on Jan. 10. Since the
Cardinal had dropped the first
match of the tournament to Long
Beach State the night before, win
ning was not emphasized, and Stan
ford lost in three games. During the
match, Coach Dawn Shaw opted to
try different lineups.
"[lt was] about getting guys expe
rience and resting the guys that we
had," Shaw said.
The younger Cardinal players re
sponded to the challenge, led by
sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy with 10 kills. But when Stan
ford meets Santa Barbara tonight,
points will matter.
Shaw explained that his team's
focus on improvement would not be
influenced by the opponent or previ
ous matches.
"We're just trying to get better
each weekend," he said. "Regard
less of who we're playing this week
end, we want to play better than we

did last weekend."
Much better.
Last weekend the Cardinal fell to
both Long Beach and UC-San
Diego, 3-1, an experience that junior
Kevin Hansen explained was in
structional for his team.
"We kind of are back to reality
after a honeymoon weekend [of]
very dramatic wins," he said, refer
ring to his team's defeat of then-No.
2 UCLA and then-No. 10 UC-Irvine
two weekends ago. "[Last weekend]
was a good wake up call so early in
the season."
And just in time for some impres
sive teams that might prove relative
ly similar challenges for the Cardi
nal. Not only are Santa Barbara and
Northridge neck and neck in the
rankings, but last Friday, the Gau
chos beat Northridge in a five-game
contest. Santa Barbara's Evan Patak
led his team in a 3-2 win with a ca
reer-high 32 kills.
While the Gauchos boast some
stellar hitters, Shaw explained that
his eye is on Matador setter Ty
Tramblie, who notched 71 assists in
the matchup against Santa Barbara.
The senior stands at a relatively
short six feet.
"He's a small guy but he plays
big," Shaw said. "He's outstanding.
What he does for that team is similar
to what Kevin [Hansen] does for
us."
Playing big may be a theme for
this weekend, as Stanford attempts
to pull out of its two game losing
slump. Shaw says he looks forward
to two matches on Stanford terf.
"Being at home will be good," he
said. "Hopefully we can get back
some of that fire we had that open
ing home weekend."
