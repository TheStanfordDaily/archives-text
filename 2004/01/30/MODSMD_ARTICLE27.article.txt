(U-WIRE) ARLINGTON, Texas Big Beautiful
College Women, the nation's first plus-sized college
organization, held its first event Wednesday night at
the University of Texas-Arlington.
The BBCW hosted a "Howdy Dance" where stu
dents could learn about the organization, which was
formed in October.
The idea for the club stemmed from a failed plus
sized pageant, which was planned to showcase a dif
ferent perspective on beauty, founder Gina Monday
said.
"There's never been anything for the plus-size
women to feel positive about," the communications
'senior said.
Soon, students who were interested in competing in
the pageant complained about the definition of a plus
'size woman, Monday said. Students asked why they
had to be over a size 20 to compete.
"I was going to go head on into this [pageant],"
Monday said. "We weren't allowing below size 20, be
cause we Wanted the participants to feel good about
themselves. If you put a size 14 next to a size 20, one of

those girls is going to be bigger, and that's not what we
were looking for." After realizing the problem, the
pageant was called off.
While she was calling all the pageant participants,
Monday said she thought, "We need to start a 'big girls
on campus.'"
Then, as soon as she told others her idea, all those
signed for the pageant were signed up to form what
would be the first "big girls club" in UTA and colle
giate history.
Now Monday's club is a national organization as
well and hopes to recruit members outside the univer
sity and start developing chapters.
Monday said she hopes to create a social communi
ty students can be comfortable in.
"When my daughter, who is now about a size 18,
goes to school, there will be an organization she can
feel comfortable in," Monday said.
"Our main goal is to get plus-size women to feel
like they have a place to go," co-founding charter
member Sharee Massey, a biology junior, said.
About 11 people showed for the dance, but that did
not sway members of the group.
"This is just something to get people out and have
fun," said biology sophomore Krystal Barrett.
