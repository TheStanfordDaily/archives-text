# Disability awareness group continues to act
## 
### LEILA SUMMERS DAILY EVERGREEN 
(U-WIRE) PULLMAN, Wash.
Ready to close operation just weeks
ago, the Disability Awareness Associ
ation at Washington State U. recruit
ed enough members to continue its
services and programs.
Renata Judd, president of DAA,
said she was the only remaining mem
ber of the organization this year and
could not continue to facilitate group
responsibilities alone. If more people
did not join the group, Judd said, the
organization would dissolve and van

services would be lost.
The wheelchair-accessible vans
mobilize disabled students around
campus even students with tempo
rary disabilities such as a broken
ankle.
Seventeen people attended a meet
ing Tuesday, the first meeting since
Judd appealed for support.
"The group talked about club is
sues, such as planning the upcoming
Disability Awareness Week, and per
sonal issues, such as other students' at
titudes toward disabled people,"
DAA adviser Marshall Mitchell said.
"The meeting was quite success

ful," Judd said.
Relocating the Disability Resource
Center also concerns DAA members,
Mitchell said. The DRC, located in
the Administration Annex, is set to
move to Pullman Memorial Hospital
when the new hospital is finished.
"We need a more central location
on campus," Judd said. "[Pullman
Memorial Hospital] is an out-of- the
way place." The DRC currently assists
the DAA in operating free van ser
vices, but Judd said that may change
next year. DAA is looking into hiring
a full-time coordinator for the van ser
vices, she said.

"This would more than double our
budget needs," Judd said.
She estimates this employee cost
ing the organization $30,000 a year, in
creasing DAA's annual budget needs
from $34,000 to about $64,000.
DAA funding serves to maintain
van operations, driver wages, gas, in
surance, maintenance and disabled
parking permits.
Remaining money promotes Dis
ability Awareness Week, usually tak
ing place in April. Often a banquet is
held during the week honoring a WSU
faculty member who is especially
helpful in assisting disabled students.
