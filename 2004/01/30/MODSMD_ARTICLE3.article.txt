# Students apathetic to sexual assault
## 
### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A national and campus-wide trend suggests a decline in interest among
students to address sexual assault and rape, despite statistics that say sexual
assault is as prevalent as ever.
On campus in recent months, there have been two high-profile sexual as
sault cases, one involving the infamous "serial groper" and the other involv
ing alleged sexual assault at a Delta Delta Delta sorority pledge event,
though charges were never filed in the latter case.
In fact, the total number of sexual assaults and rapes on campus has actu
ally held relatively steady since 2000. That year, four rapes and sexual as
saults were reported to the Stanford Police, and 17 sex offenses were report
ed to the University. In 2001, no rapes or sexual assaults were reported to the
police, and the University recorded 13 sex offenses. Last year, seven rapes
and sexual assaults were reported to the police, and the University received
reports of seven sex offenses.
In spite of the persistence of sex offenses on campus, some students are
too embarrassed to discuss the matter.
"Rape's loaded," said freshman John Collins. "I'm not saying anything
about that."
Others feel the issue has been blown out of proportion.
Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion Services on campus, ar
gued that most students are not desensitized to the sexual assault issue but
are uninformed, especially in the case involving the Tri Delt sorority.
"I honestly don't think Stanford students were complacent, but, rather,
very confused about the circumstances," she said.
It is the lack of information about rape and what constitutes it that caus
es many assaults to go unreported, she said.
"In my experience, the students who are well-informed are most likely to
come forward and seek help immediately," Pertofsky said.
Also contributing to victims' reluctance to report attacks is a perceived
social stigma, contended Laura Harrison, assistant dean of students and di
rector of the Women's Community Center.
"There is still much stigma associated with this issue as well as stereotypes that
the survivor may have 'asked for it' or in some way provoked the attack," she said.
Nationally, the number of rapes has not declined like other violent crimes
in recent years. According to the Bureau of Justice, rape and sexual assault
numbers nationally have held steady and even slightly increased since 2000.
On the national stage, there has been a declining level of interest and sym
pathy towards the less privileged, including sexual harassment victims, ar-
gued Pertofsky, most notably in the Kobe Bryant case.
"Nationwide, I think there is a backlash against those
who are less privileged, the poor, youth, children, less
privileged woman," she said. "Given current trends that
impact the national psyche, those who already have
