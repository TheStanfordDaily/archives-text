# Prank at gay co-op outrages LGBT community
## 
### MICHAEL CHANDLER DAILY CATIFORNTAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY Just a week before fi
nals, residents of the Oscar Wilde House, a gay-themed
University of California-Berkeley co-op, opened their
door to find a disturbing surprise: A young man
drenched in salad dressing, salsa and beer, tied to a
chair and stranded on the front porch.
He introduced himself as the newly elected presi
dent of Delta Upsilon, the fraternity across the street.
This was a fraternity initiation rite, he explained.
A petition circulated by co-op residents a week later
called the incident the latest "in a series of homophobic
acts," not a harmless prank. The petition traveled
through dozens of campus clubs and individuals, col
lecting more than 40 signatures and raising alarm
among many students and administrators.
"TTiere is no other conceivable reason to bring him
to an LGBT-themed house except t0... humiliate him,"
said Ronald Cruz, president of the Oscar Wilde House.
"The fact that this happened in front of our house, on
public display... we had to tell the public."
The new president, Marcio Von Muhlen, said the
reason he ended up at the Wilde House that night was
not because it was a gay-themed co-op, but because it
was the closest available front porch.
Once he sobered up and cleaned the slop out of his
hair, his first order of business was to manage a public
relations campaign to show that his members were "not
homophobes," and to act as a diplomat to bridge a
damaged relationship with his neighbors across the
street.
"Sometimes we do stupid things," Von Muhlen
said, "but it's not from malice." Von Muhlen said the
fraternity has pulled similar pranks at sorority houses in
the past.
fri the past seven weeks, the presidents of the two
houses have talked together several times to figure out
how to sort through what happened and prevent future
incidents.
Von Muhlen sent a letter apologizing for the Decem

ber event and has since invited residents of the Wilde
House over for dinner to meet the other members.
The two houses will have to cross more than the 30
feet of asphalt to come together, though. Members of
the more than century-old fraternity and the five
year-old co-op the first of its kind at a major uni
versity in the country have to branch two different
worlds.
In one world, there is a reputation that men accus
tomed to approval can act recklessly. In the other, peo
ple with a history of living in the closet are careful with
each move they make and how it might be perceived.
Other incidents on the petition have less of a "boys
will be boys" cast to them.
Last June, four drunk men walked, uninvited,
into the Oscar Wilde House at 3 a.m., according to
the petition. They harassed residents, saying, among
other things, "God hates faggots and we hate fag
gots." The intruders were identified as residents of
the DU house.
Less than a week later, a group of DU residents
saran-wrapped a man to a chair and delivered him to
the Wilde House front porch. From across the street,
the men yelled that Wilde residents should "f — him
up the a—" and other profanities.
Von Muhlen agrees that these were "mean-spirited
incidents of harassment," but he says DU members did
not commit them.
According to the petition, the men had Irish accents.
According to Von Muhlen, they were Irish boarders,
some of the 20 non-DU members who were staying at
the house last summer.
"How can we be blamed for something we didn't
do?" said JJ. Synold, a DU member, who called the al
legations "absurd."
House guests or not, Cruz said, the latest incident
combined with the already hostile environment creat
ed this summer, as well as previous incidents, show a
"pattern of discrimination" that starts as far back as
1999.
"If guests of our house were mistreating our neigh
bors," said Cruz, "we would take action."

Von Muhlen said they have since changed their
boarding policy. Starting this year, they will make sure
that a majority of summer residents are either DU
members or friends, not strangers.
"We all know we are a diverse, tolerant place," said
Von Muhlen. "They just don't see it this way."
While some fraternities cater to only Latinos or
Asians, Von Muhlen said DU has members from Ar
menia to India to Mexico. Although none of the cur
rent members are openly gay men, they have had
three in the past few years, including their vice presi
dent in 2001.
Eric Godoy, 24, said he came out while he was an ac
tive member of Delta Upsilon in 1999.
"Far and away," he said, "my greatest support were
my brothers." Godoy said his brothers were accepting
of him, even if they did not understand or have much
experience with other gay people.
Godoy described himself as a guy who likes sports
and drinking beer activities he had in common with
his frat brothers.
It wasn't always easy, he said, and being gay around
mostly straight people required a thick skin sometimes.
If his brothers said pejoratively, "Don't be so gay,"
Godoy would respond good-naturedly, "Don't be so
straight, you jackshit." During Rush, he said, he noticed
some rushees did not return after they found out about
his sexuality.
The climate for gay people at Berkeley, including in
the Greek system, "is better than most, the vast major
ity of places in the country," said Billy Curtis, the direc
tor of the Gender & Equity Resource Center. "That
does not mean we don't have a few bad apples... who
may be romanticizing the golden age of Greek, the an
imal house."
He said the administration is taking the current sit
uation between the Wilde House and Delta Upsilon
"very seriously."
"Clearly we have a safety issue. We have a hazing
issue," he said. "These things need to be addressed.
Whether it is homophobia or something underlying,
we don't know."

versity in the country have to branch two different
worlds.
In one world, there is a reputation that men accus
tomed to approval can act recklessly. In the other, peo
ple with a history of living in the closet are careful with
each move they make and how it might be perceived.
Other incidents on the petition have less of a "boys
will be boys" cast to them.
Last June, four drunk men walked, uninvited,
into the Oscar Wilde House at 3 a.m., according to
the petition. They harassed residents, saying, among
other things, "God hates faggots and we hate fag
gots." The intruders were identified as residents of
the DU house.
Less than a week later, a group of DU residents
saran-wrapped a man to a chair and delivered him to
the Wilde House front porch. From across the street,
the men yelled that Wilde residents should "f — him
up the a—" and other profanities.
Von Muhlen agrees that these were "mean-spirited
incidents of harassment," but he says DU members did
not commit them.
According to the petition, the men had Irish accents.
According to Von Muhlen, they were Irish boarders,
some of the 20 non-DU members who were staying at
the house last summer.
"How can we be blamed for something we didn't
do?" said JJ. Synold, a DU member, who called the al
legations "absurd."
House guests or not, Cruz said, the latest incident
combined with the already hostile environment creat
ed this summer, as well as previous incidents, show a
"pattern of discrimination" that starts as far back as
1999.
"If guests of our house were mistreating our neigh
bors," said Cruz, "we would take action."

Von Muhlen said they have since changed their
boarding policy. Starting this year, they will make sure
that a majority of summer residents are either DU
members or friends, not strangers.
"We all know we are a diverse, tolerant place," said
Von Muhlen. "They just don't see it this way."
While some fraternities cater to only Latinos or
Asians, Von Muhlen said DU has members from Ar
menia to India to Mexico. Although none of the cur
rent members are openly gay men, they have had
three in the past few years, including their vice presi
dent in 2001.
Eric Godoy, 24, said he came out while he was an ac
tive member of Delta Upsilon in 1999.
"Far and away," he said, "my greatest support were
my brothers." Godoy said his brothers were accepting
of him, even if they did not understand or have much
experience with other gay people.
Godoy described himself as a guy who likes sports
and drinking beer activities he had in common with
his frat brothers.
It wasn't always easy, he said, and being gay around
mostly straight people required a thick skin sometimes.
If his brothers said pejoratively, "Don't be so gay,"
Godoy would respond good-naturedly, "Don't be so
straight, you jackshit." During Rush, he said, he noticed
some rushees did not return after they found out about
his sexuality.
The climate for gay people at Berkeley, including in
the Greek system, "is better than most, the vast major
ity of places in the country," said Billy Curtis, the direc
tor of the Gender & Equity Resource Center. "That
does not mean we don't have a few bad apples... who
may be romanticizing the golden age of Greek, the an
imal house."
He said the administration is taking the current sit
uation between the Wilde House and Delta Upsilon
"very seriously."
"Clearly we have a safety issue. We have a hazing
issue," he said. "These things need to be addressed.
Whether it is homophobia or something underlying,
we don't know."
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY Just a week before fi
nals, residents of the Oscar Wilde House, a gay-themed
University of California-Berkeley co-op, opened their
door to find a disturbing surprise: A young man
drenched in salad dressing, salsa and beer, tied to a
chair and stranded on the front porch.
He introduced himself as the newly elected presi
dent of Delta Upsilon, the fraternity across the street.
This was a fraternity initiation rite, he explained.
A petition circulated by co-op residents a week later
called the incident the latest "in a series of homophobic
acts," not a harmless prank. The petition traveled
through dozens of campus clubs and individuals, col
lecting more than 40 signatures and raising alarm
among many students and administrators.
"TTiere is no other conceivable reason to bring him
to an LGBT-themed house except t0... humiliate him,"
said Ronald Cruz, president of the Oscar Wilde House.
"The fact that this happened in front of our house, on
public display... we had to tell the public."
The new president, Marcio Von Muhlen, said the
reason he ended up at the Wilde House that night was
not because it was a gay-themed co-op, but because it
was the closest available front porch.
Once he sobered up and cleaned the slop out of his
hair, his first order of business was to manage a public
relations campaign to show that his members were "not
homophobes," and to act as a diplomat to bridge a
damaged relationship with his neighbors across the
street.
"Sometimes we do stupid things," Von Muhlen
said, "but it's not from malice." Von Muhlen said the
fraternity has pulled similar pranks at sorority houses in
the past.
fri the past seven weeks, the presidents of the two
houses have talked together several times to figure out
how to sort through what happened and prevent future
incidents.
Von Muhlen sent a letter apologizing for the Decem

ber event and has since invited residents of the Wilde
House over for dinner to meet the other members.
The two houses will have to cross more than the 30
feet of asphalt to come together, though. Members of
the more than century-old fraternity and the five
year-old co-op the first of its kind at a major uni
versity in the country have to branch two different
