# Islamic awareness video controversial

A small television screen on
the University of California-Los
Angeles campus showing clips of
media programs featuring Pales
tinian children being trained for
warfare has faced opposition
from several students. The pre
sentation occurred during Islamic
Awareness Week.
The student group, Bruins For
Israel, organized the presentation
promoting a screening of a similar
documentary slated to be shown
Monday. Their method of pre
sentation and the timing of it
prompted opposition from stu
dents from different communi
ties.
Ross Neihaus, president of
BFI, said the group has been
planning this event for a long time
and the fact that it occurred on Is
lamic Awareness Week is purely
coincidental.
Neihaus, who is also a member
of the United Arab Society, said
it is important to understand that
his group is not speaking about
Islam, but is trying to raise aware
ness about some of the Palestin
ian Authority's policies of train
ing young children to engage in
violent acts.
Several Muslim students ex
pressed concern about what they
called a one-sided portrayal of
the issue.
"I'm afraid that they might
forget to show the other side,"
said Khadeeja Abdollah, a sec
ond-year undeclared student and
member of the Muslim Student
Association.
She added that the atmos
phere in which these children are
growing up a disputed area of
conflict is important to keep in
mind when watching the video.
Any interest the presentation
has spurred among students was
interpreted as a positive step to
ward starting dialogue between

the two groups, Neihaus said.
"Other than a few cases, the
reaction has been a largely posi
tive one and students have shown
a lot of interest and curiosity,"
Neihaus said.
He believes that even opposi
tion to the display can be seen as
a positive thing since it made peo
ple stop and it promoted dia
logue.
But other students believed
the video did not promote peace
ful discourse.
"There is constantly talk
about the lack of peaceful dia
logue and relations between the
two groups... a video like this that
only enforces stereotypes, is defi
nitely not helpful in reaching that
goal," said Lena Khan, a second
year political science and history
student who is also an MSA
member.
Those active in the campus's
prominent Muslim group were
not the only ones concerned with
BFl's presentation.
Gideon Baum, president of the
Jewish Student Union, said the
presentation reflects poorly on
the Jewish community as a whole.
BFI is only one part of the
Jewish community and the ma
jority of the community does not
support the way BFI is going
about advertising for their event,
even though it might be political
ly effective, he said.
Baum said he also believes
BFI should have rescheduled its
event since it was a well-known
fact that this week is Islamic
Awareness Week.
But Neihaus maintains that his
group is promoting peace
through the program.
The display was aimed at pro
moting a Monday campus ap
pearance of Itamar Marcus, who
is the director of a group called
Palestinian Media Watch. Ita
mar's group compiles footage of
the media in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip and its affect on the
children living in those regions.
