# So, who's your dentist???
## Intermission editors bite the big one 
### NICOLE BECKLEY KARAN MAHAJAN SOON-TO-BE-INTERMISSION-EDITORS-EMERITI 
When we set up shop in the crashed cockpit that is the In
termission cubicle four months ago, we had no (working) com
puter, no (working) phone, no layout (person), and no idea
how soon we would become addicted to caffeine and crack.
But what else can you expect when you're on an Intermis
sion from God'?
So, after a quarter and a half of piloting this baby into dusk,
waking to coffee and hate-mail, intimidating our writers with
neurotic e-mails and appealing to a campus-wide puritanical
streak with the mythical exploits of Saint Sass, I can say with
confidence: Nothing has changed. Everything is still broken,
and the shit continues to hit the fan.
As it should! After all, as someone once famously said
we aren't here to change the world; we're here to offend it. We
hope your Mom is really pissed. Yeah.
Kudos to our writers for excellent content our hepcat

film critics Anna North and Chris Lee reeled through the lat
est movies and graced our pages with an unprecedented cyni
cism, our avuncular reviewers blew the covers off the campus
Lively Arts scene And the rest of us whored ourselves out
to a record number of celebrities (Ben Affleck, Elijah Wood,
Ashton Kutcher, Katie Holmes, Sean Penn, Benecio Del
Toro, etc), broadcasting this subliminal message to college
readers: If you try hard enough, you can be a successful groupie
too!
But enough irony. It's you, dear reader, that we must real
ly thank your innovations have made Intermission the #1
source of nose-tissue, ass-wipe and gift-wrap, and we value our
increased market share in those industries. Still, we can't help
but hope that Intermission had a role, albeit small, in making
you the indie-hipster-mack-daddy you totally are. Right?
Right?
Damn. As you can see, both of us are individuals who revel
in delusions. So thanks for sticking it out with us, and we'll miss
you all. We may've lost our intellectual virginity to the lascivi

ous demon of arts & entertainment but baby, it's been worth it
it's totally been worth it.
So, with that, we say an enormous thanks to those who
have labored with us on this high speed wacked-out head trip:
All the past Intermission editors, who gave us their love
and support, and then went abroad.
Roxy Sass, who taught us everything we know about hick
ies.
Masha Kubyshina, who took over the enormous task of
laying out the section every week as we changed our minds
more than Elizabeth Taylor's changed husbands.
Ninjas, for being cool and kicking ass.
Beth Liebert our cover girl who created breathtak
ing covers in order to draw the reader's attentions away from
our inane jokes. And it worked. Even Elijah Wood never
looked this pretty!
And to our editors, Mark Dominik,(lntermission wouldn't
be so beautiful with out you!) and Ramin Setoodeh, editor-in
chief, who always kept us on our twinkle toes.
