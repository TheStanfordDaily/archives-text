# This 'Perfect Score' guarantees failure
## 
### ANNA NORTH FILM CRITIC 
There's nothing wrong with a good B movie. It lets you put your feet up,
sink down in your seat, give your intellect the night off. Every now and then,

it's nice to eat your candy and watch it too.
But "The Perfect Score" is not a good B
movie. It's not quite satisfied with candy
status — it sort of wants to be healthy, too,
and that's where it gets in trouble. Let's
face it: A film that starts out with the words
"Suck-Ass Test" is never going to be brain
food.
The Suck-Ass Test in question is the
SAT, of course, and it's getting Kyle (Chris
Evans) and his friend Matty (Brian Green
berg) down. Kyle's got a good GPA — we
know because it appears onscreen along
with his name — but he can't fulfill his
dream of studying architecture at Cornell
until he brings up his 1020 score. And
Matty just wants to get into the University
of Maryland to be with his older girlfriend
Sandy.
The two decide their solution is to steal
the answers to the SAT. The test isn't fair,
after all — they're good guys, why
shouldn't they do well? So they enlist the

help of sexy Francesca Curtis (Scarlett Johansson), a self-described "poor
little rich girl" whose dad works for nearby ETS, the company that produces
the SAT.
Francesca hops on board after Kyle appeals to her feminism by pointing
out the test's gender bias. More teammates follow. Basketball star Desmond
Rhodes (Darius Miles) is in "because the test is racist," straight-A student
Anna Ross (Erika Christensen) because her parents push her too hard, and

slacker Roy (Leonardo Nam) because, well, he happened to be smoking out
in the bathroom where Kyle and Matty were discussing the plan.
This cast of characters turns out to be an odd mix of junky and whol—
some think vegetable candy. On one side we've got Roy, hamming it up
as a whacko whose dream is to be Blanka, a man-eating character from the

game "Streetfighter II." On the other there's
Desmond, who in making a decision be
tween going pro and going to college actu
ally tries to be thought-provoking.
The story of the theft is a similar mix.
The kids engage in some wacky hi-jinks, and,
true to form, some of them hook up with one
another. But these B-movie staples are inter
spersed with homilies on topics like testing
bias, parent-child relationships, and living life
on your own terms. I won't give away the end
ing, but let me assure you everyone learns
something.
Rather than lending weight to the film,
all this learning just kills the fun. Kyle be
comes bland and lifeless, a moral example
with Luke Perry sideburns. The sparks you'd
expect among a bunch of hot teens dampen
beneath chaste kisses. And the knowledge
that all these nice kids are going to be better
for this destroys the tension of the heist itself.
"The Perfect Score" is at its best when it's at
its B-est. It's hard not to laugh when Roy

makes fun of a bird or, in the nick of time, reveals himself to be a four-star
hacker. And watching indie-queen Johansson slut it up in plaid miniskirts
should be a treat for film buffs and teenage boys alike.
If "The Perfect Score II" ever comes out and with this genre, it's not
an impossibility I want to see more sex. More jokes. Less moralizing. Be
cause when I get candy at the movies, I want a nice gooey Snickers bar
not a tomato tootsie pop.
