# Sundance: One film critic's personal journey!
## 
### CHRIS LEE SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's a mere one week after the fact, and Sun
dance already seems like some sort of fuzzy, time
less memory I might have completely dreamt up.
The reasons for this are twofold: One, I started my
Sundance weekend already deliriously sleep-de
prived, having stayed up the previous two nights
scrambling to get an EE lab and problem set due;
and two, there's just something very surreal that
happens when the tiny ski town of Park City, Utah
becomes inundated with the Hollywood hype and
hysteria that not even L. A. can convincingly contain
for most of the year. Before there were corporate
sponsorships, before there were premieres of big
movies that already had distribution, there must
have been something called independent film here.
I jest, of course — Sundance still tries to accommo
date that most romantic notion of the indie — but
even to this relative Sundance newbie there is un
doubtedly something hideously commercial brew
ing, corrupting everything in its path. Maybe it's the
celebrity stalking, maybe it's the fact that every per
son you sit down next to is there to network, but
there's a suspiciously slick veneer over it all that
seems to have nearly rubbed out everything about
this festival that might have once been considered
edgy and underground.
But enough of my nostalgia for an age I never
participated in — it's still about the movies, right?
So how were the movies? Mostly underwhelming.
My Stanford Film Society cohorts and I were only
there for less than half the festival, but even as such,
the programming slate seemed to lack the sparkle
and buzz of last year. Then again, I have to confess
that I myself may have betrayed the independent

spirit more often than not, opting to go to more
movies with recognizable names or production
power than the riskier, more potentially rewarding
fare. Case in point: waiting not once but twice in the
waitlist line for Zach Braff s uneven debut "Garden
State," one of the hottest (and perhaps overrated)
tickets at the festival. Getting in was glorious
(thanks Mike and Ben, for enduring the torture);
the movie, not quite so much.
It speaks volumes that one of the more reward
ing films I saw, "Last Life in the Universe," came
from Thailand. The real lesson here: Take risks with
your choices. The truly independent films will most

likely never be heard from again, so Sundance is re
ally your only chance to see them. And even with
this knowledge, my sense of reasoning completely
abandoned me on Sunday as I found myself some
how attending a screening for "The Butterfly Ef
fect," one of the "most offensively B-grade pictures
masquerading as thinking-man's entertainment I
have ever seen. My only saving grace was sitting
next to Newsday's critic John Anderson; together
we snorted and guffawed for our very lives through
the movie as one plot absurdity piled onto another.
Ah, the wonderful camaraderie of film elitism.
Thankfully, there were a few good Sundance
success stories too Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dy
namite," a quirky character study of a small-town
Idaho student, truly was dynamite, even despite my
falling asleep ever so briefly (if you've ever won
dered whether an unbelievably brilliant movie can
combat any amount of sleep deprivation, the an
swer is a resounding NO). With help from Fox
Searchlight it should soon be in a theater relatively
near you, and I look forward to seeing it again in its
entirety. And Shane Carruth's "Primer," a much
more successful attempt at dramatic science fiction,
left me joyously confused over its sly, pretzel-like
plot. Amazingly it ended up winning the Grand Jury
award; shot for a mere $7,000, it's exactly the type of
movie Sundance was meant to promote and a wor
thy recipient of the prize.
All in all, it was still a fantastic weekend. I re
turned to my humble Stanford life more tired than
before, but happily so. I have a collection of 12 or 13
ticket stubs which I think granted me access to that
many films. Do I remember seeing them all? Not a
chance. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.

ticket stubs which I think granted me access to that
many films. Do I remember seeing them all? Not a
chance. Would I do it again? In a heartbeat.
