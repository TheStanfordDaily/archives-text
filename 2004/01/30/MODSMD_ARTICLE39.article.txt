# Procrastination tool of choice: Nintendo's newest games
## 
### ERIC FORD 
Highly anticipated games, mysterious system announcements, and finally
overtaking Microsoft in the console wars; things are definitely looking
good for Nintendo these days.

Right after an early January announcement in which the Big
N announced to the world that Gamecube system had sold a
record number of units in 2003,1 was given the opportuni
ty sit down with some employees of the popular video
game company and test drive two of the hottest up
coming games: namely SquareEnix's "Final Fantasy:
Crystal Chronicles" and Nintendo's "Metroid Zero."

Metroid Zero
It's been 19 years since the world was introduced
to Samus Aran in the original "Metroid" title. Now,
with "Metroid Zero", Nintendo revisits the classic
title with a whole new adventure loosely based on
the original game: Samus Aran must battle the no
torious space pirates headed by the Mother Brain.
Having never played the old "Metroid" title, I
found this GBA game incredibly engrossing. The
graphics and music have been completely updated
to look like "Metroid Fusion," Nintendo's previ
ous GBA version of the game. The game play,
however, is reminiscent of the classic "Super
Metroid", preserving the 2D side scrolling action that
made the series famous.

This game is definitely recommended for every
"Metroid" fan out there. Not only does it breathe life back
into the original that started it all, but, with the addition of an ex
panded story, new cut scenes, and replayability even after the final
boss is destroyed, it's a title that shouldn't be missed.

Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles
After 10 years of absence, a "Final Fantasy" game has at last found it's way
onto a Nintendo video game system. "Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles" is a game

that doesn't follow the traditional game play methods of the numbered titles in the acclaimed RPG
(role playing game) series; instead, it provides gamers with an addicting four-player co-op mul
tiplayer setup featuring the popular franchise. As SquareEnix's first title on the

Gamecube, FF:CC brings several innovative firsts to the system. In addition
to being the first console multiplayer "Final Fantasy" game (with the
exception of the online only massively multiplayer RPG Final Fan
tasy 11), FF:CC is also one of the few current titles to fully utilize
Nintendo's Gamecube / Game Boy Advance connectivity
system.

Multiplayer in FF:CC is absolutely phenomenal.
When you manage to grab three other friends and four
GBAs together in the same room, be prepared for an
experience unlike any other. The game really encour
ages complete and total cooperation; transforming the
four players into one cohesive unit that is in constant
communication with each of its individual members.
The only downside to multiplayer is that FF:CC re
quires that each player use a Game Boy Advance as a
controller. So, unless your friends each have a portable
gaming system of their own, they're left out of the fun.
However, I think the multiplayer experience that one
achieves when playing this game is definitely worth
the trouble.

On the other hand, the single player mode on FF:CC
definitely isn't anywhere as enjoyable as the multiplay
er part. Maybe it's the lack of an exciting atmosphere, or
the absence of a cooperative environment. Either way, I
advise solo game enthusiasts to give this one a rental before
picking it up. If you do have friends with GB As, however, this
is the hottest game to pick up.

Metroid Zero and Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles will be available
from local retailers on February 9th for $34.99 (Metroid) and $49.99
(FF. CC). If you pre-order FF:CC, you also get a free Gamecube-GBA link
cable (while supplies last).
