The University has decided to withdraw from the Association of Research
Libraries (ARL) due to concerns with its operations, according to officials. Stan
ford helped found the society more than 70 years ago.
ARL is a non-profit membership organization of leading North American
research libraries, whose 123 members include almost all of Stanford's peer in
stitutions. It aims to influence the future of research libraries by promoting eq
uitable access to and effective use of recorded knowledge, according to its Web
site.
"ARL is not serving the needs of this institution or of the community of re
search institutions as we understand them," said University Librarian Michael
Keller in a press release. "We have other ways of engaging productively with our
peers and partners in the research community."
The withdrawal went into effect earlier this month after Stanford notified
ARL President Sarah Thomas during winter break.
The decision was made by Keller after University President John Hennessy,
Provost John Etchemendy and the heads of five campus coordinate libraries ad
ministratively separate from Stanford University Libraries and Academic In
formation Resources unanimously agreed with Keller's opinion, according to
the press release.
The main concern was that the association requires labor-intensive reports
along with approximately $20,000 in dues annually, issues introduced during an
annual review of expenses and engagements, Keller said.
"The bottom line is that we no longer saw a return on Stanford's continued
investment of dues, of reporting effort or of staff engagement in ARL," Keller
said.
Keller criticized the organization for mission drift, weak oversight of pro
grams and direction, inadequate management on the part of members and lack
of cost-benefit analysis.
