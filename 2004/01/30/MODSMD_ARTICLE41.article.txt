# Don't Forget About... Phoenix

Sophia Coppola's 2003 film "Lost in Transla
tion" tells the story of two American travelers in
Japan (played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Jo
hanssen) who overcome a sense of alienation to
make peace with themselves and the culture they
are immersed in. The turn
ing point for Murray's
character comes wordless
ly through music. He and
Johanssen have loosened
up and finally discovered a
side of Japan that they like
among the haze of Shin
juku clubs and karaoke.
Murray's character is hav
ing such a good time, he
actually starts dancing to
the throwback synth-pop

of Phoenix's "Too Young," finally freed of his
cares and the baggage of age.
The scene struck a chord for me. Like Mur
ray's character, I visited the bright lights of Japan,
staying for five months. And like Murray's charac
ter, some of my most memorable experiences
came from the glow of the Japanese nightlife and
the carefree air of nightclubs. In fact, the first time

I heard Phoenix was "Too Young" in a
Kyoto club not long after I arrived in Japan.
I immediately bought "United," their 2000
debut from Astralwerks / Source, and
Phoenix has occupied a steady space in my
CD player and on my mix tapes ever since.

The lads in Phoenix hail from France
and got their start playing Hank Williams and
Prince covers in the French bar circuit. They got
their break when they were signed to Paris-based
Source Records and became friends with label
mates and makeout-music kings Air. Playing back
up band duties for Air on several U.K. television

appearances seem to have matured the band's
sound and shaped it towards electronica and
synth-pop, with the results of their growth soon to
follow.
Phoenix released "United" in 2000, and on the
album give an electronica-charged study in pop /

rock of the past 25 years. From the opening chords
of the instrumental power-pop of "School's
Rules," it's clear that "United" is a musical time
capsule.
"Too Young" follows, an incredible single that
caught both Bill Murray's attention and mine. The
song begins with an ethereal synth line and a
muted guitar riff seemingly lifted from Miami

Vice, then brings in pristine vocals and a disco-fla
vored melody that makes you want to leave the
track on repeat for an hour.

"United" continues to deliver essential 70's
and 80's throwbacks throughout. "If I Ever Feel
Better," a brokenhearted love letter, effortlessly

throws in a toe-tapping disco beat. Three consecu
tive tracks, "On Fire," "Embuscade" and "Sum
mer Days," offer lazy, happy pop a la the Bee
Gees.
Then comes the epic "Funky Squaredance," a
three-part track that first takes on country and

western, then moves to club
funk, and finally into heavy
metal. The track piles on
everything from crazy gui
tar heroics to the talents of
bassist Deck D'Arcy's
mother and her choral soci
ety. Finally, the closing in
strumental "Definitive
Breaks" revisits the muted
guitar and synth theme of
"Too Young," and closes
the album like an alternate,
peaceful ending to Grand

Theft Auto: Vice City.
The U.S. version of the album also includes a
bonus remix of "Too Young" by fellow synth-pop
pers Zoot Woman. The Reading, UK band adds a
dash of electro-pop to give the track a more distant,
futuristic feel. However, the remix unfortunately
falls short of the heights reached by the original.

As those of us who have discovered the genius
of "United" breathlessly await another
Phoenix release, the album has recently
begun to receive long-overdue attention. In
addition to being featured on "Lost in Trans
lation" (and continuing to get club play),
"Too Young" recently appeared on Jack
Black's comedy "Shallow Hal."

Whenever Phoenix decides to record again, they
have already left us a stunning document of then
pop sensibilities in "United." Charming and bril
liant, "United" appeals to rockers, synth-poppers,
rock revivalists, soundtrack collectors, clueless
tourists in Japan, and just about everyone else.

appearances seem to have matured the band's
sound and shaped it towards electronica and
synth-pop, with the results of their growth soon to
follow.
Phoenix released "United" in 2000, and on the
album give an electronica-charged study in pop /

rock of the past 25 years. From the opening chords
of the instrumental power-pop of "School's
Rules," it's clear that "United" is a musical time
capsule.
"Too Young" follows, an incredible single that
caught both Bill Murray's attention and mine. The
song begins with an ethereal synth line and a
muted guitar riff seemingly lifted from Miami

Vice, then brings in pristine vocals and a disco-fla
vored melody that makes you want to leave the
track on repeat for an hour.

"United" continues to deliver essential 70's
and 80's throwbacks throughout. "If I Ever Feel
Better," a brokenhearted love letter, effortlessly

throws in a toe-tapping disco beat. Three consecu
tive tracks, "On Fire," "Embuscade" and "Sum
mer Days," offer lazy, happy pop a la the Bee
Gees.
Then comes the epic "Funky Squaredance," a
three-part track that first takes on country and

western, then moves to club
funk, and finally into heavy
metal. The track piles on
everything from crazy gui
tar heroics to the talents of
bassist Deck D'Arcy's
mother and her choral soci
ety. Finally, the closing in
strumental "Definitive
Breaks" revisits the muted
guitar and synth theme of
"Too Young," and closes
the album like an alternate,
peaceful ending to Grand

Theft Auto: Vice City.
The U.S. version of the album also includes a
bonus remix of "Too Young" by fellow synth-pop
pers Zoot Woman. The Reading, UK band adds a
dash of electro-pop to give the track a more distant,
futuristic feel. However, the remix unfortunately
falls short of the heights reached by the original.

As those of us who have discovered the genius
of "United" breathlessly await another
Phoenix release, the album has recently
begun to receive long-overdue attention. In
addition to being featured on "Lost in Trans
lation" (and continuing to get club play),
"Too Young" recently appeared on Jack
Black's comedy "Shallow Hal."

Whenever Phoenix decides to record again, they
have already left us a stunning document of then
pop sensibilities in "United." Charming and bril
liant, "United" appeals to rockers, synth-poppers,
rock revivalists, soundtrack collectors, clueless
tourists in Japan, and just about everyone else.

Phoenix's "United" (2000) is
an electronica-charged study in
pop-rock of the past
