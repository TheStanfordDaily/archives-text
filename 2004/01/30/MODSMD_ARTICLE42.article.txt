# Pete Rock rolls with the homies
## 
### MARCELO SOLORZANO 
Pete Rock, the legendary producer who has been influencing hip
hop through his contributions for years, just dropped two previously unre
leased albums on BBE / Rapster, "Lost and Found Hip Hop Underground
Soul Classics." This package features the smooth beat wizard with the group
INI on one album and a lesser known emcee named Deda on the other. On
both, Pete Rock shines behind the boards, even if he still doesn't receive the

critical props he de-

serves.

Pete Rock & CL Smooth. The two musicians
. shared a vibe that few emcee and D J com-

binations have approached, and their
L discography consists of at least two

masterpiece albums. Subse
quently, every high-caliber

rapper in the industry began
to take notice of Pete Rock's
abilities and he recorded
tracks with Nas, Public
Enemy, Busta Rhymes, also
launching several lesser
known artists into the spot
light. After a few solo albums
the soul-brother created

"Petestrumentals," an instrumental album that displayed jazz and soul style
hip-hop at its best and rejuvenated his following in the United States.
With this double re-release, Pete Rock is able to showcase his skills behind
less dominating emcees. His quality production is infused with saxophone
riffs, enchanting bass lines, and cuts from old Biggie, Nas and Gangstarr
records. The albums are journeys where each song gets better than the last
one — the beats are so smooth that you have to listen to the track again just to
try to pay attention to the rapper's words.

The first track on the
"Baby Pa" album, "Every
man," combines a slick jazz
beat with an even slicker guitar
riff. As always, Pete Rock adds
new instrumental tones that he
manipulates in his lab and then

proceeds to throw it all behind emcees that spit:
"Silent like stone with the pound when I come around / 40's on the ground
just listenin to the sound."
The credit is given where it is due, and the album takes off. The next track
plays off of the last one and Pete Rock's magical touch is felt in a subtle way
throughout the album even though it drives it.
A Pete Rock album is not going to provide the kinds of beats you'd expect
to hear at a club — this is a piece for chill settings. The producer's musical sense
never lets the listener down, so with both albums he provides 29 solid songs for
$lB. The albums are literally blasts from the past, and bring back that feel of
soulful hip-hop that has been lost somewhat in the last decade. While new
producers on the block like Kanye West are revisiting what Pete Rock start
ed, none can duplicate the mastery that the #1 soul-brother has been present
ing on his past albums and once again with "Lost and Found Hip Hop Un
derground Soul Classics."
