# Movie Highlight: "DIG!"
## 
### Barrett Sheridan 
Even if you're into music, you might
have overlooked the Dandy Warhols
and you've probably never heard of the
Brian Jonestown Massacre. Obscurity,
however has never been a barricade to
success: Just look at the naughty boys of
Jackass, who redefined Warhol's famous
maxim on "15 Minutes."
"DIG!" charts the not-so-parallel
progress of the two bands through the
late nineties. The Warhols glide from
peak to trough to peak, in the end playing
before crowds of 100,000 throughout Eu
rope. The Massacre, on the other hand,
sinks to Death Valley lows; they break up
time and again, only to reform, spit out a
record, and then get kicked off yet anoth
er label.
But the most gripping story in
"DIG!" Is that of Anton Newcombe, the
furious force behind the Brian
Jamestown Massacre. The son of an alco
holic father who left his son when he was
one and later killed himself on his son's
birthday and a mother that called the
cops on him when she caught him grow
ing marijuana, he is repeatedly referred
to as a "musical genius."
Here's a taste of Anton: He claims to
play 80 instruments, including the guitar
(of course), accordion, and "weird
fuckin' Chinese shit." He's the kind of
guy that says things like, "We're going to
kick off a whole musical revolution."
He's the kind of guy who says things like,
"I am the Son of God."
As one record exec said, he's the kind
of guy who is "trying to integrate his mys
tic vision with his messed-up personali
ty."
He's also the kind of guy who kicks
fans in the head at shows; for whom it is
peculiar to finish a gig without throwing
fists at a band-mate; who shoots heroin
and then shouts at his poor fiance; who
sends members of the Dandy Warhols
(his friends, remember?) shot gun shells
with their names on it.
In short, he's the most mesmerizing
documentary subject on film.
Director Ondi Timoner, a 30-year
old Yale grad, shot 1,500 hours of footage
over seven years for the film. The result is
that we get to see a number of intriguing
parallels: A touring Brian Jamestown
Massacre plays beneath a local Commu
nist party headquarters while the Dandy
Warhols record an album over a parking
garage that bums piss in; Anton is pulled
over in Georgia and arrested for posses
sion of marijuana while the Dandy
Warhols, touring in Europe, are pulled
over in France and given a light fine for
possession the police let them keep
the marijuana.
You get to see a lot of cool things in
"DIG!": how the bands go from being re
spectful best friends to rivals; the inner
workings of the indeed music machine
and, not least of all, Anton's luscious
(perversely fascinating?) downward spi
ral. You don't have to be a fan of either
band to enjoy "DlG!"â€”in fact, maybe it
would be better if you weren't.
