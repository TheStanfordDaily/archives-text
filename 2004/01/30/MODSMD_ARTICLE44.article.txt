Napoleon Dynamite
Dir. byJaredHess
Our Rating: 5 out of 5

The name "Napoleon Dynamite" invokes images
of some kind of Marvel superhero, complete with bound
less strength, unsurpassed coolness and a pair of navy blue
moon boots to be worn over the pants of course. In
writer / director Jared Hess's film, the title character has
of those three traits. Unfortunately, it's the moon

the new kid in school become partners in crime, and
Pedro needs Napoleon to help win the class presidency,
usurping the snotty Summer Wheatley. After applying all
of the usual campaign tactics ("Vote for Pedro" T's, "Vote
for Pedro" buttons, smacking a Summer Wheatley pina
ta), it's up to Napoleon to secure Pedro's election.This is,
simply put, one of the funniest comedies I have ever seen.
Heder's Napoleon is absolutely perfect; he manages to re
cant every line with a defensive air, and the moon boots
look so natural on him, it's almost frightening. But really,
it's the little things in this film that make it so splendidly
comical, like the way Napoleon grabs a huge handful of

his pocket consumption. The production design

Garden State
Dir. Zach Braff
Our Rating: 5 out of 5.

I sat through over 20 hours of movies in three days at

Sundance, but "Garden State" was, without a doubt, my
favorite film of the festival. Zach Braff of NBC's
"Scrubs," makes his first foray into cinema with "Garden
State," a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. I saw
it at 9 a.m. on my third day at the festival, and after three
nights with a cumulative total of 12 hours of sleep, it took
a lot to keep my attention. However, "Garden State"
kept me riveted.
"Garden State" stars Braff as a medicated, desensi
tized actor in L.A. forced to come home to New Jersey
when his mother dies. There he meets a delightfully quirky
Natalie Portman and, predictably, love ensues.
But to really get an idea of "Garden State," think of a
cleaner, more mature "Igby Goes Down" or an updated,
poppier version of "The Graduate." It's a hard movie to
limit to one category: It's hilarious, but also incredibly ten
der.
Braff displays canny direction. The film opens with a
number of memorable images: an impeccably arranged
medicine cabinet, a young man standing against a wall
with a shirt of the same pattern as the wallpaper, and an
extraordinarily white bedroom sans decorations. Another
mesmerizing scene is an overhead shot of Braff and Port
man in a lit pool at nighttime the camera descending
slowly as she breaststrokes towards him.
If I have a gripe about this movie, it's that the well
crafted scenes such as those previously mentioned give it
a staccato feel as if Braff picked and chose the most

brilliant items from his book of ran
dom thoughts and ideas rather

than designing a coherent whole.
At least the moments themselves
are beautiful and original.
Portman's character is like an
assemblage of quirky, offbeat char
acters, like Penny Lane from "Al
most Famous" or Penelope Cruz in
"Vanilla Sky," rather than a charac
ter of her own but endearing
anyway, and the sedated emotions
of Braffs quietly pained character
start to get old right at the moment
he changes and becomes interesting
again (a tribute to Braffs writing.)
Go see "Garden State." It's
nothing like its eponymous mem
ber of the Union.

The Machinist
Dir. Brad Anderson
Oin Rating: 4.out of 5

Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this role. Yes, that's
right, the lean, sculpted and emotionless yuppie from
"American Psycho," director Christopher Nolan's future
Batman, looks like a gutted fish in this movie. His cheeks
are hollow. His ribs (and every other bone) show. He has
a waistline that Paris Hilton would admire. And, when
asked how he did it, how he shed a second-grader, he an
swered, in that thick Welsh accent of his: "A lot of coke."
Ah, Mr. Bale - where would we be without inspired per
formances like his Jack Kelly turn in "Newsies"? In "The
Machinist," Bale is, well, a machinist, slowly wasting away.
He hasn't slept in a year. He can barely eat. He halluci
nates. But why?
Screenwriter Alan Kosar's harrowing script explores
dark pop psychology (he researched a condition called
fatal familial insomnia while writing.) Mr. Anderson's di
rection makes "The Matrix" look like a bright world of
puppies and lollipops. "The Machinist" is a great, original
thriller that reminds you of the good things in independent
cinema.
