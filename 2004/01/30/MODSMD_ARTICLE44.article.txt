Garden State
Dir. Zach Braff
Our Rating: 5 out of 5.

I sat through over 20 hours of movies in three days at

Sundance, but "Garden State" was, without a doubt, my
favorite film of the festival. Zach Braff of NBC's
"Scrubs," makes his first foray into cinema with "Garden
State," a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. I saw
it at 9 a.m. on my third day at the festival, and after three
nights with a cumulative total of 12 hours of sleep, it took
a lot to keep my attention. However, "Garden State"
kept me riveted.
"Garden State" stars Braff as a medicated, desensi
tized actor in L.A. forced to come home to New Jersey
when his mother dies. There he meets a delightfully quirky
Natalie Portman and, predictably, love ensues.
But to really get an idea of "Garden State," think of a
cleaner, more mature "Igby Goes Down" or an updated,
poppier version of "The Graduate." It's a hard movie to
limit to one category: It's hilarious, but also incredibly ten
der.
Braff displays canny direction. The film opens with a
number of memorable images: an impeccably arranged
medicine cabinet, a young man standing against a wall
with a shirt of the same pattern as the wallpaper, and an
extraordinarily white bedroom sans decorations. Another
mesmerizing scene is an overhead shot of Braff and Port
man in a lit pool at nighttime the camera descending
slowly as she breaststrokes towards him.
If I have a gripe about this movie, it's that the well
crafted scenes such as those previously mentioned give it
a staccato feel as if Braff picked and chose the most

brilliant items from his book of ran
dom thoughts and ideas rather

than designing a coherent whole.
At least the moments themselves
are beautiful and original.
Portman's character is like an
assemblage of quirky, offbeat char
acters, like Penny Lane from "Al
most Famous" or Penelope Cruz in
"Vanilla Sky," rather than a charac
ter of her own but endearing
anyway, and the sedated emotions
of Braffs quietly pained character
start to get old right at the moment
he changes and becomes interesting
again (a tribute to Braffs writing.)
Go see "Garden State." It's
nothing like its eponymous mem
ber of the Union.

The Machinist
Dir. Brad Anderson
Oin Rating: 4.out of 5

Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this role. Yes, that's
right, the lean, sculpted and emotionless yuppie from
"American Psycho," director Christopher Nolan's future
Batman, looks like a gutted fish in this movie. His cheeks
are hollow. His ribs (and every other bone) show. He has
a waistline that Paris Hilton would admire. And, when
asked how he did it, how he shed a second-grader, he an
swered, in that thick Welsh accent of his: "A lot of coke."
Ah, Mr. Bale - where would we be without inspired per
formances like his Jack Kelly turn in "Newsies"? In "The
Machinist," Bale is, well, a machinist, slowly wasting away.
He hasn't slept in a year. He can barely eat. He halluci
nates. But why?
Screenwriter Alan Kosar's harrowing script explores
dark pop psychology (he researched a condition called
fatal familial insomnia while writing.) Mr. Anderson's di
rection makes "The Matrix" look like a bright world of
puppies and lollipops. "The Machinist" is a great, original
thriller that reminds you of the good things in independent
cinema.

film "Good Bye, Lenin!"
With the Soviet bloc ripping apart at its seams, young
Alex Kerner (played convincingly by Daniel Briihl) is a
young liberal, advocating Western-style freedoms in his
country of East Germany. His mother, Christiane (Ka
trin Sass) is a strident socialist, and when she witnesses
her beloved son entangled with police at an anti-Berlin
Wall rally, she suffers a heart attack and falls into an eight
month long coma.
When she finally awakens, Christiane finds herself
quite literally in another country, a reunited Germany.
When doctors warn that another shock could prove fatal
for his mother, Alex decides to take her home and pre
tend nothing has happened. He rearranges her bedroom
to rid it of Western influence, and even fabricates East
German news programs so she may watch television
without knowing the truth.
This movie provides for some great comedic mo
ments, such as Alex's laborious quest to find the discon
tinued East German government-issued pickles to satis
fy his mother's craving. But "Good Bye, Lenin!" is more
a political satire and domestic drama than a lowbrow
comedy. The fall of the Berlin Wall, not its existence, en
slaves Alex, limiting his actions. The film criticizes both
political systems, condemning the Western materialism
brought to East Germany by Coca-Cola and Burger
King, but also the thought control of the former Com
munist bloc. In a poetic twist, the
Kerner family dynamics mirror the
turmoil of the nation. "Good Bye,
Lenin!" is a winning combination
of comedy, satire and drama.

Overnight
Dir. by Mark Brian Smith
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

One day, Troy Duffy is a blue-col
lar stiff, a grisly-bearded Los Ange
les bartender and heavy-metal gui
tarist. The next, he's Hollywood's
talk of the town. Duffy's story is an
example of why people see hope in
trying to strike it big and move to
L.A ... until it comes crashing
down.
This real-life documentary is al
most too absurd to be true. Duffy
sells his brilliant scriot for "The

ovxxo.- i.ua yuujiCUH isviipt lui iUv
Boondock Saints" to Harvey Weinstein and Miramax
for $300,000. To sweeten the deal, Weinstein agrees that
Duffy will direct the film (whose budget will top $l5 mil
lion) and provide the songs for the soundtrack. Duffy is
an abrupt success across two media. He even gets film
maker pals Mark Brian Smith and Tony Montana to
chronicle his ascent to superstardom.
Treating his newfound status as his birthright,
Duffy's incredible ego alienates his family and friends,
and trashes any future he may have had in the music and
film industries. With his movie and record deals dissolv
ing at his feet, Duffy tries valiantly to defend his own ge
nius; by now, however, everyone around him has caught
on that he is just a big, hairy, violent, profane goof, and
not at all the artiste he claims to be. Stardom did not
change Troy Duffy; it just amplified his preexisting abra
siveness.

Major props to Smith and Montana for their willing
ness to stay within a mile of this prick for seven years in
order to make this film.

The Saddest Music in the World
Dir. by Guy Maddin
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

The Place: Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Time: During
the depths of the Great Depression. To increase lagging
sales of her company's beer, the legless Lady Port-Hunt
ley (Isabella Rossellini) devises a competition to be
broadcast on the radio. Each country is to have a repre-

sentative musical act to show that it is they who have
"The Saddest Music in the World." The loser in each
round must slide into an enormous vat of beer. Natural
ly-
Representing the United States is Chester Kent,
who devises a whimsical vaudevillian act starring his am
nesiac nymphomaniac girlfriend, whose ex-husband (co
incidentally Chester's brother) is competing for Serbia.
The Kent brothers' alcoholic father competes for Cana
da, but is tormented by his role in the loss of the Lady's
legs. So, acting like any respectable man, he builds her a
new pair, made of glass and filled with beer. Could any
thing be finer?
Alternating between brilliant, frenetic, tragic, and
comic, Saddest Music offers an incredible visual experi
ence that completely overpowers the absurd plot. Shot in
jittery black and white, the film resembles the lovechild
of 1920s silent film and 70s psychedelic experiment. The
visual imagery coupled with the absurdly bizarre plot and
the too-serious acting result in an uncompromisingly
original piece of entertainment.

The Fight
Dir. by Barak Goodman
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

70 million Americans tuned their radios to listen to a
boxing match? Sounds absurd, like Seabiscuit being the
biggest story of 1938 (a claim proven false), but it's not.
That's right; 70 million Americans listened to the second
fight between African-American Joe Louis and German
Max Schmeling on June 22,1938 from Yankee Stadium.
It was "The Fight."
Barak Goodman's film revisits an event that high
lighted the transcendental nature of sports: In one corner
was Louis, a man who wasn't allowed to sit in the front
half of the bus in many parts of his own country, but who
would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma
chine in the ring. Schmeling was no Nazi (he personally
hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con
temporary interviews. "The Fight" is for anyone inter
esting in a highly combustive era, not just boxing fans.

Zatoichi
Dir. by Takeshi Kitano
Our Rating: 3 out of 5.

Americans tend to think that foreign film is either
well below them or pretentiously above them. Let me
couch this review in terms that any American can under
stand, then. Remember Quentin Tarantino's bloody
samurai opus, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" (the second part of which
opens this March)? Remember the arterial sprays, the
decapitations, the red-festooned walls, the body-covered
floors? Remember how over-the-top and wonderfully
violent it all was? Remember how groundbreaking it was
in American cinema? Well, Mr. Kitano, the director of
"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a
man (or woman) with a sword, and "Zatoichi" studiously dis
plays most of them.

CSA: The Confederate States of America
Dir. by Kevin Willmott
Our Rating: 2.5 out of 5.
It's hard to dislike the premise behind CSA: a mockumen
tary, it details what the last 100 years would have been like had
the South won the Civil War. Non-Christian religions are
banned (Catholicism is okay), B-movies of the 1950s have titles
like "I Married an Abolitionist," and Southerners bent on
global domination take over all of Central and South America
and install a system of apartheid.
There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first
man on the moon planting a Confederate flag on its gray land
scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on
"servant etiquette" are just two. However, CSA is a one-trick
pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at
first, old by the end. One can stand only so much talk of
"Northern aggression" and TV shows like "Leave it to Beu
lah."

The Clearing
Dir. Pieter Jan Brugge
Our Rating: 3.5 out of 5.
Cynics might revel in the fact that Robert Redford,
founder of the Sundance Film Festival, is the star of one of the
festival's premieres. Because, of course, Redford really needs
this film to do well. If it doesn't, how will he pay his utility bill?
Actually, this is the first Redford movie in the festival's twenty
year history. This movie is a tight thriller-slash-drama starring
Willem Dafoe as a tormented kidnapper and Redford as his
(shocker!) brave, stone-faced captive.
The movie has the kind of performances you'd expect of its
great stars and clean, uncomplicated direction from Jan
Brugge (a longtime producer in his directorial debut.) Nothing
spectacular is accomplished here, but it's worth a viewing.

There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first

scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on

pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at

Cynics might revel in the fact that Robert Redford,
founder of the Sundance Film Festival, is the star of one of the
festival's premieres. Because, of course, Redford really needs
this film to do well. If it doesn't, how will he pay his utility bill?
Actually, this is the first Redford movie in the festival's twenty
year history. This movie is a tight thriller-slash-drama starring
Willem Dafoe as a tormented kidnapper and Redford as his
(shocker!) brave, stone-faced captive.
The movie has the kind of performances you'd expect of its
great stars and clean, uncomplicated direction from Jan
Brugge (a longtime producer in his directorial debut.) Nothing
spectacular is accomplished here, but it's worth a viewing.

Garden State
Dir. Zach Braff
Our Rating: 5 out of 5.

I sat through over 20 hours of movies in three days at

Sundance, but "Garden State" was, without a doubt, my
favorite film of the festival. Zach Braff of NBC's
"Scrubs," makes his first foray into cinema with "Garden
State," a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. I saw
it at 9 a.m. on my third day at the festival, and after three
nights with a cumulative total of 12 hours of sleep, it took
a lot to keep my attention. However, "Garden State"
kept me riveted.
"Garden State" stars Braff as a medicated, desensi
tized actor in L.A. forced to come home to New Jersey
when his mother dies. There he meets a delightfully quirky
Natalie Portman and, predictably, love ensues.
But to really get an idea of "Garden State," think of a
cleaner, more mature "Igby Goes Down" or an updated,
poppier version of "The Graduate." It's a hard movie to
limit to one category: It's hilarious, but also incredibly ten
der.
Braff displays canny direction. The film opens with a
number of memorable images: an impeccably arranged
medicine cabinet, a young man standing against a wall
with a shirt of the same pattern as the wallpaper, and an
extraordinarily white bedroom sans decorations. Another
mesmerizing scene is an overhead shot of Braff and Port
man in a lit pool at nighttime the camera descending
slowly as she breaststrokes towards him.
If I have a gripe about this movie, it's that the well
crafted scenes such as those previously mentioned give it
a staccato feel as if Braff picked and chose the most

brilliant items from his book of ran
dom thoughts and ideas rather

than designing a coherent whole.
At least the moments themselves
are beautiful and original.
Portman's character is like an
assemblage of quirky, offbeat char
acters, like Penny Lane from "Al
most Famous" or Penelope Cruz in
"Vanilla Sky," rather than a charac
ter of her own but endearing
anyway, and the sedated emotions
of Braffs quietly pained character
start to get old right at the moment
he changes and becomes interesting
again (a tribute to Braffs writing.)
Go see "Garden State." It's
nothing like its eponymous mem
ber of the Union.

The Machinist
Dir. Brad Anderson
Oin Rating: 4.out of 5

Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this role. Yes, that's
right, the lean, sculpted and emotionless yuppie from
"American Psycho," director Christopher Nolan's future
Batman, looks like a gutted fish in this movie. His cheeks
are hollow. His ribs (and every other bone) show. He has
a waistline that Paris Hilton would admire. And, when
asked how he did it, how he shed a second-grader, he an
swered, in that thick Welsh accent of his: "A lot of coke."
Ah, Mr. Bale - where would we be without inspired per
formances like his Jack Kelly turn in "Newsies"? In "The
Machinist," Bale is, well, a machinist, slowly wasting away.
He hasn't slept in a year. He can barely eat. He halluci
nates. But why?
Screenwriter Alan Kosar's harrowing script explores
dark pop psychology (he researched a condition called
fatal familial insomnia while writing.) Mr. Anderson's di
rection makes "The Matrix" look like a bright world of
puppies and lollipops. "The Machinist" is a great, original
thriller that reminds you of the good things in independent
cinema.

film "Good Bye, Lenin!"
With the Soviet bloc ripping apart at its seams, young
Alex Kerner (played convincingly by Daniel Briihl) is a
young liberal, advocating Western-style freedoms in his
country of East Germany. His mother, Christiane (Ka
trin Sass) is a strident socialist, and when she witnesses
her beloved son entangled with police at an anti-Berlin
Wall rally, she suffers a heart attack and falls into an eight
month long coma.
When she finally awakens, Christiane finds herself
quite literally in another country, a reunited Germany.
When doctors warn that another shock could prove fatal
for his mother, Alex decides to take her home and pre
tend nothing has happened. He rearranges her bedroom
to rid it of Western influence, and even fabricates East
German news programs so she may watch television
without knowing the truth.
This movie provides for some great comedic mo
ments, such as Alex's laborious quest to find the discon
tinued East German government-issued pickles to satis
fy his mother's craving. But "Good Bye, Lenin!" is more
a political satire and domestic drama than a lowbrow
comedy. The fall of the Berlin Wall, not its existence, en
slaves Alex, limiting his actions. The film criticizes both
political systems, condemning the Western materialism
brought to East Germany by Coca-Cola and Burger
King, but also the thought control of the former Com
munist bloc. In a poetic twist, the
Kerner family dynamics mirror the
turmoil of the nation. "Good Bye,
Lenin!" is a winning combination
of comedy, satire and drama.

Overnight
Dir. by Mark Brian Smith
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

One day, Troy Duffy is a blue-col
lar stiff, a grisly-bearded Los Ange
les bartender and heavy-metal gui
tarist. The next, he's Hollywood's
talk of the town. Duffy's story is an
example of why people see hope in
trying to strike it big and move to
L.A ... until it comes crashing
down.
This real-life documentary is al
most too absurd to be true. Duffy
sells his brilliant scriot for "The

ovxxo.- i.ua yuujiCUH isviipt lui iUv
Boondock Saints" to Harvey Weinstein and Miramax
for $300,000. To sweeten the deal, Weinstein agrees that
Duffy will direct the film (whose budget will top $l5 mil
lion) and provide the songs for the soundtrack. Duffy is
an abrupt success across two media. He even gets film
maker pals Mark Brian Smith and Tony Montana to
chronicle his ascent to superstardom.
Treating his newfound status as his birthright,
Duffy's incredible ego alienates his family and friends,
and trashes any future he may have had in the music and
film industries. With his movie and record deals dissolv
ing at his feet, Duffy tries valiantly to defend his own ge
nius; by now, however, everyone around him has caught
on that he is just a big, hairy, violent, profane goof, and
not at all the artiste he claims to be. Stardom did not
change Troy Duffy; it just amplified his preexisting abra
siveness.

Major props to Smith and Montana for their willing

order to make this film.

The Saddest Music in the World
Dir. by Guy Maddin
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

The Place: Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Time: During
the depths of the Great Depression. To increase lagging
sales of her company's beer, the legless Lady Port-Hunt
ley (Isabella Rossellini) devises a competition to be
broadcast on the radio. Each country is to have a repre-

sentative musical act to show that it is they who have
"The Saddest Music in the World." The loser in each
round must slide into an enormous vat of beer. Natural
ly-
Representing the United States is Chester Kent,
who devises a whimsical vaudevillian act starring his am
nesiac nymphomaniac girlfriend, whose ex-husband (co
incidentally Chester's brother) is competing for Serbia.
The Kent brothers' alcoholic father competes for Cana
da, but is tormented by his role in the loss of the Lady's
legs. So, acting like any respectable man, he builds her a
new pair, made of glass and filled with beer. Could any
thing be finer?
Alternating between brilliant, frenetic, tragic, and
comic, Saddest Music offers an incredible visual experi
ence that completely overpowers the absurd plot. Shot in
jittery black and white, the film resembles the lovechild
of 1920s silent film and 70s psychedelic experiment. The
visual imagery coupled with the absurdly bizarre plot and
the too-serious acting result in an uncompromisingly
original piece of entertainment.

The Fight
Dir. by Barak Goodman
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

70 million Americans tuned their radios to listen to a
boxing match? Sounds absurd, like Seabiscuit being the
biggest story of 1938 (a claim proven false), but it's not.
That's right; 70 million Americans listened to the second
fight between African-American Joe Louis and German
Max Schmeling on June 22,1938 from Yankee Stadium.
It was "The Fight."
Barak Goodman's film revisits an event that high
lighted the transcendental nature of sports: In one corner
was Louis, a man who wasn't allowed to sit in the front
half of the bus in many parts of his own country, but who
would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma
chine in the ring. Schmeling was no Nazi (he personally
hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con
temporary interviews. "The Fight" is for anyone inter
esting in a highly combustive era, not just boxing fans.

Zatoichi
Dir. by Takeshi Kitano
Our Rating: 3 out of 5.

Americans tend to think that foreign film is either
well below them or pretentiously above them. Let me
couch this review in terms that any American can under
stand, then. Remember Quentin Tarantino's bloody
samurai opus, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" (the second part of which
opens this March)? Remember the arterial sprays, the
decapitations, the red-festooned walls, the body-covered
floors? Remember how over-the-top and wonderfully
violent it all was? Remember how groundbreaking it was
in American cinema? Well, Mr. Kitano, the director of
"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a
man (or woman) with a sword, and "Zatoichi" studiously dis
plays most of them.

CSA: The Confederate States of America
Dir. by Kevin Willmott
Our Rating: 2.5 out of 5.
It's hard to dislike the premise behind CSA: a mockumen
tary, it details what the last 100 years would have been like had
the South won the Civil War. Non-Christian religions are
banned (Catholicism is okay), B-movies of the 1950s have titles
like "I Married an Abolitionist," and Southerners bent on
global domination take over all of Central and South America
and install a system of apartheid.
There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first
man on the moon planting a Confederate flag on its gray land
scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on
"servant etiquette" are just two. However, CSA is a one-trick
pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at
first, old by the end. One can stand only so much talk of
"Northern aggression" and TV shows like "Leave it to Beu

"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a
man (or woman) with a sword, and "Zatoichi" studiously dis
plays most of them.

CSA: The Confederate States of America
Dir. by Kevin Willmott
Our Rating: 2.5 out of 5.
It's hard to dislike the premise behind CSA: a mockumen
tary, it details what the last 100 years would have been like had
the South won the Civil War. Non-Christian religions are
banned (Catholicism is okay), B-movies of the 1950s have titles
like "I Married an Abolitionist," and Southerners bent on
global domination take over all of Central and South America
and install a system of apartheid.
There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first
man on the moon planting a Confederate flag on its gray land
scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on
"servant etiquette" are just two. However, CSA is a one-trick
pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at
first, old by the end. One can stand only so much talk of
"Northern aggression" and TV shows like "Leave it to Beu
lah."

Our Rating: 3.5 out of 5.
Cynics might revel in the fact that Robert Redford,
founder of the Sundance Film Festival, is the star of one of the
festival's premieres. Because, of course, Redford really needs
this film to do well. If it doesn't, how will he pay his utility bill?
Actually, this is the first Redford movie in the festival's twenty
year history. This movie is a tight thriller-slash-drama starring
Willem Dafoe as a tormented kidnapper and Redford as his
(shocker!) brave, stone-faced captive.
The movie has the kind of performances you'd expect of its
great stars and clean, uncomplicated direction from Jan
Brugge (a longtime producer in his directorial debut.) Nothing
spectacular is accomplished here, but it's worth a viewing.

Garden State
Dir. Zach Braff
Our Rating: 5 out of 5.

I sat through over 20 hours of movies in three days at

Sundance, but "Garden State" was, without a doubt, my
favorite film of the festival. Zach Braff of NBC's
"Scrubs," makes his first foray into cinema with "Garden
State," a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. I saw
it at 9 a.m. on my third day at the festival, and after three
nights with a cumulative total of 12 hours of sleep, it took
a lot to keep my attention. However, "Garden State"
kept me riveted.
"Garden State" stars Braff as a medicated, desensi
tized actor in L.A. forced to come home to New Jersey
when his mother dies. There he meets a delightfully quirky
Natalie Portman and, predictably, love ensues.
But to really get an idea of "Garden State," think of a
cleaner, more mature "Igby Goes Down" or an updated,
poppier version of "The Graduate." It's a hard movie to
limit to one category: It's hilarious, but also incredibly ten
der.
Braff displays canny direction. The film opens with a
number of memorable images: an impeccably arranged
medicine cabinet, a young man standing against a wall
with a shirt of the same pattern as the wallpaper, and an
extraordinarily white bedroom sans decorations. Another
mesmerizing scene is an overhead shot of Braff and Port
man in a lit pool at nighttime the camera descending
slowly as she breaststrokes towards him.
If I have a gripe about this movie, it's that the well
crafted scenes such as those previously mentioned give it
a staccato feel as if Braff picked and chose the most

brilliant items from his book of ran
dom thoughts and ideas rather

than designing a coherent whole.
At least the moments themselves
are beautiful and original.
Portman's character is like an
assemblage of quirky, offbeat char
acters, like Penny Lane from "Al
most Famous" or Penelope Cruz in
"Vanilla Sky," rather than a charac
ter of her own but endearing
anyway, and the sedated emotions
of Braffs quietly pained character
start to get old right at the moment
he changes and becomes interesting
again (a tribute to Braffs writing.)
Go see "Garden State." It's
nothing like its eponymous mem
ber of the Union.

The Machinist
Dir. Brad Anderson
Oin Rating: 4.out of 5

Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this role. Yes, that's
right, the lean, sculpted and emotionless yuppie from
"American Psycho," director Christopher Nolan's future
Batman, looks like a gutted fish in this movie. His cheeks
are hollow. His ribs (and every other bone) show. He has
a waistline that Paris Hilton would admire. And, when
asked how he did it, how he shed a second-grader, he an
swered, in that thick Welsh accent of his: "A lot of coke."
Ah, Mr. Bale - where would we be without inspired per
formances like his Jack Kelly turn in "Newsies"? In "The
Machinist," Bale is, well, a machinist, slowly wasting away.
He hasn't slept in a year. He can barely eat. He halluci
nates. But why?
Screenwriter Alan Kosar's harrowing script explores
dark pop psychology (he researched a condition called
fatal familial insomnia while writing.) Mr. Anderson's di
rection makes "The Matrix" look like a bright world of
puppies and lollipops. "The Machinist" is a great, original
thriller that reminds you of the good things in independent
cinema.

film "Good Bye, Lenin!"
With the Soviet bloc ripping apart at its seams, young
Alex Kerner (played convincingly by Daniel Briihl) is a
young liberal, advocating Western-style freedoms in his
country of East Germany. His mother, Christiane (Ka
trin Sass) is a strident socialist, and when she witnesses
her beloved son entangled with police at an anti-Berlin
Wall rally, she suffers a heart attack and falls into an eight
month long coma.
When she finally awakens, Christiane finds herself
quite literally in another country, a reunited Germany.
When doctors warn that another shock could prove fatal
for his mother, Alex decides to take her home and pre
tend nothing has happened. He rearranges her bedroom
to rid it of Western influence, and even fabricates East
German news programs so she may watch television
without knowing the truth.
This movie provides for some great comedic mo
ments, such as Alex's laborious quest to find the discon
tinued East German government-issued pickles to satis
fy his mother's craving. But "Good Bye, Lenin!" is more
a political satire and domestic drama than a lowbrow
comedy. The fall of the Berlin Wall, not its existence, en
slaves Alex, limiting his actions. The film criticizes both
political systems, condemning the Western materialism
brought to East Germany by Coca-Cola and Burger
King, but also the thought control of the former Com
munist bloc. In a poetic twist, the
Kerner family dynamics mirror the
turmoil of the nation. "Good Bye,
Lenin!" is a winning combination
of comedy, satire and drama.

Overnight
Dir. by Mark Brian Smith
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

One day, Troy Duffy is a blue-col
lar stiff, a grisly-bearded Los Ange
les bartender and heavy-metal gui
tarist. The next, he's Hollywood's
talk of the town. Duffy's story is an
example of why people see hope in
trying to strike it big and move to
L.A ... until it comes crashing
down.
This real-life documentary is al
most too absurd to be true. Duffy
sells his brilliant scriot for "The

ovxxo.- i.ua yuujiCUH isviipt lui iUv
Boondock Saints" to Harvey Weinstein and Miramax
for $300,000. To sweeten the deal, Weinstein agrees that
Duffy will direct the film (whose budget will top $l5 mil
lion) and provide the songs for the soundtrack. Duffy is
an abrupt success across two media. He even gets film
maker pals Mark Brian Smith and Tony Montana to
chronicle his ascent to superstardom.
Treating his newfound status as his birthright,
Duffy's incredible ego alienates his family and friends,
and trashes any future he may have had in the music and
film industries. With his movie and record deals dissolv
ing at his feet, Duffy tries valiantly to defend his own ge
nius; by now, however, everyone around him has caught
on that he is just a big, hairy, violent, profane goof, and
not at all the artiste he claims to be. Stardom did not
change Troy Duffy; it just amplified his preexisting abra
siveness.

Major props to Smith and Montana for their willing

The Saddest Music in the World
Dir. by Guy Maddin
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

The Place: Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Time: During
the depths of the Great Depression. To increase lagging
sales of her company's beer, the legless Lady Port-Hunt
ley (Isabella Rossellini) devises a competition to be
broadcast on the radio. Each country is to have a repre-

sentative musical act to show that it is they who have
"The Saddest Music in the World." The loser in each
round must slide into an enormous vat of beer. Natural
ly-
Representing the United States is Chester Kent,
who devises a whimsical vaudevillian act starring his am
nesiac nymphomaniac girlfriend, whose ex-husband (co
incidentally Chester's brother) is competing for Serbia.
The Kent brothers' alcoholic father competes for Cana
da, but is tormented by his role in the loss of the Lady's
legs. So, acting like any respectable man, he builds her a
new pair, made of glass and filled with beer. Could any
thing be finer?
Alternating between brilliant, frenetic, tragic, and
comic, Saddest Music offers an incredible visual experi
ence that completely overpowers the absurd plot. Shot in
jittery black and white, the film resembles the lovechild
of 1920s silent film and 70s psychedelic experiment. The
visual imagery coupled with the absurdly bizarre plot and
the too-serious acting result in an uncompromisingly
original piece of entertainment.

The Fight
Dir. by Barak Goodman
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

70 million Americans tuned their radios to listen to a
boxing match? Sounds absurd, like Seabiscuit being the
biggest story of 1938 (a claim proven false), but it's not.
That's right; 70 million Americans listened to the second
fight between African-American Joe Louis and German
Max Schmeling on June 22,1938 from Yankee Stadium.
It was "The Fight."
Barak Goodman's film revisits an event that high
lighted the transcendental nature of sports: In one corner
was Louis, a man who wasn't allowed to sit in the front
half of the bus in many parts of his own country, but who
would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma
chine in the ring. Schmeling was no Nazi (he personally
hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con
temporary interviews. "The Fight" is for anyone inter
esting in a highly combustive era, not just boxing fans.

Zatoichi
Dir. by Takeshi Kitano
Our Rating: 3 out of 5.

Americans tend to think that foreign film is either
well below them or pretentiously above them. Let me
couch this review in terms that any American can under
stand, then. Remember Quentin Tarantino's bloody
samurai opus, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" (the second part of which
opens this March)? Remember the arterial sprays, the
decapitations, the red-festooned walls, the body-covered
floors? Remember how over-the-top and wonderfully
violent it all was? Remember how groundbreaking it was
in American cinema? Well, Mr. Kitano, the director of
"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a

would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma

hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con

Zatoichi
Dir. by Takeshi Kitano
Our Rating: 3 out of 5.

Americans tend to think that foreign film is either
well below them or pretentiously above them. Let me
couch this review in terms that any American can under
stand, then. Remember Quentin Tarantino's bloody
samurai opus, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" (the second part of which
opens this March)? Remember the arterial sprays, the
decapitations, the red-festooned walls, the body-covered
floors? Remember how over-the-top and wonderfully
violent it all was? Remember how groundbreaking it was
in American cinema? Well, Mr. Kitano, the director of
"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a
man (or woman) with a sword, and "Zatoichi" studiously dis
plays most of them.

CSA: The Confederate States of America
Dir. by Kevin Willmott
Our Rating: 2.5 out of 5.
It's hard to dislike the premise behind CSA: a mockumen
tary, it details what the last 100 years would have been like had
the South won the Civil War. Non-Christian religions are
banned (Catholicism is okay), B-movies of the 1950s have titles
like "I Married an Abolitionist," and Southerners bent on
global domination take over all of Central and South America
and install a system of apartheid.
There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first
man on the moon planting a Confederate flag on its gray land
scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on
"servant etiquette" are just two. However, CSA is a one-trick
pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at
first, old by the end. One can stand only so much talk of
"Northern aggression" and TV shows like "Leave it to Beu
lah."

Our Rating: 3.5 out of 5.
Cynics might revel in the fact that Robert Redford,
founder of the Sundance Film Festival, is the star of one of the
festival's premieres. Because, of course, Redford really needs
this film to do well. If it doesn't, how will he pay his utility bill?
Actually, this is the first Redford movie in the festival's twenty
year history. This movie is a tight thriller-slash-drama starring
Willem Dafoe as a tormented kidnapper and Redford as his
(shocker!) brave, stone-faced captive.
The movie has the kind of performances you'd expect of its
great stars and clean, uncomplicated direction from Jan
Brugge (a longtime producer in his directorial debut.) Nothing
spectacular is accomplished here, but it's worth a viewing.

Garden State
Dir. Zach Braff
Our Rating: 5 out of 5.

I sat through over 20 hours of movies in three days at

Sundance, but "Garden State" was, without a doubt, my
favorite film of the festival. Zach Braff of NBC's
"Scrubs," makes his first foray into cinema with "Garden
State," a film that he wrote, directed and starred in. I saw
it at 9 a.m. on my third day at the festival, and after three
nights with a cumulative total of 12 hours of sleep, it took
a lot to keep my attention. However, "Garden State"
kept me riveted.
"Garden State" stars Braff as a medicated, desensi
tized actor in L.A. forced to come home to New Jersey
when his mother dies. There he meets a delightfully quirky
Natalie Portman and, predictably, love ensues.
But to really get an idea of "Garden State," think of a
cleaner, more mature "Igby Goes Down" or an updated,
poppier version of "The Graduate." It's a hard movie to
limit to one category: It's hilarious, but also incredibly ten
der.
Braff displays canny direction. The film opens with a
number of memorable images: an impeccably arranged
medicine cabinet, a young man standing against a wall
with a shirt of the same pattern as the wallpaper, and an
extraordinarily white bedroom sans decorations. Another
mesmerizing scene is an overhead shot of Braff and Port
man in a lit pool at nighttime the camera descending
slowly as she breaststrokes towards him.
If I have a gripe about this movie, it's that the well
crafted scenes such as those previously mentioned give it
a staccato feel as if Braff picked and chose the most

brilliant items from his book of ran
dom thoughts and ideas rather

than designing a coherent whole.
At least the moments themselves
are beautiful and original.
Portman's character is like an
assemblage of quirky, offbeat char
acters, like Penny Lane from "Al
most Famous" or Penelope Cruz in
"Vanilla Sky," rather than a charac
ter of her own but endearing
anyway, and the sedated emotions
of Braffs quietly pained character
start to get old right at the moment
he changes and becomes interesting
again (a tribute to Braffs writing.)
Go see "Garden State." It's
nothing like its eponymous mem
ber of the Union.

The Machinist
Dir. Brad Anderson
Oin Rating: 4.out of 5

Christian Bale lost 63 pounds for this role. Yes, that's
right, the lean, sculpted and emotionless yuppie from
"American Psycho," director Christopher Nolan's future
Batman, looks like a gutted fish in this movie. His cheeks
are hollow. His ribs (and every other bone) show. He has
a waistline that Paris Hilton would admire. And, when
asked how he did it, how he shed a second-grader, he an
swered, in that thick Welsh accent of his: "A lot of coke."
Ah, Mr. Bale - where would we be without inspired per
formances like his Jack Kelly turn in "Newsies"? In "The
Machinist," Bale is, well, a machinist, slowly wasting away.
He hasn't slept in a year. He can barely eat. He halluci
nates. But why?
Screenwriter Alan Kosar's harrowing script explores
dark pop psychology (he researched a condition called
fatal familial insomnia while writing.) Mr. Anderson's di
rection makes "The Matrix" look like a bright world of
puppies and lollipops. "The Machinist" is a great, original
thriller that reminds you of the good things in independent
cinema.

film "Good Bye, Lenin!"
With the Soviet bloc ripping apart at its seams, young
Alex Kerner (played convincingly by Daniel Briihl) is a
young liberal, advocating Western-style freedoms in his
country of East Germany. His mother, Christiane (Ka
trin Sass) is a strident socialist, and when she witnesses
her beloved son entangled with police at an anti-Berlin
Wall rally, she suffers a heart attack and falls into an eight
month long coma.
When she finally awakens, Christiane finds herself
quite literally in another country, a reunited Germany.
When doctors warn that another shock could prove fatal
for his mother, Alex decides to take her home and pre
tend nothing has happened. He rearranges her bedroom
to rid it of Western influence, and even fabricates East
German news programs so she may watch television
without knowing the truth.
This movie provides for some great comedic mo
ments, such as Alex's laborious quest to find the discon
tinued East German government-issued pickles to satis
fy his mother's craving. But "Good Bye, Lenin!" is more
a political satire and domestic drama than a lowbrow
comedy. The fall of the Berlin Wall, not its existence, en
slaves Alex, limiting his actions. The film criticizes both
political systems, condemning the Western materialism
brought to East Germany by Coca-Cola and Burger
King, but also the thought control of the former Com
munist bloc. In a poetic twist, the
Kerner family dynamics mirror the
turmoil of the nation. "Good Bye,
Lenin!" is a winning combination
of comedy, satire and drama.

Overnight
Dir. by Mark Brian Smith
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

One day, Troy Duffy is a blue-col
lar stiff, a grisly-bearded Los Ange
les bartender and heavy-metal gui
tarist. The next, he's Hollywood's
talk of the town. Duffy's story is an
example of why people see hope in
trying to strike it big and move to
L.A ... until it comes crashing
down.
This real-life documentary is al
most too absurd to be true. Duffy
sells his brilliant scriot for "The

ovxxo.- i.ua yuujiCUH isviipt lui iUv
Boondock Saints" to Harvey Weinstein and Miramax
for $300,000. To sweeten the deal, Weinstein agrees that
Duffy will direct the film (whose budget will top $l5 mil
lion) and provide the songs for the soundtrack. Duffy is
an abrupt success across two media. He even gets film
maker pals Mark Brian Smith and Tony Montana to
chronicle his ascent to superstardom.
Treating his newfound status as his birthright,
Duffy's incredible ego alienates his family and friends,
and trashes any future he may have had in the music and
film industries. With his movie and record deals dissolv
ing at his feet, Duffy tries valiantly to defend his own ge
nius; by now, however, everyone around him has caught
on that he is just a big, hairy, violent, profane goof, and
not at all the artiste he claims to be. Stardom did not
change Troy Duffy; it just amplified his preexisting abra
siveness.

Major props to Smith and Montana for their willing

order to make this film.

The Saddest Music in the World
Dir. by Guy Maddin
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

The Place: Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Time: During
the depths of the Great Depression. To increase lagging
sales of her company's beer, the legless Lady Port-Hunt
ley (Isabella Rossellini) devises a competition to be
broadcast on the radio. Each country is to have a repre-

sentative musical act to show that it is they who have
"The Saddest Music in the World." The loser in each
round must slide into an enormous vat of beer. Natural
ly-
Representing the United States is Chester Kent,
who devises a whimsical vaudevillian act starring his am
nesiac nymphomaniac girlfriend, whose ex-husband (co
incidentally Chester's brother) is competing for Serbia.
The Kent brothers' alcoholic father competes for Cana
da, but is tormented by his role in the loss of the Lady's
legs. So, acting like any respectable man, he builds her a
new pair, made of glass and filled with beer. Could any
thing be finer?
Alternating between brilliant, frenetic, tragic, and
comic, Saddest Music offers an incredible visual experi
ence that completely overpowers the absurd plot. Shot in
jittery black and white, the film resembles the lovechild
of 1920s silent film and 70s psychedelic experiment. The
visual imagery coupled with the absurdly bizarre plot and
the too-serious acting result in an uncompromisingly
original piece of entertainment.

The Fight
Dir. by Barak Goodman
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

70 million Americans tuned their radios to listen to a
boxing match? Sounds absurd, like Seabiscuit being the
biggest story of 1938 (a claim proven false), but it's not.
That's right; 70 million Americans listened to the second
fight between African-American Joe Louis and German
Max Schmeling on June 22,1938 from Yankee Stadium.
It was "The Fight."
Barak Goodman's film revisits an event that high
lighted the transcendental nature of sports: In one corner
was Louis, a man who wasn't allowed to sit in the front
half of the bus in many parts of his own country, but who
would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma
chine in the ring. Schmeling was no Nazi (he personally
hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con
temporary interviews. "The Fight" is for anyone inter

The Kent brothers' alcoholic father competes for Cana
da, but is tormented by his role in the loss of the Lady's
legs. So, acting like any respectable man, he builds her a
new pair, made of glass and filled with beer. Could any
thing be finer?
Alternating between brilliant, frenetic, tragic, and
comic, Saddest Music offers an incredible visual experi
ence that completely overpowers the absurd plot. Shot in
jittery black and white, the film resembles the lovechild
of 1920s silent film and 70s psychedelic experiment. The
visual imagery coupled with the absurdly bizarre plot and
the too-serious acting result in an uncompromisingly
original piece of entertainment.

The Fight
Dir. by Barak Goodman
Our Rating: 4 out of 5.

70 million Americans tuned their radios to listen to a
boxing match? Sounds absurd, like Seabiscuit being the
biggest story of 1938 (a claim proven false), but it's not.
That's right; 70 million Americans listened to the second
fight between African-American Joe Louis and German
Max Schmeling on June 22,1938 from Yankee Stadium.
It was "The Fight."
Barak Goodman's film revisits an event that high
lighted the transcendental nature of sports: In one corner
was Louis, a man who wasn't allowed to sit in the front
half of the bus in many parts of his own country, but who
would be held up as a symbol, not only of his race, but of
his country when seemingly facing the entire WWII ma
chine in the ring. Schmeling was no Nazi (he personally
hid two Jewish boys from the SS), but he was Hitler's
man, and would be fighting in defense of the doctrine of
Aryan racial supremacy.
Goodman's film depicts much more than a bout that
lasted just a few brutal minutes if takes us back to an
era defined by the ebbing Depression, the imminent war
and the birth of the Civil Rights movement as we know
it. Goodman also managed to dig up some amazing
footage from the '3os, as well as some engrossing con
temporary interviews. "The Fight" is for anyone inter
esting in a highly combustive era, not just boxing fans.

Zatoichi
Dir. by Takeshi Kitano
Our Rating: 3 out of 5.

Americans tend to think that foreign film is either
well below them or pretentiously above them. Let me
couch this review in terms that any American can under
stand, then. Remember Quentin Tarantino's bloody
samurai opus, "Kill Bill Vol. 1" (the second part of which
opens this March)? Remember the arterial sprays, the
decapitations, the red-festooned walls, the body-covered
floors? Remember how over-the-top and wonderfully
violent it all was? Remember how groundbreaking it was
in American cinema? Well, Mr. Kitano, the director of
"Zatoichi," has been doing all this for years.
"Zatoichi," which has already grossed $25 million in
Japan, is the story of a blind nomad. He's old and en
dearing, kind of like the grandfather you wish you had.
He also hides a razor-sharp blade in his cane and is a mas
ter swordsman. When he comes to a small mountain vil
lage under the grips of the ruthless Ginzo gang, it's time
for Mr. Zatoichi to mete out justice.
The plot is complicated and slow at times, and the

runtime is too long. But if you're a fan of the samurai genre,
don't miss "Zatoichi." There are only so many ways to kill a
man (or woman) with a sword, and "Zatoichi" studiously dis
plays most of them.

CSA: The Confederate States of America
Dir. by Kevin Willmott
Our Rating: 2.5 out of 5.
It's hard to dislike the premise behind CSA: a mockumen
tary, it details what the last 100 years would have been like had
the South won the Civil War. Non-Christian religions are
banned (Catholicism is okay), B-movies of the 1950s have titles
like "I Married an Abolitionist," and Southerners bent on
global domination take over all of Central and South America
and install a system of apartheid.
There are some powerfully scary images in CSA: The first
man on the moon planting a Confederate flag on its gray land
scape and a Martha Steward-like TV personality lecturing on
"servant etiquette" are just two. However, CSA is a one-trick
pony (how's that for a quaint turn of phrase?): it's innovative at
first, old by the end. One can stand only so much talk of
"Northern aggression" and TV shows like "Leave it to Beu
lah."

The Clearing
Dir. Pieter Jan Brugge
Our Rating: 3.5 out of 5.
Cynics might revel in the fact that Robert Redford,
founder of the Sundance Film Festival, is the star of one of the
festival's premieres. Because, of course, Redford really needs
this film to do well. If it doesn't, how will he pay his utility bill?
Actually, this is the first Redford movie in the festival's twenty
year history. This movie is a tight thriller-slash-drama starring
Willem Dafoe as a tormented kidnapper and Redford as his
(shocker!) brave, stone-faced captive.
The movie has the kind of performances you'd expect of its
great stars and clean, uncomplicated direction from Jan
Brugge (a longtime producer in his directorial debut.) Nothing
spectacular is accomplished here, but it's worth a viewing.
