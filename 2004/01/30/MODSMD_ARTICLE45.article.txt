Winner of the Sundance Dra
matic Grand Jury Prize,
"Primer" is everything you'd ex
pect from an independent film; a
budget that could barely cover
the monthly lease payments of a
Yugo, a cast made up almost ex
clusively of the director / writer /
producer / star's buddies, and a
plot that ties your cerebral cor
tex into knots.
"Primer" commences with no
title sequence at all. The audi
ence is simply plopped into a
kitchen-table conversation be
tween four mad scientists in
white Oxford shirts and bland
colored ties, costumes the men
wear throughout the film. These
well-dressed fellows have appar
ently just hit upon a great scien
tific discovery. With the
avalanche of words being hurled
at the audience, coupled with
the complete lack of expository
dialogue, we're almost totally
left in the lurch as to what's
going on here.
Soon, however, "Primer" grants"
its audience a semblance of clar
ity, as two of the scientists,
Aaron (the director Shane Car
ruth) and Abe (David Sullivan,
the only member of the cast who
actually auditioned for his role)
realize that their new invention
in Aaron's garage has a small
side effect; it transports its con
tents back in time, DeLorean
style. Aaron and Abe begin to
send themselves back, hours at a
time. This is harmless, they fig
ure. They make some money in
the market by knowing which
way stocks are headed, but they
make certain to stay isolated in a
motel room, ensuring they are
never in two places simultane
ously.
Soon, however, their plans turn
into a convoluted mess. When
Aaron and Abe discover some
one else has used their machine,
they realize that one of their
"doubles" must have told this
third party about it. To prevent
this from happening in the fu
ture, they must (natch) change
their past. As the two friends try
to unravel exactly how to alter
their past futures, they also
begin duping each other. Who's
playing whom?
This movie blew my mind. It was
shot in a way that kept the audi
ence at a safe distance from the
action, with nothing ever spelled
out clearly. Carruth and Sullivan
both give cold, non-emotive per
formances that fit quite nicely
with the robotic men they por
tray. This "Memento" meets
"Groundhog Day" story pro
vides continuous twists and
turns that will leave you scratch-
