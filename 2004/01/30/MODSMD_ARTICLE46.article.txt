# Television re-runs 'Moon'
## A
						Reissue of Televisions classic "Marque" 
### ALICE KIM STAFF WRITER 
Some people may think that punk is all about
not being able to play your instruments and gob
bing at the audience, all bad teeth and attitude,
but those suckers are wrong. Sure, minimalism is
great. When the Ramones or the Dead Boys rub
one out in a mere two minutes, it's thrilling - as
fast and satisfying as a pop Big Mac.
But, damn, did I just grow up or something?
Suddenly Television, these guitar-mad freaks,
these pretentious Rimbaud wannabes, own me
completely. Television is often lumped in with
the rest of the late seventies CBGB's punk
crowd, but instead of trying to destroy rock and
reanimate it as a sinewy garage Frankenstein,
they embrace form, they embrace intellectual
ism, and they sure as hell embrace practicing
their instruments.
We'll move to the passion and soul later, but
first these bastards are proficient! Tom Ver
laine and Richard Lloyd share lead guitar duties,
and the guitar work on "Marquee Moon" is
some of the best I've ever heard. Deadly, repeti
tive riffs blat under angular guitar solos, and
you've never heard music like this; this is music
from Mars! Instead of waiting to stick the solos
to you, ala Led Zeppelin or any other dinosaur
rock group you can imagine, Television pretends
that the whole song is a solo. Every note feels
fluid, catching on the atonal chords buried un
derneath.
Of course, all of this would be so much
wanking if it weren't for the rest of the band.
Fred Smith and Billy Ficca on bass and drums,
respectively, would have made a fantastic 'so's
R&B backing combo with their mastery of con
trolled funk. In Television, they provide the sup
port needed for Lloyd's abstract riffs and Ver
laine's improvisation.
I think that everyone at Stanford should go

buy "Marquee Moon," so I'm not too thrilled
about discussing an alienating aspect of Televi
sion, which is Tom Verlaine's voice. But I'm a
purveyor of truth, and I'll say this - it's an ac
quired taste. Saying that he sounds like a warbly
goat choking on blood might be unkind, but it's
not too far from the truth.
You just need to wait. Pretty soon, you'll
grow to love it. Perhaps it's because the music is
so incredibly shit hot, but everything about
"Marquee Moon" seems to fit together, and
Verlaine's idiosyncratic voice only adds to the
stark mood of the album. And now that I think
about it, I really wouldn't want anyone else to
sing these lyrics.
Verlaine sings about dirtbag poets strutting
in nightmare urban landscapes. In "See No
Evil," he embraces the nihilist in him, yelping, "I
understand a 11... / destructive urges... /it
seems so perfect... /1 SEE NO EVIL." The
lyrics are elevated, in an enjoyably dramatic and
pretentious way, but Verlaine has some fun. In
the spiky "Friction" (my absolute favorite), he
sings, "I start to spin the tale / you complain of
my DIC-" and here he coyly pauses, "-tion." It's
just a little thing, but I'm oddly reassured to see
these intimidating, wire-thin men make a silly
dick joke. It feels punk.
Oh yeah, this is a reissue. And reissue means
cute packaging and new bonus tracks. It's fantas
tic that Television is getting their due with a
cleaned-up reissue fresh 'n' hot out the kitchen.
"Little Johnny Jewel" is pretty good, opening
with bowel-loosening bass, cutesy plunking, and
Ficca going apeshit on the drums. The alternate
version of "See No Evil," "Friction," and "Mar
quee Moon" are fine, but they tend to freak me
out. I've already accepted that the album versions
are unsurpassable, and hearing them played dif
ferently makes me feel as though I'm in a parallel
universe in which I WAS NEVER BORN.
Honestly, though, I could care less about
these bonus tracks. Anything extra is interesting,
but unnecessary. "Marquee Moon" is already a
perfect album.
