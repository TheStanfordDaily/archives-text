# Eww... Naked Beatles!

The first thing I did when I got my copy of "Let It 8e... Naked" was to pop it into my
shiny i√üook and go to the last track, "Let It Be." Because I sure did hate the choir on that
song, and they must have gotten rid of it, right? I mean, that's the whole idea behind this
album, right? Riiiight...
The advertising is such a tease. Naked this ain't.
After all the hype, the really remarkable thing about "Let It Be ... Naked" is how much it
sounds like "Let It Be" played on random. Sure, some of the individual songs most notably,
"The Long and Winding Road" have been overhauled, but this is hardly a raw, stripped
down version of the "Get Back" sessions. Instead, it's just a tinkering and a retooling of the
original release to bring it closer to Paul McCartney's vision than producer Phil Spector's.
That said, most of the tracks do sound a little better this time around, and hey, it's still a
Beatles album so it's not bad, not by a long shot. Even if no amount of studio trickery could
make "The Long and Winding Road" a particularly interesting song, at least gems like "Two
of Us" and "Across the Universe" shine a little brighter now, and the new addition of "Don't
Let Me Down" is marvelous.
