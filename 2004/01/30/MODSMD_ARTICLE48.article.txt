# Postmodern Tyler gets reckless
## Intermission interviews author-actress Aisha Tyler 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION EDITOR 
It's not easy to be "six-foot tall with model good looks and the
smarts and savvy to go with it" and still be self-deprecating. It's
not easy to be able to talk about both bikini waxes and Sun Tzu's
"The Art of War," and be taken seriously. Yet somehow, this is
exactly what Aisha Tyler achieves in her new book "Swerve:
Reckless Observations of a Postmodern Girl." Graduating from
Dartmouth and El's "Talk Soup," tackling the role of Ross's lat
est love, Charlie, on NBC's "Friends," and making "Maxim"
magazine's Hot 100, Intermission talked to Tyler about just what
her secret is.
INTERMISSION: Your bio says that you have# degree in gov
ernment from Dartmouth, which you "blithely chucked" for Hol
lywood. Did you really "blithely chuck" it?
AISHA TYLER: Well, it was mildly blithe in that obviously you
work so hard to get to a school like Dartmouth, or like Stanford,
and it's a lot of work to get your degree, and I originally was going
to go to law school, but as soon as I got out of school I went
through this sort of transition and I was like, "I didn't do any of
the things I thought I wanted to do in college."
(...) I don't know if anything in life ever specifically qualified
me to be a comedian and an actor, but I'm definitely glad I have
a degree. At the very least, I'm more informed than some of my
colleagues.
INT: Were your parents supportive of your career choice?
TYLER: Not at first, n0... It took them a while to let go of the
idea that they weren't going to have a daughter who was arguing
~ases before the
. supreme court.
\ That was
what they
had kind
of
hoped
and
ex-

Leno, that they kind of resigned themselves. Even when I had
"Talk Soup" and all the other stuff, they were kind of skeptical, I
mean, to them I think 'Talk Soup' was just a like a really fancy
"Wayne's World." So, it took them a while, but now they're re
ally supportive.
INT: In the book you talk a lot about trying to explain the book's
premise to various people. Have you come to a final answer to
the "what is it about" question?
TYLER: I think so, I mean, it's funny, the book definitely
evolved as I wrote it... now when people ask me what it is, I just
say that it's kind of a collection of edgy, comedic pop culture...
I think there's a lot of social commentary in popular culture ... so
it's a kind of funny / social commentary book.
I think some of the comedians that I really admire, like
Richard Pryor or Chris Rock, like, they're really really funny, but
there's a lot of buried social commentary in their material, or not
buried at times, and I wanted to write a book that was really fun
and funny and fun to read, and fun to write, very conversational,
but have lots of ideas in it. So I think my background, my degree,
and the work that I did in college kind of helped it be more than
the typical comedian book, where everything is just a bunch of
jokes on a page, which can be very satisfying, but I just wanted to
write a book that was like, a little bit more substantial.
INT: The book also talks a lot about dating - do you have any ad
vice for women?
TYLER: Sometimes my girlfriends ask me for advice and there's
some in the book about you know, how to handle yourself... If
you had to pick a character from "Sex and the City," I tend to be
more of a Samantha than a Carrie. All my girlfriends are like,
"What should I do?" I'm like, "Don't call him, don't do anything.
Look at yourself, you're coming apart at the seams! Don't pick
up the phone, look what you're doing to yourself!"
(...) I'm definitely not old-fashioned, but I think that it's just so
much of our nature to just call, and be so emotionally over-abun
dant, and worrying and just spinning out of control like some kind
of you know, vibrating string.
INT: How did you land the "Friends" gig?
TYLER: I auditioned for the show. I think they [the producers]
knew me from "Talk Soup" and they were definitely interested
in me ... I was a huge fan of the show already so it was very kind
of overwhelming to be on it even though I've done a lot of T.V. I
remember being on the set and being like, "Oh my god, I'm in
Chandler and Monica's apartment, no way," going and looking
out the window and being like, "Man, it's just a hallway back
there."
INT: So, what's next? More books, more T.V., movies?
TYLER: I'm working on a couple of things. I have a movie com
ing out in March that I did with DMX and David Arquette, called
"Never Die Alone" that was at the Sundance festival
... and I already have an idea for my next book, which is fright
ening because after I wrote the first one I was like, "Aah, it's so
much work, never again!" but now I'm really excited.
Aisha Tyler will be at KresgeAuditorum on Feb. 5, 7 p.m. and per
forming live stand-up at Cobb's Comedy Club in San Francisco
Feb. 26-29.
