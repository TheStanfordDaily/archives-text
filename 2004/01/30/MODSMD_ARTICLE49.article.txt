# David Bowie puts Viagra out of business in San Jose
## 
### OLIVER RIZK RYAN SANDS 
What were you doing Tuesday night? I bet it
sucked. I bet you weren't being serenaded by the sexiest
57-year-old man alive. I bet you weren't screaming along
off-key to your favorite song with thousands of other
diehard rock 'n' roll fans. I bet you weren't getting a con
tact high from the skunk weed the 45-year-old two rows in
front of you was sharing with his tranny date. I bet you
weren't loving every minute of your life. I bet you weren't
seeing David Bowie live in beautiful downtown San Jose.
WELL I WAS, DAMMIT, AND IT WAS AWE
SOME. Promoting his new album, "Reality," Bowie
made a quick stop in the Bay Area to show us all he's still
got what it takes to give me a boner. Which is: a versatile
cornucopia of vocal personas, an endless repertoire of
emotionally charged glam-rock jams, and a nice little
British butt.
Seeing David Bowie live in concert is exactly the
opposite of reading The Daily. With every Daily article
you trudge through, your mind becomes numbed by the

poor quality and lack of integrity. With every song
Bowie belted out, parts of my brain I never knew
existed lit up in a euphoric celebration of one man's
creative prowess. As your copy of The Daily joins
the thousands of others that fill the recycling bin
outside of Storke Publication Building, you feel
like a little green demon has stolen away a vital part
of your life, never to return it. As I exited the HP
Pavilion Tuesday night, I felt like a Thin White
Duke had bestowed upon me a precious memory
that I can cherish for the rest of my life.
Bowie's opener, an updated version of the
classic "Rebel, Rebel," set the tone for a successful
evening, balancing hits from the '70s and '80s with
animated renditions of his more recent works. New
songs like "New Killer Star" and "Never Get Old"
were performed with such confidence and convic
tion that they seemed perfectly in place alongside
crowd-pleasers "Hang On To Yourself" and "He-

roes." The night was a testament to Bowie's continuing
artistic integrity; knowing that fans come out to hear the

classics, he delivers in spades, but not without intro
ducing them to his newest sound â€” a sound that will
surely join the classics they look forward to the next
time around.
The strength of his new material was best seen in
his encore rendition of "Bring Me the Disco King."
Accompanied only by original Ziggy-era pianist
Mike Garson, our hero slinked down the raised cat
walk, every member of the audience spellbound. As
passionate as its debut 30 years ago, "Life On Mars,"
drew a similarly powerful response from the atten
tive crowd. And droll as San Jose is, its Bowie fans
still got up on their feet, cheering for a startlingly ex
cited performance of the Freddie Mercury duet,
"Under Pressure." Longtime bassist Gail Ann
Dorsey filled in for Mercury, proving herself worthy
as she hit every falsetto note and scatted along to
Bowie's verses.
As a final and fitting coda, Bowie made a seam
less transition from "Reality" into fantasy, perform
ing a truly unforgettable "Ziggy Stardust."'The
Bowie onstage was the encapsulation of 35 years of
inspiring music, and for one Tuesday night, all was
well in the world.
