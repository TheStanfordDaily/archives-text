## Ambassador argues against Iraq war 
### JESSICA WANG STAFF WRITER 
Ambassador Thomas Graham expressed strong disapproval of the
current war in Iraq in a speech last night in Palo Alto, at which he dis
cussed the issues of preemptive war, preemptive attack and interna
tional law.
A prolific and influential figure in arms control legislation and interna
tional agreements, Graham focused on the issue of the Bush administra
tion's actions in the context of international law in a speech entitled "The
New U.S. Nuclear Doctrine of Preemption: It is Legal? Is it Moral?"
Graham argued that the Bush administration had broken the rules
of the U.N. Charter, which states that a nation can act in self-defense
only after it has been attacked.
"If there's one thing this country has stood for since World War 11,

it's international rule of law it's our very ethos," Graham said.
When discussing the issue of international negotiation, he reflected
on his experience in Jamaica during the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty negotiations as an illustration of how nations trade favors in
order to come to agreements.
"During negotiations, they told me that they would give me their
vote if I could raise the price of bananas ... which I couldn't do," Gra
ham said to laughs from the audience.
The audience asked Graham questions about current issues ranging
from the upcoming presidential election to the role of the media. For
many of the questions and throughout the speech, he cited experiences
from his 32 years working in the government.

war in Iraq last night in a speech in Palo Alto . He argued the current adminstration has violated the U.N. Charter.
Mark Collier, a philosophy lecturer at Stanford, ap
preciated the insight that Graham offered as "one of the
few people situated to accurately assess current Ameri
can foreign policy."
However, Carol St. Louis, a graduate student in the
Political Science Department, called the entire concept
of the speech "wishful thinking."
"Because the Bush administration doesn't care about
international standards, criticizing them from that point of
view is ineffective," St. Louis said. "Making an argument
based on legal matters will not sway their views because the
