# ACT's 'Doll's House' now prime property
## American Conservatory Theater: "A Doll's House" Directed by Carey Perloff, Translated by Paul Walsh 
### RANDY MANO 
As many of you might (or might not) remember from
your high-school English coursework, Henrik Ibsen's "A
Doll's House" beckons from a period of writing when the
repressed particularly unhappy housewives started to
get minds of their own. I never read this play, but I did
scrape through a dreadfully boring "awakening" from the
perspective of Kate Chopin, a contemporary of Ibsen.
Therefore, I feared for the worst going into this A.C.T. pro
duction, feared that Artistic Director Carey Perloff might
not fare well with an adaptation from this era.
Fortunately for all of us, that doesn't happen. Instead, a
very moving production of Ibsen's career-making text, led
by a tour-de-force performance from Rene Augesen,
makes this the best A.C.T. play I have seen thus far: The
austere set thankfully takes a backseat to the passions of

the actors and the lofty diction employed.
Augesen has worked extensively in both San Francisco
and New York, and her experience shows as she tackles a
tricky character in Nora Helmer. Nora is the prototypical
dissatisfied housewife, a doll who feels trapped inside a
loveless marriage of eight years in a small Norwegian town.
The dramatic self-realization ironically takes place over the
cheery Christmas holidays, just as things seem to be im
proving for the Helmers from a financial and family per
spective.
I loved Augesen. I could see her wiping away tears as
the dramatic Act 111 really pushed her emotions to the
limit. I could feel her anguish in suppressing a critical secret
from her husband and friends, one that could potentially
break the reality barrier for her. I could sense in her in
creasingly maddening diction and frenetic pleas for help
from her friends that she no longer wanted to play around
in a make-believe world filled with beautiful children, a
condescending husband, and toys like dolls and tea sets.
The three main male characters, meanwhile, seemed to

exist solely for the women to showcase their emerging indi
viduality: don't expect amazing depth or evolving charac
terization from them.
"A Doll's House" raises thought-provoking questions
still relevant in today's fast-paced world I see around me
a number of friends who find themselves in entrapping
jobs, relationships and families. Nora's defiance of the
norms of her time echoed by another fabulously well
performed character, Kristine Linde (Joan Harris-Gelb)
makes me cheer for those willing to take risks and promote
individuality.
One sparkling, spontaneous moment in this regard
comes near the end when Nora pointedly reminds her hus
band that women are always willing to sacrifice their lives
and honor for the sake of their spouses. In a liberal place
like San Francisco, applause burst from the audience. I can
only hope that such glimmers of independence will become
more visible for the sake of our nation and the world.
