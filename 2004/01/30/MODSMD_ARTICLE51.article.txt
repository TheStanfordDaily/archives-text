# An alienating Ant Farm'
## The 						Berkeley Art Museum: "Ant Farm: 1968 -1978" 
### CHRIS MEYER STAFF WRITER 
1968 was a remarkable year. Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy were assassinated. The Vietcong launched the Tet of
fensive against American troops in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali
was convicted of draft evasion. Chicago mayor Richard Daly un
leashed his police force to brutally subdue demonstrators and
delegates at the Democratic Party Convention. Student demon
strations in France toppled Charles de Gaulle's government.
John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists in a "Black
Power Salute" during the playing of The Star Spangled Banner
at the medal ceremony at the summer Olympics in Mexico City.
Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Soviet Union. Mao initiated
the cultural revolution in China.
1968 was also the year that the collaborative art and archi
tectural group "Ant Farm" was established in San Francisco.
The Berkeley Art Museum has given the group its first museum
retrospective, titled "Ant Farm: 1968-1978." The show, which
includes blueprints, architectural models, collages, videos and
sculpture, will be on view through April 25.
Ant Farm both reflected and sought to fuel the revolutionary
spirit of the time. It was initially founded as a radical architecture
and design firm by Doug Michel and Chip Lord (Curtis Shreier,
Hudson Marquez and W. Douglass Hurr joined later). The be
ginning of the exhibit displays a sort of manifesto written by the
group, explaining its name and philosophy: "A friend named
Ant Farm for us in response to a description of what we were
doing. We said, 'we are underground architects.' She said, 'Oh,
you mean like an ant farm?' 'Yes, yes, that's it,' we said." The
document continues, "Ant Farm was an apt metaphor. It pro
jects many images that seem descriptive of our work. An Ant
Farm is a self-contained community, its workers are all equals
and they accomplish things not possible individually."
This brief description conveys several defining aspects of
Ant Farm. The Ant Farmers were committed to Utopian ideals
and engaged in a serious cultural critique of America. On the
other hand, they al-

ways balanced
these qualities with
a strong sense of
humor.
In its early
years, Ant Farm pi
oneered "inflat

able" buildings as a form of alternative architecture. One such
large, mobile curvaceous structure is one of the exhibit's de

lights. It sits lightly on
the gallery floor, cre
ating the illusory
threat that it might
float to the ceiling
like a helium-filled
balloon. In an at
tempt to bring this ar
chitecture to the
masses, Ant Farm
published a do-it
yourself guide the
"Inflatocookbook"
in 1971.
The "House of
the Century" in An
gleton, Texas is one
of the few permanent
buildings designed by
Ant Farm. The house
resembles a cross be
tween an igloo and a
pair of giant bulging
eyeballs. However,
the design's bizarre
originality is difficult
to appreciate from

photographs on the exhibit's walls: it looks more like a movie still

than an actual house.
The unsatisfactory effect of this photograph encapsulates the
major problem of the exhibit. Most of the exhibit's contents are
detailed documents that require patient (i.e. tedious) examina
tion. I had to crane my neck to read the small type of the mani
festo. Perhaps it would have been better to extract important
phrases and enlarge them on the museum's walls.
Notable exceptions to an otherwise mediocre exhibit are the
inflatable and two videos that the group produced in 1975. The

videos, which
are only a few
minutes long,
run on a con
tinuous loop on
television mon
itors mounted
on the museum
walls.
"Media
Burn" is the
recording of an
event that was
staged in the
parking lot of
the Cow Palace
stadium in San
Francisco on
July 4, 1975.
The video be
gins with a
John Kennedy
Jr. look-a-like
introducing
himself in a
fake Boston ac
cent as "your
artist presi
dent." In the

mock president's brief speech, he explains that "we are a nation

addicted to television and the con
stant flow of mass media... now I
ask you, my fellow Americans, have
you ever wanted to put your foot
through your television screen?"
The tape then cuts to two figures in
astronaut-like garb climbing into a
futuristic vehicle named the "phan

torn dream car" (actually a converted 1959 Cadillac Eldorado).
As the national anthem plays, the two drivers ram the car

through a pyramid ot tlammg television
sets as a crowd cheers in the back
ground. Thus, Ant Farm uses one
American icon (the automobile) to de
stroy another (the television). The full
meaning of the video cannot be fully

under
stood with
out first
discussing
"The Eter
n a 1
Frame,"
A nt

Farm's second video of 1975.
Again, we see the Kennedy look-a
like. This time, he concludes his intro
ductory remarks with the phrase, "I'm
nothing more than an image on your
television set." The video then proceeds
to stage a re-enactment of Kennedy's
1963 assassination. The video ends with
a remark from the mock Kennedy, now
with his make-up removed: "I think a
lot of people find Kennedy interesting,
but no one find me as Kennedy inter
esting, which is interesting. But who

cares? We all killed Kennedy."

The videos pack a lot of punch: they successfully blend an ac
tivist political and cultural commentary with wit and energy.
They are obviously a criticism of the mass media the extent to
which the public buys into it, the control it has over the informa
tion we receive, and its power to act as a stand-in for reality.
Kennedy was one of the first modern icons whose popularity was
due in large part to television and his adeptness at dealing with
the media. Ant Farm was trying to call people's attention to how
television presents us with "images" that may or may not repre-

sent truth. When watching the videos, I was reminded of the way
totalitarian regimes rely on the repetition of simple iconic images
or phrases to maintain their power (think of the way Stalin or
Mao flooded their respective societies with portraits of them
selves).
The frame is "eternal" because we see certain images played
over and over ad nauseum. How many times have we each seen
the tape of Kennedy's assassination? 10 times? 20? 50? Yet how
many of us were actually in Dallas that day? When an image is
repeated endlessly, it replaces real experience and memory.
Everyone has had the experience of a photograph replacing ac
tual memory: When we have not seen someone in a long time,
our memories of that person become increasingly dependent on
the physical visual records we possess of them.
The Ant Farm videos are prescient when you consider that
they were made in 1975, before the creation of cable television,
the twenty-four news station or the internet. Our daily lives are

so saturated with
images that we
cease to be con
scious of their pres
ence. "Media
Burn" and "The
Eternal Frame" are
efforts to restore

our awareness of images so that they might cease to be so pow
erful.
Art Farm's arguments are reinforced by the fact that the
videos are by far the most compelling part of the exhibit. The ar
chitectural plans and other various documents in the show do not
lend themselves to a dynamic museum exhibit: Visitors must be
patient as the majority of the show's contents require painstak
ing reading of small lettering and diagrams. Overall, "Ant Farm:
1968-1978" disappointed me. The exhibit other than the
videos and the inflatable would be more engaging in book
form than in a museum. The videos ironically or fittingly?
are the most alluring and enduring testaments to the Art Farm's
creative output.

The show includes blueprints,
architectural models, collages,
videos and sculptures.

Ant Farm pioneered
"inflatable" buildings as a form
of alternative architecture.

1968 was a remarkable year. Martin Luther King and Robert
Kennedy were assassinated. The Vietcong launched the Tet of
fensive against American troops in Vietnam. Muhammad Ali
was convicted of draft evasion. Chicago mayor Richard Daly un
leashed his police force to brutally subdue demonstrators and
delegates at the Democratic Party Convention. Student demon
strations in France toppled Charles de Gaulle's government.
John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists in a "Black
Power Salute" during the playing of The Star Spangled Banner
at the medal ceremony at the summer Olympics in Mexico City.
Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Soviet Union. Mao initiated
the cultural revolution in China.
1968 was also the year that the collaborative art and archi
tectural group "Ant Farm" was established in San Francisco.
The Berkeley Art Museum has given the group its first museum
retrospective, titled "Ant Farm: 1968-1978." The show, which
includes blueprints, architectural models, collages, videos and
sculpture, will be on view through April 25.
Ant Farm both reflected and sought to fuel the revolutionary
spirit of the time. It was initially founded as a radical architecture
and design firm by Doug Michel and Chip Lord (Curtis Shreier,
Hudson Marquez and W. Douglass Hurr joined later). The be
ginning of the exhibit displays a sort of manifesto written by the
group, explaining its name and philosophy: "A friend named
Ant Farm for us in response to a description of what we were
doing. We said, 'we are underground architects.' She said, 'Oh,
you mean like an ant farm?' 'Yes, yes, that's it,' we said." The
document continues, "Ant Farm was an apt metaphor. It pro
jects many images that seem descriptive of our work. An Ant
Farm is a self-contained community, its workers are all equals
and they accomplish things not possible individually."
This brief description conveys several defining aspects of
Ant Farm. The Ant Farmers were committed to Utopian ideals
and engaged in a serious cultural critique of America. On the
other hand, they al-

ways balanced
these qualities with
a strong sense of
humor.
In its early
years, Ant Farm pi
oneered "inflat

able" buildings as a form of alternative architecture. One such
large, mobile curvaceous structure is one of the exhibit's de

lights. It sits lightly on
the gallery floor, cre
ating the illusory
threat that it might
float to the ceiling
like a helium-filled
balloon. In an at
tempt to bring this ar
chitecture to the
masses, Ant Farm
published a do-it
yourself guide the
"Inflatocookbook"
in 1971.
The "House of
the Century" in An
gleton, Texas is one
of the few permanent
buildings designed by
Ant Farm. The house
resembles a cross be
tween an igloo and a
pair of giant bulging
eyeballs. However,
the design's bizarre
originality is difficult
to appreciate from

photographs on the exhibit's walls: it looks more like a movie still

than an actual house.
The unsatisfactory effect of this photograph encapsulates the
major problem of the exhibit. Most of the exhibit's contents are
detailed documents that require patient (i.e. tedious) examina
tion. I had to crane my neck to read the small type of the mani
festo. Perhaps it would have been better to extract important
phrases and enlarge them on the museum's walls.
Notable exceptions to an otherwise mediocre exhibit are the
inflatable and two videos that the group produced in 1975. The

videos, which
are only a few
minutes long,
run on a con
tinuous loop on
television mon
itors mounted
on the museum
walls.
"Media
Burn" is the
recording of an
event that was
staged in the
parking lot of
the Cow Palace
stadium in San
Francisco on
July 4, 1975.
The video be
gins with a
John Kennedy
Jr. look-a-like
introducing
himself in a
fake Boston ac
cent as "your
artist presi
dent." In the

mock president's brief speech, he explains that "we are a nation

addicted to television and the con
stant flow of mass media... now I
ask you, my fellow Americans, have
you ever wanted to put your foot
through your television screen?"
The tape then cuts to two figures in
astronaut-like garb climbing into a
futuristic vehicle named the "phan

torn dream car" (actually a converted 1959 Cadillac Eldorado).
As the national anthem plays, the two drivers ram the car

through a pyramid ot tlammg television
sets as a crowd cheers in the back
ground. Thus, Ant Farm uses one
American icon (the automobile) to de
stroy another (the television). The full
meaning of the video cannot be fully

under
stood with
out first
discussing
"The Eter
n a 1
Frame,"
A nt

Farm's second video of 1975.
Again, we see the Kennedy look-a
like. This time, he concludes his intro
ductory remarks with the phrase, "I'm
nothing more than an image on your
television set." The video then proceeds
to stage a re-enactment of Kennedy's
1963 assassination. The video ends with
a remark from the mock Kennedy, now
with his make-up removed: "I think a
lot of people find Kennedy interesting,
but no one find me as Kennedy inter
esting, which is interesting. But who

cares? We all killed Kennedy."

The videos pack a lot of punch: they successfully blend an ac
tivist political and cultural commentary with wit and energy.
They are obviously a criticism of the mass media the extent to
which the public buys into it, the control it has over the informa
tion we receive, and its power to act as a stand-in for reality.
Kennedy was one of the first modern icons whose popularity was
due in large part to television and his adeptness at dealing with
the media. Ant Farm was trying to call people's attention to how
television presents us with "images" that may or may not repre-

sent truth. When watching the videos, I was reminded of the way
totalitarian regimes rely on the repetition of simple iconic images
or phrases to maintain their power (think of the way Stalin or
Mao flooded their respective societies with portraits of them
selves).
The frame is "eternal" because we see certain images played
over and over ad nauseum. How many times have we each seen
the tape of Kennedy's assassination? 10 times? 20? 50? Yet how
many of us were actually in Dallas that day? When an image is
repeated endlessly, it replaces real experience and memory.
Everyone has had the experience of a photograph replacing ac
tual memory: When we have not seen someone in a long time,
our memories of that person become increasingly dependent on
the physical visual records we possess of them.
The Ant Farm videos are prescient when you consider that
they were made in 1975, before the creation of cable television,
the twenty-four news station or the internet. Our daily lives are

so saturated with
images that we
cease to be con
scious of their pres
ence. "Media

totalitarian regimes rely on the repetition of simple iconic images
or phrases to maintain their power (think of the way Stalin or
Mao flooded their respective societies with portraits of them
selves).
The frame is "eternal" because we see certain images played
over and over ad nauseum. How many times have we each seen
the tape of Kennedy's assassination? 10 times? 20? 50? Yet how
many of us were actually in Dallas that day? When an image is
repeated endlessly, it replaces real experience and memory.
Everyone has had the experience of a photograph replacing ac
tual memory: When we have not seen someone in a long time,
our memories of that person become increasingly dependent on
the physical visual records we possess of them.
The Ant Farm videos are prescient when you consider that
they were made in 1975, before the creation of cable television,
the twenty-four news station or the internet. Our daily lives are

so saturated with
images that we
cease to be con
scious of their pres
ence. "Media
Burn" and "The
Eternal Frame" are
efforts to restore

our awareness of images so that they might cease to be so pow
erful.
Art Farm's arguments are reinforced by the fact that the
videos are by far the most compelling part of the exhibit. The ar
chitectural plans and other various documents in the show do not
lend themselves to a dynamic museum exhibit: Visitors must be
patient as the majority of the show's contents require painstak
ing reading of small lettering and diagrams. Overall, "Ant Farm:
1968-1978" disappointed me. The exhibit other than the
videos and the inflatable would be more engaging in book
form than in a museum. The videos ironically or fittingly?
are the most alluring and enduring testaments to the Art Farm's
creative output.

The show includes blueprints,
architectural models, collages,
videos and sculptures.

Ant Farm pioneered
"inflatable" buildings as a form
of alternative architecture.
