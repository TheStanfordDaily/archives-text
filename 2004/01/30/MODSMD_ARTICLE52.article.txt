# Cheesecake Factory is like, a factory of cheese and cake. Yo.

Lunch used to be unforgivably late in high school.
We used to pine for food in the pre-lunch English period, my
best friend and I. She'd whisper sweet nothings in my ear
"Avocado eggrolls," "Shrimp Scampi!". Yes, we were dream
ers. It wasn't just food, the vocab always belonged to the
Cheesecake Factory's extensive manual, their spiral
bound and laminated portfolio of culinary excellence,
complete with ads of models in uncomfortable
poses and slick cars. You Cheesecake virgins,
you think I kid? More than 200 food items
and 50 desserts. And now, everyone can
get lucky, because the satisfaction is
just down the street on University
It towers like a ritzy hotel on the
left side, on University and Wa
verly.

The Cheesecake Factory

is a delightful interior designing anomaly the sophisticated
glass chandeliers of Italy hover next to details of childish
whimsy, yet there is no culture shock. Water is served in unas
suming beer mugs, atop pristine marble tables. The Bellagio
meets-Harry Potter style is actually an eclectic blend of
Egyptian and Mediterranean, according to the friendly man
ager, Jerry Buss. And if you have toured more than one Fac
tory, the secret to the individualized architecture yet similar
aura are the hand painted murals. One lady has accumulated
a lot of frequent flyer miles by traveling to all 74 locations to
design and paint on the walls.
Perhaps this is all to distract you from the hour wait
during rush hour. Sadly, this wait cannot be truncated by a
reservation. Their pleasure-delaying tactic makes you expo
nentially hungrier while you sit in the lobby, but resist the
temptation to over order in an attempt to compensate.
Here is the dilemma. Cheesecake Factory's gargantuan

entrees leave little room for much else. When they dangle

portions of this magnitude, the small-stom
ached do not have vacant positions for the
oread, and appetizers, and other prospec
tive cheesecake tenants. For the latter, six
dollars for a slice is not a light investment, but
we are not frivolously talking of a light treat. It
might be a better game plan to go solely for one of the
37 cheesecakes and enjoy it over a nice chat and a fancy
coffee drink. For those less lactose-inclined, experiment
with the airy tiramisu or the tropical smoothie. Don't feel
guilty, you are allowed to go to a restaurant whose appellation
clearly states its purpose in life, and then not go through with
the whole nine yards. But if you want to be an overachiever,
there is a way. Bring a date, and if you want more variety (
... in the food), bring five dates. It might be the Chinese in
me, but sharing is the way to go. There's so much of every
thing, put it in the middle, and make it a buffet. Pace yourself!
This is a marathon, not a so-fancy-we're-not-gonna-fill-you
up-because-that's-style meal. I will assuage your fears and re
assure you that all the presentations are comparable to the
latter in aesthetics, but three times larger. Thus, plan ahead
for the proper course of action. For example, will you sacrifice
an appetizer for a dessert?
As for us, we had a lovely threesome, a roommate outing.
For the romantics, the tall booths are quite private. Our flip
pant waiter was not too graceful in his duties, but this is not
the norm with this large staff. We were too busy looking at the
menu to take offense. Our procession of food included the
Boston House Salad, the Chicken Quesadilla, the Shrimp
with Angel Hair, and concluded with the Lemon and Rasp
berry Cream Cheesecake. A tip for the hungry, do not ask for
the food to arrive at once. One dish will inevitably sit there
alone in the back, obeying Newton's Law of Cooling, waiting
for the others to come out together. The Boston House Ap
petizer Salad ($6.95) is surprisingly light, despite its blue

cheese and ranch dressing tendencies. The crispy bacon and
pepper are sprinkled generously on butter lettuce that is a lit
tle too big. If you are in the mood for more excitement and
toppings, the entree salads averaging eleven dollars are a bet
ter choice. The Chicken Quesadilla appetizer ($9) is blessed
with an evenly crispy tortilla skin, and chocked full of moz
zarella and charred peppers. I cannot vouch for authenticity,
but it is great fun for the milder palette, save the guac, which
is deceptively spicy. For avocado lovers, I must put in a
shameless plug for the Avocado Eggrolls, served with a tangy
tamarind sauce. Then the fork in the road, pasta or meat? For
lighter seafood, I highly recommend the Shrimp with Angel
Hair ($16.50), lemon pepper grilled shrimp surrounding al
dente pasta in bruschetta, a dualist masterpiece. For spicier
pastas such as the Cajun Jambalaya, beware of excess salt,
which are good for certain moods. If you prefer the omnivore
lifestyle, Steak Diane ($18.95) sits beautifully in caramelized
onions and a mushroom wine sauce. We closed the night with
a creamy cheesecake, which we thought would be more fruity
and less creamy, but it was mitigated by the raspberry puree
sauce. These cheesecakes are a beautiful date dish, enough
for two since you'll be stuffed already, but still big enough to
guiltlessly take large bites.
Whatever your path, you cannot lose here. To me, this
castle in the clouds has always been fondly known as "Cheese
cake". No "Factory" is needed —it is understood, that
Cheesecake, is the representation of all foods, and not just
cheesecake. So cheesecake lovers and nonlovers both, please
go indulge at Cheesecake.
The Cheesecake Factory's newest location is at 375 Un
iversity Avenue, Palo Alto (the corner of University
and Waverly)
