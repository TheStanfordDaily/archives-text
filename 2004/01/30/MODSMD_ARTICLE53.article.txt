# Roxy: Straight guys and the men who love them
## 
### ROXYSASS SEX GODDESS 
Because most of my guy friends tend to be well dressed, clean and
rarely refer to girls as bitches, a lot of people assume they're gay. Not
that there's anything wrong with that. Hell, some of my best friends are
gay. And black. And Jewish. And handicapped. Yeah, me andTarik
Greenbergstein. Oh the fun we have! We go clubbing and drop X like
they're tic-tacs, and at the end of the night I watch as he follows some
guy home, glow-sticks shining like the future in the spokes of his wheel
chair. But you've got to admit, it must get a little annoying constantly
explaining your sexual preferences to complete strangers or wondering
what Lance your math buddy really meant by "platonic male sleep
over."
Being in Europe, I find that the whole gayness issue is especially
pertinent. My gaydar is completely out of whack on this side of the
ocean. I'm not one of those morons who immediately associate tight
pants with an inclination towards man-love, but it is true that guys here
are somewhat fancier than back in the states. It's disorienting, and I
sympathize with the plight of my tidy, tight-shirted guy friends. What's
a hetero boy to do when he finds himself subject to unwanted ad
vances?
First of all, be flattered. Getting hit on is getting hit on is getting hit
on. Someone thinks you're attractive and interesting enough to ap
proach, and regardless of the source you should thank your lucky stars
that there's still a chance you won't die cold and alone in a pool of your
own urine. That's more than most of us can say.
Try not to frequent gay bars or dance clubs. This may seem obvi
ous, but just the other day, one of the very friends who had been com
plaining about gay men hitting on him said to me, "Hey we should
check out this bar called YAG. It sounds really cool. I mean, that's
'GAY' spelled backwards, and but I don't think that means anything,

do you? Oh look, and it's navy theme night." I just had a secret
giggle party in my head and shrugged. Also, avoid clubs that use
phallic wordplay in their titles like "Rod" or "Stud" or "Hot Gay
Penis."
When you are propositioned, just decline politely. There's
no need to launch into your exhaustive sexual history, detailing
every girl you've ever fooled around with, complete with refer
ences, footnotes and diagrams. Nor is there a need to go berserk
and fly into a homophobic rage, Southern-Republican style. Let
me tell you here and now that occurrences of defensive asshole
behavior are inversely proportional to your chances of getting
with the ladies. Contrary to popular belief, insecurity and bigotry
are not turn-ons.
And then, there is always the possibility that these vibes

you're sending out have
nothing to do with sensitiv
ity of fashion-conscious
ness, and that you're just a
big flaming ball of gay.
Better to deal with it now
than later. Because Lord
knows there's nothing sad
der than a 65 year old gay
man-in-denial who polish
es his shotgun every day,
refuses to do his wife any
way but doggy style, and
wears yellowed wife-beat
ers that cling to his saggy
man-breasts.


Doesn't that ad make you want a meatball sub? Yeah
