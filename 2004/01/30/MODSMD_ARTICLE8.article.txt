## Life hands out lemons; celeb athletes and Stanford doctors Make LemonAide 
### CHARLES FENG STAFF WRITER 
The swing, made famous in countless highlight reels, is compact and
lightening-quick. And the ball, as usual, sails through the air, racing away
until, in a blink of the eye, it is lost in an endless expanse of sky. But Barry
Bonds, the San Francisco Giants slugger, is not belting sliders into Mc-
Covey Cove, making pitchers red-faced. No, today this cloudy Mon
day, Jan. 26—Bonds, wielding a five iron instead of a bat, and hampered
by a wind blowing in from the west, is attempting par in a new domain: the
Stanford Golf Course.
With a hand-painted sign revealing its entrance at the corner of Ju
nipero Serra and Campus Drive, the Stanford Golf Course is hidden from
the hubbub of university life behind a thicket of evergreens. It is a land
scape of manicured lawns and sand oases stretching all the way back to the
foothills. Here, on this sunny morning, Bonds and a multitude of gigantic
men—former and present standouts in the sports world team up for a
round of golf with patients, donors, and physicians, all commingled in
groups of five. The champions are here to fulfill the wishes of patients
treated at Stanford Hospital and Clinics as part of the nonprofit Lemon-
Aide. The volunteer group is directed by fellows of the Bone Marrow
Transplant, Hematology, and Oncology departments at Stanford Univer
sity."
The day begins with a little trouble in the parking lot, wherethe fleet of
golf carts plays bumper cars in the rush to depart for the green. But even
tually, Jim Plunkett, Heisman-winning ex-Stanford quarterback, finds his
way onto the course for a round of scramble, beginning with a shotgun
start. This means, basically, that rules will be relaxed, if not ignored alto
gether, for the day. Way out on the eleventh, Plunkett takes a couple of
whacks in the grass before swinging, and, pleased with his crisp strike,
gazes upward as the ball whistles through the air.
"Don't hit us!" yells a baseball player out front. Fortunately, for this
particular hole at least, he need not worry: the first ball off the tee sails left,
the second careens to the right, and the third and forth fall well short of
their designated target. Indeed, today many players will be humbled by
the golf ball and a pocket, sometimes 300 yards away, smaller than their
clenched fists.
Some weekend hackers, not too concerned with the veracity of their
scores, purchase do-overs "mulligans," in golfing parlance. Others,
however, are more serious about the game, whispering sweet nothings —
"C'mon, baby! C'mon, baby!" is a common refrain —or, as the case may
be, cursing up a storm as the golf ball makes an errant trajectory towards
the ground. Should the ball land cleanly on the fairway, a brief pelvic swiv
el signals contentment.
This is the kind of event Bobby Bonds, Barry's father and a Giants
great in his own right would have enjoyed were he around to see it.
After a protracted battle with cancer, Bonds passed away last August. The
charity event, organized in memory of the elder Bonds by the nonprofit
Lemon Aide, not only celebrates his love of golf, but will provide assis
tance to financially-strapped patients, providing them with a classy dinner,
or maybe airfare to fly relatives in during a round of chemotherapy.
Around noon, Plunkett's group is greeted by Herb Chi, a venture cap
italist masquerading for the day as eighteenth-hole caretaker. The game
moves at a fast clip; golfing jitters are alleviated by the jovial conversation,
Plunkett and company hit cleanly towards the hole. In between meet-and
greets, Chi, in mirrored wraparound shades, surveys the faint silhouette of
the San Francisco skyline, shrouded in a haze of fog.
Most golfers, however, are focused on the task at hand. A retired gen
tleman takes a tinkle in some nearby shrubbery (there are no port-a-pot
ties in sight; perhaps these have been banned as eyesores). He swings for
the heavens, but the ball barely grazes the horizon. Muttering something
to himself, he re-mounts his golf cart.
Finally, as the late-afternoon chill sets in, the day ends on an optimistic
note. Back at the swanky clubhouse (even the men's bathroom is carpet
ed), Teyo Johnson has the television blaring at full volume as he watches
an ESPN profile of Raiders teammate Charles Woodson.
Off in the corner, Bonds peruses the sports memorabilia offered at the
charity auction.
"I want Ronnie Lott's picture," he tells a student standing nearby.
"Yeah, it's a good picture," the student replies, evidently unnerved by
words from Sunday's National League MVP winner.
Bonds, not surprisingly, is the center of attention. Some fans content
themselves with casting furtive glances his way; braver souls approach him
for a handshake. Johnson, bored with TV, ambles over to chat.
A little later, as the prizes are distributed, Bonds is pleasantly surprised
to score a bottle of wine.
"But I don't drink!" he laughs, as he hands the bottle to his publicist.
Bonds is all smiles. And somewhere up there, just maybe, Bobby Bonds is
smiling right along.

Tee and sympathy: Barry Bonds was among the pro athletes who teamed up with nonprofit Lemon Aide for an afternoon of puttering along the green
with patients from Stanford Hospital and clinics. Some patients were all agog at the star-studded crowd; others ironed out their jitters on the course.
