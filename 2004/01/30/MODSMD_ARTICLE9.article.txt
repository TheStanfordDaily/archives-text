# Blowing up the bubble: Students say it takes gumption
## 
### JASMINE HANEFI 
"He told me, 'This is the only worthwhile thing I do on campus'!"
Six girls balancing dinner plates on their knees in La Maison Francaise
are crowing about the latest accolades from one of the patrons of their
public service group. I'm here to chat with the team that powers "Bursting
the Bubble," which aims to expose the larger world's issues to students
back on the Farm. Since September 2002, when they founded the group,
current juniors Chloe Rothstein, Jenny Tolan, Maris Jones and Nina Hsu
have met every Tuesday to organize panels focused on topics of current
national or international importance.
After managing to secure a fork for me—utensils seem to be a precious
commodity at a crowded Tuesday night dinner —Tolan describes the ori
gins of "Bursting the Bubble." "So we were listening to a panel on Sept.
11 during Sophomore College," she says exuberantly, waving her hands
in the air. "It was a very lively, heated, enlightened panel... and we were
all thinking, 'We've only been back at Stanford for two weeks and already
we have no idea what's happening in the world.' "
Determined that eye-opening experiences such as the panel should not
be few and far between, the girls formed the group in order to try to du
plicate their Sophomore College experience for the benefit of Stanford
faculty, students and maintenance workers alike.
"We're all so busy that we don't often have the chance to tap a fraction
of the resources here," Jones says. "During our panels, anyone from the
area can come to ask questions about topics they know close to nothing
about. This is an interactive activity." Approximately 200 people attend
each panel, which address topics ranging from human rights violations in
foreign countries to gay marriage legislation in America.

As for selecting the group's name, which refers to the Stanfordites' ac
customed insularity: "It was a collective effort," Rothstein says.
"So many titles on campus are abbreviated, and we thought a non
acronym name would encompass the whole idea of this group," Tolan adds.
"More than anything else, this is meant to be a fun and accessible activity."
The girls frequently burst out laughing; they finish each others' sen
tences in passing from one topic of interest to the next. Munching on rolls,
they take care of business: Who will flyer the dorms? What issues should
be addressed at the next panel? Which speakers can the team "catch" for
future events? "Usually we get professors and Hoover Fellows," remarks
sophomore Julie Lein. "The upcoming debate is extra-special, though...
we are considering religious and secular, as well as political and legal as
pects." One speaker is flying in from Washington D.C. to address the Stan
ford community on gay marriage for the next panel on Feb. 3. Another
speaker who will be present at that panel serves as a representative in the
California State Assembly.
Last quarter, several of the juniors studied abroad, leading to the recent
lull in group-sponsored events. "We really want to increase our on-campus
recognition at this point," Jones explains. "We want people to know we're
back."
"We make sure that speakers provide a lot of basic information on their
topics," Hsu says. "You should feel free to come, whatever your back
ground. It's an informal thing. After the panel, people will mingle. That's
what we strive for... diversity of opinion and background."
The girls' main goal is "to spark discussion among students," says
sophomore Shilpa Gulati, who became a Bursting the Bubble organizer at
the end of the last school year. A big supporter of on-campus news read
ership programs, she attended all last year's panels. Gulati admires her fel

low group members' sawy. "I was amazed... two panelists had authored
essays that I had analyzed in my PWR class," she says.
Advertising Bursting the Bubble on campus and leaving a lasting lega
cy on the Farm is the biggest challenge for Gulati and her five teammates.
"We flyer everywhere," sighs Hsu. But it's hard work getting a higher pro
file when many other flyers jostling for space; and many students are too
busy to peruse the crowded bulletin board, let alone make room in their
busy schedules to attend events.
"We're trying to transform this into something we hope will be instilled
in the Stanford culture. But how do you make something that lasts here?"
muses Tolan.
"An RA from a freshman dorm told us we've conquered the biggest
problem for freshmen on campus!" Rothstein reminds her. The group is
proud of its growing renown as a political forum on a campus where some
students can be reticent about controversial issues.
The girls' mirth fills the small room —maybe "conquered" is too strong
a word. "All right, so we've chiseled at the biggest problem," amends
Rothstein.
"Chiseled, that's good," Tolan agrees.
As the meeting winds down, the members make sure to emphasize the
importance of the upcoming panel. Free and open to the public, this
panel —a discussion about gay marriage will take place Feb. 3at 7:30 p.m.
in the Tressider Oak Room. Mindful of how even the busiest students will
take a study break at the magic words "free food," Tolan and Hsu reiter
ate that good refreshments will be served. For raucous freshmen, reclusive
grad students, and everyone in between —especially the boy down my hall
who couldn't identify the speaker at the recent State of the Union ad
dress —let the bubble-bursting begin!

have met every Tuesday to organize panels focused on topics of current
national or international importance.
After managing to secure a fork for me—utensils seem to be a precious
commodity at a crowded Tuesday night dinner —Tolan describes the ori
gins of "Bursting the Bubble." "So we were listening to a panel on Sept.
11 during Sophomore College," she says exuberantly, waving her hands
in the air. "It was a very lively, heated, enlightened panel... and we were
all thinking, 'We've only been back at Stanford for two weeks and already
we have no idea what's happening in the world.' "
Determined that eye-opening experiences such as the panel should not
be few and far between, the girls formed the group in order to try to du
plicate their Sophomore College experience for the benefit of Stanford
faculty, students and maintenance workers alike.
"We're all so busy that we don't often have the chance to tap a fraction
of the resources here," Jones says. "During our panels, anyone from the
area can come to ask questions about topics they know close to nothing
about. This is an interactive activity." Approximately 200 people attend
each panel, which address topics ranging from human rights violations in
foreign countries to gay marriage legislation in America.

As for selecting the group's name, which refers to the Stanfordites' ac
customed insularity: "It was a collective effort," Rothstein says.
"So many titles on campus are abbreviated, and we thought a non
acronym name would encompass the whole idea of this group," Tolan adds.
"More than anything else, this is meant to be a fun and accessible activity."
The girls frequently burst out laughing; they finish each others' sen
tences in passing from one topic of interest to the next. Munching on rolls,
they take care of business: Who will flyer the dorms? What issues should
be addressed at the next panel? Which speakers can the team "catch" for
future events? "Usually we get professors and Hoover Fellows," remarks
sophomore Julie Lein. "The upcoming debate is extra-special, though...
we are considering religious and secular, as well as political and legal as
pects." One speaker is flying in from Washington D.C. to address the Stan
ford community on gay marriage for the next panel on Feb. 3. Another
speaker who will be present at that panel serves as a representative in the
California State Assembly.
Last quarter, several of the juniors studied abroad, leading to the recent
lull in group-sponsored events. "We really want to increase our on-campus
recognition at this point," Jones explains. "We want people to know we're
back."
"We make sure that speakers provide a lot of basic information on their
topics," Hsu says. "You should feel free to come, whatever your back
ground. It's an informal thing. After the panel, people will mingle. That's
what we strive for... diversity of opinion and background."
The girls' main goal is "to spark discussion among students," says
sophomore Shilpa Gulati, who became a Bursting the Bubble organizer at
the end of the last school year. A big supporter of on-campus news read
ership programs, she attended all last year's panels. Gulati admires her fel

low group members' sawy. "I was amazed... two panelists had authored
essays that I had analyzed in my PWR class," she says.
Advertising Bursting the Bubble on campus and leaving a lasting lega
cy on the Farm is the biggest challenge for Gulati and her five teammates.
"We flyer everywhere," sighs Hsu. But it's hard work getting a higher pro
file when many other flyers jostling for space; and many students are too
busy to peruse the crowded bulletin board, let alone make room in their
busy schedules to attend events.
"We're trying to transform this into something we hope will be instilled
in the Stanford culture. But how do you make something that lasts here?"
muses Tolan.
"An RA from a freshman dorm told us we've conquered the biggest
problem for freshmen on campus!" Rothstein reminds her. The group is
proud of its growing renown as a political forum on a campus where some
students can be reticent about controversial issues.
The girls' mirth fills the small room —maybe "conquered" is too strong
a word. "All right, so we've chiseled at the biggest problem," amends
Rothstein.
"Chiseled, that's good," Tolan agrees.
As the meeting winds down, the members make sure to emphasize the
importance of the upcoming panel. Free and open to the public, this
panel —a discussion about gay marriage will take place Feb. 3at 7:30 p.m.
in the Tressider Oak Room. Mindful of how even the busiest students will
take a study break at the magic words "free food," Tolan and Hsu reiter
ate that good refreshments will be served. For raucous freshmen, reclusive
grad students, and everyone in between —especially the boy down my hall
who couldn't identify the speaker at the recent State of the Union ad
dress —let the bubble-bursting begin!
"He told me, 'This is the only worthwhile thing I do on campus'!"
Six girls balancing dinner plates on their knees in La Maison Francaise
are crowing about the latest accolades from one of the patrons of their
public service group. I'm here to chat with the team that powers "Bursting
the Bubble," which aims to expose the larger world's issues to students
back on the Farm. Since September 2002, when they founded the group,
current juniors Chloe Rothstein, Jenny Tolan, Maris Jones and Nina Hsu
have met every Tuesday to organize panels focused on topics of current
