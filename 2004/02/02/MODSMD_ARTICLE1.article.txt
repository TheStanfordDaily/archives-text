# Conference draws minority premeds
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE 
There still aren't enough minori
ties in medicine, said Dr. Alfonso
Barba, a keynote speaker at Satur
day's day-long 13th Annual Pr,e-
Medical Student Conference.
More than 500 high school, un
dergraduate and medical students
from all across California attended
the event, which was sponsored by
the Stanford University Minority
Medical Alliance and is the largest
conference of its kind on the West
Coast.
Eddie Lares, a second-year Stan
ford medical student and one of the
coordinators of the conference, said
he saw it as one step toward helping
minorities gain access to medical
school.
According to Lares, the number
of minorities in medical-related
professions has increased over the
past 10 years, but he added that
those numbers are still very low
and nowhere near where they
should be.

"We still have a long way to go,"
he said. "That's a main reason why
we have this conference — to en
courage students and give them the
tools to get into medical school. The
numbers have been getting better,
but they are still very low, especial
ly in academia where only about 2
percent of the faculty in medical
schools are minorities."
Dr. Gabriel Garcia, dean of ad
missions at Stanford School of
Medicine, spoke on the conference
theme, "Rising to the Challenge."
In his keynote speech, Garcia cited
the famous saying of Gandhi, "You
must be the change you wish to see
in the world," to illustrate the im
portance of serving humanity in the
role of physicians.
"A physician's job is to serve the
people," he said. "But it's how we
carry out this role and the passion
with which we treat our patients
that shows the type of physician we
truly are."
Becoming a physician was not an easy process for
many of the speakers. During the "FACES" presen
tation. current medical school students described ex
periences ranging from struggles with racism based
on skin color and ethnicity to social and economic
hardships.
Barba rounded out the last of the morning s speakers
and gave numerous tips on how to succeed in the pre
med program.
"Everyone here wants to be a doctor," he said.
"And I don't want any of you to leave this conference
without knowing thai you have what it takes to suc
ceed in medicine."
After the opening speeches, conference participants
spent the day attending was spent in various workshops
that addressed topics ranging from medical school ad
missions to MCAT preparation. There was also a break
for lunch during which students could chat with current

medical students and attend a recruitment fair, with
representatives from medical schools around the coun
try were present.
Various students from across the state attended the
conference. College of San Mateo student Amy Lilies
found out about the program through her college's pre
medical society.
"1 heard a lot of positive things about this confer
ence," she said. "I felt that it would give me valuable in
formation in preparing for the medical school admis
sions process, especially interviews."
Stanford freshman Elena Wright also gained from
the conference.
"The best part of the experience for me was having
lunch with a group of Stanford medical students," she
said. "It was gratifying to hear from people who have
been through the same experiences as I have and are
on the other side. 1 learned that I should explore dif
ferent passions and see what works out, instead of
doing things just because you think med schools want
you to do them."
The conference is SUMMA's most important event
during the year. The group consists of three main mi
nority groups: Stanford American Indigenous Medical
Students, Student National Medical Student Associa
tion (which represents African-American medical stu
dents) and the Latino Medical Student Association.
