# The
						triumphant return of 10 random questions
## 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Meet Brendan Marten, editor in chief of Volume
225 of The Stanford Daily. So now that Marten's a true
celebrity on campus, he deserves a little recognition.
1) Both you and Dean of Admission and Financial
Aid Robin Mamlet arc from Santa Barbara. 1 smell
nepotism.
Well [chuckles], I feel that's not related to my ad
mission to Stanford seeing as I believe it was the
money I offered that resulted in that [admission].

2) How do your Stanford party experiences stack up to
your wild nights in Isla Vista |the wild Santa Barbara

party neighborhood!?
There's not a risk of falling off cliffs here, so I'd say it's a bit safer.
3) Do you have any plans to piss off thousands of Palestinian-Americans
like your predecessor? If so, what are they?
I don't discriminate and I'm not one to choose groups. I'd prefer to piss
off everyone. That way, it's pretty inclusive.

4) What's your nickname?
B-mart.
5) I heard there's another one.
I don't know what you're talking about. [Pauses.] If you must know, Vol
ume 223 Managing Editor of News Jennifer Graham was kind enough to
coin two nicknames for me, one being "B-mart" and the other being
"humper." Only my close associates and random people who don't know me
walking by on the street refer to me as "humper." If you want to add extra
emphasis, you can call me "the humper." Personally, I take the nickname as
a compliment. It comes from the film "All the President's Men," which is
about famous journalists Woodward and Bernstein, in which the eager
young reporters were described as "humpers" by by their boss for their ded
icated work ethic.
6) An article of yours called "Santa Clara Opposes PATRIOT Act" has
been linked to by a Web site called Pakistan Link.com. Are you, or have
you ever been, a member of Lashkar-e-Toiba, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen or
another Palestinian terror organization?
If by "member" you mean paying dues, I'd say no.
7) You're a political science major. That pretty much means that this will
be your last full-time job fora quite a while, doesn't it?

It'll probably take me another 10 years to make the money 1 get for doing this.
8) What classes are you taking this quarter?
I don't really have classes this quarter because I think of classes as things
that I attend. And after all, if I'm not in attendance, what sort of learning ex
perience is that. Then again, computer science majors might argue it is a lot,
since they watch their lectures on the Web. But that really isn't the case for
political science, and if it was... well, maybe I'd be then.
9) Which reality television show do you think describes you as a person
best?
I don't know reality TV. I guess "The Real World," because I'm pretty real.
10) What grade would you give to The Stanford Daily for Volume 224?
I'd have to say that it'd be a "pass" because The Stanford Daily would
only sign up fora class if it were pass / fail.
Bonus Question: What's your favorite dead baby joke?
That's a difficult question. And let me assure you. there is no easy an
swer. Of course, I could just tell you all the dead baby jokes I know. But
then again, what would that accomplish? After all. it'd be a colossal waste
of our time. Which is an ironic thing to say on the Features page, I know.
