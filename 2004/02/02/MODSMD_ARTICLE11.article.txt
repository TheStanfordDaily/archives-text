## The
						Stanford Daily Editor's Note Welcome to The Daily's future 
### 
Once again, The Stanford
Daily is starting a new vol
ume of production (Vol
ume 225, to be specific).
I've spent five voiumes working for
the paper. During that time, I've seen
many examples of what works and
what does not work in this organiza
tion. I've developed a vision of what I
want The Daily to become. And now,
during my sixth volume of involve
ment here, I will have the opportuni
ty to implement it.
Every incoming editor in chief
(predictably) declares his or her in
tent to make The Daily a better paper
(and I, of course, am no different in
this regard). But that promise in and
of itself doesn't mean much if there is
fundamental disagreement over
what a newspaper should accom
plish. What is the proper role of The
Daily on campus? What is its pur
pose? And how can it accomplish
that on a consistent basis?
In my view, a newspaper serves as a
resource for the community. My be
lief is that you — the reader —
should think of The Daily as an insti
tution that meets your needs and
keeps you informed; as a paper that
covers issues relevant to your every
day life. In the News section, we in
form you about events and develop
ments, providing fair and objective
reporting that takes every side of
each situation into account. In Opin
ions, our editorial board registers its
views on campus issues and concerns,
providing an informed voice that
takes a constructive approach toward
making this community a better and
more functional place for everyone.
Also, our Opinions columnists and
guest columnists provide their partic
ular perspectives on campus life. In
Sports, we provide in-depth coverage
of Stanford athletics through pre
views, game coverage and player pro
files. And in Special Sections —
which includes Features, Health, In
novation and Intermission —we
provide fun and entertaining ac
counts of contemporary student life
and culture.
These are the more obvious goals

Brendan Marten
Editor in Chief, Volume 225

Brendan Marten is a junior majoring in political science.
He has served as an editor for News, Opinions and World & Nation

of each individual department at The
Daily. But how can we specifically
improve our coverage to better meet
your needs as a reader? One key in
gredient in bringing about a more re
sponsive newspaper is proactive ef
forts on the part of its staff. We're re
designing our News beat system so
that reporters more actively will pur
sue potential stories on campus,
rather than waiting for them to come
to their attention through more pas
sive channels. We're creating a new
Investigative team that will specialize
in covering long-term stories and is
sues on campus, meaning that our
coverage will be stronger and that
you will be better informed. Addi
tionally, we're stepping up our efforts
to ensure that we cover issues relat
ing to all segments of the campus
population: from newly arrived un
dergraduate freshmen to graduating
seniors; from graduate students to
the faculty members with whom they
research and work; from those who
study at Stanford to those employed
by the University
Another way of improving our
paper is ensuring that we maintain an
open line of communication with
those outside The Daily. We always
welcome letters to the editor and
guest columns from those with some
thing to say to fellow community
members. Get involved — make sure
your voice heard. And while we're on
the topic of communication, if you
ever have any concerns, questions or
comments about The Daily, feel free
to contact me. You can give me a call
at (650) 725-2100 ext. 501 or e-mail
me at eic@daily.stanford.edu. I want
to hear how we're doing, and I hope
you'll take the time to let me know.
Welcome to Volume 225 of The
Daily.
