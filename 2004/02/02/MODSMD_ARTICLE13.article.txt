# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Ballet dancer wins film award 
### 
While 1 usually love
to get my ideas for
columns from my
own twisted mind,
a friend of mine offered me a
possible column idea the other
day. Seeing the humorous possi
bilities in her suggestion, 1 took
the case. She directed me to this
story by Megan Lehmann of the
New York Post about a guy who
ate only McDonald's for 30 days
straight, and then made a film
about it. His girlfriend, a vegan,
made sure those were the
chastest days of his life, which
I'm not entirely surprised by.
According to the story, he put on
something like 60 pounds, and
due to the stress, his knees were
giving out quicker than Anna
Nicole. Poor guy.
The filmmaker / fatty Mc-
Stupidhead is named Morgan
Spurlock, and his film is called
"Super Size Me." Actually, 1
think calling him stupid might
not be appropriate because he
was doing this entire stunt to ed
ucate people. No, he's not a
moron. He was using himself as
an experiment to see what
would really happen to his body
if he ate nothing but McDon
ald's for 30 days. As anyone
like, for instance. Dr. Jekyll
will tell you, experimenting on
yourself is a terrific idea.
Although anybody who has
ever had a Big Mac could tell you
what would happen, that proba
bly wouldn't last a full hour on

film. So rather than getting an en
tire video of people saying, "Junk
food is bad for you, duh," he in-

stead filmed his
progress over
the course of 30
days. While 1
haven't seen the
film, I'm betting
the results are
more disturbing
than the charges
brought against
Jacko.

So, I bet that
you're asking what kind of man, if
not a complete idiot, would do
this to himself for the sake of ed
ucation? Yep, you guessed it. A
ballet dancer. According to the
New York Post and www.super
sizeme.com, Morgan was one of
three ballet-dancing brothers.
The other two did not do any
thing noteworthy or stupid
enough to warrant media atten
tion, which is surprising because,
as the only three ballet-dancing
brothers from West Virginia (yes,
THAT West Virginia) I've ever
heard of, you'd think they would
have had plenty of madcap ad
ventures. (TV executives: if you
are reading this, do I have a sit
com idea for you!)
The documentary actually
sounds pretty appetizing. I'm bet
ting it's gut wrenching (haha!)
and pretty hard to swallow. It won
the best documentary award at
the Sundance Film Festival, mak
ing it the cream of its crop. (Isn't

food humor fun?) The filmmaker
seems to be achieving his goal of
informing the public, as one can
be rest assured that the award is a
great way for Spurlock to get his
name out.
Thus, we are left thinking: 1)
Is McDonald's bad for you? 2)
Who is left in this world to in
form of this fact? 3) Does Mc-
Donald's know its food is un
healthy? 4) How can McDon
ald's better inform those uni
formed dozen people in South
Arkansas about this? 5) And
with the knowledge that the
food is unhealthy, will this
change people's diets?
These answers will only re
veal themselves in time. Hmm,
OK, long enough. Here they are,
check how you did. The answers:
1) Yes. 2) A dozen people in
South Arkansas. 3) Yes. 4) Per
haps with a huge Surgeon Gen
eral's warning that says "Don't
eat this, you twit!" 5) As much as
they'll stop smoking.
Well 1 bet you want me to end
this thing with a nice food joke,
like, "That's sure some food for
thought." But 1 won't, because
that would be cheesy with a side
order of corny.

ever, were all Dave Barry's. E
