## Church-state separation faces debate 
### ROBERT GREER COHN 
There have been violent reli
gious conflicts in America from
the beginning, such as the mur
derous Catholic-Protestant ten
sion in the Jamestown colony
and the comparable riots in New
York City during the Civil War.
But, on the whole, as compared
to Europe, we have been pretty
ecumenical and reasonable in
this regard, as during the Great
Awakening that preceded and
inspired our Revolution and the
broad Jewish-Christian recon
ciliation movement following
the Holocaust.
The big tension now is be
tween mainly-conservative reli
giosity and liberal secularism, as
in France during its revolution
and after, until our day. This goes
far to explain the fierce hatred of
President George W. Bush. But
because the media, like alma
mater academia, are over
whelmingly liberal, the rift is not
well understood or reported.
Although we separated church

and state from the constitutional
beginning, the cultural-intuitive
nation (as opposed to the ratio
nalistic-civic state) always had a
major voice in the country's af
fairs, importantly in the Declara
tion of Independence, but in all
sorts of other ways. The deep
originary paradox between head
and heart (yin and yang, etc.) —
despite the philosophically arbi
trary and one-sided crusty sepa
ration (practical in keeping the
state from interfering with varied
beliefs) — never kept us from a
wise muddling through between
the horns of the dilemma. Every
body, including our political lead
ers, just knows we ought to and
will keep our national slogan "In
God We Trust. ,, Only a few hu
morless and legalistic cranks like
Michael Newdow and Barry
Lynn — and some judges —
demur.
Likewise, we see the French
in a pickle, hung-up on their cul
turally-degrading laicite and a
dumb proposed law against
headscarves in school. In acoun

try that was once the main pillar
of Catholicism, few seem to real
ize that the only authentic way
to counter a spiritual takeover is
with a native spiritual force tem
pered by moderating reason as
in the tradition of Aquinas.
Likewise in the Muslim
world, it is as natural and rea
sonable for Afghanistan and
Iraq to think of themselves as
(hopefully moderate) Islamic
republics as it is, de facto, for
Western countries to admit they
are prevailingly Christian or
Judeo-Christian. Samuel Hunt
ington goes along with this real
istic and sensible view.
RecepTayyip Erdogan, prime
minister of Turkey, denies that
his republic is Islamic. That is
clearly window-dressing, refuted
by Huntington. The popular will
undoubtedly is on the side of
scarves. But Ataturk and his big
army imposed a strict separation
that holds so far. Hmm.
