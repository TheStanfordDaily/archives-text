## Entertainer set example for U.S. presidents by owning up to mistakes 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Jack Paar died last Tuesday. He was
85-years old. Few people under 45 will
know who Paar was, and few Ameri
cans 50 or over can forget him. From
1957 to 1965, Paar hosted two widely
viewed television programs — "The
Tonight Show" and"The Jack Paar
Show." Paar's talk show style laid the
foundation for subsequent late night
hosts such as Johnny Carson, David
Letterman and Jay Leno. As a number
of newspapers reported in Paar's obitu
aries Wednesday, he was famous for his
mercurial temper and his emotional
outbreaks. But Paar could also mend
fences when he decided that that was
what needed to be done.
Three weeks after quitting his 1960
show in a huff over NBC's decision to
censor a quip he made, Paar was back on
that show declaring, in his self-effacing
style, "As 1 was saying before I was in
terrupted ..." Paar once dismissed a
popular television associate of his, Dody
Goodman, and later settled his differ
ences with her publicly on television.
Paar feuded with another well
known television personality, Ed Sulli
van. At the time of their feud in 1964,

the two men were among a handful of
the most famous personalities in Amer
ica. Neither man's celebrity, however,
approached that of the Beatles phe
nomenon of that era. Few people re
member that Paar scooped Sullivan in
getting the Beatles on his show first. It
is the Beatles' appearance on the Ed
Sullivan show, however, that most peo
ple remember. What I remember is
Paar announcing on his show that he
had called Sullivan to bury the hatchet.
Paar took that action because his
daughter, Randy, had asked her father
to get her tickets to attend Sullivan's
show for the Beatles appearance.
It must have been difficult for Paar to
initiate that act of contrition. Among
the hardest things any of us have to do is
admit we are wrong and humbly ap
proach someone else and say we are
sorry. It must be particularly difficult
when someone is in a leadership posi
tion, such as the president of the United
States. It is difficult, but necessary. The
same year Paar approached Sullivan to
mend fences, President Lyndon Johnson
lied to the American people. Johnson
announced that North Vietnamese tor
pedo boats had attacked a U.S. destroy
er in the Tonkin Gulf and ordered U.S.

bombers to retaliate. A few days later he
asked fora congressional resolution to
support our actions against North Viet
nam, and effectively launched us into
the Vietnam War. No such attack had
occurred. In a 1994 book, "The War
Within: America's Battle Over Viet
nam," author Tom Wells writes that the
air strikes "reflected plans the adminis
tration had already drawn up for gradu
ally increasing its overt military pres
sure against the North." Johnson com
pounded his early lie by consistently
misleading the American people (and
perhaps engaging in a large measure of
self-deception) about American suc
cesses in Vietnam. Johnson's decision
not to run for re-election in 1968 was a
result of the Vietnam War disaster.
From 1972 to 1974, President Richard
Nixon was embroiled in the Watergate
scandal, a bungled attempt by his Com
mittee to Re-elect the President to bug
the Democratic headquarters at the Wa
tergate Hotel during the election cam
paign. Subsequently, Nixon and mem
bers of his administration attempted to
cover up those events. The president
maintained that he first learned of the
events through the news and that he
made no attempt to cover up anything.

Audiotapes of the president and his staff
were later made public and revealed that
not only did the president know about
the cover-up, he directed it. Nixon re
signed from office rather than face the
specter of impeachment.
More recently, of course, we have the
example of President Bill Clinton, who
committed perjury regarding his sexual
relations with a White House intern and
was impeached. President George W.
Bush faces an ethical dilemma of his
own. He told the American people that
his intelligence sources revealed that
Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of
mass destruction, our primary justifica
tion for going to war in Iraq. On Oct. 7,
2002, during a speech in Cincinnati the
president said, "If we know Saddam
Hussein has dangerous weapons today
— and we do ..." In his 2003 State of
the Union speech Bush declared, "Year
after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to
elaborate lengths, spent enormous
sums, taken great risks, to build and
keep weapons of mass destruction." As
proof, Bush cited a British intelligence
report based on faulty intelligence that
Hussein had attempted to purchase
high strength aluminum tubes suitable
for nuclear weapons production. Bush

has pulled back from his earlier pro
nouncements in recent days. During his
State of the Union speech, he referred
to "weapons of mass destruction-relat
ed program activities" that had been
found, whatever that means. ITie presi
dent refused to repeat his assurances
that such weapons of mass destruction
would be found.
Now the question is whether the
president can admit that he made a mis
take in relying on faulty intelligence
and thereby misled Congress and the
American people. He is not ready to
take that step, however, and he contin
ue to reiterate his belief that the inva
sion of Iraq was justified based upon
the prior intelligence he had. Several
commentators have already suggested
that much as the Johnson administra
tion had already developed plans to ex
pand the war in Vietnam, the current
administration had similar plans to in
vade Iraq, going back to shortly after
the 2000 election. If that is the case, the
president should ask himself: "What
would Jack Paar do?"

occurred. In a 1994 book, "The War
Within: America's Battle Over Viet
nam," author Tom Wells writes that the
air strikes "reflected plans the adminis
tration had already drawn up for gradu
ally increasing its overt military pres
sure against the North." Johnson com
pounded his early lie by consistently
misleading the American people (and
perhaps engaging in a large measure of
self-deception) about American suc
cesses in Vietnam. Johnson's decision
not to run for re-election in 1968 was a
result of the Vietnam War disaster.
From 1972 to 1974, President Richard
Nixon was embroiled in the Watergate
scandal, a bungled attempt by his Com
mittee to Re-elect the President to bug
the Democratic headquarters at the Wa
tergate Hotel during the election cam
paign. Subsequently, Nixon and mem
bers of his administration attempted to
cover up those events. The president
maintained that he first learned of the
events through the news and that he
made no attempt to cover up anything.

Audiotapes of the president and his staff
were later made public and revealed that
not only did the president know about
the cover-up, he directed it. Nixon re
signed from office rather than face the
specter of impeachment.
More recently, of course, we have the
example of President Bill Clinton, who
committed perjury regarding his sexual
relations with a White House intern and
was impeached. President George W.
Bush faces an ethical dilemma of his
own. He told the American people that
his intelligence sources revealed that
Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of
mass destruction, our primary justifica
tion for going to war in Iraq. On Oct. 7,
2002, during a speech in Cincinnati the
president said, "If we know Saddam
Hussein has dangerous weapons today
— and we do ..." In his 2003 State of
the Union speech Bush declared, "Year
after year, Saddam Hussein has gone to
elaborate lengths, spent enormous
sums, taken great risks, to build and
keep weapons of mass destruction." As
proof, Bush cited a British intelligence
report based on faulty intelligence that
Hussein had attempted to purchase
high strength aluminum tubes suitable
for nuclear weapons production. Bush

has pulled back from his earlier pro
nouncements in recent days. During his
State of the Union speech, he referred
to "weapons of mass destruction-relat
ed program activities" that had been
found, whatever that means. ITie presi
dent refused to repeat his assurances
that such weapons of mass destruction
would be found.
Now the question is whether the
president can admit that he made a mis
take in relying on faulty intelligence
and thereby misled Congress and the
American people. He is not ready to
take that step, however, and he contin
ue to reiterate his belief that the inva
sion of Iraq was justified based upon
the prior intelligence he had. Several
commentators have already suggested
that much as the Johnson administra
tion had already developed plans to ex
pand the war in Vietnam, the current
administration had similar plans to in
vade Iraq, going back to shortly after
the 2000 election. If that is the case, the
president should ask himself: "What
would Jack Paar do?"

Francisco.
Jack Paar died last Tuesday. He was
85-years old. Few people under 45 will
know who Paar was, and few Ameri
cans 50 or over can forget him. From
1957 to 1965, Paar hosted two widely
viewed television programs — "The
Tonight Show" and"The Jack Paar
Show." Paar's talk show style laid the
foundation for subsequent late night
hosts such as Johnny Carson, David
Letterman and Jay Leno. As a number
of newspapers reported in Paar's obitu
aries Wednesday, he was famous for his
mercurial temper and his emotional
outbreaks. But Paar could also mend
fences when he decided that that was
what needed to be done.
Three weeks after quitting his 1960
show in a huff over NBC's decision to
censor a quip he made, Paar was back on
that show declaring, in his self-effacing
style, "As 1 was saying before I was in
terrupted ..." Paar once dismissed a
popular television associate of his, Dody
Goodman, and later settled his differ
ences with her publicly on television.
Paar feuded with another well
known television personality, Ed Sulli
van. At the time of their feud in 1964,

the two men were among a handful of
the most famous personalities in Amer
ica. Neither man's celebrity, however,
approached that of the Beatles phe
nomenon of that era. Few people re
member that Paar scooped Sullivan in
getting the Beatles on his show first. It
is the Beatles' appearance on the Ed
Sullivan show, however, that most peo
ple remember. What I remember is
Paar announcing on his show that he
had called Sullivan to bury the hatchet.
Paar took that action because his
daughter, Randy, had asked her father
to get her tickets to attend Sullivan's
show for the Beatles appearance.
It must have been difficult for Paar to
initiate that act of contrition. Among
the hardest things any of us have to do is
admit we are wrong and humbly ap
proach someone else and say we are
sorry. It must be particularly difficult
when someone is in a leadership posi
tion, such as the president of the United
States. It is difficult, but necessary. The
same year Paar approached Sullivan to
mend fences, President Lyndon Johnson
lied to the American people. Johnson
announced that North Vietnamese tor
pedo boats had attacked a U.S. destroy
er in the Tonkin Gulf and ordered U.S.

bombers to retaliate. A few days later he
asked fora congressional resolution to
support our actions against North Viet
nam, and effectively launched us into
the Vietnam War. No such attack had
occurred. In a 1994 book, "The War
Within: America's Battle Over Viet
nam," author Tom Wells writes that the
air strikes "reflected plans the adminis
tration had already drawn up for gradu
ally increasing its overt military pres
sure against the North." Johnson com
