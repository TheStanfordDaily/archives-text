Sexual assault policy fails students
I am writing in response to the article on
Tri-Delt ("Seven plead no contest in Tri-
Delt incident," Jan. 12). This incident in
volving underage sorority members, alcohol
and allegations of sexual assault is indicative
of how the University falls short of meeting
the needs of women who report sexual as
sault, and the University's failure to create a
standardized system and policy to address
sexual assault.
The article explained that a woman came
to the police to report that "she was coerced
into sexual acts," an allegation of sexual as
sault. It appears that the Santa Clara District
Attorney disregarded the sexual assault
charges in favor of charging all parties in
volved — the suspects who where charged
with sexual assault and the sorority members
who purchased the alcohol — with a blanket
penalty of providing alcohol to minors.
A woman goes to the police and reports a
sexual assault. She expects to be vindicated
and receive help, but instead she is treated
with the worst-case scenario. No sexual as
sault charges are filed and, worse, because
she reported the incident, four of her sorori
ty sisters are taken to court and charged with
providing alcohol to minors, and their names
are put in The Daily. The way this case was
handled will not encourage other people to
report sexual assaults on campus because, as
a result of this pledge coming forward, her
friends were punished and the police did not
take action to address the sexual assault.
The current policy on sexual assault is
not very accessible to students. If I cheat, I
can't say I didn't know what cheating was
and I did not know the consequences. The

sexual assault policy should be at least as
clear and accessible as the Honor Code.
The sexual assault policy should state up
front whether or not the victim will be pro
tected or held liable for violating alcohol
policy and state the risk of legal action
being taken against the victim. Students
need to understand where the line is in
terms of what constitutes sexual assault,
what the consequences will be if they cross
the line and where California state law
stands on having sex with someone im
paired by alcohol.
If a student reports sexual assault at Stan
ford, instead of receiving help and support,
it is possible the police will penalize the stu
dent's friends and their names will be leaked
to the student press. The University should
deal with sexual assault allegations in a way
that encourages reporting and addresses the
needs of the victims.

Article's accusation of apathy
misrepresents students
There are few things in this world that
have made me as angry as The Daily has
this year. Even my high school's bi-month
ly, four-page newspaper had more journal
istic integrity and credibility than what The
Daily has turned into. I'm not even talking
about the factual errors, the soft stories
that turn into front-page news or the obvi
ous, and sometimes hilarious, editing mis
takes. In fact, some of The Daily articles
are well written, and I applaud those staff
members who take the time to create

sound and entertaining news stories.
Unfortunately, the article ("Students
Apathetic to Sexual Assault," Jan. 30) does
not make my "Happy List." The term "ap
athetic" implies a lack, of concern, and I can
hardly believe that The Daily would label
Stanford students as uncaring regarding
such an emotional issue. But alas, the arti
cle reads in the first sentence, "A national
and campus-wide trend suggests a decline
in interest among students to address sexu
al assault and rape, despite statistics that
say sexual assault is as prevalent as ever."
It attempts to support this by claiming
that students are too embarrassed to dis
cuss the matter (in one of the most hilari
ous quotes taken out of context I've ever
seen), that in certain cases criminal
charges were never filed and that the na
tion tends to ignore the "less privileged,"
which evidently includes victims of sexual
assault (which, according to another quote
without context, fall under the category of
"the poor, youth, children [and] less-privi
leged women.")
Honestly, there are so many ridiculous
assertions made in this short article that I
don't even know where to begin. Referring
to victims of sexual assault as "less privi
leged women" degrades our peers who have
endured this type of violence; such terms en
courage the very type of sexist attitude that
promulgates sexual assault in the first place.
More importantly, the article never sup
ports the assertion that Stanford students
are apathetic to the issue; what it does prove
is that students are reluctant to discuss such
a weighty matter with a publication that has
consistently shown them that if they are
brave enough to talk about the issue, they

will regret it the next morning.
As the story mentions, there are many
campus resources for sexual assault vic
tims, run by individuals who are obviously
not "apathetic" to the issue. As Carol
Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion
Services on campus, says in the article, "In
my experience, the students who are well
informed are most likely to come forward
and seek help immediately."
I often wonder if The Daily sees itself as
progressing this goal.
The Daily, like any other publication,
has the responsibility to inform the student
body of important events or trends on
campus. But it is also its duty to do so in an
ethical manner — a fact that has been
sorely overlooked by one of the campus'
largest publications. Go ahead, dehuman
ize the victims, sensationalize the articles,
misquote and misspell to your heart's con
tent — but don't expect students to be
anything other than "apathetic" when they
read the story.

Daily must continue to serve
graduate students
Graduate students are a critical part of
the Stanford community. As Volume 225 of
The Daily commences, I hope the new edi
tors will make a commitment to investigate
the issues that face graduate students and
publish articles that relate to our student
population. Over the past several months.
The Daily has made great strides toward this
ideal — there have been over a dozen arti

cles related to Graduate Student Council ac
tivities or graduate-student-specific topics.
The new editors should build on this report
ing and take even greater steps to cover
graduate student news.
The Daily should cover graduate news
not only for the sake of students, but also to
enhance readership. Graduate students and
issues are often misunderstood and under
appreciated by the undergraduate popula
tion — Daily reporting can break down
these barriers and show where graduate stu
dent and undergraduate student interests
align, not just where they differ. Graduate
news is also exciting and relevant, as illus
trated by the construction of the Graduate
Community Center and GSC advocacy for
improved child care and academic policies.
Although The Daily receives a large frac
tion of its budget from graduate student
fees, Daily readership by graduate students
severely lags that of undergraduate stu
dents. By focusing more on graduate stu
dent issues, The Daily could better fulfill its
obligation to its fee base and simultaneous
ly increase readership.
Admittedly, graduate students are a
unique population — we wear bike helmets,
hole up in our departments, and even occa
sionally wake up before 8 a.m. (one reason
why The Daily should be distributed earlier
and closer to graduate student hang-outs.)
But we also represent a significant portion of
the student body, and the new editors — fol
lowing the lead of the last volume — should
get the scoop on stories related to graduate
students that are unfolding all over campus.
