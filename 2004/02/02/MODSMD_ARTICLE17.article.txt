## Superbowl proves more entertaining than expected 
### 
The Carolina Panthers came into Super
Bowl XXXVIII as seven-point under
dogs, and throughout the game, it looked
like the New England Patriots had finally
pulled away from the upstart Panthers, taking
leads of 7-0,14-7 and 21-10.
But each time, the Panthers answered back —
holding a 22-21 lead late in the game and tying it up
late, While the Patriots were the better team
in the end, winning the Super Bowl for the second
time in three years, the Panthers proved that they
belonged — and made fora far more entertaining
Super Bowl than most expected.
This game had everything you look for in a
Super Bowl.
Silly gadgetry that actually works: defensive
end Richard Seymour leading the Patriots' An
towain Smith into the end zone on a 2-yard touch-

down run in the fourth quarter,
and understandably uncovered
Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel
catching the game-winning
touchdown.
Some good special teams: Pa
triots placekicker Adam
Vinatieri coming through with
yet another game-winning kick,
from 41 yards with nine seconds
to play.
Plenty of bad special teams

placekicker Adam Vinatieri pushing a chip.shot
wide right and kicking another cheapie off the out
stretched hands of Panthers lineman Shane Bur
ton; Panthers kicker John Kasay pushing the last
kickoff of the game out of bounds; Panthers re
turner Rod "He Hate Me" Smart failing to lateral
on the game-ending kickoff return.
Excellent system quarterbacking — Tom
Brady and Jake Delhomme settling for uncon
vincing three-and-outs until game situations de
manded that they take risks and make plays.
Predictable running games — Antowain
Smith, Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster
proving once again that smart teams run the
football in the second half, too (Indianapolis,
are you listening?).
But, most importantly, and most entertaining
ly, fantastic defensive efforts all around — Vra
bel's spectacular blindside strip of Delhomme in
the first half, leading to a Patriots score; Reggie
Howard's fourth-quarter interception of Brady in
the end zone to keep the Panthers' hopes alive;
and a host of other excellent efforts.
With the Panthers scoring three touchdowns of
30 yards or more and the Patriots coming up with
a 52-yard play of their own. Super Bowl XXXVIII
proved what most of us learned playing Madden
'94 in middle school — when you can't get any
thing going against a stilling defense, throw it high
and deep and let your player battle it out with their
player.
The Panthers and offensive coordinator Dan
Henningcouldn't win the 11-on-! 1 battles with Pa
triots defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and
his system, but Steve Smith was able to beat Ty
Poole in a one-on-one matchup fora 39-yard score
and Mushin Muhammad was able to outrace all
the Patriots on his 85-yard touchdown reception.
If the Ravens showed the NFL how great de
fense is played in their Super Bowl XXXV demo
lition of the New York Giants (34-7), Super Bowl
XXXVIII showed us how great defense can be
beat.
It should also be mentioned that this Super
Bowl had excellent officiating, thanks in large part
to referee Ed Hochuli. If only Ed had been around
to call a few personal fouls during Justin Timber
lake and Janet Jackson's line-crossing halftime
performance.
But. while Janet and fellow halftime perform
ers P. Diddy and Kid Rock are holdovers from an
other era in American music (or so we can hope),
this game offered us a glimpse at the future of NFL
football. As much as fans love high-octane offense,
the Dick Vermeil-Mike Martz St. Louis Rams
have disappointed in every postseason but one.
Bill Belichick's Patriots, though, have done that
which is widely regarded as impossible in today's
NFL — sustain a dynasty. New England has
shown that, with the proper playbooks in place,
you can survive the perpetual roster turnover.
And the Panthers, who went 1-15 two years
ago, showed that you can build a great team in a
hurry if you eschew big-name, high-cost players
and build your team around your game plan.
Coming into this Super Bowl, there were all the
predictable jibes by people anticipating a boring,
low-scoring game or a convincing Patriots victory.
In the end, though, it worked out on both
counts. After opening the game with a longer scor
ing drought than any Super Bowl in history (al
most 27 minutes), the Panthers and Patriots com
bined for 58 points, destroying the over-under of
37.5, and the Panthers kept it close and exciting,
forcing the Patriots not just to hold on but to come
from behind in the fourth quarter.
And an Adam Vinatieri field goal decided it all.
Maybe it wasn't quite the stunner that it was
when Vinatieri's last-second kick lifted the 14-
point underdog Patriots over the Rams two years
ago. but this was far from a forgettable Super Bowl
— both for the fans who watched it on the edges of
their seats and for the NFL executives who better
have been taking notes.

37.5, and the Panthers kept it close and exciting,
forcing the Patriots not just to hold on but to come
from behind in the fourth quarter.
And an Adam Vinatieri field goal decided it all.
Maybe it wasn't quite the stunner that it was
when Vinatieri's last-second kick lifted the 14-
point underdog Patriots over the Rams two years
ago. but this was far from a forgettable Super Bowl
— both for the fans who watched it on the edges of
their seats and for the NFL executives who better
have been taking notes.

The Carolina Panthers came into Super
Bowl XXXVIII as seven-point under
dogs, and throughout the game, it looked
like the New England Patriots had finally
pulled away from the upstart Panthers, taking
leads of 7-0,14-7 and 21-10.
But each time, the Panthers answered back —
holding a 22-21 lead late in the game and tying it up
late, While the Patriots were the better team
in the end, winning the Super Bowl for the second
time in three years, the Panthers proved that they
belonged — and made fora far more entertaining
Super Bowl than most expected.
This game had everything you look for in a
Super Bowl.
Silly gadgetry that actually works: defensive
end Richard Seymour leading the Patriots' An
towain Smith into the end zone on a 2-yard touch-

down run in the fourth quarter,
and understandably uncovered
Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel
catching the game-winning
touchdown.
Some good special teams: Pa
triots placekicker Adam
Vinatieri coming through with
yet another game-winning kick,
from 41 yards with nine seconds
to play.
Plenty of bad special teams

' iW "V
placekicker Adam Vinatieri pushing a chip.shot
wide right and kicking another cheapie off the out
stretched hands of Panthers lineman Shane Bur
ton; Panthers kicker John Kasay pushing the last
kickoff of the game out of bounds; Panthers re
turner Rod "He Hate Me" Smart failing to lateral
on the game-ending kickoff return.
Excellent system quarterbacking — Tom
Brady and Jake Delhomme settling for uncon
vincing three-and-outs until game situations de
manded that they take risks and make plays.
Predictable running games — Antowain
Smith, Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster
proving once again that smart teams run the
football in the second half, too (Indianapolis,
are you listening?).
But, most importantly, and most entertaining
ly, fantastic defensive efforts all around — Vra
bel's spectacular blindside strip of Delhomme in
the first half, leading to a Patriots score; Reggie
Howard's fourth-quarter interception of Brady in
the end zone to keep the Panthers' hopes alive;
and a host of other excellent efforts.
With the Panthers scoring three touchdowns of
30 yards or more and the Patriots coming up with
a 52-yard play of their own. Super Bowl XXXVIII
proved what most of us learned playing Madden
'94 in middle school — when you can't get any
thing going against a stilling defense, throw it high
and deep and let your player battle it out with their
player.
The Panthers and offensive coordinator Dan
Henningcouldn't win the 11-on-! 1 battles with Pa
triots defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel and
his system, but Steve Smith was able to beat Ty
Poole in a one-on-one matchup fora 39-yard score
and Mushin Muhammad was able to outrace all
the Patriots on his 85-yard touchdown reception.
If the Ravens showed the NFL how great de
fense is played in their Super Bowl XXXV demo
lition of the New York Giants (34-7), Super Bowl
XXXVIII showed us how great defense can be
beat.
It should also be mentioned that this Super
Bowl had excellent officiating, thanks in large part
to referee Ed Hochuli. If only Ed had been around
to call a few personal fouls during Justin Timber
lake and Janet Jackson's line-crossing halftime
performance.
But. while Janet and fellow halftime perform
ers P. Diddy and Kid Rock are holdovers from an
other era in American music (or so we can hope),
this game offered us a glimpse at the future of NFL
football. As much as fans love high-octane offense,
the Dick Vermeil-Mike Martz St. Louis Rams
have disappointed in every postseason but one.
Bill Belichick's Patriots, though, have done that
which is widely regarded as impossible in today's
NFL — sustain a dynasty. New England has
shown that, with the proper playbooks in place,
you can survive the perpetual roster turnover.
And the Panthers, who went 1-15 two years
ago, showed that you can build a great team in a
hurry if you eschew big-name, high-cost players
and build your team around your game plan.
Coming into this Super Bowl, there were all the
predictable jibes by people anticipating a boring,
low-scoring game or a convincing Patriots victory.
In the end, though, it worked out on both
counts. After opening the game with a longer scor
ing drought than any Super Bowl in history (al
most 27 minutes), the Panthers and Patriots com
bined for 58 points, destroying the over-under of
37.5, and the Panthers kept it close and exciting,
forcing the Patriots not just to hold on but to come
from behind in the fourth quarter.
