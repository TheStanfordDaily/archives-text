# Baseball sweeps Fullerton 3-0
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The 2(M)4 Stanford baseball season opener was sup
posed to be a pitcher's battle. Cardinal Mark Ro
manczuk and Cal State Fullerton ace Ryan Schreppel,
both of whom are left-handed sophomores, were ex
pected to keep Friday's game a low-scoring affair.
But in the bottom of the first inning, Schreppel fell
apart, walking five and allowing a base-clearing triple by
senior Jonny Ash. By the end of the inning, the No. 4 Ti
tans (0-3) were facing a 6-0 deficit, a gap that continued
to widen as the game went on.
Needless to say, the 16-3 final score didn't reflect the
talent and power of the Titan team.
Saturday and yesterday, though, witnessed the battle
for which everyone was waiting, a fight that would be
won by the team able to exhibit the greatest amount of
depth.
But in the end, it was the No. 6 Cardinal (3-0) that
came out on top, winning 8-7 on Saturday and 4-1 on
Sunday to complete a sweep of its higher-ranked foe.
"Any time you win three from a team like Cal State
Fullerton, you have to be very pleased," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess.
The key for the Cardinal in this series was getting
contributions from every player that took the field.
Friday night was win number one for Romanczuk,
who threw a solid five innings before turning the ball
over to sophomore Jeff Gilmore for an inning. Fresh
man southpaw Blake Holler looked extremely poised as
he finished off the night for the Cardinal and picked up
the save, striking out four batters and allowing just one
run in his collegiate debut.
Fullerton got two runs onto the scoreboard in the top
of the second, when freshman Brett Pill drilled a triple
up the right field line, knocking in a run and putting him
in position to score on a Neil Walton base hit. Pill ended
up 4-for-5 on the night.
But that was not enough to stop the dominant Stan
ford offense, which exploded in the fifth inning with two
home runs. Sophomore John Mayberry Jr. hit a two-run
shot over the left field wall, while junior designated hit
ter Chris Carter drove in three in a two-out situation.

The Titans — a perennial member of the nation's
top-10 —came out strong Saturday afternoon, scoring
first against sophomore starter Matt Manship. Stanford
answered right back with a two-run single from Ash,
only to fall behind again when Fullerton junior Kurt
Suzuki squarely hit the scoreboard fora two-run homer.

The sixth inning was the Cardinal's time to shine,
though, as the team rallied from a two-out. 6-4 deficit to
reclaim the lead once and for all. Junior Danny Putnam
walked and sophomore Jed Lowrie roped a single, but
Carter and Ash were unable to get on base.
