# Baseball sweeps Fullerton 3-0
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The 2(M)4 Stanford baseball season opener was sup
posed to be a pitcher's battle. Cardinal Mark Ro
manczuk and Cal State Fullerton ace Ryan Schreppel,
both of whom are left-handed sophomores, were ex
pected to keep Friday's game a low-scoring affair.
But in the bottom of the first inning, Schreppel fell
apart, walking five and allowing a base-clearing triple by
senior Jonny Ash. By the end of the inning, the No. 4 Ti
tans (0-3) were facing a 6-0 deficit, a gap that continued
to widen as the game went on.
Needless to say, the 16-3 final score didn't reflect the
talent and power of the Titan team.
Saturday and yesterday, though, witnessed the battle
for which everyone was waiting, a fight that would be
won by the team able to exhibit the greatest amount of
depth.
But in the end, it was the No. 6 Cardinal (3-0) that
came out on top, winning 8-7 on Saturday and 4-1 on
Sunday to complete a sweep of its higher-ranked foe.
"Any time you win three from a team like Cal State
Fullerton, you have to be very pleased," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess.
The key for the Cardinal in this series was getting
contributions from every player that took the field.
Friday night was win number one for Romanczuk,
who threw a solid five innings before turning the ball
over to sophomore Jeff Gilmore for an inning. Fresh
man southpaw Blake Holler looked extremely poised as
he finished off the night for the Cardinal and picked up
the save, striking out four batters and allowing just one
run in his collegiate debut.
Fullerton got two runs onto the scoreboard in the top
of the second, when freshman Brett Pill drilled a triple
up the right field line, knocking in a run and putting him
in position to score on a Neil Walton base hit. Pill ended
up 4-for-5 on the night.
But that was not enough to stop the dominant Stan
ford offense, which exploded in the fifth inning with two
home runs. Sophomore John Mayberry Jr. hit a two-run
shot over the left field wall, while junior designated hit
ter Chris Carter drove in three in a two-out situation.

The Titans — a perennial member of the nation's
top-10 —came out strong Saturday afternoon, scoring
first against sophomore starter Matt Manship. Stanford
answered right back with a two-run single from Ash,
only to fall behind again when Fullerton junior Kurt
Suzuki squarely hit the scoreboard fora two-run homer.

The sixth inning was the Cardinal's time to shine,
though, as the team rallied from a two-out. 6-4 deficit to
reclaim the lead once and for all. Junior Danny Putnam
walked and sophomore Jed Lowrie roped a single, but
Carter and Ash were unable to get on base.

Sophomore infielder Chris Lewis fields a ball. The No. 6 Cardinal swept its season-opening series against No. 4 Cal State Fullerton this week

Catcher Donny Lucy, who at that point had been 0-
for-7 in the series, lined a key hit to left that scored Put
nam and pulled Stanford within one.
Fullerton replaced starter Ricky Romero with senior
righty John Tucker. In that two-out crucial spot. Mar
quess decided to put his faith in freshman Adam Sorgi,
pinch-hitting for sophomore Chris Lewis — Sorgi's first
collegiate plate appearance.
"(Sorgi) battles very well fora freshman," Marquess
said in explaining his decision. "He is beyond his years
as a player."
Sorgi came through for Marquess, hammering a sin
gle up the right field line, plating Lowrie and setting up
a tie-breaking opportunity for senior Sam Fuld.
Fuld delivered a double to left that drove in Lucy and
Sorgi, and put the Cardinal ahead 8-6.
Senior David O'Hagan came into the game in the top
of the seventh, replacing freshman Matt Leva, who
threw two-thirds of an inning in his first NCAA outing.
O'Hagan closed out the game, giving up only one run to
claim his first save of the year while ensuring the win for
Leva and the 8-7 triumph for the Cardinal.
"The bullpen was just amazing this weekend,"
Lowrie said. "That really sealed the deal [for us]."
Despite the five lead changes on Saturday, Sunday's
game proved to be the most hard-fought of the series.
The contest pitted Fullerton freshman Lauren Gag
nier against Stanford junior Mark Jecman. Jecman, who
stands an imposing 6-foot-8, saw very little time on the
mound during the 2003 season, pitching just 8 2 / 3 in

nings.
Jecman lasted five innings — a career-high — and
gave up only one run on a Fullerton sacrifice fly in the
second inning.
The Cardinal remained scoreless until the fourth,
when the switch-hitting Lowrie — who was the indis
putable offensive star of the series — hit his first career
homer over the right field wall.
"I just had to trust my hands," Lowrie said. "And
when I hit it, I knew I got it."
The next inning, Sorgi again found himself in position
to make a huge play — Lucy was on first with two-outs
and a tie score.
Sorgi ran the count to 2-2 and fouled off three pitch
es before pulling the ball deep into right field fora dou
ble. Lucy sped around the bases to score the go-ahead
run.
Gilmore was waved out of the bullpen for the last
three innings and held the Titans scoreless until the end.
Jecman collected the win, and Gilmore was awarded the
save.
Stanford put together another strong offensive in
ning in the sixth, as Lowrie picked up two more RBlson
a double to left. Lowrie was moved into the cleanup spot
for Sunday's game and batted .545 during the series.
Marquess said that he would have loved to say that
putting Lowrie in the four-hole was a stroke of genius,
but the move was an obvious one to make, he said.
"He's been the hottest hitter in practice," Marquess
said. "Anyone could see that."
Titan reliever Mike Martinez held the Cardinal with
out a run for the rest of the game but the sweep already
belonged to Stanford.

both of whom are left-handed sophomores, were ex
pected to keep Friday's game a low-scoring affair.
But in the bottom of the first inning, Schreppel fell
apart, walking five and allowing a base-clearing triple by
senior Jonny Ash. By the end of the inning, the No. 4 Ti
tans (0-3) were facing a 6-0 deficit, a gap that continued
to widen as the game went on.
Needless to say, the 16-3 final score didn't reflect the
talent and power of the Titan team.
Saturday and yesterday, though, witnessed the battle
for which everyone was waiting, a fight that would be
won by the team able to exhibit the greatest amount of
depth.
But in the end, it was the No. 6 Cardinal (3-0) that
came out on top, winning 8-7 on Saturday and 4-1 on
Sunday to complete a sweep of its higher-ranked foe.
"Any time you win three from a team like Cal State
Fullerton, you have to be very pleased," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess.
The key for the Cardinal in this series was getting
contributions from every player that took the field.
Friday night was win number one for Romanczuk,
who threw a solid five innings before turning the ball
over to sophomore Jeff Gilmore for an inning. Fresh
man southpaw Blake Holler looked extremely poised as
he finished off the night for the Cardinal and picked up
the save, striking out four batters and allowing just one
run in his collegiate debut.
Fullerton got two runs onto the scoreboard in the top
of the second, when freshman Brett Pill drilled a triple
up the right field line, knocking in a run and putting him
in position to score on a Neil Walton base hit. Pill ended
up 4-for-5 on the night.
But that was not enough to stop the dominant Stan
ford offense, which exploded in the fifth inning with two
home runs. Sophomore John Mayberry Jr. hit a two-run
shot over the left field wall, while junior designated hit
ter Chris Carter drove in three in a two-out situation.

The Titans — a perennial member of the nation's
top-10 —came out strong Saturday afternoon, scoring
first against sophomore starter Matt Manship. Stanford
answered right back with a two-run single from Ash,
only to fall behind again when Fullerton junior Kurt
Suzuki squarely hit the scoreboard fora two-run homer.

The sixth inning was the Cardinal's time to shine,
though, as the team rallied from a two-out. 6-4 deficit to
reclaim the lead once and for all. Junior Danny Putnam
walked and sophomore Jed Lowrie roped a single, but
Carter and Ash were unable to get on base.

Sophomore infielder Chris Lewis fields a ball. The No. 6 Cardinal swept its season-opening series against No. 4 Cal State Fullerton this week
end beating the Titans 16-3, 8-7 and 4-1 at Sunken Diamond.
Catcher Donny Lucy, who at that point had been 0-
for-7 in the series, lined a key hit to left that scored Put
nam and pulled Stanford within one.
Fullerton replaced starter Ricky Romero with senior
righty John Tucker. In that two-out crucial spot. Mar
quess decided to put his faith in freshman Adam Sorgi,
pinch-hitting for sophomore Chris Lewis — Sorgi's first
collegiate plate appearance.
"(Sorgi) battles very well fora freshman," Marquess
said in explaining his decision. "He is beyond his years
as a player."
Sorgi came through for Marquess, hammering a sin
gle up the right field line, plating Lowrie and setting up
a tie-breaking opportunity for senior Sam Fuld.
Fuld delivered a double to left that drove in Lucy and
Sorgi, and put the Cardinal ahead 8-6.
Senior David O'Hagan came into the game in the top
of the seventh, replacing freshman Matt Leva, who
threw two-thirds of an inning in his first NCAA outing.
O'Hagan closed out the game, giving up only one run to
claim his first save of the year while ensuring the win for
Leva and the 8-7 triumph for the Cardinal.
"The bullpen was just amazing this weekend,"
Lowrie said. "That really sealed the deal [for us]."
Despite the five lead changes on Saturday, Sunday's
game proved to be the most hard-fought of the series.
The contest pitted Fullerton freshman Lauren Gag
nier against Stanford junior Mark Jecman. Jecman, who
stands an imposing 6-foot-8, saw very little time on the
mound during the 2003 season, pitching just 8 2 / 3 in

nings.
Jecman lasted five innings — a career-high — and
gave up only one run on a Fullerton sacrifice fly in the
second inning.
The Cardinal remained scoreless until the fourth,
when the switch-hitting Lowrie — who was the indis
putable offensive star of the series — hit his first career
homer over the right field wall.
"I just had to trust my hands," Lowrie said. "And
when I hit it, I knew I got it."
The next inning, Sorgi again found himself in position
to make a huge play — Lucy was on first with two-outs
and a tie score.
Sorgi ran the count to 2-2 and fouled off three pitch
es before pulling the ball deep into right field fora dou
ble. Lucy sped around the bases to score the go-ahead
run.
Gilmore was waved out of the bullpen for the last
three innings and held the Titans scoreless until the end.
Jecman collected the win, and Gilmore was awarded the
save.
Stanford put together another strong offensive in
ning in the sixth, as Lowrie picked up two more RBlson
a double to left. Lowrie was moved into the cleanup spot
for Sunday's game and batted .545 during the series.
Marquess said that he would have loved to say that
putting Lowrie in the four-hole was a stroke of genius,
but the move was an obvious one to make, he said.
"He's been the hottest hitter in practice," Marquess
said. "Anyone could see that."
Titan reliever Mike Martinez held the Cardinal with
out a run for the rest of the game but the sweep already
belonged to Stanford.
