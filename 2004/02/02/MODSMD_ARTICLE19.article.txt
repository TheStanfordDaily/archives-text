# Card steps up offensive intensity in second half
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Ducks just have to hold on for 10 min
utes and they will have one of their biggest
wins in recent memory — a convincing win
over undefeated Stanford.
The atmosphere is so crazy that Chris Her
nandez, one of the leading free-throw shooters
in Pacific-10 Conference history, misses his
first foul shot. He hits the second one, and then
nails a 3-pointer on the Cardinal's next posses
sion.
On the next trip down the floor, Josh Chil
dress draws a foul and makes both free throws.
Next possession: Joe Kirchofer converts a tip
in. No big deal, though — Oregon still leads
by 12 with less than eight minutes remaining.
But the parade of Stanford baskets doesn't
stop. With 5:53 remaining, Childress commits
an offensive foul. Of its last 19 possessions,
this is the only one on which the Cardinal fails
to score.
Fora team that shot a rim-clanging 27.6
percent in the first half, this is a remarkable
turnaround.
"Quite a second half by our guys," head
coach Mike Montgomery agreed after the
game.
Childress's play was integral to the come
back, but the two biggest catalysts were point
guard Hernandez and forward Matt Haryasz,
who scored 22 and 13, respectively, in the sec
ond half. Hernandez came into the game aver
aging 10 points per game, Haryasz eight.
So, how did they shred a defense that had
appeared impenetrable in the first half as the
Cardinal coped with the absence of big men
Justin Davis and Rob Little due to injury and
foul trouble, respectively?
They just lowered their shoulders and went

hard to the basket.
"Without half of our post game, and no one
attacking the basket, Chris decided to turn the
corner off the top ball screen, used his body,
and got to the hoop for some baskets," Mont
gomery said. "They were going behind the
screen, and we wanted him to pull back and
shoot some shots, but he found a hole going to
the hoop."
It's fair to say he found several holes. Her
nandez scored 12 consecutive points for the
Cardinal between 13:01 and 9:39, and every
time in the second half the offense seemed to
stall, he beat his man off the dribble and cre
ated something. Often, that something was a
layup, a foul on Oregon, or both at once.
"The times I've stepped up and scored are
when nobody else has been able to do it,"
Hernandez said. But once he began to light up
the scoreboard, it created openings for others,
like Haryasz.
"With it being my first [collegiate] start, it
was natural to be a little nervous and a little
tentative in the first half," Haryasz said. "But
in the second half, I said 'Screw it, I'm just
going to play ball.' "
The 6-foot-10, 225-pound sophomore had
been outmuscled in the first half, and the
Ducks made a point of denying him his fa
vorite jump shot from the top of the key
throughout the game. That left him the option
of either passing or putting the ball on the
floor and using his quickness to get by the de
fenders. Haryasz wisely chose the second op
tion, again and again.
"I felt that [my quickness] was something I
could maybe exploit a little bit," he said.
That's what he did when Stanford had the
ball with under a minute left, up by two and
needing a basket to secure the win. Haryasz

got the ball at the top of the key and, predictably,
had defenders in his face ready to take away the
shot. He jabbed to the right of his defender, lower
ing his left shoulder as he put the ball on the floor.
He looked up toward the basket, but saw another

Duck standing in his way.
On his other drives, he had been left open for the
lay-up, so he said he hadn't anticipated finding a
help-side defender blocking his path.
"It's a good thing we wear red," he said, joking
that he wouldn't have been able to spot his open
teammate, Nick Robinson, otherwise. "1 wasn't ex
pecting him to be open, but he was, so 1 just kind of
wrapped it around to him."
Robinson, left alone by the defender who had
slid toward Haryasz, took the beautiful pass and
gently laid the ball into the basket, all but sealing
the victory for Stanford.
