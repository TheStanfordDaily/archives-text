# The 						No. 2 men's basketball team came back from a 19-point second half deficit to defeat Oregon at MacArthur Court.
## STILL UNDEFEATED 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was the type of game that can define a season.
Facing the most adversity it has encountered all year, in
front of arguably the Pacific-10 Conference's loudest and
most hostile crowd, the No. 2 Stanford men's basketball
team (18-0, 9-0 Pacific-10 Conference) erased a 19-point
second-half deficit to beat Oregon, 83-80.
"I'm really proud of the team," sophomore forward
Matt Haryasz said. "We did a great job rallying."
And they did it against a team tied for second place in the
Pac-10, with both of their starting big men watching from
the bench. Senior forward Justin Davis sat out with a knee
injury, and junior center Rob Little played just five minutes
due to foul trouble.

In their absence, Haryasz scored a career-high 19 points
and added seven rebounds in his first collegiate start. His
performance was topped only by that of sophomore guard
Chris Hernandez, who scored all 22 of his points in the sec
ond half.
"To be down to this team in Mac Court is tough," head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "It was a pretty doggone
good win."
The team's biggest win of the year?
"It was definitely up there considering the circumstances
we faced," Montgomery said.
Yes, Stanford beat Kansas when the Jayhawks were
ranked No. 1 in the country. And the Cardinal won on the


JAKE OKTAWIEC/The Stanford Daily File
road against Arizona, the conference's only other
ranked team. But a perfect record gets harder to defend
as a season goes on, and with everything going wrong on
Saturday, it would have been easy for Stanford to suc
cumb to the pressure.
"It was a big feat," Hernandez said of the come-from
behind victory. "I don't think I've ever been more emo
tionally drained after a game."
Montgomery praised the Ducks for their first-half
performance.
"Oregon is a great basketball team," he said. "In the
first half, Oregon was clearly the aggressor. But in the
second half, we got some confidence back and at
tacked."
The attack came, not in the form of one of Stanford's
trademark runs, but from a barrage of baskets through
out the second half, during which the Cardinal scored 59
points on 64 percent shooting. That was after scoring
just 24 points on 28 percent shooting in the first half.
Early in the game, Stanford did an effective job of
containing senior All-America candidate Luke Jackson
in the first half, but had a harder time shadowing the
Ducks' lesser-known players.
Oregon systematically worked the ball inside to 6-
foot-11 forward lan Crosswhite and 6-foot-10, 270-
pound center Mitch Piatt, overpowering the slender
Haryasz and drawing three very quick fouls on Rob
Little. With Little out, the Ducks asserted their domi
nance inside, while guards James Davis and Andre
Joseph rained long jumpers over the heads of the Stan
ford defenders.
Josh Childress was well-scouted and could not find
any openings for penetration along the baseline, failing
to score from the field in the first half. Nick Robinson
was perhaps the only Cardinal who found open looks,
but his aim was poor and he. too, was blanked for the
half.
It was as if Oregon was beating Stanford at its own
game, using its strength in the paint, solid execution and
outside shooting to control the game and turning to its
role players for scoring.
The score was 39-24 at the half, Stanford's lowest
first-half output of the season.
The second half initially looked to be more of the

same, except that as soon as Stanford switched to its usu
ally effective 1-1-3 zone, Oregon's Jackson began to find
his rhythm. Jackson hit his third 3-pointer of the half to
put the Ducks ahead 59-44 with 10:31 remaining, and
the game appeared out of reach.
But that's when Childress, Hernandez and Haryasz
began to sense weaknesses in the Oregon defense. The
three combined for 45 second-half points.
Crosswhite got into foul trouble, and his replace
ment, Jay Anderson, was ineffective, failing to score
while recording one assist and one rebound in 26
minutes.
Once the Cardinal pulled within seven points with
seven minutes remaining, Hernandez said, "We looked
at each other and knew we were going to win this game."
Oregon didn't just hand it to the Cardinal, though.
Using slashing drives and quick pull-up jumpers, Jack
son scored 22 of his 25 points in the second half despite
the fact that the Cardinal quickly returned to man-to
man and put the athletic Childress on him.
With less than seven minutes remaining, Stanford
down by seven, and the shot clock running out, it
seemed that Oregon was about to come up with a crucial
defensive stop and perhaps extend its lead again. In
stead, Matt Lottich threw up a fall-away 3-pointer at the
shot-clock buzzer that somehow banked in, conjuring
memories of a similar crucial shot by Hernandez against
Southern California.
It's just been that kind of season for Stanford.
The Cardinal took their first lead on a 3-pointer by
Childress three minutes later, and sank 6-ot-8 free
throws down the stretch to hold on.
A desperate 3-pointer by Oregon's Davis pulled the
Ducks within one at 81-80 with just two seconds re
maining. They took more than a second to foul Hernan
dez after the inbounds pass, though, and there were only
0.2 seconds on the clock when Hernandez hit both free
throws to make it 83-80.
The wild game wasn't quite over yet, as an Oregon in
bounds heave somehow found a jumping, twisting Davis
in the air, and he released it from behind the arc. The
crowd gasped as the circus shot headed straight for the
hoop, but it glanced off the rim and the game ended.
With the win, Stanford became the seventh team in
Pac-10 history to complete the first half of the regular
season conference schedule undefeated, defeating each
league opponent once. Oregon (10-6, 5-4) dropped out
of a second-place tie with Arizona with its first home
loss of the season.

most hostile crowd, the No. 2 Stanford men's basketball
team (18-0, 9-0 Pacific-10 Conference) erased a 19-point
second-half deficit to beat Oregon, 83-80.
"I'm really proud of the team," sophomore forward
Matt Haryasz said. "We did a great job rallying."
And they did it against a team tied for second place in the
Pac-10, with both of their starting big men watching from
the bench. Senior forward Justin Davis sat out with a knee
injury, and junior center Rob Little played just five minutes
due to foul trouble.

In their absence, Haryasz scored a career-high 19 points
and added seven rebounds in his first collegiate start. His
performance was topped only by that of sophomore guard
Chris Hernandez, who scored all 22 of his points in the sec
ond half.
"To be down to this team in Mac Court is tough," head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "It was a pretty doggone
good win."
The team's biggest win of the year?
"It was definitely up there considering the circumstances
we faced," Montgomery said.
Yes, Stanford beat Kansas when the Jayhawks were
ranked No. 1 in the country. And the Cardinal won on the


JAKE OKTAWIEC/The Stanford Daily File
road against Arizona, the conference's only other
ranked team. But a perfect record gets harder to defend
as a season goes on, and with everything going wrong on
Saturday, it would have been easy for Stanford to suc
cumb to the pressure.
"It was a big feat," Hernandez said of the come-from
behind victory. "I don't think I've ever been more emo
tionally drained after a game."
Montgomery praised the Ducks for their first-half
performance.
"Oregon is a great basketball team," he said. "In the
first half, Oregon was clearly the aggressor. But in the
second half, we got some confidence back and at
tacked."
The attack came, not in the form of one of Stanford's
trademark runs, but from a barrage of baskets through
out the second half, during which the Cardinal scored 59
points on 64 percent shooting. That was after scoring
just 24 points on 28 percent shooting in the first half.
Early in the game, Stanford did an effective job of
containing senior All-America candidate Luke Jackson
in the first half, but had a harder time shadowing the
Ducks' lesser-known players.
Oregon systematically worked the ball inside to 6-
foot-11 forward lan Crosswhite and 6-foot-10, 270-
pound center Mitch Piatt, overpowering the slender
Haryasz and drawing three very quick fouls on Rob
Little. With Little out, the Ducks asserted their domi
nance inside, while guards James Davis and Andre
Joseph rained long jumpers over the heads of the Stan
ford defenders.
Josh Childress was well-scouted and could not find
any openings for penetration along the baseline, failing
to score from the field in the first half. Nick Robinson
was perhaps the only Cardinal who found open looks,
but his aim was poor and he. too, was blanked for the
half.
It was as if Oregon was beating Stanford at its own
game, using its strength in the paint, solid execution and
outside shooting to control the game and turning to its
role players for scoring.
The score was 39-24 at the half, Stanford's lowest
first-half output of the season.
The second half initially looked to be more of the

same, except that as soon as Stanford switched to its usu
ally effective 1-1-3 zone, Oregon's Jackson began to find
his rhythm. Jackson hit his third 3-pointer of the half to
put the Ducks ahead 59-44 with 10:31 remaining, and
the game appeared out of reach.
But that's when Childress, Hernandez and Haryasz
began to sense weaknesses in the Oregon defense. The
three combined for 45 second-half points.
Crosswhite got into foul trouble, and his replace
ment, Jay Anderson, was ineffective, failing to score
while recording one assist and one rebound in 26
minutes.
Once the Cardinal pulled within seven points with
seven minutes remaining, Hernandez said, "We looked
at each other and knew we were going to win this game."
Oregon didn't just hand it to the Cardinal, though.
Using slashing drives and quick pull-up jumpers, Jack
son scored 22 of his 25 points in the second half despite
the fact that the Cardinal quickly returned to man-to
man and put the athletic Childress on him.
With less than seven minutes remaining, Stanford
down by seven, and the shot clock running out, it
seemed that Oregon was about to come up with a crucial
defensive stop and perhaps extend its lead again. In
stead, Matt Lottich threw up a fall-away 3-pointer at the
shot-clock buzzer that somehow banked in, conjuring
memories of a similar crucial shot by Hernandez against
Southern California.
It's just been that kind of season for Stanford.
The Cardinal took their first lead on a 3-pointer by
Childress three minutes later, and sank 6-ot-8 free
throws down the stretch to hold on.
A desperate 3-pointer by Oregon's Davis pulled the
Ducks within one at 81-80 with just two seconds re
maining. They took more than a second to foul Hernan
dez after the inbounds pass, though, and there were only
0.2 seconds on the clock when Hernandez hit both free
throws to make it 83-80.
The wild game wasn't quite over yet, as an Oregon in
bounds heave somehow found a jumping, twisting Davis
in the air, and he released it from behind the arc. The
crowd gasped as the circus shot headed straight for the
hoop, but it glanced off the rim and the game ended.
With the win, Stanford became the seventh team in
Pac-10 history to complete the first half of the regular
season conference schedule undefeated, defeating each
league opponent once. Oregon (10-6, 5-4) dropped out
of a second-place tie with Arizona with its first home
loss of the season.
