# Women dominate Washington State Cougars
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
The No. 8 Stanford women's basketball team (17-3,
10-1 Pacific-10 Conference) held a perfect 37-0 all-time
record against Washington State (5-15,1-10) coming into
their matchup on Saturday — and the Cardinal was not
about to let it get tarnished, coming away with a dominat
ing 91-67 victory over the Cougars.
The Cardinal took the lead 15 seconds into the contest
and never relinquished it, coasting past a clearly over
matched WSU squad.
Junior Sebneni Kimyacioglu set the tone for the Car
dinal. hitting the team's first shot of the afternoon, a 3-
pointer from the wing. Things would only get worse for
the Cougars.
Washington State made the mistake of leaving Stan
ford's shooters op*n from long range and the Cardinal
made the Cougars pay dearly. Stanford took 31 shots
from beyond the arc and made 15 of them.
Junior guard Susan Borchardt led the way with four
treys, finishing with 14 points on the afternoon.
"Over half of their shots were threes," said Washing

ton State head coach Sherri Murrell. "That's pretty amaz
ing. It's one thing to take them and another to make
them."
Stanford's field-goal percentage certainly didn't suffer
from the copious amount of long range shooting — the
Cardinal shot 50 percent from the field and 48.4 percent
from downtown.
"I actually pulled people who weren't taking their
shot," Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer said. "I saw
four or five people who had wide open three pointers and
they didn't take them We had 31 attempts and 1
thought we could have shot 10 more."
While the Cardinal may not have pulled the trigger on
every opportunity, its offensive execution and ball move
ment were markedly improved from last weekend's rocky
trip to Los Angeles, where it was pushed to overtime by
UCLA and lost to Southern California.
Sa'urday, Stanford recorded an impressive 25 assists
on 30 field goals and displayed outstanding scoring distri
bution, with five players finishing in double figures:
Nicole Powell (15), Borchardt, T'Nae Thiel (13), Krista
Rappahahn (11) and Kelley Suminski (10).
In just 28 minutes of play, two-time All-American

Powell missed a triple-double by the smallest of margins,
tallying nine rebounds and 10 assists to go with her 15
points. She also added four steals.
Despite the overwhelming victory, VanDerveer was
not particularly pleased with her team's effort.
"I thought our second half was very uninspired," she
said. "Great teams don't care who they're playing. They
go out and play hard for 40 minutes."
After building a 27-point lead by halftime, the Cardi
nal gave up several easy layups and a slew of uncontested
shots in the second half while being outscored by Wash
ington State 45-42 in the second half.
Forward Bianca McCall led the Cougar charge, finish
ing with a career-high 29 points, 20 of which came in the
second half. McCall added eight rebounds.
Sophomore guard Charmaine Jones and freshman
forward Kate Benz also made strong contributions for
Washington State. Jones had a career-high 19 points
while Benz tallied a double-double with 14 points and 11
rebounds before she cracked a tooth diving fora loose
ball and was forced to leave the game.
