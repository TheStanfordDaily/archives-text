# Fast-spreading virus spares campus

### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The MyDOOM virus, possibly the
fastest-spreading e-mail virus ever, largely
spared Stanford when it hit last Monday, ac
cording to Information Technology Systems
and Services officials.
The virus, which was responsible for one
in every 12 e-mails last Monday, avoided
".edu" addresses, so most Stanford e-mail ac
counts were not affected, said Sandra Senti,
executive director for technology strategy
and support.
There are several protections in place to
avoid similar viruses, so Stanford users should

be fairly safe, Senti said.
"We have a company which scans every
piece of mail," she said. "We have begun
throwing away infected messages, as they
rarely have any useful content."
Still, she warned Stanford computer users
not to become too complacent.
"If you get a message with an attachment
and don't know who it came from, don't open
it," she said. "Be especially careful because it
might look like it's coming from a legitimate
source like the mail server."
The MyDOOM virus installed a backdoor
into computers and was programmed to attack
the www.sco.com Web site on Sunday, accord
ing to Message Labs, a company that monitors

corporate e-mail.
Though the virus spread quickly, it did not
end up affecting as many computer systems as
past e-mail viruses.
"With Sobig.f [another e-mail virus|, we
heard a lot more about companies shutting
down for the day," said Lori Sinsley, a
spokesperson for Message Labs. "We haven't
seen that level yet."
Sinsley credited the lack of damage to bet
ter preparation by companies.
Stanford students and staff members were
also protected from the virus by free virus pro
tection software from Symantec, which was
able to stop the virus within a day of its ap
pearance.
