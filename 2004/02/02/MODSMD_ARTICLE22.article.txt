## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
It's been more than three months since the
"Serial Groper" has struck the Stanford campus,
and police and students are optimistic that he has
moved on to other haunts.
"He's kind of hard to catch if he's not hitting,"
said Sgt. Rick Tipton. "He could have moved
on."
The groper's last assault, as reported to police,
was on Oct. 30.
"Fart of crime-fighting is tocatch or displace,"
Tipton said. "He could be the kind of guy who felt
uncomfortable and quit doing it, but I doubt it."
Students remarked that they had stopped
worrying about the groper ever since he became
a campus joke.
"People dressed up as him for Halloween,"
noted freshman Kristle McCracken, who said she
generally felt safe on campus.
A sketch of the serial groper was released a
week prior to his last attack, and the sketch gar
nered attention of the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury News and the Los Angeles
Times.

In a similar case, a university janitor was ar
rested two weeks ago at Harvard after the sixth
assault in four months on that campus. Accord
ing to The Harvard Crimson, the police were
able to find the janitor after a quick report by a
victim allowed them to identify the suspect en
tering a building wearing a janitorial uniform.
They went into the building and identified the
suspect that night.
Stanford police also suspected that the "Seri
al Groper" on campus was a janitor, but never
pinpointed a suspect.
The groper at Stanford was hard to catch be
cause he struck from a bicycle, grabbing more
than two dozen women on the buttocks before
stopping his spree.
During the summer, there were no attacks re
ported for about five weeks, but there has not
been a hiatus of more than two months since the
attacks began in May.
Tipton warned students not to let up their
guard just yet.
"Whether the groper is out there or not. there
may be other things going on," he said. "You
should be exceedingly cautious about yourself
and your surroundings."
