## Pundits analyze NH primaries 
### MATTHEW KELLY THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. —In the wake of
Sen. John Kerry's 12-point victory in the New Hamp
shire Democratic primary election Tuesday, three
electoral experts analyzed the meaning of the results,
the wisdom of the process itself, and what to expect in
the general election. The three — Rockefeller Center
Director and Dartmouth College Government Prof.
Linda Fowler, St. Anselm College Political Science
Prof. Dean Spiliotes and Emory University Political
Science Professor Alan Abramowitz — said that it
would he difficult for Kerry to lose the nomination if
he does well in the seven states that have their pri
maries on Feb. 3. But unfortunately for Democrats,
they also doubted the nominee's chances against Pres
ident George W. Bush in November.
Spiliotes analyzed the exit polling from Tuesday's
election that showed a broad base of support for
Kerry. Spiliotes said he was surprised at how well
Kerry did among veterans compared with former Gen.
Wesley Clark and at his level of labor union support,
which former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean has court
ed aggressively.
Kerry also had the most support from voters who
singled out electability as their primary concern and
among voters who decided their candidate in the week
before the election.
Dean did well among voters who decided their can
didate more than a month ago, voters whose main
issue was the war in Iraq and voters who identified
themselves as very liberal.
Spiliotes said that former frontrunner Dean's defeat
can be explained by the fact that he did not look presi
dential enough, which is an especially important factor
for undeclared voters who aren't issue-driven and don't
follow politics as closely. He said that the"I have a
scream" speech was an important event for voters decid
ing against Dean.
Abramowitz, an expert at forecasting elections, said
that it depends little on whom the Democrats nominate
because Bush presents such a formidable challenge. Bush
presents a problem mainly because of his status as a first
term incumbent, his relatively high approval ratings, and

the high probability that the economy will continue its re
bound.
Abramowitz's calculations show that for Bush to lose
in November his approval rating would have to drop to
around 40 percent and the economy would have to once
again go into recession. The calculations' margin of error
is 2 to 3 percentage points. Abramowitz discounted the
effect of Bush's fundraising operation, which is targeted
to raise $170 to $200 million.
"It's a little depressing based on your point of view,"
Abramowitz said. "The reality is that when you have a
first-term incumbent, it's difficult to be defeated."
The one piece of reassuring advice Abramowitz of
fered Democrats was to wait until 2008, pointing to spec
ulation that Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) will run for the
presidency then.
Whereas Spiliotes and Abramowitz analyzed the cur
rent status of the primary and the chances for the gener
al election. Fowler questioned the process itself. She es
pecially criticized the media for relying on polls and fo
cusing on the horserace qualities of the primary process.
She said this year's primaries are especially difficult
for the candidates, as the Democrats compacted their pri
mary schedule following the 2000 election. The shorter
process magnifies the effect of momentum and the im
portance of a national organization. She said that they ex
pected A1 Gore, who already has a national organization,
to run again, but that they are now are left with candi
dates without any national organization.
The fact that candidates spend about a year cam
paigning ii lowa and New Hampshire and only a few
days in the other states also amplifies the impact of the
media, she said.
The primary schedule is so compact and difficult that
the nominee will be a "dead man walking" going into the
general election. Fowler said.
"The winner of the primary system will then have the
wonderful treat of facing George W. Bush and his $2(X)
million," Fowler said.
Spiliotes and Fowler are co-authors of several papers,
including one analyzing the voting patterns of undeclared
voters. Spiliotes is also the author of the book "Vicious
Cycle," which discusses how presidents manage the econ
omy. Abramowitz is a renowned political forecasting ex
pert and author of several books.
