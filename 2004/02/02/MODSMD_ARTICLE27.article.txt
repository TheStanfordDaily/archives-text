# Trial date set on corpse case

### RYAN P. FULLER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-DAVIS 
(U-WIRE) DAVIS, Calif. — In a brief court ap
pearance last Thursday, Davis, Calif., resident
David Lawrence Beale waived his right to a prelimi
nary hearing. His trial date will he set on Feb. 19,
when charges will be formally brought against him.
Earlier, Beale entered innocent pleas to charges of
receiving stolen property, possession of methamphet
amines and unlawful deposit and disposal of human
remains. He faces the same charges.
If convicted on these counts, Beale could face a
maximum of three years and eight months in
prison, said Yolo County Deputy District Attorney
Jim Walker.
Attempts to reach Beale or the Yolo County public
defender representing him were unsuccessful.
A former autopsy technician for Pathology Sup

port Services, Beale was arrested in July 2003 after
being traced to mummified body parts discovered in a
Dumpster.
A search of his home and a shed found metham
phetamines, stolen surgical equip.ment and 157
pounds of human remains to be in his possession. The
remains were traced to the University of California-
Davis Medical Center, which contracted its autopsy
services to Pathology Support Services.
"If we go to trial, this will be a very gruesome
case," Walker said. "There was a very large amount
of human remains — photos have to be entered
into evidence. It's a difficult case for any jury to
hear."
In a separate suit, a family member whose deceased
relative's body part was found in Beale's shed filed a
lawsuit against the defendant, the UCDMC and
Pathology Support Services on Dec. 19, 2003. That
case is still pending.
