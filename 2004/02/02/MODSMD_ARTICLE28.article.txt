# FDA considers over-the-counter sale of emergency contraceptive
## 
### KATIE YUST LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY 
(U-WI RE) BATON ROUGE, La. â€” The Food and
Drug Administration is debating whether emergency
contraceptive, currently available with a prescription
from the Women's Clinic of the Louisiana State Uni
versity Health Center, will be sold over the counter.
EC, also known as the morning-after pill, is a two
dose oral method of birth control taken up to 72 hours
after unprotected sex to prevent fertilization of an egg.
"Emergency contraceptive can decrease a woman's
chance of pregnancy by up to 89 percent," said Christi
na Kucera. director of Public Affairs at Planned Parent
hood of Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta.
Since EC can only be acquired with a prescrip
tion, it is currently unavailable when the University
Heath Center and other local providers are closed,
mainly weekends and holidays. The FDA is con
cerned that those are times when women might need
EC the most.
In December 2(K)3, two FDA advisory committees
recommended that a brand of EC called Plan B be made
available without a doctor's prescription.
Not all the doctors at the on-campus Women's Clin
ic are authorized to write prescriptions for Plan B. so
making an appointment is ofien necessary to receive
the medication.
"The name Plan B' was chosen in order to commu
nicate that this is Plan B. Plan A is abstinence, family
planning and routine methods of birth control," said Dr.
Carole Ben-Mairnon, president of Barr Laboratories,
which manufactures Plan B.
EC meets the criteria for over-the-counter drugs
including low toxicity, no potential for overdose or
addiction, self indication of need and uniform
dosage.
Common side effects of Plan B include nausea,
cramping, dizziness and irregular bleeding.
"[EC] might cause serious bleeding and has the po

tential for adverse medical reactions," said Kathy
Saichuk, LSU Wellness Education coordinator. "From
a health standpoint, I have concerns. Proper usage and
knowledge of possible side effects is very important."
"If a Plan B user is pregnant from a previous sexual
encounter, the drug will not harm the fetus," said
Kucera. "That fact makes Plan B less controversial than
RU-486, the abortion pill."
Opponents of Plan B believe that wider access to the
contraceptive will increase sexual carelessness, especial
ly among teens.
"There could be opportunities for misuse and the
risk that women may engage in less healthy sexual be
haviors, such as assuming EC provides protection from
sexually transmitted infections, which it does not,"
Saichuk said. "People might assume that [EC] is an au
tomatic answer."
Those in favor of over-the-counter EC argue
otherwise.
"Plan B is much more expensive and uncomfortable
than using a condom and that will keep women from
using it as a regular method of birth control," Kucera
said. "Once |Plan B| is widely accessible, it will help to
prevent the 1.7 million unwanted pregnancies and
800,000 abortions that occur every year."
Student opinions about making EC over-the
counter vary.
"Personally, 1 think [EC] should be sold at a phar
macy," said senior Anna DesOrmeaux, who is current
ly president of Sexual Health Advocates. "I had a 17-
year-old friend who called me one night in tears after a
condom broke during sex. I was on the phone for hours
trying to find a place where she could get the morning
after pill. It is not an issue of carelessness, but of pre
venting unwanted pregnancy."
Many major health-care organizations, including the
American Medical Association and the American Col
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, support mak
ing EC available without a prescription.
The FDA's decision is expected in late February.
