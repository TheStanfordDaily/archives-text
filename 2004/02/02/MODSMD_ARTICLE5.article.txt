# Fee refunds alarm Womenspeak
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Facing a staggering number of
ASSU special fee refund requests,
Womenspeak is rallying to find al
ternative funding. Without that
funding, the literary magazine may
not be able to produce issues in the
near future. Several other women's
groups have joined the cause, call
ing for the reestablishment of a
women's coalition to act as an um
brella organization.
Female student leaders said they
hope the potential coalition will
strengthen the campus women's
community, a group which they said
has been increasingly marginalized
in recent years.
While the overall refund rate
stands at 14 percent, 21 percent of
students requested a refund for
their Womenspeak special fees. Ac
cording to Senate Chair Josh Shipp,
a junior, the ASSU Appropriations
Committee predicts the overall rate
of refund requests will reach as high
as 29 percent for spring quarter,
which could cause the special fees
system to collapse. The committee
has vowed not to touch groups' cur
rent budgets, but they may tap some
reserve budgets if the groups have a

high number of refund requests.
"I think many of the students re
questing a refund on the Women
speak special fees may not realize
how crucial the ASSU funding is to
the publication of the magazine,"
said editor Jessica Williams, a ju
nior. "This financial contribution is
vital to sustaining the production of
the magazine."
According to Williams, Women
speak allows the Stanford commu
nity the unique opportunity to view
politics, racial consciousness and
sexuality through women's prose,
poetry and artwork.
In considering options for alter
native sources of funding, the edi
tors at Womenspeak collaborating
with peers at the Women's Commu
nity Center and other Women's
Voluntary Student Organizations
(WVSOs), proposed renewing the
Stanford Women's Coalition, a sin
gle body that could streamline fund
ing and programming for all
women's groups on campus.
"The Women's Coalition was
originally formed before the center
existed," said junior Jane Nevins, a
staff member at the center. "After
the center was opened, the


WAYNE Ll/The Stanford Daily
Women's Coalition supported and
created alliances between WVSOs,
and funded WVSOs, such as Woinen
speak."
The Women's Coalition deactivat
ed two years ago due to sapped inter
est and the strengthening of individual
women's groups, which chose to seek
separate special fees instead of split
ting them with other WVSOs.
According to Nevins, the potential
coalition will "provide resources to
support and build alliances between
WVSOs, increase awareness of
women's issues in the greater Stanford
community and increase the visibility
of women's groups in this community."
Goals for the coalition include pro
grams and activities educating stu
dents about the links between race,
sexuality and womanhood, as well as
information sessions encouraging
women to take advantage of profes
sional opportunities and leadership
roles.
Nevins said she would like to see
the coalition become strong enough to
lobby the administration and student
government for political change.

Kight now. Women's Community
Center staff members are technically
agents of the University, which might
preclude opposition to University
policies.
"The Women's Coalition will apply
for special fees for select WVSOs,"
she said. "That way, instead of, say six
WVSOs all applying for special fees
individually, the coalition with apply
one time and get funding for all six."
Leaders of the movement toward a
coalition anticipate this transition in
the next one to two years. First, they
are working to restart the coalition
through the ASSU and the Office of
Student Activities.
Before the plan can be implement
ed, they need to submit budgets from
all participating women's groups and
host several activities before the end
of the year. Once the organization is
reactivated, its subsidiary groups will
be able to use the former coalition's
funds, which are still being held by the
ASSU, Nevins said.
While it is unclear when these funds
could potentially be tapped, Williams
said that the coalition is one of Wom
enspeak's top sources for alternative
funding.
"If special fees were no longer a vi
able funding option, this would great
ly jeopardize the future of the maga
zine," she said.
