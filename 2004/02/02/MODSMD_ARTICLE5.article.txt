# Fee refunds alarm Womenspeak
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Facing a staggering number of
ASSU special fee refund requests,
Womenspeak is rallying to find al
ternative funding. Without that
funding, the literary magazine may
not be able to produce issues in the
near future. Several other women's
groups have joined the cause, call
ing for the reestablishment of a
women's coalition to act as an um
brella organization.
Female student leaders said they
hope the potential coalition will
strengthen the campus women's
community, a group which they said
has been increasingly marginalized
in recent years.
While the overall refund rate
stands at 14 percent, 21 percent of
students requested a refund for
their Womenspeak special fees. Ac
cording to Senate Chair Josh Shipp,
a junior, the ASSU Appropriations
Committee predicts the overall rate
of refund requests will reach as high
as 29 percent for spring quarter,
which could cause the special fees
system to collapse. The committee
has vowed not to touch groups' cur
rent budgets, but they may tap some
reserve budgets if the groups have a

high number of refund requests.
"I think many of the students re
questing a refund on the Women
speak special fees may not realize
how crucial the ASSU funding is to
the publication of the magazine,"
said editor Jessica Williams, a ju
nior. "This financial contribution is
vital to sustaining the production of
the magazine."
According to Williams, Women
speak allows the Stanford commu
nity the unique opportunity to view
politics, racial consciousness and
sexuality through women's prose,
poetry and artwork.
In considering options for alter
native sources of funding, the edi
tors at Womenspeak collaborating
with peers at the Women's Commu
nity Center and other Women's
Voluntary Student Organizations
(WVSOs), proposed renewing the
Stanford Women's Coalition, a sin
gle body that could streamline fund
ing and programming for all
women's groups on campus.
"The Women's Coalition was
originally formed before the center
existed," said junior Jane Nevins, a
staff member at the center. "After
the center was opened, the
