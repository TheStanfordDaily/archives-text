# Campus group campaigns for variety of animal rights
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Animal Rights on the Farm, a new student
group advocating the fair treatment of animals,
held its first meeting last Tuesday. The group
hopes to raise student awareness of the subject,
despite an apparent lack of interest in such
groups in the past.
ARF, founded by freshman Ryan Vinyard,
freshman Ryan Schwartz and sophomore Claire
Wagenseil, aims to increase students' interest in
animal rights through activities such as anti-fur
campaigns against Neiman Marcus and educa
tional teach-ins. The group will also address is
sues ranging from animal testing at Stanford to
vegan and vegetarian lifestyles.
"We feel that Stanford is a pretty liberal
place, so we're sure there are other people out
there with interests in animal rights," Vinyard
said. "We thought we could get people involved
who otherwise wouldn't have if no one had or
ganized it."
The founders expressed optimism about the
level of interest students will show, despite the
fact that a club called Stanford Vegan Action,
which Wagenseil participated in, sputtered out
in the past.
"[Stanford Vegan Action] was centered
completely on veganism — that was cool but we

wanted to expand it to include all sorts of animal
rights interests instead of just the food and the
lifestyle," Wagenseil said. "A lot of people here
have cemented their ideas about a lot of things,
and the idea of changing your lifestyle wasn't
well received."
ARF has yet to take stances on controversial
issues such as animal testing for fear of alienat
ing students with moderate views.
"I think I'd listen to whatever they have to
say — it just depends on how they present it,"
said Connie Chen, a junior. "For example, I
think their protesting against a luxury item
like fur will be a worthy cause. On the other
hand, 1 don't personally think protesting
against animal testing is something I would
buy into, because animals are necessary to
conduct research on."
ARF plans on investigating the standards for
animal care used to evaluate Stanford labs.
Group representatives said they would focus on
Stanford's off-campus primate labs, in the hope
that it will interest more people.
"We don't really have an official stance [on
animal testing] right now," Vinyard said. "We
want to get everybody involved who has an in
terest, and we're pretty much open to anyone
with an opinion on animal testing. We've decid-
Ed to take a group opinion — we don't want
to exclude people by being too radical."
In order to make students more receptive
to their causes. ART members place educa
tion as one of their highest priorities. The
group plans to distribute literature in White
Plaza and have professors participate in
teach-ins that would potentially address is
sues such as ecology, conservation and ani
mal rights throughout history.
"I've talked to a few faculty who are big
on animal rights issues, and people usually
don't get that academic perspective," Wa
genseil said.
Despite the lack of interest shown in Stan
ford Vegan Action, the ARF founders said
the new group has gotten off to a good start.
Though only eight people attended the first
meeting, there are approximately 25 people
currently signed up on the group's e-mail
list.
"We want to stress that this is something
open to everyone," Wagenseil said. "You
can eat meat and still want animals to be
treated well in the world, you can wear
leather and still think it's wrong for people to
have fur factories. We just want people to
feel welcome to the cause."
