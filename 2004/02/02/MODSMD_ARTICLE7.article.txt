### ZACH DEMBO 
Last week's change in leadership will not
lead to a change in policies at The Stanford Re
view. Despite controversy surrounding opin
ions printed last year, new editor in chief
Stephen Cohen, a junior, plans to run the news
paper without a major overhaul.
"Business at The Review will be business as
usual," he said.
In an interview with The Daily, Cohen de
fended the reputation of The Review as a jour
nalistic, nonpartisan endeavor. He claimed that
it is unfair to characterize the newspaper as in
flammatory.
"The thing about The Review is it only hits
big press when it's controversial," he said.
"Most of the time the stories in The Review are
quite moderate. The people who complain
about The Review obviously don't read it regu
larly, or they would know this."
As for those stories that are controversial,
Cohen said that the writers generally know
when a certain story will provoke public outcry.
"We're not inept," he said. "We have some
sense of the social consequences of these sto
ries. We get a strong reputation because we

don't care who we offend, just about the jour
nalistic integrity and meaningful content in our
stories."
The Review was recently in the spotlight
with a controversial story comparing MEChA,
a Chicano / Latino student group, to the Ku
Klux Klan. Cohen was unapologetic about the
article.
"Offensiveness is in the eye of the behold
er," he said. "We aim not to please our reader
ship, but rather to publicize valuable informa
tion encompassing a wide range of views."
The article is rumored to have caused the
new ban on door-to-door delivery of periodi
cals in some dorms. Cohen said that he views
this ban as a direct response to the Review.
"All administration attempts to repress student
perspectives will fail, and this is clearly one of
them," he said. "It is not the administration's
job to censor speech."
Cohen added, "It's too soon to tell if the new
policy affects our readership or not. I will say
that we're not going to let any silly Residential
Education policy get in the way of expanding
