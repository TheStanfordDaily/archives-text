## Changing of the guard 
### SCOOP McSCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the offices of The Stanford Daily undergo a thorough clean
ing, it can only mean one thing: It's the start of a new volume. Furniture
is rearranged, posters are taken down and a new editor in chief steps in.
A little over two weeks ago, junior Brendan Marten was elected to be
The Daily's new frontman, and he has spent his time ever since ar
ranging a staff to work under him. He's put together a diverse group of
managing editors that he plans to fully blame if anything goes wrong in
the future.
Junior Mark Thoma, managing editor of Sports, served last volume
as managing of editor of News. Thoma puts on a masculine front by cov
ering men's basketball and writing a sports column, but at heart he's a
little girl, as evidenced by his passion for TV shows like "Newlyweds"
and eurodance music.
"He can't fail," said senior Vauhini Vara, who worked with Thoma
in the News department last volume. "He's been around here forever,
and anything that keeps him from going shopping is cool with me."
Vara beat perennially overdressed Thoma out of the "weirdest sense
of fashion" award by only a few votes.
First-year master's student Wayne Li will serve as managing editor
of Graphics. Li graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and is
now pursuing a two-year program in product design.
Some may think that the position is a step down for Li, who previ

ously worked as a transportation designer at Ford. While he worked on
the design for the Explorer, the redesigned Mustang and the new Ford
GT, he also collaborated on concept cars â€” although he isn't allowed to
talk about those projects.
"I'm really just looking forward to really pushing the direction of
Graphics at this paper," Li said. We've got a diverse, creative staff and
hopefully we can push each other to do better."
His only fear?
"Sooner or later, one of us is going to get majorly busted for musical
piracy," Li said in reference to The Daily's excessive use of Kazaa to DJ
its semiannual banquets.
Never fear, Wayne: We've all got lawyers.
Junior Anthony Ha will head up the News department. The urban
studies major said he is "incredibly excited and incredibly terrified" of
being managing editor of News.
"I'm excited because I think I can potentially run a really great News
department that keeps people informed," Ha said. "But then again, I
could also screw up."
Intermission editor Barrett Sheridan, a sophomore and longtime
friend of Ha, echoed those sentiments: "Yeah, he'll probably fuck it up
somehow."
Ha was mainly worried about spending all his time at The Daily's of
fice and failing all his classes. He did, however, voice concern over an
other aspect of The Daily's management.
"I'm a little bit worried about Brendan's meth problem," Ha said.

"There have been times where I've come in, he's on the floor, there's
crystals everywhere and I don't want to deal with that. I just want to
worry about putting out the paper and not illicit substances."
In the past. Ha has served as Intermission editor. News editor, Pro
jects editor and director of Staff Development.
"Personally, I think that Anthony's not tall enough to write for The
Daily," Sheridan said. "We're pretty selective in our height require
ments around here."
On the other hand, managing editor of Photo Matt Sayles, a senior,
easily surpasses The Daily's rigid restrictions on the vertically chal
lenged. Coming in at six-foot-two, the political science major has served
as Photo editor, director of Photo and Graphics editor during past vol
umes at The Daily.
"I'm looking forward to working with young photographers and pro
viding consistency in the Photo department," the libidinous Sayles said,
obviously a fan of Humbert Humbert.
Senior Anna Galan will serve as managing editor of Special Sections
but hopes that Senior Pub Night won't detract too much from her duties.
"I do enjoy 'dancing,'" Galan said.
Galan's biggest challenge will be getting people to read her sections:
Intermission, Innovation, Health and Features.
"I already miss the days when I edited the Opinions page and every
one hated me," Galan said. "Now, I've gotta worry about important
things, like who's going to take over Roxy Sass."
She added, "I really do like to dance."
