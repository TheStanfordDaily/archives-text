# ASSU posts names of refund applicants online
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
For the first time, the ASSU has post
ed online the names of students request
ing refunds on their special fees. This
decision has made public the names and
SUID numbers of individuals who have
joined the ever-growing ranks of those
who choose to withhold at least some of
their money from student groups and
organizations.
The decision to make these lists avail
able to the Stanford community has been
called into question because some claim it
violates the privacy of the students as well
as the student groups.
The ASSU has always distributed this
information to the financial managers of
student groups, according to ASSU Vice
President Joey Natoli, a junior. He said
that the information was made available
online this year for the sake of convenience
and efficiency.
Natoli claimed that student groups are
not obligated to provide services to stu

dents who request refunds.
While these lists have never been as
easily accessible to the public as they are
now, they have never been confidential,
Natoli added.
"We are constitutionally mandated to
release any data that is not proprietary,"
he said. "By law, [the data is] not protected
by privacy rights."
CEO of Stanford Student Enterprises
Kyle Alisharan stressed that the ASSU did
not intend to deter students from request
ing refunds by making the information
readily available.
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a se
nior, said that she would rather the names
be kept private.
"It's problematic either way because
students forward the information, even by
word-of-mouth," she said.
The real issue, according to Alisharan,
is eliminating free riders â€” students who
vote for special fees in the spring and then
ask for refunds.
"People are requesting refunds
from groups they work for,"he
said. "The refund system for the
ASSU lives and dies on the honor
code."
Still, many students feel uncom
fortable with the new policy.
"They could accomplish the same
task without publishing it online and

violating privacy," said freshman Ali
Batouli.
Junior Gabriel Martinez also pre
ferred the old method of distributing
names to the new one.
"It seems rational for lists to be
sent out to the groups, but not for
public consumption," Martinez said.
"That's extortion."
Another concern has been the in
tegrity of the student groups, espe
cially those with a high refund rate.
"It's humiliating that Women
speak received so little funding," said
junior Alicia Dantzker. "It's sad."

Figueroa noted, however, that
these groups could potentially use
the refund lists as an opportunity to
educate the student body about what
they contribute.
According to Natoli, a restructur
ing of the special fees system is
scheduled for the coming weeks due
to the high refund rate.
"I hope that in the future more
attention and thought will be put
into asking fora refund," Figueroa
said. "You should ask yourself,
Am I philosophically opposed to
this group?"'
