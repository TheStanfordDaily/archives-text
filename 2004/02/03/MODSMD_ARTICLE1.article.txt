# ASSU posts names of refund applicants online

### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
For the first time, the ASSU has post
ed online the names of students request
ing refunds on their special fees. This
decision has made public the names and
SUID numbers of individuals who have
joined the ever-growing ranks of those
who choose to withhold at least some of
their money from student groups and
organizations.
The decision to make these lists avail
able to the Stanford community has been
called into question because some claim it
violates the privacy of the students as well
as the student groups.
The ASSU has always distributed this
information to the financial managers of
student groups, according to ASSU Vice
President Joey Natoli, a junior. He said
that the information was made available
online this year for the sake of convenience
and efficiency.
Natoli claimed that student groups are
not obligated to provide services to stu

dents who request refunds.
While these lists have never been as
easily accessible to the public as they are
now, they have never been confidential,
Natoli added.
"We are constitutionally mandated to
release any data that is not proprietary,"
he said. "By law, [the data is] not protected
by privacy rights."
CEO of Stanford Student Enterprises
Kyle Alisharan stressed that the ASSU did
not intend to deter students from request
ing refunds by making the information
readily available.
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a se
nior, said that she would rather the names
be kept private.
"It's problematic either way because
students forward the information, even by
word-of-mouth," she said.
The real issue, according to Alisharan,
is eliminating free riders â€” students who
vote for special fees in the spring and then
ask for refunds.
