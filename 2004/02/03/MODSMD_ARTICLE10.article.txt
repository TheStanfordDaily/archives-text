## Orkut- strating the internet Introducing yet another social network 
### DEREK GAW 
Launched less than two weeks
ago, Orkut.com already boasts
22,000 members and is one of the
500 most visited sites on the In
ternet.
Sponsored by Google, Orkut
is a new online community Web
site designed for friends. Ac
cording to the Web site, its main
goal is to stimulate social life.
The community allows friends to
come together virtually, find
common interests, share rele
vant information and organize
social events.
Orkut joins the ranks of

dozens of similar social net
working services. There are now
so many that they have gained
the acronym YASN (yet another
social network).
But what differentiates Orkut
from the others? One of its al
lures is its exclusivity. A user
can only join when invited of a
current member. Some en
trepreneurial users have started
selling invitations on eßay for
$11.
Another advantage is its
speed. Fans of Orkut say it is
like Friendster, but faster, sim
pler to use and has more fea
tures. Registering and finding

friends is the main feature. Bor
rowing from Yahoo groups,
users can join, post messages
and establish communities for
their interests, ranging from
"Bus Nuts" to "Thucydides."
The Stanford community of
Orkut already has more than 485
members.
Unlike many online net
works, Orkut is less focused on
dating, downplaying the stigma
that typically accompanies this
kind of service. Its mission, as
stated on their Web site, is "to
increase the overall satisfac
tion of social life and provide
the necessary tools fora more

efficient and intimate environ
ment."
However, some claim that
Orkut offers nothing new, only
taking bits and pieces from exist
ing services. Others disapprove of
the unsophisticated relationship
system: somebody is either a
"friend" or not. It never distin
guishes between a one-time ac
quaintance, best friend and fami
ly. People can only rate each
other as trustworthy, sexy, and
cool, or become somebody's fan.
The service is the brainchild
of Orkut Buyukkokon, a current
Google employee and former
graduate of Stanford. The idea
originated as a personal project
at Google, which encourages its
employees to spend 20 percent
of their time on personal pro
jects. Buyukkokon's past pro
jects include Stanford's alumni
social network InCircle and its
undergraduate counterpart
Club Nexus.
So why is Google interested
in social networking? No rev
enue is generated since there
are currently no membership
fees and no advertisements on
the site. The search company
maintains that the social net
working Web site is simply the
personal project of one its em
ployees. Google is known for
investing in new ventures and
integrating them if successful.
One example of this is the
Google News service.
Some analysts also suggest
that Google may also be trying
to diversify while on the verge
of going IPO, that is, becom
ing a publicly traded compa
ny.
Another possibility is to
collect user information. The
service asks fora lot of profile
information when users regis
ter. Although the privacy pol
icy states that no information
will be rented, sold or shared
with a third party, it still gives
Google access to a wealth of
data for mining and analysis.
Finally, Google may be try
ing to gain leadership in the
market for online social net
working. E-mail and instant
messaging already have a
large base of established
users, and blogs continue to
gain momentum.
Despite the speculation on
the functionality and unique
ness of Orkut, many believe
that the site has the potential
to connect friends and even
people who would have other
wise never met.
Orkut is currently beta test
ing its service, which may be
down periodically for mainte
nance. To learn more visit
