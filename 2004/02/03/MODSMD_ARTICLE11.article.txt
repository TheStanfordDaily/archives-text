## Snails and fungi partying on an exploding star

Star on the verge of a breakdown
Eta Carinae, a massive star located 7,500 light years away, is on
the verge of instability. A study published last December showed
that the star is rotating at about 90 percent of the maximum speed
before a theoretical breakup. According to Roy van Boekel, lead
author from the European Space Agency, Eta Carinae is ejecting
about 500 Earth masses every year. That may be a lot, but the star
is 100 times more massive than the sun (also making it 5 million
times as luminous). The supernova could happen within 10,000 or
perhaps 20,000 years, which would be a dramatic event by any pro
portions. For comparison, in 1841 the star suffered a brief outburst

making it the second most luminous star in
Earth's night sky despite being so far away.
The fungus among us
A strain of deadly fungus that decimated Cal
ifornia's oaks has hit England. The disuse, nick
named "Sudden Oak Death," has caused great
concern. In the 1960s the Dutch elm disease
wiped out 20 million of the United Kingdom's 30
million elms. In California this fungus killed 80

percent of the tanoak trees. It is related to the pathogen that
caused the devastating potato blight in Ireland in the 1800s. Injec
tions of fungicide can alleviate symptoms but there is no cure for
the fatal disease. British officials are thus establishing stringent
measures of precaution to prevent further spread of the fungus.
Farmer snails
Researchers from Brown University and University of Georgia
recently reported that the snail Littoraria irrorata cultivates fun
gus for food. The snail creates long cuts in leaves and waits for fun
gus to colonize the wound. The snail also fertilizes the cut with its
droppings, thus increasing the amount of fungus. Once the plant
wound is filled with fungus the snail eats it. This is the first time bi
ologists have observed cultivation of edible fungus outside the in
sect world or in a marine environment. Ulrich Mueller, a special
ist in ant farming at the University of Texas at Austin, noted the
implications of the finding for understanding social relations in an
imals. This snail specie is nonsocial, which means farming may not
necessarily require cooperation among individuals.
Chemistry to stop counterfeit notes
The U.S. Department of the Treasury released new $20 dollar
bills in late 2002 to reduce counterfeit. One of the key features was
the value printed across the notes in color-shifting ink. Behind this
technology is complex chemistry. The ink itself does not change
colors but interference effects block out different wavelengths of
light. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has understandably
not released details. Essentially, such an ink is produced by vacu
um-coating a thin layer of metal onto a flexible polymer web. By
combining different types and sizes of metal flakes one can vary
the reflective property of the ink and thus achieve almost any
color.
Gravity Effect in an Asteroid
Astronomers in the United States and the Czech Republic have
observed a special gravitational effect in an asteroid for the first
time. This effect is called the Yarkovsky effect - it occurs because
the sun warms the asteroid disproportionately and the "afternoon
side" emits more heat than the "morning." There is a recoil effect,
which, over millions of years, can displace the asteroid from its
natural orbit. The team measured an asteroid nicknamed "Golev
ka" that has changed its orbit by 15km since 1991. Using this data
the researchers were also able to estimate its length at 530 meters
and mass at 210 billion kilograms.
Using DNA for assembly
Researchers have used DNA's self-assembly to build electron
ic devices from carbon nanotubes. Erez Braun and colleagues at
the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology polymerized (added
proteins) to DNA, producing nucleofilaments. Then, they
stretched the nucleofilaments onto single-walled carbon nan
otubes and voila, the DNA acted as a scaffold for the structure.
Braun told PhysicsWeb he plans to extend the work to allow more
complex logic circuit. "Carbon nanotubes will be one of the major
future building blocks of molecular electronics due to their small
dimensions and excellent electronic properties," he said.

Using DNA for assembly
Researchers have used DNA's self-assembly to build electron
ic devices from carbon nanotubes. Erez Braun and colleagues at
the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology polymerized (added
proteins) to DNA, producing nucleofilaments. Then, they
stretched the nucleofilaments onto single-walled carbon nan
otubes and voila, the DNA acted as a scaffold for the structure.
Braun told PhysicsWeb he plans to extend the work to allow more
complex logic circuit. "Carbon nanotubes will be one of the major
future building blocks of molecular electronics due to their small
dimensions and excellent electronic properties," he said.
