# Biodesign fellowship encourages innovation

Emergency, patient coming through! After
being rushed to the emergency room, a hemor
rhage is found in the patient's brain and he must
undergo thrombolytic therapy, a major surgical
procedure. But then the doctor whips out a new
minimally invasive device to stop local bleeding
inside the brain. In 10 minutes, the patient is
cured and walks out of the hospital the next day.
He begins work in a week.
Sound impossible? Not for four Biodesign In
novation fellows at Stanford who are currently
working on developing novel medical devices to
improve recovery time and success rate for cer
tain procedures in hospitals. Their work ranges
from developing assistive communication devices
for patients with severe cerebral palsy totools
that will determine if a brain aneurysm is likely to
burst.
The Biodesign Innovation program's mission
is to foster a dynamic educational environment
that will promote the advancement of medical
technology. The program views its first responsi
bility to the patients and their families. Their
well-being is the focal point of the work. Often
times these patients are the inspiration of the
technologies and devices created by the program.

The fellows work closely with the two directors
of the program. Director Paul Yocke, a Martha

Meier Weiland professor of
medicine and a professor of me
chanical engineering, is regarded
as a visionary in the field of medi
cal devices. Director Josh Make
hower, a consulting associate pro
fessor of medicine in the School of
Medicine, is known in the field as a
successful entrepreneur and inven
tor.
This year's fellows are Evan
Anderson, Jeremy Johnson, Kelley
Richardson, Amrish Walke and
Russell Woo.
Woo said that the directors
have become his mentors and have
given him insight into his own ca
reer development.
"Few programs offer such an
opportunity where students are im
mersed in an intense and reward
ing educational experience within
medical device design," he said.
The fellowship is a full-time 12
month commitment in which the
fellows develop the skills and

knowledge required to implement new biomedi
cal technologies. The fellows begin by identifying

the most impor
tant clinical
needs facing
healthcare
providers and
patients. With
this in mind, they
brainstorm inno
vative ideas and
concepts. To see
which concepts
are practical,
they assess the
market poten
tial.
Once fellows
have selected a
viable concept,
they begin
patent strategies
to protect their
intellectual
property. Next,
they prototype
solutions to get
feedback from

surgeons and patients. The last step involves
planning for implementation so that they can take
their solution to the real world.
In addition to developing their own medical
device, the fellovs coach the winter-spring se
quence elective cou MED 272A-Biodesign In
novation. During t!_» ,ourse, the fellows have
close interaction wLn students from the Graduate
School of Business, School of Medicine and
School of Engineering. At the end of the program
both the fellows and students present their inno
vations to an expert panel composed of the top
engineers, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and
scientists.
Walke says that it is rare for "engineers to
work on medical problems and for doctors to lead
engineering projects."
So what does this program mean in the big pic
ture? Walke hopes to work in startup environ
ments and so he finds this program as a stepping
stone toward that goal.
"This is a program where everything is hands
on and you get to create things you want," he said.
The program places an emphasis on taking the
initiative and having the freedom to make a dif
ference.
"You get to learn how to take problems in the
real world and go run with them," Woo said.
