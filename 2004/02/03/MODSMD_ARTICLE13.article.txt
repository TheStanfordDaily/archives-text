## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Tune in for Super Tuesday 
### 
Today is Super Tuesday, and seven
states — Arizona, Missouri,
Delaware, New Mexico, North
Dakota, Oklahoma and South
Carolina — are holding primaries or cau
cuses to determine which delegates will be
sent to the Democratic National Conven
tion, held in Boston at the end of July. There
are 269 delegates up for grabs today, mean
ing any candidate could well be on his way
to winning the nomination based on his
electoral showing. Today will be pivotal in
determining the direction of the remainder
of the primary season, so Stanford students
should pay close attention to how today's
voting turns out.
Regardless of one's political leanings,
Super Tuesday is an important event in this
year's political contest. The recent emphasis
on the perceived "electability" of a candidate
should cause Republicans to watch the pri
maries with special interest. The primaries'
outcome could determine how much of a
challenge President George W. Bush will
face in his campaign for reelection.
Democrats, meanwhile, should be watching
events unfold during this primary season in
order to better judge the candidates either in
California's primary on March 2 or during
their home state's primary if they intend to
submit an absentee ballot.
All students should be observing the can
didates now so that they can begin to decide
whom they would like to elect in November.
For many Stanford students, this election is a
milestone, in that it will be the first presiden
tial election in which they are eligible to vote.

All students, however, whether voting for
president for the first time or not, should re
alize that the privilege of this vote is a big re
sponsibility. Students owe it to themselves to
inform themselves to the best of their capa
bilities in order to arrive at the most educat
ed conclusion possible in November.
Many positive and negative aspects of a
candidate's personality come out during
this primary campaign season that may not
emerge during the regular campaign sea
son. Students should pay attention now so
that they can become aware of these traits.
Furthermore, candidates' platforms during
the primary season are often noticeably dif
ferent from their platforms after they have
been officially nominated. In their efforts to
woo the party core, candidates move far to
the left — in the case of Democrats — or
the right — in the case of Republicans — of
each party's respective spectrum.
Once nominated, candidates typically
then quickly move to the center in order to
appeal to the largest number of voters as pos
sible, often leaving the Democratic and Re
publican views on an issue indistinguishable.
Candidates also receive more money
upon being nominated and can afford to bet
ter filter their messages and influence the
media to portray them more favorably. Stu
dents should observe today's events and the
subsequent parts of the primary campaign
so that they can fully educate themselves on
the candidates, without solely relying on the
more moderate depictions of the nominated
candidates' personalities and platforms that
will come about later this fall.
