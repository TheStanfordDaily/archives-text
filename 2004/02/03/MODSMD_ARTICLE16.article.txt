# MINDFUL MUSINGS
## Schools evolving backwards 
### 
There are many things that
Americans are fanatic about:
sports (I bet you were watch
ing the Super Bowl yesterday in
stead of studying for those
midterms, right?), music, free
speech (or the idea of it, I guess) —
to name just a few. But there are a
few socially unaccepted fanati
cisms. Following the tragic events of
Sept. 11, people have become in
creasingly wary of religious fanati
cism, with most of the suspicion fo
cused on a smattering of religions
tenuously associated with terror
ism. To speak of one's religion
openly and enthusiastically isn't
done very often, at least on the lib
eral coasts. To do so is to verge on
proselytizing.
But religious fanaticism is alive
and thriving in the United States.
Many would proudly proclaim that
the United States keeps a careful
separation between church and
state, but 1 would argue that they
are walking around blindfolded and
wearing thick earplugs. Children re
cite the Pledge of Allegiance in
school, a proclamation to the nation
— and God. Even our dollar bills —
the ultimate symbol of our capitalis
tic economy — proclaim the na
tion's trust in the Lord.
Now, I have nothing against reli
gion. 1 believe that everyone should
have the opportunity to practice
whatever she / he believes in — or
doesn't believe in. But I do have an
issue when any one religion is
forced upon the citizens of a nation.
I wouldn't take things as far as the
French, who refuse to allow chil
dren to wear clothing or accessory
items with any religious significance
to school. (It is funny how they
never complained about the crosses
wore by Catholic children — it's
only when the Muslim girls wore
scarves that the entire controversy
against overt religious regalia
began.) If you want to come to

school all decked out in traditional
religious costume, then, in my opin
ion, by all means, do what you want.

But a govern
ment should not
impose religion
on anyone — and
public schools, of
all institutions,
should never blur
the line between
religion and edu
cation. Parents
who want to make
sure their kids are

surrounded by
one religion can send their children
to religious schools. We don't need
The Man to turn into The Priest.
Yet, alas, religious fanatics have in
filtrated our educational system. In
Georgia, state education officials have
decided to remove the word "evolu
tion" from middle school and high
school curricula. Not only that, but
some teachers now teach that earth was
created not too long ago... coinciden-
fitting the timing of creation ac
cording to the J udeo-Christian religious
tradition. The fact that a state education
system would chose to place its high
school students at such a great academ
ic disadvantage — these students are
not taught some of the basics in science
— shocked me greatly. But a greater
shock hit when I realized Georgia isn't
the first state to do this.
Imagine picking up a copy of The
New York Times and trying to un
derstand an article about the age of
the universe or trying to use archeo
logical dating techniques in a col
lege-level course, when all you were
taught in middle school was that the
earth was created a few thousand
years ago (based on a literal inter
pretation of the Old Testament.) Or
perhaps you wanted to take an ecol
ogy course your freshman year of
college and found yourself com
pletely lost when the professor
talked about the DNA similarities
among related species. Professors at

the University of Georgia have
complained that about half of the
students entering the university
have poor understanding of the the
ory of evolution.
Even if you felt strongly about re
ligion, would you, as a parent or an
educator, voluntarily disadvantage
your kids / students compared to the
rest of the world simply to preach
your beliefs? Some people believe
that both theories — J udeo-Chris
tian creationism and evolution —
should be presented to children, al
lowing the kids to decide for them
selves. But if we took that approach,
then shouldn't we be teaching kids
about every single creationist theory
ever believed by mankind, really
giving kids a full range of choices? I
don't see parents championing to
teach American Indian creation
myths instead of evolution.
I shudder to think that I
shouldn't take for granted that my
teachers taught me evolutionary
theory back in middle school. And
trust me, I attended catechism class
es as well and got my share of Bibli
cal theory, but at least each was
learned in the right context. Yes, I
was given the choice, but I wasn't
denied information at any time.
I know that many Stanford stu
dents will be involved in major cur
riculum design and educational leg
islation — or will one day be parents
— and I hope that they can reverse
the erroneous decisions made by
these school officials when it comes
to the education of future genera
tions. Already, the federal govern
ment pinches pennies when it comes
to the education of today's kids —
let's at least make sure that students
are given a complete education with
whatever funds we have left.
