## The 						special fee boom and bust 
### STEVE YELDERMAN IAN SPIRO 
Anyone who entertains even the
slightest concern for student life on
this campus could not help but wince
at last week's special fees article ("Spe
cial fees refund requests double;
ASSU program faces bankruptcy,"
Jan. 27). In the last 20 years, special
fees have become the lifeblood of the
campus culture, funding everything
from cultural groups to student publi
cations to non-varsity sports teams. It
would be hard to find a single student
on this campus whose life is not affect
ed by a group that receives special fees.
And yet, last week's article reports
that students are requesting refunds of
their special fees monies at unprece
dented rates. Has the student body,
which tacitly approved this year's cost
of special fees by majority vote just last
April, reneged on its commitment to
supporting vibrant and diverse ex
tracurricular activities? As a collective
student body, we think not, but at the
individual level, perhaps.
As students ourselves who have re
funded a portion of our special fees
money in the past, we claim that there
are two reasons for the rise in the refund
rate: the perceived abundance of funds
and the perceived isolation from conse
quence. While these perceptions may
have been based on truth in the past, as
of today we can officially pronounce the
special fees refund windfall season over.
It is dishonest to say that the spike in
special fees refund requests occurred
last quarter. Last quarter's increase
merely continued the trend established
in the 2002-03 academic year. Accord
ing to data published in The Daily, the
single largest jump in refund requests
came between fall and winter quarters
last year—from 6.6 percent to 13.3 per
cent. So. the current situation the ASSU
now faces was not caused simply by this
year's increase in special fees. The ques
tion we have to ask is, "What happened
last November or December that
prompted the sudden increase in special
fees refund requests?"
Fortunately, the answer to that
question lies within the archives of
this very newspaper. The astute read
er may remember The Daily's article
("ASSU reveals $300,000 surplus,"
Nov. 6), that said the ASSU had an
extra $350,000 to $400,000 sitting
around with no apparent purpose be
cause not as many students had re
funded their special fees as predicted.

For the next week, or so, the ASSU
and The Daily entertained countless
idle daydreams about what could
possibly be done with an excess of
such a great amount. For their part,
students eagerly awaited winter quar
ter so they could claim their part of
the surplus by refunding their special
fees in record numbers.
We hope that this public relations
blunder will be self-correcting. Now that
the student body has (quite rightly) ex
ploited the surplus to the point of nearly
bankrupting the system, we expect that
our honorable peers will kindly recog
nize that the proverbial bubble has been
proverbially busted. We agree that there
was absolutely nothing shameful about
taking from the ASSU back in the glory
days of spring of last year. But at this
point, it might be appropriate for anyone
refunding his money to look in the mir
ror and ask, "Do I really need this
money? Am 1 as close to going bankrupt
as is the ASSU special fees system?"
The other prong in the special fees
refund attack is the notion that taking
money away from a group does not af
fect anyone: neither the target student
group nor the student requesting the re
fund. In the past, this was overwhelm
ingly the case. The process of request
ing a fee refund on the Internet was ex
tremely convenient and virtually
anonymous. The target student group
was not deprived of any funding as a re
sult of this refund request, making the
group unlikely to pursue action against
refunding individuals. Even if the group
desired to pursue those requesting re
funds, the only information they could
obtain from the ASSU was a list of stu
dent ID numbers. For practical purpos
es, this was basically useless.
The isolation from consequence
that resulted in this guilt-free refund
system was so pervasive that students
even began to take money away from
groups that they fully supported. As ed
itors of the Chaparral, we both contem
plated and then decided against taking
money away from our own magazine.
Junior Piotr Kosicki, who is now paid to
serve as director of the ASSU Publica
tions Board and to look out for the in
terests of all student publications, has
historically claimed a refund for his
Chaparral special fee. Junior Brendan
Marten, editor in chief of The Stanford
Daily, took his money from us too, and
also got a refund from the organization
that is currently employing him: The
Stanford Daily. When confronted,
Marten explained that he refunded his

DaiJy money as a symbolic protest over
the current special fees system. Howev
er, he conceded that he refunded his
money in good conscience only be
cause he knew it would not affect the
organization's finances.
We mention specific names firstly
because the individuals are members
of the publications community and
will not protest this ironic expose, but
secondly because it demonstrates a
critical change in the special fees sys
tem: Now all requests for special fees
refunds are made publicly available to
the entire Stanford community. You
can view them at http://refunds.stan
ford.edu/reports. The ASSU was cor
rect in its decision to make this infor
mation public. It is much harder to feel
OK about refusing to support the or
ganization of your friend, classmate or
peer when that person gets to know
that you are refusing.
To use our organization as an exam
ple, we can go to that Web site and view
a thirteen-page list of the students who
requested a refund of their Chaparral
special fees fall quarter. When we see
your name on this list, we perceive it as
your way of saying, "I don't like your
magazine or what you add to the diver
sity of Stanford life." If you are on this
list, we will avoid pandering to your per
sonal sense of humor, and certainly will
not allow you to attend our weekly
meetings — we cannot support you if
you don't support us. In an ideal world,
every special fees group could enact a
tangible consequence for students
choosing to withdraw their funds.
Of course, for some of our peer stu
dent groups who don't offer a physical
product, this is virtually impossible.
Furthermore, as this bankruptcy situa
tion demonstrates, the only way to truly
support any one group is to support
them all. While the decision to with
draw some spare change from a given
group might seem to affect no one, the
practice is in fact devastating to every
one. So we would like to reiterate our
earlier request: Think very carefully
about the special fees refunds that you
request. We need to give the system an
other chance. Please ask yourself if pay
ing $88 a quarter is not too much to
keep Stanford an interesting place.
