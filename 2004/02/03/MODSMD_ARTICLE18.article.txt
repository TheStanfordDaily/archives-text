# RECCHIA'S REMARKS
## Students wanting to save the world should consider Great Donation 
### 
Prior to receiving my admission let
ter, I would often read articles about
Stanford students who created non
profit organizations, engaged in
groundbreaking research and brought
democracy to Luxembourg and Micronesia.
I may be getting a few of the details wrong,
but one thing was clear: Stanford kids were
überhuman. I made the natural assumption
that most had lightning-shaped scars, spider
senses or some bizarre mix of the two. As
for me, I was having enough trouble getting
my shoes on the right feet every morning.
Nine months later, I was a Stanford stu
dent. I quickly learned that there were no
superpowers required. If you have an idea,
old Papa Stanford will supply the resources
to help you achieve it. So you want to vol
unteer? The Haas Center can set you up
with an organization that matches your in
terests. Interested in research? The faculty
is world-class in every department, and pro
fessors are often willing to have undergrad
uates help out with their projects. Inspired
to start a company? Entrepreneurial class
es, "how-to" workshops and speakers

abound on campus.
But there was a problem — I was still

stuck in my old habits. I
wasn't doing what I really
wanted to do. I wasn't
writing, volunteering, pur
suing my own ideas or
doing much at all other
than schoolwork, sleep
and hanging out in Wilbur
Dining. It's not that the
opportunity to do greater
things wasn't available; I
just wasn't taking advan-

tage of it. Of course I
wanted to save the world. Yet, enclosed in
the proverbial "Stanford Bubble," it didn't
look like the world needed any help.
Then I went to Campbell Village in West
Oakland.
This minor adventure was due to Frosh
Project, a community service retreat spon
sored by Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship
and World Impact. It gave me a chance to
see that only a few miles beyond this Utopia
of palm trees and Spanish Mission-style ar

chitecture, there was a world of abandoned
warehouses, broken homes and poverty,
where shootings were more common than
job openings and the only role models were
drug dealers. In the course of serving food,
donating clothing and openly discussing the
issues that face this community, we discov
ered that these were regular human beings
— we saw pieces of ourselves trapped in a
seemingly hopeless situation.
But I also realized that for most of the
students there, this was no token almsgiving
or "feel good" volunteerism; these students
really cared, and their compassion was ap
preciated. In a world so full of hypocrisy,
these students were taking Christ's message
to heart. Like many Stanford students, they
wanted to change the world in more than
just this limited way. But how should they?
With the demands of school, sleep and find
ing time to socialize, our ability to make any
substantial change may seem limited. One
man can only do so much.
Fortunately, Stanford senior Pat
Bomhack never settled for such excuses.
During Bomhack's junior year, the ASSU

Treasury announced that they had a little
extra money — and by a little, they meant
$350,000. Rather than accept any of the ini
tial proposals, he got together a six-person
group to convince the ASSU to use these
funds in a new, unprecedented way: to help
the truly needy with a "great donation" to
charity.
The resulting group — Students for the
Great Donation — worked during the
school year and summer, talking to non
profits and garnering outside support be
fore formally presenting their idea to the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate this year.
When the ASSU announced that the sur
plus had become a near-deficit, Students for
the Great Donation was devastated. Still,
they didn't give up. Their newest initiative
calls fora small special fees increase of three
dollars per person. If enough students vote
"yes," the Great Donation will raise over
$18,000 every year for selected charities.
"1 think most students realize how privi
leged we are," Bomhack said. "It's really
the pursuit of our educational institutions to
teach us how to give something back, not

just to Stanford, but to people outside our
immediate community."
Therefore, seeing as this may be my final
column for The Daily, 1 'd like to offer some
last grandfatherly advice: You can make a
difference. Take advantage of all Stanford
has to offer, and do something truly great
with it. Maybe there's been an idea brewing
in the back of your mind. Maybe you've al
ways wanted to start that student organiza
tion, campaign for that political figure or
address that social need. Maybe you've al
ways wanted to work for that crazy start-up,
talk to that guy or girl or play rugby in Wal-
Mart. Or maybe you just want to do some
thing "great," but haven't taken the time to
think about what that would mean for you.
You have the ability. You have the re
sources. Do it now. You may never get the
chance again.

my shoes on the right feet every morning.
Nine months later, I was a Stanford stu
dent. I quickly learned that there were no
superpowers required. If you have an idea,
old Papa Stanford will supply the resources
to help you achieve it. So you want to vol
unteer? The Haas Center can set you up
with an organization that matches your in
terests. Interested in research? The faculty
is world-class in every department, and pro
fessors are often willing to have undergrad
uates help out with their projects. Inspired
to start a company? Entrepreneurial class
es, "how-to" workshops and speakers

abound on campus.
But there was a problem — I was still

stuck in my old habits. I
wasn't doing what I really
wanted to do. I wasn't
writing, volunteering, pur
suing my own ideas or
doing much at all other
than schoolwork, sleep
and hanging out in Wilbur
Dining. It's not that the
opportunity to do greater
things wasn't available; I
just wasn't taking advan-

tage of it. Of course I
wanted to save the world. Yet, enclosed in
the proverbial "Stanford Bubble," it didn't
look like the world needed any help.
Then I went to Campbell Village in West
Oakland.
This minor adventure was due to Frosh
Project, a community service retreat spon
sored by Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship
and World Impact. It gave me a chance to
see that only a few miles beyond this Utopia
of palm trees and Spanish Mission-style ar

chitecture, there was a world of abandoned
warehouses, broken homes and poverty,
where shootings were more common than
job openings and the only role models were
drug dealers. In the course of serving food,
donating clothing and openly discussing the
issues that face this community, we discov
ered that these were regular human beings
— we saw pieces of ourselves trapped in a
seemingly hopeless situation.
But I also realized that for most of the
students there, this was no token almsgiving
or "feel good" volunteerism; these students
really cared, and their compassion was ap
preciated. In a world so full of hypocrisy,
these students were taking Christ's message
to heart. Like many Stanford students, they
wanted to change the world in more than
just this limited way. But how should they?
With the demands of school, sleep and find
ing time to socialize, our ability to make any
substantial change may seem limited. One
man can only do so much.
Fortunately, Stanford senior Pat
Bomhack never settled for such excuses.
During Bomhack's junior year, the ASSU

Treasury announced that they had a little
extra money — and by a little, they meant
$350,000. Rather than accept any of the ini
tial proposals, he got together a six-person
group to convince the ASSU to use these
funds in a new, unprecedented way: to help
the truly needy with a "great donation" to
charity.
The resulting group — Students for the
Great Donation — worked during the
school year and summer, talking to non
profits and garnering outside support be
fore formally presenting their idea to the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate this year.
When the ASSU announced that the sur
plus had become a near-deficit, Students for
the Great Donation was devastated. Still,
they didn't give up. Their newest initiative
calls fora small special fees increase of three
dollars per person. If enough students vote
"yes," the Great Donation will raise over
$18,000 every year for selected charities.
"1 think most students realize how privi
leged we are," Bomhack said. "It's really
the pursuit of our educational institutions to
teach us how to give something back, not

just to Stanford, but to people outside our
immediate community."
Therefore, seeing as this may be my final
column for The Daily, 1 'd like to offer some
last grandfatherly advice: You can make a
difference. Take advantage of all Stanford
has to offer, and do something truly great
with it. Maybe there's been an idea brewing
in the back of your mind. Maybe you've al
ways wanted to start that student organiza
tion, campaign for that political figure or
address that social need. Maybe you've al
ways wanted to work for that crazy start-up,
talk to that guy or girl or play rugby in Wal-
Mart. Or maybe you just want to do some
thing "great," but haven't taken the time to
think about what that would mean for you.
You have the ability. You have the re
sources. Do it now. You may never get the
chance again.

include, among other things, to play rugby in
Wal-Mart. If there's any way he can help

Prior to receiving my admission let
ter, I would often read articles about
Stanford students who created non
profit organizations, engaged in
groundbreaking research and brought
democracy to Luxembourg and Micronesia.
I may be getting a few of the details wrong,
but one thing was clear: Stanford kids were
überhuman. I made the natural assumption
that most had lightning-shaped scars, spider
senses or some bizarre mix of the two. As
for me, I was having enough trouble getting
my shoes on the right feet every morning.
Nine months later, I was a Stanford stu
dent. I quickly learned that there were no
superpowers required. If you have an idea,
