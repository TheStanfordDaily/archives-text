# Spencer becomes a man through the lives of bigger men
## 
### 
I don t really know where to begin. I don't
know how to convey what I'm thinking right
now. I know no possible way to put words on
paper, no clue as to what I 'm supposed to say.
But here's a start.
Right now, I'm in a youth hostel in Paris,
France, in the Bastille District. My room is
stereotypically unclean; there is mold in the
shower, bedsheets that have probably never been
washed and it all just smells like those Sterno can
dles they use to warm up elementary school
lunches — the kind that makes the mashed pota
toes taste like the lasagna.
It is somewhere around 5:10 a.m., Paris time.
I 'd tell you the actual name of the time zone, but
I blatantly don't care.
I picked up a taxi about 15 minutes ago as I was
walking back from the sports bar / pub / base
ment I was in because I realized I was not in any

state to navigate my way back
home.
Not after what just happened.
You see, the Patriots just
won the Super Bowl and I am
still in shock.
I didn't drink a drop of alco
hol, yet I feel hung over. My
head is throbbing, my ears are
ringing, my feet and hands are
swollen and my forehead just
plain hurts. I feel like I've been

punched in the knee, stomach, ribs and back,
mended back to health by a lovely woman
named Laurence, only to be drop-kicked to the
floor yet again by what I was seeing on a big
screen TV.
You feel dumped by your girlfriend, but then
taken back just minutes later to make mad pas
sionate love with her. But just as you begin to
enjoy her again, she surreptitiously whispers
that she is dating a French man named Del
homme, and you are "so two years ago." But just
as she hops into her car with her new Cinderel
la-story French lover, you let it all go and just de
stroy that pompous young kid, dropping a 41-
yarder on him that just seems cruel and un
apologetic.
And you have satisfaction. You're not really
sure if you've won, and you certainly aren't en
tirely proud of what you've done or how you've
done it, but you have beaten your enemy, and
that's all that matters.
There were times during the game when I was
deathly silent, times when I was pumping my fists
in total glory, times when 1 had to whisper so the
gods of karma wouldn't hold my blasphemous
predictions against me.
And it had to be that way. It had to start out as
a defensive battle. Had to have a chess-like open
ing quarter to set up the final blow. Had to have
three potential game-winning drives. Had to have
Adam (we're on a first name basis now for sure)
miss his first two 30-yarders, just to give him as
much pressure and self-doubt as possible with
nine seconds left.
But it had everything: trick plays that worked,
trick plays that bombed, controversial calls,
linebackers catching touchdowns, the play ac
tion, the draw play, the long ball, dropped punts,
dropped pants, exposed nipples and the field
goal.
But it's quiet now as I sit on a windowsill out
side room 13, and an angry French door guard has
just told me to go to bed.
But 1 can't.
"I'm not tired," I tell him. "Not yet." But he
doesn't understand, just wishing me a good night
as he throws his mop into the janitor's closet with
arrogance and scorn.
But he couldn't possibly understand — I have
just seen the greatest Super Bowl of my lifetime.
I am a small man. I am a timid man, a weak
man and a shy man. Tonight I have seen large
men stand and fall and not for glory, not for for
tune, not for fame. I have seen large men put
their faith in their own self-confidence to say, "I
am a bigger man than my enemy. I will beat
him."
I'm sorry for the overdramatization, but I beg
you, spare none here. Every man on that field
said those words to himself. Perhaps they said it
as a team to achieve a common goal, perhaps as
individuals to accomplish personal assignments,
perhaps it was never said out loud at all. But I
have seen two teams make that promise to them
selves and I have seen one group of large men up
hold that promise.
Through the shock, sweat, and swelling,
through the now 6 a.m. freezing Parisian air,
through the comfortably enveloping malaise ex
uded through my rag-filled pillow, I understand
what I have to write.
Sport is the domination of one body over an
other. One woman, one man, one team, whatev
er. And after witnessing the greatest example of
this definition in my life, I am no longer just a boy,
a sarcastic and crude fraternity member, a junior
majoring in American Studies or even a semi-se
rious scholar with aspirations of going to law
school.
In some weird French way, this game changed
me. Maybe it was because I never had a coming
of-age-experience. Maybe it's because I was
alone in a strange and mythical land. Maybe it's
because my dad is from New England.
Whatever it was. after Adam Vinatieri split
those uprights, for the first time. I really did feel
like a man.

Spencer Porter, a junior, is a self-described
corny and melodramatic young kid, but he
blatantly doesn t care. He's way too wrapped
up in the moment. His editor entreats you to
snap him out of his soap opera at

tion, the draw play, the long ball, dropped punts,
dropped pants, exposed nipples and the field
goal.
But it's quiet now as I sit on a windowsill out
side room 13, and an angry French door guard has
just told me to go to bed.
But 1 can't.
"I'm not tired," I tell him. "Not yet." But he
doesn't understand, just wishing me a good night
as he throws his mop into the janitor's closet with
arrogance and scorn.
But he couldn't possibly understand — I have
just seen the greatest Super Bowl of my lifetime.
I am a small man. I am a timid man, a weak
man and a shy man. Tonight I have seen large
men stand and fall and not for glory, not for for
tune, not for fame. I have seen large men put
their faith in their own self-confidence to say, "I
am a bigger man than my enemy. I will beat
him."
I'm sorry for the overdramatization, but I beg
you, spare none here. Every man on that field
said those words to himself. Perhaps they said it
as a team to achieve a common goal, perhaps as
individuals to accomplish personal assignments,
perhaps it was never said out loud at all. But I
have seen two teams make that promise to them
selves and I have seen one group of large men up
hold that promise.
Through the shock, sweat, and swelling,
through the now 6 a.m. freezing Parisian air,
through the comfortably enveloping malaise ex
uded through my rag-filled pillow, I understand
what I have to write.
Sport is the domination of one body over an
other. One woman, one man, one team, whatev
er. And after witnessing the greatest example of
this definition in my life, I am no longer just a boy,
a sarcastic and crude fraternity member, a junior
majoring in American Studies or even a semi-se
rious scholar with aspirations of going to law
school.
In some weird French way, this game changed
me. Maybe it was because I never had a coming
of-age-experience. Maybe it's because I was
alone in a strange and mythical land. Maybe it's
because my dad is from New England.
Whatever it was. after Adam Vinatieri split
those uprights, for the first time. I really did feel
like a man.

I don t really know where to begin. I don't
know how to convey what I'm thinking right
now. I know no possible way to put words on
paper, no clue as to what I 'm supposed to say.
But here's a start.
Right now, I'm in a youth hostel in Paris,
France, in the Bastille District. My room is
stereotypically unclean; there is mold in the
shower, bedsheets that have probably never been
washed and it all just smells like those Sterno can
dles they use to warm up elementary school
lunches — the kind that makes the mashed pota
toes taste like the lasagna.
It is somewhere around 5:10 a.m., Paris time.
I 'd tell you the actual name of the time zone, but
I blatantly don't care.
I picked up a taxi about 15 minutes ago as I was
walking back from the sports bar / pub / base
ment I was in because I realized I was not in any

state to navigate my way back
home.
Not after what just happened.
You see, the Patriots just
won the Super Bowl and I am
still in shock.
I didn't drink a drop of alco
hol, yet I feel hung over. My
head is throbbing, my ears are
ringing, my feet and hands are
swollen and my forehead just
plain hurts. I feel like I've been

punched in the knee, stomach, ribs and back,
mended back to health by a lovely woman
named Laurence, only to be drop-kicked to the
floor yet again by what I was seeing on a big
screen TV.
You feel dumped by your girlfriend, but then
taken back just minutes later to make mad pas
sionate love with her. But just as you begin to
enjoy her again, she surreptitiously whispers
that she is dating a French man named Del
homme, and you are "so two years ago." But just
as she hops into her car with her new Cinderel
la-story French lover, you let it all go and just de
stroy that pompous young kid, dropping a 41-
yarder on him that just seems cruel and un
apologetic.
And you have satisfaction. You're not really
sure if you've won, and you certainly aren't en
tirely proud of what you've done or how you've
done it, but you have beaten your enemy, and
that's all that matters.
There were times during the game when I was
deathly silent, times when I was pumping my fists
in total glory, times when 1 had to whisper so the
gods of karma wouldn't hold my blasphemous
predictions against me.
And it had to be that way. It had to start out as
a defensive battle. Had to have a chess-like open
ing quarter to set up the final blow. Had to have
three potential game-winning drives. Had to have
Adam (we're on a first name basis now for sure)
miss his first two 30-yarders, just to give him as
much pressure and self-doubt as possible with
nine seconds left.
But it had everything: trick plays that worked,
trick plays that bombed, controversial calls,
linebackers catching touchdowns, the play ac
tion, the draw play, the long ball, dropped punts,
dropped pants, exposed nipples and the field
goal.
