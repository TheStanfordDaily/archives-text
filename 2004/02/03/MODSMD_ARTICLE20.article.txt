## Cardinal takes back Pac-10 lead 
### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
held onto its top spot in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence standings after a home sweep of the Wash
ington schools, but the wins may have come at a
price.
The Cardinal improved to 17-3 overall, 10-1
in the Pac-10, after defeating the University of
Washington 85-59 on Thursday and Washington
State 91-67 on Saturday. Stanford dominated its
first game after its loss to Southern California the
previous weekend, shooting a remarkable 53.1
percent from the floor and putting to rest any
suspicions that the team may have been suffering
from a slump.
Though the Cardinal's offense dazzled, it
was the team's inspired defense that set the
game's tone. The Huskies entered the game as
the conference's highest-scoring team, but Stan
ford held last year's Pac-10 Player of the Year,
senior guard Giuliana Mendiola, to 15 points,
about four less than her average, and harassed
senior center Andrea Lalum into l-of-7 shoot
ing.
The one major bleak spot of the contest
came as freshman center Kristen Newlin went
down hard on her right knee in the second half
and left the game. Newlin, who scored seven
points before her injury, did not return Satur
day and her status remains uncertain, pending
the results of an MRI.
Stanford's win over Washington State (5-15,
1-10) marked the Cardinal's 38th straight win
over the Cougars. Senior forward Nicole Powell
was one rebound shy of her seventh career
triple-double, tallying 15 points, 10 assists, and
nine boards to lead her team.
Stanford made 15 3-pointers in the win, just
one off the school record, thanks in large part to
junior guard Susan Borchardt who knocked
down four treys and sophomore reserve Krista
Rappahahn, who tallied three of her own. The
sweep of the Washington schools ensured the

Cardinal sole possession of first-place in the
Pac-10 as it prepares to travel to second-place
Arizona this weekend.
The Washington schools split their road trip
in California, losing to Stanford but posting wins
over California. Washington State's 64-59 win
over the Bears marked its first conference road
victory since 2001.
Arizona (16-5,8-2) had its four-game winning
streak snapped during a road loss to Arizona
State this past week. The Sun Devils held off a
late rally, winning 68-60. They improved to 13-6
overall and 7-3 in conference play to sit one game
behind third place USC. Arizona State was led
by Pac-10 Player of the Week, junior guard
Kylan Loney, who scored a career-high 32 points
on 9-of-14 shooting, including five 3-pointers.
The loss dropped the Wildcats to second place in
the Pac-10.
The Oregon schools headed down to south
ern California last weekend in a series of games
that left everyone with one win apiece.
The Women of Troy (11-8, 8-3) followed up
their upset win over Stanford with a 73-66 loss to
Oregon State (11-9,5-6). Despite 19 points from
senior forward Ebony Hoffman, USC was un
able to withstand a prolific Beaver offense.
Oregon State shot 53.4 percent from the field,
including a remarkable 75.0 percent from be
hind the arc, and saw four players hit double
digits in the win.
USC responded by winning against Oregon
(11-10,3-8) on Saturday thanks to the talents of
freshman forward Jamie Funn, who posted her
first career double-double by notching 13
points and 11 boards. USC led by as many as 18
points before winning 71-56.
UCLA (10-10, 5-6) responded in kind,
dropping its first game of the series to Oregon,
61-55, before dominating Oregon State, 91-58.
The Ducks came out strong against UCLA
on Thursday, led by sophomore guard Chelsea
Wagner and junior center Andrea Bills. Wagn-

er led her team with 17 points, including 15 from down
town, while Bills posted a double-double on the
evening, scoring 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting while
pulling down 11 rebounds. The Ducks pushed a 29-18
first-half advantage after the Bruins were held to a sea
son-low shooting percentage (25 percent).
UCLA's offensive misery was forgotten by Saturday,

thanks to freshman guard Noelle Quinn. Quinn posted
consecutive double-doubles this weekend, scoring a ca
reer-high 24 points and pulling down 14 rebounds in the
win over the Beavers.
Three UCLA players scored at least 20 points as
sophomore guard Nikki Blue scored 23 points, dished out
six assists and made seven steals. Sophomore guard Lisa
Willis got in on the action, tallying 21 points, including
five 3-pointers.
The first weekend of the conference's second half of
play demonstrated that nothing is truly certain in the Pac

a week from now.

er led her team with 17 points, including 15 from down
town, while Bills posted a double-double on the
evening, scoring 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting while
pulling down 11 rebounds. The Ducks pushed a 29-18
first-half advantage after the Bruins were held to a sea
son-low shooting percentage (25 percent).
UCLA's offensive misery was forgotten by Saturday,

thanks to freshman guard Noelle Quinn. Quinn posted
consecutive double-doubles this weekend, scoring a ca
reer-high 24 points and pulling down 14 rebounds in the
win over the Beavers.
Three UCLA players scored at least 20 points as
sophomore guard Nikki Blue scored 23 points, dished out
six assists and made seven steals. Sophomore guard Lisa
Willis got in on the action, tallying 21 points, including
five 3-pointers.
The first weekend of the conference's second half of
play demonstrated that nothing is truly certain in the Pac
-10 right now. With Stanford and Arizona facing off this
weekend and the Los Angeles schools headed up to
Washington, there's no telling what the standings will be
a week from now.
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
held onto its top spot in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence standings after a home sweep of the Wash
ington schools, but the wins may have come at a
price.
The Cardinal improved to 17-3 overall, 10-1
in the Pac-10, after defeating the University of
Washington 85-59 on Thursday and Washington
State 91-67 on Saturday. Stanford dominated its
first game after its loss to Southern California the
previous weekend, shooting a remarkable 53.1
percent from the floor and putting to rest any
suspicions that the team may have been suffering
from a slump.
Though the Cardinal's offense dazzled, it
was the team's inspired defense that set the
game's tone. The Huskies entered the game as
the conference's highest-scoring team, but Stan
ford held last year's Pac-10 Player of the Year,
senior guard Giuliana Mendiola, to 15 points,
about four less than her average, and harassed
senior center Andrea Lalum into l-of-7 shoot
ing.
The one major bleak spot of the contest
came as freshman center Kristen Newlin went
down hard on her right knee in the second half
and left the game. Newlin, who scored seven
points before her injury, did not return Satur
day and her status remains uncertain, pending
the results of an MRI.
Stanford's win over Washington State (5-15,
1-10) marked the Cardinal's 38th straight win
over the Cougars. Senior forward Nicole Powell
was one rebound shy of her seventh career
triple-double, tallying 15 points, 10 assists, and
nine boards to lead her team.
Stanford made 15 3-pointers in the win, just
one off the school record, thanks in large part to
junior guard Susan Borchardt who knocked
down four treys and sophomore reserve Krista
Rappahahn, who tallied three of her own. The
sweep of the Washington schools ensured the

Cardinal sole possession of first-place in the
Pac-10 as it prepares to travel to second-place
Arizona this weekend.
The Washington schools split their road trip
in California, losing to Stanford but posting wins
over California. Washington State's 64-59 win
over the Bears marked its first conference road
victory since 2001.
Arizona (16-5,8-2) had its four-game winning
streak snapped during a road loss to Arizona
State this past week. The Sun Devils held off a
late rally, winning 68-60. They improved to 13-6
overall and 7-3 in conference play to sit one game
behind third place USC. Arizona State was led
by Pac-10 Player of the Week, junior guard
Kylan Loney, who scored a career-high 32 points
on 9-of-14 shooting, including five 3-pointers.
The loss dropped the Wildcats to second place in
the Pac-10.
The Oregon schools headed down to south
ern California last weekend in a series of games
that left everyone with one win apiece.
The Women of Troy (11-8, 8-3) followed up
their upset win over Stanford with a 73-66 loss to
Oregon State (11-9,5-6). Despite 19 points from
senior forward Ebony Hoffman, USC was un
able to withstand a prolific Beaver offense.
Oregon State shot 53.4 percent from the field,
including a remarkable 75.0 percent from be
hind the arc, and saw four players hit double
digits in the win.
USC responded by winning against Oregon
(11-10,3-8) on Saturday thanks to the talents of
freshman forward Jamie Funn, who posted her
first career double-double by notching 13
points and 11 boards. USC led by as many as 18
points before winning 71-56.
UCLA (10-10, 5-6) responded in kind,
dropping its first game of the series to Oregon,
61-55, before dominating Oregon State, 91-58.
