# Huskies can't keep pace with Card gymnastics
## 
### KRISTEN BELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Huskies may work well in blizzards, but they
couldn't handle the flurry that hit Burnham Pavil
ion Friday night at the women's gymnastics meet.
Senior co-captains Caroline Fluhrer — known as
Flurry by her teammates — and Lindsay Wing
led the No. 7 Cardinal (5-1,2-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) to a decisive 197.4 to 195.475 victory over
the No. 11 Washington Huskies (5-2,2-2).
Fluhrer won the all-around with a 39.55 and
performed career-high routines on the bal
ance beam and the floor exercise. Wing also
posted career highs on the balance beam and
the uneven bars and captured a close second in
the all-around with a 39.5.
Wing delivered a flawless performance on
the balance beam, scoring a perfect 10.0 for
the second time in her career. Perfection is al
ways the goal in gymnastics, but it is rarely
achieved — only three Stanford gymnasts
have scored a 10.0 in the past four years. Wing,
the three-time reigning Pac-10 Champion, is
the only Stanford gymnast to record a 10.0 on
balance beam.
"Lindsay's performance was flawless and her
score was absolutely deserving," said Stanford
head coach Kristen Smyth. "I thought her rou
tine last weekend was perfect too."
At the last meet against Arizona, Wing fell
just short of a 10.0 with a 9.95. Her consistency
on the four-inch wide beam is perhaps the most
remarkable part of her gymnastics. A three-time
All-American on beam. Wing has delivered a
9.825 or better at every regular season meet
since her sophomore year. Over the past two
seasons, she has scored a 9.95 or better over 50
percent of the time she mounts the beam.
Practice is what makes perfect. Wing said

she benefits from practicing pressure sets in
the gym — Smyth will sometimes interrupt
usual practice and make the gymnasts perform
their beam routines with the pressure of the
whole team watching. Sometimes Smyth will
ask the men's team to come heckle the women
to increase their mental toughness on the
event.
"As a team, it makes us more comfortable
competing and it prepares us for anything,"
Wing said. "We're really working on not holding
anything back on the beam."
The Cardinal is ranked third in the nation on
balance beam. Fluhrer scored a 9.925 on Friday
night and although senior Lise Leveille fell on a
layout step-out series at the meet, she is a co-
Pac-10 Champion with Wing and usually con
tributes a 9.9 or better.
Stanford was also strong on the uneven
bars and floor exercise at Friday's meet. Wing
led the team on bars, matching her career-high
of 9.95 on the apparatus and sticking the sea
son debut of her double front Brani out dis
mount. Sophomore Glyn Sweets, back in the
bars line-up for the first time this season, exe
cuted a very difficult routine fora 9.925.
"Bars was our best event tonight and we are
one of the top bar teams in the country," Smyth
said. "Glyn Sweets, Nat Foley and Caroline
Fluhrer have three of the most difficult and in
tricate routines in the NCAA."
Stanford scored just as well on floor exercise
as they did on bars, racking up 49.475 points on
each event. With new choreography this season
set to a remix of Madonna music, Fluhrer struck
a pose to score her second straight 9.95 on floor.
Leveille also earned her second straight 9.95 and
is in the hunt fora perfect 10.

The women's gymnastics team was a model of consistency in its defeat
of Washington Friday night.
The Cardinal will hit the road this coming week
end to face their toughest matchup yet against No. 3
UCLA. Stanford tied the reigning national champi
ons at last year's meet in Burnham, but lost the pre
vious two years. The competition will be just as tough
this year and will be one of the few nationally tele
vised college gymnastics meets of the year.
UCLA is led by Kate Richardson who delivered a

perfect 10 on both beam and floor when UCLA de
feated Arizona State and Cal State Fullerton this past
Sunday. UCLA's highest team score of the season,
197.85, matches the highest team score in Stanford's
history.
But Stanford's gymnasts look stronger than ever this
season and they are eager to see how they match up
against one of the top teams in the country. For the Car
dinal's five seniors, this weekend will be their last
chance to beat the Bruins in regular season competi
tion.
"We have a lot of friends on that team and they're a
big rival for us," said Fluhrer. "So we'd like nothing
more than to beat them. We're really hungry and we're
going to put everything out there next weekend."
