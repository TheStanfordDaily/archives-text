# Tennis remains undefeated

### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unaccustomed to the wintry
conditions at Tauhe Family Tennis
Stadium on Friday. Hawaii felt
even more chilled as the No. 2 Stan
ford women's tennis team (3-0)
notched an easy 6-1 win over the
unranked Rainbow Wahine.
Playing back-to-back singles
and doubles, Stanford junior Story
Tweedie-Yates looked unphased
after two hours of play at Taube.
Along with her doubles partner,
freshman Theresa Logar, Tweedie-
Yates blanked Lauren Fitzgerald
and Paige Mainor. 8-0, in a match
that lasted less than 45 minutes.
Pitted against Mainor yet again,
Tweedie-Yate, ranked No. 73 na
tioanlly, recorded the first singles
win for Stanford, easily winning the
point at the No. 4 singles position.
6-1,6-1.
"[The match] was solidly in
Stanford's favor," Tweedie-Yates
said. "There wasn't enough play
time to really get into the stuff that
we worked on in practice. We had
worked on [different strategies]

and the points often didn't go on
long enough for that."
Teammates Alice Barnes, Lau
ren Barnikow, Erin Burdette and
Joanna Kao all followed suit, post
ing swift, straight-set victories.
Burdette, a junior currently
ranked seventh in the country in
singles, dominated at the No. 1 slot
against Fitzgerald. The powerful
Burdette made difficult crosscourt
winners look effortless, stifling
Fitzgerald, 6-3, 6-0, with shots that
barely brushed against the baseline.
Burdette also served consistent
ly, making several aces and only a
handful of double faults.
"Knowing early on that I could
dictate play and be aggressive gave
me confidence," Burdette said.
"My serve has been a work in
progress. I had a stretch earlier last
season where my serve was having
problems, but it turned around to
wards the end of the season and
was reliable all the way through
Nationals. [Since then] I have been
concentrating on my serve, espe
cially while I was recovering from
my injury."
Burdette has bounced back

after undergoing wrist surgery in
late October,
"This has been my most serious
injury to date," she said. "There
was naturally a lot of anxiety [over
whether] things would ever be the
same on the court and if I could re
cover in time for the upcoming
team events. 1 was actually a bit
nervous before my match on Fri
day, which I think was good be
cause I realized how much 1 still
cared about playing."
At times on Friday, Hawaii
showed signs of fiercer competi
tion, engaging in lengthier rallies
with the Cardinal. However,
Barnes, a sophomore, and
Barnikow, a senior, both showed
stamina and excellent form to edge
out tentative opponents.
Currently ranked No. 20 and
playing in the No. 2 position.
Barnes defeated Sylvia Jaros, 6-1,
6-1. Following closely at No. 21 and
playing in the No. 3 spot, Barnikow
downed Justine Boutet, 6-3,6-0.
Both players boast solid 9-4 sin
gles records.
