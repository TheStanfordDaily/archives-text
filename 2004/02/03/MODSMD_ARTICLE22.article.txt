# Tennis remains undefeated
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unaccustomed to the wintry
conditions at Tauhe Family Tennis
Stadium on Friday. Hawaii felt
even more chilled as the No. 2 Stan
ford women's tennis team (3-0)
notched an easy 6-1 win over the
unranked Rainbow Wahine.
Playing back-to-back singles
and doubles, Stanford junior Story
Tweedie-Yates looked unphased
after two hours of play at Taube.
Along with her doubles partner,
freshman Theresa Logar, Tweedie-
Yates blanked Lauren Fitzgerald
and Paige Mainor. 8-0, in a match
that lasted less than 45 minutes.
Pitted against Mainor yet again,
Tweedie-Yate, ranked No. 73 na
tioanlly, recorded the first singles
win for Stanford, easily winning the
point at the No. 4 singles position.
6-1,6-1.
"[The match] was solidly in
Stanford's favor," Tweedie-Yates
said. "There wasn't enough play
time to really get into the stuff that
we worked on in practice. We had
worked on [different strategies]

and the points often didn't go on
long enough for that."
Teammates Alice Barnes, Lau
ren Barnikow, Erin Burdette and
Joanna Kao all followed suit, post
ing swift, straight-set victories.
Burdette, a junior currently
ranked seventh in the country in
singles, dominated at the No. 1 slot
against Fitzgerald. The powerful
Burdette made difficult crosscourt
winners look effortless, stifling
Fitzgerald, 6-3, 6-0, with shots that
barely brushed against the baseline.
Burdette also served consistent
ly, making several aces and only a
handful of double faults.
"Knowing early on that I could
dictate play and be aggressive gave
me confidence," Burdette said.
"My serve has been a work in
progress. I had a stretch earlier last
season where my serve was having
problems, but it turned around to
wards the end of the season and
was reliable all the way through
Nationals. [Since then] I have been
concentrating on my serve, espe
cially while I was recovering from
my injury."
Burdette has bounced back

after undergoing wrist surgery in
late October,
"This has been my most serious
injury to date," she said. "There
was naturally a lot of anxiety [over
whether] things would ever be the
same on the court and if I could re
cover in time for the upcoming
team events. 1 was actually a bit
nervous before my match on Fri
day, which I think was good be
cause I realized how much 1 still
cared about playing."
At times on Friday, Hawaii
showed signs of fiercer competi
tion, engaging in lengthier rallies
with the Cardinal. However,
Barnes, a sophomore, and
Barnikow, a senior, both showed
stamina and excellent form to edge
out tentative opponents.
Currently ranked No. 20 and
playing in the No. 2 position.
Barnes defeated Sylvia Jaros, 6-1,
6-1. Following closely at No. 21 and
playing in the No. 3 spot, Barnikow
downed Justine Boutet, 6-3,6-0.
Both players boast solid 9-4 sin
gles records.

Senior Emilia Anderson and the Stanford women's tennis
team thrashed Hawaii to remain undefeated in match play.
Meanwhile, Kao, a sophomore, improved her record
to 8-3 with a 6-1,6-0 victory over Renata Camargo in the
No. 5 spot.
Sophomore Jessica Leek, playing No. 6 singles, fell to
Kana Aikawa, 6-1, 6-4, giving the Rainbows their only
point.
In doubles action, head coach Lele Forood decided to
mix things up in order to give more players a chance to
compete before the upcoming Team Indoors Champi
onships in Madison, Wise Combined, the three doubles
pairs relinquished just one game to the Rainbow
Wahine.

"The [teams] who played on Friday were people who
haven't played together [a lot this season]," Tweedie-
Yates said. "[Before Indoors. Forood] is trying to find
players with styles that complement each other, espe
cially with our new players."
Competing in the No. 1 doubles spot, senior Emilia
Anderson seemed well-matched with freshman Anne
Yelsey in their second time on the court together. An
derson and Yelsey posted an 8-0 win over Jaros and
Boutet.
Anderson and Yelsey are ranked 17th nationally in
doubles. Last October, the pair reached the semifinals at
the ITA Northwest Championships, falling to Califor
nia's No. 7 tandem of Raquel Kops-Jones and Sasha
Podkolzina, 8-2.
Leek teamed up with Kao in the No. 3 slot to down
Aikawa and Kimberly Curtis, 8-1.
The Cardinal will be in action again this week, open
ing play at the challenging Team Indoors on Thursday.
