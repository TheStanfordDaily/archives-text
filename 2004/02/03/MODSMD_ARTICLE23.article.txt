## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 men's volleyball team
(5-5, 3-3 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) had its share of ups
and downs this weekend, con
tributing to an inconsistent pattern
of wins and losses amongst the
three teams in accordance with
their rankings. On Friday, the Car
dinal beat then-No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (5-4, 3-2) in five games
(28-30, 30-25, 30-28,19-30, 16-14),
and lost to California State-
Northridge (7-3, 3-2) in three (30-
23,30-26,30-20) on Saturday.
Game one of match one was in
dicative of all the games to follow:
hard-fought and tight throughout.
The Cardinal tallied six service er
rors to lose by two, 30-28. But
sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy and junior setter / outside
hitter Pat Bomhack were showing
signs of heating up, chipping in five
kills apiece.
Stanford looked smoother in
game two, jumping out to an early
5-1 lead that the Gauchos couldn't
close until a long rally ended in
their favor to cut the Cardinal ad
vantage to one at 14-13. But a run
punctuated by an ace by sopho
more middle hitter Chris Ahlfeldt
and a kill off a Gaucho overpass by
Reddy would put the Cardinal up,
17-13. Stanford never looked back
and closed out the game, 30-25.
By the end of game two. Reddy
had posted 10 kills, while sopho
more outside hitter Evan Patak,
who was expected to lead the Gau
cho attack, nad seven.
"[Patak'sj a really strong player
and he hits a heavy ball," said junior
setter Kevin Hansen. "But I think
we did a great job of slowing him
down."
The Cardinal came out swinging
again in game three, jumping out to
a quick 8-3 advantage. However,
Santa Barbara was able to fight
back. Sophomore middle blocker
David Kennedy responded with an

ace and a kill to give his team the
first lead of the game at 16-15. The
teams would exchange points until
the Gauchos led by two at 28-26 off
a kill by Patak. A controversial de
cision to replay a contested point
ended in a Gaucho hitting error,
and Reddy subsequently notched
two aces to regain the Cardinal lead
at 29-28. A Santa Barbara hitting
error meant Stanford took game
three,3o-28.
In game four, though, teams
evened the score until tied at 6, after
which Santa Barbara took and
maintained a steady lead. It was a
change Hansen, who notched 50 as
sists, noticed.
"After games two and three we
lost focus a little bit," he said. "We
have to be focused on each game as
it starts."
Instead, Patak recorded a kill for
a six-point advantage at 15-9, and
Gaucho blocking forced a 23-13
lead and a Stanford time out. The
Cardinal could not recover, losing
big in game four, 30-19.
Stanford's quality of play im
proved in the fifth game, as teams ex
changed points again and again,
evening the score at every number
from one to seven.
Though Patak blocked fora two
point lead at 9-7, the Cardinal came
back as Ahlfeldt and Reddy blocked
Patak to tie the game at 13. Reddy
notched his 20th kill of the night to
claim a Cardinal victory, 16-14, in a
game he said he enjoyed.
"It was so mucH fun," Reddy
said. "I wasn't thinking about the
crowd or even the play that just
happened. I was just focusing on the
moment."
Bomhack, who came off the
bench to post eight kills, agreed.
"It was a great victory," he said.
Coach Don Shaw was pleased
with his team's performance in spite
of all the ups and downs.
"Our wins are not going to be
pretty," he said.
But Saturday's loss was not pretty,
either.

This time, Reddy, who had led
the Cardinal offense the night be
fore, only played part of game one
before being benched for the re
mainder of the match.
"He was hitting negative after
the first game," Shaw said of
Reddy. "And that's like any of
these guys, they're going to have
good nights and bad nights."
But Reddy wasn't the only one
having a bad night. As a team, the
Cardinal recorded a minus-,040 at
tack percentage, giving the Mata
dors an 11-8 lead they would main
tain until the 30-23 win.
"We didn't play well at all,"
Shaw said. "And I think Northridge
deserves a lot of credit for that."
Northridge, led by the 14 kills
posted by Dan Rhodes, certainly
did, taking a lead at 6-5, one they
would extend to five at 11-6. The
Cardinal fought back to tie up the
game at 23, thanks to a kill by
Ahlfeldt and a Matador hitting
error, and even took a 25-24 lead
off of a kill by sophomore William
Clayton. But Northridge went on a
6-1 run to win by four, 30-26.
The back and forth nature of the
game was what junior outside
David Vogel, who posted a team
high 11 kills and was the only Cardi
nal in double digits on attack,
picked up on.
"Consistency was the factor
tonight," he said.
In game three, a series of Stan
ford hitting errors gave the Mata
dors a 10-4 lead. Northridge extend
ed its lead to 10 at 23-13, at which
point a contested call by a linesman
earned Hansen a yellow card. The
Matadors continued to dominate,
ending the match on an ace.
"Nobody played well," Shaw
said of the 3-0 loss. "I think we got a
little frustrated and didn't deal with
our frustration well."
Stanford will have a chance to
take out that frustration on two
teams this weekend. The Cardi
nal will play at USC on Thursday
and at Pepperdine on Saturday.

"Consistency was the factor
tonight," he said.
In game three, a series of Stan
ford hitting errors gave the Mata
dors a 10-4 lead. Northridge extend
ed its lead to 10 at 23-13, at which
point a contested call by a linesman
earned Hansen a yellow card. The
Matadors continued to dominate,
ending the match on an ace.
"Nobody played well," Shaw
said of the 3-0 loss. "I think we got a
little frustrated and didn't deal with
our frustration well."
Stanford will have a chance to
take out that frustration on two
teams this weekend. The Cardi
nal will play at USC on Thursday
and at Pepperdine on Saturday.
The No. 8 men's volleyball team
(5-5, 3-3 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) had its share of ups
and downs this weekend, con
tributing to an inconsistent pattern
of wins and losses amongst the
three teams in accordance with
their rankings. On Friday, the Car
dinal beat then-No. 5 UC-Santa
Barbara (5-4, 3-2) in five games
(28-30, 30-25, 30-28,19-30, 16-14),
and lost to California State-
Northridge (7-3, 3-2) in three (30-
23,30-26,30-20) on Saturday.
Game one of match one was in
dicative of all the games to follow:
hard-fought and tight throughout.
The Cardinal tallied six service er
rors to lose by two, 30-28. But
sophomore outside hitter Ben
Reddy and junior setter / outside
hitter Pat Bomhack were showing
signs of heating up, chipping in five
kills apiece.
Stanford looked smoother in
game two, jumping out to an early
5-1 lead that the Gauchos couldn't
close until a long rally ended in
their favor to cut the Cardinal ad
vantage to one at 14-13. But a run
punctuated by an ace by sopho
more middle hitter Chris Ahlfeldt
and a kill off a Gaucho overpass by
Reddy would put the Cardinal up,
17-13. Stanford never looked back
and closed out the game, 30-25.
By the end of game two. Reddy
had posted 10 kills, while sopho
more outside hitter Evan Patak,
who was expected to lead the Gau
cho attack, nad seven.
"[Patak'sj a really strong player
and he hits a heavy ball," said junior
setter Kevin Hansen. "But I think
we did a great job of slowing him
down."
The Cardinal came out swinging
again in game three, jumping out to
a quick 8-3 advantage. However,
Santa Barbara was able to fight
back. Sophomore middle blocker
David Kennedy responded with an

ace and a kill to give his team the
first lead of the game at 16-15. The
teams would exchange points until
the Gauchos led by two at 28-26 off
a kill by Patak. A controversial de
cision to replay a contested point
ended in a Gaucho hitting error,
and Reddy subsequently notched
two aces to regain the Cardinal lead
at 29-28. A Santa Barbara hitting
error meant Stanford took game
three,3o-28.
In game four, though, teams
evened the score until tied at 6, after
which Santa Barbara took and
maintained a steady lead. It was a
change Hansen, who notched 50 as
sists, noticed.
"After games two and three we
lost focus a little bit," he said. "We
have to be focused on each game as
it starts."
Instead, Patak recorded a kill for
a six-point advantage at 15-9, and
Gaucho blocking forced a 23-13
lead and a Stanford time out. The
Cardinal could not recover, losing
big in game four, 30-19.
Stanford's quality of play im
proved in the fifth game, as teams ex
changed points again and again,
evening the score at every number
from one to seven.
Though Patak blocked fora two
point lead at 9-7, the Cardinal came
back as Ahlfeldt and Reddy blocked
Patak to tie the game at 13. Reddy
notched his 20th kill of the night to
claim a Cardinal victory, 16-14, in a
game he said he enjoyed.
"It was so mucH fun," Reddy
said. "I wasn't thinking about the
crowd or even the play that just
happened. I was just focusing on the
moment."
Bomhack, who came off the
bench to post eight kills, agreed.
"It was a great victory," he said.
Coach Don Shaw was pleased
with his team's performance in spite
of all the ups and downs.
"Our wins are not going to be
pretty," he said.
But Saturday's loss was not pretty,
either.

This time, Reddy, who had led
the Cardinal offense the night be
fore, only played part of game one
before being benched for the re
mainder of the match.
"He was hitting negative after
the first game," Shaw said of
Reddy. "And that's like any of
these guys, they're going to have
good nights and bad nights."
But Reddy wasn't the only one
having a bad night. As a team, the
Cardinal recorded a minus-,040 at
tack percentage, giving the Mata
dors an 11-8 lead they would main
tain until the 30-23 win.
"We didn't play well at all,"
Shaw said. "And I think Northridge
deserves a lot of credit for that."
Northridge, led by the 14 kills
posted by Dan Rhodes, certainly
did, taking a lead at 6-5, one they
would extend to five at 11-6. The
Cardinal fought back to tie up the
game at 23, thanks to a kill by
Ahlfeldt and a Matador hitting
error, and even took a 25-24 lead
off of a kill by sophomore William
Clayton. But Northridge went on a
6-1 run to win by four, 30-26.
The back and forth nature of the
game was what junior outside
David Vogel, who posted a team
high 11 kills and was the only Cardi
nal in double digits on attack,
picked up on.
"Consistency was the factor
tonight," he said.
In game three, a series of Stan
ford hitting errors gave the Mata
dors a 10-4 lead. Northridge extend
ed its lead to 10 at 23-13, at which
point a contested call by a linesman
earned Hansen a yellow card. The
Matadors continued to dominate,
ending the match on an ace.
