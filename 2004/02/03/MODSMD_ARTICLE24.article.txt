(U-WIRE) WACO, Texas —In an attempt to
help rebuild Iraq's higher education system, a group
of 20 Baylor professors and two graduate students
journeyed to the war-torn country over Christmas
break to conduct a two-day conference for area uni
versity faculty members.
They traveled to Dohuk University in the north
ern Kurdish region of Iraq in December.
In August three professors — Dr. Bill Mitchell,
director of the Center for International Education;
Dr. Mark Long, director of the Middle East Studies
Program; and Bill Baker, Arabic language profes
sor — took a preliminary trip to Dohuk and Mosul
Universities to assess the needs of the educational
facilities.
"The biggest difference [between Iraqi universi
ties and American universities] is that they have
been unable to obtain contemporary materials,"
Mitchell said. "For instance, they couldn't get chem
icals they needed for labs [orJ new books and jour
nals [and] were restricted from traveling and work
ing within the international community because
Saddam isolated them. In most cases, he cut off
funds for higher education schools."
The group, joined by Dr. Jimmie Burrell and Dr.
Carolyn Bishop from the Consortium of Global Ed

ucation, left for Iraq on Dec. 14 — the same clay
Hussein was captured.
They conducted workshops at Dohuk fora group
ranging from 55 to 150 attendees composed of pro
fessors, university presidents, politicians, military
officials and community leaders, Mitchell said.
"What we were trying to do was to go in and help
people who have been suffering as a result of Sad
dam Hussein for many years by establishing rela
tionships with colleagues and assisting them in im
proving their methodological techniques and teach
ing content," Mitchell said.
Dr. Walter Wilcox, a physics professor, instruct
ed workshops related to physics education with Dr.
John Vasut, a physics lecturer. Wilcox introduced
the Open-Text concept, which allows anyone in the
world to have access to downloadable physics texts.
"Things |in Iraqi are forced upon them, and they
haven't had access to textbooks," Wilcox said. "They
are very interested in the technical fields, and there
is a real need for engineering and physics teachers to
help build up the structure of that region."
The group plans to continue in their communica
tion with the Iraqi universities and in their effort to
help restore the higher education system.
"It's going to take time, but there is no doubt that
the key to moving toward a civil society and justice
is dependent on developing a higher education sys
tem," Mitchell said.
