# University of Hawaii hosts panel on GMO agriculture
## 
### LAURIE AU KALEO O HAWAII 
(U-WIRE) HONOLULU —
Many consumers aren't aware that
the everyday foods they eat con
tain GMOs, or even what GMO
stands for.
Genetically modified organisms
are the results of genetic engineer
ing, where scientists can take de
sired genes from an organism and
insert them into another organism
to improve the production of the off
spring. The issue of GMOs is con
troversial with concerns such as the
future safety of the world's natural
environment and the hope to help
end world hunger.
The University of Hawaii at
Manoa College of Tropical Agricul
ture and Human Resources and
kNOw GMO is sponsoring a panel
of four UH speakers and three ac
tivists to discuss the benefits, risks
and to inform the UH community of
GMOs.
Entitled "Genetically Modi
fied Organisms: A Path or Obsta
cle to a Sustainable Agriculture,"
the discussion was held at the
Campus Center courtyard Mon
day at noon.
The organization, kNOw GMO,
is part of a statewide coalition to
protect the safety of Hawaii's food

crops, environment and the bur
geoning organic farming sector of
the economy, said Chuck Garman,
who helped organized the discus
sion with CTAHR.
The three activists, Jeffrey Smith,
Luke Anderson and Bill Freese,
have been touring the state, speak
ing about GMOs and biotechnology
in Hawaii.
Ania Wieczorek, Robert Paull,
Richard Manshardt and Steve Fer
reira discussed UH's role with
biotechnology. Wieczorek leads
the agricultural biotechnology ex
tension and awareness program at
UH. Paull, Manshardt and Ferreira
conduct research at UH involving
genetic engineering.
About 70 percent of America's
food market, such as food purchased
at supermarkets, contains traits of
genetic engineering, according to
Wieczorek.
Americans have a low awareness
of GMOs despite the increasing
amounts of foods that are genetical
ly modified. In a poll, conducted by
Pew Initiative on Food and Biotech
nology in September 2003, 58 per
cent of 1,000 telephone interviewees
said they have not eaten foods that
were genetically modified.
Most of the food consumed today
contains GMOs. Some foods that
have genetically engineered traits

are corn, cotton, potato, tomato,
soybeans and wheat.
"People really don't know much
of what their food comes from," ex
plained Wieczorek. "People should
pay attention to what's happening
around them."
The main goal for Monday's discus
sion was for students and faculty to
become exposed to the issue of
GMOs.
"We want to raise awareness and
if they're interested, they will do re
search and seek more information,"
said Garman.
Both sides of the panel agree that
students should find their own opin
ion for genetic engineering.
"I'm happy this is coming from
both sides," said Garman. "Whether
the issue is right or wrong, people
have to come to it on their own."
Added Wieczorek before the
event,"I hope students go and listen
objectively, make their decision and
find out more. They should look for
scientific-based information.
"Genetic engineering is different
from traditional cross-breeding of
plants because it doesn't require the
two organisms to be closely related.
In classical breeding, the two organ
isms can only breed if they are sexu
ally compatible: either the same
species or closely related," said
Wieczorek.
