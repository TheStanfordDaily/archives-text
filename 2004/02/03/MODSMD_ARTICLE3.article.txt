# Mirrielees parking threatened
## 
### BRIAN NGUYEN 
Construction of the Graduate Stu
dent Community Center began last
week, and residents of Mirrielees, a
dorm whose parking lot is already per
petually filled, are worried.

With Mirrielees residents already
competing with graduate students for
limited parking in Escondido Village,
many have had to seek parking across
Campus Drive in the Wilbur lot. Stu
dents fear that construction and the
traffic caused by the eventual comple

tion of the center will only make park
ing more difficult.
"You are almost guaranteed not to
find a spot in the [Mirrieleesj parking
lot past dinner," said sophomore David
Wang. "The center will mean more
walking across Campus Drive."
Although construction is expected
to take 10 months, according to Project
Manager Mark Bonino, he said he
could not address the parking issue he
cause he is new to the project.
However, junior Ken Lee disagrees
with the notion that construction will
cause more problems: "Parking is still
terrible, but I wasn't even aware that
the center was being built and I haven't
noticed any changes yet."
Two large eucalyptus trees behind
the construction site and adjacent
graduate housing units have been re
moved to accommodate more space for
landscaping. In addition, two new
walkways are being constructed on the
east and south sides of the center to re
place the existing walkways that con
flict with the construction area.
The two-story building is modeled
after the Arrillaga Alumni Center and
will have 12,000 square feet of space. It
is being built adjacent to Studio One
along Escondido Road. The center will
server as a focal point of graduate stu
dent life; more than half of the 7,500
graduate students live on campus. Its
social and academic functions will be ac
commodated by multipurpose and ad
ministrative spaces as well as a cafe op
erated by Stanford Dining Services.
