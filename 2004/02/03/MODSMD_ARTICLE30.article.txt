## Cardoso addresses NYU students 
### MARIA ROSA WASHINGTON SQUARE NEWS 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK —
Brazil's former president, Fer
nando Henrique Cardoso, de
fended his country's social and
economic policies last week as
part of New York University's
"Voices of Latin American
Leaders" lecture series.
Cardoso fielded questions
from lecture moderator Jorge
Castaneda — a Global Distin
guished professor of politics
and Latin American and
Caribbean studies at NYU and
the former foreign minister of
Mexico, — comparing him and
the current Brazilian presi
dent, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
Both presidents began their
terms with socialist ideas of
economic reform but shifted
toward more conservative eco
nomic policies.
"Room for maneuver in
terms of markets is limited,"
Cardoso said to the large audi
ence assembled in Hem
merdinger Hall in the Silver
Center for the Arts and Sci
ence. "You can say i will close
the economy and I will do it for

myself and be independent
from the international mar
ket.' This is just a dream be
cause as far as you move in that
direction, the population will
react."
Cardoso said the World
Bank's allotment of $10 billion
per year for developing coun
tries was "peanuts." He said
that Brazil's Central Bank has
the same amount of money and
contrasted this figure to the $87
billion for Iraq's redevelopment
approved by Congress last No
vember.
Brazil has steadily bridged
the gap between the poor and
the wealthy "in spite of bad eco
nomic years in the '905," he said.
Ten years ago, 25 percent of
school-age children in the black
population of Brazil were not
enrolled in school, Cardoso
said. Now only six percent of
that population is not enrolled,
he said.
Students receive at least
one meal a day at public
schools, Cardoso said. Chil
dren in the poorest areas re
ceive two meals.
Brazil's infant mortality rate
has significantly decreased from

43 or 44 per thousand to 26 per
thousand, Cardodo said, quot
ing the World Bank.
"The poorest part of Brazil
ian society has been improved,"
Cardoso said. "It takes time to
transform society. The popula
tion is more wise than political
people believe. The Brazilian
people don't expect dreams."
The audience questioned
the leader about cities such as
Rio de Janeiro, which has one
of the highest homicide rates in
the world. Some linked the
poverty and violence. The city
records 46 murders per 100,000
people, according to the Asso
ciated Press.
"Poor people are not crimi
nals," Cardos said. "In Brazil
there are more criminals be
cause of drugs than poverty."
He stressed drugs were a
global, rather than an endemic,
problem.
Audience members also
brought up the controversy
surrounding a proposal possi
bly to charge students tuition at
state universities. State univer
sities in Brazil have always
been tuition-free, which Car
doso supports.
