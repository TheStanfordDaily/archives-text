# Grocery strike enters month four
## 
### KATHERINE KIRKPATRICK THE DAILY TROJAN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGEL.ES â€” Heading into its fourth
month, the Southern California grocery strike is still unre
solved, complete with continuing picket lines and protests.
But while publicity for the strike has died down, conflict is
still apparent.
On Jan. 28, 15 people were arrested in a rally outside a
Vons supermarket after the employees spread across the
entrance and refused to move. Protests were also held on
Jan. 17 and 21.
In all, 24 picketers have been arrested.
And while locked-out employees no longer picket at
the Ralph's stores near the University of Southern Cali
fornia on a daily basis, some students still find themselves
in the crosshairs of the labor dispute.
"I feel bad crossing the picket lines," said Andrew De-
Witt, a sophomore majoring in music industry.
DeWitt said there have been some benefits to the strike
however.
Students can get special deals and discounted groceries,
DeWitt said.
Some people have shown their support of the workers by
shopping at stores not involved, like Whole Foods Market
and Trader Joe's.
Others say they agree with the grocery store on their po
sition in the strike.
"The fact that it's still going on is ridiculous. 1 think if the
grocery stores expect to be competitive, they have to oppose
the employees," said Chrissy Saunders, a sophomore ma
joring in psychology.
Saunders said she continues to do her shopping at the
local Ralph's grocery store.

Other students said they feel empathy for the workers
and their cause.
"I think that the workers are striking fora good cause,"
said Ryan Shane, a freshman majoring in business.
"The powers in the corporate world should seriously
consider the benefits that their workers are requesting,"
he said.
In the meantime, some students are still frustrated by the
ongoing strike.
"I haven't been grocery shopping at different places,"
said Allison Poccia, a sophomore majoring in communi
cations. "I just can't believe they're still striking.
She added, "Nothing is being done about it. Why do
they feel they need to keep protesting? After months of no
success, they should move on to something else or come up
with another solution," she said.
The strike started on Oct. 11, 2003 over contract differ
ences, stemming from benefit disputes, particularly health
care.
Vons, Ralph's and Albertsons proposed cuts in the ben
efits, in part to compete with the possibility of Wal-Mart, a
non-union chain, expanding into the grocery market in
Southern California.
The United Food and Commercial Workers, which rep
resents the 70,000 striking and locked-out workers, has re
fused to budge in the dispute.
Stores have hired temporary non-union workers to fill
the spaces.
The long battle has put a financial strain on workers and
their families.
Many spend the time they used to spend working stand
ing in a picket line.
The union pays the picketers, but at only a fraction of
their old salary.
