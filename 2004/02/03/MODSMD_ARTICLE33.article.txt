### Sarah Kate Sullivan THE CRIMSON WHITE 
(U-WIRE) TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - A bill
that would shield displays of the Ten Com
mandments in public places from tort inter
ference has been reintroduced in the U.S.
Congress.
U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville,
has reintroduced his "Ten Commandments
Protection Bill," which would protect state
and local authority under the 10th Amend
ment to display the Ten Commandments in
public areas.
Aderholt first presented the legislation in
1998, but former state Chief Justice Roy
Moore's removal from office last year after
his defiance of a court order to remove a 2.6-
ton Ten Commandments monument has
shined new light on the bill.
Aderholt said he bases his argument on the
Ten Commandments' place in American his
tory and does not endorse displays reflective
of other religious beliefs because of their lack
of influence on America's legal system.
Though he said he endorses expression of
religious beliefs in public places and wishes to
restore religious liberties, Aderholt said the
issue's main foundation is the Founding Fa
thers' belief in the Ten Commandments' prin
ciples.
"The Ten Commandments represent the
very cornerstone of the values this nation was
built upon, and the basis of so much of our
legal system here in America," Aderholt said
in a statement. "Do not kill or steal, obey your
parents. Do not commit adultery. Who can
argue with these important rules for any func
tioning society?"
Though Aderholt has been lobbying for
this authorization for six years, Alabama was
inundated this year by heated debate about
the constitutionality of Moore's marble Ten
Commandments display in the rotunda of the
state judicial building in Montgomery.
Aderholt said he received e-mails and let
ters from people all over the country during
the legal battle. He said that though they
might not have had the same high profile as
Moore's defiance in Montgomery, people in
other states like Georgia, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas have fought similar
battles.
"I feel that the bill has enough support to
pass tomorrow if it were presented to the
floor," he said.
The bill has been successful in the House in

recent years. Originally, the actual wording of
the document was passed in 1999 as an
amendment to the Juvenile Justice Bill. How
ever, the Juvenile Justice Bill eventually died
in Congress.
"We have heard from the judges; now it is
time that we hear from the people on this
issue," Aderholt said.
He expects substantial support for his bill
from the religious community across the
country. In Alabama, the Christian Coalition
has devoted its loyalty to Aderholt's cause.
"We give our wholehearted support for
Congressman Aderholt's continued effort to
legalize the display of the Ten Command
ments across America," said John Giles, pres
ident of the state Christian Coalition.
Giles said he could not imagine who would
not support the bill. He said national family
organizations have already signed on to the
bill.
Both Aderholt and Giles asserted the U.S.
Supreme Court building has limestone monu
ments in two or three locations and said the
two tablets of the Ten Commandments hang
on the wall over the head of the U.S. chief jus
tice.
"In the back entrance of the Capitol, a stat
ue of Moses himself holding the tablets is on
display," he said.
Richard Cohen, the attorney working on
the Ten Commandments case for the Mont
gomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center,
questioned Aderholt's motives in defending
the tablets that have been so controversial in
Alabama.
"Roy Moore didn't install the Ten Com
mandments in the Capitol building as a histo
ry lesson, but as an expression and acknowl
edgement of his god," he said.
Cohen said a religious document on public
display is unconstitutional if it either is meant
to promote religion or has that effect. He said
Moore's monument was illegal because
Moore admitted he aimed to promote Chris
tianity and because the display had that ef
fect.
"The effect of the bill is immunizing the
Ten Commandments from challenge," he said.
"It's like saying no one can challenge a restric
tion on freedom of speech. The court's author
ity can't be undermined in this certain way."
He said Aderholt's position is simoly a cul
tural issue used by politicians as a political
wedge and a ploy in an election year.
"It is a sad day when we see politicians
pander to popular will," he said. "They are

playing con games with the sacred Bill of
Rights that should be guarded instead. We
should never underestimate a politician's
wrapping himself in the flag."
But Giles said the principles of the Ten
Commandments are universally appealing to
people of all faiths.
"The Ten Commandments are embraced in
a spirit of endearment to people of faith," he
said. "They cut across Christian, Jewish and
Muslim lines and move beyond endearment to
our Constitution and the history of the foun
dation of our law."
Giles said the Ten Commandments' roots
are deeper than Christianity and said they
were the moral code and foundation embod
ied in English common law that was the gene
sis of American and Alabama law. He said a
similar bill is also being introduced in the Leg
islature.
Giles said the Christian Coalition remains
optimistic about the future of Aderholt's bill.
"In America, some say the Ten Command
ments divide us, but really the Ten Com
mandments unite us," he said.
Cohen said Aderholt's bill promotes un
constitutional conduct, but he said he knows
how popular the Ten Commandments issue is
among congressmen.
William Stewart, former chairman of the
UA political science department, said the bill
could be an election-year tactic to convince
voters of Republicans' dedication to religion.
"Some may see it as a Republican move to
wrap themselves in the cloak of piety as a
move to make Democrats appear that they
are against religion," Stewart said.
Stewart said he was unsure if the bill had
gathered enough support in Congress, since
election years often encourage different be
havior among politicians who seek re-elec
tion. He also said the judiciary would have the
ultimate authority in the matter. Congress can
pass Aderholt's bill, but a challenge could be
heard in the Supreme Court, and its decision
is final, he said.
Aderholt said the decision of whether to
display the Ten Commandments would be left
to state and local governments to decide. For
example, officials at a city hall or other gov
ernment building would have the option of
using government or private funds to erect a
monument. However, the bill would not pro
tect displays of other religions.
"Since the tenants of Buddhism are not part
of our legal history, any displays in its favor
would not be recognized," Aderholt said.

sis of American and Alabama law. He said a
similar bill is also being introduced in the Leg
islature.
Giles said the Christian Coalition remains
optimistic about the future of Aderholt's bill.
"In America, some say the Ten Command
ments divide us, but really the Ten Com
mandments unite us," he said.
Cohen said Aderholt's bill promotes un
constitutional conduct, but he said he knows
how popular the Ten Commandments issue is
among congressmen.
William Stewart, former chairman of the
UA political science department, said the bill
could be an election-year tactic to convince
voters of Republicans' dedication to religion.
"Some may see it as a Republican move to
wrap themselves in the cloak of piety as a
move to make Democrats appear that they
are against religion," Stewart said.
Stewart said he was unsure if the bill had
gathered enough support in Congress, since
election years often encourage different be
havior among politicians who seek re-elec
tion. He also said the judiciary would have the
ultimate authority in the matter. Congress can
pass Aderholt's bill, but a challenge could be
heard in the Supreme Court, and its decision
is final, he said.
Aderholt said the decision of whether to
display the Ten Commandments would be left
to state and local governments to decide. For
example, officials at a city hall or other gov
ernment building would have the option of
using government or private funds to erect a
monument. However, the bill would not pro
tect displays of other religions.
"Since the tenants of Buddhism are not part
of our legal history, any displays in its favor
would not be recognized," Aderholt said.
(U-WIRE) TUSCALOOSA, Ala. - A bill
that would shield displays of the Ten Com
mandments in public places from tort inter
ference has been reintroduced in the U.S.
Congress.
U.S. Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Haleyville,
has reintroduced his "Ten Commandments
Protection Bill," which would protect state
and local authority under the 10th Amend
ment to display the Ten Commandments in
public areas.
Aderholt first presented the legislation in
1998, but former state Chief Justice Roy
Moore's removal from office last year after
his defiance of a court order to remove a 2.6-
ton Ten Commandments monument has
shined new light on the bill.
Aderholt said he bases his argument on the
Ten Commandments' place in American his
tory and does not endorse displays reflective
of other religious beliefs because of their lack
of influence on America's legal system.
Though he said he endorses expression of
religious beliefs in public places and wishes to
restore religious liberties, Aderholt said the
issue's main foundation is the Founding Fa
thers' belief in the Ten Commandments' prin
ciples.
"The Ten Commandments represent the
very cornerstone of the values this nation was
built upon, and the basis of so much of our
legal system here in America," Aderholt said
in a statement. "Do not kill or steal, obey your
parents. Do not commit adultery. Who can
argue with these important rules for any func
tioning society?"
Though Aderholt has been lobbying for
this authorization for six years, Alabama was
inundated this year by heated debate about
the constitutionality of Moore's marble Ten
Commandments display in the rotunda of the
state judicial building in Montgomery.
Aderholt said he received e-mails and let
ters from people all over the country during
the legal battle. He said that though they
might not have had the same high profile as
Moore's defiance in Montgomery, people in
other states like Georgia, North Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas have fought similar
battles.
"I feel that the bill has enough support to
pass tomorrow if it were presented to the
floor," he said.
The bill has been successful in the House in

recent years. Originally, the actual wording of
the document was passed in 1999 as an
amendment to the Juvenile Justice Bill. How
ever, the Juvenile Justice Bill eventually died
in Congress.
"We have heard from the judges; now it is
time that we hear from the people on this
issue," Aderholt said.
He expects substantial support for his bill
from the religious community across the
country. In Alabama, the Christian Coalition
has devoted its loyalty to Aderholt's cause.
"We give our wholehearted support for
Congressman Aderholt's continued effort to
legalize the display of the Ten Command
ments across America," said John Giles, pres
ident of the state Christian Coalition.
Giles said he could not imagine who would
not support the bill. He said national family
organizations have already signed on to the
bill.
Both Aderholt and Giles asserted the U.S.
Supreme Court building has limestone monu
ments in two or three locations and said the
two tablets of the Ten Commandments hang
on the wall over the head of the U.S. chief jus
tice.
"In the back entrance of the Capitol, a stat
ue of Moses himself holding the tablets is on
display," he said.
Richard Cohen, the attorney working on
the Ten Commandments case for the Mont
gomery-based Southern Poverty Law Center,
questioned Aderholt's motives in defending
the tablets that have been so controversial in
Alabama.
"Roy Moore didn't install the Ten Com
mandments in the Capitol building as a histo
ry lesson, but as an expression and acknowl
edgement of his god," he said.
Cohen said a religious document on public
display is unconstitutional if it either is meant
to promote religion or has that effect. He said
Moore's monument was illegal because
Moore admitted he aimed to promote Chris
tianity and because the display had that ef
fect.
"The effect of the bill is immunizing the
Ten Commandments from challenge," he said.
"It's like saying no one can challenge a restric
tion on freedom of speech. The court's author
ity can't be undermined in this certain way."
He said Aderholt's position is simoly a cul
tural issue used by politicians as a political
wedge and a ploy in an election year.
"It is a sad day when we see politicians
pander to popular will," he said. "They are

playing con games with the sacred Bill of
Rights that should be guarded instead. We
should never underestimate a politician's
wrapping himself in the flag."
But Giles said the principles of the Ten
Commandments are universally appealing to
people of all faiths.
"The Ten Commandments are embraced in
a spirit of endearment to people of faith," he
said. "They cut across Christian, Jewish and
Muslim lines and move beyond endearment to
our Constitution and the history of the foun
dation of our law."
Giles said the Ten Commandments' roots
are deeper than Christianity and said they
were the moral code and foundation embod
ied in English common law that was the gene
sis of American and Alabama law. He said a
similar bill is also being introduced in the Leg
islature.
