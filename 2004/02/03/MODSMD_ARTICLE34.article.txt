# Texas Tech uses race in application process
## 
### ANDREW BELL UNIVERSITY DAILY 
(U-WIRE) LUBBOCK, Texas
â€” A student who would like to at
tend Texas Tech University could
have a good GPA and a great SAT
score, but the university will look at
another factor in the future when
considering admissions.
To diversify the student body at
Tech, race will be a factor used in
examining an incoming student's
application.
During Thursday's Student Gov
ernment Association meeting, the
Student Senate did not approve a
resolution that would consider race
as a factor in Tech's admission poli
cy. However, President Jon Whit
more said the Board of Regents had
already approved something similar
that would add race and ethnicity to
the admissions policy.
According to the resolution, on
June 23 the U.S. Supreme Court
made a ruling on the case of Grut
ter v. Bollinger. The ruling over
turned the U.S. Fifth Circuit
Court's decision in Hopwood v.
Texas, which previously prohibited
the consideration of race in univer
sity admissions.
In the Grutter case, a 5-4 majori
ty held the student body diversity in
higher education is a compelling
state interest that could justify race
conscious admissions policies, ac
cording to a Hogan & Hartson
L.L.P. document on the cases.
According to a Nixon Peabody
LLP document of the Supreme
Court decision, the law firm sug
gested many recommended steps a
university could use in regard to the
matter. A university could invento
ry all race-based policies and all
other diversity-related policies, in
cluding admissions, financial aid,
outreach, recruitment and employ
ment policies.
However, the law firm also sug
gests rigorously considering race
neutral alternatives in light of in
stitutional goals, according to the
document.
Since the Hopwood case is no
longer in effect in the state of Texas,
Whitmore said Tech would be going
through the proper steps to meet
the guidelines of the Supreme
Court. Once the guidelines are met,
Tech would begin to consider race

and ethnicity as an admissions fac
tor in the fall of 2005.
"It is a compelling interest to
have a diverse student body," he
said.
SGA President Jeremy Brown
said the Senate did not approve the
resolution because the idea of incor
porating race as a factor was not
something about which every stu
dent at Tech would agree.
Currently, in the state of Texas,
any high school senior who gradu
ates in the top 10 percent of his or
her class is guaranteed automatic
admission into a state university.
Brown said this policy helps to cre
ate a diverse campus because any
student who could meet the require
ment could attend Tech.
If a student does not meet all of
the requirements necessary to at
tend the university, then his or her
application and records could be
put on review, Brown said. During
the review process, the administra
tion looks at a student's cultural ex
periences and community service.
Brown said having a review
process is a good way to find the
best students for Tech, because
some students do not do well on the
SAT.
"Personally, if you are just look
ing at the SAT score and that stu
dent is accepted, then it doesn't tell
you what kind of student they are,"
he said.
Many students on campus might
feel adding race to the admissions
policy is a way to diversify Tech, but
Brown said the university and the
administration are already doing
great things to diversify the campus.
By incorporating race into the
admissions policy, Brown said he
feels it would not create an equal
opportunity for high school stu
dents throughout the state. Al
though every student should have
the opportunity for higher educa
tion, he said students who would
like to come to Tech should meet
the educational requirements of
the university.
According to senate resolution
39.11, some members of the stu
dent senate believe a race-con
scious admissions policy violates
the Equal Protection Clause of the
14th Amendment to the U.S. Con
stitution and the Equal Rights Act
of 1964.
