# Undergraduate Advising Center announces new probation rules
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
The Undergraduate Advising Center
has changed its academic probation policy
in what it says is an early attempt to help
struggling students. Undergraduates on
probation must now to meet regularly with
an advisor from the center in order to plan
academic improvement.
Previously, students were not referred
to an advisor at the center until they were
placed on provisional registration.
"We believe that earlier assessment,
academic advising intervention and sup
port for students who are experiencing aca
demic difficulty will lead to improved acad
emic decision making by these students,"
said Associate Vice Provost for Under
graduate Education Carol Porter. "Many
are unaware of the potential ramifications
of probation, and how quickly that status
can deteriorate to provisional registration
or even suspension."
According to the Stanford Bulletin, stu
dents are placed on probation if their GPA
falls below 2.0, if they fail to complete 36
units in three consecutive quarters or if
they fail to complete nine units in their
most recent quarter.
If a student on probation fails to complete
12 units or maintain a cumulative GPA above
2.0, that student is placed on provisional reg
istration. Those students are required to peti
tion in order to enroll the following quarter.
Students on provisional registration
who fail to complete 12 units or maintain a
GPA above 2.0 are suspended for one year
if it is their first suspension and three years
if it is their second suspension.
Porter said that students on probation

often have many problems.
"Students often struggle with these issues:
[they are] reluctant to confide in anyone, and
unaware of the many resources available to
help them when facing financial, emotional
and emergency situations that affect their
academic performance," Porter said.
Students are taken off probation and
provisional registration if they complete 12
units and bring the GPA up to 2.0. Students
may appeal to be taken off probation or
provisional registration. They can also peti

tion to return early from suspension. Stu
dents are also required to have a minimum
2.0 GPA in order to graduate.
Porter said that she has confidence in
the ability of the center's advisors.
"The UAC advisors are knowledgeable
and supportive, eager to meet with students
to assess the specific academic situation and
eager, too, to help them connect with appro
priate resources and / or develop a plan to
improve their academic performance,"
Porter said.
