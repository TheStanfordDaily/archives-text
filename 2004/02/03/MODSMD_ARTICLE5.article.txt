# Mexican institute funds Digital Vision Fellowships
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Mexico's Institute for
Telecommunications (INT
TELMEX) will sponsor two
scholarships for the next school
year. These scholarships will
allow two technological profes
sionals from a Latin American
country to take part in Stanford's
Digital Vision Fellowships.
Stuart Gannes, director of the
Digital Vision Fellowship Pro
gram, said that the new scholar
ships will provide the financial re

sources necessary for applicants
from Latin America to participate
in the program.
"We get lots of applications
from Latin America, but we can
only accept people who have
scholarships," Gannes said.
The Digital Vision Fellowship
is an interdisciplinary program
whose participants come from
around the world; they stay on
campus for up to nine months in
order to explore the use of infor
mation and communications tech
nology (ICT) to address the prob
lems facing developing nations.

Reuters Foundation found the
sponsors for the new scholarships
when Cannes spoke at a confer
ence on a global ICT education
program at MIT. Afterward,
Gannes was approached by Javier
Elguea, President of INT
TELMEX, which is part of a
multinational Mexican telecom
munications company.
According to Gannes, Elguea
asked him for more information
on the Digital Vision Fellows pro
gram, which he provided. After a
series of e-mails and telephone
calls between the two, the INT

TELMEX board approved the
scholarships.
The program's current fellows
come from diverse backgrounds
and several of them are from de
veloping countries.
"I think the scholarships
would benefit Latin America and
anyone from the developing
world," said Segeni Ng'ethe, a
Digital Vision Fellow from
Kenya. "It is an opportunity I am
grateful for having taken up. I
have gained much and soon it will
be time for me to share that which
I have acquired."

Digital Vision Fellow Njideka
Ugwuegbu Harry echoed Ng'ethe's
positive outlook for the new schol
arships.
"These scholarships will cer
tainly benefit Latin America be
cause the fellows will be able to
take their vision of information
and communications technology
applied towards a humanitarian
purpose to another level in their
countries," she said. "There will
definitely be good that coines out
of doing that, not just for the par
ticipating fellows, but for the
country as a whole."

"As somebody coming from a
developing country, the biggest
benefit that theDVF program has
given me is the ability to see de
veloping projects from the other
side of the fence, i.e. from the
supply side of development," said
Edgardo Yu, a Digital Vision Fel
low from the Philippines.
"There are so many other ways
that developed countries can con
tribute in direct or indirect ways,
and the fellowship has given me a
chance to see some of the other
possible ways we can help close
the gap," Yu added.
