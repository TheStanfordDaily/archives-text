PAUL BERG m MAXINE SINGER
George Beadle was a
towering scientific figure
whose work from 1940
to 1960 marked the
transition from classical
genetics to the molecular
era. Among other
distinctions, he made the
pivotal, Nobel-prize
winning discovery with
Edward Tatum that the
role of genes is to
specify proteins. From
1946 to 1960 he led the
Caltech Biology Division,
rebuilding it to a
powerhouse in molecular
biology, and afterwards
became a successful
President of the University
of Chicago. This is the first
biography of a giant of
genetics, written by two
of the field's most
distinguished contribu
tors, Paul Berg and
Maxine Singer.
