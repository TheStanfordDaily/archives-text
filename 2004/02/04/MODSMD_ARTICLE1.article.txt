# Admissions office says 'demonstrated interest' not a factor

### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With college admissions rates dropping across the nation, some
applicants have started trying to get a leg up on the competition by
keeping in close contact with admissions officers — a tactic to
which many schools are receptive — though Dean of Admission
and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet said Stanford is not.
According to the most recent survey of admissions officials by
the National Association for College Admission Counseling,
schools are placing more emphasis than ever on "demonstrated in
terest" — when a student visits or contacts the admissions office —
when making admissions decisions. The survey found that 30 per
cent of the 595 colleges polled considered "demonstrated interest"
to be of moderate or considerable importance in the admissions
process, compared with just 25 percent giving the same weight to
subject tests like ttye SAT II and AP exams and only 19 percent
considering race and ethnicity similarly.
Stanford, however, does not consider "demonstrated interest"
when admitting students, according to Mamlet.
"While we meet and build relationships with thousands of
prospective students each year, we give no preference in the ad
mission process to such students," Mamlet said. "We believe that
the best indication of a student's ability to thrive at Stanford is
through demonstrated excellence during high school and demon
strated effort in our written application rather than what is known
as 'demonstrated interest.' "
Some Stanford students said they agree with the admission de
partment's position on "demonstrated interest."
"I feel like your application should be good enough and any
thing else you send would be unfair," said freshman Elizabeth
Heng.
Others, however, said they felt ignored by the Stanford admis
sions department when they applied.
"Whenever I went into the admissions office or called to ask
questions, they would barely acknowledge me," said freshman
Cynthia Querio. "Other colleges go out of their way to keep in
touch with you, and Stanford's lack of interest in me definitely was
not impressive."
Despite Stanford's policy, some applicants make attempts to
connect with admissions officers anyway.
"During an admission presentation in St. Louis 1 asked a ques
tion that garnered a laugh from the Stanford representative," said
freshman Sarah Douglas. "In my admissions essay, I mentioned
this little anecdote in hopes of endearing myself to the admissions
office. As it turned out, the guy in the anecdote was the one who
read my essay."
