## Don't mock it 'til you try it Mock trial team competes in regionals this weekend 
### CAROLINE CICCONE DESK EDITOR 
A 21-year-old female sits on
the witness stand. The prosecu
tion grills her relentlessly, aiming
to pry out crucial details during
the cross examination. She an
swers the questions with little
emotion, hiding her fear of the
law. There's no way she'll allow
the lawyer to bring her to tears.
No, this isn't a court TV drama
or a real-life case at Santa Clara
County Courthouse. It's Stanford
Mock Trial team practice.
Currently, the team is prepar
ing for regionals this weekend in
Portland, Ore., a competition that
may qualify them for nationals
should they do well. Then, the
team will have until after spring
break to prepare for nationals.

With the recent news that the
ASSU special fees system is on the
verge of bankruptcy, students
have been questioning the impor
tance of many student groups. For
small groups that aren't visible to
the majority of the campus, mem
bers feel the need to defend their
activities to their peers.
The Mock Trial team has en
joyed many successes in the past
couple of years. However, the
group has faced several struggles.
During spring quarter 2002, the
group ran for special fees, but the
student body did not vote to give
them special fees. Due to a com
puter glitch, the votes were not ac
curately tallied. In the end. Mock
Trial received the fees. Since
then, the team has reexamined its
sources of funding.
At many other schools, mock

trial teams are funded by universi
ties and so that may be an option
in the future. Schools that have
strong mock trial teams, such as
UCLA, offer a class for mock trial
in which they receive university
credit.
"Since we compete intercolle
giately for the University, I think
we should be funded by the Uni
versity, just like club sports," said
senior Elizabeth Eraker, who
served as president her sopho
more year.
Team members feel that Mock
Trial is vital to the Stanford com
munity.
"Mock Trial is a unique oppor
tunity because it allows under
graduates to learn about criminal
and civil law, courtroom proce
dure and rules of evidence," said
co-president, senior and future

law student Julia Martinez.
Martinez, junior Chris Bruner
and law student volunteer Dmitry
Bam coach the team. The group
boasts over 30 members and main
tains a large community of former
members who judge competitions,
coach when needed and attend so
cial events.
The Mock Trial team also
reaches out to the community in
the form of an annual high school
symposium.
"For the last two years, Mock
Trial has hosted a Stanford Mock
Trial Symposium, which provides
an opportunity for 150 Bay Area
high school students, some from
underprivileged backgrounds, to
come to Stanford and learn about
mock trial strategy, our justice
system and future careers in law,"
Eraker said. "These students then
take that knowledge back to
share with their high school teams
and their own communities."
Each year, the team must
focus on one case and master all
the angles of it. This year's case is
a murder case.
"During a professional hockey
game two players got into a fight,
one hit the other in the head with
his hockey stick, and the injured
player later died from internal
bleeding in his brain," said Mar
tinez.
"There is a possible alterna
tive explanation to the player's
death because he had a ruptured
brain aneurysm which had also
caused internal bleeding in his
brain. The defendant's possible
motives are that his ex-wife was
dating the player who died, and
the player he killed had recently
been offered a contract fora posi
tion on a hockey team that he had
been hoping to be offered."
Martinez was hopeful that the
team would perform well this up
coming weekend.
"After all our hard work and
preparation, I feel confident that
all three of our teams will do ex
tremely well. With any luck we'll
be sending a team or teams to na
tionals next quarter."
Since the formation of the
team approximately five years
ago, the team has enjoyed in
creased success and rapid growth
in membership. In 2002, one of
the teams placed third at regional
and qualified for the American
Mock Trial Association National
Competition, in which they
placed in the top 15.
Last month, the team attended
an invitational tournament at
UCLA. All of Stanford's teams
finished with strong records, one
receiving sixth place. Team mem
bers Martinez, sophomore Alli
son Dencker and sophomore
Philip Henry won individual
awards for outstanding perfor
mance during the competition.

Each year, the team must
focus on one case and master all
the angles of it. This year's case is
a murder case.
"During a professional hockey
game two players got into a fight,
one hit the other in the head with
his hockey stick, and the injured
player later died from internal
bleeding in his brain," said Mar
tinez.
"There is a possible alterna
tive explanation to the player's
death because he had a ruptured
brain aneurysm which had also
caused internal bleeding in his
brain. The defendant's possible
motives are that his ex-wife was
dating the player who died, and
the player he killed had recently
been offered a contract fora posi
tion on a hockey team that he had
been hoping to be offered."
Martinez was hopeful that the
team would perform well this up
coming weekend.
"After all our hard work and
preparation, I feel confident that
all three of our teams will do ex
tremely well. With any luck we'll
be sending a team or teams to na
tionals next quarter."
Since the formation of the
team approximately five years
ago, the team has enjoyed in
creased success and rapid growth
in membership. In 2002, one of
the teams placed third at regional
and qualified for the American
Mock Trial Association National
Competition, in which they
placed in the top 15.
Last month, the team attended
an invitational tournament at
UCLA. All of Stanford's teams
finished with strong records, one
receiving sixth place. Team mem
bers Martinez, sophomore Alli
son Dencker and sophomore
Philip Henry won individual
awards for outstanding perfor
mance during the competition.

A 21-year-old female sits on
the witness stand. The prosecu
tion grills her relentlessly, aiming
to pry out crucial details during
the cross examination. She an
swers the questions with little
emotion, hiding her fear of the
law. There's no way she'll allow
the lawyer to bring her to tears.
No, this isn't a court TV drama
or a real-life case at Santa Clara
County Courthouse. It's Stanford
Mock Trial team practice.
Currently, the team is prepar
ing for regionals this weekend in
Portland, Ore., a competition that
may qualify them for nationals
should they do well. Then, the
team will have until after spring
break to prepare for nationals.

With the recent news that the
ASSU special fees system is on the
verge of bankruptcy, students
have been questioning the impor
tance of many student groups. For
small groups that aren't visible to
the majority of the campus, mem
bers feel the need to defend their
activities to their peers.
The Mock Trial team has en
joyed many successes in the past
couple of years. However, the
group has faced several struggles.
During spring quarter 2002, the
group ran for special fees, but the
student body did not vote to give
them special fees. Due to a com
puter glitch, the votes were not ac
curately tallied. In the end. Mock
Trial received the fees. Since
then, the team has reexamined its
sources of funding.
At many other schools, mock

trial teams are funded by universi
ties and so that may be an option
in the future. Schools that have
strong mock trial teams, such as
UCLA, offer a class for mock trial
in which they receive university
credit.
"Since we compete intercolle
giately for the University, I think
we should be funded by the Uni
versity, just like club sports," said
senior Elizabeth Eraker, who
served as president her sopho
more year.
Team members feel that Mock
Trial is vital to the Stanford com
munity.
"Mock Trial is a unique oppor
tunity because it allows under
graduates to learn about criminal
and civil law, courtroom proce
dure and rules of evidence," said
co-president, senior and future

law student Julia Martinez.
Martinez, junior Chris Bruner
and law student volunteer Dmitry
Bam coach the team. The group
boasts over 30 members and main
tains a large community of former
members who judge competitions,
coach when needed and attend so
cial events.
The Mock Trial team also
reaches out to the community in
the form of an annual high school
symposium.
"For the last two years, Mock
Trial has hosted a Stanford Mock
Trial Symposium, which provides
an opportunity for 150 Bay Area
high school students, some from
underprivileged backgrounds, to
come to Stanford and learn about
mock trial strategy, our justice
system and future careers in law,"
Eraker said. "These students then
take that knowledge back to
share with their high school teams
and their own communities."
