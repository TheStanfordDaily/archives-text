# Eat, drink and be merry
## Dessert comes first

I remember when I first arrived on campus, I
thought it just a little bit unusual that Stan
ford had its own zip code. And its own post
office. And that the carpool traffic for the
local elementary school was backed up to my
freshman dorm. I began to wonder if Stanford did

own everything; if I would be
trapped in this bubble-like exis
tence for the next four years.
Would I spend all my time
chilling at the CoHo? Would I
consider the Treehouse the hip
spot for Friday night dinner?
Would I only see movies at Flicks,
where paper rocks flew at my
head and where I could barely
hear the lines over some big-

shot's less-than-witty comments?
Worry not, my friends. It's my job and my plea
sure to dispel these fears, to open your eyes to a
whole new world of dining, shopping and social
opportunities out there beyond Palm Drive
(magic carpet ride not included). Yes, we live on
The Farm, but that in no way means we have to
stay in and milk the cows every Saturday after

noon. Even Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie got a
day off once in awhile.
So, now usually comes the complaint: "But I've
been on University Ave., and I can only go to
Starbucks and Pluto's so many times before I turn
into a large-farmer's-greens-salad-with-chicken."
1 know where you're coming from, trust me.
I've even been known to make that comment my
self. But instead of being single-street minded
like the majority of students, I spend my spare
time exploring the nooks and crannies of down
town PA.
Instead of reading my Introduction to the Hu
manities book, I would stop in interesting-looking
restaurants and read their menus. And there's not
just Palo Alto. "Whoa, don't get too crazy now,"
you might say, but it's true. You've got all of
Menlo Park, Redwood City and Mountain View
at your wallet's disposal. Granted, you need a car
for these exotic locales, but think about it. When
were you ever able to bike to your favorite cafe or
movie theater at home?
Face it folks, Palo Alto is not the college town
that you dreamed about. The good stuff is scat
tered, hidden and doesn't place coupons in the

Unofficial Guide to Stanford. That's why I am
here to give you the Unofficial Guide to Get Out
of Stanford.
Since I don't have enough space left to do jus
tice to many of the great finds of Stanford-adja
cent, I will have to leave you with a little teaser.
It's called "Yumi Yogurt." Warning: If you are
not a frozen yogurt fan, do not read on. But if you
love the stuff and can't deal with another foamy
textured flavor at @live, your life just got a little
better.
"Yumi Yogurt" is one of those places that only
gets discovered through word-of-mouth, so in the
past, students had to be lucky enough to know the
right people. That was the only way to hear about
Redwood City's hidden treasure. But now you all
know me.
So, the logistics: After it seems like you've
driven forever on El Camino going north, just go
a bit farther. Then give a little cheer once you pass
"Beverages and More" because you're almost
there. Located on your right side just past "Tacos
el Grullense," this little yogurt hut is home to the
creamiest, smoothest textured fro-yo that I have
ever tasted. Even the health-conscious can in

dulge here: Most flavors are fat-free, but I
promise, you'd never notice if they didn't tell you.
With mouth-watering flavors such as Oreo
Cheesecake, Chocolate Toffee, Peanut Butter
Cookies, Snickers and Pumpkin, you'll never set
tle for plain chocolate again. They don't skimp on
the toppings either — with such a wide variety
you'll have to decide between chocolate chip
cookie dough pieces or circus animal cookies.
However, don't expect to always see your favorite
flavor on the board — I once went there twice
within twenty-four hours and the whole yogurt
lineup had changed.
Another word of caution: The portions are re
ally, really, really big. I'm not joking — a large
comes in a bucket, literally. So if you ever have
spare time to drive 15 minutes into the shadier
part of town, I promise Yumi is worth it.
Until next week, go and explore the side
streets of Palo Alto yourself. You never know
what you may find.

promise, you'd never notice if they didn't tell you.
With mouth-watering flavors such as Oreo
Cheesecake, Chocolate Toffee, Peanut Butter
Cookies, Snickers and Pumpkin, you'll never set
tle for plain chocolate again. They don't skimp on
the toppings either — with such a wide variety
you'll have to decide between chocolate chip
cookie dough pieces or circus animal cookies.
However, don't expect to always see your favorite
flavor on the board — I once went there twice
within twenty-four hours and the whole yogurt
lineup had changed.
Another word of caution: The portions are re
ally, really, really big. I'm not joking — a large
comes in a bucket, literally. So if you ever have
spare time to drive 15 minutes into the shadier
part of town, I promise Yumi is worth it.
Until next week, go and explore the side
streets of Palo Alto yourself. You never know
what you may find.

I remember when I first arrived on campus, I
thought it just a little bit unusual that Stan
ford had its own zip code. And its own post
office. And that the carpool traffic for the
local elementary school was backed up to my
freshman dorm. I began to wonder if Stanford did

own everything; if I would be
trapped in this bubble-like exis
tence for the next four years.
Would I spend all my time
chilling at the CoHo? Would I
consider the Treehouse the hip
spot for Friday night dinner?
Would I only see movies at Flicks,
where paper rocks flew at my
head and where I could barely
hear the lines over some big-

shot's less-than-witty comments?
Worry not, my friends. It's my job and my plea
sure to dispel these fears, to open your eyes to a
whole new world of dining, shopping and social
opportunities out there beyond Palm Drive
(magic carpet ride not included). Yes, we live on
The Farm, but that in no way means we have to
stay in and milk the cows every Saturday after

noon. Even Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie got a
day off once in awhile.
So, now usually comes the complaint: "But I've
been on University Ave., and I can only go to
Starbucks and Pluto's so many times before I turn
into a large-farmer's-greens-salad-with-chicken."
1 know where you're coming from, trust me.
I've even been known to make that comment my
self. But instead of being single-street minded
like the majority of students, I spend my spare
time exploring the nooks and crannies of down
town PA.
Instead of reading my Introduction to the Hu
manities book, I would stop in interesting-looking
restaurants and read their menus. And there's not
just Palo Alto. "Whoa, don't get too crazy now,"
you might say, but it's true. You've got all of
Menlo Park, Redwood City and Mountain View
at your wallet's disposal. Granted, you need a car
for these exotic locales, but think about it. When
were you ever able to bike to your favorite cafe or
movie theater at home?
Face it folks, Palo Alto is not the college town
that you dreamed about. The good stuff is scat
tered, hidden and doesn't place coupons in the

Unofficial Guide to Stanford. That's why I am
here to give you the Unofficial Guide to Get Out
of Stanford.
Since I don't have enough space left to do jus
tice to many of the great finds of Stanford-adja
cent, I will have to leave you with a little teaser.
It's called "Yumi Yogurt." Warning: If you are
not a frozen yogurt fan, do not read on. But if you
love the stuff and can't deal with another foamy
textured flavor at @live, your life just got a little
better.
"Yumi Yogurt" is one of those places that only
gets discovered through word-of-mouth, so in the
past, students had to be lucky enough to know the
right people. That was the only way to hear about
Redwood City's hidden treasure. But now you all
know me.
So, the logistics: After it seems like you've
driven forever on El Camino going north, just go
a bit farther. Then give a little cheer once you pass
"Beverages and More" because you're almost
there. Located on your right side just past "Tacos
el Grullense," this little yogurt hut is home to the
creamiest, smoothest textured fro-yo that I have
ever tasted. Even the health-conscious can in

dulge here: Most flavors are fat-free, but I
promise, you'd never notice if they didn't tell you.
