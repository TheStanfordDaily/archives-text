## Perhaps P*b Night isn't for everyone 
### 
For seniors, P*b night is the place to see and
be seen. Due to the administration's
"crackdown" on alcohol this year and the
unfortunate fact that five percent of the
senior class is under the age of 21, what was once
known as Senior Pub Night has morphed into the
profane looking P*b Night. Apparently, "pub"
must be censored.

Calling my favorite night of the
week P*b Night has led me to ex
perience some emotional trauma.
In checking my e-mail for the lo
cation for the week's event, I
sometimes get confused. Why is
the entire Senior Class participat
ing in an event centered around
peanut butter? Not that I don't
like peanut butter — well, the all
natural, crunchy kind of course —
but still, when I see P*b, I think

PB, peanut butter and peanut butter jelly time.
Speaking of other things I don't like — under
classmen going to P*b Night. Maybe I lived on an
other planet as a freshman, but I didn't even know
these things existed. If I did, and had managed to
finally get myself a fake ID, maybe I would have
gone. But wait, I wouldn't have. I didn't hang out
with seniors, they weren't my friends and getting
wasted in a bar with a bunch of them didn't seem
like my idea of fun. So when I see that familiar
face from my intro psych class hanging at the bar
like they belong there, I can't help but feel a little
miffed.
Sometimes, I get the rare opportunity to call
people out on it. Like the 90 sophomores who
were my residents last year in an all-freshman
dorm. As someone who'd studied the records of
these people and memorized their faces before
they even got to this lovely campus of ours, I know
— they're not 21 and they're not seniors.
So, you get the idea that P*b Night means a lot
to me, right? I think it does fora lot of people.
After all, it's the only campus-sponsored party
that is still acceptable to attend as a senior. I'm
not one for frat parties or the cloud party at
Larkin. Sorry guys. Once you try to keep the cops
out of one, you'll have had enough too.
But what's so different about P*b Night? I still
get beer spilled on me, there's still an unidentified
SAE boy freaking me from behind and some
drunk girl still steps on my new Ferragamo pointy
toed shoe.
Don't get me wrong. There are plenty of things
to love about P*b Night: the ever-present desig
nated driver, the trusty-Marguerite (that's the
only time you'll ever catch a senior on one), a full
bar that doesn't mean the jungle juice and keg
stands at Theta Delt and that friend from fresh
man year who always insists on buying you a drink
every week.
But why mess with a good thing? A week from
Thursday is the senior semi-formal, an event that
feels more like high school homecoming than a
night on the town. Maybe in 15 years I'll be happy
to spend an evening at the Palo Alto Country Club.
But getting a guy in a tie? That's harder than get
ting a Stanford guy to ask you out on a date.
So this week, if you're one of those people that
likes to be seen, I'll see you at TB A. That's my fa
vorite bar. Oh, yours too?

Anna Galan is a senior majoring in communica
tion. She can't wait to see you at P*b Night this
week. She's not usually this bitchy, but she usual
ly edits these columns instead of writing them.
Buy her a drink this Thursday if you liked what
she had to say.
