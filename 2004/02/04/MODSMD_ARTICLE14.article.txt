## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Kerry hasn't won it just yet 
### 
The results are in from yesterday's
Democratic contests: Sen. John
Kerry won the primaries in five
states (Arizona, Delaware, Mis
souri, New Mexico and North Dakota)
while Sen. John Edwards kept the Demo
cratic nomination race alive and competi
tive by clinching South Carolina. Howev
er, the candidate pool is gradually thin
ning: Sen. Joe Lieberman — who was
counting on a strong showing in Delaware,
but garnered less than 11 percent there —
bowed out of the race. Meanwhile, former
front-runner Howard Dean produced dis
appointing performances in all seven
states. Gen. Wesley Clark and Edwards
were tied at 30 percent in Oklahoma, the
results of which will be certified in a week.
Historically, no candidate has ever lost
the nomination after such a strong perfor
mance as Kerry's in these initial phases, and
this gives the Massachusetts senator a clear
advantage. However, the shifting of the Cal
ifornia presidential primary from June to
March this year and the complicated system
in which pledged and un-pledged delegates
participate in the Democratic National
Convention means that little is yet certain.
Students should, therefore, continue to
follow the primaries closely — and note
that the proportion of votes received by a
candidate in a state is what decides the
number of delegates that candidate sends
to the Convention, held in Boston at the
end of July. A candidate may pick up a
number of delegates in a state even if he
does not win overall in that primary. The

populist and upbeat Edwards could close
in on Kerry's lead if he is able to put to
gether strong campaigns in upcoming
states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Dean
may still stand a chance, albeit small, to
fight back in liberal states like California.
California's primary will be held on
Tuesday, March 2. The Golden State has
370 pledged delegates — including 81 at
large delegates and 48 party leaders and
elected officials (PLEOs) — and 69 un
pledged delegates. While the pledged dis
trict-level delegates are aligned with indi
vidual candidates and elected by primary
voters as such, the un-pledged delegates
are potential wild cards. They constitute 20
percent of the total convention delegates
and add to the uncertainty on the conven
tion floor. This is further compounded by
the presence of PLEOs and pledged-at
large delegates in each state, who are cho
sen by the elected district-level delegates.
California's delegate-rich status has
been undermined in the past by the fact
that its primary occurred late in the calen
dar year, long after the front-loaded win
ter primaries were over and much of the
major spending had taken place (for ex
ample, a relatively small state like New
Hampshire is ranked eighth in terms of al
lotted campaign spending). This year,
however, California's voters have a
chance to have their choices help shape
the national political process. Students
should take this opportunity and not sit on
the sidelines, but rather, inform them
selves and make their voices heard.
