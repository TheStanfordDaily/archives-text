## Students should boycott Safeway 
### REED ADAM 
Since last October, 70,000
grocery workers in
Southern California
have been on strike to
protect their health care bene
fits. Their employer Safeway, in
an effort to reduce costs, wants
to severely reduce benefits for
its workers who, on average,
earn $19,000 annually. Despite
the United Food and Commer
cial Workers' (UFCW) offer to
compromise with some of Safe
way's demands, the grocery giant
refuses to continue negotiations,
and thousands of workers are
locked out of their jobs. This
strike has taken a heavy toll on
the workers and their families —
many have been evicted and are
living on $100 dollars a week in
strike benefits. Their battle has
gained wide support from many
community organizations and
local and national labor unions.
Both the larger labor move
ment participants and the
UFCW grocery workers realize
that this strike has national
repercussions. Safeway, a huge

and influential corporation, has
the power to set standards for
businesses all over the country.
Safeway workers, on the other
hand, are fighting to protect the
right of working Americans to
have access to health care for
themselves and their families.
Safeway can afford to pay for its'
workers health care: Its operat
ing profits have risen by 47 per
cent in the last five years. Health
care costs are the company's re
sponsibility, not that of workers
or the overburdened public
health system.
In response to the Safeway
strike and lockout, the national
Student Labor Action Project
(SLAP) has called for Thursday,
Feb. 5 to be a national student
day of action in support of the
grocery workers. They have
called fora boycott of all Safe
way-owned stores, which in
clude Vons, Ralphs and Albert
sons. Although Safeway seems
to dominate the grocery market
in the area near the Stanford
campus, there are a number of
alternatives where students can
shop. These stores include: Trad

er Joes in Menlo Park, Mollie
Stone's and Whole Foods in
Palo Alto, a number of stores in
Redwood City and many small
Mexican and Asian groceries in
East Palo Alto and Mountain
View. SLAP has asked students
to honor the UFCWs call fora
boycott of all Safeway stores
across the nation. This is particu
larly relevant in Northern Cali
fornia, because Safeway will
renegotiate its contract with the
UFCW here in June.
Already, a movement is build
ing in solidarity with workers in
Southern California — but this
is also a movement to send a
message to Safeway that it can
not expect its workers here to
lose their health care without a
fight. The importance of the
Southern California grocery
strike cannot be understated: It
is the heart of the struggle of
working families across America
to keep their health care benefits
and stay out of poverty.
