Decision to make ASSU refund
lists public stirs debate
There's been an awful lot of
kerfuffle about ASSU special
fees refunds over the past few
days, least of all about the re
cent decision to make the re
fund records public. There
have been some arguments
that this move will make stu
dents think twice about re
questing a refund because it
amounts to some sort of public
shaming. After all, the argu
ment goes, if your friends and
peers knew you weren't sup
porting Group X or Organiza
tion Y, there might be — get
this — repercussions.
Personally, I hope there are
repercussions, but I'm more
keen to see groups that don't
tangibly benefit a majority of
the student body have their
appeals for additional funds
denied. When I request my
quarterly refunds, I do so not
in a glib attempt to purchase
more grub; I do so to tell the
organizations that I either
don't support them or that
their services — real or, more
often, perceived — do not
benefit me directly. Stanford
has gads of student groups,
and if they are going to com
pete fora limited amount of
student funds, only the most
worthwhile should succeed.
Sad to say, but if a group gets
its funding pulled because too
many students simply don't
want to give it their money,
then its demise is, in the opin
ion of the student body, of
minimal consequence.
That said, if students don't
want to fund certain groups, or
know that they don't derive
any benefit from them, then
they shouldn't have voted for
them last election cycle. One
can be stingy, but it is best to
also be consistent and not lead
the groups into thinking
they're more popular than they
really are.
WILLIAM E.HUDSON

In response to The Daily's
article on special fees refunds
("ASSU posts names of refund
applicants on line," Feb. 3) we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions.
The ASSU financial manag
er is required by the constitu
tion to provide financial offi
cers of student groups with a
list of all students who request
refunds from their group. This
has been a long-standing prac
tice of the ASSU. This year we
supplied the information to fi

nancial officers online in re
sponse to the feedback that
our previous distribution
method was difficult to use. It
seems one or more of the fi
nancial officers chose to for
ward this information to peo
ple who were not among the
intended recipients. This
method places the responsibil
ity on the financial officers to
utilize the list to the best inter
est of their group.
The purpose of providing
this information is to allow
groups the opportunity to edu
cate refunders about the ser
vices they provide and to with
hold services from those who
have requested refunds if they
chose to do so. It is not in the
purview of the ASSU to police
financial officers on how they
utilize the list. We'll take this
into account as we seek to pro
vide this information to finan
cial officers, as the constitution
mandates, in subsequent years.

Article on apathy
towards sexual assault
misrepresents students
Friday's front-page head
line, "Students apathetic to
sexual assault," (Jan. 30) is an
example of irresponsible and
misleading journalism. Such a
statement should headline an
op-ed piece — not an alleged
news article, because it is not
supported by any solid or sub
stantial evidence.
Sexual assault and rape re
main as prevalent today as in
the past — approximately one
in three females will be sexual
ly assaulted during her college
life. Although Stanford record
ed no rapes or sexual assaults
during 2001, the reality is that
many cases of rape and sexual
assault are not reported. Such
underreporting does not re
flect student apathy, but partly
the inability of the University
to provide an environment in
which students feel safe re
porting such instances. When
students confront issues of sex
ual assault, they undergo an
other process of victimization.
Without the proper resources
and trained personnel to guide
them through the process,
overcoming societal taboos
and personal fear can be over
ly daunting.
Stanford, as the article ex
plicitly states, has many re
sources available for students

dealing with sexual assault, in
cluding at least three organiza
tions that work to prevent sex
ual assault, a women's center, a
24-hour rape hotline and a
week in February devoted to
promoting awareness on rape
and sexual trauma. However,
these resources do not exist be
cause Stanford merely pro
vides them — they are a result
of student activism and dedica
tion to this cause. The above
evidence demonstrates that
The Daily inappropriately la
beled its article. But the article
makes a bigger point: it illus
trates that despite the avail
able resources, enough is not
being done to raise awareness
about sexual assault on the
Stanford campus.
Rather than making unsub
stantiated claims about student
apathy based on the low num
ber of recorded rape cases and
sex offenses, The Daily would
do better to focus on the under
lying causes for such low offi
cial numbers. Sexual assault
and rape are real issues that
conjure much emotional and
political sentiment. Lack of in
formation and an unawareness
of resources is not apathy — it
is evidence that more can and
should be done to inform the
Stanford community that sexu
al assault is a reality on this
campus and to provide the
proper resources for victims of
sexual assault.

Stanford campus.
Rather than making unsub

ber of recorded rape cases and
sex offenses, The Daily would
do better to focus on the under
lying causes for such low offi

and rape are real issues that
conjure much emotional and
political sentiment. Lack of in
formation and an unawareness
of resources is not apathy — it
is evidence that more can and
should be done to inform the
Stanford community that sexu
al assault is a reality on this
campus and to provide the
proper resources for victims of
sexual assault.

Bush can't be "reelected"
While I agree with yester
day's editorial ("Tune in for
Super Tuesday," Feb. 3) in that
being aware of political devel
opments is a crucial aspect of
good citizenship, I hate to have
to remind The Daily's editors
that the current occupant of
the White House is not eligible
to be "reelected," since he was
appointed (or "selected" by
the smallest majority possible)
by the Supreme Court. Accu
racy is an important aspect of
good journalism.

Decision to make ASSU refund
lists public stirs debate
There's been an awful lot of
kerfuffle about ASSU special
fees refunds over the past few
days, least of all about the re
cent decision to make the re
fund records public. There
have been some arguments
that this move will make stu
dents think twice about re
questing a refund because it
amounts to some sort of public
shaming. After all, the argu
ment goes, if your friends and
peers knew you weren't sup
porting Group X or Organiza
tion Y, there might be — get
this — repercussions.
Personally, I hope there are
repercussions, but I'm more
keen to see groups that don't
tangibly benefit a majority of
the student body have their
appeals for additional funds
denied. When I request my
quarterly refunds, I do so not
in a glib attempt to purchase
more grub; I do so to tell the
organizations that I either
don't support them or that
their services — real or, more
often, perceived — do not
benefit me directly. Stanford
has gads of student groups,
and if they are going to com
pete fora limited amount of
student funds, only the most
worthwhile should succeed.
Sad to say, but if a group gets
its funding pulled because too
many students simply don't
want to give it their money,
then its demise is, in the opin
ion of the student body, of
minimal consequence.
That said, if students don't
want to fund certain groups, or
know that they don't derive
any benefit from them, then
they shouldn't have voted for
them last election cycle. One
can be stingy, but it is best to
also be consistent and not lead
the groups into thinking
they're more popular than they
really are.

In response to The Daily's
article on special fees refunds
("ASSU posts names of refund
applicants on line," Feb. 3) we
would like to clarify a few mis
conceptions.
The ASSU financial manag
er is required by the constitu
tion to provide financial offi
cers of student groups with a
list of all students who request
refunds from their group. This
has been a long-standing prac
tice of the ASSU. This year we
supplied the information to fi

nancial officers online in re
sponse to the feedback that
our previous distribution
method was difficult to use. It
seems one or more of the fi
nancial officers chose to for
ward this information to peo
ple who were not among the
intended recipients. This
method places the responsibil
ity on the financial officers to
utilize the list to the best inter
est of their group.
The purpose of providing
this information is to allow
groups the opportunity to edu
cate refunders about the ser
vices they provide and to with
hold services from those who
have requested refunds if they
chose to do so. It is not in the
purview of the ASSU to police
financial officers on how they
utilize the list. We'll take this
into account as we seek to pro
vide this information to finan
cial officers, as the constitution
mandates, in subsequent years.

Article on apathy
towards sexual assault
misrepresents students
Friday's front-page head
line, "Students apathetic to
sexual assault," (Jan. 30) is an
example of irresponsible and
misleading journalism. Such a
statement should headline an
op-ed piece — not an alleged
news article, because it is not
supported by any solid or sub
stantial evidence.
Sexual assault and rape re
main as prevalent today as in
the past — approximately one
in three females will be sexual
ly assaulted during her college
life. Although Stanford record
ed no rapes or sexual assaults
during 2001, the reality is that
many cases of rape and sexual
assault are not reported. Such
underreporting does not re
flect student apathy, but partly
the inability of the University
to provide an environment in
which students feel safe re
porting such instances. When
students confront issues of sex
ual assault, they undergo an
other process of victimization.
Without the proper resources
and trained personnel to guide
them through the process,
overcoming societal taboos
and personal fear can be over
ly daunting.
Stanford, as the article ex
plicitly states, has many re
sources available for students

dealing with sexual assault, in
cluding at least three organiza
tions that work to prevent sex
ual assault, a women's center, a
24-hour rape hotline and a
week in February devoted to
promoting awareness on rape
and sexual trauma. However,
these resources do not exist be
cause Stanford merely pro
vides them — they are a result
of student activism and dedica
tion to this cause. The above
evidence demonstrates that
The Daily inappropriately la
beled its article. But the article
makes a bigger point: it illus
trates that despite the avail
able resources, enough is not
being done to raise awareness
about sexual assault on the
Stanford campus.
