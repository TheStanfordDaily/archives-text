# OP-ED
## Is special fees the best way to make your charitable donation?

Competitive Cheer can have
my money. Wushu, here's
three bucks, go buy yourself
something nice. For the pur
pose of this argument, I'll even give a
few poker chips to the Viennese Ball.
The Great Donation, however, is an
other story.
I agree with yesterday's op-ed
("The special fee boom and bust,"
Feb. 3) by Steve Yelderman and lan
Spiro — a personal initiative and, in
this case, a personal financial initia
tive, is necessary in order to support
diversity at Stanford. In keeping with
this logic, a personal initiative is also
necessary to keep special fees —
which come from the hard-earned
money of our parents, our own pock
ets and our pockets in ten years plus
interest — in hands that have the best
for the campus and our ideals in mind.
So let's look at the ideals running
the machinery of The Great Dona
tion, a proposition for the foundation

of an ASSU mechanism to donate col
lectively to a nonprofit organization.
It is founded on socialist principles.
The word "socialist" does not appear
in any of its advertisements because of
the historical stigmas attached to
word. As Stanford students, though,
we need to recognize that in support
ing a vague and mass-act of philan
thropy like this one, we are certainly
supporting a transfer of wealth. The
socialist principles of this program are
the one thing that is guaranteed to re
main constant if it endures.
Further, donating money does not
absolve you of the responsibility to
perform good deeds in other aspects
of life. This is just a reminder for those
who missed it in Hebrew school.
There are, however, many good rea
sons to donate money to charity.
The first is your personal belief in a
cause. The next is your faith in the or
ganizers and the ideals running the
group's machinery. After that, there is
the sincere desire to help others and to
let the final equation of your life ex

hibit an inequality in favor of good
done over good taken.
It is natural, therefore, to consider
the motives of the organizers with a
project like this. I first thought, "Are
these people just doing this to build
their resumes?" After some ponder
ing, though, 1 began to doubt that the
motives of the organizers are selfish
due to the unique nature of this pro
gram. You could probably get much
more resume clout out of an AIDS
Walk or a Dance-A-Thon. Either way,
personal motives for service are really
none of our business, and please do
not let your decision for ASSU sup
port of The Great Donation be based
on suspicions of self-interest. Feel
free, though, to consider the political
motives behind this.
In the group's ads, Noam Chomsky
is quoted as saying, "The Great Dona
tion is a wonderful and admirable
idea." Of course he would say this. He
is a radical leftist. Chomsky is known
as a libertarian socialist, as are numer
ous punk bands like Chumbawamba. I

do give a lot of credit to the organizers
though. Finding a connection to Noam
Chomsky is pretty impressive. Person
ally, I've been doing all my networking
at Kappa Alpha and will probably
spend this next summer bussing tables.
On its Web site. The Great Dona
tion states, "Similar models exist in
the world outside" and "To this end,
let us not be afraid to outgrow old
modes of student governance, and
dare to think on new lines, as to the fu
ture of our work as students." These
assertions are in reference to acts of
philanthropy conducted by large busi
nesses and the U.S. government. Did
you realize that the U.S. government
gives your money away to help rebuild
countries we've bombed and to try to
make a dent in the nightmare that is
the international AIDS crisis? You
probably did, but you probably don't
think of that aid as your money.
Chances are you don't actively ques
tion the decisions of the politicians
you've elected when it comes to these
things.

The point I'm trying to make here
is that doing good things is not
enough. It is necessary to approach
every aspect of our lives as we do our
Screw Your Roommate dates — with
a critical eye. The vagueness of this
program worries me. And in support
ing The Great Donation, we are not
only outgrowing "old modes of stu
dent governance," we are setting
precedents for other reputable uni
versities and future Stanford students.
We are trusting future student gov
ernments and student bodies. Sure,
our $3 will not go to the program that
the class of 3006 decides on, but as the
Supreme Court and the Taco
Supreme at Taco Bell have shown us,
precedent is key. Once something gets
kicking, it's hard to stop it.
