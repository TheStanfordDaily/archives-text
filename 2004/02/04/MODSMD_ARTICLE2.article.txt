Students packed into the Oak Room in
Tresidder Union to hear and express conflict
ing opinions on gay marriage last night at
Bursting the Bubble's panel discussion enti
tled "U.S. Policy and Same Sex Marriage."
The presentation broached topics ranging
from the religious right to same-sex parenting.
Moderated by Political Science Prof. Morris
Fiorina, the panel included Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan, Director of Campus
Crusade Ron Sanders, freelance journalist Eve
Tushnet and Executive Director of Marriage
Equality of California Molly McKay.
A Unitarian Universalist, McLennan said
that his church has a long history of accepting
homosexual members and advocating for
same-sex marriage rights. Sanders presented
the other side of the religious approach, em
phasizing the role of scripture in determining
the definition of marriage.
"It is hard to prove that homosexual mar
riage would harm others," he said. "The second
question is whether it will harm society, overall.

and it will be an interesting experiment."
The impact gay marriage would have on tra
ditional unions was a common theme through
out the presentation.
"I think it might undermine the structure
of the traditional family," Sanders added.
"We should only call it marriage if it is be
tween a man and a woman. We should give
same-sex couples the same rights, but call it
something else."
Tushnet expressed her opposition to same
sex marriage on the basis that it potentially
would harm children who wouldn't have the
benefit of having both a mother and father.
Specifically, she emphasized that fathers are
playing an increasingly important parental role.
"We say that children don't need both a
mother and a father, but it's not the same, it's
not as good," she said. "Most relationships do
something for society. A union between a man
and a woman does more, which is why it has
been so honored by society."
In response to Tushnet's comments, McKay
said that psychological studies have proven
that children raised by same-sex couples are
just as well-adjusted as those raised in tradi

tional families.
"What's most important in a family is love,
nurture, care and support," McKay said, recall
ing a time when her domestic partner and she
were forced to fill out separate forms upon
reentering the country, acknowledging each
other as legal strangers. "I will not have this be
the case when I have children. I don't want to
have to explain to them why no one recognizes
our relationship."
According to Tushnet, psychological evi
dence initially showed that children were un
harmed by divorce, a conclusion that was
later proved wrong as more data became
available. She said she fears that children
adopted by same-sex couples will follow suit,
even if solid data doesn't yet reflect a nega
tive influence.
When an audience member asked whether
Tushnet thought single parents were unquali
fied to raise children if it was important to
have both parents involved, she responded.
"Saying that single parents can raise children
well isn't saying that it's ideal." She added
