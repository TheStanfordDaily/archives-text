# Panel discusses gay marriage
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Students packed into the Oak Room in
Tresidder Union to hear and express conflict
ing opinions on gay marriage last night at
Bursting the Bubble's panel discussion enti
tled "U.S. Policy and Same Sex Marriage."
The presentation broached topics ranging
from the religious right to same-sex parenting.
Moderated by Political Science Prof. Morris
Fiorina, the panel included Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan, Director of Campus
Crusade Ron Sanders, freelance journalist Eve
Tushnet and Executive Director of Marriage
Equality of California Molly McKay.
A Unitarian Universalist, McLennan said
that his church has a long history of accepting
homosexual members and advocating for
same-sex marriage rights. Sanders presented
the other side of the religious approach, em
phasizing the role of scripture in determining
the definition of marriage.
"It is hard to prove that homosexual mar
riage would harm others," he said. "The second
question is whether it will harm society, overall.

and it will be an interesting experiment."
The impact gay marriage would have on tra
ditional unions was a common theme through
out the presentation.
"I think it might undermine the structure
of the traditional family," Sanders added.
"We should only call it marriage if it is be
tween a man and a woman. We should give
same-sex couples the same rights, but call it
something else."
Tushnet expressed her opposition to same
sex marriage on the basis that it potentially
would harm children who wouldn't have the
benefit of having both a mother and father.
Specifically, she emphasized that fathers are
playing an increasingly important parental role.
"We say that children don't need both a
mother and a father, but it's not the same, it's
not as good," she said. "Most relationships do
something for society. A union between a man
and a woman does more, which is why it has
been so honored by society."
In response to Tushnet's comments, McKay
said that psychological studies have proven
that children raised by same-sex couples are
just as well-adjusted as those raised in tradi

tional families.
"What's most important in a family is love,
nurture, care and support," McKay said, recall
ing a time when her domestic partner and she
were forced to fill out separate forms upon
reentering the country, acknowledging each
other as legal strangers. "I will not have this be
the case when I have children. I don't want to
have to explain to them why no one recognizes
our relationship."
According to Tushnet, psychological evi
dence initially showed that children were un
harmed by divorce, a conclusion that was
later proved wrong as more data became
available. She said she fears that children
adopted by same-sex couples will follow suit,
even if solid data doesn't yet reflect a nega
tive influence.
When an audience member asked whether
Tushnet thought single parents were unquali
fied to raise children if it was important to
have both parents involved, she responded.
"Saying that single parents can raise children
well isn't saying that it's ideal." She added
that while the
adoption process
should depend on
individual chil
dren, it is ordinar
ily best to place

them with heterosexual couples.
For the most part, the speakers agreed that same
sex couples should he extended the same rights of
those heterosexual marriages. Currently, the Federal
Marriage Amendment, endorsed by President George
W. Bush, threatens to do away with civil unions and
domestic partnerships and would codify further limi
tation of these rights.
"The amendment will change the (U.S.] Constitu
tion for the first time to take rights away rather than
give them," McKay said.
Tushnet replied that the existence of the amend
ment reflects the American public's desire to regulate
gay marriage through other branches of the govern
ment besides the courts.
"The whole reason the amendment came about is
because of the less democratic actions taken by the
Supreme Court and state courts," she said.
At the same time, McKay maintained that the ti
tles of domestic partnership and civil union are in
adequate.

"Calling it something different stigmatizes the
group of people," she said, invoking the Brown v.
Board of Education decision that the idea of separate
but equal is inherently unequal. "It's like having water
fountains for white people and colored people. Why
have two systems?"
Addressing the question of whether gay marriage
will undermine or harm traditional institutions,
McLennan said, "The harm that is done to someone
when you say they can't marry the person of their
choice is unconscionable."
Sanders agreed that the politically vocal religious
right is actively hurting the teachings of the Christ
ian gospel by judging people based on their
lifestyles.
"Jesus is the most harsh with religious men who
heap judgment on others," he said.
Fiorina shared statistics demonstrating that in
most surveys a little over half the country disagrees
with the legalization of same-sex marriage, showing
that the movement is gaining speed but has not yet
achieved its goals.
"We are the generation that's going to change
this," McKay said. "This is the civil rights movement
of today. Twenty years from now you'll say you went
to this debate and people will say "What was there to
debate? 1 "

from the religious right to same-sex parenting.
Moderated by Political Science Prof. Morris
Fiorina, the panel included Dean of Religious
Life Scotty McLennan, Director of Campus
Crusade Ron Sanders, freelance journalist Eve
Tushnet and Executive Director of Marriage
Equality of California Molly McKay.
A Unitarian Universalist, McLennan said
that his church has a long history of accepting
homosexual members and advocating for
same-sex marriage rights. Sanders presented
the other side of the religious approach, em
phasizing the role of scripture in determining
the definition of marriage.
"It is hard to prove that homosexual mar
riage would harm others," he said. "The second
question is whether it will harm society, overall.

and it will be an interesting experiment."
The impact gay marriage would have on tra
ditional unions was a common theme through
out the presentation.
"I think it might undermine the structure
of the traditional family," Sanders added.
"We should only call it marriage if it is be
tween a man and a woman. We should give
same-sex couples the same rights, but call it
something else."
Tushnet expressed her opposition to same
sex marriage on the basis that it potentially
would harm children who wouldn't have the
benefit of having both a mother and father.
Specifically, she emphasized that fathers are
playing an increasingly important parental role.
"We say that children don't need both a
mother and a father, but it's not the same, it's
not as good," she said. "Most relationships do
something for society. A union between a man
and a woman does more, which is why it has
been so honored by society."
In response to Tushnet's comments, McKay
said that psychological studies have proven
that children raised by same-sex couples are
just as well-adjusted as those raised in tradi

tional families.
"What's most important in a family is love,
nurture, care and support," McKay said, recall
ing a time when her domestic partner and she
were forced to fill out separate forms upon
reentering the country, acknowledging each
other as legal strangers. "I will not have this be
the case when I have children. I don't want to
have to explain to them why no one recognizes
our relationship."
According to Tushnet, psychological evi
dence initially showed that children were un
harmed by divorce, a conclusion that was
later proved wrong as more data became
available. She said she fears that children
adopted by same-sex couples will follow suit,
even if solid data doesn't yet reflect a nega
tive influence.
When an audience member asked whether
Tushnet thought single parents were unquali
fied to raise children if it was important to
have both parents involved, she responded.
"Saying that single parents can raise children
well isn't saying that it's ideal." She added
that while the
adoption process
should depend on
individual chil
dren, it is ordinar
ily best to place

them with heterosexual couples.
For the most part, the speakers agreed that same
sex couples should he extended the same rights of
those heterosexual marriages. Currently, the Federal
Marriage Amendment, endorsed by President George
W. Bush, threatens to do away with civil unions and
domestic partnerships and would codify further limi
tation of these rights.
"The amendment will change the (U.S.] Constitu
tion for the first time to take rights away rather than
give them," McKay said.
Tushnet replied that the existence of the amend
ment reflects the American public's desire to regulate
gay marriage through other branches of the govern
ment besides the courts.
"The whole reason the amendment came about is
because of the less democratic actions taken by the
Supreme Court and state courts," she said.
At the same time, McKay maintained that the ti
tles of domestic partnership and civil union are in
adequate.

"Calling it something different stigmatizes the
group of people," she said, invoking the Brown v.
Board of Education decision that the idea of separate
but equal is inherently unequal. "It's like having water
fountains for white people and colored people. Why
have two systems?"
Addressing the question of whether gay marriage
will undermine or harm traditional institutions,
McLennan said, "The harm that is done to someone
when you say they can't marry the person of their
choice is unconscionable."
Sanders agreed that the politically vocal religious
right is actively hurting the teachings of the Christ
ian gospel by judging people based on their
lifestyles.
"Jesus is the most harsh with religious men who
heap judgment on others," he said.
Fiorina shared statistics demonstrating that in
most surveys a little over half the country disagrees
with the legalization of same-sex marriage, showing
that the movement is gaining speed but has not yet
achieved its goals.
"We are the generation that's going to change
this," McKay said. "This is the civil rights movement
of today. Twenty years from now you'll say you went
to this debate and people will say "What was there to
debate? 1 "
