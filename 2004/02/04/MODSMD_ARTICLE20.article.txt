## Chan Ho, Ho Ho Kam and Corona: Dan's spring fling 
### 
This column began as a complaint.
As high-larious and well-informed
as The Daily's sports pages have
been of late — what with the
misidentification of Leon Lett (come on,
people, he was the butt of the greatest hus
tle play in Super Bowl history) and the
mocking of our beloved President's cheer
leading abilities (you hate Bush, we get it,
move on) — 1 have heard more coherent
and humorous sports opinions from the
greeter at Wal-Mart. So with that, I'm
preparing to add myself to the list of great
sports names like Peerless Price, Lawyer
Milloy, God Shammgod and the immortal
Archi Cianfrocco.
Since February is upon us, that brings us

back to the most important
time of the year: No, not
the travesty that is Valen
tine's Day, but baseball
season. More specifically,
spring training, the month
long period when players
report to camps in Phoenix
and Tampa to work out in
preparation for the regular
season.
Ill never forget the day

that I first fell in love with spring training.
Last year in Tempe, at a Giants-Diamond
backs game, I was sitting down the leftfield
line watching Giants reliever Felix Ro
driguez, goat of the 2002 World Series,
throw long toss.
Now, baseball fans — with the obvious
exception of Cubs fans, who are either
hopeless romantics or hopelessly self
loathing— are notoriously unforgiving.
The home crowd started to ride Rodriguez a
little. And by "a little," what I mean to say is
that the phrase "suck like a Thai hooker"
was used more than once. Finally, one
sweaty, shirtless man stood up and
screamed, "Rodriguez, give us back Game
6!" The imperturbable professional athlete
then turned around, and in no uncertain
terms, told the guy to go violate himself.
Five seconds later, a poorly thrown cup of
beer sailed onto the field, and then a couple
of lazy-looking security guards came down
to escort this loaf off the premises. He'd still
earned the crowd's support, though, and his
parting wave to the masses was met with
cheers.
It was then that I knew I'd returned
to Elysium.
Arizona in February is great, too. Let me
digress fora second about Phoenix. Until
the end of January, the desert shuts down to
40 degrees, and there's nothing to do.
Around April 1, the sun suddenly moves
about 50 percent closer to the Earth and
does all it can to bake human civilization out
of existence.
People sit around and sweat like Patrick
Ewing in a rubber suit in between "refresh
ing" dips in their 90-degree pools. But for
one brief month-and-a-half period, it's 80
degrees and sunny every day.
The marquee players are relaxed and
actually willing to talk to fans, the club
house is full of fresh-faced rookies ready
for their "breakout season," and the sta
diums are cozy, warm and full of cheap
beer and sunshine.
This, of course, translates to the fact that
Barry Bonds will be leaving in the fourth in
ning to make his tee time, and that the game
will be played out by 20-year-old college
draftees who swing like Jerry's Kids. But
still, bleacher seats are two dollars, so all is
right with the world. If you want, you can sit
on the slope behind the leftfield wall for
free, and you might even catch a home run
ball or two — or three if Chan Ho Park is
pitching.
So there's a lot to be said for spring train
ing in Arizona. It's about the farthest you'll
ever be from the soul-sucking letdown that
is Yankee baseball, it's cheap and it's laid
back. You've got time to hang out in the
stands and discuss the finer points of the
game, like the wide variety of salacious dou
ble entendres spawned from baseball terms.
If first base is making out and third is
oral, then we all know the definition of a
balk: She's passed out; take your base. Let's
not even get started on "broken bat" or
"pinch hitter." Needless to say, the possibil
ities are endless.
So, get started on packing up your Corol
la with Corona and get on with your spring
break road trip, and in 15 short hours you'll
be in baseball heaven. It's cheaper than
Cabo, and you probably won't come back
with a rash. So, all things considered, is
there a better all-around sports experience
than soaking up skin cancer in Ho Ho Kam
Park with a beer, watching the Cubbies
lose? I submit that there is not.
