### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
While the No. 2 Stanford men's bas
ketball team survived a pair of scares on
its annual Oregon road trip, No. 12 Ari
zona was not so lucky during its Wash
ington swing, getting blown out by Wash
ington on Thursday.
Stanford (18-0, 9-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) trailed Oregon State (8-11, 2-7) by
seven in the first half on Thursday, but bat
tled back fora 62-48 win. The Cardinal
trailed Oregon (10-6, 5-4) by 19 in the sec
ond half two days later, but rallied for an
83-80 win.
Arizona (14-4,6-3) rolled into Seattle on
Thursday ranked ninth nationally, only to
be shown up by the smallest guy on the
court. The Huskies' 5-foot-8 Nate Robin
son torched the Wildcats fora career-high
31 points on 11 -of-15 shooting, leading his
team to a 93-86 upset.
Washington (9-8, 4-5) turned the tables
on an unsuspecting Arizona team in every
conceivable way — including throwing an
alley-oop to Robinson fora clean two
handed slam dunk.
The Wildcats were effective on offense,
shooting 52 percent from the field, but their
defense and ball-handling were lacking.
The Huskies forced 21 turnovers and were
able to launch 26 3-point attempts.
Will Conroy had 19 points and Brandon
Roy 14 to aid Robinson, while Arizona got
19 from Hassan Adams, 17 from Andre
Iguodala and 16 from Salim Stoudamire. A
miffed Lute Olson played only seven Wild
cats all game.
Washington, which opened Pac-10 play
with five straight losses, won its fourth
straight by defeating Arizona State (8-10,2-
7) on Saturday, 90-81, for its first weekend
sweep of the Arizona schools in five years.
Tre Simmons came off the bench fora
career-high 21 points to pace the Huskies,
who also got 17 from Conroy and 15 from
Roy. Ike Diogu led the Sun Devils with 23
points. Five technical fouls were called in
the game, and it took Arizona State 4:57 be
fore they scored their first points.
Arizona, meanwhile, almost did the un

thinkable on Saturday — namely, drop a
game to Washington State (9-10, 3-6). The
Cougars tied the game at 44 and then at 53,
before Channing Frye's late jumper gave
the Wildcats a 61-57 win in Pullman.
Marcus Moore broke loose for the first
time in weeks, torching Arizona for 29
points on 12-of-19 shooting, including five
treys. The Wildcats were led by Frye's 17
points, and Iguodala added 15 rebounds
and 10 points.
The Cougars, for their part, were coming
off a 63-56 win over the reeling Sun Devils.
Jeff Varem led the way with 17 points, while
Moore scored all of his 12 in the final 11
minutes of the game as the Cougars erased
Arizona State's 26-23 halftime lead. Diogu
managed only 13 points for the Sun Devils,
who had nowhere else to turn. Arizona
State attempted a mere 36 field goals, large
ly because the Sun Devils turned the ball
over 24 times.
Oregon defeated California (9-9,5-4) on
Thursday, 68-56, using a balanced effort.
Luke Jackson led the way with 17 points
and five assists. Cal got 17 from freshman
Marquise Kately and 12 from Leon Powe,
but made only one 3-pointer, while Oregon
made six and controlled the boards, 31-24.
Cal rebounded and Oregon State didn't,
as the Golden Bears beat the Beavers on
Saturday, 88-74. David Lucas had an excel
lent game for the hosts, totaling 25 points
and nine rebounds on 8-of-12 shooting.
Center Amit Tamir hit 6-of-10 from down
town for the Bears, who got 20 points and
14 boards from Powe, who made 10-of-16
free throws. Cal shot 54 percent to Oregon
State's 43 percent.
In a rare Wednesday game. Southern
California (9-9, 4-5) defeated tumbling
rival UCLA (9-8, 5-4), 76-69. The Trojans
held a commanding 44-24 lead at halftime.
The indomitable Desmon Farmer led
the Trojans with 28 points on 11-of-21
shooting, while Errick Craven tossed in 18
points off the bench, going an interesting 6-
of-9 from the field, 3-of-6 from 3-point
range and 3-of-10 from the free-throw line.
For the Bruins, Ryan Hollins made 7-of
-8 shots and 7-of-9 foul shots en route to a

career-high 21 points and
eight boards.
Things only got worse for
UCLA, which played an unusual
out-of-conference game on Satur
day in New York. St. John's, on the
verge of setting a school record for
consecutive losses, blew out the
Bruins, 71-55.
Elijah Ingram made five threes

in the first half alone en route to a
game-high 21 points for the Red
Storm (5-13), which remains the
only team without a win in Big
East Conference play.
Ingram and his teammates com
bined to shoot only 44 percent
from the floor and 41 percent from
the free-throw line.
No matter, though — UCLA
shot just 41 percent from the floor
and 27 percent from the line.
Trevor Ariza led the way with 19
points for the Bruins despite miss
ing all five of his foul shots.
