# Haryasz injures ankle in practice; status uncertain
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Matt Haryasz's time in the starting
spotlight may have dimmed prematurely.
Yesterday, Stanford's frontcourt ab
sorbed another hit when the 6-foot-10
sophomore went down during the early
minutes of practice during what looked to
be a routine drill.
Haryasz hit the floor immediately and
was visibly in pain as he groaned and
pointed toward his right ankle.

Stanford trainer Andrew Tai later re
moved Haryasz's shoe and helped him
off the floor with the assistance of a
team manager.
The injury to Haryasz couldn't have
come at a worse time for No. 2 Stanford
(18-0, 9-0 Pacific-10 Conference), which
lost starting forward Justin Davis to in
jury last Thursday against Oregon State
and will face two of the Pac-10's most
competitive teams this week in Arizona
State and Arizona.
Moreover, the Sun Devils and the

Wildcats boast two of the more dominat
ing centers in the conference — sopho
more Ike Diogu and senior Channing
Frye, respectively.
Haryasz was seen after practice on
crutches with his ankle tightly wrapped.
Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery called the injury a sprained ankle
that was "swollen" but wouldn't elabo
rate any further on Haryasz's condition.
Citing a student privacy policy, the
Stanford Department of Athletics de
clined to comment and Haryasz had no

comment as well.
Haryasz made his first career start in
Davis's absence during Saturday's game
against Oregon at Mac Arthur Court and
contributed 19 points and seven rebounds
as the Cardinal came back from a 19-
point deficit to defeat the Ducks.
Like last season, Davis again suffered
an injury to his left knee — a partial tear
to his medial collateral ligament, which
sidelined him for five games.
