# Women's tennis favored at Indoors
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a record six titles and 11 finals appearances at
the USTA/ITA National Team Indoors Champi
onships, the No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team (3-0) is
seeded first and expected to dominate the prestigious 16-
team playing field beginning on Thursday.
Stanford is especially set on redemption after falling
short in the semifinals for two consecutive years. The
Cardinal lost to No. 3 California last year and No. 4
Georgia in 2002.
Both times, the battles waged by the Cardinal ended
achingly close, 4-3, in the opponents' favor.
"There's a frenzy to the atmosphere," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood. And with good reason â€” this
year's championship will feature the singles champions
from the last four national tournaments: Stanford's
Amber Liu (2003 NCAA), Georgia's top-ranked Agata
Cioroch (2002-2003 ITA National Indoor) and Califor
nia's No. 2 Raquel Kops-Jones (2003 Riviera/ITA All-
American),
Admission to the tournament is based on preseason
rankings, which in turn are based on last year's match
play performance. This year, eight of the top 10 teams in
the nation are seeking the title at Wisconsin's A.C.
Nielsen Tennis Stadium.
Unfortunately missing from the 2004 Indoors
lineup are two potent rivals, top-ranked Florida
and No. 9 Duke.
"Florida is not totally healthy, and Duke is injured as
well," Forood said. "Some teams feel it's early to be com
peting [in such a hard-fought tournament] when there
are injuries."
Duke won last year's Indoors title, and Florida
edged out the Cardinal in last year's NCAA Champi
onships, 4-3.
"We will go into the tournament looking to win it
because the intimidation and respect of [other] teams
begin now," said junior Erin Burdette, ranked sev
enth nationally.
Stanford's opening match on Thursday is against un
seeded, No. 14 William and Mary. The two teams met

last year in regular match play, with the Cardinal posting
a 5-2 victory over the Tribe.
Playing in the top singles slot, Liu, then a freshman,
pulled out a three-set win over No. 57 Candice Fuchs, 6-
2,4-6,6-4.
Liu is currently unranked after deciding to devote the
fall season to competing in the professional circuit.
"1 think the girls on the pro tour are a level above

the college girls," said Liu, who was ranked third in
the nation last season. "Just getting that experience to
play against them has made me work harder to im
prove and given me a sense of composure to play in
the bigger matches."
Overall, Liu went 33-10 in her first year playing colle
giate tennis. She lost at the 2003 Indoors tournament to
