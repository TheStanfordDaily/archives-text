# Men's tennis hopes to set tone at Indoors

After giving Hawaii a sound thrashing last Tuesday and improving
their record to 2-0 for the season, the No. 5 Stanford men's tennis
team is ready to hit the courts Thursday at the USTA / ITA Nation
al Team Indoor Championships in Seattle, Wash.
"This tournament sets the tone for the whole season," said head coach
Dick Gould. "It gives us a chance to see how we stand with other teams in the
country. Next to the NCAA, it's the next important tournament we play."
Stanford will begin the first round at 8 a.m. The invitational hosts the
top teams in the nation.
Unlike most other tournaments this year, the players will be compet
ing as a team in each round, forgoing individual mention in favor of team
recognition. Each round that a team plays will be treated like a dual
match, and the school that wins the match moves on to the next bracket.
"Everyone is guaranteed three matches," Gould said. "The two un
beaten teams play each other in the final. If we win, then we play the win
ner in the bracket next to us. If we lose, we play the loser of that match.
All [matches] are based on the brackets."
Even though each team has three chances to play, two of those match
es could take place in the consolation draw.
"It's a dual match tournament, [so] we start out with three doubles
matches followed by six singles," Gould said. "There is one exception in this
tournament: They will stop the matches when one team gets four points."
The 16-team tournament will consist of four rounds. The teams were
invited based on their rankings in the ITA poll, with each of the eight re
gions in the nation carrying two representatives in the tournament.
"This is a really important tournament for us," Gould said. "Of course the
most important is the NCAA championship at the end of the year, but on the
other hand it is a national championship. Almost all the top teams are there."
The team to beat tomorrow will be No. 13 Texas. The Longhorns are 5-
1 this season, having lost their last match against Arkansas, 4-3. Their head
coach, Michael Center, was a volunteer assistant for one year on the Farm.
"They have always been a good team, but we haven't played them
fora long time in competition, either individually or otherwise,"
Gould said. "I don't know any guys on the team. It's an unknown."
Should Stanford defeat Texas, they will next face the winner of the
match between No. 12 Cal and No. 4 Vanderbilt. Cal has not played any
dual matches so far in the spring season, while Vanderbilt has racked up
three straight 7-0 wins over its opponents.
Some of Stanford's players are trying to bounce back from injury.
"KC Corkery has had a sore knee, hip and neck fora while, but his
shoulder is the biggest concern right now," Gould said. "We're playing
early in the morning and it can be cold at that time of day, so he's got to
be really careful of himself. The primary thing is not to get hurt worse.

"[Sam) Warburg twisted his knee a little in practice last week and was
slowed down a little bit because of that, but he's had the weekend to re
cover," Gould added.
Illinois is seeded No. 1 after taking home the championship last year,
while Baylor. Florida, Vanderbilt and Stanford fill out the top five spots.
Stanford has participated in the Indoors 28 times, a tournament
record, taking home the championship trophy 12 times, also a record.
Stanford last won the championship in 2002.
The team will return to the Farm on Saturday or Sunday, depending
on how well they fare throughout the tournament.
