# Opinion: Determining what is and is not a sport
## 
### JON MARTHALER MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS —Over the past few
years I've noticed a trend: People seem to be getting
more confused about what is and what is not a sport.
Lately the general inclination has been to classify any
thing that takes some skill and some daring as a sport.
It's a dim-witted development in the sports world, and
one I intend to fight against (or at least rail against in
print).
Somewhere along the line, we got "doing something
difficult" and "sport" confused. No, 1 can't drive as fast
as Michael Schumacher without crashing. I also can't
graph a cubic polynomial in my head like a great math
ematician or pick stocks like Warren Buffet. And yet
nobody wears their Berkshire Hathaway jersey to work
on casual Friday, earning a reprimand from their boss
who believes businessmen should wear suits at all
times, even in the shower.
There's a whole category of activities that focus on
skills but get thrown into the "sports" category because
people like to watch them. At the head of the line here
is golf, which is essentially nothing more than a special
ized skill. But it's fun to watch (Well, the Masters, the
U.S. Open Cup and the Ryder Cup are fun each year to
watch — the other 49 and one-half weeks a year, it's
mostly just a great way to put yourself to sleep).
Directly behind golf is auto racing and any other
sport that involves racing some kind of vessel, whether
it's a car, a sailboat or a horse. (Horse racing and auto
racing are essentially the same thing, except a car is less
likely to poop on your foot).
Auto racing takes a lot of skill, and it's kind of fun to
hear the Kentucky Derby announcer scream "And
down the stretch they come!" as if the world depended
on it, but it doesn't make either activity a sport. I don't

care how difficult it is to successfully pilot a car around
a turn at 200 miles per hour. I don't care how dangerous
it is either.
There's a host of other things shown on ESPN2 in
the middle of the day that aren't sports either. Trick
shot pool contests aren't a sport, though they're en
joyable to watch. Again, the whole activity is just a
specialized bar-trick skill. The same goes for regular
billiards and pool, which aren't nearly as much fun
to watch.
About the only other thing more boring than a bil
liards match is bowling, the horse tranquilizer of day
time sports television.
I don't know why the U.S. government hasn't been
torturing the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detainees with
taped bowling matches. After about two hours, I'd be
willing to renounce my citizenship in exchange fora re
mote control or maybe a bullet in the head. Just the
boredom doesn't take it off the "sport" list, though:
Bowling, too, is a glorified skill, not a sport.
Anybody who says poker is a sport is an idiot, and
no, I can't figure out why it's on ESPN five times each
day. I suppose it's interesting to watch and cheap for the
network to produce, but if that's the only barrier to
making the air, why doesn't ESPN show syndicated re
runs of "Dennis the Menace" in the morning?
Put it this way: If poker is a sport, then playing slots
is a sport. If auto racing is a sport, then driving to Madi
son, Wis., on Interstate 94 is a sport (and, judging by the
peculiarities of the typical Wisconsin driver during my
one trip there, both are done at approximately the same
speed). I could think up similar comparisons all day, but
let's not beat a dead horse here (beating a dead horse
being only one step removed from horse racing).
If what those people are doing at the slots (and on
the freeway, or at the track) is a "sport," then I don't
want to be a "sports" fan any more.
