# Opinion: Colorado rape shield law unfair to Bryant
## 
### LA TOYA VAUGHN THE SHORTHORN 
(U-WIRE) ARLINGTON, Texas — Kobe
Bryant is innocent until proven guilty, but he may not
get a fair trial because Colorado's rape shield law
may turn evidence supporting his case against him.
The evidence of someone else's blood and semen
is clearly an element in defending Bryant from sexu
al assault charges. But how can Bryant have a fair
chance when the evidence that supports his defense
is used against him due to the rape shield law?
This law determines a sexual assault victim's sex
ual history irrelevant, but the shield can be lifted if
the victim's history is evidence of whether the act was
or wasn't committed by the defendant.
According to Denver defense attorney Jeralyn
Merrit, once the prosecutors introduce the charges to
the court, Bryant has a right to show that he didn't
commit the act of force.
Even though the woman said she had sex with her
boyfriend two or three days prior to her encounter
with Bryant, it seems difficult to take the alleged de
mands as credible evidence when someone else's
semen and blood were found in her underwear. De
fense lawyer Pamela Mackey asked the question
whether or not th<; injuries associated with this case
are from just Bryant or Bryant and other parties.
Prosecutors find it inappropriate to bring up the
woman's sexual history, but when the allegation of

sexual assault is claimed, it is very appropriate. Ath
letes have always dealt with women who make ad
vances toward them and then cry rape for reasons of
publicity, financial gain, and in some cases racial con
spiracies. So let's rule out all possibilities other than
mere facts.
If Bryant is guilty, it would make sense if the evi
dence were against him. Well, it appears to be against
him, but the prosecutors are attempting to keep the
defense from using the evidence while holding the ac
cuser's cry of rape as the only credit toward the truth.
In the earlier stages of this accusation the woman
made it clear that she did not want money. She want
ed him to be held accountable for what he allegedly
did. Further, on May 30, 2003, before the alleged
rape, the accuser had attempted suicide, which has
caused the defense team to ask whether the accuser
is simply doing this for publicity. It is also peculiar
that Bryant was not notified of the court ordered
warrant compelling him to submit a forensic physical
examination and allowing the detectives to search
his room.
The detectives told Bryant that it did not matter
whether he consented or not, and it has become an
issue for the defense to handle.
The girl's sexual activity is a weak element in the
eyes of the prosecution. But in the case of Bryant, the
girl's promiscuity is the key factor in proving Bryant's
innocence, but who's to say that the charges are not a
conspiracy?
