# Senior Aaron Levine to compete for SportsCenter slot on new reality show
## 
### ANTHONY HA CAMILLE RICKETTS EDITORIAL STAFF 
This spring, senior Aaron Levine will be competing on ESPN's
new reality show "Dream Job." If he beats 11 other finalists,
Levine will receive a one-year contract to join the network as a
Sports Center anchor.
The finalists were selected from a national pool of 10,000 appli
cants. The three rounds of auditions lasted for three months and in
cluded producing a highlight reel, delivering a sports story and per
forming a mock interview with an athlete or broadcaster.
"It really wasn't intimidating," Levine said of his interview with
broadcaster Charley Steiner. "I just had a bunch of adrenaline run
ning through me the whole time, it was so much fun. Right after the
interview, I called my parents and told them that was the coolest
thing I've ever done."
Levine, an Italian major, was actually rejected from the show's
Los Angeles casting call before being accepted in San Francisco.
His previous sports reporting experience includes internships at
Fox Sports News and the Los Angeles Daily News sports section,
serving as the play-by-play announcer for women's volleyball at
KZSU and writing and editing at The Daily for more than three
years.
"Honestly, I think that what is going to help me the most is my
work ethic and preparation," Levine said. "I don't think people re
alize how much preparation goes into anchoring a show — these
guys write their own stuff and collect their own information. So
they basically write the show for eight hours before they go on the
air."
"Dream Job" premieres on Feb. 22, and it will put Levine
through tests such as sideline reporting, anchoring, play-by-play

and one-on-one interviews. Each week, four judges and the na
tional audience — whose electronic votes will serve as a fifth judge
— will vote one or two contestants off the show.
Levine has stopped out for winter quarter, but — unless he wins
— he plans to return to Stanford in the spring.
"Aaron's exploits at The Daily have already earned him leg
endary status, and being on ESPN will only add to that," said Mark
Thoma, managing editor of The Daily's Sports department.
