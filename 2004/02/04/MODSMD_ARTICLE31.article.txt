## Bowling Green students run T-shirt company out of basement 
### ADAM WRIGHT THE BG NEWS 
(U-WIRE) BOWLING GREEN, Ohio —Five times a
week, Andy Lyon sits on his kitchen counter, eating a bag of
potato chips. Suddenly his roommate, Mike Young, runs into
the kitchen from his basement bedroom.
Their eyes lock. Mike grabs some of Andy's chips.
Their meeting begins.
"We have 80 to 90 percent of our meetings while snacking on
chips in the kitchen," Andy said. "(Mike] probably thinks that's
all I eat."
Mike, 22, and Andy, 21, are similar to most college students
at Bowling Green State University. They go to the majority of
their classes, they party on the weekends and they are both un
sure about what to do after graduation.
But Mike and Andy are not like most college students. To
gether they created an online T-shirt company, Shamplade.com,
that has earned over $2,000 in the last three months.
The potato chip meetings, where Mike and Andy discuss de
sign ideas, have become an essential part of their lives.
"I have to buy like 12 bags of chips a week just to keep up with
Shamplade," Andy said jokingly. "Mike's like, 'Hey, we have to
have a meeting.' and I'm like. Well hey, then I have to go to the
grocery store."'
Since its inception on Oct.l, 2003, Shamplade.com has sold
funny, vintage style T-shirts all across the United States, Cana
da and the United Kingdom.
Their designs, with 1970s style lettering and cheeky humor,
have become a huge success with their customers who tend to
buy multiple shirts at a time.
"People buy two to three shirts at pnee," Mike said. "That
means they're happy with our humor. They're buying our
whole line."
In addition to the five T-shirt designs Shamplade.com cur
rently has in stock, the online company also sells assorted color
wristbands. The most popular shirt, a tribute to people with
asthma, carries the phrase "Fo' Sheezy, I'm Weezy" hovering
over the name of the fake organization United Asthmatics of
America with an inhaler in the middle. The shirt was created by
Andy, who has asthma.
"I had to make a shirt for my fellow asthmatics," he said.
Just by looking at them, one would not expect Mike and
Andy to be the heads of an online company.
Mike, with his toned physique, bronze skin and spiky hair,
looks more like someone you would want to do a keg stand with
instead of buy a T-shirt from, and Andy, with his made-to-look
messy blond hair, black wristband and skinny body, has a surfer
meets-alternative-rocker appearance.
Even the house they live in. with two olive green and bright
orange 1970s style couches, a bar that Mike and Andy made and
a room with a long wooden table in it — devoted entirely to
playing beer pong — gives a completely different picture to the
two hardworking entrepreneurs who are making a small fortune
before even starting their careers.
That is probably what makes Shamplade.com's T-shirts so
marketable. Mike and Andy are just having fun and the prod
ucts they make are a reflection of that.
"I treat it more like a game than a business," Mike said.

"Some people go home and play their Playstation and 1 think
that's totally cool, but I get more enjoyment out of playing my
own game. When you win, you don't get a text on the screen that
(lashes 'winner,' you get a paycheck. You see T-shirt sales."
Mike and Andy run Shamplade.com right out of Mike's bed
room in the basement of their house that they share with three
other friends. While their roommates are not involved in the
business, they, like all of Mike and Andy's friends, still try to give
suggestions for T-shirt designs.
"It's funny because now everyone has the best design idea,"
Andy said. "They're all like, 'Dude, make a T-shirt that says this.
That would be hilarious.'"
Shamplade.com headquarters is rather fitting for the cool yet
comical style of its T-shirts. With a 6 foot, black and white check
ered ceiling, a black leather couch, dim lighting and full bath
room, the bedroom/office looks like someone threw the inside
of a New York City apartment into their shabby wood-paneled
basement.
A giant map of the United States pinpointing the locations of
all their online T-shirt sales covers most of the wall above the
couch. Whenever they look at the map, Mike and Andy still can
not believe their sudden success.
"We're a no-name company and people are willing to pay
money for our shirts," Mike exclaimed. "I've never met these
people and they're wearing shirts that Andy and I created. That
just blows my mind every time they do it."
Mike and Andy should not be so surprised. They are both
full-time students. Mike has a part-time job as a webmaster for
Toledo.com and Andy is the webmaster for the University's
School of Art Web site. They split what little free time they have
into having fun and maintaining their business — so both are
reaping the rewards of their hard work.
They also have a very strong friendship, which helps in a busi
ness where they could lose hundreds of dollars.
"I know I can count on [Andy]," Mike said. "You have to
have trust. If you don't have trust it's not going to work out. I
trust Andy."
The friendship Mike and Andy share began freshman year
when they were roommates in Harshman-Dunbar. They be
came fast friends and constantly discussed inventions and other
ways to make money.
"We always thought of crazy ways to make money online,"
Andy explained. "It's funny that four years later it finally came
true."
The two entrepreneurs decided to make T-shirts during one
of their conversations on how to make money. After friends
bought 20 shirts of their first design — a green shirt with the
words "I Eat Vegans" above a tomato — they understood their
potential products and Shamplade.com was born.
The name of their company came after Mike mispronounced
the word lampshade while discussing with the former owners of
their off-campus house all the items they left behind in the attic.
Now that they had their idea, they needed to find a way to
make their T-shirts stand out from those sold at other online
companies.
"There's a lot of websites that sell shirts with beer and naked
chicks," Andy said. "Anyone can make T-shirts like that. We're
trying to be more unique. A different style that I think people
appreciate."

The name of their company came after Mike mispronounced
the word lampshade while discussing with the former owners of
their off-campus house all the items they left behind in the attic.
Now that they had their idea, they needed to find a way to
make their T-shirts stand out from those sold at other online
companies.
"There's a lot of websites that sell shirts with beer and naked
chicks," Andy said. "Anyone can make T-shirts like that. We're
trying to be more unique. A different style that I think people
appreciate."
(U-WIRE) BOWLING GREEN, Ohio —Five times a
week, Andy Lyon sits on his kitchen counter, eating a bag of
potato chips. Suddenly his roommate, Mike Young, runs into
the kitchen from his basement bedroom.
Their eyes lock. Mike grabs some of Andy's chips.
Their meeting begins.
"We have 80 to 90 percent of our meetings while snacking on
chips in the kitchen," Andy said. "(Mike] probably thinks that's
all I eat."
Mike, 22, and Andy, 21, are similar to most college students
at Bowling Green State University. They go to the majority of
their classes, they party on the weekends and they are both un
sure about what to do after graduation.
But Mike and Andy are not like most college students. To
gether they created an online T-shirt company, Shamplade.com,
that has earned over $2,000 in the last three months.
The potato chip meetings, where Mike and Andy discuss de
sign ideas, have become an essential part of their lives.
"I have to buy like 12 bags of chips a week just to keep up with
Shamplade," Andy said jokingly. "Mike's like, 'Hey, we have to
have a meeting.' and I'm like. Well hey, then I have to go to the
grocery store."'
Since its inception on Oct.l, 2003, Shamplade.com has sold
funny, vintage style T-shirts all across the United States, Cana
da and the United Kingdom.
Their designs, with 1970s style lettering and cheeky humor,
have become a huge success with their customers who tend to
buy multiple shirts at a time.
"People buy two to three shirts at pnee," Mike said. "That
means they're happy with our humor. They're buying our
whole line."
In addition to the five T-shirt designs Shamplade.com cur
rently has in stock, the online company also sells assorted color
wristbands. The most popular shirt, a tribute to people with
asthma, carries the phrase "Fo' Sheezy, I'm Weezy" hovering
over the name of the fake organization United Asthmatics of
America with an inhaler in the middle. The shirt was created by
Andy, who has asthma.
"I had to make a shirt for my fellow asthmatics," he said.
Just by looking at them, one would not expect Mike and
Andy to be the heads of an online company.
Mike, with his toned physique, bronze skin and spiky hair,
looks more like someone you would want to do a keg stand with
instead of buy a T-shirt from, and Andy, with his made-to-look
messy blond hair, black wristband and skinny body, has a surfer
meets-alternative-rocker appearance.
Even the house they live in. with two olive green and bright
orange 1970s style couches, a bar that Mike and Andy made and
a room with a long wooden table in it — devoted entirely to
playing beer pong — gives a completely different picture to the
two hardworking entrepreneurs who are making a small fortune
before even starting their careers.
That is probably what makes Shamplade.com's T-shirts so
marketable. Mike and Andy are just having fun and the prod
ucts they make are a reflection of that.
"I treat it more like a game than a business," Mike said.

"Some people go home and play their Playstation and 1 think
that's totally cool, but I get more enjoyment out of playing my
own game. When you win, you don't get a text on the screen that
(lashes 'winner,' you get a paycheck. You see T-shirt sales."
Mike and Andy run Shamplade.com right out of Mike's bed
room in the basement of their house that they share with three
other friends. While their roommates are not involved in the
business, they, like all of Mike and Andy's friends, still try to give
suggestions for T-shirt designs.
"It's funny because now everyone has the best design idea,"
Andy said. "They're all like, 'Dude, make a T-shirt that says this.
That would be hilarious.'"
Shamplade.com headquarters is rather fitting for the cool yet
comical style of its T-shirts. With a 6 foot, black and white check
ered ceiling, a black leather couch, dim lighting and full bath
room, the bedroom/office looks like someone threw the inside
of a New York City apartment into their shabby wood-paneled
basement.
A giant map of the United States pinpointing the locations of
all their online T-shirt sales covers most of the wall above the
couch. Whenever they look at the map, Mike and Andy still can
not believe their sudden success.
"We're a no-name company and people are willing to pay
money for our shirts," Mike exclaimed. "I've never met these
people and they're wearing shirts that Andy and I created. That
just blows my mind every time they do it."
Mike and Andy should not be so surprised. They are both
full-time students. Mike has a part-time job as a webmaster for
Toledo.com and Andy is the webmaster for the University's
School of Art Web site. They split what little free time they have
into having fun and maintaining their business — so both are
reaping the rewards of their hard work.
They also have a very strong friendship, which helps in a busi
ness where they could lose hundreds of dollars.
"I know I can count on [Andy]," Mike said. "You have to
have trust. If you don't have trust it's not going to work out. I
trust Andy."
The friendship Mike and Andy share began freshman year
when they were roommates in Harshman-Dunbar. They be
came fast friends and constantly discussed inventions and other
ways to make money.
"We always thought of crazy ways to make money online,"
Andy explained. "It's funny that four years later it finally came
true."
The two entrepreneurs decided to make T-shirts during one
of their conversations on how to make money. After friends
bought 20 shirts of their first design — a green shirt with the
words "I Eat Vegans" above a tomato — they understood their
potential products and Shamplade.com was born.
