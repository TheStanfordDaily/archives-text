# Campus bike accidents on the rise at USC

### JANNA BRAUN DAILY TROJAN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES —Last
spring, Aliana Miller was riding her bike
down McClintock Avenue in front of the
Lyon Center, heading home from class,
when she collided with another student on a
hike, striking her head on the pavement.
"We were both going pretty fast, and we
ran into each other in the middle of the
street," Miller said. "We just couldn't see
each other in time and ran into each other."
Miller's story is becoming more com
mon.
According to daily crime reports filed by
the University of Southern California De
partment of Public Safety (DPS), bicycle
related accidents in and around campus in
creased during the fall 2003 semester com
pared to the same time period a year ago.
Fourteen bicycle-related accidents oc
curred on or around the campus during the
fall semester, compared to only five in fall
2002.
In September 2003 alone, DPS reported
11 accidents. Three were reported in Sep
tember 2002.
Approximately 63 students were treated
for bicycle-related injuries, with an average
of three to four injuries per week during the
fall semester, said Theresa Colmenares, di
rector of clinical nursing at the USC Stu
dent Health Center.
When Miller was in her accident, she
said she hit her head on the pavement and
sought treatment at the University Park
Health Center later in the day after devel
oping a headache. While her injuries were
not serious. Miller said the accident has
changed the way she rides her bike around
campus.
"I'm a lot more cautious now," said
Miller, an undeclared sophomore. "I'm al
ways slow and always watching out for
other people."
"I've seen lots of close calls on campus —
it's not all that uncommon. At least once a
week 1 see something. People are just in a
hurry. But it's still not an excuse," Miller said.
Lt. Michael Kennedy of DPS said that
while he is not sure of the exact cause of the
increase, it is most likely because bicyclists
do not pay attention to their surroundings
and violate vehicle laws while riding.
Bikes need to follow the same rules as
cars, Kennedy said.
"I just don't think people know that," he
added. "I often see people running through
stop signs and riding against the flow of traffic."
"Based on (the number of DPS bike ac
cident reports), it's obviously a big increase,

but I don't know that people are doing any
thing differently other than violating the
laws," he said.
While a number of accidents happen
each semester, there are many that are not
reported to DPS.
John P. Matthews, USC program man
ager for Crime Prevention and Community
Education, said that a possible increase in
bicycle usage on campus could also be a fac
tor in the increase of accidents.
Matthews said the university does not
keep specific bike accident statistics and
that it is impossible to know how many
bikes ride through campus on a given day.
Several of the accidents reported to DPS re
sulted in injuries severe enough to require
treatment from paramedics and local hospitals.
"I'm not surprised," Colmenares said of
the number of bike injuries the Health Cen
ter has treated.
"Bikes are coming everywhere in the
wrong directions on this campus and you
don't always see them. I just came here in
June, but I worked here seven years ago and
don't remember (treating) this many before."
Dr. Lawrence S. Neinstein, executive di
rector of the University Park Health Cen
ter, said the health center's reporting of
bike-related injuries depends of the nature
of the injuries.
"If we think that there's something that
occurred related to safety that we can do
something about, then we report it," Nein
stein said. "But oftentimes I think it's just
some bad choices by students (that cause
accidents)."
Jamie Wetherbe, like Miller, did not re
port her bike accident. Wetherbe said she
was walking in front of the Physical Educa
tion Building after class in late October
2(X)3. when a female student on a bike hit
her from behind.
"1 didn't even see her, but it was like,
bam, right in the back," said Wetherbe, a
second-year graduate student majoring in
journalism.
"The girl said 'Oh, I'm sorry' but kept
going and didn't bother to stop to see if I
was ok. 1 didn't report it to DPS because I
didn't know you could report something
like that."
Beginning this semester, Matthews said
DPS would begin to specifically track bike
related accidents for statistical purposes.
DPS has made a number of efforts to
help prevent on-campus accidents, report
ed Kennedy. Some of DPS' actions include
placing DPS officers at some of the most
well-traveled areas of campus, such as Gate
5 and the center of campus along Trousdale
Parkway and in front of Commons.
