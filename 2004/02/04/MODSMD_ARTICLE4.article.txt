# Stanford alumna joins Cirque du Soleil

After a stressful day of classes, meetings, papers and problem sets,
it's probably typical fora Stanford student to fantasize about running
away with the circus. It's probably not too often, though, that someone
actually follows through on that idea.
Stanford alumna Sarah Harding, Class of '00, did in fact run away
with the circus, and, in true Stanford form, has earned a highly coveted
contract with the world-renowned Cirque du Soleil, while at the same
time competing and winning the 2004 Ms. Fitness USA competition.
"It's kind of a funny thing to say that you graduated from Stanford
and then joined the circus," Harding said. "Some people say I didn't
need the degree for my lifestyle, but I certainly think it prepared me for
what I'm doing in many different ways."
Harding received a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies and also
received a coterminal degree in media studies. While at Stanford, she re
ceived an Undergraduate Research Opportunities grant and traveled to
Beijing, where she conducted research for her honors thesis on the topic
of Chinese female gymnasts and their education levels.
Last September she won the 2004 Ms. Fitness USA competition,
placed third in 2004 Ms. Fitness World and took seventh at the Fitness
Woman European & World Championship. Harding said she did not an
ticipate competing in fitness competitions or becoming an acrobat while
she was at Stanford. Instead, she thought her Media Studies degree
would lead her to a career in media production.
"1 was curious about computer animation and thought I would go
into that," she said. "One of the reasons I was attracted to it was the
movement involved in animation, but the more I thought about it the
more I realized I love movement in general and doing it for myself.''
Harding found herself short of work in her field of interest, but was
offered a job as an acrobat at Sea World in San Diego. Harding attrib
uted the job offer to "being at the right place at the right time," but it

may also have had something to do with her record-setting perfor
mances as a Stanford gymnast. Harding was a First Team All-American,
scoring a perfect 10.0 in floor exercise during her junior year.
From Sea World, Harding went on to perform as the Little Mermaid
with Tokyo Disney. During this time, she also started entering fitness
competitions, a field she first had learned about before her arrival at
Stanford.
"While 1 was doing gymnastics my last couple of years in high school,
there were several adult recreational members that were looking to
train for fitness competitions," Harding said. "I choreographed at least
two fitness routines, but 1 didn't think I would ever pursue fitness com
petitions after 1 finished Stanford."
Harding decided, though, that the competitions were a good way to
get back in shape and start choreographing again. She trained for her
first competition and placed second in the 2003 Ms. Fitness USA com
petition.
"It was a bit of a surprise for me, because I knew about the routine as
pect, but I had no idea it was a beauty pageant," Harding said of the
competition. "There was an evening gown round where I could give my
philosophy on fitness and a swimsuit round where they judge your
physique — you're not supposed to look like a body builder but a strong
woman."
Harding is currently training with Cirque du Soleil for their new show
that will open in Las Vegas in July and plans to be performing with the
group for at least two more years.
"From a personal perspective, it's challenging work — it's different
from anything I've ever done before," she said.
After that, Harding hopes to work more backstage and do more to
promote women's health and fitness, a goal she connected to her URO
project.
"That experience alone let me feel like anything is possible," she said.
"If I have the right attitude and resources I can do anything if I put my
mind to it."
