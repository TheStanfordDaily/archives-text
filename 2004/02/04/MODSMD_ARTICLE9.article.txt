# New dean of students arrives on campus
## 
### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
New Dean of Students Greg Boardman officially took of
fice Monday, two months after being named the replacement
for former dean Marc Wais.
Boardman, who spent 15 years at Tulane University in New
Orleans, La., before coming to Stanford, was selected after
three interviews with the search committee. He said he felt
mixed emotions during his final days at Tulane, where he
served as the assistant vice president for student affairs.
"I was very excited about coming to Stanford but it was
sad leaving as well," Boardman said. "I was a bit over
whelmed with all of the receptions they had in my honor, and
I'm very excited about this new professional opportunity. I
am committed to being responsive to student concerns and to
enhancing student welfare and strengthening the campus
community."
Following a cross-country drive, Boardman arrived in Cal
ifornia on Jan. 19 and spent the last two weeks settling into his
new home and reviewing the University's policies. He also met
with Christine Griffith, the interim dean of students. Griffith

has returned to her position as director of the Office of Grad
uate Students.
"Working with the interim dean of students was defi
nitely a pleasure," said ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a
senior. "She was always very supportive, hut it was difficult
to focus on long-term goals because she was only working
with us fora short period of time. Now we have someone
who can work with students and hopefully see long-term
goals to fruition."
As dean of students, Boardman presides over the Office of
Judicial Affairs, the Office of Student Activities, Tresidder
Union, the Bechtel International Center and the campus com
munity centers.
"First and foremost I have to acclimate myself to the Stan
ford culture and access the major needs that the students and
staff have," Boardman said. "1 want to engage students and to
improve the services offered by my office."
According to Figueroa, Boardman's work with the campus
community centers will have a large impact on the quality of
student life. She added that she hopes he will make it a priori
ty to connect with students to get a sense of the issues that are
important to them. Additionally, with the special fees system

in jeopardy, she hopes that he will be helpful in finding outside
sources of money so that the ASSU can continue to fund stu
dent activities.
Boardman mentioned that he is committed to accomplish
ing the"Three C's" â€” communication, collaboration and a
collegial, collective approach to campus issues. Though he said
it is a little early for him to tell exactly what the issues are, he
hopes that by meeting with students, staff and ASSU mem
bers, he will soon have a good idea of how to adapt the old poli
cies and perhaps establish new ones.
"I collected all of the old policies last week," Boardman
said. "I have been reading them and I've also asked the staff to
submit annual reports and publications so that I can also go
over those. Stanford is in a good position and already has many
strong policies in place."
Boardman graduated from the University of Vermont in
1979 and later earned a masters degree in education from
Penn State University. Before moving to New Orleans, he
worked for eight years at the University of the Pacific in Stock
ton. While at Tulane, Boardman worked with Greek affairs,
student activities and leadership before assuming his position
as assistant vice president of student affairs.
