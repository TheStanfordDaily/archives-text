# Stanford's Josh Childress is back in the swing of things after missing nine games with a stress reaction in his left foot
## STRESSED NO MORE 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At practice on Tuesday afternoon, with fifth-year
senior Justin Davis somewhere in the back receiving
treatment to his left knee, sophomore forward Matt
Haryasz was off to the side, writhing in pain because of
an injury to his right ankle. The players — who
seemed visibly stunned — tried to ignore the sights
and sounds of their teammate's unexpected fall, and
the Stanford coaching staff tried to push practice along
with a "business-as-usual" mentality as Stanford train
er Andrew Tai rushed to help the forward off the
court.
In truth, it was just another day for the No. 2 Cardi
nal (18-0,9-0 Pacific 10 Conference), which, despite its
undefeated record, has never really been at full capac
ity this season.
Not yet, anyway.
Throughout the majority of its most important vic
tories, Stanford has been forced to play without at
least one of its biggest impact players.
And with Davis and now Haryasz out for who
knows how long, you can be sure that it will be awhile
— if ever—before the Cardinal is "back" at full
strength this season.
All these injuries beg the question: In a season
plagued with so many unspoken expectations (justifi
able or not), is the overall health of the team even a
factor?
Of course it is, right?
With respect to this particular season anyway, the
one-sided win-loss figures don't seem to back up that
conclusion.
Two days ago, during the aforementioned practice,
this Stanford team was forced, one more time, to re
member that same tried-and-true motto that had al
lowed it to remain 18-0: "Don't panic."
The phrase has become more of a mantra or a reli
gion than an attitude for the Cardinal — an idea that
originated when junior swingman Josh Childress first
went down at the beginning of the season.
It was a simple concept, really — a hard lesson
learned that can be traced back to last season, when
sophomore guard Chris Hernandez re-injured a bro
ken foot just two games after returning to the court.
This season, however, the injury trend started with
Childress.
"Call me Chill," he says with a laugh. "My nick
name is Chill."
And "chill" is exactly what Stanford has done all
season long. Whenever there's trouble, an obstacle to
overcome, they've figured out how to just "chill" and
play the way they've been taught to play.
"We've only really played seven games with our en
tire squad," Hernandez said. "The mentality is if
someone drops," the team can still be successful.
In retrospect, an ailing Childress — sidelined with a
stress reaction in his left foot — was the first obstacle
that the Cardinal was forced to endure, the first re
minder that a season with infinite possibilities could be

limited, ironically, by finite realities.
Childress sat out for almost two months and missed
nine games.
"It wasn't really frustrating [sitting out] because we
were winning and everyone was playing well," Chil
dress said. "I just tried to look at the time as a learning
experience."
In reality, Childress' Stanford career has been more
about dealing with unexpected frustrations. To say,
however, that it's been a rocky road would be an over
statement, although his time on the Farm hasn't been
without its twists and turns.
After starting his first few games in a Stanford uni
form. Childress was removed from the starting lineup
by Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery, a situation
that Childress "wasn't used to."
But even those "difficult" times were never like
now, although the continued success of his team eased
the pain a bit.
Never before had Childress been forced to sit out
for such an extended period of time — watching from
the sidelines draped in suit and tie, afro still picked to
perfection — aching to contribute.
And even back then, as a freshman, he was a contrib
utor, averaging almost eight points and five boards in
just over 20 minutes of play per game. During Mont
gomery's 17-year career at Stanford, Childress remains
only the second player to start his first collegiate game.
(The first was current NBA veteran Brevin Knight.)
This season, on the other hand, the storyline has
been different. All of his team's success came in spite
of his absence. All the excitement over this team was
generated because it was playing so well without him.
"If you look at our team from top to bottom, we're
a pretty good team," Childress said. "We have a team
of 15 different players that can contribute in 15 differ
ent ways."
In his first game back, showing few signs of rust,
Childress scored 10 points in seven minutes off 4-of-5
shooting from the field against Washington State at
Maples Pavilion. In the eight games since that first day,
his resume is relatively impressive. He scored the
game-winning bucket in Tempe against an Arizona
State team that was achingly close to pulling off an
upset. He scored 11 points against a threatening USC
team. He knocked down two crucial three-pointers
against Oregon last Saturday, one of which gave Stan
ford its first lead since the game's opening minute, and
his stat line for the season bears witness to 12.3 points
and 6.6 rebounds per game.
But for Childress, his play hasn't been good enough
yet. He rattles off areas he needs to improve like a
laundry list:
"I need to step it up [this weekend]," Childress said.
"I need to increase my productivity on the defensive
and offensive end, score more, help create more, re
bound more. I just need to improve all around, be
cause when you lose Justin, you lose 11 [points] and
seven [boards]."
Which brings us to now, to a player who is feverish
ly trying to pick up the pieces of a season that hasn't

gone all his way, although his team's
success is enough to suffice.
Perhaps the biggest indicator of
Childress's overwhelming pres
ence on this team is the fact that
people never stopped talking,
never forgot, never questioned

whether or not he was capable of
contributing to a team that was al
ready flourishing.
There's the NBA talk, the unde
feated talk, the forbidden whisper
ings over a possible fairy tale-like
return to the Final Four in, of all
places, San Antonio, where Stan
ford last made the Final Four.
And Childress is a part of all that
gossip, all that hoopla and jazz. He
always has been, even in his ab
sence. He always has been.
