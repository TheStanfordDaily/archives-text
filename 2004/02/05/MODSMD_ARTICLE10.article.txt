# Profs seek to retrace Steinbeck's journey
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
On March 11,1940, John Stein
beck, his wife Carol and marine bi
ologist Ed "Doc" Ricketts left
Monterey, California, to explore
the coast of Mexico's.Gulf of Cali
fornia, also known as the Sea of
Cortez. Their trip lasted six weeks
and was documented in their 1941
book "Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely
Journey of Travel and Research."
Sixty-five years later, partici
pants in the Sea of Cortez Expedi
tion and Education Project will re
trace the journey that Steinbeck
and Ricketts took, exploring many
of the same sites and habitats.
William Gilly, a professor of bi
ological sciences at the Stanford
Hopkins Marine Stations and di
rector of the project, said he al
ways wanted to embark on the
voyage describe in Steinbeck and
Ricketts' book. After meeting
Frank Donahue, a semi-retired
commercial fisherman and cap
tain of the Gus D, and recruiting
three more members for the team,
Gilly's dream became a reality.
The other members of the ex
pedition team are Chuck Baxter, a
lecturer emeritus in biological sci
ences at Stanford: Nancy Burnett,
a marine biologist and photogra
pher who will document the jour
ney and organisms encountered;
and Jon Christensen, a conversa
tion journalist who will be writing
a book and organizing daily Web
links via satellite as part of educa
tional outreach.
According to Gilly, the main
purpose of the trip is to compare
the state of the Gulf of California

in 2004 with its condition in 1940.
In addition, they hope to perfect
the science performed by Ricketts.
"We will attempt to reveal
what has dramatically changed
at the original 20 study sites since
1940," Gilly said. "This will need
to be a gut-feeling type of analy
sis — the original expedition was
not scientifically systematic and
actually pretty haphazard. We
can only attempt to see what
they saw through Ricketts' de
tailed field notes and Steinbeck's
storytelling."
The team will be joined period
ically along the way with various
scientists and students for specific
purposes, including some from
Mexico, making the project a bi
national effort.
Gilly described his own role on
the team as chief scientist, keeping
everyone on track and on sched
ule. He also plans to take on other
less scientific duties as well.
"I also hope to be responsible
for providing a lot of fish for
meals," he said. "We will all take
part in the field work, cooking and
other general tasks.
Planning for the trip has kept
Prof. William Gilly quite busy.
Gilly derives part of his excite
ment for the voyage from his love
of the Gulf itself.
"Every time 1 have been to
the Gulf, I have desired to go to
some place just a little further up
the coast, to another island —
basically to where it is more re
mote, more untouched, more full
of life and mystery," Gilly said.
"So far this approach has never
been disappointing, though usu
ally challenging."
