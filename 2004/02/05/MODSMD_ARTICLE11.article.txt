## 
### JORDANA HUBER 
The search is on fora new execu
tive director of Hillel at Stanford,
which promotes Jewish life on cam
pus, and already more than 30 peo
ple have applied.
"We are seeking a visionary and
dynamic leader," said Hillel hoard
member Linda Kurz, who is chair
ing of the search committee. "The
executive director will provide
strategic vision, leadership and
managerial oversight so we can fos
ter a more vibrant Jewish communi
ty at Stanford."
Hillel has been without an execu
tive director since Debra Feldstein
stepped down last June for personal
reasons. Adina Danzig is currently
interim executive director.
A committee made up of Hillel
board members, one Stanford facul
ty and one student have been adver
tising, networking and writing letters
to local leaders in its search fora
suitable candidate.

Next week, the group will short
list aspirants and conduct prelimi
nary interviews.
Those who make the cut will be
flown out to the Stanford campus to
see the campus and meet with stu
dents, Hillel staff and the University
administration.
Hillel International — the body
that oversees Hillel at Stanford —
will have final say on who will be
chosen.
Danny Greene, president of the
Jewish Leadership Council on cam
pus, said it is crucial that the new ex
ecutive director "be a leader in the
true sense of the word."
Greene added, "Much of the
work done by the executive director
is not seen by the students, but is
vital to the processes of the organi
zational structure of Hillel at Stan
ford. From working with the Board
of Directors to facilitating positive
public relations to making the final
decisions on policy, a strong execu
tive director is an absolutely neces

sary part of our program."
Working with a budget of
$850,000, the new executive director
will oversee all aspects of Hillel pro
gramming and his or her tasks will
include increasing student participa
tion and fostering greater ties with
the Stanford community.
"Stanford Hillel is in a real grow
ing phase both in construction as
well as programs," Kurz said. "The
new executive director will be com
ing in at a time when they can really
make an impact."
Construction of phase one of the
Harold and Libby Ziff Center for
Jewish Life at 565 Mayfield is set to
begin later this month. When the
building is complete it will house
meeting rooms, classrooms, a library
and Stanford's first kosher dining
hall. The center will be ready for use
next winter quarter.
The new executive director will
be chosen in early April and will as
sume the position at the beginning of
the summer.
