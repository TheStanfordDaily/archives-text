# SLAC upgrades accelerator

### ALIYYA HAQUE 
The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) held a dedication cere
mony last Thursday for its newly rebuilt
anil upgraded SPEAR 3 accelerator, a
$58 million venture jointly funded by
the National Institute of Health (NIH)
and the U.S. Department of Energy.
SPEAR 3. which stands Ibr Stan
ford Positron Electron Asymmetric
Ring, is an upgraded model of the
SPEAR and SPEAR 2 accelerators. It
facilitates the study of small particles by
turning radiofrequency energy into
photons — mainly x-rays — by a
process that accelerates electrons in a
storage ring, according to project direc
tor Keith Hodgson.
This process gives scientists a
glimpse into the structure of smaller
particles at the subatomic level, and the
information obtained can be applied to
a variety of subjects, he said. The up
grade to SPEAR 3 has also greatly in
creased the speed of the accelerator up
to 200 times faster than other ma
chines, decreasing the time needed to

complete an experiment.
At last week's dedication ceremo
ny, University President John Hen
nessy. Director of the Protein Structure
Initiative of the NIH John Norvell and
SLAC Director Jonathan Dorfan
among others described the various
goals for the new SPEAR 3.
"SPEAR 3 enables the study of new
science, especially that involving very
small samples and spot sizes," Hodg
son said. "SPEAR 3 provides much
brighter photon beams and has a signif
icant expansion capacity. It's very use
ful for the 1880 plus scientists from
across the country that use the beams."
SPEAR 3 has many practical uses,
including aiding the study of fields such
as structural biology, specifically the
structure of proteins. The SLAC press
release for the SPEAR 3 dedication
ceremony described the importance of
synchrotron light, the light emitted
from electrons as they are accelerated
around the storage ring.
"Synchrotron light has revolution
ized our view into the sub-microscopic
world," the release reads. "It has con

tributed to major innovations in fields
including solid-state physics, materials
science, environmental sciences, struc
tural biology and chemistry."
Hodgson said the SPEAR 3 up
grade would have great benefits for the
Stanford scientific community.
"SPEAR 3 will enable more chal
lenging and complex problems to be
solved," he said. "It also will provide
future expansion capacity and make
more time available for scientists
due to higher data rates leading to
faster experiments."
The SPEAR 3 project was managed
by the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory, an operational division of
SLAC, and received equal funding
from the NIH and DOE. The upgrade
was completed over a period of 11
months, without exceeding its allotted
time and budget.
SPEAR 3 will begin its operation in
March and, according to representa
tives from SLAC, "will transform our
view of the sub-microscopic world and
illuminate many long-kept secrets of
the sciences."
