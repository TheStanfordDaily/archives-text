## Special focus on... Men's Health Cut the creatine 
### BONITA SONG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
High-protein diets, steroids, even natu
ral supplements— they're all game
for people trying to attain the perfect
physique. One of the most notorious
performance-enhancing aids, creatine monohy
drate, has become increasingly popular among
young males and has made an appearance on
dorm bookshelves between jars of "Whey
Pumped" and "Centrum" vitamins.
But while makers of creatine supplements
are now rolling in money and endorsements —

including enthusiastic support from baseball
player Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs — this
so-called "natural" supplement hardly has re
ceived similar positive reviews from nutritionists
and researchers, who suggest that the supple
ment may be the cause of more hype than of
muscle gain.
Creatine, a three-amino-acid chain, is natu
rally produced by the human liver and is found
in many animal products like meat and fish.
Once produced or ingested (whether in food or
supplement form), it is stored in muscles as phos
phocreatine, a high-energy molecule that is es
sential for maintaining chains of intense, short

(less than 30 seconds) bursts of exercise; in fact,
it is this reputed trait that popularized it among
sluggers like Sosa and former St. Louis Cardi
nals first baseman Mark McGwire.
However, it is perhaps because of this associ
ation with these famous athletes that a common
misperception has arisen, leading some to be
lieve that creatine helps people build muscle
mass. In reality, creatine has not been shown to
build more muscle mass or help men build mus
cle mass faster.
Creatine does initiate a temporary increase in
water retention, causing the user to gain one to
three additional pounds of water after ingestion.
Indeed, it is this phenomenon that caused Dr.
Ronald L. Teijung— who headed a panel on
creatine use three years ago sponsored by the
American College of Sports Medicine — to
speculate that creatine users may benefit deriva
tively from a placebo effect.
"They look like performers, so they feel like
performers," Terjung reported on WebMD, an
online medical research resource. "They pushed
themselves to train a little harder, which made
them build real strength. It's conceivable there
might have been a placebo effect."
Placebo effect or not, creatine monohydrate
— the supplement form of creatine — has been
attributed with causing various gastrointestinal
side effects. Common complaints include dehy
dration, nausea, dizziness and cramping, espe
cially when taken immediately before exercise.
And while cases of serious side effects from cre
atine remain are uncommon, in one case, an oth
erwise healthy 20-year-old man was hospitalized
for four days with acute interstitial nephritis
(kidney problems) after beginning a normal
daily dosage regimen. Official sports and mili
tary policies on creatine monohydrate, which
has not been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, remain rare or non-existent.
Cardinal sports coaches do not support Stan
ford athletes' use of creatine, but there is no spe
cific policy.
Although some students use creatine, stu
dent athletes reported that they did not feel pres
sured to take sports supplements. Freshman
Kirk McConnell, who plays on the Stanford
water polo team, said, "There's no pressure [for
team members to take creatine], so it's not real
ly an issue."
On the other hand, another male Stanford
varsity athlete, who asked not to be identified,
admitted that he takes it "every now and then."
He added, "Creatine helps your endurance.
If you're an athlete who's training every day, it
gets hard to maintain that same level |of perfor
mance]."
Research does not in fact suggest that crea
tine alters endurance; however, studies do imply
that it helps athletes recover faster after intense
periods of exercise.
Other students in high-pressure environ
ments where body physique is important may
feel tempted to take creatine, but according to
James Liao, a Stanford freshman in the Army
Reserve Officer Training Core (ROTC), Stan
ford members generally choose not to.
"People take supplements, but I don't know
about [anyone who takes] creatine," Liao said.
He added that the situation is different, how
ever, for professional military troops: "I don't
think there's any official policy for students [in
the ROTC], but I know that for Navy Seals, if
they catch you with it on you, you get kicked
out."

Think women are the only ones with body issues? Taking potentially harmful supple
ments like creatine, many men try to achieve the ultra-fit body physique exemplified
by these Stanford men's swim team athletes.
