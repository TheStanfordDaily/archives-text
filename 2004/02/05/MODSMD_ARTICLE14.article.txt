# Feeling aggressive?
## Don't blame your testosterone! 
### BRIAN LICHTENSTEIN GUEST COLUMNIST 
As Robert Sapolsky, professor of neurology and neurological sciences at
Stanford, so aptly put it: "Whether it is something as primal as having
an ax fight in an Amazonian clearing or as detached as using comput
er-guided aircraft to strike a village, something as condemned as as
saulting a cripple or as glorified as killing someone wearing the wrong uniform,
if it is violent, males excel at it."
Most of us also think we know why.
Testosterone is one of the classic male hormones (known as the androgens)
intimately linked in the development of many aspects of masculine features such
as body hair, muscle development, crunching beer cans on foreheads and in pop
ular science, has been associated with higher levels of aggression and possibly vi
olence. Women actually have some testosterone —just as men have estrogen —
but usually in much lower levels, around one-tenth, than those circulating in
most men.
In most species, males are clearly the more aggressive of the sexes (barring fe
male with young). In laboratory animals, this can clearly be associated with
testosterone levels, but only early in life during the critical period when the
course of later brain development is being set.
Why then do we all think that more testosterone means more chest-thump
ing, grass-tearing fun — or aggression?
Much of the pseudo-science and popular beliefs regarding testosterone come
from castration studies. Testosterone levels plummet, and conspicuously, so do
aggressive acts. It turns out, however, while other parts of the body like the pitu
itary and hypothalamus (i.e. the brain) are involved in the eventual production of
testosterone, the testicular cells of Leydig — specialized hormone-making cells
on the testes — are the bad boys who generate the hormone we know and love.
Cancers or tumors that interrupt the flow of chemicals from the brain to
testes often times result in the loss of the body's production of testosterone, re
sulting in conditions similar to castration: the loss of sexual drive, energy and
hair, among many. If testosterone is administered through hormone therapy,
some behavior and biological deficits may be alleviated. As odd as this may
sound, this level can be any where from 20 to 200 percent of "normal" — it
would seem our bodies can't really tell the difference — and you will see no dif
ference in aggression, sexual interest or copulatory ability with differing
amounts of administered testosterone.
The model that many of us consciously (or subconsciously) hold about testos
terone is dead wrong. Testosterone does not cause aggression. Rather, as
demonstrated in numerous studies, testosterone exaggerates aggressive behav
ior by increasing rates of fire of neurons in the parts of the brain that regulate
emotion and memory.
So by now you're thoroughly confused. Does that mean that Olga, my East
ern European weight-lifting girlfriend, is really mean because she's a guy? Let
me try to clarify with a real world example.
To attempt to elucidate what testosterone does in the real world, I donned my
cap and Pep Boys shirt and surveyed the local Monster Truck show, a land where
the exhaust of the roaring engines mingled with the vaporized androgens and
beer-breath exuded from every man in the stadium. After the show, I managed
to flag down one of the drivers of Live Wire, a honkering beast of a truck that
had laid waste to many an impounded Chevy.
Revved by the show, I asked him why he thought men enjoyed monster trucks
so much.
"We 11... the motors I guess," he said, and on further consideration: "Yeah, I
mean heck! I think every guy just wants to drive a big ol' mean truck and crush
things. Don't you?"
The fact is that the issue is nowhere as simple as Dr. Drew would have you be
lieve. Testosterone's role in male behavior has yet to be fully explained, but it is
not solely the factor regulating aggression. Sorry, you can't use it as an excuse to
beat up the next kid that gets on your case.
