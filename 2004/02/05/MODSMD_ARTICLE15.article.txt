## Stanford men and the Adonis Complex 
### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Having known each other for almost tour years
now, my roommate and I have competed in
numerous arenas, as Stanford buddies are in
clined to do. I get better grades and, by purs
ing a career in medicine, have a more concrete future.
He, on the other hand, is a business-oriented techie who,
I begrudgingly admit, will ultimately haul in more money
than I will.
Yet, since the beginning of the quarter, when we
began our respective workout regiments, we've been un
flinchingly encouraging in our mutual support pom
poms, blow horns, the whole shebang. You see, my
Parisian roommate, of average height, arrived in the
United States weighing in at a rotund 185 pounds. After
I told him he had eaten one too many eclairs, he prompt
ly responded, inappropriately, with a middle finger. I, by
contrast, have been floating around 150 and 155 pounds
during the course of my undergraduate career- a de
cent weight, except that, because 1 m 6 feet fall, it makes
my mother wonder if I'm eating properly at school.
So now we're both aiming for 165, a magical number
that, when taken in relation to our respective current

weights, seems within grasp. To this end, I've been hit
ting Tresidder Fitness late at night, or, if I'm too lazy to
walk over, co-opting my dresser as a pull-up apparatus.
My roommate, however, has been far more militant in
his approach. Appalled with his weight, he does hard
core cardio every morning — "the worst half an hour of
my day,"he says — lifts weights three times a week and,
after a daily lunch of tuna and salad, throws in an after
noon protein shake for good measure. Thus far, things
are going splendidly. Based on the Excel graph charting
his progress, which, much to my dismay, he stares at far
more than his problem sets, the best-fit line shows that
he's shedding an average of two pounds a week.
Our current regiments are, of course, difficult to
maintain. By an unofficial tally, this is my fourth attempt,
since arriving on the Farm, that I've vowed to buff up my
body. Like so many New Year's resolutions gone awry,
the reasons why I've stopped have been trivial — mid
terms, friendship maintenance and general contentment
that I'm not overweight.
Why are we going through so much trouble to achieve
our ideal physiques? On top of the obvious long-term
health benefits, the ego inflation after putting yourself
through the physical and mental anguish of working out
is second to none. With your chest jutted out and your

spine arrow-straight, you think (the keyword here is
"think") that you can take down the next football player
that crosses your path.
Some psychiatrists would argue, however, that we
are afflicted with mild forms of the Adonis complex —
an excessive concern with male body image. Thus, well
documented predominantly female psychological is
sues, such as anorexia, now have male counterparts, like
bigorexia nervosa, which involves obsessive weight lift
ing, eating disorders and distorted body perception.
Bombarded with media images of the Abercrombie &
Fitch masculine archetype, young males are increasing
ly hitting the gym so that, in an updated version of keep
ing up with the Joneses, they are not feminized and per
ceived as wimps.
Indeed, although the Adonis complex nowhere near
rivals the pervasiveness of bulimia, reports suggest that fe
males aren't the only ones concerned with the image in the
mirror. According to a 1997 study, 45 percent of American
men said that they were dissatisfied with their body — a
percentage that doubled since 1972. Over 100,000 men in
the United States are struggling with muscle dysmorphia
— overwhelming shame and embarrassment about their
muscle tone, or, as the case may be, a lack thereof.
Unfortunately, wannabe bodybuilders, when coupling

the Adonis complex with performance enhancement, are
risking their lives in the process. Steroids, after all, lead to
a slew of illnesses — including heart disease, stroke, men
tal ailments and prostate cancer. And Ephedra, a popular
dietary supplement which has been implicated in the
deaths of professional athletes, was banned by the Feder
al Drug Administration last December.
The vast majority of men at Stanford, of course, don't
go to such extremes to channel their inner Schwarzeneg
ger. Instead, the repercussions of the Adonis complex
are merely one aspect to consider in our drive for perfec
tion: Already equipped with brains, we turn our atten
tion to the brawn.
So while my roommate and I may never grow to Her
culean proportions, we're still making steady progress
toward our goals. The rewards will come over spring
break, when our temporary truce is broken and our com
petition begins anew, this time along the endless beach
front of Cancun.
