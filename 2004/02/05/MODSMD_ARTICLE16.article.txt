## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Demonstrated interest is unfair 
### 
According to The Chronicle of
Higher Education, the latest
trend in today's hyper-competi
tive college admissions race is a
strategy known as "demonstrated inter
est." High school students express their
desire to attend a particular college by
visiting the admissions office, introduc
ing themselves to the admissions officers
and trying to attract the attention of ad
missions personnel by performing stunts
like sending photographs of themselves
wearing the college's sweatshirt. Offi
cials at 56 percent of the 595 colleges sur
veyed by the National Association for
College Admissions Counseling report
ed that they consider demonstrated in
terest as a factor when selecting students
to accept.
This trend is disturbing. The practice
of demonstrating interest is largely limit
ed to higher-income students attending
high schools that are geared towards
preparing students for college. Low-in
come applicants cannot always afford to
visit numerous colleges to meet with ad
missions officers. Many public high
schools do not have college counselors
or guidance counselors who are knowl
edgeable about the most recent develop
ments in the college admissions game, so
most public high school students are not
as aware that tliey should indicate in this
manner their interest in the colleges they
want to attend.

Admissions officials who take demon
strated interest into consideration claim
to look at students' backgrounds when
making judgments, and they say that they
would not expect visits from students who
apply from far away and lack the financial
means to have visited. But how can the
admissions officials accurately determine
who can afford to visit and who cannot?
In particular, how can schools who pur
port to use need-blind admissions make
this judgment? And how do they account
for students who may have the financial
means to visit but don't because they
aren't aware that doing so would improve
their chances of being accepted? Many
students wait to see if they are accepted
before visiting schools to make their deci
sion. This doesn't mean that they don't re
ally want to attend a certain school —
they just don't want to spend the time and
money visiting before tney know that at
tending the school is a real possibility.

Admission has said that it does not con
sider demonstrated interest when making
its admissions decisions. We applaud
Stanford's wil-lingness to buck this trend
in favor of basing decisions on factors that
really matter — such as grade point aver
age, the difficulty of high school courses
and extracurricular activities. We encour
age Stanford to continue its pursuit of a
fair admission policy and to not allow un
fair criteria to sway its judgment.
