# ORDER IN THE COURT?
## Be careful what you wish for 
### 
Here I am, staring at a blank
page, unsure how to start.
The bitter irony of this situa
tion is that this is the column
I've been wishing I could write all year
long: a column about writing columns.
My desire to write on this topic
does not stem from some deeply-held
belief that it is a great column topic.
You see, after spending a quarter and
a half doing this, I'm way past hoping
to think of great topics. I want to write
about it simply because it's a topic.
Coming up with a topic each week
is really, really hard. When I started
the job, I figured it wouldn't be so
bad. After all, I'd have a week to
come up with something. When I first
signed up, a couple of Daily staffers
asked me what my "theme" was
going to be. I didn't understand.
"I'll just write about whatever 1
feel like writing about that week," 1
said. Moreover, 1 had two aces in the
hole — the two columns the Daily
staff made me write in order to apply
for the position. If I ever had a partic
ularly bad week, I'd just pull one of
them out of the bag. Easy as pie.
Yeah, right. Two weeks later, I 'd al
ready exhausted my secret column
cache. I was writing without a net.
Whoever said. "Pride goeth before a
fall" must have been a weekly colum
nist who didn't realize going in how lit
tle he had to say. (Likely he wrote for
a newspaper with a wide circulation.

Lots of people seem to be familiar with
that quote.) As the weeks progressed,

it became harder
and harder to think
of something to
write about. Each
week, I'd flirt closer
to my deadline
than 1 had the week
before. Each week,
I'd fantasize about
my final column,
the one where I'd
simply be able to
write about the

process of writing columns.
Maybe it would have been better if
I'd had that "theme" they'd suggest
ed. At first, I thought I might write
about legal / political topics. So I tried
writing a column about pornography
in public libraries. Boy, was that a mis
take. It's apparently a subject about
which I know nothing. Contrary to my
bald-faced empirical assumptions,
pornography is apparently a fairly
large problem in a great number of
public libraries. I received so many e
mails from irritated librarians telling
me to get my facts straight that I began
to worry that perhaps my borrowing
privileges might be revoked.
This early misstep made me cog
nizant of the fact that these columns
were going out on the Internet, and I
should be careful what I said lest it
come back to haunt me. (Apparently,

my column had been posted to a li
brarians' mailing list.) So I retreated
meekly into areas in which I hoped
that I possessed more expertise,
which turned out mainly to be my own
life and television-watching habits.
As luck would have it, however, 1
am apparently no expert in these do
mains, either. A column about my
dislike of Word's grammar checker
elicited e-mail in support of Mi
crosoft's innovation. Another about
the parallels between sports and teen
soap operas sparked e-mail criticizing
my logic, defending ESPN and giving
me fantasy football tips.
Fortunately, 1 had one thing going
for me that most college newspaper
columnists probably don't — my
own personal proofreader, my wife
Becky. Writing my column would
have been impossible without her
reading everything in advance and
giving me her helpful comments and
advice. Many times she saved me
from making a fool of myself.
Too bad she's not a public librari
an. Would have been nice to see that
one coming.

Eric Feigin will now retreat to the com
fortable shell of his life as a second
year law student. If you'd like to tell
him that he also doesn't know what
he's talking about when he writes
about his own writing, he can be
