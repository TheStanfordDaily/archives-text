# Trotter plays through the pain
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For any NCAA basketball player, pain is undoubt
edly part of the game. But for redshirt junior Chelsea
Trotter, that's a gross understatement — and it's been
that way since before she even arrived on the Stanford
campus.

"I tore my first ACL the
first game of my freshman
year of high school and, basi
cally, since then, it's been a
downward spiral of injuries,"
Trotter said.
While just one such injury
can be completely devastat
ing to a player's career and
usually results in about six
months of rehabilitation, the
6-foot-3 center has torn both
of her ACLs.

Unfortunately for Trotter, it doesn't stop there.
Along with complications from the ACL surgeries, Trot
ter has a list of ailments that you would expect from your
grandma, but certainly not a typical 21-year-old —
arthritis, meniscal damage, compartment syndrome and
chronic inflammation.
Ten surgeries later — no, that's not a misprint —
Trotter is still in pain, and she and her coaches have re-

sorted to just trying to find ways to manage it so that she
can get on the court come game day.
"[The pain] definitely ranges, but each day — I hesi
tate to say it's a struggle — but it's definitely not an easy
thing," Trotter said. "I'm aware of pain when I play and
it's not something that ever goes away when I'm out
there."
And it's not just something she deals with on the
court.

"When I'm going up
stairs [I feel it], and some
times laying in bed my
knees will just be throb
bing, but definitely more
so when I'm on court,"
Trotter said. "Just the
pounding of running up
and down court and
jumping."

In order to cope
with her injuries. Trotter has worked with the coaching
staff to develop a practice schedule that best suits her
needs. Some days she doesn't practice at all and just
watches tape, while others she is limited to walk
throughs.
Through it all. Trotter still manages to be effective
when she suits up. She is averaging 19.6 minutes, 7.9
points and 4.1 rebounds per game. However, she recent-

ly missed three straight games and
has averaged only 12 minutes per
game since then.
"It is hard practicing hardly at all
and then going into games and try
ing to do well," she said. "I just
don't get the reps that most people
do, but there are things that can al
leviate the situation."
Trotter cites watching video, vi
sualizing her game and making sure
to have a good understanding of ev
erything happening on the floor as
what keeps her up to speed.
And while most people would
simply give up, the junior tri-cap
tain has learned from her experi
ences and has been able to apply
them to leading the team.
"It kind of helps in my leader
ship role just because I can under
stand a lot of times what everyone is
going through," she said. "I've been
a starter, I've played a lot, but I've
also experienced the downfall of
sitting on the bench and wondering

when I'm going to go in or if I'm
going to go in."
As a captain. Trotter has taken a
vocal role in terms of leadership
both on and off the floor. Calling
herself "the encourager" and"the
supporter," Trotter's contributions
are clearly felt by the rest of the
squad. But she is quick to point to
what her teammates have done for
her.
"Everyone has always been
aware of my situation .., and I
think the team really respects it,"
she said. "They've really just kind of
banded behind me and have sup
ported me in terms of the situation."
Trotter faces another dilemma
this spring as she is on track to re
ceive her undergraduate degree in
international relations in June.
While she will have another year of
NCAA eligibility remaining after
this season comes to a close, she has
yet to make a decision as to whether
she wants to endure another year of
playing through pain.
"I'm kind of playing that by
ear," she said. "If they come out
with some amazing new drug —
definitely."

this season comes to a close, she has
yet to make a decision as to whether
she wants to endure another year of
playing through pain.
"I'm kind of playing that by
ear," she said. "If they come out
with some amazing new drug —
definitely."
For any NCAA basketball player, pain is undoubt
edly part of the game. But for redshirt junior Chelsea
Trotter, that's a gross understatement — and it's been
that way since before she even arrived on the Stanford
campus.

"I tore my first ACL the
first game of my freshman
year of high school and, basi
cally, since then, it's been a
downward spiral of injuries,"
Trotter said.
While just one such injury
can be completely devastat
ing to a player's career and
usually results in about six
months of rehabilitation, the
6-foot-3 center has torn both
of her ACLs.

Unfortunately for Trotter, it doesn't stop there.
Along with complications from the ACL surgeries, Trot
ter has a list of ailments that you would expect from your
grandma, but certainly not a typical 21-year-old —
arthritis, meniscal damage, compartment syndrome and
chronic inflammation.
Ten surgeries later — no, that's not a misprint —
Trotter is still in pain, and she and her coaches have re-

sorted to just trying to find ways to manage it so that she
can get on the court come game day.
"[The pain] definitely ranges, but each day — I hesi
tate to say it's a struggle — but it's definitely not an easy
thing," Trotter said. "I'm aware of pain when I play and
it's not something that ever goes away when I'm out
there."
And it's not just something she deals with on the
court.

"When I'm going up
stairs [I feel it], and some
times laying in bed my
knees will just be throb
bing, but definitely more
so when I'm on court,"
Trotter said. "Just the
pounding of running up
and down court and
jumping."

In order to cope
with her injuries. Trotter has worked with the coaching
staff to develop a practice schedule that best suits her
needs. Some days she doesn't practice at all and just
watches tape, while others she is limited to walk
throughs.
Through it all. Trotter still manages to be effective
when she suits up. She is averaging 19.6 minutes, 7.9
points and 4.1 rebounds per game. However, she recent-

ly missed three straight games and
has averaged only 12 minutes per
game since then.
"It is hard practicing hardly at all
and then going into games and try
ing to do well," she said. "I just
don't get the reps that most people
do, but there are things that can al
leviate the situation."
Trotter cites watching video, vi
sualizing her game and making sure
to have a good understanding of ev
erything happening on the floor as
what keeps her up to speed.
And while most people would
simply give up, the junior tri-cap
tain has learned from her experi
ences and has been able to apply
them to leading the team.
"It kind of helps in my leader
ship role just because I can under
stand a lot of times what everyone is
going through," she said. "I've been
a starter, I've played a lot, but I've
also experienced the downfall of
sitting on the bench and wondering

when I'm going to go in or if I'm
going to go in."
As a captain. Trotter has taken a
vocal role in terms of leadership
both on and off the floor. Calling
herself "the encourager" and"the
supporter," Trotter's contributions
are clearly felt by the rest of the
squad. But she is quick to point to
what her teammates have done for
her.
"Everyone has always been
aware of my situation .., and I
think the team really respects it,"
she said. "They've really just kind of
banded behind me and have sup
ported me in terms of the situation."
Trotter faces another dilemma
this spring as she is on track to re
ceive her undergraduate degree in
international relations in June.
While she will have another year of
NCAA eligibility remaining after
this season comes to a close, she has
yet to make a decision as to whether
she wants to endure another year of
playing through pain.
"I'm kind of playing that by
ear," she said. "If they come out
with some amazing new drug —
definitely."
