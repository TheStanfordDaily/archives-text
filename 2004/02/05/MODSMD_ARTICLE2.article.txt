### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For any NCAA basketball player, pain is undoubt
edly part of the game. But for redshirt junior Chelsea
Trotter, that's a gross understatement — and it's been
that way since before she even arrived on the Stanford
campus.

"I tore my first ACL the
first game of my freshman
year of high school and, basi

it's not something that ever goes away when I'm out
there."
And it's not just something she deals with on the
court.

"When I'm going up
stairs [I feel it], and some
times laying in bed my
knees will just be throb
bing, but definitely more
so when I'm on court,"
Trotter said. "Just the
pounding of running up
and down court and
jumping."

In order to cope
with her injuries. Trotter has worked with the coaching
staff to develop a practice schedule that best suits her
needs. Some days she doesn't practice at all and just
watches tape, while others she is limited to walk
throughs.
Through it all. Trotter still manages to be effective
when she suits up. She is averaging 19.6 minutes, 7.9
points and 4.1 rebounds per game. However, she recent-
