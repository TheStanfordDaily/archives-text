# OUT OF AFRICA
## Soaking up Stanford's social scene 
### 
Beer mingled with sweat...
sounds tasty, doesn't it? I bet
that caught your attention
right away. Part of you
thinks "nasty" but is still prompted to
read on to discover just what it is that
could be so nasty. Well, I'll tell you.
Beer mingled with sweat — that is the
smell that confronted me when I en
tered a frat party this past Friday.
After having gone and fulfilled my
three-days-of-partying-a-week quota
my freshman year, I'd entered the her
mit-like recession the following year
that comes with being a sophomore
and being in the Human Biology Pro
gram core. This Friday was thus my
first coming-out-of-recession frat
party since freshman year and 1 re-ex
perienced culture shock with that re
freshing stench of beer and sweat.
It was actually not a bad party for
the total of 20 minutes that I was in at
tendance. Yet, I left feeling old be
cause I did not know 70 percent of the
people there — most of whom, I as
sume, were freshmen. But I also left
feeling new, because I did not know
70 percent of the people there, those
same freshmen. That was when the
reason I had stopped attending these
parties came rusliing back to me and 1
reaffirmed my commitment to going
off campus to party. Seriously speak
ing, my old-ass junior status should
have at least taught me this by now.

I hear Stanford students (minus the
freshmen, perhaps) complaining right
and left about the lack of a hype social
scene on campus. So, what options are
there to improve our social lives here
at Stanford? The way I see it there are
a few possibilities:
1) MAKE it hype. This would re
quire that all the students who shack up
in their rooms studying on Thursday,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights
come out and party. However, I am not
in a position to hate here because out
side of my 2()-minute excursion on Fri
day night, that is precisely what 1 did for
the remainder of my weekend.
2) Go into Palo Alto. Yeah, right.
Where? Outside the handful of bars
and restaurants, there isn't really that
much to do in good ol' Palo Alto.
And even if there were, the price
ranges and atmosphere are hardly
student-friendly.
3) Go to San Francisco. Too far.
4) Oakland. Too far.
5) Berkeley. We hate Cal.
6) San Jose. Too far.
Not really. The "too far" part, 1
mean. But remember that paper you
have due on Monday, the problem
set on Tuesday, the Daily article on
Wednesday and the other problem
set on Thursday? Exactly my point.
What true-bred Stanford student
would neglect all of these duties, God
forbid, to go out and have a good

time? I've given up trying to convince
my friends at other schools that Stan
ford students are not nerds. We are
well-rounded nerds perhaps, but
nerds all the same. 1 party more in the
one week that 1 go to Washington.
D.C. for spring break than 1 do in all
of fall quarter.
Going back to the beer-and-sweat
party though, I'm not saying you'll
never catch me at one of those again.
I had another profound realization
while at that particular party when a
girl I knew freshman year approached
me to say, "Oh sh**, you still go here?
I thought you transferred."
Perhaps vanishing entirely from
the lukewarm social scene is not all
together a great idea either. I don't
have too much advice to offer on how
to improve our level of fun here at
Stanford except to leave your study
ing alone once in a while and add to
the party vibe — go out and explore
what the Bay has to offer on that
scene and stop reading the opinions
of a disgruntled junior looking for
ward to getting away from Stanford
next quarter.

Were you a freshman at last Friday
night's frat party? E-mail junior Mek
lit Workneh at wmeklit@stanford.edu
to tell her abtiut how much the beer
and sweat rocked your innocent, not
yetjaded world.

much to do in good ol' Palo Alto.
And even if there were, the price
ranges and atmosphere are hardly
student-friendly.
3) Go to San Francisco. Too far.
4) Oakland. Too far.
5) Berkeley. We hate Cal.
6) San Jose. Too far.
Not really. The "too far" part, 1
mean. But remember that paper you
have due on Monday, the problem
set on Tuesday, the Daily article on
Wednesday and the other problem
set on Thursday? Exactly my point.
What true-bred Stanford student
would neglect all of these duties, God
forbid, to go out and have a good

time? I've given up trying to convince
my friends at other schools that Stan
ford students are not nerds. We are
well-rounded nerds perhaps, but
nerds all the same. 1 party more in the
one week that 1 go to Washington.
D.C. for spring break than 1 do in all
of fall quarter.
Going back to the beer-and-sweat
party though, I'm not saying you'll
never catch me at one of those again.
I had another profound realization
while at that particular party when a
girl I knew freshman year approached
me to say, "Oh sh**, you still go here?
I thought you transferred."
Perhaps vanishing entirely from
the lukewarm social scene is not all
together a great idea either. I don't
have too much advice to offer on how
to improve our level of fun here at
Stanford except to leave your study
ing alone once in a while and add to
the party vibe — go out and explore
what the Bay has to offer on that
scene and stop reading the opinions
of a disgruntled junior looking for
ward to getting away from Stanford
next quarter.

Were you a freshman at last Friday
night's frat party? E-mail junior Mek
lit Workneh at wmeklit@stanford.edu
to tell her abtiut how much the beer
and sweat rocked your innocent, not
yetjaded world.
