ASSU should discontinue
special fees refunds
The recent articles on the foreseen
special fees shortfall made several
good points hut ignored the most obvi
ous flaw in the system — refunds are
allowed. Anyone who votes against a
group whose fee passes can effectively
(and arguably more damagingly)
"vote" again by requesting a refund. If
a government lets voters decide on a
public spending measure but then,
once passed, gave tax refunds to those
who voted against it, it would be fool
ish not to expect a budget shortage.
I am surprised that the average re
fund rate in the past five years has been
merely eight percent. Last year's ap
proved groups averaged only 65 per
cent "yes" votes and, as reported in
The Daily, some people request re
funds even from groups for which they
voted. The recent increase in refund
rates can probably be attributed to
widespread knowledge of the special
fee surplus and the fact that historical
ly, refunds have not really affected the
individual groups. However, if rates
stay well above eight percent, the sur
plus will disappear, groups will see
their budgets cut and the special fee
program will need to be oveniauled or
else scrapped entirely.
Ideally, Stanford would fund all
groups now receiving special fees, and
hopefully it would not simply raise tu
ition by another $80 to do so. (Recent
years' tuition hikes alone should have
been more than enough to cover all the
croups currently receiving special
fees.) Barring that, I'm afraid the best
option is to amend the ASSU's consti
tution to discontinue special fee re
funds. This would place actual respon
sibility on voters, who can currently
vote casually for groups but plan to get
their money back. As a past treasurer
of the Stanford Band, I can attest to the

reality that most groups would have
great financial difficulties if refunds ac
tually detracted from their budgets.
Many would no doubt argue that to
disallow refunds would not be "fair."
However, it is far less "fair" fora group
to craft a budget that, after being
screened by tne ASSU and "ap
proved" by a student vote, is later re
duced by refunds. A blessing and a
curse of democracy (incidentally, the
last time I checked, Stanford isn't one)
is that the majority rules, and we have
to live with the results of their decisions
even when we disagree.

Children should not be an issue in
debate about gay marriage
I want to thank The Daily for its
coverage of the panel discussion on the
issue ofgay marriage ("Panel discusses
gay marriage," Fen. 4.) According to
the article, one of the panelists seemed
to linger on the issue of children in mar
riage. This is a red herring.
Marriage is not defined by the
presence of children. Children are a
delightful byproduct, but you don't
have to be married to produce them.
Heterosexuals, who marry and pro
duce no children, are not in danger
voiding their unions. My parents got
a marriage license, not a license to
have children.
1 am gay. It makes no sense to me
that I shouldn't be allowed to marry
because it may adversely affect some
one who hasn't yet been (and probably
won't ever lie) conceived — my own
children. That idea is a preemptive
strike to my life, liberty and pursuit of
happiness. It is a red herring because it
shifts the focus of the discussion from
my right to marry to the right of a child
to be loved and nurtured by society.

I don't know anyone who doesn't
want the best for every child. Parent
hood and marriage are not synony
mous. If my partner and I got married,
it would not harm a single child. I have
never heard anyone articulate the
ways in which gay marriage would
weaken the institution of marriage as a
whole. Yes, it is complicated, but these
are two different issues. Life is good,
it's just not easy.

Bush can be 'reelected'
I agree with Beth Youngdoff that
"accuracy is an important aspect of
good journalism" ("Bush can't be 're
elected'," Feb. 4). Unfortunately, The
Daily's printing of her letter to the edi
tor — saving that "the current occu
pant of tne white House is not eligible
to be 'reelected' since he was appoint
ed by the Supreme Court"was —was not
such an act of good journalism.
Youngdoff has clearly not read the
Constitution of the United States, the
Constitution of the State of Florida or
the election laws of the state of Flori
da. She also apparently does not recall
that each time the media — with
whom she shares a transparent liberal
bias — counted the ballots in ques
tion, President George W. Bush won
the state of Florida.
The Constitution clearly states
that the candidate who receives the
majority of votes from the electoral
college is the duly elected president of
the United States. Perhaps Ms.
Youngdoff — as well as the editor of
The Daily's opinions page — should
enroll in a civics class at a local com
munity college.
