# Sports history lesson comes in size 11, pink and white leather
## 
### 
At the driving range last week, while
swinging for the moon amongst 50 or so
Tom Kite and Craig Stadler look
alikes, a kid who must have been fresh
off the Ja Rule Hits tour took the mat beside me.
He stood there beneath a sideways Clippers pin
wheel hat, sporting a wife beater, jean shorts and
one clean pair of hightops. But this young Happy
Gilmore wasn't sporting any ordinary Avia
crosstrainers. We were talking Bo Jackson Air
Max cross trainers, the same kicks I, along with
every other kid in America, wanted when we
were seven years old.

The same original Nike Air
Maxes you knew you could run
lip 20-foot high outfield fences
in and shed monster tacklers
with if only the 'rents would
burp a hundred bucks into your
hand. The neon pink and white
vinyl sneaks with the tiny air
bubble you knew you'd high
step to class in, rake in all the
girls' Valentine's Day cards

with, anything short of save the world in. Those
shoes were the next best thing to Bo Jackson
DNA and in 1990, everyone who knew anything
craved them.
And as I stood there staring at the shoes on the
kid with the pistol stud in his ear. I was brought
back to elementary school, where I used to ter
rorize kids in flag football as Bo Bechis. I had to
reminisce with this kid. "Bo knows golf, huh?" I
threw his way with a nod and a slight grin.
He looked up a I me, lacking the slightest sense
of enthusiasm — recognition even. His expres
sion morphed to that of a young "are-you-talking
to-me?" Robert DeNiro in a scowl broadcasting
sports ignorance.
My grin fell to disappointment and then frus
tration. Yah killin' me kid! So what you were
horn after the guy retired... look at you 're frickin'
feet! Ya bought those didn 7 ya? The Bo Jackson
trainers! BO KNOWS! RING! RING! Uh-oh
kid, you just asked for the bell, now you're up for
some schooling.
And there I stood for some 10 minutes bring
ing the superhuman world of Bo Jackson down on
this kid's adolescent shoulders in a verbal match
that could only end in an overwhelming KO.
"Bo Jackson ran a 4.2 40 on legs that had more
girth, okay, than a 747." Left jab, nice.
"Bo's first career home run is still the longest
ever at Royals Stadium and his behemoth clout in
the 1989 All-Star Game is the longest in history."
Jab jab, ya like that?
"Name another All-Star MVP. NFL All-Pro
and Heisman Trophy winner with a laser beam
fora right arm." Uppercut. Look at this kid
squirm!
"And those shoes represent the only NFL run
ning back to have rushed for two 90-plus yard
TDs ever, while blowing up defensive backs in
cartoon fashion. Still doesn't ring a bell kid?" Got
'em the ropes go for the jugulah!
"Hey, and the "Bo Knows' campaign, kid, sin
gle-handedly pushed Nike into world sports
supremacy." Let it sink in fora minute ... good.
"Soo-prem-a-c-y ...." 1 looked him up and down
stunned. "Wor-uld." Boom done. KO.
It wasn't about this kid having something I
had always wanted anymore; I had to set an ex
ample to the world, that a lack of appreciation,
of understanding, of care fora man who rede
fined the modern two-sport athlete would not be
tolerated.
How long would it be until the eyebrow rais
ing. history making abilities of Charles Barkley,
Ken Griffey Jr., Sean Austin in"The Goonies,"
Whitney Houston in her self-titled debut album
were to go unrecognized and unacknowledged? I
had to take a stand not just for myself, but for ev
eryone who ever had an idol. Where would this
stop if I didn't put my foot down here and now?
"And ya know what else bud? Bo knows you
need more than a lesson in sports history." And
that, is how we do that.
Back at my car — still floating in the satisfac
tion that I had made a difference, that somehow
every little groupie fresh off the Bow Wow tour at
every driving range everywhere would go home,
research and gape at the feats of anyone that's
ever been anyone in history — 1 changed into my
street shoes. And as I slipped on the second Adi
das Stan Smith. I froze in embarassment of my
own worthlessness.
As I slammed the car door shut in hypocritical
realization, hiding from the public the pearl casu
al / urban style I had picked out at Footaction not
for the tennis icon they represented but simply for
that all-white classic bailer steez. I could feel the
payback's fist land square on my jaw. Boom,
done. KO. For all it mattered, 1 might as well have
thrown on a wife beater and stuck a pistol stud
through my ear.
Pulling out of the parking lot in my Stan
Smiths, I took a last glance at the kid duffing balls
in those jazzy pink Jackson high tops and
promised myself if I ever saw him again. I'd be
sure to let him blow me up for wearing a collared
shirt and my "Life is Good" twill cap to the links.
You know, in the end even Bo don't know every
thing.
