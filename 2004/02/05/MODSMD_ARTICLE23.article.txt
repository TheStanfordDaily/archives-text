## Volleyball to take on Trojans, Waves 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
(5-5, 3-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration) will face two tough teams
buoyed by even tougher crowds this
week, as the Cardinal hits the road for
games at Southern California (1-8,0-5)
tonight and No. 2 Pepperdine (6-1,2-1)
on Saturday.
While the Trojans are coming off a
3-0 loss to Cal Baptist and the Waves
recently had their 18-game winning
streak snapped, the Cardinal isn't pay
ing too much attention to its oppo
nents' records. Despite the fact that
USC is winless in conference play,
Stanford head coach Don Shaw and his
players agreed that Stanford can't ap
proach tonight's game as a guaranteed
win.
"We're beginning to learn that every
single team is difficult," said junior out
side hitter David Vogel. "We have to
bring our 'A'game."
By "A" game. Vogel means the way
the Cardinal played last Friday against
UC-Santa Barbara in a thrilling five
game victory, not the way they played
last Saturday, when Stanford lost in
three games to Cal State-Northridge.
The startling difference in those match
es last weekend is a point of focus for
Stanford this week.
"We need to be emotionally consis
tent for two nights in a row," said junior
setter Kevin Hansen. "We need to put
two nights together."
Tonight's match will be in a venue
that Shaw savs is alwavs a challenge.

"We play in their old North Gym,'" said Shaw. "And for
anyone who's never been there, you won't believe they play

intercollegiate matches there."
The one-day interval between their two matches this
weekend might help Stanford avoid the consistency prob-

lem that has plagued them when playing back-to-back
nights thus far, but the Waves.
"It's really difficult to play down there," Shaw said.

"We've struggled there in the past."
In addition to overcoming the hostile road environ
ment, Stanford has to contend with the Waves' leading

outside hitters, rred Win
ters and Sean Rooney.
Winters, a senior, has
recorded 79 kills so far this
season and will he featured
on an upcoming episode of
CBS / Fox Sports Net's
"NCAA on Campus" as
one of several exceptional
Pepperdine athletes inter
viewed in short segments.
Vogel said Winters would
be a player to watch this
Saturday, while Hansen
cited Rooney, a junior with
85 kills for the season, as a
probable offensive threat.
"He's one of the best
players in the nation,"
Hansen said. Both Winters
and Rooney were selected in
2003 as Ail-Americans.
Winters and Rooney
are a large part of why Pep
perdine is ranked No. 2 in
the nation. Prior to a 3-1
loss at UCLA, the Waves
were riding an 18-game
win streak, including six
this spring season by 3-0
margins.
But last Saturday,
Pepperdine lost 3-1 to
UCLA in a match Shaw
thinks might encourage
them to come back harder at
the Cardinal.

"The good news is they're beatable," Shaw said. "The
bad news is they're coming off a loss. They're probably not
real happy about that."
