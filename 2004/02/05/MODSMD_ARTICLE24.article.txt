# Football inks 12 on National Signing Day

### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford signed 12 players to national letters of intent
yesterday, including four prep All-American offensive
linemen — including the No. 3 and No. 7 linemen in the
nation — and 11 all-region selections.

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

The selected players represent 10 states — with only
one being from California. Head Coach Buddy Teevens
has a reputation for recruiting coast-to-coast, thanks to his
background in the Southeastern Conference, and this
year's prep class reflects the emphasis the Stanford staff
places on wide-ranging recruiting.
It's difficult to compare this year's signees to those of
last year, when Teevens inked a star-studded 25 high
school seniors.
"Our class of 12 recruits is small in numbers," Teevens

admitted, "but [is] very solid."
Last year's class, which included freshman contributors
like wide receivers Mark Bradford and Evan Moore, tight
end Patrick Danahy, defensive lineman Nick Frank and
running back David Marrero — all of whom played ex
tensively as true freshmen — is hard to top. Highly touted
quarterback T.C. Ostrander and kicker-punter Jay Ot
tovegio were among last season's freshman redshirts.
However, last year's class was so large because a large
departing senior class left Stanford with many roster spots
to fill. This year's Cardinal had fewer spots to fill and, thus,
fewer scholarships to offer and players to sign — and, per
haps, fewer needs to fill as well.
"We needed depth on the offensive line and at tight end, and
we feel we were quite productive in that area," Teevens said.
Bobby Dockter. Alex Fletcher, Ben Muth and Allen
Smith comprise the excellent freshman recruiting class
that will work under the tutelage of offensive line coach
Steve Morton next season.
Super Prep ranked Fletcher as the No. 3 offensive line

man in America and Smith as No. 7.
Stanford, which used two- and three-tight-end sets last
year instead of utilizing a fullback, inked 6-foot-4, 250-
pound fullback Jerod Arlich out of Minnesota. He will be
joined in the backfield by tailback Ray Jones, an Ohio
Player of the Year candidate.
6-foot-1 Anthony Kimble of Baton Rouge, La., was the
Cardinal's other offensive recruit and accounted for 2,700
yards of total offense in his senior season.
On defense, linebacker Pat Maynor is joined by defen
sive backs Carlos McFall and Wopamo Osasai. Tight end
/ defensive end prospects Pannel Egboh and Austin Gun
der round out the Cardinal's draft class.
While sheer numbers alone make this recruiting class
unlikely to have the impact that last year's class has had
and will have, Teevens says he is happy with what the
Stanford staff was able to accomplish.
"Overall, this is a very solid class that we feel will make
a positive contribution to the Stanford football program,"
he said.
