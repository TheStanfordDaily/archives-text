# Women's water polo opens season at home
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's water
polo team opens its season this
weekend against stiff competi
tion at the Stanford Invitational
Championship. In addition to de
fending its Invitational title fora
fourth straight year, the Cardinal
is approaching the tournament as
a chance for its talented mix of
youth and experience to gel as a
team.
No. 3 Stanford will face No. 8
Michigan State (6-3), No. 2
Southern California (0-0) and
San Jose State (2-0) in a string of
games in the fourth annual invita
tional at Avery Aquatic Center.
With a history of triumphant
wins behind them, including win
ning the Stanford invitational
every year since its inception, the
Cardinal enters the season with
plenty of confidence. Still, the
Cardinal emphasizes the impor
tance of staying humble.
"[The upperclassmen] have
had a lot of success," said Stan
ford head coach John Tanner,
"but we are still diligent about
training and excited about
preparing for this weekend."
This view works well for the
young team, which is composed
mostly of sophomores and fresh
men, who not only have to deal
with honing their skills during
the season but also deal with be
coming closer as a team. Two ju
niors and three seniors, including
driver Shannon Averett, defend
er Wendy Watkins and driver
Lauren Faust, return from last
year's squad.
"Seniors, we only have three,
but they are good players and
leaders," said Tanner, emphasiz
ing the importance that veteran
players have on a young team.
And while Stanford's coach high
lights his seniors, he is quick to
mention the talent and level of
maturity of the younger players.

"Our freshmen and sophomores
are better prepared to handle the
competition."
As the season progresses,
Stanford will continue working
on certain steps. Tanner is cur
rently wrapping up a period of
emphasis on "individual skills
and trying to improve each play
er's ability." Therefore the
team's focus this weekend will be
on themselves and on becoming
better as individual players and
as a team.
"We won't concentrate on the
other teams but on applying our
own tactics," Tanner said.
Stanford hopes to see good
things in its first matchup this sea
son. A win would propel the Car
dinal into the long season ahead
with energy and the confidence
that helped the reigning Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation
champions win 17 games and a
top seed in the NCAA Champi
onships last season.
"It gives us the opportunity to
get out on the right foot," Tanner
said. "There will be four other
strong teams and it is important
to match with those other four
teams and see what [we need] to
work on. We will be able to eval
uate where and what we need to
work on to get better."
Whether things go well or not,
Stanford is already looking opti
mistically toward the future at
the NCAA Championships.
Since only four teams out of the
country's 60 or so teams make it
to the finals, as Tanner explains,
"every game counts. We need to
start strong toward having a
good chance [in the conference
championship]."
The Cardinal will square off
against the Spartans and Trojans
on Saturday and then face San
Jose on Sunday morning. Stan
ford is in bracket 'A' along with
its aforementioned opponents.
The Spartans come into the
weekend off two consecutive

wins while Michigan State is rid
ing a two-game losing streak.
Like Stanford, the Trojans will
kick off their season this week
end.

Bracket B' consists of No. 7
California (0-0), No. 9 Hawaii (0-
0). Santa Clara (3-0) and the Car
dinal's rival, the No. 1 (0-0)
UCLA. The Bruins defeated the

Cardinal in a close match last sea
son for the NCAA title.
The winners of their respec
tive brackets will play in the
championship game on Sunday.
