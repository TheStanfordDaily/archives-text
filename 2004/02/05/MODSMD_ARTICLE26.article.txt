# Swimming goes clubbing

### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim team travels down to
Southern California for some intriguing competition
this Friday and Saturday. A few hours after arrival, the
team will head to the Soka University campus to com
pete in an exhibition meet against Nova Aquatics, one
of the top club teams in the country. The following day,
the Cardinal (5-0, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference) will take
on Southern California in its penultimate Pac-1() dual
meet. Although Saturday's meet against USC is official
and will count towards the Pac-10 standings, the faster
and more interesting of the meets will come against
Nova tomorrow.
Nova Aquatics has long been one of the most suc
cessful club swimming teams in the United States. Head
coach Dave Salo has produced numerous Olympic
medalists and NCAA champions. Nova currently has
about 18 male post-college Olympic Trials qualifiers reg
istered to its name, most of whom will be competing on
Friday. With the Olympic Trials just a few short months
away and the NCAA championships even closer, this ex
hibition meet should yield some extremely fast times
from both sides.
One of the most exciting events of the meet should be
the 100-yard backstroke. Nova's backstroker at the meet
will be Lenny Krayzelburg. After setting a world record
in the 100-meter backstroke in 1999, Krayzelburg be
came one of swimming's few superstars after winning the
gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke at the 2000
Olympic games. However, Krayzelburg has hit a few
bumps on his road back to Olympic glory and is not as in
vincible as he was during his route to the games in Syd
ney. Just last week at the New York World Cup in Long

Island, former Stanford backstroker Randall Bal, Class
of 2003, beat Krayzelburg. This Friday, two-time NCAA
champion Peter Marshall will attempt to continue the
trend of Stanford backstroke domination over the rest of
the world's best.
Another focal point of the meet will be the sprint
freestyle events, mainly because Nova superstar Jason
Lezak heads the field in the 50- and 100-yard freestyle
events. Lezak currently holds the fifth-fastest time in
American history in the 50-meter freestyle and repre
sented the United States this past summer at the World
Championships. Currently the fastest and most powerful
sprinter in the nation, Lezak will present a formidable
challenge for Cardinal sprinters. The Cardinal, however,
does not plan to roll over easily. Bringing their own mix
of stars to the table, including Marshall, Austrian na
tional champion Markus Rogan and American national
champion Gary Marshall, the team believes it can pro
vide ample competition for Nova's All-Star team of
post-grads.
After Friday's slugfest of swimming powerhouses,
Saturday's meet against USC will provide a change of
gear for the Cardinal. Bringing an undefeated record
into the meet, the Cardinal will simply look to maintain
its momentum going into its final meet against Cal.
Some of Stanford's swimmers will swim "off" events,
as No. 10 USC is not expected to put up too much of a
fight. The Cardinal, however, refuses to look past the
USC meet because it will provide yet another precious
opportunity to race in the unfamiliar short-course me
ters format, the course that will be swum at NCAAs in
March.
