# Wrestlers confident, winning
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Coming off three consecutive dual meet victories, the
Stanford wrestling team (6-4,3-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
headed to the All-Cal Invitational last weekend with a
confidence unparalleled in recent years.
With only five of his 10 starters making the trip, Stan
ford head coach Steve Buddies' squad placed second as a
team with five Stanford grapplers placing in the top three
of their respective weight classes.
Freshman Tanner Gardner placed second, winning
his first two bouts of the day before falling to Bakers
field's Efren Ceballos in the final, who is ranked No. 7 in
the nation at 125 pounds and was named the tourna
ment's most outstanding wrestler.
On the strength of two pins, sophomore Imad Khar
bush took home second-place honors at 174, while
Shawn Ritzenthaler and John Garfinkel finished third at
285 and 184 pounds, respectively.
Not surprisingly, Stanford's most impressive showing
at the tournament came from the 157-pound weight
class. What was surprising, however, is that it came from
junior Marcus Glass.
Starting in place of junior co-captain Matt Gentry,
who was preparing for the NWCA All-Star Classic in
lowa two days later, Glass recorded four pins in five
matches en route to a third-place finish.
Gentry's day off served him well at the All-Star Clas
sic, which pits two of the nation's best wrestlers in each
weight class against each other. Ranked No. 4 at 157
pounds heading into Monday's exhibition, Gentry de

feated Ohio's Jake Percival, who was ranked No. 3,13-10
to remain undefeated this season at 30-0.
"It was quite an honor to be selected, the first Stan
ford guy ever and the only Pac-10 athlete to go and com
pete this year." Gentry said. "These matches don't mean
much compared to the NCAA tournament, so I'm just
glad I got some great competition before March."
Gentry is not the only Cardinal wrestler enjoying a
line season, as several other wrestlers — including junior
Brad Metzler, sophomore Luis Vendrell and freshman
Brian Perry — have also been instrumental to Stanford's
recent surge.
The Cardinal's string of team success began with a 31-
6 beating of Oregon at home on Jan. 15. It was the Car
dinal's first win over the Ducks since 1995.
Stanford followed that performance with a 20-12 de
feat of Cal Poly on the road and a 24-9 win over Cal State
Fullerton last Friday.
Stanford's recent success is in stark contrast to the
tailspin the team endured in the second half of last sea
son when the squad finished 3-12.
So what's been the difference?
"1 think the biggest change is attitude," Gentry said.
"As a team, we have much more confidence and belief in
ourselves when we step out on the mat."
"We've worked harder than ever to make sure last
year doesn't happen again, so this feeling is extra gratify
ing for all the work we've put in. We've earned our suc
cess, and that's the best kind of success."
Stanford returns to action this Saturday at home in
Burnham Pavilion against Oregon State. The meet will
begin at I p.m.
