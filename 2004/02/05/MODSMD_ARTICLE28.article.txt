# Synchro sinks William & Mary at Invitational
## 
### 
The No. 2 Stanford synchronized swimming
team began its season by sweeping all events at the
William and Mary Invitational last Saturday, swim
ming to victory against the No. 12-ranked host team.
The Cardinal snatched the lead at the start of the
competition and never relinquished it, soundly de
feating its East Coast rivals.
Stanford's A-squad set the tone for the victory,
snagging the top eight spots in the elements compe
tition, which out-placed Willam and Mary and Mary
Washington's best swimmers. Former Olympic
Team member Katie Norris claimed the title in the
event, followed by Samantha Bongiovanni-Duclos,
Ashley McHugh, Jennifer Kibler, Cassidy Ramage,
Courtney Penn, Sheila Sadovnik and Mari
Maekawa.
The Cardinal then proved its strength in trio and
duet by placing routines first and second in each
event. Bongiovanni-Duclos, McHugh and Norris
scored a 91 out of a perfect 100, with the trio of Ki
bler. Ramage and Sadovnik just four points behind.
Bongiovanni-Duclos and McHugh secured another
first-place ranking in duet, followed by teammates
Maekawa and Penn in second, and the Tribe's top
duet in third.
But the Stanford sweep did not stop there. Nor
ris wowed the packed audience with an impressive
solo to Cirque du Soleil, scoring a 94.83 to best
William and Mary's Kim Marsh. Norris then paired
up with teammates Bongiovanni-Duclos, Kibler,
Maekawa, McHugh, Penn, Ramage and Sadovnik
to oust the William and Mary squad in the team rou

tine competition, scoring a 94.33 to the Tribe's
83.83.
Naturally, the syncrho team is optimistic about
the remainder of the season.
"To come off with a win at our opening meet
feels great," sophomore Ramage said, 'it really
gives us confidence going into our season, which so
important if we want to have what it takes to win the
national championship."
But when asked if the results of the invitational
foreshadowed a 2004 NCAA Championship title,
fellow sophomore Penn noted, "We swam really
well for our first competition, but there are a lot of
glitches in our performances that need to be worked
out before we take on Ohio. Fixing these issues
needs to be our number one priority, and we can't
let an overwhelming win like this make us lose sight
of that."
If the squad etches out a win against the Buck
eyes at this year's collegiate nationals in Ann Arbor,
it would mark the third championship in the history
of Stanford synchro. Such a victory would be the
first for all team members, as the last time Stanford
captured gold was in 1998.
"I have no doubt that we deserve that title this
year," Ramage said. "It's just a matter of proving
we deserve it to Ohio and the judges."
Stanford will be away this weekend, taking on
No. 6 Texas and No. 7 Washington, respectively.
They come back next week for their first home meet
of the season against No. 3 Alabama on Feb. 14 at
noon.
