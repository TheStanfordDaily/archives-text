# Shorthanded Card faces tall order
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend was supposed to be Matt Haryasz's
chance to show Stanford fans — and the nation — what
he showed Oregon last week: that he has the potential
to be the next great Cardinal big man.
Senior forward Justin Davis, the team's leading re
bounder and third-leading scorer, is out for several
weeks with a knee injury. Haryasz played superbly in
Davis' absence last weekend against Oregon and Ore
gon State, recording 29 points, 14 rebounds and seven
blocks in the two games, and he was expected to get his
first home starts against Arizona State and Arizona.
Instead, Haryasz sprained his ankle in practice on
Tuesday and may still be on crutches during tonight's
game against the Sun Devils at Maples Pavilion.
When he first went down, it was as though the team
couldn't bring itself to acknowledge that yet another
one of its big men had just suffered an injury. Practice
went on like nothing had happened. But as the lanky
sophomore continued to lie sprawled on the floor where
he had fallen, it became clear that his injury wasn't
going to go away on its own, and a trainer arrived on the
scene to help him.
Beating Arizona State and Arizona without Davis
already figured to be a tall order. When Haryasz got in
jured, the order got taller even as the Cardinal's starting
lineup got shorter. Stanford will now likely face the Sun
Devils and the Wildcats with 6-foot-6 forward Nick
Robinson starting at power forward, rather than the 6-
foot-9 Davis or 6-foot-10 Haryasz.
The team hasn't confirmed that Haryasz will miss
both games, and no one would comment after practice
on his injury, but it appears unlikely that he would be
back at full strength so soon.
"We've still got Nick, we've got Joe [Kirchofer],"
Haryasz said before getting injured on Tuesday, an
swering a question about what would happen if he were
to get in foul trouble this weekend. "We've still got
guys who can come in. I mean, the cupboard's not
bare."
Maybe not, but no longer is it overflowing, either.
The No. 2 Cardinal (18-0, 9-0 Pacific 10 Conference)
beat both Arizona teams in January partly because of its
superiority in the paint. Stanford's size and depth in the
paint neutralized Sun Devil star big man Ike Diogu and
Wildcat center Channing Frye. Now Stanford is both
small and thin at the inside positions, and the visiting
stars might be able to take advantage by playing more
aggressively.
Arizona State's Diogu may be the conference's most
powerful inside presence. The 6-foot-8, 250-pound
sophomore is leading the Pac-10 in scoring with 22.6
points per game and is third in rebounding with 8.7 per
game. The big man also hits an impressive 82 percent of
his foul shots, allowing him to take advantage of his op
ponents' physical play, which routinely puts him on the
free-throw line.
That puts the onus on Stanford center Rob Little to
stay out of foul trouble. The 6-foot-10junior spent most
of the Oregon game on the bench because he managed
to pick up four fouls in just five minutes of play. He will
also be counted on to step up his production, since he
will be the Cardinal's main threat to score and rebound
in the post.
Little said he's ready to perform if called on.
"Somebody's got to pick it up," Little said. "Whether
it's going to be me, who knows. If it's personally me who
has that role against Arizona or Arizona State, that's
how it's going to happen.
"We're going to play toward whoever has the best
matchup, and that could be anybody, it depends on how
we're being played that game," he added. "Whether
they're going to have Diogu in the post trying to get me
in foul trouble, I don't know what [Arizona State head
coach Rob] Evans' plan is going to be."
It's a good bet that Diogu will be the focal point of
Evans' plans, whatever they are. The Sun Devils have
only one other player averaging in double figures, ju
nior sharpshooter Stevie Moore.

Senior swingman Jamal Hill has also been shooting
well of late for the Sun Devils, averaging 13.8 points per
game in his last five contests. Point guard Jason Braxton
is less of a scoring threat but distributes the ball well (5.1
assists per game) and came up with a school-record
tying six steals in last Thursday's loss at Washington
State.
While the Sun Devils are physical and boast one of
the conference's top players in Diogu, they have had
trouble putting points on the board and are ranked dead
last in the conference standings at 2-7 (8-10 overall).
The Wildcats, ranked second in the conference be
hind Stanford, are a scarier opponent. They have spent
most of the season bouncing around the top 10 of the
national rankings, and they were everyone's preseason
pick to beat out the Cardinal for the conference crown.
With a shocking loss at resurgent Washington last
weekend, Arizona (14-4,6-3) dropped to No. 12 in the

national rankings. But they are still considered the
biggest threat, among the teams remaining on the
Cardinal's schedule, to defeat Stanford partly be-

cause they boast several of the most talented
players in the conference and partly because
they have defeated Stanford in Maples Pavilion
three years in a row.
"We've had good success at Stanford," Ari
zona head coach Lute Olson said. "The circum-

stances could be very similar to a few years ago,
when we went in there when they were unde
feated and ranked No. 1 [and won, 68-65]. But
they have played consistently well and they de
serve to be where they are at the conclusion of the
first round [of conference games]."

Arizona, like Stanford, is a team without one
clear star. Frye, at 6-foot-11, is the conference's best
pure center, averaging 15.1 points and 7.4 rebounds per
game. At 6-foot-4, sophomore forward Hassan Adams
is undersized compared to most forwards, but should

match up well against Robinson. Being short doesn't
stop him from being a wrecking ball in the paint,
and he is averaging 16.7 points and 7.3 rebounds

per game.
Rounding out the Wildcats' starting lineup
are cat-quick freshman point guard Mustafa
Shakur, sophomore forward Andre Iguodala,
who is second in the conference with 8.9 re
bounds per game, and junior guard Salim

Stoudamire. a dangerous 3-point shooter.
Last time the teams met, Stanford played per-

haps its best all-around game of the season, building
a 20-point second-half lead en route to an 82-72 victory
over the favored Wildcats in Tucson. Josh Childress
scored 19 and Matt Lottich 17 as the Cardinal overpow
ered and out-executed the quicker Wildcats. Also, Ari
zona was just plain cold from outside, hitting only four
of its 21 3-point attempts.
Lately, Lottich has been cold himself, and he will
need to shake his slump if Stanford is to emerge from
the weekend with its perfect season intact. Lottich said
defenses have been paying more attention to him re
cently and he has to adjust.
"Generally the guy who's guarding me has zero help
responsibilities, which kind of eliminates any chance I
have of getting wide-open baskets," he said. "So now
I've got to be more effective coming off screens and
whatnot to get my shot off."
If Arizona has a major weakness, it's defense — the
Wildcats are allowing 76.7 points per game. That could
mean that Lottich and Childress will have more open
looks on Saturday than they've seen in recent weeks.
But mainly that statistic is a byproduct of Arizona's
wide-open style of play, a style that's rare in the Pac-10
this season.
If all goes as expected, Thursday's game will be a
tough, physical contest featuring half-court offense and
defense. Saturday's game will be a struggle between
Stanford's disciplined half-court game and Arizona's
run-and-gun approach. And if the Cardinal can beat
both teams, without Davis or Haryasz, they will deserve
every compliment that has been heaped upon them so
far during their 18-game win streak.
