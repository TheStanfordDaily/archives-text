# No. 7 women set for desert duels

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
(17-3,10-1 Pacific-10 Conference) hits the road this
weekend to defend its top spot in the Pac-10 against
Arizona (16-5,8-2) tonight and Arizona State (13-4,
7-3) on Saturday. Stanford regained sole possession
of first place with a pair of home victories against the
Washington schools.
The Cardinal is without freshman center Kristen
Newlin, who went down with a knee injury against
Washington last Thursday. The team is "conscious
ly optimistic" about the results of her MRI this past
Monday.
"Our orthopedic surgeon wanted to go beyond
the MRI and do a scope to make sure there's not
any ACL damage," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "The MRI was positive as far as it
looked good. I think the physical testing was good.
They're just testing it."
Arizona, which was tied with Stanford for first
place in the conference last week, fell 68-80 to the Sun
Devils last weekend in Teinpe. Arizona State junior
guard Kylan Loney was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week after she scored a career-high 32 points in their
victory. She also made a career-high 5-of-8 shots
from behind the 3-point line. Loney's 32 were the
most points scored by a Sun Devil since Jan. 8,1997.
The Wildcats will have a lot to prove during their
showdown with Stanford this evening in Tucson.
Arizona gave up 15 3-pointers to the Cardinal,
which shot 59.5 percent overall, in the teams' last
meeting, an 84-62 Stanford victory back on Jan. 10.
"Arizona's going to focus a lot more on our out
side players," said junior forward Azella Perryman.
Junior guard Dee-Dee Wheeler leads the Wild
cats at 17.6 points per game, followed by sophomore
center Shawntinice Polk (15.8) and senior guard
AimeeGrzyb(lo.4).
Polk, who went out with an injury during the
teams' last meeting, will be a tough assignment for
Stanford's inside players.
"To guard Polk is a challenge," VanDerveer said.
"The thing we lack with Kristen out is defensive re

bounding, but I would rank Chelsea ahead of Kristen
in post defense. I think she's [moving well enough]."
The Cardinal leads the all-time series, 36-11, but
the Wildcats beat the Cardinal 79-64 in their meet
ing in Tucson last year.
The Sun Devils are on a three-game winning
streak and their 7-3 conference record is their best
start since the 2001-02 season, when they won the
Pac-10 Tournament and made it to the second
round of the NCAA Tournament.
"I think they're having a great year," Van-
Derveer said. "They really buy into playing ex
tremely aggressive defensively and they play ex
tremely hard. I think it's a real credit to [Sun Devils
head coach] Charli [Turner Thorne]."
Perryman said the team is ready to take on the
Sun Devils' pressure defense.
"If you can get a couple of open threes, they'll
have to back it off," she said.
Junior guard Betsy Boardman (12.1 points per
game) leads Arizona State in scoring, followed by
sophomore forward Kristen Kovesdy (11.8) and
Loney (11.6). All three are also averaging double
figures for the season.
Stanford leads the all-time series 36-9, with their
most recent win coming on Jan. 8 at Maples, 60-46.
Both games last weekend were prime examples of
how effective Stanford can be when the ball is spread
around the court. Last Thursday's game against
Washington was the Cardinal's best team showing of
the season.
"I thought we did a great job," VanDerveer said.
"T'Nae got 10 shots [against Washington State],
which I think is the most in any game. Azella had 11
in the game [against Washington], which is her ca
reer high.
"We had 10 turnovers in both games, when
we've been getting 20 in one," VanDerveer said.
"We did a really nice job of passing the ball, getting
the ball inside. Washington State chose to defend us
inside out. We were open from the perimeter, which
is not how most teams are going to play us."
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in eight categories
at this point in the season, including free throw per
centage (81.8 percent). 3-point field goal percentage

(39.3 percent), made 3-pointers (157) and defensive
rebounds (26.8 per game). Stanford fell one 3-point
er short of setting the Cardinal's single-game record
on Saturday, making 15-of-31 from 3-point range.
Senior forward Nicolle Powell continues to lead
Stanford with 21.1 points and 11.1 rebounds per
game. She just missed a triple-double with 15 points,
10 assists and nine rebounds against the Cougars.
This weekend is a trip home for Powell.
"I think Nicole plays really well in Arizona,"
VanDerveer said. "She does take a lot of pride in
being from Phoenix and I think her teammates want
to play well for her. Maybe its a little extra boost."
"This is Nicole's last Stanford game back home,"
Perryman said. "Everyone wants her to go out with
a bang."
Junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu (8.3 points
per game), junior guard Susan Borchardt (8.3) and
junior guard Kelley Suminksi (8.0) are the team's
other leading scorers.
Perryman has been steadily improving this sea
son, and the Cardinal's new strategy to get the ball
down to the post players has paid off. She scored
eight points in 15 minutes against Washington State
and 15 points against Washington, in what Van-
Derveer called Perryman's best game of the season.
"It's going really well," Perryman said. "We've
been practicing a couple of drills that are making the
guards pass it around and not dribble as much."
VanDerveer expects tough games on the road
this weekend.
"It's going to be a brawl, more so Arizona State
than against Arizona," she said. "We've got to bring
our 'A' game down."
The Pac-10 has seen several shake-ups in the first
half of conference play. Southern California's loss
to Oregon State and Arizona's defeat at the hands
of Arizona State last weekend are only the latest in
a series of upsets. While in the past only Stanford
has gotten much attention, the entire conference is
slowly gaining national prestige.
"It speaks to parity in the league and the fact that
the teams are getting better," Perryman said.
Saturday's game against Arizona State will be
broadcast at 12:00 noon on Fox Sports Net.

Both games last weekend were prime examples of
how effective Stanford can be when the ball is spread

Washington was the Cardinal's best team showing of
the season.
"I thought we did a great job," VanDerveer said.
"T'Nae got 10 shots [against Washington State],
which I think is the most in any game. Azella had 11
in the game [against Washington], which is her ca
reer high.
"We had 10 turnovers in both games, when
we've been getting 20 in one," VanDerveer said.
"We did a really nice job of passing the ball, getting
the ball inside. Washington State chose to defend us
inside out. We were open from the perimeter, which
is not how most teams are going to play us."
The Cardinal leads the Pac-10 in eight categories
at this point in the season, including free throw per
centage (81.8 percent). 3-point field goal percentage

(39.3 percent), made 3-pointers (157) and defensive
rebounds (26.8 per game). Stanford fell one 3-point
er short of setting the Cardinal's single-game record
on Saturday, making 15-of-31 from 3-point range.
Senior forward Nicolle Powell continues to lead
Stanford with 21.1 points and 11.1 rebounds per
game. She just missed a triple-double with 15 points,
10 assists and nine rebounds against the Cougars.
This weekend is a trip home for Powell.
"I think Nicole plays really well in Arizona,"
VanDerveer said. "She does take a lot of pride in
being from Phoenix and I think her teammates want
to play well for her. Maybe its a little extra boost."
"This is Nicole's last Stanford game back home,"
Perryman said. "Everyone wants her to go out with
a bang."
Junior forward Sebnem Kimyacioglu (8.3 points
per game), junior guard Susan Borchardt (8.3) and
junior guard Kelley Suminksi (8.0) are the team's
other leading scorers.
Perryman has been steadily improving this sea
son, and the Cardinal's new strategy to get the ball
down to the post players has paid off. She scored
eight points in 15 minutes against Washington State
and 15 points against Washington, in what Van-
Derveer called Perryman's best game of the season.
"It's going really well," Perryman said. "We've
been practicing a couple of drills that are making the
guards pass it around and not dribble as much."
VanDerveer expects tough games on the road
this weekend.
"It's going to be a brawl, more so Arizona State
than against Arizona," she said. "We've got to bring
our 'A' game down."
The Pac-10 has seen several shake-ups in the first
half of conference play. Southern California's loss
to Oregon State and Arizona's defeat at the hands
of Arizona State last weekend are only the latest in
a series of upsets. While in the past only Stanford
has gotten much attention, the entire conference is
slowly gaining national prestige.
"It speaks to parity in the league and the fact that
the teams are getting better," Perryman said.
Saturday's game against Arizona State will be
broadcast at 12:00 noon on Fox Sports Net.
The No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
(17-3,10-1 Pacific-10 Conference) hits the road this
weekend to defend its top spot in the Pac-10 against
Arizona (16-5,8-2) tonight and Arizona State (13-4,
7-3) on Saturday. Stanford regained sole possession
of first place with a pair of home victories against the
Washington schools.
The Cardinal is without freshman center Kristen
Newlin, who went down with a knee injury against
Washington last Thursday. The team is "conscious
ly optimistic" about the results of her MRI this past
Monday.
"Our orthopedic surgeon wanted to go beyond
the MRI and do a scope to make sure there's not
any ACL damage," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "The MRI was positive as far as it
looked good. I think the physical testing was good.
They're just testing it."
Arizona, which was tied with Stanford for first
place in the conference last week, fell 68-80 to the Sun
Devils last weekend in Teinpe. Arizona State junior
guard Kylan Loney was named Pac-10 Player of the
Week after she scored a career-high 32 points in their
victory. She also made a career-high 5-of-8 shots
from behind the 3-point line. Loney's 32 were the
most points scored by a Sun Devil since Jan. 8,1997.
The Wildcats will have a lot to prove during their
showdown with Stanford this evening in Tucson.
Arizona gave up 15 3-pointers to the Cardinal,
which shot 59.5 percent overall, in the teams' last
meeting, an 84-62 Stanford victory back on Jan. 10.
"Arizona's going to focus a lot more on our out
side players," said junior forward Azella Perryman.
Junior guard Dee-Dee Wheeler leads the Wild
cats at 17.6 points per game, followed by sophomore
center Shawntinice Polk (15.8) and senior guard
AimeeGrzyb(lo.4).
Polk, who went out with an injury during the
teams' last meeting, will be a tough assignment for
Stanford's inside players.
"To guard Polk is a challenge," VanDerveer said.
"The thing we lack with Kristen out is defensive re

bounding, but I would rank Chelsea ahead of Kristen
in post defense. I think she's [moving well enough]."
The Cardinal leads the all-time series, 36-11, but
the Wildcats beat the Cardinal 79-64 in their meet
ing in Tucson last year.
The Sun Devils are on a three-game winning
streak and their 7-3 conference record is their best
start since the 2001-02 season, when they won the
Pac-10 Tournament and made it to the second
round of the NCAA Tournament.
"I think they're having a great year," Van-
Derveer said. "They really buy into playing ex
tremely aggressive defensively and they play ex
tremely hard. I think it's a real credit to [Sun Devils
head coach] Charli [Turner Thorne]."
Perryman said the team is ready to take on the
Sun Devils' pressure defense.
"If you can get a couple of open threes, they'll
have to back it off," she said.
Junior guard Betsy Boardman (12.1 points per
game) leads Arizona State in scoring, followed by
sophomore forward Kristen Kovesdy (11.8) and
Loney (11.6). All three are also averaging double
figures for the season.
Stanford leads the all-time series 36-9, with their
most recent win coming on Jan. 8 at Maples, 60-46.
Both games last weekend were prime examples of
how effective Stanford can be when the ball is spread
around the court. Last Thursday's game against
Washington was the Cardinal's best team showing of
the season.
"I thought we did a great job," VanDerveer said.
"T'Nae got 10 shots [against Washington State],
which I think is the most in any game. Azella had 11
