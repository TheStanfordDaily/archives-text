# Police chief discusses sexual assault

### MELISSA FUSCO 
Students gathered at the Women's Community
Center last night to discuss sexual assault policy
and prevention with Stanford Police Chief Laura
Wilson. Much of the discussion centered on the
factors that prevented victims of sexual assault
from coming forward.
The talk, entitled "Taking Action Against Sex
ual Assault," is third in the "Women's Wellness"
series of events taking place at the Fire Truck
House.
Representatives from different campus orga
nizations, including the Women's Center, Judi
cial Affairs, Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS) and the Stanford Police discussed
the importance of creating a safe environment for
students and the many options available to sur
vivors of assault.
Freshman Dina Howard said that she was "real
ly surprised, but nonetheless glad" to learn about

different counseling and treatment services, as well
as the sources of information regarding judicial or
legal action when an incident occurs.
Many students expressed concern over creating
a balance between presenting the variety of options
available to students and the threat of "overwhelm
ing" a student who comes forward with informa
tion. Wilson discussed issues relating to sexual as
sault on campus, including parties, the difficulties
surrounding consent under the influence of alcohol
and the difficulty of "setting the record straight"
about reported incidents while respecting the priva
cy of the persons involved.
Under federal law, Stanford is required to release
statistics about reported crime rates to the public.
Sexual assault is one of the nine crimes which the law
covers, and the information is available through
Stanford's Department of Public Safety Web site.
However, the group agreed that sexual assault is
often an underreported crime. One student ex
pressed concern that too much attention was fo

cused on "blaming the victim" for provoking an at
tack, at a time when she is already likely to feel
ashamed and confused, prompting many victims to
drop their complaints.
They also considered ways in which more in
formation could be gathered — perhaps anony
mously — about the prevalence of sexual miscon
duct on campus.
"This meeting confirmed for me that there is in
deed an automatic doubt that is evoked from peo
ple whenever an alleged victim comes forward,"
Howard said. "When you are accused of plagari
asm, you don't have this uproar... Why is this so
with sexual assault?"
Wilson reminded the group that a victim is enti
tled to anonymity, both in the legal, police process
and in the case of action through the University's Ju
dicial Affairs Committee.
"I would like to see more people come for
ward," she said. "To change the community, peo
ple must speak out."
