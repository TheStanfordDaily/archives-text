## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
Stanford professors Heinz and Cleo Eulau died
within five days of each other from bone cancer and
heart failure, respectively. The couple had been mar
ried for 57 years and spent a combined 50 years teach
ing at the University.
Mr. Eulau, 88, was the William Bennett Munro Pro
fessor of Political Science, Emeritus and specialized in
legislative research and the theory and practice of politi
cal representation and electoral behavior, according to
the Stanford Report. Mrs. Eulau, 80, was an adjunct clin
ical professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Be
havioral Sciences.
Mr. Eulau had been teaching at Stanford since 1958.
In the 19605, he taught two current Stanford political sci
ence professors, Norman Nie and John Ferejohn. Nie re
members Eulau's long post-dinner discussions with his
graduate students that went long into the morning.
"We called them Eulauthons," Nie said to the Stan
ford Report. "He really stretched himself intellectually.
He gave of himself selflessly to his students."
Mr. Eulau also served as president of the American
Political Science Association from 1971 to 1972. In 1986,
the association established the Heinz Eulau Award to
pay tribute to his contributions to the field. In 2002, the
Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society,
headed by Nie, established the Heinz Eulau Political Be
havior Fellowship at Stanford.
Mr. Eulau also took the time to connect with younger
faculty members, especially fellow Germans like himself.
"I remember Heinz Eulau as a wonderful mentor of
younger faculty — very critical, very fair, very helpful,"
said Hans N. Weiler. professor of education and political
science emeritus. "I learned a lot from him when I moved
from my background in the historical kind of political sci
ence that I had learned in Germany to the kind of empir
ical research that began to dominate American political
science in the "60s and 70s. He took a lot of time looking
over my first stumbling efforts in this territory, and gave
me some very good advice."
Mrs. Eulau was the first nonmedical faculty member
of the medical school's psychiatry department. She es
tablished the Cleo Eulau Center for Children and Ado
lescents in Palo Alto with some of her colleagues in 1994.
There are 24 social workers at the center that go to local
schools and offer assistance to troubled youth. In addi
tion, she trained countless social workers and cared for
patients up until three weeks before her death.
"She certainly was widely known and respected and
made enormous contributions to children and parents in
this area and beyond," said John Glathe, a voluntary clin
ical faculty member of psychiatry.
A memorial celebration of the Eulaus' lives will be
held Tuesday, March 2, at 4 p.m. at Memorial Church.
