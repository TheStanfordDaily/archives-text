# Group promotes gay marriage rights

### MARY STONE 
As the national debate over gay marriages continues, a new student or
ganization hopes to raise awareness about the subject and mobilize stu
dents against a potential constitutional amendment that would threaten
gay marital rights.
Freshmen Sam Altman and Vinni Intersimone decided to take action
after President George W. Bush's State of the Union address last month.
In the speech. Bush expressed support for the possibility of a constitu
tional amendment that would only recognize heterosexual relationships
as marriages.
Altman and Intersimone created ForGayMarriage.org to inform and
motivate students to act against the amendment.
In a grant proposal to the Stanford Pride Organization, Altman. the
group's executive director, explained how it hoped to achieve its goal:
"Through a double-edged publicity program, we will use a traditional, grass
roots ad campaign of flyers and posters to mobilize students across the na
tion, while simultaneously appealing to all age groups nationwide through a
modern, online information campaign of articles, news and forums."
Altman and Intersimone have set up a Web site that allows members
to sign up for the e-mail list and provides a brief outline of their beliefs.
According to the Web site, the group "stand[s| for equal rights, for
the modernization of marriage so that every citizen may have the op
portunity to experience and benefit from an institution as old as civi
lization itself."
Once they have established a membership base on the Stanford cam
pus, the organizers hope to expand their campaign to include college
students nationwide and the greater population in an effort to influence
legislation.
If the Web site receives enough support, Altman hopes to incorporate
more functions.
"Another feature we would eventually like to add to the site is one that
would allow a user to enter his or her zip code and get the e-mail address
es and phone numbers of his or her senators and representatives," he said.
"We could then urge all members to contact their senators and represen
tatives, both at a state and local level."
Campus opinions on the subject of gay marriage are mixed.
"In a country where church and state are supposedly separated, there
should be no reason not to recognize any two human beings as legally mar
ried," said freshman Ali Batouli. "I support them."
However, some students were less certain.
"I think that the organization is in a tough situation because gay
marriage is such a controversial issue often associated with morals
and ideals," said junior Sarah Belton. "The problem is that gay mar
riage is not an issue of right or wrong: it's a matter of what is legally
applicable."
Other students found different reasons to support the group.
"I'm all for it," said junior Miya Woolfalk. "I believe that regardless
of a person's political stance, our campus should be a place that fosters
organizing for political and social movements, as long as the move
ments do not actively espouse ideas that marginalize other groups of
people."
Regardless of public opinion, the founders ForGayMarriage.org be
lieves that through their Web site they can bring awareness to their cause.
"There are millions of 18 to 22 year olds that did not get to vote in the
last presidential election that do get to vote this year, and this group has
the potential to make a substantial difference," Altman said. "We will
convince students and young adults that the America of inequality being
built by Bush is not the America they want to inherit."
