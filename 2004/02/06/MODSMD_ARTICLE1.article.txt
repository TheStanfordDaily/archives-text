Author, actress and comedian
Aisha Tyler stressed the importance
of individualism at a comedic routine
last night in Kresge Auditorium,
where she read excerpts from her
new book.
In a speech sponsored by the
Black Community Services Center,
the African American Studies pro
gram and the Stanford Bookstore,
Tyler discussed pop culture from a
female perspective — the theme of
her new book "Swerve: A Guide to
the Sweet Life for the Postmodern
Girl."
Tyler commenced the evening by
reading an excerpt called "The Uppi

outspoken men and outspoken
women are described.
"Instead of calling her articulate
or outspoken, you call her sassy,"
Tyler said. "Men are socialized to be

have to earn it."
Tyler expressed typically feminist
viewpoints, but when audience mem
bers questioned how she reconciled

the entertainment industry — which
often reinforces stereotypes and em
phasizes the superficial — she ex
pressed no regret for her decisions.
"It's a culture hell bent on beauty
and thinness," Tyler said of the indus
try. "But people can succeed if they
have a sense of self."
Tyler discussed situations in
which the ideals of feminism and
femininity might clash — touching
on everything from bikini waxes to
weight.
"A lot of young women don't want
to own feminism because it feels dog
matic," Tyler said. "You should be able
