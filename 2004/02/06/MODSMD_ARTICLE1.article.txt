### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Author, actress and comedian
Aisha Tyler stressed the importance
of individualism at a comedic routine
last night in Kresge Auditorium,
where she read excerpts from her
new book.
In a speech sponsored by the
Black Community Services Center,
the African American Studies pro
gram and the Stanford Bookstore,
Tyler discussed pop culture from a
female perspective — the theme of
her new book "Swerve: A Guide to
the Sweet Life for the Postmodern
Girl."
Tyler commenced the evening by
reading an excerpt called "The Uppi
ty Bitch Paradox," in which she ad
dresses on the different ways in which
outspoken men and outspoken
women are described.
"Instead of calling her articulate
or outspoken, you call her sassy,"
Tyler said. "Men are socialized to be
brazen — it's their birthright, but we
have to earn it."
Tyler expressed typically feminist
viewpoints, but when audience mem
bers questioned how she reconciled
her philosophies with her career in
the entertainment industry — which
often reinforces stereotypes and em
phasizes the superficial — she ex
pressed no regret for her decisions.
"It's a culture hell bent on beauty
and thinness," Tyler said of the indus
try. "But people can succeed if they
have a sense of self."
Tyler discussed situations in
which the ideals of feminism and
femininity might clash — touching
on everything from bikini waxes to
weight.
"A lot of young women don't want
to own feminism because it feels dog
matic," Tyler said. "You should be able

to be what you want to be."
Tyler said that the feminist move
ment has been beneficial not only for
women, but also for men, giving them
the chance to break out traditional
gender roles.
"People are able to express them
selves as individuals, which is what
feminism is about," she said.
Tyler also said that if individual
empowerment rather than particu
lar ideals were emphasized in the
feminist movement, it would even
benefit women involved in the sex
industry.
"We could make a safer place for
women if we didn't vilify these peo
ple," she said.
Tyler, who recently played a recur
ring character on the hit TV show
"Friends," also applied her individual
istic attitude towards race.
"People ask me if I feel like I broke
some ground — I was the longest-run
ning African-American character on
the show," she said. "I do, but really,
you're just trying to express yourself in
a way that is unique and that is person
al."
She discussed the prevalence of
stereotypical roles for African Ameri
cans in the entertainment industry and
how she dealt with it.
"I think as an African American
woman, I believe that there's no one
way of being black," Tyler said.
"You're all your own experiences as
well as being black."
The audience responded enthusi
astically to Tyler's messages, as well as
her humorous antics.
"It's nice that she's so atypical,
unique and outspoken," said Stan
ford alumna Eangelica Aton. "I find
her really inspirational and impossi
ble to stereotype — she's irreverent,
and that's where she gets her em
powerment."
