## Not quite 'Rich Girls' 
### 
Allow us to introduce ourselves. A match made in heav
en, we were brought together by fate — and the bril
liance of the housing assignment staff — four short
years ago as freshman roommates. At the end of a
whirlwind undergraduate experience, we have reunited in our se
nior years in a last-ditch effort to make a lasting impression on the

Stanford community. Or, at least to
make fun of a lot of people, includ
ing ourselves.
Who are we kidding — we're
hoping that someone will read this
column, recognize some hidden tal
ent and help jumpstart our literary
careers. As two liberal arts majors
approaching graduation in the
spring, we are haunted by our immi
nent unemployment in our sleep.
That is why we were shocked by
repeated requests to donate money

to the Senior Gift, suggesting amounts ranging from $20 to $250.
The Senior Gift is a strange concept. "A long-standing tradition
at Stanford," it asks members of the graduating class to contribute
to The Stanford Fund. The money supports various academic pro
grams that survive primarily on alumni contributions.
We wonder how this tradition came about. It seems sort of lu
dicrous to ask graduating seniors to donate money that they don't
have, especially as we interview in the face of a jobless economic
recovery. There will come a time when we will be happy to send a
fat check to the Stanford Fund, hoping to give future undergrad
uates the same opportunities we enjoyed: Overseas Studies, In
troductory Seminars and a host of student groups.
However, now is not that time. Though the liberal arts career
fair did provide us with some viable career options with the San
Francisco Zoo and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, the point is that nei
ther of us have jobs or salaries lined up for next year, and we know
that many of our classmates fear uncertain futures as well.
At this point, any significant contribution we can make to the
Senior Gift will have to be out of our parents' pockets. Isn't
$40,000 a year enough to ask of them? Certainly, Stanford has
given us much over the years: memories, knowledge, pride, hang
overs. We'd like to think it will continue to give as we grow up,
hopefully in the form of a real-live paying job that enables us to
give back financially to this fine institution. But since the San
Francisco Zoo already has a full staff to hose out the penguin ex
hibit, we'll have to see what happens.
We have to admit, we're astonished at the effort that has gone
into getting seniors to donate money. Costs for stationery, print
ing fees, postage. Senior Gift key chains and class mugs seem to
add up. Also, 37 people are listed as members of the Senior Gift
Participation Committee. The first thing that comes to mind is,
"What do they do?" Is it really necessary to have 37 people on this
committee?
We're not criticizing the actual donation of money. We love
money. We fully plan on having lots of it and being sickeningly
generous with it — but in the future. However, the Senior Gift
is a nice idea, so we've come up with a few alternative ways to
find the means to contribute, for those of us not so financially
secure:
— Request your ASSU refund and donate the $88. That way,
with Dr. Bing's $3 to $ 1 donation matching, your $88 at the ASSU
becomes $352 for the Senior Gift!
— Donate sperm. You've got plenty of extras in there, and an
insignificant loss to you will bring joy to the heart of a woman
dying to have Stanford in her bloodlines. It will also bring $600 to
$900 a month to the Senior Gift.
— Don't puke on the Marguerite on the way to / from P*b
Night. Instead, puke the second you get off the bus and send that
$100 mandatory clean-up fee to the Senior Gift.
Or, we have an even better idea. Why not take "Senior Gift"
to mean, literally, a gift to seniors? As of Jun. 13, we're gonna
need it.

ing fees, postage. Senior Gift key chains and class mugs seem to
add up. Also, 37 people are listed as members of the Senior Gift
Participation Committee. The first thing that comes to mind is,
"What do they do?" Is it really necessary to have 37 people on this
committee?
We're not criticizing the actual donation of money. We love
money. We fully plan on having lots of it and being sickeningly
generous with it — but in the future. However, the Senior Gift
is a nice idea, so we've come up with a few alternative ways to
find the means to contribute, for those of us not so financially
secure:
— Request your ASSU refund and donate the $88. That way,
with Dr. Bing's $3 to $ 1 donation matching, your $88 at the ASSU
becomes $352 for the Senior Gift!
— Donate sperm. You've got plenty of extras in there, and an
insignificant loss to you will bring joy to the heart of a woman
dying to have Stanford in her bloodlines. It will also bring $600 to
$900 a month to the Senior Gift.
— Don't puke on the Marguerite on the way to / from P*b
Night. Instead, puke the second you get off the bus and send that
$100 mandatory clean-up fee to the Senior Gift.
Or, we have an even better idea. Why not take "Senior Gift"
to mean, literally, a gift to seniors? As of Jun. 13, we're gonna
need it.
