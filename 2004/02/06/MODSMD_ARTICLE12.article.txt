## The 						Stanford Daily Students should volunteer 
### 
Editorial

The number of Stanford gradu
ates involved in the Peace
Corps is on the rise: The Uni
versity moved up from tenth to
ninth place in the Peace Corps rankings
for volunteers from medium-sized
campuses this year. There are currently
36 Stanford graduates serving in the
Peace Corps, up from 32 the year be
fore. This shift retlects a general nation
al trend: Universities that have tradi
tionally topped the list saw a 15 percent
increase in the number of alumni vol
unteering, and there are currently 7,553
volunteers serving, the highest level
since 1974. We hope this is a barometer
for an increased interest in community
service and international affairs in gen
eral — both at Stanford and at other
colleges around the country
We encourage Stanford students to
consider opportunities at the Peace
Corps and to also examine other op
tions for international service. The
Peace Corps is a two-year commitment,
and applicants — who must be U.S. cit
izens of at least 18 years of age — are
selected through a multi-stage process.
While the rebounding economy will
promise more lucrative jobs than in
past years, this is a unique way for stu
dents to engage directly in diverse areas
like HIV / AIDS, grassroots education,
public health, environment and techno

logical development, and to gain in
valuable experience through service.
Working with the Peace Corps can also
be a starting point for careers in inter
national relations.
Furthermore, few students are able
to dedicate themselves fully to service
while in college and, practically speak
ing, a two-year hiatus between gradu
ation and work or graduate school is
the perfect time to get involved. In
fact, 83 percent of volunteers have an
undergraduate degree and 1,227 Stan
ford students have enrolled since 1961.
Of course, the Peace Corps is not for
everyone — and it certainly should not
be viewed as the sole way for students to
participate in international develop
ment. Non-governmental organizations
in developing countries can often offer
more flexible and equally enriching vol
unteer experiences without such a rigor
ous application process. Additionally, a
number of nations do not fall under the
purview of the Peace Corps (which has
programs in 75 nations), and it is essen
tial that students take an initiative in
these other countries as well. The Peace
Corps has been actively recruiting stu
dents from campus, which is one of the
reasons why Stanford's ranking has im
proved. Students should, however, con
tinue to proactively find and pursue ser
vice opportunities on their own.
