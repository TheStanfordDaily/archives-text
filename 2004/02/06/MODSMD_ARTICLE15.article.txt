# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Note: Boobies aren't so bad 
### 
My roommates don't
bother watching TV
when I'm dominating
the remote. When
they're present, the only channels
I ever dial in are CNN, FOX News,
MSNBC and CSPAN. It clears the
way for me to do some sponta
neous wandering to the special
channels in the triple digits. Those
digits drive me nuts. But I'm also
actually addicted to the news.
I had high hopes for this week,
especially. After punishing the
country in back-to-back victories
on Super Bowl Sunday and on this
past Tuesday, I was fully expecting
us New Englanders to be praised
like the golden gods that we are.
Isn't it about time for the media to
explicitly state our superiority
once and for all?
But there was nothing. A few
cricket chirps in the place. After
centuries of blood, sweat and tears
— the Battle of Bunker Hill, the
Boston Massacre, the curse of the
Bambino — we have paid our
dues, authored your indepen
dence, spilt good tea and the blood
of the redcoats — and we have
brewed fantastic beer. We have
been on the morally sound side of
every debatable issue including
the current burp in logical pro
gressiveness involving legal mar
riage for everyone. Yet, all our
glory has been whisked away and
forgotten like expired foliage in
autumn. Our triumph has been
outshined by the glaring luster of a
metallic ornament on that solitary,
overexposed half a set: Janet Jack
son's breast.
The media have seen more
journalistic merit in covering
CBS's apology for uncovering a
booby — one of a pair of body
parts attached to the front of every
woman and portly man in this
country — than in mentioning
CBS's blatant hypocrisy and dis
dain for free speech in its ban of
Moveon.org's pro-"anybody but
Bush, please, for the love of hu
manity" advertisement.
The whole fiasco has me fum
ing with sarcasm like a robotronic
Janeane Garofalo pumped with

Diesel and set ablaze.
How dare we allow Janet Jack
son and Justin Timberlake to pol-

lute the public
airwaves! How
dare they con
taminate the
wholesome pro
gramming that
so often flickers
through our tele
vision sets! God
forbid; the little
American chil
dren have to

feast their eyes upon something
that realistically resembles their
most recent lunch. (By "God,"' I'm
referring to the Puritan Christian
God, who seems to have been dis
turbed in His grave of late, armed
with bolts of white lightning to de
liver his regulatory wrath and
blow non-issues clear out of earth
ly proportions.)
At what point in our lives does
a nude breast become visually
hazardous? Isn't it, like, the sec
ond object that we ever lay our in
fant eyes upon? Ironically, the
first visual stimulus is even way,
way more taboo. Hell, I've seen
the monologues twice and I still
can't get myself to spell it out. V-
A-... no shot.
And since when do we call it a
"bare breast" if we don't even get
to see a nipple? If we're going to
have to sit through morality pan
els, disingenuous apologies, ludi
crous explanations and female
newscasters temporarily ordered
to cross their legs during inter
views, then please, show me some
nip. It's only fair.
Janet is now banned from host
ing a segment during the Grammy
Awards; of course, no one will
question the parade of dainty de
signer gowns fashioned out of
Diner's Club cards or salamander
carcasses. Anything goes on the
red carpet — so long as you can't
see the damn nipple!
Apparently, the Super Bowl
has higher standards. Not only can
you not see the nipple, but the
whole lower portion of the boob is
also off viewer limits. This is a pro

gram that aired three sets of not
so-subtle ads offering to remedy
the wettest of noodles — one of
them sporting a vibrant Mike
Ditka alluding to the flaccidness
of baseball and finishing with a
metaphor for prison-banging the
MLB via a well-tossed pigskin
penetrating a tire swing.
All of this is aired on a network
that prides itself on garbage pro
gramming such as the poorly
dubbed reality TV shows that fea
ture test-tube environments en
couraging backstabbing and con
niving— a genre of entertain
ment designed to do nothing but
revive or contrive the careers of
talent-less nobodies such as Nick
Lachey or whoever the new bach
elorette happens to be. Marriage
is so sanctimonious that we can
magically forge them on network
TV via a secret ingredient called
"a million bucks."
We are also privy to the bou
quet of crime dramas that artfully
splash internal organs across the
screen. Gore, guns, murder, sev
ered extremities — all kids' stuff
when compared to a benign quar
ter-second blip of the bottom of a
bare bosom.
I'm beginning to wonder if
American adults have some seri
ous sexuality problems. What has
happened since the "free love"
sixties that caused the sudden re
versal in sexual sanity and cultural
reasonability? What has led to the
sudden frenzy to convert Ameri
can youth to dire abstinence?
1 honestly don't know how to
explain this. I mean, the only tan
gible products of our elders' sexu
al exploits are ...
Urn ... us.
Oh. I get it now.
