# JACK AND JILL, MINUS JACK
## Considering ethics in the workplace 
### 
As a Stanford student,
you're probably pretty
idealistic about your job
prospects. In fact, you're
more likely disillusioned about
having to start working than you
are worried about finding a job that
you enjoy or find worthwhile. I
share your feelings. Although
there are moments of self-doubt, I
generally feel confident that I'll
end up in an occupation I feel pas
sionate about and be fairly content
with. What I learned recently, how
ever, is that the actual manifesta
tion of a "perfect career" can be
surprising — particularly when
you are forced to choose between a
so-called perfect job and your per
sonal ethics.
I encountered this dilemma for
the first time this school year. I took
on an unpaid internship at a local
non-profit, which works toward a
cause I find worthwhile. My co
workers in the office all seem good
hearted, intelligent and hard work
ing— and 1 am certain that they
felt the same idealism that I did
when they started their jobs there.
As I began working in the non
profit world, however, I soon no
ticed its haunting resemblances to
the for-profit world. The main
similarity lies in the need to com
pete for scarce resources. My or
ganization, for example, has to vie
for both its finances and its pa
tronage. To exist, it must win con
tracts for funding from local gov
ernments and, thereafter, meet
quotas of patronage to keep this
funding. If it does not, its con
tracts will be whisked away and
handed to the another non-profit
organization. Thus, while you'd
think there'd be space for every
one to work toward good in the
non-profit sector, the problem is
that money is still scarce. If you
need a salary, you've got to earn it
under the rules of competition

and scarcity.
The result? I watched my much
prized non-profit take advantage of

people's igno
rance in order to
make its yearly
quotas. To be ex
plicit, the organi
zation helps to sue
people for break
ing laws that many
of these lawbreak
ers didn't know
even existed in
the first place. I

couldn't help feeling it was unfair
that people would be punished be
fore they were first educated.
Of course, in order to educate
people about laws, we need
schools that have good civics class
es, and we need everyone to at
tend school and to listen. These
are high standards to have to meet
before a law is enforced. I see the
bind in which my organization
finds itself — and I admit that it
can't afford to educate everyone
before it punishes them if the laws
are to be effective. Nevertheless, I
felt troubled by the situation.
Later, I was asked to lie and
trespass in order to educate peo
ple about the organization's work.
Again, I could understand my or
ganization's point-of-view on this
style of education, given the work
that they do. If you're trying to
fight discrimination, you can't go
up to the potential discriminators
and say, "Hey! Would you give
this information to the people
you're discriminating against?"
But 1 didn't want to do it.
Overall, I found working at my
"ideal job" that I was asked to do
things I felt uncomfortable with.
Though I didn't suddenly start be
lieving that my organization was
inherently flawed, I did feel 1 was
getting an introduction to a com
mon work place reality — that no

matter how worthwhile we find
certain jobs to be, we're going to
be asked to do things that we ethi
cally oppose.
The way I see it, there are sev
eral ways we could attempt to un
ravel this dilemma. On one hand,
we could decide together that the
world functions in a process of
give and take — that for every bit
of good we do. we may have to do
a little harm if we wish to work
within the system at all. Working
in organizations and companies
requires us to work with others,
which means we've got to make
some compromises.
But should you ever compro
mise your personal ethics in such a
process of give and take? Must you
choose one set of ethics over the
other in order to work successfully
with your co-workers? Should you
sacrifice some values to keep your
job because, hey, a gal's got to eat?
I say that it's not worth compro
mising your personal ethics in the
line of duty. After all, isn't it a con
stant compromising of one's per
sonal ethics that makes our world
morally vapid? I'd guess that many
unethical practices in the work
place got started because a few
people with power made the
wrong decisions and these became
standards. So the truth is, things
don't have to be the way they are in
the work world, and the only way
they're going to change is if we
change them. That means doing
the things you know are good and
not doing the things you find
wrong or suspect. We are, after all,
defined by the things we do. I'll bet
that always being the kind of per
son I truly am will take me some
where I'd like to be — much more
than any particular job would.

other in order to work successfully
with your co-workers? Should you
sacrifice some values to keep your
job because, hey, a gal's got to eat?
I say that it's not worth compro
mising your personal ethics in the
line of duty. After all, isn't it a con
stant compromising of one's per
sonal ethics that makes our world
morally vapid? I'd guess that many
unethical practices in the work
place got started because a few
people with power made the
wrong decisions and these became
standards. So the truth is, things
don't have to be the way they are in
the work world, and the only way
they're going to change is if we
change them. That means doing
the things you know are good and
not doing the things you find
wrong or suspect. We are, after all,
defined by the things we do. I'll bet
that always being the kind of per
son I truly am will take me some
where I'd like to be — much more
than any particular job would.

As a Stanford student,
you're probably pretty
idealistic about your job
prospects. In fact, you're
more likely disillusioned about
having to start working than you
are worried about finding a job that
you enjoy or find worthwhile. I
share your feelings. Although
there are moments of self-doubt, I
generally feel confident that I'll
end up in an occupation I feel pas
sionate about and be fairly content
with. What I learned recently, how
ever, is that the actual manifesta
tion of a "perfect career" can be
surprising — particularly when
you are forced to choose between a
so-called perfect job and your per
sonal ethics.
I encountered this dilemma for
the first time this school year. I took
on an unpaid internship at a local
non-profit, which works toward a
cause I find worthwhile. My co
workers in the office all seem good
hearted, intelligent and hard work
ing— and 1 am certain that they
felt the same idealism that I did
when they started their jobs there.
As I began working in the non
profit world, however, I soon no
ticed its haunting resemblances to
the for-profit world. The main
similarity lies in the need to com
pete for scarce resources. My or
ganization, for example, has to vie
for both its finances and its pa
tronage. To exist, it must win con
tracts for funding from local gov
ernments and, thereafter, meet
quotas of patronage to keep this
funding. If it does not, its con
tracts will be whisked away and
handed to the another non-profit
organization. Thus, while you'd
think there'd be space for every
one to work toward good in the
non-profit sector, the problem is
that money is still scarce. If you
need a salary, you've got to earn it
under the rules of competition

and scarcity.
The result? I watched my much
prized non-profit take advantage of

people's igno
rance in order to
make its yearly
quotas. To be ex
plicit, the organi
zation helps to sue
people for break
ing laws that many
of these lawbreak
ers didn't know
even existed in
the first place. I

couldn't help feeling it was unfair
that people would be punished be
fore they were first educated.
Of course, in order to educate
people about laws, we need
schools that have good civics class
es, and we need everyone to at
tend school and to listen. These
are high standards to have to meet
before a law is enforced. I see the
bind in which my organization
finds itself — and I admit that it
can't afford to educate everyone
before it punishes them if the laws
are to be effective. Nevertheless, I
felt troubled by the situation.
Later, I was asked to lie and
trespass in order to educate peo
ple about the organization's work.
Again, I could understand my or
ganization's point-of-view on this
style of education, given the work
that they do. If you're trying to
fight discrimination, you can't go
up to the potential discriminators
and say, "Hey! Would you give
this information to the people
you're discriminating against?"
But 1 didn't want to do it.
Overall, I found working at my
"ideal job" that I was asked to do
things I felt uncomfortable with.
Though I didn't suddenly start be
lieving that my organization was
inherently flawed, I did feel 1 was
getting an introduction to a com
mon work place reality — that no

matter how worthwhile we find
certain jobs to be, we're going to
be asked to do things that we ethi
cally oppose.
The way I see it, there are sev
eral ways we could attempt to un
ravel this dilemma. On one hand,
we could decide together that the
world functions in a process of
give and take — that for every bit
of good we do. we may have to do
a little harm if we wish to work
within the system at all. Working
in organizations and companies
requires us to work with others,
which means we've got to make
some compromises.
But should you ever compro
mise your personal ethics in such a
process of give and take? Must you
choose one set of ethics over the
other in order to work successfully
with your co-workers? Should you
sacrifice some values to keep your
job because, hey, a gal's got to eat?
