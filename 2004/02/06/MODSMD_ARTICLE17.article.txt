## I'm no team player, but is anyone really? 
### 
So I'm in this dance company. It used to
be all fun and games, but now they're
moving up â€” television appearances,
fashion label sponsorship and more gigs
than anyone can deal with. I drag myself to
rehearsal this week instead of midterm re
view, sick as a dog, to use a completely
worthless expression and rehearse for two
and a half hours.
Now there's 30 minutes left and 1 am not
involved in the rest of rehearsal. I can (a)
sit on my ass, fading in and out of delirium
or (b) leave, go home, get some rest. I ex
tend the courtesy of asking permission
from the person in charge, and after sever
al deferred attempts, the answer is no. If I
am too sick to dance, I can watch, but I
can't leave.
Humbling fora girl who's been calling
my own shots since . . . oh, about when I

decided to.
So I think: She's trying
to teach me a lesson.
About perseverance, en
durance. placing the team
before my own needs, all
the key ingredients of
being boring.
And she thinks: I am i
going to teach this girl a
lesson. About persever-'
ance, endurance, and not

being so damn self-centered, all the key in
gredients of a successful team.
And I think: The hell if I'm going to
learn a lesson from someone trying to teach
me a lesson. Let's see. While I sit here, what
can 1 teach myself instead?
Either 1 am a prima donna who has au
thority issues or I'm not cut out for this pas
sive-obedient bullshit.
It struck a chord. A follow-your-own
drumbeat, femi-chord, if you will. Even if
staying around sick and pathetic did some
how contribute to team unity, or at least ad
hered to a code of professionalism, I still
couldn't get over the whole "sitting here
aimlessly" part of it.
I stayed 'til the end of rehearsal, by
the way. People who look out for their
own interests also know when it's in
their interests to let someone think
they're teaching you a lesson every once
in a while.
Go ahead, say it. You have to learn to
follow orders and be a team player if you're
ever going to be successful in life. You can't
just start out on top. Besides, selfish people
aren't very nice.
Where did this rhetoric even come
from? Back-up dancers? Yet we're sur
rounded by it. Let's leave my semi-interest
ing anecdote and generalize.
I can understand loving the sport. And I
can understand wanting your team to do its
best, because then you advance to playoffs
and everyone is happier and it's great play
ing with excellent athletes. And 1 can even
understand loving your teammates. But I
cannot wrap my (inflated) head around the
idea of putting the team before yourself,
i.e. being committed and loyal to this
rather arbitrary assignment, just for the
fun of it.
Maybe it's a moot point because I have
never met a "team player" in this ex
treme, odd sense of the word. I say they
don't exist.
Professional basketball players, for ex
ample, switch teams all the time, and no
one accuses them of being disloyal, un
grateful team-haters. Teams switch cities,
owners switch management, players switch
paychecks, Lakers switch to those horrible
blue and white jerseys and at halftime, ev
eryone switches sides. Undying loyalty is
not a reality.
Not even the cheerleaders care about
who's on what team, as long as there's
an audience.
About the only people who aren't
switching it up are the diehard fans. Fans
really care about the team, and they're not
even on it, and no one particularly cares if
they care, except to the extent that they're
buying paraphernalia and tickets and
Raiderettes calendars.
Team sports are made up of athletes,
athletes are looking to play their best
game, and the best athletes emerge
from the anonymous pool of teamwork
and claim their own spotlights. The rest
of the (anonymous) athletes "play for
the team."
Daring overgeneralization, 1 know.
Of course, we can't talk about team loy
alty without mentioning the touching ex
pression, "Take one for the team." Here, a
guy acts in complete deference to his
buddy's best interests, feigning interest and
/or hooking up with the ugly girl so his
friend can score with the cute girl. Girls
don't do this. Primates don't do this. Per
haps we have found the lone example of a
pure team player in all his persevering, self
sacrificing glory.
Don't ask me to stay around for this one.

Julie is a senior, can 7 you tell? You can e
mail her at julieoloQPstanford.edu. Just
don't ask her to play intramurals with you.
