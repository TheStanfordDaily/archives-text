# Card remains perfect
## Stanford overcomes injury troubles to top ASU 81-51 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a game that very well could have exposed
the Cardinal's newfound lack of depth in the
frontcourt, No. 2 Stanford (19-0, 10-0 Pacific-10
Conference) didn't seem all that vulnerable in
the post.
With both senior forward Justin Davis and
sophomore forward Matt Haryasz sitting on the
sidelines in matching khakis and crutches, ju
nior center Rob Little proved to be the differ
ence maker down low against Arizona State for
ward Ike Diogu, as he led the Cardinal to a sur
prisingly easy 81-51 victory over ASU.
Stanford's low-post debacle and Diogu's
down-low prominence had all the possibilities
for great intrigue. Would the Cardinal respond
to having two of its most explosive big men out
of the lineup? And, in particular, how would
Little respond in the wake of a sub-par perfor
mance at Oregon last Saturday, when he com
mitted four fouls in five minutes of play?
Those questions were answered quickly dur
ing a five-minute stretch toward the end of the
first half, as Little scored 10 points, converting
on hook shot after hook shot, the last of which
came at the three-minute mark and extended
the Cardinal lead to 20 points, 34-14.
The Cardinal shot 51.6 percent from the field
in the first half and went 2-for-3 from behind the
3-point arc en route to a 43-22 half time lead.
And unlike the previous barn-burner down
in Tempe — when it took a last-minute Josh
Childress tip-in to give Stanford the victory —
the Sun Devils (8-11, 2-8) didn't seriously chal
lenge the Cardinal after that point.
Little had 13 first half points on 6-of-8 shoot
ing from the field. He finished with 17 points
and six rebounds.
"We couldn't afford to let down," Little said.
"We didn't have as many players."
"Losing two guys, I think the kids really
bought into the idea of being very aggressive,"

Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said. "I
think it focuses you."
Senior guard Matt Lottich certainly looked
refocused — or at least his shot did. Despite
struggling lately on the offensive end. Lottich
seemed to rediscover his shooting touch, scoring
11 points off 4-of-5 shooting from the field.
With both Lottich and Little performing
well on the offensive end and the Sun Devils
struggling to find the bottom of the net (Ari
zona State shot a dismal 31 percent from the
field in the first half and 32 percent for the
game), the Cardinal looked in top form as it
hustled for loose balls and converted off
turnovers.
And, in reality, it was a group of reserves that
extended Stanford's lead in the first half. For the
opening 10 minutes, Arizona State seemed to
hang with Stanford's starters. It wasn't until
Cardinal reserves senior forward Joe Kirchofer,
freshman forward Fred Washington and sopho
more point guard Jason Haas joined Lottich and
Little on the court that Stanford really began to
pull away.
During a timeout. Montgomery moved the
five players into a zone defense that limited
Arizona State's offensive productivity. Lot
tich scored seven unanswered points and
Washington made a steal, which led to a Little
put-back, extending Stanford's lead to 24-10.
Two minutes later, the Cardinal found itself up
by 20 points with almost three minutes re
maining before the half.
"Our bench was great. Our bench was
fantastic," Montgomery said. "Haas came in
and did a good job and I thought [Kirchoferj
was huge."
Haas finished with seven points, including
four free throws and a three-pointer with just
under two minutes left in the game.
Childress added 11 points, eight boards and
four assists, and sophomore guard Dan Grun-
