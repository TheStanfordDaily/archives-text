# Cardinal defense succeeds in burning Sun Devils

It was Roh Little using perfect footwork and wiping
sweat from his brow as he worked to keep the ball from
Ike Diogu. It was Fred Washington bouncing from the
wing to the corner like a ping-pong ball to deny two Ari

It was Jason Haas barking "Let's go!" as he challenged
the man he was guarding; Joe Kirchofer practically diving
at a Sun Devil shooter to interrupt his shot; and Chris
Hernandez flicking a hand out to come up with a steal.

tween Diogu and the ball, the smooth lay-ins and baby
hooks he sank on offense were like little treats fora job
well done. His 17 points led the team.
Diogu, who averages 22.6 points per game, scored just
14 and turned the ball over five times as forward Nick
Robinson and other Stanford players double-teamed him
