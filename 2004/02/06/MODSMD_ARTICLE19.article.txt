# Cardinal defense succeeds in burning Sun Devils
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It was Roh Little using perfect footwork and wiping
sweat from his brow as he worked to keep the ball from
Ike Diogu. It was Fred Washington bouncing from the
wing to the corner like a ping-pong ball to deny two Ari
zona State players the open outside shot.
It was Jason Haas barking "Let's go!" as he challenged
the man he was guarding; Joe Kirchofer practically diving
at a Sun Devil shooter to interrupt his shot; and Chris
Hernandez flicking a hand out to come up with a steal.
It was Stanford's defense that won this game â€” like so
many other games this season.

"I thought defensively we were very good," head
coach Mike Montgomery said. "We expended some ener
gy, and guys were tired, but it was a good tired. They were
tired because they were working hard on defense to not
give anything up."
The Cardinal gave up just 51 points, Arizona State's
lowest point total of the season. The Sun Devils made
only 32 percent of their shots and committed 15 turnovers.
Those misses and miscues translated into energy for
Stanford on the offensive end.
"I get really pumped up on the defensive end," Little
said in practice earlier this week, answering a question
about what it takes for the team to get going offensively.
"I personally think it's going to start with us on defense.

getting stops and turning the pace in our favor."
Little was right. He blanketed Arizona State's star big
man. Diogu, on every defensive possession, then out-hus
tled him down the floor and scored on him. After 20 sec
onds of dancing, turning, shoving and bumping to stay be
tween Diogu and the ball, the smooth lay-ins and baby
hooks he sank on offense were like little treats fora job
well done. His 17 points led the team.
Diogu, who averages 22.6 points per game, scored just
14 and turned the ball over five times as forward Nick
Robinson and other Stanford players double-teamed him
and swatted at the ball.
A testament to the rest of the
Cardinal defense: Diogu did not
dish out a single assist.
"He was getting frustrated be
cause everywhere he turned there
were two defenders there," Little
said. "Nick was doing a good job of
doubling down, and I think we got
in his head a little bit."
Stanford alternated between
zone and man-to-man defense
throughout the game, and it didn't
seem to matter much. Arizona
State couldn't solve either one.
Sun Devil head coach Rob
Evans said after the game that his
team had not been beaten by any
tricks or stratagems, but by plain
hard work.
"Stanford, they haven't changed
anything in 15 years," Evans said.
"They do the same thing. They play
hard, they play smart, they execute.
They do all the things that winning
teams do."
Arizona State's guards strug
gled the most with Stanford's de
fense. Stevie Moore shot 2-of-10
and Tron Smith l-of-7, largely be

cause they had Cardinal fingertips
in front of their faces almost every
time they released the ball.
No Stanford player gave a weak
effort on defense, but some of the
strongest clearly came from some
of the team's little-used substitutes.
Washington and Haas, with
fresh legs, zoomed around the
court as though they were running
defensive drills in tryouts. Playing
with his typical abandon, senior
Joe Kirchofer made fans forget
that the Cardinal was missing in
jured forwards Justin Davis and
Matt Haryasz.
"Joe did a great job. working
hard on Diogu and going for loose
balls," Montgomery said.
Even at the end of the game,
with the contest far out of reach,
Stanford's players were sweating,
hustling and diving on the floor. A
30-point second-half lead might
seem like a scenario in which play
ers should be having fun instead of
working their butts off, but for this
year's Stanford squad, the two go
hand-in-hand.
"I think it's a big part of the
team's psyche," Kirchofer said
when asked whether he takes pride
in diving for loose balls. "I think we
want everybody on our team to
make that play, and I think pretty
much everybody would."
