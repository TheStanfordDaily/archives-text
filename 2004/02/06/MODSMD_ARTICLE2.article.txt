### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Association for In
ternational Development (SAID)
and the Future Social Innovators
Network (FUSION) have teamed up
for the first time to bring the third an
nual Stanford International Devel
opment Conference to campus on
Saturday, Feb. 7.
The organizers said they hope that
the conference, which is entitled
"Collaboration in International De
velopment: Putting Business in the
Picture," will show students that
through collaboration, businesses
and developing communities can
both thrive.
"The whole idea of social entre
preneurship and using business for
social good is emerging and really
popular now," said SAID President
Karen Wang, a senior. "Most inter
national development issues are
complicated — that's why it's critical
to collaborate."
She added, "It's important to rec
ognize that we can't exclude business
es from international development."
While the conference is targeted
towards undergraduates, it has also
been publicized throughout the Bay
Area. FUSION President Erin
Krampetz, a senior, said she hopes the
conference will spark conversation
between undergraduates, graduate
students and local business leaders.
The four-hour event starts at 1 p.m.
in the Graduate School of Business'
Bishop Auditorium. Admission is free
due support from the ASSU Speak
er's Bureau, Global Management
Program and Social Venture Club.
"We're going to see how business
is being incorporated into internation
al development and how can we do
this in a positive way," Krampetz said.
"Often business has been associated
with a negative for profit [image]."
Keynote speaker Debra Dunn,

senior vice president of corporate af
fairs and global citizenship at Hewlett
Packard, will discuss her company's
programs, such as global villages that
provide developing countries tech
nologies to bridge the digital divide.
Her talk will include discussions of so
cial and environmental responsibility
and corporate philanthropy.
"She's a high-energy, charismatic
speaker," Krampetz said. "She was
just highlighted in a magazine as one
of the social capitalists of the year."
Attendees will also participate in a
panel discussion designed to reveal a
kaleidoscope of perspectives from so
cial entrepreneurship to academia.
Donavan Cook from Save the Chil
dren will moderate the four speakers:
Lee Davis, co-founder and CEO of
NESsT; Michael MacHarg, director
of development and partnerships at
One World Health Institute; Shari
Berenbach, CEO of the Calvert
Foundation; and Dr. Nicholas Hope,
research fellow at Stanford's Institute
for Economic Policy Research and
former Asia director at World Bank.
"It's a great opportunity for stu
dents from different departments and
different age groups to learn from
each other and learn about new ideas
from people working on international
development issues," Wang said.
The program will conclude with
student-led breakout sessions on top
ics like research abroad or internation
al volunteer work. An internship fair
will highlight local companies with
goals exemplified by the conference.
"Students built this conference for
students," Krampetz said. "Students
are going to show what they've done
— that's it's possible for us to really
go out and make a positive difference
in international development."
She added, "We have over 20 or
ganizations from the Bay Area that
are going to be here with volunteer,
internship and job opportunities, so
it's like a one-stop shop."
