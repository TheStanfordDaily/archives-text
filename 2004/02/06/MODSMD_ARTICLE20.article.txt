# Women upset by Arizona in Tuscon
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
TUCSON, Ariz. — After a humiliating 84-62
loss to the Stanford women's basketball team in
January (17-4, 9-2 Pacific-10 Conference), Ari
zona won seven straight games. Last week, the
Wildcats lost to Arizona State and, unfortunately
for the Cardinal, the Wildcats once again dis
played their resiliency, upsetting the Cardinal 88-
83 last night.
The obvious difference between the two
matchups was an extremely skilled and surpris
ingly quick 6-foot-5 sophomore center, Shawn
tinice Polk.
When the two teams met last month. Polk was
held to just six points and as many turnovers. Polk
was certainly not going to let this happen again.
She was essentially unstoppable, pouring in 21
points on 9-of-15 shooting, and that was just the be
ginning. Polk pulled down a career-high 19 re
bounds, nine of them offensive.
"We made it easy for her," said senior forward
Nicole Powell. "We let them do exactly what they
wanted to do."
The absence of the Cardinal's own 6-foot-5
center, freshman Kristen Newlin, who was out
with a hone bruise to her knee, was more than
noticeable.
"We really missed Kristen," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer. "The complimentary play
ers really opened things up for Polkie. Dee-Dee
Wheeler is a great point guard, but [Polk| is the dif
ference maker."
The "complimentary players" certainly did step
things up a notch for Polk and the Wildcats. Arizona
had four other players in double figures — Wheeler
(19 points), Natalie Jones (17), Aimee Gryzb (13)
and Shannon Hobson (10).
In addition to allowing the Wildcats a 19-11 edge
on the offensive glass, the Cardinal turned the ball
over 16 times, compared to just eight for Arizona.
And while the Cardinal outshot the Wildcats 47 per

cent to 43 percent, Arizona attempted 68 shots to
just 57 for Stanford.
Stanford trailed by as many as eight points in
the first half, hut went on a 6-0 run to close it out
to get within two at the half, as junior guard Susan
Borchardt hit a running, one-handed, over-the
shoulder circus shot with eight seconds to go.
Arizona, however, had all the answers when the
second half opened. The Wildcats took advantage of
three straight Cardinal turnovers to build a nine
point lead. After two more turnovers and two more
Cardinal fouls, Arizona took its biggest lead of the
night at 13.
When Polk left the game fora brief rest, the Car
dinal took advantage and went on a 24-11 run in the
next 8:10 to tie the game at 62.
Powell — who attempted just two field goals and
two free throws in the first and missed all four of
those shots — fueled the run, scoring nine points in
that span.
Despite being held scoreless in the first half while
pulling down just three rebounds, the Arizona na
tive finished with 22 points and 10 boards for yet an
other double-double.
While VanDerveer attributed Powell's subpar
first half to pressure Powell put on herself to have a
great game in her hometown, Powell wholehearted
ly disagreed.
"1 just don't think we came out and executed,"
she said. "I don't know if the word is complacency,
but we just didn't bring it."
The Cardinal's "complacency" is especially dis
appointing after it played some this season's best
basketball in wins over Washington and Washing
ton State last WvOKend.
Stanford's ball movement and scoring distribu
tion had improved immensely from earlier
matchups, but the Cardinal again had trouble creat
ing shots last night.
Stanford has another tough matchup on Satur
day, as it will face off with fourth-place Arizona
State. After last night's loss, every game has become
a must-win.
