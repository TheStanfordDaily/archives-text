# Baseball heads to Fresno State for first away series of year
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Only four college baseball teams managed to beat Rice, the eventual
NCAA champion, two times during the 2003 season. Stanford's weekend op
ponent, Fresno State, is one of those squads.
The Bulldogs linished last year — head coach Mike Batesole's first
with the club — with a near-even 30-29 record and wins over several post
season-bound teams, which means that the Cardinal's first away series of
the year won't be easy.
Stanford (3-0) is hoping to translate the momentum of its season
opening sweep over Cal State Fullerton last weekend into an advan
tage over the Bulldogs (0-0).
Cardinal head coach Mark Marquess said that one of the challenges of
lacing Fresno State is the fact that it has a high number of newcomers to the
team — many of whom are not freshmen.
"They bring in a lot of [ junior college] guys," Marquess said. "It's a
little bit more difficult because we don't know what to expect, since we
haven't seen them play before. And they have the advantage of three
players that transferred from other four-year programs, [including! a
pitcher out of USC."
Stanford poses quite a challenge of its own, as Fresno State will face a start
ing rotation that worked well against Cal Fullerton. Marquess has slated the
same three pitchers for the Fresno series — sophomore lefty Mark Ro
manczuk will start Friday night, sophomore right-hander Matt Manship will
take the mound on Saturday afternoon and junior righty Mark Jecman will
finish out the series on Sunday.
Romanczuk grabbed his first win of the season last weekend, though Mar
quess said that the southpaw is capable of pitching much better than he did.
Jecman made the longest appearance of his career last Sunday and threw ex
tremely well, securing himself another start.
Manship struggled in his 2 2 / 3 innings last week, but Marquess is of the
opinion that he is ready to go this Saturday.
"There are a lot of things that I did not do correctly," Manship said of his

start last Saturday. "The good thing is that I knew what I was doing wrong,
and once you have identification, you can go from there. I'm ready to charge
ahead, 100 percent."
Fhe Cardinal benefited from remarkably solid relief pitching in the Fuller
ton series, and Marquess noted that sophomore Jeff Gilmore and senior
David O'Flagan will likely come out of the bullpen for Stanford in Fresno.
The Bulldogs are expected to pit senior lefty David Griffin — who
posted a 2-1 record with a 3.30 ERA last year — against Stanford on Fri
day night. Fresno State's Saturday starter will be sophomore Matt Garza,
who ended 2003 with a 1-6 record and a 9.55 ERA. The third starter has
yet to be determined.
Though the Cardinal — which swept Fresno State last season —
has not faced either of the slated hurlers, senior Jonny Ash doesn't ex
pect it to be a problem.
"We'll just show up and use the same philosophy. No matter who's out there,
just see the ball, hit the ball," Ash said. "The biggest factor [that helped us against
Fullerton | is that we never gave up. We were down a couple times over the
weekend and continued to play good defease and get timely hits. Hopefully that
will roll over into this weekend."
Stanford's lineup will likely remain much like it was last weekend, with
minor changes depending on the opposing pitcher.
"If I face a lefty, I play [sophomore Chns Lewis] at second and [sopho
more Jed Lowrie] at short," Marquess said. "With a righty it's [freshman
Adam Sorgi] at short and Lowrie at second."
Last weekend's series showcased a Cardinal lineup that was not hitting at
the height of its potential, according to Marquess, as the squad was out-hit
during two out of the three games.
But the players contend that they are more than prepared to improve this
weekend at Fresno State.
"Coach Marquess does a very good job of getting us ready for every game,
so I don't think that we're worried at all," Manship said. "We're just excited
that we're playing well and looking forward to continuing that."
The Cardinal faces off against the Bulldogs at Beiden Field on Friday at
6:30 p.m., then at 1:05 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
