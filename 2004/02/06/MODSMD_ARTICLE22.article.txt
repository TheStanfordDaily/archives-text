# Students to parade hybrids
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford students and communi
ty members will parade an assembly
of hybrid cars through Palo Alto this
Saturday . The demonstration will be
part of the Bluewater Network's
Global Warming Campaign to show
Ford Motor Company that con
sumers prefer automobiles that slow
global warming.
The campaign is focusing on the
fact that Ford CEO Bill Ford, Jr. did
not follow through on his pledge to
boost Ford SUVs' mileage by 25
percent. Instead, he has lobbied
Congress against increasing fuel
mileage standards.

"1 am participating because 1 be
lieve that grassroots, high-profile
activism can make a difference in
our media-drenched world, and I
believe that this is one of the most
important issues that is going to af
fect me throughout my adult life,"
said sophomore Justy Burdick,
president of the Stanford Greens.
"Also, 1 think it is unfair to push the
social cost of large, inefficient cars
— high accident casualty rates,
high gasoline prices, smoggy air —
on to society."
Participants will be driving at
least 12 decorated hybrid cars
through Palo Alto to a local Ford
Dealership, where they will present
the owner with both a cake saying

"clean cars are a piece of cake" and
a letter of demands.
The parade, which starts at The
Oval at noon, will feature speakers
including Burdick, Palo Alto Vice
Mayor Jim Burch and Jason Mark,
a clean car campaigner from Glob
al Exchange.
"Global warming is mostly about
the environment, but also about
human rights, politics and econom
ics," said Rachel Harold, one of the
organizers from the Bluewater Net
work, an environmental activism
and lobbying group "We have
things to throw out the window to
people with information about the
cars, so we'd love to have as many as
people as possible."
