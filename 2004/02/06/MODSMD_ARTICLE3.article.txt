# Students battle rising book costs

### LESLIE COHEN 
Professors and legislators are
rallying to fight the rising price of
textbooks in an effort to help stu
dents who are typically forced to
purchase the pricey textbooks
publishers offer.
The California Public Interest
Research Group (CALPIRG) re
cently released a new report ex
posing many of the practices that
publishers use to hike up the cost
of textbooks.
The report said students will
spend an average of $898 per year
on textbooks in the 2003-2004 acad
emic year. The report also said over
59 percent of students who
searched fora used book for the fall
quarter / semester of 2003 were un

able to find even one used book for
their classes and were forced to pay
an average of $102.44 fora new
book, versus an average of $64.80
fora used book.
"It's terrible that publishers are
making it tougher to purchase the
books we need, creating a barrier for
what is one of the most important
parts of our academic experience,"
said sophomore Barry Bunny.
According to CALPIRG, a
major contribution to the high
prices of textbooks is that publish
ers add "bells and whistles" — ad
ditional instructional materials
such as CD-ROMS and workbooks
that students rarely use — that
drive prices up.
The report also claimed that the
high cost of books is due primarily to

publishers producing new editions
like clockwork, regardless of how
much new educational content ex
ists. Publishers keep textbook edi
tions on the shelf for an average of
only 3.5 years before updating them.
At Stanford, many professors
have recognized the problem that
students face and are becoming
more price conscious.
"Publishing company represen
tatives frequently visit my office to
promote new texts," said Econom
ics Prof. Mark Tendall. "These
representatives provide useful in
formation about books and sup
plementary materials, but they are
often surprised when I ask for pric
ing information — they seem to
assume that I would not consider
