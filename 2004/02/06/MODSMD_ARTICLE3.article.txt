# Students battle rising book costs
## 
### LESLIE COHEN 
Professors and legislators are
rallying to fight the rising price of
textbooks in an effort to help stu
dents who are typically forced to
purchase the pricey textbooks
publishers offer.
The California Public Interest
Research Group (CALPIRG) re
cently released a new report ex
posing many of the practices that
publishers use to hike up the cost
of textbooks.
The report said students will
spend an average of $898 per year
on textbooks in the 2003-2004 acad
emic year. The report also said over
59 percent of students who
searched fora used book for the fall
quarter / semester of 2003 were un

able to find even one used book for
their classes and were forced to pay
an average of $102.44 fora new
book, versus an average of $64.80
fora used book.
"It's terrible that publishers are
making it tougher to purchase the
books we need, creating a barrier for
what is one of the most important
parts of our academic experience,"
said sophomore Barry Bunny.
According to CALPIRG, a
major contribution to the high
prices of textbooks is that publish
ers add "bells and whistles" — ad
ditional instructional materials
such as CD-ROMS and workbooks
that students rarely use — that
drive prices up.
The report also claimed that the
high cost of books is due primarily to

publishers producing new editions
like clockwork, regardless of how
much new educational content ex
ists. Publishers keep textbook edi
tions on the shelf for an average of
only 3.5 years before updating them.
At Stanford, many professors
have recognized the problem that
students face and are becoming
more price conscious.
"Publishing company represen
tatives frequently visit my office to
promote new texts," said Econom
ics Prof. Mark Tendall. "These
representatives provide useful in
formation about books and sup
plementary materials, but they are
often surprised when I ask for pric
ing information — they seem to
assume that I would not consider
price in deciding whether to adopt
a text."
The price war has finally
reached state governments. U.S.
Congressman David Wu and Sena
tor Charles Schumer have each in
troduced legislation to address
these issues.
"Price gouging in any form is
unacceptable, but it is particularly
outrageous when it cheats stu
dents," Wu said in a statement re
leased in January.
Carol Liu, the Chair of the Cali
fornia Assembly Higher Education
Subcommittee, said she plans to in
troduce legislation of her own.
"College costs are on the rise,"
Liu said in a statement released
in January. "Students face increas
ing fees and tuition, decreasing
availability of financial aid and ris
ing costs of textbooks — my legisla
tion will encourage publishers to
provide "unbundled' materials, re
quire explanations of changes made
in new editions and ask that faculty
consider price when making text
book selection decisions."
On campus, the ASSU has
launched its own book service
independent of the Stanford
Bookstore.
"The ASSU book service
launched this year was designed to

give students a cheaper alternative
to the used books offered otherwise
on campus," said ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, a senior. "The ser
vice was very successful in that it
drove down the prices of used books
at the bookstore."
ASSU Vice President Joey Na
toli, a junior, is in charge of this book
service. He said that last year's stu
dent-body survey prompted the
ASSU to address the textbook
problem more closely.
"Last year we did a survey of the
student body — the number one
issue was cost of living," Natoli said.
"Students spend approximately
$1,300 on books a year — that is a
tremendous sum.
Natoli described the new book
service as an attempt "to bring real
market prices to campus by offer
ing an alternative book seller. The
end goal will be to unite students
who have books with those stu
dents who want books to create a
perfectly efficient marketplace
void of profit margin. By ridding a
marketplace of profit margin, stu
dents can trade books at their true
value as opposed to a higher value
available elsewhere."
Some professors also put text
book material on reserve at one of
the Stanford libraries.
In addition, students have
found even more venues to deal
with high prices. Web sites like
Amazon.com, Ebay.com. SUmar
ket. and CALPIRG's www.cam
pusbookswap.com have become
popular outlets to find used and
cheaper texts.

Professors and legislators are
rallying to fight the rising price of
textbooks in an effort to help stu
dents who are typically forced to
purchase the pricey textbooks
publishers offer.
The California Public Interest
Research Group (CALPIRG) re
cently released a new report ex
posing many of the practices that
publishers use to hike up the cost
of textbooks.
The report said students will
spend an average of $898 per year
on textbooks in the 2003-2004 acad
emic year. The report also said over
59 percent of students who
searched fora used book for the fall
quarter / semester of 2003 were un

able to find even one used book for
their classes and were forced to pay
an average of $102.44 fora new
book, versus an average of $64.80
fora used book.
"It's terrible that publishers are
making it tougher to purchase the
books we need, creating a barrier for
what is one of the most important
parts of our academic experience,"
said sophomore Barry Bunny.
According to CALPIRG, a
major contribution to the high
prices of textbooks is that publish
ers add "bells and whistles" — ad
ditional instructional materials
such as CD-ROMS and workbooks
that students rarely use — that
drive prices up.
The report also claimed that the
high cost of books is due primarily to

publishers producing new editions
like clockwork, regardless of how
much new educational content ex
ists. Publishers keep textbook edi
tions on the shelf for an average of
only 3.5 years before updating them.
At Stanford, many professors
have recognized the problem that
students face and are becoming
more price conscious.
"Publishing company represen
tatives frequently visit my office to
promote new texts," said Econom
ics Prof. Mark Tendall. "These
representatives provide useful in
formation about books and sup
plementary materials, but they are
often surprised when I ask for pric
ing information — they seem to
assume that I would not consider
price in deciding whether to adopt
a text."
The price war has finally
reached state governments. U.S.
Congressman David Wu and Sena
tor Charles Schumer have each in
troduced legislation to address
these issues.
"Price gouging in any form is
unacceptable, but it is particularly
outrageous when it cheats stu
dents," Wu said in a statement re
leased in January.
Carol Liu, the Chair of the Cali
fornia Assembly Higher Education
Subcommittee, said she plans to in
troduce legislation of her own.
"College costs are on the rise,"
Liu said in a statement released
in January. "Students face increas
ing fees and tuition, decreasing
availability of financial aid and ris
ing costs of textbooks — my legisla
tion will encourage publishers to
provide "unbundled' materials, re
quire explanations of changes made
in new editions and ask that faculty
consider price when making text
book selection decisions."
On campus, the ASSU has
launched its own book service
independent of the Stanford
Bookstore.
"The ASSU book service
launched this year was designed to

give students a cheaper alternative
to the used books offered otherwise
on campus," said ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, a senior. "The ser
vice was very successful in that it
drove down the prices of used books
at the bookstore."
ASSU Vice President Joey Na
toli, a junior, is in charge of this book
service. He said that last year's stu
dent-body survey prompted the
ASSU to address the textbook
problem more closely.
"Last year we did a survey of the
student body — the number one
issue was cost of living," Natoli said.
"Students spend approximately
$1,300 on books a year — that is a
tremendous sum.
Natoli described the new book
service as an attempt "to bring real
market prices to campus by offer
ing an alternative book seller. The
end goal will be to unite students
who have books with those stu
dents who want books to create a
perfectly efficient marketplace
void of profit margin. By ridding a
marketplace of profit margin, stu
dents can trade books at their true
value as opposed to a higher value
available elsewhere."
Some professors also put text
book material on reserve at one of
the Stanford libraries.
In addition, students have
found even more venues to deal
with high prices. Web sites like
Amazon.com, Ebay.com. SUmar
ket. and CALPIRG's www.cam
pusbookswap.com have become
popular outlets to find used and
cheaper texts.
