# Fac Sen discusses journal fees
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
A "serials crisis" consumed
the Faculty Senate yesterday af
ternoon as senate members de
bated a set of recommendations
dealing with the high and rapidly
increasing subscription costs for
academic journals.
With journal subscription costs
having risen as much as 50 percent
in the past five years and set to rise
another 12 percent this year, the
Committee on Libraries recom
mended in a report that the senate
set guidelines aimed at reducing
the University's reliance on the
most expensive journals.
"The cost of journals has crip
pled University budgets," said
Biochemistry Prof. Doug Brutlag,
who presented the report.
After more than an hour of dis
cussion, the motion was put off for
debate at another session.

The motion would follow simi
lar actions at Duke University,
Cornell University, Harvard Uni
versity and the University of Cal
ifornia in response to journal
publisher Elsevier's practices of
raising prices and bundling sub
scriptions of small journals with
important journals.
Other universities have refused
to extend their contracts with the
company, which publishes as many
as one-fourth of the frequently
used journals in the sciences.
In comparison, a motion en
couraging libraries to reexamine
their journal subscriptions would
be a mild reaction, though Univer
sity Librarian Michael Keller
noted that Elsevier's contracts
with Stanford are not unfavorable.
"This is a real grassroots ef
fort," said Biological Sciences
Prof. Robert Simoni. "There is a
growing list of universities that
have spoken publicly."

ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a senior, said that expen
sive journal articles harm more
than just University bottom lines.
"This is a huge cost-of-living
issue," she said.
Figueroa emphasized that jour
nal articles published in course
readers, even those by the profes
sors of the course, can become un
reasonably expensive.
Keller shared that sentiment,
pointing out that for-profit pub
lishers have been known to tar
get articles that are in course
packets, increasing costs from
$15 up to $60 when they deter
mine that a journal article is in a
course reader.
The proposed resolution
would have said, among its four
points, "Libraries are encouraged
to systematically drop journals
