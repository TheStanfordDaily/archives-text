# Fac Sen discusses journal fees
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
A "serials crisis" consumed
the Faculty Senate yesterday af
ternoon as senate members de
bated a set of recommendations
dealing with the high and rapidly
increasing subscription costs for
academic journals.
With journal subscription costs
having risen as much as 50 percent
in the past five years and set to rise
another 12 percent this year, the
Committee on Libraries recom
mended in a report that the senate
set guidelines aimed at reducing
the University's reliance on the
most expensive journals.
"The cost of journals has crip
pled University budgets," said
Biochemistry Prof. Doug Brutlag,
who presented the report.
After more than an hour of dis
cussion, the motion was put off for
debate at another session.

The motion would follow simi
lar actions at Duke University,
Cornell University, Harvard Uni
versity and the University of Cal
ifornia in response to journal
publisher Elsevier's practices of
raising prices and bundling sub
scriptions of small journals with
important journals.
Other universities have refused
to extend their contracts with the
company, which publishes as many
as one-fourth of the frequently
used journals in the sciences.
In comparison, a motion en
couraging libraries to reexamine
their journal subscriptions would
be a mild reaction, though Univer
sity Librarian Michael Keller
noted that Elsevier's contracts
with Stanford are not unfavorable.
"This is a real grassroots ef
fort," said Biological Sciences
Prof. Robert Simoni. "There is a
growing list of universities that
have spoken publicly."

ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a senior, said that expen
sive journal articles harm more
than just University bottom lines.
"This is a huge cost-of-living
issue," she said.
Figueroa emphasized that jour
nal articles published in course
readers, even those by the profes
sors of the course, can become un
reasonably expensive.
Keller shared that sentiment,
pointing out that for-profit pub
lishers have been known to tar
get articles that are in course
packets, increasing costs from
$15 up to $60 when they deter
mine that a journal article is in a
course reader.
The proposed resolution
would have said, among its four
points, "Libraries are encouraged
to systematically drop journals
that are unconscionably or dispro
portionately expensive or infla
tionary. Special attention should
be paid to Elsevier."
It would also have encouraged
faculty to withhold articles from ex
ploitative journals.
The discussion also addressed
the conflict junior faculty could
face between publishing in presti
gious journals and at the same
time avoiding expensive journals.
Many senate members said that
tenure decisions should be unaf
fected by the journals in which a
professor has published.
Others described how periodical
prestige would inevitably find its
way into the tenure process.
"Stanford's process does look at
the reputation a person has
achieved in his or her field,"
Etchemendy said. "In some fields it
is impossible to have work well
known in the field if not published
in certain journals."
Discussion then diverged into
a legal question of whether the
senate might open the University
up to lawsuits by targeting one
company. Some members were
concerned, but others insisted
that it was important to highlight
one company.
"I would love for Elsevier to sue
us," Keller said to widespread
laughter.
Joss asked whether the bad rep
utation of this journal company

was affecting its bottom line and
whether the top levels of manage
ment were concerned.
Keller noted, however, that he
received six calls from stock ana
lysts in the past month and had to
tell them that for every university
like Stanford there are hundreds of
libraries that have "jumped on the
escalator" and accepted Elsevier's
negotiating tactics, thinking they
received good deals.
Some universities, though,
have taken hard lines against the
company, canceling contracts and
inviting press coverage. The Uni
versity of California lacked elec
tronic access to Elsevier's jour
nals for six months while negotia
tions were taking place, according
to Brutlag. In the end, the compa
ny's journals cost the University
of California half its journal bud
get, though they made up just
one-fourth of the journals that
were used.
Since digital journal use is gain
ing popularity, senate members
are also trying to sort out the con
flict between convenience and ex
pense, for-profit and non-profit
journals. The line between what
was exploitative and what was not
is not always clear, but for-profit
companies were singled out as
more likely to take advantage of a
University's captive community.
The library system has already
cut costs by over $500,000 from the
approximately $5 million journal
budget by eliminating duplicate
journal subscriptions among differ
ent libraries, especially as more are
accessible online.
The resolution was designed to
take on the problem of expensive

journals from two sides, the faculty
who sustain the journals and the li
braries that purchase them.
Keller also signaled a number of
new initiatives — from digitizing
University theses to creating a cen
tral digital journal archive — that
were in preparation but lacked
funding to get started.
"Digital repositories are going
to be the infrastructure of the fu
ture," Keller said. "It's very impor
tant that we invest as a university."
But digital publishing has not
been the economic panacea that
some originally thought it would be.
"Digital publishing started at
Stanford," Simoni said. "I can still
hear [Keller] saying, 'We're going
to put this together and get the El
seviers of this world.'"
Now, despite efforts of non
profits like Highwire Press, costs
for some journals' electronic ver
sions are greater than the cost for
the print versions.
The library also reported contin
uing cutbacks in service due to bud
get cuts. Still, the University
opened libraries this winter break
for twice as long as previous winter
breaks, according to Keller.
University Provost John
Etchemendy also announced that
Robert Joss, dean of the Graduate
School of Business, and Jim Plum
mer, dean of the School of Engi
neering, would both continue to
serve as deans after having their
terms renewed. Both Joss and
Plummer have served as deans for
the last five years.
In other business, the senate ap
proved small changes to the judicial
bylaws and principle investigator
policies on research.

School of Business, and Jim Plum
mer, dean of the School of Engi
neering, would both continue to
serve as deans after having their
terms renewed. Both Joss and
Plummer have served as deans for
the last five years.
In other business, the senate ap
proved small changes to the judicial
bylaws and principle investigator
policies on research.
A "serials crisis" consumed
the Faculty Senate yesterday af
ternoon as senate members de
bated a set of recommendations
dealing with the high and rapidly
increasing subscription costs for
academic journals.
With journal subscription costs
having risen as much as 50 percent
in the past five years and set to rise
another 12 percent this year, the
Committee on Libraries recom
mended in a report that the senate
set guidelines aimed at reducing
the University's reliance on the
most expensive journals.
"The cost of journals has crip
pled University budgets," said
Biochemistry Prof. Doug Brutlag,
who presented the report.
After more than an hour of dis
cussion, the motion was put off for
debate at another session.

The motion would follow simi
lar actions at Duke University,
Cornell University, Harvard Uni
versity and the University of Cal
ifornia in response to journal
publisher Elsevier's practices of
raising prices and bundling sub
scriptions of small journals with
important journals.
Other universities have refused
to extend their contracts with the
company, which publishes as many
as one-fourth of the frequently
used journals in the sciences.
In comparison, a motion en
couraging libraries to reexamine
their journal subscriptions would
be a mild reaction, though Univer
sity Librarian Michael Keller
noted that Elsevier's contracts
with Stanford are not unfavorable.
"This is a real grassroots ef
fort," said Biological Sciences
Prof. Robert Simoni. "There is a
growing list of universities that
have spoken publicly."

ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a senior, said that expen
sive journal articles harm more
than just University bottom lines.
"This is a huge cost-of-living
issue," she said.
Figueroa emphasized that jour
nal articles published in course
readers, even those by the profes
sors of the course, can become un
reasonably expensive.
Keller shared that sentiment,
pointing out that for-profit pub
lishers have been known to tar
get articles that are in course
packets, increasing costs from
$15 up to $60 when they deter
mine that a journal article is in a
course reader.
The proposed resolution
would have said, among its four
points, "Libraries are encouraged
to systematically drop journals
that are unconscionably or dispro
portionately expensive or infla
tionary. Special attention should
be paid to Elsevier."
It would also have encouraged
faculty to withhold articles from ex
ploitative journals.
The discussion also addressed
the conflict junior faculty could
face between publishing in presti
gious journals and at the same
time avoiding expensive journals.
Many senate members said that
tenure decisions should be unaf
fected by the journals in which a
professor has published.
Others described how periodical
prestige would inevitably find its
way into the tenure process.
"Stanford's process does look at
the reputation a person has
achieved in his or her field,"
Etchemendy said. "In some fields it
is impossible to have work well
known in the field if not published
in certain journals."
Discussion then diverged into
a legal question of whether the
senate might open the University
up to lawsuits by targeting one
company. Some members were
concerned, but others insisted
that it was important to highlight
one company.
"I would love for Elsevier to sue
us," Keller said to widespread
laughter.
Joss asked whether the bad rep
utation of this journal company

was affecting its bottom line and
whether the top levels of manage
ment were concerned.
Keller noted, however, that he
received six calls from stock ana
lysts in the past month and had to
tell them that for every university
like Stanford there are hundreds of
libraries that have "jumped on the
escalator" and accepted Elsevier's
negotiating tactics, thinking they
received good deals.
Some universities, though,
have taken hard lines against the
company, canceling contracts and
inviting press coverage. The Uni
versity of California lacked elec
tronic access to Elsevier's jour
nals for six months while negotia
tions were taking place, according
to Brutlag. In the end, the compa
ny's journals cost the University
of California half its journal bud
get, though they made up just
one-fourth of the journals that
were used.
Since digital journal use is gain
ing popularity, senate members
are also trying to sort out the con
flict between convenience and ex
pense, for-profit and non-profit
journals. The line between what
was exploitative and what was not
is not always clear, but for-profit
companies were singled out as
more likely to take advantage of a
University's captive community.
The library system has already
cut costs by over $500,000 from the
approximately $5 million journal
budget by eliminating duplicate
journal subscriptions among differ
ent libraries, especially as more are
accessible online.
The resolution was designed to
take on the problem of expensive

journals from two sides, the faculty
who sustain the journals and the li
braries that purchase them.
Keller also signaled a number of
new initiatives — from digitizing
University theses to creating a cen
tral digital journal archive — that
were in preparation but lacked
funding to get started.
"Digital repositories are going
to be the infrastructure of the fu
ture," Keller said. "It's very impor
tant that we invest as a university."
But digital publishing has not
been the economic panacea that
some originally thought it would be.
"Digital publishing started at
Stanford," Simoni said. "I can still
hear [Keller] saying, 'We're going
to put this together and get the El
seviers of this world.'"
Now, despite efforts of non
profits like Highwire Press, costs
for some journals' electronic ver
sions are greater than the cost for
the print versions.
The library also reported contin
uing cutbacks in service due to bud
get cuts. Still, the University
opened libraries this winter break
for twice as long as previous winter
breaks, according to Keller.
University Provost John
Etchemendy also announced that
Robert Joss, dean of the Graduate
School of Business, and Jim Plum
