# Med. school doctor wins research prize

### KERRY E. GRENS 
Dr. Eugene Butcher of the Stanford Medical School
won this year's prestigious Crafoord Prize, which recog
nizes individuals who have made significant contributions
to fields not awarded by the Nobel Prize — mathematics,
astronomy, geosciences, biosciences and polyarthritis re
search.
The $500,000 prize goes to a different field each year,
and the 2004 Crafoord Prize — which Butcher shares
with Dr. Timothy Springer from Harvard Medical School
— recognizes work in treating polyarthritis, a painful
joint condition.
Butcher's work has made significant impacts in the scien
tific and medical worlds. Information from his studies has
led to clinical trials to treat inflammatory bowel diseases,
psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma and heart damage after
heart attacks.
Despite the importance of his work. Butcher's comments
remained modest.
"In the way of science, many of our discoveries would
quite likely have been made by others in time," Butcher
said.
But he was first, so he gets the prize, which he said he
would like to use for promoting "women's rights and em
powerment and spreading life beyond our little planet."
Additionally, he plans on funding future research in his
lab, which is based in the Palo Alto Veteran's Administra
tion Health Care Center.
Butcher began his work in the 1980s as a pathology resi
dent at Stanford Medical School and a research fellow in Irv
ing Weissman's laboratory. He wanted to study how cells
recognize each other. From there he uncovered one of the
molecules on the surface of white blood cells that performs
such communication.
Concurrently, Springer was researching another type of
molecule also on the surface of white blood cells, and these
two molecules turned out to be partners in the same process.
"We have been competitors, collaborators and even busi
ness partners," Butcher said of Springer.
Caused by numerous diseases — including rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus and hepatitis — polyarthritis is the inflam
mation of multiple joints. White blood cells protect the body
from infection and help heal inflamed tissues, including
joints suffering from polyarthritis.
White blood cells are vital to a healthy immune response,
which is why having an abnormal amount — due to infec
tion, inflammation or cancer — is cause for alarm.
"They cause a lot of trouble when their activities are not
well regulated, for example, in asthma, chronic lung dis-

eases, inflammatory bowel disease,
psoriasis, multiple sclerosis — the list
is long," Butcher said.
Decades of work by Butcher and
Springer have been devoted to de
scribing the factors involved in getting

white blood cells to where they need to
be, which includes a cast of proteins
whose roles are to link up white blood
cells with blood vessel walls.
Such proteins, called cell adhe
sion molecules, are anchored to the
surface of white blood cells — simi
lar to a golf ball with Velcro. As the
cell zooms through blood vessels
they recognize other proteins wav
ing them down from the blood vessel
wall.
The proteins grab ahold of each

other and the.white blood cell is
able to cross the blood vessel wall
and repair the damaged tissue be

The Crafoord Prize — named for
Holger Crafoord, designer of the first
artificial kidney — will be presented
to the scientists by King Carl XVI
Gustaf of Sweden on Crafoord Day
next fall.
Biological Sciences Prof. Paul
Ehrlich is the only other Stanford
professor to have won the award.
