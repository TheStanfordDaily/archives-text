## Elephant Stampede! Republican organization recruits at Stanford 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
The Republican Party has often
found it hard to garner widespread
student support on college campus
es, which tend to be liberal. This dif
ficulty is particularly noticeable on a
campus like Stanford, where regis
tered Democrats outnumber regis
tered Republicans four to one, ac
cording to precinct registration
records for 2002.
With this in mind, the Republi
can Youth Majority (RYM) — a
nationally based organization
dedicated to mobilizing a younger
generation of Republicans — has
plans for disseminating its mes
sage to students on campus and
forming a Stanford chapter of the
group.
The Republican Youth Majori
ty considers itself a moderate al
ternative to groups that adopt
more conservative policies, which
alienate some students. Among its
list of goals includes building a new
generation of Republicans who are
pro-choice, pro-environment and
pro-fiscal responsibility, according
to Yolanda Vazquez and Kelli
Payne, field representatives for the
RYM.
"We actively seek and recruit
young people who believe that the

Republican Party should include
people that respect differing social
priorities, but share core Republican
principals such as fiscal responsibili
ty, limited taxation and equal oppor
tunity versus equal outcome,"
Payne said.
The RYM openly espouses a pro
choice policy and other, more mod
erate and progressive stances on so
cial issues than the national Republi
can Party.
But is the creation of this new
party a potential threat to the al
ready-established Stanford College
Republicans (SCR)?
According to College Republi
cans President Joseph Fairbanks, a
junior, the answer is a resounding
no. He emphasizes that the RYM is
not a new group on campus, but a
Californian offshoot of the Republi
can Party soliciting new members at
Stanford.
"Last year, we dissolved the
group known as the Stanford Re
publicans, who purported to be a
more moderate Republican
group, because we all realized that
having multiple Republican
groups on campus is not only inef
fective, but divisive," Fairbanks
said. "Thus, the leaders of both
groups decided to come together
under the umbrella of the Stan
ford College Republicans."

Vazquez and Payne acknowledge
a link between their organization and
the Stanford College Republicans —
expressing their plans to cooperate
with SCR on engaging Republican
voters. Their vision of the RYM, how
ever. is quite different from the pic
ture painted by Fairbanks.
"It is not enough for the Stan
ford College Republicans to claim
to be inclusive or sensitive to the
concerns of its members," Vazquez
said. "The evidence is in the nega
tive perceptions that students have
of the College Republicans on
campus."
Within four days of recruitment
at Stanford, the organization has
found support from 40 students who
approve of the more moderate plat
form. Membership in the RYM is
not only limited to Republicans, but
also to undecided and independent
voters who share more conservative
viewpoints.
With the RYM taking a middle
of-the-road stance on many issues,
even the Stanford Democrats could
potentially face a loss of more mod
erate members.
"The leaders of the Republican
Youth Majority ought to come to
Stanford Democrats meetings to
find out if they are Democrats," said
President of the Stanford
Democrats Dylan Mefford, a junior.

"If not, they should join another
party besides the Republicans who
will never express their policy pref
erences and values. Or, they should
start a party of their own. It is far
more difficult to change the Repub
lican Party."
Both the Stanford Democrats
and RYM agree that certain Repub
lican policies tend to alienate the
younger generation of voters. For
this reason, the RYM is broadening
its links to college campuses like
Stanford.
"RYM seeks to broaden the base
of the Republican Party to make it
more inclusive and more reflective
of a broader base that reflects a mod
ern dynamic," Vazquez said. "RYM
seeks to be the voice of all those Re
publican students who would other
wise not feel welcomed into the
party."
With attempts to appeal to cross
partisan lines by adopting both tradi
tionally Democratic and Republican
stances, the question remains as to
how receptive Stanford students will
be to the RYM.
According to Mefford, the perva
sive Democratic sentiments of the
Stanford campus will prevent the
RYM from gaining a stronghold on
campus.
"On campus, Republicans in
any form pose no threat whatsoev
er to Democrats," Mefford said.
"Over 80 percent of Stanford stu
dents and professors vote Demo
cratic. Our voter registration
drive's early results show that
Stanford is becoming even more
Democratic, as Bush alienates peo
ple of all political persuasions and
drives up Democratic registration,
while driving down Republican
registration."
As for the SCR, some question if
the RYM's addition to the Stanford
campus is seen as unnecessary, given
the SCR's incorporation of a wide
range of Republicans on the political
spectrum.
"As the Stanford College Repub
licans, we welcome Republicans
with various viewpoints; therefore,
to have another organization such as
the RYM on campus would merely
be redundant and ineffective," Fair
banks said.
If the RYM makes a notable
presence on Stanford campus, it is
sure to receive a variety of respons
es from the veteran political groups
on campus.
And in spite of these groups'
variant political opinions, they all
face the challenge of engaging an
over-involved student body en
grossed in schoolwork. sports and
extracurricular activities.
"I care about politics and I'm a
political science major, but be
tween classes and other stuff I
have going on, I just can't dedicate
myself to a political organization,"
said sophomore Greg Laughlin.
"Unfortunately, I think a lot of
students have great potential in
politics but have too much work to
get involved."

a link between their organization and
the Stanford College Republicans —
expressing their plans to cooperate
with SCR on engaging Republican
voters. Their vision of the RYM, how
ever. is quite different from the pic
ture painted by Fairbanks.
"It is not enough for the Stan
ford College Republicans to claim
to be inclusive or sensitive to the
concerns of its members," Vazquez
said. "The evidence is in the nega
tive perceptions that students have
of the College Republicans on
campus."
Within four days of recruitment
at Stanford, the organization has
found support from 40 students who
approve of the more moderate plat
form. Membership in the RYM is
not only limited to Republicans, but
also to undecided and independent
voters who share more conservative
viewpoints.
With the RYM taking a middle
of-the-road stance on many issues,
even the Stanford Democrats could
potentially face a loss of more mod
erate members.
"The leaders of the Republican
Youth Majority ought to come to
Stanford Democrats meetings to
find out if they are Democrats," said
President of the Stanford
Democrats Dylan Mefford, a junior.

"If not, they should join another
party besides the Republicans who
will never express their policy pref
erences and values. Or, they should
start a party of their own. It is far
more difficult to change the Repub
lican Party."
Both the Stanford Democrats
and RYM agree that certain Repub
lican policies tend to alienate the
younger generation of voters. For
this reason, the RYM is broadening
its links to college campuses like
Stanford.
"RYM seeks to broaden the base
of the Republican Party to make it
more inclusive and more reflective
of a broader base that reflects a mod
ern dynamic," Vazquez said. "RYM
seeks to be the voice of all those Re
publican students who would other
wise not feel welcomed into the
party."
With attempts to appeal to cross
partisan lines by adopting both tradi
tionally Democratic and Republican
stances, the question remains as to
how receptive Stanford students will
be to the RYM.
According to Mefford, the perva
sive Democratic sentiments of the
Stanford campus will prevent the
RYM from gaining a stronghold on
campus.
"On campus, Republicans in
any form pose no threat whatsoev
er to Democrats," Mefford said.
"Over 80 percent of Stanford stu
dents and professors vote Demo
cratic. Our voter registration
drive's early results show that
Stanford is becoming even more
Democratic, as Bush alienates peo
ple of all political persuasions and
drives up Democratic registration,
while driving down Republican
registration."
As for the SCR, some question if
the RYM's addition to the Stanford
campus is seen as unnecessary, given
the SCR's incorporation of a wide
range of Republicans on the political
spectrum.
"As the Stanford College Repub
licans, we welcome Republicans
with various viewpoints; therefore,
to have another organization such as
the RYM on campus would merely
be redundant and ineffective," Fair
banks said.
If the RYM makes a notable
presence on Stanford campus, it is
sure to receive a variety of respons
es from the veteran political groups
on campus.
And in spite of these groups'
variant political opinions, they all
face the challenge of engaging an
over-involved student body en
grossed in schoolwork. sports and
extracurricular activities.
"I care about politics and I'm a
political science major, but be
tween classes and other stuff I
have going on, I just can't dedicate
myself to a political organization,"
said sophomore Greg Laughlin.
"Unfortunately, I think a lot of
students have great potential in
politics but have too much work to
get involved."

The Republican Party has often
found it hard to garner widespread
student support on college campus
es, which tend to be liberal. This dif
ficulty is particularly noticeable on a
campus like Stanford, where regis
tered Democrats outnumber regis
tered Republicans four to one, ac
cording to precinct registration
records for 2002.
With this in mind, the Republi
can Youth Majority (RYM) — a
nationally based organization
dedicated to mobilizing a younger
generation of Republicans — has
plans for disseminating its mes
sage to students on campus and
forming a Stanford chapter of the
group.
The Republican Youth Majori
ty considers itself a moderate al
ternative to groups that adopt
more conservative policies, which
alienate some students. Among its
list of goals includes building a new
generation of Republicans who are
pro-choice, pro-environment and
pro-fiscal responsibility, according
to Yolanda Vazquez and Kelli
Payne, field representatives for the
RYM.
"We actively seek and recruit
young people who believe that the

Republican Party should include
people that respect differing social
priorities, but share core Republican
principals such as fiscal responsibili
ty, limited taxation and equal oppor
tunity versus equal outcome,"
Payne said.
The RYM openly espouses a pro
choice policy and other, more mod
erate and progressive stances on so
cial issues than the national Republi
can Party.
But is the creation of this new
party a potential threat to the al
ready-established Stanford College
Republicans (SCR)?
According to College Republi
cans President Joseph Fairbanks, a
junior, the answer is a resounding
no. He emphasizes that the RYM is
not a new group on campus, but a
Californian offshoot of the Republi
can Party soliciting new members at
Stanford.
"Last year, we dissolved the
group known as the Stanford Re
publicans, who purported to be a
more moderate Republican
group, because we all realized that
having multiple Republican
groups on campus is not only inef
fective, but divisive," Fairbanks
said. "Thus, the leaders of both
groups decided to come together
under the umbrella of the Stan
ford College Republicans."
