# Conference debates video games as art
## 
### BEN WHALEY 
"Video games are a revolution ... they are an art
form." With that declaration. History Prof. Tim
Lenoir opened "Story Engines: Storytelling and
Computer Games," a conference at the Fairchild
Auditorium on Friday. The conference was associ
ated with the exhibit "Fictional Worlds, Virtual Ex
perience" at the Cantor Center for Visual Arts.
Both the museum exhibit, which is on display
through March, and the "Story Engines" conference
treat video games as works of art and tools for epic
storytelling. But not all museum visitors and confer
ence attendees agreed with this sentiment.
"This show bridges the worlds of art and technol
ogy in ways that we expect to be provocative and in
formative for museum visitors of all ages and back
grounds," said Patience Young, the museum's cura
tor for education.
According to Lenoir, the video games industry is
a rising industry that demands to be noticed and re
spected. In the last fiscal year, video-game sales were
nearly on par with movie ticket sales.
Viewers of the exhibit at Cantor had mixed feel
ings about video games as a form of art. Staring at an
LCD screen displaying snippets of gameplay
footage from "Grand Theft Auto 3," "Final Fantasy
VII" and "Super Mario 64," Adrian Macies, a
Foothill Community College student, admitted that
he did not visit the museum for art.
"I came here mainly to see the video games," he
said. "But I think art and video games are two dif
ferent things. Video games shouldn't disregard their
own limitations. They interact in 3-D where art is 2-
D. It's somewhat like art though."
The exhibit stems from the work of lecturer
Henry Lowood and his "How They Got Game Pro
ject," which researched historical board and video
games as military narrative accounts.
A glass case displaying classic Lucas Arts games
such as "Escape from Monkey Island," "Tie Fight
er" and "Full Throttle" left Cantor visitors Krista
Brown and Kathryn Carrieri a bit puzzled.
"My husband really likes video games so 1 feel
bad saying this ... Video games have artistic aspects
but they're not museum material," Brown said. "It's
okay in small quantities, but a whole museum full?"
Carrieri echoed similar disappointment.
"This is a moment in time exhibit," she said. "It
shows what's been going on in video games ... but it
is so media dependent. I mean sculptures and other
art can be transferred, but this stuff can't."
Attending the conference. Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts admitted, "I have seen the exhib
it and am not particularly surprised by the reactions.
At the same time, I often feel that the exhibits at the
MOM A or Tate Modern are not exactly 'museum
worthy' to my way of thinking, and it is probably best
for museums to offer enough variety to please a
range of aesthetic tastes."
