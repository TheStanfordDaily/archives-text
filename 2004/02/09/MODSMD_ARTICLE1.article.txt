# Conference debates video games as art
## 
### BEN WHALEY 
"Video games are a revolution ... they are an art
form." With that declaration. History Prof. Tim
Lenoir opened "Story Engines: Storytelling and
Computer Games," a conference at the Fairchild
Auditorium on Friday. The conference was associ
ated with the exhibit "Fictional Worlds, Virtual Ex
perience" at the Cantor Center for Visual Arts.
Both the museum exhibit, which is on display
through March, and the "Story Engines" conference
treat video games as works of art and tools for epic
storytelling. But not all museum visitors and confer
ence attendees agreed with this sentiment.
"This show bridges the worlds of art and technol
ogy in ways that we expect to be provocative and in
formative for museum visitors of all ages and back
grounds," said Patience Young, the museum's cura
tor for education.
According to Lenoir, the video games industry is
a rising industry that demands to be noticed and re
spected. In the last fiscal year, video-game sales were
nearly on par with movie ticket sales.
Viewers of the exhibit at Cantor had mixed feel
ings about video games as a form of art. Staring at an
LCD screen displaying snippets of gameplay
footage from "Grand Theft Auto 3," "Final Fantasy
VII" and "Super Mario 64," Adrian Macies, a
Foothill Community College student, admitted that
he did not visit the museum for art.
"I came here mainly to see the video games," he
said. "But I think art and video games are two dif
ferent things. Video games shouldn't disregard their
own limitations. They interact in 3-D where art is 2-
D. It's somewhat like art though."
The exhibit stems from the work of lecturer
Henry Lowood and his "How They Got Game Pro
ject," which researched historical board and video
games as military narrative accounts.
A glass case displaying classic Lucas Arts games
such as "Escape from Monkey Island," "Tie Fight
er" and "Full Throttle" left Cantor visitors Krista
Brown and Kathryn Carrieri a bit puzzled.
"My husband really likes video games so 1 feel
bad saying this ... Video games have artistic aspects
but they're not museum material," Brown said. "It's
okay in small quantities, but a whole museum full?"
Carrieri echoed similar disappointment.
"This is a moment in time exhibit," she said. "It
shows what's been going on in video games ... but it
is so media dependent. I mean sculptures and other
art can be transferred, but this stuff can't."
Attending the conference. Computer Science
Prof. Eric Roberts admitted, "I have seen the exhib
it and am not particularly surprised by the reactions.
At the same time, I often feel that the exhibits at the
MOM A or Tate Modern are not exactly 'museum
worthy' to my way of thinking, and it is probably best
for museums to offer enough variety to please a
range of aesthetic tastes."
Songwriter-turned-game designer Galen Brandt
is working on a piece of software that
integrates music skills to help dis
abled children.
"I could say I don't like video
games cause all you do is run around
and kill people.... But I'd be like
most people and not really know,"
Brandt said. "1 certainly think video
games can have an educational
value."
Conference participants had a va
riety of perspectives on what makes a
video game art. They discussed
whether the artistic elements cam in
graphics, gameplay, or storytelling.
"1 haven't been a particularly ac
tive game player, but 1 was quite
taken in by 'Myst' and Riven,"'
Roberts said. "Their strength lies in
the combination of graphical rich
ness, wonderful puzzles and a rea
sonably detailed storyline."
Lowood focused on the graphics
in one game, "Star Wars: Knights of
the Old Republic," and the sheer
amount of data that was displayed
onscreen in that game.
"|lt is a| beautiful virtual world ..
. with more than meets the eye," he
said. "This could be ancient Greece."
Haden Blackman. producer of

the Star Wars game, disagreed with
the idea that great graphics equal in
stant art. even though his game is dis
played in a theater — like a film — at
the museum.
"It helps if you have a beautiful
game, but if it doesn't have good
gameplay it'll be no fun," Blackman
said.
To the question, "Do games need
stories?" Blackman answered, "No.
Do they need good storytelling? Ab
solutely. I think the storytelling in
games has gotten better, but the
quality of the story is not any more
complex than the structures of 10 to
15 years ago."
By the end of the conference,
speakers agreed that video games
can affect people in similar ways to
other works of art.
"I think both stories and games
are model building blocks for empa
thy," said Will Wright, the creator of
the videogame, "The Sims." "I think
games can evoke emotional re
sponse. In games, I feel emotions like
guilt and pride that I never saw be
fore during a movie."
Reflecting the consensus view,
Blackman said, "II it gives you a new
understanding or emotional re
sponse, it's definitely an art form. I
think most games do this."
The museum exhibit runs through
March 28. A concurrent art exhibit,
"Bang the Machine," is on display at
the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts.
