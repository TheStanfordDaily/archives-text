# TEACHER TALK
## A 						modest proposal 
### PROF. JOHN PERRY DEPARTMENT OF PHILOSOPHY 
Editor's Note: This column is the first in a series of
columns written by Stanford faculty members.

I got into Stanford by the back door.
I could never have been admitted as
a student. I had to get in as a faculty
member.
The students who get into Stanford
are by and large people who had excel
lent grades. They exhibited leader
ship. They committed themselves to
service. They took hard courses. They
earned AP credits. They were stellar
athletes, or chess players, or piano
players, or poets. A few years ago, it

seemed like most of them had started their own soft
ware companies while in high school, although that is a
bit less common now.
In short, Stanford students are generally students who
got their act together in high school.
If I am any example, this is much less true of Stanford
faculty. I avoided hard courses. I was a miserable athlete. I
received mediocre grades. I earned no AP credits. I spent
most of my time working on cars, hanging out with fellow
misfits and moping in my room.
I got my act together in college. It was such a great ex
perience. The transition from high school to college was
like coming out of Plato's cave, something I learned about
my freshman year.
I met professors who believed in socialism and Zen and
the ontological argument, found a library full of books, was
assigned books by written by Plato and Nietzsche and T.S.
Eliot and John Donne, found classes with no quizzes and
had lots of free time to read and think.
I must have been fun to teach. I was so in awe of ev
erything. So malleable and plastic and in need of men
tors — so clearly someone who was undergoing a life
altering experience.
Sometimes students like this make it into Stanford. I
think a disproportionate number of them become philoso
phy majors, and I really enjoy them. But I wish Stanford
had more students that waited to get to college to get their
act together. That is, more students like I was. Students
that don't have success written all over them the day they
arrive, so we could enjoy getting it written all over them by
the day they leave.
Well, how would we do that? Reward mediocre grades,
lack of organization, athletic incompetence and lack of in
volvement in worthwhile causes?
Here is an idea. Preserve 15 percent of the slots each
year for student admitted randomly, without regard to
grades, service, resumes, athletic prowess, or anything else
positive. Well, maybe not quite randomly. Establish some
base level of performance on the SATs, and some base
level of performance on grades (not too high). Then, after
filling up 85 percent of the frosh by the usual criteria,
choose randomly from the remainder that place above the
basic standard.
Then compare how this 15 percent of bright high school
laggards perform with the well-organized, well-graded,
well-recommended, service-oriented, 85 percent. I
wouldn't be surprised if they do quite well. After all, a lot
of that 85 percent are pretty exhausted with being superb
by the time they get here and run out of gas — while my 15
percent may blossom in college.
Anyway, it's worth a try to let a few people like me into
Stanford by the front door and see what happens. I bet
we'd get more philosophy majors.
