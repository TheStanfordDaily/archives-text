## The 						Stanford Daily Editorial Time to tackle textbook costs 
### 
The California Public Interest Re
search Group's (CALPIRG) re
cent report on the rising cost of
textbooks — "Rip-off 101: How
the Current Practices of the Publishing
Industry Drive up the Cost of College
Textbooks" — reveals to what extent stu
dents are at the mercy of corporations for
their academic expenses. Unable to find
used books, students end up purchasing
"new editions" that often offer little addi
tional material except CD-ROMs and
workbooks. Professors, in turn, rarely uti
lize these supplemental materials, and
there are few academic gains.
We urge students to consider online al
ternatives for used books such as Ama
zon.com and eßay.com. While these ser
vices require students to wait for book
delivery, one can save significantly if will
ing to research the various available op
tions. Similarly, Stanford's SU.markct
newsgroup is a good source to track used
books; indeed, the more students start
using SU.markct to trade books, the
more competitive the prices offered on
the service will become.
Other initiatives, such as ASSITs Book
Service, are a step in the right direction
because they grant students more control
over the distribution of used books, and
concurrently reduce the ability of con
glomerates to dictate prices. The non
profit ASSU Book Service allows stu

dents to buy and sell used books on cam
pus independent of the Stanford Book
store, and therefore, at better prices. Fur
thermore, the fact that it operates
through booths in White Plaza gives it a
large advantage in terms of visibility. And
while the service is not without its prob
lems — students can currently only make
purchases using cash or checks, the range
is limited to major lecture classes and re
funds are not possible — we applaud the
ASSITs efforts to reduce student costs, a
staggering $1,300 for books annually.
We also urge professors to inform stu
dents about which old editions of text
books are valid lor their courses, and to
proactively support programs that seek
to publish books online. One such ser
vice — spearheaded by Profs. Paul
Krugman and Robin Wells of Princeton
and Prof. Paul Romer of Stanford —
aims to provide economics textbooks on
line for half their current prices. Profes
sors should pressure publishers to pro
vide supplemental packages instead of
new editions when minor updates arc
made. The practice of putting works on
reserve at the University's libraries
should also be continued.
Indeed, if students and professors —
as the primary consumers of textbooks
— collaborate on this issue, there is hope
that a more reasonable pricing scheme
can be arrived at.
