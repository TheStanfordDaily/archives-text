## Students criticize PATRIOT Act 
### KATE SKOLNICK EVAN BERGER 
Nearly 29 months have
elapsed since Sept.
11, 2001, and 28
months since the pas
sage of the USA PATRIOT
Act. While the first event still
looms large in our minds, the
second has managed to slip
from our radar screens.
In the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks, the Bush administra
tion capitalized on widespread
fears in order to forcefully
steamroll the USA PATRIOT
Act through Congress, despite
the concerns of both liberal and
conservative politicians. By
draping the legislation in the
language of patriotism, the ad
ministration stifled opposition
to the 342-page bill, which
passed after little debate. Many
of those who voted for the bill
have since claimed that their
staff never even read it.
U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft has defended the
"Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appro
priate Tools Required to Inter
cept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act" — better known as PA
TRIOT — by claiming that it
contains only those provisions
necessary to fight terrorism.
But a number of the USA PA
TRIOT Act's far-reaching and
ambiguous provisions have cre
ated anxiety that cuts across
ideological lines. Among its
more alarming statutes, the Act
expands law enforcement capa
bilities to such that the FBI can
undertake surveillance of ordi
nary people without probable
cause; conduct warrant-less
wiretaps; and access medical
and even library records
(gasp!). Think twice before you

check out "Lady Chatterley's
Lover" again.
In its own words, the USA
PATRIOT Act grants "authority
for delaying notice of the execu
tion of warrant" — indefinitely.
This permits the government to
conduct what are known as
"sneak and peak" searches, in
which authorities can search citi
zens' homes without notifying
the residents. Students; Hide
your knitting needles. The FBI
can enter your dorm room on
grounds of domestic terrorism
without telling you.
Another provision gives the
government vast authority to
label certain groups as "domes
tic terrorists." This ambiguous
designation allows the govern
ment to harass and prosecute
any groups involved in political
advocacy. And what, you might
ask, is domestic terrorism? Sec
tion 802 (B) defines it as an at
tempt to "influence the policy
of a government by intimida
tion or coercion." It is no won
der that both liberal and con
servative groups nationwide
have registered strong concern
for the provision.
National awareness about
such aspects of the Act remain
low, but senators and students
alike have become concerned
over these threats to civil liber
ties. In January 2003, the Stan
ford Faculty Senate passed a
resolution opposing the USA
PATRIOT Act; so have Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County.
Members of Congress have
also had second thoughts. Re
cently, Sen. Larry Craig, sup
ported by a bipartisan group of
senators, proposed the Safety
and Freedom Ensured (SAFE)
Act, which would repeal some of
the USA PATRIOT Act's most
troublesome provisions. But the

issue remains controversial in
Congress, and the SAFE Act has
not yet left committee.
Despite Bush's recent at
tempts to revive and extend the
USA PATRIOT Act, Stanford
students have finally begun to
wake up to its dangers. A broad
coalition of student groups has
been working to raise aware
ness and to take action. Last
month, the ASSU Senate rec
ognized the threat it poses to
students — from potential
crackdowns on student organiz
ing to the difficulties that inter
national students face in enter
ing the country — by passing a
resolution that called upon the
Stanford administration and
student body to voice support
for the SAFE Act. Tomorrow
night, the campus-wide effort
continues; the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice
will be hosting a forum entitled
"Perspectives on the PATRIOT
Act" at 7 p.m. in the Tresidder
Oak Room, and is conducting a
letter-writing campaign to Rep.
Anna Eshoo, calling on her to
support the SAFE Act.
Join us at the forum on Tues
day night and in White Plaza at
noon on Tuesday and Wednes
day to join the movement to stop
the USA PATRIOT Act from in
flicting further harm. Ashcroft
says it's about fighting terrorism.
However, with its disturbing
vagueness, the USA PATRIOT
Act transcends its mandate and
limits not only the fundamental
civil liberties of would-be terror
ists, but yours too.

alike have become concerned
over these threats to civil liber
ties. In January 2003, the Stan
ford Faculty Senate passed a
resolution opposing the USA
PATRIOT Act; so have Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County.
Members of Congress have
also had second thoughts. Re
cently, Sen. Larry Craig, sup
ported by a bipartisan group of
senators, proposed the Safety
and Freedom Ensured (SAFE)
Act, which would repeal some of
the USA PATRIOT Act's most
troublesome provisions. But the

issue remains controversial in
Congress, and the SAFE Act has
not yet left committee.
Despite Bush's recent at
tempts to revive and extend the
USA PATRIOT Act, Stanford
students have finally begun to
wake up to its dangers. A broad
coalition of student groups has
been working to raise aware
ness and to take action. Last
month, the ASSU Senate rec
ognized the threat it poses to
students — from potential
crackdowns on student organiz
ing to the difficulties that inter
national students face in enter
ing the country — by passing a
resolution that called upon the
Stanford administration and
student body to voice support
for the SAFE Act. Tomorrow
night, the campus-wide effort
continues; the Stanford Com
munity for Peace and Justice
will be hosting a forum entitled
"Perspectives on the PATRIOT
Act" at 7 p.m. in the Tresidder
Oak Room, and is conducting a
letter-writing campaign to Rep.
Anna Eshoo, calling on her to
support the SAFE Act.
Join us at the forum on Tues
day night and in White Plaza at
noon on Tuesday and Wednes
day to join the movement to stop
the USA PATRIOT Act from in
flicting further harm. Ashcroft
says it's about fighting terrorism.
However, with its disturbing
vagueness, the USA PATRIOT
Act transcends its mandate and
limits not only the fundamental
civil liberties of would-be terror
ists, but yours too.

Nearly 29 months have
elapsed since Sept.
11, 2001, and 28
months since the pas
sage of the USA PATRIOT
Act. While the first event still
looms large in our minds, the
second has managed to slip
from our radar screens.
In the wake of the Sept. 11
attacks, the Bush administra
tion capitalized on widespread
fears in order to forcefully
steamroll the USA PATRIOT
Act through Congress, despite
the concerns of both liberal and
conservative politicians. By
draping the legislation in the
language of patriotism, the ad
ministration stifled opposition
to the 342-page bill, which
passed after little debate. Many
of those who voted for the bill
have since claimed that their
staff never even read it.
U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft has defended the
"Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appro
priate Tools Required to Inter
cept and Obstruct Terrorism
Act" — better known as PA
TRIOT — by claiming that it
contains only those provisions
necessary to fight terrorism.
But a number of the USA PA
TRIOT Act's far-reaching and
ambiguous provisions have cre
ated anxiety that cuts across
ideological lines. Among its
more alarming statutes, the Act
expands law enforcement capa
bilities to such that the FBI can
undertake surveillance of ordi
nary people without probable
cause; conduct warrant-less
wiretaps; and access medical
and even library records
(gasp!). Think twice before you

check out "Lady Chatterley's
Lover" again.
In its own words, the USA
PATRIOT Act grants "authority
for delaying notice of the execu
tion of warrant" — indefinitely.
This permits the government to
conduct what are known as
"sneak and peak" searches, in
which authorities can search citi
zens' homes without notifying
the residents. Students; Hide
your knitting needles. The FBI
can enter your dorm room on
grounds of domestic terrorism
without telling you.
Another provision gives the
government vast authority to
label certain groups as "domes
tic terrorists." This ambiguous
designation allows the govern
ment to harass and prosecute
any groups involved in political
advocacy. And what, you might
ask, is domestic terrorism? Sec
tion 802 (B) defines it as an at
tempt to "influence the policy
of a government by intimida
tion or coercion." It is no won
der that both liberal and con
servative groups nationwide
have registered strong concern
for the provision.
National awareness about
such aspects of the Act remain
low, but senators and students
alike have become concerned
over these threats to civil liber
ties. In January 2003, the Stan
ford Faculty Senate passed a
resolution opposing the USA
PATRIOT Act; so have Palo
Alto and Santa Clara County.
