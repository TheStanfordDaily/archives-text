Factual errors in op-ed
There are a number of factual er
rors in Wednesday's op-ed about the
grocery workers strike in Southern
California ("Students should boycott
Safeway," Feb. 4). Only 21,000 of the
70,000 striking (and locked out)
workers work for Safeway— and
these workers are actually employed
at Vons and Pavilions stores, which
are owned by Safeway. The remain
ing 49,000 workers have been locked
out by Ralph's and Albertsons. Con
trary to what the article states, Safe
way does not own Ralph's and Al
bertsons.
Further, Safeway's operating
profits have not risen by 47 percent in
the last five years. Up-to-date infor
mation on Safeway's finances can be
found online.
I dislike Safeway as much as — if
not more than — the author of the
op-ed does, but it's hard to believe
that so little accurate research was
done for this piece.

Striking grocery worker speaks
about experience
I would like to thank The Stanford
Daily for running an op-ed on the
grocery workers' strikes ("Students
should boycott Safeway," Feb. 4) in
California. My experience as a gro
cery business employee has been
greatly enriched by being a member
of the United Food and Commercial
Workers' (UFCW). The on-going
grocery industry workers strike in
Southern California is a unique
learning experience for my co-work
ers and me. I remember a number of
times when we have stood strong
during this strike, but amidst recol
lections of joy and pain there are also
worries about an uncertain future for
our families. I remember the hard
ship of the preceding days and the re
jection and harassment from unsym
pathetic customers; but more impor
tant and fresh in my memory are the
support and good gestures of the
public, and the solidarity and com

panionship of fellow union members
from other locations that came to
stand with us. These examples of
team spirit will never be deleted from
my memory and from my life. I am
strongly convinced that continuing
this struggle together to the end will
make us stronger and result in victo
ry for our movement.

Sixth Man's unruliness
should be contained
The Sixth Man club can be a
wonderful adjunct to the Cardinal
basketball team by inspiring the
team to greater efforts and ener
gizing all the spectators. But it can
also be cruel and vicious, especial
ly when verbal attacks are made on
opposing players in a personal
manner that has nothing to do with
basketball. Such conduct should
not be condoned nor sanctioned —
directly or indirectly — by the
University.
For instance, some members of
the Sixth Man club clearly research
the histories of the opposing play
ers to find sensitive, vulnerable
areas that can be attacked. The
chants are intended to adversely af
fect the on-court efforts of the par
ticular player. This is just another
form of bullying, albeit at the col
lege level. It isn't witty or clever —
it's just plain cruel and boorish, and
reflects poorly on the values of the
speaker. As with most bullying, it is
also a cowardly act. It is unlikely
that such slurs would be made with
out the anonymity and protection a
crowd provides. Not only does this
behavior cross the line of good
taste, but 1 also find it morally of
fensive. I doubt that the offending
individuals would themselves like
to endure similar personal, public
attacks.
Besides being an embarrassment
to other spectators, this is an abuse
of free speech. It crosses the line of
acceptable speech and has no place
in college athletics. For athletes,
trash-talking results in technical

foul. The University, or better yet,
the PAC-10 should institute regula
tions to deal with this kind of behav
ior. The Big Ten encountered a sim
ilar issue and recently passed a
league rule stating, "Institutions
will be held responsible for school
sponsored student sections that at
tack or single out student-athletes."
I suggest that the PAC-10 Confer
ence does likewise. If the league
fails to act, the University should
take appropriate action.

Mock Trial serves the community
I was delighted to see an article
about the Stanford Mock Trial team
in The Stanford Daily ("Don't mock
it 'til you try it," Feb. 4). As an out
sider to the Stanford community, 1
wanted to comment on what a great
group of students the Mock Trial
team is and to commend them on
what they are doing for high school
students in the Bay Area.
For the last two years, Stanford
students have helped train high
school students from Santa Clara,
San Mateo and San Francisco Coun
ties. The Stanford collegiate Mock
Trial team, in association with the
Stanford Pre-Law Society, hosts a
mock trial training day for Bay Area
high schools in the fall. This year
over 200 high school students at
tended the event. The training is
particularly helpful for the less ex
perienced teams. Many of the Stan
ford trainers, such as Julia Martinez,
a senior and co-president of the
mock trial team, first participated in
mock trial in high school. Martinez's
Colorado high school team was
state champion. Further, some of
the Stanford instructors, such as
freshman Lauren Young, were high
school trainees themselves the pre
vious year.
A big thanks to these Stanford
students who are making a differ
ence in the community.

also a cowardly act. It is unlikely
that such slurs would be made with
out the anonymity and protection a
crowd provides. Not only does this
behavior cross the line of good
taste, but 1 also find it morally of
fensive. I doubt that the offending
individuals would themselves like
to endure similar personal, public
attacks.
Besides being an embarrassment
to other spectators, this is an abuse
of free speech. It crosses the line of
acceptable speech and has no place
in college athletics. For athletes,
trash-talking results in technical

foul. The University, or better yet,
the PAC-10 should institute regula
tions to deal with this kind of behav
ior. The Big Ten encountered a sim
ilar issue and recently passed a
league rule stating, "Institutions
will be held responsible for school
sponsored student sections that at
tack or single out student-athletes."
I suggest that the PAC-10 Confer
ence does likewise. If the league
fails to act, the University should
take appropriate action.

Mock Trial serves the community
I was delighted to see an article
about the Stanford Mock Trial team
in The Stanford Daily ("Don't mock
it 'til you try it," Feb. 4). As an out
sider to the Stanford community, 1
wanted to comment on what a great
group of students the Mock Trial
team is and to commend them on
what they are doing for high school
students in the Bay Area.
For the last two years, Stanford
students have helped train high
school students from Santa Clara,
San Mateo and San Francisco Coun
ties. The Stanford collegiate Mock
Trial team, in association with the
Stanford Pre-Law Society, hosts a
mock trial training day for Bay Area
high schools in the fall. This year
over 200 high school students at
tended the event. The training is
particularly helpful for the less ex
perienced teams. Many of the Stan
ford trainers, such as Julia Martinez,
a senior and co-president of the
mock trial team, first participated in
mock trial in high school. Martinez's
Colorado high school team was
state champion. Further, some of
the Stanford instructors, such as
freshman Lauren Young, were high
school trainees themselves the pre
vious year.
A big thanks to these Stanford
students who are making a differ
ence in the community.

Factual errors in op-ed
There are a number of factual er
rors in Wednesday's op-ed about the
grocery workers strike in Southern
California ("Students should boycott
Safeway," Feb. 4). Only 21,000 of the
70,000 striking (and locked out)
workers work for Safeway— and
these workers are actually employed
at Vons and Pavilions stores, which
are owned by Safeway. The remain
ing 49,000 workers have been locked
out by Ralph's and Albertsons. Con
trary to what the article states, Safe
way does not own Ralph's and Al
bertsons.
Further, Safeway's operating
profits have not risen by 47 percent in
the last five years. Up-to-date infor
mation on Safeway's finances can be
found online.
I dislike Safeway as much as — if
not more than — the author of the
op-ed does, but it's hard to believe
that so little accurate research was
done for this piece.

Striking grocery worker speaks
about experience
I would like to thank The Stanford
Daily for running an op-ed on the
grocery workers' strikes ("Students
should boycott Safeway," Feb. 4) in
California. My experience as a gro
cery business employee has been
greatly enriched by being a member
of the United Food and Commercial
Workers' (UFCW). The on-going
grocery industry workers strike in
Southern California is a unique
learning experience for my co-work
ers and me. I remember a number of
times when we have stood strong
during this strike, but amidst recol
lections of joy and pain there are also
worries about an uncertain future for
our families. I remember the hard
ship of the preceding days and the re
jection and harassment from unsym
pathetic customers; but more impor
tant and fresh in my memory are the
support and good gestures of the
public, and the solidarity and com

panionship of fellow union members
from other locations that came to
stand with us. These examples of
team spirit will never be deleted from
my memory and from my life. I am
strongly convinced that continuing
this struggle together to the end will
make us stronger and result in victo
ry for our movement.

Sixth Man's unruliness
should be contained
The Sixth Man club can be a
wonderful adjunct to the Cardinal
basketball team by inspiring the
team to greater efforts and ener
gizing all the spectators. But it can
also be cruel and vicious, especial
ly when verbal attacks are made on
opposing players in a personal
manner that has nothing to do with
basketball. Such conduct should
not be condoned nor sanctioned —
directly or indirectly — by the
University.
For instance, some members of
the Sixth Man club clearly research
the histories of the opposing play
ers to find sensitive, vulnerable
areas that can be attacked. The
chants are intended to adversely af
fect the on-court efforts of the par
ticular player. This is just another
form of bullying, albeit at the col
lege level. It isn't witty or clever —
it's just plain cruel and boorish, and
reflects poorly on the values of the
speaker. As with most bullying, it is
also a cowardly act. It is unlikely
that such slurs would be made with
out the anonymity and protection a
crowd provides. Not only does this
behavior cross the line of good
