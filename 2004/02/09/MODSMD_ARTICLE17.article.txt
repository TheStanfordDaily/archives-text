## Recent genetic innovations raise troubling ethical questions 
### ABIGAIL MCDANIEL 
Eugenics, designer babies and sci
ence unbounded by ethical con
siderations— the stuff of the
past, of the future or of night
mares? Or is it simply a logical continua
tion of certain remarks made by Nobel
laureate Paul Berg in his recent lecture,
"Biomedical Innovations: Confronting
the Polity"?
In the first of a series of lectures, enti
tled "Sequencing the Human Genome:
What Does it Tell Us About Ourselves,"
sponsored by the Department of Biologi
cal Sciences, Berg addressed topics such
as the development of recombinant DNA
technologies, the sequencing of the
human genome and human cloning.
While Berg clarified the scientific as
pects of his work, he effectively dismissed
any ethical concerns other than those that
pose "a clear and present danger to
human or environmental health." In con
cluding his talk, he stated that his "great
est concern for the future is that we give
overly much concern to the problems real
and imagined that science occasionally
brings with it." He called for science to
"liberate us from ignorance, prejudice
and superstition." He also proclaimed.
"The search for new knowledge must
have no boundaries. It is the application

of that knowledge that can be the subject
for reasoned and informed debate."
These remarks may seem like the noble
goals of a person in pursuit of truth through
science, but they carry a much darker sig
nificance. By freeing science from its appli
cations, we clear the way for science with
out ethical boundaries. This concept is
dangerous in a society in which the force of
the media, the economy and the public
"good" often push scientific research into
application without consideration for its
consequences. Before accepting science
without boundaries, let us examine the re
ality and foreseeable future of the genetic
technology that Berg helped to create.
Take, for example, the prenatal diag
nosis of genetic defects using amniocente
sis — a procedure in which amniotic fluid
surrounding a fetus in the womb is
screened fora variety of chromosomal
conditions such as Down syndrome,
hemophilia and cystic fibrosis. A positive
diagnosis indicates, with near 100 percent
certainty, a specific genetic abnormality
in the fetus. Following a positive diagno
sis, which usually takes place midway
through the second trimester, the mother
then decides either to keep or abort the
fetus, a procedure referred to as genetic or
selective abortion.
While currently only recommended to
women 35 or older and those with a family

or reproductive history of birth defects, a
recent study has found that amniocentesis
can be "cost effective at any age or risk
level" and should be offered to all pregnant
women. Such routine amniocentesis would
mean an increase in genetic abortions.
These women have been described by
one anthropologist as the "normalizing
gatekeepers" of our society, deciding what
quality of children they will choose to grant
entrance into our world. They hold an enor
mous power, one granted by our respect for
the right of choice. The decision to abort se
lectively is complex. Some women chose to
abort because they feel that they would be
forcing a life of suffering on their child. Oth
ers, like a father quoted in recent study on
the social impact of amniocentesis, are less
compassionate. "It's devastating, it's a
waste, all the love that goes into kids like
that," he said.
It is not my aim to pass judgment on the
individuals who choose to use this technolo
gy, but rather to consider the consequences
of their combined individual choices as they
affect society as a whole and to consider
where the unlimited use of technology with
out an ethical guide might lead us.
Dan W. Brock, a former philosophy
and biomedical ethics professor at Brown
University who is currently employed at
the Department of Clinical Bioethics at
the National Institutes of Health, recently

said, "It's uncontroversial that serious dis
abilities should be prevented in born per
sons ... it's considered a misfortune to be
born blind or with a serious cognitive dis
ability, but if it's a bad thing fora born
person, then why not prevent these condi
tions in someone who will be born?" That
is to say that we should abort those human
beings we regard as "defective."
In a society that holds equality at a pre
mium, one can't help but question the eu
genic implications of a technology that re
sults in the abortion of those with undesir
able genetic traits. This is not the eugenics
of Hitler; rather it is wTiat has been termed
"microeugenics" — the eugenics of indi
vidual choice in a free-market economy.
The pursuit of scientific knowledge unre
stricted by ethics could be disastrous in a
society in which the existence of a technol
ogy all too often implies its use.
Under these conditions, one can imag
ine that with selective abortion may come
the "positive eugenics" (selection and
propagation of desirable traits) of genetic
enhancement. Our offspring could be made
to conform to societal ideals of height, hair
color and even personality. With the ability
to realize our ideals, what will be the stigma
on those who do not live up to them?
Is this the liberation from prejudice
envisaged by Berg's pursuit of knowledge
without boundaries? Are these ends we

feel comfortable dismissing? If not, we
may want to listen to the voices in our so
ciety urging the responsible use of tech
nology and the cautious pursuit of scien
tific knowledge. According to Dr. Leon
Kass, Chairman of the President's Coun
cil on Bioethics, "The probable or possi
ble harmful effects of the widespread use
of a new technique should be anticipated,
and introduced as costs to be weighed in
deciding about its first use."
The goal of this caution is not to halt or
"criminalize" scientific progress, as Berg
characterized social concerns and legisla
tive regulations. It is rather to be responsi
ble in a society where the representation
and misrepresentation of science in the
media is accepted too quickly as truth.
Most importantly, the goal is to be
mindful of the power that technology has
— the power to uproot the values of
equality and tolerance in which our society
takes pride, our citizens take comfort and
our hearts find meaning. Is science re
sponsible for the consequences of its tech
nology? Perhaps not, but then we might
also conclude that science without bound
aries represents a danger we might not be
ready to accept.

"Biomedical Innovations: Confronting
the Polity"?
In the first of a series of lectures, enti
tled "Sequencing the Human Genome:
What Does it Tell Us About Ourselves,"
sponsored by the Department of Biologi
cal Sciences, Berg addressed topics such
as the development of recombinant DNA
technologies, the sequencing of the
human genome and human cloning.
While Berg clarified the scientific as
pects of his work, he effectively dismissed
any ethical concerns other than those that
pose "a clear and present danger to
human or environmental health." In con
cluding his talk, he stated that his "great
est concern for the future is that we give
overly much concern to the problems real
and imagined that science occasionally
brings with it." He called for science to
"liberate us from ignorance, prejudice
and superstition." He also proclaimed.
"The search for new knowledge must
have no boundaries. It is the application

of that knowledge that can be the subject
for reasoned and informed debate."
These remarks may seem like the noble
goals of a person in pursuit of truth through
science, but they carry a much darker sig
nificance. By freeing science from its appli
cations, we clear the way for science with
out ethical boundaries. This concept is
dangerous in a society in which the force of
the media, the economy and the public
"good" often push scientific research into
application without consideration for its
consequences. Before accepting science
without boundaries, let us examine the re
ality and foreseeable future of the genetic
technology that Berg helped to create.
Take, for example, the prenatal diag
nosis of genetic defects using amniocente
sis — a procedure in which amniotic fluid
surrounding a fetus in the womb is
screened fora variety of chromosomal
conditions such as Down syndrome,
hemophilia and cystic fibrosis. A positive
diagnosis indicates, with near 100 percent
certainty, a specific genetic abnormality
in the fetus. Following a positive diagno
sis, which usually takes place midway
through the second trimester, the mother
then decides either to keep or abort the
fetus, a procedure referred to as genetic or
selective abortion.
While currently only recommended to
women 35 or older and those with a family

or reproductive history of birth defects, a
recent study has found that amniocentesis
can be "cost effective at any age or risk
level" and should be offered to all pregnant
women. Such routine amniocentesis would
mean an increase in genetic abortions.
These women have been described by
one anthropologist as the "normalizing
gatekeepers" of our society, deciding what
quality of children they will choose to grant
entrance into our world. They hold an enor
mous power, one granted by our respect for
the right of choice. The decision to abort se
lectively is complex. Some women chose to
abort because they feel that they would be
forcing a life of suffering on their child. Oth
ers, like a father quoted in recent study on
the social impact of amniocentesis, are less
compassionate. "It's devastating, it's a
waste, all the love that goes into kids like
that," he said.
It is not my aim to pass judgment on the
individuals who choose to use this technolo
gy, but rather to consider the consequences
of their combined individual choices as they
affect society as a whole and to consider
where the unlimited use of technology with
out an ethical guide might lead us.
Dan W. Brock, a former philosophy
and biomedical ethics professor at Brown
University who is currently employed at
the Department of Clinical Bioethics at
the National Institutes of Health, recently

said, "It's uncontroversial that serious dis
abilities should be prevented in born per
sons ... it's considered a misfortune to be
born blind or with a serious cognitive dis
ability, but if it's a bad thing fora born
person, then why not prevent these condi
tions in someone who will be born?" That
is to say that we should abort those human
beings we regard as "defective."
In a society that holds equality at a pre
mium, one can't help but question the eu
genic implications of a technology that re
sults in the abortion of those with undesir
able genetic traits. This is not the eugenics
of Hitler; rather it is wTiat has been termed
"microeugenics" — the eugenics of indi
vidual choice in a free-market economy.
The pursuit of scientific knowledge unre
stricted by ethics could be disastrous in a
society in which the existence of a technol
ogy all too often implies its use.
Under these conditions, one can imag
ine that with selective abortion may come
the "positive eugenics" (selection and
propagation of desirable traits) of genetic
enhancement. Our offspring could be made
to conform to societal ideals of height, hair
color and even personality. With the ability
to realize our ideals, what will be the stigma
on those who do not live up to them?
Is this the liberation from prejudice
envisaged by Berg's pursuit of knowledge
without boundaries? Are these ends we

feel comfortable dismissing? If not, we
may want to listen to the voices in our so
ciety urging the responsible use of tech
nology and the cautious pursuit of scien
tific knowledge. According to Dr. Leon
Kass, Chairman of the President's Coun
cil on Bioethics, "The probable or possi
ble harmful effects of the widespread use
of a new technique should be anticipated,
and introduced as costs to be weighed in
deciding about its first use."
The goal of this caution is not to halt or
"criminalize" scientific progress, as Berg
characterized social concerns and legisla
tive regulations. It is rather to be responsi
ble in a society where the representation
and misrepresentation of science in the
media is accepted too quickly as truth.
Most importantly, the goal is to be
mindful of the power that technology has
— the power to uproot the values of
equality and tolerance in which our society
takes pride, our citizens take comfort and
our hearts find meaning. Is science re
sponsible for the consequences of its tech
nology? Perhaps not, but then we might
also conclude that science without bound
aries represents a danger we might not be
ready to accept.
