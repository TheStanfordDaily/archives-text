# A 						game to brag to the kids about
## 
### 
Every Stanford basketball fan is
understandably ecstatic about
the Cardinal's spectacular vic
tory over Arizona on Satur
day. The Arizona-Stanford series has
seen tight game after tight game in re
cent years, but Saturday's finish was
the best of them all.
Matt Lottich forcing a turnover just
as Arizona should have been attempting
their own game-winner? Nick Robinson
hitting an off-balance 35-footer to win
the game in regulation after Salim
Stoudamire all but put the game away
only moments earlier? These are the
kinds of things I'll mention to my disin
terested kids 20 years from now when I
talk about how great Stanford basket
ball was back in the day.
But while I fully enjoyed Satur
day's victory, I do want to say one

thing — Arizona is a
scarily good team,
and they are only
going to get better.
Guess which mem
bers of the Arizona
roster won't be back
next year, barring any
early entrants to the
NBA Draft.
Anyone come to
mind?

If you're like me and you had to look
it up, you would find that Jason Ranne
and Fil Torres are a pair of walk-on
guards with six NCAA baskets be
tween them.
Arizona is going to be back next
year. A year older, a year stronger, and.
knowing head coach Lute Olson, a new
hotshot freshman or two.
Meanwhile, Stanford will graduate
starters Justin Davis and Matt Lottich
and regular contributor Joe Kirchofer.
In other words, this rivalry isn't
going anywhere just because someone
finally won on their home court.
Look at these game scores from this
millenium's Arizona-Stanford series,
in reverse chronology: 80-77, 82-72,72-
69, 88-82 (OT), 76-71, 85-76, 76-75, 68-
65,86-81.
And which team won more of those
hotly contested games?
You guessed it — Arizona won five
times and Stanford won five times.
Close game after close game. Well
played game after well-played game.
Intense competition, minute by
minute, year by year.
Is there a better rivalry in college
basketball?
I submit that there is not.
The Arizona-Stanford rivalry im
presses me more than any other not
only because of the stunning consisten
cy with which these schools take each
other to the wire time after time, re
gardless of how much better one team
is than the other.
But it also impresses me, though, be
cause it is purely based on the fact that
these are the two best basketball pro
grams in the Pacific-10 Conference. It's
a rivalry because close games are
played, year after year, at a level of bas
ketball often unavailable from any of
the Pac-10's other members.
It is not a rivalry ridden with ani
mosity, personal beefs on the court or
perceived grudges in the stands.
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there's a
sizeable contingent of fans at both
schools that "hate" the other school.
But I have never encountered that
sentiment in three years going to
games here.
I always get the sense that the Sixth
Man Club is genuinely excited to see
Arizona coming to town. Even though
it's the toughest home game of the
year. Even though Stanford is more
likely to lose this game than any other.
It's about seeing two great basket
ball teams fight it out tooth and nail.
It's not like Big Game, where most of
the people in the stands care less about
football than they do about bragging
rights, hooliganism and schadenfreude.
No, this rivalry is about players
playing a sport at a very high level and
fans getting to watch it. This is what a
rivalry should be; this is the kind of ri
valry you see in Gil Thorp or motiva
tional youth sports movies on the Dis
ney channel.
Two days ago, a national television
audience got to witness a beautiful dis
play of high-octane basketball. The
Pac-10 may be weak this year, but the
conference's premiere rivalry is as
strong as ever.
