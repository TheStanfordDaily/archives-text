# Scholar discusses Nehru
## 
### JULIE LEIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Shashi Tharoor argued that Jawaharlal
Nehru, India's first prime minister, had a
more profound effect on India than many
scholars believe, in a talk on Saturday. Tha
roor, the U.N. under-secretary-general for
communications and public information,
read from and discussed his recent biogra
phy, "Nehru: The Invention of India."
Tharoor identified four pillars that define
Nehru and his influence on India today. The
first was the start of a dynasty, which Tha
roor described as an unintentional act and a
byproduct of his legacy. The second was so
cialism, which Tharoor described as disas
trous but understandable given the former
colony's desire to disavow any ties to capital
ism and its association with slavery. The third
was a foreign policy that convinced people
that India's freedom was genuine. The
fourth pillar was secularism, emphasizing
Nehru's conviction that India should not be
a religious state that welcomed Hindus and
excluded Muslims.
"With these convictions, Nehru invented
India," lliaroor said.
The author also tried to personalize
Nehru, describing the influences that drove
him. Tharoor emphasized Nehru's relation
ship with his father as a vital part of Nehru's
political aspirations. He described Nehru as
"Gandhi's protegÂ£" in spite of the two
friends' intense disagreements on policies
for the Indian nationalist movement.
A self-described novelist, Tharoor said

he wrote the account of Nehru as a combi
nation of biography and meditation. He said
he believes the book's style will appeal to
people who would not normally delve into
scholarly works.
"It is essentially a non-academic book
that is wistfully devoid of footnotes," Tha
roor said.
Tharoor added that his decision to write
the book at this time stems from mainstream
Indian culture's repudiation of some aspects
of Nehru's life and legacy.
In addition to giving humorous anecdotes
and reading passages from his novel, Tha
roor provided personal reflection on Nehru
and his significance to India.
"I was really impressed with his accessi
bility as a speaker," said sophomore Bhavya
Monan. "The anecdotes ne shared about
Nehru were interesting because they de
scribed his achievements while still keeping
him a human figure. I really got the impres
sion that Tharoor empathized with Nehru as
a person, and this intellectual connection
drew him to writing the biography."
"We were very happy to have Dr. Tha
roor be able to come to Stanford, it was a rare
opportunity for Sanskriti and the student
body said sophomore Ratul Narain, a cul
tural committee officer for Sanskriti. "It was
fascinating to see someone who works di
rectly under Kofi Annan in the U.N. but who
also has time to write a great book on one of
India's greatest leaders. Also, what im
pressed me was his ability to apply his
knowledge of Nehru to current political is
sues around the world."
