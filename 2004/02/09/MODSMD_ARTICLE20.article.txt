## Card proves tough to beat 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the game ended, the fans didn't leave.
First, they rushed out of the stands and piled on the
Stanford basketball team, which had piled on Nick
Robinson where he lay after hitting the improbable
game-winning 3-pointer. Then, they danced on the
court as the band played a delirious rendition of
"All Right Now."
The older fans — the ones who paid admission
and had real seats and who usually rush out the
door in the closing seconds to beat the traffic —
stood and swayed and cheered for at least 15 min
utes as the band played on.
Chris Hernandez had tried to call timeout in
the seconds before Robinson's heave ripped
through the net but the referees didn't see him.
Several people suffered scratches and bruises in
the ensuing melee. The wife of Hall of Fame foot
ball quarterback Jim Plunkett reportedly got her
foot stuck in a chair, and ESPN.com's Andy Katz
reported that Tiger Woods and his fiancee tried to
help extricate her.
it wasn't the fact that Stanford had won that
made the scene so dramatic. The Cardinal had al
ready won 1 y other games this year. Stanford didn't
just beat Arizona - it beat the odds.
Playing without both starting forward Justin
Davis and his back-up. Matt Haryasz; with its best
shooter. Matt Lottich, missing every shot he took;
down by five points with just 44 seconds left in the
game; Josh Childress stepping to the line and miss
ing his first free throw.
"A couple Arizona guys mentioned that the
game was over when Josh was at the free-throw
line, which was a little bit of a slap in the face to me
when I'm out there trying to win a game on my
home court," center Rob Little said.
Slap Stanford's players in the face, and they are
likely to slap right back. Tell them the game is over,
and by the time it actually is over you'll probably re
gret your words.
"At some point they're just not afraid to lose, I
guess, so the issue is trying to win," said head coach
Mike Montgomery, trying to explain the mentality
that makes his team so indomitable.
Childress made his second free throw, of course,
and then hit a 3-pointer. And then came the steal by
Robinson and the fateful shot and the rushing of the

court that would be shown again and again on high
light shows Saturday night.
This 20th victory of Stanford's season was one
of several come-from-behind wins and was the
second one in which the Cardinal virtually came
back from the dead. At Oregon last weekend, the
Cardinal surmounted a 19-point second-half
deficit. On Saturday, it led for most of the game,
but survived a 14-0 Arizona run that would have
buried a lesser opponent.
"We could not stop them," Montgomery said of
the Wildcats' second-half surge. "[Salim]
Stoudamire in particular. Every time he seemed to
make it, and they were hitting floaters and threes."
Stanford's players have long insisted that their
offense is sparked by their strong defense. On Sat
urday in the second half, the converse was true: As
the Cardinal defense struggled to contain
Stoudamire and Arizona's other quick, slashing
guards and forwards, its offense sputtered.
Kicked balls. Errant passes. Ugly, off-balance
bricks as the shot clock wound down. Frustration
marked the Cardinal's unusually poor play on of
fense during the Arizona run, when Stanford failed
to score for more than seven minutes. The team ap
peared to be losing its composure for the first time
all season.
One problem was the mismatches. Stoudamire
was far too quick to be stopped by any one of Stan
ford's guards. Center Channing Frye was too
skilled on the perimeter to be guarded effectively
by Little, who is uncomfortable outside the paint.
Montgomery admitted after the game that a bit
of doubt and worry might have played a role, too.
"We got a little tentative on offense," Mont
gomery said. "We quit running our cuts."
But when it came down to the final minute, all
concerns were pushed aside as the Cardinal made
its final stand.
"We never lost hope, we never lost focus," said
Chris Hernandez, who shot 5-of-6 from the floor, 3-
of-4 from 3-point range and 7-of-7 from the line in
one of his best performances of the year.
Robinson, who is 24 years old, said maturity was
a factor.
"I feel this is a situation we've been in before as
a team," he said. "The game has its ups and downs,
and different teams will make different runs at dif-

ferent points."
And at the end of the game, it was Arizona that stumbled, turning the
ball over on consecutive possessions when Montgomery turned on a full
court press for the first time all game — a tactic Montgomery almost
never uses.
"They got a little tentative, trying not to lose," Montgomery said. "(The
press] was just what the doctor ordered."
To Arizona, which also lost in the final minute at California on Thurs
day, it was a prescription for disaster.
"As it happens so often in this series... it seems like most of them go
down to that last possession, and they made the plays that needed to be
made," Arizona head coach Lute Olson said. "They came up with two
steals on us when they needed to ... [Stanford] is a very mature club."
Maturity plus luck equaled another victory for Stanford, and the wildest
and most triumphant chapter yet in a storybook season.

Kicked balls. Errant passes. Ugly, off-balance
bricks as the shot clock wound down. Frustration
marked the Cardinal's unusually poor play on of
fense during the Arizona run, when Stanford failed
to score for more than seven minutes. The team ap
peared to be losing its composure for the first time
all season.
One problem was the mismatches. Stoudamire
was far too quick to be stopped by any one of Stan
ford's guards. Center Channing Frye was too
skilled on the perimeter to be guarded effectively
by Little, who is uncomfortable outside the paint.
Montgomery admitted after the game that a bit
of doubt and worry might have played a role, too.
"We got a little tentative on offense," Mont
gomery said. "We quit running our cuts."
But when it came down to the final minute, all
concerns were pushed aside as the Cardinal made
its final stand.
"We never lost hope, we never lost focus," said
Chris Hernandez, who shot 5-of-6 from the floor, 3-
of-4 from 3-point range and 7-of-7 from the line in
one of his best performances of the year.
Robinson, who is 24 years old, said maturity was
a factor.
"I feel this is a situation we've been in before as
a team," he said. "The game has its ups and downs,
and different teams will make different runs at dif-

ferent points."
And at the end of the game, it was Arizona that stumbled, turning the
ball over on consecutive possessions when Montgomery turned on a full
court press for the first time all game — a tactic Montgomery almost
never uses.
"They got a little tentative, trying not to lose," Montgomery said. "(The
press] was just what the doctor ordered."
To Arizona, which also lost in the final minute at California on Thurs
day, it was a prescription for disaster.
"As it happens so often in this series... it seems like most of them go
down to that last possession, and they made the plays that needed to be
made," Arizona head coach Lute Olson said. "They came up with two
steals on us when they needed to ... [Stanford] is a very mature club."
Maturity plus luck equaled another victory for Stanford, and the wildest
and most triumphant chapter yet in a storybook season.
When the game ended, the fans didn't leave.
First, they rushed out of the stands and piled on the
Stanford basketball team, which had piled on Nick
Robinson where he lay after hitting the improbable
game-winning 3-pointer. Then, they danced on the
court as the band played a delirious rendition of
"All Right Now."
The older fans — the ones who paid admission
and had real seats and who usually rush out the
door in the closing seconds to beat the traffic —
stood and swayed and cheered for at least 15 min
utes as the band played on.
Chris Hernandez had tried to call timeout in
the seconds before Robinson's heave ripped
through the net but the referees didn't see him.
Several people suffered scratches and bruises in
the ensuing melee. The wife of Hall of Fame foot
ball quarterback Jim Plunkett reportedly got her
foot stuck in a chair, and ESPN.com's Andy Katz
reported that Tiger Woods and his fiancee tried to
help extricate her.

down by five points with just 44 seconds left in the
game; Josh Childress stepping to the line and miss

"A couple Arizona guys mentioned that the
game was over when Josh was at the free-throw
line, which was a little bit of a slap in the face to me
when I'm out there trying to win a game on my
home court," center Rob Little said.
Slap Stanford's players in the face, and they are
likely to slap right back. Tell them the game is over,
and by the time it actually is over you'll probably re
gret your words.
"At some point they're just not afraid to lose, I
guess, so the issue is trying to win," said head coach
Mike Montgomery, trying to explain the mentality
that makes his team so indomitable.
Childress made his second free throw, of course,
and then hit a 3-pointer. And then came the steal by
Robinson and the fateful shot and the rushing of the

court that would be shown again and again on high
light shows Saturday night.
This 20th victory of Stanford's season was one
of several come-from-behind wins and was the
second one in which the Cardinal virtually came
back from the dead. At Oregon last weekend, the
Cardinal surmounted a 19-point second-half
deficit. On Saturday, it led for most of the game,
but survived a 14-0 Arizona run that would have
buried a lesser opponent.
"We could not stop them," Montgomery said of
the Wildcats' second-half surge. "[Salim]
Stoudamire in particular. Every time he seemed to
make it, and they were hitting floaters and threes."
