# Women lose by 20 points to Arizona State in Tempe
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
After Arizona State (15-6, 9-3 Pacific-10 Conference) flat
out manhandled the No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
(17-5, 10-3), 73-53, in an astounding 30-point second half
turnaround on Saturday, Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer put things as only she could.
"Our second half was an absolute melt-down," she said.
"There didn't seem to be anything that we did right."
The numbers say the same thing. In the second half, the Car
dinal had 11 turnovers, was out-rebounded 28-25, hit just six
field goals and shot a stunning 16.2 percent from the field. Stan
ford, the best three-point shooting team in the conference, by
both percentage and number made, was just 2-of-25 for the
game.
And that's just the beginning of the bad news for Stanford.

When polls come out on Monday, the Cardinal will have most
likely lost its place among the nation's top 10, and won't see its
name atop the Pac-10 leaderboard for the first time this season,
and the fear that once struck the heart of Stanford's opponents
will most likely be gone.
Playing against a team whose most prolific scorer boasts an
average of just 11.3 points per game, the Cardinal, as the con
ference's best defensive team, seemed to have a distinct advan
tage — and for 20 minutes Stanford played like the team it was
billed as.
The Cardinal played inspired defense — getting in the face
of Sun Devil shooters and ball-handlers, clogging up passing
lanes and ultimately coming up with five first half steals while
holding Arizona State to just 20.7 percent shooting from the
field.
And while Stanford didn't have its best offensive showing, it
was by no means its worst. Scoring was relatively balanced —

senior guard / forward Nicole Powell and junior forward Azel
la Perrynian led the way with eight points apiece — and the
team shot a more-than-respectable 12-of-25 from the field.
When the Cardinal left the floor with a 28-18 halftime ad
vantage, it looked as if it were on a mission to avenge Thursday's
88-83 loss to Arizona.
However, the team that entered the locker room with a dou
ble-digit lead was nowhere to be found in the second half — and
the Sun Devils sensed it.
"Nicole Powell had a look on her face that said "Oh no,
what's happening?"' said Sun Devil freshman forward Emily
Westerberg, who had a career-day with 16 points and eight re
bounds. "That's when we knew. They had a look in their eyes
— they were scared."
Arizona State capitalized, going on a nine-minute, 27-5 run
that started with 12:02 left to play. Over
that stretch, the Cardinal didn't convert
a single field goal and committed five
turnovers.
As the clock wound down from 9:16
to 5:46, Stanford committed four con
secutive turnovers and was unable to at
tempt even one field goal.
And when the Cardinal did manage
to get shots off, those shots were off the
mark. It missed countless layups, wide
open treys and an endless string of
jumpers.
In her final homecoming, the usual
ly-consistent Powell didn't hit a second
half field goal until there was just 1:49
left on the clock and the Cardinal was
already down by 18. And while she still
finished with 22 points and 15 re
bounds, 10 of those points came trom

the charity stripe, where she is nearly
automatic.
For the Cardinal, Saturday's game
was yet another example of what is be
coming a disturbing trend. In three of its
five losses, Stanford has held a substan
tial lead early in the second half, only to
be out-worked and, in the end, out
played.
"1 think that hustle is an issue. I think
determination, perseverance, playing
hard. I think that is an issue," Van-
Derveer said. "We need to be more
competitive."
The disastrous weekend has put the
Cardinal at what VanDerveer called a
"crossroads" in its season. Stanford has
three weeks remaining in regular-sea
son conference play to regroup and try
to regain some of the momentum it had
going into the season, when it was one
of the handful of teams expected to
compete for the national title.
The Cardinal's first shot at rebound
ing will be this Saturday at 2 p.m., when
it faces struggling California at Maples
Pavilion.

Cardinal at what VanDerveer called a
"crossroads" in its season. Stanford has
three weeks remaining in regular-sea
son conference play to regroup and try
to regain some of the momentum it had
going into the season, when it was one
of the handful of teams expected to
compete for the national title.
The Cardinal's first shot at rebound
ing will be this Saturday at 2 p.m., when
it faces struggling California at Maples
Pavilion.
After Arizona State (15-6, 9-3 Pacific-10 Conference) flat
out manhandled the No. 7 Stanford women's basketball team
(17-5, 10-3), 73-53, in an astounding 30-point second half
turnaround on Saturday, Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer put things as only she could.
"Our second half was an absolute melt-down," she said.
"There didn't seem to be anything that we did right."
The numbers say the same thing. In the second half, the Car
dinal had 11 turnovers, was out-rebounded 28-25, hit just six
field goals and shot a stunning 16.2 percent from the field. Stan
ford, the best three-point shooting team in the conference, by
both percentage and number made, was just 2-of-25 for the
game.
And that's just the beginning of the bad news for Stanford.

When polls come out on Monday, the Cardinal will have most
likely lost its place among the nation's top 10, and won't see its
name atop the Pac-10 leaderboard for the first time this season,
and the fear that once struck the heart of Stanford's opponents
will most likely be gone.
Playing against a team whose most prolific scorer boasts an
average of just 11.3 points per game, the Cardinal, as the con
ference's best defensive team, seemed to have a distinct advan
tage — and for 20 minutes Stanford played like the team it was
billed as.
The Cardinal played inspired defense — getting in the face
of Sun Devil shooters and ball-handlers, clogging up passing
lanes and ultimately coming up with five first half steals while
holding Arizona State to just 20.7 percent shooting from the
field.
And while Stanford didn't have its best offensive showing, it
was by no means its worst. Scoring was relatively balanced —

senior guard / forward Nicole Powell and junior forward Azel
la Perrynian led the way with eight points apiece — and the
team shot a more-than-respectable 12-of-25 from the field.
When the Cardinal left the floor with a 28-18 halftime ad
vantage, it looked as if it were on a mission to avenge Thursday's
88-83 loss to Arizona.
However, the team that entered the locker room with a dou
ble-digit lead was nowhere to be found in the second half — and
the Sun Devils sensed it.
"Nicole Powell had a look on her face that said "Oh no,
what's happening?"' said Sun Devil freshman forward Emily
Westerberg, who had a career-day with 16 points and eight re
bounds. "That's when we knew. They had a look in their eyes
— they were scared."
Arizona State capitalized, going on a nine-minute, 27-5 run
that started with 12:02 left to play. Over
that stretch, the Cardinal didn't convert
a single field goal and committed five
turnovers.
As the clock wound down from 9:16
to 5:46, Stanford committed four con
secutive turnovers and was unable to at
tempt even one field goal.
And when the Cardinal did manage
to get shots off, those shots were off the
mark. It missed countless layups, wide
open treys and an endless string of
jumpers.
In her final homecoming, the usual
ly-consistent Powell didn't hit a second
half field goal until there was just 1:49
left on the clock and the Cardinal was
already down by 18. And while she still
finished with 22 points and 15 re
bounds, 10 of those points came trom

the charity stripe, where she is nearly
automatic.
For the Cardinal, Saturday's game
was yet another example of what is be
coming a disturbing trend. In three of its
five losses, Stanford has held a substan
tial lead early in the second half, only to
be out-worked and, in the end, out
played.
"1 think that hustle is an issue. I think
determination, perseverance, playing
hard. I think that is an issue," Van-
Derveer said. "We need to be more
competitive."
The disastrous weekend has put the
Cardinal at what VanDerveer called a
"crossroads" in its season. Stanford has
three weeks remaining in regular-sea
son conference play to regroup and try
to regain some of the momentum it had
going into the season, when it was one
of the handful of teams expected to
compete for the national title.
The Cardinal's first shot at rebound
ing will be this Saturday at 2 p.m., when
it faces struggling California at Maples
Pavilion.
