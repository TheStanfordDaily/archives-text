# Card wins series 2-1 over Fresno St.
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
After piling up 28 runs in the Fullerton series last
weekend, the Stanford offense looked like they would
keep on rumbling Friday when they faced soft-serving
Fresno State lefty David Griffin, whose fastball tops
out around 80 mph.
As it turns out, they might have wanted to save a
few of those 28 runs to use against Griffin. He held the
No. 4 Cardinal to just one unearned run and two hits —
Stanford's lowest hit total since (JSC pitcher Barry
Zito held them to two in a 1999 Super Regional game.
That's right — Barry Zito. Oakland A's pitcher
and former Cy Young Award winner, another soft
tossing lefty. It's been a long time since a pitcher threw
as dominant a game against the Cardinal.
Griffin's performance gave the Bulldogs a 3-1 vic
tory but, needless to say, Stanford's offense didn't stay
dormant for long, exploding for 14 hits and five home
runs on Saturday to win. 13-4. and racking up 16 base
knocks on Sunday to win. 10-4.
The Cardinal pitching staff had a number of strong
performances for the second weekend in a row, giving
up only 10 runs in the three-game series.
"I was happy with the way the series went, espe
cially after we lost the first one," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "I was pleased with the way we
came back."
Sophomore Mark Romanczuk started for the Car
dinal on Friday night and kept the game scoreless until
the fifth, when Fresno State got a pair of runs. After
Romanczuk hit a batter. No. 9 hitter Nick Moresi dou
bled down the left-field line. The next hitter, Ryan
Haag, slapped a grounder up the middle that was just
out of the reach of diving shortstop Jed Lowrie. Both
runners came around to score.
The Bulldogs tacked on an insurance run in the
sixth when Tom Shannon drilled a home run over the
left-field scoreboard.
Stanford's struggles at the plate on Friday made it
all the more important for the offense to capitalize on
the scant opportunities it had, but the team failed to

succeed on a couple of crucial scoring chances. In the
fourth, left fielder Danny Putnam was thrown out at
second on an attempted double steal. An inning later,
the Cardinal threatened again when John Mayberry
Jr. hit a leadoff double off the very top of the left-field
wall and advanced to third on a groundout, but the of
fense failed to plate him.
They didn't get many other opportunities.
"[Griffin| pitched very well, you have to give him
credit," Marquess said. "He kept our hitters off-bal
ance,"
Stanford scored an unearned run in the eighth, but
Fresno reliever Michael Cooper got Putnam, Lowrie
and Mayberry Jr. in the ninth to hand the Cardinal its
first loss of the year.
Stanford senior Drew Ehriich pitched 2 2/3 score
less innings in relief of Romanczuk. Ehriich got out of
a first-and-third jam in the bottom of the seventh by
striking out the side, but he didn't get much support
from the offense in the last three innings.
Saturday was a whole new ballgame. Stanford ham
mered five home runs, two by first baseman Mayberry
Jr., the first multiple-homer game of his career. Lowrie
also homered and drove in four runs. Putnam, who
went 7-for-13 in the series with three RBI, and desig
nated hitter Chris Carter went deep for the Cardinal as
well. •
Marquess called the heart of the order — Mayber
ry Jr., Lowrie and Putnam — "unbelievable." The trio
triggered Stanford's oflensive surge, combining to go
a phenomenal 17-for-26 with four home runs and 10
RBI in the final two games of the series.
"We were much more competitive as a team as far
as our hitting was concerned in the final two games,"
Mayberry Jr. said. "We're a good offense, and we just
did what we had to do. There were a lot of individual
players who made adjustments."
Sophomore hurler Jeff Gilniore got his first career
win in a dominant six-inning start, allowing two
earned runs and posting a career-high eight strikeouts.

Sophomore Matt Monship pitches the ball. The Cardinal won 2-1 in
a series against Fresno State.
Freshman Blake Holler had anoth
er impressive outing, closing out
the game to nail down his second
save in as many opportunities.
Holler allowed one run in three in
nings and struck out two to pre
serve the 13-4 victory.
Sunday's rubber game got off to
a rockier start.
Junior Mark Jecmen got the call
to start because of his strong outing
last Sunday against Fullerton, in
which he allowed just one run in
five innings.
Yesterday, though, he looked
shaky from the get-go and had trou
ble locating the ball. Jecmen gave
up consecutive singles to start the
first inning, walked the bases load
ed and then walked in a run. Fresno
third baseman Christian Vitters hit
a blooper behind second base to
put another run on the board, and
Jecmen was relieved by senior
David O'Hagan before an out was
recorded.
O'Hagan stopped the rally,
striking out the final two batters
after a run came across on a sacri
fice fly. O'Hagan, who has never
started, went on to throw a gem,
pitching a career-high six shutout
innings, allowing four hits and
striking out eight. It was a key
performance from a player who
was not expecting to throw a
starter's innings.

"He was the highlight of the day,
as far as I'm concerned," Marquess
said. "We don't usually count on
him to go that long, and he did just
a great job."
Stanford struck back to take the
lead with five runs in the top of the
third.
Catcher Donny Lucy led off
with a double and came around to
score three batters later on a
bases-loaded single by third base
man Johnny Ash. Lowrie hit a
grounder to first, and Fresno first
baseman Kyle Wilson overthrew
the second baseman trying to start
a double play.
Two runs scored, and Putnam,
the next batter, singled in Ash.
Lowrie came around to score on a
passed ball later in the inning.
Stanford tacked on three more
in the fifth inning, highlighted by a
double by Putnam off of the top of
the wall in deep center. The Cardi
nal scored again in the seventh on
senior Sam Fuld's two-run single to
center.
Sophomores Kodiak Quick and
Matt Manship combined for three
scoreless innings of relief to seal the
10-3 win.
Not even Marquess could ex
plain the difference in the Cardi
nal's offensive output on Friday
and in the final two games.
"I wish I knew," he said. "Who
knows what the difference was? A
lot of times it's contagious, where a
couple of guys start hitting well and
everybody swings the bat better."
The Cardinal will try to come
out swinging next weekend, when
the team faces Kansas at Sunken
Diamond.

fourth, left fielder Danny Putnam was thrown out at
second on an attempted double steal. An inning later,
the Cardinal threatened again when John Mayberry
Jr. hit a leadoff double off the very top of the left-field
wall and advanced to third on a groundout, but the of
fense failed to plate him.
They didn't get many other opportunities.
"[Griffin| pitched very well, you have to give him
credit," Marquess said. "He kept our hitters off-bal
ance,"
Stanford scored an unearned run in the eighth, but
Fresno reliever Michael Cooper got Putnam, Lowrie
and Mayberry Jr. in the ninth to hand the Cardinal its
first loss of the year.
Stanford senior Drew Ehriich pitched 2 2/3 score
less innings in relief of Romanczuk. Ehriich got out of
a first-and-third jam in the bottom of the seventh by
striking out the side, but he didn't get much support
from the offense in the last three innings.
Saturday was a whole new ballgame. Stanford ham
mered five home runs, two by first baseman Mayberry
Jr., the first multiple-homer game of his career. Lowrie
also homered and drove in four runs. Putnam, who
went 7-for-13 in the series with three RBI, and desig
nated hitter Chris Carter went deep for the Cardinal as
well. •
Marquess called the heart of the order — Mayber
ry Jr., Lowrie and Putnam — "unbelievable." The trio
triggered Stanford's oflensive surge, combining to go
a phenomenal 17-for-26 with four home runs and 10
RBI in the final two games of the series.
"We were much more competitive as a team as far
as our hitting was concerned in the final two games,"
Mayberry Jr. said. "We're a good offense, and we just
did what we had to do. There were a lot of individual
players who made adjustments."
Sophomore hurler Jeff Gilniore got his first career
win in a dominant six-inning start, allowing two
earned runs and posting a career-high eight strikeouts.

Sophomore Matt Monship pitches the ball. The Cardinal won 2-1 in
a series against Fresno State.
Freshman Blake Holler had anoth
er impressive outing, closing out
the game to nail down his second
save in as many opportunities.
Holler allowed one run in three in
nings and struck out two to pre
serve the 13-4 victory.
Sunday's rubber game got off to
a rockier start.
Junior Mark Jecmen got the call
to start because of his strong outing
last Sunday against Fullerton, in
which he allowed just one run in
five innings.
Yesterday, though, he looked
shaky from the get-go and had trou
ble locating the ball. Jecmen gave
up consecutive singles to start the
first inning, walked the bases load
ed and then walked in a run. Fresno
third baseman Christian Vitters hit
a blooper behind second base to
put another run on the board, and
Jecmen was relieved by senior
David O'Hagan before an out was
recorded.
O'Hagan stopped the rally,
striking out the final two batters
after a run came across on a sacri
fice fly. O'Hagan, who has never
started, went on to throw a gem,
pitching a career-high six shutout
innings, allowing four hits and
striking out eight. It was a key
performance from a player who
was not expecting to throw a
starter's innings.

"He was the highlight of the day,
as far as I'm concerned," Marquess
said. "We don't usually count on
him to go that long, and he did just
a great job."
Stanford struck back to take the
lead with five runs in the top of the
third.
Catcher Donny Lucy led off
with a double and came around to
score three batters later on a
bases-loaded single by third base
man Johnny Ash. Lowrie hit a
grounder to first, and Fresno first
baseman Kyle Wilson overthrew
the second baseman trying to start
a double play.
Two runs scored, and Putnam,
the next batter, singled in Ash.
Lowrie came around to score on a
passed ball later in the inning.
Stanford tacked on three more
in the fifth inning, highlighted by a
double by Putnam off of the top of
the wall in deep center. The Cardi
nal scored again in the seventh on
senior Sam Fuld's two-run single to
center.
Sophomores Kodiak Quick and
Matt Manship combined for three
scoreless innings of relief to seal the
10-3 win.
Not even Marquess could ex
plain the difference in the Cardi
nal's offensive output on Friday
and in the final two games.
"I wish I knew," he said. "Who
knows what the difference was? A
lot of times it's contagious, where a
couple of guys start hitting well and
everybody swings the bat better."
The Cardinal will try to come
out swinging next weekend, when
the team faces Kansas at Sunken
Diamond.

Junior forward Azella Perryman takes fhe ball up strong in a game against
Washington earlier this season. Despite Perryman s efforts this weekend, how
ever, the Cardinal lost to both Arizona and Arizona State on the road.
After piling up 28 runs in the Fullerton series last
weekend, the Stanford offense looked like they would
keep on rumbling Friday when they faced soft-serving
Fresno State lefty David Griffin, whose fastball tops
out around 80 mph.
As it turns out, they might have wanted to save a
few of those 28 runs to use against Griffin. He held the
No. 4 Cardinal to just one unearned run and two hits —
Stanford's lowest hit total since (JSC pitcher Barry
Zito held them to two in a 1999 Super Regional game.
That's right — Barry Zito. Oakland A's pitcher
and former Cy Young Award winner, another soft
tossing lefty. It's been a long time since a pitcher threw
as dominant a game against the Cardinal.
Griffin's performance gave the Bulldogs a 3-1 vic
tory but, needless to say, Stanford's offense didn't stay
dormant for long, exploding for 14 hits and five home
runs on Saturday to win. 13-4. and racking up 16 base
knocks on Sunday to win. 10-4.
The Cardinal pitching staff had a number of strong
performances for the second weekend in a row, giving
up only 10 runs in the three-game series.
"I was happy with the way the series went, espe
cially after we lost the first one," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "I was pleased with the way we
came back."
Sophomore Mark Romanczuk started for the Car
dinal on Friday night and kept the game scoreless until
the fifth, when Fresno State got a pair of runs. After
Romanczuk hit a batter. No. 9 hitter Nick Moresi dou
bled down the left-field line. The next hitter, Ryan
Haag, slapped a grounder up the middle that was just
out of the reach of diving shortstop Jed Lowrie. Both
runners came around to score.
The Bulldogs tacked on an insurance run in the
sixth when Tom Shannon drilled a home run over the
left-field scoreboard.
Stanford's struggles at the plate on Friday made it
all the more important for the offense to capitalize on
the scant opportunities it had, but the team failed to

succeed on a couple of crucial scoring chances. In the
