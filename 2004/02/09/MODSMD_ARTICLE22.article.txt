# Card wins series 2-1 over Fresno St.
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
After piling up 28 runs in the Fullerton series last
weekend, the Stanford offense looked like they would
keep on rumbling Friday when they faced soft-serving
Fresno State lefty David Griffin, whose fastball tops
out around 80 mph.
As it turns out, they might have wanted to save a
few of those 28 runs to use against Griffin. He held the
No. 4 Cardinal to just one unearned run and two hits —
Stanford's lowest hit total since (JSC pitcher Barry
Zito held them to two in a 1999 Super Regional game.
That's right — Barry Zito. Oakland A's pitcher
and former Cy Young Award winner, another soft
tossing lefty. It's been a long time since a pitcher threw
as dominant a game against the Cardinal.
Griffin's performance gave the Bulldogs a 3-1 vic
tory but, needless to say, Stanford's offense didn't stay
dormant for long, exploding for 14 hits and five home
runs on Saturday to win. 13-4. and racking up 16 base
knocks on Sunday to win. 10-4.
The Cardinal pitching staff had a number of strong
performances for the second weekend in a row, giving
up only 10 runs in the three-game series.
"I was happy with the way the series went, espe
cially after we lost the first one," Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess said. "I was pleased with the way we
came back."
Sophomore Mark Romanczuk started for the Car
dinal on Friday night and kept the game scoreless until
the fifth, when Fresno State got a pair of runs. After
Romanczuk hit a batter. No. 9 hitter Nick Moresi dou
bled down the left-field line. The next hitter, Ryan
Haag, slapped a grounder up the middle that was just
out of the reach of diving shortstop Jed Lowrie. Both
runners came around to score.
The Bulldogs tacked on an insurance run in the
sixth when Tom Shannon drilled a home run over the
left-field scoreboard.
Stanford's struggles at the plate on Friday made it
all the more important for the offense to capitalize on
the scant opportunities it had, but the team failed to

succeed on a couple of crucial scoring chances. In the
fourth, left fielder Danny Putnam was thrown out at
second on an attempted double steal. An inning later,
the Cardinal threatened again when John Mayberry
Jr. hit a leadoff double off the very top of the left-field
wall and advanced to third on a groundout, but the of
fense failed to plate him.
They didn't get many other opportunities.
"[Griffin| pitched very well, you have to give him
credit," Marquess said. "He kept our hitters off-bal
ance,"
Stanford scored an unearned run in the eighth, but
Fresno reliever Michael Cooper got Putnam, Lowrie
and Mayberry Jr. in the ninth to hand the Cardinal its
first loss of the year.
Stanford senior Drew Ehriich pitched 2 2/3 score
less innings in relief of Romanczuk. Ehriich got out of
a first-and-third jam in the bottom of the seventh by
striking out the side, but he didn't get much support
from the offense in the last three innings.
Saturday was a whole new ballgame. Stanford ham
mered five home runs, two by first baseman Mayberry
Jr., the first multiple-homer game of his career. Lowrie
also homered and drove in four runs. Putnam, who
went 7-for-13 in the series with three RBI, and desig
nated hitter Chris Carter went deep for the Cardinal as
well. •
Marquess called the heart of the order — Mayber
ry Jr., Lowrie and Putnam — "unbelievable." The trio
triggered Stanford's oflensive surge, combining to go
a phenomenal 17-for-26 with four home runs and 10
RBI in the final two games of the series.
"We were much more competitive as a team as far
as our hitting was concerned in the final two games,"
Mayberry Jr. said. "We're a good offense, and we just
did what we had to do. There were a lot of individual
players who made adjustments."
Sophomore hurler Jeff Gilniore got his first career
win in a dominant six-inning start, allowing two
earned runs and posting a career-high eight strikeouts.
