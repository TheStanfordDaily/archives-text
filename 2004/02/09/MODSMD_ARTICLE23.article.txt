# Men's volleyball loses to No. 2 Pepperdine and unranked USC
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team (5-7, 3-5 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) sulfered two losses from fairly differ
ent opponents last week, losing 3-1 to Southern California on
Thursday and then to Pepperdine 3-0 on Saturday. The win
over the Cardinal marked the first conference victory for the
unranked Trojans, while then-No. 2 Pepperdine (7-2, 3-2) has
only dropped two matches this season.
In the matchup against USC (2-8, 1-5), Stanford saw stellar
play from former bench-warmer and setter turned starting out
side hitter, junior Patrick Bomhack, who posted 17 kills to lead
the Cardinal offensive. Junior outside hitter David Vogel
recorded 13 kills, but the double-digit hitting efforts were not
enough to claim a Stanford win.
The teams were tied at 23 before USC went on a 5-0 run to
close out game one by four points, and Stanford was even able
to take game two, 30-26. But the Trojans would claim game
three 30-21 and decide the match in game four, 30-26. Cardinal
coach Dawn Shaw said IJSC's new rotation throughout the
match surprised Stanford and resulted in a face off the Cardi
nal did not expect.
"They came out with a little bit of a different line-up," Shaw
said. "They ended up with better ball control, better passing,
[and] they were very quick."
Against a weak-blocking team like Stanford, Shaw ex
plained, the change worked well.
"It was a good matchup for them against us," he said.
Two nights later, the Cardinal faced a very different team,
Pepperdine, at Firestone Fieldhouse, a place junior setter
Kevin Hansen noted had historically been a difficult venue for
the Cardinal.
"It's really difficult to play down there," he said. "We've
struggled there in the past."
Though Hansen notched team highs of 37 assists and 11

digs, it was not enough to lift Stanford past the two players
Hansen and Vogel predicted would be a challenge for the Car
dinal.
As assumed, junior outside hitter Sean Rooney posted a
match-high 17 kills while senior outside hitter Fred Winters
recorded 14. In spite of the All-Americans' stunning play, the
Stanford effort resulted in close matches in two of the three
games, as the Waves defeated the Cardinal 30-27, 30-21,30-27.
Shaw spoke highly of his team's showing, in spite of the final
results.
"I felt the effort and the execution was very good," he said.
But it wasn't quite good enough to overcome Winters and
Rooney.
"The difference in game one was Sean Rooney," Shaw said.
"He carried the load."
Rooney posted 11 of his total 17 kills in game one alone.
Even after Stanford took the lead at 16-12, Rooney was a su
perb one-man show that the Cardinal could not defend against.
In game two, Stanford again proved it could hang with Pep
perdine, and was able to tie the score at 13. But the Cardinal
gave up a 15-6 run to lose the second game more handily, 30-
21, in a contest that Shaw saw as a factor of serve-receive.
"We didn't pass very well and that got us in trouble," he
said.
In the final game, though, Stanford took an 11-10 lead off a
kill by sophomore outside hitter Ben Reddy, who lead the Car
dinal attack with 15 kills.
After a kill by Hansen, which gave the Cardinal a 16-15
edge, the teams exchanged points. A Pepperdine setting error
evened the score at 27, but a three point Wave run closed out
the game and the match at 30-27. It was a victory again credit
ed largely to the Pepperdine Ail-American duo.
"[Rooney and Winters] controlled the match," Shaw said.
Stanford will have a chance to control its own matches and
snap the two-game losing streak when it takes on Hawaii this
Friday and Saturday in Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.

recorded 14. In spite of the All-Americans' stunning play, the
Stanford effort resulted in close matches in two of the three
games, as the Waves defeated the Cardinal 30-27, 30-21,30-27.
Shaw spoke highly of his team's showing, in spite of the final
results.
"I felt the effort and the execution was very good," he said.
But it wasn't quite good enough to overcome Winters and
Rooney.
"The difference in game one was Sean Rooney," Shaw said.
"He carried the load."
Rooney posted 11 of his total 17 kills in game one alone.
Even after Stanford took the lead at 16-12, Rooney was a su
perb one-man show that the Cardinal could not defend against.
In game two, Stanford again proved it could hang with Pep
perdine, and was able to tie the score at 13. But the Cardinal
gave up a 15-6 run to lose the second game more handily, 30-
21, in a contest that Shaw saw as a factor of serve-receive.
"We didn't pass very well and that got us in trouble," he
said.
In the final game, though, Stanford took an 11-10 lead off a
kill by sophomore outside hitter Ben Reddy, who lead the Car
dinal attack with 15 kills.
After a kill by Hansen, which gave the Cardinal a 16-15
edge, the teams exchanged points. A Pepperdine setting error
evened the score at 27, but a three point Wave run closed out
the game and the match at 30-27. It was a victory again credit
ed largely to the Pepperdine Ail-American duo.
"[Rooney and Winters] controlled the match," Shaw said.
Stanford will have a chance to control its own matches and
snap the two-game losing streak when it takes on Hawaii this
Friday and Saturday in Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.
