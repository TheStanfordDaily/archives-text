# Muslim scholars discuss reconciliation of West and Islam
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two well-known Muslim scholars called for bringing the
West and the Muslim world closer together in a overfilled
lecture last night. Shaykh Hamza Yusuf and Imam Zaid
Shakir spoke on Islam's role in the future of the United
States and the rest of the world. Y usuf and Shakir, both con
verts to Islam, teach at the Zaytuna Institute in Hayward
and lecture across the country.
Yusuf stressed the need for reconciliation between East
and West.
"One side allows its perceptions to cloud the truth and
vice versa," he said. "Setting aside these stereotypes is our
challenge. Prejudice is deeply rooted and we have a lot of
work ahead of us to change this. I believe that truth must
prevail over tribe or nation and that Muslims today must be
shining examples of the possibilities of Islam."
Shakir invoked the need for Islam as a way to promote a
better lifestyle and to better man's destiny.

"There needs to he a hasis for the common brotherhood
of man, and Islam can provide this basis," he said. "Morali
ty is lacking in today's world, replaced by political and eco
nomic powers. Islam provides socially relevant behavior
that can raise the moral standards of society."
Yusuf pointed out that though Islam provides a frame
work, people still need true belief if Islam is to influence the
destiny of man, which was the theme of the talk.
"Islam is deeply rooted in the idea that man does have a
destiny and a humanity," he said. "Muslims are ostensibly
one out of every five people in the world, yet obviously this
is because they are born in a Muslim region. Similarly, the
majority of Americans are Christian because they were
born Christian."
Yusuf then went on to detail what he called "the problem
of conviction" when one born into a specific religion.
"In the words of a famous Muslim scholar, true faith
must be grounded on sound conviction," he said. "There are
very few people who are brave enough to doubt their own
faith and convictions. But it is not easy tochallenge someone

who has thought deeply about his beliefs."
Shakir concluded by stating the importance of respecting
the Earth and the sacredness of life in order to secure a pos
itive future.
"In the past century, 170 million people were killed in po
litically motivated slaughter, many of them civilians," he
said. "We, Muslims and non-Muslims, are not immune to
this from happening again. We must work hard as a human
family to prevent any more slaughter from happening in this
new century. Islam has a history of tolerance and co-exis
tence that we must bring back and build on to restore the
balance and have a better future."
The lecture, sponsored by the Islamic Society of Stan
ford University and the Zaytuna Institute, was entitled
"Islam and the Destiny of Man: Meditations on the Modern
Condition." It was a presentation of the Zaytuna Contem
porary Lecture Series, a series of lectures on Islam in rela
tion to current topics and philosophies.
Sophomore Mohammad Subeh commented on the
ideas presented in the lecture.

"Both scholars shed light on the present and future glob
al impacts of the misconceptions about the Muslim world
prevalent today in Western societies," he said. "Tonights
lecture provoked a sense of self-reflection within me, from
which I began to think more deeply into the importance of
creating a world-wide moral and ethical collective con
science."
Senior Imran Moinuddin discussed the role Islam and
Muslims play in relation to the Stanford community.
"I walked away from the talk feeling that Muslims need
to do more to make their ideology and faith known," he
said. "We have to teach the entire Stanford community and
beyond about what binds over a billion people worldwide
and about the cultuie in which they take such pride."
Junior Mabrookah Heneidi, the moderator, also de
scribed the benefits of Islam on campus.
"Islam has a very rich academic and scholarly back
ground that is not often discussed in western circles," she
said. "It explores humanity in a holistic way that could real
ly benefit the academia at Stanford."
