They rushed the court at

Maples Pavilion on Satur-

day.

Hands waving,

feet stomping, girls

crying, the Stan-

ford Sixth Man

Club jumped up

and down on

those bouncy

floors like it
never had
before, like
it never
would again.

Inreali-

ty, that post-

game rush on

those particu-

lar bouncy

floors, after ju-

nior forward

Nick Robinson

hit a 32-foot game

winner over Ari-

zona's Andre Iguo-

dala, might just have

been the Sixth Man Club's

last bounce (the floors are

being replaced this spring as a part

of the Maples renovation).

But nobody's talking about that right now

For the moment, they're already calling this one a
classic. Already ... already marking it down in the
history books as one of the most entertaining and in
triguing collegiate games of all time.
And, really, it was all of that â€” every gut-wrench
ing, heart-pounding, hair-pulling bit of No. 2 Stan
ford's (20-0, 11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win
over No. 12 Arizona (14-6,6-5) on Saturday lived up
to that billing.
From the opening 20 minutes, when Stanford
rushed to a 13-point lead off 56.5 percent shooting
from the field to the closing seconds of that first half
when Arizona guard Salim Stoudamire hit a run
ning three-pointer to close the Wildcat deficit to
nine points.
And the drama continued into the second period
as well, from the seven-minute, 14-0 Arizona run that
culminated with a Channing Frye slam dunk that
gave the Wildcats a 72-67 lead to the final breathtak
ing minute, when Stanford overcame a four-point
deficit to beat Arizona at the buzzer on Robinson's
desperation shot.
"I'm starting to think this group might be some
thing special," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said, "That was just an unbelievable
game."
