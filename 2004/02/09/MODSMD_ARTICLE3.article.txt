They rushed the court at

Maples Pavilion on Satur-

day.

Hands waving,

feet stomping, girls

crying, the Stan-

ford Sixth Man

Club jumped up

and down on

those bouncy

floors like it
never had
before, like
it never
would again.

Inreali-

ty, that post-

game rush on

those particu-

lar bouncy

floors, after ju-

nior forward

Nick Robinson

hit a 32-foot game

winner over Ari-

zona's Andre Iguo-

dala, might just have

been the Sixth Man Club's

last bounce (the floors are

being replaced this spring as a part

of the Maples renovation).

But nobody's talking about that right now

For the moment, they're already calling this one a
classic. Already ... already marking it down in the
history books as one of the most entertaining and in
triguing collegiate games of all time.
And, really, it was all of that — every gut-wrench
ing, heart-pounding, hair-pulling bit of No. 2 Stan
ford's (20-0, 11-0 Pacific-10 Conference) 80-77 win
over No. 12 Arizona (14-6,6-5) on Saturday lived up
to that billing.
From the opening 20 minutes, when Stanford
rushed to a 13-point lead off 56.5 percent shooting
from the field to the closing seconds of that first half
when Arizona guard Salim Stoudamire hit a run
ning three-pointer to close the Wildcat deficit to
nine points.
And the drama continued into the second period
as well, from the seven-minute, 14-0 Arizona run that
culminated with a Channing Frye slam dunk that
gave the Wildcats a 72-67 lead to the final breathtak
ing minute, when Stanford overcame a four-point
deficit to beat Arizona at the buzzer on Robinson's
desperation shot.
"I'm starting to think this group might be some
thing special," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said, "That was just an unbelievable
game."


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Junior forward Nick Robinson hit a 35-foot tfiree-pointer to beat No. 12 Arizona at the buzzer on Saturday.
But this unbelievable?
This special?
It was clear from the get-go that
this was Stanford's game to lose —
the streak on the line, the No. 2 na
tional ranking — as it faced off
against an Arizona team that has
struggled as of late.
And the game, itself, was
wrought with that same sense of
tension.
It couldn't have been more
back-and-forth.
The Cardinal clearly dominated
the opening minutes, rushing to a
14-4 lead, a run which included a
two-minute period where Stanford
guards Chris Hernandez and Matt
Lottich took turns knocking down
shot after shot.
Hernandez hit a three-pointer
off the dribble. Then Lottich came
off a screen to hit a three. Next he
hit an off-balance baseline pull-up
jumper, which was followed closely
by a Hernandez steal and a coast
to-coast fastbreak layup over 6-
foot-11 Frye.
The second half, on the other
hand, was the complete opposite.
Still reeling from Stoudamire's last
second three-pointer, which closed
Arizona's halftime deficit to nine,
the Wildcats quickly closed the gap.
Arizona got hot.
Stoudamire spun around twice
and converted a one-handed
floater over Lottich, scoring the
third and fourth points in a 14-0
Wildcat run that was accentuated
by a cold Stanford shooting spell.
"[Arizona] shot 60 percent in
the second half," Montgomery
said. "We couldn't guard them.
We couldn't run our offense.
Every time we made a mistake
they capitalized."
But all of that only made the
game's final play seem more amaz
ing, more unexpected, more indica
tive of the seeming tenacity of this
Stanford team.
"Our guys might have been fear
ful of losing, but at some point, they
couldn't be afraid to lose and just
tried to do what it (takes) to win,"
Montgomery said.

Which brings us back to that
memorable ending.
With 44 seconds left on the
clock, Arizona forward Hassan
Adams put Childress on the line.
Childress missed the first and hit
the second, bringing Stanford with
in three points, 77-74.
Next, Lottich stole the ball from
Arizona's freshman point guard,
Mustafa Shakur. and Hernandez
found Childress floating around the
perimeter fora wide-open three
pointer, which Childress nailed.
Tie game.
After a timeout, Arizona in
bounded the ball and Stoudamire
dribbled it up court, guarded close
ly by Lottich. While trying to utilize
a high screen from Frye,
Stoudamire found himself sur
prised by a Stanford triple team —
which Iguodala inadvertently initi
ated by running his man, Nick
Robinson, directly into the play.
The ball came loose and found
its way to Robinson, who rushed to
ward the basket as the final seconds
ticked off the clock and hit a run
ning 32-footer to win the game.
"When I let it go, it felt good,"
Robinson said.
And like Robinson's game-win
ning three-pointer at the buzzer,
this team, this win was quite the
longshot — overcoming the ab
sence of both senior forward Justin
Davis and sophomore forward
Matt Haryasz, both out with in
juries, coming back from a five
point deficit with less than three
minutes left to play.
Stoudamire led all scorers with
24 points off 9-of-14 shooting from
the field.
Hernandez contributed 20
points and five assists to the Cardi
nal effort, while Childress added 18
points and 10 boards. Junior center
Rob Little finished with 16 points
and six rebounds in 30 minutes of
play.
The Wildcats have lost three out
of their last four conference games
and fall into a tie for fourth place in
the Pac-10.
Stanford, on the other hand, re
mains undefeated and tied with the
school record for most consecutive
wins.
The Cardinal travel to Haas
Pavilion to play unranked Califor
nia on Saturday hoping to pick up
win number 21.
