Nearly 50 students and community
members gathered at the Oval on Satur
day to take part in a hybrid-car parade.
The signs on display included messages
such as "I'm ruining the environment" and
"Ford refuses to protect the planet by re
fusing to implement today's cleanest tech
nologies."
The events were sponsored by Bluewa
ter Network, an environmental activism
and lobbying group, which seeks to in
crease public awareness of global warming
and to introduce members of the sur
rounding community to conventional au
tomobile alternatives, namely hybrid elec
trical vehicles.
The parade of two dozen hybrid vehi
cles drove through Palo Alto and came to
a final stop at the Peninsula Ford Dealer
ship on El Camino Real, where manager
Ron Fodrey was presented with a cake
proclaiming "clean cars are a piece of
cake" and fuzzy dice that read, "Ford,
don't gamble with our planet."
Fodrey greeted the demonstrators and
said he was in support of their goals. He
said Ford would soon introduce a new hy
brid that would address some of the par
ticipants' concerns.
"We're all living in this place, we all
want to get better gas mileage," Fodrey
said. "In the long run, I hope Ford does a
better job."

Hybrids combine the internal combus
tion engine of a conventional car with the
battery and motor of an electric vehicle.
This technology offers lower emissions
and nearly twice the fuel economy of vehi
cles employing just combustion engines.

Honda and Toyota are currently the only
two car companies that manufacture hy
brids.
