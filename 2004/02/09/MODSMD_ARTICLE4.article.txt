# Hybrid car parade singles out Ford
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR STAFF WRITER 
Nearly 50 students and community
members gathered at the Oval on Satur
day to take part in a hybrid-car parade.
The signs on display included messages
such as "I'm ruining the environment" and
"Ford refuses to protect the planet by re
fusing to implement today's cleanest tech
nologies."
The events were sponsored by Bluewa
ter Network, an environmental activism
and lobbying group, which seeks to in
crease public awareness of global warming
and to introduce members of the sur
rounding community to conventional au
tomobile alternatives, namely hybrid elec
trical vehicles.
The parade of two dozen hybrid vehi
cles drove through Palo Alto and came to
a final stop at the Peninsula Ford Dealer
ship on El Camino Real, where manager
Ron Fodrey was presented with a cake
proclaiming "clean cars are a piece of
cake" and fuzzy dice that read, "Ford,
don't gamble with our planet."
Fodrey greeted the demonstrators and
said he was in support of their goals. He
said Ford would soon introduce a new hy
brid that would address some of the par
ticipants' concerns.
"We're all living in this place, we all
want to get better gas mileage," Fodrey
said. "In the long run, I hope Ford does a
better job."

Hybrids combine the internal combus
tion engine of a conventional car with the
battery and motor of an electric vehicle.
This technology offers lower emissions
and nearly twice the fuel economy of vehi
cles employing just combustion engines.

Honda and Toyota are currently the only
two car companies that manufacture hy
brids.

Amy Robinson, a graduate student, and Chris Schaefer decorate a Honda Insight.
Harold of the Bluewater Network,
parade participants demanded that
Ford Motor Company CEO Bill
Ford Jr. keep his promise of making
environmentally-friendly vehicles
and lobby Congress to double fuel
mileage standards for the automo
bile industry.
"We're here to tell Ford that we
really love clean cars," Harold said.
A typical hybrid engine averages
50 to 60 miles per gallon whereas
conventional combustion engines
average between 15 to 25 miles per
gallon. The combustion engine of a
popular Ford SUV has dwindled in
efficiency over the past 80 years, ac
cording to demonstrators.
"The Ford Expedition averages
13 miles per gallon while in 1923 the
Model-T averaged 25 miles per gal
lon." said sophomore Justy Bur
dick. "Knowing that we have tech
nology to increase fuel efficiency of
vehicles, this is inexcusable."
Freshman Nicole Lage, one of
the event's organi/ers, expressed
dismay at automobiles currently in
use.
"We've got cars that get 15 miles
per gallon when they can get 50,"

she said, adding that the consumer's
desire fora cleaner environment
will affect an increase in hybrid ve
hicle use.
Parade participants were partic
ularly concerned with global warm
ing, which is the product of carbon
dioxide emissions from anthro
pogenic sources like automobiles.
"Research shows that global
warming is happening," said Man
deep Gill, a UC-Berkeley doctoral
candidate. "The carbon dioxide
level is higher now than it has been
in many millions of years."
Anne Ehrlich, a senior scientist
at Stanford, spoke to the crowd of
parade participants prior to depar
ture from the oval.
"We have a [national] adminis
tration that thinks global warming is
a myth," she said. She suggested
that the answer to the global warm
ing problem lies with automakers.
The use of more efficient hybrid
engines will have environmental im
plications, such as lower carbon
dioxide emissions. However, these
effects are contingent upon a shift in
the current thinking of the U.S.-
based automotive industry, which
has not yet manufactured hybrid
cars.
"In the last several years. Ford
Motor Company has continued to
break promises to increase the fuel
efficiency of their vehicles," Harold
said. "We know that the technology

exists to double fuel mileage stan
dards, and we want Ford to lead the
automobile industry to a cleaner fu
ture by taking concrete steps to curb
global warming."
Harold added that the automo
bile industry accounts for 20 percent
of global warming emissions in the
United States.
As one of the leaders of the auto
motive industry, she said. Ford is in
a unique position to make changes
to automobile standards that will
have other automobile makers fol
lowing suit.
Vice Mayor of Palo Alto Jim
Burch offered words of optimism.
"You keep seeing more and
more hybrid cars," he said. "Palo
Alto is a green city, the only one in
Santa Clara County."
According to Chris Schaefer, one
of the parade participants, a de
crease in the global supply of crude
oil will ultimately thrust the hybrids
into the spotlight.
"If gas prices go up, these cars
will become more popular," he said.
Jason Mark, a car campaigner at
Global Exchange, an environmen
tal and human rights group, said
that a shift to hybrids will decrease
our dependence on the global sup
ply of crude oil.
"Forty percent of all oil goes into
personal cars and trucks," he ex
plained. "If we want to break oil de
pendence, then looking at the car

market can make the most signifi
cant change."
He added that Ford's depen
dence on short-term profit gains via
SUVs will have long-term implica
tions when the supply of oil decreas
es.
Fodrey, the dealership manager,
emphasized that Ford is taking steps
on its environmental promises.
This summer Ford will release of
the hybrid version of its Escape
SUV, Fodrey said, which will boast
35-40 miles per gallon fuel econo
my. Further, the number of hybrid
models available in the U.S. will
more than double next year, from
three to seven, with hybrid SUV en
tries from Honda, Lexus, Nissan
and Toyota.
"When the cars hit the market,
people embrace them," Fodrey
said.

cles employing just combustion engines.

Honda and Toyota are currently the only
two car companies that manufacture hy
brids.

Harold of the Bluewater Network,
parade participants demanded that
Ford Motor Company CEO Bill
Ford Jr. keep his promise of making
environmentally-friendly vehicles
and lobby Congress to double fuel
mileage standards for the automo
bile industry.
"We're here to tell Ford that we
really love clean cars," Harold said.
A typical hybrid engine averages
50 to 60 miles per gallon whereas
conventional combustion engines
average between 15 to 25 miles per
gallon. The combustion engine of a
popular Ford SUV has dwindled in
efficiency over the past 80 years, ac
cording to demonstrators.
"The Ford Expedition averages
13 miles per gallon while in 1923 the
Model-T averaged 25 miles per gal
lon." said sophomore Justy Bur
dick. "Knowing that we have tech
nology to increase fuel efficiency of
vehicles, this is inexcusable."
Freshman Nicole Lage, one of
the event's organi/ers, expressed
dismay at automobiles currently in
use.
"We've got cars that get 15 miles
per gallon when they can get 50,"

she said, adding that the consumer's
desire fora cleaner environment
will affect an increase in hybrid ve
hicle use.
Parade participants were partic
ularly concerned with global warm
ing, which is the product of carbon
dioxide emissions from anthro
pogenic sources like automobiles.
"Research shows that global
warming is happening," said Man
deep Gill, a UC-Berkeley doctoral
candidate. "The carbon dioxide
level is higher now than it has been
in many millions of years."
Anne Ehrlich, a senior scientist
at Stanford, spoke to the crowd of
parade participants prior to depar
ture from the oval.
"We have a [national] adminis
tration that thinks global warming is
a myth," she said. She suggested
that the answer to the global warm
ing problem lies with automakers.
The use of more efficient hybrid
engines will have environmental im
plications, such as lower carbon
dioxide emissions. However, these
effects are contingent upon a shift in
the current thinking of the U.S.-
based automotive industry, which
has not yet manufactured hybrid
cars.
"In the last several years. Ford
Motor Company has continued to
break promises to increase the fuel
efficiency of their vehicles," Harold
said. "We know that the technology

exists to double fuel mileage stan
dards, and we want Ford to lead the
automobile industry to a cleaner fu
ture by taking concrete steps to curb
global warming."
Harold added that the automo
bile industry accounts for 20 percent
of global warming emissions in the
United States.
As one of the leaders of the auto
motive industry, she said. Ford is in
a unique position to make changes
to automobile standards that will
have other automobile makers fol
lowing suit.
Vice Mayor of Palo Alto Jim
Burch offered words of optimism.
"You keep seeing more and
more hybrid cars," he said. "Palo
Alto is a green city, the only one in
Santa Clara County."
According to Chris Schaefer, one
of the parade participants, a de
crease in the global supply of crude
oil will ultimately thrust the hybrids
into the spotlight.
"If gas prices go up, these cars
will become more popular," he said.
Jason Mark, a car campaigner at
Global Exchange, an environmen
tal and human rights group, said
that a shift to hybrids will decrease
our dependence on the global sup
ply of crude oil.
"Forty percent of all oil goes into
personal cars and trucks," he ex
plained. "If we want to break oil de
pendence, then looking at the car

market can make the most signifi
cant change."
He added that Ford's depen
dence on short-term profit gains via
SUVs will have long-term implica
tions when the supply of oil decreas
es.
Fodrey, the dealership manager,
emphasized that Ford is taking steps
on its environmental promises.
This summer Ford will release of
the hybrid version of its Escape
SUV, Fodrey said, which will boast
35-40 miles per gallon fuel econo
my. Further, the number of hybrid
models available in the U.S. will
more than double next year, from
three to seven, with hybrid SUV en
tries from Honda, Lexus, Nissan
and Toyota.
"When the cars hit the market,
people embrace them," Fodrey
said.
Nearly 50 students and community
members gathered at the Oval on Satur
day to take part in a hybrid-car parade.
The signs on display included messages
such as "I'm ruining the environment" and
"Ford refuses to protect the planet by re
fusing to implement today's cleanest tech
nologies."
The events were sponsored by Bluewa
ter Network, an environmental activism
and lobbying group, which seeks to in
crease public awareness of global warming
and to introduce members of the sur
rounding community to conventional au
tomobile alternatives, namely hybrid elec
trical vehicles.
The parade of two dozen hybrid vehi
cles drove through Palo Alto and came to
a final stop at the Peninsula Ford Dealer
ship on El Camino Real, where manager
Ron Fodrey was presented with a cake
proclaiming "clean cars are a piece of
cake" and fuzzy dice that read, "Ford,
don't gamble with our planet."
Fodrey greeted the demonstrators and
said he was in support of their goals. He
said Ford would soon introduce a new hy
brid that would address some of the par
ticipants' concerns.
"We're all living in this place, we all
want to get better gas mileage," Fodrey
said. "In the long run, I hope Ford does a
better job."

Hybrids combine the internal combus
tion engine of a conventional car with the
battery and motor of an electric vehicle.
This technology offers lower emissions
and nearly twice the fuel economy of vehi
cles employing just combustion engines.

two car companies that manufacture hy
