## Cardinal Fan-fest! Sixth Man Club braves cold and rain for seats 
### CORIE GEBALLE 
At least for the rest of this week,
highlights on ESPN will include
Nick Robinson's amazing buzzer
shot to defeat Arizona in a nail-bit
ing finale of yet another Cardinal
basketball victory.
On Saturday, ESPN also aired
the wild, euphoric mob of the Sixth
Man Club student fans rushing the
court and cheering like crazy for the
team they adore.
However, even after the highlight
clips cease to dominate the airwaves,
the Sixth Man Club will be going
strong. This Arizona game illustrated
the dedication and power of the Club.
Many students got little sleep in the
cold to ensure seats on the floor for
what they rightly predicted would be
quite a game.
"I am very proud and just excited
about what a big part of the game the
fans are," said sophomore point
guard Chris Hernandez. "They lift
the team up when we're down and
when we're on a run, they get the
adrenaline going."
Shortly after midnight on Friday,
while many students were still at the
usual frat parties, Maples Pavilion
seemed to host its own social gathering.
Students talked, drank and danced into
the early morning hours.
"I came with fringe people [of my
social group], but I'm getting to know
them better," said Jeremy Heytz, a
graduate student in electrical engineer
ing. "This is the first game I've camped
out for. I came because of peer pres
sure — it's a cool thing to do."

Some students bonded over
karaoke — a Xanadu party had fizzled
and the residents decided their ma
chine would be better used by Sixth
Man Club members. Xanadu residents
carried it over in three cars and turned
out to be right. A "totally, totally ran
dom" group of students, according to
junior Danny Green, sung together for
two hours, many of them drinking.
Some were camping out for the first
time, while others, such as Anita Idicul
la, a fifth-year co-term in education,
had camped out for at least eight games
during her years at Stanford.
First-time campers included fresh
men Jameson Haslam and Bobby van
Hollebeke. They were part of a large
group that was well-equipped for the
long, cold night with graham crackers
and rainbow frosting, a small bucket
with a fire in it and a couch — all set up
beneath a large tarp.
"We're the most dedicated fans
here," van Hollebeke said.
Like many other campers, these
boys had been camping out since
Thursday. Some campers had even
arrived as early as Tuesday, including
sophomore Nam Pham, part of a
Trancos group that held the enviable
position of first in line. The fact that
Tim Morrison, a redshirt freshman on
the team, lives across the hall from
him seemed to be an added consider
ation in his decision to spend four
nights sleeping on concrete, and
sometimes in the rain. Moreover, this
was Pham's seventh time camping
outside of Maples.
"[Trancos] has a lot of spirit and
likes to be first and represent," said
Pham.

The hungry and dedicated fans
were pleasantly surprised at 9 a.m. on
Saturday with a visit from basketball
team members junior Josh Childress,
senior Joe Kirchofer and sophomore
Carlton Weatherby.
"We came from a team breakfast
and brought fruit, muffins and bagels
from the Sports Cafe to the crowd
and said. 'Thank you,'" Childress
said. "I've done this all three of my
years here."
Yet another surprise followed —
this time inside of Maples at 11:20
a.m., when Dick Vitale of ESPN

shook hands and took photographs
with Sixth Man Club members and
signed autographs.
A few campers had mentioned that
part of their excitement was due to
the fact that Vitale was going to be at
the game. A dedicated Duke fan, Vi
tale was surrounded by a mob of Sixth
Man Club members following the
game and forced to listen to passion
ate shouts of "We're number one!"
and "We want Duke!
Among other Sixth Man attrac
tions were Tiger Woods and his fi
ancee, Elin Nordegren.
Nordegren was greeted by a few
Sixth Man members with a sign read
ing, "Tiger's fiancee, will you marry
me instead?"
Many fans brought signs to the
game, and many of them followed the
traditional "ABC" pattern in order to
ensure a spot on national TV. Ar
guably, the most clever sign was a sign
reading: "#1 Academics + #1 Basket
ball = #1 Cardinal," which the network
showed often and also aired in the
ESPN highlights later.
Martin Corpos, a senior, is one of
two co-directors of the Sixth Man Club
this year. He is responsible for events
ranging from three-on-three tourna
ments to organizing food drives for the
homeless to ordering pizza for hungry
club members in line.
"I do it because of the crazy atmo
sphere and because the Sixth Man Club
is known across the country as being
smart-asses," said Corpos.
His hard work, and that of all the
other committee members, has paid
off. Most games this year have been
packed with Club members, including
the overflow section in the upper level
of Maples.
The players certainly realize and
appreciate the impact of their devot
ed student fans on their games at
Maples Pavilion.
"The fans are amazing," Childress
said. "I just know that when other
teams come in they're going to have a
rough time playing us. We have the
best fans in college basketball."

ation in his decision to spend four
nights sleeping on concrete, and
sometimes in the rain. Moreover, this
was Pham's seventh time camping
outside of Maples.
"[Trancos] has a lot of spirit and
likes to be first and represent," said
Pham.

The hungry and dedicated fans
were pleasantly surprised at 9 a.m. on
Saturday with a visit from basketball
team members junior Josh Childress,
senior Joe Kirchofer and sophomore
Carlton Weatherby.
"We came from a team breakfast
and brought fruit, muffins and bagels
from the Sports Cafe to the crowd
and said. 'Thank you,'" Childress
said. "I've done this all three of my
years here."
Yet another surprise followed —
this time inside of Maples at 11:20
a.m., when Dick Vitale of ESPN

shook hands and took photographs
with Sixth Man Club members and
signed autographs.
A few campers had mentioned that
part of their excitement was due to
the fact that Vitale was going to be at
the game. A dedicated Duke fan, Vi
tale was surrounded by a mob of Sixth
Man Club members following the
game and forced to listen to passion
ate shouts of "We're number one!"
and "We want Duke!
Among other Sixth Man attrac
tions were Tiger Woods and his fi
ancee, Elin Nordegren.
Nordegren was greeted by a few
Sixth Man members with a sign read
ing, "Tiger's fiancee, will you marry
me instead?"
Many fans brought signs to the
game, and many of them followed the
traditional "ABC" pattern in order to
ensure a spot on national TV. Ar
guably, the most clever sign was a sign
reading: "#1 Academics + #1 Basket
ball = #1 Cardinal," which the network
showed often and also aired in the
ESPN highlights later.
Martin Corpos, a senior, is one of
two co-directors of the Sixth Man Club
this year. He is responsible for events
ranging from three-on-three tourna
ments to organizing food drives for the
homeless to ordering pizza for hungry
club members in line.
"I do it because of the crazy atmo
sphere and because the Sixth Man Club
is known across the country as being
smart-asses," said Corpos.
His hard work, and that of all the
other committee members, has paid
off. Most games this year have been
packed with Club members, including
the overflow section in the upper level
of Maples.
The players certainly realize and
appreciate the impact of their devot
ed student fans on their games at
Maples Pavilion.
"The fans are amazing," Childress
said. "I just know that when other
teams come in they're going to have a
rough time playing us. We have the
best fans in college basketball."

Fans arrived at Maples Pavilion as early as Tuesday in order to procure a floor seat for the Stanford-Arizona basketball
game, held Saturday.


A Sixth Man Club member puts the finishing touches on a sign, which was later
broadcast by ABC, the network televising the game.
At least for the rest of this week,
highlights on ESPN will include
Nick Robinson's amazing buzzer
shot to defeat Arizona in a nail-bit
ing finale of yet another Cardinal
basketball victory.
On Saturday, ESPN also aired
the wild, euphoric mob of the Sixth
Man Club student fans rushing the
court and cheering like crazy for the
team they adore.
However, even after the highlight
clips cease to dominate the airwaves,
the Sixth Man Club will be going
strong. This Arizona game illustrated
the dedication and power of the Club.
Many students got little sleep in the
cold to ensure seats on the floor for
what they rightly predicted would be
quite a game.
"I am very proud and just excited
about what a big part of the game the
fans are," said sophomore point
guard Chris Hernandez. "They lift
the team up when we're down and
when we're on a run, they get the
adrenaline going."
Shortly after midnight on Friday,
while many students were still at the
usual frat parties, Maples Pavilion
seemed to host its own social gathering.
Students talked, drank and danced into
the early morning hours.
"I came with fringe people [of my
social group], but I'm getting to know
them better," said Jeremy Heytz, a
graduate student in electrical engineer
ing. "This is the first game I've camped
out for. I came because of peer pres
sure — it's a cool thing to do."

Some students bonded over
karaoke — a Xanadu party had fizzled
and the residents decided their ma
chine would be better used by Sixth
Man Club members. Xanadu residents
carried it over in three cars and turned
out to be right. A "totally, totally ran
dom" group of students, according to
junior Danny Green, sung together for
two hours, many of them drinking.
Some were camping out for the first
time, while others, such as Anita Idicul
la, a fifth-year co-term in education,
had camped out for at least eight games
during her years at Stanford.
First-time campers included fresh
men Jameson Haslam and Bobby van
Hollebeke. They were part of a large
group that was well-equipped for the
long, cold night with graham crackers
and rainbow frosting, a small bucket
with a fire in it and a couch — all set up
beneath a large tarp.
"We're the most dedicated fans
here," van Hollebeke said.
Like many other campers, these
boys had been camping out since
Thursday. Some campers had even
arrived as early as Tuesday, including
sophomore Nam Pham, part of a
Trancos group that held the enviable
position of first in line. The fact that
Tim Morrison, a redshirt freshman on
the team, lives across the hall from
him seemed to be an added consider
ation in his decision to spend four
nights sleeping on concrete, and
sometimes in the rain. Moreover, this
was Pham's seventh time camping
outside of Maples.
"[Trancos] has a lot of spirit and
likes to be first and represent," said
Pham.
