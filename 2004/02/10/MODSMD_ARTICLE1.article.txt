# Student incubator fosters projects, ideas
## 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
A growing need for stu
dent space and support
paved the way fora collab
orative effort by the ASSU,
Office of Student Activities
and Innovative Student In
novation Services (ISIS) to
start the Blender, as Stan
ford's first "student incuba
tor" for the fostering of
new projects and ideas. The
Blender provides a variety
of services to both estab
lished and emerging stu
dent groups.
The Blender is located
on the second and third
floors of the Old Union
Nitery Building. What was
once an office space for In
formation Technology-

Systems and Services
(ITSS) and Continuing
Studies was completely
renovated by ISIS and the
ASSU.
"The Blender used to be
a clutter of cubicles and of
fice space," said sopho
more Mojan Movassate,
ISIS project manager for
the Blender. "We took all
of last quarter renovating,
painting and refurnishing
the place ourselves, and it
is exciting to see how the
project has progressed."
The Blender is made up
of six meeting rooms and
five student workspaces,
each catering to a different
group capacity. The rooms
are designated with sepa
rate colors, and the main
room painted in red to rep

resent the Cardinal.
The Blender provides a
variety of services, catering
to both established student
groups and providing sup
port and guidance for stu
dents with new ideas.
"We're offering space,
mentorship and support
programming to groups of
students that have innova
tive ideas on how they can
improve an aspect of the
Stanford community," said
ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa, a senior.
"Groups that are accepted
to the Blender will be given
office space and will have
the opportunity to work
with other groups as they
develop their ideas."
The Blender project has
been in the works since the

beginning of the summer
when ISIS realized the
need for an environment to
foster student ingenuity.
Coupled with a need for
student space on campus,
the sponsoring groups
came together to fund the
Blender.
"Plenty of students have
great ideas, but they don't
know what to do with
them, and our aim is to give
them the direction they
need to realize their
goals," said Movassate. "I
hope that the Blender will
encourage the student
body to think about how
they can make an impact
on this campus while they
are still here."
The Blender is now
open and accepting appli

cations, which are avail
able at http://isis.stan
ford.edu/blender â€” for
groups interested in using
the Blender's mentorship,
programs and student
space facilities. The appli
cations are due Feb. 22.
Already, students have
welcomed the new space
and are making plans to
utilize the Blender.
"I was thinking of apply
ing to the Blender for an en
gineering design competi
tion that would be student
run," said junior Ben
Chang. "I think the Blender
is a great idea because it
would get more student
oriented project design on
campus. It would definitely
be a great asset to the Stan
ford community."
