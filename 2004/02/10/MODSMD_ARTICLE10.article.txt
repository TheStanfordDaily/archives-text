## Mission to Mars — Mixed Reactions 
### GEOFF KOCH 
President George W. Bush un
veiled a plan last Jan. 15 to return
Americans to the moon by 2020 and
perhaps to Mars and beyond after
that. It was a bold proposal — but
nearly a month later, reaction
around Stanford is tepid at best.
Stanford Nobel Prize-winning
physicist Doug Osheroff voiced a
sentiment shared by many — he was
not against human spaceflight if the
costs were reasonable.
"Right now, there is no econom
ic value in going to Mars," he said.

Osheroff, who served on
the external committee that
investigated the 2003
Columbia shuttle accident,
added. "This may change as
costs come down and as we
learn more about what is out
there."
The numbers are stag
gering. In 1989, on the 20th
anniversary of the Apollo
moon landing, President
George H.W. Bush pushed
for human exploration of
the moon and Mars. When
the cost estimates became
available — as much as
$450 billion spread over at
least three decades — the
proposal foundered be
cause of lack of support.
Many experts say that
space travel technology has
not improved appreciably
since 1989 to drive down
costs. In today's dollars, the
price to send humans to
Mars might be as high as $1
trillion spent over 30 years.
"It's a figure that exceeds
federal research spending in
all fields except
biomedicine," Osheroff
said.
Osheroff's comparison is
apt, given that the scientific
progress due to human
spaceflight have been ques
tionable at best. The Apollo
program, although it in
spired imaginations, was
more an engineering accom
plishment than a scientific
triumph.
Critics say the astronauts

merely planted the flag, left foot
prints on the moon's soil and
brought back bagfuls of rocks. In
deed, few dispute that robotic mis
sions and even ground-based obser
vations yielded more information
about the moon than the Apollo
program did.
Budget realities
Perhaps in an effort to avoid his
father's mistake, the President only
spoke of laying the groundwork to
someday go to Mars. He proposed
spending $12 billion over the next
five years on the effort, most of
which will come from existing
NASA programs.
Some, like Stanford Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare, worry about
the effect this initiative will have on
NASA's other scientific activities.
"Manned spaceflight should not

happen at the expense of robotic
missions," he said.
Zare was part of the research
team that suggested in 1996 that a
meteorite might contain evidence of
ancient microscopic life on Mars.
"Unmanned probes cost less,
produce results and go to places that
are too unhealthy and too far away,"
he said.
Risk and sacrifice
The risks in going to Mars are sig
nificant. Russia's experience with
the Mir space station suggest that

extended time in space increases the
risk of irreversible bone loss and ra
diation poisoning from solar flares.
This is especially important since a
one-way trip to Mars would take at
least nine months.
NASA is especially concerned
about astronauts' safety. Days after
Bush's speech, the agency an
nounced that it was suspending fur
ther maintenance of the Hubble
Space Telescope, in part due to safe
ty concerns.
In the wake of the Columbia dis
aster, NASA decided that all space
ships be equipped with "lifeboats"
for the astronauts in the case of
emergencies.
Political considerations
Zare was pursuing his doctoral in
physical chemistry at Harvard in
1961 when President John F.

Kennedy outlined the rationale for
the Apollo program. Zare said he
and his fellow graduate students did
not think much about the politics
surrounding the announcement.
Rather, they mostly wondered if the
country had the technical where
withal to pull it off.
But politics swirl about Bush's
plans.
"The President has once again
demonstrated his extraordinary will
ingness to pursue election year gim
micks — this time pursuing a NASA
expansion that underestimates costs
and overestimates the benefits to

American people without jobs or
health care," said Dan Kreiss, a mas
ter's student in journalism.
Mike Kass, a first-year law stu
dent who was also an undergradu
ate at Stanford in the Class of '01,
agreed.
"This country simply cannot af
ford current spending levels, let
alone billions more for enhancing
the space program," Kass said.
"Raise taxes, then we'll talk."
At its height, the Apollo program
consumed nearly one percent of the
nation's GDP, according to some es
timates. This percentage is higher
than the priciest estimates to go to
Mars today.
However, the Apollo missions
happened during the Cold War,
when the United States was active
ly engaged in a space race. Despite
skepticism about the scientific lega
cy, the missions did generate a great

sense of national pride.
The atmosphere is different
today. Most students on campus
seem to doubt that a return to the
moon or even the first steps onto
Mars would have a similar effect on
the national mood.
Robotic missions continue
NASA believes people are curi
ous to learn more about our solar
system even if they do not want to
spend billions of dollars to put hu
mans in space. The agency points to
its highly popular robotic missions

as an example.
Brian Day, a tech
nical lead at NASA, said
that exhibits in the Ames
Mars Center featuring the
current mission have
been highly visited.
"More than 3,000
people showed up to a re
cent family night and on
weekends we sometimes
have 1,000 people or
more come through the
center," he said.
At least some say
that ultimately, space is a
worthwhile dream.
"Remember that
150 years ago it was dan
ger to cross from the East
Coast to the West Coast,"
Zare said.
Erin Lashnits, a
junior, expressed the
same sentiment.
"There are many
reasons why Bush's plan
is considered unrealistic,"
Lashnits said. "But in the
end, the value of human
spaceflight — one of the
most technologically im
pressive feats humankind
has accomplished — will
outweigh any argument
against it."
Proponents of
spaceflight often like to
remind people that just
one lifetime passed be
tween the Wright broth
ers and the Apollo moon
landing. Lashnits' own
academic history indi
cates how fast thinkintz

about space can change.
She is in the process of creating
an individually designed major in
astrobiology, a field that did not
exist even a few a decades ago.
Earth is the only place where
life is known to exist. But with evi
dence mounting that Mars long ago
was a warmer and wetter place, the
question of life on the red planet
has been exciting more and more
people.
While unanswered questions re
main about the cost and feasibility
of his plans. Bush seems to be bank
ing that this curiosity does, in fact,
exist.
"The human thirst for knowl
edge ultimately cannot be satisfied
by even the most vivid pictures or
the most detailed measurements,"
the President said. "We need to
see and examine and touch for
ourselves."

about the moon than the Apollo
program did.
Budget realities
Perhaps in an effort to avoid his
father's mistake, the President only
spoke of laying the groundwork to
someday go to Mars. He proposed
spending $12 billion over the next
five years on the effort, most of
which will come from existing
NASA programs.
Some, like Stanford Chemistry
Prof. Richard Zare, worry about
the effect this initiative will have on
NASA's other scientific activities.
"Manned spaceflight should not

happen at the expense of robotic
missions," he said.
Zare was part of the research
team that suggested in 1996 that a
meteorite might contain evidence of
ancient microscopic life on Mars.
"Unmanned probes cost less,
produce results and go to places that
are too unhealthy and too far away,"
he said.
Risk and sacrifice
The risks in going to Mars are sig
nificant. Russia's experience with
the Mir space station suggest that

extended time in space increases the
risk of irreversible bone loss and ra
diation poisoning from solar flares.
This is especially important since a
one-way trip to Mars would take at
least nine months.
NASA is especially concerned
about astronauts' safety. Days after
Bush's speech, the agency an
nounced that it was suspending fur
ther maintenance of the Hubble
Space Telescope, in part due to safe
ty concerns.
In the wake of the Columbia dis
aster, NASA decided that all space
ships be equipped with "lifeboats"
for the astronauts in the case of
emergencies.
Political considerations
Zare was pursuing his doctoral in
physical chemistry at Harvard in
1961 when President John F.

Kennedy outlined the rationale for
the Apollo program. Zare said he
and his fellow graduate students did
not think much about the politics
surrounding the announcement.
Rather, they mostly wondered if the
country had the technical where
withal to pull it off.
But politics swirl about Bush's
plans.
"The President has once again
demonstrated his extraordinary will
ingness to pursue election year gim
micks — this time pursuing a NASA
expansion that underestimates costs
and overestimates the benefits to

American people without jobs or
health care," said Dan Kreiss, a mas
ter's student in journalism.
Mike Kass, a first-year law stu
dent who was also an undergradu
ate at Stanford in the Class of '01,
agreed.
"This country simply cannot af
ford current spending levels, let
alone billions more for enhancing
the space program," Kass said.
"Raise taxes, then we'll talk."
At its height, the Apollo program
consumed nearly one percent of the
nation's GDP, according to some es
timates. This percentage is higher
than the priciest estimates to go to
Mars today.
However, the Apollo missions
happened during the Cold War,
when the United States was active
ly engaged in a space race. Despite
skepticism about the scientific lega
cy, the missions did generate a great

sense of national pride.
The atmosphere is different
today. Most students on campus
seem to doubt that a return to the
moon or even the first steps onto
Mars would have a similar effect on
the national mood.
Robotic missions continue
NASA believes people are curi
ous to learn more about our solar
system even if they do not want to
spend billions of dollars to put hu
mans in space. The agency points to
its highly popular robotic missions

as an example.
Brian Day, a tech
nical lead at NASA, said
that exhibits in the Ames
Mars Center featuring the
current mission have
been highly visited.
"More than 3,000
people showed up to a re
cent family night and on
weekends we sometimes
have 1,000 people or
more come through the
center," he said.
At least some say
that ultimately, space is a
worthwhile dream.
"Remember that
150 years ago it was dan
ger to cross from the East
Coast to the West Coast,"
Zare said.
Erin Lashnits, a
junior, expressed the
same sentiment.
"There are many
reasons why Bush's plan
is considered unrealistic,"
Lashnits said. "But in the
end, the value of human
spaceflight — one of the
most technologically im
pressive feats humankind
has accomplished — will
outweigh any argument
against it."
Proponents of
spaceflight often like to
remind people that just
one lifetime passed be
tween the Wright broth
ers and the Apollo moon
landing. Lashnits' own
academic history indi
cates how fast thinkintz

about space can change.
She is in the process of creating
an individually designed major in
astrobiology, a field that did not
exist even a few a decades ago.
Earth is the only place where
life is known to exist. But with evi
dence mounting that Mars long ago
was a warmer and wetter place, the
question of life on the red planet
has been exciting more and more
people.
While unanswered questions re
main about the cost and feasibility
of his plans. Bush seems to be bank
ing that this curiosity does, in fact,
exist.
"The human thirst for knowl
edge ultimately cannot be satisfied
by even the most vivid pictures or
the most detailed measurements,"
the President said. "We need to
see and examine and touch for
ourselves."

President George W. Bush un
veiled a plan last Jan. 15 to return
Americans to the moon by 2020 and
perhaps to Mars and beyond after
that. It was a bold proposal — but
nearly a month later, reaction
around Stanford is tepid at best.
Stanford Nobel Prize-winning
physicist Doug Osheroff voiced a
sentiment shared by many — he was
not against human spaceflight if the
costs were reasonable.
"Right now, there is no econom
ic value in going to Mars," he said.

Osheroff, who served on
the external committee that
investigated the 2003
Columbia shuttle accident,
added. "This may change as
costs come down and as we
learn more about what is out
there."
The numbers are stag
gering. In 1989, on the 20th
anniversary of the Apollo
moon landing, President
George H.W. Bush pushed
for human exploration of
the moon and Mars. When
the cost estimates became
available — as much as
$450 billion spread over at
least three decades — the
proposal foundered be
cause of lack of support.
Many experts say that
space travel technology has
not improved appreciably
since 1989 to drive down
costs. In today's dollars, the
price to send humans to
Mars might be as high as $1
trillion spent over 30 years.
"It's a figure that exceeds
federal research spending in
all fields except
biomedicine," Osheroff
said.
Osheroff's comparison is
apt, given that the scientific
progress due to human
spaceflight have been ques
tionable at best. The Apollo
program, although it in
spired imaginations, was
more an engineering accom
plishment than a scientific
triumph.
Critics say the astronauts

merely planted the flag, left foot
prints on the moon's soil and
brought back bagfuls of rocks. In
deed, few dispute that robotic mis
sions and even ground-based obser
vations yielded more information
about the moon than the Apollo
program did.
