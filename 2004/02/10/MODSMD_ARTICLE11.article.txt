## French cocoa aspirin and the latest in science

Mars emerging from Ice Age
Data from NASA's Mars Odyssey suggests that Mars may be
emerging from an ice age. The Odyssey has been surveying the
planet for almost a full Martian year and detected season changes,
including the advance and retreat of polar ice. Among the major
findings is that there is more frozen water nearer to the equator
than expected. A temperature diagram of the planet's surface fur-

thermore shows dark, cold patches around bright
expanses. "One possibility is that the ice is clear
in these areas and we're seeing down through the
ice to features underneath," said Phil Chris
tensen of Arizona State University, Tempe, prin
cipal investigator for the camera system.
Plant aspirin
Cornell scientists have found a plant gene that
is critical in immune response. The SABP2 gene
codes for an aspirin-like hormone that essentially

activates the entire organism for defense. Daniel Klessig, one of the
study's coauthors, said, "Now that we know a key signaling protein in
plant immune systems, we can work on ways to enhance the signal
and help plants fight disease without using potentially harmful pesti
cides." The researchers found that boosting SABP2 accelerates the
immune response whereas silencing it caused the immune system to
fail. The experiments were done in the tobacco plant, but similar as
pirin-like hormone signaling is found in many other plants. This dis
covery has potential implications in agriculture to prevent plant dis
eases from damaging important crops.
French support embryo research
Last December France allowed research on human embryos to
continue, but only fora limited period of five years. The lawmak
ers viewed the research as a "scientific necessity" until adult stem
cells are possibly available. Harvesting stem cells kills the embryo
and the procedure is usually done on aborted fetuses. The French
legislature is currently debating a bill on bioethics that includes
guidelines on embryo research.
Cocoa is good for you
According to a Cornell study, the fruit from which chocolate is
made may have great health benefits. Cocoa beverages have a high
level of antioxidants, which have been touted to prevent cardiovas
cular disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease and to decrease the
effects of aging. Cocoa scored two to three times higher than green
tea and four to five times higher than black tea. The researchers
noted that chocolate bars also provide antioxidants, although their
high saturated fat may offset any benefits. The scientists also noted
they do not yet know the optimum amount of cocoa that should be
consumed. In the mean time, one should not neglect fruits, nuts and
vegetables — they are also great sources of antioxidants.
Semiconductor supports negative charges
A team of British and American physicists found that indium ni
tride can support a large build-up of negative charge at its surface.
Only one other semiconductor, indium arsenide, also exhibits this
property. This behavior has potential applications in fabricating
magnetoelectronic devices and semiconductor-superconductor hy
brids. Semiconductors are materials that can be to have different
electric conductivity according to temperature. Superconductors
are materials that can carry electricity virtually without friction, typ
ically at very low temperatures.
New subatomic particle
The KEK laboratory in Japan has confirmed a new subatomic
particle, temporarily named "X." The team detected it when
studying B-mesons and observing that some particles had higher
mass and decaying time than expected. On a closer analysis, they
noted these mesons were made of four quarks instead of the regu- •
lar two or three. Currently, X does not fit into any particle scheme.
One possibility is that current models of the strong force will be
modified. Another is that X represents a complete new category of
particles: mesons with two quarks and two anti-quarks.
