# Fellowship combines tech and social entrepreneurship
## 
### MOHAMMED ABDOOLCARIM 
Imagine a "smart card" that can track informa
tion using a Web-enabled central database. This
may seem like a gadget Safeway would use to track
your grocery shopping. Or, perhaps, a way Ameri
can Express could learn about your buying habits to
cater credit card plans for your shopping needs. But
not if this smart card is part of the Digital Vision
Fellowship, which allows working professionals to
utilize technology in innovative ways.
In this case the smart card is being used to track
the date of immunizations in a child's life in India.
Health assistants could then monitor the weekly
coverage and identify drug inventory and gaps in
treatment.
Brij Kothari, one of this year's fellows, said that
the philosophy of the program is to apply technol
ogy to human development. For him, Stanford is
the best place to do this because "it gives your
ideas legitimacy."
He also mentioned that the University is strate
gically located at the heart of Silicon Valley and
provides a network of resources and people.
With a background in development and commu
nications. Kothari is currently working on a project
called "Bollywood Industry — Jukebox for Litera

cy in India." The idea is to use Indian movies with
subtitles to "improve reading over time and make
television interactive." Kothari said that he had the
idea while watching a Spanish film with English sub
titles and realizing that a Spanish film with Spanish
subtitles could encourage literacy.
Innovative technologies and applications like
this are the staple of the program. Fifteen fellows
are currently working full-time on projects ranging
from e-immunizations to computer-on-wheels. The
range of projects reflects the issues and problems af
fecting developing countries today.
Stanford is one of the few places in the world that
offers programs like the Digital Vision Fellowship,
combining information technology and develop
ment. Each fellow works full-time at Stanford for up
to one academic year undertaking projects that ex
plore the use of information and communications
technologies in addressing developing world prob
lems. Fellows come from a variety of countries in
cluding India, Kenya and Japan.
Director of the program, Stuart Gannes, said
that fellows come to the program bringing with
them an entrepreneurial spirit.
"Most interesting projects are created by people
who are technologist types, people who have a need
to apply their ideas to the domain of technology,"

he said.
Fellows arrive at Stanford with their ideas in the
hope of using Stanford as an incubator to test their
idea before taking it to the real world. Gannes looks
for fellows dedicated to pursuing their ideas beyond
Stanford and even for the rest of their life. He wants
to find people who "do not expect to ever be done
with their endeavor."
Gannes did not expect every idea to be success
ful. "Why [else] would you come to Stanford to
make it happen?" he said.

He hopes that more Stanford students will be
come involved in the Digital Vision Program. "Fel
lows have a lot to offer Stanford students because it
gets them solving real-world problems," he said. In
the past, several students have received credit from
their professors as independent study projects when
working with the fellows.
Kothari points out that fellows work in all kinds
of disciplines involving technology, policy, electron
ics and even healthcare and so students coming
from different departments and interests can get in
volved. Kothari also said that ideas in the program
and the desire to succeed go hand in hand. He em
phasized that the environment is suitable to Stan
ford students who share the same kind of dedication
and passion.
From his work so far, Kothari said he has real
ized that the most powerful thing he can do is to
create a cost-effective way of learning a language.
"With a dollar, I can give 10,000 people the
ability to practice reading their language every
year."
With his project, he hopes to increase the liter
acy level for 200 million people in India. He finds
the most innovative part of his project is finding a
sustainable financial model for increasing literacy
levels.
