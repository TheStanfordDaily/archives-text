## The 						Stanford Daily Editorials SAE's doubleheader a success 
### 
We really have to give props to
the boys of Sigma Alpha
Epilson. They have set a
great tone for campus social
life and have proven that a fraternity that
was on probation can rehabilitate itself
and rejuvenate campus life.
This past weekend, SAE hosted two
parties that were well planned and took
place without an alcohol-related incident.
SAE served the vital function of being a
social outlet for Stanford students, while
complying completely with stringent Of
fice of Student Activities' demands. We
laud the fraternity for its efforts and effi
cacy. Hosting an entertaining and fun
party is a difficult and time-consuming
task. This is especially true when the party
is open to the entire campus. Thus, SAE
exhibited extraordinary efforts in creat
ing entertaining parties that followed
University rules.
Indeed, the student body has responded
in a positive manner to the parties that
SAE put on this weekend, and has said
that the parties channeled and demon
strated school spirit (particularly on Satur
day night, when the men's basketball team
celebrated its win with students at SAE)

and reminded students what the campus
had been missing without SAE parties.
These types of positive outlets to celebrate
are essential to making our school the best
in the nation. While the Ivy League
schools can try to claim academic superi
ority over Stanford, the social environ
ment of Stanford is unparalleled.
This is especially encouraging because
SAE was previously on housing proba
tion. The fact that this fraternity could re
vitalize the social scene and stay in com
pliance with University policy sets a
tremendous example for other fraterni
ties that face similar sanctions in the fu
ture. Clearly, the members of the fraterni
ty exhibited a commitment to the spirit of
University policy.
Given the commitment that SAE has
shown, perhaps the University adminis
tration should view fraternities in a new
light. They are an important part of cam
pus life and have exhibited a commitment
to positive social interaction. SAE has
taken steps to help Stanford regain a first
rate social atmosphere and have ex
claimed to the administration that they
want to comply. As such, the administra
tion should provide some reciprocity.
