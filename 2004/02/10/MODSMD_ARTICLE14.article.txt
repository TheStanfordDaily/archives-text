# Sixth Man Club inspires Card
## 
### 
This weekend's incredible victory
against Arizona was another ex
ample of the success of Stanford's
basketball program. Head Coach
Mike Montgomery, his coaching staff and
the Cardinal team have proven that they
can withstand intense competition and
rise to a record 20-0 season and No. 2 na
tional ranking.
At least some credit for the basketball
program's success, however, belongs to
the dedicated and ardent fans of the Sixth
Man Club. Stanford students have
demonstrated that they can be as passion
ate as fans at other academic / basketball
powerhouses, namely Duke. Students
camped out for days, painted their faces
and cheered at the top of their lungs for
Saturday's pivotal nail-biter against then-
No. 12 Arizona. Rallying behind the play
ers, members of the Sixth Man Club pro
vided rowdy vocal support that spurred
the team on when it was behind by five
points with 44 seconds left in the game.
"The Sixth Man Club won this game
today," redshirt sophomore point guard
Chris Hernandez's mother was overheard
saying during the post-game celebration

on the court.
While this may have been an overstate
ment expressed in the excitement of the
moment, Stanford fans clearly played an
important role in encouraging the team
during what seemed like a hopeless final
minute. The outcome could easily have
been different if Stanford had not been
playing at home in front of such enthusias
tic fans. While Arizona had shown tremen
dous effort throughout the second half —
particularly their 14-0 seven-minute run
— it made some mistakes that left itself
open in the final minute. Both the Stan
ford team and Stanford students really put
the pressure on Arizona at the end of the
game, and the Wildcats cracked.
Unfortunately, students of the Sixth Man
Club can only attend home games. But
hopefully, the Stanford men's basketball
team will remember the fervent support
they receive at home even while on the
road — especially during March Madness
next month. The Cardinal can then use the
knowledge of campus enthusiasm to in
spire them to the national championship. In
the words of the Sixth Man Club's never
tiresome cheer, "Go Stanford!"
