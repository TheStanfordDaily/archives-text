## RYM deserves place on Farm 
### KELLI PAYNE YOLANDA VAZQUEZ 
Bob Sensenbrenner — the
sophomore vice president of the
Stanford College Republicans
(SCR) — called us on the phone
on Friday, and in a disrespectful
manner that was loud enough for
two people in the room to hear,
objected to the Republican
Youth Majority's (RYM) state
ment in Friday's article ("Ele
phant Stampede!" Feb. 6) that
the RYM intended to set up an
organization independent of the
existing Republican group on
campus. Stanford is acclaimed
for building leaders who think
critically and independently, not
accepting the flaws of the status
quo but acting on their beliefs
against suppression and discrim
ination. Many students have ex
pressed their excitement at final
ly finding an organization that
shares and outwardly represents
their political beliefs. There is a
market and voice for pro-choice,
pro-environment Republicans at
Stanford — and it is through the
organization of the RYM.
Our group has and will contin
ue to support SCR, both by
strengthening the Republican
Party — our shared goal — and
specifically by encouraging all
members of the RYM to join
SCR. Unfortunately, our hope to
work constructively with SCR has
not been reciprocated. Despite
their claims to be an inclusive and
tolerant group, Sensenbrenner
threatened that if we try to set up

a table in White Plaza, he and
other members — who he claims
are just as furious as he — would
get us kicked off campus.
Why is SCR so adamant
about silencing a progressive
Republican movement at Stan
ford and trying to use intimida
tion tactics to do so? Two years
ago, junior Joe Fairbanks himself
started a new Republican group
at Stanford because he didn't
feel that the established one was
reflective of Republican beliefs.
SCR, on its Web site, claims the
Stanford Conservative Union as
a sister organization. Why can't
the RYM be afforded the same
hospitality? Setting up the RYM
at Stanford is not divisive; it's an
addition to the current Republi
can presence on campus. What is
divisive is Fairbanks' statement
in Friday's article that "another
organization such as the RYM
on campus would merely be re
dundant and ineffective." It is
just as critical to have an inclu
sive college Republican group
such as SCR that can hold up the
big tent and welcome new
groups of all ideologies as it is to
have an outreach group like the
RYM to broadcast and recruit
with the pro-choice, pro-envi
ronment and fiscally conserva
tive messages.
We assured Sensenbrenner
that we would be in White Plaza
Monday morning at 10 a.m.
We are quite sure that Stan
ford students will not choose to
back SCR in its effort to restrict
which political messages will be

allowed on campus. It is not un
usual for political organizations
to recruit and organize on cam
pus. SCR itself has advertised
these partisan activities using
Stanford-hosted Web sites and
e-mail lists.
We would also like to respond
to President of the Stanford
Democrats Dylan Mefford's com
ments in the same article that stu
dents attracted to the RYM's plat
forms should consider joining the
Democratic Party or starting their
own political party, because it will
be very difficult to change the Re
publican Party to suit their inter
ests. RYM is currently changing
the Republican Party. Does Mef
ford think that being pro-choice
and pro-environment are exclu
sively Democratic qualities? He
should tell that to National Securi
ty Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Sec
retary of State Colin Powell, Gov
ernor of California Arnold
Schwarzenegger, former Mayor of
New York City Rudy Giuliani and
former Governor of California
Pete Wilson. If Mefford is secure in
the strength of the beliefs of the
Democratic members at Stanford,
he should feel not threatened, but
excited about a progressive Re
publican group, because it adds
political diversity. Isn't that the
point of social politics?
