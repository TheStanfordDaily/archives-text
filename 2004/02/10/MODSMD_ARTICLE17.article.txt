USA PATRIOT Act defended
The op-ed regarding the USA
PATRIOT Act ("Students criti
cize PATRIOT Act," Feb. 9) is
ignorant of the facts regarding
the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion's powers and only serves to
obscure the truth.
1) Probable cause has never
been a standard for opening an
FBI investigation. It has never
been a required standard for
conducting physical surveil
lance. It still is the required stan
dard for conducting electronic
surveillance. In fact, because of
the requirements for wiretaps, I
would argue the standard is
higher than probable cause.
2) All wiretaps require a court
order signed by a judge whether
that be for criminal wiretaps or
intelligence wiretaps. There are
no warrant-less wiretaps because
of the USA PATRIOT Act.
3) The power to access medi
cal, financial and even library
records has been in the power of
law enforcement long before the
USA PATRIOT Act was enact
ed. In fact, I understand library
records helped catch the Un
abomber.
4) Sneak-and-peek search
warrants have been used for sev
eral years, usually in organized
crime investigations.
5) Delaying notice of the exe
cution of a warrant has to be ap
proved by a judge and has been
in practice for several years.
6) Section 802, which is cited
in the op-ed as defining terror
ism as an attempt to "influence
the policy of a government by in
timidation or coercion" applies
to domes'tic terrorism. These in
vestigations generally involve
such groups as the Ku Klux Klan
and other racist hate groups. If
people at Stanford are involved
with these groups, they may
want to take a look at the provi
sion to make sure they're not
supporting terrorism.
The FBI conducts both coun
terterrorism / intelligence and
criminal investigations. The ex
amples cited in the op-ed as
"alarming" have been used for
years in criminal investigations.
The USA PATRIOT Act simply
allows the FBI to use the same
tools for counterterrorism / intel
ligence investigations as it has for
criminal investigations. In fact,
the requirements are still more
stringent for the counterterror

ism / intelligence investigations.
There have been expansions
of law enforcement powers. One
example is the ability to conduct
a "roving" wiretap. This is a
good provision because people
who engage in criminal activity
or plan to conduct terrorist acts
have a tendency to "dump" their
phones so that wiretaps are dis
continued because — contrary
to the op-ed — wiretaps require
a warrant.
Finally, the op-ed writers are
deluded if they believe that the
FBI has either the time or the in
terest to waste its time looking
into who's reading "Lady Chat
terly's Lover" or looking for
knitting needles.
There may be provisions of
the USA PATRIOT Act that
should be more clearly defined.
Doing that will require reasoned
debate based upon facts, not
alarmist rhetoric designed to
perpetuate ignorance.

I believe that the op-ed The
Daily chose to run yesterday on
the USA PATRIOT Act ("Stu
dents criticize PATRIOT Act,"
Feb. 9) was easily one of the
most intellectually inept to ap
pear in the paper since I arrived
on campus in the fall.
The article fails to wrangle the
slightest veneer of scholarship,
instead it resorts to crass humor
and unsubstantiated claims
about the overpowering nature
of the Bush administration. The
claim that the Bush administra
tion "capitalized on widespread
fears in order to forcefully
steamroll the USA PATRIOT
Act through Congress" is devoid
of any factual basis. The authors
choose to ignore that no matter
how evil they may think Presi
dent George W. Bush is,
Congress still has to vote on the
legislation. Lawmakers (both
liberal and conservative) were
not concerned with the USA
PATRIOT Act at the time; they
were concerned about terrorism.
It is absolutely laughable that
The Daily would allow the au
thors to say that the administra
tion "stifled opposition" to the
bill without any support for such
an unsubstantiated claim. Such
partisan rhetoric is better re
served for the stump speeches of
candidates running for the

Democratic nomination, not for
any publication that hopes to be
a paper of repute.
I realize that the authors are
extremely frightened by the no
tion of sneak-and-peek searches,
but any rudimentary under
standing of the criminal justice
system (or better yet, a viewing
of one episode of the television
show "The Sopranos") would let
them know that this tactic has
been used to fight organized
crime for quite some time. It's
good to see that the Stanford
Community for Peace and Jus
tice, an organization devoted to
peace and justice, is more con
cerned with the civil liberties of
Mohammad Atta than John
Gotti.
I would like to know if the au
thors have actually bothered to
read the SAFE Act, which
would repeal the "troublesome"
parts of the USA PATRIOT Act
according to the op-ed. The au
thors do not say what these trou
blesome parts are, and they
choose to refer to the SAFE Act
as "controversial," whereas the
USA PATRIOT Act, because it
was drafted by Republicans, is
troubling.
The authors take great offense
at the idea that the USA PATRI
OT Act could be used to check li
brary records, yet the U.S.De
partment of Justice has released
this information, and this provi
sion has never been used. Finally,
the fact that the authors would
cite section 802(b) is laughable.
Would they rather people be
able to influence the actions of
the government through intimi
dation or coercion? If the right of
someone to threaten or coerce
lawmakers is a civil liberty this
group is fighting for, I will happi
ly forgo membership.
Stanford students deserve
better articles than this; this ar
ticle should never have run.
There are many good argu
ments both for and against the
USA PATRIOT Act, but sadly,
this op-ed contained none of
them. Ultimately though, if we
repeal the USA PATRIOT Act
and we are attacked again by
terrorists, are any of us going to
be able to take comfort in the
fact that at least the next band
of terrorists didn't have their
civil liberties violated?

choose to refer to the SAFE Act
as "controversial," whereas the
USA PATRIOT Act, because it
was drafted by Republicans, is
troubling.
The authors take great offense
at the idea that the USA PATRI
OT Act could be used to check li
brary records, yet the U.S.De
partment of Justice has released
this information, and this provi
sion has never been used. Finally,
the fact that the authors would
cite section 802(b) is laughable.
Would they rather people be
able to influence the actions of
the government through intimi
dation or coercion? If the right of
someone to threaten or coerce
lawmakers is a civil liberty this
group is fighting for, I will happi

Stanford students deserve
better articles than this; this ar
ticle should never have run.
There are many good argu
ments both for and against the
USA PATRIOT Act, but sadly,
this op-ed contained none of
them. Ultimately though, if we
repeal the USA PATRIOT Act
and we are attacked again by
terrorists, are any of us going to
be able to take comfort in the
fact that at least the next band
of terrorists didn't have their
civil liberties violated?

USA PATRIOT Act defended
The op-ed regarding the USA
PATRIOT Act ("Students criti
cize PATRIOT Act," Feb. 9) is
ignorant of the facts regarding
the Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion's powers and only serves to
obscure the truth.
1) Probable cause has never
been a standard for opening an
FBI investigation. It has never
been a required standard for
conducting physical surveil
lance. It still is the required stan
dard for conducting electronic
surveillance. In fact, because of
the requirements for wiretaps, I
would argue the standard is
higher than probable cause.
2) All wiretaps require a court
order signed by a judge whether
that be for criminal wiretaps or
intelligence wiretaps. There are
no warrant-less wiretaps because
of the USA PATRIOT Act.
3) The power to access medi
cal, financial and even library
records has been in the power of
law enforcement long before the
USA PATRIOT Act was enact
ed. In fact, I understand library
records helped catch the Un
abomber.
4) Sneak-and-peek search
warrants have been used for sev
eral years, usually in organized
crime investigations.
5) Delaying notice of the exe
cution of a warrant has to be ap
proved by a judge and has been
in practice for several years.
6) Section 802, which is cited
in the op-ed as defining terror
ism as an attempt to "influence
the policy of a government by in
timidation or coercion" applies
to domes'tic terrorism. These in
vestigations generally involve
such groups as the Ku Klux Klan
and other racist hate groups. If
people at Stanford are involved
with these groups, they may
want to take a look at the provi
sion to make sure they're not
supporting terrorism.
The FBI conducts both coun
terterrorism / intelligence and
criminal investigations. The ex
amples cited in the op-ed as
"alarming" have been used for
years in criminal investigations.
The USA PATRIOT Act simply
allows the FBI to use the same
tools for counterterrorism / intel
ligence investigations as it has for
criminal investigations. In fact,
the requirements are still more
stringent for the counterterror

ism / intelligence investigations.
There have been expansions
of law enforcement powers. One
example is the ability to conduct
a "roving" wiretap. This is a
good provision because people
who engage in criminal activity
or plan to conduct terrorist acts
have a tendency to "dump" their
phones so that wiretaps are dis
continued because — contrary
to the op-ed — wiretaps require
a warrant.
Finally, the op-ed writers are
deluded if they believe that the
FBI has either the time or the in
terest to waste its time looking
into who's reading "Lady Chat
terly's Lover" or looking for
knitting needles.
There may be provisions of
the USA PATRIOT Act that
should be more clearly defined.
Doing that will require reasoned
debate based upon facts, not
alarmist rhetoric designed to
perpetuate ignorance.

I believe that the op-ed The
Daily chose to run yesterday on
the USA PATRIOT Act ("Stu
dents criticize PATRIOT Act,"
Feb. 9) was easily one of the
most intellectually inept to ap
pear in the paper since I arrived
on campus in the fall.
The article fails to wrangle the
slightest veneer of scholarship,
instead it resorts to crass humor
and unsubstantiated claims
about the overpowering nature
of the Bush administration. The
claim that the Bush administra
tion "capitalized on widespread
fears in order to forcefully
steamroll the USA PATRIOT
Act through Congress" is devoid
of any factual basis. The authors
choose to ignore that no matter
how evil they may think Presi
dent George W. Bush is,
Congress still has to vote on the
legislation. Lawmakers (both
liberal and conservative) were
not concerned with the USA
PATRIOT Act at the time; they
were concerned about terrorism.
It is absolutely laughable that
The Daily would allow the au
thors to say that the administra
tion "stifled opposition" to the
bill without any support for such
an unsubstantiated claim. Such
partisan rhetoric is better re
served for the stump speeches of
candidates running for the

Democratic nomination, not for
any publication that hopes to be
a paper of repute.
I realize that the authors are
extremely frightened by the no
tion of sneak-and-peek searches,
but any rudimentary under
standing of the criminal justice
system (or better yet, a viewing
of one episode of the television
show "The Sopranos") would let
them know that this tactic has
been used to fight organized
crime for quite some time. It's
good to see that the Stanford
Community for Peace and Jus
tice, an organization devoted to
peace and justice, is more con
cerned with the civil liberties of
Mohammad Atta than John
Gotti.
I would like to know if the au
thors have actually bothered to
read the SAFE Act, which
would repeal the "troublesome"
parts of the USA PATRIOT Act
according to the op-ed. The au
thors do not say what these trou
blesome parts are, and they
choose to refer to the SAFE Act
as "controversial," whereas the
