## University needs to be more active in providing student group funds 
### ERIC SHIH JEROLD A. BLAIN 
The current situation facing the
ASSU's special-fees system has forced a
number of student organizations to con
sider their financial security both for the
present and for long-term planning.
For over 30 years, special fees has
been an independent funding system
through which quarterly fees are dis
tributed to support student groups and
student life at Stanford. It is through this
system that student groups (including
those that receive "general fees"
through the legislative bodies) gain the
financial support necessary to provide
valuable services and annual events on
campus that many of us take for grant
ed. The system is particularly important
because other options for funding —
such as off-campus sources, The Stan
ford Fund or University departments —
are not as dependable or viable as spe
cial fees. Another crucial aspect of the
special-fees system is that it grants stu
dents full autonomy over the allocation
and distribution of their fees and also al

lows organizations to control their own
budgets in planning their activities.
Student groups receiving special fees
create and support the great majority of
student life at Stanford. Stanford would
simply not be Stanford without the
Stanford Powwow, the Art Affair, the
Band Run, Stanford in Government
(SIG) internships, student publications
like The Stanford Daily and The Cha
parral, Black Liberation Month, Asian-
Pacific Islanders Heritage Month, Cesar
Chavez Commemoration and many
more events.
This campus would also not be the
same without the organizations that put
on these events and provide these ser
vices. In fact, it is because of groups like
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts, the Stanford Band, SIG, The
Daily, The Chaparral, Black Student
Union, Asian American Students Asso
ciation and MEChA that students at
Stanford can enjoy the vibrant, diverse
and dynamic community that we've
come to expect and appreciate during
our time here. Student life is an essential

aspect of the
reputation
and prestige
of our Uni
versity. It at
tracts a di
verse and
talented
body of stu
dents, who
arrive at
Stanford
with the ex
pectation
that they will

be supported in their pursuit of excel
lence both inside and outside of the class
room. Many students consider what goes
on outside of the classroom not simply as
"extracurricular," but rather, as an inte
gral part of their Stanford education and
experience.
When alumni look back at their time
here, their fondest memories are often
of the time they spent serving their com
munities, staying up late to meet publi
cation deadlines or creating art and per
forming for their friends and peers.
These alumni continue to support this
institution in the hope that current stu
dents enjoy the same opportunities and
experiences that they did while they
were here.
There is no doubt that the University
benefits from the activities and services
provided by the student groups that re
ceive special fees. They not only make
the University a more competitive and
attractive place for prospective students
but also play a large role in crafting the
Stanford experience and the student life
that exists here.
In further examination of the current
state of the special-fees system and the
staggering rise in the quarterly ASSU
student group fee, there are two things
that are readily apparent. First, a larger
number of groups utilize and are drawn
to the special fees system as the most vi
able source of funding. Second, groups
need more funding to provide the ser
vices and activities that have become in
valuable to the diverse Stanford com
munity. Anyone familiar with special
fees groups knows that a large percent
age of the requested funds go toward
paying University costs such as Event
and Labor Services, ABM Janitorial

Services, facilities rental, equipment
rental and security. We fully recognize
that these campus divisions must be
paid for services rendered; however, we
are questioning whether, for the most
part, these costs are covered through
student taxation.
We do not advocate a reduction in
the number of groups or activities, but
rather, we hope to find a way to work
with the University in sharing a greater
portion of the burden for an active stu
dent life. The ways in which the Univer
sity currently supports student initia
tives tends to be sporadic and ad hoc,
with little consistency or transparency.
The majority of student groups suffer
because this avenue of funding is time
and energy-intensive and does not offer
the stability or autonomy necessary for
long-term event planning.
Recognizing the importance of spe
cial-fees organizations, we would like to
see the University play a more active
role in supporting student life and activ
ities. We question whether it is fair that
students must tax themselves above and
beyond the already-high University tu
ition and bills to support the great ma
jority of student activities at Stanford,
especially when such a large portion of
that tax goes directly to pay University
related expenses.
With the special-fees situation as ur
gent as it is, we think that now is an ideal
time for discussions about other possi
ble methods for funding student life —
such as matching funds, subsidizing Uni
versity costs and bolstering The Stan
ford Fund (while making it more stu
dent-friendly). Any discussion of fund
ing must take into consideration both
the unique difficulty for students living

in the relatively-isolated Stanford com
munity to find off-campus support, as
well as the importance of maintaining
student autonomy in the allocation of
funds and planning of activities.
Both students and the University
have a vested interest in maintaining
and improving our current level of stu
dent life and activities. We cannot imag
ine Stanford without special -fees orga
nizations and the diverse and exciting
activities that they provide. If the Uni
versity does not deeply and sincerely
commit to providing additional avenues
of support for student life and our stu
dent organizations, we will all be faced
with the loss of vital student services
and activities. Already, impending re
striction of special fees budgets will
force student groups, and not the Uni
versity, to take further responsibility for
student life.
We ask the University: Can academic
excellence, athletic achievement and all
other things that make Stanford special
exist without a thriving and well-sup
ported student life? The first two alone
do not make fora Stanford experience
that can, attract the best and the bright
est from around the world, nor can they
create a strong and healthy Stanford
community that enables students to
reach their full potential. We call for the
University to offer greater support with
student activities and student life.

versity costs and bolstering The Stan
ford Fund (while making it more stu
dent-friendly). Any discussion of fund
ing must take into consideration both
the unique difficulty for students living

in the relatively-isolated Stanford com
munity to find off-campus support, as
well as the importance of maintaining
student autonomy in the allocation of
funds and planning of activities.
Both students and the University
have a vested interest in maintaining
and improving our current level of stu
dent life and activities. We cannot imag
ine Stanford without special -fees orga
nizations and the diverse and exciting
activities that they provide. If the Uni
versity does not deeply and sincerely
commit to providing additional avenues
of support for student life and our stu
dent organizations, we will all be faced
with the loss of vital student services
and activities. Already, impending re
striction of special fees budgets will
force student groups, and not the Uni
versity, to take further responsibility for
student life.
We ask the University: Can academic
excellence, athletic achievement and all
other things that make Stanford special
exist without a thriving and well-sup
ported student life? The first two alone
do not make fora Stanford experience
that can, attract the best and the bright
est from around the world, nor can they
create a strong and healthy Stanford
community that enables students to
reach their full potential. We call for the
University to offer greater support with
student activities and student life.

The current situation facing the
ASSU's special-fees system has forced a
number of student organizations to con
sider their financial security both for the
present and for long-term planning.
For over 30 years, special fees has
been an independent funding system
through which quarterly fees are dis
tributed to support student groups and
student life at Stanford. It is through this
system that student groups (including
those that receive "general fees"
through the legislative bodies) gain the
financial support necessary to provide
valuable services and annual events on
campus that many of us take for grant
ed. The system is particularly important
because other options for funding —
such as off-campus sources, The Stan
ford Fund or University departments —
are not as dependable or viable as spe
cial fees. Another crucial aspect of the
special-fees system is that it grants stu
dents full autonomy over the allocation
and distribution of their fees and also al

lows organizations to control their own
budgets in planning their activities.
Student groups receiving special fees
create and support the great majority of
student life at Stanford. Stanford would
simply not be Stanford without the
Stanford Powwow, the Art Affair, the
Band Run, Stanford in Government
(SIG) internships, student publications
like The Stanford Daily and The Cha
parral, Black Liberation Month, Asian-
Pacific Islanders Heritage Month, Cesar
Chavez Commemoration and many
more events.
This campus would also not be the
same without the organizations that put
on these events and provide these ser
vices. In fact, it is because of groups like
the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts, the Stanford Band, SIG, The
Daily, The Chaparral, Black Student
Union, Asian American Students Asso
ciation and MEChA that students at
Stanford can enjoy the vibrant, diverse
and dynamic community that we've
come to expect and appreciate during
our time here. Student life is an essential

aspect of the
reputation
and prestige
of our Uni
versity. It at
tracts a di
verse and
talented
body of stu
dents, who
arrive at
Stanford
with the ex
pectation
that they will

be supported in their pursuit of excel
lence both inside and outside of the class
room. Many students consider what goes
on outside of the classroom not simply as
"extracurricular," but rather, as an inte
gral part of their Stanford education and
experience.
When alumni look back at their time
here, their fondest memories are often
of the time they spent serving their com
munities, staying up late to meet publi
cation deadlines or creating art and per
forming for their friends and peers.
These alumni continue to support this
institution in the hope that current stu
dents enjoy the same opportunities and
experiences that they did while they
were here.
There is no doubt that the University
benefits from the activities and services
provided by the student groups that re
ceive special fees. They not only make
the University a more competitive and
attractive place for prospective students
but also play a large role in crafting the
Stanford experience and the student life
that exists here.
In further examination of the current
state of the special-fees system and the
staggering rise in the quarterly ASSU
student group fee, there are two things
that are readily apparent. First, a larger
number of groups utilize and are drawn
to the special fees system as the most vi
able source of funding. Second, groups
need more funding to provide the ser
vices and activities that have become in
valuable to the diverse Stanford com
munity. Anyone familiar with special
fees groups knows that a large percent
age of the requested funds go toward
paying University costs such as Event
and Labor Services, ABM Janitorial

Services, facilities rental, equipment
rental and security. We fully recognize
that these campus divisions must be
paid for services rendered; however, we
are questioning whether, for the most
part, these costs are covered through
student taxation.
We do not advocate a reduction in
the number of groups or activities, but
rather, we hope to find a way to work
with the University in sharing a greater
portion of the burden for an active stu
dent life. The ways in which the Univer
sity currently supports student initia
tives tends to be sporadic and ad hoc,
with little consistency or transparency.
The majority of student groups suffer
because this avenue of funding is time
and energy-intensive and does not offer
the stability or autonomy necessary for
long-term event planning.
Recognizing the importance of spe
cial-fees organizations, we would like to
see the University play a more active
role in supporting student life and activ
ities. We question whether it is fair that
students must tax themselves above and
beyond the already-high University tu
ition and bills to support the great ma
jority of student activities at Stanford,
especially when such a large portion of
that tax goes directly to pay University
related expenses.
With the special-fees situation as ur
gent as it is, we think that now is an ideal
time for discussions about other possi
ble methods for funding student life —
such as matching funds, subsidizing Uni
versity costs and bolstering The Stan
ford Fund (while making it more stu
dent-friendly). Any discussion of fund
ing must take into consideration both
