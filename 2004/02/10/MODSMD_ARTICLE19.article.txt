## Spencer misses you — and the Arizona game 
### 
Four seconds left on the clock. Huge
game. Ranked opponent. Undefeated
season on the line. Stanford has the ball
in the hands of a gtxxj sh(x>ter but not in
the place we'd like it to be on the court.
Three seconds.
The ball leaves the shooter's hand, everyone in
the stadium freezes. It's a prayer of a floater — a
bad angle, bad distance, off-balance longshot of
finding the net.
Splash.
My living room exploded. I screamed, my
brother yelled, my dad laughed a little bit. It was
an improbable comeback to cap an outstanding
game and, after a failed Jason Williams coast-to
coast layup, Stanford had reeled off a huge upset
and kept its undefeated season intact.
Wait, wait, wait. Jason Williams?
You see, when I was applying to college three
years ago, No. 3 Stanford played No. 1 Duke at
the Pete Newell Challenge and won on a Casey

Jacobsen long-distance
glancer off the glass with 3.6
seconds left.
And as soon as that shot
banked in, as soon as I saw
Tiger Woods jumping for joy
courtside, as soon as Stanford
looked like the tournament
favorite, this young aspiring
writer decided, before even
getting his acceptance letter.

that he was going to attend Leland Stanford Ju
nior University. It was that simple. If Casey had
missed that shot, I would be writing this column
for the Haverford paper.
Why bring this up, you ask? Why dwell on the
past? Why not give the current Stanford basket
ball team its due?
To answer, I have to admit something. I'm
very sorry, but I've duped all of you. I've deceived
you, I've lied to you. And not a "Return of the
Mack" sort of lie, not an "I did not have sex with
that woman" sort of lie, not even a "Melrose
Place" "Don't worry, baby, I'm on the pill" sort of
lie. This is a very real lie.
You see, unlike the serial groper, I am not "on
campus" this quarter.
I am in Oxford.
I didn't see the game.
And I hate it.
Well, no, Oxford is cool, but honestly, less than
three basketball seasons away from the reason
why I came to this damn school, and I choose to
go abroad during the one they decide to go 20-0!
Are you kidding me?
So, now all I get to see are highlights — 45 sec
onds of content provided by ESPN.com (and
thank God for that) —of a Lottich three, a Chil
dress layup, a Stoudamire drive, a Childress three
and the shot.
But do I get a bouncing floor to jump on? Do
I get to hold a sign that says "Number of women
Dickie V. slept with at age 20 — 0!"? Do I get to
stare at Tiger Wcxxls' fiancee for the greater part
of the first half?
NO.
All I see and read are photo galleries,
ESPN.com and Stanford Daily columns.
And let me tell you, it isn't all pretty.
While the basketball team has me yearning to
be in the second row at Maples, there are some
things that make me happy to distance myself
from the general Stanford atmosphere.
1) I don't know who was in charge of the "No.
1 Academics + No. 1 Basketball = No. 1 Cardinal"
sign that was held in the Sixth Man Club, but I
hope I never meet you. That is how much I hate
that sign. In the worst display of sign-making abil
ities ever — let me repeat: EVER, you embodied
all the negative stereotypes of Stanford students:
arrogance, sports apathy, one-dimensional aca
demic minds and a total lack of humor.
2) Tiger Woods. Now I know it may be blas
phemous to rip the greatest golfer in history when
he's from your school, but man. wow. I love that
he came, I love that he wore the Sixth Man shirt, I
love that he spoke to the team after the game.
And, of course, I love that he brought his fiancee.
All class. I love Tiger, I really do, which is why it
pains me so to see a photo gallery with his shirt
tucked in. Pains me! Let yourself go. Tiger! Enjoy
yourself! Honestly, he looked like he was a couple
steps away from wearing a pocket protector. Poor
guy
-3) Finally, Julie Ruvolo. Oh, Julie. Oh, Julie.
For those of you unfamiliar with Julie "I hate
sports" Ruvolo, she is the Friday columnist, who
just this past week could not understand why peo
ple play for teams. She has dropped such lines as,
"But I cannot wrap my (inflated) head around the
idea of putting the team before yourself," "What
I can't relate to [arej... Sixth Man members who
obsessively get their friends to take their IDs to
basketball games so they can gain points' and 're
wards' when they can't make a game" and my
personal favorite, "I don't follow baseball, or any
other professional sport for that matter, because I
hate spectating" (emphasis added).
Oh. Julie. I am some 6,000-or-so miles away
from the Stanford campus. Away from all the
glory that a 20-0 season brings, away from slam
dunks, offensive boards and the sublimely mun
dane assist-to-turnover ratios. I can't watch most
of the games, can't see Chris Hernandez find the
open man on the perimeter, can't see Joe Kir-


Spencer Porter
chofer being the most energetic man
on the floor while riding the bench,
can't see Matt Lottich taking a
charge.
But Julie, I can see that this team, let
me emphasize, TEAM, is made up of
no individuals. And when this team
made a pact not to get bullied athleti
cally after its last loss (in last year's
NCAA tourney to UConn), after this
team went the first half of the year
without its "star" and still won, after
this team won its biggest game of the
season on a three-pointer by a third
stringer, it reminded me of that 2000-
01 team.
Like I said, when I was a senior in
high school, I saw how a basketball
team could make me want to be a part
of a community. It's simple really:
Casey Jacobsen's last-second game
winner made me want to come to
Stanford. Nick Robinson's bomb
made me want to come back.

-3) Finally, Julie Ruvolo. Oh, Julie. Oh, Julie.
For those of you unfamiliar with Julie "I hate
sports" Ruvolo, she is the Friday columnist, who
just this past week could not understand why peo
ple play for teams. She has dropped such lines as,
"But I cannot wrap my (inflated) head around the
idea of putting the team before yourself," "What
I can't relate to [arej... Sixth Man members who
obsessively get their friends to take their IDs to
basketball games so they can gain points' and 're
wards' when they can't make a game" and my
personal favorite, "I don't follow baseball, or any
other professional sport for that matter, because I
hate spectating" (emphasis added).
Oh. Julie. I am some 6,000-or-so miles away
from the Stanford campus. Away from all the
glory that a 20-0 season brings, away from slam
dunks, offensive boards and the sublimely mun
dane assist-to-turnover ratios. I can't watch most
of the games, can't see Chris Hernandez find the
open man on the perimeter, can't see Joe Kir-


Spencer Porter
chofer being the most energetic man
on the floor while riding the bench,
can't see Matt Lottich taking a
charge.
But Julie, I can see that this team, let
me emphasize, TEAM, is made up of
no individuals. And when this team
made a pact not to get bullied athleti
cally after its last loss (in last year's
NCAA tourney to UConn), after this
team went the first half of the year
without its "star" and still won, after
this team won its biggest game of the
season on a three-pointer by a third
stringer, it reminded me of that 2000-
01 team.
Like I said, when I was a senior in
high school, I saw how a basketball
team could make me want to be a part
of a community. It's simple really:
Casey Jacobsen's last-second game
winner made me want to come to
Stanford. Nick Robinson's bomb
made me want to come back.

Four seconds left on the clock. Huge
game. Ranked opponent. Undefeated
season on the line. Stanford has the ball
in the hands of a gtxxj sh(x>ter but not in
the place we'd like it to be on the court.
Three seconds.
The ball leaves the shooter's hand, everyone in
the stadium freezes. It's a prayer of a floater — a
bad angle, bad distance, off-balance longshot of
finding the net.
Splash.
My living room exploded. I screamed, my
brother yelled, my dad laughed a little bit. It was
an improbable comeback to cap an outstanding
game and, after a failed Jason Williams coast-to
coast layup, Stanford had reeled off a huge upset
and kept its undefeated season intact.
Wait, wait, wait. Jason Williams?
You see, when I was applying to college three
years ago, No. 3 Stanford played No. 1 Duke at
the Pete Newell Challenge and won on a Casey

Jacobsen long-distance
glancer off the glass with 3.6
seconds left.
And as soon as that shot
banked in, as soon as I saw
Tiger Woods jumping for joy
courtside, as soon as Stanford
looked like the tournament
favorite, this young aspiring
writer decided, before even
getting his acceptance letter.

that he was going to attend Leland Stanford Ju
nior University. It was that simple. If Casey had
missed that shot, I would be writing this column
for the Haverford paper.
Why bring this up, you ask? Why dwell on the
past? Why not give the current Stanford basket
ball team its due?
To answer, I have to admit something. I'm
very sorry, but I've duped all of you. I've deceived
you, I've lied to you. And not a "Return of the
Mack" sort of lie, not an "I did not have sex with
that woman" sort of lie, not even a "Melrose
Place" "Don't worry, baby, I'm on the pill" sort of
lie. This is a very real lie.
You see, unlike the serial groper, I am not "on
campus" this quarter.
I am in Oxford.
I didn't see the game.
And I hate it.
Well, no, Oxford is cool, but honestly, less than
three basketball seasons away from the reason
why I came to this damn school, and I choose to
go abroad during the one they decide to go 20-0!
Are you kidding me?
So, now all I get to see are highlights — 45 sec
onds of content provided by ESPN.com (and
thank God for that) —of a Lottich three, a Chil
dress layup, a Stoudamire drive, a Childress three
and the shot.
But do I get a bouncing floor to jump on? Do
I get to hold a sign that says "Number of women
Dickie V. slept with at age 20 — 0!"? Do I get to
stare at Tiger Wcxxls' fiancee for the greater part
of the first half?
NO.
All I see and read are photo galleries,
ESPN.com and Stanford Daily columns.
And let me tell you, it isn't all pretty.
While the basketball team has me yearning to
be in the second row at Maples, there are some
things that make me happy to distance myself
from the general Stanford atmosphere.
1) I don't know who was in charge of the "No.
1 Academics + No. 1 Basketball = No. 1 Cardinal"
sign that was held in the Sixth Man Club, but I
hope I never meet you. That is how much I hate
that sign. In the worst display of sign-making abil
ities ever — let me repeat: EVER, you embodied
all the negative stereotypes of Stanford students:
arrogance, sports apathy, one-dimensional aca
demic minds and a total lack of humor.
2) Tiger Woods. Now I know it may be blas
phemous to rip the greatest golfer in history when
he's from your school, but man. wow. I love that
he came, I love that he wore the Sixth Man shirt, I
love that he spoke to the team after the game.
And, of course, I love that he brought his fiancee.
All class. I love Tiger, I really do, which is why it
pains me so to see a photo gallery with his shirt
tucked in. Pains me! Let yourself go. Tiger! Enjoy
yourself! Honestly, he looked like he was a couple
steps away from wearing a pocket protector. Poor
guy
