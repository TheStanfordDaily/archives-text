## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Lending insight into the presiden
tial primaries and the administration
of California Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger, local Assembly
man Joe Simitian, who represents the
21st district, spoke to the Stanford
Democrats last night and asked for
students' help in the upcoming state
senate primary election.
On May 2, Simitian will compete
with former Assemblyman Ted Lem
pert for the state senate nomination.
According to the San Jose Mercury
News, Simitian was ahead in the polls
as of Feb. 3. Simitian has also gar
nered the endorsements of the Cali
fornia Democratic Party, United
Farm Workers and the National Or
ganization of Women.
Referring to the next three
weeks as "crunch time," Simitian at
tended the Stanford Democrats
meeting to discuss a range of politi
cal issues and recruit campaign
workers. Sharing pizza with stu
dents, he said there is a high demand
for precinct-walkers and phone
bankers. Several Stanford Democ
rats have already signed onto his
campaign as interns and volunteers.
"Who are my original Kerry sup
porters?" Simitian asked to open the
meeting on a light note. "Are you sur
prised?"
He returned to the topic of the
presidential primary several times.
"We'll end up with one good nom
inee who will be a lot better than who
we have in there now," he said. "The
choices and issues are so stark. We're
lucky to have lively competition out
there."
Delving into his own campaign, he
told those gathered that he wasn't
going to take his lead for granted.
"Just to tell you how old I am, I
had a disappointing experience when
I worked for Gene McCarthy, and I
had the same experience working for
George McGovern," he said. "You
just got to suck it up and keep on
going. If you step away from the
process fora minute, the bad guys can
come in and take control."
If Simitian loses the primary to

Lempert, it will be his first time out of
office in 21 years.
"1 don't know what I would do,"
he said. "Probably take up gardening
or something."
After his speech, Simitian
opened the floor to questions con
cerning his views on a variety of
prominent issues in California pol
itics. In addressing a query about
stem-cell research, he stressed Cal
ifornia's impact on federal legisla
tion.
"The Federal government has
taken steps away from stem-cell re
search so funding has dried up,"
Simitian said. "As is the case with
many issues, California will have to
lead the charge. California is a place
of new ideas... If any change is
made, it's going to have to happen
state-by-state, and California might
start the national trend."
During his tenure, Simitian fo
cused on issues of privacy in tech
nology, including identity theft and
student protections. A bill he au
thored drew the attention of U.S.
Senator Dianne Feinstein who of
fered it as a possible national
model.
In addition to these issues, Simit
ian also discussed the feasibility of e
voting and his campaign to combat
water pollution caused by cruise
lines.
When asked if he thought the Re
publicans would win more seats in the
California State Legislature, Simitian
said, "They won't get a majority in ei
ther house, but they may pick up
ground."
He explained that this small gain is
more significant than it seems since
the Democrats barely hold a majority
of 48 seats out of 80.
"You might think that you only
need 41 seats, but then again you
won't get every Democrat on every
bill," Simitian said. "On an important
piece of domestic-partners legislation
this year, 41 voted 'aye' on the bill. If
you lose one or two people on that bill,
we don't make progress on that issue."
According to Simitian, this might
also affect issues of choice, civil rights
