# Women clinch 7th indoor title
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team
(6-0) dominated the competition this weekend
at the USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championships and brought home the title for
a record seventh time.
In the tournament's 17-year-history, only
four teams have clinched elusive final victory.
With its stunning Sunday morning defeat of
Georgia at Wisconsin's A.C. Nielsen Tennis
Stadium, the top-seeded Cardinal surpassed
current NCAA champion, top-ranked Florida,
in number of titles won.
The Gators stand at six victories, followed
by Georgia (3) and Duke (1).
Claiming the 2004 Team Indoor title also
comes as vindication for the Cardinal, which
fell to Georgia in 2002's finals. 4-3 — the only
loss that national championship squad would
suffer. Last year. Stanford fell, 4-3 again, to
rival No. 3 California in the semifinals.
Playing in the No. 5 singles position, fresh
man Theresa Logar outlasted Georgia's Jitka
Schonfeldova 6-0,3-6,6-4 to seal the match for
Stanford, 5-0.
Logar, who is ranked 84th in the nation, re
calls the tension and frenzy surrounding her
final match.
"The crowd was going crazy and so were my
teammates," Logar said. "I was [so] nervous
[at that moment], I have no idea how I played
that point. It was long, but I [finally] went fora
forehand putaway and she couldn't return it.
That's when the team went nuts."
After an easy win in the first set, Logar let
the second set slip away and struggled in the
third, as unranked Schonfeldova fought back
from a 5-2 deficit, bringing the match to 5-4 in
Stanford's favor.
"The biggest challenge for me was simply

rising to the occasion," Logar said of her first
collegiate team tournament. "I didn't play
doubles, so I had to watch and get all nervous
and freaked out before I had to play. I had to
make sure that I was mentally ready to do my
job before I stepped out on the court. And
that's a lot tougher than you'd think."
Despite posting a substantial 5-0 defeat of
No. 4 Georgia, which was seeded second at the
Team Indoors, Stanford had no easy task be
fore them in the finals.
"Georgia was tough and I think it would
have been a lot tougher had we not won the
doubles point, which we could have easily
lost," Logar said.
Heading Stanford's doubles lineup, top
ranked senior Lauren Barnikow and junior
Erin Burdette battled long and hard before
overcoming Georgia's No. 4 Agata Cioroch
and Shadisha Robinson, 9-7, to claim the dou
bles point for the Cardinal.
Cioroch, a senior, is the nation's top-ranked
player in singles and holds an impressive 18-3
doubles record with Robinson, a freshman
who is already ranked No. 12 in singles.
Playing in the third doubles spot, the No. 17
team of senior Emilia Anderson and freshman
Anne Yelsey defeated Douglas Wink and Na
talie Frazier, 8-5.
The No. 2 doubles match went undecided,
as Stanford's Amber Liu and Alice Barnes,
both sophomores, were neck and neck with
Schonfeldova and Evgenia Subbotina, 8-8,
when Stanford secured the doubles point, halt
ing their match.
Liu returned to dual match play for Stan
ford after devoting the individual season to
professional circuit competition. Despite suf
fering a stunning first-round loss last Thursday
to William and Mary's No. 76 Megan Muth,

Stanford senior Emilia Anderson defeated No. 2 Georgia's Alex Smith 6-1, 6-0 to help
the No. 1 women's tennis team to its seventh National Team Indoor Championships title.
Liu remained optimistic.
'it was rough to start out the sea
son with a loss," Liu said of her 6-3,
3-6, 1-6 defeat. "I had beaten her
the year before. She came out with
nothing to lose and swung as hard as
she could at every ball. I just had to
look at that and say, "Hey, she
played a really great match,' and 1
just have to forget about it and
come out ready to fight hard
[again]."
Liu's unwavering determination
in the top singles slot earned her the
2004 USTA Sportmanship Award.
Sixteen participating coaches made
the decision to honor Liu for exem
plifying the spirit of collegiate ten
nis.
"I was very honored to receive
the award," Liu said. "I've always
tried hard to keep my composure on
the court. But 1 felt like the award
was great for the team. We were
able to sweep all the awards at the
tournament."
Stanford swept No. 7 Washing
ton 5-0 in the semifinals and No. 11
UCLA 6-1 in the quarterfinals.
Buoyed by such strong perfor
mances, the Cardinal looks to gain
even more momentum from now
until the national championships in
May.
Stanford is eager to avenge last
year's championship-match loss to
No. 1 Florida, which chose not to
participate at the Indoors.
"I cannot wait until NCAAs,"
Logar said. "I think that we're going
to have a nice little surprise for
Florida."

just have to forget about it and
come out ready to fight hard
[again]."
Liu's unwavering determination
in the top singles slot earned her the
2004 USTA Sportmanship Award.
Sixteen participating coaches made
the decision to honor Liu for exem
plifying the spirit of collegiate ten
nis.
"I was very honored to receive
the award," Liu said. "I've always
tried hard to keep my composure on
the court. But 1 felt like the award
was great for the team. We were
able to sweep all the awards at the
tournament."
Stanford swept No. 7 Washing
ton 5-0 in the semifinals and No. 11
UCLA 6-1 in the quarterfinals.
Buoyed by such strong perfor
mances, the Cardinal looks to gain
even more momentum from now
until the national championships in
May.
Stanford is eager to avenge last
year's championship-match loss to
No. 1 Florida, which chose not to
participate at the Indoors.
"I cannot wait until NCAAs,"
Logar said. "I think that we're going
to have a nice little surprise for
Florida."
The No. 2 Stanford women's tennis team
(6-0) dominated the competition this weekend
at the USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championships and brought home the title for
a record seventh time.
In the tournament's 17-year-history, only
four teams have clinched elusive final victory.
With its stunning Sunday morning defeat of
Georgia at Wisconsin's A.C. Nielsen Tennis
Stadium, the top-seeded Cardinal surpassed
current NCAA champion, top-ranked Florida,
in number of titles won.
The Gators stand at six victories, followed
by Georgia (3) and Duke (1).
Claiming the 2004 Team Indoor title also
comes as vindication for the Cardinal, which
fell to Georgia in 2002's finals. 4-3 — the only
loss that national championship squad would
suffer. Last year. Stanford fell, 4-3 again, to
rival No. 3 California in the semifinals.
Playing in the No. 5 singles position, fresh
man Theresa Logar outlasted Georgia's Jitka
Schonfeldova 6-0,3-6,6-4 to seal the match for
Stanford, 5-0.
Logar, who is ranked 84th in the nation, re
calls the tension and frenzy surrounding her
final match.
"The crowd was going crazy and so were my
teammates," Logar said. "I was [so] nervous
[at that moment], I have no idea how I played
that point. It was long, but I [finally] went fora
forehand putaway and she couldn't return it.
That's when the team went nuts."
After an easy win in the first set, Logar let
the second set slip away and struggled in the
third, as unranked Schonfeldova fought back
from a 5-2 deficit, bringing the match to 5-4 in
Stanford's favor.
"The biggest challenge for me was simply

rising to the occasion," Logar said of her first
collegiate team tournament. "I didn't play
doubles, so I had to watch and get all nervous
and freaked out before I had to play. I had to
make sure that I was mentally ready to do my
job before I stepped out on the court. And
that's a lot tougher than you'd think."
Despite posting a substantial 5-0 defeat of
No. 4 Georgia, which was seeded second at the
Team Indoors, Stanford had no easy task be
fore them in the finals.
"Georgia was tough and I think it would
have been a lot tougher had we not won the
doubles point, which we could have easily
lost," Logar said.
Heading Stanford's doubles lineup, top
ranked senior Lauren Barnikow and junior
Erin Burdette battled long and hard before
overcoming Georgia's No. 4 Agata Cioroch
and Shadisha Robinson, 9-7, to claim the dou
bles point for the Cardinal.
Cioroch, a senior, is the nation's top-ranked
player in singles and holds an impressive 18-3
doubles record with Robinson, a freshman
who is already ranked No. 12 in singles.
Playing in the third doubles spot, the No. 17
team of senior Emilia Anderson and freshman
Anne Yelsey defeated Douglas Wink and Na
talie Frazier, 8-5.
The No. 2 doubles match went undecided,
as Stanford's Amber Liu and Alice Barnes,
both sophomores, were neck and neck with
Schonfeldova and Evgenia Subbotina, 8-8,
when Stanford secured the doubles point, halt
ing their match.
Liu returned to dual match play for Stan
ford after devoting the individual season to
professional circuit competition. Despite suf
fering a stunning first-round loss last Thursday
to William and Mary's No. 76 Megan Muth,

Stanford senior Emilia Anderson defeated No. 2 Georgia's Alex Smith 6-1, 6-0 to help
the No. 1 women's tennis team to its seventh National Team Indoor Championships title.
Liu remained optimistic.
'it was rough to start out the sea
son with a loss," Liu said of her 6-3,
3-6, 1-6 defeat. "I had beaten her
the year before. She came out with
nothing to lose and swung as hard as
she could at every ball. I just had to
look at that and say, "Hey, she
played a really great match,' and 1
just have to forget about it and
come out ready to fight hard
[again]."
