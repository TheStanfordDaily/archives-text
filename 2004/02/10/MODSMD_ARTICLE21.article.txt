### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 12 Stanford softball team (3-1)
began its season by winning three out of four
games in the Stanford Tournament it hosted.
The Cardinal defeated No. 6 Alabama
(3-1) on Friday, 4-1, then lost to the Crim
son Tide in a rematch the next day, 2-1.
Stanford then shut out San Jose State (0-5)
on Saturday and Sunday, 8-0 and 2-0, re
spectively.
Freshman left fielder Jackie Rinehart
started her college career on a high note,
going 2-for-3 on Friday. The leadoff hitter
started the Cardinal's decisive three-run
third inning with an infield single. Sopho
more center fielder Catalina Morris tripled
to plate Rinehart and then scored on sopho
more Lauren Lappin's single. After Lappin
stole second, junior outfielder Meghan Sick
ler pushed a single through the infield for the
RBI.

Staff ace Dana Sorenson allowed three
hits and no runs in six innings while striking
out seven to collect the win, while Alabama's
Stephanie Vanßrakle allowed eight hits in
throwing a six-inning complete game that re
quired 125 pitches. Freshman Danika Dukes
allowed a run to Alabama in the seventh.
True to their national ranking, the Crim
son Tide came back strong on Saturday —
but not before handing the Cardinal a free
run.
Sickler reached on an error by the short
stop. stole second and then scored on an
error by third baseman Capper Reed. Soren
son held Alabama scoreless until the bottom
of the seventh, when Reed redeemed herself
by lacing a leadoff double to right. Two bat
ters later, catcher Kellie Deska hit the game
tying single to left. One inning later, Jackie
McClain hit into a fielder's choice to plate
Ashley Courtney with the winning run.
Sorenson took the loss, allowing three
hits, three walks and two runs (one earned)

in 7 1 / 3 innings. Vanßrakle allowed six hits
over eight innings but still managed a com
plete game win.
Later that day, the Cardinal found an eas
ier opponent in San Jose State. Junior desig
nated player Michelle Thiry went 3-for-4
with three RBI to lead Stanford.
The Cardinal took control early, as Rine
hart singled, stole second and scored on Lap
pin's triple. Senior catcher Jessica Allister's
sacrifice fly scored Lappin.
One inning later, Rinehart again singled
and scored on a Lappin hit — this time a dou
ble.
In the third, Sickler's single was followed
by Thiry's home run to center, the Cardinal's
first longball of the year.
Rinehart finished 3-for-4 with three runs.
Laura Severson allowed one hit in four in
nings to earn the win for the Cardinal, which
then got three innings of two-hit ball from
Dukes, who collected her first save. Neither
pitcher walked a batter, although they com

hined for only four strikeouts.
The Spartans' Kelli McCollister was
torched for eight hits and six runs (five
earned) in three innings and took the loss.
Rinehart once again sparked the Cardi
nal, going 2-for-2 with two stolen bases on
Sunday. Stanford scored both its runs in the
first inning, as Rinehart singled, stole second
and then scored on a throwing error by the
pitcher, Carol Forbes, which allowed Lappin
to reach second. Allister then grounded to
the third baseman, but Megan Delgado
threw the ball away and Lappin scored.
Dukes, making her first collegiate start,
threw four scoreless innings for the win. She
allowed the Spartans' only hit of the day — a
single by Courtney Lewis in the first inning.
Severson threw three perfect frames for her
first save.
Forbes threw a complete game for the
Spartans, allowing three hits and a
walk. Both of Stanford's runs were
unearned.
Rinehart finished the weekend a
stellar 8-of-13 at the plate. She cur
rently leads the Cardinal in batting
(.615 average), base-stealing (three
bases) and scoring (five runs).
Having hosted the Stanford Tour
nament last weekend, the Cardinal
hosts the Stanford Invitational this
weekend. It will play Santa Clara at 3
p.m. on Friday. Missouri at 5 p.m. on
