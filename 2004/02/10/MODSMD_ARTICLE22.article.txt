### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford's men's ten
nis team got its first taste of defeat
this season when the Cardinal
bowed out to No. 1 Illinois in the
semifinals of the National Team In
door Championship in Seattle,
Wash, on Saturday. The loss came
on the heels of back-to-back victo
ries over No. 13 Texas and No. 4
Vanderbilt at the tournament.
"I was very anxious to get to the
tournament because I thought we
had made a lot of improvement
with our team, but you can't really
tell until you get to a tournament,"
Stanford head coach Dick Gould
said. "[Stanford associate head
coach John Whitlinger] and I were
really impressed with how the team
competed."
Match play started on Thursday
morning when the Cardinal took on
the Longhorns. Texas opened an
early 1-0 lead when they captured
two of the three doubles wins.
Playing in the No. 2 doubles po
sition, Stanford junior Sam War
burg and team captain senior Carter
Morris fell 8-5 to Antonio Ruiz and
All-American Jose Zarhi. The
Stanford pair of senior Joe Kao and
junior Phil Sheng followed suit,
dealt an 8-2 loss by the Longhorn's
Hubert Chodkiewicz and Joe Mor
ris. The match between Stanford's
sophomore pair of KC Corkery and
James Pade, ranked No. 10 in the
nation, and Texas' Jimmy Haney

and Pete Stroer was not
completed as the
Longhorns had already
wrapped up the point.
With the teams compet
ing in the tournament need
ed four points in order de
feat their match opponents,
Stanford looked toward its
singles players to carry the
team into the next round.
Warburg soundly de
feated Pete Stroer 6-0
while Pade came overcame
a first-set loss to knock off
Will Clinton 1-6, 6-4, 6-1.
Stanford freshman James
Wan crushed Joe Morris 6-
1,6-1.
After a long and gruel
ing battle, Ruiz barely de
feated Stanford's Corkery,
who has been recovering
from shoulder problems, 7-
6(3), 7-6(7).
Morris also showed
some grit in his match, win
ning the second set but
eventually losing to Ryan
Haymond 6-1,1 -6,6-4.
With each team holding
three points in the dual
match, Stanford needed one
more win to finalize their vic
tory and move on to the next
round. The last match was

between Stanford's Sheng and
Texas' Zarhi.
With both team's tournament
chances hanging in the balance,
Sheng lost the first set before re

bounding to defeat Zarhi 5-7,6-4,6-
4 to clinch the first round Stanford
victory.
No. 4 Vanderbilt awaited the
Cardinal on Friday. As it did against
Texas, Stanford fell behind 1-0 start

after dropping two doubles matches
to the Commodores, but came back
to win the dual match 4-3.
The Vanderbilt doubles pair of
Chad Harris and Lewis Smith bare
ly slid by Corkery and Pade, 9-8 (5).

Sheng and Kao lost for the second
time in as many days but Morris and
Warburg prevented a Vanderbilt
doubles sweep, defeating Zach
