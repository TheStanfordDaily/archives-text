# Beat goes on, Card makes history
## By SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
### 
The Stanford wrestling team (8-4,
5-2 Pacific-10 Conference) extended
its dual-meet win streak to five in dra
matic and unlikely fashion last week
end. The Cardinal rallied to defeat
Oregon State for the first time in histo
ry on Saturday and trounced Fresno
State for the first time since 1964 the
next day.
History, including a 35-7 loss in
Corvallis last season, was stacked
against the Cardinal on Saturday, but
Stanford overcame a 17-9 deficit in the
final two bouts to bury an ugly piece of
the past with an 18-17 victory.
A 4-0 decision by junior Brad Met
zler at 141 pounds to open the dual
meet and a 5-0 decision two bouts later
by junior and second-ranked Matt
Gentry at 157 gave Stanford an early
but short-lived 6-4 lead.
Oregon State battled back behind
the strength of its own nationally
ranked bunch. No. 10 Matt Ellis, who is
ranked first in the Pac-10 at 165, de
feated Stanford redshirt freshman
Brian Perry, 6-3, and No. 14 Jed Pen
nell escaped with an 8-6 decision over
Cardinal sophomore Imad Kharbush
at 174.
Fellow sophomoie Larry Ozowara
pulled Stanford to within 13-9 with a
10-4 decision at 184 before a major de
cision by the Beavers'Jamie Rakevich
at 285 pushed Oregon States lead to
eight with just two bouts to go.
The match turned on the shoulders
of Stanford freshman Tanner Gard
ner. The 125-pounder held a lead in the
third period when he pinned Oregon
State's Eric Stevenson at the 6:22 mark
to give Stanford six points and, more
importantly, a chance to win in the
final bout.
With the crowd on its feet and the
score tied in the final period of the de
cisive bout, Stanford senior Paul Gross
recorded a takedown and hung on for
a 7-3 victory. Oregon State had not lost

to the Cardinal in 29 previous meetings.
The win is more than just another
number in the standings, according to
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie,
who is now in his third season at the
helm of the Cardinal.
"We were a pretty close team to
start the season, but winning just
changes everything," Buddie said.
"For the first time in a long time, our
20 wrestlers or so who haven't had
the opportunity to start for us this
year are such a huge part of this suc
cess. They continue to train as hard as
the starting 10, and they know that
they are a tremendous piece of some
thing very important to this pro
gram."

Riding high from the emotional
program first the day before, Stanford
hit the road fora dual meet at Fresno
State on Sunday.
Ozowara opened the scoring with
his second win in as many days, a dom
inating 15-6 major decision victory. The
Cardinal dropped the next two bouts
before rattling off six straight victories
and locking up their eighth dual meet
win of the season.
Saturday's hero. Gross, started the
Stanford run with a 5-3 decision. Met
zler and sophomore Luis Vendrell tal
lied back-to-back major decisions. Gen
try won by forfeit and the rout was on.
Perry rebounded from Saturday's
loss with a 6-4 decision.and Kharbush

evened his record for the weekend as
well with a 10-2 major decision victory.
With the Pac-10 race wide open, the
Cardinal closes out its dual meet sea
son this weekend. Stanford travels to
UC-Davis on Friday before hosting
Portland State on Saturday at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
Although it has been a season full
of unprecedented highs for the Stan
ford program, the team feels like it's
just getting started.
"No one has been satisfied with a
pat on the back," Buddie said. "Each
week, the team raises the bar higher,
and I'm just not convinced that this
team is done surprising us yet."
Stay tuned.

Stanford overcame a 17-9 deficit in the
final two bouts to bury an ugly piece of
the past with an 18-17 victory.
A 4-0 decision by junior Brad Met
zler at 141 pounds to open the dual
meet and a 5-0 decision two bouts later
by junior and second-ranked Matt
Gentry at 157 gave Stanford an early
but short-lived 6-4 lead.
Oregon State battled back behind
the strength of its own nationally
ranked bunch. No. 10 Matt Ellis, who is
ranked first in the Pac-10 at 165, de
feated Stanford redshirt freshman
Brian Perry, 6-3, and No. 14 Jed Pen
nell escaped with an 8-6 decision over
Cardinal sophomore Imad Kharbush
at 174.
Fellow sophomoie Larry Ozowara
pulled Stanford to within 13-9 with a
10-4 decision at 184 before a major de
cision by the Beavers'Jamie Rakevich
at 285 pushed Oregon States lead to
eight with just two bouts to go.
The match turned on the shoulders
of Stanford freshman Tanner Gard
ner. The 125-pounder held a lead in the
third period when he pinned Oregon
State's Eric Stevenson at the 6:22 mark
to give Stanford six points and, more
importantly, a chance to win in the
final bout.
With the crowd on its feet and the
score tied in the final period of the de
cisive bout, Stanford senior Paul Gross
recorded a takedown and hung on for
a 7-3 victory. Oregon State had not lost

to the Cardinal in 29 previous meetings.
The win is more than just another
number in the standings, according to
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie,
who is now in his third season at the
helm of the Cardinal.
"We were a pretty close team to
start the season, but winning just
changes everything," Buddie said.
"For the first time in a long time, our
20 wrestlers or so who haven't had
the opportunity to start for us this
year are such a huge part of this suc
cess. They continue to train as hard as
the starting 10, and they know that
they are a tremendous piece of some
thing very important to this pro
gram."

Riding high from the emotional
program first the day before, Stanford
hit the road fora dual meet at Fresno
State on Sunday.
Ozowara opened the scoring with
his second win in as many days, a dom
inating 15-6 major decision victory. The
Cardinal dropped the next two bouts
before rattling off six straight victories
and locking up their eighth dual meet
win of the season.
Saturday's hero. Gross, started the
Stanford run with a 5-3 decision. Met
zler and sophomore Luis Vendrell tal
lied back-to-back major decisions. Gen
try won by forfeit and the rout was on.
Perry rebounded from Saturday's
loss with a 6-4 decision.and Kharbush

evened his record for the weekend as
well with a 10-2 major decision victory.
With the Pac-10 race wide open, the
Cardinal closes out its dual meet sea
son this weekend. Stanford travels to
UC-Davis on Friday before hosting
Portland State on Saturday at 7 p.m. in
Burnham Pavilion.
Although it has been a season full
of unprecedented highs for the Stan
ford program, the team feels like it's
just getting started.
"No one has been satisfied with a
pat on the back," Buddie said. "Each
week, the team raises the bar higher,
and I'm just not convinced that this
team is done surprising us yet."
Stay tuned.
