While the men's basketball team
remained undefeated with its heart
stopping win at Maples, the men's
swim team quietly improved its own
perfect record this weekend in
Southern California. On Friday, the
Cardinal competed in an exhibition
meet against Novaquatics, one of the
premier club teams in America. The
team followed a strong showing
there with a 127-102 defeat of South
ern California. The No. 2 Cardinal
improved to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in
the Pacific-10 Conference with the
victory.
Although it was only an exhibi
tion, Friday's meeting with Nova was
hardly low-key. Nova brought nu
merous Olympic trials qualifiers to
compete against the Cardinal's best
and the display of speed was as
tounding. The most exciting event of
the meet was by far the 100-yard
backstroke, an event packed with
swimming superstars. Nova's Lenny
Krayzelburg, the current world
record holder in the 100-meter back
stroke, lined up in between Stan
ford's Markus Rogan and Peter
Marshall for an accomplished trio of
swimmers.
In addition to being the world
record holder, Krayzelburg is also
the reigning Olympic gold medalist
in the event. However, the race be
longed to the Stanford duo. Rogan,
an Austrian national champion, and
Marshall, a two-time NCAA cham
pion, finished 1-2 in the race.
Rogan's 47.30 barely clipped Mar
shall's 47.37. but both finished ahead
of Krayzelburg. The 1 -2 finish by the
two seniors marks the second time in
two weeks that Krayzelburg has fall
en to a Cardinal backstroker. Stan

ford alumnus Randall Bal beat
Krayzelburg at the New York World
Cup two weekends ago.
Although there was no official
score at the Nova meet, the Cardinal
swimmers showed that they were ca
pable of racing with the best in the
country. Junior Jayme Cramer won
the 200-yard freestyle in 1:36.38 and
fellow junior Matt McDonald cap
tured the 100-yard butterfly. Fresh
men Andy Grant and Shaun Phillips
won the 1000- and 500-yard
freestyles. In all. the Cardinal took
six of 11 events.
The next day, the Cardinal
moved on to race against USC in its
penultimate Pac-10 dual meet. Al
though the meet did not offer as
much competition as the day before,
the team had some solid races.
Phillips clocked in with a second
place finish in the 800-meter
freestyle and a victory in the 400. His
times in both events were among the
nation's best this year. Junior Gary
Marshall began to find his breas
troke, winning the 200 in 2:12.90.
Marshall, the national champion in
the event this summer, is excited that
he is beginning to feel good abut his
racing.
"We spent fall quarter in hard
training, and that work is really start
ing to pay off," he said. "I can be ag
gressive in my races because I have
confidence in that training and in my
fitness level."
The Cardinal led by enough that
they went unofficial for the last two
events, not scoring their perfor
mances. Even with the free 28 points,
the Trojans still fell by 25 points.
