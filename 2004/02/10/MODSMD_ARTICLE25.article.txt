## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While it failed to defend its Stan
ford Invitational title fora fourth
consecutive season, the No. 3 Stan
ford women's water polo team (3-1)
served notice that it's deserving of
its lofty ranking with solid play and
a respectable third-place finish.
Following an 11-3 trouncing of
Michigan on Saturday morning, the
Cardinal faced No. 2 Southern Cal
ifornia (4-0) as the sun began to set
at the Avery Aquatic Center.
The Trojans jumped out to a 3-1
lead in the first period but the Car
dinal managed to tie the score 7-7
with four goals in the third.
Seniors Lauren Faust and
Wendy Watkins and junior Hannah
Luber scored two goals apiece for
the Cardinal but USC pulled out
the 10-8 victory behind sophomore
Moriah Van Norman, who scored
four goals in the match.
While the tight loss could have
worn down the Cardinal, Stanford
appeared energized and prepared
as it defeated San Jose Sate 11-3 the
next morning.
The Cardinal got off to a quick

start when Watkins scored with
1:21 to play in the first period. In the
second, Stanford unleashed four
more goals, including another by
Watkins as she broke away off a
San Jose State turnover.
Stanford's offense took advan
tage of a one-player advantage,
while the Cardinal defense shut out
the Spartans (3-3) in the first and
third periods. By the time San Jose
State scored the second of its two
fourth-period goals, the game was
out of reach.
The Cardinal continued its dom
inance against California (3-2) in
the third place game on Sunday af
ternoon. In front of a bipartisan
crowd, the teams ended the first pe
riod tied 1-1 with goals from Cal's
Elsie Windes and Stanford fresh
man driver Katie Hansen.
The Bears jumped out to a 3-1
lead in the second period but after
Hannah Luber's two-meter shot
found the back of the net and an
other goal soon after off an assist by
Watkins, the Cardinal were back on
track.
Stanford's young players, such
as freshman Christine Hewko,
helped draw Cal ejections that cre

ated six-on-five scoring opportuni
ties.
Stanford carried its momentum
into the second half and California
scored just once more. Stanford
freshman goalkeeper Meredith Mc-
Coll finished with nine saves.
The Cardinal jumped out quick
ly in the third period, as sophomore
Laurel Champion assisted Watson,
who fired one past Bears goalkeep
er Lauren Dennis to make the score
5-3.
Despite not playing in the cham
pionship game of the Stanford Invi
tational for the first time since its
inception, the Cardinal women
seemed content with the outcome
of the tournament.
In the championship game, No. 1
UCLA (3-1) and USC, which won
their respective brackets, squared
off in a southern California rivalry.
The Bruins came out attacking, but
the Trojans scored off a six-on-four
advantage and opened a 3-0 lead at
the end of the first period.
Reigning NCAA champion
UCLA closed the gap briefly in the
second period, but the Bruins de
fense could not stop USC in the sec
ond half of a 12-4 Trojans victory.
