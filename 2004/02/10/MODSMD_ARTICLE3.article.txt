The Stanford Social Innovation
Review is a publication that takes a
new and innovative look at social
problems through interdisciplinary
study. Founded one year ago by
the Center for Social Innovation at
the Stanford Graduate School of
Business, the publication is the
first of its kind â€” applying busi
ness tactics and strategies to the
public sector.
The publication reports on the
changes that are taking place in
the public sector and provides in
novative solutions to major social
problems.

"We want to recognize organi
zations that are using creative so
lutions to deal with social prob
lems," said Pearla Ni, publisher of
the Innovation Review. "For ex
ample, the review chronicled Ben
and Jerry's partnership with Pacif
ic Bell Park, which allows at-risk
youth to receive job training and a
stable job selling ice cream in the
ballpark."
The publication also strives to
provide practical solutions to prob
lems that some non-profit groups
are dealing with.
The Innovation Review is sym
bolic of the recent commitments
that the Stanford Business School
has made to public and non-profit
management and the growth of its
Center for Social Innovation,
founded three years ago.
"We hope to provide a bridge
between academic research and
useful strategies for practition
ers," Ni said.
In the past year, the Innovation
Review has recruited professors,
undergraduate students, MBA stu
dents and doctoral students to
work on the publication.
"A lot of our success has come

because we have put our nose to the
grindstone and worked incredibly
hard," Ni said.
The quarterly targets non-profit
firm executives, grant-making firm
executives, social entrepreneurs,
and corporate executives concerned
with social, environmental and com
munity issues. Currently, the publi
cation has exceeded its subscription
expectations, garnering over 3000
subscribers.
Going into its second year, the
Innovation Review hopes to in
crease its subscriber base and es
tablish itself as a resource for
non-profit and philanthropic
companies.
"One of our long-term goals is
to establish the credibility of this
new approach for looking at social
problems," Ni said. "We must real
ize that social problems are not just
problems for the public sector."
The publications receives finan
cial support from the Center for So
cial Innovation's investors, which
include philanthropists Louise and
Claude Rosenberg, Susan B. Ford,
the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation.
