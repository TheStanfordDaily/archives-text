## Duke Hospital updates safety measures 
### MALA VIKA PRABHU THE CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C. — In the wake
of Jesica Santillan's mismatched organ transplant,
Duke University Hospital (DIJH) implemented a
series of safety measures targeted at the organ
transplant procedure to ensure that such medical
mishaps do not reoccur.
In addition, the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS), the national non-profit organi
zation that coordinates the matching process be
tween organ donors and recipients, reevaluated its
matching system over the past year and has added
additional checks to minimize the potential for in
compatible transplants.
Many of DUH's changes for its organ trans
plant procedure, however, came into effect within
a month of Santillan's death on Feb. 21.
"Basically, we implemented a large number of
changes immediately so we weren't reliant upon a
third party to do (he match," said Chief of Cardio
vascular and Thoracic Surgery Dr. Peter Smith,
who led a multidisciplinary team that designed the
new changes. The additional measures were a re
sult of root cause analysis and process analysis
conducted by the team, which included surgeons,
nurses, transplant coordinators and administra
tors, among others.
As were most hospitals. Smith added, at the
time of the Santillan mishap, DUH was relying on
the fact that a match precluded the organs being
offered to an institution. To eliminate the possi
bility of a mismatch, DUH has now implemented
redundant checks for blood type compatibility —
two timeouts where the healthcare professionals
agree on the match, once before the patient is
anesthetized and once after the organ arrives at
DUH. The final step is to type the donor's blood

at the time of transplantation.
To facilitate the checks, posters have been af
fixed in the thoracic surgery operating rooms re
minding the staff of blood compatibility relation
ships.
"Whereas there was not much redundancy [in
the procedure), there is a tremendous redundancy
introduced subsequently," said Dr. Duane Davis,
associate professor of thoracic surgery. He added
these repetitive protocols were reasonable due to
the high stakes involved with a human life.
"There's been continuous improvement be
cause of the 1(X) percent auditing of each trans
plant," said Smith, qualifying the audits as being
primarily internal.
Another significant change is the incorpora
tion of the Pediatric Heart Transplant program
into its Adult Heart Transplant counterpart to
achieve greater consistency of treatment. Only the
adult program is to be responsible for coordina
tion between DUH and the regional organ pro
curement organization.
With its safeguards, DUH has led the way for
UNOS and its Organ Procurement and Transplan
tation Network, as well as transplant centers nation
wide, to institute their own changes, Smith said.
For UNOS, the modifications have primarily
been procedural to ensure a blood type match. The
software that coordinates the match now must dis
play the donor's blood type on every screen —in-
formation entered into the system by two separate
UNOS staff members, another redundant proce
dure. Furthermore, UNOS is requiring every hos
pital capable of transplant surgeries to have a pro
tocol ensuring the match, to conduct routine audits
of transplants and to produce documentation as
serting the validity of its protocol.
"One of the specific statements in the |new|
policy is to make it extremely explicit that it is the

transplant center's responsibility to compare in
formation about the patient and blood type of the
donor," said Joel Newman, assistant director of
communications of UNOS.
Yet to be evaluated is a proposal to draw two
independent blood samples from the donor and
recipient and individually enter the blood type re
sults into the UNOS system.
Also during this past year. DUH has reempha
si/ed patient safety hospital-wide — creating
safety task forces, updating information technolo
gy systems and instituting additional checks for
pediatric services.
DUH Chief Executive Officer Dr. Bill Fulker
son said medical errors occur because of inade
quate systems. The hospital's "concrete" actions
are thus oriented at strengthening current systems
to safeguard all healthcare professionals from
committing serious errors, he added.
Duke University Health System (DUHS) is
in the process of finding a Patient Safety Offi
cer, a newly created position that would have
oversight across the entire organization. Fur
thermore, DUH and DUHS are constantly
working on improving and deploying various
information technology systems — such as
eßrowser, a common database able to be ac
cessed by a large host of hospital and outpatient
clinic staff — and the Computerized Physician
Order Entry system, which will replace hand
written prescriptions when it is implemented
this spring.
Fulkerson also pointed to the need to em
phasize a culture that "embraces safety" and
said his role was to promote such a culture and
encourage hospital staff to report all possible
sources of error.
"We're going to fix the things that are broken
and fix them for the last time," he said.

communications of UNOS.
Yet to be evaluated is a proposal to draw two
independent blood samples from the donor and

Also during this past year. DUH has reempha

safety task forces, updating information technolo

pediatric services.
DUH Chief Executive Officer Dr. Bill Fulker
son said medical errors occur because of inade
quate systems. The hospital's "concrete" actions
are thus oriented at strengthening current systems
to safeguard all healthcare professionals from
committing serious errors, he added.
Duke University Health System (DUHS) is
in the process of finding a Patient Safety Offi
cer, a newly created position that would have
oversight across the entire organization. Fur
thermore, DUH and DUHS are constantly
working on improving and deploying various
information technology systems — such as
eßrowser, a common database able to be ac
cessed by a large host of hospital and outpatient
clinic staff — and the Computerized Physician
Order Entry system, which will replace hand
written prescriptions when it is implemented
this spring.
Fulkerson also pointed to the need to em
phasize a culture that "embraces safety" and
said his role was to promote such a culture and
encourage hospital staff to report all possible
sources of error.
"We're going to fix the things that are broken
and fix them for the last time," he said.
(U-WIRE) DURHAM, N.C. — In the wake
of Jesica Santillan's mismatched organ transplant,
Duke University Hospital (DIJH) implemented a
series of safety measures targeted at the organ
transplant procedure to ensure that such medical
mishaps do not reoccur.
In addition, the United Network for Organ
Sharing (UNOS), the national non-profit organi
zation that coordinates the matching process be
tween organ donors and recipients, reevaluated its
matching system over the past year and has added
additional checks to minimize the potential for in
compatible transplants.
Many of DUH's changes for its organ trans
plant procedure, however, came into effect within
a month of Santillan's death on Feb. 21.
"Basically, we implemented a large number of
changes immediately so we weren't reliant upon a
third party to do (he match," said Chief of Cardio
vascular and Thoracic Surgery Dr. Peter Smith,
who led a multidisciplinary team that designed the
new changes. The additional measures were a re
sult of root cause analysis and process analysis
conducted by the team, which included surgeons,
nurses, transplant coordinators and administra
tors, among others.
As were most hospitals. Smith added, at the
time of the Santillan mishap, DUH was relying on
the fact that a match precluded the organs being
offered to an institution. To eliminate the possi
bility of a mismatch, DUH has now implemented
redundant checks for blood type compatibility —
two timeouts where the healthcare professionals
agree on the match, once before the patient is
anesthetized and once after the organ arrives at
DUH. The final step is to type the donor's blood

at the time of transplantation.
To facilitate the checks, posters have been af
fixed in the thoracic surgery operating rooms re
minding the staff of blood compatibility relation
ships.
"Whereas there was not much redundancy [in
the procedure), there is a tremendous redundancy
introduced subsequently," said Dr. Duane Davis,
associate professor of thoracic surgery. He added
these repetitive protocols were reasonable due to
the high stakes involved with a human life.
"There's been continuous improvement be
cause of the 1(X) percent auditing of each trans
plant," said Smith, qualifying the audits as being
primarily internal.
Another significant change is the incorpora
tion of the Pediatric Heart Transplant program
into its Adult Heart Transplant counterpart to
achieve greater consistency of treatment. Only the
adult program is to be responsible for coordina
tion between DUH and the regional organ pro
curement organization.
With its safeguards, DUH has led the way for
UNOS and its Organ Procurement and Transplan
tation Network, as well as transplant centers nation
wide, to institute their own changes, Smith said.
For UNOS, the modifications have primarily
been procedural to ensure a blood type match. The
software that coordinates the match now must dis
play the donor's blood type on every screen —in-
formation entered into the system by two separate
UNOS staff members, another redundant proce
dure. Furthermore, UNOS is requiring every hos
pital capable of transplant surgeries to have a pro
tocol ensuring the match, to conduct routine audits
of transplants and to produce documentation as
serting the validity of its protocol.
"One of the specific statements in the |new|
policy is to make it extremely explicit that it is the

transplant center's responsibility to compare in
formation about the patient and blood type of the
donor," said Joel Newman, assistant director of
communications of UNOS.
Yet to be evaluated is a proposal to draw two
independent blood samples from the donor and
recipient and individually enter the blood type re
sults into the UNOS system.
