# Columbia engineering students sponsor huge game of Assassins

### REBECCA ARONAUER COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK —
Mik Vasarhelyi is one of the most
recognized laces on campus. But for
the next two weeks the Columbia
College Student Council president is
hoping to be just another anonymous
student.
Vasarhelyi, along with 200 other
students, is playing Assassins, the
game of mock espionage. To win
$400, he and the other members of
his team, "The Generals," have to

assassinate other teams of four and
hope that Vasarhelyi's familiarity is
not a liability as other teams track
down the Generals.
Last Friday, 50 teams paid $5
each fora plastic water gun and a
chance to win big. The game starts
Monday at 9 p.m. after the opening
dinner of Engineering Week, a na
tional celebration of engineers. The
festivities include a "Spaceballs"
movie night, a Mr. and Ms. Engineer
pageant and a Mario Kart tourna
ment. Mohan Ramaswamy orga
nized the tournament, which is open

to all undergraduate schools, for E-
Week.
Engineering Student Council
President Vijay Sundaram said. "E-
Week is a time for the ESC to pro
vide a sense of community for engi
neers on campus. Assassins fits well
into the mission of E-Week because
it generates heavy interaction be
tween student who don't necessarily
know each other, not only in the en
gineering school but across the en
tire undergraduate student body."
Each team of four is given 72
hours to assassinate — shoot in the

back with a water gun — one other
team. If the team fails to assassinate
all opposing team members, it is dis
posed. Any assassin can shoot a dis
posed player, eliminating him or her
from competition.
Safe zones include Butler quiet
rooms — the bathroom, hallway,
and cafe are fair game — class
rooms. the gym and office hours.
Dan Okin and the Assassins Rules
Commissioner, removed wearing a
towel as a safe zone from last year's
rules when people started wearing
terry cloth around campus to stay in

the game. Okin predicts there will be
about 20 to 40 contested assassina
tions a day with issues ranging from
type of shot to shots penetrating a
book bag.
"People are naturally sneaky, so
there will be some interesting dis
putes," Okin said.
Adam Goldberg, ESC vice presi
dent of internal affairs, is the Assas
sins' answer to James Bond's Q.
Goldberg designed the game's Web
site, which can be accessed from CU-
Community.com. All hits and dis
putes go through the Web site. Each

assassin's picture, housing informa
tion and team's status is online. The
site is updated three times a day.
Success in Assassins is mostly
based on luck, and the odds of win
ning are incredibly slim. But many
college players see the game as a
chance to support their engineering
friends and have fun.
Matt Harrison, CCSC vice presi
dent for funding, who is an assassin
for"The Orientalist" said, "I work
with the Engineering Student Coun
cil, so it's good to shoot some of
them in the back."
