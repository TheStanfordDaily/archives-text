BORO, Tenn. â€” Protesters en
dured freezing temperatures in
hopes of shouting down a Ku Klux
Klan (KKK) rally at Riverfront Park
in Nashville on Sunday morning.
The KKK didn't show.
The more than 100 protesters
who gathered were organized by
Katuah Earth First and the Nashville
Peace and Justice Center.
Katuah has led protests at other
KKK rallies in Tennessee.
The rallies recently held in Ten
nessee have been organized by out
of-state Klansmen from northern
Alabama, Marietta, Ga., and
Arkansas according to Chris Irwin,
an organizer from Katuah and law
student at the University of Ten
nessee-Knoxville.
The group wants to send a mes
sage to the KKK that Tennesseans
don't agree with the hate group,
Irwin said.
"Not to be here is to agree with
what they're saying. Silence is com
plicity," Irwin said.

Matt Leber, director of the
Nashville Peace and Justice Center,
agreed that the best thing to do is to
confront the KKK when they come
to town. He counted their absence at
Sundays rally a success.
"We confronted them," Leber
said. "They didn't show up because
they're afraid."
"We're a coalition of indepen
dent organizations working fora
peaceful and just society," Leber
said.
The KKK is part of a larger issue
involving U.S. trade and foreign pol
icy, according to Leber.
"U.S. trade policies create desta
bilization of foreign countries forc
ing immigrants to the U.S pitting
poor American workers against poor
immigrant workers," Leber said.
"The Klan is a result of those poli
cies. It is those policies where we
should focus our attention."
Middle Tennessee Vets for Peace
were also in attendance.
"We're always going to be stand
ing up with people who want peace,
justice and equality," Michael Au
gust from Middle Tennessee Vets for
Peace said.
