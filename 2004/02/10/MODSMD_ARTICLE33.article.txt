### ALISON KNEZEVICH DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. —
A prank caller posing as a Searle
Student Health Service employee at
Northwestern University has called
three Northwestern women since
April to falsely give them positive
lab results for sexually transmitted
diseases (Sficials said.
Independent of the incidents, uni
versity health officials said they hope
to launch a new lab-result disclosure
system within two months to im
prove confidentiality and reassure
students that such calls are false.
In each of the prank calls, a fe
male voice told the three women —
two current students and one recent
graduate — on answering ma
chines that they had tested positive
for an STD. One woman was told
she had AIDS.
However, none of the three
women had been tested for STDs at

Searle, and it is against protocol for
such results to be disclosed on an an
swering machine, said Dr. Donald
Misch, NU's director of health ser
vice.
"We are not going to call and
leave you a message and say, 'Hi,
you have AIDS,"' Misch said. '"If
you hear that, it wasn't us."
The most recent incident took
place in December.
Weinberg junior Hannah Yoo
said that when she returned home
from a weekend trip during Spring
Quarter, her roommate informed
her she had an important message
on the answering machine.
Yoo said a woman — who iden
tified herself as "Melanie," a Searle
employee — told Yoo she had ac
cess to her medical records and that
Yoo had tested positive for unspeci
fied STDs. The woman advised Yoo
to return the phone call to discuss
the results and set up a counseling
appointment.
