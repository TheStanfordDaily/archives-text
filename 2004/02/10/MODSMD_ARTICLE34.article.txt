# University president to investigate crime
## 
### RYAN MEEHAN THE ORACLE 
(IJ-WIRE) TAMPA, Fla. â€”
University of South Florida Presi
dent Judy Genshaft said, if found,
the perpetrators responsible for
hanging a rope fashioned into a
noose outside Magnolia Apart
ments last week would be "swiftly
dealt with" by the university's judi
cial system.
Genshaft's comments were re
leased in a statement Friday in re
sponse to the discovery of the noose
hanging in a tree outside Magnolia
Apartments one week ago.

"Campus police are vigorously
investigating this incident, using
every resource at their disposal in
the effort to find those responsible
for this deplorable act," she said.
The noose incident comes about
a year after the bust of Martin
Luther King Jr. had to be removed
from the memorial plaza outside the
Phyllis P. Marshall Center for re
pairs after it was vandalized.
Both incidents took place in
February, which is Black Emphasis
Month at USF.
The discovery of the noose is
not being treated as a hate crime,
police say, until they can gather

more information on the motiva
tion behind the act. The MLK bust
incident was not treated as a hate
crime because there was no vio
lence committed against an actual
person.
"As members of the USF com
munity, we have a duty to go be
yond mere tolerance of diversity
and difference. We must appreciate
diversity in our hearts, encourage it
in our relationships, and defend it in
our actions," Genshaft said.
Following Genshaft's statement
Friday, Vice President of the Black
Student Union Quinton Armstrong
says he was disappointed that the

president took so long to respond to
the incident. Armstrong added that
he felt that she didn't respond until
she had to.
"I understand she has a univer
sity to run, but if she doesn't know
what is going on, maybe she
shouldn't be president." Arm
strong said.
Armstrong says the response
should have come in a more timely
manner. He says the incident with
the noose was far more serious
than the MLK bust incident.
"Let's stop being politically cor
rect and let's just start to be real,"
he said.
