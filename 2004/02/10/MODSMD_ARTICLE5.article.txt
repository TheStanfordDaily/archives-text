### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
Approximately 250 sopho
mores will be dining with 50 Stan
ford alumni as part of the newly
launched '06 Alumni Connection
Dinners, held tonight and next
Wednesday night. This year, stu
dents will begin their networking
process by going to the homes of

alumni and learning about life
after Stanford.
"Being that alumni have been
through life on the Farm and after,
they can provide guidance to stu
dents, especially sophomores who
are at that crucial point in their
lives when they decide what their
probable major is," said Robert
Walker, one of the Sophomore
Class presidents.

Fast Sophomore Academic din
ners were held annually at the Arril
laga Alumni Center, where alumni
would come to campus and eat with
students. However, rising costs of
catering at the center prompted the
change for this year.
Additionally, the organizers of
the dinner wanted to provide stu
dents with a more "laid-back and ca
sual atmosphere" in order to ask

alumni more personal questions, ac
cording to Walker.
"I think this is a good idea if peo
ple are interested in talking to alum
ni." said sophomore Daniel Kilduff.
The sophomore class presi
dents worked with the Alumni As
sociation and the Office of Student
Activities to enlist the help of
alumni in the area â€” primarily
alumni who are still active in the

Stanford community and who
would be willing to connect with
students.
"We have over 50 alums partici
pating in the program, represent
ing 28 different households,"
Walker said. "They range from
lawyers to social activists, but more
importantly, they all were once in
our shoes."
The only costs of the event were

the gifts for the participating alum
ni, which totaled less than $700. The
funds came from the Sophomore
Class budget and the Stanford
Alumni Association.
" I believe that the class of 2006 is
on the ground floor of a future Stan
ford tradition," Walker concluded.
"This is just one of the many reasons
that the Class of 2006 is the best class
to ever hit Stanford."
