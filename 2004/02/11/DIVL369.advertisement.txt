Black Earth:
A Journey through Russia after
the Fall by Andrew Meier
"How do you explain a state in decay?' the author of this engrossing, beautifully
written book asks about a country where "the death of an ideology has displaced
millions," a third ot the households are poor, and epidemics of HIV, I B, suicide,
drug abuse and alcoholism are rite. Meier, a Moscow correspondent for Time
magazine Irom 1996 to 2001, attempted to answer the question by traveling to the
four corners of Russia so he could report on the suffering of the people as they
struggle to survive in the ruins ot the Soviet experiment. He began in 2000 by going
south to war-devastated Chechnya, particularly the town of Aldy, a district of
Grozny, which earlier that year had endured the massacre of at least 60 of its citizens
by Russian soldiers. He then traveled north, above the Arctic Circle, to the heavily
polluted industrial city of Norilsk, originally a labor camp and now "a showcase for
the ravages of unbridled capitalism," where descendants of the prisoners still mine for precious metals. Finally, he went west to
St. Petersburg, "a den ot thieves and compromised politicians" whose much-heralded revival is largely unrealized and where the
people are still haunted by the assassination in 1998 of Galina Vasilievna Starovoitova, the country's leading liberal. After
talking to scores of people-from survivors of the Aldy massacre to a harrowed Russian lieutenant colonel who runs the body
collection point closest to the Chechen battleground-Meier paints in this heartbreaking book a devastating picture of
contemporary life in a country where, as one man put it, people have "lived like the lowest dogs for more than eighty years."

Global Revolution and the Rise
jfflf 112 010 S t of Detente by Jeremi Suri
J&: I his scholarly study of the global protest movements in the 1960s and their
112 Jt concomitant effect on governmental policy in the following era of detente weaves
a grand theory regarding the influence of social unrest on the wielding of public
power. According to Suri's "international history," the rise in student and worker
discontent in the Cold War era-as exemplified not only in the demonstrations of
. Europe, America, Mexico and the Soviet Union, hut in the Cultural Revolution in
■tfj China as well-prompted leaders of all nations to isolate the realm of political power
from the hands of the public. In a sense stripping the world theater of its
ideological differences, Suri, a Univ. of Wisconsin assistant professor, finds
similarity among leaders such as Charles de Gaulle and Mao Zedong as they fight
insurgent forces at home and come to depend on a balance of power among nations
to maintain their loosening grips on control. Detente "was a convergent response to disorder among the great powers,"
Suri argues, established to counteract a global "language of dissent" that threatened to
topple the world's institutions. Suri's thesis links many events and personalities during a time of great change, and succeeds in
"connecting the world of politics and diplomacy with social and cultural experiences" and mapping a global history of the
decade.
