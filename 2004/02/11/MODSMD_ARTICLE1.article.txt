### MELISSA FUSCO 
Students gathered at the Oak Lounge in Tresidder Union last night for
a forum on the USA PATRIOT Act, sponsored by the Stanford Commu
nity for Peace and Justice. Panelists discussed the ramifications of contro
versial anti-terrorism legislation, debated the constitutionality of the act
and took questions from the audience.
Matt Lamberti, assistant U.S. attorney for northern California and one
of the PATRIOT Act's few defenders at the panel, opened the discussion.
He said that the major goal of the act was to encourage communication be
tween law enforcement agencies and to update obsolete terrorism laws to
respond to new threats against the United States.
"There's a lot of misinformation about the act," Lamberti said, address
ing concerns about civil-liberties violations. "There are safeguards in the
act, and there are safeguards elsewhere."
Lamberti also disputed the widely held belief that the USA PATRIOT
Act was passed too hastily by Congress, and that the law was voted on be
fore many people were able to review it.
"That's simply not true," he said, noting that the act went through many
revisions during the weeks it was put before Congress. "Many parts were
preexisting and had already been proposed."
Lamberti stressed that the USA PATRIOT Act should also be distin
guished from other government actions in the war on terror.
"People are concerned about civil rights, racial profiling and the treat
ment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay," he said. "It's important to realize
that these came about as administrative decisions by the government,
rather than the USA PATRIOT Act."
Law School student Nishita Doshi spoke about the act's effects on the
immigrant community.
"Why am I concerned?" Doshi said. "In my opinion, the USA PATRI
OT Act has a tendency to evolve from anti-terrorist legislation to legislation
that is anti-immigrant, especially anti-Muslim."
Doshi also focused on provisions of the act that prohibit financial sup
port to terrorist activities.
"Two kinds of penalties are imposed on those who give money," she
said. "The first is criminal penalties imposed on citizens. The second is im
migration penalties, which sweep far more broadly, and are used to penal
ize conduct that citizens would not be punished for. A humanitarian dona
tion that finds its way into the wrong hands can be traced back to a donor,
who may face deportation."
Kevin Bankston, an attorney with advocacy group Electronic Frontier
Foundation, characterized himself as "strongly opposed" to the USA PA
TRIOT Act.
Bankstone spoke about technology security provisions that expand pre
vious legislation about phone taps to computer and e-mail use. The USA
PATRIOT Act authorizes the government to obtain URLs and e-mail and
IP addresses from private computers and then contact Internet service
providers for personal information about the customer.
"PATRIOT isn't the beginning of the end of privacy, but is the middle
of the end of privacy," Bankstone said. "Fourth amendment jurisprudence
is in a really bad state. As our privacy protections go down, the technology
for invasion of privacy continues to increase ... In 10 years, we may live in
a society where privacy is dead."
The panel's fourth member, civil liberties attorney Anne Weills, drew
parallels between the USA PATRIOT Act and Cold War, McCarthy-era
legislation, calling the restrictions on civil liberties "extraordinary and
extreme."
"We don't even know the breadth of this because we're just beginning to
attack certain sections [of the act]," Weills said. "It's off the charts."
She added, "[There is] a clear violation of First Amendment rights when
political activism is classified as domestic terrorism."
After the presentation, speakers took questions from students. One
student criticized use of the term "suspicious" as a broad designation cov
ering subjects of search.
"I guess I used the term suspicious loosely, which is no good fora
lawyer," Lamberti said, drawing laughter from the audience. He empha
sized that the requirements for search warrants have not changed "one
iota" because of the USA PATRIOT Act, except fora provision that allows
"delayed notice" in notifying a resi
dent that his home has been
searched.
Lamberti stressed that, rather
than curtailing liberties, the PA
TRIOT Act was a measure neces
sary to standardize far-flung and
outdated statutes concerning home
land security.
Other questions concerned gov
ernment surveillance of the Internet
and section 215 of the PATRIOT
Act, which authorizes the govern
ment to obtain financial, religious,
medical and school records without
a person's knowledge or consent
"Why is [the government] stock
piling these powers?" Bankston
asked, while Weills characterized
the provisions of the PATRIOT Act
as part of a "broader attack on civil
liberties" new to U.S. history.
Reaction from students was gen
erally positive.
"The forum was well-put togeth
er," said Reed Adam, a senior. "I
was really impressed that Matt
[Lamberti] from the Department of
Justice came, although I tend to
agree with the other three panelists.
They did a good job covering differ
ent aspects of the act."
