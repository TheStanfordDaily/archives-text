# Class Shopper
## I-Hum, you've been Punk'd 
### 
Editor's Note: This is the first in a series that takes a first-hand look
at Stanford classes.
When I was choosing which class to "shop" for this article
— a big decision in my own measly little life, since this is
not only my virgin ride with this "Secret Shopper" ex
periment, but also The Daily's first time, too — I decid
ed I wanted to pick something friendly and soothingly familiar, both
for myself as well as the rest of you. So sure enough, I thought of In
troduction to the Humanities.
That's right, even though a friend had suggested I check out his
econ class, taught by a visiting professor who's so horrible it's funny,
I ended up going straight to that standard for crap classes, I-Hum.
And by that, I actually don't mean disrespect. (Notice I didn't call
it"the crappiest of crap classes.") It's just that students already slap

I-Hum around a lot — whether or not it's justified,
I make no judgment. So at first, I just wasn't sure I
could add anything new to the pile.
That's when I realized that at least I could have
some fun without receiving a bunch of angry e-mails.
Or, without scandalizing some humorless professor.
Or, without getting The Daily blacklisted.
At any rate, 1 basically ended up picking one ran
dom I-Hum out of the nine currently being offered.
(I mean "basically" in the sense that I squirmed
away from the one that's taught by an adviser of
mine, and in the sense that I needed to find one

being taught on Monday, the day this article was due.) Ultimately, in
what I guess was my own "what-would've-happened-if" curiosity, I
settled on one that had been offered my own freshman year: "En
counters and Identities."
'Encounters and Identities 1
"Encounters and Identities" is taught by a CASA professor. To
start off, 1 should say that despite what I think have been heroic in
tentions on my part, 1 still don't even understand what cultural and
social anthropology is. I guess I could mention what some anthro
pology major told me the other day — beaming — about how
CASA used to be part of the Department of Anthropology a long
time ago, but that it ended up splitting off because CASA wasn't "re
ally" anthropology. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I know what "real"
anthropology is either, since I was too afraid to ask — the guy was
kinda intense —so that doesn't help me much.
All I know is that somehow 1 ended up in I-Hum lecture for the
first time in a long time, and that I wasn't going to fall asleep if it
killed me, dammit.
And lo and behold, the college newspaper deity must have taken
pity on me, for I actually did manage to stay awake, and I got there ten
minutes early, too. (The deity for classes I'm in enrolled in, however, is
not so generous.) Anyway, as I entered Bishop Auditorium 1 suspi
ciously eyed the students already seated, and the way they sat there —
with their little notebooks already out and their brains evidently hum
ming away. The professor showed up soon after I did, and I thought
triumphantly, "Aha, that's why these kids are so early — maybe this
guy always jumps the gun and the poor freshmen have to be ready."
Not the case, however. Instead of providing me with fat fodder to
feed my hungry editors, the professor gave a very interesting, orga
nized lecture on the competing historical interpretations of the colo
nial period in India. As for the students, hardly anyone was asleep,
and the room was appreciably full fora Monday 10:00 a.m., no less.
Now that I've significantly raised the percentage of my life
spent in I-Hum lecture — and I kid not, 10 percent is a conserva
tive estimate — I can now say that I'm a better person. After all, I
have a mildly better understanding of what CASA is. I learned
that there are three main interpretations for the colonial history of
India (colonial, nationalist and subaltern). Finally, 1 learned that
not everyone else grudges their Area 1 experience as much as I did.
Yes sir, I can honestly say that I don't regret having gone to lecture
this morning.
And really, isn't that what we should all expect from I-Hum?
Statistics gathered at "Encounters and Identities"
- Number of students in class ten minutes ahead of time: 10
- Number of students asleep at half-way point: 0
- Number of students waiting to talk to the prof after class: 0
- On a scale of how strange I felt being there, with 1 being
"completely comfortable" and 10 being "squirming in my seat": 8
