# Eat, Drink, and be Merry
## Life is like a box of chocolates 
### 
Well, four more days until that time of year
again, friends. Even though I still mistak
enly write 2003 on all my lecture notes, ev
eryone (and by everyone, 1 mean most girls
and the guys in touch with their sensitive sides) knows
that Feb. 14 is just around the corner.

Ah, St. Valentine — sometimes you
want to hug the guy for creating a holi
day that justifies a shopping spree at
Victoria's Secret. Other times, you just
want to throw a cup of Natty Light in
his face for reminding all of us single folk
out there of our "table-for-one" status.
But the worst thing about Valen
tine's Day applies to both romance and
friendship. It's the cookie-cutter
genericness that seems to lump all re
lationships into a Russell Stover s

heart-shaped box of assorted chocolates. And, if you
think you're going to make your girl swoon just because
the back of your card says Hallmark, think again,
Casanova. So before you head over to Walgreen s to
pick up a $2.99 love note and a box of conversation
hearts for your honey, PLEASE read on.
So the story typically goes like this: When a guy real
izes that Valentines Day is coming up, he may feel over

whelmed, confused, unsure of what his ambiguously-de
fined relationship calls for in the gift department. (This
tale applies to males and females, but for the sake of
convenience let's just pick one.) Should he get her an ac
tual present? What is she expecting? In the face of these
daunting questions, he should at least opt for the usual,
albeit cliche, suspects — chocolates and flowers. No
brainer — every girl likes chocolates, right?
Trust me, if you show up at her door with that box of
cheesiness, she'll be pretty unimpressed. When I posed
this scenario to the anonymous girl typing at the com
puter next to me, she responded, "I would probably just
poke each one to see if any were even worth eating."
But don't worry. 1 know of a place where a weary
soul can overcome these V-Day doldrums —Kiki's
Candy Bar, an inviting chocolate shop with a lively per
sonality all its own. More upscale than a Sweet Factory
but more intimate than the FAO Schwartz's candy sec
tion, Kiki's has an endearingly kitschy quality to it. With
a retro decor and a selection of obscure candy bars like
"Big Cherry" and "Nestle's Aero Bar," this sweets bou
tique is literally a bar — Willy Wonka-style.
The selection of candy ranges from sumptuous rasp
berry truffles to fun mint-chocolate-malt balls. From
classic chocolate-almond bark to the playful non-pareils
(aka sno-caps) covered in multi-colored sprinkles, you

can mix and match to find the combination most suited
to your valentine. Is her favorite color lavender? Make
a bag exclusively of pastel purple M&M's. Does she like
chocolate-covered strawberries? Buy her the real thing
along with a bag of strawberry-and chocolate-flavored
jellybeans. While you sample and crunch on the candy
coated Jordan almonds, letting them slowly dissolve in
your mouth, you can even sip on one of Kiki's Candy
Bar Cocktail creations — flavored fizzy drinks gar
nished with your favorite fruit candy. Who said EAN
ABs couldn't be exciting?
What makes Kiki's so special, though, isn't its selec
tion of chocolates, truffles or other sugary confections.
It isn't the Strip Chocolate Board Game or the choco
late body-fudge over by the adult corner. It isn't even
related to the food at all — it's about your opportunity
to individualize and personalize your relationship. You
and your girlfriend, boyfriend or best friend cannot be
summarized in that sappy Hallmark card printed across
the world in 20 different languages. Valentine's Day
shouldn't be about the cliche gifts you exchange with
each other, but about an appreciation of what you share
together.
So, when trying to think of a gift or a spot fora ro
mantic dinner, don't go immediately for the Zagat
Guide, however tempting and simple it may seem. For

any other night, I could name countless restaurants with
romantic atmospheres and patios enshrined with can
dles. But what matters on Valentine's Day is that you
choose a restaurant that embodies the spirit of the two
of you together.
Discover and internalize what is unique and special
about your relationship. Don't go for the blanket four
star rating, but choose particular foods that reflect what
you share — whether that connection be spicy, classic or
sweet. This is a holiday to spend time with the ones you
love, so recognize what an important part they play in
your life. Whenever your loved one makes you light up
when he calls or makes you calm down when she smiles,
St. Valentine reappears once a year to make sure you
don't forget it. So put a little effort and creativity into
the gift this time. Why don't you see if Kiki's Candy Bar
can help.
Kiki's Candy Bar is located at 540 Emerson St.. just
off of University Ave.

Any extra candy? Send it Jennie's way. E-mail her at
jhroder@stanford.edu so she can find out where to pick
it up. But please, no carnations this year.

want to throw a cup of Natty Light in
his face for reminding all of us single folk
out there of our "table-for-one" status.
But the worst thing about Valen
tine's Day applies to both romance and
friendship. It's the cookie-cutter
genericness that seems to lump all re
lationships into a Russell Stover s

heart-shaped box of assorted chocolates. And, if you
think you're going to make your girl swoon just because
the back of your card says Hallmark, think again,
Casanova. So before you head over to Walgreen s to
pick up a $2.99 love note and a box of conversation
hearts for your honey, PLEASE read on.
So the story typically goes like this: When a guy real
izes that Valentines Day is coming up, he may feel over

whelmed, confused, unsure of what his ambiguously-de
fined relationship calls for in the gift department. (This
tale applies to males and females, but for the sake of
convenience let's just pick one.) Should he get her an ac
tual present? What is she expecting? In the face of these
daunting questions, he should at least opt for the usual,
albeit cliche, suspects — chocolates and flowers. No
brainer — every girl likes chocolates, right?
Trust me, if you show up at her door with that box of
cheesiness, she'll be pretty unimpressed. When I posed
this scenario to the anonymous girl typing at the com
puter next to me, she responded, "I would probably just
poke each one to see if any were even worth eating."
But don't worry. 1 know of a place where a weary
soul can overcome these V-Day doldrums —Kiki's
Candy Bar, an inviting chocolate shop with a lively per
sonality all its own. More upscale than a Sweet Factory
but more intimate than the FAO Schwartz's candy sec
tion, Kiki's has an endearingly kitschy quality to it. With
a retro decor and a selection of obscure candy bars like
"Big Cherry" and "Nestle's Aero Bar," this sweets bou
tique is literally a bar — Willy Wonka-style.
The selection of candy ranges from sumptuous rasp
berry truffles to fun mint-chocolate-malt balls. From
classic chocolate-almond bark to the playful non-pareils
(aka sno-caps) covered in multi-colored sprinkles, you

can mix and match to find the combination most suited
to your valentine. Is her favorite color lavender? Make
a bag exclusively of pastel purple M&M's. Does she like
chocolate-covered strawberries? Buy her the real thing
along with a bag of strawberry-and chocolate-flavored
jellybeans. While you sample and crunch on the candy
coated Jordan almonds, letting them slowly dissolve in
your mouth, you can even sip on one of Kiki's Candy
Bar Cocktail creations — flavored fizzy drinks gar
nished with your favorite fruit candy. Who said EAN
ABs couldn't be exciting?
What makes Kiki's so special, though, isn't its selec
tion of chocolates, truffles or other sugary confections.
It isn't the Strip Chocolate Board Game or the choco
late body-fudge over by the adult corner. It isn't even
related to the food at all — it's about your opportunity
to individualize and personalize your relationship. You
and your girlfriend, boyfriend or best friend cannot be
summarized in that sappy Hallmark card printed across
the world in 20 different languages. Valentine's Day
shouldn't be about the cliche gifts you exchange with
each other, but about an appreciation of what you share
together.
So, when trying to think of a gift or a spot fora ro
mantic dinner, don't go immediately for the Zagat
Guide, however tempting and simple it may seem. For

any other night, I could name countless restaurants with
romantic atmospheres and patios enshrined with can
dles. But what matters on Valentine's Day is that you
choose a restaurant that embodies the spirit of the two
of you together.
Discover and internalize what is unique and special
about your relationship. Don't go for the blanket four
star rating, but choose particular foods that reflect what
you share — whether that connection be spicy, classic or
sweet. This is a holiday to spend time with the ones you
love, so recognize what an important part they play in
your life. Whenever your loved one makes you light up
when he calls or makes you calm down when she smiles,
St. Valentine reappears once a year to make sure you
don't forget it. So put a little effort and creativity into
the gift this time. Why don't you see if Kiki's Candy Bar
can help.
Kiki's Candy Bar is located at 540 Emerson St.. just
off of University Ave.

Any extra candy? Send it Jennie's way. E-mail her at
jhroder@stanford.edu so she can find out where to pick
it up. But please, no carnations this year.

Well, four more days until that time of year
again, friends. Even though I still mistak
enly write 2003 on all my lecture notes, ev
eryone (and by everyone, 1 mean most girls
and the guys in touch with their sensitive sides) knows
that Feb. 14 is just around the corner.

Ah, St. Valentine — sometimes you
want to hug the guy for creating a holi
day that justifies a shopping spree at
Victoria's Secret. Other times, you just
want to throw a cup of Natty Light in
his face for reminding all of us single folk
out there of our "table-for-one" status.
