## The
						Stanford Daily Editorial Summer dining is too pricey 
### 
While Stanford offers many fine summer
research and academic opportunities
such as Summer Research College
(S RC), the lack of suitable dining options
available to students who participate in these programs
has often caused dissatisfaction and frustration. This
past summer, for example, undergraduate students liv
ing on campus in Florence Moore Hall and Roble Hall
— where many undergraduate summer residents are
assigned to live— were required to purchase, at mini
mum, a seven-meal plan that cost $1,246. This is unrea
sonable, given these students' varying dining needs. We
believe that Residential & Dining Enterprises can im
prove students' summer experiences by introducing at
least one substantially less-expensive meal plan option
for these undergraduates.
Dining plans can help foster residential education
by bringing students together at meal times to discuss
current events and their intellectual work, as well as to
participate in community building. In addition, plans
offer students the convenience and nutrition of pre
pared meals. However, summer dining costs have been
so high in the past — even for the Bay Area — that
some students have foregone the convenience of living
on campus in order to live off campus to reduce their
living costs. Students should not be forced to live off
campus due to overly rigid meal plan options.
Take the example of an SRC participant who re
lies on summer earnings to pay for expenses for the
whole year. Such a student receives $4,500 for the
summer, but, after paying for housing, mandatory in
terim housing (another controversial fee) and a meal

plan, is left with only about $1,700 to pay for all reg
ular and discretionary expenses for the rest of the
summer. II a $500 meal plan were offered to all un
dergraduates, a student's retained earnings could in
crease by roughly 40 percent.
Unreasonably priced dining plans can also take a
toll on students' participation in an intellectual en
terprise. Undergraduate researchers often feel com
pelled to return to their dorms to eat meals for which
they pre-paid, and they are therefore unable to work
on the same schedule as their mentors and fellow re
searchers. These students, as a result, lose valuable
opportunities to develop mentoring relationships
and to exchange ideas with fellow researchers.
And it is important to note that complaints of
the educational drawbacks of past summer dining
plans are not limited to students alone. Faculty
members involved with SRC, for instance, have ex
pressed frustration at having to schedule their rou
tines around the hours of dining services.
Residential & Dining Enterprises needs to balance
the financial and educational costs to students against
the mission of Residential Education by designing a
more flexible array of undergraduate summer session
meal plan options. Or perhaps. Residential & Dining
Enterprises could more simply solve the problem by
allowing all undergraduate summer residents to reg
ister for the $508 five-meal per week plan that has
been offered in the past to those who did not reside in
FloMo or Roble. This way, students would not be
forced to pay for meals they cannot eat. And more
importantly, their needs would be better met.
