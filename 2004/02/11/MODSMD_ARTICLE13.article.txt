## The 						FDA's monopoly must be ended 
### DAVID R. HENDERSON 
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration's (FDA) recent ban
on dietary supplements con
taining ephedra shows just
how dysfunctional government reg
ulation of drugs and dietary supple
ments is. Ephedra, according to the
FDA, is a naturally existing sub
stance derived from a Chinese herb.
Ephedrine, the main active ingredi
ent of ephedra, has been used for
centuries to treat respiratory symp
toms and is also used to aid weight
loss, enhance sports performance
and increase energy.
Why the ban? The FDA claims
that dietary supplements containing
ephedra pose "an unreasonable
risk" for the consumer. The FDA
states in a press release that it re
viewed "a seminal report by the
RAND Corporation" (RAND).
But in the fine print, you read that, of
16,(XM) adverse events RAND stud
ied, there were two deaths, four
heart attacks, nine strokes, one
seizure and five psychiatric cases.
RAND said these events "may indi
cate a safety problem but do not
prove that ephedra caused the ad
verse event" (emphasis added).

Even Naderite Sidney Wolfe, a self
proclaimed consumer advocate,
claims only 155 ephedra-related
deaths over a decade.
Interestingly, many users of such
dietary supplements rushed to stock
up on their supplies before the ban be
gins. They judged, apparently, that the
benefits were worth the risks. To the
FDA. though, their judgment does not
count. And therein lies the problem.
The same problem arises with the
FDA's requirement that drug com
panies test for safety and efficacy be
fore being allowed to sell a drug. This
FDA monopoly power on new drugs
slows new drug development by
years. In December 1988, for exam
ple, the FDA approved Misoprostol,
a drug that prevents gastric ulcers
caused by aspirin. In some other
countries. Misoprostol was available
as early as 1985. Using the FDA's
own estimates, Sam Kazman, an
FDA expert at the Competitive En
terprise Institute, calculated that the
FDA-caused delay cost more than
20,000 lives — and that's just for one
delayed drug.
The tragedy is that these regula
tions are unnecessary. The FDA may
have expertise on drug safety and ef
ficacy, but on the main issue that mat

ters — our trade-off among various
risks, costs and benefits — the FDA
is a rank amateur. No one would ad
vocate that the government plan the
same vacation for everyone. Why,
then, should the government be able
to decide what drugs we ingest?
There is a simple solution: Pare
back the FDA s powers to that of an
information agency. Require that
any drug marketed without FDA ap
proval tout that fact in big letters.
And let us make our own trade-offs.
Then, those who want to avoid all
drugs not certified by the FDA can
do so; the rest of us can rely on the
American Hospital Formulary Ser
vice or other private certifiers and
thus have wider choices. Those who
stuck with FDA certification would
be no worse off. Those who tried
non-FDA-approved drugs would be,
by their standards, better off.
