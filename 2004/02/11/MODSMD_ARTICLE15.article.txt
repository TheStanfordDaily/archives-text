# OP-ED
## RYM misrepresented SCR 
### BOB SENSENBRENNER 
The Republican Youth Majori
ty's (RYM) op-ed in The Stanford
Daily yesterday ("RYM deserves a
place on the Farm." Feb. 10) is mis
leading and is an example of what
happens when outside organiza
tions meddle with Stanford politics.
The RYM's field representatives
misconstrue the facts and display a
poor knowledge of the history of
Stanford student groups.
First, let us review some facts.
The Stanford College Republicans
(SCR) represents a broad based
coalition open to moderates, liber
tarians and conservatives. These di
verse viewpoints are represented in
our board, our activities and in our
membership. We've continually
strived to achieve a balance in our
activities and leadership in order to
cater to our members and students'
desires. In the past, we have
worked with the California Repub
lican League — a liberal Republi
can organization — and have
brought in speakers such as Shane
Patrick Connelley, vice president
of the local Log Cabin Republi
cans. The RYM does not know
about this because its traveling or
ganizers showed up on campus a
week ago and did not bother to re
view the facts.
Second, the RYM is not a Stan
ford student organization — its
leader resides in Maryland and is
attempting to develop a national
political group of "Pro-choice,

pro-environment Republicans."
While the SCR welcomes all cam
pus Republicans into its member
ship and meetings, the RYM has
created a litmus test: Its organizers
claim that they — and only they —
allow and include certain Republi
can viewpoints. Given our person
al experience, we know this to be
untrue.
Third, members of the SCR
leadership had asked the RYM re
peatedly about whether they were
trying to form their own organiza
tion, only to receive ambiguous an
swers. We heard that the RYM was
forming a group on campus approx
imately eight hours before the op
ed appeared in The Daily. We at
tempted to integrate the RYM into
our group in the manner with which
we have worked with other outside
groups and campaigns. This
method, however, was not enough
for the RYM. and it decided to
form its own group. We were in
formed about this plan only at the
last minute.
In the matter of reciprocity, all
the SCR's leaders have worked
hard to cooperate with RYM field
representatives. We have held two
hour meetings on little notice and
have given them some of our mate
rials, which we requested be re
turned but were not. Unfortunate
ly, as Stanford students, we have
obligations other than undertaking
political advocacy all day.
Also, the RYM is not a volun
tary student organization, and as

such — under University policy —
it cannot use White Plaza for solic
itation. Since the RYM said it
would form its own organization, it
is not under the purview of the
SCR. Thus, we told the RYM rep
resentatives that if a student filed a
complaint, they would have to
leave. We encourage spirited de
hate. Indeed, this is one of the rea
sons why the SCR was founded.
However, Stanford facilities are
for Stanford students and not for
any organization that wants to so
licit on campus. Stanford politics
should be for Stanford students
and student organizations, not for
any outside group that wants to
send field representatives. The
SCR is not against political diversi
ty; we are simply in favor of follow
ing the rules here at Stanford —
rules we know because we're a
Stanford organization composed
of Stanford students, not faraway
entrepreneurs in Maryland.
Finally, the RYM has made dis
paraging remarks about the SCR.
We should remind all Republicans
about the so-called "11th Com
mandment" of Republicans, stat
ed by the greatest Republican of
the 20th century. Ronald Reagan.
He said, "Thou shalt not speak ill
of fellow Republicans." Well,
what exactly is the RYM doing?
