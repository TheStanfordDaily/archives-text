Daily offers more
diverse coverage
I have found The Stanford
Daily's articles this quarter are
more diverse, with a greater empha
sis on cultural issues and college
news than in the recent past. 1
thought I would note this so the
Daily staff might be encouraged to
continue reviewing the world from
the perspective of the entire main
stream — including student and
local community views on issues,
our peer institutions' experiences
and issues from international loca
tions that are of great interest to a
significant portion of Stanford stu
dents and scholars. Just thought the
Daily staff should know that I, for
one, am reading The Daily.
THOM MASSEY

SAE should not be 'favored'
in Daily editorial
The Daily's editorial congratu
lating SAE on its parties ("SAE's
Doubleheader a Success," Feb. 10)
clearly shows the ignorance of the
writer of the editorial. First of all,
the parties were not open to all as
claimed in the editorial. SAE had a
list and selectively chose who could
enter its parties. Second, the men's
basketball team making an appear
ance is nothing special; team mem
bers have been seen at parties near
ly every weekend throughout cam
pus. Third, the campus wasn't miss
ing anything without SAE parties
because there have been plenty of
parties every weekend this quarter.
For example, on Saturday night
there were parties at three fraterni
ties and at least two other row hous
es. Furthermore, the editorial says

SAE "exhibited a commitment to
the spirit of University policy" dur
ing its time on probation. Every
other house on campus has also
shown their commitment to the so
cial scene at Stanford and exhibited
positive behavior throughout the
year. Blatantly favoring SAE in an
article that could be applied to any
weekend at any fraternity destroys
the bonds of brotherhood that we as
a campus attempt to maintain. SAE
has taken steps to improve the so
cial scene at Stanford, as stated in
the article, but so have every other
house on campus. Printing editori
als that support SAE and celebrate
its release from probation is equiv
alent to writing articles that cele
brate the release of John Allen
Muhammad and John Lee Malvo.
SAE was on social and housing pro
bation for reasons and should not
be described as the savior to Stan
ford's social scene.

Sixth Man should move
beyond imitation
Do we want to be like everyone
else? That is what The Daily's edito
rial ("Sixth Man Club inspires Card."
Feb. 10) that praises the Sixth Man
Club implies. Any weekend during
the college basketball season, you
can turn on your television and see a
bunch of college students from any
university all dressed in the same
color t-shirts, all chanting the same
type of cheers. Has Stanford become
this unimaginative?
The editorial compares the Sixth
Man Club to Duke's student sec
tion. but the two have little in com
mon. At Duke — where 1 witnessed
many a game growing up — the stu

dents never dress in a single color
and surround all sides of the court
instead of one small section. They
know that it takes more than four
tents to constitute a "village." They
are forced to "worship" their men's
basketball team because most of
their other sports are nowhere close
to the level of Stanford's teams. If
these students are so brilliant, why
didn't they come to Stanford?
I think we are more creative than
Duke's students —or are we? My
friend and I attended the Cal v. Stan
ford game this year and were sadly
disappointed in the Sixth Man Club.
The Yell leaders in their red overalls
did absolutely nothing except talk to
each other and stand around. The
Sixth Man section, if anything, was re
actionary, waiting for Cal to close the
margin before cheering loudly in re
sponse and waving Hags. What hap
pened to the days when Stanford led
the charge, when the Tree would kick
Oski's butt if he even set foot on the
floor of Maples?
Maybe the Yell leaders and stu
dents were listless during the game
because they realized that the con
trived Sixth Man Club is not what
Stanford is about.
The greatness of Stanford is
being itself and not just what we per
ceive a great basketball program to
be. This is the spirit that carried us
to victory in the days long before
huge Stanford flags, the failed ex
periment with cheerleaders and
Sixth Man Club. Granted, the talent
quotient was much lower (although
victories over No. 1 Arizona hap
pened), but the sentiments of the
supporting students was much
greater and they did not look to oth
ers to define themselves.

tents to constitute a "village." They
are forced to "worship" their men's
basketball team because most of
their other sports are nowhere close
to the level of Stanford's teams. If
these students are so brilliant, why
didn't they come to Stanford?
I think we are more creative than
Duke's students —or are we? My
friend and I attended the Cal v. Stan
ford game this year and were sadly
disappointed in the Sixth Man Club.
The Yell leaders in their red overalls
did absolutely nothing except talk to
each other and stand around. The
Sixth Man section, if anything, was re
actionary, waiting for Cal to close the
margin before cheering loudly in re
sponse and waving Hags. What hap
pened to the days when Stanford led
the charge, when the Tree would kick
Oski's butt if he even set foot on the
floor of Maples?
Maybe the Yell leaders and stu
dents were listless during the game
because they realized that the con
trived Sixth Man Club is not what
Stanford is about.
The greatness of Stanford is
being itself and not just what we per
ceive a great basketball program to
be. This is the spirit that carried us
to victory in the days long before
huge Stanford flags, the failed ex
periment with cheerleaders and
Sixth Man Club. Granted, the talent
quotient was much lower (although
victories over No. 1 Arizona hap
pened), but the sentiments of the
supporting students was much
greater and they did not look to oth
ers to define themselves.

Daily offers more
diverse coverage
I have found The Stanford
Daily's articles this quarter are
more diverse, with a greater empha
sis on cultural issues and college
news than in the recent past. 1
thought I would note this so the
Daily staff might be encouraged to
continue reviewing the world from
the perspective of the entire main
stream — including student and
local community views on issues,
our peer institutions' experiences
and issues from international loca
tions that are of great interest to a
significant portion of Stanford stu
dents and scholars. Just thought the
Daily staff should know that I, for
one, am reading The Daily.

SAE should not be 'favored'
in Daily editorial
The Daily's editorial congratu
lating SAE on its parties ("SAE's
Doubleheader a Success," Feb. 10)
clearly shows the ignorance of the
writer of the editorial. First of all,
the parties were not open to all as
claimed in the editorial. SAE had a
list and selectively chose who could
enter its parties. Second, the men's
basketball team making an appear
ance is nothing special; team mem
bers have been seen at parties near
ly every weekend throughout cam
pus. Third, the campus wasn't miss
ing anything without SAE parties
because there have been plenty of
parties every weekend this quarter.
For example, on Saturday night
there were parties at three fraterni
ties and at least two other row hous
es. Furthermore, the editorial says

SAE "exhibited a commitment to
the spirit of University policy" dur
ing its time on probation. Every
other house on campus has also
shown their commitment to the so
cial scene at Stanford and exhibited
positive behavior throughout the
year. Blatantly favoring SAE in an
article that could be applied to any
weekend at any fraternity destroys
the bonds of brotherhood that we as
a campus attempt to maintain. SAE
has taken steps to improve the so
cial scene at Stanford, as stated in
the article, but so have every other
house on campus. Printing editori
als that support SAE and celebrate
its release from probation is equiv
alent to writing articles that cele
brate the release of John Allen
Muhammad and John Lee Malvo.
SAE was on social and housing pro
bation for reasons and should not
be described as the savior to Stan
ford's social scene.

Sixth Man should move
beyond imitation
Do we want to be like everyone
else? That is what The Daily's edito
rial ("Sixth Man Club inspires Card."
Feb. 10) that praises the Sixth Man
Club implies. Any weekend during
the college basketball season, you
can turn on your television and see a
bunch of college students from any
university all dressed in the same
color t-shirts, all chanting the same
type of cheers. Has Stanford become
this unimaginative?
The editorial compares the Sixth
Man Club to Duke's student sec
tion. but the two have little in com
mon. At Duke — where 1 witnessed
many a game growing up — the stu

dents never dress in a single color
and surround all sides of the court
instead of one small section. They
know that it takes more than four
tents to constitute a "village." They
are forced to "worship" their men's
basketball team because most of
their other sports are nowhere close
to the level of Stanford's teams. If
these students are so brilliant, why
didn't they come to Stanford?
