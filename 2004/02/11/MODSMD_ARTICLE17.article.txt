# Pondering the significance of a silly mascot
## 
### 
Let's he honest with ourselves — our
mascot is lame. Having abandoned
our nickname of "Indians" in 1972,
after careful consideration of the sub
missions from students ("Robber Barons,"
"Griffins" and "Sequoias" were all suggested),
the University settled on a color.
This accomplished a twofold purpose. First,
it satisfied the requirement of being politically
correct from every possible angle (we don't
want to offend the SPCA or any historical or
ethnic group). It also forced (allowed?) its stu
dents to forever correct those who add an "s"
to the end of "Cardinal." Then, the adminis
tration decided to symbolically tie itself to the
city of Palo Alto by adopting the Tree as its un
official bandleader. The Tree itself is not even
our mascot — it's just another slightly more
well-dressed and physically-attractive member
of the Band. And so, at our sporting events,
we're led to cheer fora hue of red by a drunk-

en (not that that's bad) Cal
ifornia pine.
The Tree, like the Band,
is a great symbol of the Uni
versity. It's one of the most
beloved collegiate icons in
the country. It's quirky and
weird, and, as we love to in
form prospective freshmen,
we are nothing if not quirky.
But at some point, you need

to stop dancing around like a moth addict with
withdrawal spasms and intimidate someone.
Sports are about power. They're a barely
controlled stand-in for physical violence that
often explodes into just that — physical vio
lence. And when a 300-pound offensive line
man is illegally jamming his fingers up some
one else's facemask. you don't want him chan
neling rage from an inanimate object or, worse,
a color.
We could use a lesson from the best mascots,
which fulfill two criteria: instilling fear and
being regionally appropriate. The vanguard for
this group is Notre Dame. Their Fighting Irish
mascot could only be more fitting if he stag
gered around with a jug of moonshine, outlaw
ing birth control and challenging larger ethnic
stereotypes to fight him Plus, nothing strikes
terror into the hearts of men more than a
drunken potato farmer in a bow tie.
I want a mascot that is capable of beating
up the other team's mascot if it so desires. I
want an animal that will rip someone's fingers
off and spit them back at me in a mixture of
blood and saliva. I want a slightly less homo
erotic soldier than Tommy Trojan. I want a
wolverine, or at the very least a rabid, saber
toothed black squirrel.
Still, it could he worse — much worse. At
least we're not one of the hundreds of uno
riginal schools that call themselves Wildcats,
or Tigers, or. lamest of all. Bears. Then, at
the other extreme, is the school that wants to
be unique and comes off just being an object
of ridicule. The Vanderbilt Commodores,
for instance, inspire images of a naval officer
dressed in leggings and a Napoleon-style hat
signing with Motown Records and singing
"Brick House." Nobody respects a Com
modore, as indicated by Vandy's DiMaggio
like streak of last-place football finishes in
the SEC.
Look, we're an academic and athletic pow
erhouse. Everyone knows we're good at every
thing. So why resort to the type of Ivy-coated
pretentiousness that lesser East Coast schools
are built on? Not to name names, but this situ
ation isn't dismissing the continued accusa
tions that we have an inferiority complex to
ward a certain school whose athletic teams go
by "Crimson." It's almost as if we took a page
from their leather-bound, gold-inlaid play
book, which is certainly inscribed with the
phrase "We are better than you."
1 don't know what to do about this situation.
I wouldn't advocate a change, because now we
have a strong tradition based on "Cardinal,"
and I feel like tradition is what makes or breaks
a college sports program. I'm just saying that
maybe the Stanford students of the early '70s
could have made a better decision.
All this bothered me up until Saturday
morning, when Nick Robinson drained a 35-
footer and convinced me that all was well
with the world. The Tree was in the center of
the mass of black and red shirts that explod
ed onto the floor, and it wouldn't have been
the same any other way. And you know that
when you can put Tiger Woods, his incredi
bly hot fiancee, and Bill Walsh in the same
room in support of a color, that color is pret
ty damn powerful.
So while it may be that we don't have an in
timidating mascot, we must be doing some
thing right. You can always parade around a
caged animal, and you can always scream in
chorus at the sword thrusts of a warrior. But
vou can only bleed Cardinal.

controlled stand-in for physical violence that
often explodes into just that — physical vio
lence. And when a 300-pound offensive line
man is illegally jamming his fingers up some
one else's facemask. you don't want him chan
neling rage from an inanimate object or, worse,
a color.
We could use a lesson from the best mascots,
which fulfill two criteria: instilling fear and
being regionally appropriate. The vanguard for
this group is Notre Dame. Their Fighting Irish
mascot could only be more fitting if he stag
gered around with a jug of moonshine, outlaw
ing birth control and challenging larger ethnic
stereotypes to fight him Plus, nothing strikes
terror into the hearts of men more than a
drunken potato farmer in a bow tie.
I want a mascot that is capable of beating
up the other team's mascot if it so desires. I
want an animal that will rip someone's fingers
off and spit them back at me in a mixture of
blood and saliva. I want a slightly less homo
erotic soldier than Tommy Trojan. I want a
wolverine, or at the very least a rabid, saber
toothed black squirrel.
Still, it could he worse — much worse. At
least we're not one of the hundreds of uno
riginal schools that call themselves Wildcats,
or Tigers, or. lamest of all. Bears. Then, at
the other extreme, is the school that wants to
be unique and comes off just being an object
of ridicule. The Vanderbilt Commodores,
for instance, inspire images of a naval officer
dressed in leggings and a Napoleon-style hat
signing with Motown Records and singing
"Brick House." Nobody respects a Com
modore, as indicated by Vandy's DiMaggio
like streak of last-place football finishes in
the SEC.
Look, we're an academic and athletic pow
erhouse. Everyone knows we're good at every
thing. So why resort to the type of Ivy-coated
pretentiousness that lesser East Coast schools
are built on? Not to name names, but this situ
ation isn't dismissing the continued accusa
tions that we have an inferiority complex to
ward a certain school whose athletic teams go
by "Crimson." It's almost as if we took a page
from their leather-bound, gold-inlaid play
book, which is certainly inscribed with the
phrase "We are better than you."
1 don't know what to do about this situation.
I wouldn't advocate a change, because now we
have a strong tradition based on "Cardinal,"
and I feel like tradition is what makes or breaks
a college sports program. I'm just saying that
maybe the Stanford students of the early '70s
could have made a better decision.
All this bothered me up until Saturday
morning, when Nick Robinson drained a 35-
footer and convinced me that all was well
with the world. The Tree was in the center of
the mass of black and red shirts that explod
ed onto the floor, and it wouldn't have been
the same any other way. And you know that
when you can put Tiger Woods, his incredi
bly hot fiancee, and Bill Walsh in the same
room in support of a color, that color is pret
ty damn powerful.
So while it may be that we don't have an in
timidating mascot, we must be doing some
thing right. You can always parade around a
caged animal, and you can always scream in
chorus at the sword thrusts of a warrior. But
vou can only bleed Cardinal.

Let's he honest with ourselves — our
mascot is lame. Having abandoned
our nickname of "Indians" in 1972,
after careful consideration of the sub
missions from students ("Robber Barons,"
"Griffins" and "Sequoias" were all suggested),
the University settled on a color.
This accomplished a twofold purpose. First,
it satisfied the requirement of being politically
correct from every possible angle (we don't
want to offend the SPCA or any historical or
ethnic group). It also forced (allowed?) its stu
dents to forever correct those who add an "s"
to the end of "Cardinal." Then, the adminis
tration decided to symbolically tie itself to the
city of Palo Alto by adopting the Tree as its un
official bandleader. The Tree itself is not even
our mascot — it's just another slightly more
well-dressed and physically-attractive member
of the Band. And so, at our sporting events,
we're led to cheer fora hue of red by a drunk-

en (not that that's bad) Cal
ifornia pine.
The Tree, like the Band,
is a great symbol of the Uni
versity. It's one of the most
beloved collegiate icons in
the country. It's quirky and
weird, and, as we love to in
form prospective freshmen,
we are nothing if not quirky.
But at some point, you need

to stop dancing around like a moth addict with
withdrawal spasms and intimidate someone.
