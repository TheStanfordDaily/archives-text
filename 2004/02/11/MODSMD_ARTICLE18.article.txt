## Pacific-10 picture redrawn last week 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a weekend of upheaval in the Pacific-10 Conference, highlighted by No. 16 Arizona's
drop from second to fourth place in the conference standings after losses to California —
which holds sole possession of second place now — and, of course, conference-frontrunner
Stanford (20-0,11-0 Pac-10).
Cal, like Stanford, defeated Arizona (14-6,6-5) and Arizona State last weekend, running its
record to 11 -9,7-4.
The Pac-10 Tournament field appears close to sewn up, as both Oregon State (8-12,2-8) and
Arizona State (8-12, 2-9) dropped both their games last week and now lag two wins behind
eigth-place Southern California (9-11, 4-7). Eight teams make the conference's postseason
tournament to decide who will get the Pac-10's guaranteed NCAA Tournament berth.
Oregon (11-6,6-4) holds third place, thanks to a comeback victory on Saturday over rival
Oregon State in Eugene, Ore.
But the story of the weekend was undoubtedly Stanford's stunning victory over visiting
Arizona on Saturday. The short-handed Cardinal dispatched Arizona State with surpsing
ease on Thursday, winning 81-51 behind a 17-point. six-rebound effort from center Rob Lit
tle, who helped hold the Sun Devils' terror in the paint. Ike Diogu, to just 14 points on 6-of
-14 shooting.
But Arizona, probably the Pac-10 team with the most natural athletic ability, played beyond
its years in the second half on Saturday, taking a four-point lead with a minute to play on a long
three from the unstoppable Salim Stoudamire, who scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting.
Stanford fans know what happens next. A free throw and a baseline three from Childress,
two turnovers forced by Matt Lottich and, of course, a 35-foot prayer from Nick Robinson
spelled victory for the Cardinal.
While Stanford added a new emotional and statistical high to what is now a record season.
Arizona endured another crushing, close loss. On Thursday, the Wildcats — perhaps looking
ahead to their next game — were stunned by Cal, 87-83. Freshman center Leon Powe explod
ed for 21 points and 12 boards, while 6-foot-11 marksman Amit Tamir spaced the floor by hit
ting five 3-pointers and adding 21 points of his own. Tack on Richard Midgley's 18 points on
just seven shots and you have the makings of an upset.
Arizona countered with a 25-point, eight-rebound effort from Andre Iguodala, but its lack
adaisical defense and cold perimeter shooting were too much to overcome. The Wildcats shot
5-of-20 from long range, while allowing Cal to launch 19 treys, of which the Golden Bears made
10.
On Saturday, Cal nudged Arizona State. 85-83, despite a 33-point effort from Diogu, who
hit 9-of-l6 from the floor and 13-of-16 from the line despite constant harrying by Cal. Diogu
did commit eight turnovers, though, and received an inconsistent effort from his teammates —

save the reliable Jamal Hill, who post
ed 17 points on 6-of-12 shooting.
Cal got a much-need 24-point ef
fort from freshman forward Marquise
Kately, who hit 7-of-10 shots and 10-
of-17 free throws. Midgley continued
his midseason resurgence by tossing
in 20 points on 6-of-10 shooting.
Cal finds itself alone in second
place despite a record of just 11-9. Its
Feb. 26 home matchup against Ore
gon could well decide second place in
the conference this year.
In Oregon. Luke Jackson put on a
second-half clinic, finishing with 24
points and seven boards to lead the
Ducks over Oregon State. The
Beavers were handed their sixth
straight loss despite an impressive 20-
point effort by David Lucas, who
often had to matched up against Jack
son and fellow Oregon big man lan
Crosswhite, who finished with 16

points and seven rebounds.
In the middle of the conference
ranks, UCLA (10-9,6-5) lost at home
to Washington State on Thursday, 55-
48 — the first time the Cougars have
ever won in 39 tries at Pauley Pavil
ion. Legendary coach Dick Bennett,
in his first year at the helm of Wash
ington State, got 15 points from
Thomas Kelati and 13 from Jeff
Varem as the Cougars (11-10, 5-6)
ended a 46-game losing streak against
the once-indomitable Bruins. UCLA
got 15 apiece from T.J. Cummings
and Dijon Thompson, but shot just 35
percent, as Bennett bested the Bru
ins' Ben Howland in a battle of two
teams trying to win with slowdown
tactics this year.
UCLA ended its six-game losing
streak on Saturday with an important
win over Washington (10-9, 5-6), 80-
75. The Huskies came into the contest
riding a five-game winning streak,
their longest since 1999. Cummings
totaled 18 points and 11 board on 9-
of-12 shooting to lead the Bruins, who
shot 53 percent to Washington's 43

percent.
The Huskies had only one player
in double figures, but that man, for
ward Brandon Roy, exploded fora
career-high 30 points and nine boards
on 12-of-18 shooting to keep things
close throughout.
Washington was coming off a 93-
82 Thursday win against USC in
which Roy led the way with 17 points.
In a matchup of the Pac-10's two most
up-tempo, free-form offenses,
though, it was senior Trojan guard
Desmon Farmer who stole the show.
Farmer, USC's one-man army, took
20 of the Trojans' 60 shots, making 10
of them en route to a game-high 31
points.
The Trojans suffered another set
back on Saturday, as the visiting
Cougars controlled the tempo and
won, 61-50. USC had a hand in its own
undoing, hitting just 8-of-20 foul
shots. Farmer had 17 points to lead
the Trojans, but shot just 4-of-l 3 from
the floor and an uncharacteristic 5-of
-12 from the line.
Marcus Moore (14 points). Kelati

(13), Varem (12) and Chris Schlatter
(11) all reached double figures for the
Cougars, which hit 16-of-21 free
throws. Varem was l()-of-13 from the
line.
This weekend's marquee
matchup will come this Saturday at
Haas Pavilion, when conference
No. I Stanford and conference No. 2
Cal will square off. Cal has a chance
to secure second place in the Pac-10
for at least one more week, while
Stanford could stretch its season
long winning streak to a school
record 21 games.
On Thursday, Arizona will try to
gel back on track against USC in Tuc
son, while UCLA travels to Arizona
State. Washington welcomes Oregon,
while Washington State faces visiting
Oregon State.
In addition to Cal-Stanford, Sat
urday will see UCLA come calling
on Arizona and Arizona State will
host USC, while Washington State
will host Oregon State and Wash
ington will ask Oregon to be its
valentine.
