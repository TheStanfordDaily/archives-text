## Pacific-10 picture redrawn last week 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
It was a weekend of upheaval in the Pacific-10 Conference, highlighted by No. 16 Arizona's
drop from second to fourth place in the conference standings after losses to California —
which holds sole possession of second place now — and, of course, conference-frontrunner
Stanford (20-0,11-0 Pac-10).
Cal, like Stanford, defeated Arizona (14-6,6-5) and Arizona State last weekend, running its
record to 11 -9,7-4.
The Pac-10 Tournament field appears close to sewn up, as both Oregon State (8-12,2-8) and
Arizona State (8-12, 2-9) dropped both their games last week and now lag two wins behind
eigth-place Southern California (9-11, 4-7). Eight teams make the conference's postseason
tournament to decide who will get the Pac-10's guaranteed NCAA Tournament berth.
Oregon (11-6,6-4) holds third place, thanks to a comeback victory on Saturday over rival
Oregon State in Eugene, Ore.
But the story of the weekend was undoubtedly Stanford's stunning victory over visiting
Arizona on Saturday. The short-handed Cardinal dispatched Arizona State with surpsing
ease on Thursday, winning 81-51 behind a 17-point. six-rebound effort from center Rob Lit
tle, who helped hold the Sun Devils' terror in the paint. Ike Diogu, to just 14 points on 6-of
-14 shooting.
But Arizona, probably the Pac-10 team with the most natural athletic ability, played beyond
its years in the second half on Saturday, taking a four-point lead with a minute to play on a long
three from the unstoppable Salim Stoudamire, who scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting.
Stanford fans know what happens next. A free throw and a baseline three from Childress,
two turnovers forced by Matt Lottich and, of course, a 35-foot prayer from Nick Robinson
spelled victory for the Cardinal.
While Stanford added a new emotional and statistical high to what is now a record season.
Arizona endured another crushing, close loss. On Thursday, the Wildcats — perhaps looking
ahead to their next game — were stunned by Cal, 87-83. Freshman center Leon Powe explod
ed for 21 points and 12 boards, while 6-foot-11 marksman Amit Tamir spaced the floor by hit
ting five 3-pointers and adding 21 points of his own. Tack on Richard Midgley's 18 points on
just seven shots and you have the makings of an upset.
Arizona countered with a 25-point, eight-rebound effort from Andre Iguodala, but its lack
adaisical defense and cold perimeter shooting were too much to overcome. The Wildcats shot
5-of-20 from long range, while allowing Cal to launch 19 treys, of which the Golden Bears made
10.
On Saturday, Cal nudged Arizona State. 85-83, despite a 33-point effort from Diogu, who
hit 9-of-l6 from the floor and 13-of-16 from the line despite constant harrying by Cal. Diogu
did commit eight turnovers, though, and received an inconsistent effort from his teammates —
