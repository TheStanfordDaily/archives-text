When Nick Robinson's desperation heave from 35 feet swished through the net to give No. 2
Stanford an 80-77 win over Arizona on Saturday, the Sixth Man Club stormed the court to cele
brate with the Cardinal players.
Similarly, when Tucson High School's Joe Kay — a 4:0 student with a full volleyball scholar
ship to Stanford for next year — ended a 62-54 win over Tucson Salpointe Catholic with a thun
derous slam dunk, excited fans stormed the court and swarmed the senior forward.
In an incident captured on game video, Kay was surrounded by a mass of fans and, in the pan
demonium, suffered a fractured jaw and a torn carotid artery and, as a result of the torn artery,
suffered a stroke. The carotid artery is a vessel that supplies blood to the brain.
Kay remained in intensive care Monday at the Arizona University Medical Center in Tuc
son. He is listed in serious condition, but there are signs of improvement — Kay ate breakfast
yesterday morning and spoke briefly, Tucson High School head coach Gary Lewis told the
Arizona Republic.
After being injured in the throng, Kay tried to walk back to his team's bench, and was assist
ed by his teammates.
"I got on one side and walked him over." Lewis said. "When we got to the locker room, he
couldn't walk at all. and we had to drag him in. We knew something was serious."
Kay's injury was related to students over the public address system on Tuesday, and coun
selors were available. Lewis visited Kay in the hospital on Monday.
"When I left him, he gave me the thumbs up, as if to push everybody through this," Lewis said.
