# Board of Trustees raises tuition
## 
### HELEN KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Board of Trustees increased tuition,
room and board fees yesterday for the 2004-
2005 academic year by a combined 4.5 percent
from the current year's undergraduate rates.
This increase consists of a 4.5 percent raise
in tuition from this year's rate of $28,564 to
$29,847; a 6.1 percent increase in the under
graduate room rate from $4,726 to $5,012; and
a 3.2 percent increase in board from $4,347 to
$4,488.
"After the budget cuts of the last several
years, including no salary increase this past
year, we are beginning to see some improve
ment in the overall economy," Chair of the
Board of Trustees Isaac Stein told the Stanford
Report. "On the other hand, we continue to
have inflationary pressures on our expenses,
and tuition is a critical part of the unrestricted
funding of our operations. We're pleased that
we are again able to hold the overall increase
for undergraduate charges to 4.5 percent."
Stein added that in recent years the net tu
ition has increased less than the published tu
ition figure.
"In other words, we are increasing finan
cial aid faster than we are increasing tuition
so that we're making sure we do not impair
the ability of families to receive the necessary
financial aid to attend Stanford," he said.
As one of the nation's few universities with
a need-blind admission policy, Stanford col
lects only 60 percent of undergraduate educa
tion costs from tuition. Moreover, 46 percent
of undergraduates receive need-based finan
cial aid.
Although tuition for doctoral candidates

who have completed all requirements except
the dissertation has increased by about 50
percent to $10,000 for four quarters, the Re
port said that the new rate is still lower than
figures at similarly ranked universities.
Part-time graduate tuition increased by 4.5

percent from $18,600 to $19,440.
Tuition for the School of Engineering and
the School of Law also increased by 4.5 per
cent, whereas tuition rose by 4.6 percent for
the School of Medicine and 4.9 percent for the
Graduate School of Business.
