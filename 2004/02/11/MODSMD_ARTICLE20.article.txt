### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ESPN announced yesterday that it is marketing No. 2 Stanford's 80-77 victory
last Saturday over then-No. 12 Arizona as a "Instant Classic." The match, which
ended with junior forward Nick Robinson's game-winning 35-foot shot at the
buzzer, will be re-aired on ESPN Classic twice on Thursday — at 4 p.m. and 11
p.m.
The Cardinal came back from a four-point deficit in the final minute to surprise
the upset-hungry Wildcats last Saturday at Maples Pavilion in front of a sellout
crowd that rushed the floor upon Robinson's three-point shot. The game was orig
inally broadcasted on ABC, which owns ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPN Classic.
"We | ABC] certainly got more than we bargained for in Palo Alto on Satur
day," said Burke Mangus. Director of Programming and Acquisitionsjor ESPN.
"What a fantastic game and atmosphere in Maples. It was by far and away the best
game we have aired on ESPN or ABC this season. As such, the folks at ESPN Clas
sic have made the game on 'Instant Classic.' "
ABC will broadcast two of Stanford's seven remaining Pacific-10 Conference
games — its matchup against Oregon at Maples on Feb. 28 and its final Pac-10
game against Washington on March 6 in Seattle.
"When we got back in the locker room [after Saturday's game], these guys were
saying, 'Oh, it's an instant classic, an instant classic,' " Stanford senior center Joe
Kirchofer said. "That was 30 seconds after the game.
"I think it's cool," he added, referring to ESPN's re-airing of the game.
