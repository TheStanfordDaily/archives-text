### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the rest of the Stanford community eagerly awaiting the offi
cial arrival of spring, the men's golf team finds itself enjoying plenty of
sun in an island paradise. The Cardinal kicks off its spring schedule
Wednesday at the Taylor Made Waikoloa in Kona, Hawaii.
After working hard during the customary two-month winter lay
off, the team is eager to get back on the course and improve upon a dis
appointing fall season.
"We had a lot of really good individual scoring," coach Jeff
Mitchell said. "We had some really good rounds on different days, but
we didn't really play the tournaments well We couldn't go three gixxl
rounds in a row and put them back-to-back."
In the course of its five-tournament fall schedule, the Cardinal
managed just two top-10 team finishes, a seventh-place showing at the
Mackenzie Invitational in October and a ninth-place finish at the Nel
son Invitational at the Stanford Golf Course.
Despite Stanford's early difficulties, however, the fall provided a
young team with s( >me much-needed experience.' flic departure of se
niors Jim Seki, Ron Won and George Downing from last year's squad
leaves the Cardinal with just one senior. Blake Mastalir. in the regular
starting five.
Nonetheless, Mitchell believes that this year's group shows
great promise.
"We had four freshman come in, and all four of them played in at
least two tournaments last fall, and so, overall. I think we're a more tal
ented club this year than we were last year."
During the first part of the year, Mastalir led his younger team
mates by example, notching three top-25 finishes in his four events,
and never finishing lower than 31st place individually. He also posted
the team's lowest individual score in three out of his four tournaments.
