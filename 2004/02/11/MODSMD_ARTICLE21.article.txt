# Men's golf kicks off spring season
## 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the rest of the Stanford community eagerly awaiting the offi
cial arrival of spring, the men's golf team finds itself enjoying plenty of
sun in an island paradise. The Cardinal kicks off its spring schedule
Wednesday at the Taylor Made Waikoloa in Kona, Hawaii.
After working hard during the customary two-month winter lay
off, the team is eager to get back on the course and improve upon a dis
appointing fall season.
"We had a lot of really good individual scoring," coach Jeff
Mitchell said. "We had some really good rounds on different days, but
we didn't really play the tournaments well We couldn't go three gixxl
rounds in a row and put them back-to-back."
In the course of its five-tournament fall schedule, the Cardinal
managed just two top-10 team finishes, a seventh-place showing at the
Mackenzie Invitational in October and a ninth-place finish at the Nel
son Invitational at the Stanford Golf Course.
Despite Stanford's early difficulties, however, the fall provided a
young team with s( >me much-needed experience.' flic departure of se
niors Jim Seki, Ron Won and George Downing from last year's squad
leaves the Cardinal with just one senior. Blake Mastalir. in the regular
starting five.
Nonetheless, Mitchell believes that this year's group shows
great promise.
"We had four freshman come in, and all four of them played in at
least two tournaments last fall, and so, overall. I think we're a more tal
ented club this year than we were last year."
During the first part of the year, Mastalir led his younger team
mates by example, notching three top-25 finishes in his four events,
and never finishing lower than 31st place individually. He also posted
the team's lowest individual score in three out of his four tournaments.

Sophomore Brandon Lawson will be part of a larqe group of young golfers competing for Stanford this year. The
Cardinal will begin its spring season at the Taylor Made Waikoloa in Kona, Hawaii.
Junior Kevin Blue and sophomore
Kyle Gentry were the workhorses for
the team in the fall, competing in all five
events. Although Blue rode a bit of a
rollercoaster from week to week, he

managed to put together a pairoftop-25
finishes, and his scoring average of 73.6
was tied for third-best on the team.
Gentry was mostly unable to match
the success that made him a fixture in the
Stanford starting lineup at the end of his
rookie campaign. He did. however, flash
his old form at the Alistei Mackenzie In
vitational. where he shot a career-low 68
en route to a 15th-place finish — also a

personal best.
However, the most impressive
performance of the fall belonged to
freshman Zack Miller. Flaying in four
of the Cardinal's five events, he com
piled a 71.9 stroke average — the best
on the team.
Even more remarkable was his
showing at the Prestige, where he took a
six-stroke lead into the final round of
play. Though a final-round 67 by Texas
Christian sophomore Colby Beckstrom
denied Miller his first collegiate victory,
his second-place finish was easily Stan
ford's best individual performance of
the fall.
Though he admits that his first sea
son has been a time of adjustment.
Miller is flourishing in his new sur
roundings.
"My high school golf team wasn't re
ally that competitive," he said. "It's
great to be on a team where everyone is
good and everyone, on a good day, can
beat each other. I think it really steps up
your game to have that competition."
The Cardinal will try to hit the
ground running at this week's Taylor
Made. Hosted by the University of
Hawaii, the tournament is being held at
the par 72.7.074-yard Waikoloa Kings'
Course.

The 54-hole event, which will stretch
over three days instead of the standard
two, will feature a field of 21 teams. No.
4 UCLA and No. 6 Texas Christian are
likely to play particularly well this week.
The two teams finished first and second,
respectively, at last year's tournament.
UCLA and Texas Christian must
also be considered favorites in the in
dividual competition. The Horned
Frogs' Beckstrom is currently ranked
No. 3 nationally, while teammate
Adam Meyer took home top honors
at this event a year ago. UCLA's
Steve Conway finished in a tie for sec
ond here last year.
Mitchell takes a young lineup to
Kona, including Mastalir. Blue, Miller,
sophomore Scott Mac Donald and
freshman Brandon Lawson. Although
the team struggled to a 21st-place finish
in last year's event, three of the starting
five did not participate a year ago.
Mac Donald felt that the team would
play well if players could stay relaxed
and not press too hard at this early junc
ture.
"We need to keep a big perspective,"
he said. "We have to light hard to play
our best, but realize that it's a long sea
son and our results in Hawaii aren't
going to affect the entire season."
