# Card fall to near-perfect Bruins
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
The No. 7 Cardinal (5-2,2-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) fell to the
reigning national champion. No. 2
UCLA, as the twin powers of Pac
-10 women's gymnastics took to
the vault, beam, bars and floor at
Pauley Pavilion on Sunday.
The matchup was much antici
pated because the two teams tied
at Stanford last year, but UCLA
was the clear victor this year. Stan
ford put up a decent away score of
196.425, which the Bruins topped
with an impressive 197.975 — the
highest team score in the NCAA
this season.
The Cardinal competed well on
vault. All six gymnasts performed
maximum difficulty level vault
routines for the first time this sea
son. Sophomores Natalie Foley
and Glyn Sweets led the charge
over the vaulting table by each
registering a 9.925, a career high
for Foley.
"We're improving our vaults
each weekend," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "It is becoming a
real key event for us."
Although Stanford improved
on vault, scoring their highest
team mark of the season with a
49.325, the team did not perform
as well as usual on the uneven bars
or the balance beam.
Senior Caroline Fluhrer deliv
ered an aggressive routine on the
uneven bars to win the event with
a 9.95. The other gymnasts were
not as relaxed as usual on the
event, however, and their scores
suffered as a result.
"We came out a little tight on
bars," said Smyth.
The Cardinal had its lowest
scoring beam set of the season,
posting a 48.5, which is almost a
full point lower than the beam
score at last weekend's meet
against Washington. Sweets start
ed the event on shaky ground with
a fall on her double turn and
Fluhrer followed suit with a fall on
her tumbling series.
The team did not recover its
edge on the beam until ever-con
sistent seniors Lise Leveille and

Lindsay Wing closed the event
with a 9.825 and 9.85, respectively.
The order in which the gym
nasts compete their routines car
ries strategic importance in the
meet. The first gymnast up sets the
tone and momentum for the
team's effort and generally sets the
baseline for the team's scores.
Scores usually escalate as the line
up continues.
Senior Shelly Goldberg has
done an impressive job leading the
Cardinal with the first routine on
vault and floor over the past three
meets. This past weekend, she set
the tone with a 9.875 and a 9.825
respectively on vault and floor —
Stanford's highest scoring events
of the evening.
"I don't get any more nervous
going first than anywhere else in
the line-up," said Goldberg. "It is a
good position for me to go in at. I
try to set the tone and the start the
team's momentum by doing a
solid, strong routine."
"Shelly has grown so much in
her gymnastics and in her com
petitive attitude this year," said
Smyth. "She is calm and consis
tent so she does an amazing job
as a leader on vault and floor.
The rest of the team is following
her lead."
After every meet, the team
gives out two awards: "nails" to
the toughest competitor, and
"glue" to the most positive, team
oriented gymnast. The team gave
Goldberg "glue" after the last two
meets, but this meet she earned
"nails."
Sophomore Jessica Louie also
competed well on Sunday after
being out with a back injury for
the past two meets. Louie com
peted a difficult full-in tumbling
pass on floor exercise for the first
time this season to record a ca
reer high of 9.9 on the event. Lev
eille and Foley each scored a 9.9
on floor fora team score of
49.375.
Foley led the Cardinal in the
all-around, placing third with a
39.55 behind UCLA's Kate
Richardson and Jeanette An
tolin, who are ranked first and
second in the nation in the all

around. Foley is currently
ranked tenth in the all-around.
Despite some strong individual
performances last Sunday, the
Cardinal will have to improve its
ability to compete on the road in
order to finish the season strong.
The team travels to No. 11 Okla
homa next weekend and will have
four other away meets before re

turning to UCLA for NCAA na
tionals on March 14.
"We're having a little bit of
trouble coming in to away meets
with the aggressive, confident at
titude we have at our home
meets, especially on beam," said
Goldberg. "That is something we
need to work on for the rest of
the season."

son. Sophomores Natalie Foley
and Glyn Sweets led the charge
over the vaulting table by each
registering a 9.925, a career high
for Foley.
"We're improving our vaults
each weekend," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "It is becoming a
real key event for us."
Although Stanford improved
on vault, scoring their highest
team mark of the season with a
49.325, the team did not perform
as well as usual on the uneven bars
or the balance beam.
Senior Caroline Fluhrer deliv
ered an aggressive routine on the
uneven bars to win the event with
a 9.95. The other gymnasts were
not as relaxed as usual on the
event, however, and their scores
suffered as a result.
"We came out a little tight on
bars," said Smyth.
The Cardinal had its lowest
scoring beam set of the season,
posting a 48.5, which is almost a
full point lower than the beam
score at last weekend's meet
against Washington. Sweets start
ed the event on shaky ground with
a fall on her double turn and
Fluhrer followed suit with a fall on
her tumbling series.
The team did not recover its
edge on the beam until ever-con
sistent seniors Lise Leveille and

Lindsay Wing closed the event
with a 9.825 and 9.85, respectively.
The order in which the gym
nasts compete their routines car
ries strategic importance in the
meet. The first gymnast up sets the
tone and momentum for the
team's effort and generally sets the
baseline for the team's scores.
Scores usually escalate as the line
up continues.
Senior Shelly Goldberg has
done an impressive job leading the
Cardinal with the first routine on
vault and floor over the past three
meets. This past weekend, she set
the tone with a 9.875 and a 9.825
respectively on vault and floor —
Stanford's highest scoring events
of the evening.
"I don't get any more nervous
going first than anywhere else in
the line-up," said Goldberg. "It is a
good position for me to go in at. I
try to set the tone and the start the
team's momentum by doing a
solid, strong routine."
"Shelly has grown so much in
her gymnastics and in her com
petitive attitude this year," said
Smyth. "She is calm and consis
tent so she does an amazing job
as a leader on vault and floor.
The rest of the team is following
her lead."
After every meet, the team
gives out two awards: "nails" to
the toughest competitor, and
"glue" to the most positive, team
oriented gymnast. The team gave
Goldberg "glue" after the last two
meets, but this meet she earned
"nails."
Sophomore Jessica Louie also
competed well on Sunday after
being out with a back injury for
the past two meets. Louie com
peted a difficult full-in tumbling
pass on floor exercise for the first
time this season to record a ca
reer high of 9.9 on the event. Lev
eille and Foley each scored a 9.9
on floor fora team score of
49.375.
Foley led the Cardinal in the
all-around, placing third with a
39.55 behind UCLA's Kate
Richardson and Jeanette An
tolin, who are ranked first and
second in the nation in the all

around. Foley is currently
ranked tenth in the all-around.
Despite some strong individual
performances last Sunday, the
Cardinal will have to improve its
ability to compete on the road in
order to finish the season strong.
The team travels to No. 11 Okla
homa next weekend and will have
four other away meets before re

turning to UCLA for NCAA na
tionals on March 14.
"We're having a little bit of
trouble coming in to away meets
with the aggressive, confident at
titude we have at our home
meets, especially on beam," said
Goldberg. "That is something we
need to work on for the rest of
the season."

Sophom<pre Glyn Sweets competes on beam. Sweets scored a 9.925 on the
vault against UCLA on Sunday, but it wasn't enough as the Cardinal lost to
the Bruins, who recorded the highest team score in the NCAA this season.
The No. 7 Cardinal (5-2,2-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) fell to the
reigning national champion. No. 2
UCLA, as the twin powers of Pac
-10 women's gymnastics took to
the vault, beam, bars and floor at
Pauley Pavilion on Sunday.
The matchup was much antici
pated because the two teams tied
at Stanford last year, but UCLA
was the clear victor this year. Stan
ford put up a decent away score of
196.425, which the Bruins topped
with an impressive 197.975 — the
highest team score in the NCAA
this season.
The Cardinal competed well on
vault. All six gymnasts performed
maximum difficulty level vault
routines for the first time this sea

for Foley.
