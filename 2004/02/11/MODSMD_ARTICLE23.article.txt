# Men's gymnast Gill 8th at Winter Cup
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
During his four years on the Stan
ford men's gymnastics team. Dan Gill
has set and achieved one goal after an
other: to earn a full scholarship, to be
named an Ail-American, to be
crowned an NCAA champion, to se
cure a place on the senior national
team and to compete internationally
for the United States.
One item remains on his list: to
compete in the Olympic Games.
"I've picked off my goals one by
one and the next level is as far as I can
take it." Gill said. "That is where I
want to go."
Alongside former Stanford team
mate Dave Durante. Class of 2(X)3,
Gill made his first steps toward Athens
this past weekend at The Winter Cup
Challenge, an elite competition that
determines which 14 gymnasts will
make up the senior national team and
earn the right to represent the United
States in international competition.
Competing against past
Olympians like Blaine Wilson and
Sean Townsend. Gill and Durante
successfully defended their positions
on the team, placing eighth and
fourth, respectively, in the all-around.
Their performances also pre-qualified
them to compete at U.S. Nationals on
June 2nd and 4th. The top 15 gymnasts
from Nationals will go on to U.S.
Olympic trials; of those 15, six will
compete in Athens.
"With each competition Dave and
I go to, 1 gain a little more confidence,"
Gill said. "1 have started to believe
that it [the Olympics] is a realistic goal.
And now that it seems more realistic,
all the hours of work seem more
worthwhile."
The Winter Cup Challenge compe
tition spanned two days — an all
around competition on Friday and an
event finals competition on Saturday
for those who scored in the top tier the
previous day. Freshman Alex
Schorsch competed on pommel horse,
vault and rings with Gill and Durante
on Friday but did not advance to any

event finals.
Gill captured second place in the
event finals on floor exercise with a 9.5
and sixth on vault with a 9.25.
Gill upgraded the difficulty of his
vault from a Yurchenko double full to
a Yurchenko double full and a half. In
semi-layman's terms, that means he
did a round-off onto the springboard, a
back handspring onto the horse, and a
layout llip off the horse with two-and
a-half, rather than just two, twists. The
2002 NCAA vault champion nailed
the vault in the all-around competition
but put his hand down on the landing
during event finals.
If Gill were to make it to the
Olympics, he would likely compete
only on his best events — vault, floor,
and high bar — rather than in the all
around. Although he is ranked second
in the NCAA in the all-around, the
rings are an Achilles heal that make his
all-around score relatively low at the
international level.
"Anything having to do with rings
is a pet peeve" for Gill, according to his
official website. His relatively large
body type and his past shoulder prob
lems make the event particularly diffi
cult and his improvement has been
comparatively slow. During the all
around competition on Friday, he
struggled on rings, scoring a 7.9.
His rough routine on rings put his
all-around score in jeopardy and
added pressure to deliver on vault. Gill
proved his grit in competition, howev
er, to post an impressive all-around
score of 54.05.
Despite his success. Gill is humble
about his achievements. He attributes
the development of his basic tech
nique and his competitive edge to the
help of his coaches, Sadao Hamada,
who retired from Stanford two years
ago, and Thorn Glielmi, the Cardinal's
current head coach. Moreover, Gill is
grateful for inspiration from former
teammate Durante, who still practices
at Stanford and is a volunteer assistant
coach this year.
"Without Dave, I wouldn't be on
the national team." Gill said. "He is
incredibly motivating with the best
work ethic I've seen first-hand. Dave
is a great friend to me outside the
gym, and a great inspiration inside
the gym."
Gill will lead the No. 10 Stanford
team (2-2) this Saturday night at the
Cardinal Open in Burnham Pavilion
for the second home meet of the sea
son. The meet is against an array of
NCAA teams and private clubs, in
cluding some gymnasts from No. 2 Cal
ifornia.
The Cardinal has lost its past two
meets, having been shorthanded due
to injuries and Gill's attendance at a na
tional team training camp. The compe
tition this Saturday will likely be the
first time the team has been complete
since it took No. 7 Michigan by surprise
to win the season s first meet.
