# Grad student survey addresses concerns
## Faculty and students combine forces to poll students' academic concerns 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Starting today, graduate students will have the opportunity to
voice their academic concerns through a new Web-based survey or
ganized by the Committee on Graduate Studies (C-GS) and the
Graduate Student Council (GSC).
The survey, the product of a year-long project, was an idea that
was first recommended by medical student Grace Chang. As last
year's GSC chair, Chang addressed the Faculty Senate with a pre
sentation on what she called the significant difficulties of a graduate
career and the few avenues available through which to solve them.
She then formed a subcommittee on the topic with four other grad
uate students, two faculty members and the Dean of Graduate Poli
cy Claudia Schweikert.
Over the past few weeks — with the support of the Faculty Sen
ate, the Office of the Provost and the Office of the Vice Provost for
Student Affairs — Chang and the other committee members used
feedback from focus groups and experts based on questionnaires to
revise a survey that she said is "as applicable and as clear as possible
to all students."
The survey will be available until Feb. 20, so that preliminary re

suits can be collected by the end of the month. Chang hopes to final
ize the data analysis by the beginning of April, in time fora spring
presentation to the Faculty Senate.
Current GSC Chair Steve Allison, a doctoral candidate in biolog
ical sciences, explained that his organization is running the survey
"because we know not all grad programs are created equal, and we
want all students to have a great experience here."
He added, "The survey data can be used to support policies that
improve the academic experience — advising, programs, resources
— for all grad students."
Allison also predicted that the data would contribute to future
lobbying efforts on behalf of graduate students.
Once the results are collected, the subcommittee can recommend
new policy actions — ranging from implementing advisor-student
dynamic sessions and a graduate-student advocate office to expand
ing Center for Teaching and Learning resources and career services.
"I believe that the mechanisms to 'close the gap' will become
clearer once we identify what and where the problems are," Chang
said.
In order to lure graduate students into completing the survey, the
C-GS and GSC are offering prizes, including $5 Jamba Juice gift cer
tificates to the first 300 respondents.
Other participants will be entered in a drawing for one of five
$100 gift certificates to Amazon.com or $10 gift certificates to vari
ous local shops and restaurants.
Chang emphasized, however, the survey's results will reward its
participants with far more than the opportunity to win prizes.
She said the survey offers students a "chance to speak out about
their academic experiences and challenges which they face [while]
improving their own lives as well as the lives of many in the future."
