# Stanford withdraws from Association of Research Libraries after 70 years
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
After 70 years of membership, Stan
ford has withdrawn from the Association
of Research Libraries (ARL), a nation
wide network and forum that the Univer
sity helped found for campus libraries to
exchange information. Although the
withdrawal — which went into effect Jan.
1 — will not directly impact students, it
will save the University $20,000 in annu
al fees.
The unanimous decision was initiated
by University Librarian Michael Keller
and approved by President John Hen
nessy. Provost John Etchemendy and the
directors of the five other coordinate li
braries on campus.
According to Library Assistant Direc
tor Andrew Herkovic, Stanford decided
to leave the organization because the ser
vices it offered were not worth the ex
pense of membership.
"As a professional organization, the
ARL provides a forum for large research
library directors to discuss issues of com
mon concern," he said, adding that the
ARL also disseminates library related

statistics and offers workshops and sym
posiums. "We've been feeling for some
time that it is more talk and less action."
In addition, library administrators dis
agreed with several of the ARL's opera
tions and yearly requirements.
"Data is collected to compare li
braries, which in our estimation is not al
ways a good thing," Herkovic said. "As
[the ARLj's membership has grown, a
sense of common purpose has been lost.
We feel it should be lobbying a lot more in
issues of intellectual property and fair
use rights."
Keller told the Stanford News Service
that he didn't think that the membership
benefits justified the cost. Citing the asso
ciation management's loss of focus,
Keller told the News Service, "ARL is not
serving the needs of this institution or of
the community of research institutions as
we understand them."
Both Keller and Herkovic said the
ARL's programs were not run as cost-ef
fectively as they would have liked.
"We certainly feel that in these times
of diminished budgets, we should pay at
tention to the benefit of what we spend
money on," Herkovic said. "We are doing

a cost-benefit analysis from a Stanford
perspective."
Herkovic added that he didn't believe
the withdrawal would put Stanford at a
disadvantage in interacting with library
directors at peer institutions.
"We maintain practical relations with
many universities," he said. "We feel like
groups who meet for the sake of meeting
are less interesting and effective than
small groups working fora common pur
pose."
Stanford libraries maintain several
other connections with campuses across
the country. Herkovic highlighted the
Digital Liberty Federation (DLF) as an
organization that provides a forum for li
brary directors to discuss the role li
braries will play in the digital age. Cur
rently, the DLF is compiling the Distrib
uted Online Digital Library, which will
allow digital repositories to share infor
mation.
Keller told the News Service that he
hopes the ARL will distribute the letter
of withdrawal to its other members. The
text of the letter did not say whether Stan
ford will consider rejoining the associa
tion even if changes are made.
