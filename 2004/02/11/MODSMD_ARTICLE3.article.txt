# Speakers dissect e-voting concerns
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"The votes of we, the people, are now the se
crets of corporations," said Faye Anderson, a
Stanford Law School graduate and the writer
and producer of "Counting on Democracy," a
nationally televised documentary about the 2000
Florida presidential election. Anderson was one
of five speakers who examined the problems of
electronic voting machines in a panel discussion
hosted last night by the Stanford Law School's
Center for Internet and Society.
After the events surrounding the 2000 presi
dential election recount, the federal government
set aside millions for states to upgrade their vot
ing equipment. Many of these states, including
California, are now turning to electronic voting.
According to the panelists, new e-voting ma
chines are not the solution to the problem.
"We are completely dependent upon the relia
bility of these machines," said Computer Science
Prof. David Dill. According to Dill, a voter using
the machine will have no idea what happened to
his or her vote. He compared the e-voting ma
chines to having a person standing in the booth to
record people's votes. In the end, voters could
never be sure whether they cast their votes for the
right candidate or even cast their votes at all.
Unfortunately, there is no way to check the
accuracy of e-voting machines. Due to the Digi

tal Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, compa
nies that manufacture the machines do not have
to share their code with the public.
The secrecy behind the source code was a con
cern for many of the panelists since one of the
main liabilities of e-voting is its susceptibility to
hacking.
"It's very easy to hide malicious code in a
large program," said Barbara Simon, a technolo
gy policy consultant. She stated that the hackers
might very well come from within the company
manufacturing the machines.
"The biggest breaches of security in the last
decades have been from insiders," she said. "You
can buy someone off."
Because the manufacturers have tight dead
lines for finishing the machines so that they are
ready for the next election, they don't have much
time to check the code for problems. Also, due to
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, outside
experts cannot inspect the code
For these reasons. Dill stressed the need for
accountability. The current e-voting machines,
which usually have a touch-screen interface,
record votes in a format that Dill said can be tam
pered with before they are counted. After the
votes are added to the ballot machine, there
would be no way of going back to check whether
each vote was cast correctly.
To solve this problem, he proposed that the
touch-screen voting machines be directly at

tached to a ballot machine. The voter could then
be given the choice of whether to accept or reject
the ballot, and then receive a receipt. This would
also open up the opportunity fora hand recount
should candidates desire one.
Two of the panelists — Electronic Frontier
Foundation attorney Cindy Cohn and Stanford
law student Nina Holly — are involved in a law
suit concerning the problems associated with e
voting. Recent e-mail leaks from Diebold Elec
tion Systems, an e-voting machine manufacturer,
suggest that the source codes used for the ma
chines possess vulnerabilities that are not cur
rently being fixed.
Cohn shared some of the leaked emails with
the audience. In one, a Diebold technician com
plained to a co-worker that he did not want to
run a systems test on the code. His colleague re
sponded by telling him to run a memory test on
the program instead, and then just re-label it,
telling him that it would "make them happy."
When these e-mail archives were posted on
the Internet by two Swarthmore students,
Diebold hit them with a cease-and-desist order,
claiming that they were violating the Digital Mil
lennium Copyright. The two students, along with
Internet provider OPG, took Diebold to court.
Though the company later withdrew its cease
and-desist order, Cohn and Holly are still in-
volved after filing a motion for the
judge to rule on the case.
Despite the questions about the
machines, one in four California
voters will be using a Diebold voting
machine in the upcoming presiden
tial primary.
