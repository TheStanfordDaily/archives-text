## Science allows parents to choose gender of children 
### JESSICA BLEDSOE THE DAILY UNIVERSE 
(U-WIRE) PROVO, Utah â€” When
Nathan and Kristina Phelps introduced their
new son to their 1-year-old daughter last
month, their family mirrored world statistics
that show almost equal numbers of births of
boys and girls.
"We are very excited to raise a boy and a
girl," Kristina Phelps said.
Not every family moves from pink to blue
or vice versa so easily. For parents piled
under a barrage of blow dryers or basketball
shoes, the concept of "family balancing" may
be welcomed.
Scientists can now determine a baby's sex
upon conception through a DNA coding
process called pre-implantation genetic diag
nosis. An in vitro fertilization technique, PRC
is predominately used to diagnose genetic and
gender related diseases like hemophilia.
A new fad among middle class parents,
however, is putting PGD back in the spotlight.
Families where natural, healthy children are
abundant but gender equilibrium is not are
now utilizing the technology to pick their
child's gender through coding embryos and
then implanting the desired sex.
Phelps said she does not agree with using
the technologies in this way because she does
not believe gender-unbalanced families are a
problem.
"I think it's unnecessary and a little unethi
cal," Phelps said. "I think when you have kids,
you have the different sexes fora reason."
Jerry Harris, director of LDS Family Ser
vices, deals daily with pregnancies and adop
tions. He does not think wanting one sex over
another is a problem.
"[Parents] have to make those gender deci
sions when they adopt," Harris said. "It's hard
to answer this dilemma precisely because it is
so individual for each couple. I don't think any
one should judge anyone because they desire a

boy or a girl."
Harris does find ethical problems with
aborting children because they are not the de
sired gender, which he thinks may happen if
the PGD process goes awry. Because the
process is uncommon and fairly costly (usually
at least $2,500), this is not a reported problem,
though heated debates have found their way
into federal legislation about similar issues.
U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, pushed
a bill banning partial birth abortions last
month and has raised the ethical implications
of scientific testing on unwanted embryos.
Until the legislature rules in, parents are left
to make their own decisions about technology.
Harris said he believes this is how it should be.
"The [LDS] church has given some cau
tions, but it is mainly up to the individual to
prayerfully consider and make a choice," he
said. "The church does not say you cannot or
should not or shall not. Technology is wonder
ful. and I think does open up options. On the
other hand, technology tends to go a little far
and raises a lot of ethical questions."
PGD is available in Utah, but is not wide
spread. National concern exists about the
scope of such technology to eventually deter
mine eye color or even intelligence.
Dr. Douglas Carrell, of the University of
Utah, studies PGD for protection against gen
der defects, but not for gender selection.
"We do not do any gender selection in any
form at the University of Utah. That absolute
ly is not anything we are researching or doing
clinically," Carrell said.
As PGD for gender selection gains promi
nence, safeguards may have to be put in
place. And while finding the process unethi
cal, Phelps does not find it necessary for strict
legislation.
"It is up to each person to use processes
like PGD. I don't think it should be out
lawed," Phelps said. "Everyone has agency
and should have the choice if they want to use
technology."
