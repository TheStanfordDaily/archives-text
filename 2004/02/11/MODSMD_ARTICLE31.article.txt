# Homosexual fraternity struggles for membership
## 
### EUN KIM ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH 
(U-WIRE) ST. LOUIS, Mo. — It's Rush
Week for Delta Lambda Phi, but no one
seems to be in a hurry to join.
The predominantly gay fraternity, which
started last fall at Southern Illinois Universi
ty Edwardsville, is struggling to boost its
membership to full chapter status by this
summer's national convention. It needs at
least a dozen members for that classifica
tion. So far, it has seven. And only three stu
dents have shown an interest in rushing.
Organizers stress that the fraternity is
open to heterosexual men, even though all
of its current pledges are gay.
"When I first heard about it, I was con
cerned about it being a gay frat," said Scott
D. Smith, while snacking on chips and soda
at a rush party last week at a Glen Carbon
apartment.
Smith, 19, said he had "plenty of gay
friends" but few in school. He had not con
sidered joining a fraternity but figured it
would be good to have another social outlet,
one with friends who were serious about
academics and philanthropy.
"It's nice that years from now, you'll still
have people you can rely on," said Smith, a
freshman at Southwestern Illinois College.
"These are people I'll always have a connec
tion with the rest of my life."
Delta Lambda Phi is the nation's first and
largest gay fraternity. The only other nation
al one is Alpha Lambda Tau. but it has less
than a handful of chapters.
Delta Lambda Phi, meanwhile, has 19
chapters and eight colonies. It was founded
in 1986 by three men in Washington who
wished there had been such a group when
they were in college. The SIUE fraternity —
technically a colony — is the only one in
Missouri or Illinois.
While the fraternity is based at SIUE,
membership is open to any college student
in the St. Louis area, including those attend
ing community college or vocational school.

said Christopher Miofsky, 20, the president.
So why has it been so hard to find recruits?
It most likely has to do with the stereo
types surrounding the idea of a gay fraterni
ty, Miofsky said.
"There are people out there who think
we sit around, drink beer and have sex with
each other," he said.
Instead, Delta Lamba Phi is like any
other Greek organization focused on phil
anthropy, academics and kinship, he said.
Mike DeMoss, the fraternity's vice presi
dent, said the fraternity took great effort to
protect the privacy of individuals who have
not told friends or relatives that they are gay.
He said three current members had not
come out to their parents, for example.
"Our brotherhood provides a niche for
men who may want a Greek experience in
college but who may be reluctant to rush
other fraternities for fear of hazing, discrim
ination or having to come out," he said.
"People feel like they have to come out, and
that's not necessarily the case. Joining this
type of fraternity, there isn't any risk."
John Davenport, Greek Life coordinator
for SIUE, said it took courage for individu
als to be associated with Delta Lambda Phi.
"I know it isn't exclusive to gay or bisex
ual men, it's open to what they call progres
sive men, but the reality is, I don't know how
many straight males are all that progressive
here at that age," he said.
Part of the fraternity's recruitment prob
lems may stem from SIUE being a com
muter campus, one with a relatively small
Greek community, Davenport said. Delta
Lambda Phi is one of the school's nine fra
ternities and seven sororities. Only one has a
chapter house on campus.
"We really want to see them do well.
They just need to be persistent and perse
vere about it,"he said. "We don't have a
large Greek population her? to begin with
— it's only about 4 percent of our under
graduate student body —so people don't
necessarily go rushing out looking. You
have to go looking for them."
