# Professors nominated by Critic Circle

### JACK LOVERIDGE 
Two members of Stanford's English Department were recently
nominated for some of the country's most esteemed literary honors,
one fora novel about a young writer's experiences, the other fora bi
ography of the often-overlooked daughter of a legendary author.
Tobias Wolff's novel "Old School" and Carol Loeb Shloss' biog
raphy "Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the Wake" were announced Jan. 19
as two of the five finalists in their genres for the National Book Crit
ics Circle (NBCC) Award. The two works have been nominated for
the top prizes in the competition's fiction and biography categories,
respectively. The NBCC's selections for the high honors will be an
nounced March 4 at the organization's 30th annual ceremony in New
York City.
Wolff's novel is also up for the Los Angeles Times Book Award
and the Bay Area Book Reviewers' Award, while Shloss' biography
was recently nominated fora Pulitzer Prize.
Shloss, who has taught at Stanford for four years and is currently
teaching classes on film and modernist authors, said she was surprised
when she learned of her nomination from her publisher.
"Awards don't enter into your mind at all as you're writing; that's
something that comes much later," she said. "Because writing is a vo
cation, because it is so internally motivated, it continues regardless of
the world's acclaim. There is, however, a kind of delight in knowing
that my work is among the five best biographies of last year. That's
pretty heady company, and I'm happy to have come this far â€” happy
for Lucia Joyce as well as for myself.
"There's also pleasure in being nominated with Tobias Wolff.
What are the odds that two writers from the Stanford English De
partment would share this distinction in the same year?"

"Old School," Wolffs first novel, tells the story of a young writer's
struggle for recognition at a New England preparatory school. The
book is a product of seven years of writing and was, to some degree,
drawn on the author's own experiences.
"The inspiration was partly derived from my memories of a school
not terribly unlike the school in the novel," he said. "It's a story about
finding a vocation, as well as the dangers of crossing the line separat
ing imitation and theft. As I say in the book, what leads someone to
become a writer is a mysterious thing. A writer's drive has to keep
changing over the years. Hopefully, age brings growth, but generally
motives change and you find yourself writing for different reasons
than when you were just starting out."
In the 12-year process of writing "Lucia Joyce: To Dance in the
Wake," Shloss traveled across Europe and had to put her rusty Ital
ian and German to use to uncover the illusive story of author James
Joyce's daughter. She said, however, that her efforts allowed her to
expose the lost life of a very talented career dancer eclipsed by the
fame of her father.
"I remember walking into the Bibliotheque del' Opera in Paris
and finding press notices of her performances and first sensing that
she was probably more talented than Joyce's other biographers had
given her credit for," Shloss said. "Because she was considered 'mad,'
most of the evidence about her life had been either lost or destroyed,
so I didn't originally know if her story could even be reconstructed.
But I gradually invented a way to bring her life out of the shadows of
her more famous father, and I could see that they had an extraordi
narily close and interesting relationship."
