## Eight is enough Synergy commune creates an unusual living space 
### CAROLINE CICCONE DESK EDITOR 
Since almost all undergraduates
live on campus, Stanford provides
almost every kind of living situation
imaginable. Singles, one-room dou
bles, two-room triples, suites and
apartments are just some of the
types of arrangements that a student
can enjoy. But recently, eight men
dreamt up a bizarre new living ar
rangement — a "manune."
Occupying three separate rooms
in Synergy, a co-op located on Do
lores Avenue, the "manune," as
called by its residents, accommo
dates eight men.
Communes, or communal living
spaces housing multiple people, have
always been common to some of
Stanford's co-ops, such as Synergy
and Columbae. Manunes, or com
munal living spaces for men, are a
new phenomenon. Residents of co
ops have always enjoyed more cre
ativity and selection when choosing
rooms. In Synergy, residents
change rooms each quarter so that
they learn to live in different envi
ronments.
Occupants of the manune in
clude seniors Vince Dorie, Orion
Courtin, Geoff Morris, Justin
Kuczynski and sophomores Harris
Fienberg, Ben Crosby, Derek Kil
ner and Tim Varga. These eight un
dergraduates share a bedroom, a

lounge and an office. The bedroom
sleeps six people. The lounge con
sists of numerous couches, a bar, a
television, a table and an outdoor
porch where one of the men sleeps
occasionally. Eight desks, eight
computers and hundreds of books
make up the office.
Though this living arrangement
seems strange to most, for the men
who comprise the manune, they
find it a great situation. Varga said
of the men with whom he lives,
"We're amazingly compatible."
The concept of the manune
started as a joke. Men in the house
had discussed creating a giant ma
nune that comprised the entire sec
ond floor. But the eight-man ma
nune ended up becoming the reali
ty. The men who live there say it's a
situation that functions for them.
Varga said, "Every day is beauty and
happiness in the manune."
The atmosphere of the manune is
similar to that of a fraternity, where
the residents enjoy beer, video
games and movies. Some find this
comparison interesting since the ma
nune is in a co-op, a type of house
considered antithetical to a frat.
Fienberg said the manune is better
than a frat: "It's all the best parts of
a fraternity without the frivolous
community service."
The manune has taken on a myth
ic quality, creating its own specific
culture. Its analyze its origins. "The

driving notion behind the formation
of the manune was the desire to cre
ate an open, caring environment in
which men could express their mas
culinity freely, without fear of perse
cution," Morris said.
Qualities of this manune include
a room Web site — www.buysell
dotcom.com — and a commercial
on that Web site. The men have cre
ated a CD entitled "Songs about
Men." The manune even has a slo
gan: "We make it happen," although
what this slogan means is unclear.
Other aspects of the manune cul
ture are more obscure. The men

boast of their Mary Kate and Ashley
Olsen calendar and of their obses
sion with ninjas. They play ninja
video games, computer games and
have their own real-life version of a
ninja game. In this game, they call a
friend's cell phone and then pounce
on their friend when he is distracted
by answering the phone. Instead of
killing two spiders in their office, the
men kept them on the wall, set up a
tripod and filmed the spiders' mat
ing. The men of the manune have
created their own version of fun.
In general, residents of Synergy
have had mixed reactions. Some
see the manune as a joke, but many
think that the joke is very funny.
"I think we provide a modicum
of social entertainment and amuse
ment," Courtin said.
Regardless of their reaction,
most residents of Synergy benefit
from the hospitality of the men of
the manune.
"We're definitely the social hub
of Synergy," Varga said.
The men have movie nights
every Thursday at 10 p.m. This
Thursday, they will screen "Spell
bound," a documentary about
spelling bees. The movie nights
pack the lounge. They also threw a
Superbowl party.
Despite the intense social aspect
of the manune, the men keep it
shockingly clean. The cleanliness is
not what one would expect from a
group of eight men. They feel that
the rooms must stay clean to serve
their functions.
The men hesitate to reveal all
that their manune has to offer.
"There are certain aspects of
the manune which must be shroud
ed in mystery," Morris said
Courtin claimed that the ma
nune can not be fully described in
words.
"I feel like they are all so funny
and anecdotal you just have to
come there and see it happen," he
said.

apartments are just some of the
types of arrangements that a student
can enjoy. But recently, eight men
dreamt up a bizarre new living ar
rangement — a "manune."
Occupying three separate rooms
in Synergy, a co-op located on Do
lores Avenue, the "manune," as
called by its residents, accommo
dates eight men.
Communes, or communal living
spaces housing multiple people, have
always been common to some of
Stanford's co-ops, such as Synergy
and Columbae. Manunes, or com
munal living spaces for men, are a
new phenomenon. Residents of co
ops have always enjoyed more cre
ativity and selection when choosing
rooms. In Synergy, residents
change rooms each quarter so that
they learn to live in different envi
ronments.
Occupants of the manune in
clude seniors Vince Dorie, Orion
Courtin, Geoff Morris, Justin
Kuczynski and sophomores Harris
Fienberg, Ben Crosby, Derek Kil
ner and Tim Varga. These eight un
dergraduates share a bedroom, a

lounge and an office. The bedroom
sleeps six people. The lounge con
sists of numerous couches, a bar, a
television, a table and an outdoor
porch where one of the men sleeps
occasionally. Eight desks, eight
computers and hundreds of books
make up the office.
Though this living arrangement
seems strange to most, for the men
who comprise the manune, they
find it a great situation. Varga said
of the men with whom he lives,
"We're amazingly compatible."
The concept of the manune
started as a joke. Men in the house
had discussed creating a giant ma
nune that comprised the entire sec
ond floor. But the eight-man ma
nune ended up becoming the reali
ty. The men who live there say it's a
situation that functions for them.
Varga said, "Every day is beauty and
happiness in the manune."
The atmosphere of the manune is
similar to that of a fraternity, where
the residents enjoy beer, video
games and movies. Some find this
comparison interesting since the ma
nune is in a co-op, a type of house
considered antithetical to a frat.
Fienberg said the manune is better
than a frat: "It's all the best parts of
a fraternity without the frivolous
community service."
The manune has taken on a myth
ic quality, creating its own specific
culture. Its analyze its origins. "The

driving notion behind the formation
of the manune was the desire to cre
ate an open, caring environment in
which men could express their mas
culinity freely, without fear of perse
cution," Morris said.
Qualities of this manune include
a room Web site — www.buysell
dotcom.com — and a commercial
on that Web site. The men have cre
ated a CD entitled "Songs about
Men." The manune even has a slo
gan: "We make it happen," although
what this slogan means is unclear.
Other aspects of the manune cul
ture are more obscure. The men

boast of their Mary Kate and Ashley
Olsen calendar and of their obses
sion with ninjas. They play ninja
video games, computer games and
have their own real-life version of a
ninja game. In this game, they call a
friend's cell phone and then pounce
on their friend when he is distracted
by answering the phone. Instead of
killing two spiders in their office, the
men kept them on the wall, set up a
tripod and filmed the spiders' mat
ing. The men of the manune have
created their own version of fun.
In general, residents of Synergy
have had mixed reactions. Some
see the manune as a joke, but many
think that the joke is very funny.
"I think we provide a modicum
of social entertainment and amuse
ment," Courtin said.
Regardless of their reaction,
most residents of Synergy benefit
from the hospitality of the men of
the manune.
"We're definitely the social hub
of Synergy," Varga said.
The men have movie nights
every Thursday at 10 p.m. This
Thursday, they will screen "Spell
bound," a documentary about
spelling bees. The movie nights
pack the lounge. They also threw a
Superbowl party.
Despite the intense social aspect
of the manune, the men keep it
shockingly clean. The cleanliness is
not what one would expect from a
group of eight men. They feel that
the rooms must stay clean to serve
their functions.
The men hesitate to reveal all
that their manune has to offer.
"There are certain aspects of
the manune which must be shroud
ed in mystery," Morris said
Courtin claimed that the ma
nune can not be fully described in
words.
"I feel like they are all so funny
and anecdotal you just have to
come there and see it happen," he
said.

Since almost all undergraduates
live on campus, Stanford provides
almost every kind of living situation
imaginable. Singles, one-room dou
bles, two-room triples, suites and
apartments are just some of the
types of arrangements that a student
