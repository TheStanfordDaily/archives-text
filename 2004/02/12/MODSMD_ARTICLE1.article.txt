Two distinguished Stanford professors are part of a group of sup
porters of embryonic stem cell research that is currently pushing fora
$3 billion bond proposition, which, if passed, would make California
the first state to fund the controversial research.
Nobel Laureate Paul Berg, professor emeritus of cancer research,
and Dr. Irving Weissman, director of the Institute for Cancer / Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine, are part of the coalition that hopes to put
the proposition on the November ballot in California.
Weissman, a leading researcher in stem cells, argues for the po
tential of stem cell research as both a "fundamental and a therapeu
tic science."
Weissman said that progress in stem cell research will not only help
cure major diseases, but also will lead to a greater understanding of
the disease process, such as pinpointing genes that predispose new
born children to chronic illness.
"Stem cells can give rise in a test tube to just about every cell in the
body," Weissman said.
The proposal would entail a bond issue of $300 million for the next
10 years and would require an amendment to the state constitution.
The money generated from the bonds would then be used to create
