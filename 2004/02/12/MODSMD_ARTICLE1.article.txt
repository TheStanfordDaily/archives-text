# Profs push for stem cell research
## 
### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two distinguished Stanford professors are part of a group of sup
porters of embryonic stem cell research that is currently pushing fora
$3 billion bond proposition, which, if passed, would make California
the first state to fund the controversial research.
Nobel Laureate Paul Berg, professor emeritus of cancer research,
and Dr. Irving Weissman, director of the Institute for Cancer / Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine, are part of the coalition that hopes to put
the proposition on the November ballot in California.
Weissman, a leading researcher in stem cells, argues for the po
tential of stem cell research as both a "fundamental and a therapeu
tic science."
Weissman said that progress in stem cell research will not only help
cure major diseases, but also will lead to a greater understanding of
the disease process, such as pinpointing genes that predispose new
born children to chronic illness.
"Stem cells can give rise in a test tube to just about every cell in the
body," Weissman said.
The proposal would entail a bond issue of $300 million for the next
10 years and would require an amendment to the state constitution.
The money generated from the bonds would then be used to create
research centers at major universi
ties, potentially including Stanford.
Berg explained that existing labs
could use the funding because the
federal government has not yet pro
hibited private funds in stem cell re
search.
"The whole argument is that Cal
ifornia can't afford for the federal
government to stymie life-saving re
search," Berg said.
For the proposal to reach the bal
lot, the coalition must collect
600,000 signatures of support by
mid-April. Berg said he anticipates
"a hefty debate" on the issue.
Berg cited two obstacles to the
proposal. First, ideological and the
ological arguments against stem cell
research raise ethical concerns.
Cost, too, is a factor. California's
strained budget would make it diffi
cult to immediately start paying in
terest on the bonds with full payback
after five years.
Berg responded to this concern by
referring to the economic growth po
tentially stimulated by the research.
He emphasized that in addition to
leading to the creation of approxi
mately 100 biotechnology companies
— employing anywhere from 200 to
400 people — advances in stem cell
research would lead to long term
pay-off in its impact on healthcare.
Another major consequence
could be a large migration of scien
tists to California and pressure

from the scientific communities in
other states to follow California's
example.
Berg said he was afraid that of the
federal government's response to
such a trend.
"If duplicated, what will the fed
eral government do?" Berg asked.
"It can throw up its hands and re
spect state rights, or, on the other
hand, it can say we need legislation
that preempts this technology. It can
bring down the heavy hand of the
government."
Among the major road blocks to
progress are bills pending in the U.S.
Senate that would prohibit stem cell
research and penalize researchers
with ten years in prison or a $1 mil
lion fine.
"A lot of us have been very active
in opposing that congressional ini
tiative and so far have had sufficient
help to block the bill in the house,"
Berg said.
The coalition, originally orga
nized by Los Angeles' Californians
for Stem Cell Research and Cures,
was partly motivated by the story of
Jordan Klein, a local 13-year-old
boy with juvenile diabetes.
Berg calls Klein's type 1 diabetes
a "nasty disease," which has killed
millions and which "will require the
use of stem cell research" in finding
a likely cure.
Jordan's father, Robert Klein, is
a Palo Alto-based attorney and has
donated $500,000 to support the ini
tiative for stem cell research.
Weissman said that stem cell re
search could potentially cure
major disabilities and diseases in
cluding juvenile diabetes, spinal
paralysis, Alzheimer's and Parkin
son's diseases.
