# Sex. love and rock n' roll
## Distance tugging at your heartstrings 
### VINNI INTERSIMONE HEALTH COLUMNIST 
It seems that everywhere you turn, there are signs that
Valentine's Day is on its way. Red roses, teddy bears and
Valentine's Day cards surround you everywhere you go.
Yet a quick glance at these cheery objects only garners a sad
frown from your face, because your sweetie is far, far away.
You, my friend, are suffering from the plight of the long-dis
tance relationship.
No matter the distance, relationships in the best of cir
cumstances are a challenge. From feelings of jealousy to
feelings of suffocation, emotions in a relationship are ram
pant and conflict is omnipresent. But when fighting breaks
out, there's always make-up sex and other tangible re
minders — a hug or a kiss — that you're the other's most
important person on earth.
But how do people manage to survive a relationship
when they can't even touch the other person in times of
happiness and despair? Even if they can survive it, why
would they choose such suffering?
I chatted with two students — "Kate" and "Pete, we 11
call them, as they both chose to remain anonymous — and
discussed their reasons for remaining in a long-distance re
lationship and their coping methods.

"We stayed together because we both wanted to be
cause we [knew] we were both in it for the long run," Kate
said. She is currently a freshman and has been in a long-dis
tance relationship since the summer.
If Helen of Troy started a war for it and King Edward
VIII abdicated the throne for it, love is indeed worth sac
rificing the comforts of a physical relationship. Being
apart is worth remaining together. The "why" might not
be so difficult to understand, but the "how" certainly is.
Trying to make love manageable from a remote location
is like trying to raise a kid from across the country: Love
requires constant care and attention. Are there rules for
making it work?
"There really aren't rules, things are more implied,"
Kate said. "I'm ultimately in control of my life, but when I
do things, I think about him first. If I go to a frat party, I'll
drink and dance, but I won't do something [with another
person] that will lead to something more intimate."
Pete's thoughts were similar: "It's very important to me
that [my girlfriend] has room to go out, dance and get
drunk, but there is an implied understanding that we won't
hook up with other people."
Relationship counselors at the University of Missouri-
Rolla list communication, a demonstrated commitment to
the relationship and trust as keys to an effective long-dis

tance relationship. But these are general guidelines for any
relationship — no real insightfulness here. The last piece of
advice, though, is especially applicable to couples in long
distance relationships: Independence for each partner
should be balanced with a healthy level of dependence.
Without this equilibrium, people in a long-dis
tance relationship can feel guilty simply because
they're feeling happy without the one they love.
Some couples have successfully applied this advice to
their relationships.
"I never feel guilty about feeling happy," Kate said. "My
whole life can't revolve around him. [But] there's a section
of my life where only [my boyfriend] can make me happy
... there is no other guy that could fill that void."
Another important consideration is that people can
grow significantly over time when living in different en
vironments. Recognizing and respecting these changes
is essential to making the relationship progress over the
weeks, months or years.
Yet no matter how hard you and your partner try,
there are bound to be times when you feel unhappy.
"Sometimes I feel really pissed off [when I] hear my
partner's becoming a new person without me," Pete
said. "My happiness is cancelled out and I see myself
adopt a nihilistic attitude, wondering why I'm going

out, when no matter how many frats I go to, she's not
going to show up."
When things get bad, experts agree that maintain
ing mutual respect and trust is essential, advice Pete
agreed with while adding his own.
"I always try to give [my girlfriend] the benefit of the
doubt." Pete said. "It's always important to trust and al
ways expect the best, [because] even if the worst comes,
at least you tried your hardest."
Talking with Kate and Pete made me realize that no
matter how well you deal with a long-distance relation
ship, pain is part of the game. When you're away from
the one you love, it's hard to fill that special place that
only the other person can satisfy. When you visit them,
the time seems to fly by and is never enough. Maintain;
ing trust and a balance between your life and your
shared life will allow you to get through it.
"Don't just close your door and not go out," Pete of
fered as his last piece of advice. "Live your life so you
have shit to talk about with your partner. Trust the other
person, and let the other person do his or her thing."
