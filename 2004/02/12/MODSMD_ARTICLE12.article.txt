# Groups should look beyond fees
## 
### 
Given the recent debate about
ASSU special fees and the
slew of refund requests made
by students this year, it is in
creasingly evident that voluntary student
organizations (VSOs) should not be sole
ly or largely dependent on this system for
their funding. We take this position not
out of principle or preference, but sheer
practicality: With the special fees system
in jeopardy and given the uncertainty
about its future structure, VSOs should
actively seek other sources of funding to

ensure their future fi
nancial security.
Providing innova
tive services to stu
dents is one such
method. For instance,
the a capella group
the Mendicants —
which did not run for
special fees this year
— charges a $30-per
song fee for its
"Valentine's Day Ser
enades" and is able to

another source that
VSOs should continue to
utilize: Approximately
$300,000 in funds is
disbursed to groups."

put the money earned toward producing
new albums. None of us wants student
groups to start charging fees for their
events on a regular basis. However, for
specific speciality services, a fee structure
may be appropriate for those groups that
do not receive special fees in the future.
The Stanford Fund is another source
that VSOs should continue to utilize:
Approximately $300,000 in funds is
disbursed to groups through this pro
gram annually, and an individual group

can earn as much as $13,500. Thus,
while the process of writing letters may
appear tedious, applying to the Fund
can substantially reduce a group's de
pendence on special fees.

updated since October 2001 and simply
directs visitors to The Stanford Fund Web
site and to campus community centers

such as the Asian
American Activities
Center and El Centro
Chicano. Each Web
link is accompanied
by information such
as the amount of
funds available from
each organization.
But most of these cen
ters have "none" or
"not much" available
to help support VSOs
and are therefore rel-

atively unhelpful to financial officers.
In light of the potential for an upcom
ing special fees crisis, the ASSU should
update its Web site and take other ef
forts to proactively direct VSOs toward
alternative sources of funding. While in
the long term a concrete solution must
be provided, we believe that the ASSU
can take more immediate steps to pre
pare groups for any sort of potential
transition that may take place in terms
of their future funding sources.
