# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## It's not the Sixth Man Club's fault 
### 
A lot of things have been
said about the Sixth Man
Club lately. The Daily's
editors, in their infinite
wisdom, decided to hire a third
party moderator. They needed
someone objective, like Judge Judy
... only without the sass. So they
called upon me, one of your friendly
humor columnists, to clear up this
whole mess.
In regard to Saturday's basket
ball game against Arizona, I, too,
was astonished by the verbal tirades
thrown at the opposing team. And
yes, I believe that the guilty parties
should be disciplined, including
Tiger Woods. I was appalled by the
obscene gestures he made, the nu
merous times he cursed out the ref
and his attempt to give a half nelson
to Jim Plunkett. Although he is calm
and reserved on the golf course, let
me assure you that this legend of the
links swears like a sailor at basket
ball games. I suppose it was easy to
confuse the cruel and abusive
yelling of Tiger Woods with that of
our own mild-mannered Stanford
students. The truth is, his yelling
overshadowed hundreds of Stan
ford students, who were just trying
to watch a jolly good sporting event
before afternoon tea.
I find Woods' behavior as startling
as the author of Monday's letter to the
editor ("Sixth Man's unruliness

should be contained," Feb. 9). Heck
ling the opposing team (especially for
things as trivial as their criminal record

relating to candy
theft) has no place
in college sports.
Even if an oppos
ing player admitted
to kicking another
player during a
game or if he has
been disciplined
many times for
mouthing off, it's
not the student
spectators' job to

point it out. Nor is it humorous in the
very least.
It's not like you see other com
petitive college programs having
such rowdy student sections. No, the
students of Oregon's Pit Crew, Cal's
Rally Committee and Duke's
Cameron Crazies are upstanding cit
izens who not only shout PG-rated
chants, but also support the other
team by shouting things like "Thatta
boy!" or "You'll get 'em next time!"
I've heard that the Cameron Crazies
not only send the opposing teams
greeting cards, but also bake them
cookies before each home game.
Many people suggest that these
angelic student sections are, in fact,
beneath us. I would have to agree be
cause we at Stanford are in an intel
lectual ivory tower. We must pro

mote a college sports environment
more conducive to families / bake
sales / knitting circles. We shouldn't
have Yell leaders, an unorthodox
mascot or a student section that em
phasizes wit and satire. We should
have cheerleaders, a military style
marching band and a student section
that politely sits during the games and
shouts things like "U-S-C!"
Some have asked, "What right do
community members have to tell
the students how to behave?" If you
answered, "No right," you're mis
taken. friend. You see, students
should not be allowed to judge for
themselves what is appropriate.
That's not what college is all about.
College is about adhering to
every social norm available. Think
ing for yourself, making a decision
to support your team in a creative
way — these are inappropriate
ideas. We at Stanford must set an
example — and that example must
be a polite, quiet, golf clap.
I'm sure when the men's basket
ball team visits Cal next weekend,
those Weenie fans will demonstrate
the friendliness and brotherhood
that Stanford students should aspire
to achieve.

Chris Holt would like to point out
that this is a satire. Tiger Woods
can subpoena him anyway at
cholt@stanford. edu.
