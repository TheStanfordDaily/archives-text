# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

### 
The only killing SAE does
is on the IM fields
Reading Tuesday's editorial con
gratulating SAE on the parties we
threw last weekend ("SAE double
header a success," Feb. 10) came as
a total shock to me and the members
of our fraternity. Not that we
thought our parties were not what
this campus needed, but it is seldom
the case that any fraternity is ever
given the credit and recognition it
deserves when providing this cam
pus with a much needed social out
let — at a high risk to its own well
being. The new editorial board is to
be congratulated for being the first
in my four years here to do so.
Further, I want to thank The
Daily's editorial board for acknowl
edging the efforts our house made
to elevate ourselves out of proba
tionary status. Sadly, the editorial,
which served as a step in the right
direction toward improving the re
lationship between the Greek com
munity and the greater Stanford
community, was met with a re
sponse that was unconstructive and
out of line. Enrique Cheng's letter
that criticized The Daily's editors
("SAE should not be 'favored' in
Daily editorial," Feb. 11) exceeded
the standards of propriety when he
compared praising SAE's return to
celebrating the release of John
Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd
Malvo. Of course the analogy is
ridiculous. Beyond that, it is offen
sive. Cheng seems to have over
looked the fact that members of our
house and others around campus
and the country have been deeply
affected by the sniper attacks that
took place. I am confident that
many in the community at Stanford
and beyond share this sentiment. In

the wake of 9/11 and the current
war in Iraq, such issues of national
security are not to be tossed about
lightly. I doubt that Cheng has the
first clue why SAE was on proba
tion or what that probation en
tailed, but let me assure him and
The Daily's readers that it does not
compare and should never be
likened to the assassination of inno
cent people. And while I would like
to write the letter off as pure igno
rance, I'd like to think a Stanford
student would know better. Cheng
has belittled the plight of the vic
tims and their families by compar
ing their killers to a fraternity over
coming organizational problems.
Cheng needs to get a grip.

Reminiscing about the
Tree's founding
I read with interest Dan Mc-
Carthy's diatribe about Stanford's
mascot, "the Tree" ("Pondering the
significance of a silly mascot," Feb. 11).
I was a Stanford student in the
mid-1970s when the big debate and
vote occurred about what to choose
to replace the Indian mascot. As I
recall, "Robber Barons" won the
vote (it got my vote). The only spe
cial interest that the "Robber
Baron" offended with his political
incorrectness was the memory of
our late founder, Leland. That was
too close to the truth, if you will, for
the administration to swallow.
As for the Tree, that was a cre
ation of the Stanford Band, not the
administration. The Band put on a
tongue-in-cheek halftime show that
fall which promoted the candidacy
of Tree (as in "el palo alto" found on

the University's seal) as the mascot.
They duded up someone as a tree
and paraded him around the field in
a golf cart — Rose-Parade-float
style. It was a great halftime show
that completely failed to ignite a
movement to appoint the Tree as
mascot. The Tree as a new addition
to the Band did catch on, however,
and has been with us ever since.
Thanks for the memories.

Stanford should subscribe to more
nonprofit-society journals
Your article on the "serials cri
sis" ("Fac Sen discusses journal
fees," Feb. 6) missed an important
point. There are two distinct tiers in
journal pricing. Journals published
by nonprofit scholarly societies are
typically much less expensive than
those from commercial publishers.
The difference can be as great as a
factor of 10 on a per-article basis
and is unrelated to the prestige of
the journal.
In my field, the most prestigious
journal — Physical Review Letters
— is also one of the least expensive.
It is published by the American
Physical Society and is priced at the
cost of production. The intrinsic
costs for Elsevier journals are not
much higher. The rest of the price is
profit. Since journals are a signifi
cant cost in the Stanford library
budget, it makes sense for faculty
and students to support journals
from nonprofit societies that do not
put stress on our resources.

vote (it got my vote). The only spe
cial interest that the "Robber
Baron" offended with his political
incorrectness was the memory of
our late founder, Leland. That was
too close to the truth, if you will, for
the administration to swallow.
As for the Tree, that was a cre
ation of the Stanford Band, not the
administration. The Band put on a
tongue-in-cheek halftime show that
fall which promoted the candidacy
of Tree (as in "el palo alto" found on

the University's seal) as the mascot.
They duded up someone as a tree
and paraded him around the field in
a golf cart — Rose-Parade-float
style. It was a great halftime show
that completely failed to ignite a
movement to appoint the Tree as
mascot. The Tree as a new addition
to the Band did catch on, however,
and has been with us ever since.
Thanks for the memories.

Stanford should subscribe to more
nonprofit-society journals
Your article on the "serials cri
sis" ("Fac Sen discusses journal
fees," Feb. 6) missed an important
point. There are two distinct tiers in
journal pricing. Journals published
by nonprofit scholarly societies are
typically much less expensive than
those from commercial publishers.
The difference can be as great as a
factor of 10 on a per-article basis
and is unrelated to the prestige of
the journal.
In my field, the most prestigious
journal — Physical Review Letters
— is also one of the least expensive.
It is published by the American
Physical Society and is priced at the
cost of production. The intrinsic
costs for Elsevier journals are not
much higher. The rest of the price is
profit. Since journals are a signifi
cant cost in the Stanford library
budget, it makes sense for faculty
and students to support journals
from nonprofit societies that do not
put stress on our resources.

The only killing SAE does
is on the IM fields
Reading Tuesday's editorial con
gratulating SAE on the parties we
threw last weekend ("SAE double
header a success," Feb. 10) came as
a total shock to me and the members
of our fraternity. Not that we
thought our parties were not what
this campus needed, but it is seldom
the case that any fraternity is ever
given the credit and recognition it
deserves when providing this cam
pus with a much needed social out
let — at a high risk to its own well
being. The new editorial board is to
be congratulated for being the first
in my four years here to do so.
Further, I want to thank The
Daily's editorial board for acknowl
edging the efforts our house made
to elevate ourselves out of proba
tionary status. Sadly, the editorial,
which served as a step in the right
direction toward improving the re
lationship between the Greek com
munity and the greater Stanford
community, was met with a re
sponse that was unconstructive and
out of line. Enrique Cheng's letter
that criticized The Daily's editors
("SAE should not be 'favored' in
Daily editorial," Feb. 11) exceeded
the standards of propriety when he
compared praising SAE's return to
celebrating the release of John
Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd
Malvo. Of course the analogy is
ridiculous. Beyond that, it is offen
sive. Cheng seems to have over
looked the fact that members of our
house and others around campus
and the country have been deeply
affected by the sniper attacks that
took place. I am confident that
many in the community at Stanford
and beyond share this sentiment. In

the wake of 9/11 and the current
war in Iraq, such issues of national
security are not to be tossed about
lightly. I doubt that Cheng has the
first clue why SAE was on proba
tion or what that probation en
tailed, but let me assure him and
The Daily's readers that it does not
compare and should never be
likened to the assassination of inno
cent people. And while I would like
to write the letter off as pure igno
rance, I'd like to think a Stanford
student would know better. Cheng
has belittled the plight of the vic
tims and their families by compar
ing their killers to a fraternity over
coming organizational problems.
Cheng needs to get a grip.

Reminiscing about the
Tree's founding
I read with interest Dan Mc-
Carthy's diatribe about Stanford's
mascot, "the Tree" ("Pondering the
significance of a silly mascot," Feb. 11).
I was a Stanford student in the
mid-1970s when the big debate and
vote occurred about what to choose
to replace the Indian mascot. As I
recall, "Robber Barons" won the
vote (it got my vote). The only spe
cial interest that the "Robber
Baron" offended with his political
incorrectness was the memory of
our late founder, Leland. That was
too close to the truth, if you will, for
the administration to swallow.
As for the Tree, that was a cre
ation of the Stanford Band, not the
administration. The Band put on a
tongue-in-cheek halftime show that
fall which promoted the candidacy
of Tree (as in "el palo alto" found on

the University's seal) as the mascot.
They duded up someone as a tree
and paraded him around the field in
a golf cart — Rose-Parade-float
style. It was a great halftime show
that completely failed to ignite a
movement to appoint the Tree as
mascot. The Tree as a new addition
to the Band did catch on, however,
and has been with us ever since.
