## ESPN bows to NFL by tossing "Playmakers" 
### 
This summer marked the first time I ever
heard a soap-in-the-mouth expletive drop
on primetime basic cable television. Even
more remarkable, though, was the station
airing this profanity: ESPN. The one station I could
actually legitimately argue against Mama Bechis as
worthwhile premium programming in my daily "but
Ma-even-Josh's-got-cable" struggles.
No, it wasn't Stuart Scott segueing into an Ohio
State football piece with a "Maurice Clarett's one
young playa boot-deep in some serious s#!% in
Buckeye Land," and no, it wasn't even out of the
high-flying, ready-to-blow-the-top-off-the-big-top,
ANDI Mixtape series.
It was on the premier episode of an ESPN pilot
called "Playmakers."
And after letting fly a whole slew of words new to
the sports broadcasting world, the faux-reality show
revolving around a hypothetical football team never
looked back. I sincerely struggled to keep track of all
the subplots intertwined in this estrogen-free soap
opera. There's a backfield composed of a wife beat-

er and a drug addict who masks his
habit by using a catheter and an
other player's urine to pass his
drug test.
The quarterback trawls for
more booty than the pirates of the
Caribbean. One wide receiver is
caught in a love triangle with a
team groupie and his secret
boyfriend. The defensive back
field is homophobic. The coach,
meanwhile, leads all these hooli-

gans while trying to keep his prostate cancer under
wraps. Episode three highlights include strippers,
lap dances, date rape and abortions.
This show is clearly not about the NFL. There's
never been a pro team full of such train wreckage.
You'd have to throw Mike Ditka, Bill Parcells, Ter
rell Owens, John Daly, Doc Gooden, Ben Affleck,
Carrot Top, Carl Everett, Rasheed Wallace, Tonya
Harding and Derek Jeter onto a NFL franchise cap
tained by Bill Romanowski to begin to resemble the
motley crew on "Playmakers." But as of last Thurs
day, based on pressure from NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue. ESPN canceled the pilot that aver
aged two million viewers per episode — rare territo
ry for any cable show.
Now, I can see the NFL commissioner plopped
down in a LA-Z-BOY recliner with his arm
wrapped around half a bowl of Jiffy Pop every Tues
day night to kick it live with the home theater, shud
dering at the thought of what this program might do
to frost his buns this week.
I can see him squeezing straight through a Mr.
Stress Head as "Playmakers' " up-and-coming run
ning back Demetrius Harris free-bases 40 minutes
before kickoff.
I can see Tagliabue flushing his United Way con
tract down the toilet after watching Harris steal anal
gesics from a terminally ill kid he visits at the chil
dren's hospital.
And 1 can see ESPN envisioning a heated Tagli
abue canceling the ESPN Sunday Night Football
contract and ABC Monday Night Football
contract — in which ESPN holds a stake — be
cause of all this.
So, despite the obvious disappointment in no
longer seeing how much tighter the players on this
team could tie themselves down to the railroad
tracks, I can understand the politics of this decision.
I'm not gonna go printing up "Who's the boss? Oh,
girl, you know it's Bret-eezy" T-shirts if I'm dating
Alyssa Milano. It's just not a solid decision for the re
lationship. ESPN really doesn't have a lot of say in
the matter. But the politics aren't the head-turning
issue here: It's the foundation on which the politics
have been built.
A fictional show, unbelievably over the top and
maybe more adequate for an animated series for this
exact reason, was cancelled for giving the NFL bad
digs. Clearly over the top. I repeat, clearly too far off
the deep end to represent any pro franchise. Yet it
got pulled nonetheless.
Tagliabue and ESPN Executive Vice President
Mark Shapiro must have been having too many "The
Osbournes" Pop Secret Kettle Corn parties in the
Commissioner's home theater, as somehow they de
cided the United States and NFL fans alike compose
some sort of new millennium mongoloid nation. The
message sent is clear: We're good to get a laugh out
of Jeff Brantley lecturing us on "Baseball Tonight"
from beneath a fresh perm mullet, we're good fora
$50 nosebleed seat at a Bengals vs. Texans preseason
matchup and we're good for an 10 of 50.
Is "The Practice" going to get cancelled because
that one new lawyer on the show manipulates and
breaks virtually every law possible and tries to mack
an intern in every scene? Is "Nip / Tuck" going to get
cancelled because the plastic surgeons on the show
involve themselves with drug dealers and perform
unnecessary liposuctions? Are the "West Wing"
and "24" going to get cancelled for their inaccura
cies? If these shows were actually precisely accurate,
and showed football players eating with their fami
lies, lawyers in 100-day litigations and plastic sur
geons really performing nose-job operations, would
anyone watch?
Of course not, because the entertainment lies in
the extravagance of the fairytale, as dark or un-po
litically correct as it may be. But the NFL commis
sioner, for some reason, believes we'll confuse ev
erything on cable with real life, and go hopping in al
ligator swamps with raw steaks down our shorts like
Johnny Knoxville. But the only one befuddled is
Tagliabue, who has obviously confused American
intelligence with an episode of "Newlyweds."

Bret Bechis is a junior who narrowly — very narrow
ly — escaped his editor's wrath for dissing Newly
weds. Fortunately for Bret, more pressing matters
had to be attended to, namely watching "The 0.C."

day, based on pressure from NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue. ESPN canceled the pilot that aver
aged two million viewers per episode — rare territo
ry for any cable show.
Now, I can see the NFL commissioner plopped
down in a LA-Z-BOY recliner with his arm
wrapped around half a bowl of Jiffy Pop every Tues
day night to kick it live with the home theater, shud
dering at the thought of what this program might do
to frost his buns this week.
I can see him squeezing straight through a Mr.
Stress Head as "Playmakers' " up-and-coming run
ning back Demetrius Harris free-bases 40 minutes
before kickoff.
I can see Tagliabue flushing his United Way con
tract down the toilet after watching Harris steal anal
gesics from a terminally ill kid he visits at the chil
dren's hospital.
And 1 can see ESPN envisioning a heated Tagli
abue canceling the ESPN Sunday Night Football
contract and ABC Monday Night Football
contract — in which ESPN holds a stake — be
cause of all this.
So, despite the obvious disappointment in no
longer seeing how much tighter the players on this
team could tie themselves down to the railroad
tracks, I can understand the politics of this decision.
I'm not gonna go printing up "Who's the boss? Oh,
girl, you know it's Bret-eezy" T-shirts if I'm dating
Alyssa Milano. It's just not a solid decision for the re
lationship. ESPN really doesn't have a lot of say in
the matter. But the politics aren't the head-turning
issue here: It's the foundation on which the politics
have been built.
A fictional show, unbelievably over the top and
maybe more adequate for an animated series for this
exact reason, was cancelled for giving the NFL bad
digs. Clearly over the top. I repeat, clearly too far off
the deep end to represent any pro franchise. Yet it
got pulled nonetheless.
Tagliabue and ESPN Executive Vice President
Mark Shapiro must have been having too many "The
Osbournes" Pop Secret Kettle Corn parties in the
Commissioner's home theater, as somehow they de
cided the United States and NFL fans alike compose
some sort of new millennium mongoloid nation. The
message sent is clear: We're good to get a laugh out
of Jeff Brantley lecturing us on "Baseball Tonight"
from beneath a fresh perm mullet, we're good fora
$50 nosebleed seat at a Bengals vs. Texans preseason
matchup and we're good for an 10 of 50.
Is "The Practice" going to get cancelled because
that one new lawyer on the show manipulates and
breaks virtually every law possible and tries to mack
an intern in every scene? Is "Nip / Tuck" going to get
cancelled because the plastic surgeons on the show
involve themselves with drug dealers and perform
unnecessary liposuctions? Are the "West Wing"
and "24" going to get cancelled for their inaccura
cies? If these shows were actually precisely accurate,
and showed football players eating with their fami
lies, lawyers in 100-day litigations and plastic sur
geons really performing nose-job operations, would
anyone watch?
Of course not, because the entertainment lies in
the extravagance of the fairytale, as dark or un-po
litically correct as it may be. But the NFL commis
sioner, for some reason, believes we'll confuse ev
erything on cable with real life, and go hopping in al
ligator swamps with raw steaks down our shorts like
Johnny Knoxville. But the only one befuddled is
Tagliabue, who has obviously confused American
intelligence with an episode of "Newlyweds."

Bret Bechis is a junior who narrowly — very narrow
ly — escaped his editor's wrath for dissing Newly
weds. Fortunately for Bret, more pressing matters
had to be attended to, namely watching "The 0.C."

This summer marked the first time I ever
heard a soap-in-the-mouth expletive drop
on primetime basic cable television. Even
more remarkable, though, was the station
airing this profanity: ESPN. The one station I could
actually legitimately argue against Mama Bechis as
worthwhile premium programming in my daily "but
Ma-even-Josh's-got-cable" struggles.
No, it wasn't Stuart Scott segueing into an Ohio
State football piece with a "Maurice Clarett's one
young playa boot-deep in some serious s#!% in
Buckeye Land," and no, it wasn't even out of the
high-flying, ready-to-blow-the-top-off-the-big-top,
ANDI Mixtape series.
It was on the premier episode of an ESPN pilot
called "Playmakers."
And after letting fly a whole slew of words new to
the sports broadcasting world, the faux-reality show
revolving around a hypothetical football team never
looked back. I sincerely struggled to keep track of all
the subplots intertwined in this estrogen-free soap
opera. There's a backfield composed of a wife beat-

er and a drug addict who masks his
habit by using a catheter and an
other player's urine to pass his
drug test.
The quarterback trawls for
more booty than the pirates of the
Caribbean. One wide receiver is
caught in a love triangle with a
team groupie and his secret
boyfriend. The defensive back
field is homophobic. The coach,
meanwhile, leads all these hooli-

gans while trying to keep his prostate cancer under
wraps. Episode three highlights include strippers,
lap dances, date rape and abortions.
This show is clearly not about the NFL. There's
never been a pro team full of such train wreckage.
You'd have to throw Mike Ditka, Bill Parcells, Ter
rell Owens, John Daly, Doc Gooden, Ben Affleck,
Carrot Top, Carl Everett, Rasheed Wallace, Tonya
Harding and Derek Jeter onto a NFL franchise cap
tained by Bill Romanowski to begin to resemble the
motley crew on "Playmakers." But as of last Thurs
