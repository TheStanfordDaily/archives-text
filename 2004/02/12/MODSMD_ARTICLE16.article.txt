# Volleyball faces a hard test to pass

### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Playing the No. 2 team in the country might make fora particularly chal
lenging match in any sport. Playing No. 2 two nights in a row might seem
even tougher. But for the No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball team, it's just an
other day.
The Cardinal (5-7,3-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will take on
No. 2 Hawaii (6-2,3-1) at 7 p.m. both Friday and Saturday nights in Maples
Pavilion as part of a pattern that Stanford has been forced to get used to.
"It seems like we've been playing number two a lot," junior setter Kevin
Hansen said.
He's right. Last Saturday, Stanford faced off against then-No. 2 Pepper
dine in Malibu, losing 3-0.
But it was the other recent road defeat that is more likely a cause for con
cern. Last Thursday. Stanford lost to unranked Southern California, 3-1.
The result marked the first conference victory for USC and since the two
away losses, Stanford has used practices to focus on its own improvement
rather than on the particulars of its opponent.
This is true for the Cardinal's approach to Hawaii, whose junior outside
hitter Delano Thomas leads the Rainbow Warriors with 129 kills.
"(Thomas] is their best player at the moment," said junior middle block
er Craig Buell. "But it really has nothing to do with them. We've just got to
play better."
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw agreed.
"I'm more concerned with us right now," he said. "We just need to exe
cute better."
Last year, Stanford traveled to Hawaii and played possibly its best volley
ball of the season. Although it lost its first match, the Cardinal came back from
a 2-0 deficit in the second match of the weekend to record the upset victory.
However, this year's squad will show Hawaii a far different lineup. Miss
ing will be All-American Curt Toppel, who led the Cardinal to the win,
recording 26 kills. Standouts Paul Bocage, Will Curtis and Billy Strickland
were also lost to graduation.
Attempting to fill the holes left by last year's graduating class are steady
juniors David Vogel and Craig Buell, who have lead the attack from the out
side and middle positions, respectively. The Cardinal has also been getting
solid play from up-and-coming outside hitters, sophomore Ben Reddy and
redshirt junior Patrick Bomhack.
Stanford's morale may have also taken a hit this week, as Joe Kay —
who had recently signed a letter of intent to join the Cardinal volleyball
squad next season — tragically suffered a stroke when fans rushed the
court after his thunderous game-ending dunk in a high school basketball
contest. Kay remains in serious condition with a torn carotid artery and
fractured jaw.
However, the Cardinal still has two weekend games to play, and for

this year's inexperienced Stanford team, executing
will be key against a team like Hawaii, which is com
ing off a win against Ball State, which had been the
only undefeated team in the country until its meeting
with the Rainbow Warriors.
In fact, Hawaii handed Ball State two losses in
back-to-back matches. The double-header pattern in
Hawaii's schedule allows for two matchups, cutting
down on travel expenses, and will mean a slightly dif
ferent weekend for the Cardinal. It was a change
Hansen said could go positively.
"After the first night you can make adjustments de
fensively," he said.
But Shaw explained that sometimes the lack of
turnaround time in back-to-back matches can be
detrimental.
"I think it's really tough to do, particularly with no
preparation time in between," he said. "It's not like
we're playing on a Thursday and then a Saturday."
But last Thursday and Saturday didn't go so well for
the Cardinal either.
Thursday's loss to USC and Saturday's to Pepper
dine has primed the Cardinal to break their now three
game losing streak. Again, Stanford is faced with a
highly-ranked, hard-hitting team. It's a regular chal
lenge that makes Shaw smile.
"It's our weekly match against the No. 2 team in the
country," he said.
