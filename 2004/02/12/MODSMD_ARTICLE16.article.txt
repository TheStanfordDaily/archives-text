# Volleyball faces a hard test to pass

Playing the No. 2 team in the country might make fora particularly chal
lenging match in any sport. Playing No. 2 two nights in a row might seem
even tougher. But for the No. 7 Stanford men's volleyball team, it's just an
other day.
The Cardinal (5-7,3-5 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will take on
No. 2 Hawaii (6-2,3-1) at 7 p.m. both Friday and Saturday nights in Maples
Pavilion as part of a pattern that Stanford has been forced to get used to.
"It seems like we've been playing number two a lot," junior setter Kevin
Hansen said.
He's right. Last Saturday, Stanford faced off against then-No. 2 Pepper
dine in Malibu, losing 3-0.
But it was the other recent road defeat that is more likely a cause for con
cern. Last Thursday. Stanford lost to unranked Southern California, 3-1.
The result marked the first conference victory for USC and since the two
away losses, Stanford has used practices to focus on its own improvement
rather than on the particulars of its opponent.
This is true for the Cardinal's approach to Hawaii, whose junior outside
hitter Delano Thomas leads the Rainbow Warriors with 129 kills.
"(Thomas] is their best player at the moment," said junior middle block
er Craig Buell. "But it really has nothing to do with them. We've just got to
play better."
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw agreed.
"I'm more concerned with us right now," he said. "We just need to exe
cute better."
Last year, Stanford traveled to Hawaii and played possibly its best volley
ball of the season. Although it lost its first match, the Cardinal came back from
a 2-0 deficit in the second match of the weekend to record the upset victory.
However, this year's squad will show Hawaii a far different lineup. Miss
ing will be All-American Curt Toppel, who led the Cardinal to the win,
recording 26 kills. Standouts Paul Bocage, Will Curtis and Billy Strickland
were also lost to graduation.
Attempting to fill the holes left by last year's graduating class are steady
juniors David Vogel and Craig Buell, who have lead the attack from the out
side and middle positions, respectively. The Cardinal has also been getting
solid play from up-and-coming outside hitters, sophomore Ben Reddy and
redshirt junior Patrick Bomhack.
Stanford's morale may have also taken a hit this week, as Joe Kay —
who had recently signed a letter of intent to join the Cardinal volleyball
squad next season — tragically suffered a stroke when fans rushed the
court after his thunderous game-ending dunk in a high school basketball
contest. Kay remains in serious condition with a torn carotid artery and
fractured jaw.
However, the Cardinal still has two weekend games to play, and for

Redshirt junior setter Kevin Hansen will attempt to lead the Cardinal to victory over No. 2 Hawaii as the
two teams face off twice this weekend.
