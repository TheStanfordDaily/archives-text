### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team has yet to
begin its season, but it's already accomplished some
thing it never has before â€” a preseason top 20 ranking.
The Cardinal, ranked No. 17 nationally by Lacrosse
Magazine in December, is the only West Coast team
ranked in the top 20.
Stanford will begin the 2004 season against UC-
Davis in a home match on Saturday at 1 p.m.
The Cardinal will look to get off to an extremely
strong start, as it has a very favorable schedule to open
the season, playing eight of its first nine games at home.
Fourth-year head coach Michele Uhlfelder has led
the Cardinal to a 38-16 record during her tenure, and
the Cardinal finished last season ranked No. 15 in the
coaches' poll.
Uhlfelder was recently inducted into the Greater
Baltimore Chapter of the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame.
She was one of just 11 inductees.
Last season, Uhlfelder lead Stanford to its second
straight Mountain Pacific Lacrosse League champi
onship, edging rival California, 15-14, in the champi
onship match, to finish with a season-ending record
of 14-4.
This year, Stanford returns 2003 offensive leader
Kelsey Twist, a junior midfielder who totaled 43
goals last year. She lead the team in that category, as
well as shots, assists, points, free-positions and draw
controls.
Returning in goal will be senior Christina Saikus,
who allowed an average of 8.80 goals per game, the sec
ond-best mark in program history. Her .529 save per
centage also ranks as the second-best all-time.
Standout senior Abbi Hills returns to the midfield,
where she has started every one of the Cardinal's games
over the past three seasons. She finished third in assists and
points last season and is fourth all-time in goals scored.
Sophomore Megan Burker returns on attack, after
ranking second on the team in goals, assists and points
in her freshman campaign.
Other returning starters include: juniors Julia and
Claire Calzonetti, who return at midfield and attack,
respectively; senior defender Katie Grube; junior
midfielder Nina Pantano; and junior defender
Anthea Tjuanakis.
The team has been far from inactive since the end of
last season, though. The Cardinal took a trip to Japan
Dec. 13-24 of last year to promote the spread of the
sport.
