# Golf finishes 11th at Northrop
## UCLA women head and shoulders above remainder of field 
### ZACH JONES CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
No. 2 UCLA just wanted to make sure
that top-ranked Duke didn't get all the
headlines.
In a year in which the Duke women's
golf team has outclassed every other
team in the country, the Bruins contin
ued to build a solid resume, cruising to a
32-stroke victory at the Northrop Grum-
Tian Regional Challenge on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford finished in 11th
place overall.
The team was led by freshman Lauren
Todd, who placed 18th individually.
Northrop is Stanford's first tourna
ment since the end of the fall season in
November, and it certainly did not afford
theCardinal the luxury of easing into its
spring schedule.
The 15-team field was almost certain
ly tke most talented that Stanford will
face this year — 12 squads ranked in the
nation's top 25 (Golfweek / Sagarin Col
legia.e Rankings) and seven of those in
the top 10.
Although the tournament was hosted
by Nc. 11 Ohio State, the event actually
took place at the par-71,5,912-yard Palos
Verdes Golf Club in Palos Verdes, Calif.
"[The course] is very demanding,"
coach Caroline O'Connor said. "There
are some holes where location off the
tee is critical, within a couple of yards.
Some greens are extremely small, and
precision iron play is critical. Putting
can also be tricky."
UCLA, was the favorite going into the
competiiion and the Bruins wasted no

time in jumping ahead of the talented
field. Senior Charlotte Mayorkas led the
team out of the gates with the lowest
round of the tournament, a five-under
par 66.
A total of 286 for the opening round
catapulted UCLA out in front by 13
shots, a lead that would only grow as the
tournament wore on. The Bruins showed
why they are the second-ranked team in
the country with consistent play from all
five members of their lineup. Gina
Umeck, the team's lowest finisher, still
managed to check in at 38th place over
all.
Stanford also started well in the
opening round, firing a 306, and found
itself sitting in seventh place, ahead of
No. 7 Georgia and just three shots back
of No. 3 Arizona. A combination of
youth and experience led the Cardinal
to its best round of the week, as both
Todd and senior Angie Rho shot a 1-
over-par 72.
"We definitely have the talent and the
drive on this team to [be successful],"
Todd said. "This team blends and mesh
es so well together, we just feed off of
each other."
Todd and Rho were followed by se
nior Kim Kouwabunpat, who posted an
eight-over-par round of 79 on Monday. It
was a disappointing start for Kouwabun
pat, who has had great success at this
event in the past.
Rounding out the first-day scoring for
the Cardinal were freshman Jenni
Tangtiphaiboontana and sophomore
Stephanie Lue. Tangtiphaiboontana
recorded a 12-over-par 83, while Lue
was two shots back of her teammate, at
85.
During Tuesday's second round, as
UCLA was building an insurmountable
lead, Stanford shot 310, dropping the
Cardinal to ninth place overall.
At the start of the final round on

Wednesday, two things were clear.
First, the tournament coordinator
could put both the team and individual
trophies into the UCLA team van — the
Bruins held a 25-shot advantage to start
the day — and Mayorkas had a seven
stroke cushion of her own.
Second, the race for second place in
both competitions would be furious, as
talented teams and individuals were
tightly packed atop the leader board. De
spite an unspectacular second round,
Stanford stood just 12 shots out of second
place and three strokes out of the top
five.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal appeared
to run out of gas on the final day, posting
a 315, its worst score of the tournament.
Todd, who had carried the team the
first two days, stumbled early in her
round and never recovered. After total
ing 9 birdies in her first two rounds, she
couldn't make up any strokes on the last
day, carding a 10-over-par 81.
Kouwabunpat, by contrast, played
her best round of the week, shooting a 73,
and moving up the leader board from
44th place to a tie for 29th. Rho moved in
the other direction with a nine-over-par
80. and joined her teammate in 29th
place overall.
Tangtiphaiboontana shot 81 on
Wednesday, sliding into a tie for 59th
place. Just two shots behind her, Lue
capped off a generally forgettable week
with a round of 83 and a 63rd-place fin
ish.
Mayorkas cruised to a 10-stroke victo
ry over teammate Susie Matthews with a
final-round 72. Her finish ahead of Ari
zona's Erica Blasberg and Pepperdine's
Carolina Llano should help her move up
from her current position as the No. 9
golfer in the country.

recorded a 12-over-par 83, while Lue
was two shots back of her teammate, at
85.
During Tuesday's second round, as
UCLA was building an insurmountable
lead, Stanford shot 310, dropping the
Cardinal to ninth place overall.
At the start of the final round on

Wednesday, two things were clear.
First, the tournament coordinator
could put both the team and individual
trophies into the UCLA team van — the
Bruins held a 25-shot advantage to start
the day — and Mayorkas had a seven
stroke cushion of her own.
Second, the race for second place in
both competitions would be furious, as
talented teams and individuals were
tightly packed atop the leader board. De
spite an unspectacular second round,
Stanford stood just 12 shots out of second
place and three strokes out of the top
five.
Unfortunately, the Cardinal appeared
to run out of gas on the final day, posting
a 315, its worst score of the tournament.
Todd, who had carried the team the
first two days, stumbled early in her
round and never recovered. After total
ing 9 birdies in her first two rounds, she
couldn't make up any strokes on the last
day, carding a 10-over-par 81.
Kouwabunpat, by contrast, played
her best round of the week, shooting a 73,
and moving up the leader board from
44th place to a tie for 29th. Rho moved in
the other direction with a nine-over-par
80. and joined her teammate in 29th
place overall.
Tangtiphaiboontana shot 81 on
Wednesday, sliding into a tie for 59th
place. Just two shots behind her, Lue
capped off a generally forgettable week
with a round of 83 and a 63rd-place fin
ish.
Mayorkas cruised to a 10-stroke victo
ry over teammate Susie Matthews with a
final-round 72. Her finish ahead of Ari
zona's Erica Blasberg and Pepperdine's
Carolina Llano should help her move up
from her current position as the No. 9
golfer in the country.

Stanford women's golf finished 11 th in a 15-teom field that boasted 12 of the nation's top 25 teams.
Kim Kouwabunpat finished in a tie for 29tfi place with teammate Angie Rho.
No. 2 UCLA just wanted to make sure
that top-ranked Duke didn't get all the
headlines.
In a year in which the Duke women's
golf team has outclassed every other
team in the country, the Bruins contin
ued to build a solid resume, cruising to a
32-stroke victory at the Northrop Grum-
Tian Regional Challenge on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford finished in 11th
place overall.
The team was led by freshman Lauren
Todd, who placed 18th individually.
Northrop is Stanford's first tourna
ment since the end of the fall season in
November, and it certainly did not afford
theCardinal the luxury of easing into its
spring schedule.
The 15-team field was almost certain
ly tke most talented that Stanford will
face this year — 12 squads ranked in the
nation's top 25 (Golfweek / Sagarin Col
legia.e Rankings) and seven of those in
the top 10.
Although the tournament was hosted
by Nc. 11 Ohio State, the event actually
took place at the par-71,5,912-yard Palos
Verdes Golf Club in Palos Verdes, Calif.
"[The course] is very demanding,"
coach Caroline O'Connor said. "There
are some holes where location off the
tee is critical, within a couple of yards.
Some greens are extremely small, and
precision iron play is critical. Putting
can also be tricky."
UCLA, was the favorite going into the
competiiion and the Bruins wasted no

time in jumping ahead of the talented
field. Senior Charlotte Mayorkas led the
team out of the gates with the lowest
round of the tournament, a five-under
par 66.
A total of 286 for the opening round
catapulted UCLA out in front by 13
shots, a lead that would only grow as the
tournament wore on. The Bruins showed
why they are the second-ranked team in
the country with consistent play from all
five members of their lineup. Gina
Umeck, the team's lowest finisher, still
managed to check in at 38th place over
all.
Stanford also started well in the
opening round, firing a 306, and found
itself sitting in seventh place, ahead of
No. 7 Georgia and just three shots back
of No. 3 Arizona. A combination of
youth and experience led the Cardinal
to its best round of the week, as both
Todd and senior Angie Rho shot a 1-
over-par 72.
"We definitely have the talent and the
drive on this team to [be successful],"
Todd said. "This team blends and mesh
es so well together, we just feed off of
each other."
Todd and Rho were followed by se
nior Kim Kouwabunpat, who posted an
eight-over-par round of 79 on Monday. It
was a disappointing start for Kouwabun
pat, who has had great success at this
event in the past.
Rounding out the first-day scoring for
the Cardinal were freshman Jenni
Tangtiphaiboontana and sophomore
Stephanie Lue. Tangtiphaiboontana
recorded a 12-over-par 83, while Lue
was two shots back of her teammate, at
85.
