Applications for the Volunteers in Asia (VIA) program are due
today. Every year, the program — which is independent of Stanford,
although the University has donated Haas Center space for its offices
— sends over 40 undergraduate and graduate students to Indonesia,
Vietnam and China, where they teach English.
According to Shannon Reynolds, the director of VlA's program
in China, undergraduates apply for six- to eight-week summer pro
grams while graduates have the opportunity to spend one to two
years in Asia.
For the summer programs in China and Vietnam, a group of un
dergraduates work together for six weeks to teach an intensive Eng
lish course at a middle school or university.
In Indonesia, participants take part in a service-learning program
where they work with a local non-government organization and learn
about the local language and culture.
According to Reynolds, qualities valued in applicants include an
interest in teaching and learning about another culture.
Once accepted, participants must undergo training in the spring.
Since almost all of VlA's staff are alumni from the program, they can
offer emotional support and advice to current volunteers.
"Because the Vietnam program is pretty small, volunteers are

usually very well networked before
and after going to their individual
posts," said Ann Le, director of
VlA's Vietnam program. "This
year the volunteers, through their
own initiative, have set up an e-mail
list, group Yahoo account and Web
page where they swap stories, pho
tos, tips and documents for teach
ing, general advice and other forms
of support."
Junior Albert Chan participat
ed in VIA last summer when he
taught English in Hue, a small city
in Vietnam.
"I wanted see the world, meet
people and identify with people
from cultures really different from
our own," Chan said. "As an Asian
American, I wanted to meet and
make connections with other Asians
around the world."
Reynolds noted that VIA is
unique not only because it is largely
a grassroots organization, but also
because it offers a very authentic ex
perience to its participants who live
in the smaller villages.
"My experience really reaf
firmed my belief that people all
around the world are just like us,"
Chan said. "I mean, we read Nation
al Geographic all the time and are

amazed by how different other peo
ple are."
Another component of VlA's
cross-cultural program brings stu
dents from Asia to Stanford to
study American language and cul
ture. These students take summer
classes at Stanford and go on cul
tural trips to destinations includ
ing soup kitchens and government
offices.
VIA has remained a private,
non-profit organization ever since it
was founded in 1963.
"This allows us to work in areas
we couldn't otherwise if we were af
filiated with the government,"
Reynolds said.
"We have a long-standing repu
tation in Asia," she added, noting
that the the program had volunteers
in Vietnam five years before rela
tions were normalized with the
United States.
To maintain its independence,
VIA does not accept donations
from religious or government
sources and is largely funded by the
host institutions in Asia and pri
vate contributions. Additionally,
participants pay 10 percent of the
trip expenses.
Volunteers said the trip is worth
the cost.
"VIA emphasizes the actual
cross-cultural exchange that occurs
during a volunteer's job," Chan said.
"I believe this is the most important
and most influential part of the ex
perience."
