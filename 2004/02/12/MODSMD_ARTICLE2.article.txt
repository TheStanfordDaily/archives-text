Applications for the Volunteers in Asia (VIA) program are due
today. Every year, the program — which is independent of Stanford,
although the University has donated Haas Center space for its offices
— sends over 40 undergraduate and graduate students to Indonesia,
Vietnam and China, where they teach English.
According to Shannon Reynolds, the director of VlA's program
in China, undergraduates apply for six- to eight-week summer pro
grams while graduates have the opportunity to spend one to two
years in Asia.
For the summer programs in China and Vietnam, a group of un
dergraduates work together for six weeks to teach an intensive Eng
lish course at a middle school or university.
In Indonesia, participants take part in a service-learning program
where they work with a local non-government organization and learn
about the local language and culture.
According to Reynolds, qualities valued in applicants include an
interest in teaching and learning about another culture.
Once accepted, participants must undergo training in the spring.
Since almost all of VlA's staff are alumni from the program, they can
offer emotional support and advice to current volunteers.
