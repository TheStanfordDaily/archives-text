The speech, attended by high school students, college students and grad
uates, criticized the nation s celebration of Black History Month, political
processes, and the black community's involvement with the Democratic
i <irty.
Ihe event ' ese " ted by B,ack Action Society, was held in celebration of
Black History Month.
Kweli commented that Black History Month is meant to "bring light to
the accomplishments of the black people in this country."
He also expressed his concern that the nation only recognizes the
African contribution to American history" as being "something that can be
contained within a month."
Black History Month, as much as I appreciate it, has become sort of an
noying to me, Kweli said. "1 think it should be a lot more important than just
a McDonald s commercial, or you [seeing] more black specials on HBO."
Kweli discussed the positive and negative aspects of the Civil Rights
Movement and their reflection on the evolution of political processes.
Kweli said that he found the Civil Rights Movement essential to blacks
within the realm of politics because it gave the black community the power
to vote.
"The good thing about [the Civil Rights Movement] is that it gave, not just
black people, but the collective consciousness of America, a better self-es
teem, sell-worth, self-value, Kweli said. "The problem is that some of the
things we were stiuggling for have become detrimental to us because they
have grown out of check."
Kweli drew attention to politicians who "leave the community and still
kick up and have a career [without being] accountable for the things that are
happening in the community." He also criticized the black community for al
lowing the political process to become a "popularity contest."
"Ever since the Democratic Party has had candidates who have aligned
themselves with the needs of African-Americans, we've given our votes on a
platter to the Democrats, and that's kind of crazy," Kweli said. "You've got
something that's beautiful, that's a tool, like a vote, but can become destruc
tive because you participate in a process that's blind."
Kweli also spoke out against the Democratic Party's lack of ambition con
cerning the last presidential election.
"It's a shame that somebody like George Bush, who's obviously stupid —
obviously — had to come into power before the Democrats could step up,"
Kweli said.
Kweli called the political process unfair and unbalanced.
"1 can't say any of the candidates, like John Kerry, or Howard Dean, or
any of these people who sound good and look good on television, I can't re
ally say I relate to [them]," Kweli said. "And anybody who relates to me will
never have a chance of winning, the way the system is set up."
Kweli asked students to recognize their resources and to find and em
power a candidate who relates to, and acts responsibly toward, the black
community.
Kweli also emphasized the importance of unification within the black
community.
"I think that our revolution needs to happen on every level," Kweli said.
"We need our revolutionary creatures, teachers, people who vote, people
who don't vote, drug dealers, cops, whatever. We need to be one type of
thought."
The master of ceremonies applauded the students for reaching out and
making an effort, while warning them of the dangers of losing their direction.
Kweli used the example of Rosa Parks, who drew attention in the 1955
when she wouldn't give up her seat to a white person on the bus, and her cur
rent conflicts with the hip-hop group Outkast.
"You have Rosa Parks, or whoever is advising Rosa Parks, trying to sue
Outkast over a song having her name as the title of the song — that sounds
crazy," Kweli said. "Outkast has successfully allowed the music to grow and
revolutionized what hip-hop music can and will be. They have the power.
They have power to us. To me, that's divide and conquer."
Though Kweli spoke of the power of hip-hop and the empowerment of
the black community through hip-hop, he said that he did not feel the artists
should always be held responsible for the beliefs they express in their work.
"I think [that] right now, there is no context for artists to be political,"
Kweli said. "Too often, artists are put into positions where they're treated
like leaders because they have the attention on them and all the hype sur
rounding them. Do 1 think that's not fair for artists? Yeah, it's not fair. But
it's not any less fair than any of you people having to play a role model to any
body in your life."
