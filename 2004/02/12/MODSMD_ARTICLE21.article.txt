# Students question politics of college profs.

### CLAIRE COMPTON THE COLLEGIATE TIMES 
(U-WIRE) BLACKSBURG, Va. - When
does a professor's political view become a polit
ical bias?
Students for Academic Freedom, a non-prof
it group, is rallying students nationwide to com
bat what they say is a liberal bias in faculty and
on campuses of institutions of higher education.
Recently, Republican Colorado legislators
introduced the Academic Bill of Rights into the
state legislature, a document created by the
SAF that outlines what they say are important
changes needed to create more politically neu
tral colleges and universities.
Edd Sewell, a Virginia Polytechnic Institute
and State University communication professor
and past president of the faculty senate, said he
knows professors who ascribe to both ends of
the political spectrum and professors who are
overly political in class come from both sides.
"I've heard of incidents going both ways," he
said.
Sewell said he valued hearing professors'
opinions when he was a student.
"One of the greatest things for me as an un
dergraduate was I had teachers who were con

servative and teachers who were liberal and I
learned from both," he said.
Sara Dogan, the national campus director for
SAF, said the organization doesn't demand a
greater conservative presence on campuses, but
wants to ensure no student or faculty member is
adversely affected by a political bias from either
side.
"[The Academic Bill of Rights] is an enu
meration of the rights we think students and fac
ulty should have," she said. "It's really basic
stuff, nothing controversial."
The Academic Bill of Rights wasn't created
solely for students — the document also calls for
politically unbiased hiring practices in relation
to faculty.
"No faculty member will be excluded from
tenure or search and hiring committees on the
basis of their political or religious beliefs."
Stipulations that would protect students
sound like a response to the age-old fear that
disagreeing with a professor equals academic
suicide in their class.
"Students will be graded solely on the basis
of their reasoned answers and appropriate
knowledge of the subjects and disciplines they
study, not on the basis of their political or reli
gious beliefs."

Sewell said he realized this was a common
but regrettable fear students often have.
"Students are often fearful, and this is unfor
tunate, that if they express their opinion and the
professor doesn't agree, there may be negative
consequences," he said.
Sewell said it was important for both profes
sors and students to express their ideas but learn
to back up defensive arguments with evidence.
Valerie Szybala, president of Tech's political
science club, said any perceived bias is probably
a result of the material professors teach, which
may lend itself to a liberal slant.
"I would have to say if there is any bias,
there's a liberal one," she said.
Dogan said SAF doesn't lobby state legisla
tures or take legal action on its own, but advo
cates politicians who support the cause of the
Academic Bill of Rights.
"We do support the efforts of Colorado state
legislators trying to introduce the Academic Bill
of Rights into legislation," she said.
Dogan also expressed enthusiasm for the
quick pace at which the organization has grown
since its foundation nearly a year ago.
"There are currently 123 campus chapters
and [SAF] is very rapidly growing," she said.
