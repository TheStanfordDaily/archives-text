# Rural youth more at risk to smoke

(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
Adolescents from rural areas are
four times more likely to smoke cig
arettes frequently or ride in a car
with an intoxicated driver than
youth from urban regions, accord
ing to a recently released report by
researchers at the University of Cal
ifornia.
The discovery, which was part of
a larger study conducted by the 4-H
Center for Youth Development at
UC Davis, concluded that rural
youth are more susceptible to tak
ing part in risky behavior than their
urban counterparts.
When looking at youth from ages
12 to 17, the study reported that 4.6
percent of rural teenagers said they
were frequent smokers — having

smoked on at least 20 of the past 30
days — as opposed to 1.2 percent of
teenagers from Californian cities.
"The higher rates of smoking
among rural youth are of great con
cern," said Katherine Heck, an as
sociate specialist for the center and
lead author of the report, in a UC
press release statement.
"In the future, many of these
young people will face health prob
lems because of smoking," she
added.
In addition to frequent smoking
and dangerous driving choices,
rural youth are also more likely to
consume alcohol at a young age.
Thirty-nine percent of rural ado
lescents in the same age level of 12
to 17 years reportedly have drank
alcohol, compared with 29 percent
of urban youth.
To second-year student Hilary

Lucas, who comes from the rural
town of Oakhurst, Calif., the results
of the study come as no surprise.
Lucas said almost all her friends
in high school consumed alcohol on
a nightly basis.
"Urban teens might do more
hardcore drugs, but people in rural
areas can get alcohol and don't have
much else to do," she said.
But while they are more likely to
engage in risky behavior, the report
also found that rural students are
less likely to drop out of school.
The drop-out rate for students in
rural areas is less than half the drop
out rate for students in urban areas.
Living in an urban or rural area
also has an effect on college admis
sions for youth. When reviewing
applications, the UC takes into
consideration life challenges, in
cluding the applicants' environ

ment.
The UCLA Undergraduate Ad
missions Web site lists that factors
in this review may include, but are
not limited to, disadvantaged neigh
borhoods or rural settings.
According to UCOP Admis
sions, University of California at
Los Angeles has the received the
lowest percentage of applications
from students of rural areas than
any of the other UC campuses.
Ramona Carlos, a research asso
ciate with the 4-H Center for Youth
Development, said the study was
important because it focused on a
lesser researched demographic —
that of the rural teenager.
"[This report] is a representation
of numbers that will hopefully lead
other groups to fund research that
looks into how this kind of behavior
can be changed," she said.
