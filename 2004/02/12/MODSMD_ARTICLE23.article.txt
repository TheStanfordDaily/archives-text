# President Bush releases budget proposal, increases spending on defense, security

### NELL McGARITY U-WIRE (DC BUREAU 
(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON —
Last week, President Bush released
his budget proposal, which increas
es spending in education, defense
and homeland security while many
programs receive cuts.
The over 1,000 page volume out
lines the president's proposal for
increased defense spending by 7
percent, increased homeland secu
rity spending by 10 percent, and
holds the rest of discretionary
spending to 0.5 percent. This pro
jected defense budget does not in
clude the projected costs of the
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The Departments of Agricul
ture, Commerce, Treasury, Trans
portation, Health and Human Ser

vices as well as Environmental Pro
tection Agency and Small Business
Administration will all receive
budget cuts under the President's
plan. In total, over 100 programs
will be cut, according to United
Press International.
The main goal of the budget is to
reduce the deficit over time while
making tax cuts permanent and re
inforcing the issues and depart
ments that have been at the center
of the President's term: education,
defense, and homeland security.
Republicans are hailing it as a
means to reduce the deficit through
responsible spending, while De
mocrats oppose the program cuts
and emphasis on defense and
homeland security.
"A budget is more than a collec
tion of numbers. It is an outline of

America's priorities and a blue
print for our future. The presi
dent's budget reflects our govern
ment's number one priority — to
protect and defend our homeland,"
said House Majority Whip Roy
Blunt, R-Mo.
"Faced with post-9-11 levels of
critical security spending, the war
against terror, and a faltering econ
omy, the deficit swelled. President
Bush has proposed an aggressive
plan to cut the federal deficit in half
in five years, calling for outright
cuts in seven of 16 Cabinet-level
agencies," Blunt said.
Democrats, however, are describ
ing the budget in different terms.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass, called the budget,"The
most anti-family, anti-worker, anti
health care, anti-education budget

in modern times, and it doesn't de
serve to pass."
House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi, D-Cal., said, "The President's
budget will create record deficits, but
it will not create jobs. It fulfills his
promises to big drug companies, but
breaks his promise to fund our chil
dren's education. It will protect cor
porate polluters, but will not protect
the environment."
Republicans pointed the finger
back at Democrats as well.
"The president's budget is a
good start to funding our priorities
and a good answer for the Democ
rats who are proposing increased
spending and an increased deficit,"
House Majority Leader Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, said. "They're
