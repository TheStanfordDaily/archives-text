# GSC seeks solutions to special-fee dilemma
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) met last night in Bechtel In
ternational Center and introduced
short- and long-term resolutions to
the current special-fees system,
which faces possible bankruptcy.
During the meeting, GSC mem
bers evaluated several drafted solu
tions to the special-fees crisis.
The short-term resolution en
tailed making use of unused funds
and those given to student groups
that have been deemed inactive by
ASSU standards.
"These short-term solutions are a
quick means to save the fee system
from collapse," said GSC Chair
Steven Allison, a doctoral candidate
in biological sciences. "They are
based on firm numbers and econom
ic calculations that assure the sys

tern's survival through winter and
spring quarters.
The proposed long-term resolu
tions to the special-fees crisis in
volved educating the student body
on the dangers of excessive refund
requests, providing more informa
tion about special group candidates
on election ballots and increasing
selectiveness of special groups with
a pre-proposal form. This form
would give the GSC a way to pre
vent groups that lack sufficient po
tential from being included on the
special-fees selection ballot, Allison
said.
"The goal was to find a long-term
solution to the current problem,"
said Deputy GSC Chair Gayle Chris
tensen, a doctoral candidate in edu
cation. "First, we had to deal with the
short-term crisis and then we needed
to consider carefully how to ensure
that the special-fees system is stable

for years to come."
Maria Gonzalez, a doctoral can
didate in sociology, expressed confi
dence with the drafted resolutions.
"Before, the issue couldn't be re
solved with exact figures and a di
rect plan," Gonzalez said. "But
everyone seems to have done their
background work on the issue and
so this meeting was mainly an
overview on the progress towards a
solution."
The newly created special-fees
committee will draft a more detailed,
long-term solution to the special
fees dilemma. The final versions of
these resolutions are projected to
reach completion within the next few
months, Allison said.
Since last spring, the GSC wit
nessed the rise of refund requests
from a typical rate of 8 percent to
more than 14 percent. Consequent
ly, the rate of increase threatens to

deplete ASSU funding for campus
groups that depend heavily on this
annual stipend.
"The main reason we think that
refunds have increased is due to the
increase in special fees," Allison
said. "People see the refunds as a
source of free money and don't real
ize the negative effects they have on
student groups."
While some early resolution pro
posals suggested amending the
ASSU's constitution by disallowing
refund requests, the GSC cautiously
avoided this option.
"We didn't want to change the
fact that you can get a refund," doc
toral candidate at the Graduate
School of Business and GSC mem
ber Travis Hopp said. "The whole
intent was to give students who feel
opposed to the goals of a special
group the option of not funding their
activities."
