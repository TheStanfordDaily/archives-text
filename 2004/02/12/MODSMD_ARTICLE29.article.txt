When asked what spurred his in

against what is now the deadliest
killer in Africa, and soon to be in
Asia."
Bradford recalled that during one
of his trips to Africa, he was attacked
by a group of young men who held

an AK-47 to his head.
"They screamed,
'Where are you from?'"
he said. "The kicked me
so hard that I spit blood.
They asked me what I
was doing there, and I
told them I was working
with AIDS orphans.
"One of them was
an AIDS orphan. There
was a silence, and he had
the group give my wallet
hack. That was another
time when I was remind

global consciousness."
