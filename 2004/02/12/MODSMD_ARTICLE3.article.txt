# Confronting Sexual Assault
## Week-long campaign to stop violence against women continues, but "rape free zone" tape draws controversy Activity week aims to raise campus awareness 
### BRENDAN SELBY JORDANA HUBER 
A plan to put up barricade tape bearing the
words "Rape Free Zone" around fraternities has
drawn criticism from members of the Greek com
munity, who said the plan plays on stereotypes
linking fraternities to sexual assault. The "Rape
Free Zones" is to be a part of V-Week, a cam
paign to eliminate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the connection
to fraternity stereotypes is intentional, its purpose
is to increase dialogue and awareness about sexu
al assault on campus.
"We approached frats in the beginning be
cause they have a reputation for being a place
where sexual assault occurs," explained sopho
more Yana Kesala, one of the event's organizers.
"It's a completely wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie, another event
organizer, acknowledged, "This statement is
going to stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-Greek houses
and locations that would also be included in the
campaign. "It wasn't our intention to single the
frats out."
The original e-mail detailing the event, which
was not intended for circulation outside the net
work of the V-Week organizers, listed only fra
ternities and White Flaza as locations where the
tape would be put up. This list was later expand
ed to include non-Greek locations as well. The or
ganizers plan to put the tape up tonight in front of
all Greek and non-Greek locations that have
given permission.
The reaction of many fraternity members was
negative.
Sigma Nu President John Cuaron met last
Saturday with the organizers of the campaign to
express concern that the tape "could be seen as an
attack" on fraternities.
"We let them know that we wouldn't sup
port this type of event, and we didn't see it as a
positive event," Cuaron said, though he added
that the organizers "definitely came in with
good intentions."
Sigma Nu members expressed their concerns
about the event during a meeting of the Interfra
ternity Council (IFC) on Tuesday, leading to a
discussion that led some frats to withdraw sup
port for the campaign.
Senior Anders Meverhoff, the IFC represen-

tative for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said that there was avid discussion about the per
ception that Rape Tape was primarily directed toward the Greek community.
Senior Nate Hennings, a member of Sigma Chi and the IFC President, em
phasized that the organization "vehemently supports the cause of V-Week."
However, Hennings questioned the need for the tape.
"The IFC's opinion is that each fraternity is inherently a rape-free zone, and
no tape needs to substantiate this," he said.

Activities Joey Greenwell also voiced opposition to placing the tape around

In hopes of raising awareness about sexual assault and
domestic violence, Stanford is participating in a week of
activities and events which will culminate in a benefit per
formance of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues."
V-Week is the expansion of V-I)ay, a global movement
dedicated to eradicating violence against women. More
than 600 colleges around the world are participating this
year. This is the sixth year of Stanford involvement.
"We want to provoke thought," said senior Danielle
Keenan-Millcr, coordinator of V-Week activities. "There
is a lot of denial, and that denial often forces survivors into
isolation."
To that end, V-Week includes events that aim to both
educate people about abuse and empower women to
speak out.
According to the V-I)ay Web site, the movement start
ed in 1998, an outgrowth of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina
Monologues." Since then, organizers have raised $20 mil
lion dollars to fight violence against women.
A spoken word night entitled "What's Your Vagina
Got to Say?" was held on Monday at the Co Ho; it includ
ed more than a do/en performers who sang songs and read
poems and stories about their thoughts and experiences.
Yesterday, the Women's Community Center spon
sored a panel discussion on rape and Stanford's sexual as
sault policies.
"It gets people talking," said junior Percy Link. "It is so
important to have a organized forum where these issues
are recognized and discussed."
In White Plaza, V-Week organizers have placed 20
life-sized plywood statues of women painted red. Each
tells the personal tales of women who have been raped or
abused. Students are encouraged to tie a purple ribbop
on the nearby fence for anyone they know who has been

fraternities.
Greenwell was unable to comment before
press time.
Although the IFC itself took no action, at
titudes towards the taping idea were "defi
nitely negative," according to Cuaron.
For the moment, the decision on whether
to allow the tape around fraternities will be
made on a fraternity-by-fraternity basis.
Some fraternity members felt that any dis
play of the word "rape" in front of fraterni
ties was unacceptable, but expressed a will
ingness to show support for the fight against
sexual assault in other ways.
The organizers of the placement of "Rape
Free Zone" tape defended the decision to
approach fraternities with the idea.
"Frats are the only all-male residences, and
85 percent of sexual assault is committed by
men," McKenzie said.
McKenzie defended the general idea be
hind the campaign, which she claimed had
been "grossly misunderstood."
"First of all, the intention in putting up the
tape is not to encourage a culture of fear,"
McKenzie said. "Quite the contrary, it is to
assert that our house — or any house partic
ipating— is and always has been a place
that does not condone violence against
women."
The organizers believe that the tape will
create a dialogue and bring sexual assault
out into the open.
"There are one or two sexual assaults re
ported on Stanford campus each year," Ke
sala said. "It's an extremely low rate com
pared to other campuses. But that doesn't
mean that stuff doesn't happen that no one
talks about."
Students attributed the lack of discussion
about sexual assault at Stanford to the low
rate of occurrence.
"I would say there is not enough dialogue
because it's not an issue we have to ad
dress," said freshman Michelle Mellard,
who also said that she felt secure going to
fraternity parties on campus. "It's safe, it's
dancing, it's a good time, it's nothing where
you would have to worry about safety."
Though V-Week is a national campaign
and the placement of tape reading "Rape

Free Zone" have been used at other col
leges, this is the first year that the tape is being put up at Stanford. Last year, the
idea fell through when the tape did not arrive in time to coordinate with V-Week.
Despite concerns within the Greek community, the organizers of the event
said they were heartened by the dialogue that the tape has already created.
"Rape is a crime against humanity and a crime against women and it happens
all the time and it's unaddressed," Kesala said.
McKenzie expressed optimism about the event.
"Putting up this tape isn't going to solve everything, but it will sure as hell get
people talking," she said.

"We hope that everyone in the
Stanford community will participate
in one of our events by just noticing it
and thinking about why it's there and
what it means," Keenan-Miller said.
The organizers of V-Week, also
known as the Vagina Warriors, raise
money through ticket sales, dona
tions and by selling buttons.

Last year, the group raised $6,000
at Stanford.
Ninety percent of this year's pro
ceeds will go to Rape Trauma Ser
vices of San Mateo, while the rest
will go to a national V-Day cam
paign for murdered women in
Juarez, Mexico.
"V-Week gives women the
power to come together and assert
their right to live a violence-free ex

A plan to put up barricade tape bearing the
words "Rape Free Zone" around fraternities has
drawn criticism from members of the Greek com
munity, who said the plan plays on stereotypes
linking fraternities to sexual assault. The "Rape
Free Zones" is to be a part of V-Week, a cam
paign to eliminate violence and sexual assault
against women.
Organizers insisted that while the connection
to fraternity stereotypes is intentional, its purpose
is to increase dialogue and awareness about sexu

"We approached frats in the beginning be
cause they have a reputation for being a place
where sexual assault occurs," explained sopho

"It's a completely wrong stereotype, but a stereo
type nonetheless."
Sophomore Allison McKenzie, another event
organizer, acknowledged, "This statement is
going to stir up some controversy."
She pointed to the other non-Greek houses
and locations that would also be included in the
campaign. "It wasn't our intention to single the
frats out."
The original e-mail detailing the event, which
was not intended for circulation outside the net
work of the V-Week organizers, listed only fra
ternities and White Flaza as locations where the
tape would be put up. This list was later expand
ed to include non-Greek locations as well. The or
ganizers plan to put the tape up tonight in front of
all Greek and non-Greek locations that have
given permission.
The reaction of many fraternity members was
negative.
Sigma Nu President John Cuaron met last
Saturday with the organizers of the campaign to
express concern that the tape "could be seen as an
attack" on fraternities.
"We let them know that we wouldn't sup
port this type of event, and we didn't see it as a
positive event," Cuaron said, though he added
that the organizers "definitely came in with
good intentions."
Sigma Nu members expressed their concerns
about the event during a meeting of the Interfra
ternity Council (IFC) on Tuesday, leading to a
discussion that led some frats to withdraw sup
port for the campaign.
Senior Anders Meverhoff, the IFC represen-

tative for Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said that there was avid discussion about the per
ception that Rape Tape was primarily directed toward the Greek community.
Senior Nate Hennings, a member of Sigma Chi and the IFC President, em
phasized that the organization "vehemently supports the cause of V-Week."
However, Hennings questioned the need for the tape.
"The IFC's opinion is that each fraternity is inherently a rape-free zone, and
no tape needs to substantiate this," he said.

In hopes of raising awareness about sexual assault and
domestic violence, Stanford is participating in a week of
activities and events which will culminate in a benefit per
formance of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina Monologues."
V-Week is the expansion of V-I)ay, a global movement
dedicated to eradicating violence against women. More
than 600 colleges around the world are participating this
year. This is the sixth year of Stanford involvement.
"We want to provoke thought," said senior Danielle
Keenan-Millcr, coordinator of V-Week activities. "There
is a lot of denial, and that denial often forces survivors into
isolation."
To that end, V-Week includes events that aim to both
educate people about abuse and empower women to
speak out.
According to the V-I)ay Web site, the movement start
ed in 1998, an outgrowth of Eve Ensler's "The Vagina
Monologues." Since then, organizers have raised $20 mil
lion dollars to fight violence against women.
A spoken word night entitled "What's Your Vagina
Got to Say?" was held on Monday at the Co Ho; it includ
ed more than a do/en performers who sang songs and read
poems and stories about their thoughts and experiences.
Yesterday, the Women's Community Center spon
sored a panel discussion on rape and Stanford's sexual as
sault policies.
"It gets people talking," said junior Percy Link. "It is so
important to have a organized forum where these issues
are recognized and discussed."
In White Plaza, V-Week organizers have placed 20
life-sized plywood statues of women painted red. Each

Greenwell was unable to comment before
press time.
Although the IFC itself took no action, at
titudes towards the taping idea were "defi
nitely negative," according to Cuaron.
For the moment, the decision on whether
to allow the tape around fraternities will be
made on a fraternity-by-fraternity basis.
Some fraternity members felt that any dis
play of the word "rape" in front of fraterni
ties was unacceptable, but expressed a will
ingness to show support for the fight against
sexual assault in other ways.
The organizers of the placement of "Rape
Free Zone" tape defended the decision to
approach fraternities with the idea.
"Frats are the only all-male residences, and
85 percent of sexual assault is committed by
men," McKenzie said.
McKenzie defended the general idea be
hind the campaign, which she claimed had
been "grossly misunderstood."
"First of all, the intention in putting up the
tape is not to encourage a culture of fear,"
McKenzie said. "Quite the contrary, it is to
assert that our house — or any house partic
ipating— is and always has been a place
that does not condone violence against
women."
The organizers believe that the tape will
create a dialogue and bring sexual assault
out into the open.
"There are one or two sexual assaults re
ported on Stanford campus each year," Ke
sala said. "It's an extremely low rate com
pared to other campuses. But that doesn't
mean that stuff doesn't happen that no one
talks about."
Students attributed the lack of discussion
about sexual assault at Stanford to the low
rate of occurrence.
"I would say there is not enough dialogue
because it's not an issue we have to ad
dress," said freshman Michelle Mellard,
who also said that she felt secure going to
fraternity parties on campus. "It's safe, it's
dancing, it's a good time, it's nothing where
you would have to worry about safety."
Though V-Week is a national campaign
and the placement of tape reading "Rape

Free Zone" have been used at other col
leges, this is the first year that the tape is being put up at Stanford. Last year, the
idea fell through when the tape did not arrive in time to coordinate with V-Week.
Despite concerns within the Greek community, the organizers of the event
said they were heartened by the dialogue that the tape has already created.
"Rape is a crime against humanity and a crime against women and it happens
all the time and it's unaddressed," Kesala said.
McKenzie expressed optimism about the event.
"Putting up this tape isn't going to solve everything, but it will sure as hell get
people talking," she said.

Ninety percent of this year's pro
ceeds will go to Rape Trauma Ser
vices of San Mateo, while the rest
will go to a national V-Day cam
paign for murdered women in
Juarez, Mexico.
"V-Week gives women the
power to come together and assert
their right to live a violence-free ex
istence," said Laura Harrison, direc
tor of the Stanford Women's Com
munity Center. "Stanford is not im
mune from issues of violence against
women."
