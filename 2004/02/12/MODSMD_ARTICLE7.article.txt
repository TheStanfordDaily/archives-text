## Valentine's Day is coming... Time to focus on your love life Students fail to use barrier protection during oral sex 
### LISA DIVER 
Imagine waking up one morning
to find blistering sores on your geni
tal area - sores typical of a herpes in
fection. Yet you might have not con
tracted this infection from inter
course, as many would immediately
guess, but from oral sex.
Herpes is just one of the many sex
ually transmitted infections, includ
ing hepatitis B, human papilloma
virus, (HPV), gonorrhea, syphilis,
chlamydia, chancroid and human im
munodeficiency virus (HIV) - that
can be contracted from oral sex of
any kind (oral-vaginal, oral-penile or
oral-anal).
Although young people know
about and want to avoid these infec
tions and use protection when they
engage in intercourse, many people
are unlikely to take the same precau
tions when engaging in oral sex.
While it is true that the risk of con
tracting a sexually transmitted infec
tion from oral sex is much lower than
via penetrative sex, cases are report
ed each year, and the number is like
ly to increase: The Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a not-for-profit corporation
for reproductive health research, policy
analysis and public education, reports

that more teenagers and college under
graduates are engaging in oral sex than
penetrative — often without adequate
protection.
According to the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC), the
three most common STIs at Stanford
are herpes, chlamydia and HPV, which
is commonly known as genital warts.
All three diseases can be passed via oral
sex and can manifest themselves in the
mouth and throat. Although many
people are aware that the oral herpes
(simplex 1) virus infects both the
mouth and genitals, they are unaware
of the fact that the same genital warts
have been found on the vocal cords fol
lowing oral sex. Chlamydia can cause
throat infections as well. Infected per
sons may not have any symptoms, thus
unknowingly spread the infections to
their partners. Barrier methods such as
condoms or dental dams significantly
decrease the risk of spreading infec
tion.
As with penetrative sex, prevention
is the key for safe oral sex — advice
that is not often heeded among stu
dents. Despite the fact that many young
people are aware that they should use a
condom or dental dam during oral sex,
they still are unlikely to do so.
"Everybody knows about [barrier

methods for oral sex], but I've never
heard of anyone who uses it," said one
student, a junior, who asked to remain
anonymous.
So, if most students know they are
putting themselves and their part
ners at risk for STIs by engaging in
unsafe oral sex, why are they still
doing it?
"People don't think there's a risk
of anything remotely serious," said
Kelly Parker, a senior.
Many students are unaware that
of the risks of contracting an STI
from oral sex, and some claim to find
barrier methods inconvenient, citing
excuses that they "don't feel as
good" or that these methods are "too
taboo."
"Condoms for sex are way more
accepted. Using a dental dam is like
an extra measure that would make it
seem extra dirty. They're too exotic,"
said senior Elaine Liu.
Additionally, not only are stu
dents generally unwilling to use den
tal dams, but they can also be expen
sive or hard to find. Students may be
unaware of what they look like or
how they work ,and thus, may be un
likely to try them. (For more infor
mation, see box.) Many students
questioned for this article did not
know what a dental dam was, and of
those surveyed, not a single student
had used one before or intended to
use one in the future.
Dental dams are available from the
SHPRC in Vaden Student Health Cen
ter and through various online retailers.
Also, a cut condom or latex glove may
be substituted. Non-microwavable
plastic wrap can also be used as a den
tal dam. The benefits of plastic wrap in
clude the ease of availability and the
ability of the wrap to retain heat, which
some find advantageous. Saran Wrap
brand has actually been approved by
the Federal Drug Administration as a
barrier to protect the transmission of
viruses. Condoms can be used as a bar
rier method for fellatio.
Considering the risks associated
with unsafe oral sex practices, stu
dents would do well to inconve
nience themselves by taking a trip to
the SHPRC and picking up safe oral
sex supplies. Using a dental dam or a
condom is certainly a better alterna
tive to contracting an STI on your
mouth, throat or genitals.
