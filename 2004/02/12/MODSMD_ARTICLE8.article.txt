# FAST FACT
## Using a dental dam 
### 
Dental dams are latex rectan
gles that are placed over the labia
or anus before performing oral
sex. Originally used as dental
surgery tools, dams act as barri
ers to prevent the mixing of bod
ily fluids between partners and
have been shown to be very ef
fective in preventing STIs.
To use a dental dam, first
rinse off the dam with warm
water and be sure it does not
have any holes or tears that
would allow fluids to go
through. Make sure you always
use the same side facing the

genitals and the other to the
mouth.
Never use the same dam twice,
and always change dams when
changing "location" — for exam
ple going from the labia to the anus
— because bacteria can be spread
between areas of the body. Apply
adequate lubrication on the side of
the dam to be used on the genitals
and hold the dam in place.
Remember to use water
based lubricants only, because
oil-based lubes break down latex
and decrease the efficacy of the
barrier.
