## Health benefits of chocolate 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Americans consume an average of 12 pounds of the sweet treat — from rich, dark chocolate to
milk chocolate M&Ms — each year. Although most people need few excuses to snack on a choco
late bar, researchers at the National Academy of Sciences may give some an extra incentive to in
dulge. Scientists discussed the possible health benefits of chocolate at an all-day conference this past
Tuesday, including the possible protective benefits to cardiovascular and immunological health.
Chocolate contains special plant chemicals known as flavonoids — a complex group of
molecules also found in plant-derived foods such as red wine, blueberries and tea — that may pro
tect you from free radicals, byproducts of normal metabolic processes that harm cells, and may pro
tect your heart or lower your risk of cancer. Researchers at UC-Davis School of Medicine have
found that flavonoids may help relax the inner surface of blood vessels by promoting the release of
nitric oxide, and thus possibly lower blood pressure and prevent the rupture of coronary plaques.
Additionally, other UC-Davis scientists have found that compounds in chocolate may act as anti
coagulants, guard against fatal blood clots and offer the same type of protection as a baby aspirin.
A 40-gram piece of milk chocolate contains about 400 milligrams of antioxidants; dark choco
late may have twice that amount. Although studies have shown that most chocolate products con
tain antioxidants, the presence of these beneficial chemical compounds depends on the variety,
processing and storage of the chocolate. While the current research is promising, many studies have
been funded by candy companies such as Mars and Dove and have included only small sample
sizes, limiting the strength of their results.
Norman K. Hollenberg of Harvard Medical School doesn't believe we should consume any
more [chocolate] than we currently do. In an interview with CNN, Hollenberg explained: "The
issue [today] isn't should we or should we not be recommending chocolate, only that people should
not feel guilty about eating it."

Researchers are finding that chocolate's benefits extend far beyond its sweet taste and
that it may protect against heart disease and cancer.
