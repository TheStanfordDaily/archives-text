Hey Eiman: I love you!
Peek-a-boo Joe: You too!
With your cute button nose
And your wiqqly giggly toes
Your biq arms around me
Like sailing in a love-sea
Silly Billy, who's the best?
You! Better than all the rest!
I THINK OF YOU ALL THE TIME
It's my favorite thing to do
And I'm here to tell you you're fine!
let's cuddle snuggle 'til two!
So ON this valentine's day
Can we please hold hands by the bay?
Love,
John
