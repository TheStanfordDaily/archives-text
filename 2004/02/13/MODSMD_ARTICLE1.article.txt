# Somebody's HEART is going to get broken
## Card heads to Cal 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It's difficult to imagine that tomorrow's game be
tween No. 2 Stanford and unranked California could be
any more emotional than last week's stunner against
then-No. 12 Arizona — for either Cal or Stanford.
While the Cardinal's (20-0, 11-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) last-second win over the Wildcats on Saturday
gained national media attention and has been named an
ESPN "Instant Classic," the Golden Bears had already
upset Arizona, 87-83, earlier that week in a game that
also went down to the wire.
The win catapulted the Bears (11-9, 7-4) into sole
possession of second place in the Pac-10.
But no, no, it couldn't be anymore emotional than
that, right?
Perhaps.
Then again, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, after all.
And, ironically, on this heralded day for lovers' pic
nics and long walks on the beach, the Cardinal will take
the short stroll over the San Mateo Bridge to visit one of
the Pac-10's most hostile venues in Haas Pavilion, to
face Cal in front of a blue-and-gold-clad crowd that re
ally, really, really doesn't like Stanford, like, at all.
Translation: Haas Pavilion ain't no joke.
The Bears have posted the best home-court record in
the Pac-10 the past three seasons and have won over 81
percent of their home games since Haas opened during
the fall of 1999.
"[Haas has] become one of the most difficult places
to play," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The people are so close and obviously they're [excited]
about Stanford ... As Arizona discovered, it's going to
be a tough game."
On Saturday, just to make the atmosphere even
more emotional, Cal will "coincidentally" retire the
jersey of NBA All-Star and former Cal point guard
Jason Kidd.
But Bears head coach Ben Braun said that his team
can't get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding the
game if it hopes to be successful this time around.
"We can't play any of the games around the game,"
Braun said. "[We have to] put sideline things to the
sideline."
Both teams have a lot to gain from a win tomorrow.

Stanford will play for "21," and a lone place in the
record books, as well as further cushioning to its confer
ence lead.
And Cal is trying to hold on and play catch up all at
the same time — the Bears are four games behind the
Cardinal, half a game ahead of Oregon and only one
game ahead of Arizona and UCLA in the Pac-10. (Ari
zona will face off against UCLA and USC this weekend
in Tucson, while Oregon will travel to face the Wash
ington schools.)
Despite being neighbors geographically and atop the
Pac-10 standings, Stanford and Cal couldn't be more
different from a personnel perspective. While the Car
dinal has earned a reputation for its on-court maturity,
the Bears, on the other hand, have been forced to over
come their youth.
Cal starts three freshmen, a sophomore and one se
nior. And four of its seven players coming off the bench
are underclassmen.
While Stanford got off to a quick start in conference
play, Cal found itself 1-2 after losing to Washington
State at Haas and getting blown out by 20 by Arizona
in Tucson.
"It's interesting to go back to the first Arizona
game," Braun said. "We were hurt. We were really dis
appointed back then ... We looked up at half time and
just shook our heads [because] we were down, and I
think it was maybe at that point that we kind of had a
wake up [call]."
"That game became a pretty important game for us,"
Braun continued. "We had so much respect for [Ari
zona] that we started forgetting a little bit about our
selves ... That game has been etched in our minds."
Since that loss to the Wildcats, Cal has gone 6-2 in
Pac-10 play, with losses to only Stanford and Oregon on
the road.
Tomorrow, though, the Bears will face an unbeaten
Stanford team that has looked almost beatable these
past two weeks — almost, although no team has been
able to prove it on the court.
Excluding, of course, the Cardinal's 30-point thrash
ing of Arizona State last Thursday, Stanford has barely
escaped two very close Pac-10 games.

Saturday's game against Cal could prove to be
another difficult test for the Cardinal frontcourt.
The Bears boast a talented (albeit young) lineup,
with freshman forwards Marquise Kately and Leon
Powe. The two are averaging a combined 26.6
points and almost 13 rebounds per game. Add into
the mix senior center Amit Tamir — a marksman
who likes to play out on the perimeter — and Cal's
got a tall and dangerous inside-outside combina
tion. Tamir has shot 13-for-22 from 3-point range in
his past three games.
Sophomore forward Matt Haryasz is expected
to return to action, according to Montgomery, after
being sidelined the last two games with a sprained
ankle. His presence could add some much-needed
depth to Stanford's frontcourt, which in man-to
man situations will be forced to chase Tamir around
on the perimeter while keeping Powe in check on
the low post.
"[Tamir's] a great shooter from the perimeter,
and I think anytime you're willing to spend time
and defend a perimeter shooter away from the bas
ket you can probably do that," Montgomery said.
"The problem, of course, is that it opens things up
on the interior."
"You kind of have to pick your poison with good
teams, and Cal's really starting to play well," he
continued. "They understand where guys can be
successful... You have to be willing to give up
something."

ally, really, really doesn't like Stanford, like, at all.
Translation: Haas Pavilion ain't no joke.
The Bears have posted the best home-court record in
the Pac-10 the past three seasons and have won over 81
percent of their home games since Haas opened during
the fall of 1999.
"[Haas has] become one of the most difficult places
to play," Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery said.
"The people are so close and obviously they're [excited]
about Stanford ... As Arizona discovered, it's going to
be a tough game."
On Saturday, just to make the atmosphere even
more emotional, Cal will "coincidentally" retire the
jersey of NBA All-Star and former Cal point guard
Jason Kidd.
But Bears head coach Ben Braun said that his team
can't get caught up in all the hoopla surrounding the
game if it hopes to be successful this time around.
"We can't play any of the games around the game,"
Braun said. "[We have to] put sideline things to the
sideline."
Both teams have a lot to gain from a win tomorrow.

Stanford will play for "21," and a lone place in the
record books, as well as further cushioning to its confer
ence lead.
And Cal is trying to hold on and play catch up all at
the same time — the Bears are four games behind the
Cardinal, half a game ahead of Oregon and only one
game ahead of Arizona and UCLA in the Pac-10. (Ari
zona will face off against UCLA and USC this weekend
in Tucson, while Oregon will travel to face the Wash
ington schools.)
Despite being neighbors geographically and atop the
Pac-10 standings, Stanford and Cal couldn't be more
different from a personnel perspective. While the Car
dinal has earned a reputation for its on-court maturity,
the Bears, on the other hand, have been forced to over
come their youth.
Cal starts three freshmen, a sophomore and one se
nior. And four of its seven players coming off the bench
are underclassmen.
While Stanford got off to a quick start in conference
play, Cal found itself 1-2 after losing to Washington
State at Haas and getting blown out by 20 by Arizona
in Tucson.
"It's interesting to go back to the first Arizona
game," Braun said. "We were hurt. We were really dis
appointed back then ... We looked up at half time and
just shook our heads [because] we were down, and I
think it was maybe at that point that we kind of had a
wake up [call]."
"That game became a pretty important game for us,"
Braun continued. "We had so much respect for [Ari
zona] that we started forgetting a little bit about our
selves ... That game has been etched in our minds."
Since that loss to the Wildcats, Cal has gone 6-2 in
Pac-10 play, with losses to only Stanford and Oregon on
the road.
Tomorrow, though, the Bears will face an unbeaten
Stanford team that has looked almost beatable these
past two weeks — almost, although no team has been
able to prove it on the court.
Excluding, of course, the Cardinal's 30-point thrash
ing of Arizona State last Thursday, Stanford has barely
escaped two very close Pac-10 games.

to heat Oregon in Eugene two weeks ago and sur
vived a 14-0 Wildcat second-half run to beat Ari
zona by three at Maples.
Saturday's game against Cal could prove to be
another difficult test for the Cardinal frontcourt.
The Bears boast a talented (albeit young) lineup,
with freshman forwards Marquise Kately and Leon
Powe. The two are averaging a combined 26.6
points and almost 13 rebounds per game. Add into
the mix senior center Amit Tamir — a marksman
who likes to play out on the perimeter — and Cal's
got a tall and dangerous inside-outside combina
tion. Tamir has shot 13-for-22 from 3-point range in
his past three games.
Sophomore forward Matt Haryasz is expected
to return to action, according to Montgomery, after
being sidelined the last two games with a sprained
ankle. His presence could add some much-needed
depth to Stanford's frontcourt, which in man-to
man situations will be forced to chase Tamir around
on the perimeter while keeping Powe in check on
the low post.
"[Tamir's] a great shooter from the perimeter,
and I think anytime you're willing to spend time
and defend a perimeter shooter away from the bas
ket you can probably do that," Montgomery said.
"The problem, of course, is that it opens things up
on the interior."
"You kind of have to pick your poison with good
teams, and Cal's really starting to play well," he
continued. "They understand where guys can be
successful... You have to be willing to give up
something."
It's difficult to imagine that tomorrow's game be
tween No. 2 Stanford and unranked California could be
any more emotional than last week's stunner against
then-No. 12 Arizona — for either Cal or Stanford.
While the Cardinal's (20-0, 11-0 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) last-second win over the Wildcats on Saturday
gained national media attention and has been named an
ESPN "Instant Classic," the Golden Bears had already
upset Arizona, 87-83, earlier that week in a game that
also went down to the wire.
The win catapulted the Bears (11-9, 7-4) into sole
possession of second place in the Pac-10.
But no, no, it couldn't be anymore emotional than
that, right?
Perhaps.
Then again, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, after all.
And, ironically, on this heralded day for lovers' pic
nics and long walks on the beach, the Cardinal will take
the short stroll over the San Mateo Bridge to visit one of
the Pac-10's most hostile venues in Haas Pavilion, to
face Cal in front of a blue-and-gold-clad crowd that re
ally, really, really doesn't like Stanford, like, at all.
