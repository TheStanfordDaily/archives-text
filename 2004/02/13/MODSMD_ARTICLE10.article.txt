# Cal Fulbright apps fail to meet deadline

The Federal Express guarantee, as stated on
its Web site, is simple: "Overnight or overseas,
across borders or across town, you can ab
solutely, positively count on today's Fed Ex."
But on Oct. 20,2003, FedEx broke that promise
when it missed a scheduled pickup at UC-
Berkeley.
The delayed packages contained 30 applica
tions for the prestigious Fulbright-Hays Doc
toral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship
Program, which provides opportunities for
scholarship recipients to undertake full-time
dissertation research abroad.
As a result — even though the mailing date
on the package airbill met the deadline — the

U.S. Department of Education, which adminis
ters the scholarship program, disqualified the
applicants and notified UC-Berkeley officials
on Jan. 30 of this year.
"I'd have to know more details before 1
could offer any opinion as to whether the dead
line was met," said John Pearson, director of
Stanford's Bechtel International Center, which
handles the application process for Stanford
students applying fora number of scholarships,
including the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Disser
tation Research Abroad Fellowship Program.
"My guess is that it was met in the total spirit of
the application process but perhaps not in the
letter of the regulations. In this case, I think it is
very sad what happened to the students."
FedEx has taken full responsibility for its
failure to pick up the applications by the dead

line — the company wrote two letters taking
full blame and citing a computer-software glitch
for the error — but the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation has not reversed its decision.
Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department
of Education Eugene Hickock said in a state
ment released last Friday that UC-Berkeley's
"FedEx ate my homework" excuse was unac
ceptable.
"A simple trip to the post office would have
ensured that the university met the deadline,"
Hickock said. "Once it became evident that
Federal Express did not pick up their package,
it was incumbent upon the university to either
go to a FedEx with the package, or go to the
post office themselves."
