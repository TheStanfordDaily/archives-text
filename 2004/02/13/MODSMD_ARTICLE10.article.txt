# Cal Fulbright apps fail to meet deadline

### CYNTHIA CHO COPY EDITOR 
The Federal Express guarantee, as stated on
its Web site, is simple: "Overnight or overseas,
across borders or across town, you can ab
solutely, positively count on today's Fed Ex."
But on Oct. 20,2003, FedEx broke that promise
when it missed a scheduled pickup at UC-
Berkeley.
The delayed packages contained 30 applica
tions for the prestigious Fulbright-Hays Doc
toral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship
Program, which provides opportunities for
scholarship recipients to undertake full-time
dissertation research abroad.
As a result — even though the mailing date
on the package airbill met the deadline — the

U.S. Department of Education, which adminis
ters the scholarship program, disqualified the
applicants and notified UC-Berkeley officials
on Jan. 30 of this year.
"I'd have to know more details before 1
could offer any opinion as to whether the dead
line was met," said John Pearson, director of
Stanford's Bechtel International Center, which
handles the application process for Stanford
students applying fora number of scholarships,
including the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Disser
tation Research Abroad Fellowship Program.
"My guess is that it was met in the total spirit of
the application process but perhaps not in the
letter of the regulations. In this case, I think it is
very sad what happened to the students."
FedEx has taken full responsibility for its
failure to pick up the applications by the dead

line — the company wrote two letters taking
full blame and citing a computer-software glitch
for the error — but the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation has not reversed its decision.
Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department
of Education Eugene Hickock said in a state
ment released last Friday that UC-Berkeley's
"FedEx ate my homework" excuse was unac
ceptable.
"A simple trip to the post office would have
ensured that the university met the deadline,"
Hickock said. "Once it became evident that
Federal Express did not pick up their package,
it was incumbent upon the university to either
go to a FedEx with the package, or go to the
post office themselves."
This past Tuesday, however, the J. William Ful
bright Scholarship Board, which oversees the Ful
bright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research
Abroad Fellowship Program, agreed to create a sep
arate category for the 30 UC-Berkeley students. If
any of the students are awarded any scholarships,
UC Berkeley will provide the money; normally.
Congress provides the finances.
Steven J. Uhlfelder, chairman of the J. William
Fulbright Scholarship Board, told The New York
Times, "At the end of the day these students who
built up their careers to get to this point didn't make
the mistake."
The State Department, which already administers
other Fulbright scholarship programs, will handle the
administration of the 30 UC-Berkeley applications.
In a Feb. 4 press release, UC-Berkeley adminis
trators explained that when students began to expe
rience problems with the Department of Educa
tion's new e-Grants electronic filing system, the uni
versity decided to have the students submit paper
applications.
"In the past, the applications were sent by
overnight courier two to three days before the dead
line. This year, because of the problems with the on
line filing system, the campus extended its internal
deadline to give students time to complete the paper
applications," UC Berkeley administrators said in a
university press release.
Because UC-Berkeley students were experienc
ing difficulty with the electronic application form,
the university had asked for and was given a waiver
by the U.S. Department of Education to send in the
applications by mail.
"The Department of Education had many prob

lems with its Web applications this year and there
fore I felt it was ridiculous that they couldn't be
more flexible with Berkeley — who had proof that
Fed Ex was a main part of the problem," said Kari
Zimmerman, who was one of Stanford's 11 appli
cants this year.
Zimmerman, a graduate student in history,
added, "I was very surprised when I heard about the
situation at Berkeley. 1 have friends at Berkeley
who applied, so 1 was concerned for them, since
their field research depends completely on outside
funding."
Hickock described the Berkeley administration
as "negligent."
"Some 60 other applicants managed to get their
applications in by the deadline — a deadline that
was known about well in advance," he said.
Stanford has never missed a deadline for this
scholarship. "Over the years Stanford has used reg
ular mail (express) or Fed Ex. We also ask for con
firmation of delivery and try to mail them two to
three days before the national deadline. We do all
we can to confirm that the package has been picked
up or at the very least is stamped before the nation
al deadline has passed," Pearson said.
In light of this year's mishap at UC-Berkeley,
however, Pearson said that Stanford may move for
ward the campus deadline "to ensure we have
enough time to get everything done in time for ei
ther the Overseas Resource Center or the student to
meet the national deadline."
Pearson noted that other competitive scholar
ships, such as the Rhodes, Marshall and Truman
Scholarships, have strict deadlines as well.
"We sent the Truman applications one week be
fore the deadline," said Urban Studies Lecturer
Fred Stout, who is Stanford's faculty representative
this year for the Truman Scholarship competition.
"How Cal can blame FedEx is beyond me. They —
the administrators, not the students — should be
blaming themselves."

this year for the Truman Scholarship competition.
"How Cal can blame FedEx is beyond me. They —
the administrators, not the students — should be
blaming themselves."
The Federal Express guarantee, as stated on
its Web site, is simple: "Overnight or overseas,
across borders or across town, you can ab
solutely, positively count on today's Fed Ex."
But on Oct. 20,2003, FedEx broke that promise
when it missed a scheduled pickup at UC-
Berkeley.
The delayed packages contained 30 applica
tions for the prestigious Fulbright-Hays Doc
toral Dissertation Research Abroad Fellowship
Program, which provides opportunities for
scholarship recipients to undertake full-time
dissertation research abroad.
As a result — even though the mailing date
on the package airbill met the deadline — the

U.S. Department of Education, which adminis
ters the scholarship program, disqualified the
applicants and notified UC-Berkeley officials
on Jan. 30 of this year.
"I'd have to know more details before 1
could offer any opinion as to whether the dead
line was met," said John Pearson, director of
Stanford's Bechtel International Center, which
handles the application process for Stanford
students applying fora number of scholarships,
including the Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Disser
tation Research Abroad Fellowship Program.
"My guess is that it was met in the total spirit of
the application process but perhaps not in the
letter of the regulations. In this case, I think it is
very sad what happened to the students."
FedEx has taken full responsibility for its
failure to pick up the applications by the dead

line — the company wrote two letters taking
full blame and citing a computer-software glitch
for the error — but the U.S. Department of Ed
ucation has not reversed its decision.
Acting Deputy Secretary of the Department
of Education Eugene Hickock said in a state
ment released last Friday that UC-Berkeley's
"FedEx ate my homework" excuse was unac
ceptable.
"A simple trip to the post office would have
ensured that the university met the deadline,"
Hickock said. "Once it became evident that
Federal Express did not pick up their package,
it was incumbent upon the university to either
go to a FedEx with the package, or go to the
post office themselves."
This past Tuesday, however, the J. William Ful
bright Scholarship Board, which oversees the Ful
bright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research
Abroad Fellowship Program, agreed to create a sep
arate category for the 30 UC-Berkeley students. If
any of the students are awarded any scholarships,
UC Berkeley will provide the money; normally.
Congress provides the finances.
Steven J. Uhlfelder, chairman of the J. William
Fulbright Scholarship Board, told The New York
Times, "At the end of the day these students who
built up their careers to get to this point didn't make
the mistake."
The State Department, which already administers
other Fulbright scholarship programs, will handle the
administration of the 30 UC-Berkeley applications.
In a Feb. 4 press release, UC-Berkeley adminis
trators explained that when students began to expe
rience problems with the Department of Educa
tion's new e-Grants electronic filing system, the uni
versity decided to have the students submit paper
applications.
"In the past, the applications were sent by
overnight courier two to three days before the dead
line. This year, because of the problems with the on
line filing system, the campus extended its internal
deadline to give students time to complete the paper
applications," UC Berkeley administrators said in a
university press release.
Because UC-Berkeley students were experienc
ing difficulty with the electronic application form,
the university had asked for and was given a waiver
by the U.S. Department of Education to send in the
applications by mail.
"The Department of Education had many prob

lems with its Web applications this year and there
fore I felt it was ridiculous that they couldn't be
more flexible with Berkeley — who had proof that
Fed Ex was a main part of the problem," said Kari
Zimmerman, who was one of Stanford's 11 appli
cants this year.
Zimmerman, a graduate student in history,
added, "I was very surprised when I heard about the
situation at Berkeley. 1 have friends at Berkeley
who applied, so 1 was concerned for them, since
their field research depends completely on outside
funding."
Hickock described the Berkeley administration
as "negligent."
"Some 60 other applicants managed to get their
applications in by the deadline — a deadline that
was known about well in advance," he said.
Stanford has never missed a deadline for this
scholarship. "Over the years Stanford has used reg
ular mail (express) or Fed Ex. We also ask for con
firmation of delivery and try to mail them two to
three days before the national deadline. We do all
we can to confirm that the package has been picked
up or at the very least is stamped before the nation
al deadline has passed," Pearson said.
In light of this year's mishap at UC-Berkeley,
however, Pearson said that Stanford may move for
ward the campus deadline "to ensure we have
enough time to get everything done in time for ei
ther the Overseas Resource Center or the student to
meet the national deadline."
Pearson noted that other competitive scholar
ships, such as the Rhodes, Marshall and Truman
Scholarships, have strict deadlines as well.
"We sent the Truman applications one week be
fore the deadline," said Urban Studies Lecturer
Fred Stout, who is Stanford's faculty representative
this year for the Truman Scholarship competition.
