This April, Stanford students
will be participating for the first
time in the Imagine Cup, a com
puter-programming contest
sponsored by Microsoft.
The competition is designed
to "empower students to apply
their creativity, knowledge and
technical abilities toward mak
ing the world not only a more
connected place but also a bet
ter place through technology,"
according to Microsoft's Web
site.
The contest features software
design, algorithm, rendering
and short film invitationals,
each of which features a range
of prize money. The top prize in
the software design division is
$25,000.
For entrants from The Farm,

Stanford has participated in
the Imagine Cup so everything
is groundbreaking," said fresh

er industry.
"I expect that I will get a real
world experience developing a
product with a team that I won't
otherwise get in a class room en
vironment," said Nhan Do, a
graduate student in biomedical
informatics.
Do, who is trying to find a
medical application for the smart
phone, however, foresees sacri
