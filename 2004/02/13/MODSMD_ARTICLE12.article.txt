## Thinking outside the box V-Week culminates in ‘Vagina Monologues’ production 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The "Vagina Monologues?" I
vaguely remember hearing the
name on public radio a few
months ago. I also remember
changing the station because I
was in the car with my dad. Hon
estly, when I first walked in on the
productions' dress rehearsal, I
didn't know what to expect —
pornographic drama or harsh
feminist social commentary.
However, it soon became appar
ent that these actors were women
of genuine concern and passion
for the issues and agendas of
women around them.
Sixteen cast members were
garbed in classy black dresses.

Preparing for their final re
hearsal, they scurried around the
stage, waiting to begin. The direc
tor announced that everyone was
there and the group huddled for
warm-ups. Soon, the lights dimmed
and the show began.
Written by Eve Ensler, the
"Vagina Monologues" is a script
compiling prose, poetry and spo
ken word; a collection of true sto
ries of women from all back
grounds — young to old, poor to
rich, pampered to deprived,
straight to lesbian. The mono
logues themselves range in sub
ject as well. Topics include gossip
at a girls-only sleepover, stories
of military rape in Bosnia and
Kosovo, domestic violence and
straight-up self-actualization.

"We were worried," started
the play. Indeed, the monologues
constitute the universal worries
of all women around the world.
"The common thread through all
of the monologues is to raise
awareness to women's issues,"
said senior Sima Gandhi, an ac
tress in the play.
Under this explicit framework
of in-your-face language a
dedication to discussing women's
problems and grievances.
"It's a response to the utter si
lence of society on violence
against women," said actress
Sarah Wilson.
A diverse collage of women
are behind the production. From
drama majors to a management
science and engineering graduate

student, the
women each have
personal incen
tives to take part.
For Wilson, her
goal to motivate
other women
and educate
them drives her.
"Since when
we're children,
we feel like we
have to prove
ourselves wor
thy, somehow
equal to men as if
we started from
different points,"
she said. "It's not
just a woman
thing, though. It's
about being an
educated, re
sponsible college
student in gener
al."
Gandhi first
saw the produc
tion her sopho
more year.
"I was so in
spired that I
went out and got
a mini-skirt —
not to be attrac
tive to the guys
but to feel confi
dent and proud
about myself,"
she said.
As a self-pro
claimed misogy
nist, Gandhi said
acting for the
play has been a
process of "com
ing to terms with
the self" as well.
Liz Gerber, a
27-year old
graduate student,
said she joined

because of her love of the com
munity. "I love the people in
volved," she said.
After seeing the production
elsewhere two years ago, she de
cided to take the leap back into
the undergraduate community.
"Actually, the best parts are the
hours after the show when ev
eryone sits and starts to open up
and share their stories," she
said with a smile.
With all the vaginas and cli
torises thrown about in dia
logue, I wondered if any of these
young women found it embar
rassing or intimidating at first to
use these words.
"Initially, there is some embar
rassment," said Yana Kesala, a
drama major who performs in
the show.
"However, it's good and un
nerving. You have to hear it a
lot to make it part of the every
day language."
Kesala added that the whole
process is part of a "de-stigmati
zation of the word, for it shouldn't
be a word that arouses such dis
comfort when heard."
While thoroughly satisfied
with the production as is, Gandhi
voiced her opinion on the lack of
racial diversity in the cast.
"I believe I am the only Asian
American," she said.
She hopes that in the future,
the performance will draw a more
diverse crowd to the production.
Gerber wishes that more grad
uate students would be part of the
unbelievable experience.
"It's a very inviting crowd, and
I feel like more graduate students
could be part of it," she said.
The production is not an end in
itself. The "Vagina Monologues"
is only part of a grander scheme
of women's issue activism during
V-week, which was organized to
bring attention to community
women's issues. By no means is
V-week only a communal effort;
in alliance with organizations
such as Amnesty International
and companies of major
women's magazines, women ac
tivists are conjoining efforts to
fight gender violence worldwide.
This year's director, senior
Danielle Keenan-Miller, is a
four-year participant of the
Stanford production.
"The 'Vagina Monologues' is
the most important thing I've
done at Stanford," Keenan-
Miller said.
"The show is to promote
awareness and dialogue in the
community, with aim to foster an
environment that does not toler
ate gender violence."

logue, I wondered if any of these
young women found it embar
rassing or intimidating at first to
use these words.
"Initially, there is some embar
rassment," said Yana Kesala, a
drama major who performs in
the show.
"However, it's good and un
nerving. You have to hear it a
lot to make it part of the every
day language."
Kesala added that the whole
process is part of a "de-stigmati
zation of the word, for it shouldn't
be a word that arouses such dis
comfort when heard."
While thoroughly satisfied
with the production as is, Gandhi
voiced her opinion on the lack of
racial diversity in the cast.
"I believe I am the only Asian
American," she said.
She hopes that in the future,
the performance will draw a more
diverse crowd to the production.
Gerber wishes that more grad
uate students would be part of the
unbelievable experience.
"It's a very inviting crowd, and
I feel like more graduate students
could be part of it," she said.
The production is not an end in
itself. The "Vagina Monologues"
is only part of a grander scheme
of women's issue activism during
V-week, which was organized to
bring attention to community
women's issues. By no means is
V-week only a communal effort;
in alliance with organizations
such as Amnesty International
and companies of major
women's magazines, women ac
tivists are conjoining efforts to
fight gender violence worldwide.
This year's director, senior
Danielle Keenan-Miller, is a
four-year participant of the
Stanford production.
"The 'Vagina Monologues' is
the most important thing I've
done at Stanford," Keenan-
Miller said.
"The show is to promote
awareness and dialogue in the
community, with aim to foster an
environment that does not toler
ate gender violence."

The "Vagina Monologues?" I
vaguely remember hearing the
name on public radio a few
months ago. I also remember
changing the station because I
was in the car with my dad. Hon
estly, when I first walked in on the
productions' dress rehearsal, I
didn't know what to expect —
pornographic drama or harsh
feminist social commentary.
However, it soon became appar
ent that these actors were women
of genuine concern and passion
for the issues and agendas of
women around them.
Sixteen cast members were
garbed in classy black dresses.

Preparing for their final re
hearsal, they scurried around the
stage, waiting to begin. The direc
tor announced that everyone was
there and the group huddled for
warm-ups. Soon, the lights dimmed
and the show began.
Written by Eve Ensler, the
"Vagina Monologues" is a script
compiling prose, poetry and spo
ken word; a collection of true sto
ries of women from all back
grounds — young to old, poor to
rich, pampered to deprived,
straight to lesbian. The mono
logues themselves range in sub
ject as well. Topics include gossip
at a girls-only sleepover, stories
of military rape in Bosnia and
Kosovo, domestic violence and
straight-up self-actualization.

"We were worried," started
the play. Indeed, the monologues
constitute the universal worries
of all women around the world.
"The common thread through all
of the monologues is to raise
awareness to women's issues,"
said senior Sima Gandhi, an ac
tress in the play.
Under this explicit framework
of in-your-face language a
dedication to discussing women's
problems and grievances.
"It's a response to the utter si
lence of society on violence
against women," said actress
Sarah Wilson.
A diverse collage of women
are behind the production. From
drama majors to a management
science and engineering graduate

student, the
women each have
personal incen
tives to take part.
For Wilson, her
goal to motivate
other women
and educate
them drives her.
"Since when
we're children,
we feel like we
have to prove
ourselves wor
thy, somehow
equal to men as if
we started from
different points,"
she said. "It's not
just a woman
thing, though. It's
about being an
educated, re
sponsible college
student in gener
al."
Gandhi first
saw the produc
tion her sopho
more year.
"I was so in
spired that I
went out and got
a mini-skirt —
not to be attrac
tive to the guys
but to feel confi
dent and proud
about myself,"
she said.
As a self-pro
claimed misogy
nist, Gandhi said
acting for the
play has been a
process of "com
ing to terms with
the self" as well.
Liz Gerber, a
27-year old
graduate student,
said she joined

because of her love of the com
munity. "I love the people in
volved," she said.
After seeing the production
elsewhere two years ago, she de
cided to take the leap back into
the undergraduate community.
"Actually, the best parts are the
hours after the show when ev
eryone sits and starts to open up
and share their stories," she
said with a smile.
