## Roses are red, but so is everything else at stanford

It's that time of year again. The sun is just beginning to shine, birds
chirp, flowers are in bloom — our premature spring quarter is
upon us at last. But despite the misleading weather, we are still
stuck in February, and Valentine's Day is less than twenty-four
hours away. Couples spend weeks planning how to express their undy
ing love for each other on this superficial holiday. But is everyone real
ly in a relationship as perfect as Nick and Jessica's?
Let's take a look at the statistics: Half of all marriages end in divorce
single people comprise 40 percent of the
adult population; and 10 percent of adults
will never marry. When analyzing the
data, we couldn't help but wonder, why all
the emphasis on couples when the happy
couple often seems like a myth?
Normally on this holiday, the single
tons of the world try to convince them
selves that no, they aren't losers, they're
just independent people that don't need
crappy chocolate in cheesy, red, heart
shaped boxes to prove their individual
worth. And of course, they aren't losers

There's nothing wrong with being single in college or in any stage of
your life. It happens to the best of us. After all, we're single, and check
out that hot mug shot.
This year, we'll be celebrating Valentine's Day alongside the inde
pendent 40 percent. Ever since the "Serial Groper" decided he was
through with Stanford ass. we've resigned ourselves to the fact that our
chances at play were over. Which is why this Valentine's Day, instead of
searching fora last minute romance to fill that empty space in our hearts,
we've decided to hook up with each other. (Just kidding — though we
realize that a bunch of people who know us just read that and thought,
"I KNEW IT ")
But seriously, this Valentine's Day we'll do what we do every time we
end up single this time of year — embrace our independence and have
a good time with our single friends.
There are plenty of ways to make yourself feel special. Sure, it's ok to
treat yourself to a new pair of sexy underwear or go to dinner with a non
romantic friend, but you might be crossing the line if you make yourself
feel too special.
Stick to things you're willing to admit that you did for yourself, but
do try to keep within the boundaries of social acceptability. For ex
ample, don't think that people won't catch on when the Mendicants
show up at your door, red roses in hand, to serenade you out of your
drunken sleep on Saturday morning, and you "have no idea who
could have possibly done this for you!" It was you, you liar, and ev
eryone knows it.
If you buy yourself jewelry, do not on any account publicize it. Gifts
to yourself are a great idea, but when you get into a price range that says
nothing but "this is how much I care about... myself," then you're a lit
tle out of control. And no, "Tiffany" did not give it to you. If she were
giving things away, we'd have much more extensive collections. Re
member to treat yourself well, but a respectable girl never buys herself
diamonds. (Editor's note: Courtney has caught Caroline coming way too
close to buying herself diamonds on several occasions. But then again,
who ever said she was respectable?)
The point is that it's easy to feel lonely on Valentine's Day. But
don't take it too seriously. Most of the couples you know will be break
ing up in the next few months, if not sooner. Just think of it as a chance
to spend money on yourself, rather than on someone you won't be
talking to before long. (Editor's note: Courtney and Caroline spend ob
scene amounts of money on themselves year round and are always look
ing for more opportunities to do so. Please do not take their advice too
seriously.)
So. hit up the mall, make yourself feel like a million bucks and get
so drunk that you don't remember whether or not you have a signifi
cant other.
Not to contradict every empowering thing we've said, but Valen
tine's Day insecurity is mostly a female phenomenon. While girls across
campus will be pretending to embrace their singleness, it's likely that
most romantic advances will be welcome. We don't want to let the cat
out of the bag, but guys, if you play your cards right, it'd be pretty easy
to get a piece of ass tomorrow night.

Want to be our Valentine? We like Veuve Cliquot, a smooth Pinot Noir
and Louis Vuitton anything. Our birthstone is a ruby (yes, we have the
same birthstone). Send dinner reservation info to cbrifiham@stanford.edu
and cciccone@stanford.edu.
