# ASSU must clarify privacy policy
## 
### 
The latest controversy over special
fees has left many confused and
uncertain about the ASSU's true
intent. The ASSU recently dis
closed, via a Web site accessible to all Stan
ford community members, the names and
SUID numbers of students who requested
special fees refunds for this year. In the
past, financial officers of student groups
were provided only with the SUID num
bers of those who requested refunds.
ASSU officials claimed that the new Web
site was designed specifically for the use of
financial officers whose groups received
special fees. But upon the ASSU's creation
of the refund list, an unknown group's fi
nancial officer released the address of the
Web site to the public.
The ASSU certainly has the right to only
release refundees' SUID numbers, as it is
constitutionally mandated to do so. And
we are not necessarily asking for an expla
nation regarding why names were also re
leased. We understand that the ASSU has
been striving for transparency in all as
pects of its actions and transactions. As
such, it may have the right to release both
the names and SUID numbers of refun
dees, though we are not certain this is nec
essary. And even if the ASSU has the right
to release this information, it is not accept
able to have specific SUID numbers corre
spond to names of students on the list.
But what we are most alarmed at is the
manner in which the release of this informa
tion took place. ASSU officials claimed that
they did not create the Web site with the spe
cific intention of releasing the refund records
to the public at large, but that it was at the dis

cretion of financial officers to decide what to
do with the information. Even though the
address of the Web site was not publically an
nounced, it was unrealistic to think that word
of the page would not spread around cam
pus. The ASSU should have assumed this
was to be the end result.
Visitors to the refund Web site only had
to provide SUNet authentication to log in,
allowing those who were not financial offi
cers to access the list. And each financial
officer was able to access a list of refundees
for all groups, rather than only the refun
dees of that officer's respective group.
Even if it were acceptable for financial of
ficers to do what they wished with refund
records for their respective groups, it is far
more questionable that they — along
with the rest of the campus community —
were granted the right to have free access
to other groups' refund records as well.
Apparently others have raised similar
questions on this matter, as the ASSU has
now temporarily removed the list from its
Web site while its officials work to deter
mine what information can be disclosed
and in what form. We applaud the ASSU
for its intercession — even if late — in
pulling the Web site offline until legal and
privacy issues can be resolved. In the fu
ture, however, the ASSU should take
care to explore all possible implications
before taking an action such as posting re
fundees' names and SUID numbers on
line. Lastly, the ASSU should make more
of an effort to fully clarify to students why
the Web site was taken down and what
sort of concerns regarding it are currently
under consideration.
