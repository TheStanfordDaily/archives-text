# Frosh Talent Show looks to be a hit
## 
### 
The first Frosh Talent Show in
several years is scheduled to
take place this Saturday at Kres
ge Auditorium. The constant
stream of enjoyable activities lined up

ford as they undoubtedly did at the high
school level. In this light, we applaud the
Frosh Council for organizing events like
the Frosh Talent Show, where students
can show off qualities that go far beyond
the classroom.
