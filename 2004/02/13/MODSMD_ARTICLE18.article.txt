# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Is Bush your idea of a success? 
### 
I am on the verge of reaching the
outer limits of the "real" world
that so many elders have
warned me about. I look for
ward to this day of spiritual enlighten
ment, which they call a "rude awaken
ing." These elders have dutifully in
structed me to search fora mystical
prize called success. Success is like the
beauty of a woman — it lies in the eye
of the beholder. If none of the be
holder's buddies agree with him, then
the beholder will forsake his position
and blame it on the booze.
For example, some define suc
cess as two children, a picket fence
and a mid-sized luxury sedan. Oth
ers set their sights higher: Three
children of mixed gender, a white
picket fence with a lush green lawn
and a luxury sport utility vehicle
with climate controlled seats. Still,
others reach for the skies: Success
requires three children that appro
priately fit their respective gender
roles, a state-of-the-art living facility
in a security-patrolled gated com
munity with illegal immigrant hedge
cutters and a Ford Excommunicator
with a passenger side muzzle for the
trophy partner and external lasers
to ward off unsolicited homeless
veterans from trying to make a buck
washing the windshield. For my
Uncle Charlie, success is three bur
ritos and a nacho supreme.
Naturally, as a conflicted and
confused young man in his early
twenties, I have been struggling to
define what success means to me so
that I can make a down payment to
whichever agency offers it. Unfortu
nately, I am having a much easier
time figuring out what success isn't
rather than what it is. Let's take our
beloved president as an example as
we navigate through this article.
To begin with, my test for
whether someone is successful as an
individual is basically whether 1
would accept $40 to be that person.
Further, I know that money isn't
sufficient to guarantee happiness. It
is necessary, though (unless you
forego technology and the conve
nience of processed food and immu
nize yourself against an epidemic of
unabashed material conformity —
which no one is gonna do, come on).
But. wealth does not equal suc
cess. Most of us have accepted this
message by now — either through
the doctrines of abundantly wealthy
organized religions that glorify
poverty (please contribute to the
collection basket) or the multi-mil
lion dollar film industry that hires
abnormally gorgeous people to
teach us how to look into our hearts
(for $10 a pop). However, a number
of you soulless individuals will soon
embark on careers of investment
banking — a common path for those

who yearn to dismember their roots
and vote Republican. Speaking of
which — George W. Bush has

enough money to
fill up Hoover
tower and name it
the "Money Bin."
I also don't be
lieve that a loving
family is necessar
ily a measure of
success. Family
building is like na
tion-building —
which is like drug

abusing: The fun stuff comes first
and then hell sends the bill. Any
thing meriting my definition of suc
cess ought to be an uphill battle, not
a downhill trap. I love family, but so
do some murderers and paparazzi.
Even George has a nice family.
Then there are accolades, which
I definitely do not trust. From what
I have seen, the correlation be
tween receiving and deserving
awards is similar to the correlation
between sex and female orgasm. In
an ideal world, they go hand in
hand. In this "real" world, they
often occur exclusive of each other.
George has more accolades than
words in his vocabulary. That says
something ... I think.
There are other measures of self
worth. Some of us will exploit the
prestige of the name on our diplo
mas or at least point to it and say,
"Look, I am high caliber." But ad
missions officers are like apple pick
ers. They occasionally pick bad ones
and step on good ones. There are
lots of arbitrary factors that go into
the process — like your wealth,
your dad's name and your freedom
to study in high school while others
spent their time contributing to
their families' meager incomes.
Then there are little bastards like
those kids from Paly High who visit
admissions offices and kiss ass. They
know what they are doing though,
because with a well-respected alma
mater, you can demonstrate overt
stupidity on a daily basis and still
never rid your peers of their un
founded assumptions that there is
more to you than meets the eye.
George W. Bush attended Yale and
Harvard.
What about fame and power?
Public service? These are also things
that George can add to his resume.
But while "President of the United
States of America" is more attractive
to the majority of employers than
"Weekly Columnist at The Daily,"
I'm still unlikely to take the 40 bucks.
George very clearly meets the
standard criteria for success, but I
just can't give it up for such criteria.
The contradictions are glaring. It
doesn't appear like anything in his

life was earned the hard way — ex
cept maybe his shrugging off of an
alcohol addiction and cocaine habit.
Even still, under his governorship,
he locked up 30,000 people a year
for drug possession charges under
laws that he passed himself. For or
dinary Americans, the hard way
wasn't finding Jesus. It was prison.
His much-touted military service
that led to that cheesy stunt on the
aircraft carrier last year was the re
sult of pulled strings. He skipped
ahead of a 150-person waiting list to
avoid a tour in Viet Nam. Mean
while ordinary Americans had no
control over where they served and.
for too many, when they died.
He also accepted a controversial
win in an election and had no
qualms about it. No need to make
Americans feel secure in their
democracy, George. Just muscle
your way into the White House, de
spite all those uncounted Floridian
votes — most of which were cast in
minority precincts. Of course, ordi
nary Americans have to win elec
tions to assume office.
Bush also clearly exaggerated the
need to go to war. This is indisputable
now. Paul O'Neill, the former trea
sury secretary who was fired for esti
mating the war would cost $2(X) billion
(we've already spent $100 billion and
there's no end in sight), said that Bush
was planning the war before Sept. 11
— an interesting detail that doesn't fly
with Bush's interview last Sunday on
"Meet the Press," in which he ratio
nalized the war by invoking the World
Trace Center attacks. George Tenet
said he made it very clear to the ad
ministration that there were conflict
ing interpretations of the intelligence.
Bush's new story is that Saddam could
have sought weapons of mass destruc
tion, and had he obtained them, he
would have used them. Is this just a
communication gap?
Perhaps it's silly to expect Bush
to spell out a justification for the war
that conforms to all this newly pub
lic information when he can't even
spell the word "justification." In re
ality, he just really wanted to invade
Iraq. You can't blame him for de
manding immediate accommoda
tion for whatever he sets his heart
on with no questions asked. That's
the story of his life.
Am I any closer to a definition of
success? No, but George W. Bush's
twisted version of success seems to
conform to many of the traditional
standards, thus posing a serious
threat to their validity. Then again,
his story may just prove that the
ends don't justify the means.

of the beholder. If none of the be
holder's buddies agree with him, then
the beholder will forsake his position
and blame it on the booze.
For example, some define suc
cess as two children, a picket fence
and a mid-sized luxury sedan. Oth
ers set their sights higher: Three
children of mixed gender, a white
picket fence with a lush green lawn
and a luxury sport utility vehicle
with climate controlled seats. Still,
others reach for the skies: Success
requires three children that appro
priately fit their respective gender
roles, a state-of-the-art living facility
in a security-patrolled gated com
munity with illegal immigrant hedge
cutters and a Ford Excommunicator
with a passenger side muzzle for the
trophy partner and external lasers
to ward off unsolicited homeless
veterans from trying to make a buck
washing the windshield. For my
Uncle Charlie, success is three bur
ritos and a nacho supreme.
Naturally, as a conflicted and
confused young man in his early
twenties, I have been struggling to
define what success means to me so
that I can make a down payment to
whichever agency offers it. Unfortu
nately, I am having a much easier
time figuring out what success isn't
rather than what it is. Let's take our
beloved president as an example as
we navigate through this article.
To begin with, my test for
whether someone is successful as an
individual is basically whether 1
would accept $40 to be that person.
Further, I know that money isn't
sufficient to guarantee happiness. It
is necessary, though (unless you
forego technology and the conve
nience of processed food and immu
nize yourself against an epidemic of
unabashed material conformity —
which no one is gonna do, come on).
But. wealth does not equal suc
cess. Most of us have accepted this
message by now — either through
the doctrines of abundantly wealthy
organized religions that glorify
poverty (please contribute to the
collection basket) or the multi-mil
lion dollar film industry that hires
abnormally gorgeous people to
teach us how to look into our hearts
(for $10 a pop). However, a number
of you soulless individuals will soon
embark on careers of investment
banking — a common path for those

who yearn to dismember their roots
and vote Republican. Speaking of
which — George W. Bush has

enough money to
fill up Hoover
tower and name it
the "Money Bin."
I also don't be
lieve that a loving
family is necessar
ily a measure of
success. Family
building is like na
tion-building —
which is like drug

abusing: The fun stuff comes first
and then hell sends the bill. Any
thing meriting my definition of suc
cess ought to be an uphill battle, not
a downhill trap. I love family, but so
do some murderers and paparazzi.
Even George has a nice family.
Then there are accolades, which
I definitely do not trust. From what
I have seen, the correlation be
tween receiving and deserving
awards is similar to the correlation
between sex and female orgasm. In
an ideal world, they go hand in
hand. In this "real" world, they
often occur exclusive of each other.
George has more accolades than
words in his vocabulary. That says
something ... I think.
There are other measures of self
worth. Some of us will exploit the
prestige of the name on our diplo
mas or at least point to it and say,
"Look, I am high caliber." But ad
missions officers are like apple pick
ers. They occasionally pick bad ones
and step on good ones. There are
lots of arbitrary factors that go into
the process — like your wealth,
your dad's name and your freedom
to study in high school while others
spent their time contributing to
their families' meager incomes.
Then there are little bastards like
those kids from Paly High who visit
admissions offices and kiss ass. They
know what they are doing though,
because with a well-respected alma
mater, you can demonstrate overt
stupidity on a daily basis and still
never rid your peers of their un
founded assumptions that there is
more to you than meets the eye.
George W. Bush attended Yale and
Harvard.
What about fame and power?
Public service? These are also things
that George can add to his resume.
But while "President of the United
States of America" is more attractive
to the majority of employers than
"Weekly Columnist at The Daily,"
I'm still unlikely to take the 40 bucks.
George very clearly meets the
standard criteria for success, but I
just can't give it up for such criteria.
The contradictions are glaring. It
doesn't appear like anything in his

life was earned the hard way — ex
cept maybe his shrugging off of an
alcohol addiction and cocaine habit.
Even still, under his governorship,
he locked up 30,000 people a year
for drug possession charges under
laws that he passed himself. For or
dinary Americans, the hard way
wasn't finding Jesus. It was prison.
His much-touted military service
that led to that cheesy stunt on the
aircraft carrier last year was the re
sult of pulled strings. He skipped
ahead of a 150-person waiting list to
avoid a tour in Viet Nam. Mean
while ordinary Americans had no
control over where they served and.
for too many, when they died.
He also accepted a controversial
win in an election and had no
qualms about it. No need to make
Americans feel secure in their
democracy, George. Just muscle
your way into the White House, de
spite all those uncounted Floridian
votes — most of which were cast in
minority precincts. Of course, ordi
nary Americans have to win elec
tions to assume office.
Bush also clearly exaggerated the
need to go to war. This is indisputable
now. Paul O'Neill, the former trea
sury secretary who was fired for esti
mating the war would cost $2(X) billion
(we've already spent $100 billion and
there's no end in sight), said that Bush
was planning the war before Sept. 11
— an interesting detail that doesn't fly
with Bush's interview last Sunday on
"Meet the Press," in which he ratio
nalized the war by invoking the World
Trace Center attacks. George Tenet
said he made it very clear to the ad
ministration that there were conflict
ing interpretations of the intelligence.
Bush's new story is that Saddam could
have sought weapons of mass destruc
tion, and had he obtained them, he
would have used them. Is this just a
communication gap?
Perhaps it's silly to expect Bush
to spell out a justification for the war
that conforms to all this newly pub
lic information when he can't even
spell the word "justification." In re
ality, he just really wanted to invade
Iraq. You can't blame him for de
manding immediate accommoda
tion for whatever he sets his heart
on with no questions asked. That's
the story of his life.
Am I any closer to a definition of
success? No, but George W. Bush's
twisted version of success seems to
conform to many of the traditional
standards, thus posing a serious
threat to their validity. Then again,
his story may just prove that the
ends don't justify the means.
