# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Warning: Seek love advice elsewhere 
### 
As a columnist, I'm bound
by law to write about
Valentine's Day. It's like
how stand up comedians
right now are required to make
jokes about Janet Jackson's bounc
ing breasts. It's a law, written down
in ancient times ... back when the
Red Sox last won the series. But
even if I am both an opinionated
person and a humorist, I'm trying to
avoid the overdone topics of love
and Valentine's Day.
You wouldn't want my opinions
on love, anyway. Go read someone
else about how to make a romantic
gathering special or what kind of gift
to buy your love. My idea of a ro
mantic is Sam Spade, and "42" is my
answer to all of life, love and the uni
verse's questions. Likewise, my idea
of a great love ballad is "Red
Sweater" by the Aquabats. But
most importantly, what I seek in a
woman is someone who under
stands what the hell I just said.
Because let's face it, there are no
easy answers when it comes to love.
No sex columnist. TV talk show host
or Justin Timberlake will fully satisfy
you. Especially not the latter; I hear he
doesn't know what a "bad touch" is.
People ain't be generalized — and
what works for one person won't work
for everyone. If an advice dispenser tells
you to buy chocolate for your love, re
member: It might be right for somebody,
but not fora lover who is allergic to
chocokite. Likewise, taking your lover to

a romantic movie may spark a sensual
night or may end in disaster if the movie
stars Hugh Grant. And it could be great

to take your lover to
a romantic Italian
restaurant, or very
bad if your lover
hates Italian people.
So basically, use
common sense.
Know who you
love, know what
situations would
suit them and know
that no matter what

their taste in romantic movies, Hugh
Grant is terrible.
"What if I'm trying to find love?"
Hahahaha! Stop asking such
stupid questions! Of course you
have a lover, don't make me laugh!
You'd be the only person in the
world to not have a date for Valen
tine's Day. I mean, you would have
to be the biggest loser on the face of
this earth. Wow. I thought a person
like you was only rumored to exist,
purely mythical... like Big Foot, or
Iraq's WMDs.
Well now that I know you exist,
(again, so sad), what do you want
me to do about it? Ah, perhaps aid
you in finding love? Give you ad
vice? Well again, this is something
that everyone else has done before,
much like Paris Hilton. Every hu
morist has tread upon this path a
thousand times.
Valentine's Day, especially, has

been satirized and analyzed in every
way possible. I can't find of anything
interesting to say.
So I want to talk about Hal
loween. Stay with me. I'll simply give
you advice fora great Halloween,
and you can substitute it for love,
Valentine's Day and the rest of your
petty problems. You can interpret it
any way you want. Okay, here we go.
First, on the night of Halloween
(Valentine's Day), wear a mask or
some silly costume you would not
normally wear. This will both scare
off others and your enthusiasm will
impress the ones that count. When
approaching their doorway, greet
them genuinely, so that you may be
able to get goodies later. When din
ing. make sure that your company
eats first; this way you'll know if your
food has been poisoned by those
creepy neighbors down the street.
Don't fill up on treats early on —
you may need that extra burst of en
ergy toward the end of the night.
Later in the night after all, people
are tired and more likely to give up
treats with practically no effort on
your behalf.
And if not all goes as planned,
you can always egg their doorway.

Chris Holt encourages female read
ers to write in if they understood the
earlier obscure references and are the
one person on the planet alone on
Valentine's Day. Chris can he
