# Stanford hosts Cal at Maples
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a disastrous road trip to Arizona last
weekend, the No. 11 women's basketball team
is seeking to reestablish its position as one of
the top teams in the nation. Stanford (17-5, 10-
3 Pacific-10 Conference) faces off Saturday at
home against a California team that suffered
the death of a player shortly after their last
game against the Cardinal, in January.
The Bears lost reserve player Alisa Lewis to
bacterial meningitis just days after playing Stan
ford at Haas Pavilion on Jan. 16. The loss of a
teammate coupled with an abysmal conference
record (2-11 in the Pac-10, 9-13 overall) and a
nine-game losing streak have left the Cal women
mentally drained.
"Now that there's been some time [since
Alisa's death], it becomes more difficult for some
reason," said Cal head coach Caren Horstmeyer.
"Everyone's in a different place, where our team
was initially together every minute. We work
with the loss of Alisa and we need to work on us
getting back to our fundamentals."
Senior guard Nihan Anaz leads the Bears with
15.5 points per game and four rebounds per
game. Cal has had little luck on the road, winning
only one away game this season. Stanford leads
the all-time series against the Bears 39-15.
Back-to-back losses to No. 24 Arizona and
Arizona State dropped the Cardinal out of the
top 10 nationally and have given Arizona a half-

game lead to rise to the top spot in the Pac-10.
While the Pac-10 race seemed open before
last weekend, Stanford's downfall has truly bro
ken the rankings open. Arizona, the projected
No. 2 in the pre-season coaches* poll, has
jumped ahead of the Cardinal in the conference
rankings and Arizona State has shown that it's
far from impossible to catch Stanford off-guard.
Stanford was badly outmatched at center
against Arizona's 6-foot-5 Shawntinice Polk. 6-
foot-5 freshman center Kristen Newlin was out
with a bone bruise and junior 6-3 center Chelsea
Trotter is still playing limited minutes. Polk had
a huge advantage over the Cardinal women,
and she used her size to score 21 points and grab
19 rebounds, including nine offensive boards.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer was
pragmatic about the team's performance last
weekend, saying "We didn't play as well as we
needed to play."
While the team's 16-percent shooting in the
second half against Arizona State and 2-of-25
shooting from the 3-point line was anomalous
for the Cardinal, there are some consistent
problems that she plans to address in practice.
"We always try to evaluate everything
we're doing to make practice more competi
tive," VanDerveer said. "I think our rebound
ing situation is one of our biggest problems.
We're keeping stats in practice on who's real
ly helping us."
Newlin has been solid on rebounding this
season. Averaging six rebounds per game, she is

second only to senior forward Nicole Powell,
who averages 11.2 per game. VanDerveer has
repeatedly highlighted the rotational possibili
ties that Newlin brings to the court.
"Kristen makes a huge difference, and it's
not just her but [also] her ability to rest other
people," VanDerveer said. "It also allows us to
play T'Nae [Thiel] and Kristen together and
play Nicole more at the three."
VanDerveer said that she wants better lead
ership on the court from the Cardinal's veterans.
"I think you have to have the experienced
players on your team rally people together," she
said. "Players say, 'No, we've got to create our
own momentum.' I think we need more from our
experienced players, juniors and seniors."
Powell expressed her responsibility as one of
the senior players succinctly.
"I believe that it's my role to be a leader by
example," she said.
Even though Horstmeyer admitted that
Stanford would be a hard team to beat, she
takes the example of teams like the Sun Devils
and in working to improve her team. She wants
the Cal squad to focus on their help-side de
fense and rebounding.
"Everyday, our goal is to improve and get bet
ter," Horstmeyer said. "ASU in particular has
done a great job of getting better and improving
over time. [We] don't think about winning and

losing, [we] think about the little things.
The Pac-10 has definitely become a more
even playing field, but the Cardinal has defeated
every team except USC this season. But physical
teams have given Stanford problems this season,
and the Cardinal has sometimes folded under
pressure.
"There are a lot of talented players on our
schedule," VanDerveer said. "If we don't come
out and get after it and play with great intensity,
we don't have a chance. I think the light went on.
Boy this is what it will feel like at the end if we
don't shape up.'"
Powell doesn't plan to dwell on last weekend s
losses when preparing for the face-off with Cal.
"I think that it's just important to focus on the
things that will help us to be successful and do ev
erything in our power to execute it on the floor,
she said.
And if anything, last weekend showed that the
Cardinal can't rest on its laurels at the half.
"What 20 minutes do you want to define you?"
asked VanDerveer. "Twenty minutes at Arizona
State or 20 minutes that you're capable of?"
