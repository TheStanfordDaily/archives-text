# OP-ED
## Students don't need to support FAIR to fight discrimination 
### HANS ALLHOFF 
Last September, an organization called the
Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights
(FAIR) sued Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary
of defense. Nearly a month later, 44 Yale Law
School faculty members and a coalition of their
students followed with almost identical suits of
their own. In mid-January of this year, 54 Har
vard Law School professors filed a brief on
FAI R's behalf. Just recently, I learned Stanford
Law School faculty voted to join FAIR.
The issue at hand is the Solomon Amend
ment, which was passed by Congress in 1996
and threatens to confiscate government dollars
from schools whose policy it is not to allow mil
itary recruiters onto campus. Because
Solomon, in effect, forces those schools to
abandon such a policy, FAIR believes it vio
lates a First Amendment right to free speech
and association. As their complaint puts it.

their suit "is about the freedom of educational
institutions, specifically law schools, to shape
their own pedagogical environments and to
teach, by word and deed, the values they
choose, free from government intrusion." One
of those values is mutual respect — something
our military's "don't ask don't tell" policy, it
must be admitted, denies to gays.
To their great credit, most American law
schools believe that one's sexual orientation,
alongside other personal characteristics, has no
bearing on an individual's professional abilities.
Is it really so unreasonable of them to want to
deny their facilities to employers who reject this
belief and refuse to consider students without
regard to those characteristics?
Well, yes. I say this, however, not because 1
think "don't ask don't tell" is unobjectionable,
but because I refuse to believe a policy of re
verse discrimination is the best way to protest it.
The Solomon Amendment—just like the

USA PATRIOT Act, speed limits and bans on
recreational marijuana use — is a law. Since
when does our acquiescence to a law mean we
think it's wise and just, or that we're forbidden
from speaking out against it? The Solomon
Amendment doesn't oblige any law school to
approve of "don't ask don't tell," and it certain
ly can't prohibit any one from criticizing it.
FAIR's complaint smacks of what Harvard
professor Frederick Schauer calls "First
Amendment Opportunism." For lack of a bet
ter argument, FAIR has conscripted the First
Amendment for its doctrinal and rhetorical
force. Its relevance, however, is dubious.
What, then, is a law school's freedom to
shape its own "pedagogical environment" and
to "teach its own values" really about? Judging
by its complaint, FAIR seems to believe certain
values, like mutual respect, must be insulated
from competition if they're to be "taught" —
and if a law school's commitment to them is to

be taken seriously. Must they, though?
I'm not so sure. FAIR's complaints strike
me as public relations work, or a form of moral
grandstanding. It's one thing to simply assert
our ethical commitments; it's quite another to
put those commitments to a test and to prove
they're for real. If Stanford Law School were to
allow military recruiters to use its facilities, its
commitment to tolerance would only be dent
ed if it were structurally weak to begin with.
Which makes me wonder: Is it a firm allegiance
to tolerance driving FAIR's complaint, or
rather a discreet insecurity about just how firm
this allegiance is?
Little thought appears to have been given
to a serious question: What does it mean for
an institution to have values, and how ought it
go about upholding those values? It may seem
counter intuitive, but sometimes it's best to
take a stand by taking a seat — not because
our values aren't worth fighting for, but be

cause we've got plenty of faith already in their
alignment with what is right and good. So
much faith, in fact, we're unable to even take
competing values seriously or regard them as
a threat to our own. Isn't this a powerful
enough statement?
The solution seems to me to be obvious. In
vite Donald Rumsfeld to send military re
cruiters our way. If homophobia is something
we're against — and I mean absolutely op
posed to — then their mission will be doomed
to failure. We'll bore them into building sculp
tures out of whatever novelty items they've
brought to exchange for our email addresses.
What's more, we would be combating bigotry
with principled action and not a stubborn intol
erance of our own.

Last September, an organization called the
Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights
(FAIR) sued Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary
of defense. Nearly a month later, 44 Yale Law
School faculty members and a coalition of their
students followed with almost identical suits of
their own. In mid-January of this year, 54 Har
vard Law School professors filed a brief on
FAI R's behalf. Just recently, I learned Stanford
Law School faculty voted to join FAIR.
The issue at hand is the Solomon Amend
ment, which was passed by Congress in 1996
and threatens to confiscate government dollars
from schools whose policy it is not to allow mil
itary recruiters onto campus. Because
Solomon, in effect, forces those schools to
abandon such a policy, FAIR believes it vio
lates a First Amendment right to free speech
and association. As their complaint puts it.

their suit "is about the freedom of educational
institutions, specifically law schools, to shape
their own pedagogical environments and to
teach, by word and deed, the values they
choose, free from government intrusion." One
of those values is mutual respect — something
our military's "don't ask don't tell" policy, it
must be admitted, denies to gays.
To their great credit, most American law
schools believe that one's sexual orientation,
alongside other personal characteristics, has no
bearing on an individual's professional abilities.
Is it really so unreasonable of them to want to
deny their facilities to employers who reject this
belief and refuse to consider students without
regard to those characteristics?
Well, yes. I say this, however, not because 1
think "don't ask don't tell" is unobjectionable,
but because I refuse to believe a policy of re
verse discrimination is the best way to protest it.
The Solomon Amendment—just like the

USA PATRIOT Act, speed limits and bans on
recreational marijuana use — is a law. Since
when does our acquiescence to a law mean we
think it's wise and just, or that we're forbidden
from speaking out against it? The Solomon
Amendment doesn't oblige any law school to
approve of "don't ask don't tell," and it certain
ly can't prohibit any one from criticizing it.
FAIR's complaint smacks of what Harvard
professor Frederick Schauer calls "First
Amendment Opportunism." For lack of a bet
ter argument, FAIR has conscripted the First
Amendment for its doctrinal and rhetorical
force. Its relevance, however, is dubious.
What, then, is a law school's freedom to
shape its own "pedagogical environment" and
to "teach its own values" really about? Judging
by its complaint, FAIR seems to believe certain
values, like mutual respect, must be insulated
from competition if they're to be "taught" —
and if a law school's commitment to them is to

be taken seriously. Must they, though?
I'm not so sure. FAIR's complaints strike
me as public relations work, or a form of moral
grandstanding. It's one thing to simply assert
our ethical commitments; it's quite another to
put those commitments to a test and to prove
they're for real. If Stanford Law School were to
allow military recruiters to use its facilities, its
commitment to tolerance would only be dent
ed if it were structurally weak to begin with.
Which makes me wonder: Is it a firm allegiance
to tolerance driving FAIR's complaint, or
rather a discreet insecurity about just how firm
this allegiance is?
Little thought appears to have been given
to a serious question: What does it mean for
an institution to have values, and how ought it
go about upholding those values? It may seem
counter intuitive, but sometimes it's best to
take a stand by taking a seat — not because
our values aren't worth fighting for, but be

cause we've got plenty of faith already in their
alignment with what is right and good. So
much faith, in fact, we're unable to even take
competing values seriously or regard them as
a threat to our own. Isn't this a powerful
enough statement?
The solution seems to me to be obvious. In
vite Donald Rumsfeld to send military re
cruiters our way. If homophobia is something
we're against — and I mean absolutely op
posed to — then their mission will be doomed
to failure. We'll bore them into building sculp
tures out of whatever novelty items they've
brought to exchange for our email addresses.
What's more, we would be combating bigotry
with principled action and not a stubborn intol
erance of our own.
