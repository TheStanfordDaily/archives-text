## Peacock hunting and white flight: Julie takes a trip home to SoCal 
### 
Characteristically, I missed the recent
legendary basketball game against
Arizona. But it it was such an amazing
win. why all the hype about Tiger
Woods? Was there some kind of causal thing
going on with him there that made the game
legendary?
So, 1 was visiting the parents during the
Great Game when I came across the oddest
of tangentially-related-to-sports topics:
hunting. Not the lame excuse fora sport that
middle American men like to count as their
occasional "exercise," aka a way to get out of
the house, because we all know that hunting
is no more a sport than sitting in your front
yard and getting excited when the mail ar
rives. Beer in hand, maybe some camouflage.

Hunters will protest. But
Julie, there are hunting com
petitions that are quite com
petitive, like the Illinois Up
land Series, where we hunt
for pheasants. And rifle
shooting is an Olympic sport.
I'm talking about a differ
ent kind of hunting. Trans
port yourself 360 miles south
of Stanford, and slightly east

of Pasadena, which is slightly east of Los An
geles, to a little city called Arcadia, complete
ly unrelated to the Tom Stoppard play. But
home to Seabiscuit's old racetrack, a mall, a
sizeable number of peacocks milling around
by the arboretum and, oh yeah, my home.
Peacocks. You know, stupid, slightly ob
noxious (but very pretty) birds that wander
through my neighborhood, trying to cross the
street only when a car approaches, occasional
ly excreting on the driveway, but usually mind
ing their business.
Until some asshole with a BB gun decides
he's sick of the scenery.
Who kills a peacock? I'm not even talking
about unruly children running after their
prized tail feathers, I'm talking about full
grown men who are sick of having their wives'
flowers nibbled on.
Here's an interesting parallel: This same
beloved neighborhood of mine is undergoing
the 2004 version of what sociologists call white
flight — Successful young Asians move in and
disgruntled old, white conservatives move out.
Every time there's a house for sale, it's the
same thing. Obviously some white neighbors
are not happy with the new company. But we
don't go around shooting our neighbors now,
do we?
At least, not in upper-middle-class Arcadia.
We only shoot our birds.
In the interest of fairness, I would guess
that there are only a few diehard peacock
haters lurking about. In the interest of getting
off your ass, there are other animals you can
hunt away from your front yard: There are
guided hunting tours you can take nowadays,
so you're assured to find an animal to shoot,
instead of setting camp in the woods and hop
ing no stray bullets come your way. Or instead
of setting camp in the front yard and busting a
few caps off your son's BB gun.
Peacocks come from the turf. Athletes deal
with chafing, large-breasted female athletes
need extra-support sports bras, swimmers
shave their bodies, wrestlers have to wear
spandex . . . yet we don't see anyone shooting
at their nether regions, breasts or leg hairs,
now, do we? Or, wrestlers running around
naked? Some say it's a good thing, some say
it's a bad thing.
You move into the neighborhood, you deal
with peacocks.
Otherwise you can just move out, like when
a white neighbor yearns for the good old days
when whites stayed in one place and blacks
lived in another. Oh, wait, residential segrega
tion is still going on. Move out if your archaic
mindset feels the need, but for God's sake,
don't shoot at anybody.
Poor little birds.
How can killing another animal classify as
a sport? We could draw a parallel to rodeos,
where if the bull isn't getting shot, it's get
ting electrically prodded in its nether re
gions. Ouch. Or maybe frog races, as if you
owning the frog has anything to do with its
jumping.
But Julie, you say, one guy shooting one
peacock isn't even hunting, and you don't even
write sports columns! If hunting means the
sport of going out. tracking down and shooting
animals whose habitats, lifestyles and species
are already being stomped on, then no, one
neighbor victimizing one peacock is not hunt
ing. But under this definition, neither is taking
a guided tour to the "wilderness" to "find" a
"wild" animal.
I'll withhold my parent's address in this
whole mess, before someone is tempted to
chuck a Good Housekeeping magazine at the
house — or better yet, fire a few rounds at my
cat through the front window.
Poor little kitty.

If Julie lives in "Arcadia," why doesn't she
have a tortoise? E-mail Julie at julieolo@stan
ford.edu and tell her to put a Stoppard to all
this nonsense and start up the "Free Chris
Lewis" campaign again.

are not happy with the new company. But we
don't go around shooting our neighbors now,
do we?
At least, not in upper-middle-class Arcadia.
We only shoot our birds.
In the interest of fairness, I would guess
that there are only a few diehard peacock
haters lurking about. In the interest of getting
off your ass, there are other animals you can
hunt away from your front yard: There are
guided hunting tours you can take nowadays,
so you're assured to find an animal to shoot,
instead of setting camp in the woods and hop
ing no stray bullets come your way. Or instead
of setting camp in the front yard and busting a
few caps off your son's BB gun.
Peacocks come from the turf. Athletes deal
with chafing, large-breasted female athletes
need extra-support sports bras, swimmers
shave their bodies, wrestlers have to wear
spandex . . . yet we don't see anyone shooting
at their nether regions, breasts or leg hairs,
now, do we? Or, wrestlers running around
naked? Some say it's a good thing, some say
it's a bad thing.
You move into the neighborhood, you deal
with peacocks.
Otherwise you can just move out, like when
a white neighbor yearns for the good old days
when whites stayed in one place and blacks
lived in another. Oh, wait, residential segrega
tion is still going on. Move out if your archaic
mindset feels the need, but for God's sake,
don't shoot at anybody.
Poor little birds.
How can killing another animal classify as
a sport? We could draw a parallel to rodeos,
where if the bull isn't getting shot, it's get
ting electrically prodded in its nether re
gions. Ouch. Or maybe frog races, as if you
owning the frog has anything to do with its
jumping.
But Julie, you say, one guy shooting one
peacock isn't even hunting, and you don't even
write sports columns! If hunting means the
sport of going out. tracking down and shooting
animals whose habitats, lifestyles and species
are already being stomped on, then no, one
neighbor victimizing one peacock is not hunt
ing. But under this definition, neither is taking
a guided tour to the "wilderness" to "find" a
"wild" animal.
I'll withhold my parent's address in this
whole mess, before someone is tempted to
chuck a Good Housekeeping magazine at the
house — or better yet, fire a few rounds at my
cat through the front window.
Poor little kitty.

If Julie lives in "Arcadia," why doesn't she
have a tortoise? E-mail Julie at julieolo@stan
ford.edu and tell her to put a Stoppard to all
this nonsense and start up the "Free Chris
Lewis" campaign again.

Characteristically, I missed the recent
legendary basketball game against
Arizona. But it it was such an amazing
win. why all the hype about Tiger
Woods? Was there some kind of causal thing
going on with him there that made the game
legendary?
So, 1 was visiting the parents during the
Great Game when I came across the oddest
of tangentially-related-to-sports topics:
hunting. Not the lame excuse fora sport that
middle American men like to count as their
occasional "exercise," aka a way to get out of
the house, because we all know that hunting
is no more a sport than sitting in your front
yard and getting excited when the mail ar
rives. Beer in hand, maybe some camouflage.

Hunters will protest. But
Julie, there are hunting com
petitions that are quite com
petitive, like the Illinois Up
land Series, where we hunt
for pheasants. And rifle
shooting is an Olympic sport.
I'm talking about a differ
ent kind of hunting. Trans
port yourself 360 miles south
of Stanford, and slightly east

of Pasadena, which is slightly east of Los An
geles, to a little city called Arcadia, complete
ly unrelated to the Tom Stoppard play. But
home to Seabiscuit's old racetrack, a mall, a
sizeable number of peacocks milling around
by the arboretum and, oh yeah, my home.
Peacocks. You know, stupid, slightly ob
noxious (but very pretty) birds that wander
through my neighborhood, trying to cross the
street only when a car approaches, occasional
ly excreting on the driveway, but usually mind
ing their business.
Until some asshole with a BB gun decides
he's sick of the scenery.
Who kills a peacock? I'm not even talking
about unruly children running after their
prized tail feathers, I'm talking about full
grown men who are sick of having their wives'
flowers nibbled on.
Here's an interesting parallel: This same
beloved neighborhood of mine is undergoing
the 2004 version of what sociologists call white
flight — Successful young Asians move in and
disgruntled old, white conservatives move out.
