# Wrestlers ready for rival UC-Davis
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Like the token wallflower at a high
school dance, the Stanford wrestling
team did not particularly enjoy Valen
tine's Day last season, falling to unoffi
cial rival UC-Davis at home and to Fres
no State the next day to cap a disap
pointing dual meet season as losers of 11
of its last 12.
A year later, Stanford (8-4, 4-2 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) heads into the final
weekend of the regular season with plen
ty to love about the past month, as well as
its chances at UC-Davis today, at home
against Portland State on Valentine's
night and heyond.
The Cardinal has won five straight
dual meets, dating back to a 31-6 triumph
over Oregon on Jan. 15. The dominating
victory was Stanford's first over the
Ducks since 1995 but the turning point of
the season, according to Cardinal head
coach Steve Buddie, occurred after a 21-
18 home loss to Cal State-Bakersfield
four days earlier.
"[Bakersfield was] 8-0 at that point in
the season," Buddie said. "We had them
dead in the water and let a very good win
slip through our fingers. I knew that
however we responded to that dual meet
would dictate how the rest of our season
would progress. Our recent results have
spoken pretty clearly about the charac
ter of the entire team and how it did re
spond to that difficult loss."
In addition to Oregon, the Cardinal
has chalked up wins against Cal Poly, Cal
State-Fullerton, Oregon State — for the
first time ever —and, most recently.

Fresno State on the road. While a dual
meet win is infinitely better than a loss,
this Stanford squad isn't content with its
recent success.
"I said it when we were losing five in a
row and I'll say it when we're winning
five in a row: These dual meets are just
warm-ups for the real thing," Buddie
said. "Davis is a tough team, but I like
our chances because of the way we've
been wrestling."
The real thing, of course, is the Pac-10
tournament to be held Feb. 29 through
March 1 in Tempe. Ariz. The Cardinal,
which has never placed higher than third
at Pac-lOs, finished ninth last season and
is primed to make a big splash and pro
duce several NCAA qualifiers this year.
While all 10 bouts against the Aggies
are important in terms of seeding for
Pac-lOs, one of the more intriguing
matchups on Friday will pit Stanford ju
nior Matt Gentry, No. 2 in the nation and
undefeated (32-0) this season, against
the reigning conference champion at 157
pounds, UC-Davis senior Jeremiah
Jarvis.
"With the team's success the past
month, we're hoping to get some quality
seeds at the conference tournament,"
Buddie said. "Seeding this year more
than ever may be the key to getting us a
larger number of qualifiers to the NCAA
tournament."
The Aggies (5-6, 2-3) boast the con
ference's top wrestler at 125 pounds, se
nior Tommy Schurkamp, who will
square off against Stanford freshman
Tanner Gardner (20-12). UC-Davis'
Brandon Bear, ranked second in the con
ference at 184, will provide a tough test

for Stanford senior John Garfinkel, who
is 22-14 this season.
Stanford returns home for its final
home meet of the season against Port
land State on Saturday. The Vikings,
which will battle UC-Davis earlier in the
day before making the trip to the Farm,
are 1-11 heading into the weekend. The
Cardinal defeated Portland State last
season, 24-20.

Freshman Devin Mair, No. 8 in the
Pac-10 at 165 pounds, leads the Vikings
with 11 wins. Senior Zac Enoch, the only
Portland State wrestler to win both of his
bouts last weekend, is No. 8 in the Pac-10
at 125 pounds and is 7-8 this season.

Senior Paul Gross and tfie Cardinal squad travel to Davis for the last weekend of regular
season action with hopes to avenge their 2003 loss to the Aggies.
Kharbush — just two of the cogs
in the Cardinal lineup throughout
the season — look to build on
their totals of 23 and 27 wins, re
spectively, by wrestling the same
way they have all season in the
basement of Arrillaga.
"This is a team that doesn't

think about winning or losing any
more," Buddie said. "They do
what we've been asking them to,
which is to go out and wrestle. The
outcome takes care of itself if
you wrestle the way we've been
practicing."
Saturday will mark the final
dual meet for Stanford senior
starters Paul Gross and
Garfinkel. Students can show
their love at Burnham Pavilion
beginning at 7 p.m.
