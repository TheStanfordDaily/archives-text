# There's no place like home: Card faces Kansas
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
There's no place like home
for the No. 4 Cardinal baseball
team (5-1), which will try to add
to its impressive 12-game home
winning streak when it plays
Kansas (7-4-1) at cozy Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
It's not that the road was es
pecially rough on them — the
team took two of three from a
good Fresno State club, pound
ing out 30 hits in the final two
games of the series — but some
tirhes you just want the comfort
of playing in your own place.
"You have your own bed,
the fans cheer you on, your
family's there; it's just more
convenient," sophomore short
stop Jed Lowrie said.
"Teams are normally better
at home," added head coach
Mark Marquess, who was also
quick to point out that Stanford
actually had a better record on
the road last year.
Well, we can at least say this:
Unlike Dorothy, the team is
probably relieved that it does
not have to go to Kansas. In
stead, Kansas is coming to
them. The series, which was
added to the schedule only
after Florida St. cancelled, will
be the first-ever match-up be
tween the two schools.
" They're very good, they're an
improved program," Marquess
said of the Jayhawks' squad.
The same can be said of
Stanford's hitting, which has
gotten better as the season has
progressed. The Cardinal will
try to continue the hit parade it

started in Fresno, in which the
heart of the order —junior
Danny Putnam and sopho
mores Jed Lowrie and John
Mayberry, Jr. — combined for
17 of the team's 30 hits in the
final two games against the
Bulldogs. The trio also added
five home runs and 10 RBI.
Lowrie, hitting .417 and
leading the team with 19 total
bases and 9 RBI, has been the
key to the offense thus far and
one of the biggest surprises of
the season. The 6-foot-0, 180
lb. shortstop did not hit any
home runs in 212 at-bats in his
freshman campaign last season,
but he already has two this
year. Lowrie has more than
doubled his slugging percent
age, which has improved from
.349 to .792.
"[Power] was the one thing I
really needed to work on this
year," Lowrie said. When he re
turned from playing summer
ball with sophomore pitcher
Jeff Gilmore in Alaska, he lift
ed six days a week and added 10
lbs. of muscle.
Lowrie's play has also keyed
a stellar defensive performance
by the Cardinal this year: The
team has not committed any er
rors in its last five games.
"We take a lot of pride in the
defense," Lowrie said. "Coach
[Marquess] really stresses it. It's
second nature to us. and it's a big
part of our game."
Sophomore pitcher Jeff
Gilmore, who will start on Sat
urday, called the defense "one
of the best I've ever thrown in
front of. We have great outfield
speed, great infield defense ...

and we have the best catching
in the country," he added as a
grinning Donny Lucy, the
team's starting catcher, jogged
by.
Gilmore has been an impor
tant ingredient in the success of
the pitching staff, which has
posted a sparkling 3.40 ERA.
He leads the team in innings
pitched with 11, and has al
lowed only two earned runs
and eight hits while striking out
nine. Though Marquess has not
made Gilmore the permanent
Saturday starter — saying only
that he "deserves to go back
out there" after pitching six
solid innings in his last start —
it is clear that if he keeps pitch
ing the way he has been, he will
continue to get more opportu
nities.
Gilmore, who pitched only 2
1/3 innings last year, attributes
his success to improved ball
movement. He also said that
the transition from relieving to
starting has been smooth.
" I feel like I'm just coming in
[during] the sixth inning with the
score tied," Gilmore said of
starting.
Marquess has not yet named
a starter for Sunday, but he did
say that junior Mark Jecmen
and sophomore Matt Manship
were among the possibilities.
Jecmen started the season's
first two Sunday games, and
Manship started the first Satur
day game of the year.
So far, it hasn't seemed to
matter who pitches for the Car
dinal. A number of unheralded

hurlers, like Gilmore and Jecmen,
have pitched surprisingly well when
called upon. No matter who pitches,
the team has been dominant,
outscoring opponents by a mark of

52-21 this year.

Mark Romanczuk and the rest of
the baseball team as they try to give
the Jayhawks a rude awakening
and remind them they're not in
Kansas anymore.
