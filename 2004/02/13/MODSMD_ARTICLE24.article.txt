### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Facing off against No. 38 UNLV
(3-0) on Friday, the top-ranked Stan
ford women's tennis team (6-0) is
fresh off a tournament title and set on
notching a decisive win.
Stanford recovered the lop nation
wide ranking from NCAA Champion
Florida on Tuesday, after claiming a
record seventh title at the USTA /
ITA National Team Indoor Champi
onships last weekend in Madison,
Wise.
The Cardinal is no stranger to
being No. 1. Since 1997, Stanford has
been top-ranked at least once during
each season.
And in six years of playing the
Rebels, Stanford has dropped a total
of just four individual matches.
"Las Vegas isn't the toughest team
we'll play," said Emilia Anderson, a
senior. "[Still], I think it's really im
portant to go into the match with the

attitude that they're a good team. We
have to play tough, not lay back and
think that it's going to be an easy
match."
No. 61 Anderson went undefeated
in the No. 6 singles position at Team
Indoors. Her 4-0 tournament run in
cluded two epic three-setters against
No. 12 UCLA's Laura Gordon and
No. 7 Washington's Mugette Ahn.
No. 20 Lauren Barnikow, a senior,
and No. 84 Theresa Logar, a fresh
man. also went undefeated in the
tournament.
Friday's match marks the second
Cardinal-Rebels showdown of the
season. Their first meeting came in
January, at the Freeman Memorial
Tennis Championships in Las Vegas.
Unranked Cindy Treber, a fresh
man, was the lone Rebel to survive
past opening round play. Stanford's
No. 2 seed, Alice Barnes, promptly
defeated her in the second round, 6-
3, 6-3.
Meanwhile, Logar sailed to final

victory at Freeman to earn her first
individual collegiate title.
In recent years, UNLV has made
strides in improving the caliber of its
team. In the 2001 season, the Rebels
hovered around a modest No. 60 in
the national rankings.
Thanks to aggressive recruiting
procedures and an intensive rebuild
ing period, the Rebels ratcheted up to
a record No. 15 at this time last year.
The Rebels finished out the 2003 sea
son with a 16-6 record, losing in the
first round of the NCAA Champi
onships and dropping to No. 34 in the
final rankings.
Despite its increasing team suc
cess, UNLV still competes in the rel
atively weak Mountain West Confer
ence and has yet to get a single one of
its players individually ranked.

Emilia Anderson this season to form one of Stanford's
crucial doubles teams. The pair is 11 -2 on the year
thus far.
