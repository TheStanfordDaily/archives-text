# No. 3 tennis to meet undefeated Rice
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The season has been good so far to
the Stanford men's tennis team. The
Cardinal owns a 4-1 dual match record,
and the team was just bumped up from
No. 5 to No. 3 in the most recent rank
ings. Now Stanford faces the challenge
of meeting an undefeated squad.
Tomorrow, the team will face off
with Rice at the Taube Tennis Center
at noon. The Owls are a perfect 5-0 this
year, recently pulling in at No. 23 in the
national rankings.
"Anyone in the top 25 is a very
competitive match for us," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould. "The
doubles have been less than sterling for
us, so that's a real challenge. We have a
lot of potential but we're not playing
up to our capability. I expect a very
good match from Rice."
Stanford was boosted in the rank
ings after an impressive showing at the

USTA/ITA National Team Indoor
Championship last weekend. The
team forced its way through to the
semifinal round after defeating No. 13
Texas in the first round and No. 4 Van
derbilt in the second. The Cardinal was
then dismissed by top-ranked Illinois
by a score of 4-2, ending the team's stay
at the tourney.
The Cardinal and the Owls have
not met on the court yet this year, nor
did they meet in competition last year,
leaving tomorrow's match an antici
pated unknown.
"I think playing them on Saturday
is great," said sophomore James Pade.
"We're coming off a tough weekend in
Seattle and we have another challenge
[awaiting us). They're definitely anoth
er team to look forward to playing."
Rice carries two players into the
match who are ranked within the top
25. Sophomore Robert Seale is ranked
No. 15 after pulling a 9-4 fall season
record. Owl senior William Barker will

enter the match at No. 22 and was the
Western Conference player of the
Month in October. His brother, senior
Richard Barker, is ranked No. 67.
In doubles, the Barker brothers are
ranked at No. 3 for the season. They
also happen to be the 2003 national
doubles team of the year and didn't
drop a single match during last year's
season, finishing with a 19-0 dual
match record. They have a 5-0 record
so far this season.
Some Stanford players to look
for are junior Sam Warburg and
freshman James Wan. Both played
impressively at the recent Indoor
championship, posting 3-0 singles
records. Junior Phil Sheng also has a
3-0 singles record in the No. 3 spot
for Stanford.
"I am very excited to play
Rice," Sheng said. "I'm playing re
ally well and I'm looking forward
to Saturday."
"I think that Sam Warburg is get

ting better all the time after being out
with health problems," Gould said.
"Sheng showed me a great deal in his
matches [over the weekend] and came
through with a couple great wins in the
match |against Texas at the Indoor] to
clinch it for us."
The new poll results, which were re
leased on Tuesday, place the Indoor
Champions Illinois at No. 1 again, fol
lowed by UCLA, Stanford, Mississippi
and Baylor. Stanford received 651
votes, closely following UCLA's 665
and the lllini's 675.
Sophomore KC Corkery, War
burg, and Fade ail remain at the same
rankings of No. 43, No. 71, and No. 89,
respectively. The doubles team of
Corkery and Pade is listed at No. 10 in
the preseason poll.
Rice will play No. 11 Cal this after
noon in Berkeley and then travel to
the Farm tomorrow to take on the
Cardinal at noon in the Taube Fami
