## Dartmouth seeks to increase recruitment of minority athletes 
### MARK HERMAN THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER, N.H. — A recent in
ternal study conducted as part of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's re-certification
process revealed that Dartmouth athletic teams
were less than one-third as diverse as the larger
student body.
In strongly worded language, the report rec
ommended that the College work to close the
"significant gap" in minority representation. The
report identified y.K percent of intercollegiate ath
letes as minority students. Although the figure
represents a modest increase since the first
NCAA re-certification process in 1 9%, it is a dis
appointment to administrators whose efforts have
not succeeded in making athletic teams more rep
resentative of the student population, more than
30 percent of which is composed of minorities.
"We as a department have to make more of a
concerted effort to find more diverse student ath
letes," Director of Athletics and Recreation
JoAnn Harper said Monday in an interview with
The Dartmouth.
Dean of the College James Larimore agreed.
"I think it is an important thing for us to take a
look at, to make sure there are not barriers to in
volvement in athletics and barriers to enrollment
at Dartmouth that we ought to pay greater atten
tion to," Larimore said.
According to the report, the lack of minority
representation is being caused in part by the Col
lege's inability to attract recruited minority stu
dent athletes. Over the last eight years, between
17 and 40 recruited minority athletes applied for

admission each year, and in some years, few if any
"priority" minority athletes applied for sports
such as football, basketball and track and field.
One explanation for the recruitment difficul
ties is "the particular combination of sports we
field," Larimore said, citing squash as a sport that
would attract more white students to Dartmouth.
"For example, up until the Tiger Woods phe
nomenon. there were a number of sports like golf
that didn't involve as many students of color as
other sports," Larimore said.
But the obstacles to minority recruitment may
not be limited to athletics.
"The College in and of itself has difficulties at
tracting minority students to the school, let alone
minority students who are also athletes," said
Jaime Velez, Class of 2003, a former member of
the crew team.
Track team members junior Brian Hanley and
freshman lan Marcus, however, did not see a
problem with minority recruitment and represen
tation on their team.
"I don't think we've had problems getting mi
nority recruitment. It usually gives them another
point of access," Marcus said.
Still, they speculated that factors like the cold
weather and lack of athletic scholarships at Dart
mouth might contribute to less diverse teams.
They said, however, that increasing diversity was
less important to them than recruiting competitive
runners.
"We just want the best people we can get,"
Marcus said.
Velez said he had a positive experience as a mi
nority athlete on the traditionally white crew
team.

"I loved my experience rowing, because of
the time 1 spent on the water with my friends,"
Velez said.
Velez added that he was unaware of any inci
dents that have made minority athletes uncom
fortable at Dartmouth.
"I've never heard of stuff that has happened
that has made it difficult for them in their experi
ence," he said.
Administrators fear that a lack of diversity on
sports teams may limit the amount of interaction
athletes have with students from different back
grounds.
"One of the worries is whether student athletes
have the same opportunities as other Dartmouth
students," Larimore said.
Velez agreed that a lack of interracial inter
action is a concern, although he questioned
the difference from other Dartmouth stu
dents' experiences.
"In the sense that usually students who are on
teams hang out with their teammates ... I think
that maybe initially it does have some effect on it
— negatively," Velez said. "Whether or not they
were athletes or just a part of the student body, it
would probably still be the same."
The report also identified a need to increase
minority representation in the coaching staff, es
pecially among football and basketball hires. The
report touts the hiring of African American assis
tant football coach Robert Talley since the Col
lege's last NCAA re-certification, but the basket
ball coaching staff remains entirely white.
"We have to do a better job in having a more
diverse administration and coaching staff," Harp
er said.

admission each year, and in some years, few if any
"priority" minority athletes applied for sports
such as football, basketball and track and field.
One explanation for the recruitment difficul
ties is "the particular combination of sports we
field," Larimore said, citing squash as a sport that
would attract more white students to Dartmouth.
"For example, up until the Tiger Woods phe
nomenon. there were a number of sports like golf
that didn't involve as many students of color as
other sports," Larimore said.
But the obstacles to minority recruitment may
not be limited to athletics.
"The College in and of itself has difficulties at
tracting minority students to the school, let alone
minority students who are also athletes," said
Jaime Velez, Class of 2003, a former member of
the crew team.
Track team members junior Brian Hanley and
freshman lan Marcus, however, did not see a
problem with minority recruitment and represen
tation on their team.
"I don't think we've had problems getting mi
nority recruitment. It usually gives them another
point of access," Marcus said.
Still, they speculated that factors like the cold
weather and lack of athletic scholarships at Dart
mouth might contribute to less diverse teams.
They said, however, that increasing diversity was
less important to them than recruiting competitive
runners.
"We just want the best people we can get,"
Marcus said.
Velez said he had a positive experience as a mi
nority athlete on the traditionally white crew
team.

"I loved my experience rowing, because of
the time 1 spent on the water with my friends,"
Velez said.
Velez added that he was unaware of any inci
dents that have made minority athletes uncom
fortable at Dartmouth.
"I've never heard of stuff that has happened
that has made it difficult for them in their experi
ence," he said.
Administrators fear that a lack of diversity on
sports teams may limit the amount of interaction
athletes have with students from different back
grounds.
"One of the worries is whether student athletes
have the same opportunities as other Dartmouth
students," Larimore said.
Velez agreed that a lack of interracial inter
action is a concern, although he questioned
the difference from other Dartmouth stu
dents' experiences.
"In the sense that usually students who are on
teams hang out with their teammates ... I think
that maybe initially it does have some effect on it
— negatively," Velez said. "Whether or not they
were athletes or just a part of the student body, it
would probably still be the same."
The report also identified a need to increase
minority representation in the coaching staff, es
pecially among football and basketball hires. The
report touts the hiring of African American assis
tant football coach Robert Talley since the Col
lege's last NCAA re-certification, but the basket
ball coaching staff remains entirely white.
"We have to do a better job in having a more
diverse administration and coaching staff," Harp
er said.
