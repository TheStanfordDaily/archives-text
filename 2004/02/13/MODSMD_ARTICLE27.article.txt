(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — What started as
a paper turned into a book.
University of California-Los Angeles graduate
student Marty Cohen had been writing a paper on
primary elections when he and political science pro
fessor John Zaller saw potential fora bigger project.
Their work-in-progress, "Beating Reform: The
Resurgence of Parties in Presidential Nominations
1980-2000," is co-authored by Zaller and Cohen,
along with 1 fans Noel and David Karol.
Noel is a political science graduate student. Karol
is now a political science professor at University of
California-Berkeley.
Political science junkies might be the obvious
reader pool, but the authors hope to direct it to a
broader general public.
The book is explanatory for the most part. People
need to understand what's happening before they de
cide what they think, Karol said.
In the political climate of the Vietnam War, De
mocratic Sen. George McGovern and Congressman
Donald Fraser battled party favoritism in presidential
nominees through commissioning reforms to make
the process more democratic and representative.
The McGovern-Fraser reforms did away with the
strong political party barrier that ensured party fa
vorites would win the presidential nomination.

Such reforms enabled a party outsider by the
name of Jimmy Carter to sweep the lowa primaries
and eventually secure the White House in 1976.
"After Carter, no party outsider ever won the
nomination, though they've come close several
times," Cohen said.
Political parties adapted to a new era and used their
political muscle to ensure that an outsider — anyone
the party didn't support — wouldn't win again.
"We were looking at every election since 1 980.
The candidate who was expected to win was the
front-runner, and did win ... there were no more of
these surprise upsets," Karol said. This year's Demo
cratic primaries confirm the book's argument that
party outsiders don't become presidential nominees.
At first, Democratic presidential hopeful Howard
Dean appeared to contradict the trend. An outsider,
he took a surprising lead in the beginning of the pres
idential nomination race, boasting a large campaign
chest and several endorsements.
"This year, some very strange things have hap
pened. Nothing like what we've predicted is this. The
Internet changed things; it got Dean noticed. The
party had a hard time coordinating someone other
than Dean," Noel said.
Dean didn't have much insider party support in
the beginning, but was able to gain more high-profile
endorsements as it became evident he was a viable
front-runner.
"If you looked in 2003, it was John Kerry, the

establishment guy who totally fits the profile. But
in the way it happened it was totally deviant."
Karol said.
Dean made extensive use of the Internet, mobiliz
ing supporters and funds. Some say Dean's strong
anti-war stance also appeals to Democrats. The other
Democratic hopefuls' weaker stances dispelled a sec
tor of Democratic voters. Dean fit in the slot and mo
bilized that sector.
However. Dean wasn't getting money from normal
party sources. He was getting money from the people
— and that hasn't translated to votes, Cohen said.
When he lost the lowa primary. Dean significant
ly dropped in the polls.
There have been cases where the front-runners
suffered defeats earlier on, but bounced back be
cause insider support cushioned the blow. For in
stance. in 1992 Bill Clinton lost in the New Hamp
shire and lowa primaries and still won the election.
As their book required a great deal of research,
the authors sifted through books, newspaper articles
and archives to examine each campaign.
Collecting and counting endorsements took up a
large part of the research. However, the process was
not wholly quantitative. They found it was the en
dorsee's power that mattered more.
In Dean's case, his endorsements weren't enough
to pull him through his defeats. Political endorse
ments give candidates a network of people to aid
their campaign, not just funds.
