# Cal funds environmental initiative

(U-WIRE) BERKELEY - When University of California-
Berkeley professor Inez Fung examines a satellite image of Earth,
she sees more than five-day forecasts for the Bay Area or individual
nations dealing with an isolated atmospheric phenomenon.
She sees a much bigger picture.
"The atmosphere is a very integrating medium. Whatever hap
pens in one area has a major impact on another," said Fung, director
of the Berkeley Atmospheric Sciences Center.
It is that comprehensive outlook of Earth that compelled Fung to
head The Future of the Planet initiative, an ambitious university ef
fort to integrate academic disciplines for study of the environment.
Everything from the chemistry of carbon dioxide emissions to
the cultural consequences of air pollution fall within the initia
tive's reach.
"We're trying to build this idea that you have to look at the envi
ronment in total," Fung said. "If you're going to study global warm
ing, or any problem for that matter, you can't just treat it as a tech
nological problem. You have to look at the economics, the politics,
the social and cultural aspects involved."
In this way, designers of the initiative say more creative and com
prehensive approaches will better solve environmental problems.
"We're trying to set up a feature on the Berkeley campus where
it will be easy for faculty and students to come together and focus on
specific environmental issues, and perhaps to obtain grants to devel
op research and courses for these issues," said Zack Powell, profes
sor of integrative biology and a member of the committee preparing
a final business plan for the project.
Set for the chancellor's approval in late March, the venture has
attracted more than 100 professors from more than 20 different dis
ciplines.
Although the professors have yet to develop a course curriculum,
they envision a program in which several instructors will teach a
lower-division course to provide a sweeping overview of an envi
ronmental issue.
A lower division course on deforestation in the Amazon rain for
est may include lectures from planetary scientists on the atmospher
ic pollution caused by deforestation.
History, sociology and Portuguese professors might lecture on
the cultural significance of the rain forest.
Even economic experts would join the course to discuss the prof
itability of the international timber trade.
Undergraduates would be able to participate in an environmen
tal honors program, which would offer extra courses to enrich their
curriculum.
"We're going to force humanities students to think about envi
ronmental science," said Daniel Kammen, professor of energy and
society at the Berkeley Energy Resources Group. "We're going to
force science students to think about the political and social sides of
environmental sciences."
However. UC Berkeley trails several leading universities in cre
ating an interdisciplinary institute.
Stanford and Duke universities each recently received grants to
develop integrative environmental programs. Princeton and
Carnegie Mellon universities already have research centers.
Funding for the project will rely heavily on private resources â€”
the initiative was the only one not to receive money for faculty posi
tions.
Initial proposals estimate a $10 million budget per year once the
institute is operational.
"We feel the urgency to integrate," said Fung. "By joining hands
we could do a lot more."
