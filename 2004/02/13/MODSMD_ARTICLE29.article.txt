# Kirchofer's hustle and heart a 'coach's dream'
## STANFORD BASKETBALL 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
When the quirky, Chico-based, roots-rock band the Mother
Hips broke up a year ago, Joe Kirchofer was among the loyal fans
who mourned the group's demise. But he consoled himself with
the knowledge that several members of his favorite band would
continue to record and collaborate after the split.
Last weekend, Kirchofer had the chance to see two of its key
members at a show in San Francisco. Not only that, but he got in
vited backstage by its manager, who had read in an article that
Kirchofer was a fan.
"It was pretty sweet," Kirchofer said. "I hung out with the
band for like 10 minutes."
Fora music aficionado like the Stanford senior forward-cen
ter, it was the kind of experience that could be the highlight of a
weekend. Just not a weekend that also happened to include a
last-second victory over Arizona.
No, Kirchofer didn't hit the game-winning shot. He wasn't
even on the court when Nick Robinson's "Hail Mary" heave
found the net. Robinson, voted ESPN.corn's Big Man On Cam
pus because of his heroics, started ahead of Kirchofer and played
38 minutes to Kirchofer's nine.
That's not the kind of thing Kirchofer worries about.
When Robinson's shot fell through, Kirchofer jumped off the
bench in a display of sheer fist-pumping joy, just as he has
done nearly after virtually every Cardinal big play of the past
five years.
In his first three years on the Stanford bench, Kirchofer was a
sort of mop-topped curiosity. He played sparingly as a freshman
and redshirted as a sophomore, but his exuberance on the side
lines made it look as though he lived and died with the team's for
tunes. He might have been called a benchwarmer, but all the time
he spent on his feet yelling support to his teammates probably
gave his seat ample time to cool off.
Last year, he evolved into a regular contributor, and in the
Cardinal's run to the NCAA Tournament he finally earned a spot
in the starting lineup ... of ESPN's "All-Hair Team," that is.
This season, a more clean-cut Kirchofer has become better
known for his hustle on the court than his appearance on the
sidelines. Against then-No. 1 Kansas in December, he hit all
four of his shots from the field, scoring 10 points in 13 minutes
of play.
"He's had a lot of different roles on the team in his time here,"
said assistant coach Eric Reveno. "He's been a redshirt, and then
he wasn't playing a lot of minutes, to where now he's a critical re
serve for us that has won games for us this year.
"And that's just when he's on the basketball court," Reveno added.
It's off the court that Kirchofer makes the biggest impact. De
scribed by his teammates and coaches as one of the team's emo
tional leaders, he has been integral in establishing the work ethic
and unselfish attitude that characterize this year's Cardinal.
And when he does get in the game, he charges around with so
much energy that one can't tell he's often the slowest man on the
court. He's not particularly agile, either, but that doesn't stop
him from hurtling through the air after loose balls.

Asked how he has earned a reputation for making such "hus
tle plays," Kirchofer flashed his self-deprecating sense of humor.
"I think maybe because I don't do anything else," he said.
"Josh [Childress] can hustle and dive on the floor and then dunk
on people at the other end. 1 stop at diving on the floor."
More seriously, he said he sees giving an unusual amount of ef
fort as his best chance to provide a spark for the team.
"The whole time I've been here that's sort of been my mis
sion coming off the bench," he said. "That kind of play makes
your teammates excited and makes everyone else want to play
hard too."
As much as Kirchofer seems to embody old-fashioned team
spirit, basketball doesn't dominate his life. Besides being an out
standing student — the best on the team, according to some of
his teammates — he plays the harmonica and jokes that he would
like to make a career of it, assuming that professional basketball
doesn't work out.
"If somebody wants to draft me, that's fine, but I'm not hold
ing my breath," he said of his pro prospects.
In truth, professional basketball doesn't seem like it would
suit Kirchofer well. His brand of old-school play has been out of
style in the NBA for decades.
"I hate watching NBA games, because so many times when
you turn on an NBA game, it's the second quarter and no
body cares, they're all just walking around," he said. "Some
body makes a big dunk, but who cares? Nobody was playing
defense anyway."
He contrasted that attitude with the ethic that has driven Stan
ford's success this year.
"When somebody scores on us, even if it's the middle of the
first half, we get mad," he said. "This year has been especially
fun just because we work so hard, we play so hard. There are a
lot of plays when we watch on film when there's like two or
three guys diving for the ball, people are taking charges, stuff
like that. It just makes it a lot more fun when everyone's always
going all out."
Does Kirchofer wish he could get more court time than the 10
or so minutes per game he's averaging this season? Sure.
"It's hard to say I wouldn't want to play more minutes," he
said. "But if I want to play more minutes, that means somebody
else has to play less minutes, and I don't see anybody on the team
that doesn't deserve to play their share of minutes. They're all
working hard."
Thanks, in part, to the example Kirchofer has set. Reveno de
scribed him as "a coach's dream."
"This year in the fall one time I was sitting there in September
doing a playbook, and I couldn't remember where one of our
postmen went on a press-breaker," Reveno recalls. "So I called
Joe. And of course, Joe remembered. I asked him, 'Does the four
or the five come back to the ball here?' He told me, and then he
explained why."
With all the time and energy Kirchofer has put into basketball,
it seems odd to think that next year he might be looking fora gov
ernment job that lets him put his Urban Studies degree to work.
Then again, he might as likely be found at some Mother Hips re
union concert, sitting in on the harmonica.

or so minutes per game he's averaging this season? Sure.
"It's hard to say I wouldn't want to play more minutes," he
said. "But if I want to play more minutes, that means somebody
else has to play less minutes, and I don't see anybody on the team
that doesn't deserve to play their share of minutes. They're all
working hard."
Thanks, in part, to the example Kirchofer has set. Reveno de
scribed him as "a coach's dream."
"This year in the fall one time I was sitting there in September
doing a playbook, and I couldn't remember where one of our
postmen went on a press-breaker," Reveno recalls. "So I called
Joe. And of course, Joe remembered. I asked him, 'Does the four
or the five come back to the ball here?' He told me, and then he
explained why."
With all the time and energy Kirchofer has put into basketball,
it seems odd to think that next year he might be looking fora gov
ernment job that lets him put his Urban Studies degree to work.
Then again, he might as likely be found at some Mother Hips re
union concert, sitting in on the harmonica.

Despite sparse playing time in his freshman campaign and the redshirtyear that
followed, senior Joe Kirchofer has made an impact on the Cardinal off the court.
When the quirky, Chico-based, roots-rock band the Mother
Hips broke up a year ago, Joe Kirchofer was among the loyal fans
who mourned the group's demise. But he consoled himself with
the knowledge that several members of his favorite band would
continue to record and collaborate after the split.
Last weekend, Kirchofer had the chance to see two of its key
members at a show in San Francisco. Not only that, but he got in
vited backstage by its manager, who had read in an article that
Kirchofer was a fan.
"It was pretty sweet," Kirchofer said. "I hung out with the
band for like 10 minutes."
Fora music aficionado like the Stanford senior forward-cen
ter, it was the kind of experience that could be the highlight of a
weekend. Just not a weekend that also happened to include a
last-second victory over Arizona.
No, Kirchofer didn't hit the game-winning shot. He wasn't
even on the court when Nick Robinson's "Hail Mary" heave
found the net. Robinson, voted ESPN.corn's Big Man On Cam
pus because of his heroics, started ahead of Kirchofer and played
38 minutes to Kirchofer's nine.
That's not the kind of thing Kirchofer worries about.
When Robinson's shot fell through, Kirchofer jumped off the
bench in a display of sheer fist-pumping joy, just as he has
done nearly after virtually every Cardinal big play of the past
five years.
In his first three years on the Stanford bench, Kirchofer was a
sort of mop-topped curiosity. He played sparingly as a freshman
and redshirted as a sophomore, but his exuberance on the side
lines made it look as though he lived and died with the team's for
tunes. He might have been called a benchwarmer, but all the time
he spent on his feet yelling support to his teammates probably
gave his seat ample time to cool off.
Last year, he evolved into a regular contributor, and in the
Cardinal's run to the NCAA Tournament he finally earned a spot
in the starting lineup ... of ESPN's "All-Hair Team," that is.
This season, a more clean-cut Kirchofer has become better
known for his hustle on the court than his appearance on the
sidelines. Against then-No. 1 Kansas in December, he hit all
four of his shots from the field, scoring 10 points in 13 minutes
of play.
"He's had a lot of different roles on the team in his time here,"
said assistant coach Eric Reveno. "He's been a redshirt, and then
he wasn't playing a lot of minutes, to where now he's a critical re
serve for us that has won games for us this year.
"And that's just when he's on the basketball court," Reveno added.
It's off the court that Kirchofer makes the biggest impact. De
scribed by his teammates and coaches as one of the team's emo
tional leaders, he has been integral in establishing the work ethic
and unselfish attitude that characterize this year's Cardinal.
And when he does get in the game, he charges around with so
much energy that one can't tell he's often the slowest man on the
court. He's not particularly agile, either, but that doesn't stop
him from hurtling through the air after loose balls.

Asked how he has earned a reputation for making such "hus
tle plays," Kirchofer flashed his self-deprecating sense of humor.
"I think maybe because I don't do anything else," he said.
"Josh [Childress] can hustle and dive on the floor and then dunk
on people at the other end. 1 stop at diving on the floor."
More seriously, he said he sees giving an unusual amount of ef
fort as his best chance to provide a spark for the team.
"The whole time I've been here that's sort of been my mis
sion coming off the bench," he said. "That kind of play makes
your teammates excited and makes everyone else want to play
hard too."
As much as Kirchofer seems to embody old-fashioned team
spirit, basketball doesn't dominate his life. Besides being an out
standing student — the best on the team, according to some of
his teammates — he plays the harmonica and jokes that he would
like to make a career of it, assuming that professional basketball
doesn't work out.
"If somebody wants to draft me, that's fine, but I'm not hold
ing my breath," he said of his pro prospects.
In truth, professional basketball doesn't seem like it would
suit Kirchofer well. His brand of old-school play has been out of
style in the NBA for decades.
"I hate watching NBA games, because so many times when
you turn on an NBA game, it's the second quarter and no
body cares, they're all just walking around," he said. "Some
body makes a big dunk, but who cares? Nobody was playing
defense anyway."
He contrasted that attitude with the ethic that has driven Stan
ford's success this year.
"When somebody scores on us, even if it's the middle of the
first half, we get mad," he said. "This year has been especially
fun just because we work so hard, we play so hard. There are a
lot of plays when we watch on film when there's like two or
three guys diving for the ball, people are taking charges, stuff
like that. It just makes it a lot more fun when everyone's always
going all out."
Does Kirchofer wish he could get more court time than the 10
or so minutes per game he's averaging this season? Sure.
"It's hard to say I wouldn't want to play more minutes," he
said. "But if I want to play more minutes, that means somebody
else has to play less minutes, and I don't see anybody on the team
