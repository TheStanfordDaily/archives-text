# With knee injuries behind her, Borchardt focuses on the future
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Susan King Borchardt is no stranger
to disappointment.
More importantly, she's no stranger
to perseverance and success either.
After missing her first two seasons
on the Farm due to recurring knee in
juries, Borchardt worked her way back
into the Cardinal lineup as its starting
point guard and has been there ever
since. Her leadership and resolve have
been invaluable to the No. 11 women's
basketball team (17-5, 10-3 Pacific 10
Conference) throughout this year and
will play an increasingly important role
as the season carries on.
"I feel very fortunate to be playing
again," Borchardt said. "I know I can't
take anything for granted and I'm
happy to be playing for this team."
The team has suffered some serious
setbacks in the last few weeks, losing its
last three games on the road, including
both games in Arizona last weekend.
"Right now we're at a crossroads,"
Borchardt said. "We need to decide
how we're going to approach this and
put last weekend behind us and move
on from there."
The Cardinal will have its first
chance to do so against California here
at home tomorrow. The Bears (9-13, 2-
11 Pac-10) dropped its first contest to
Stanford earlier this season, but can
usually be counted upon to bring its
"A" game to play at Maples.
For its part, Stanford will be looking
to recover from what head coach Tara
VanDerveer called "an absolute melt
down" against Arizona State last Satur
day. The Cardinal blew a first-half lead
as the Sun Devils completely outper
formed the Stanford women, leaving
the team looking overwhelmed and a
bit shocked.
"We kind of have a target on our
backs and we need to be ready to step
up and handle the pressure," Borchardt
said. "Right now we're trying to keep it
in the short-term. Our coaches chal
lenge us to keep it in the present."
That present includes playing with
more aggression — getting tough
boards, pressuring the ball and not
being afraid to take shots.
As Stanford's point guard and one of
the team's captains, Borchardt is
charged with the task of keeping the
game under control and pushing her
teammates to do their best.
"1 try to set a good example and play
hard," Borchardt said. "As a point
guard, my role is to get everybody play
ing, be vocal, and be a good leader."
Borchardt's experience will be
come increasingly important as Stan

ford attempts to generate a variety of
offensive threats both down low and
downtown.
In fact, Stanford's backcourt is often
lethal, with Borchardt contributing in a
big way. One of the leading scorers on
the team, Borchardt is second in 3-
point percentage for the Cardinal,
making 34-of-70. The sharpshooter
scored 19 points in the team's last meet
ing with Cal, including a perfect three
for-three from behind the arc. Bor
chardt's consistent numbers have often
helped balance some of the team's less
consistent offensive patterns.
While Borchardt recognizes the im
portance of her offensive contribu
tions, she also realizes the impact she
can make defensively.
"They keep encouraging me to be
aggressive offensively and put more
pressure on the ball," Borchardt said.
"I want to keep being one of the leaders
on the floor and keep everyone on the
same page."
Borchardt's calm leadership has
only increased since last season, possi
bly influenced in part by the changes in
her personal life.
Borchardt married former Stanford
star and current Utah Jazz center, Cur
tis Borchardt, this past summer.
As the only married member of the
women's team, Borchardt admits that it
puts her in a slightly different place.
"Being married means that I am at a
different stage of my life and possibly
more mature," Borchardt said. "My
wedding was amazing, and it's nice to
have the planning for it behind me. I
feel more settled right now, and I'm
concentrating on basketball.
"And I get great support from my hus
band, and that can only be a positive thing."
Borchardt's poise will be vital as the
Cardinal pushes forward. While keep
ing things in perspective and focusing
on some immediate goals, the team has
the depth and experience to merge the
present and future goals.
"Our main goal right now is the
game against Cal," Borchardt said,
"But we also want to defend our Pac-10
title and take it far in the tournament.
We need to play hard to do that."
Borchardt's own future goals are a
little less clear.
While the redshirt junior could re
turn again next year, Borchardt's not
ready to look that far ahead yet.
"We have a lot of games left and I'm
trying to stay in the present. There's
time after the season to figure out my
options and see what I want to do,"
Borchardt said.
Whatever that decision may be, this
Cardinal squad is lucky to have Bor
chardt calling the shots.

options and see what I want to do,"
Borchardt said.
Whatever that decision may be, this
Cardinal squad is lucky to have Bor
chardt calling the shots.

Redshirt junior Susan Borchardt is now calling the shots for Stanford at point
guard after a two-year absence due to injury.
Susan King Borchardt is no stranger
to disappointment.
More importantly, she's no stranger
to perseverance and success either.
After missing her first two seasons
on the Farm due to recurring knee in
juries, Borchardt worked her way back
into the Cardinal lineup as its starting
point guard and has been there ever
since. Her leadership and resolve have
been invaluable to the No. 11 women's
basketball team (17-5, 10-3 Pacific 10
Conference) throughout this year and
will play an increasingly important role
as the season carries on.
"I feel very fortunate to be playing
again," Borchardt said. "I know I can't
take anything for granted and I'm
happy to be playing for this team."
The team has suffered some serious
setbacks in the last few weeks, losing its
last three games on the road, including
both games in Arizona last weekend.
"Right now we're at a crossroads,"
Borchardt said. "We need to decide
how we're going to approach this and
put last weekend behind us and move
on from there."
The Cardinal will have its first
chance to do so against California here
at home tomorrow. The Bears (9-13, 2-
11 Pac-10) dropped its first contest to
Stanford earlier this season, but can
usually be counted upon to bring its
"A" game to play at Maples.
For its part, Stanford will be looking
to recover from what head coach Tara
VanDerveer called "an absolute melt
down" against Arizona State last Satur
day. The Cardinal blew a first-half lead
as the Sun Devils completely outper
formed the Stanford women, leaving
the team looking overwhelmed and a
bit shocked.
"We kind of have a target on our
backs and we need to be ready to step
up and handle the pressure," Borchardt
said. "Right now we're trying to keep it
in the short-term. Our coaches chal
lenge us to keep it in the present."
That present includes playing with
more aggression — getting tough
boards, pressuring the ball and not
being afraid to take shots.
As Stanford's point guard and one of
the team's captains, Borchardt is
charged with the task of keeping the
game under control and pushing her
teammates to do their best.
"1 try to set a good example and play
hard," Borchardt said. "As a point
guard, my role is to get everybody play
ing, be vocal, and be a good leader."
Borchardt's experience will be
come increasingly important as Stan

ford attempts to generate a variety of
offensive threats both down low and
downtown.
In fact, Stanford's backcourt is often
lethal, with Borchardt contributing in a
big way. One of the leading scorers on
the team, Borchardt is second in 3-
point percentage for the Cardinal,
making 34-of-70. The sharpshooter
scored 19 points in the team's last meet
ing with Cal, including a perfect three
for-three from behind the arc. Bor
chardt's consistent numbers have often
helped balance some of the team's less
consistent offensive patterns.
While Borchardt recognizes the im
portance of her offensive contribu
tions, she also realizes the impact she
can make defensively.
"They keep encouraging me to be
aggressive offensively and put more
pressure on the ball," Borchardt said.
"I want to keep being one of the leaders
on the floor and keep everyone on the
same page."
Borchardt's calm leadership has
only increased since last season, possi
bly influenced in part by the changes in
her personal life.
Borchardt married former Stanford
star and current Utah Jazz center, Cur
tis Borchardt, this past summer.
As the only married member of the
women's team, Borchardt admits that it
puts her in a slightly different place.
"Being married means that I am at a
different stage of my life and possibly
more mature," Borchardt said. "My
wedding was amazing, and it's nice to
have the planning for it behind me. I
feel more settled right now, and I'm
concentrating on basketball.
"And I get great support from my hus
band, and that can only be a positive thing."
Borchardt's poise will be vital as the
Cardinal pushes forward. While keep
ing things in perspective and focusing
on some immediate goals, the team has
the depth and experience to merge the
present and future goals.
"Our main goal right now is the
game against Cal," Borchardt said,
"But we also want to defend our Pac-10
title and take it far in the tournament.
We need to play hard to do that."
Borchardt's own future goals are a
little less clear.
While the redshirt junior could re
turn again next year, Borchardt's not
ready to look that far ahead yet.
"We have a lot of games left and I'm
trying to stay in the present. There's
time after the season to figure out my
options and see what I want to do,"
Borchardt said.
