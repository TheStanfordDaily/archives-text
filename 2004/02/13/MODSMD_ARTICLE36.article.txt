### TAM VO BARRETT SHERIDAN INTERMISSION VIRGINS 
Welcome to Intermission volume
I HI R.
First, we want to let you know that
we're here for you. We'll take risks for
you.
Case in point: Last Saturday night,
in order to get the scoop, we endured
the aural and visual pain of a musical
group called Trawnay Hoof. Clad in
knee-high socks, pink Pumas, se
quined shirts and leopard-print
Speedos, the duo thrust and gyrated
to classics like "Gut the Police" and
"We I .ike to Fuck."
After several close encounters
with the lead singer's feline-decorat
ed package, Barrett suffered true
shock and awe when the male group
member planted a big, sloppy, wet
one on him.
And yes, we are talking about a
kiss, you sickos.
Tam was nearly decapitated when

the female member, midriff Happing
like a jelly roll, almost cartwheeled
into her face.
All this just to see Mates of State
play at Bottom of the Hill. For you,
dear readers.
That's right: We're selfless, among
other things (humble not being one of
them). And, our milkshake brings all

the boys to the
yard. Damn right,
it's better than
yours.
We're here to
pose, and then an
swer, all those
pressing questions
that you have.
Like, for instance,
what CANT you
deep-fry? If the
world depended
on Paris Hilton
naming the vice
president, would
tomorrow exist?
What is the corn-

pound responsible for people dress
ing like hipsters? II freedom fries and

French fries fought,
who would win? If
Princess Leia had a vi
brator, what would it
look like?
So, if you like jour
nalistic ethics and
quality reporting,
look elsewhere (but
not to Fox News).
We're not here to be
your bitches. We're
here for sleaze, gos
sip, trash and scandal
(aka entertainment
journalism).
And remember: No
panties with jeans? So
necessary.
Amen.


Itarrett Winston Sheridan, left, and Tamatha Puxatawny
Vo, Car riyhl, hang with Mates of State.


The wide, rolling flab of the Hawnay Troofs j»ar}»an
tuan ass. Lament the leopard.
