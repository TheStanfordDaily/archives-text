# In a 'Fog,’ McNamara loses morals, pants

### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
"The Fog of War" — filmmaker Errol Morris' profile
of former US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara —
is full of haunting urgency and a sad resonance with the
present. It's skillfully made, combining archival footage
and clips from more than 20 hours of interviews with Mc-
Namara into a compelling hour and a half. In fact, the
skill is so great that it becomes easy to forget what an odd
film you're watching.
McNamara, after all, has already published a memoir
— "In Retrospect" — so he's had a chance to say what
he wanted to say about his experiences in World War II
and the Vietnam War. Then what's the point of this film?
It certainly isn't to present a balanced, authoritative bi
ography of the man; it's just McNamara, talking and talk
ing, with his thoughts often illustrated by Morris' visuals.
Ultimately, "The Fog of War" may be most spiritual
ly akin to autobiographies "as told to" professional
writers — a la "The Autobiography of Malcolm X."
Sure, there may be some selectiveness, rearranging and
rewriting on Morris' part, but the film is McNamara's
from beginning to end — his story, his version of histo
ry. Of course, Morris' past films, particularly "The Thin
Blue Line," have always embraced subjectivity and un
certainty, so the difficulty in pinning down "The Fog of
War" comes as no surprise.
The real surprise is how compelling the film is, given
that it's essentially an hour and a half of an octogenarian
talking about history that's 30 years old and more. The
combination of McNamara's words and Morris' images
bring the past to life with extraordinary immediacy. Mc-
Namara is an energetic, articulate speaker who has clear
ly had plenty of time to ruminate on some of the most de
structive and pivotal events of the 20th century and his
role in them.
Oddly enough, McNamara shows more willingness to
criticize the attacks that he orchestrated in World War II
than the Vietnam War. He describes firebombing

dozens of Japanese towns, listing off the casual
ties for city after city, while Morris shows us
numbers falling from the sky. Later, McNamara
admits that he and other officers were "behav
ing like war criminals." *
Nothing so damning comes up in his discus
sion of Vietnam, which he seems to view as more
of a tactical error than a moral one. McNamara
describes arguing with Kennedy and Johnson,
telling them that the war might be too costly and
too difficult to win — recordings of White House
conversations support McNamara's account of
events, contrasting nicely with news footage of a
smiling McNamara telling reporters that every
thing is A-OK — but when Vietnam's former for
eign minister tells McNamara that the Viet
namese viewed the Americans as an imperialist
invaders, the accusation seems to come as a
shock. McNamara shows the most emotion,
however, when he describes Kennedy's assassina
tion — tears start welling up in his eyes and he
can barely speak.
This love for and loyalty to Kennedy may ex
plain McNamara's reticence to discuss Vietnam,
which you'd think would be the heart of the film.
Also at fault may be Morris' apparent unwilling
ness to truly engage and challenge McNamara in
the interviews; McNamara guides and controls
the conversation.
But while it's easy to nitpick the film — to
point out, for example, how its relatively short
running time and impossibly complex topic
make fora slightly superficial and rushed feeling
— it's also a little foolhardy. In"The Fog of
War," the viewer gets to witness a once-powerful
government figure struggle with the meaning
and morality of his life, and it's heady, thought
provoking stuff. While I might wish that more of
my questions were answered, 1 also admire Mc-
Namara's bravery in even asking them.


No, he's not the old guy down the street with candy and a widowless van —
he's former Sec. of Defense Robert McNamara, silly.
