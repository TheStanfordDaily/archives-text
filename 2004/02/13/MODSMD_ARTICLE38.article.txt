# Strangely proportioned characters like bikes and frogs

### MEENAL KUMAR 
A movie made today is like a badly baked souffle.
Don't get me wrong, the creators put in all the effort —
they painstakingly follow the formula (sex, explosions,
car chases, crime, exotic locales, special effects, a lit
tle emotion or maybe just lust), and then lovingly
pour in dollars and dollar-making talent into the mix.
The outer appearance is quite tantalizing — so we
go, get our popcorn, fight fora decent seat and get
ready fora good satisfying meal. But half an hour
later, it falls flat on your plate. And then you're still
hungry. It just seems that good cooking is not just
about following a recipe — otherwise we'd all be do
mestic goddesses. Substantial satisfaction is often
less about imported cheeses and cars, and more
about soul.
Of course, the imported cheese is still a factor ..
. "The Triplets of Belleville" has, I promise you,
one of the coolest car chase scenes I've seen in a
long, long time. In fact, it has all the right ingredi
ents ... there's a feisty woman who will do anything
for the happiness of her grandson, even go on

transatlantic journeys on a paddleboat. There's a boy whose
only happiness is in bicycling. There's a dog named Bruno
with a personal vendetta against trains. "The Triplets of
Belleville" has three quirky cabaret singers. It's even got the
emotional glory of the Tour de France. There's a group of

bloodthirsty mafiosos and a brutal crime caper. It has name
less (literally), boxy henchmen holding wrenches. It is about
an amazing group of old ladies taking on the entire world. It
is social commentary, a clever look at New York and Paris. It
has very little dialogue (which mostly went over the head of
this uncultured reviewer). But most importantly, it has soul.

What makes "The Triplets of
Belleville" truly delicious is how it tran
scends its ingredients to be something
more — magic. Writer, director, genius
Sylvain Chomet transports the audience
hack to the days of yore — to the sophis
tifunk that is the humor of Tin Tin, As
terix and Obelix and the wordless en
chantment of the silent era. This film is
very different from the type of animation
that is seen these days — this isn't the
candied fantasies of Walt Disney or the
stylistic soap operas of Anime. What
took my breath away was how powerfully
a few well-etched lines can portray the
anguish of life.
With no distractions such as Tom
Cruise's perfectly coiffed hair, some star
let's cleavage or fluffy dialogue punctuat
ed by explosions, all there is to see is a
sharp and witty rendering of reality. The
film is heartbreakingly fujjny, a style of so-

phisticated humor that stems from how
painfully and pointedly accurate it is, and yes, cracks you up.
Now that's good cooking.
"Triplets of Belleville " is currently playing at Aquarius Theater.


Can you guess, by the characters' average weight, what country this scene takes place in?
