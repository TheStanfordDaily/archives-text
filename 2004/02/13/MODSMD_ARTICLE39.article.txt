# Music news from the Chick on Speed
## Are The Yeah Yeah Yeahs over? 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I woke up this
morning with the
biggest Strokes hang
over, my head pound
ing rhythmically when
ever I look into the
light,thelight, the
light,thelightlightlight
lightlight!
AAIEEIEEIEHH!!!

I just can't shake these New York
City bitches. My worst overindulgences? The
Walkmen, Interpol, The Liars, The French
Kicks and The Stroke's very own favorite lit
tle band that could, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
I missed the now-famous live madness of
The YYYs when the Brooklyn-based trio
visited the Fillmore last September (stupid
Oxford), so I'm dying to see their reprisal
next month. And, to be honest, it's not a mo
ment too soon. In a notoriously fickle indus
try, The YYYs' sensational, antic-filled suc
cess invites the backlash along with the ex
citement; meanwhile, the clock goes ticktick
tickticktick.
What was life like before Karen O? It
must have been an empty, soulless era — a
time when lead singers didn't roll around on
stage covered in honey; when duct-taped nip
ples couldn't double as eveningwear; when
shrieking wasn't vocal abortion; and when
pansexuality was reserved for Peaches and
Smurfs.
But acts that thrive on novelty, even when
backed by real talent, are especially suscepti
ble to overexposure-related death. Because
really, how many goony fans in bad vintage t
shirts can one band take?
I guess I'll discover the equilibrium myself

soon enough ... Until then, as a preventative
measure, I'm rotating The YYYs' "Fever to
Tell" with fellow members Nick Zinner and
Brian Chase's side project: the EP, "Young
Liars," by TV on the Radio. Their first full
length album is slated for release next month.
Joining The Walknien's recent sopho
more album, The Liars follow-up will be on
store shelves Tuesday. Long live those NYC
bitches.
Do you know what's great about Valen
tine's Day? Valentine's Day Playlists!
Songs for friends and lovers:
"Maps" — The Yeah Yeah Yeahs
For three-minutes and 39 seconds, all my
doubts about The YYYs staying power is
erased by this song's perfection. It doesn't
matter how many times MTV loops the
video, it is not capable of being played-out.
Classic.
"Awesome Pride" — Mink Lungs
Here's something to tell the boyfriend:
"You're the hottest thing, since 1 used my
fingerrrr."
"I Need Your Love" — The Rapture
When Luke Jenner goes to the trouble of
pronouncing all six 'O's in
"LOOOOOOVE," you can't help but be
lieve him.
"Back It lip, Boys" — Peaches
Not ready for more teaches? Too bad, cos
Peaches don't give a fuck. Her latest asks,
"Don't you know it's supposed to feel better
for boys?"
"Sine Love" — Trademark
A love song even math majors (why?) will
love — Oxford electro-scientists, Trade
mark, compares true love to a

perfect sine wave.
And of course Valentine's
Day wouldn't be complete with
out an anti-Valentine's Day
playlist. Single people deserve
good music too.
Songs for friends who'd like to
be lovers, but failing this, decide
to be bitter and angry instead:
"I Don't Love Anyone" —
Belle and Sebastian
"A Good Man is Easy to Kill"
— Reulah
"We Used to be Friends" —
Dandy Warhols
"Hitched" — The Kills
"Love is Like a Drug" —The
Von Bondies
