# Intermission interviews a Walkman
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Walkmen is a five
member garage rock band
from New York City. But be
fore you dismiss them as anoth
er post-Stroke phenomenon,
give their 2002 debut, "Every
one Who Pretended to Like
Me is Gone" a spin and try, just
try, to be unmoved by lead
singer Hamilton Leithauser's
hypnotizing vocals on "We've
Been Had," the band's break
out single.
Besides, the guys are all
from Washington D.C., not
Brooklyn. Now on a nation
wide tour to promote their new
CD, "Bows and Arrows," The
Walkmen will stop by The
Edge nightclub in Palo Alto
Monday night. They'll also be
playing at Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco
this Sunday.
I got a chance to discuss the
album, the United Kingdom
and The Walkmen song written
about Stanford students with
Leithauser last week.

INTERMISSION: Just how
traumatic was making the
dreaded Sophomore Follow-
Up? Did you get panic attacks,
wake up in a cold sweat, that
kind of thing?
HAMILTON LEITHAUSER:
When we were recording ("The
Rat") for the sixth time, and
each one of us realized how
much money and time we'd
wasted on it, and then compared
that amount to the actual
amount of money in his bank ac
count ... It started causing a lit
tle anxiety.
INT: When we interviewed you
last April, you were still work
ing on "Bows and Arrows" and
said you were aiming fora
more "live versus recorded"
sound. Why was that so impor
tant to you?
HL: 1 think we all figured
we'd started to spend too
much time recording each
song at the end of the last
record. We had our own stu
dio for the first time so we

weren't paying by the hour,
and we ended up re-doing all
these songs that didn't even
make it onto the record . . .
Not to mention that they were
absolute pieces of shit.
Somewhere down the line
we lost a little spontaneity. So
this time we tried to start out on
the opposite foot ... I'd just
read "Shakey," the Neil Young
biography, so 1 wanted to copy
him the whole time.
INT: Do you still record in the
same Manhattan studio where
you made the debut?
HL: We tried leaving ... We
went to Memphis and Oxford,
Miss. — both of which worked
out great. We did most of the
basic tracks there, but in the
end we came back to our studio
for some overdubs and some
vocals and a bunch of mixes.
We just wanted to have that
same control again at our
place. The only song fully
recorded at our studio is the
first song on the record
("What's in it for Me").

INT: You play some really
weird instruments on your
tracks — organ piano, old
fashioned saw, and I'm still
trying to figure out what an
"electric whip" is from your
last CD. So, yeah... What the
hell is that?
ML: A11... We made that up.
There's no electric whip.
INT: Oh. How anti-climactic.
Well, did you use any new in
struments on "Bows and Ar
rows," imaginary or otherwise'?
IIL: Yeah... 1 think we listed
our no-name piece-of-shit
guitar amp as like, a "tape
loop machine." It's the kind
of humor that just doesn't
pan out. This time we put a
credit for "Burt Murphy:
Electric Earthhorn," but
then the new record compa
ny was going to deduct all
these union fees for Burt
Murphy's performance so we
took the credit off.
Actually, it's funny —
when Walt told our friend An
drew, who was doing the
album art, that we needed to
lose the Burt Murphy credit,
he asked, in all sincerity,
"Well does Burt know that
you're taking his name off?"
INT: "The Rat" is a harder
rock song than your fans
would expect from you. Why
did you choose to go with this
one first? Was it a conscious
move on your part to diversi
fy from the piano-backed
shimmeriness of "We've
Been Had?"
HL: We just wrote that song
right after we finished the last
record. It took about five
minutes... That's why I think
it came out well. I think we
wrote it because Matt was
playing that beat as a joke,
and it just had some juice to
it. Everyone just decided to
try and kick ass at the same
time, and that's what it
sounded like.
INT: My favorite line is at the
end: "When I used to go out /
I'd know everyone I saw I
Now I go out alone I If I go
out at all." It's clearly about
social life at Stanford.
But what's the rest of
song about? "Can't you see
me / Pounding on your
door" — Someone owes you
money, right?
ML: Yeah — $40 from my
friend Mike on a bet about a
TV commercial. He still owes

me ... The song's not about
anyone I know though . . .
Wait... Actually, it IS about
Stanford students.
INT: HA! Knew it. I see you'll
be visiting my hometown,
Sacramento, right before you
get to the Bay Area. Let me
tell you: Sac Town is one non
stop party. Especially at
Kings games. Also, the Rail
road Museum is nice.
HL: Last time we were in Sac-
Town we hit some disco until
it was a bright sunny day out
side. It's a hell of a town.
There was a nice pool at the
hotel... and that is about as
interesting an impression of a
city anyone can get on tour.
Oh, there was a Denny's too.
Paul and Pete would sell
their children for Kings tickets.
INT: I was studying in Ox
ford a few months ago and
noticed your U.K. tour
schedule. How did you get on
with the Brits?
HL: Well, glad that you
asked. Collectively, we disap
prove of the country. It origi
nates with a dislike of their
entire perception of music as
a whole. This is just a head-on
collision. They cannot help
but intellectualize anything
over there, and so they end up
with nothing.

INT: There's absolutely noth
ing edible in the U.K. Every
thing you've heard it true —
it really is that bad.
HL: It moves to food, which
just does not keep you going
while you drag a rented dou
ble-weighted, double-priced
English Fender Twin through
an 80-foot mud puddle in
Sheffield.
Then when you are just
absolutely broke, the only
thing available to recharge
the old batteries is another
warm, flat pint of egg-yolk
yellow-orange beer and a
green and white ham sand
wich for about $19. Then it
moves through painting, phi
losophy, the overwhelming
abundance of just terrible
pornographic magazines . . .
whole rainbow.
It's just an ignorant theory
1 choose to keep believing. 1
could talk about it all night!
There is a light to the north
though: Scotland.
INT: Are you excited about
being a guest on all the late
night TV shows this week? Or
does it make you want to
throw up?
HL: Yes and yes. I was
hurting before we played
on Conan. I think I will
have a heart attack before
Letterman.

member garage rock band
from New York City. But be
fore you dismiss them as anoth
er post-Stroke phenomenon,
give their 2002 debut, "Every
one Who Pretended to Like
Me is Gone" a spin and try, just
try, to be unmoved by lead
singer Hamilton Leithauser's
hypnotizing vocals on "We've
Been Had," the band's break
out single.
Besides, the guys are all
from Washington D.C., not
Brooklyn. Now on a nation
wide tour to promote their new
CD, "Bows and Arrows," The
Walkmen will stop by The
Edge nightclub in Palo Alto
Monday night. They'll also be
playing at Great American
Music Hall in San Francisco
this Sunday.
I got a chance to discuss the
album, the United Kingdom
and The Walkmen song written
about Stanford students with
Leithauser last week.

INTERMISSION: Just how
traumatic was making the
dreaded Sophomore Follow-
Up? Did you get panic attacks,
wake up in a cold sweat, that
kind of thing?
HAMILTON LEITHAUSER:
When we were recording ("The
Rat") for the sixth time, and
each one of us realized how
much money and time we'd
wasted on it, and then compared
that amount to the actual
amount of money in his bank ac
count ... It started causing a lit
tle anxiety.
INT: When we interviewed you
last April, you were still work
ing on "Bows and Arrows" and
said you were aiming fora
more "live versus recorded"
sound. Why was that so impor
tant to you?
HL: 1 think we all figured
we'd started to spend too
much time recording each
song at the end of the last
record. We had our own stu
dio for the first time so we

weren't paying by the hour,
and we ended up re-doing all
these songs that didn't even
make it onto the record . . .
Not to mention that they were
absolute pieces of shit.
Somewhere down the line
we lost a little spontaneity. So
this time we tried to start out on
the opposite foot ... I'd just
read "Shakey," the Neil Young
biography, so 1 wanted to copy
him the whole time.
INT: Do you still record in the
same Manhattan studio where
you made the debut?
HL: We tried leaving ... We
went to Memphis and Oxford,
Miss. — both of which worked
out great. We did most of the
basic tracks there, but in the
end we came back to our studio
for some overdubs and some
vocals and a bunch of mixes.
We just wanted to have that
same control again at our
place. The only song fully
recorded at our studio is the
first song on the record
("What's in it for Me").

INT: You play some really
weird instruments on your
tracks — organ piano, old
fashioned saw, and I'm still
trying to figure out what an
"electric whip" is from your
last CD. So, yeah... What the
hell is that?
ML: A11... We made that up.
There's no electric whip.
INT: Oh. How anti-climactic.
Well, did you use any new in
struments on "Bows and Ar
rows," imaginary or otherwise'?
IIL: Yeah... 1 think we listed
our no-name piece-of-shit
guitar amp as like, a "tape
loop machine." It's the kind
of humor that just doesn't
pan out. This time we put a
credit for "Burt Murphy:
Electric Earthhorn," but
then the new record compa
ny was going to deduct all
these union fees for Burt
Murphy's performance so we
took the credit off.
Actually, it's funny —
when Walt told our friend An
drew, who was doing the
album art, that we needed to
lose the Burt Murphy credit,
he asked, in all sincerity,
"Well does Burt know that
you're taking his name off?"
INT: "The Rat" is a harder
rock song than your fans
would expect from you. Why
did you choose to go with this
one first? Was it a conscious
move on your part to diversi
fy from the piano-backed
shimmeriness of "We've
Been Had?"
HL: We just wrote that song
right after we finished the last
record. It took about five
minutes... That's why I think
it came out well. I think we
wrote it because Matt was
playing that beat as a joke,
and it just had some juice to
it. Everyone just decided to
try and kick ass at the same
time, and that's what it
sounded like.
INT: My favorite line is at the
end: "When I used to go out /
I'd know everyone I saw I
Now I go out alone I If I go
out at all." It's clearly about
social life at Stanford.
But what's the rest of
song about? "Can't you see
me / Pounding on your
door" — Someone owes you
money, right?
ML: Yeah — $40 from my
friend Mike on a bet about a
TV commercial. He still owes

me ... The song's not about
anyone I know though . . .
Wait... Actually, it IS about
Stanford students.
INT: HA! Knew it. I see you'll
be visiting my hometown,
Sacramento, right before you
get to the Bay Area. Let me
tell you: Sac Town is one non
stop party. Especially at
Kings games. Also, the Rail
road Museum is nice.
HL: Last time we were in Sac-
Town we hit some disco until
it was a bright sunny day out
side. It's a hell of a town.
There was a nice pool at the
hotel... and that is about as
interesting an impression of a
city anyone can get on tour.
Oh, there was a Denny's too.
Paul and Pete would sell
their children for Kings tickets.
INT: I was studying in Ox
ford a few months ago and
noticed your U.K. tour
schedule. How did you get on
with the Brits?
HL: Well, glad that you
asked. Collectively, we disap
prove of the country. It origi
nates with a dislike of their
entire perception of music as
a whole. This is just a head-on
collision. They cannot help
but intellectualize anything
over there, and so they end up
with nothing.

INT: There's absolutely noth
ing edible in the U.K. Every
thing you've heard it true —
it really is that bad.
HL: It moves to food, which
just does not keep you going
while you drag a rented dou
ble-weighted, double-priced
English Fender Twin through
an 80-foot mud puddle in
Sheffield.
Then when you are just
absolutely broke, the only
thing available to recharge
the old batteries is another
warm, flat pint of egg-yolk
yellow-orange beer and a
green and white ham sand
wich for about $19. Then it
moves through painting, phi
losophy, the overwhelming
abundance of just terrible
pornographic magazines . . .
whole rainbow.
It's just an ignorant theory
1 choose to keep believing. 1
could talk about it all night!
There is a light to the north
though: Scotland.
INT: Are you excited about
being a guest on all the late
night TV shows this week? Or
does it make you want to
throw up?
HL: Yes and yes. I was
hurting before we played
on Conan. I think I will
have a heart attack before
Letterman.
