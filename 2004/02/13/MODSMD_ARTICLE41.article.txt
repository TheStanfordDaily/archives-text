# With 'Bows and Arrows,' The Walkmen could be YOUR Cupid
## 
### KARAN MAHAJAN DESK EDITOR 
Here's a quote for all you cheeseballs:
Bands lie, their music doesn't.
So, when vocalist Hamilton Leithauser of
The Walkmen promised — in vague and un
certain terms — that their next album would
capture their "live" sound, I simply smirked,
clasped my scepter and said: NEXT PLEASE.
Sure, 1 loved their first album — the ethereal
and ragged "Everybody Who Pretended To
Like Me Is Gone" (EPTLMIG) — but I didn't
have time for such speculation. In any case, I've
been around long enough to know that the only
thing hazier than indie-rock is — steady now!
— indie-talk.
So, in two short words: Shoot me. The
Walkmen's "Bows and Arrows" delivers
where EWPTLMIG failed: It is fiercely and
defiantly alive.
Right off the bat, these New York garage
rockers offer a crucial update of their formula:
urgency. "The Rat" is unlike anything they've
done before. The cinematic soundscape, wall
papered by organs and ancient pianos, flickers
like a paparazzi party and the chugging guitar
hook ensures that this'll be the play-list whore
of the year.
Leithauser's introductory yelp, mean
while, offers a throaty thesis for his vocals;
he's over the Bono complex and now he's
screaming right at ya, kids. "Can't you see me,
I'm pounding on your door," he seethes over
and over again.
My second favorite cut on "Bows and Ar
rows" is "Little House of Savages" — a song
that is dense and ominous enough to warrant
Interpol/Strokes comparisons. The driving
bass riff holds the song to the surface and the
young band shows awesome restraint in not
breaking out into chorus. Instead, when the
tension gets stifling, the instruments simply hic
cup to a higher key. The whole song, just like
many of the rocking numbers on this album, is
built around irregular drum fills. But listen
closely. Beneath the pounding is the familiar

sense of fragili
ty that made
EWPTLMIG
so special.
"My Old
Man," however,
reveals that The
Walkmen's
major problem
— that of mean
dering through
choruses and

insouciantly yodeling the verses-is yet to be
completely resolved. This speak-easy style
might have suited Jonathan Fire* Eater, the
band's precursor, because it was their god
dam schtick, but it's about time Leithauser
learned to respect his songs. And why the
hell not? The guitars are charmingly rusty
and there's plenty of sonic sawdust flying
through this little circus to keep the audience
entertained.
Also, we all know that The Walkmen detest
U2 comparisons, but I feel compelled to make
one after this extraordinary string of praises.
"Thinking of a dream I had" — with its gallop
ing drum-beats and super-fast guitars —is
"Bloody Sunday's" belligerent cousin and
shouldn't be missed. Just listen to the way Lei
thauser earnestly shouts slogans over the Edge
y guitars. It's endearing.
Lodged among all these rockers are "Hang
on, Siobahn" and "New Year's Ever," which
will have you thinking: "We've Been Had."
Again! The slow piano-waltz vibe of both
these numbers speaks volumes of the band's
confidence.
Indeed, The Walkmen — with their new
found confidence — are becoming the kind of
band that evokes strong reactions with their
art. "Bows and Arrows," unlike EWPTLMIG,
will rise above the buzz. As a result, more peo
ple will love them and more people will hate
them. But more importantly, more people will
listen to them.
And rest assured: Everyone who pretended
to like them will be gone. For good.
