# From the U.K. with love
## 
### RACHEL SYME 
Ah, Britain. The land of the Beat
les and the Clash, post-colonialism,
big red buses and small red telephone
booths, proper manners, punk rock
and an aura of snobbish intelligence
that, let's face it, makes us Americans
feel like slack jawed yokels from the
wrong side of the tracks. Somehow,
between 1776 and now, England has

gone from enemy to icon — there is a
myth of "cool" associated with this
country, the kind that makes girls
swoon for Hugh Grant's foppish bum
bling and that has caused numbers of
American men to adopt the English
"metrosexual" look and trade in their
Nike sneakers for Gola "trainers."
Although my two quarters here in
Oxford have helped to steadily break
down this myth, 1 will admit that

Britain is trendy, and yes, I want to
help spread the word about the good,
bad and bloody ugly back to the good
ol' U.S.A. So. if you would like to be
that girl on your block in tune with the
transatlantic or the guy who would
like to beef up your Wellington, read
on. British pop culture is as ridiculous
as you would think.
1) The Faux-hawk Frenzy: I was
originally going to write about female
fashion, but seeing as how Uggs are
on backorder in the States and the
miniskirt has become as essential to

"The 0.C." as drama and bad act
ing, I figured that the same things
are happening on both coasts.
A few tidbits: Lacquered
leather elf shoes in pink and
green, puffy jackets with fur
trimmed hoods and anything
Burberry are popular. (But be
ware: wearing the signature plaid
is quickly going out of style here,
so don't play off your $300 wallet
as "Brit-chic". . . they would
make fun of you in this country,
too).
I decided this week to focus on
the British male, the elusive pea-

coat-tight-jeans-scarf-and-gloved
clad example of metrosexuality at its
height. What is funny about British
male fashion is not that each example
be taken individually, but the fact that
on a Friday night in Oxford, nearly
every guy looks the same: It is a virtu
al sea of faux-hawks, pomade, puffy
wristbands, blazers and jeans ripped
at the ankles and knees. Perhaps if
you try the same look at Stanford
you'll be an individual, but you will
risk being called a wanker by your
peers, who know better.
2) Pub Culture: The pub is a British
institution, especially here in Oxford
where the nightlife leaves something
to be desired (sound familiar?). Stu
dents here go out every night, unlike
our weekend sprees, and consume a
steady amount of alcohol from
around 8 p.m. until the pubs close at
11 p.m. The pub is the place for seeing
and being seen, smoking an unneces
sary amount of cigarettes (which is
odd since they costa pretty penny
bear a giant "smoking kills" label) and
drinking bitter ale, lots of it. 1 should
know: I am covered with the stuff two
nights a week. My job at the Turf Tav
ern has turned out to be the only edu
cation I need in British culture: I have
learned (from my boss, nonetheless),
that sexual harassment does not exist
in this country, that Americans just
cannot hold their liquor the same as
the Brits, that the British are obsessed
with retro-American music (can we
say Motown?) and that it is still per
fectly acceptable to start up a bar

song, especially if the song is "Won
derwall" hy Oasis. I am also picking
up quite a bit of slang: Hooked up
with a honey last night? You pulled a
bird. Hungover? Consider yourself
knackered.
3) Josh Ritter. OK, so he is an
American, but I wanted to include
him as my music update because he is
topping the U.K. and Irish charts but
barely breaking out back home. Josh
is a folk-singer from Idaho in the Bob
Dylan / Nick Drake vein who recent
ly opened for Joan Baez in Oxford
and will be touring next month with
the Counting Crows and in the spring
with Damien Rice. I have seen him
perform twice in England, and they
love him here. His new album. "Hello
Starling," came out last fall in the
States and I urge you to pick one up.
You can say that you discovered him
first and drop a few random facts —
such as his nomination for Best Inter
national Male Singer in the Irish Me
teor Awards (like the Grammys) or
that Joan Baez covered one of his
songs on her new album. Visit
www.joshritter.com for more info.
Transatlantic trad-rock, so hot right
now.
Whoa, I think that is enough
British culture for now. Absorb and
claim as your own — that is what they
have learned to do with our style,
anyway. The trucker hat has started
to pop up around here, and as much
as I though that the trend would not
repeat itself, the cross-continental
gods work in mysterious ways.


Sportin' the fuux-hawk is the coolest tiling
to do in Britain.
