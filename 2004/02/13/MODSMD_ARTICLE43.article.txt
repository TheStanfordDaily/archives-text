# 'D' to the Dizzee, ‘I’ to the izzo
## 
### JENNIE KIM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Pulsing with jarring beats and man
gled, spitfire lyrics, Dizzee Rascal's flow is
a stream of desultoriness, most often clas
sified as "grime garage," though he
prefers the spelling "G-H-R-H-Y-M-E
garage." It's brilliant ugliness, whichever
way you spell it, truly unlike anything else
to come from this side of the Atlantic.
At the ripe old age of 19, the British
Rascal is now an established veteran of
the underground U.K. garage (UKG) rap
scene. He penned his first hit single, "I
Luv U," which spread like fire from pirate
radio to packed rave houses, when he was
just 16.
"Boy in Da Corner," Rascal's stun
ningly innovative clatter-filled debut,
hit stores in the U.K. last July. Since
then, the East Londoner, after getting
stabbed on his summer holiday, has sold
close to a million records, opened for
Justin Timberlake's U.K. solo tour, won
the prestigious Mercury Prize (think of
it as the British Nobel Prize in music)
and has been nominated for three
British Grammys.
Now, at long last, the album is avail
able at stateside Tower Records stores
without a yellow "IMPORT" sticker and
industrial-grade shrink-wrap. Rascal's
special US release includes an extra track,
but the overall sound remains undeniably
British. His accented, crudely English
snarl is more distinct, more regionalized,
than the similar UKG-style of his peers.
The Streets.
Like The Streets, Rascal is a self-pro
fessed member of the Play Station Gener
ation. a demographic label that translates
musically in his bizarro sampling of elec
tro earwigs, video game sound effects and

polyphonic
ringt on e s.
The result is
sparklingly
low rent, a
terrific rein
vention of
sound by a
teenage slum
dweller, lean
ing on every
day beats to
drag himself

out of bed in the morning. And yet some
how, Dizzee Rascal represents the future
of hip-hop.
Because let's face it: America's gold
en age of rap is over. Tupac, despite his
grueling release schedule, is dead, as is
the Black Panthers' original vision of
hip-hop. Hip-hop for protest? Hip-hop
for sale.
The biggest names in US hip-hop right
now — 50 Cent, OutKast, Missy Elliot,
Timbaland, The Neptunes, Jay-Z — have
pushed the genre to its creative limit,
making much of their tweaked-out bril
liance more accessible, more radio
friendly and, essentially, more commer
cial in the process. Crossover success has
been both a blessing (OutKast's "Hey
Ya," endorsed by Wesley Clark) and a
curse (everything about the Black-Eyed
Peas' "Where is the Love" — I fucking
hate that song).
In contrast to the Gap khakis slick
ness of the Neptunes, Rascal produces
his tracks with "but why is this so
catchy?" crudeness, using sandpaper in
lieu of shoeshine.
"Stop dreamin' / I'm your worst
nightmare" he declares in "Cut 'em Off,"
later adding in "Hold Ya Mouf" that he's
"a problem for Anthony Blair." His de

livery backs up his claims. The not-so-la
tent hostility in his trembling voice is
withering enough to desiccate PharreiTs
lushest croon.
Rascal's lyrics are socially conscious,
but only to the degree that they reflect his
own version of thug life in East London.
He's too narrow-minded to preach and
has few solutions — if you can relate, it's
by default.
He addresses potentially cloying,
after-school-special topics with bracingly
detached precision. Take his stance on
teen pregnancy: "Some whore banging on
your door / What for — pregnant? /
What're you talking about this for /15 —
she's underage, that's raw" ( "I Luv U").
But can Dizzee Rascal hit it big on
these shores? It's hard to predict, but if his
mantra on "Wot U On?" is any indica
tion, he's got the right mind for it: "Love
talks to everyone / Money talks more."

radio to packed rave houses, when he was
just 16.
"Boy in Da Corner," Rascal's stun
ningly innovative clatter-filled debut,
hit stores in the U.K. last July. Since
then, the East Londoner, after getting
stabbed on his summer holiday, has sold
close to a million records, opened for
Justin Timberlake's U.K. solo tour, won
the prestigious Mercury Prize (think of
it as the British Nobel Prize in music)
and has been nominated for three
British Grammys.
Now, at long last, the album is avail
able at stateside Tower Records stores
without a yellow "IMPORT" sticker and
industrial-grade shrink-wrap. Rascal's
special US release includes an extra track,
but the overall sound remains undeniably
British. His accented, crudely English
snarl is more distinct, more regionalized,
than the similar UKG-style of his peers.
The Streets.
Like The Streets, Rascal is a self-pro
fessed member of the Play Station Gener
ation. a demographic label that translates
musically in his bizarro sampling of elec
tro earwigs, video game sound effects and

polyphonic
ringt on e s.
The result is
sparklingly
low rent, a
terrific rein
vention of
sound by a
teenage slum
dweller, lean
ing on every
day beats to
drag himself

out of bed in the morning. And yet some
how, Dizzee Rascal represents the future
of hip-hop.
Because let's face it: America's gold
en age of rap is over. Tupac, despite his
grueling release schedule, is dead, as is
the Black Panthers' original vision of
hip-hop. Hip-hop for protest? Hip-hop
for sale.
The biggest names in US hip-hop right
now — 50 Cent, OutKast, Missy Elliot,
Timbaland, The Neptunes, Jay-Z — have
pushed the genre to its creative limit,
making much of their tweaked-out bril
liance more accessible, more radio
friendly and, essentially, more commer
cial in the process. Crossover success has
been both a blessing (OutKast's "Hey
Ya," endorsed by Wesley Clark) and a
curse (everything about the Black-Eyed
Peas' "Where is the Love" — I fucking
hate that song).
In contrast to the Gap khakis slick
ness of the Neptunes, Rascal produces
his tracks with "but why is this so
catchy?" crudeness, using sandpaper in
lieu of shoeshine.
"Stop dreamin' / I'm your worst
nightmare" he declares in "Cut 'em Off,"
later adding in "Hold Ya Mouf" that he's
"a problem for Anthony Blair." His de

livery backs up his claims. The not-so-la
tent hostility in his trembling voice is
withering enough to desiccate PharreiTs
lushest croon.
Rascal's lyrics are socially conscious,
but only to the degree that they reflect his
own version of thug life in East London.
He's too narrow-minded to preach and
has few solutions — if you can relate, it's
by default.
He addresses potentially cloying,
after-school-special topics with bracingly
detached precision. Take his stance on
teen pregnancy: "Some whore banging on
your door / What for — pregnant? /
What're you talking about this for /15 —
she's underage, that's raw" ( "I Luv U").
But can Dizzee Rascal hit it big on
these shores? It's hard to predict, but if his
mantra on "Wot U On?" is any indica
tion, he's got the right mind for it: "Love
talks to everyone / Money talks more."
