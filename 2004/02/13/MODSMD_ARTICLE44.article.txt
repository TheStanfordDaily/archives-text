### JOHN HOLGATE 
When Slug, Atmosphere's lead rap
per and creative genius, threw himself
into the crowd during a mic break at
last Saturday night's concert, you
could see why fans love this guy. It's
not the same sort of love they might
have for the mighty rock god or the
gorgeous diva â€” it's the love you have
for your family and friends, the love
and ache you feel when you're around
people you truly care about. Sure,
Slug's talented as hell and never seems
to get tired of touring, but his real
power lies in speaking to people's
daily struggles and relating to them on
an emotional level.
On the road. Atmosphere consists
of MCs Slug and Blueprint, with Mr.
Dibbs manning the turntables. Hail
ing from Minneapolis, Minn., Slug and
company have toured the country in
cessantly since the release of their
1998 debut, Outcast, an album
revered by fans for its introspective
lyrics and chill production. "God
Loves Ugly," released in 2002, gar
lered enough attention for some sup
porters to question whether labeling
Atmosphere as underground rap was
really true anymore. Although their
most recent release, "Seven's Trav
els," hasn't received quite the same
critical acclaim, the new material
sounded great in concert.

Atmosphere's set began with some
awesome DJ-ing by Mr. Dibbs. Mr.
Dibbs slowly scratched and tweaked
his way from Metallica to the Jungle
Brothers to "Trying to Find a Bal
ance," the first single from Seven's
Travels.
With the crowd pumped. Atmos
phere blistered through their new ma
terial before slowing the pace a bit and
performing songs from their earlier al
bums. The crowd chanted along to
"The Woman With the Tattooed
Hands" and commiserated with Slug
as he lamented about the "Modern
Man's Hustle." In between songs, Slug
bantered with the audience, often
pausing to shout out "Fuck you Lucy"
to the lost love of his life.
Taking a break half way through
the set, Mr. Dibbs started playing
Rage Against the Machine's "Killing
In the Name Of," shredding the rap
rock classic with scratches and blasts
of noise. Almost an hour into the per
formance, Slug decided it was time to
get to know his audience and launched
himself into the crowd before surfing
back to the stage.
All eyes were on Slug, perhaps the
most revered rapper in underground
hip-hop. Born of a black father and a
white mother, this man has connected
with fans because of his intense emo
tional charisma. Even when Blueprint
was rapping or Mr. Dibbs was scratch

ing the hell out of the turntables, you
couldn't take your eyes off of Slug. He
bounces around the stage like a kid,
gesticulating wildly, then pours his
heart out in a wash of words that blows
your mind as much as it assaults your
ears. Unlike most modern rap, his
rhymes aren't about the bling bling,
the women and the cars. He talks
about the girls who fucked him over,
the drugs he loves to use and hates to
take the pains and the joys of life.
Maybe you should check out Atmos
phere and see why so many fans
packed the Fillmore to watch a man
rap about the anguishes of his life.


Atmosphere's Slug: not your average
mollusk.
