Better than the "O. C."

F'ormer Hole singer Courtney Love announced that
she will follow in the footsteps of her deceased hus
band Kurt Cobain (whose autobiography "Journals"
dominated the 2002 best seller lists) by coming out
with her own book. Have you ever wanted to get inside the
mind of a manic crack whore? This is your chance.

— While on the
subject of emotionally
unstable people, David
Gest is suing his ex
wife Liza Minnelli for
battery. David claims
that Liza beat him se
verely in a fit of rage
caused by her belief
that David had collab
orated with the Na
tional Enquirer on a vi
cious article about
Liza's drinking. With a
face more tightened
than Joan River's and a
creepy presence rivaled

only ny mat ot wacko jacko, during an Access Hollywood
interview David passionately described Liza's abuse and
unnecessarily revealed deep scratch marks on his portly,
shaven stomach. Although he claims that no amount of
money can make up for the damage he endured by Liza's
all-mighty fist, he is suing her for $10 million while he re
covers in Hawaii.
— By far the most prevalent piece of celebrity news is
that Jackson admitted her breast unveiling during the
Super Bowl half-time show had been planned. The most
disturbing fact about this ordeal is not that Jackson re
vealed a little too much, but that after the incident "E.R."
immediately decided to cut a scene revealing an 80-year
old woman's breast from last Thursday's episode. With
cleavage so omnipresent on every network channel, who
cares if some nipple is shown? Our wonderful California
governor probably has pecks that are bigger than Janet's
breasts anyway.
— Onto more interesting news, Jane Carter (mother
of ex-Backstreet Boy Nick Carter) is being charged with
battery after breaking into her ex-husband's home. After
dragging his new girlfriend out of the house by the hair,
Jane Carter beat the woman with a remote control.
Nick's dad Robert Carter and his sister BJ have both pre
viously been charged with battery. To add to the Carter
family's troubles with the law, Nick Carter is dating the
charming Paris Hilton. With this kind of publicity, the
family's new reality show "The Carter Clan" is bound to
have stellar ratings, and I'm sad to say I'll probably be
part of the reason.
— Instead of purely gaining media attention from
bizarre behavior, some celebrities actually work. Matt
Damon is currently working on "The Bourne Suprema
cy," the sequel to his 2003 hit, "The Bourne Identity."
— Damon's newly single buddy Ben Affleck (yes, they
have finally broken up) has finished working on his new
movie "Jersey Girl," set to come out in the next few
months. Affleck costars with Liv Tyler, his ex-ass J-Lo and
Jason Biggs in this movie written by Kevin Smith about a
father of a six-year-old dealing with the death of his wife.
— Smith, the genius behind such greats as "Clerks,"
and "Chasing Amy," has also announced that he has fin
ished writing "Fletch Won," the third film in the Fletch se
ries. Production should start sometime this month al
though word is not out on who will play Fletch (gossip says
Chevy Chase, Brad Pitt, Jimmy Fallon or Affleck).
— The most exciting project underway is "Bad Educa
tion" directed by Pedro Almodovar (Talk to her, All About
my Mother) starring Javier Camara and Gael Garcia
Bernal. This film, loosely based on Almodovar's experi
ences as a child, follows two boys through their church
school education in Spain in the 1960's.The mixture of
Almodovar's genius, two extremely attractive Spanish ac
tors and the sexual tensions of a "church-school educa
tion" sounds like a recipe for success.
