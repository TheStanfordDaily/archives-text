# The
						Vibrator Monologues
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
According to statistics in the sexu
al bible (i.e. Cosmo), only a paltry 33
percent of women admit that they
masturbate. So, while every frat boy,
jock and computer nerd will admit
that he whacks off on a regular basis
and will proudly display the collection
of Internet porn crowding his hard
drive, many girls still blush, giggle and
squirm uncomfortably in their chairs,
innocently insisting "Oh no, oh my,
I've never done THAT."
Well, my lovelv ladies, it's time to

get over it. Or get into it, as the case
may be. Let us all hand together and
acknowledge our horniness, take
pride in our active libidos, hold our vi
brators high and wave them in the
wind for all to see, admire and salute!
Well, maybe not wave them in the
wind ... you can keep your vibrator
in your second desk drawer between
your computer charger and your
VCR manual (not that Roxy knows
anyone who keeps hers in such a
place, wink).
But please, admit that you have
one. You know you like it, and trust
me, the boys quite enjoy hearing the

down and dirty details. The idea of
you, naked and alone in your room,
bringing yourself to the point of oh
oh-oh ecstasy is an über turn-on.
Offer to let your man take a perv seat
in the corner and watch!
And if you are one of those un
lucky femmes who has yet to discover
the satisfaction that battery-powered
stimulation can provide, then run,
Run, RUN to Good Vibrations
(which is open late this week in honor
of Valentine's Day, score!) or the
nearest porn / adult store to campus
... which Roxy happens to know is
located on El Camino right near
Yummy Yogurt. Fat free yogurt and
an orgasm-inducing joy toy!!! What
could be better? Grab some unsatis

fied girlfriends and make a day of it!
With all of the fun gadgets and color
ful toys out there designed solely to
get you off, it's like being a kid in a
kooky candy store. Sizes, colors and
flavors, oh my! So grab a clear plastic
bag and some tongs and dig in. But
be careful about "sampling" in the
store. The check out clerks look at

you funny.
And vibrators are
not just for the clitoris
anymore. You can
purchase vibrators
specially designed for
g-spots, nipples or
"dual action" stimula
tion so you can get it
from every angle.
There are waterproof
vibrators, for those of
us who like it dirty and
clean, and clit kissers,
soft vibrating mouths
with jelly tongues that
flitter and caress.

(These look a little disturbing, even
for Roxy. but hey, to each woman, her
own!) Ask about curved tips, vibrating
and rotating stimulations and lots of
yummy "hands free" models that you
can strap on and wear underclothes.
As far as make and model go, I
hate to be a "Sex and the City" popu
larized cliche, but the Jack Rabbit, at
a price of $99.99, is a good, sound in
vestment. But you can spend as much
as you want. A decent orgasm can be
had fora twenty. Like anything, how
ever, you get what you pay for. And
this is your personal pleasure we're
talking about here. Think of it as the
cost of three good massages. I bet
Bertha the burly-armed masseuse
never gave you such a healthy glow. If

you're not ready for the full Jack Rab
bit, you can buy the cheaper Wittle
Wabbit Tickler, a smaller version with
just the jelly ears!
So, instead of spending cash on
expensive drinks at a humdrum Palo
Alto bar, invest your savings in The
Deep Penetrating Latex Dong or the
Jelly Lady Bug Vibe. Give the Pink

c?
Dolphin or Magic Fin
gers a whirl. The
Prince claims to be
"pleasantly scented."
For deep penetration,
the Wild Stallion, the
Starlight Tantalizer,
and the Crystal Play
mate all get five stars.
And there's always
the Vibrating Sea
Lion, the Cuddly
Companion, the Pur
ple Titan or, Roxy's
personal favorite as
far as vibrator titles
are concerned, the

Deep Space Probe.
After you've brought your shiny
new joystick home to play, feel free
to name it. Some of my favorite sug
gestions? Make it manly — try
Bronco Bill and ride him till he
drops. Want something sexy? Call it
Goldfinger: shaken, not stirred,
baby. Feel like it should be cute and
girly? Name it Lollipop and indulge
in a sugary calorie-fest on a Sunday
afternoon. And when you're all
moaning and groaning, alone or with
your partner watching, remember to
give Roxy a shout-out. It makes me
hot when you say my name;)
