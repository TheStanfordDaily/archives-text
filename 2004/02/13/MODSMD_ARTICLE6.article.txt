## Trustees approve laundry plan set to start next fall 
### My ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
Starting this fall, students will
no longer need to scramble for
quarters every time they do laun
dry. Under the new "Just Like
Home" system recently approved
by the Board of Trustees, stu
dents will pay a flat laundry fee as
part of their housing bill.
A version of this plan was
first proposed last year, but was
temporarily shelved due to stu
dent complaints about its fair
ness and environmental sound
ness. Since last fall. Student
Housing and the ASSU have
been revising the plan and pre
senting it to focus groups of ran
domly selected students.
"We've had very solid support
from students, although there
were some students who did re
spond with concerns," said

Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing Services.
"We went into a lot more detail to
make sure we're doing the right
thing here."
According to ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, a senior, the
"Just Like Home" laundry pro
gram will lower laundry costs for
students in two ways. First, it will
allow laundry costs to be included
in financial aid calculations. Sec
ond, it will reduce the mainte
nance costs for the washing and
drying machines.
"Using data from other uni
versities such as Princeton, we've
seen that these machines will have
fewer maintenance issues and be
more energy efficient," Figueroa
said. "There will be less incentive
to overstuff machines. Another
issue is the fact that we will no
longer need to upkeep the card
system and the coin-entry system.

which is what goes defunct on
most machines."
One objection raised to the
earlier plan was that it did not
give students any incentive to re
duce their laundry and their num
ber of loads.
"That's something that's un
derstandable," Whitney said.
"We're going to be doing educa
tion programs and the machines
are highly energy efficient."
Another concern was the fair
ness of a system in which students
who did exorbitant amounts of
laundry and students who did
very little pay the same amount.
Whitney acknowledged that this
was a concern, but said that per
fect equality was not possible.
"I think it's like anything else
in the world," he said. "Some peo
ple take 15 units, some take 12,

some take 20. It will never be completely rationed out
that way. We're going to be monitoring the machines to
make sure there's not abuse and that it's efficient."
According to a press release from the ASSU and Stu
dent Housing, an online survey indicated that 75 percent
of students overall favored the shift to a flat-fee system.
"We got a vast majority of both grads and undergrads
saying that they didn't like the program and wanted to
shift," Figueroa said.
She claimed that most focus-group members were
eventually convinced of the programs benefits, al
though a few still maintained that they did so little
laundry that they would be losing money by paying a

flat fee.
When Student Housing delayed implementation of
the program last fall, new machines had already been in
stalled in Branner; these machines were removed and
the old ones were returned.
"The Branner staff contacted us and wanted to
know, 'What happened to our brand new washers and
dryers, why did you bring these crappy ones back!'"
Figueroa said.
According to Rob Kolar, Housing Energy Manager,
the new washers will use 50 percent less water and 75
percent less soap than conventional machines. The new
machines will be installed over the summer, allowing the
program to commence across campus this fall.
Whitney said that the "Just Like Home" program will
increase room and board fees by 4.7 percent.
