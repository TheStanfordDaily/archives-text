The ASSU recently took its controversial list of spe
cial-fee refund applicants off its Web site. According to
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a senior, this decision
was prompted by widespread access to the list and con
cerns about student privacy.
"With the current special-fees debates, it became this
hot topic," Figueroa said. "People were passing these
mass e-mails with the address on to their lists. It became
this news and gossip thing."
She added, "People also started asking, 'Is this a
breach of privacy?' especially with the student IDs and
names together."
The ASSU is required by its constitution to provide
the financial officers and leaders of groups receiving
special fees with the SU IDs of all students who asked for
refunds on the portion of their special-fee money going
to that group.
"We hope that they'll use it as an opportunity to edu
cate students," Figueroa said. "Or they can decide to re
frain from serving those people, since they're no longer
required to do so."
Stanford's special fees program has been recently
been undergoing scrutiny due to an unusually high rate
of refund requests, which could jeopardize the program.
Figueroa said that the ASSU is currently "thinking
through how best we can provide this information to fi
nancial officers but make sure there are no security
risks."
She added that one possible method for achieving
this goal is providing two separate lists, one of SUIDs
and one of names.
