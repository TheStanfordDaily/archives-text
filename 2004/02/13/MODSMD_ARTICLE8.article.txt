# Cordell controversy closer to resolution
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford and the Palo Alto city coun
cil moved one step closer on Wednesday
to engaging in contract negotiations
once again. The California State Assem
bly Committee on Local Government
unanimously approved a bill that would
allow Vice Provost for Campus Rela
tions LaDoris Cordell to sit on the Palo
Alto city council without disrupting
business between Stanford and the city.
In order to become law. the bill still
needs to be passed by the state assembly
and signed by the governor.
"My understanding is that this bill
passed with no opposition, which is dif
ferent from the state senate committee,
which had some Republican opposi
tion." Cordell said. "I don't know why
this is a partisan issue."
Section 1090 of the government code
has prohibited business negotiations be
tween Stanford and Palo Alto since
Cordell took her seat Jan. 1 because it
forbids city councils from negotiating
contracts with a corporation for which a
council member works.

Stanford does not fall under the ex
emption to the law made for nonprofit
organizations, as was originally thought,
since the University is set up as a trust.
The bill, introduced earlier this
month by state Sen. Byron Sher, alters
that exemption so that it includes trusts
that operate as nonprofits, such as
Stanford.
According to Cordell, the next hear
ing will be a week from today.
"It's my hope that there will be no op
position," she said.
Until the situation can be resolved,
the city council has simply opted to hold
off on negotiating any contracts with
Stanford.
Even though there are many ongoing
contractual negotiations between the
city and Stanford — dealing with every
thing from the Stanford Shopping Cen
ter to Marguerite bus schedules — none
was so pressing that it could not be put
on hold for at least the first quarter of
this fiscal year.
"This bill is moving rapidly and time
is of the essence so that Stanford and
Palo Alto can continue doing business
together," Cordell said.
