# Overseas seminars deadline approaches
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last year, over 400 students studied abroad
through the Overseas Studies Program (OSP).
However, many students are limited from tak
ing advantage of the program because they feel
that they cannot afford to spend an entire quar
ter off campus. To accommodate such students,
the OSP offers Overseas Seminars, which are
three-week-long study abroad programs that
take place just before autumn quarter.
The deadline for this year's seminars is Mon
day, Feb. 15; they include programs in Mexico,
China, South Africa, Japan. India, the Philip
pines, the United Kingdom and Russia. Since
they take place over a relatively short time pe
riod — compared to the quarter-long OSP pro
grams — the seminars feature in-depth explo
ration of one particular topic.
"The seminars are intense academic experi
ences, because they involve the students all day,
as well as during the weekends," said Overseas
Seminars Coordinator Anja Seitz. "Students
pretty much "live and breathe' the course con
tent for three weeks straight."

Sociology Prof. Andrew Walder. who will
teach a seminar entitled "Chinese City Life
from Mao to Now" in Beijing, agreed with Seitz.
"It is an intensive experience," he said. "I es
timate that the educational experience is prob
ably equal to half a regular quarter course on
campus."
Like many of the other seminars, Walder's
will involve a great deal of field work. Accord
ing to Walder, his students will spend weekday
afternoons and each weekend conducting inter
views with local leaders and ordinary citizens in
Beijing.
"I hope that the experience will spur them to
take further courses on the subject, study the
language and do something in their future ca
reers related to China," Walder said.
School of Education Prof. Anthony Antonio is
equally as enthusiastic about his own overseas
seminar, which will study the educational system
in Manila.
"1 think it is important for Stanford students
to experience first-hand life in a developing
country," he said. "Students will gain some per
spective on their lives in the United States vis a
vis their experience in the Philippines — they

will begin to understand some of the challenges
faced by a developing country first-hand."
Each seminar will cost students $600, which
covers tuition, lodging and meals. In addition,
the students must pay for the airfare to and
from the location. Despite the flat rate of $600,
the actual cost to Stanford to accommodate
each student ranges from $2,000 to $4,000, de
pending on the cost of living in the particular
country.
Acceptance into a seminar is determined by
each seminar's professor. Once accepted, stu
dents will go through a pre-departure orienta
tion program during spring quarter. Many of
the faculty will also assign readings in prepara
tion for the seminar.
Since the program's inception in Sept. 2002,
the selection process for the limited slots has
been extremely competitive. In 2002, 438 appli
cations from 326 students were received for 60
available spaces. Last year, 561 applications
from 391 applicants were received for 123
available spaces.
For 2004, the OSP will offer nine seminars,
each limited to 15 students, fora total of 135
spots.
