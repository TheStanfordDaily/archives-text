Unnatural Selection: Should California
Regulate Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis?
Friday, February 27, 2004, B:ssam - s:oopm
Stanford Law School, Room 290
Brave New Law: Human Reproduction and Biotechnology
Saturday, February 28, 2004, 10:00 am - 3:45pm
Stanford Law School, Room 190
The Stanford Law School Center for Law and the Biosciences will hold a one-day conference on an
increasingly common procedure called POD that is used to screen for genetic diseases and gender in
a human embryo before it is selected to produce a child through invitro fertilization. Hear from
experts on the science, ethical controversy, and legal reality of any effort by the state of California to
regulate pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. The conference will be followed by a second day of dis
cussion on broader reproductive technology issues called "Brave New Law: Human Reproduction and
Biotechnology."
Both events are free and open to the public.
