BERKELEY, Calif. — Twenty-one and zero.
According to junior center Rob Little, the top
ranked Stanford men's basketball team's 69-58 victory
over California (11-10,7-5 Pacific-10 Conference) was a
statement game.
"We haven't won here [at Haas Pavilion| in two years
and it was a really big issue for us to win here this year.
[It was a] statement game that says, 'Hey, we're not
going to lose just because the record has been set,' " Lit
tle said.
Little led all Stanford scorers with 16 points and five
boards in just 21 minutes, while junior swingman Josh
Childress turned in another impressive all-around per
formance, scoring 15 points and tallying nine boards,
four assists, four blocks and two steals.
The performances of Little and Childress combined
with strong play by senior shooting guard Matt Lottich
(12 points total) and senior reserve Joe Kirchofer (seven
points in only 14 minutes) led to the Cardinal's 21st win
of the season, which sets a new school record for consec
utive victories.
And on a night that was all about setting the record
straight and proving that Stanford (21-0,12-0) could win
at Haas — that despite all the injuries and lineup
changes, the one, consistent intangible about this Cardi
nal team is its nightly ability to just figure out a way to
win — Stanford returned to its other mainstay to secure
the victory.
Defense.
What a concept.
On Saturday, the Cardinal came into the second half
and turned up its defensive intensity en route to an 11-
point lead with two minutes left to play that quieted the
Haas Pavilion crowd.
Stanford's frontcourt held Cal freshman forward and
leading scorer Leon Powe in check, allowing him only
seven points (all of which came from the free-throw line)
on, get this, only five field goal attempts. The Bears shot
only 21.7 percent from the field in the second half.
Powe was constantly double-teamed in the post and
picked up his fourth foul 10 minutes into the second half.
