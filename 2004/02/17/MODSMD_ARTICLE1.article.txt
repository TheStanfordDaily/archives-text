# Men win again, now No. 1

### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
BERKELEY, Calif. — Twenty-one and zero.
According to junior center Rob Little, the top
ranked Stanford men's basketball team's 69-58 victory
over California (11-10,7-5 Pacific-10 Conference) was a
statement game.
"We haven't won here [at Haas Pavilion| in two years
and it was a really big issue for us to win here this year.
[It was a] statement game that says, 'Hey, we're not
going to lose just because the record has been set,' " Lit
tle said.
Little led all Stanford scorers with 16 points and five
boards in just 21 minutes, while junior swingman Josh
Childress turned in another impressive all-around per
formance, scoring 15 points and tallying nine boards,
four assists, four blocks and two steals.
The performances of Little and Childress combined
with strong play by senior shooting guard Matt Lottich
(12 points total) and senior reserve Joe Kirchofer (seven
points in only 14 minutes) led to the Cardinal's 21st win
of the season, which sets a new school record for consec
utive victories.
And on a night that was all about setting the record
straight and proving that Stanford (21-0,12-0) could win
at Haas — that despite all the injuries and lineup
changes, the one, consistent intangible about this Cardi
nal team is its nightly ability to just figure out a way to
win — Stanford returned to its other mainstay to secure
the victory.
Defense.
What a concept.
On Saturday, the Cardinal came into the second half
and turned up its defensive intensity en route to an 11-
point lead with two minutes left to play that quieted the
Haas Pavilion crowd.
Stanford's frontcourt held Cal freshman forward and
leading scorer Leon Powe in check, allowing him only
seven points (all of which came from the free-throw line)
on, get this, only five field goal attempts. The Bears shot
only 21.7 percent from the field in the second half.
Powe was constantly double-teamed in the post and
picked up his fourth foul 10 minutes into the second half.

were called in the post.) He was lim
ited to only 18 minutes of play on a
night when the Bears were hoping to
prove their legitimacy as a Pac-10
contender by adding another top-25
upset to their resume.
"(The refsj were going to call of
fensive fouls in the post," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It's not
something we've seen a lot of. Obvi
ously somebody got a memo."
In all seriousness, though, Stan
ford was able to control the only
thing it could control — its defense
on it night when the usually rock
steady sophomore, Chris Hernan
dez, struggled from the field and no
Stanford player could find the bot
tom of the net from three-point range
in the second half. (The Cardinal
went 0-for-5 from the behind the arc
in the second period.)
"For whatever reason, the leading
three-point shooter in the Pac-1(),
Chris Hernandez, couldn't make
one," Montgomery said.
"I thought we got back to our help
concepts [defensively]," he contin
ued. "1 thought we did a better job
defensively, intelligently."

In the first half, an Amit Tamir
field goal with just under two minutes
left to play gave Cal its first lead of
the game, 30-29. The Bears then
went on a 7-2 run, which culminated
with a Stanford turnover and a fast
break slam by freshman forward
Marquise Kately, extending Cal's
lead to six points with just 21 seconds
left in the half.
After a Cardinal timeout, Tamir
fouled Little in the post and Little
converted the lay-in before heading
to the free-throw line. Little, howev
er, missed the bonus shot, but Chil
dress rebounded and was fouled in
the process. He knocked down both
free throws with three-tenths of a
second remaining, allowing the Car
dinal to jog into the locker room
down by only two points and with all
the momentum heading into the sec
ond period.
And, true to form, Childress sus
tained that momentum swing during
the early minutes of the second half.
The first three minutes transpired as
follows.
A Stanford turnover leads to a
Powe airball, which is followed by
another Stanford turnover. Powe
races down the court for what seems
to be an easy, crowd-pleasing dunk,
when Childress "came out of
nowhere" (according to Cal head
coach Ben Braun) to reject the slam.

Childress then dribbles downcourt
and hits a pull-up jumper from the
baseline, tying the score at 37 apiece.
Two plays later, Childress scores on a
baseline drive to put the Cardinal up
41-39.
Cal would never lead again.
With the win, questions still circu
late about the streak and Stanford's
ability to remain undefeated. But for
the time being, the Cardinal main
tains that it is just taking it one game
at a time.
Translation: 21 is great, but, in
the words of Little, "22-0 would be
better."
Indeed.
The Cardinal finds itself just two
wins away from clinching the very
Pac-10 title that has eluded it for
three years now. which means that if
Stanford manages to pull off a win at
Southern California on Thursday in
Los Angeles, the Cardinal would as
sure itself at least a share of the con
ference title.
If it also wins at Pauley Pavilion
against UCLA on Saturday, Stan
ford clinches the title outright.
"I kind of had to change my tune
with the guys," said Montgomery of
his psychological approach with his
team. "We're not afraid of winning
every game. We're not unhappy win
ning. We just want to make sure
there's some perspective here."

and it was a really big issue for us to win here this year.
[It was a] statement game that says, 'Hey, we're not
going to lose just because the record has been set,' " Lit
tle said.
Little led all Stanford scorers with 16 points and five
boards in just 21 minutes, while junior swingman Josh
Childress turned in another impressive all-around per
formance, scoring 15 points and tallying nine boards,
four assists, four blocks and two steals.
The performances of Little and Childress combined
with strong play by senior shooting guard Matt Lottich
(12 points total) and senior reserve Joe Kirchofer (seven
points in only 14 minutes) led to the Cardinal's 21st win
of the season, which sets a new school record for consec
utive victories.
And on a night that was all about setting the record
straight and proving that Stanford (21-0,12-0) could win
at Haas — that despite all the injuries and lineup
changes, the one, consistent intangible about this Cardi
nal team is its nightly ability to just figure out a way to
win — Stanford returned to its other mainstay to secure
the victory.
Defense.
What a concept.
On Saturday, the Cardinal came into the second half
and turned up its defensive intensity en route to an 11-
point lead with two minutes left to play that quieted the
Haas Pavilion crowd.
Stanford's frontcourt held Cal freshman forward and
leading scorer Leon Powe in check, allowing him only
seven points (all of which came from the free-throw line)
on, get this, only five field goal attempts. The Bears shot
only 21.7 percent from the field in the second half.
Powe was constantly double-teamed in the post and
picked up his fourth foul 10 minutes into the second half.

were called in the post.) He was lim
ited to only 18 minutes of play on a
night when the Bears were hoping to
prove their legitimacy as a Pac-10
contender by adding another top-25
upset to their resume.
"(The refsj were going to call of
fensive fouls in the post," said head
coach Mike Montgomery. "It's not
something we've seen a lot of. Obvi
ously somebody got a memo."
In all seriousness, though, Stan
ford was able to control the only
thing it could control — its defense
on it night when the usually rock
steady sophomore, Chris Hernan
dez, struggled from the field and no
Stanford player could find the bot
tom of the net from three-point range
in the second half. (The Cardinal
went 0-for-5 from the behind the arc
in the second period.)
"For whatever reason, the leading
three-point shooter in the Pac-1(),
Chris Hernandez, couldn't make
one," Montgomery said.
"I thought we got back to our help
concepts [defensively]," he contin
ued. "1 thought we did a better job
defensively, intelligently."

In the first half, an Amit Tamir
field goal with just under two minutes
left to play gave Cal its first lead of
the game, 30-29. The Bears then
went on a 7-2 run, which culminated
with a Stanford turnover and a fast
break slam by freshman forward
Marquise Kately, extending Cal's
lead to six points with just 21 seconds
left in the half.
After a Cardinal timeout, Tamir
fouled Little in the post and Little
converted the lay-in before heading
to the free-throw line. Little, howev
er, missed the bonus shot, but Chil
dress rebounded and was fouled in
the process. He knocked down both
free throws with three-tenths of a
second remaining, allowing the Car
dinal to jog into the locker room
down by only two points and with all
the momentum heading into the sec
ond period.
And, true to form, Childress sus
tained that momentum swing during
the early minutes of the second half.
The first three minutes transpired as
follows.
A Stanford turnover leads to a
Powe airball, which is followed by
another Stanford turnover. Powe
races down the court for what seems
to be an easy, crowd-pleasing dunk,
when Childress "came out of
nowhere" (according to Cal head
coach Ben Braun) to reject the slam.

Childress then dribbles downcourt
and hits a pull-up jumper from the
baseline, tying the score at 37 apiece.
Two plays later, Childress scores on a
baseline drive to put the Cardinal up
41-39.
Cal would never lead again.
With the win, questions still circu
late about the streak and Stanford's
ability to remain undefeated. But for
the time being, the Cardinal main
tains that it is just taking it one game
at a time.
Translation: 21 is great, but, in
the words of Little, "22-0 would be
better."
Indeed.
The Cardinal finds itself just two
wins away from clinching the very
Pac-10 title that has eluded it for
three years now. which means that if
Stanford manages to pull off a win at
Southern California on Thursday in
Los Angeles, the Cardinal would as
sure itself at least a share of the con
ference title.
If it also wins at Pauley Pavilion
against UCLA on Saturday, Stan
ford clinches the title outright.
"I kind of had to change my tune
with the guys," said Montgomery of
his psychological approach with his
team. "We're not afraid of winning
every game. We're not unhappy win
ning. We just want to make sure
there's some perspective here."
BERKELEY, Calif. — Twenty-one and zero.
According to junior center Rob Little, the top
ranked Stanford men's basketball team's 69-58 victory
over California (11-10,7-5 Pacific-10 Conference) was a
statement game.
