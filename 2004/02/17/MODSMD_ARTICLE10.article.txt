## Encouraging Ideas Seminar series educates students about leadership and management 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Every Wednesday after
noon, Terman Auditorium
hosts the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Seminar se
ries, created by the Stanford
Technology Ventures Program
and BASES. Implemented this
quarter, the series invites promi
nent business leaders to speak
about issues such as leadership,
finance and management.
Gary Morgenthaler, Gener
al Partner at Morgenthaler
Ventures, emphasized leader
ship and teamwork when he
spoke on Jan. 14. Morgenthaler
also discussed the current state
of the capital markets.
" I think [the role of venture
capital] is unchanged, which is
that this is the fundamental
source of capital for company
formation for entrepreneurial
companies," he said.

He also characterized en
trepreneurship as key to the
survival of the U.S. economy.
"Entrepreneurial compa
nies are the principal source of
innovative new ideas and
product technologies for soci
ety at large," Morgenthaler
said. "This has proven to he a
great competitive advantage
for the United States. [Ven
ture capital is a] great vehicle
for people who have ideas to
bring them to market."
Nonetheless, venture capi
talists only fund a small frac
tion of all plans they see.
While it is harder to get fund
ed in today's economy, Mor
genthaler believes it is a posi
tive outcome.
"The bar is definitely high
er [for companies getting fund
ed today]," he said. "What's
required to get past the scruti
ny of the venture capitalist is
dramatically more stringent

than it was three years ago. In
my way of thinking, that's ac
tually a good thing. While a lot
of innovation occurred in the
1998-2000 period, a lot of capi
tal was wasted."
The co-founders of Pay Pal,
Peter Thiel and Max Levchin,
used their session on Jan. 21 to
discuss their experience of cre
ating a startup. "Max and I ba
sically started hiring all our
friends," Thiel said. "And then
it just grew organically from
there. We didn't expect any of
this [incredible growth]."
Thiel stressed the impor
tance of starting with the right
team of people.
"We had several ideas in
mind, and we worked from
there," he said. "The key thing
was the people. If you start out
with the wrong people, it's
harder to change than if you
start out with the wrong idea."
Thiel also believes that

though learning
more about en
trepreneurship
is important,
nothing can re
place hands-on
experience.
" [Building Pay-
Pal] was a very
open-ended pro
cess," he said.
"There is no sub
stitute to actual
ly [going out
and] doing it.
You can talk
about it as much
as you like, but in
some ways you
actually have to
go through the
process and you
learn directly
how to pull one
of these compa
nies together."
Bill Campbell,
chairman of Intu
it, shared a session
with co-founder,
president and
COO of TellMe
Mike McCue on
Feb. 4. They
talked about vi
sion and strategy.
McCue has one
rule of thumb
when considering
a new venture.
"If you want to
build a really
great company,
go after some
thing that's really
huge in a really
large market and

assemble a great team," he said.
"If you're passionate about
what you're building, you'll end
up building something great,
one way or another."
He used this approach
when starting Tell Me.
"I thought about what was
the single biggest idea I could
possibly come up with, think
ing, 'where is the Internet
going to have its next major im
pact,"' McCue said. "I thought
the telecommunications indus
try was ripe for change, and the
industry was huge."
According to McCue, in
addition to having a big idea, it
is important to have a bal
anced founding team.
" If you're the technical per
son working on a particular
idea, make sure you're part
nering with someone who's
good at the business side early
on, so that you can try to shape
your idea," McCue said. "If
you're a business person, make
sure you're partnering with
someone really good at the
technical side."
However, Campbell dis
cussed the experience neces
sary to run a company. His
main advice was to work at a
company before attempting a
venture.
"My view is that too many
people try to be entrepreneurs
without understanding how to
build a company and have a
good idea of a product," he
said. "If you're coming right
out of school, work fora com
pany fora while. It will help
you in the long run develop a
reasonable business plan
where you can expect to be the
CEO of a company."
He believes that experi
ence is necessary in all aspects
of a venture.
"If you are really passion
ate about starting a company,
my view is that you need to
surround yourself with good
advisors, good venture capi
talists, and have a manage
ment team that have experi
ence in the areas which you
want to be involved in,"
Campbell said.
While the economic out
look may not grow as quickly
as during the Internet boom,
many economic analysts feel
that there is something to look
forward to.
"Our firm has been very
fortunate to have supported a
number of Stanford companies
overtime," Morgenthaler said.
"We absolutely plan to contin
ue to do so."
