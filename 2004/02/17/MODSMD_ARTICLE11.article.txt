# Are we alone?

Extraterrestrial life may not just be the stuff of science fiction. Based
on scientific principles alone, the possibility of other worlds teeming
with life is plausible.
The scientific search for extra-terrestrial life is known as astrobiolo
gy. It entails finding organisms and conditions similar to those that
evolved on earth, and not little green men.
Scientists believe that life on earth began from primordial soup, a
dense, chemically rich compound. The simple molecules in the pri
mordial soup evolved into more complex structures such as amino
acids and sugars. These combined to form structures that metabolize
energy more efficiently, paving the way for cells, the fundamental
units of life.
Cells were able to replicate with the advent of DNA â€” the uni
versal code of sugar bases that can direct the formation and regulation
of organisms.
Between one billion and 600 million years ago, cells converged to
form multi-cellular organisms, capable of higher functions. Beginning
with the first ocean life forms, a variety of organisms with varying traits
evolved in the earth's numerous environments. The remarkable result
is that in all habitats, from scorching volcano vents to stark acidic pools,
life has found a way to survive.
Planets throughout the universe are also host to seemingly in
hospitable environments. Scientists have narrowed down the re
quirements for the possibility of life. In "Life in the Universe" au
thors Jeffrey Bennet, Seth Shostak, and Bruce Jakosky, illustrate
the current consensus.
The most important factor is the presence of elements necessary to
make cell components. This includes the elements oxygen, carbon, hy
drogen, nitrogen, which makes up 96 percent of organic matter.
A second requirement is an energy source to fuel metabolism, such
as chemical vents, internal heat, or, in our case, sunlight. The universe
has a tendency to go toward disorder, known as the second law of ther
modynamics. This measure is known as entropy and favors sponta
neous processes. Cells need energy to fuel the non-spontaneous reac
tions that keep them alive, such as the bonding of molecules. Thus, in
planets without an energy source, molecules will usually never bond,
meaning that life cannot emerge.
Lastly, a third requirement for life to emerge is the presence of
water. Liquid water plays an integral role in making molecules avail
able for chemical reactions, transporting chemicals out of cells, and is
a versatile medium for cell metabolism. Other liquid compounds
could possibly fulfill this function too, but water is by far the most like
ly candidate.
Given these requirements, we can already find evidence of life-pre
ceding conditions throughout our solar system. Currently, there are in-
that water may lie beneath the surface of Mars, our moon, and
Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.
Considering that there 2,500 stars within 50 light-years of earth,
around 100 billion solar star systems in our galaxy, and about 100 billion
galaxies in the universe, the possibility of life existing elsewhere is rela
tively substantial. We would have no way of knowing, however, what
these organisms may look like, how they metabolize, and what level of
intelligence they would exhibit.
Finding intelligent life seems impossible but, taking into account the
mechanisms of evolution, their existence is also plausible. Organisms can
evolve similar traits despite different genetic backgrounds by occupying
similar habitats. In the animal kingdom at least eighty traits, from horned
snouts to eyes, have evolved independently in different organisms. This
suggests that there are prevalent adaptations favored by nature. If intelli
gence is such an example, the existence of other beings like us is possible.
In fact, the mathematician Sir Francis Drake postulated a formula
to surmise the probability of contacting such extra-terrestrial life. This
formula is known as the Drake Equation: Number of alien civilizations
out there= Nhp x Flife x Fciv x Fnow.
Nhp is the number of hospitable planets. Flife is the fraction of hos
pitable planets that have life. Fciv is the fraction of these life forms that
would be capable of communicating, implying the capacity for civiliza
tion. Fnow is the fraction these life-forms that would exist now.
If such intelligent life exists, perhaps thousands or even millions of
years more advanced than humans, why is it that we have not yet heard
from them? This is the gist of what is known as Fermi's paradox. Con
sidering our exponential growth of technology, advanced extra-terres
trial civilizations should have developed interstellar transportation to
travel throughout the universe and make their presence known. As of
yet, however, we have found no evidence of extra-terrestrial life outside
our solar system.
Fermi 's paradox has three solutions: Either interstellar travel is too
hard, or alien civilizations do not want to make themselves known, or
we are really alone. Nevertheless, gazing at the night sky, it is hard to
believe that life is rare.
