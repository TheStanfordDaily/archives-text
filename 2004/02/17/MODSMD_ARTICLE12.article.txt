Laptop computers, wireless Wi-Fi networks, plasma
television screens and projection monitors. What may
sound like something out of a computer convention is
in fact state-of-the-art equipment used in the first-floor
classrooms of the newly renovated Wallenberg Hall.
Also known as Building 160 in the Quad, the original
construction was completed in 1900 through funding
from Thomas Welton Stanford. Over the past 100 years
it has housed a library, the law school and the depart
ment of political science. It was recently redeveloped via
a $15 million gift from the Wallenberg Foundation of
Sweden to showcase the University's commitment to ad
vances in the education process.
The five classrooms on the first floor of Wallenberg
Hall boast an innovative style of teaching. Technology
aside, the flexible room layout enables instructors to
configure the classroom to their teaching needs.
Each room contains lightweight and flexible tables
and chairs that facilitate multiple modes of instruction in
a readily configurable environment.
Dan Gilbert, an Academic Technology Specialist for
the Stanford Center for Innovations in Learning and
Stanford alumni, elaborated on the innovations behind
the first-floor classrooms.
"These are laboratory classrooms," he said. "Class
rooms are so flexible that they can be molded to [an in
structors] liking."

Five learning spaces occupy the first floor: Four class
rooms suited to approximately 30 students and the Wal
lenberg Learning Theater, which is suitable for larger
classes and performances. The rooms have been de
signed to provide support fora myriad of traditional and
emerging modes of teaching. Additionally, the rooms
are equipped with technology to offer users the ability to
record activities for later use.
Each room of the four smaller classrooms has two
rear-projection Websters, or big-screen displays that can
project the screen contents of the networked Apple
notebook computers. Webster includes digital white
board software that allows a user to edit directly on doc
uments and images, or on a whiteboard.
Innovations in Wallenberg Hall extend to other as
pects of the teaching environment. Room reservations
are managed through a centralized computer system.
The entrance to each of the four classrooms is equipped
with a panel that displays who the room is reserved for at
a particular period of time.
On a typical Tuesday afternoon. Prof, of Mechan
ical Engineering Larry Leifer can be seen teaching
his Design class. He employs a unique style of teach
ing, utilizing technology to furnish interest in the
subject matter.
Students in his class could present work they have
completed at home by uploading their work via a DVD
reader to the notebook computers provided in each
classroom.
Each notebook has iSpace software to enable the

transfer of files from one computer to another, share
control of the big screen computers and give synchro
nized multi-screen presentations. Furthermore, new
applications are being developed continually by the
Computer Science Department and the SCIL technolo
gy team.
A copy camera in each room takes high resolution dig
ital photos of huddle boards and converts them to images.
Huddle boards are simply whiteboards, but designed fora
team to discuss and communicate its ideas in a better way.
The copy cam takes a snapshot of the work in progress
and places it online.
The technology enables users to hold videoconferenc
ing sessions with individuals at remote locations. Russ
Altman, an associate professor of genetics and medicine,
demonstrated this capability in his Biomedical Informat
ics class last Tuesday.
"I think that the main difference for us was that in
stead of inviting local experts on any given topic, we
were able to get the best people worldwide to speak to
the class," Altman said. "So we had two to three speak
ers come over the wire from their home office with little
inconvenience."
The Wallenberg projectors and screens allowed the
parties to see each other in real time. The second screen
directly adjacent the first could be used to show slides
and accompanying material.
"We could look at both them and their slides at the
same time â€” simulating a real talk better," Altman said.
He added that there are less subtle advantages to this

style of innovative teaching. For instance, his class could
get ideas across more quickly and generate notes from
the board for easy distribution.
The technological complexities underlying the class
rooms necessitate personnel to resolve issues in a timely
manner, Altman said.
"The technology is not yet to the point where you can
just walk in and use stuff from a standing start," he ex
plained. "[lt is important] to have a technology-savvy
TA who could make things work well in the back
ground."
Gilbert said that part of his job is to resolve issues
with the technology.
"My job is to help people use the stuff well, to keep
the technology running," Gilbert said.
Lilly Irani, a computer science graduate student,
thought that the technology had a lot of complexities.
"The fact that Dan [Gilbert] is involved is key."
The technology-oriented innovative style to teaching
can have mixed results. Student reaction is dependent
solely on the efficacy of the instructor.
"Good teachers can become better, bad teachers can
become worse," Gilbert said. "Students can become dis
engaged [from instruction]."
The classrooms have found widespread use on cam
pus. Several departments have held classes Wallenberg
Hall, and the number continues to grow.
"We've touched the humanities, sciences, medical
school, school of education, engineering, languages and
political science," Gilbert said.
