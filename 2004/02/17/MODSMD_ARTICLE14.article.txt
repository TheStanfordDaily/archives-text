## V-Week should ditch the rape tape 
### 
This year's coordinators of Stanford's V-
Week should be commended for their ef
forts in raising campus awareness of vio
lence and sexual assault against women.
Throughout last week. White Plaza was decorated
with ribbons that recognized survivors of sexual as
sault. panel discussions on rape and a spoken word
night on "What's Your Vagina Got to Say?" were
held and the week concluded with Friday and Sat
urday night student performances of Eve Ensler's
award-winning play, "The Vagina Monologues."
All proceeds from last week's events, a total of
several thousand dollars, were donated to charities
aiding victims of rape and sexual assault. Stanford's
"Vagina Warriors," the coordinators of V-Week,
pulled off an admirable triple feat in educating stu
dents about a serious international problem, raising
money for charity and providing popular campus
entertainment.
That said, however, the Vagina Warriors' deci
sion to wrap tape around certain areas on campus to
designate them as "Rape Free Zones" is question
able. This move created controversy in large part
because the primary residences targeted for "rape

tape" were fraternities. We agree that this could
serve to reinforce negative stereotypes about fra
ternity members, yet the decision to use the rape
tape at all seems ill founded. How can any area ac
tually be deemed a "Rape Free Zone?" Even if cer
tain residences were wrapped in tape, thereby an
nouncing their status as "Rape Free Zones," what
could the tape actively do to combat sexual assault?
Wouldn't V-Week coordinators' efforts be better
directed toward proactively preventing sexual as
sault than toward using cheeky symbolism to illus
trate that Stanford residences are a safe place, espe
cially when this claim isn't necessarily true?
We recognize the Vagina Warriors' desire to
demonstrate campus solidarity for the movement,
especially by garnering support from the fraternity
community. But it seems premature to declare any
area on campus as "rape-free," especially as the
University has just emerged this year from dozens
of attacks by the "Serial Groper." Next year, we
hope that V-Week's coordinators will learn from
this year's controversy by eschewing the rape tape
in favor of a program with more tangible benefits,
such as self-defense workshops in the dorms.
