# All should participate in BLM
## 
### 
February is Black History Month, a month
long celebration of black history and cul
ture. On Stanford's campus, this month has
been affectionately termed "Black Libera
tion Month" or BLM. We are now at the halfway
mark of the month and into the full swing of the di
verse array of events. The Black Community Ser
vices Center, the Black Liberation Month Commit
tee and the various student groups and organiza
tions that have thus far planned and executed
events should be commended for their hard work
and devotion in making the celebration of black his
tory a reality for the entire Stanford community.
The events have ranged from academic panel
discussions on issues such as "The Criminal Re
sponsibilities of Hip-Hop Culture" to a documen
tary film series on "Race and the Minority Experi
ence in America" sponsored by the Black Pre-Law
Association and The Real News, respectively.
Other events have included guest lectures from
Kevin Powell, from MTV's "The Real World," and
author / entertainer Aisha Tyler. The Black Law
Students' Association also presented a panel on
"Leading Societal Change: Revisiting Brown v.
Board of Education and the Legacy of Judicial Ac
tivism." The BCSC Faculty Series Kick-Off fea
tured Ujamaa's Resident Fellow, Stanford Business
School Prof. Peter Henry speaking on the econom
ic aspects of making the black community better.

tee on Black Performing Arts held "Black Love" on
Thursday, Feb. 12. This evening of expressing love
in the African-American community through
singing, spoken-word and other performance arts
was a success and an appropriate culmination to the
first half of the month.
The theme for this year's Black Liberation
Month is "How to Make Black America Better."
The events thus far have addressed this theme well,
whether it is from a social, economic, political or
cultural lens. The larger Stanford community
should feel encouraged to attend these events to get
a glimpse at issues in the black community at Stan
ford, the United States and the Diaspora at large.
Black Liberation Month is one that should be cele
brated by all communities, and the theme of "How
to Make Black America Better" is a large piece of
how to make America better.
So, take a look at the events calendar for the re
mainder of the month and attend some of the excit
ing programs. Whether it is "Delta Gent" this Fri
day— an event celebrating the achievements of
men in the black community —or "Afrika Un
plugged" on Feb. 26, an evening of artistic expres
sion on Africa and the Diaspora, there are more
than enough events to satisfy most peoples' tastes
and curiosities. Stanford should come out as a com
munity this month to celebrate black history and
initiate thought and dialogue on "How to Make
Black America Better."
