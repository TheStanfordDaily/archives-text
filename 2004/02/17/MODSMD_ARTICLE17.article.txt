# GO BIG OR GO HOME
## Meet Mikey, he likes it 
### 
I figure this column should be some
kind of introduction. I'm Mikey,
and I'm a senior. My major is in
event planning (with honors) and
I've wasted away a good six-figure
amount my parents think I've spent on
classes. I'm a senior class president, a
member of the Alumni Association's
Board of Directors, a state-licensed fi
nancial representative, a sales associate
at a clothing store, a former news editor
here at The Daily, a fraternity member
and a member of a campus rock band.
No, I do not pad my resume, if that's
what you're thinking, because I don't
care about getting a job.
1 don't care about getting a job be
cause I am unable to get a job, and yes, 1
will be here next year. I'm not co
terming, I'm not double majoring and I
did not red-shirt my freshman year (if
Stanford had a curling team, things might
have be different). I'm just staying a fifth
year to finish my major, take care of my
language requirement and... let's just
leave it at... tocomplete"some"GEßs.
My grade point average is probably
very close to my height in meters, and
thanks to this fact, I have trouble getting
"pre-selected interview slots" through
the Career Development Center's re
cruiting process. Does this matter to
me? Yes and no. To my parents, who are
doctors and once dreamt for their son to
follow in their footsteps. I am a failure.
"For the amount of money you spend
each year at school, you can buy a new car
and DONT YOU FORGET THAT."
my Mom's voice rattles through the
phone receiver almost weekly.
She's right, and for this, 1 must ratio
nalize my actions from the past three
years. As well, 1 must extrapolate on a
couple attempts I made to capitalize on
the educational opportunities Stanford
threw my way.
I entered Stanford as your typical

Humßio pre-med freshman. Then I
took an introductory seminar called
"Designing the Human Experience"

with Larry Leifer,
the founding direc
tor of Stanford's
Center for Design
Research. Larry,
who advised David
Kelley — founder
of 1 DEO, one of the
world's leading de
sign companies —
back in the day, is a
very insightful, pa
tient, nudge-you-

in-the-right-direction kind of man
whom you would want as a mentor.
The class worked on developing possi
ble concepts to implement in the then
soon-to-be-constructed Wallenberg
Hall. These days, as 1 walk through this
new and ridiculously state-of-the-art
building, it's nice to see my class' ideas
represented in some of the furniture
and digital displays.
This seminar inspired me to switch
my major to product design, and al
though those plans ended up falling
through, I learned. A lot. (Mom. I hope
you're reading this.)
On a side-note: If you've never been
to the Center for Design Research, it's
worth a visit. The people there are work
ing on new research via touch-screen
projection displays, design observation
rooms and collaboration space. Fasci
nating things. It's just too bad I'm no
longer working on them since I aban
doned product design.
Next, we switch over to the time
when I was a psych major. In a psych
experiment run by Jared Curhan. now
an assistant professor at MlT's Sloan
School of Management. I served as his
research assistant fora study on nego
tiation. In this experiment, two partic

ipants with different instructions ne
gotiated their way into a mock deal.
Real money was the incentive, and
you wouldn't believe the kinds of
things people would do to rip each
other off.
This sparked my interest in negotia
tion so much that instead of taking
classes to fulfill my major requirements
these past few years, I've been known
to occasionally pursue coursework in
social psychology, negotiation and dis
pute resolution.
Additionally, I use my acquired ne
gotiation skills on the other people I
work with on the class cabinet. My
pesky co-presidents always think they
know best. When they're wrong
(which is basically any time they dis
agree with me), 1 have the training to
convince them so.
Suinford offers a slew of resources if
you're interested in this kind of stuff.
Check out the Stanford Center on Con
flict and Negotiation (http://www.stan
ford.edu/group/sccn).
I hope this little foray into my past
was something of interest to you. In the
mean time, while my econ and comm
assignments sit untouched on my desk.
1 have to go to my weekly senior class
cabinet meeting, then another focus
group meeting after that. They have
nothing to do with my classes, but don't
tell my mom.

Mikey Lee is a senior majoring in com
munication. He promises not to write
about himself as- much next time and is
also looking for more excuses to skip
class. If you want to talk to him about
something you think is interesting, e
mail him with your thoughts at
mikeylee@stanford.edu. If you have
questions regarding his job as a senior
class president, you can find him at
Thursday's Pub Night.

Mikey Lee
I figure this column should be some
kind of introduction. I'm Mikey,
and I'm a senior. My major is in
event planning (with honors) and
I've wasted away a good six-figure
amount my parents think I've spent on
classes. I'm a senior class president, a
member of the Alumni Association's
Board of Directors, a state-licensed fi
nancial representative, a sales associate
at a clothing store, a former news editor
here at The Daily, a fraternity member
and a member of a campus rock band.
No, I do not pad my resume, if that's
what you're thinking, because I don't
care about getting a job.
1 don't care about getting a job be
cause I am unable to get a job, and yes, 1
will be here next year. I'm not co
terming, I'm not double majoring and I
did not red-shirt my freshman year (if
Stanford had a curling team, things might
have be different). I'm just staying a fifth
year to finish my major, take care of my
language requirement and... let's just
leave it at... tocomplete"some"GEßs.
My grade point average is probably
very close to my height in meters, and
thanks to this fact, I have trouble getting
"pre-selected interview slots" through
the Career Development Center's re
cruiting process. Does this matter to
me? Yes and no. To my parents, who are
doctors and once dreamt for their son to
follow in their footsteps. I am a failure.
"For the amount of money you spend
each year at school, you can buy a new car
and DONT YOU FORGET THAT."
my Mom's voice rattles through the
phone receiver almost weekly.
She's right, and for this, 1 must ratio
nalize my actions from the past three
years. As well, 1 must extrapolate on a
couple attempts I made to capitalize on
the educational opportunities Stanford
threw my way.
I entered Stanford as your typical

Humßio pre-med freshman. Then I
took an introductory seminar called
"Designing the Human Experience"

with Larry Leifer,
the founding direc
tor of Stanford's
Center for Design
Research. Larry,
who advised David
Kelley — founder
of 1 DEO, one of the
world's leading de
sign companies —
back in the day, is a
very insightful, pa
tient, nudge-you-

in-the-right-direction kind of man
whom you would want as a mentor.
The class worked on developing possi
ble concepts to implement in the then
soon-to-be-constructed Wallenberg
Hall. These days, as 1 walk through this
new and ridiculously state-of-the-art
building, it's nice to see my class' ideas
represented in some of the furniture
and digital displays.
This seminar inspired me to switch
my major to product design, and al
though those plans ended up falling
through, I learned. A lot. (Mom. I hope
you're reading this.)
On a side-note: If you've never been
to the Center for Design Research, it's
worth a visit. The people there are work
ing on new research via touch-screen
projection displays, design observation
rooms and collaboration space. Fasci
nating things. It's just too bad I'm no
longer working on them since I aban
doned product design.
Next, we switch over to the time
when I was a psych major. In a psych
experiment run by Jared Curhan. now
an assistant professor at MlT's Sloan
School of Management. I served as his
research assistant fora study on nego
tiation. In this experiment, two partic

ipants with different instructions ne
gotiated their way into a mock deal.
Real money was the incentive, and
you wouldn't believe the kinds of
things people would do to rip each
other off.
This sparked my interest in negotia
tion so much that instead of taking
classes to fulfill my major requirements
these past few years, I've been known
to occasionally pursue coursework in
social psychology, negotiation and dis
pute resolution.
Additionally, I use my acquired ne
gotiation skills on the other people I
work with on the class cabinet. My
pesky co-presidents always think they
know best. When they're wrong
(which is basically any time they dis
agree with me), 1 have the training to
convince them so.
Suinford offers a slew of resources if
you're interested in this kind of stuff.

flict and Negotiation (http://www.stan
