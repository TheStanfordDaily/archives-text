# AN AVERAGE WHITE BAND
## Apathy as Gen Y's social protest? 
### 
Consider the following conversa
tion I was privy to recently.
Guy: "I know this guy who.
like, shaved the hair off his nut
sack." Girl: "Eww! Why did he do that?
I mean, didn't it hurt?" Guy: "1 dunno...
hair there is weird. It's, like, sparse and
sort of spiky."
The conversation proceeded to ex
plore the negative ramifications of this
seemingly senseless act of vanity, name
ly, rashes and ingrown hairs. Interesting?
Perhaps... in a "There's Something
About Mary" sort of way. More impor
tantly, though, this snippet of a conversa
tion demonstrates the levity typical of ev
eryday student exchanges on campus.
Human nature dictates that we all en
gage in such persiflage. But these super
ficial exchanges seem too often today to
replace discussion of more meaningful
matters. We take little intellectual inter
est in discussing political, social or moral
issues. Accusations of social and political
apathy among our generation are
widespread. Impassioned debate recent
ly erupted at Princeton University over
an article written by its University Coun
cil in one of the school's publications. The
article suggested that student participa
tion in intellectual life on campus is lack
luster. That concern is certainly preva
lent here within the "Stanford bubble."
What is responsible for this disturb
ing trend of anti-intellectualism? Maybe
the PC-ness of the 1990s and today make
us afraid of discussing sensitive issues
among people we don't know well, when
candid dialogue is often most needed. In
a world of increasing litigation, we are
scared to be held liable for our words.
Many point to the obvious suspect —
television. Surely the copious amounts of
mindless junk regularly emitted from the
boob tube decrease our capacity for in
tellectual interests and pursuits. Surely

TV is the Big Bad Villain, surely. Maybe
TV plays a part. But I think the roots go
much deeper.
I must here draw a distinction be
tween anti-intellectualism and apathy.
Although separate, they are trends that
fuel each other. Let's first look at our
parents and grandparents. Our parents
were children of the 1 9605, champions of
nonconformity and civil rights. Our
grandparents lived through the Great
Depression and World War 11. Unlike
them, we have not in our lifetimes unit
ed as agents of change or lived through
especially trying social or political
events. Perhaps the events of Sept. 11,
2001, and the effort to rebuild Iraq will
change this. Major political and social
movements of the twentieth century
were born of a fundamental intellectual
idea or belief that is lacking in today's
arenas — communism. Kennedy's liber
al movement and passive resistance, to
name a few. These ideas exemplify the
marriage of intellect and involvement.
Our twentieth century predecessors em
braced or rejected philosophies at the
core of these movements with a sense of
urgency and immediacy remarkably ab
sent today. We lack the quintessential
idealism of youth. Not everyone, of
course —such blanket statements ring
hollow. But generally, we seem more
cynical than our parents were at our age.
Since we have faced no crisis, shouldn't
we be more idealistic? Or did the cushy
1990s somehow leave us disaffected?
The past 20-some years have wit
nessed unprecedented prosperity that
saw the tech boom in Silicon Valley and
rapid growth in the fields of medicine
and science. The United States was un
stoppable. Amid our Cabbage Patch
Dolls and Transformers, Reagan opti
mism, Madonna, Family Ties, the fall of
the Berlin Wall, the Gulf War, Nirvana,

the advent of yuppies and a booming
economy, we developed an acute aware
ness of a salient fact: Money equals
power. Rarely is it effective these days to
run around championing a cause if we
cannot win the support of political fac
tions through monetary contributions.
The political machinations of our plutoc
racy have left us more disillusioned and
less confident of our own power as
agents of the future.
Additionally, the increasing gap be
tween rich and poor in our country, cou
pled with growing resentment toward
the United States' international muscle
tactics by nations we consider our allies
— not counting already existing anti-
U.S. sentiment in other parts of the world
— has left us with a greater sense of "Us
and Them" both domestically and inter
nationally. This has, I believe, decreased
our sense of responsibility toothers. Cer
tainly the Carnegie-Rockefeller-Mor
gan days of philanthropy are over. Bill
Gates — and maybe Oprah Winfrey —
are the only visible individual philan
thropic tycoons of today.
It is possible, too, (as many parents
would attest) that we are simply lazier —
products of comfortable times. I am left
to wonder whether the absence of a pas
sionate cause will be the signature of our
generation. With a lengthy and uncertain
war against terrorism, the immense and
unsafe task of rebuilding Iraq, the prolif
eration of nuclear weapons, our destruc
tion of the environment, ongoing conflict
in the Middle East and the AIDS epi
demic ravaging the African continent,
what will it take to turn this around?

Consider the following conversa
tion I was privy to recently.
Guy: "I know this guy who.
like, shaved the hair off his nut
sack." Girl: "Eww! Why did he do that?
I mean, didn't it hurt?" Guy: "1 dunno...
hair there is weird. It's, like, sparse and
sort of spiky."
The conversation proceeded to ex
plore the negative ramifications of this
seemingly senseless act of vanity, name
ly, rashes and ingrown hairs. Interesting?
Perhaps... in a "There's Something
About Mary" sort of way. More impor
tantly, though, this snippet of a conversa
tion demonstrates the levity typical of ev
eryday student exchanges on campus.
Human nature dictates that we all en
gage in such persiflage. But these super
ficial exchanges seem too often today to
replace discussion of more meaningful
matters. We take little intellectual inter
est in discussing political, social or moral
issues. Accusations of social and political
apathy among our generation are
widespread. Impassioned debate recent
ly erupted at Princeton University over
an article written by its University Coun
cil in one of the school's publications. The
article suggested that student participa
tion in intellectual life on campus is lack
luster. That concern is certainly preva
lent here within the "Stanford bubble."
What is responsible for this disturb
ing trend of anti-intellectualism? Maybe
the PC-ness of the 1990s and today make
us afraid of discussing sensitive issues
among people we don't know well, when
candid dialogue is often most needed. In
a world of increasing litigation, we are
scared to be held liable for our words.
Many point to the obvious suspect —
television. Surely the copious amounts of
mindless junk regularly emitted from the
boob tube decrease our capacity for in
tellectual interests and pursuits. Surely

TV is the Big Bad Villain, surely. Maybe
TV plays a part. But I think the roots go
much deeper.
I must here draw a distinction be
tween anti-intellectualism and apathy.
Although separate, they are trends that
fuel each other. Let's first look at our
parents and grandparents. Our parents
were children of the 1 9605, champions of
nonconformity and civil rights. Our
grandparents lived through the Great
Depression and World War 11. Unlike
them, we have not in our lifetimes unit
ed as agents of change or lived through
especially trying social or political
events. Perhaps the events of Sept. 11,
2001, and the effort to rebuild Iraq will
change this. Major political and social
movements of the twentieth century
were born of a fundamental intellectual
idea or belief that is lacking in today's
arenas — communism. Kennedy's liber
al movement and passive resistance, to
name a few. These ideas exemplify the
marriage of intellect and involvement.
Our twentieth century predecessors em
braced or rejected philosophies at the
core of these movements with a sense of
urgency and immediacy remarkably ab
sent today. We lack the quintessential
idealism of youth. Not everyone, of
course —such blanket statements ring
hollow. But generally, we seem more
cynical than our parents were at our age.
Since we have faced no crisis, shouldn't
we be more idealistic? Or did the cushy
1990s somehow leave us disaffected?
The past 20-some years have wit
nessed unprecedented prosperity that
saw the tech boom in Silicon Valley and
rapid growth in the fields of medicine
and science. The United States was un
stoppable. Amid our Cabbage Patch
Dolls and Transformers, Reagan opti
mism, Madonna, Family Ties, the fall of
the Berlin Wall, the Gulf War, Nirvana,

the advent of yuppies and a booming
economy, we developed an acute aware
ness of a salient fact: Money equals
power. Rarely is it effective these days to
run around championing a cause if we
cannot win the support of political fac
tions through monetary contributions.
The political machinations of our plutoc
racy have left us more disillusioned and
less confident of our own power as
agents of the future.
Additionally, the increasing gap be
tween rich and poor in our country, cou
pled with growing resentment toward
the United States' international muscle
tactics by nations we consider our allies
— not counting already existing anti-
U.S. sentiment in other parts of the world
— has left us with a greater sense of "Us
and Them" both domestically and inter
nationally. This has, I believe, decreased
our sense of responsibility toothers. Cer
tainly the Carnegie-Rockefeller-Mor
gan days of philanthropy are over. Bill
Gates — and maybe Oprah Winfrey —
are the only visible individual philan
thropic tycoons of today.
It is possible, too, (as many parents
would attest) that we are simply lazier —
products of comfortable times. I am left
to wonder whether the absence of a pas
sionate cause will be the signature of our
generation. With a lengthy and uncertain
war against terrorism, the immense and
unsafe task of rebuilding Iraq, the prolif
eration of nuclear weapons, our destruc
tion of the environment, ongoing conflict
in the Middle East and the AIDS epi
demic ravaging the African continent,
what will it take to turn this around?
