## Students need to take initiative when job-searching; CDC can help 
### LANCE CHOY 
During the course of this academic year,
The Daily has published eight articles / edi
torials regarding the Career Development
Center (CDC) that have contained errors,
misquotations and erroneous assumptions. I
am particularly concerned that some of the
viewpoints expressed in The Daily have
caused unnecessary frustration and anxiety
among Stanford students. Specifically, a few
of the articles have presented a skewed per
spective regarding the CDC's efforts to in
crease both the number and diversity of em
ployers who recruit Stanford students and
the relative importance of career fairs in the
job search process. I would like to provide a
more accurate perspective regarding these
comments.
1) Marketing to employers: First, I want
students and The Daily to know that the
CDC is committed to increasing the num
ber and diversity of employers who recruit
at Stanford. As it has in the past, the CDC
will continue to proactively contact thou
sands of employers in an effort to attract

them to campus.
2) Employers on campus: The desire to
have employers from a wide variety of ca
reer fields attend career fairs and come to
campus to conduct interviews is understand
able. However, students need to realize that
most employers are not interested in re
cruiting on any college campus. The reasons
are varied. It costs too much, takes too much
staff time, uses company resources ineffi
ciently, etc. While there are certain types of
employers who find an on-campus presence
worthwhile, employers in general expect
students to demonstrate their interests and
motivation through direct contact.
An editor of a local newspaper told me
that he is too busy to recruit at college cam
puses. When a job opening occurs, the can
didate whose resume is on his desk or whose
resume was given to him by one of his re
porters has an excellent chance of being con
tacted for an interview. He says that if a job
applicant cannot demonstrate the initiative
and resourcefulness to get his resume to
him, he's not interested in interviewing that
individual. This employer echoes the senti

ments of many other employers. Students
must be proactive and be prepared to con
tact employers directly for jobs.
Stanford graduates benefit from a won
derful education and a rich array of experi
ences. This doesn't offset the fact that
searching fora job will require time and ef
fort. Students need to take the time to re
search the world of work, learn how to artic
ulate the skills and abilities they have devel
oped and learn how to approach employers
effectively. (Submitting to job postings on
the web is rarely the best way to find a job).
While this may be a daunting task for some,
the good news is that the CDC is available to
assist students with each step of the process.
3) Career fairs versus networking: The
Daily's focus and emphasis on career fairs as
a major part of the job search process is mis
leading. Careers fairs can be very helpful to
some students if the types of companies in
which they have an interest view these
events as a feasible / cost effective recruiting
method. The reality, however, is that career
fairs are but one tool, among many others,
for pursing employment opportunities. The

CDC's survey of graduating students indi
cates that typically seven to 15 percent of
students will find employment through ca
reer fairs, 10 to 20 percent will secure em
ployment through the on-campus recruiting
program, 10 to 20 percent will find jobs
through job postings on the Internet and 40
percent will find a job through some form of
networking with alumni, students, faculty,
previous coworkers, friends or relatives.
Contrary to what The Daily implied in its
most recent editorial on the CDC ("Career
week does little to help fuzzies,' " Jan. 29),
networking — and not career fairs —
should play the central role in students' job
search strategy. I know that networking is a
time-consuming and sometimes uncomfort
able activity, but it is the most effective
method of finding job opportunities. This is
no secret. For some companies, referrals by
current employees can constitute as much as
80 percent of their hires. Job experts have
suggested that up to 70 percent of job open
ings are never posted. Networking is the
means to access these opportunities.
To this end, the CDC and the Stanford

Alumni Association provide a number of re
sources and programs to assist students with
the process of networking. From a job
search standpoint, an active network of
alumni willing to act as contacts is probably
the most important resource a student can
have. I encourage students to explore these
resources, if they haven't already done so.
Different types of employers recruit dif
ferently. You need to research employers
in order to develop the most effective job
search strategy for that particular employ
er. Are there certain professional associa
tions that you must join? Are there specific
Web sites that post occupation-specific
jobs? Are there entry-level positions at
which you must start? Tailoring your job
search to achieve your goals is part of the
career planning process. Let the career
counselors and the vast resources of the
CDC help you as you craft your plans. We
really can help you explore, connect, and
do great things.

able. However, students need to realize that
most employers are not interested in re
cruiting on any college campus. The reasons
are varied. It costs too much, takes too much
staff time, uses company resources ineffi
ciently, etc. While there are certain types of
employers who find an on-campus presence
worthwhile, employers in general expect
students to demonstrate their interests and
motivation through direct contact.
An editor of a local newspaper told me
that he is too busy to recruit at college cam
puses. When a job opening occurs, the can
didate whose resume is on his desk or whose
resume was given to him by one of his re
porters has an excellent chance of being con
tacted for an interview. He says that if a job
applicant cannot demonstrate the initiative
and resourcefulness to get his resume to
him, he's not interested in interviewing that
individual. This employer echoes the senti

ments of many other employers. Students
must be proactive and be prepared to con
tact employers directly for jobs.
Stanford graduates benefit from a won
derful education and a rich array of experi
ences. This doesn't offset the fact that
searching fora job will require time and ef
fort. Students need to take the time to re
search the world of work, learn how to artic
ulate the skills and abilities they have devel
oped and learn how to approach employers
effectively. (Submitting to job postings on
the web is rarely the best way to find a job).
While this may be a daunting task for some,
the good news is that the CDC is available to
assist students with each step of the process.
3) Career fairs versus networking: The
Daily's focus and emphasis on career fairs as
a major part of the job search process is mis
leading. Careers fairs can be very helpful to
some students if the types of companies in
which they have an interest view these
events as a feasible / cost effective recruiting
method. The reality, however, is that career
fairs are but one tool, among many others,
for pursing employment opportunities. The

CDC's survey of graduating students indi
cates that typically seven to 15 percent of
students will find employment through ca
reer fairs, 10 to 20 percent will secure em
ployment through the on-campus recruiting
program, 10 to 20 percent will find jobs
through job postings on the Internet and 40
percent will find a job through some form of
networking with alumni, students, faculty,
previous coworkers, friends or relatives.
Contrary to what The Daily implied in its
most recent editorial on the CDC ("Career
week does little to help fuzzies,' " Jan. 29),
networking — and not career fairs —
should play the central role in students' job
search strategy. I know that networking is a
time-consuming and sometimes uncomfort
able activity, but it is the most effective
method of finding job opportunities. This is
no secret. For some companies, referrals by
current employees can constitute as much as
80 percent of their hires. Job experts have
suggested that up to 70 percent of job open
ings are never posted. Networking is the
means to access these opportunities.
To this end, the CDC and the Stanford

Alumni Association provide a number of re
sources and programs to assist students with
the process of networking. From a job
search standpoint, an active network of
alumni willing to act as contacts is probably
the most important resource a student can
have. I encourage students to explore these
resources, if they haven't already done so.
Different types of employers recruit dif
ferently. You need to research employers
in order to develop the most effective job
search strategy for that particular employ
er. Are there certain professional associa
tions that you must join? Are there specific
Web sites that post occupation-specific
jobs? Are there entry-level positions at
which you must start? Tailoring your job
search to achieve your goals is part of the
career planning process. Let the career
counselors and the vast resources of the
CDC help you as you craft your plans. We
really can help you explore, connect, and
do great things.

During the course of this academic year,
The Daily has published eight articles / edi
torials regarding the Career Development
Center (CDC) that have contained errors,
misquotations and erroneous assumptions. I
am particularly concerned that some of the
viewpoints expressed in The Daily have
caused unnecessary frustration and anxiety
among Stanford students. Specifically, a few
of the articles have presented a skewed per
spective regarding the CDC's efforts to in
crease both the number and diversity of em
ployers who recruit Stanford students and
the relative importance of career fairs in the
job search process. I would like to provide a
more accurate perspective regarding these
comments.
1) Marketing to employers: First, I want
students and The Daily to know that the
CDC is committed to increasing the num
ber and diversity of employers who recruit
at Stanford. As it has in the past, the CDC
will continue to proactively contact thou
sands of employers in an effort to attract

them to campus.
2) Employers on campus: The desire to
have employers from a wide variety of ca
reer fields attend career fairs and come to
campus to conduct interviews is understand
able. However, students need to realize that
most employers are not interested in re
cruiting on any college campus. The reasons
are varied. It costs too much, takes too much
staff time, uses company resources ineffi
ciently, etc. While there are certain types of
employers who find an on-campus presence
worthwhile, employers in general expect
