# Asst. dean marries same-sex couples in San Francisco
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
The City of San Francisco became the
focus of national media attention last
Thursday when Mayor Gavin Newsom
ordered City Hall officials to grant mar
riage licenses to same-sex couples.
Newsom also ordered officials to keep
City Hall open over the weekend and into
President's Day in order to accommodate
as many couples as possible. Couples
lined up all weekend in an attempt to beat
out two injunction requests filed by two
separate anti-same-sex marriage groups
that could put a halt to the ceremonies if
the judges rule in their favor today.
All of these marriages were made pos
sible by city officials and others who vol
unteered their time over the holiday
weekend.
One of the people performing cere
monies inside City Hall's rotunda was
Stanford's Assistant Dean and Director of
the Asian American Activities Center
Rick Yuen.
Yuen become deputized and sworn in
by the San Francisco County Clerk as a
Deputy Marriage Commissioner, and
since then, he has married so many cou
ples that he has lost count.
"I haven't counted them all but it's
been over 100, but I've been marrying
couples from Friday evening until today,"
Yuen said on Monday.
In fact, one of the couples that Yuen
performed a marriage ceremony for yes
terday was Ben Davidson, assistant dean
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Com
munity Center, and his partner.
San Francisco's City Hall marries 30
couples on average a day. However, since
last Thursday, over 2,300 same-sex cou

pies have married. Yesterday alone, ap
proximately 750 couples tied the knot â€” a
City Hall record.
Yuen compared the civil rights battle
for same-sex marriages to the battle for
interracial marriages and also noted
that many of the couples that married
this weekend had been partners for over
25 years.
"It's really an issue of love between
two committed individuals who are in
love and a question of what's equitable,"
Yuen said. "Interracial marriages were
not legal as of 50 years ago, and it is the
same situation here. In the name of equi
ty and justice and love, the laws against
same-sex couples marrying should be
changed. San Francisco is recognizing
that and I want to be a part of that for
ward motion."
Yuen's wife, San Francisco County
Assessor and Recorder Mabel Teng, has
been very involved in the same-sex mar
riage ceremonies; her signature makes
each of the granted marriage certificates
legal.
Addressing those waiting in line yes
terday in City Hall, Teng said, "I want to
thank you for bringing so much joy and
love to City Hall. For those of you who
tied a knot, congratulations. May you
have a lifetime of happiness together."
Members of the Stanford community
expressed their excitement about the
course of events in San Francisco.
Laura Harrison, assistant dean and di
rector of the Women's Center, had a com
mitment ceremony with her same-sex
partner a year ago in Stanford Memorial
Church. Although she did not participate
in a marriage ceremony this weekend, she
says that she and her partner plan on
doing it in the future.
"A lot of young people don't
understand what a significant civil
right this is because they are not
yet at the point in life where mari
tal rights are important, for exam
ple when buying a house togeth
er," Harrison said.

Harrison also noted that legaliz
ing same-sex marriages could at
tract more gay and lesbian faculty
and staff to Stanford as one of the
areas in the country that is passing
progressive legislation in that
realm.
Sophomore Abe Nachbaur said,
"It is about time that San Francisco
started granting gay-marriage cer
tificates and I am proud that mem
bers of the Stanford community are
at the forefront of legalizing gay
marriage. This is a bold step for the
gay-rights movement."
