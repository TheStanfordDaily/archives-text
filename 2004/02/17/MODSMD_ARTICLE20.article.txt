V-Day coordinators exhibit sexism
It's one thing to work to stop rape. It's
something else, however, when radical femi
nists brand every male as a potential rapist.
Wrapping fraternity houses in "Rape Free
Zone" tape ("Confronting Sexual Assault,"
Feb. 12) may get Stanford's V-Day coordina
tors a sound bite on the evening news, but it is
really just another form of gender-based, anti
male hate speech. Too bad the University
lacks the moral fortitude to speak out against
such blatant male-bashing.
What makes this ugly display even more
ironic is that the V-Day coordinators are also
staging a performance of "The Vagina Mono
logues," a play that features a scene glorifying
the lesbian rape of an underage girl.
It's time for the pendulum to start swinging
back, because it's gone too far in one direction.

Flat-rate laundry program a bad idea
I was appalled to read that all students

were being taxed fora personal service that
they use in greatly different quantities
("Trustees approve laundry plan set to start
next fall," Feb. 13).
If it is such a good idea to charge a flat rate
for the laundry service, why not make the food
service similarly priced? For some reason the
food service is efficiently operated by offering
varying levels of participation and even the op
tion of opting out altogether. Why not the laun
dry service?
Further, when the ASSU and Student
Housing polled "randomly selected" stu
dents, one of their findings was that Bran
ner staff would prefer new appliances to
older ones.
Could it be that the decision was made to pur
chase new appliances and then the justification
(every student pays) was found to pay for them?
This type of decision making leads to poor
decisions.

Stanford basketball deserves its #1
ranking for its talent and its heart

I'd like to congratulate the Stanford men's
basketball team, who just earned the Associat
ed Press' No. 1 ranking in the nation. As a long
time fan of Stanford basketball, I'm incredibly
proud of this team — not because it's No. 1 but
because it has got more character and grit than
any other team in the nation. I nominate this
team as the "All-Mark-Madsen Team."
Madsen, Class of 2000, was not the most
athletic player to wear a Stanford uniform
but he was probably the grittiest, toughest
and most determined. He was always sports
manlike after he knocked you silly. Due in
large part to these qualities, the Los Ange
les Lakers picked Madsen in the first round
of the NBA draft during Madsen's senior
year. This season at Stanford, the entire
Stanford team is playing with the same spir
it. They're a very talented group, but what
you really notice when watching the games
is their teamwork and fiery determination
to win, a la Madsen.
The bench often plays as tough as the
starters. We've seen the bench spark critical
Stanford runs when the starters were strug
gling. When has that ever happened for Stan
ford before?

My favorite statistic from Saturday's
game against UC-Berkeley was Stanford's
18 assists on 22 field goals. That is TEAM
play. This is not a team where a single NBA
bound shooting guard sets up plays with a
talented center, while everybody else just
runs screens.
The last Stanford team with a spirit like this
year's team has was the 1997-1998 team that
shocked the nation and went to the Final Four
of the NCAA tournament. And that Stanford
team wasn't as talented or deep as this year's
team. While I think the odds are against Stan
ford winning it all, this is a team you can't count
out. And far more than any team I've seen, it is
one that makes me proud to say "I'm a Stanford
Cardinal fan."

Cheng should not invoke extreme examples
We would like to applaud Enrique Cheng
for his letter ("SAE should not be 'favored' in
Daily editorial," Feb. 12) regarding The Stan
ford Daily's editorial "SAE's Doubleheader a

Success" (Feb. 11). While it is presumptuous
to speak on behalf of our peers, it is our belief
that the rest of campus — including those stu
dents from the Washington, D.C. area —
would join us in our praise of Cheng's letter.
The Daily supporting SAE's removal from al
cohol probation is as bad as (if not worse than)
The Washington Post supporting John
Muhammad and John Lee Malvo's release
from prison. The threat of Palo Alto High
School students sneaking into a "pajama
party" and drinking a few beers is tantamount
to the release of serial killers. After all. the po
tential of a second reign of terror by two men
who have been convicted of ten murders is less
disturbing than the reign of sketchy frat guys
over the Stanford social scene. Furthermore,
giving praise to one fraternity while ignoring
the efforts of countless other houses, is
equivalent to speaking out in defense of
Apartheid or the Rwandan genocide.

really just another form of gender-based, anti
male hate speech. Too bad the University
lacks the moral fortitude to speak out against
such blatant male-bashing.
What makes this ugly display even more
ironic is that the V-Day coordinators are also
staging a performance of "The Vagina Mono
logues," a play that features a scene glorifying
the lesbian rape of an underage girl.
It's time for the pendulum to start swinging
back, because it's gone too far in one direction.

Flat-rate laundry program a bad idea
I was appalled to read that all students

were being taxed fora personal service that
they use in greatly different quantities
("Trustees approve laundry plan set to start
next fall," Feb. 13).
If it is such a good idea to charge a flat rate
for the laundry service, why not make the food
service similarly priced? For some reason the
food service is efficiently operated by offering
varying levels of participation and even the op
tion of opting out altogether. Why not the laun
dry service?
Further, when the ASSU and Student
Housing polled "randomly selected" stu
dents, one of their findings was that Bran
ner staff would prefer new appliances to
older ones.
Could it be that the decision was made to pur
chase new appliances and then the justification
(every student pays) was found to pay for them?
This type of decision making leads to poor
decisions.

Stanford basketball deserves its #1
ranking for its talent and its heart

I'd like to congratulate the Stanford men's
basketball team, who just earned the Associat
ed Press' No. 1 ranking in the nation. As a long
time fan of Stanford basketball, I'm incredibly
proud of this team — not because it's No. 1 but
because it has got more character and grit than
any other team in the nation. I nominate this
team as the "All-Mark-Madsen Team."
Madsen, Class of 2000, was not the most
athletic player to wear a Stanford uniform
but he was probably the grittiest, toughest
and most determined. He was always sports
manlike after he knocked you silly. Due in
large part to these qualities, the Los Ange
les Lakers picked Madsen in the first round
of the NBA draft during Madsen's senior
year. This season at Stanford, the entire
Stanford team is playing with the same spir
it. They're a very talented group, but what
you really notice when watching the games
is their teamwork and fiery determination
to win, a la Madsen.
The bench often plays as tough as the
starters. We've seen the bench spark critical
Stanford runs when the starters were strug
gling. When has that ever happened for Stan
ford before?

My favorite statistic from Saturday's
game against UC-Berkeley was Stanford's
18 assists on 22 field goals. That is TEAM
play. This is not a team where a single NBA
bound shooting guard sets up plays with a
talented center, while everybody else just
runs screens.
The last Stanford team with a spirit like this
year's team has was the 1997-1998 team that
shocked the nation and went to the Final Four
of the NCAA tournament. And that Stanford
team wasn't as talented or deep as this year's
team. While I think the odds are against Stan
ford winning it all, this is a team you can't count
out. And far more than any team I've seen, it is
one that makes me proud to say "I'm a Stanford
Cardinal fan."

Cheng should not invoke extreme examples
We would like to applaud Enrique Cheng
for his letter ("SAE should not be 'favored' in
Daily editorial," Feb. 12) regarding The Stan
ford Daily's editorial "SAE's Doubleheader a

Success" (Feb. 11). While it is presumptuous
to speak on behalf of our peers, it is our belief
that the rest of campus — including those stu
dents from the Washington, D.C. area —
would join us in our praise of Cheng's letter.
The Daily supporting SAE's removal from al
cohol probation is as bad as (if not worse than)
The Washington Post supporting John
Muhammad and John Lee Malvo's release
from prison. The threat of Palo Alto High
School students sneaking into a "pajama
party" and drinking a few beers is tantamount
to the release of serial killers. After all. the po
tential of a second reign of terror by two men
who have been convicted of ten murders is less
disturbing than the reign of sketchy frat guys
over the Stanford social scene. Furthermore,
giving praise to one fraternity while ignoring
the efforts of countless other houses, is
equivalent to speaking out in defense of
Apartheid or the Rwandan genocide.

V-Day coordinators exhibit sexism
It's one thing to work to stop rape. It's
something else, however, when radical femi
nists brand every male as a potential rapist.
Wrapping fraternity houses in "Rape Free
Zone" tape ("Confronting Sexual Assault,"
Feb. 12) may get Stanford's V-Day coordina
tors a sound bite on the evening news, but it is
really just another form of gender-based, anti
male hate speech. Too bad the University
