## Spencer's take on the Top Ten Sports Movies 
### 
You can whisper it. That's all I'll
allow. No talking about it, no
screaming it in lecture, no stalking
Chris Hernandez.
Just a whisper.
(Quietly) "We're No. 1!"
Now shush. Not another word. No signs at
games, no awkward conversations with Matt Lot
tich in the bookstore, and don't you even dare to
say the word "undefea .... "
There's only one thing you can say: "Let's win
the next game."
But let's not overblow it. No more talk about it.
Let's give you something else to discuss.
After all, it's February, also known as the most
boring month in sports. It's the month when
ESPN.com hosts the "Hottest Female Athlete"
contest (Heather Mitts over Jennie Finch in a
shocker... a 2-to-l victory ... ewww), and when
Friday Columnist Julie Ruvolo writes about pea
cock hunting. Peacock Hunting? What the — ?
So it's time lor something different. It's some-

thing I've wanted to do fora long
time. It's my list of the Top 10
All-Time Sports Movies.
First, some criteria. The
movie has to be about a sport.
There can't be any love story
that takes a absurdly long time
to develop (sorry, "Jerry
Maguire" and "Bull Durham").
Sequels and so on will be treat
ed all as one movie, and all ter
ribleness associated with a se-

quel will be averaged into the series. Finally, all
movies starring a non-human as the main charac
ter are NOT up for consideration (sorry, "Air-
Bud," "Most Valuable Primate" and Whoopi
Goldberg).
Also, keep in mind that I haven't yet seen
"Miracle," which I really hope is tremendous,
and that late 80s / present day movies will be
featured prominently. Why? Because it's my
damn list.
10) "The Mighty Ducks." A truly great movie.
"One, two, three. Triple Deke!" Money in the
bank. Unfortunately, two absolutely horrid se
quels followed this Emilio Estevez classic and
doomed the original for eternity.
9) "Happy Gilmore." I had to choose only one
golf movie to be on this list, and I don't like "Cad
dyshack." Call me crazy, but it just didn't speak to
me. However, Adam Sandler fighting an alliga
tor, his own caddy and Bob Barker? Where do I
sign up?
8) "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken." Stop
laughing. This movie is awesome. And don't you
dare say that horse diving isn't a sport. Just think
about young Sonora that who overcomes her
blindness and jumps on that horse for that final
dive. I know I was bawling like all hell. I was also
9 years old.
7) "Hoosiers." In all honesty, 1 don't really like
this movie much. Owed in large part to the fact
that I saw "Crimson Tide" before it, I kept ex
pecting Gene Hackman to take us to DEFCON 2.
That and the gold short shorts (ewww) — just not
my movie. But it must be here.
6) "Major League." Where do I start? Com
bine Tom Berenger (yeah, get excited, Tom
Berenger!), Charlie Sheen as "Wild Thing" and a
hilarious Bob Uecker, and you have a classic. But
replace Wesley Snipes in the sequel and you've
lost it all.
5) "Little Big League." That's right, this is the
one about the kid who inherits the Twins. Yeah,
that's right, it probably has some of the worst dia
logue this side of "From Justin to Kelly." But
here's the difference: in the Big Game, where
Charlie's Ducks, Berenger's Indians and Hack
man's Hoosiers always come out on top, the Twins
lose — and you still feel blown away.
4) "Bad News Bears." Is there a better scene
than Walter Matthau getting the kids drunk on
malt liquor after going for it all and coming up just
a bit short? No, that's life. Kids settle for medi
ocrity and getting drunk on the weekends.
3) "Rocky." This series would be ranked much
higher if not for the god-awful "Rocky III,"
"Rocky V" and proposed box-office flop "Rocky
VI." However. Rocky single-handedly ending the
Cold War with the immortal plea to the USSR, "I
guess what I'm trying to say is, if I can change and
you can change, everybody can change," is just
(time to pause and reflect) so true. So true.
2)"Rudy." I could watch this movie for the rest
of my life on constant repeat. It's that good. I still
cry every time Rudy opens his Notre Dame ac
ceptance letter, still get chills when he sacks the
Georgia Tech quarterback, still smile when Rudy
is carried off the field. Sean Astin, you will forev
er be my hero.
1) "Field of Dreams." "The one constant
through all the years, Ray, has been baseball.
America has rolled by like an army of steam
rollers. It has been erased like a blackboard, re
built and erased again. But baseball has marked
the time. This field, this game: it's a part of our
past, Ray. It reminds of us of all that once was
good and it could be again. Oh ... people will
come Ray. People will most definitely come."
1 am an American Studies major. I am a base
ball fan. Watch "Field of Dreams," and just try
and tell me they aren't related.
Anything to save you from telling the Stanford
basketball team they're undefeated.

Spencer Porter is a sentimental junior who reads
too much of ESPN's page 2. He should have voted
for Jamie Sale as the hottest female athlete, but he
doesn 't watch enough figure skating to know just
how hot she really is. E-mail him at portersGPstan
ford.edu to ask him how his quarter abroad is
treating him.
