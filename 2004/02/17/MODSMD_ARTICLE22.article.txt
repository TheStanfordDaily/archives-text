# No. 10 Cardinal downs Cal
## 
### EMILY KUEHLEK DESK EDITOR 
It wasn't the prettiest win and it wasn't the
blowout win one might have wanted, but it
was a win.
Coming off a disastrous trip to Arizona last
weekend, a win was exactly what the doctor
ordered for the No. 10 Stanford women's bas
ketball team (18-5, 11-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence), which defeated California (9-14, 2-12)
at home on Saturday, 61-53.
"This was a big win for our team after com
ing out and not playing as well as we wanted to
last week," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer."We have to keep working on better
passing, better execution on offense and I
don't think we worked as hard defensively as
we have to."
The Cardinal tallied 20 turnovers — a
problem that has plagued the team all season
— but was still able to hand the Bears their
10th straight loss.
Stanford did just enough to hold off Cal
throughout the game. Altera six-minute, 12-3
run ending with 3:51 left in the first half that
gave the Cardinal a 25-16 advantage, the
Bears went on a mini-run of their own to pull
within five at the close of the opening period
— and they certainly weren't going to just
fade away in the second half.
Cal came out strong in the second half and
twice pulled to within just one point, first after
back-to-back treys by junior forward Kiki
Williams and then on a layup by junior for
ward Leigh Gregory with 15:34 left, but Stan
ford answered with a two-minute, 7-0 run
capped by a Sebnem Kimyacioglu 3-pointer.
Cal still refused to go away, chipping away
at the Cardinal lead until it was just two after
a LaTasha O'Keith layup. And with All-
American senior forward Nicole Powell
struggling from the field, the Golden Bears
looked to have a golden opportunity.
However, junior guard Susan Borchardt
stepped up her game and scored five straight
points for the Cardinal, breaking Cal's press
fora coast-to-coast layup and then burying a
three-pointer on Stanford's next possession to
give the Cardinal a seven-point edge.

Borchardt's burst of scoring swung mo
mentum in Stanford's direction and the Car
dinal clung to it for the rest of the game, build
ing a lead of as many as 12 points after a free
throw by junior guard Kelley Suminski.
"We didn't really bust out," said Van-
Derveer. "And we didn't put a big spurt on."
The Cardinal's victory was punctuated by
balanced scoring and the team's success de
spite a "quiet" day from Powell, who finished
with 12 points, nine boards and five assists.
"We can't depend on one person to carry
us," said VanDerveer. "And that's what ev
eryone said. T'Nae [Thiel] said 'I'll help out,'
and Susan [Borchardt] pushed it, and I
thought Kelley [Suminski) and Azella (Perry
man | played well."
The foursome did far more than just
"help out."
Thiel, the usually defensive-minded junior
forward, had an offensive explosion, shooting
a near-perfect 8-for-9 from the field to lead all
scorers with 16 points. She also added five re
bounds and a blocked shot.
"It's definitely a goal of mine to make my
self available in the offense, not just as a
screener," Thiel said. "So I was just posting up
and getting the ball on the block."
Despite making it sound easy. Thiel's effi
cient play down low was something that had
been missing from Stanford's offense in re
cent games.
"We did a really good job of getting the ball
inside [on Saturday]," VanDerveer said.
"That's the difference for us between this
game and the Arizona State game or even the
Arizona game. T'Nae or Azella have to be the
first option coming down on offense."
Borchardt and Suminski added 14 and 11
points, respectively. And Perryman — who
logged 22 minutes on a sprained ankle —
scored only two points, but more than made
up for it by pulling down a game-high 11 re
bounds and recording three steals.
The hobbling Cardinal post was also with
out freshman Kristen Newlin. who missed her
fourth straight game with a bone bruise to her
knee. Newlin is expected back for next
week's matchups with UCLA and Southern
California.
