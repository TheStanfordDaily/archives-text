# Hoops takes top spot in polls
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In the course of this season, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team has been called special, perfect and unde
feated. On Monday, voters from the Associated Press
and ESPN / USA Today polls added a new superlative
to the list: No. J.
The Cardinal (21 -0) moved into the top spot in both
national polls after Duke lost to North Carolina State
on Sunday, 78-74. The Blue Devils (21-2) had held the
No. 1 ranking for four weeks on the strength of an 18-
game win streak and victories over several nationally
ranked Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. They al
most mounted a last-minute comeback, closing a seem
ingly insurmountable deficit to within a field goal of a
tie in the closing minute. Wolfpack fans preparing to
rush the court watched in horror as Duke hit a pair of
long threes and forced turnovers, but the nation's best
tree-throw shooting team hit its foul shots at the end
and held on for the upset.

Stanford is followed in the polls by Saint Joseph's, a
small Jesuit college (enrollment 3,850) in Philadelphia
that is having its best season in almost 40 years. Led by
All-America Candidates Jameer Nelson and Delonte
West — often referred to as the nation's best backcourt
tandem — the Hawks (22-0) are the only other unde
feated team in Division I college basketball.
The national attention that comes with a No. 1
ranking shouldn't be new to the Cardinal. The team
reached that mark for five weeks in the 1999-00 season
and for seven weeks in the 2000-01 season. And this
year's Stanford squad has already grown accustomed
to the glare of the national spotlight because of its un
defeated record.
Stanford and Saint Joseph's have compiled the
longest winning streaks to begin a season since Kansas
started 22-0 in 1997. The last team to finish its regular
season unbeaten was UNLV in 1991. In 2001, Stanford
went 20-0 en route to a 31-3 final record and a loss to
Maryland in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.
This year, Stanford's players and coaches have artic

ulated a motto to deal with the inevitable pressure:
"We don't expect to go undefeated, we just don't want
to lose the next one."
• As for the No. 1 ranking, junior Josh Childress told
the Associated Press that the team welcomes the
recognition.
"It lets us know that we're working hard, and people
are respecting us, and we're doing something right,"
Childress said.
Stanford garnered 64 first-place votes in the Associ
ated Press media poll, and Saint Joseph's received the
other eight. In the ESPM / USA Today coaches' poll,
Stanford got 26 first-place votes, while Saint Joseph's
had four and Duke had one. The Blue Devils are
ranked third in both polls.
The Associated Press poll ranks Mississippi State
(21-1) fourth and Pittsburgh (23-2) fifth, while those
rankings are reversed in the ESPN / USA Today poll.
Arizona (No. 14 AP, No. 13 ESPN / USA Today) is the
only Pacific-10 Conference team aside from Stanford
ranked in either poll's Top 25.
