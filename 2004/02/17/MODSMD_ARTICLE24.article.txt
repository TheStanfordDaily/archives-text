## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Over the past month, the
Stanford wrestling team has
experienced its fair share of
nail-biters and blowouts, but

nary a Cardinal loss. Last
weekend was no exception, as
Stanford (10-4, 6-2 Pacific-10
Conference) came from be
hind to defeat UC-Davis 21-
15 on Friday night before
pummeling Portland State at

home on Saturday, 42-3, to
wrap up the dual meet season
as winners of seven straight.
Coming off close wins over
Oregon State and Fresno
State, the Cardinal rallied
from a 12-point deficit by win

ning the final five bouts
against Davis. Freshman
Brian Perry gave Stanford its
first lead with an 8-7 decision
over Mike Font in the penulti
mate bout of the night and
sophomore Imad Kharbush
sealed the deal with a 13-6 de
cision over Daniel Price.
Kharbush's win avenged a loss
to Price at the Aggie Open in
January.
Davis, which defeated the
Cardinal 24-11 last season,
gained the early momentum in
front of its home crowd as
Brandon Bear, No. 2 in the
Pac-10 at 184 pounds, defeat
ed Stanford senior John
Garfinkel 11-4 before Stan
ford sophomore Larry
Ozowara rebounded with a
17-10 decision at 197.
The Aggies won the next
three bouts, however, includ
ing a questionable pin by the
Pac-10's top wrestler at 125
pounds. Tommy Schurkamp.
Stanford freshman Tanner
Gardner held a 4-2 lead and
was riding Schurkamp with
just four seconds to go in the
third and final period when
the official called a defensive
pin after Schurkamp grabbed
Gardner's head.
After another narrow de
feat and with the Cardinal
trailing 15-3, Stanford co-cap

tain junior Brad Metzler
turned things around in his
bout at 141 pounds, polishing
his opponent off in 27 seconds
with a pin, his fifth of the sea
son.
"I really forced the pin in
an effort to change the mo
mentum of the dual [match],"
Metzler said. "I knew 1 could
pin the kid and was hoping
that it would re-energize the
guys following me."
It did.
Stanford sophomore Luis
Vendrell followed with his
19th win of the season, a 7-5
decision at 149, and junior co
captain Matt Gentry, No. 2 in
the nation at 157 pounds, de
feated defending Pac-10
champion Jeremiah Jarvis 9-3
to knot the team score at 15-
15 and set up Perry and Khar
bush's decisive victories.
The Cardinal returned
home on Saturday night for its
final dual meet of the season,
winning nine of 10 bouts
against Portland State.
Kharbush set the tone
early, opening the meet with a
pin in 3:47. After Garfinkel
won via forfeit, Ozowara com
pleted a two-win weekend by
turning what appeared to be a

tory in double overtime.
Ozowara, who finished 5-2 in dual
meet competition this season,
scored a takedown with one sec
ond left on the clock to force the
first extra period.
Stanford heavyweight sopho
more Shawn Ritzenthaler picked
up his first dual meet win since
Jan. 31 in convincing fashion
with an 11-3 major decision. Fol
lowing another Portland State
forfeit, Stanford senior Paul
Gross, wrestling in the final dual
meet of his collegiate career,
downed the Vikings' Lucas
Hamilton, 16-4, for his 12th win
of the season.
Metzler tallied a major deci

sion before Vendrell took the
only loss of the night for the Car
dinal, 5-3. Gentry won by forfeit
to keep his undefeated season in
tact. His 34 wins are just one shy
of his total as a freshman.
In addition to starters Metzler,
Garfinkel and Gross, Saturday's
meet was also the final one for
Stanford seniors Brendon Fox,
Marcus Glass, Garrett Johnston,
Sam Lofland, Scott Polley and
Matt Twomey.
"This senior class was really
the first one I was lucky enough to
play a part in recruiting while I
was an assistant at Stanford,"
head coach Steve Buddie said.
"They are a group that was abso
lutely committed to putting Stan
ford wrestling on the map and
they've done just that. I can't say
enough about the quality of their
character and their dedication to
something more than just an ath

letic team."
Metzler reflected on how far
his team has come this year.
"Our team's mindset is com
pletely different," Metzler said.
"In the past, we usually had a cou
ple of good guys and the only
pressure you felt was an individu
al pressure. Now, we rely on and
feed off each other. No one wants
to let down his teammates. You
don't want to lose because you
know your teammate is going to
be pulling his weight. We are def
initely a closer team than I have
been on in my four years here at
Stanford."
The Cardinal has two weeks to
prepare for the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Tempe, Ariz., where it
will look to improve on last sea
son's ninth-place finish and quali
fy multiple wrestlers for NCAAs.

"This senior class was really

play a part in recruiting while I
was an assistant at Stanford,"
head coach Steve Buddie said.
"They are a group that was abso
lutely committed to putting Stan
ford wrestling on the map and
they've done just that. I can't say
enough about the quality of their
character and their dedication to
something more than just an ath

Metzler reflected on how far
his team has come this year.
"Our team's mindset is com
pletely different," Metzler said.
"In the past, we usually had a cou
ple of good guys and the only
pressure you felt was an individu
al pressure. Now, we rely on and
feed off each other. No one wants
to let down his teammates. You
don't want to lose because you
know your teammate is going to
be pulling his weight. We are def
initely a closer team than I have
been on in my four years here at
Stanford."
The Cardinal has two weeks to
prepare for the Pac-10 Champi
onships in Tempe, Ariz., where it
