# Wrestling comes back to beat Davis
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Over the past month, the
Stanford wrestling team has
experienced its fair share of
nail-biters and blowouts, but

nary a Cardinal loss. Last
weekend was no exception, as
Stanford (10-4, 6-2 Pacific-10
Conference) came from be
hind to defeat UC-Davis 21-
15 on Friday night before
pummeling Portland State at

home on Saturday, 42-3, to
wrap up the dual meet season
as winners of seven straight.
Coming off close wins over
Oregon State and Fresno
State, the Cardinal rallied
from a 12-point deficit by win

ning the final five bouts
against Davis. Freshman
Brian Perry gave Stanford its
first lead with an 8-7 decision
over Mike Font in the penulti
mate bout of the night and
sophomore Imad Kharbush
sealed the deal with a 13-6 de
cision over Daniel Price.
Kharbush's win avenged a loss
to Price at the Aggie Open in
January.
Davis, which defeated the
Cardinal 24-11 last season,
gained the early momentum in
front of its home crowd as
Brandon Bear, No. 2 in the
Pac-10 at 184 pounds, defeat
ed Stanford senior John
Garfinkel 11-4 before Stan
ford sophomore Larry
Ozowara rebounded with a
17-10 decision at 197.
The Aggies won the next
three bouts, however, includ
ing a questionable pin by the
Pac-10's top wrestler at 125
pounds. Tommy Schurkamp.
Stanford freshman Tanner
Gardner held a 4-2 lead and
was riding Schurkamp with
just four seconds to go in the
third and final period when
the official called a defensive
pin after Schurkamp grabbed
Gardner's head.
After another narrow de
feat and with the Cardinal
trailing 15-3, Stanford co-cap

tain junior Brad Metzler
turned things around in his
bout at 141 pounds, polishing
his opponent off in 27 seconds
with a pin, his fifth of the sea
son.
"I really forced the pin in
an effort to change the mo
mentum of the dual [match],"
Metzler said. "I knew 1 could
pin the kid and was hoping
that it would re-energize the
guys following me."
It did.
Stanford sophomore Luis
Vendrell followed with his
19th win of the season, a 7-5
decision at 149, and junior co
captain Matt Gentry, No. 2 in
the nation at 157 pounds, de
feated defending Pac-10
champion Jeremiah Jarvis 9-3
to knot the team score at 15-
15 and set up Perry and Khar
bush's decisive victories.
The Cardinal returned
home on Saturday night for its
final dual meet of the season,
winning nine of 10 bouts
against Portland State.
Kharbush set the tone
early, opening the meet with a
pin in 3:47. After Garfinkel
won via forfeit, Ozowara com
pleted a two-win weekend by
turning what appeared to be a
