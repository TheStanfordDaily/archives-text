# Baseball sweeps Kansas to record 15th straight home win
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
It was the scenario that every young baseball fan
imagines while pitching to him or herself in the front
yard.
Bottom of the ninth. Tie score. Bases loaded.
You take a few practice swings, and you step into
the imaginary batter's box. It's all up to you.
Cardinal senior Brian Hall faced the same situa
tion yesterday afternoon — only it was far from
imaginary.

In front of a roaring Sunken Diamond crowd of
2,441, Hall faced a one-out situation. He could have
given Stanford the win with just a base hit. He could
have done it with a sacrifice fly. He could have
taken a few pitches from Kansas righthander Tyson
Bothof.
But Stanford had the charts on Bothof and Hall
knew exactly what to expect. When Bothof reached
hack and fired the fastball that the Cardinal knew
was coming. Hall ended the game.
With a walk-off grand slam.
Hall's shot, which sailed over the left field wall.

capped a seven-run inning for the No. 4 Cardinal (8-
1), which overcame a three-run deficit to win the
game, 10-6, and sweep the Kansas Jayhawks (7-7-1).
"I definitely knew that if it came down to me it
was going to be a big spot," Hall said. "I was just try
ing to relax and make sure that if it came to me I'd
be able to put a good swing on the ball and not be
too anxious. I was just trying to hit the ball in the air,
and it ended up going out."
Kansas got its first out in the bottom of the ninth
when freshman Jim Rapoport flied out to center,
then got into trouble when it faced the top of the
Stanford order. The Jayhawks — who used four
pitchers over the course of the inning — walked the
bases loaded after that first out. Junior cleanup man
Danny Putnam lined a base hit to bring senior Sam
Fuld home, and Kansas walked sophomore John
Mayberry Jr. to bring in another run.
The Cardinal had been scoreless since the third
inning and the sudden surge jumpstarted the energy
of the crowd, which began cheering wildly at every
ball and booing every called strike.
Junior catcher Donny Lucy stepped up to the
plate and smacked a hard hit right into the chest of
Jayhawks third baseman Travis Metcalf, which
drove in sophomore Jed Lowrie, the tying run and
set up Hall's game winner.
"Getting to the tie was the huge thing for us,"
said Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "I'd like
to say it was all us, but they gave us a lot. To our
credit, though, we got a couple of key hits."
Yesterday's contest didn't start out well for the
Cardinal, as junior hurler Mark Jecman found him
self in a jam in the first inning after allowing a smat
tering of Jayhawks base hits that knocked in two
runs. Senior reliever David O'Hagan replaced him
after just one out, and went on to throw a career-high
7-2/3 innings, allowing only three hits and two runs.
The scene was strangely familiar, as O'Hagan
stepped in to pitch six innings last weekend after
Jecman allowed two runs in the first inning of his
Sunday start against Fresno State.
O'Hagan said after the game that despite the
large number of innings that he has been throwing
so far this season, pitching in the ninth is the same as
pitching in the first.
"Coach Marquess basically came to me and said.

'If you don't pitch in the first two games, 1 won't hes
itate to pitch you early in the Sunday game,' "
O'Hagan said. "So I just try to go out there and
throw as many strikes as possible and let the guys
play behind us."
Saturday's 6-3 win for the Cardinal was highlight
ed by a solid performance from sophomore Jeff
Gilmore (2-0), who has impressed twice this season
as the number-two starter.
The sophomore gave up only two runs —both
were solo homers from Metcalf — and allowed only
three total hits in his career-high seven-inning outing.
Offensively, the Cardinal bested Kansas with a
strong small-ball game. While a few hits came close
to leaving the park, none did, and Stanford relied on
its smart base running and its ability to hit to the
right places in order to advance runners.
"(Our situational hitting is] definitely something
that we try and work on," Hall said. "It's what we try
to do, because it's not every day you're going to be
able to hit the ball out of the park. It's definitely
something that we take pride in."
Fuld, the squad's leadoff batter, drew two walks
and had a pair of hits to match a pair of runs scored.
Mayberry Jr. also crossed the plate twice and had
two walks, in addition to smashing a double that hit
the wall,
Stanford recorded all six of its runs by the time
that sophomore reliever Matt Manship took the
mound. Manship gave up two hits and a run before
Kansas was caught in a double play to end the game.
Sophomore lefty Mark Romanczuk started
against Kansas on Friday night and the ace threw his
best start of the season, relying heavily on his curve
ball and allowing just six hits and one run. His 13
strikeouts were the most by any Stanford pitcher in
a single game since Jeremy Guthrie faced UCLA in
2002.
"I felt comfortable out there tonight and knew I
had good stuff," Romanczuk said. "I was able to uti
lize my curveball a lot tonight. I think it was the best
I've thrown that pitch in a couple of years."
The series sweep brings the Cardinal's home win
ning streak to 15, which dates back to the 2003 season.
Stanford next faces its longtime rival and a colle
giate powerhouse in its series against No. 6 Texas
this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
