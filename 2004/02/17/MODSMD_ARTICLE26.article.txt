# Volleyball defeated twice
## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After making the long trek from Honolulu, No. 2 Hawaii
(8-2,5-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) wasn't in the
mood for much of a fight this weekend and defeated the No.
9 Stanford men's volleyball team (5-9, 3-7 MPSF) in three
games on two consecutive nights. Dressed in their unmis
takable floral shorts, the Rainbow Warriors lived up to their
No. 2 ranking and handed the Cardinal its fourth and fifth
straight losses in a streak that began when Cal State-
Northridge defeated Stanford in late January.
On both Friday and Saturday nights, the Warriors hit
harder, faster and made fewer errors than their oppo
nent. Hawaii jumped out to a 9-5 lead and steadily in
creased its advantage from there. After junior outside
hitter David Vogel missed a serve, the Warriors took the
lead at 20-10, and would increase it even further, going on
to win, 30-19.
"We didn't give ourselves a chance," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We're just beating ourselves."
Game two marked an even worse showing for the Car
dinal, as junior setter Kevin Hansen and junior middle
blocker Craig Buell struggled to piece together their quick
attack. The team's hitting errors were a cause for concern
for Shaw, who commented on the Cardinal's statistics.
"Sixteen balls we just hit out or into the net," he said. "It's
just a matter of executing fundamental skills."
Hawaii was the team that showed the "fundamental
skills" that night and all weekend, posting a .500 hitting per
centage to win game two, 30-14. In game three, sophomore
middle blocker Mauli'a Lit Barre notched a perfect five-for

five kill attempts to lead Hawaii to a 30-19 win.
But the contrast in offenses wasn't the only difference.
Junior outside hitter David Vogel, who led the Stanford at
tack on Friday night with eight kills, wasn't pleased with his
team's passing, either.
"I think this weekend can be characterized by (the fact
that) we didn't take care of the ball on serve-receive," he
said. "We gave up strings of points [that way]."
Passing errors certainly plagued the Cardinal on Satur
day night, though Stanford improved its play from the pre
vious night. After the Warriors took a stunning 27-14 lead in
game one, Stanford went on a 6-0 run to close the gap at 27-
20. But, like most Cardinal efforts, it was too little, too late,
and Hawaii ended the game at 30-21.
Though Hansen, who led Stanford with a match-high 27
assists to go along with five kills and seven digs, made rela
tively few mistakes, said that Cardinal errors were only ex
acerbated by Warrior skill.
"They're just a really tough team," he said. "All around
they made very minimal mistakes. Every mistake we made
is just heightened by how good they are."
But in the last game of the weekend, the Cardinal finally
rallied, buoyed by the solid play of two sophomores off the
bench, outside hitters Nick Manov and William Clayton.
With a kill, Manov closed the Warriors' lead to 17-14 and
Clayton tallied six kills for the night, a team-high shared with
Buell. Stanford would threaten the Warriors again, down
only four at 24-20, but Hawaii went on to close out the match
and the weekend at 30-24. Hansen noticed the improve
ment in game three.
"We stayed a little more consistent siding out," he said.
"We didn't give up."
