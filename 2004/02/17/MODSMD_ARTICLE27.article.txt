## SAE on probation in Tennessee school 
### KRISTIN HALL SIDELINES 
(U-WIRE) MURFREESBORO, Tenn.
â€” Middle Tennessee State University has
completed its investigation into hazing allega
tions against Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
and put the organization on disciplinary pro
bation until 2005.
The investigation follows an alumni com
mission inquest into an anonymous e-mail
sent last semester that accused several mem
bers of SAE of hazing.
"The alumni commission did an excellent,
excellent job," said Clint Hall, interim assis
tant dean of Judicial Affairs.
"Our investigation was successful be
cause of their steadfast cooperation and their
assistance."
One member was recommended for expul
sion from the fraternity and suspension for 14
other members.
MTSU cannot release the sanctions placed
on individual students, due to the 1974 Fami
ly Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
Disciplinary probation includes the re
striction of the fraternity to sponsor or partic

ipate in any social activities or intramurals
through May 31.
"They are allowed to participate in spring
2004 rush and recruitment and they will be
allowed to participate in Greek Week," Hall
explained.
As part of its punishment from the alumni
commission, SAE sponsored a guest speaker
who spoke on issues of hazing and fraternity
responsibility.
The commission found three incidents of
hazing, including requiring pledges to hold a
five-pound wooden paddle over their heads
fora brief period and ordering them to do
push-ups and sit-ups on two different occa
sions.
Hall consulted with other university offi
cials before making the final decision as to the
punishment.
"I sat down with some of my peers, Dr.
(Gene) Fitch and the director of greek life
(Kim Godwin), and we sat down and dis
cussed the appropriate sanctions," Hall said.
"It's a bigger issue than just a judicial matter.
It sets precedent and it should serve as a de
terrent effect."
Since the allegations have come out, the

Tennessee Beta chapter has elected new of
ficers and all the pledges have become
members.
Hall said he believes the new officers will
treat this incident as a learning experience.
"As a credit to them, I've met with a few of
them and they seem to be right on par with un
derstanding what the expectations are of the
university and of their own alumni and of
their own charter," Hall said.
While on disciplinary probation, any viola
tions could result in more serious sanctions
against the fraternity. Hall explained.
The chapter just recently got off social
probation at the beginning of this year for
disorderly conduct and alcohol consump
tion in 2002.
Despite the chapter's history, both Hall
and SAE said they believe the fraternity will
turn over a new leaf.
"I think that they're going to turn a corner
and continue on a path of prosperity, hopeful
ly," Hall said.
"We'll be fine," assured Adam Marshall,
the new SAE president. "We're already
looking forward to the fall and we're ready
to go."
