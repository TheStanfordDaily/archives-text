# Florida researchers battle prostate cancer
## 
### BENNETT GROSSMAN THE ORACLE 
(U-WIRE) TAMPA, Fla. â€” In an effort
to help lower the risk of prostate cancer
among blacks, the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer
Center has teamed up with Florida A&M
University (FAMU) to develop the Minority
Prostate Cancer Training and Research Cen
ter. The program will provide extensive re
search on the increased incidence of prostate
cancer among blacks, train FAMU students
to become interested in treating and prevent
ing prostate cancer, and provide outreach
programs in the community.
"This is an untouched area. This hasn't
been given this much importance before," said
Nagi Kumar, Moffitt's director of nutrition.
Bob Samuels, chairman and CEO of the
Florida Prostate Cancer Network and a board
member of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center,
assisted both FAMU and Moffitt in obtaining
a grant from the U.S. Department of Defense
(DOD) to fund the center. Samuels is also a
10-year prostate cancer survivor and had
served as a reviewer on the first DOD
prostate cancer review panel in 1998. At the
time, Samuels said that he felt that it was an
ideal program to get both Florida institutions
working together.
The grant received from the DOD for the
collaborative project totals $904,800 and is
being awarded through the DOD's prostate
cancer program.

According to the American Cancer Soci
ety, black men have the highest prostate can
cer incidence rate in the world and are twice
as likely to die from the disease than any other
group. After skin cancer, prostate cancer is
the second highest diagnosed cancer, and the
second leading cause of cancer death in men.
Black men have an incidence rate 60 percent
greater than white males and a death rate
twice that of white men.
Moffitt's role in the joint venture is to
begin to develop, establish and implement
collaborative research, training and outreach
programs about prostate cancer, said Kumar.
"We, as a research center, are experts in
the disease and we are also experts in the sci
entific methodology to be used and what to
look at in these cancers," Kumar said.
FAMU contributes researchers to the col
laboration, and guidance to help the program
in the right direction.
"FAMU is a known minority institution
that has minority researchers that know how
to go about conducting research and they
know the most important research questions
that effect their community," Kumar said.
There will be three main focuses for the
joint program between FAMU and Moffitt:
creating a training program, the marriage of
important skills from FAMU and Moffitt,
and the creation of community outreach
programs.
The first phase of the program is to train
FAMU students, specifically minority stu

dents, to become more interested in prostate
cancer research.
"We feel they are the ones who are going
to make a difference," Kumar said.
The second phase of the program is for
Moffitt and FAMU to combine their skills in
order to create better research opportunities
as well as provide better care for minorities
with prostate cancer.
The final focus of the center is the creation
of a community outreach program, which will
be headed by Samuels. Kumar said Samuels
would be ideal for the program because he is
a leader in the field of prostate cancer and is
outspoken in getting the message out about
early screening, educating minority popula
tions and getting more people involved in re
search. Also involved in the outreach pro
gram are community leaders, community or
ganizations, the Florida state government, re
searchers from Moffitt and FAMU and the
American Cancer Society.
Kumar said she feels that this joint venture
between the two organizations will help lower
the incidence of prostate cancer in black men,
as well as working on other types of cancer
prevalent to minority groups.
"It's going to open up new doors and help
us to resolve the issue of this disparity in can
cer incidence in the African-American popu
lation and this can be extended to other can
cers where the incidence of cancer is very high
in the African-American community,"
Kumar said.
