# Profs, blog away in the classroom
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
Increasingly more Stanford
professors are using "Web log
ging," more popularly known as
"blogging." in their classrooms.
Traditionally used for online so
cial networking — people write
diary entries and others reply —
blogging is now being used so that
students can post messages and
participate in discussions.
Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) Lecturer Chris
tine Alfano said that she thought
it was fitting to incorporate blog
ging into her E-Rhetorics class
because of the class' focus on
electronic rhetoric and digital
media. For her class, students
post a message once a week
about their research or thoughts
on the material.
According to Alfano, the
hardest part was setting up at the
start of the quarter since most of
her students had never used a
blog before.

Alfano said she decided to
keep a blog herself because she
had never done so and because
she wanted to remain knowledge
able about the medium for her
class discussions.
"I've found it to be a very
helpful way to process my own
thoughts and ideas about the
course," Alfano said. "Also, I'd
like to think that those same stu
dents who actually read our in
structors bios on the PWR site
would turn to a blog as well to get
a better sense of their instruc
tors, their teaching style, and
their approach to teaching writ
ing and rhetoric."
Alfano also noted the conflict
between the public and private
nature of blogging.
"As much as blogging is tied to
the tradition of journaling, where
you write down your personal
thoughts, it's an inherently public
form of writing, one where you
also have your broader audience
in mind. In a sense, that makes it a
type of performative journal,
where you're writing for yourself
as much as others."
Whereas Alfano said she is
happy experimenting with blog
ging. History Prof. Joel Samoff
said that the technology still is not
capable of doing all the things
that he wants it to do.
Samoff said that blogging must
perform three main functions if
he is to use it in his classrooms.
"It has to be public so every
body can see what other people
are publicly posting," Samoff said.
"However, it also has to allow

users to be able to post things pri
vately. Lastly, it has to be connect
ed to people's e-mail accounts so
the professor can communicate
with students easily."
Samoff said that of all the blog
ging plans he has heard, at least
one element was missing, but he
likes the idea because it is a way
of getting students to work on a
lengthy project over the course of
the entire quarter.
"To get students working on
their projects before the last
minute, what I currently do is as
sign deadlines for outlines and
rough drafts," Samoff said. "Blog
ging would be a way of doing the
same thing. If a student did not
post a blog for two weeks, I could
talk to that student and ask him
why he has not been working on
his project."
