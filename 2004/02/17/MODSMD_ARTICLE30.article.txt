# Wisconsin students protest circus over animal rights issues

### MATTHEW DOLBEY BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. — Ani
mal rights activists protested the Zor Shrine
Circus taking place at the Alliant Energy
Center Saturday and Sunday, saying the
producers of the show failed to take proper
care of the animals.
The Madison Coalition for Animal
Rights (MCAR) demonstrated outside of
the Alliant Energy Center, handing out liter
ature listing past alleged offenses of the
Shrine Circus family.
Alex Means, a University of Wisconsin
student and MCAR member, said he talked

to patrons before the circus and explained the
group's reasoning for boycotting the event.
"There are minimal standards that the
Shrine Circus has not met," Means said, saying
he believes things like clean water and proper
food are common things animals deserve.
Liza Hirsch, a fellow MCAR member,
said in a press release that not only the ani
mals are treated poorly at these events.
"People who attend circuses put on by the
Shrine exhibitors are not only putting their
own lives in jeopardy, but those of other
Madison community members, animal train
ers and the animals themselves," Hirsch said
in the release.
In June 2002, People for the Ethical

Treatment of Animals reports two elephants
escaped from a circus in Menominee and
wandered the streets of the Wisconsin town
before trucks blocked one of the elephants in
at the UW-Stout campus.
The statewide animal rights organization
Alliance for Animals and UW group Cam
pus Vegan Society joined MCAR to voice
their concerns at the circus. Means reported
"about 15" volunteers showed up each day
to pass out the literature.
Means said circuses do not usually get ac
cused of animal welfare violations, because
the Shrine Circus, for example, contracts its
animal work from outside vendors.
Though the allegations against the circus

were controversial, no major confrontations
occurred. Means felt the demonstration
went "great", adding the group was able to
talk some patrons out of attending.
"Our basic goal is to inform," Means said.
"We're not going to bother anyone, but just
get our literature out."
Means added it"was nice to see that peo
ple cared" about the group's message.
Mark Cook, a UW animal sciences pro
fessor, said laws, like those in the Animal
Welfare Act, currently regulate the animal
exhibition industry in hopes to protect the
best interests of animals.
"There are checks and balances with re
gards to circuses," Cook said, adding the

laws governing circuses are changing all the
time in order to keep up with research show
ing what is best for animal welfare. "They're
pretty strict laws."
Though Cook did not believe animals are
necessarily treated badly now, he said histor
ically circuses have had problems with ani
mal health and safety.
"But, there are problems in any type of
situation where animals and men interact,"
Cook said. He added any type of problems
that do occur now "have to be inspected."
Cook offered for those interested to attend
his class of human and animal symbiosis,
where critics of a wide range explain their
views on a given topic.
