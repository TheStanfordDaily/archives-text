### CHARLES PROCTOR DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — In
a strongly worded decision, a judge
cleared the way fora lawsuit against the
University of California over fee in
creases to proceed, overruling the uni
versity's objections and attempts to
block it.
The suit was filed over the summer
by eight graduate students from four
UC campuses, including the University
of California-Los Angeles and the Uni
versity of California-Berkeley. They al
lege that the university has broken stu
dent contracts on three counts by rais
ing fees.
Jonathan Weissglass, one of the stu
dents' counsels in the suit, praised the
judge's "very thought-out" ruling.
"We're very encouraged by the
judge's decision," he said.
Jeff Blair, the university's counsel,
could not be reached for comment.
The plaintiffs allege that the con
tracts graduate students sign when they
enroll in a university state the universi
ty will not raise fees while the students
are enrolled, and that the university
failed to give sufficient notice of the in
creases.
The university raised student fees by

25 percent over the summer. Graduate
students face another 40 percent in
crease under Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's new budget proposal.
The university attempted to dismiss
these claims, declaring them inade
quate grounds fora lawsuit. However,
the judge disagreed.
"A reasonable person would be enti
tled to rely on the university's represen
tation that the professional degree fee
will remain the same throughout his or
her enrollment, regardless of what hap
pened to the rest of tuition," the judge
wrote in his 14-page ruling.
The university also argued that a
clause on the UC Web site said student
fees were subject to change, though the
judge ruled this argument as "not per
suasive."
Mo Kashmiri, a law student at UC-
Berkeley and a plaintiff in the case, said
he was pleasantly surprised that the
judge allowed all three counts against
the university to proceed.
"The decision is better than 1
thought it was going to be," he said.
The case will likely take another few
months to resolve, Weissglass said.
If the judge ultimately rules in
favor of the students, they will be re
funded the amount of the 25 percent
fee increase.
