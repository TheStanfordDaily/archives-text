(U-WIRE) HUNTINGTON, W.Va. —
There are some couples that don't believe in
public displays of affection, but Marshall
University's student-run radio station found
a few that were happy to kiss in front of the
student body.
The station, 88.1 WMUL, hosted its sec
ond annual Make Out Marathon Thursday
in the Memorial Student Center.
"I'm trying to study, but there's no way,"
Joel Lewis, a management information sys
tems sophomore watching the marathon,
said. "It's just too distracting."
The kissing was scheduled to begin at
noon but was delayed until 12:45 p.m. be

cause of lack of participation, said Brandon
Woolum, a member of WMUL's promo
tions staff.
"It was pretty disappointing," he said.
"At noon we looked up and had one couple.
We didn't know what to do."
Two more couples, including WMUL
staff members, eventually signed up.
Students were disappointed it didn't start
on time, and many left by 12:15 p.m.,
Woolum said.
First-place finishers won a prize package
valued at $125. Second- and third-place cou
ples won packages worth $60 and $40, re
spectively. Prizes included gift certificates
from Applebee's, Aladdin's Beauty Salon
and the Tri-State Ice Arena, Woolum said.
The promotions staff wanted to conduct

the marathon again because last year's
event was so successful. They began plan
ning more than two weeks ago by calling dif
ferent organizations throughout the Tri-
State area for donations, he said.
Many companies are happy to cooperate
with Marshall University and its students,
he said.
This year's Make Out Marathon lasted
one hour and 25 minutes. Couples kissed in
last year's marathon for five hours and 37
minutes. A.J. Elmore and Daniel Harston
were declared the 2004 winners.
Some students said that it puts a new
twist on affection.
"It's something I've never seen before,"
Lewis said. "But if you're getting a prize,
why not compete?"
