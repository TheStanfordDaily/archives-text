# Sorority sponsors week for women
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi is hosting a
women's conference this week entitled
"Beyond the Margins: The Week for
Women." The events include work
shops, talks and performances intended
to highlight women and explore
women's issues that do not receive
enough mainstream attention.
"This week is a reminder to people
that oppression still exists in today's so
ciety, and the week is also a forum
through which women can unite behind
these issues and find inspiration and
support," said sophomore Linda Tran,
an Alpha Kappa Delta Phi member and
organizer of the conference.
Alpha Kappa Delta Phi member
Michelle Won, a senior, described the
sorority's past women's conferences as "a
full day of estrogen and women's issues."
This year's event is an expansion of
the sorority's annual one-day Women's
Conference. Won said she hoped the
conference's expansion to a week of
events would encourage more people
to attend.
Tran added, "We've expanded it into
a full week in order to incorporate a
broader range of topics, involve more
people from the Stanford community
and really use this time to celebrate and
emphasize women empowerment."

Tran encourages all people of all
races and genders to participate to
fulfill the event's double purpose of
both empowering women and honor
ing them.
"The whole point of the week is to
raise awareness to the plight of women
and push their issues into the forefront,"
Tran said.
The first event of the conference is
tonight's workshop, entitled "Chastity
and Purity: How to be Queer and
Hapa." The workshop will be led by
Asian American Studies Assistant
Prof. Wei Ming Dariotis at 7 p.m. in the
Oak Lounge on the second floor of
Tresidder Union.
Political activist Yuri Kochiyama will
discuss on Wednesday the movement
for Asian American rights. Because of
her Japanese ancestry, Kochiyama was
imprisoned in an internment camp dur
ing World War 11. After that experi
ence, she became dedicated to advocat
ing of civil rights and racial equality of
both African and Asian Americans. She
will speak at 7:00 p.m. in Building 200.
On Thursday, a panel of men of var
ied backgrounds and identities will dis
cuss their views on women's issues in an
event entitled "What Guys Think."
They will be answering questions from
the audience. The panel is in Tresid
der Oak West Lounge at 9:15 p.m.
The last workshop on Friday will
be run by a capella trio, Samsara,
