## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
The World Refugee Leadership Pro
gram (WRLP) and the Department of
Cultural and Social Anthropology
(CASA) will host a three-week film se
ries designed to expose Stanford stu
dents to significant issues in suh-Saharan
Africa.
The film series will be held on three
consecutive Thursdays, beginning this
week with a screening of "Everyone's

Child," a feature film based on a novel by
Tsitsi Dangarembga about AIDS/HIV
orphans in Zimbabwe. The film will be
shown at 4 p.m. in Building 110, room
1110.
The other two films in the series are
"Maids and Madams" and "Our Friends
at the Bank."
According to CASA master's student
Zuzka Fedorkova, one of the series' co
ordinators, one of the motivations be
hind the film series is to bring under
graduates into the department on a more

informal basis.
"We decided to focus on Africa be
cause it is one of the department's main
areas of focus and this event was orga
nized with the help of our new professor,
Liisa Malkki, an Africanist / anthropolo
gist who joined the department this
year," Fedorkova said.
The WRLP, through its links with
CASA, expressed an interest in helping
with the organization of this event. The
group was responsible for finalizing the
film selections, working on publicity and

other logistics.
"Although none of the films are
specifically about refugees and conflict,
the purpose of the series is to expose
Stanford students to pertinent issues in
sub-Saharan Africa," Fedorkova said.
"They are about issues such as phildren
and their problems, women's issues, race
relations, or relations of African govern
ments to international aid institutions."
Started by a group of Stanford stu
dents who volunteered in Botswana dur
ing the summer of 2003, the WRLP is a

non-profit organization dedicated to
contributing to refugee education.
WRLP Executive Director Taylor
Ahlgren, Class of 2003, said that the or
ganization's goal is to facilitate the de
velopment of refugee students into re
sponsible leaders and candidates for uni
versities worldwide.
Ahlgren said that the group's projects
currently span the globe,
"We are in discussions with Cisco to
establish an IT training curricu
lum in the refugee camp,"
Ahlgren said. "This would train
50 pupils per year, giving them a
certificate of tremendous power
in a country that is stressing the
importance of technology in its
development."
Junior Naomi Gleit, regional
coordinator for the program,
noted that in addition to the film
series, WRLP is also finding
other ways to promote its cause
on campus.
"We are organizing a photo ex
hibit to be shown on the first floor
of Tresidder Union that will fea
ture photos from our trip to
Dukwi Refugee camp last summer
and we have entered the BASES
social entrepreneurship e-chal
lenge with a project idea to market
baits made at the refugee camp in
the United States," Gleit said.
