# Republican groups duke it out
## 
### JACK LOVERIDGE 
Representatives from the Republican
Youth Majority (RYM) have been stationed in
White Plaza to raise student awareness about
the organization's centrist political stance and
establish a campus branch independent from
the Stanford College Republicans (SCR).
These efforts have been met with resistance
from the leaders of SCR.
The RYM, a national organization funded by
private donations, promotes political views that
are not consistent with the traditional platform
of the mainstream Republican Party. Instead,
the group promotes the expansion of GOP
membership among college-age voters through
the adoption of moderate stances on such social
issues as abortion, environmental protection
and gun control.
"Our primary goal is to broaden the tent of
the Republican Party and make it more inclu
sive," said Kelli Payne, one of the RYM's
field representatives. "I think it's realistic
that we can gain new Republican support on
a campus with a pronounced Democratic ma
jority. It's also realistic to know that great
movements must endure resistance and take
time. We're here to reach out to those stu
dents who would otherwise not feel wel
comed into the Republican Party."
However, sophomore Bob Sensenbrenner,
vice president of the SRC, said the installation of
a new Republican group at Stanford is factious,
redundant and unnecessary because his organi
zation is already representation of the multiple
viewpoints within the party. Sensenbrenner also
said he dislikes the fact that the RYM an
nounced its intentions to create a separate group
on campus in The Daily on Feb. 6 without con
sulting with his group beforehand.
"We would be more than happy to appoint a
liaison to work with the RYM — a step which
we have done with many campaigns and other
external political organizations in the past," he
said. "In the article that ran in The Daily, the
RYM representatives stated that students have
a negative perception of our organization. This
exhibits the naivete of the RYM field represen
tatives; being on campus a week hardly qualifies
one to accurately assess the political viewpoints
on campus."
In an op-ed piece that ran in The Daily on
Feb. 10 in response to the SCR's objections,
Payne and fellow field representative Yolanda

Vazquez reiterated their organization's inten
tions to create a branch on campus indepen
dent of the SCR and chastised Sensenbrenner
for his response to their decision. Payne, how
ever, said she hopes that the two groups can
now work together as they have common goals
for their party.
"We are eager to work with their organiza
tion, but it's just as critical to have the Stanford
College Republicans welcome members of all
ideologies," she said. "Any misunderstandings
between our group and the SCR have been
cleared up; we have engaged in further discus
sion with the SCR and now feel comfortable in
our relationship."
Junior Stephen Cohen, editor of The Stan
ford Review, the campus' conservative newspa
per, said he sees benefits in having multiple Re

publican groups on campus if the two can find
common ground.
"The RYM could potentially cause a rift in
the conservatives at Stanford if their aggressive
tactics continue," Cohen said. "But both groups
at their core have the same goal — to expand
the base of the Republican Party. This shared vi
sion should enable these two groups to work
their common ground and turn these recent
conflicts into a thing of the past. An influx of new
ideas and fresh perspectives from outside the
Stanford bubble can only serve to increase the
diversity of campus perspectives."
However, regarding the RYM's right to dis
tribute leaflets in White Plaza, Sensenbrenner
said that because the representatives are from

Despite resistance from the Stanford College Republicans, representatives from the Republican
Youth Majority hope to start a new branch of the organization on campus.
