## Welcome to 'Tranceford' Students explore non-alcoholic party options 
### KATE BEARMAN 
You know the scene. It's a Satur
day night at Stanford, and as the clock
nears 11 p.m., the Row starts to buzz
with students wandering in search of
a good party. Throngs of Stanford
students — studious by day, scan
dalous by night — stumble drunken
ly down hills and across parking lots
toward the music.
Weary of the campus police who,
not surprisingly, have nothing else to
do but nail students with MIPs, some
party-goers link arms for support and
try to suppress their voice levels until
they are safely surrounded by hoards
of sweaty people on overcrowded
dance floors. The usual hip-hop
music will blast until 1 a.m. and then,
after being jostled around and get
ting cheap beer spilled on their fa
vorite outfits, these sociable under
grads will walk back to their dorms,
play some Beirut, hang out in the
hallways and crash.
Ah, yes, another Stanford weekend.
Granted, these parties can be fun.
They provide a chance to run into
friends from other dorms, to dress up
(if you're a girl) and to act as crazy as
you want because most people are too
wasted to evaluate your dancing skills.
And if you're into the random hook
up scene, there's no better place than a
massive party to find someone to mack
on.
After attending these events on
both nights of every weekend of every
quarter, however, some people are in
the mood fora change. This past
weekend, Naranja attempted to throw
a different type of party, called
"Tranceford."
Some may remember that this

East Lag dorm hosted the "Orange
Pill" party last year, which had a Ma
trix theme and featured electronic
dance music, good snacks and Jamba
Juice. "Orange Pill" was different
from other campus parties because
the theme, rather than the alcohol,
was its key feature.
Max Mednik, who organized last
year's party as a freshman resident in
Naranja, wanted people to come to
"Orange Pill" in order to experience a
different type of atmosphere, dance
and enjoy the music.
"Parties don't need alcohol to be
successful," Mednik said.
His theory proved to be correct;
"Orange Pill" was packed.
"I had to turn off the music and tell
people to leave because of quiet
hours," Mednik said.
Due to the success of "Orange Pill,"
Mednik. who is living in Naranja again
this year, convinced his dorm to throw
another such party. They renamed the
party "Tranceford" to emphasize the
fact that the event featured trance, tech
no and Euro dance music that is gener
ated electronically and spun by DJs.
Like last year, "Tranceford" fea
tured a variety of chips, cookies, soda
and Jamba Juice, but no alcohol. 'The
hosts also provided fresh, sliced oranges
out of loyalty to their residence named
after the delicious citrus fruit. The party
was held in the Naranja lounge, which
was decorated with black lights, disco
balls and glow sticks in order to create a
truly captivating aura.
"This party is so hot right now," said
sophomore Angelica Nava, one of the
party-goers.
Because of its focus on electronic
music, "Tranceford" was meant to
cater not only to the Stanford students

sick of the usual party
scene, but also to the
Stanford students
that are into elec
tronic music. Mednik
loves this type of
music and was one of
the DJs at the party.
Using a computer
and digital mixing
software, he has been
teaching himself to
DJ fora couple of
years. Mednik
bought turntables in
September that he
has been learning to
use manually, a pro
cess that he de
scribed as "very chal
lenging and fun."
Mednik also
hired professional
trance DJ, Derrell
"DJ Digit" Bishop to
help out at "Trance
ford." Bishop is 26
years old and has
been enthusiastic
about the electronic
music scene fora
few years now. He
said that while some
DJs write their own

music, most remix music using high
tech equipment. By "spinning" other
songs, trance DJs can compose their
own musical phrases and vary the
tempo of the already written pieces.
Besides catering to those who enjoy
electronic music, "Tranceford" also
appealed to people who like other ele
ments of the "rave" scene. Junior An
drew Buck attended "Tranceford"
due to his love for "raving with glow
sticks."

While spending
time in the many tech
no clubs that line
Miami Beach, Buck
learned to dance with
his whole body while
creating cool, fluid mo
tions with neon glow
sticks. His skills in
clude making figure
eights with glow sticks,
creating moving box
ing shapes, using his
fingers to make com
plex patterns and
"popping" — using
glow sticks to break
dance, resemble a
strobe light, and
freeze-frame himself.
Buck shared his talents
with the students who
attended the party.
"We came for the
glow sticks," said
Bries Deerrose and
Matt Zafra, both
sophomores.

While these bright, colorful toys
were a huge hit among those who at
tended the party, the turnout was
drastically lower than that of last
year. At 11:30 p.m., there were only
about 13 people rockin' it out in the
Naranja lounge. Mednik was sur
prised that more people did not come
because — like "Orange Pill" —
"Tranceford" was well advertised.
Naranja made use of the resident as
sistant e-mail system and distributed
paper and electronic fliers to spread
word about the event.
Mednik attributed the poor atten
dance to the fact that it was Valentine's
Day and people were hanging out with
their close friends and significant oth
ers in atmospheres more conducive to
conversation and quality time. Toyon
and Synergy were also having parties
that probably stole some of "Trance
ford s" thunder.
Despite this year's disappointment,
Mednick said that the people who
came to the party had a great time. He
and his fellow trance music fans want
to organize more parties like "Trance
ford" this year but say that they will
"try a lot harder to make sure that
there are no big parties or holidays that
same day."
Additionally, Max thinks that a fu
ture "Tranceford" party should be
held in a location more central than
Naranja.
"I like trance music, but I think
you need a few drinks to dance to it,"
said sophomore Anthony Viola, who
did not attend the party.

lenging and fun."
Mednik also
hired professional
trance DJ, Derrell
"DJ Digit" Bishop to
help out at "Trance
ford." Bishop is 26
years old and has
been enthusiastic
about the electronic
music scene fora
few years now. He
said that while some
DJs write their own

music, most remix music using high
tech equipment. By "spinning" other
songs, trance DJs can compose their
own musical phrases and vary the
tempo of the already written pieces.
Besides catering to those who enjoy
electronic music, "Tranceford" also
appealed to people who like other ele
ments of the "rave" scene. Junior An
drew Buck attended "Tranceford"
due to his love for "raving with glow
sticks."

While spending
time in the many tech
no clubs that line
Miami Beach, Buck
learned to dance with
his whole body while
creating cool, fluid mo
tions with neon glow
sticks. His skills in
clude making figure
eights with glow sticks,
creating moving box
ing shapes, using his
fingers to make com
plex patterns and
"popping" — using
glow sticks to break
dance, resemble a
strobe light, and
freeze-frame himself.
Buck shared his talents
with the students who
attended the party.
"We came for the
glow sticks," said
Bries Deerrose and
Matt Zafra, both
sophomores.

While these bright, colorful toys
were a huge hit among those who at
tended the party, the turnout was
drastically lower than that of last
year. At 11:30 p.m., there were only
about 13 people rockin' it out in the
Naranja lounge. Mednik was sur
prised that more people did not come
because — like "Orange Pill" —
"Tranceford" was well advertised.
Naranja made use of the resident as
sistant e-mail system and distributed
paper and electronic fliers to spread
word about the event.
Mednik attributed the poor atten
dance to the fact that it was Valentine's
Day and people were hanging out with
their close friends and significant oth
ers in atmospheres more conducive to
conversation and quality time. Toyon
and Synergy were also having parties
that probably stole some of "Trance
ford s" thunder.
Despite this year's disappointment,
Mednick said that the people who
came to the party had a great time. He
and his fellow trance music fans want
to organize more parties like "Trance
ford" this year but say that they will
"try a lot harder to make sure that
there are no big parties or holidays that
same day."
Additionally, Max thinks that a fu
ture "Tranceford" party should be
held in a location more central than
Naranja.
"I like trance music, but I think
you need a few drinks to dance to it,"
said sophomore Anthony Viola, who
did not attend the party.

Students spend Valentine's Day together at "Tranceford" — an alcohol-free event held in
Naranja over the weekend.


CHRIS PEDREGAL/The Stanford Daily
The DJ spins a mix of trance, techno and Euro dance music.
You know the scene. It's a Satur
day night at Stanford, and as the clock
nears 11 p.m., the Row starts to buzz
with students wandering in search of
a good party. Throngs of Stanford
students — studious by day, scan
dalous by night — stumble drunken
ly down hills and across parking lots
toward the music.
Weary of the campus police who,
not surprisingly, have nothing else to
do but nail students with MIPs, some
party-goers link arms for support and
try to suppress their voice levels until
they are safely surrounded by hoards
of sweaty people on overcrowded
dance floors. The usual hip-hop
music will blast until 1 a.m. and then,
after being jostled around and get
ting cheap beer spilled on their fa
vorite outfits, these sociable under
grads will walk back to their dorms,
play some Beirut, hang out in the
hallways and crash.
Ah, yes, another Stanford weekend.
Granted, these parties can be fun.
They provide a chance to run into
friends from other dorms, to dress up
(if you're a girl) and to act as crazy as
you want because most people are too
wasted to evaluate your dancing skills.
And if you're into the random hook
up scene, there's no better place than a
massive party to find someone to mack
on.
After attending these events on
both nights of every weekend of every
quarter, however, some people are in
the mood fora change. This past
weekend, Naranja attempted to throw
a different type of party, called
"Tranceford."
Some may remember that this

East Lag dorm hosted the "Orange
Pill" party last year, which had a Ma
trix theme and featured electronic
dance music, good snacks and Jamba
Juice. "Orange Pill" was different
from other campus parties because
the theme, rather than the alcohol,
was its key feature.
Max Mednik, who organized last
year's party as a freshman resident in
Naranja, wanted people to come to
"Orange Pill" in order to experience a
different type of atmosphere, dance
and enjoy the music.
"Parties don't need alcohol to be
successful," Mednik said.
His theory proved to be correct;
"Orange Pill" was packed.
"I had to turn off the music and tell
people to leave because of quiet
hours," Mednik said.
Due to the success of "Orange Pill,"
Mednik. who is living in Naranja again
this year, convinced his dorm to throw
another such party. They renamed the
party "Tranceford" to emphasize the
fact that the event featured trance, tech
no and Euro dance music that is gener
ated electronically and spun by DJs.
Like last year, "Tranceford" fea
tured a variety of chips, cookies, soda
and Jamba Juice, but no alcohol. 'The
hosts also provided fresh, sliced oranges
out of loyalty to their residence named
after the delicious citrus fruit. The party
was held in the Naranja lounge, which
was decorated with black lights, disco
balls and glow sticks in order to create a
truly captivating aura.
"This party is so hot right now," said
sophomore Angelica Nava, one of the
party-goers.
Because of its focus on electronic
music, "Tranceford" was meant to
cater not only to the Stanford students

sick of the usual party
scene, but also to the
Stanford students
that are into elec
tronic music. Mednik
loves this type of
music and was one of
the DJs at the party.
Using a computer
and digital mixing
software, he has been
teaching himself to
DJ fora couple of
years. Mednik
bought turntables in
September that he
has been learning to
use manually, a pro
cess that he de
scribed as "very chal
lenging and fun."
Mednik also
hired professional
