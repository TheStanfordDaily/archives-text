# 10 Random Questions
## Dean of Students Greg Boardman 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
The new dean of students, Greg Boardman, has been on the job less
than three weeks and is already getting grilled by your faithful 10
Random Questions correspondent. Dean Boardman comes to
Stanford after 15 years at Tulane University in New Orleans, La.
1. Did you drive up Palm Drive on your first day?
Yes. It was great, it was beautiful. [The palm trees were] what Cali
fornia represents, I think. Not Northern California, it looked very
much Southern California.

2. Did you know those Palm Trees are
worth $30,000 each?
I had no idea. That's not in the Stanford fact
book.
3. How does Greek life here compare to
Greek life at Tulane?
I haven't been to any of the fraternity hous
es yet. I'm getting ready to go on a tour. Joey
Greenwell is taking me on a tour. I would
say one big difference is at least we don't
have the lure of New Orleans. It's not as
much as a distraction here.

4. Do you appear anywhere on the "Girls Gone Wild: Mardi Gras
Edition" video?
No, but I haven't missed [a Mardi Gras] in 15 years.
5. Are you going to go this year?
No. It's in two weeks. It was very difficult to leave for Mardi Gras
anyway because all the Tulane students invited their friends from all
over the country, and the student population of the campus almost
tripled during Mardi Gras, so we had a lot more college students to
deal with.
6. You went to the University of Vermont. Do you eat a lot of Ben
and Jerry's?
Yes. I actually ate at the very first one they opened at a gas station
in Vermont.
7.1 hear they're like celebrities over there. That's kind of weird.
It is. The University of Vermont actually had its own dairy, and I
preferred that over Ben and Jerry's. They produced milk and made
their own ice cream.
8. The special fees system is in the dumps right now. Secretly, don't
you suspect Joey Natoli of embezzling funds to buy $10,000 um
brella stands?
Not at all. He doesn't seem like the type of person.
9. What's your favorite mixed drink?
Probably cranberry juice and orange juice. It wakes me up in the
morning.
(Writer's Note: Kudos to the Dean for escaping that one unscathed.)
10. If you had gone to Stanford as an undergrad, what extracurricu
lars do you think you would have done?
Based on what I did previously (and I don't regret anything I got in
volved with), I probably would have joined a fraternity, joined the
band, and got involved with student government.
(Writer's Note: For the inquiring minds, the Dean played trumpet.
His fraternity was Sigma Phi Society and, while our campus doesn't
have a chapter, the Bears across the Bay do.)
11. If The Stanford Daily went back to school, would it be a model
A student, the class clown or somewhere in between?
Since I've only been here less than two weeks, it would be hard to
give an actual grade. I would guess I would have to say incomplete
at this point, or passing. I would give them an A for persistence. I've
been getting a lot of calls.
12. What did you think of the food in New Orleans?
Loved it. I miss it. Last weekend I was craving a fried shrimp
po' boy.
