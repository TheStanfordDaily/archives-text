# Eat, Drink and be Merry
## "Sex and the City "... well, sort of 
### 
Pretend it's bedtime and I'm your over
priced but overworked nanny that takes
care of you. and it's time for you to hear a
moral bedtime story. So lean back on your

pillow, close your eyes and listen to
my tale. But "don't worry — it's al
most as good as "The Berenstain
Bears Get the Gimmies." Almost.
Once upon a time, there was a
certain a cappella group that al
ways made women swoon, fluttered
their eyelashes and drop to their
knees. This a cappella group trav
eled from house to house, surpris
ing the giddy girls with serenades
nf invp Most of the time thev were

received with open arms and big smiles (bright
ened by Crest White Strips, but that'll be our little
secret). But on one particular Sunday, as the clock
tower chimed 9:15 p.m., this group of singers
knocked on the doors of a house full of giil but
not a sound was to be heard.
"Where are all the lovely young ladies?" in
quired a debonair tenor. "All their carriages are in
the lot, and 1 know of no social gatherings supply
ing barrels of Natural Ale that would distract
them at this hour. 1 wonder where they're hiding."
But the story does not end in this sad, confused
sta te — a sole female stepped outside and politely
informed the gentlemen that all the girls were
watching "Sex and the City,' and that they could
not be disturbed.

These girls have entered the realm of "It's not
TV, it's HBO" and won't be back until 9:30 p.m.
That is of course, unless she's a Curb Your Enthu
siasm fan — in which case, she won't be back til
10 p.m.
Don't worry, guys. Unless you are one of the
select few who do enjoy the show, you won't have
to put up with this 30-minutes-of-silence for much
longer— five more days to be exact. And girls, I
mourn with you the loss of our beloved friends:
Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.
That's right — this coming Sunday will mark
the end of an era. No more weekly sightings of
Manolo Blahniks, Smith Jared, the Russian (thank
god) and the ever poignant-yet-metaphorical
phrase of the week. I would love to add failed re
lationships to the list, but unfortunately we see
those all too often.
So to pay homage to six years of an amazing re
lationship between "Sex and the City" and all of
us, I think it's time we live it up Carrie-style right
here on the Farm. It's time to recreate "Sex and
the City" — well at least 40 minutes from the City.
I would say Sex and the Town, to be more exact,
but for some reason that sounds very wrong.
Now since the college budget usually can't ac
commodate the $400 pair of shoes habit (even
though I don't see how Carrie's salary did either),
we probably won't be following their footsteps in
the fashion realm. But the show is about more
than just the jeweled stilettos, Dolce dresses and
Burberry dog sweaters. It's about the let's-dish

about-our-lives lunches and the let's celebrate
our-fabulousness dinners. Although we can't
power lunch at Balthazar or order cosmos at Sushi
Samba, we can still get the concept right.
Since the power lunching doesn't have the
same feel in Wilbur dining (although in one
episode the girls visit a cafeteria-style restaurant),
I suggest you go off campus for this homage to the
show. So obviously, the next question is where
should a group of fabulous friends dine while ana
lyzing their lives? And as Carrie's alter-ego (say
hello to Carrie flrorf-shaw), there are a few places
that would be perfect for the occasion.
For the dish-session in the morning/afternoon
hours, the University Cafe (shockingly on Univer
sity Ave.) provides an airy, classic environment
with a delectable menu. The "health-smart," clean
preparation in no way undercuts the taste and tex
ture of a diverse menu that will please even the
Miranda in the group (she won't admit to being
the Miranda, but she is).
To give you a little sample, it offers a juice and
smoothie bar, amazingly-fresh quesadillas, walnut
and spinach salads topped with grilled salmon and
a trio of ground beef, ahi tuna and turkey burgers
served with three chutney spreads.
The place, however, isn't without its faults.
The tablecloths feel as if they're made out of 70s
polyester, the chairs could use a sense of style and
the omelettes are often wet and bland — but this
is my personal opinion.
Aside from these minor drawbacks, the caf£ of

fers a quaint and open space with decidedly classic
fare. The square tables are perfect fora group of
four to share their drama, and the atmosphere is
bright enough to add an optimistic tinge to the
whole experience.
And I couldn't help but wonder, since every
one wants to be uplifted after a solid session of
dishing, why go to a place where the dishes them
selves weigh you down? The massive grease feast
should take place when you've got some guys
around to have chili-fries-eating contests with.
Show him who's boss, girls.
Since I'm in denial that the show is leaving. I
can't admit that this is the end. To keep the Car
rie-party alive I'll save the discussion of the fabu
lous dinner for next week. Ti\ then, cross your fin
gers that she chooses Big and dumps the geriatric
Russian and chooses New York over Paris.
So love your friends, over-analyze your life,
buy a pair of expensive shoes and keep the spirit of
"Sex and the City" alive — even if it means
through your lunch. Sexy for sexy. Best, Richard.

ened by Crest White Strips, but that'll be our little
secret). But on one particular Sunday, as the clock
tower chimed 9:15 p.m., this group of singers
knocked on the doors of a house full of giil but
not a sound was to be heard.
"Where are all the lovely young ladies?" in
quired a debonair tenor. "All their carriages are in
the lot, and 1 know of no social gatherings supply
ing barrels of Natural Ale that would distract
them at this hour. 1 wonder where they're hiding."
But the story does not end in this sad, confused
sta te — a sole female stepped outside and politely
informed the gentlemen that all the girls were
watching "Sex and the City,' and that they could
not be disturbed.

These girls have entered the realm of "It's not
TV, it's HBO" and won't be back until 9:30 p.m.
That is of course, unless she's a Curb Your Enthu
siasm fan — in which case, she won't be back til
10 p.m.
Don't worry, guys. Unless you are one of the
select few who do enjoy the show, you won't have
to put up with this 30-minutes-of-silence for much
longer— five more days to be exact. And girls, I
mourn with you the loss of our beloved friends:
Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda.
That's right — this coming Sunday will mark
the end of an era. No more weekly sightings of
Manolo Blahniks, Smith Jared, the Russian (thank
god) and the ever poignant-yet-metaphorical
phrase of the week. I would love to add failed re
lationships to the list, but unfortunately we see
those all too often.
So to pay homage to six years of an amazing re
lationship between "Sex and the City" and all of
us, I think it's time we live it up Carrie-style right
here on the Farm. It's time to recreate "Sex and
the City" — well at least 40 minutes from the City.
I would say Sex and the Town, to be more exact,
but for some reason that sounds very wrong.
Now since the college budget usually can't ac
commodate the $400 pair of shoes habit (even
though I don't see how Carrie's salary did either),
we probably won't be following their footsteps in
the fashion realm. But the show is about more
than just the jeweled stilettos, Dolce dresses and
Burberry dog sweaters. It's about the let's-dish

about-our-lives lunches and the let's celebrate
our-fabulousness dinners. Although we can't
power lunch at Balthazar or order cosmos at Sushi
Samba, we can still get the concept right.
Since the power lunching doesn't have the
same feel in Wilbur dining (although in one
episode the girls visit a cafeteria-style restaurant),
I suggest you go off campus for this homage to the
show. So obviously, the next question is where
should a group of fabulous friends dine while ana
lyzing their lives? And as Carrie's alter-ego (say
hello to Carrie flrorf-shaw), there are a few places
that would be perfect for the occasion.
For the dish-session in the morning/afternoon
hours, the University Cafe (shockingly on Univer
sity Ave.) provides an airy, classic environment
with a delectable menu. The "health-smart," clean
preparation in no way undercuts the taste and tex
ture of a diverse menu that will please even the
Miranda in the group (she won't admit to being
the Miranda, but she is).
To give you a little sample, it offers a juice and
smoothie bar, amazingly-fresh quesadillas, walnut
and spinach salads topped with grilled salmon and
a trio of ground beef, ahi tuna and turkey burgers
served with three chutney spreads.
The place, however, isn't without its faults.
The tablecloths feel as if they're made out of 70s
polyester, the chairs could use a sense of style and
the omelettes are often wet and bland — but this
is my personal opinion.
Aside from these minor drawbacks, the caf£ of

fers a quaint and open space with decidedly classic
fare. The square tables are perfect fora group of
four to share their drama, and the atmosphere is
bright enough to add an optimistic tinge to the
whole experience.
And I couldn't help but wonder, since every
one wants to be uplifted after a solid session of
dishing, why go to a place where the dishes them
selves weigh you down? The massive grease feast
should take place when you've got some guys
around to have chili-fries-eating contests with.
Show him who's boss, girls.
Since I'm in denial that the show is leaving. I
can't admit that this is the end. To keep the Car
rie-party alive I'll save the discussion of the fabu
lous dinner for next week. Ti\ then, cross your fin
gers that she chooses Big and dumps the geriatric
Russian and chooses New York over Paris.
So love your friends, over-analyze your life,
buy a pair of expensive shoes and keep the spirit of
"Sex and the City" alive — even if it means
through your lunch. Sexy for sexy. Best, Richard.
