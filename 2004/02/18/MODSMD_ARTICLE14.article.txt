## Reveal our housing, dining costs 
### 
Every year, the total costs of housing and
dining are summed and billed to students.
Since Residential and Dining Enterprises
holds an effective monopoly on student
housing within walking distance from the academic
campus, students have little choice but to live on
campus and pay Residential and Dining Enterpris
es assessments.
In that respect. Residential and Dining Enterprises
operates somewhat like a customer-owned, profes
sionally managed cooperative, similar to many coun
try clubs. Yet Residential and Dining Enterprises gov
ernance falls well short compared to these cooperative
organizations, and pales in comparison to public com
pany accountability. Despite student efforts, Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises refuses to provide access
to relevant financial information, such as cost details
and budgets, to its student stakeholders.
In the absence of customer choice, the incentives
to control housing and dining costs are substantially
diminished. Though the Board of Trustees must ap
prove annual Residential and Dining Enterprises in
creases, there is generally less scrutiny of Residential
and Dining Enterprises because the costs are lower
than tuition, and the annual increases are often
smaller. However, with next year's whopping 6.1 per
cent housing price increase. Residential and Dining
Enterprises costs have ballooned to levels approach
ing twice the cost of housing (per square foot) and
dining (per meal served) as nearby providers of hous
ing and food.
Releasing cost information to students would pro
vide opportunities for students to suggest adjust
ments to bring costs back under control. Increased
transparency would also demonstrate an earnest
commitment to cost containment and trust in stu
dents that would reduce the perception among stu
dents that they are being ripped off. And a reduction
in this perception would likely enhance alumni dona
tion rates.

Shirley Everett, assistant vice provost for Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises, stated that Stan
ford's policy is not to release Residential and Dining
Enterprises "confidential and proprietary" informa
tion to students or their representatives. However,
we believe that a detailed release of most financial in
formation is feasible without divulging proprietary
information. In addition, since Residential and Din
ing Enterprises is essentially a regulated monopoly
exempt from typical real estate costs, it should have
little to fear in the way of competition regardless of
the information they release. Furthermore, there
exist countless precedents where ASSU committee
representatives have reviewed confidential informa
tion regarding substantially more far-reaching and
sensitive matters.
Indeed, Residential and Dining Enterprises' ap
parent mistrust of students may be rooted elsewhere.
Last year, one Residential and Dining Enterprises of
ficial expressed concern that Residential and Dining
Enterprises feared a backlash from labor rights groups
following a release of detailed information. A Resi
dential and Dining Enterprises manager also raised
the possibility of tacit or explicit collusion among peer
institutions against releasing such information. We are
opposed to withholding information from stakehold
ers on either of these grounds.
It is unreasonable for Residential and Dining En
terprises accountability to fall so far short of gover
nance norms at public companies, cooperatives and
regulated monopolies. While the ideal solution
would involve making detailed information avail
able to all paying students, there remains ample
room to compromise — such as allowing full access
to student representatives or restricting student ac
cess to certain particularly sensitive areas such as in
dividual worker pay rates. However, the current pol
icy — withholding all detailed Residential and Din
ing Enterprises information from all students — is
unacceptable.
