# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## Stanford gets a reality check 
### 
Stanford students have been
actively participating in real
ity television shows for
years, even before the recent
explosion in that genre. Stanford
undergrad Kameelah appeared on
one of the first seasons of MTV's
"Real World." Then, just this past
year, Adam represented the Farm
to the fullest in Paris, bringing unin
tentional comedy to new heights
with his soulful raps about unre
quited love in the confessional
booth (honestly, I can't believe he
didn't get a record deal out of that).
And now, senior Aaron Levine is
set to compete in ESPN's new real
ity show "Dream Job" beginning
this Sunday, although taking a part
on "Playmakers" as the new 'roid
raging crack-head running back
might be the better career choice.
In any case, I think it's about
time that Stanford got on the ball
and dove headfirst into the produc
tion of reality TV shows — instead
of just sending its students to get
massacred on national television.
So I have risen to the challenge and
come up with a couple of ideas for
reality shows that could be shot
right here on campus and would
immediately spice up SCBN's pal
try lineup.
Watching last summer's hit
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"
in which a team of five hip and cul
tured gay men conduct a full
makeover fora clueless, unkempt
heterosexual, a friend and I came up
with "Frat Eye for the Nerd Guy."
On this guaranteed smash, a
bunch of well-meaning fraternity
guys would perform their own
makeover by dipping into the pool
of Stanford's — how should I say,
— rather bookish crowd and teach
much desired skills like shot-gun
ning beers and spotting vulnerable
freshman girls. Not only would
"Frat Eye for the Nerd Guy" pro

vide top-notch entertainment, but
it would also do the community a
service and give us frat guys some-

thing to do with
our time other
than dealing with
inane University
sanctions.
Equally enter
taining would be a
show based on
Fox's "Who Wants
to Marry a Mil
lionaire" entitled
"Who Wants to

Sleep with a Basketball Player." On
each episode, a throng of Stanford's
finest young women would duke it
out over the basketball team's
hottest new star — who would then
choose a potential bed-mate out of
the lot. And, unlike on network TV,
my show would go behind closed
doors and capture all of the action
— all the way to the following morn
ing's "walk of shame." Plus, assort
ed Pi Phis and well-known "jersey
chasers" could impart expert
commentary throughout the show to
give viewers greater insight into the
intricacies of the contest. Later
episodes could shed light on whether
the victorious young lady becomes
more than just a one-night stand and
perhaps even gets added to the bas
ketball star's already sizable harem
of booty-call candidates. "Bracket
Buster" and "PTP-er" would take
on whole new meanings in this
game, as the public would get a
chance to see if our basketball
team's record is unblemished in the
bedroom as well.
Next, a captivating season of
"Cribs" could easily be filmed on
our campus — although it might not
equal the bling-bling of MTV's ver
sion. Our "Cribs" would bring view
ers inside the always-entertaining
co-op Synergy and check out hippie
living — and naked cooking — at

its finest. Forties of malt liquor and
buckets of KFC might not fill Syner
gy's refrigerator like it did at Lu
dacris' home, but Synergy makes up
for it with its unparalleled drum cir
cles, Che Guevara love fests and
acid flashbacks. Another segment of
"Cribs" could bring us into the
home of "El Presidente" — Uni
versity President John Hennessy
himself — and show how our "num
ber one stunna" truly holds it down.
Doesn't everyone want to see where
all the magic happens, Hennessy's
master bedroom? I know I do.
Lastly, SCBN could give MTV its
third installment of "Making the
Band," with an inside look into Tes
timony, our campus' Christian a
cappella group. From the outside,
the life of a Testimony star may look
like a typical case of sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll (rumor has it that Testi
mony gives Motley Crue a run for its
money as far as groupies go). But
there has to be more to Testimony
than binge drinking and backstage
orgies — and "Making the Band 3"
would give the public all the answers
we're desperately seeking.
Stanford prides itself on being
the cream of the crop when it comes
to academics, athletics and the arts.
But it's about time it steps up to the
table with some legit reality shows,
and this list of four shows could
serve as a start.
Trust me, you'll thank me later
— especially when a trio of Testi
mony singers piles into the hot tub
for some late night debauchery.
And who knows ... if Josh Chil
dress joins the party, SCBN's reali
ty shows might just end up giving
"Real World" a run for its money.

Mac Levine is a senior majoring in
international relations and he
promises to be just as obnoxious all
volume long. E-mail him with your

would give the public all the answers
we're desperately seeking.
Stanford prides itself on being
the cream of the crop when it comes

But it's about time it steps up to the
table with some legit reality shows,

Trust me, you'll thank me later

"Real World" a run for its money.

Stanford students have been
actively participating in real
ity television shows for
years, even before the recent
explosion in that genre. Stanford
undergrad Kameelah appeared on
one of the first seasons of MTV's
"Real World." Then, just this past
year, Adam represented the Farm
to the fullest in Paris, bringing unin
tentional comedy to new heights
with his soulful raps about unre
quited love in the confessional
booth (honestly, I can't believe he
didn't get a record deal out of that).
And now, senior Aaron Levine is
set to compete in ESPN's new real
ity show "Dream Job" beginning
this Sunday, although taking a part
on "Playmakers" as the new 'roid
raging crack-head running back
might be the better career choice.
In any case, I think it's about
time that Stanford got on the ball
and dove headfirst into the produc
tion of reality TV shows — instead
of just sending its students to get
massacred on national television.
So I have risen to the challenge and
come up with a couple of ideas for
reality shows that could be shot
right here on campus and would
immediately spice up SCBN's pal
try lineup.
Watching last summer's hit
"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"
in which a team of five hip and cul
tured gay men conduct a full
makeover fora clueless, unkempt
heterosexual, a friend and I came up
with "Frat Eye for the Nerd Guy."
On this guaranteed smash, a
bunch of well-meaning fraternity
guys would perform their own
makeover by dipping into the pool
of Stanford's — how should I say,
— rather bookish crowd and teach
much desired skills like shot-gun
ning beers and spotting vulnerable
freshman girls. Not only would
"Frat Eye for the Nerd Guy" pro

vide top-notch entertainment, but
it would also do the community a
service and give us frat guys some-

thing to do with
our time other
than dealing with
inane University
sanctions.
Equally enter
taining would be a
show based on
Fox's "Who Wants
to Marry a Mil
lionaire" entitled
"Who Wants to

Sleep with a Basketball Player." On
each episode, a throng of Stanford's
finest young women would duke it
out over the basketball team's
hottest new star — who would then
choose a potential bed-mate out of
the lot. And, unlike on network TV,
my show would go behind closed
doors and capture all of the action
— all the way to the following morn
ing's "walk of shame." Plus, assort
ed Pi Phis and well-known "jersey
chasers" could impart expert
commentary throughout the show to
give viewers greater insight into the
intricacies of the contest. Later
episodes could shed light on whether
the victorious young lady becomes
more than just a one-night stand and
perhaps even gets added to the bas
ketball star's already sizable harem
of booty-call candidates. "Bracket
Buster" and "PTP-er" would take
on whole new meanings in this
game, as the public would get a
chance to see if our basketball
team's record is unblemished in the
bedroom as well.
Next, a captivating season of
"Cribs" could easily be filmed on
our campus — although it might not
equal the bling-bling of MTV's ver
sion. Our "Cribs" would bring view
ers inside the always-entertaining
co-op Synergy and check out hippie
living — and naked cooking — at

its finest. Forties of malt liquor and
buckets of KFC might not fill Syner
gy's refrigerator like it did at Lu
dacris' home, but Synergy makes up
for it with its unparalleled drum cir
cles, Che Guevara love fests and
acid flashbacks. Another segment of
"Cribs" could bring us into the
home of "El Presidente" — Uni
versity President John Hennessy
himself — and show how our "num
ber one stunna" truly holds it down.
Doesn't everyone want to see where
all the magic happens, Hennessy's
master bedroom? I know I do.
Lastly, SCBN could give MTV its
third installment of "Making the
Band," with an inside look into Tes
timony, our campus' Christian a
cappella group. From the outside,
the life of a Testimony star may look
like a typical case of sex, drugs and
rock 'n' roll (rumor has it that Testi
mony gives Motley Crue a run for its
money as far as groupies go). But
there has to be more to Testimony
than binge drinking and backstage
orgies — and "Making the Band 3"
would give the public all the answers
