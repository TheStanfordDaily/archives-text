# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## Do readers decide the news? 
### 
If you are not among the 15
million who visited Internet
personality Matt Drudge's
Web site last week, then
maybe you haven't heard that
newly anointed Democratic front
runner, John Kerry, has an "intern
problem."
It turns out the term "bimbo
eruption" was not retired along
with the Clinton White House china
pattern. If the heavy traffic on Matt
Drudge's online Web site —
http://www.drudgereport.com — is
any indication, Americans still love
a good political sex scandal despite
all the criticism the media received
for gleefully rolling around in the
Lewinsky affair.
This dichotomy puts the media
in a bit of a quandary. First and
foremost, the news industry is a
moneymaking venture and even the
highbrow press has a financial in
centive to print juicy gossip. But tra
ditional journalism requires facts
and sources, both of which are ab
sent (so far) in the Kerry allegation.
Both Kerry and the suspected
"intern" — an Associated Press
reporter supposedly courted at
one point fora job on the Kerry
campaign — flatly deny the alle
gation. The woman is now living
with her fiancee in Kenya, and
both she and her parents have
gone on the record denying the ru
mors and even throwing in their
support for Kerry.
But without any collaborating
witnesses or evidence, the story
lives on. The "respectable" press
has found a way around the facts in
the same way I'm talking about the
Kerry story — in a slightly hypo
thetical, hypocritical look at the
role of the press, with a come-on to
the audience: Do you want us to
talk about this?
C'mon. Give us a reason.
Should gossip ever be news?
How much does a person's private
life figure into his or her public
role? These are old questions that
seem to get fresh answers every
few years, based not on journalistic
ethics but on the public's appetite
for scandal.
Currently the press has a wide

range in reporting. There are court
decisions codifying the fact that
those who put themselves in the

public eye have
less of a claim on
privacy than the
average citizen.
Those rulings
stretched to the
bedroom with the
presidential race
of 1988 and the
Democratic pres
idential con
tender, Colorado

Sen. Gary Hart. The story that ran
in the Miami Herald in 1987 was
prompted by an ill advised boast
Hart made to the media to counter
whispers of womanizing. Follow
me around, it will be boring, he
said, daring reporters to dig into
his closets for skeletons.
Reporters took the dare, and
soon Hart's dirty secrets — cou
pled with a photograph of a smiling
woman (not his wife) sitting on his
lap aboard the yacht "Monkey
Business" — were splashed all
over the newspapers. It was a ca
reer-ending image — one that also
ended the "gentleman's agree
ment" between politicians and the
press to ignore infidelities with a
wink and smile. President John F.
Kennedy might have benefited
from this agreement but no other
politician after Hart would.
President George H. W. Bush
got his share of grilling in the next
election in 1991. A footnote in a
book by Susan Trento, wife of CNN
reporter James Trento, sparked ru
mors of a Bush affair. The note was
from an interview with a long dead
ambassador who claimed to have
arranged fora tryst in 1984 be
tween Bush and a staffer.
The press picked up the tidbit
with gusto; the CNN White House
correspondent confronted the
President as he hosted Israel Prime
Minister Rabin in the Oval Office.
Newspapers carried the story on
their front pages, creating Sunday
morning talk show fodder.
Interestingly, Newsweek
columnist Jonathan Alter, who de
cried both the Clinton sex scandal

and now the Kerry story as "sleazy
reporting," actually supported the
investigation of President H. W.
Bush saying, "In this situation, the
Oval Office isn't a temple. The
President is a candidate and he has
to be asked tough, often distaste
ful, but nonetheless important
kinds of questions."
Partisanship aside, Alter poses
the million-dollar question for edi
tors who are empowered to report
the news (whatever that is) and act
as the "watchdogs" of our govern
ment: When is sex an "important"
question?
So far the mainstream press has
kept the Kerry question off the
front pages for reasons of taste and
journalistic ethics, ironically fuel
ing charges of a "media cover-up."
But as editors watch the rising sales
of the smaller papers running the
rumor as a news story in the public
interest, the reluctance to keep the
story quiet may be losing out to the
desire to make a buck.
So ultimately the public de
cides the standards. If newspaper
sales didn't jump through the roof
during the Lewinsky mess, the
story would have died out much
sooner. I don't believe sex is ever
an important question unless, like
in the affair between Kennedy
and a mob boss's girlfriend, na
tional security is in jeopardy. Oth
erwise I'd like to keep private
parts private.
Unfortunately, the public's ap
parently insatiable interest in sex
and politics will undermine any
media attempts to "keep it clean."
The questions gossip poses are now
answered with the dollar rather
than a set of standards, and the
media's coverage of public issues is
decided almost completely by what
readers want to know — which is a
sad comment when the public
chooses salacious gossip over, say, a
war in Iraq.

Sen. Gary Hart. The story that ran
in the Miami Herald in 1987 was
prompted by an ill advised boast
Hart made to the media to counter
whispers of womanizing. Follow
me around, it will be boring, he
said, daring reporters to dig into
his closets for skeletons.
Reporters took the dare, and
soon Hart's dirty secrets — cou
pled with a photograph of a smiling
woman (not his wife) sitting on his
lap aboard the yacht "Monkey
Business" — were splashed all
over the newspapers. It was a ca
reer-ending image — one that also
ended the "gentleman's agree
ment" between politicians and the
press to ignore infidelities with a
wink and smile. President John F.
Kennedy might have benefited
from this agreement but no other
politician after Hart would.
President George H. W. Bush
got his share of grilling in the next
election in 1991. A footnote in a
book by Susan Trento, wife of CNN
reporter James Trento, sparked ru
mors of a Bush affair. The note was
from an interview with a long dead
ambassador who claimed to have
arranged fora tryst in 1984 be
tween Bush and a staffer.
The press picked up the tidbit
with gusto; the CNN White House
correspondent confronted the
President as he hosted Israel Prime
Minister Rabin in the Oval Office.
Newspapers carried the story on
their front pages, creating Sunday
morning talk show fodder.
Interestingly, Newsweek
columnist Jonathan Alter, who de
cried both the Clinton sex scandal

and now the Kerry story as "sleazy
reporting," actually supported the
investigation of President H. W.
Bush saying, "In this situation, the
Oval Office isn't a temple. The
President is a candidate and he has
to be asked tough, often distaste
ful, but nonetheless important
kinds of questions."
Partisanship aside, Alter poses
the million-dollar question for edi
tors who are empowered to report
the news (whatever that is) and act
as the "watchdogs" of our govern
ment: When is sex an "important"
question?
So far the mainstream press has
kept the Kerry question off the
front pages for reasons of taste and
journalistic ethics, ironically fuel
ing charges of a "media cover-up."
But as editors watch the rising sales
of the smaller papers running the
rumor as a news story in the public
interest, the reluctance to keep the
story quiet may be losing out to the
desire to make a buck.
So ultimately the public de
cides the standards. If newspaper
sales didn't jump through the roof
during the Lewinsky mess, the
story would have died out much
sooner. I don't believe sex is ever
an important question unless, like
in the affair between Kennedy
and a mob boss's girlfriend, na
tional security is in jeopardy. Oth
erwise I'd like to keep private
parts private.
Unfortunately, the public's ap
parently insatiable interest in sex
and politics will undermine any
media attempts to "keep it clean."
The questions gossip poses are now
answered with the dollar rather
than a set of standards, and the
media's coverage of public issues is
decided almost completely by what
readers want to know — which is a
sad comment when the public
chooses salacious gossip over, say, a
war in Iraq.

If you are not among the 15
million who visited Internet
personality Matt Drudge's
Web site last week, then
maybe you haven't heard that
newly anointed Democratic front
runner, John Kerry, has an "intern
problem."
It turns out the term "bimbo
eruption" was not retired along
with the Clinton White House china
pattern. If the heavy traffic on Matt
Drudge's online Web site —
http://www.drudgereport.com — is
any indication, Americans still love
a good political sex scandal despite
all the criticism the media received
for gleefully rolling around in the
Lewinsky affair.
This dichotomy puts the media
in a bit of a quandary. First and
foremost, the news industry is a
moneymaking venture and even the
highbrow press has a financial in
centive to print juicy gossip. But tra
ditional journalism requires facts
and sources, both of which are ab
sent (so far) in the Kerry allegation.
Both Kerry and the suspected
"intern" — an Associated Press
reporter supposedly courted at
one point fora job on the Kerry
campaign — flatly deny the alle
gation. The woman is now living
with her fiancee in Kenya, and
both she and her parents have
gone on the record denying the ru
mors and even throwing in their
support for Kerry.
But without any collaborating
witnesses or evidence, the story
lives on. The "respectable" press
has found a way around the facts in
the same way I'm talking about the
Kerry story — in a slightly hypo
thetical, hypocritical look at the
role of the press, with a come-on to
the audience: Do you want us to
talk about this?
C'mon. Give us a reason.
Should gossip ever be news?
How much does a person's private
life figure into his or her public
role? These are old questions that
seem to get fresh answers every
few years, based not on journalistic
ethics but on the public's appetite
for scandal.
Currently the press has a wide

range in reporting. There are court
decisions codifying the fact that
those who put themselves in the

public eye have
less of a claim on
privacy than the
average citizen.
