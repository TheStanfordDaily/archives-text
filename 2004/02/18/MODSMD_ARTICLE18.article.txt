## Members of the Senior Class should try to contribute to Senior Gift 
### STEVEN HAZY 
As co-chairs of the 2004 Senior Gift Cam
paign, we'd like to take this opportunity to
share our excitement about our class' cam
paign and answer a few questions seniors
have been asking.
Senior Gift is a unified class donation to
the Stanford Fund, which supports more
than 1,000 scholarships each year as well as
Undergraduate Research Program grants,
Stanford Introductory Seminars, Overseas
Studies Programs, Sophomore College,
Honors College, campus community cen
ters and many student groups on campus,
among other initiatives. Senior Gift is an ex
cellent way for soon-to-be graduating se
niors to make a gift back to Stanford. And
by contributing, seniors show their support
and thanks for the opportunities and pro
grams that make a Stanford education so
exceptional.

Many seniors ask, "Haven't I given Stan
ford enough of my money?" A Stanford ed
ucation is very expensive but most students
don't realize that tuition only covers 60 per
cent of the total cost of being a Stanford stu
dent. The remainder comes from other
sources such as gifts from alumni, parents,
friends and students. Stanford does have a
large endowment, but income from it only
covers about 16 percent of Stanford's annu
al operating budget. When compared to the
endowments of our Ivy League counterparts
— and given the size and scope of our aca
demic programs — we are relatively under
endowed. Therefore, without gifts to the
Stanford Fund, most of the scholarships,
programs, resources, student groups and
teaching innovations that we have all taken
advantage of would not exist.
Roughly 60 percent of all funds raised by
the Stanford Fund go directly to support fi
nancial aid. About 73 percent of Stanford

students receive some sort of financial aid.
Therefore, gifts from alumni, parents and
students to the Stanford Fund enable Stan
ford to keep its need-blind admission policy.
So why are we asking seniors to donate?
The answer is very simple. The Stanford
Fund has made it possible for each and every
one of us to have a Stanford education and
we want to make sure our class does its part
to ensure that future Stanford students will
have the opportunities that we had.
Senior Gift is not a tradition unique only
to Stanford University. Our peers at many
colleges and universities across the nation
have similar campaigns, but generous finan
cial matches from Peter Bing and the Par
ents' Advisory Board make Stanford's Se
nior Gift program significantly different.
Our $3-to-$l match turns a $20 donation to
Senior Gift into $80 for the Stanford Fund
and a $250 donation into $1,000. Nowhere
else can you quadruple an investment to di

rectly benefit Stanford undergraduates.
Every gift, regardless of size, is important.
And for every 10 percent of our class that
participates, the Young Boozer Family
Foundation will donate an additional $2,000
to our total Senior Gift donation. How's that
for encouragement?
We've recruited one of the largest Partic
ipation Committees in recent history and we
are honored to work with this extremely en
ergetic and devoted team of 50 seniors. All
committee members have volunteered their
time and energy to ensure the success of the
Senior Gift Campaign. Each of them will be
a critical force in ensuring that you, our
classmates, understand the importance of
annual giving. We will be contacting every
senior to encourage you to contribute and
help make our goal of 66 percent participa
tion a reality.
Our campaign is not simply about raising
money — it's about educating our class

mates about the importance of annual giving
and encouraging them to make a lasting dif
ference for future generations of Stanford
students. Stanford has given so much to each
and every one of us over the past four years,
and making a Senior Gift is a great way to
say thanks for this incredible experience.
We are confident that the Class of 2004
will exceed the high standards set by previ
ous classes in supporting Stanford. If you
have any questions about the campaign,
please don't hesitate to contact one of of the
Senior Gift co-chairs. We look forward to an
exciting rest of the year.

friends and students. Stanford does have a
large endowment, but income from it only
covers about 16 percent of Stanford's annu
al operating budget. When compared to the
endowments of our Ivy League counterparts
— and given the size and scope of our aca
demic programs — we are relatively under
endowed. Therefore, without gifts to the
Stanford Fund, most of the scholarships,
programs, resources, student groups and
teaching innovations that we have all taken
advantage of would not exist.
Roughly 60 percent of all funds raised by
the Stanford Fund go directly to support fi
nancial aid. About 73 percent of Stanford

students receive some sort of financial aid.
Therefore, gifts from alumni, parents and
students to the Stanford Fund enable Stan
ford to keep its need-blind admission policy.
So why are we asking seniors to donate?
The answer is very simple. The Stanford
Fund has made it possible for each and every
one of us to have a Stanford education and
we want to make sure our class does its part
to ensure that future Stanford students will
have the opportunities that we had.
Senior Gift is not a tradition unique only
to Stanford University. Our peers at many
colleges and universities across the nation
have similar campaigns, but generous finan
cial matches from Peter Bing and the Par
ents' Advisory Board make Stanford's Se
nior Gift program significantly different.
Our $3-to-$l match turns a $20 donation to
Senior Gift into $80 for the Stanford Fund
and a $250 donation into $1,000. Nowhere
else can you quadruple an investment to di

rectly benefit Stanford undergraduates.
Every gift, regardless of size, is important.
And for every 10 percent of our class that
participates, the Young Boozer Family
Foundation will donate an additional $2,000
to our total Senior Gift donation. How's that
for encouragement?
We've recruited one of the largest Partic
ipation Committees in recent history and we
are honored to work with this extremely en
ergetic and devoted team of 50 seniors. All
committee members have volunteered their
time and energy to ensure the success of the
Senior Gift Campaign. Each of them will be
a critical force in ensuring that you, our
classmates, understand the importance of
annual giving. We will be contacting every
senior to encourage you to contribute and
help make our goal of 66 percent participa
tion a reality.
Our campaign is not simply about raising
money — it's about educating our class

mates about the importance of annual giving
and encouraging them to make a lasting dif
ference for future generations of Stanford
students. Stanford has given so much to each
and every one of us over the past four years,
and making a Senior Gift is a great way to
say thanks for this incredible experience.
We are confident that the Class of 2004
will exceed the high standards set by previ
ous classes in supporting Stanford. If you
have any questions about the campaign,
please don't hesitate to contact one of of the
Senior Gift co-chairs. We look forward to an
exciting rest of the year.
