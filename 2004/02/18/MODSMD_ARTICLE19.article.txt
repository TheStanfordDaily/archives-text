Rope tape should be respected as a symbol
Why are people having such a hard time
coming to terms with the V-Day "Rape Free
Zone" tape? To me, the "Rape Free Zone"
is a symbolic expression of the acknowledg
ment of rape as a problem and a commit
ment to work towards its eradication. In
stead of frat guys seeing the "Rape Free
Zone" tape as an attack or a condemnation,
why not recognize the fact that we live in a
rape culture and we need everyone —
whether man or woman, queer or straight
— to stand in solidarity against rape?
Speaking out about violence against women
is not male bashing. Neither is saying that
anyone is a potential rapist. In the United
States, rapes occur with a shocking frequen
cy. And this is not just rape in the sense of an
unknown man lurking in the bushes and
jumping out to attack a woman. A vast ma
jority of rapes are committed by people that
the victim knows — a colleague, an acquain

tance, even a partner. So who, then, are the
"rapists?" For the frat guys who got offend
ed at the imposition of "Rape Free Zone"
tape on their residences: Instead of getting
defensive and feeling like you're being ac
cused, why not join in the fight to end rape
and sexual assault? Women activists and
survivors of sexual assault can't keep
preaching to the choir. It's up to men to take
up the struggle as well.

Don't confuse non-violence with passivity
In her recent wrangling with anti-intel
lectualism ("Apathy as Gen Y's Social
Protest?" Feb. 17), Charlotte Band did well
to offer readers an ambitious and open
minded appraisal where cynicism typically
obtains. It must have been a slip, then, when

the author counted "passive resistance"
among the "major political and social move
ments of the twentieth century." She must
have meant "non-violent resistance."
One need only make the short visit to the
King Papers Project on campus, or the
shorter visit to its Web site, to read what
Rev. Martin Luther King said about non-vi
olent direct action: "[The resister's] method
is passive or nonaggressive in the sense that
he is not physically aggressive toward his op
ponent. But his mind and emotions are al
ways active, constantly seeking to persuade
the opponent that he is mistaken. This
method is passive physically but strongly ac
tive spiritually."
I doubt that King — one of the most pro
lific and articulate exponents of this resis
tance — would summarize his efforts as
"passive resistance." Nor would any of the
legion Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee-era activists, whose inspiration
can be directly traced to King. I have partic

ipated in only one such non-violent resis
tance myself, but I too would testify that
those efforts in blocking a San Francisco in
tersection to protest the Iraqi war were any
thing but passive.
Band might be heartened by the fact that
this event occurred less than a year ago and
involved dozens of Stanford students. But
she might also correctly note that that
March demonstration, while defying "apa
thy," did not amount to "intellectualism"
per se. Thus the dilemma remains. I can only
hope that the spirit of the "passionate
cause" of King and his followers was never
really abandoned; if it indeed has been, then
"passive resistance" will only come to refer
to the attitude with which our generation
disdains intellectualism.

Kudos to administrators for supporting

same-sex marriage
I wanted to extend my congratulations
and thanks to Rick Yuen (Assistant Dean
and Director of the Asian American Activi
ties Center), Ben Davidson (Assistant Dean
of the Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Commu
nity Center) and all other members of the
Stanford community who participated in or
officiated over the same-sex marriage cere
monies in San Francisco over the weekend.
I work in City Hall, and since Thursday my
work has been interrupted by overwhelming
cries of joy erupting from the crowds each
time a couple emerges with a marriage li
cense. It has been truly incredible to see the
convergence of loving couples and families,
and I take my hats off to all the Stanford
community members who are working to
make it possible.
