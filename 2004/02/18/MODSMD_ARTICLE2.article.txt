# Sophomore focus groups aid advising
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Approximately 150 sopho
mores have expressed their con
cerns with and offered suggestions
for Stanford's advising programs in
focus groups coordinated and led
by the ASSU.
The student government con
tinues to organize the one-time
meetings of nine to 10 students to
encourage open dialogue on un
dergraduate advising at Stanford,
especially first-year advising.
According to ASSU President
Nadiya Figueroa, proposed im
provements to the freshman-year
advising program include the addi
tion of "point people" to the staff
of each department, in order to
help acquaint students with the of
ferings of each major.
Figueroa, a senior, and Vice
President Joey Natoli, a junior,
created the initiative after meeting
with the senior staff of the Under
graduate Advising Center (UAC)
at the beginning of their term.
The objective of the initiative is
"to get truthful and significant
feedback from students, specifical
ly sophomores, on their advising
experiences in order to make con
structive recommendations to the
UAC on areas that can be im
proved," Figueroa said.
Because the UAC's own sur
veys generally show high levels of
student satisfaction, Figueroa said
that it has previously been difficult
for the UAC and other University
departments to pinpoint problems
with the system.
Through focus group discus
sions, students "get to put things
within a context and give the entire
story instead of filling out a multi
ple choice survey and minimizing
their issues to a yes or no answer,"
Figueroa explained.
Figueroa — who has facilitated

some of the groups — stressed that
the focus groups have acted as more
than just a forum for complaints.
"People see the pros and cons of
our advising and in general under
stand that its very complex to craft
an advising system that is going to
cater to a student population like
Stanford's," she said.
The advising groups allow par
ticipants to directly contribute
their thoughts for an hour and fif
teen minutes during a dinner meet
ing at Tresidder Union. Additional
incentives include the opportunity
to win prizes, such as dinner, movie
gift certificates or a trip for two to
Los Angeles.
Between Jan. 26 and Feb. 23,
the ASSU scheduled 15 groups.
They will continue to add meetings
until they reach the goal of having
210 sophomores participate by the
end of the quarter.
The sophomore class cabinet
has worked alongside the ASSU to
facilitate the most recent discus
sions and to help recruit students
through e-mail announcements.
Next quarter, the ASSU hopes
to recruit more sophomores in res
idences such as Mirrielees and the
fraternity houses.
Katherine Wang, a member of
the sophomore class cabinet, has
facilitated two groups and attend
ed two others.
"Everybody who has attended
has been very open and honest
about their freshman advising ex
perience," she said, explaining that
many students share the same is
sues with the current system.
Figueroa described the pro
gram as a primarily student-led
initiative, but also acknowledged
the project as a joint effort with
the office of the Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education and
the UAC.
