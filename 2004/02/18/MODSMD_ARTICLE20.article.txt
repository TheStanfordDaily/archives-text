## Damn Yankees: Why the A-Rod trade is simply bad for baseball 
### 
Let it be known that I've always said that
the New York Yankees rank slightly
below Carson Daly and vegetarianism in
my own personal hierarchy of hatred,
but this takes it to a new level. On Sunday, the
Yankees traded for über-shortstop Alex Ro
driguez. continuing his tenure as the highest
paid player in baseball, now as a part of the team
with the highest payroll. New Yorkers, rejoice:
You have one more thing to distract you from
the fact that you live in an ugly hellhole.
Red Sox Nation, in contrast, is in abject de
spair. After enduring a seven-game ALCS loss

to their hated rivals that was
more painful than Ben Af
fleck's career, they have to sit
and watch the star who was all
but theirs pop bombs over the
Green Monster in pinstripes.
After failing to pick up Ro
driguez over the winter in a
trade, the Red Sox are stuck
with a jilted shortstop and a sta
dium full of vengeful fans.
The Yankees are the an-

tithesis of the American Dream. Their formula
ic approach to success isn't based on negotiating
skill or even the cash to buy the best players —
it's the fact that they have the cash to absorb
their mistakes. When a player fails to live up to
expectations, any other team is forced to labor
under the burden of his contract. The Yankees
can just buy out his deal, twirl the ends of their
mustaches, cackle with glee and move on to snap
up the next All-Star.
The entire premise of the Yankees' approach
to the A-Rod deal, with regard to what's good
for baseball, is flawed. Despite the fact that he
may generate huge marketing value, it's impos
sible to believe that for the cost of his contract, a
team couldn't have bought two other quality po
sition players. For the same price, the Yankees
probably could have picked up Albert Pujols or
Eric Chavez, two players not better than, but
comparable to, A-Rod in both offensive and de
fensive capabilities — and had money to spare
to pay now-Ranger Alfonso Soriano.
Furthermore, they wouldn't have had to
take a man who could be the best to ever play
shortstop and move him to third base. Third
base is tough. Cal Ripken, a man whose Hall
of Fame credentials (and word choices) are
untouchable, once said of the hot corner: "I
started out at third base and got hit in the nuts
all the time. Then I moved to shortstop and
didn't get hit for 1 1 years. Then 1 moved back
to third and got hit in the nuts again."
Whether Rodriguez succeeds there or not,
he'll be betraying his talents as a Yankee.
Nobody is accusing A-Rod of selling out.
Let's be honest, how many of us would deny our
selves the opportunity to sell our services to the
highest bidder, particularly when that bidder is
willing to give you a quarter of a billion dollars?
The man earns $ 14,403 for every inning he's on
the field. How does he sleep at night, you ask?
On top of a Scrooge McDuck-like pile of cash
(and probably incredibly attractive naked
women), and you're lying if you say you
wouldn't do the same. Still, it's ludicrous to look
at this situation as positive for the sport — espe
cially when you consider Texas is paying more
than a third of A-Rod's remaining contract for
the Yankees just to get the best player in base
ball out of Texas.
The Yankees' relationship with Rodriguez
artificially inflates his market value by convinc
ing every team that he is actually worth the value
of his exorbitant contract simply because they're
willing to pay it. They perpetuate the cycle of
overpaying players and, by extension, the de
pendence on financial resources to win that has
plagued baseball since the advent of the players'
union. You want an answer to why baseball is
rapidly losing ground to the NFL in popularity
across the nation? Look at the parity in the NFL.
Two different teams make the Super Bowl al
most every year, while in baseball it's considered
a groundbreaking achievement if a team west of
the Mississippi reaches the playoffs. In the last
10 years, a grand total of three teams have
reached the World Series from the American
League — and seven times the AL representa
tive was the Yankees.
The best analogy to this situation was made
by a friend of mine who compared the Yankee
monopoly to the Stanford dating scene. Let's
start from the fact that there are approximately
eight attractive girls at Stanford. If the one guy
who happens to be the son of the CEO of Oracle
can afford to spend lavishly on all of them in ad
dition to all of the marginally attractive girls, the
girls begin to expect such treatment from guys
who can't cough it up. Hence, lonely K.C. Royal
stays home on Saturday night, watching his
"Home Run Hitters Gone Wild" tapes in shame.
Come April, Rodriguez will suit up and take
the field with the rest of the Bronx Bombers' $72
million infield, to the delight of baseball analysts
across the country. Maybe he'll succeed under
the spotlight, and maybe he won't. But regardless
of whether he and the Yankees win the World
Series this year, professional baseball's corpse
will be rolling over in its grave.

sorry for Mr. Royal and want K. C. 's digits — or if
you 're a Yankees fan and think (mistakenly) that
you have something to say.
