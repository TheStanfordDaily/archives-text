# Bars, Cardinal fall at Oklahoma
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
If you think weird things don't
actually happen on Friday the 13th,
talk to the women's gymnastics
team. When sophomore Natalie
Foley mounted the uneven bars at
last Friday's meet in Oklahoma, the
bars collapsed and completely
ripped out of the floor. Head coach
Kristen Smyth had never seen any
thing like it in her lifetime of gym
nastics experience.
"It was so bizarre," Smyth said.
"The bars just ripped out of the
floor and Nat was lucky to come out
with just a scratch. It was hard to
overcome the initial shock and it
killed the team's momentum."
After the freakish equipment
failure, the team moved on to vault,
floor exercise and balance beam.
Foley, senior Caroline Fluhrer and
sophomore Glyn Sweets had to
compete their bar routines at the
end of the meet after the bars had
been reassembled. A bit shaken up,
Foley and Fluhrer did not deliver
their typically high scores on bars —
both fell and scored 9.45.
The debacle on bars cost Stan
ford the meet. The team posted its
lowest bar score of the season, 48.7,
and the No. 7 Cardinal was narrow
ly upset by the No. 11 Sooners,
196.275 to 196.175.
"It's hard to say what would
have happened if the bars
hadn't come down," Smyth said.
"We never completely re
grouped afterwards."
Senior co-captain Lindsay

Wing completed her bar routine
before the bars collapsed and won
the event with a 9.925. Wing also
led Stanford with a winning per
formance on the balance beam
with a 9.9 and a third-place finish
in the all-around.
Despite the team's disappoint
ing performance on bars, Stanford
competed well on balance beam, its
highest scoring event of the evening.
After some uncharacteristically
shaky routines on the beam last
weekend against UCLA, Wing,
Leveille and sophomore Glyn
Sweets swept the event, placing
first, second and third, respectively.
Sophomore Jessica Louie led the
team on vault, performing a full
twisting Yurchenko to earn a vault
career-high of 9.875. After learning
the maximally difficult vault just last
summer, Louie won the event for
the first time in her Stanford career.
"It's taken a little while to learn,
but it's becoming more consistent
every week," Louie said. "It's a more
competitive vault and despite all the
room I have for improvement, it's
starting to come together."
Friday's meet was Stanford's
second consecutive loss on the
road. The Cardinal also lost to No.
3 UCLA last weekend. The
team's average score at away
meets, 196.03, is almost a full
point lower than its average score
at home, 196.97.
Gymnastics is a difficult sport
to compete in on the road, due not
only to differences in spectator
support but also to slight differ
ences in equipment — for exam

pie, some floors are springier than
others and some sets of uneven
bars are tighter than others (or, in
Oklahoma, less stable).
The gymnasts' major challenge,
however, seems to be packing the
energetic and confident attitude
they have at home when they travel
to other gyms.
"When we go on road, we tend
to get a bit tighter and a bit more in
ternal," Smyth said after the UCLA
meet. "We need to bring the same
excitement we have at home on the
road with us."
Fortunately, the team has two
more away meets this season, at
Oregon State and Maryland, which
will provide an opportunity for the
gymnasts to improve on the road
before they travel to NCAA Re
gional and Nationals in April.
Stanford will host its last home
meet this Friday against No. 28
California. Cal is an improving
team that placed fourth at NCAA
Regionals last year — its highest
finish since 1992, when Smyth
competed for Berkeley. Despite
its improvement, Cal will have a
hard time matching Stanford's
depth or talent, so the meet
promises to be a confidence
booster for the Cardinal.
Friday's meet will also be an
emotional climax for Stanford's five
graduating seniors. Leveille, Wing,
Fluhrer, Shelly Goldberg and
Kendall Beck will all be competing
in Burnham Pavilion for the last
time and are eager to go out with a
bang before hitting the road for the
remainder of the season.

more away meets this season, at
Oregon State and Maryland, which
will provide an opportunity for the
gymnasts to improve on the road
before they travel to NCAA Re
gional and Nationals in April.
Stanford will host its last home
meet this Friday against No. 28
California. Cal is an improving
team that placed fourth at NCAA
Regionals last year — its highest
finish since 1992, when Smyth
competed for Berkeley. Despite
its improvement, Cal will have a
hard time matching Stanford's
depth or talent, so the meet
promises to be a confidence
booster for the Cardinal.
Friday's meet will also be an
emotional climax for Stanford's five
graduating seniors. Leveille, Wing,
Fluhrer, Shelly Goldberg and
Kendall Beck will all be competing
in Burnham Pavilion for the last
time and are eager to go out with a
bang before hitting the road for the
remainder of the season.

The women's gymnastics team could not recover on Saturday after
the bars collapsed at Oklahoma.
If you think weird things don't
actually happen on Friday the 13th,
talk to the women's gymnastics
team. When sophomore Natalie
Foley mounted the uneven bars at
last Friday's meet in Oklahoma, the
bars collapsed and completely
ripped out of the floor. Head coach
Kristen Smyth had never seen any
thing like it in her lifetime of gym
nastics experience.
"It was so bizarre," Smyth said.
"The bars just ripped out of the
floor and Nat was lucky to come out
with just a scratch. It was hard to
overcome the initial shock and it
killed the team's momentum."
After the freakish equipment
failure, the team moved on to vault,
floor exercise and balance beam.
Foley, senior Caroline Fluhrer and
sophomore Glyn Sweets had to
compete their bar routines at the
end of the meet after the bars had
been reassembled. A bit shaken up,
Foley and Fluhrer did not deliver
their typically high scores on bars —
both fell and scored 9.45.
The debacle on bars cost Stan
ford the meet. The team posted its
lowest bar score of the season, 48.7,
and the No. 7 Cardinal was narrow
ly upset by the No. 11 Sooners,
196.275 to 196.175.
"It's hard to say what would
have happened if the bars
hadn't come down," Smyth said.
"We never completely re
grouped afterwards."
Senior co-captain Lindsay

Wing completed her bar routine
before the bars collapsed and won
the event with a 9.925. Wing also
led Stanford with a winning per
formance on the balance beam
with a 9.9 and a third-place finish
in the all-around.
Despite the team's disappoint
ing performance on bars, Stanford
competed well on balance beam, its
highest scoring event of the evening.
After some uncharacteristically
shaky routines on the beam last
weekend against UCLA, Wing,
Leveille and sophomore Glyn
Sweets swept the event, placing
first, second and third, respectively.
Sophomore Jessica Louie led the
team on vault, performing a full
twisting Yurchenko to earn a vault
career-high of 9.875. After learning
the maximally difficult vault just last
summer, Louie won the event for
the first time in her Stanford career.
"It's taken a little while to learn,
but it's becoming more consistent
every week," Louie said. "It's a more
competitive vault and despite all the
room I have for improvement, it's
starting to come together."
Friday's meet was Stanford's
second consecutive loss on the
road. The Cardinal also lost to No.
3 UCLA last weekend. The
team's average score at away
meets, 196.03, is almost a full
point lower than its average score
at home, 196.97.
Gymnastics is a difficult sport
to compete in on the road, due not
only to differences in spectator
support but also to slight differ
ences in equipment — for exam

pie, some floors are springier than
others and some sets of uneven
bars are tighter than others (or, in
Oklahoma, less stable).
The gymnasts' major challenge,
however, seems to be packing the
energetic and confident attitude
they have at home when they travel
to other gyms.
"When we go on road, we tend
to get a bit tighter and a bit more in
ternal," Smyth said after the UCLA
meet. "We need to bring the same
excitement we have at home on the
road with us."
Fortunately, the team has two
more away meets this season, at
Oregon State and Maryland, which
will provide an opportunity for the
gymnasts to improve on the road
before they travel to NCAA Re
gional and Nationals in April.
