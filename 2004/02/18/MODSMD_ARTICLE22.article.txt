# Softball sweeps Invitational
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
The No. 10 Stanford soltball
team started last weekend with
high hopes after winning three of
its first four games, including a
split with a then-No. 6 Alabama
squad. This past weekend's Stan
ford Invitational might push
their ranking even higher.
The Cardinal won all five of
its games en route to winning the
Invitational, a three-team tour
ney held Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. Stanford now
stands at 8-1 after defeating pre
viously undefeated Pacific once
and Santa Clara and Missouri
twice apiece in this weekend's
action.
There were many heroes for
the Cardinal this weekend, but
no one player was more inte
gral to the Card's tourney run
than senior pitcher Dana
"Lightning D" Sorensen, who

picked up three wins and a
save, including a victory in the
tourney championship game
against Santa Clara.
Sorensen was masterful in
that game, taking a three-hit
shutout into the final inning be
fore an error by center fielder
Catalina Morris led to an un
earned run, Santa Clara's lone
score in the 4-1 Cardinal victory.
Morris had more than compen
sated for her seventh-inning mis
calculation earlier in the game,
however, with a towering two
run homer to right field in the
third inning which staked the
Cardinal to a 3-0 lead that would
be enough to secure the victory.
Friday's action began with a
scare as star shortstop Lauren
Lappin, an All-Pacific-10 Con
ference selection last year as a
true freshman, took a grounder
to the face in pregame warm-ups
and was unable to start the first
game. Instead, freshman Lind

say Key was thrown into her first
career start as Lappin received
medical attention for injuries to
her face and nose.
With the pressure on. Key
lived up to her surname. In the
top of the first inning, with run
ners on second and third and one
out, she smoked a single up the
middle to score both baserun
ners and give the Cardinal its
first lead of the tournament. The
team never looked back, blank
ing Santa Clara, 5-0, and then de
feating a very good Missouri
pitcher in Friday's nightcap, 3-2,
to set up Saturday morning's
showcase matchup with then-un
defeated Pacific.
Pacific drew first blood, scor
ing a run in the top of the first in
ning against Cardinal pitcher
Laura Severson. However, Stan
ford got this run and two more
back in the bottom of the first.
