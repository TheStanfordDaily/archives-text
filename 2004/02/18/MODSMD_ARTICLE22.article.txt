# Softball sweeps Invitational
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
The No. 10 Stanford soltball
team started last weekend with
high hopes after winning three of
its first four games, including a
split with a then-No. 6 Alabama
squad. This past weekend's Stan
ford Invitational might push
their ranking even higher.
The Cardinal won all five of
its games en route to winning the
Invitational, a three-team tour
ney held Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. Stanford now
stands at 8-1 after defeating pre
viously undefeated Pacific once
and Santa Clara and Missouri
twice apiece in this weekend's
action.
There were many heroes for
the Cardinal this weekend, but
no one player was more inte
gral to the Card's tourney run
than senior pitcher Dana
"Lightning D" Sorensen, who

picked up three wins and a
save, including a victory in the
tourney championship game
against Santa Clara.
Sorensen was masterful in
that game, taking a three-hit
shutout into the final inning be
fore an error by center fielder
Catalina Morris led to an un
earned run, Santa Clara's lone
score in the 4-1 Cardinal victory.
Morris had more than compen
sated for her seventh-inning mis
calculation earlier in the game,
however, with a towering two
run homer to right field in the
third inning which staked the
Cardinal to a 3-0 lead that would
be enough to secure the victory.
Friday's action began with a
scare as star shortstop Lauren
Lappin, an All-Pacific-10 Con
ference selection last year as a
true freshman, took a grounder
to the face in pregame warm-ups
and was unable to start the first
game. Instead, freshman Lind

say Key was thrown into her first
career start as Lappin received
medical attention for injuries to
her face and nose.
With the pressure on. Key
lived up to her surname. In the
top of the first inning, with run
ners on second and third and one
out, she smoked a single up the
middle to score both baserun
ners and give the Cardinal its
first lead of the tournament. The
team never looked back, blank
ing Santa Clara, 5-0, and then de
feating a very good Missouri
pitcher in Friday's nightcap, 3-2,
to set up Saturday morning's
showcase matchup with then-un
defeated Pacific.
Pacific drew first blood, scor
ing a run in the top of the first in
ning against Cardinal pitcher
Laura Severson. However, Stan
ford got this run and two more
back in the bottom of the first.
keyed by a sacrifice by Lappin,
who played in all five games de
spite her facial injury. The Cardi
nal maintained the 3-1 lead until
the top of the final inning, when
Pacific was finally able to manufac
ture a run against freshman reliev
er Danika Dukes, who had pitched
4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief of
Severson. With a Pacific baserun
ner on third and the Cardinal hold
ing a tenuous 3-2 lead with two outs
in the bottom of the seventh, Stan
ford head coach John Rittman
called on his ace starter, Sorensen,
to close out the game. Sorensen,
nicknamed "Lightning D" for her
powerful repertoire of pitches,
struck out the last Pacific batter
swinging to nail down another Car
dinal victory.
Soon after closing out the
Pacific nail-biter, Sorensen
stepped into the circle again on
Saturday afternoon to start
against Missouri. This time.
Lightning struck twice in the
same game as Sorensen pitched
six shutout innings before giv
ing way to Dukes, then came
back to close out her own game
after Dukes quickly allowed
two Pacific runs in the final in
ning. As impressive as
Sorensen's pitching was, Satur
day's second game belonged to
senior catcher Jessica Allister,
who slammed two monstrous

home runs to lead the Cardinal
onslaught in their 5-2 victory.
This second win over Missouri
set up the Card's 4-1 champi
onship game victory against

Santa Clara on Sunday.
With five wins this weekend,
Stanford has reeled off seven
straight to make a statement to the
rest of the Pac-10. The Cardinal

will try to send another message
this Friday and Saturday at the
Palm Springs Classic against
Northwestern, Notre Dame and
Penn State.

The softball team swept the Stanford Invitational last weekend, beating Santa Clara, 4-1, in the finale. Senior pitch
er Dana Sorensen was the star of the series, winning three games and returning to save one of her own wins.
The No. 10 Stanford soltball
team started last weekend with
high hopes after winning three of
its first four games, including a
split with a then-No. 6 Alabama
squad. This past weekend's Stan
ford Invitational might push
their ranking even higher.
The Cardinal won all five of
its games en route to winning the
Invitational, a three-team tour
ney held Friday, Saturday and
Sunday at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. Stanford now
stands at 8-1 after defeating pre
viously undefeated Pacific once
and Santa Clara and Missouri
twice apiece in this weekend's
action.
There were many heroes for
the Cardinal this weekend, but
no one player was more inte
gral to the Card's tourney run
than senior pitcher Dana
"Lightning D" Sorensen, who

picked up three wins and a
save, including a victory in the
tourney championship game
against Santa Clara.
Sorensen was masterful in
that game, taking a three-hit
shutout into the final inning be
fore an error by center fielder
Catalina Morris led to an un
earned run, Santa Clara's lone
score in the 4-1 Cardinal victory.
Morris had more than compen
sated for her seventh-inning mis
calculation earlier in the game,
however, with a towering two
run homer to right field in the
third inning which staked the
Cardinal to a 3-0 lead that would
be enough to secure the victory.
Friday's action began with a
scare as star shortstop Lauren
Lappin, an All-Pacific-10 Con
ference selection last year as a
true freshman, took a grounder
to the face in pregame warm-ups
and was unable to start the first
game. Instead, freshman Lind

say Key was thrown into her first
career start as Lappin received
medical attention for injuries to
her face and nose.
With the pressure on. Key
lived up to her surname. In the
top of the first inning, with run
ners on second and third and one
out, she smoked a single up the
middle to score both baserun
ners and give the Cardinal its
first lead of the tournament. The
team never looked back, blank
ing Santa Clara, 5-0, and then de
feating a very good Missouri
pitcher in Friday's nightcap, 3-2,
to set up Saturday morning's
showcase matchup with then-un
defeated Pacific.
Pacific drew first blood, scor
ing a run in the top of the first in
ning against Cardinal pitcher
Laura Severson. However, Stan
ford got this run and two more
back in the bottom of the first.
keyed by a sacrifice by Lappin,
who played in all five games de
spite her facial injury. The Cardi
nal maintained the 3-1 lead until
the top of the final inning, when
Pacific was finally able to manufac
ture a run against freshman reliev
er Danika Dukes, who had pitched
4 2/3 innings of scoreless relief of
Severson. With a Pacific baserun
ner on third and the Cardinal hold
ing a tenuous 3-2 lead with two outs
in the bottom of the seventh, Stan
ford head coach John Rittman
called on his ace starter, Sorensen,
to close out the game. Sorensen,
nicknamed "Lightning D" for her
powerful repertoire of pitches,
struck out the last Pacific batter
swinging to nail down another Car
dinal victory.
Soon after closing out the
Pacific nail-biter, Sorensen
stepped into the circle again on
Saturday afternoon to start
against Missouri. This time.
Lightning struck twice in the
same game as Sorensen pitched
six shutout innings before giv
ing way to Dukes, then came
back to close out her own game
after Dukes quickly allowed
two Pacific runs in the final in
ning. As impressive as
Sorensen's pitching was, Satur
day's second game belonged to
senior catcher Jessica Allister,
who slammed two monstrous

home runs to lead the Cardinal
onslaught in their 5-2 victory.
This second win over Missouri
set up the Card's 4-1 champi
onship game victory against

Santa Clara on Sunday.
With five wins this weekend,
Stanford has reeled off seven
straight to make a statement to the
rest of the Pac-10. The Cardinal

will try to send another message
this Friday and Saturday at the
