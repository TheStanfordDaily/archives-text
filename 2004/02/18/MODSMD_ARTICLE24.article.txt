# Women's tennis weathers UNLV in sweep
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (7-0) swept
No. 38 UNLV (3-1), 7-0, at Taube
Family Tennis Stadium on Fri
day, tainting the Rebels' previ
ously spotless record. The weath
er conditions were less than ideal
— there were a number of rain
delays — but the teams were able
to complete the match.
The same can't be said of yes
terday's scheduled match against
No. 21 Fresno State, which was
postponed due to rain. That
match has been rescheduled for
Wednesday, March 3.
All but one of Friday's singles
matches ended in straight-set vic
tories for the Cardinal. Senior
Lauren Barnikow (15-4), ranked
20th nationally and playing in the
fourth position, dropped the first
set to Cindy Treber, 4-6, but
fought back with a 6-2 win in the
second set and a swift 1-0 (3)
match-clincher.
According to Barnikow, the
poor weather conditions may
have been the stiffest challenge
facing the Cardinal on Friday.
"It was really windy and cold,"
she said. "After we finished our
doubles [matches], we weren't
sure if we could play the singles
matches with rain delays off and
on."
Doubles play went off without
a hitch. The team of Barnikow
and junior Erin Burdette won the
first match of the day, 8-2, over
UNLV's Agniezska Abram and
Anne Ortiz-Luis.
Barnikow and Burdette, now

13-1 together, have not lost a
match since October, when
Duke's team of Amanda
Johnson and Tory Zawacki,
ranked fifth in the nation,
pulled out a round of 16 win
at the Riviera / ITA
Women's All-American
Championship.
Sophomores Amber
Liu and Alice Barnes also
posted an 8-2 victory, and
Emilia Anderson and the
Anne Yelsey completed
the doubles sweep with an
8-4 triumph.
Liu defeated UNLV's Gy
orgyi Zsiros, 6-1, 6-3, in the
first singles match of the day.
Barnes and Burdette easily
won their matches as well to
complete the Cardinal
sweep.
Fueled by their win last
week at National Team In
doors in Madison, Wise.,
Stanford has gained pow
erful momentum early in
the season.
"Right now, we're where
our coaches would like us to
be," Barnikow said.
But with 23 matches left
in the season, the Cardinal
is well aware of upcoming
challenges.
"We've had some easi
er matches [so far],"
Barnikow said. "We
haven't started our Pacif
ic-10 Conference dual
matches, which are going
to be really tough this
year."

The Pac-10 season will not he
easy: all of the conference's teams

are currently ranked in the top 50
nationwide.
Stanford's first official Pac-10

match comes next Tuesday
against undefeated No. 42 Ore
gon (8-0).
