# Cal swims by Cardinal women
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
The No. 3 Stanford women's
swimming team (5-2, 3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) fell to No. 5 Cal
ifornia (9-0, 6-0), 151-149, in a
dramatic short-course meters
dual meet at the Avery Aquatic
Center on Saturday in the regu
lar season finale for both teams.
It was only the third time that
Cal has beaten Stanford in
women's swimming—and the
first since the 1975-76 season.
The Cardinal took a seven
point lead into the final event, the
400-meter relay, but the Golden
Bears took first and third to edge
Stanford in the overall score.
"We were hoping we could
score a few more points in the in
dividual medleys because we knew
it was going to be a chore with the
freestyle race at the end," Stan
ford head coach Richard Quick
said. "California did a great job,
especially in the last two events."
The school-record 1,784 fans
got their money's worth, even if
they weren't completely satisfied
by the Cardinal loss.
Both Stanford senior Tara Kirk
and Cal's Natalie Coughlin almost
broke American records. Kirk
won the 100 breast in a career-best
1:05.77 — .03 seconds off former
Georgia swimmer Kristy Kowal's
record of 1:05.74. It was Kirk's
33rd consecutive victory in the
event, in which she has never lost
at the collegiate level.
Coughlin won the 100 free in
24.60 seconds — .08 seconds off of
former Stanford swimmer Jenny
Thompson's national record.
Kirk also captured first place
in the 200 breast, an event she
has not lost since the 2002 Pac

10 Championships, clocking in
at 2:28.50.
Coughlin picked up three indi
vidual wins on the day. In addition
to her 100 free victory, she won the
100 fly in 56.64, 3 / 10 of a second
short of her own record of 56.34,
and the 100 free in 54.84 seconds.
She was also a part of the first
place 400-meter relay team.
Sophomore Dana Kirk —
Tara's sister — won the 200 fly in
2:06.80, and Lacey Boutwell won
the 200 free with a mark of 1:58.36.
Both times were career bests.
The Cardinal also won the 200
medley relay in a season-best
1:52.38. The team consisted of
Megan Baumgartner, Tara Kirk,
Ashley Daly and Sarah Jones.
Cal won nine of the 14 swim
ming events, but Stanford domi
nated the diving section of the
competition, sweeping the top
three spots in both the 1-meter and
3-meter events. The Cardinal
outscored the Golden Bears, 32-6,
in those two events, but it wasn't
enough to put Stanford over the
top in the overall points race.
Stanford's Ashlee Rosenthal
took the 1-meter event with a
score of 300.21 and Cassidy
Krug won the 3-meter with
283.80 points. Both scores were
personal bests.
Stanford holds a 28-3 all-time
advantage over Cal in the dual
meet series. Before Saturday's
loss, the Cardinal had won nine of
its last ten dual meets.
The team will next compete
at the Pac-10 Women's Swim
ming and Diving Champi
onships on Feb. 26-28. The
swimming competition will be
held in Long Beach, and the
diving portion will take place
in Federal Way, Wash.
