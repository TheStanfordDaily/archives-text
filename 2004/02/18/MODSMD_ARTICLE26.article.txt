son so far has been all about rebuilding. The number of players training
with and competing for the club has been decreasing, and many have
played through injuries to ensure a full side could be put out. It hasn't
quite come right on the field for the full 80 minutes yet, though, with only
the B team having scored a win (against Nevada-Reno). In the latest
games, both sides lost against Sacramento State, in efforts that showed
both the strengths and weaknesses of the team this year.
Upcoming games include an away match at St. Mary's on Feb. 21 and
then home games on Feb. 28 (Chico State) and March 6 (California), fol
lowed by a spring break tour in Wales.
Women's Rugby (6-1)
The women are currently in search of a national title. The season start
ed off a little slowly, but now they are firing on all cylinders and picked
up two wins (55-3 for the A team and 20-0 for the B team) in their latest
games against Humbolt State. Now the women face the task of continu

ing to improve week by week so that they reach their peak for the play
offs in April.
Their next game is on Feb. 21 (Berkeley All-Blues) at Treasure Is
land, Calif., which will be followed by two home matches: Feb. 28 (Chico
State), then the Big Game at home against Cal on March 6.
Skiing
The season is almost over for the Stanford Ski Team. Their last race
was at Sugar Bowl, where the team competed against Cal, UC-Davis,
Sierra College and Southern Oregon University. Sophomore Alice War
necke came in first in the women's slalom.
The next fixture is the Regionals at Sugar Bowl (Feb. 21-22), and both
the men's and women's teams hope to qualify for the Nationals, which
will be held at Sugarloaf, Maine.
