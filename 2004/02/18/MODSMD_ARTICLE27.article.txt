### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team (2-0) got off to a strong start at
home last weekend, defeating UC-
Davis on Saturday, 15-4, and edging
St. Mary's, 13-9, on Monday. The
team has now won five consecutive
games dating back to last year.
A battle took place on rain
soaked Maloney Field on Monday
night, as the Gaels battled through
out the first half. The Cardinal held a
slim 8-7 advantage going into the sec
ond half.

"We had a bit of a slow start,"
Stanford head coach Michele
Uhlfelder said. "Playing games
during the season is much differ
ent than playing in tournaments
or practice."
Sophomore attacker Megan
Burker struck first for Stanford,
scoring just 45 seconds into the
contest. The Gaels would rally to
tie the game at four apiece on a
goal by freshman midfielder
Madalyn Marsh, and took a 6-5
lead after Molly Wagner and
Jackie Spencer scored.
Stanford, though, rallied for the

halftime lead and scored the first
three goals of the final period to
gain firm control of the match.
Senior goalkeeper Christina
Saikus came in to play the second
half and held St. Mary's to just a
pair of Collete Spencer goals.
"Christina was really tough in
there," Uhlfelder said. "[She] re
ally changed the momentum of
the game."
Against Davis, Stanford held
just a 3-1 lead going into the break,
but exploded in the second half for
12 goals. Burker and senior mid
fielder Abbi Hills both scored

three times in the second half.
Burker had a game-high four goals
in the victory.
Senior midfielder Kim Cahill
added two goals and a team-high
three assists, while sophomore goal
keeper Katie Horowitz registered
eight saves.
The Aggies struck first on a goal
by senior midfielder Kelly Albin,
who had a team-high two goals for
Davis. The Aggies did not record
an assist.
Stanford plays again Thursday
night, when it takes on rival Califor
nia in Berkeley.
