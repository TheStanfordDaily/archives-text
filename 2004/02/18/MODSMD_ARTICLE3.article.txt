# ASSU brainstorms, pitches solutions for special fee crunch
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night passed four bills de
signed to alleviate the shortage of
money created by this year's record
number of special-fees refund re
quests. The bills, drafted by the ad
hoc Review of Special Fees Commit
tee, addressed both the short-term
funds crisis and the long-term finan
cial stability of Stanford's student
groups, which rely on special fees to
subsidize their programs.
Pending approval by the Gradu
ate Student Council at its meeting
tonight, the bills will go into effect
immediately.
To solve this year's approaching
shortage, the legislation will use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover actual
special-fees refunds for up to 16 per
cent of groups' quarterly operating
budgets. After that point, the ASSU
will take the money from groups' re
serve accounts, but the buffer fund
will cover refund-incurred charges
once groups' reserves are exhausted.
At the end of the fiscal year, money
left in groups' operating budgets will
go back into the buffer fund in the
amount of any outstanding refund
charge above 16 percent.
The ASSU will also bolster its
buffer fund by liquidating the reserves
of six groups that have been inactive
for at least two years.
Some of the student groups at the
meeting voiced concerns that if the
special-fees program was to crash,
they would be left without the extra
security that the reserve accounts
provide.
"It's not fair, but it's the best
course of action," said Senate Chair
Josh Shipp, a junior. "We urge
groups to continue to be prudent in
their budgeting."
He emphasized that the first bill ad

dressing the immediate crisis was only
a short-term solution.
The other bills in new legislation in
cluded provisions that the senators
said will hopefully ensure the long
term viability of special fees, including
one bill dealing specifically with stu
dent refunds.
Under this bill, students will no
longer receive refunds in the form of a
mailed check. Instead, the money will
be credited toward their University
bill. The senators said this change
should prevent students from viewing
refund money as "free cash."
Students will also be asked to
complete a confidential survey when
they request a refund so that the
ASSU can better understand why re
fund rates have increased so much
recently.
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Kyle Alisharan, Class of
'03, the true purpose of the refunds is
to allow students to express disap
proval of student groups they be
lieve are misusing their budgets or to
express ideological opposition to a
group.
Still, representatives of student
groups at the meeting said that more
should be done to prevent abuse of the
refund system.
Junior Eric Shih, chair of the Asian
American Students Association, ex
pressed concern that the reform bills
may still allow refunds to undermine
the voter-approved purpose of the
special fees.
"I want to believe that students
don't want to hurt student groups, but
1 don't want to bank on that," Shih
said. "That's not good legislation."
Other legislation dealt more di
rectly with the student groups. In fu
ture years, the groups will be re
quired to cover any refund
amounts in excess of a predeter
mined Refund Cost Surcharge set
by the ASSU. In the event of an ex
cess. money will be collected from
reserve accounts, operating bud
gets and.in extreme cases, through
the repossession of other, previ
ously agreed-upon assets.
"If you can't cover the refund, all
money is fair game," Alisharan said.
The Senate is also seeking to re
form the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the spe
cial-fees ballot. Some of the new

provisions will result in closer
scrutiny by the ASSU and added
steps to the application process.
Orges Beqiri, the financial
manager of KZSU, said the appli
cation process was difficult
enough already.
With the addition of the new leg
islation. he said, "It's like jumping
through hoops of fire and landing on
a bed of nails."
The special-fees system was not
the only controversial issue up for
debate at last night's meeting. The
Senate also passed two advocacy
bills.
One of the bills recommended
changes to the non-discrimination
policy currently used by the Career
Development Center (CDC). The

Senate requested that the CDC no
longer make its services available to
employers that practice lawful dis
crimination, such as the U.S. mili
tary, which discriminates based on
sexual orientation.
The other advocacy bill was a
statement of opposition to Califor
nia Senate Bill 193, which could
pose major problems to Pacific-10
athletics programs.
Nonetheless, most of the meet
ing was spent debating the special
fees bills.
"This is not a crisis, but it is a very
serious situation," said ASSU Presi
dent Nadiya Figueroa, a senior.
