# Prof. aims to improve family media
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In what he described as an effort
to bring family values back to the
modern media, James Steyer— a
lecturer in education and at the Cen
ter for Race and Ethnicity and a
Stanford alumnus — has taken the
reins of New York-based Common

Sense Media.
The nonprofit
organization cri
tiques all forms
of media, allow
ing parents to
make informed
choices when se
lecting enter
tainment for
their children.
As chairman
and chief execu-

tive officer, Steyer said he envisions
Common Sense Media to be "a cross
between Consumer Reports and

Amazon.com." The organization's
Web site — http://www.common
sensemedia.org — provides reviews
of movies, music, Web sites, televi
sion programs and video games, rat
ing these forms of entertainment ac
cording to family entertainment
standards. According to Steyer, re
viewers — including professionals,
parents and children — take vio
lence, sexuality and profanity into
account, as well as racial and gender
stereotypes and body image.
"We roll everything up into one
general informational rating, like a
nutritional label on food," Steyer
said, adding that the site's medi
aguide is aimed specifically at par
ents. "We don't tell you what's right
or wrong, we let you decide if it's
right for your kids."
While Common Sense Media em
ployed many professional reviewers,
it also accepts submissions from par
ents, teens and children. Every post
ed critique includes an overall rating

tor the piece reviewed, as well as an
age recommendation. For example,
"Lord of the Rings: Return of the
King," is recommended for viewers
aged 14 and older whereas "Finding
Nemo" is recommended for those
aged six and up.
The nonprofit's long-term goal is
to build a member base strong
enough to lobby for political regula
tions and media legislation. There
are currently 150.000 members, but
Steyer said he hopes to eventually
draw 30 million.
"The traditional approach to cri
tiques of the media has always come
from the Christian right wing, Jerry
Falwell and company," Steyer said.
"I'm a progressive, a well-known
liberal around media issues. The
media always hides behind the fact
that it's always the Christian right
going after them."
Instead of attacking the media,
Steyer said he hopes the nonprofit
will encourage entertainment execu

tives to make parental concerns a
higher priority than profit.
"Reshaping the media environ
ment to make it more sensitive to the
public interest is the first great
movement of the 21st century, com
parable to the environmental move
ment," Steyer said. "This is about
the non-physical environment that
kids and families grow up in today."
Steyer emphasized that challeng
ing America's media leadership is no
easy task and that doing so makes it
necessary to counter the nation's po
litical leadership as well.
"We believe that you can't under
stand American culture or politics
without understanding the media,"
he said. "The public owns the air
waves but they seem to have forgot
ten that over the last 20 years. The
public needs a voice."
Steyer cited the MTV-produced
Super Bowl half-time show — dur


James Steyer
ing which singer Janet Jackson's
breast was exposed — as an example
of why groups like Common Sense
Media are urgently needed today.
"It wasn't about Janet Jackson
or Justin Timberlake ripping off
her pathetic costume," he said.
"It's about corporate media em
pires that profit from this and are
never held accountable or respon
sible for this. It's about time we
called them on that."
Thirty million people under age
18 were reported to have tuned into
the Super Bowl, Steyer said, leaving
many parents powerless when it
came to censoring what their chil
dren viewed.
"The fact that so many kids were
watching is a reflection of the arro
gance and unchecked power of the
media industry," Steyer said, adding
that even Michael Powell, the chair
man of the Federal Communications
Commission, acknowledged that the
half-time show went too far. "Most
people accept this like it's normal
and okay, but it's just not. MTV
thought they could do this because
there are no standards anymore."
Aiming to turn Common Sense
Media into a powerhouse group
similar to the American Association

of Retired Persons or Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. Steyer said
that the issues represented by the
organization are critical to students
at every level.
"I believe there is bias all across
the media landscape, in entertain
ment and the news," he said. "This is
a huge issue for students, and they
shouldn't accept media culture the
way it is without questioning it."
Common Sense Media held its
first annual awards ceremony in Jan
uary, commending entertainment
geared toward families and roasting
movie, music and game releases that
parents should watch out for. The
organizations members cast 18,000
nominations for artists, television
programs, production companies,
movies, albums, games and books.
Big winners included "Finding
Nemo" for best movie, "Joan of Ar
cadia" for best television program
and Avril Lavigne for best musi
cian. Elmo of "Sesame Street" was
honored with a lifetime achieve
ment award and entertainment ex
ecutives who were responsible for
inappropriate children's products
and programs received golden
garbage can awards.
At Stanford, Steyer teaches a
seminar class about civil rights in ed
ucation for the 21st century, as well
as a lecture course about civil rights
and civil liberties. He hopes to focus
on the interaction between race and
public policy in American schools.
