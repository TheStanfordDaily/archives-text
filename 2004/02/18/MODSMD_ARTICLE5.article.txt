# Students receive community day grants
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nineteen student groups have
been selected to receive $1,000
grants each for their participation in
this year's Community Day, which
will take place on April 4.
Since 2002, Community Day
has served as an open house for
Stanford's neighboring communi
ties, and student groups have an
nually been asked to design activi
ties that would be of interest to vis
itors. This year's grant recipients,
ranging from science-oriented or
ganizations to a veteran's health
group, were chosen out of a total of
35 applicants.
The student-group grants have
been offered since the first Commu

nity Day, and they are awarded
through the Office of the President
and Provost to encourage student in
volvement in the day's events.
Though the grants are intended to
cover the expenses of the groups'
proposed activities, any money left
over is considered compensation for
a group's efforts.
"We consider student participa
tion in Community Day to be a great
service to the University," said Ryan
Foley, the Community Day coordi
nator. "We know how hard student
groups work to raise funds for their
own endeavors, so these grants are a
way for us to make their participa
tion a little easier."
Foley, along with Kate Chesley
of the Office of University Com
munications, made all of the selec

tion decisions.
"The groups we selected all pro
posed programs that had broad ap
peal to our visitors," Foley said.
"Many families attend Community
Day, so groups that plan activities
for kids have been very successful in
the past two years. I also wanted to
select groups with a variety of inter
ests and missions — service groups,
arts groups, science groups, cultural
groups, etc."
Junior Sarah Schulman, an officer
in Stanford in Government (SIG),
which received a grant, said that the
group's proposed activities will tar
get both children and adults.
"We are designing an interactive
board game about Congress and the
presidency and will have coloring
books outlining how a bill becomes a

law," Schulman said. "We will also
provide parents with literature on
voting and on names of their Con
gressional Representatives at the
state and federal levels."
Student groups have always
been a visible part of the Commu
nity Day events and the grants re
flect the University's desire for
their continued presence. Since
2002, the number of grants offered
has nearly doubled.
Director of University Commu
nications Alan Acosta, speaking on
behalf of President John Hennessey,
emphasized the importance of stu
dent participation.
"It is not an overstatement to say
that, without the support of student
groups, Community Day would not
be nearly as successful as it has
been," Acosta said.
This year's grant recipients are:
Artspan, Alpha Kappa Psi, the
Audio Engineering Society, El Bal
let Folklorico de Stanford, the Lati
no '06 Council, the Organization of

Arab-American Students in Stan
ford, Sigma Theta Multicultural
