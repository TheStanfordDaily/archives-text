# This guy next Isaac Asimov?

### SCOOP McSCOOPERSTEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It came as no surprise to family and friends
when junior Anthony Ha lost touch with reality â€”
they just never predicted he'd win an award for it.
Ha, the 2(X)4 recipient of the Isaac Asimov
Award for undergraduate excellence in science
fiction writing, accepted the $500 prize with a tri
umphant smile. In addition to the money, he will
fly to beautiful Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he
hopes to Wend into the vibrant senior citizen
scene, metallic blue nail polish and all.
"I hope to sleep with as many old, white sci
ence fiction writers as possible," Ha said with a
glint in his eye.
The winning story, entitled "Orbiting," first
came to Ha in a fevered dream following one of
the Daily's weekly bacchanals. While the dream
originally featured Jennifer Lopez and Daily Edi
tor in Chief Brendan Marten, they were later omit
ted.
The storyline details the dysfunctional friend
ship between a prisoner and a computer charged
with his execution. According to Ha, the bond be
tween the two is a variation on every romantic re
lationship he has ever had.
"I was broken-hearted over a girl and I called
my friend in tears, asking 'Why does the world
hate me so much?' " Ha said with a sniffle, refus
ing to answer any further questions.
Including a hot solo love scene, Ha's opus suc
cessfully puts the spark back into binary code and
prison sexuality.
In his spare time Ha remains convinced that he
serves as managing editor of news for The Daily
despite being fired over five times.
"He just keeps showing up every day," Marten
said. "But now that he's won this big award, I might
consider firing him less often."

The 5-foot-4-inch Ha celebrated his big win with far
more alcohol than can be safely consumed, yet again prov
ing himself a giant among men.
"I have long considered Anthony to be my dopple
ganger," said Karan Mahajan, a close personal friend and

disciple of Ha. "I know that if I had an evil side of me that
wrote science fiction and won big prizes across the country,
he would be like Anthony."
To sum up his chum's personality, Mahajan said, "An
thony? He's a badass motherfucker."
