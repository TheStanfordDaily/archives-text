A Novel
by Marge Piercy
Monday, February 23, 2004 • 7:OOPM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
ITic renowned novelist and poet Marge Piercy tells a contemporary love story set in
the twin realms of college and national politics. In the politically prominent
Dickinson family, ambition comes first, and Melissa, the third child, has always felt
that she comes last. Going away to college offers her a chance at a life tree from her
brilliant mother's constant scrutiny and her famous father's lack of interest. There
she meets Blake, a man of mixed race and apparently unknown parentage. His adop
tive parents are lawyers whose defense of death- row cases has brought them head
to-head with Melissa's father, the former governor of Pennsylvania who is now a U.S.
senator. Melissa and Blake's attraction is immediate; their affair, fiery. Yet Blake is
keeping a dangerous secret from Melissa, one that could destroy them - and their
families. Dealing with themes of love, honesty, identity, and the consequences of
ambition, this thoughtful, beautifully written story is a remarkable and provocative
page-turner.
