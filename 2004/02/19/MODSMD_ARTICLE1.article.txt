# TOP DOG
## Top-ranked men head to L.A. 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As if the target on the Stanford men's basket
ball team's back wasn't already big enough with
"undefeated" written on it, on Monday after
noon it got a little bit bigger — and a little bit
brighter — when the Cardinal was ranked No. 1
in the nation by both the Associated Press and
USA Today / ESPN polls.
With the addition of the top ranking, the aura
surrounding Stanford (21 -0,12-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) grows somewhat — not to the point of
invincibility, but to the extent that a win over a
No. 1 is a big deal for almost any team.
And both USC (10-12, 5-8) and UCLA (10-
11, 6-7) are licking their chops as they get ready
for the opportunity to host the Pac-10 and the
country's top team.
"We're excited to play a No. 1 team," USC
head coach Henry Bibby said. "It's a very big op
portunity for us, for the program to get a win, and
that's what we're working towards.
"We know how tough [Stanford is]," he
continued. "We have to come out and play
flawless basketball."
How Stanford will respond to heightened en
ergy levels remains to be seen.
Stanford's first encounter with USC, when it
battled back from a six-point halftime deficit on
Jan. 24, was the first sign that things weren't
going to be quite so easy for the Cardinal in con
ference play. (Up until that point, Stanford had
only trailed at halftime"once before. Since, it has
found itself behind at the half against Oregon,
Arizona and California.)
If anything, Stanford's first game against USC
showed that Arizona wasn't the only team with
the potential to cause the Cardinal problems.
And, moreover, the Trojans illustrated that no
team was going to bow down to Stanford — no,
not this year.
Everyone wants to beat a No. 1, everyone wants
to end the streak and, among other things, USC re
minded everyone that even if you can't beat the
Cardinal, you can still beat up on Stanford.
That's what the Trojans try to do — they try
to simply out-muscle their opponents. They are
athletic and quick, with long-armed bodies per
fect for pressing and wreaking havoc on the de
fensive end (USC leads the conference in steals,
averaging 9.3 per game). Stanford "prepared"
for USC's physical press during Tuesday's prac

tice by playing with six men on defense and call
ing no fouls.
"It's hard to emulate [USC's] quickness in
practice," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They reach for everything. They
get points off turnovers."
Interestingly enough, though the Trojans reside
toward the bottom of the conference standings.
USC's season hasn't been without its highlights —
although there have been plenty of frustrations.
After upsetting Arizona earlier this year, the
Trojans embarked upon a three-game losing
skid before beating UCLA by seven points at
Pauley Pavilion. After that win, USC dropped
another three consecutive games to Washington,
Washington State (both at home) and Arizona
again.
However, a resilient Trojan squad rebounded
to beat Arizona State in overtime two days later.
Senior guard Desmon Farmer leads USC in
scoring with 20.2 points per game (third in the Pac
-10) and remains a huge offensive threat (and excel
lent defender) whenever he steps onto the court.
However, USC is as unpredictable as the two
sets of twin guards that rotate in and out of the
starting lineup — who knows what face will
show up on a given day? How in the world do you
tell the difference? Their performances seem so
arbitrary.
Add to that the fact that the Trojans are still
vying for one of the eight spots in the Pac-10
Tournament (the winner of which gets an auto
matic bid to the NCAA Tournament) and what
you've got is a hungry, dangerous USC team.
In many ways, UCLA is in the same boat as
their L.A. rival — trying desperately to make
something... anything... out of its quickly sink
ing season. After winning their first five confer
ence matches, the Bruins have dropped six of their
last seven Pac-10 games. (Their only win came
against Washington at Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 7.)
"These kids are trying hard," UCLA head
coach Ben Howland said. "We have limitations
just like everyone does.
"We have to get better in executing," he con
tinued. "We have three of the top 12 guys in the
league [in] turning the ball over. That's not what
you want."
Tipoff for tonight's game against USC is set
for 7:30 p.m. Stanford will then travel to Pauley
Pavilion fora Saturday matchup against UCLA
set for 1 p.m.

continued. "We have to come out and play
flawless basketball."
How Stanford will respond to heightened en
ergy levels remains to be seen.
Stanford's first encounter with USC, when it
battled back from a six-point halftime deficit on
Jan. 24, was the first sign that things weren't
going to be quite so easy for the Cardinal in con
ference play. (Up until that point, Stanford had
only trailed at halftime"once before. Since, it has
found itself behind at the half against Oregon,
Arizona and California.)
If anything, Stanford's first game against USC
showed that Arizona wasn't the only team with
the potential to cause the Cardinal problems.
And, moreover, the Trojans illustrated that no
team was going to bow down to Stanford — no,
not this year.
Everyone wants to beat a No. 1, everyone wants
to end the streak and, among other things, USC re
minded everyone that even if you can't beat the
Cardinal, you can still beat up on Stanford.
That's what the Trojans try to do — they try
to simply out-muscle their opponents. They are
athletic and quick, with long-armed bodies per
fect for pressing and wreaking havoc on the de
fensive end (USC leads the conference in steals,
averaging 9.3 per game). Stanford "prepared"
for USC's physical press during Tuesday's prac

tice by playing with six men on defense and call
ing no fouls.
"It's hard to emulate [USC's] quickness in
practice," Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery said. "They reach for everything. They
get points off turnovers."
Interestingly enough, though the Trojans reside
toward the bottom of the conference standings.
USC's season hasn't been without its highlights —
although there have been plenty of frustrations.
After upsetting Arizona earlier this year, the
Trojans embarked upon a three-game losing
skid before beating UCLA by seven points at
Pauley Pavilion. After that win, USC dropped
another three consecutive games to Washington,
Washington State (both at home) and Arizona
again.
However, a resilient Trojan squad rebounded
to beat Arizona State in overtime two days later.
Senior guard Desmon Farmer leads USC in
scoring with 20.2 points per game (third in the Pac
-10) and remains a huge offensive threat (and excel
lent defender) whenever he steps onto the court.
However, USC is as unpredictable as the two
sets of twin guards that rotate in and out of the
starting lineup — who knows what face will
show up on a given day? How in the world do you
tell the difference? Their performances seem so
arbitrary.
Add to that the fact that the Trojans are still
vying for one of the eight spots in the Pac-10
Tournament (the winner of which gets an auto
matic bid to the NCAA Tournament) and what
you've got is a hungry, dangerous USC team.
In many ways, UCLA is in the same boat as
their L.A. rival — trying desperately to make
something... anything... out of its quickly sink
ing season. After winning their first five confer
ence matches, the Bruins have dropped six of their
last seven Pac-10 games. (Their only win came
against Washington at Pauley Pavilion on Feb. 7.)
"These kids are trying hard," UCLA head
coach Ben Howland said. "We have limitations
just like everyone does.
"We have to get better in executing," he con
tinued. "We have three of the top 12 guys in the
league [in] turning the ball over. That's not what
you want."
Tipoff for tonight's game against USC is set
for 7:30 p.m. Stanford will then travel to Pauley
Pavilion fora Saturday matchup against UCLA
set for 1 p.m.

Senior swingman Nick Robinson drives against Cal in No. 1 Stanford's 69-58 victory at Haas Pavilion last Saturday.
The Cardinal puts its school-record 21 -game win streak on the line this weekend when it travels to (JSC and UCLA.
As if the target on the Stanford men's basket
ball team's back wasn't already big enough with
"undefeated" written on it, on Monday after
noon it got a little bit bigger — and a little bit
brighter — when the Cardinal was ranked No. 1
in the nation by both the Associated Press and
USA Today / ESPN polls.
With the addition of the top ranking, the aura
surrounding Stanford (21 -0,12-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) grows somewhat — not to the point of
invincibility, but to the extent that a win over a
No. 1 is a big deal for almost any team.
And both USC (10-12, 5-8) and UCLA (10-
11, 6-7) are licking their chops as they get ready
for the opportunity to host the Pac-10 and the
country's top team.
"We're excited to play a No. 1 team," USC
head coach Henry Bibby said. "It's a very big op
portunity for us, for the program to get a win, and
that's what we're working towards.
"We know how tough [Stanford is]," he
