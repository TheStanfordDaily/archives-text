# New dean jumps right in to job
## 
### 
Interim Dean of Students Chris Griffith took
care of internal administrative issues during her
tenure earlier this year. That work allowed our
new dean of students, Cireg Boardman, to im
mediately take on substantial student affairs projects
that student representatives have identified as top
priorities. We encourage Boardman to take advan
tage of this opportunity.
During his first weeks on campus, Boardman has
taken steps in the right direction. Most notably, he
has reached out to students and his staff to acquire a
better understanding of student needs and concerns.
If Boardman translates this initial outreach into con
sistent collaboration, then he will be better
equipped to tackle Stanford's pressing student is
sues even as the demands of his administrative re
sponsibilities increase.
Two student issues in particular merit Board
man's special attention, given his unique position to
have a lasting impact on the operations of communi
ty centers and student activities.
As spaces that foster both leadership and aca
demic excellence and provide a place for the cultur
al programming that prepares the student body for
success in an increasingly diverse society, communi

ty centers are a focal point of Stanford's student af
fairs. Yet they are severely under-funded and too
often have to rely on other student groups' funds
(through co-sponsorship) when putting on flagship
University programming such as the Stanford Pow
wow. When the community centers organize events
— sueh as El Centro Chicano's Mariachi Benefit
Concert this May — proceeds should be used for
special initiatives, not for basic programming ex
penses. As a leader in the student affairs division, it
behooves the dean of students to support the efforts
of community center staff and the interests of stu
dents at-large by working to advocate for more
funds in this area.
Student activities are also in dire need of support.
Student fees continue to rise, and, accordingly, so do
refund requests. The ASSU's drastic action plan
does not bode well for the success of student pro
gramming and leadership development; students re
quire a stable and centralized source of support from
the University in order to both continue old initia
tives and develop new projects. These programs are
a large part of what makes Stanford unique.
We wish our new dean of students the best of luck
as he takes on these pressing challenges.
