# Withdrawal from ARL is good

### 
Stanford's withdrawal from the Association
of Research Libraries (ARL) seemed to
pass below most students' radar. The deci
sion to leave the ARL was a timely move by
the Stanford University Libraries (SUL). This dis
engagement by library administrators came after
a lengthy assessment that resulted in the conclu
sion that the ARL. although co-founded by Stan
ford, simply did not serve any concrete purpose.
Ostensibly, the association provided a forum for
peer institution libraries to exchange ideas about
long-term planning and offered workshops and
symposiums for librarians to meet and discuss var
ious issues. These purposes were vague and im
precise; we commend the University librarian and
other top officials for recognizing the futility of
Stanford's continued participation in the ARL.
Our librarians can now focus their attentions on
other, more tangible issues and over $20,000 in as
sociation dues will be saved annually.
Another reason why Stanford can afford to de
tach itself from the ARL is because our librarians
maintain fruitful relations with more practical
groups such as the Digital Liberty Federation,
which addresses the pertinent issue of the in-

Most importantly, SUL's relationship with the
ARL reaped no benefits for the average student.
We agree with University Librarian Michael
Keller's assertion that students will not be affect
ed by Stanford's disassociation from the ARL..
While we applaud the decision to leave the
ARL. we cannot help but question why this deci
sion did not come earlier. As Associate Library
Director Andrew Herkovic told The Daily's edi
torial board, " These times of diminished budgets
demand cost-benefit analysis." Had the SUL eval
uated all of its external relations years ago, it
would have realized much sooner that several of
its associations were superfluous.
Ultimately, we still commend the SUL for pub
licly showing its desire to attentively analyze all of
its present costs — in these years of increasing tu
itions and enormous budgets, small but symbolic
gestures like the withdrawal from the ARL helps
to set a precedent for smart and effective cost-cut
ting. The SUL has been held in high esteem by the
Stanford community — now other departments
with escalating costs should look to emulate the
SUL's financially prudent ways.
