# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Monsoon season on the Farm 
### 
Some of the other columnists
seem to be writing introduc
tions this week, so I was
thinking about just following
suit with the regular name (can't
you read . . . it's printed to the
right), major (American studies and
communication) and hometown
(Brooklyn, NY) bit, but this isn't the
first IHIJM section of the year or a
Stanford dating service, so you real
ly shouldn't care about all of that.
But in case you really do want to
know . . . I'm a junior, a Virgo
(though I don't believe in signs) and
I have no interest in long walks on
the beach — or anywhere for that
matter. When it comes down to it,
I'm just like everyone else here at
Stanford, or so I like to think. I wear
flip-flops all year round, roll
through stop signs on my bike and I
have yet to finish an entire reading
assignment the night before it's due.
I frequent the CoHo, Moonbeans,
Jamba Juice and the post office to
satisfy my daily desire to stand in
long lines, and like everybody else
on campus, I love rainy season here
at Stanford.
Just today I noticed a girl riding
her pink cruiser singing at the top of
her lungs about the rain — clearly
she was blinded by ecstasy as she
nearly ran me over. Yes, the rain is
truly a spectacular thing — and I
am not saying this just because I
bought a new pair of rain boots last
week in hopes of a few more soak
ing wet days to justify my purchase.
Rainy days are still the best excuse

for turning off the alarm clock, ig
noring that strange urge to go to lec
ture and sleeping until noon. Surely

Jane and Leland
Stanford didn't
intend for the
University to
fully function
during winter
quarter, since
students should
never have to be
burdened with
having to bike up
and down hills, to
and from class in

(he rain. Simply, a rainy day in the
Bay Area warrants the same re
spect as a snowy day in New Eng
land — give us a holiday — even if
it becomes a weekly occurrence.
If this were the case, we would all
be looking at an entire week off from
school right now, as the forecast
promised a solid block of showers
for at least the next five days. If
C'NNs online weather for Palo Alto
can be trusted, it rained yesterday,
will rain tomorrow and is probably
raining right now. Instead of facing
wet bike seats and damp notebook
pages, we could all be at home play
ing Scrabble or watching reruns of
"The 0.C." on FX. But since we all
love the rain here at Stanford, it is
just fine that we are required to carry
on as usual even as rain seems to be
coming from the ground up at times.
In my own rebellion against the
weather, I have decided to follow a
whole new set of rules on rainy days.

Being on time for class is never im
portant if the sun isn't shining (I
question how important it is even
then), make-up is never allowed for
fear of looking like the Bride of
Frankenstein once it begins to run
and going to the gym counts as an
"unnecessary outing" and is there
fore strictly forbidden. On week
ends, frat parties are off limits since
5-SURE offers no protection from
the rain and watching movies be
comes the order of the day since
without sunlight, reading by dorm
light can prove to be dangerous. Be
sides, why bother even doing home
work when class itself becomes op
tional once it is raining outside?
See. I truly love the rain because
it gives me an opportunity to dismiss
the real world and call all of the
shots. When it's raining, I no longer
need to find an excuse for my New
York attitude, frequent tardiness or
addiction to teen drama series —
and of course, like I said before,
there's the opportunity for me to
wear my new rain boots. The truth is
that it's going to rain whether we
like it or not, so why not just make
something of it?
