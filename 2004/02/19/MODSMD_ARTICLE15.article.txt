# BEN IN BUSINESS
## Welcome to my world of Filler 
### 
There's a certain feeling ev
eryone encounters at least
once in their life, when
they have managed to trick
someone into giving them a respon
sibility they are entirely unqualified
for. It's a "Yeah, Michael, my kids
would love to spend the weekend
with the King of Pop"-type experi
ence — inexplicable as to how
someone would allow you to be in
that situation, and yet strangely tit
illating (Michael Jackson refer
ences hopefully notwithstanding).
Well, unless you, dear reader, are
the creepy guy with the telescope
across the street, I seem to be find
ing myself in that situation (if you
are reading this from over there.
Hey! I'll try to wear pants around
the room more, but no promises).
I'm going to confess up-front,
I've never written a column before
(although those bastards at Cat
Fancy won't stop sending me job
applications), so all I can tell you is
this — If you end up liking my stuff,
you are automatically (and this is
completely official) one of the most
discerning, sophisticated and well
adjusted people on the Farm. If you
end up despising both the column
and me in particular, congratula
tions — you just joined the largest
club on campus. Either way. howev
er, I should ostensibly end up with a
thumbnail in the paper, and isn't
that what really matters?
Well, I'm only two paragraphs
into my journalistic career, and al
ready I've faced an unforeseen dis
aster — I someday might need to
actually write about something.
This is a little detail that is com

pletely concealed from the general
newspaper-reading public, but that
sneaks ever-so-surreptitiously upon
you once you join the vaunted jour
nalistic "in-crowd" (and when I use
the word "journalistic," it is with the
complete understanding that I am
less likely to produce anything of
real news value than the Calabasas
High School journalism class after
an interview with Pete Rose).
Nonetheless, drawing on the inex
orable spirit of the stalwart young
lad I pretend to be around other
people's parents, I promise there
will be a day when I overcome this
obstacle and write something con
taining at least the smallest mod
icum of substance (and an even
more solemn pledge, that substance
will never, ever, not in ten million
years, involve the slightest mention
of game theory. There are very few
things in life I take seriously, but
without a doubt, this pledge is at the
very top of the list.) Until that day
comes, I'm going to introduce you
to my new best friend. Filler.
How it works is this: Some peo
ple are born with the stars in perfect
alignment, granting them the gift to
be profound and witty and general
ly life-changing to those around
them. (I am here referring, of
course, to Starr Jones — damn,
she's sassy.) These people have no
trouble coming up with brilliant
idea after brilliant idea; the least of
their problems is filling up a weekly
column. I am, unfortunately, not a
member of this camp.
The rest of us poor mortals are
lucky beyond our wildest dreams if
we can come up with one idea a

week. That's where Filler makes his
appearance. The general concept
goes something like this: An unsus
pecting Stanford student, just out
of a doubtlessly exhilarating
I HUM section discussion about the
stylistic use of the word "the"in
early Sumerian poetry, reads my
column in a vain search for some
distraction. Still foggy from listen
ing to that pretentious nimrod who
argued that "the vagaries of article
referent relations in Pre-Sumerian
free verse were all too present," our
student is vaguely struck by some
semi-coherent idea contained with
in the column, followed by 500
more words of pure Filler. Next
week, she sits down, and again sees
my name above a column. Howev
er, despite having read my writings
only seven days before, she is un
able to remember anything distinc
tive at all; this is both surprising and
puzzling, so, out of curiosity, she
dives once more into my obtuse
universe, and the trap has been
sprung. Once again, Filler has
claimed another innocent victim.
Well, that about wraps it up for
this week's installment. All 1 ask now
is that you stop thinking about what
you've read immediately. I've only
got seven days for you to forget this
drivel and try again. See you then.

Ben Daniel is a sophomore who did
not take the Ancient Empires I HUM,
last year, but he knows that his editor
did, so he modeled the obnoxious
I/lUM kid in his column after her. If
you can't wait another seven days for
more "Filler," e-mail Ben at bm
daniel@stanford. edu.
