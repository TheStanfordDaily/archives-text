V-Week, "rape tape" continue
to spark community debate
1 am writing in response to the criticisms of
the Vagina Monologue leaders that appeared
both in The Daily's editorial ("V-Week
should ditch the rape tape," Feb. 17) and the
letter submitted by David Nevers ("V-Day
coordinators exhibit sexism," Feb. 17).
I am disappointed, but not surprised, to
see such venom produced when a group of
women asserts women's right to live and
study on a campus free of sexual harassment
and sexual assault. In terms of David Nev
ers' comment about the "University lacking
the moral fortitude to speak out against such
blatant male-bashing," why is it that being
"anti-rape" is equated with being "anti
male?" I attended the Fridaynight perfor
mance of "The Vagina Monologues" and
saw plenty of male students who didn't ap
pear to be threatened by play's anti-violence
message. "The Vagina Monologues" does
not pit men against women.

In addition to the male-bashing concerns, I
found The Daily's comments about the anti
rape tape disconcerting on several levels. First
of all, labeling the efforts of an anti-violence
campaign as "cheeky symbolism" truly mini
mizes the issue at hand as something unim
portant and not worthy of outspoken opposi
tion. Second, The Daily's suggestion that the
V-Day leaders abandon the more outward
signs of their dissent against sexual violence in
favor of some quiet educational programs
smacks of suppression of women's voices.
Finally, it should be acknowledged that
this group of V-Week coordinators is one of
the most inspired, hard-working and dedi
cated groups of students on this campus.
They are part of a national movement that
has contributed over 20 million dollars to
grassroots efforts to end violence against
women and girls everywhere. They have
sold tickets in White Plaza in the rain, prac
ticed their monologues in the Women's
Community Center at all hours of the day
and night and produced fantastic education

al programming that has served the Stan
ford community well.

In her letter "Rape tape should be re
spected as a symbol" (Feb. 18), Erica
Williams fails to understand the reasons that
fraternity members (not "frat guys," as she
terms us) object to having their residences
cordoned off by "Rape Free Zone" tape as
if their residence were some kind of crime
scene. Williams suggests that by this objec
tion to one action, fraternity members op
pose the whole movement against violence
toward women.
Though Williams may not find "rape
tape" offensive, others do, and suggesting
that the offense is somehow a stance against
her cause will not foster the cooperation and
understanding which she seeks.
Williams seems to find no reason why any

one would take offense to the phrase "anyone
is a potential rapist," but how does she feel
when I say "anyone is a potential prostitute?"
As long as we're misunderstanding what
others find offensive, here's something I
have a hard time comprehendingâ€” Why
do some people take offense to women
being seen as "pieces of meat," while they
celebrate plays in which the vagina is per
sonified as the woman and then spend all
week repeating the word "vagina" over and
over like it will help fix the problem? With
me, the more I holler "penis, penis, penis,"
the more I just start to look like a dick. I
guess that's part of what makes us all differ
ent, and I respect that.

Same-sex marriages in San Francisco
violate state's constitution
Thousands of same-sex couples have

rushed to the altar as a result of Mayor
Gavin Newsom's order that San Francisco
accept same-sex couples as legal marriages.
Opinions have and will continue to rage on
this issue. This letter, however, will explore
none of these opinions.
The fact of the matter is that on May 7.
2000, California voters were presented with
Proposition 22, which stated, "Only mar
riage between a man and a woman is valid or
recognized in California." This statutory
amendment was passed by California voters
by a 23-point margin.
Whether or not 1 agree with same-sex
marriage, it is wrong for Newsom to subvert
voter intent and challenge the state constitu
tion, especially an amendment overwhelm
ingly passed by voters. What is the point of
voting if one man can subvert a majority? I
encourage Newsom to seek alternate means
to his desires.
