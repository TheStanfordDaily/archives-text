## Wide world of sports hardly big enough for boys of World Cup skiing 
### 
The guy's dead. That's the first thing that
ran through my mind in 1998 as I
watched Austrian skier Herman Maier
cartwheel 100 feet off a pitch at 70 mph
and land on his neck after smashing through two
anchored safety nets.
It was a crash big enough to cause a pro athlete
to decide there were more important things to do
and more important sights to see. Yet three days
and one gold medal later, Maier was celebrating at
the finish line of the men's super giant slalom. Two
days and another gold medal after that, Maier had
won the giant slalom and walked away from the
Nagano Olympics as the most dangerous skier in
the world.

Now, if World Cup skiing
doesn't yet have a slogan like the
NBA \s "I love this game" or the
WNBA's "We got hoops," 1
have a proposal: "Because we
just don't fit in anywhere else."
Sure, there are the tangibles of
the sport: head-to-head competi
tion. mind games and cross-train
ing. Hut skiing's intangibles are
what catch the eye. We've got
people careening down glazed

slopes hosed down with cold water and salted before
the race and held into4G turns by four skinny, metal
edges beneath their feet. We're not talking 500-
horsepower dragsters and safety harnesses and seat
belts. No. The whole vehicle — the engine, the
brakes, the shocks, the steering wheel and the accel
erator — is a pair of legs. The whole protective sys
tem: a half-inch thick helmet and millimeter-thick
safety net. That's like playing football in duct tape
pads with Tupperware fora helmet and facemask.
We've got the same guys winning world cup
slaloms, giant slaloms, super giant slaloms and
downhills. That's like asking Frank Thomas to hit
45 homeruns, drag bunt for 45 hits and come in to
close out the game in the ninth. Bill Belichick isn't
asking Tom Brady to play quarterback, punter and
special teams .. . Yet these world cup racers domi
nate mountains around the world in four separate
disciplines.
We've got the David and Goliath drama supple
ments and big money contracts have all but driven
David away in the rest of sport. The mighty Austri
ans and the crazy Americans. American Daron
Rahlves — barely pushing 5-foot-7 and 165 pounds
battling head-to-head with and beating an Aus
trian team averaging 215 pounds. We've got a Bode
Miller skidding out onto his hip in courses, losing
poles in the world championships and self-advertis
ing "for rent" — written with a black Sharpie mark
er — on his helmet where other skiers have Oakley
and Deutsche Bank sponsorships, all in races he's
won.
And we've got serious parties. Not "llip-your
car-and-torch-it-the-Pistons-have-won-the-cham-
pionship" events, not "hit-the-strip-club-with-the
boys-after-a-24-point-loss-in-Detroit," but rather
a "grab a stein of dark ale, hold it high and swing
your free arm to the tavern band on center stage"
kind of party. Parties where the shirtless bartender
filling your mug is the racer who won a few hours
earlier and the tab you're mooching off is his, too.
We're talking about racers autographing snow
bunnies' jumblies in "Happy Gilmore" fashion,
we're talking about the whole city of Kitzbuhl there
to kick it root down despite the Tahoe-native
Rahlves claiming victory and upsetting Austrian
hopes. We're talking a love for all things pure in
sports athletes and fans: adrenaline, passion, admi
ration, competition, fire and joy. We're talking at
mosphere.
We're talking athletes so far out of our league
we don't even dream to be like them. We've all
been Michael Jordan and hit the championship
clinching shot in Game 6 of the 1998 finals on our
driveway hoops 50 times. But name a kid who
grows up dreaming to soar 200 feet off of jumps
and put his knees through fighter-pilot turns in a
pair of tights. Name a kid who dreams of descend
ing a vertical mile down a double-black-diamond
trail in 60 seconds. Name a kid who wants to ski 30
mph through a slalom course where the gates are
only seen after they catch you in the chin. We don't
even dare to tear down congested intermediate
slopes named "Sunday Driver" at above average
speed for fear of the ski patrol's ticket clippers.
The intangibles of skiing.
We're talking about the things that these racers
do that render them unsuited for any life but the
rollercoaster ride that is the World Cup. Are we
ever going to see Herman Maier putting together a
jigsaw puzzle on a stormy day? I don 't think so. Not
even after the crash he took in the summer of 2001
on his motorcycle, when he so severely fractured
his tibia in three places he nearly lost his leg. A
crash that doctors said should have killed him from
blood loss, a crash that at the least would cause
even most World Cup downhillers to reevaluate
their life priorities. But two-and-a-half weeks,
three surgeries and a titanium rod later, Maier was
rehabbing on the stairstepper, and at the opening
Super Gin 2002-2(K)3 he took home some first
place hardware. What was he going to do, work at
Starbucks?
Two weeks ago in Germany. Maier reclaimed
the World Cup overall super G title for the first time
in three years, skiing on a right foot still numb from
the surgery of two years ago — a miracle to say the
least. But what else should we expect from these
guys? It's amazing they reach the finish line in one
piece to begin with. And in a world of million-dollar
idol athletes who are bigger, stronger, faster, have
less heart and party in glamour and style, these mir
acle men on the World Cup are the oddbod studs
who will never be able to leave the spirited lives they
lead because the world no longer holds a place for
them but in the sport of ski racing.

It was a crash big enough to cause a pro athlete
to decide there were more important things to do
and more important sights to see. Yet three days
and one gold medal later, Maier was celebrating at
the finish line of the men's super giant slalom. Two
days and another gold medal after that, Maier had
won the giant slalom and walked away from the
Nagano Olympics as the most dangerous skier in
the world.

Now, if World Cup skiing
doesn't yet have a slogan like the
NBA \s "I love this game" or the
WNBA's "We got hoops," 1
have a proposal: "Because we
just don't fit in anywhere else."
Sure, there are the tangibles of
the sport: head-to-head competi
tion. mind games and cross-train
ing. Hut skiing's intangibles are
what catch the eye. We've got
people careening down glazed

slopes hosed down with cold water and salted before
the race and held into4G turns by four skinny, metal
edges beneath their feet. We're not talking 500-
horsepower dragsters and safety harnesses and seat
belts. No. The whole vehicle — the engine, the
brakes, the shocks, the steering wheel and the accel
erator — is a pair of legs. The whole protective sys
tem: a half-inch thick helmet and millimeter-thick
safety net. That's like playing football in duct tape
pads with Tupperware fora helmet and facemask.
We've got the same guys winning world cup
slaloms, giant slaloms, super giant slaloms and
downhills. That's like asking Frank Thomas to hit
45 homeruns, drag bunt for 45 hits and come in to
close out the game in the ninth. Bill Belichick isn't
asking Tom Brady to play quarterback, punter and
special teams .. . Yet these world cup racers domi
nate mountains around the world in four separate
disciplines.
We've got the David and Goliath drama supple
ments and big money contracts have all but driven
David away in the rest of sport. The mighty Austri
ans and the crazy Americans. American Daron
Rahlves — barely pushing 5-foot-7 and 165 pounds
battling head-to-head with and beating an Aus
trian team averaging 215 pounds. We've got a Bode
Miller skidding out onto his hip in courses, losing
poles in the world championships and self-advertis
ing "for rent" — written with a black Sharpie mark
er — on his helmet where other skiers have Oakley
and Deutsche Bank sponsorships, all in races he's
won.
And we've got serious parties. Not "llip-your
car-and-torch-it-the-Pistons-have-won-the-cham-
pionship" events, not "hit-the-strip-club-with-the
boys-after-a-24-point-loss-in-Detroit," but rather
a "grab a stein of dark ale, hold it high and swing
your free arm to the tavern band on center stage"
kind of party. Parties where the shirtless bartender
filling your mug is the racer who won a few hours
earlier and the tab you're mooching off is his, too.
We're talking about racers autographing snow
bunnies' jumblies in "Happy Gilmore" fashion,
we're talking about the whole city of Kitzbuhl there
to kick it root down despite the Tahoe-native
Rahlves claiming victory and upsetting Austrian
hopes. We're talking a love for all things pure in
sports athletes and fans: adrenaline, passion, admi
ration, competition, fire and joy. We're talking at
mosphere.
We're talking athletes so far out of our league
we don't even dream to be like them. We've all
been Michael Jordan and hit the championship
clinching shot in Game 6 of the 1998 finals on our
driveway hoops 50 times. But name a kid who
grows up dreaming to soar 200 feet off of jumps
and put his knees through fighter-pilot turns in a
pair of tights. Name a kid who dreams of descend
ing a vertical mile down a double-black-diamond
trail in 60 seconds. Name a kid who wants to ski 30
mph through a slalom course where the gates are
only seen after they catch you in the chin. We don't
even dare to tear down congested intermediate
slopes named "Sunday Driver" at above average
speed for fear of the ski patrol's ticket clippers.
The intangibles of skiing.
We're talking about the things that these racers
do that render them unsuited for any life but the
rollercoaster ride that is the World Cup. Are we
ever going to see Herman Maier putting together a
jigsaw puzzle on a stormy day? I don 't think so. Not
even after the crash he took in the summer of 2001
on his motorcycle, when he so severely fractured
his tibia in three places he nearly lost his leg. A
crash that doctors said should have killed him from
blood loss, a crash that at the least would cause
even most World Cup downhillers to reevaluate
their life priorities. But two-and-a-half weeks,
three surgeries and a titanium rod later, Maier was
rehabbing on the stairstepper, and at the opening
Super Gin 2002-2(K)3 he took home some first
place hardware. What was he going to do, work at
Starbucks?
Two weeks ago in Germany. Maier reclaimed
the World Cup overall super G title for the first time
in three years, skiing on a right foot still numb from
the surgery of two years ago — a miracle to say the
least. But what else should we expect from these
guys? It's amazing they reach the finish line in one
piece to begin with. And in a world of million-dollar
idol athletes who are bigger, stronger, faster, have
less heart and party in glamour and style, these mir
acle men on the World Cup are the oddbod studs
who will never be able to leave the spirited lives they
lead because the world no longer holds a place for
them but in the sport of ski racing.

The guy's dead. That's the first thing that
ran through my mind in 1998 as I
watched Austrian skier Herman Maier
cartwheel 100 feet off a pitch at 70 mph
and land on his neck after smashing through two
anchored safety nets.

to decide there were more important things to do
