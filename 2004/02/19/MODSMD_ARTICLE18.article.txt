# No. 2 Card hosts Cal for Big Swim
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Forget Athens. Featuring national champions from the Unit
ed States, Canada, Austria, the Philippines, Malaysia, Yugoslavia
and Croatia, this Saturday's dual meet between the Stanford and
Cal men's swim teams is the closest that most local swim fans will
get to watching the Olympics this summer in Greece. Throw in a
world record holder, numerous NCAA champions, the No. 2 and
No. 4 teams in the country and one of the fiercest rivalries in all
of swimming, and you have a real dual meet.
Saturday's meet, which starts at 1 p.m. at Avery Aquatics Cen
ter, marks the last Pacific-10 Conference dual meet for both
teams. Stanford (6-0, 3-0) carries good momentum into this
weekend after trouncing the University of Southern California
two weekends ago. Cal (5-0,3-0) rolls in with its own thrashing of
use.
With their undefeated seasons on the line, both teams are even
ly matched. Stanford has history on its side (92-13 all-time against
Cal). but the Bears bring a strong lineup to the table. Led by Euro
pean and NCAA champion Duje Draganja and world record hold
er Michael Cavic, the Bears are looking to shove the Cardinal
around in the sprint events. However, the Cardinal sprinters will be
ready and waiting, and the Bears will have to do more than win the
sprint events to win the meet.
Outside of the sprints, with multiple Ail-Americans in nearly
every event, the Cardinal's depth is unmatched. Seniors Peter
Marshall, and Markus Rogan and junior Jayme Cramer are look
ing to win multiple events to help fuel the Cardinal attack, while
freshmen distance swimmers Shaun Phillips and Andy Grant
should also contribute.
The Bears' chances may rest on the diving portion of the meet.
In collegiate competition, the two sports are scored as one. Car
dinal junior divers Adam Peterson and Jeff Durbin carried Stan
ford the past of couple years but both are injured this season.
That leaves the diving duties up to freshman Kevin McLean and
junior Jesse Fonner, who will compete against Cal's Louie Gag
net, a transfer from Florida State and an NCAA scorer. The two
diving events could result in as much as a 30-point hole for the
Cardinal.
The entire Cal swimming program is in high spirits after the
Cal women's team upset the Stanford women last weekend. Led
by world record holder Natalie Coughlin, the Cal women showed
that Stanford swimming is not invincible, defeating the Cardinal
for the first time since 1976.
Both the Cal and Stanford men's teams are tuning up for the
championship season to come and are looking to put up some
solid times.
