# Slowly but surely, Yeung returns to old form
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Gymnastics is not like riding a bike. The
highly specialized muscle memory and
strength needed to perform the skills make
it difficult fora gymnast to pick up the sport
after even a week out of the gym. Three
years without setting foot on the floor or
touching a bar can feel like an eternity to a
gymnast's body.
Few people know the feeling better than
Stanford junior Ambert Yeung, who
stopped doing gymnastics when his family
moved to Singapore during his senior year of
high school. He returned to the gym this past
summer as a walk-on and is currently a con
tributing member for the No. 9 Cardinal (2-4)
mens team.
At the Cardinal Open this past Saturday,
Yeung placed second on the high bar to help
Stanford nab a victoiy over Arizona State
and Washington.
Although Yeung, who compted in the Ju
nior Olympics, had been recruited to com
pete for Stanford as a freshman, he chose not
to join the team when he arrived on the
Farm.
"It didn't seem like the most pressing thing
to get involved in gymnastics when I came as a
freshman," Yeung said. "There were so many
new opportunities to explore and clubs to join.''
At the end of his sophomore year, how
ever, Yeung was itching to be back in the
gym. He considered a return to the sport a
personal challenge.
"Coming to the end of last year, I felt
restless, not having accomplished much or
having put myself up to any task," Yeung
said. "I wanted to see how much I could
push myself physically and maximize my ef
forts in school and sports while still balanc
ing sleep every night."
Readjusting to the daily grind of training
has been the hardest part of Yeung's return
to the sport. He works twice as hard to do
skills which were easy for him three years
ago. And even though the skills are in no rush

to come back, the old aches and pains show
no signs of reluctance.
"The shin splints, forearm splints and other
little ailments came back to bug me as if I
hadn't stopped," Yeung said.
Despite setbacks, Yeung is improving
rapidly. He started the season with a pommel
horse routine that was worth only a 9.2 if done
perfectly and has since upgraded the difficulty
so he can now score a 9.8 or 9.9.
"He has really taken to the training," said
Stanford head coach Thom Glielmi. "His
body is holding up and he is getting more and
more consistent and is adding difficulty to his
routines. I have been impressed with his abili
ty to get back into the grind."
Yeung is also readjusting his daily life on
campus. During his first two years at Stan
ford, he had grown accustomed to a flexible
schedule — able to sleep in, procrastinate on
homework, play video games and participate
in recreational sports like mountain biking
and golf. The regimented schedule of a varsi
ty athlete, however, has made him increase
his focus.
"I knew 1 had to step up my energy just to
be able to survive," Yeung said. "But last
quarter was actually my best yet at Stanford.
I left practice bruised and battered, but I felt
energized ... because it was my choice to
push this hard."
How far can the junior rookie push himself?
"If he is able to train over the summer and
add to his repertoire of skills, 1 think he could
be an AIl-American on two events," said
Glielmi. "This year has been more of a rein
troduction to the training, competing with a
team and basically being a collegiate athlete
and handling the demands outside the gym."
Yeung will compete on high bar, pommel
horse and floor exercise this weekend across
the Bay as Stanford takes on No. 4 California
for the third time this season. Stanford has fall
en to the Golden Bears in the last two meets,
but since this will be the team's last away meet,
Glielmi is hoping the team will give Cal a run
by posting over 214 points.

homework, play video games and participate
in recreational sports like mountain biking
and golf. The regimented schedule of a varsi
ty athlete, however, has made him increase
his focus.
"I knew 1 had to step up my energy just to
be able to survive," Yeung said. "But last
quarter was actually my best yet at Stanford.
I left practice bruised and battered, but I felt
energized ... because it was my choice to
push this hard."
How far can the junior rookie push himself?
"If he is able to train over the summer and
add to his repertoire of skills, 1 think he could
be an AIl-American on two events," said
Glielmi. "This year has been more of a rein
troduction to the training, competing with a
team and basically being a collegiate athlete
and handling the demands outside the gym."
Yeung will compete on high bar, pommel
horse and floor exercise this weekend across
the Bay as Stanford takes on No. 4 California
for the third time this season. Stanford has fall
en to the Golden Bears in the last two meets,
but since this will be the team's last away meet,
Glielmi is hoping the team will give Cal a run
by posting over 214 points.
