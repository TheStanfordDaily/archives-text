Club Sports Update
Mien's Rugby (1-5)
The season thus far has been all
about rebuilding. The number of
players training with and compet
ing for the club has been increas
ing. and many have played through
injuries to ensure a full side could

be put out. It hasn't quite come
right on the field for the full SO min
utes yet, though, with only the B
team having scored a win (against
Nevada-Reno). In the latest
games, both sides lost against
Sacramento State, in efforts that
showed both the strengths and
weaknesses of the team this year.
Upcoming games include a
home match against St. Mary's
on Feb. 21 and then home games

on Feb. 28 (Chico State) and
March 6 (California), followed
by a spring break tour in Wales.

The women are currently in
search of a national title. Their sea
son started off a little slowly, but
now they are firing on all cylinders

their latest games against Hum
boldt State. Now the women face
the task of continuing to improve
week by week so that they reach
their peak for the playoffs in April.

Island, Calif., which will be followed
