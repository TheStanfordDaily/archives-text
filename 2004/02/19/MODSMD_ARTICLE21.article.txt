### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Georgia Tech men's golf
team must wish that it got to play the
TaylorMade Waikoloa Intercollegiate
event more than once a year. Last
Thursday, the Yellowjackets won the
event by three strokes over No. 4
UCLA. Stanford shot a total of 863 for
the tournament, one shot back of Pep
perdine and 22 off Georgia Techs win
ning pace, and placed 11th.
The victory is the fourth for the Yel
lowjackets in their last eight years of
coming to the Waikoloa Kings' Course
and the team has never finished out of
the top five.
The 54-hole event spanned three
days and both Georgia Tech and Stan
ford got out to strong starts during the
first round of play. Georgia Tech shot
out ahead of the field with a 16-under
par272.
Stanford shot a 4-under-par 284,
its lowest round of the year, and fin
ished the day in a tie for fifth place
overall, just two strokes behind sec
ond-place UCLA.
Freshman Zack Miller and junior
Kevin Blue led the way with matching
scores of 69 and sat in a tie for fourth
place individually.
"Usually the wind will separate the
guys who are really playing well from
those who aren't." Blue said. "But this
year the whole field played pretty well
because of the absence of wind."
Senior Blake Mastalir was just one
stroke back of his teammates and pail
of a 13-player logjam in 11th place.
Sophomore Scott Mac Donald and
freshman Brandon Lawson rounded
out the first-day scoring for the Cardi
nal, as Mac Donald shot a 76 and Law
son turned in a round of 80.
Stanford stumbled a bit on the sec
ond day, shooting its worst round of the
tournament — a 6-over-par 294 —
and dropped back to eighth place on
Wednesday.
Miller showed maturity beyond his
years by playing steadily while his
teammates struggled. With a second

round 73, he slid back, but remained in
a tie for 14th place individually. Blue
slipped a bit as well, shooting a 75 and
dropping to 29th place.
After a solid 70 on Tuesday,
Mastalir ballooned to 78 on Wednes
day, plummeting to 64th place overall.
Mac Donald and Lawson rebounded
slightly, each shooting 73.
Heading into the final 18 holes, the
Cardinal trailed its closest opponent.
Southern California, by four shots and
was just seven strokes out of the top five.
Fortunately, the Cardinal returned
to first-round form, shooting a 285 and
finishing the tournament 1-under par.
Unfortunately, however, Stanford was
surrounded by other low scores on the
final day .dropping out of the top 10.
Once again. Miller led the charge,
playing his best round of the tourna
ment and shooting 68. Pushing his way
up the leader board, he finished in a tie
for eighth place individually, his sec
ond consecutive top-10 showing.
Blue finished tied for 38th place
after an even-par 72 on Thursday.
Mastalir. following his 78 with a final
round 76, sank to 78th place.
Mac Donald continued his upward
trend with a l-under-par7l and tied for
55th place. Lawson wrapped up his
week with a 74 and finished 92nd.
Oklahoma freshman Anthony Kim
took home top individual honors,
shooting back-to-back 67s on Wednes
day and Thursday to edge the field by
two strokes.
"I didn't do anything exceptional
this week." Kim said. "I just played
well all the way around. I think the key
was [that] 1 played smart and managed
my game well."
As Stanford prepares for its next
tournament — the Cleveland Golf
Classic, which begins March 1 — the
players are confident that they are
gaining momentum for the stretch run.
"I think our young guys saw the best
they have up close and understand that
we can play as well as they do," Blue
said. "We're looking forward to play
ing aggressively and confidently in our
next tournament at USC."
