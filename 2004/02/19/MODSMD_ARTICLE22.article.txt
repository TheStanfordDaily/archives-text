# Women's polo hosts Irvine, 49ers

### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When describing the team's outlook on the
rest of the season, the No. 3 Stanford women's
water polo can agree on one thing.
Excitement. Excitement. Excitement.
"We're excited to play, we're excited to prac
tice, we're excited to win for sure," said junior
Hannah Luber.
Stanford (3-1) heads into its second week of
play with back-to-back matches this weekend
against No. 14 UC-Irvine (5-4, 1-1 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) and No. 4 Long Beach
State (4-0,0-0 MPSF) at the Avery Aquatic Cen
ter. The games will be the first that count in the
MPSF standings for Stanford.
Even though the season is still young, traces of
the offensive attack Stanford showed last season
are beginning to shine through this season as well.
Led by senior Wendy Watkins, who has nine
goals this season, the Cardinal has outscored its
opponents 37 to 20.
"We're scoring a lot of goals and creating a lot
on offense," Stanford head coach John Tanner
said. "We're getting very balanced scoring [at dif
ferent distances] and phases."
The Cardinal is looking to duplicate last
year's dominance, when it outscored its oppo
nents 173 to 66. One thing that could help the
Cardinal reach that goal this season is its depth.
"There are always six solid players in at a time
that are total offensive players that can put the
ball in the goal," Watkins said. "It's nice that if
they try to shut down one or two players there are
other people that will pick up the slack and help
out with the scoring."
UC-Irvine. a relatively new addition to the
women's water polo collegiate scene, has had
mixed results so far this season. The Anteaters
are led by interim head coach Marc Hunt because
Dan Klatt is in the midst of training with the U.S.
Olympic team.
The Cardinal will be up against the current
MPSF Player of the Week, senior goalkeeper
Sunceray Chamblee. Chamblee finished last
week with 11 saves, five coming in a loss against
San Diego State (4-1, 1-0), and six from the
Anteaters' last game, a 5-4, double-overtime
win.
Other Anteaters on whom the Cardinal

should keep an eye include senior Erica Hor
man, who holds most of her school's scoring
records, and Robin Kaake, who has a team-lead
ing 18 goals.
The Cardinal counters with a young but confi
dent squad. Instead of looking at its youth nega
tively, the Cardinal is excited about the opportu
nities such a team can bring.
"Since it's such a young team, we have a lot of
depth," Luber said. "We don't necessarily have
the star players, but we have everyone working
together a lot better. Everyone can step up and
stand out in turn and all at once at the same time."
Stanford faces a slightly bigger threat Sunday
against Long Beach State, which is was ranked

right below Stanford in the pre-season national
collegiate top 20 poll. The 49ers are coming off
their best season ever, posting 24 wins and break
ing many of their team records.
The 49ers have a good chance of repeating last
year's success, since they return six of seven
starters. The 49ers also feature two Ail-Ameri
cans. Roberta Stewart and Angelica Garcia.
While Stanford players are very eager about
the rest of the season, excitement alone won't win
games. Tanner uses another word to describe the
sentiments for the rest of the season.
"Improvement," he said. "For the most part
we have been working on improving ourselves
tactically."
