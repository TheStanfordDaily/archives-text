## When a fear goes too far... Dealing with phobias 
### PHOEBE PRIOLEAU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While many of us feel slightly un
comfortable when we step on an air
plane or cringe at the thought of creepy,
crawling critters, it would he wrong to
label these fears as phobias, unless the
anxiety associated with the object or
experience significantly disrupts the ac
tivities in our daily lives. According to
Alejandro Martinez, director of Coun
seling and Psychological Services
(CAPS), the level of fear and anxiety
experienced during a specific situation
or object is an important factor in de
termining whether or not something
can be classified as a specific phobia.
"It's important to distinguish be
tween (general] anxiety and a [specific]
phobia," Martinez said.
"There are a significant number of
people who feel anxiety associated with
a certain action. People are afraid of
Hying, animals, objects and events. The
defining variable is the intensity of the
anxiety and the level of disruption that
it causes," he added. Thus, while anxi
ety and phobias are both important
psychological problems, they are often
treated in different ways.
Fears of a particular object, event or
situation are called specific phobias,
and they are only one general type of
phobia that can affect the general pop
ulation. According to CAPS, students
are more likely to seek treatment for
social phobia, or social anxiety disor
der, which is defined as a fear of inter
acting with other people.
Psychological problems such as pho

bias and social anxiety can create a stig
ma, possibly explaining why few Stan
ford students choose to seek treatment
for most specific phobias.
"Fewer than one percent of the cases
[we saw at the Vaden Student Health
Center last year] were due to [specific]
phobias," Martinez said, who reported
that he was not surprised with the re
sults.
"There are not many people who are
so distressed that it seriously impacts
their lives," he said.
There are a variety of ways to over
come specific phobias, but not every
treatment is useful for everyone. Some
people can function quite effectively
without treatment, and self-help books
can often be used in lieu of personal
therapy.
"The principle approach is to help
people learn how to reduce the anxiety
associated with the [phobia]," Martinez
said. "Someone with a phobia of flying
might have an anxiety attack just think
ing about going to the airport. One
technique is gradual exposure to fear."
The goal of treatment often isn't full
recovery; instead, patients focus on
being able to carry out their daily lives
without significant anxiety when they
encounter the object or are in the fear
inducing situation. Yet as with any psy
chological treatment, Martinez ex
plains, "learning how to reduce an anx
iety response takes time."
Martinez explained phobias are pre
sent in every walk of life and that they
are part of a complex set of learned re
sponses we acquire when we are young.
"The.y even affect children," he said.

"Some fears are learned fears, taken
from others such as a parent. You as a
child will be sensitive to certain situa
tions. Your phobias are likely to be sus
tained fas you grow up]. The challenge
with phobias is that people get help
only when it begins to impact the quali
ty of their lives," he said. "If you are
negatively impacted by your fears, you
should contact Psychological Services."
Mild cases of phobias abound on
campus; students reported fearing ob
jects from sharks to spiders.
"I guess I saw [the movie] 'Jaws' too
early in life," said sophomore David
Gudai as he explained his fear of
sharks. "But I get so scared every time I
go surfing," he said.
"I've read articles about shark at
tacks. I feel more comfortable in a pool
than I do in the ocean, but I still have
this weird tendency to look around
every time I'm in a pool," he added.
Martinez said that a larger percent
age of students had sought treatment
for social phobia than specific phobias.
While social anxiety disorder is less like
the typical phobia in the literature, it
can influence the lives of those who ex
perience it. Psychology prof. Lynne
Henderson noted that the number of
Stanford students who label themselves
as having a phobia has increased in the
past thirty years.
"In a study done in the late 19905,
about 60 percent of Stanford students
labeled themselves as shy, in compari
son with 40 percent in the 19705. A sub
stantial portion of people feel shy in
one situation or another," Henderson
said. "Someone can label themselves as
shy and not see it as a problem. Shy
ness only becomes a real problem if it
prevents people from doing what they
want to do.
"There's reason to be worried if
you're not sleeping, you're depressed
or you won't go to a social function
without alcohol. Alcohol can become a
psychological crutch," Henderson
added.
The increase in the numbers of those
who define themselves as "shy" may
be partly related to contemporary pop
culture, as we often compare ourselves
to images in the movies, where many
people are extremely extroverted.
Normal people may not be the most
talkative students in class, Henderson
elaborated, but may feel as though
they are shy because they do not fit the
image they see on the screen.
Treatment can vary from one-on-one
therapy sessions to group therapy. The
latter is often the choice for those who
find shyness a serious impediment.
"Group therapy puts people in a sit
uation that they're scared of," Hender
son said. "People that label themselves
as shy often do well in collaborative
situations."
Experts recommended keeping a
journal of negative thoughts and
telling one or two good friends about
your experiences. If the condition is
more severe, students might want to
contact CAPS or go The Bridge, a peer
counseling center.

Phobias such as a fear of snakes, spiders, heights or flying on airplanes are common
among the general population.
