# Risky sexual practices
## Improper contraceptive use on college campuses

Condoms. Pills. Spermicide.
All the tools of the trade, right here at Stanford — at Vaden's Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center (SHPRC) and Planned Parenthood only minutes from
campus. Heck, you can find them even in a bowl outside your Peer Health Edu
cator's (PHE) room three doors down. But just how many students are willing to
take advantage of these contraceptive candy stores? Or more importantly, how
many students have the knowledge to do so properly?
Just because birth control is readily available at Stanford does not mean the strug
gle to ensure safe sex for all students is over. Several battles have yet to be won, in
cluding the one for over-the-counter emergency contraception, as well as for educa
tional programs to reach the students who are not comfortable asking questions re
garding their sexual health.
Undergraduates at many institutions are often uninformed about proper con
traceptive use. A 1997 survey conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health
reported that even though 71 percent of the 8,500 undergraduate students who
responded said they were sexually active, only 43 percent said they always used
condoms during intercourse and, even more shockingly, nearly a quarter of
those surveyed said they never used condoms. Numbers may have improved
since then, but data still points to improper use of birth control.
While sexual protection is the responsibility of both partners, those with the
Y chromosome are likely to be the ones to blunder: Statistics collected by Emory
and Indiana Universities showed that heterosexual college men were the most
likely to make errors when using a condom. While the sample size was relative
ly small, the researchers said their findings were a clear indication of the lack of
contraceptive education programs on college campuses.
Conducted at the beginning of 2001, the study surveyed 158 men who had used
condoms within the previous three months. Within this time frame. 42 percent of
these men said they had wanted to use a condom during intercourse, but didn't be
cause they didn't have one handy. Seventy-four percent did not inspect condoms for
small holes or tears; 61 percent never check the expiration date; and 60 percent said
they didn't talk about using condoms with their partner prior to intercourse. More
surprisingly, 15 percent testified to removing a condom before finishing with inter
course, while 43 percent said they had put one on after initiating intercourse. Thirty
percent even admitted to putting the condom upside down and then having to flip it
over in the middle of having sex.
Even when condoms were used properly, 29 percent of these men said con
doms had broken during intercourse, and 13 percent said at least one condom
had slipped off. The Harvard survey also mentioned that men who sleep with
multiple partners are actually less likely to use condoms during sex.
At Stanford, the scene may be slightly different, but as the PHEs will al
ways tell you, a little more sexual education would never hurt.
"Most Stanford students are highly educated, sophisticated and take good
care of themselves," said Carole Pertofsky, director of Health Promotion
Services at Vaden Health Center. "But it's always beneficial to discuss and
publicize resources, self-care practices and caring for our sexual partners."
She added that Vaden offers sexual health education and counseling services
run by both students and professional staff. Pertofsky highlighted New Stu
dent Orientation's "The Real World: Stanford" presentation as a primary
way the University informs incoming students about the choices and respon
sibilities that come with sex.
Vaden's pharmacy and the SHPRC provide various forms of barrier contracep
tion, including the female condom. In fact, Stanford students are entitled to 12 free
condoms per quarter in addition to other products. If 12 isn't enough, students can
also purchase condoms at a discounted price.
Women can make an appointment at Vaden to obtain a prescription for the pill
and pick it up at the pharmacy. It isn't unusual to get an appointment time for same
day calls. Pertofsky says it is important to get a prescription beforehand because the
pill can impact individuals' health differently dependent on personal health history.
Emergency contraception is currently a hot-button issue when it comes
to contraception on campus. While the FDA decided in December that it
would be beneficial to offer the morning after pill over the counter, the
final approval has not been made. A decision on the issue is expected be
fore the end of February.
