### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
How will you die? Based on my family's medical his
tory, I know a heart attack will ultimately lead to my
final curtain call — quick and dirty, the way I'd prefer
for it to happen. I won't have to deal with the agony of
impending mortality and prolonged goodbyes.
The hotshot doctor, perhaps fresh out of residency
training, will have done all she or he could do to save
me, but to no avail. Yet I'll bare no grudges. For all of
the latest advancements in technology — even those
seemingly magical treatments that will be developed
when we're grayed and have become a bit senile —
nothing can halt the inevitable marching of life that will
lead us to permanent slumber.
Medicine, regardless of the weighty esteem society
has placed on its buckling shoulders, is a fallible insti
tution. In a 1991 study published by the New England
Journal of Medicine, four percent of all hospital pa
tients suffered complications from treatment, which
resulted in disability or death. Two-thirds of those
complications, surprisingly, were due to errors in
care: a misinterpreted X-ray, an aberrant scalpel

movement, an insufficient regiment of medications.
A 1999 cadaver study revealed that up to of 40 per
cent of patients would have lived longer if doctors
had administered the proper treatment.
The doctors, of course, are burdened with full
culpability for these errors. Having undertaken a
decade of medical training, doctors are blessed —
or cursed, depending on whether you view the
glass as half-empty or half-full — with handling
matters of life and death. Their decisions, often in
tuitive if not impulsive, are the deciding factor in
determining whether the kids will end up visiting
grandma at home or in the funeral parlor.
Indeed, we have bestowed upon our peers a decid
edly mythical task: curing the ailments of the sick. For
some doctors, however, the mystique of medicine grad
ually loses its luster and the idealized calling begun in
one's youth is reduced to jaded employment in one's
middle-age years. So you hear the stories: operations
on the wrong limb, surgical tools left behind in the rib
cage, cruel jokes involving cadavers. On a far less seri
ous level, though still with a degree of cynicism, I've
seen surgeons perform operations with pop music blar
ing in the background and physicians joke that they

Medicine as the imperfect art

equate patients with monetary flow.
Even though most physicians, thankfully, still hold
the Hippocratic Oath — vowing to do no harm — dear
to their hearts, but the bottom line is that mistakes are
still made. Borne from a mixture of ignorance and in
eptitude, the fallibility is a risk that we have to accept in
medicine. Of course, mistakes can be minimized —
better training, improved technology, automated diag
noses. Unfortunately, humans, even when they don
their white coats, are still prone to the same errors that
afflict all forms of decision-making. It's impossible,
after all, to correctly predict all the possible outcomes
of a difficult medical procedure — especially when it
involves something as infinitely complicated as the
human body.
That does not mean, however, that doctors
shouldn't do everything in their power to keep improv
ing the ways they practice their art. Academic hospitals
like the Stanford Medical Center have a weekly Mor
bidity and Mortality Conference, which, as the ghoul
ishly name implies, is a place where doctors review mis
takes. deaths and unforeseen events, in the hopes that
the same errors won't occur the next time around. And
doctors can document "scientific" problems their myr

iad specialty journals, in which oddities and mistakes
are packaged as science, so that knowledge can be dis
seminated and the field moved forward.
The doctor-patient relationship hinges on trust
— the patient's trust that the doctor is doing ev
erything in her or his power to remedy the ailment
and the doctor's trust that whatever decisions he
makes will not necessarily result in a malpractice
suit. Indeed, while the decision-making process
lies ultimately with the patient, the doctor, having
jumped through all the hoops to obtain his medical
license, has a broader understanding of the vari
ous risks and benefits associated with each medi
cation and procedure.
Fortunately, if history is any indication, things will
improve. A century ago, a person automatically associ
ated a hospital with death. Now, even though a hospi
tal's morgue continues to shuttle bodies in and out of
the door, the hospital, backed by the stringency of the
medical establishment and the punishing pace of scien
tific breakthroughs, is seen as a beacon of life.

for it to happen. I won't have to deal with the agony of
impending mortality and prolonged goodbyes.
The hotshot doctor, perhaps fresh out of residency
training, will have done all she or he could do to save
me, but to no avail. Yet I'll bare no grudges. For all of
the latest advancements in technology — even those
seemingly magical treatments that will be developed
when we're grayed and have become a bit senile —
nothing can halt the inevitable marching of life that will
lead us to permanent slumber.
Medicine, regardless of the weighty esteem society
has placed on its buckling shoulders, is a fallible insti
tution. In a 1991 study published by the New England
Journal of Medicine, four percent of all hospital pa
tients suffered complications from treatment, which
resulted in disability or death. Two-thirds of those
complications, surprisingly, were due to errors in
care: a misinterpreted X-ray, an aberrant scalpel

movement, an insufficient regiment of medications.
A 1999 cadaver study revealed that up to of 40 per
cent of patients would have lived longer if doctors
had administered the proper treatment.
The doctors, of course, are burdened with full
culpability for these errors. Having undertaken a
decade of medical training, doctors are blessed —
or cursed, depending on whether you view the
glass as half-empty or half-full — with handling
matters of life and death. Their decisions, often in
tuitive if not impulsive, are the deciding factor in
determining whether the kids will end up visiting
grandma at home or in the funeral parlor.
Indeed, we have bestowed upon our peers a decid
edly mythical task: curing the ailments of the sick. For
some doctors, however, the mystique of medicine grad
ually loses its luster and the idealized calling begun in
one's youth is reduced to jaded employment in one's
middle-age years. So you hear the stories: operations
on the wrong limb, surgical tools left behind in the rib
cage, cruel jokes involving cadavers. On a far less seri
ous level, though still with a degree of cynicism, I've
seen surgeons perform operations with pop music blar
ing in the background and physicians joke that they

Medicine as the imperfect art

equate patients with monetary flow.
Even though most physicians, thankfully, still hold
the Hippocratic Oath — vowing to do no harm — dear
to their hearts, but the bottom line is that mistakes are
still made. Borne from a mixture of ignorance and in
eptitude, the fallibility is a risk that we have to accept in
medicine. Of course, mistakes can be minimized —
better training, improved technology, automated diag
noses. Unfortunately, humans, even when they don
their white coats, are still prone to the same errors that
afflict all forms of decision-making. It's impossible,
after all, to correctly predict all the possible outcomes
of a difficult medical procedure — especially when it
involves something as infinitely complicated as the
human body.
That does not mean, however, that doctors
shouldn't do everything in their power to keep improv
ing the ways they practice their art. Academic hospitals
like the Stanford Medical Center have a weekly Mor
bidity and Mortality Conference, which, as the ghoul
ishly name implies, is a place where doctors review mis
takes. deaths and unforeseen events, in the hopes that
the same errors won't occur the next time around. And
doctors can document "scientific" problems their myr

iad specialty journals, in which oddities and mistakes
are packaged as science, so that knowledge can be dis
seminated and the field moved forward.
The doctor-patient relationship hinges on trust
— the patient's trust that the doctor is doing ev
erything in her or his power to remedy the ailment
and the doctor's trust that whatever decisions he
makes will not necessarily result in a malpractice
suit. Indeed, while the decision-making process
lies ultimately with the patient, the doctor, having
jumped through all the hoops to obtain his medical
license, has a broader understanding of the vari
ous risks and benefits associated with each medi
cation and procedure.
Fortunately, if history is any indication, things will
improve. A century ago, a person automatically associ
ated a hospital with death. Now, even though a hospi
tal's morgue continues to shuttle bodies in and out of
the door, the hospital, backed by the stringency of the
medical establishment and the punishing pace of scien
tific breakthroughs, is seen as a beacon of life.
