# Send in the Reserves
## On a team full of veterans, one Stanford frosh is making an immediate impact in his first year on the Farm 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Fred Washington got off to a hot start at Stanford,
hitting a 3-pointer and going 6-for-6 from the free
throw line in the then-No. 20 Cardinal's 72-59 win over
UC-Irvine on Nov. 25. It was an unexpected breakout
performance from a freshman, who was last in line in
the Cardinal's veteran frontcourt.
Since then, Washington's playing time has fluctuated
depending on the Cardinal's injury situation, hut head
coach Mike Montgomery has continued to give the
freshman forward meaningful minutes when he can.
"If everyone was healthy, 1 don't know if I'd he get
ting in as much," Washington said. "But over the
course of the season. I guess I've shown that I'm able
to go in there and not be a weak link."
Young reserves are usually reliant upon non-confer
ence laughers and the occasional in-conference
blowout to get their minutes. But Washington has man
aged to work his way into meaningful games, too. such
as Stanford's recent 80-77 win over No. 14 Arizona or
its 87-80 win in December over No. 6 Gonzaga.
And while Washington rarely plays for more than a
few minutes at a time, he has seen action in 16 of Stan
ford's 21 contests.
This weekend, Stanford will travel to Los Angeles
— where Washington is from —to play USC and
UCLA. Washington will see some familiar faces and
places this weekend — USC's Derrick and Errick
Craven went to his high school, and both of Washing
ton's parents went to UCLA.
But he's not worried about whether he'll get to play
or not.
"I came [to Stanford) just trying to work hard,"
Washington said. "Hopefully down in L.A., I'll be able
to go in and show my family a little something. But if
not, it's all good."
In other words. Washington will take what he can
get —just like he does on the court.
"I do what's there. I'm not going to go one-on-five
and try to get 20 points every game, but if I can get a
shot opportunity, I'm going to take it,"he said. "And
defense, 1 just try to play D every game. I hate it when
somebody scores on me, I really hate it, so I just try to
not let that happen, ever."
At 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds, Washington is not only
shorter than a lot of the players he goes up against but
lighter, too. And yet. he averages more offensive re
bounds (3.60) per 40 minutes than any Cardinal this
side of Justin Davis and more steals per 40 minutes

than anyone on the team (3.96).
"I'm usually quicker than the bigger guys, stronger
than the smaller guys," Washington said of his unusu
al prowess at both boarding and ball-hawking.
"My dad always told me, 'If you're going to make
mistakes, make them at full speed,' " Washington said.
"So if I'm going to mess up, I'm going to mess up try
ing to do something."
So far, Washington hasn't messed up too often.
He's averaging 1.6 points and 1.4 rebounds in just 6.9
minutes per game, while shooting 47.6 percent from
the floor and 66.7 percent from the line.
Washington credits junior Josh Childress and se
nior Nick Robinson — the players he usually guards in
practice — for helping him improve his game.
"Guarding Josh and Nick every day is going to help
your defense out," Washington said.
In particular, Washington has benefited from
Robinson's guidance. In addition to leading an athlete
advising group that helped Washington prepare for
life as a college student-athlete, Robinson occupies a
role on the Cardinal that Washington looks up to and
knows a thing or two about — that of the versatile
swingnian.
"I've been everywhere," Washington said. "In high
school I'd guard centers or forwards ... some summer
tournaments, I'd play point or something... I'd go
anywhere, kind of like Nick."
As part of the 21 -0, top-ranked Cardinal. Washing
ton has yet to lose a game. But ask him about the last
time he did lose, and his smile fades fora moment.
"I lost my last game my senior year, we got upset in
the playoffs, so it's been a good while," he said. "But I
still hate that one — I don't like to lose, so I'm glad we
haven't lost yet."
While Washington is averse to a loss of any kind, he
says missed shots or other mistakes don't bother him.
When asked about his hot start to the season, Wash
ington shrugged it off.
"If I would've missed all those shots, I still would've
been positive," he said. "As long as we win, I'm happy.
If I would've gone 0-for-8,1 would've been happy.
"I think I went 0-for-5 one game, but I really didn't
care," he continued, laughing.
This attitude is not one of complacence, though.
Washington said there's a lot of work he needs to do.
"Right now, I need to get stronger," he said. "Our
point guard (Chris Hernandez) can [bench-press] over
300 pounds. I'm trying to get to that."
It's not surprising Washington wants to get stronger,
though. The Cardinal has emphasized team strength,
and Washington has never shied WW f rom contact.
"I think that the L.A. summer leagues kind of
helped out with that," he explained. "The bigger guys,
every time you go in, they're going to hit you. Big guys
don't really like little guys laying the ball up on them.
So if you go in, you expect some contact. You just put
the ball in the basket, no matter what."
