# No. 10 Card seeks momentum at home
## 
### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Basketball fever is spreading on campus as
the top-ranked Stanford men's basketball team
continues to dominate the opposition. With
high tournament hopes of its own, even after
dropping two of its last three games, the Cardi
nal women's team hopes to join the party.
This weekend will give the No. 10 Stanford
women's basketball team (18-5. 11-3 Pacific-10
Conference) a chance to prove that it's got what
it takes to be a champion when USC (14-9, 11-
4) and UCLA (14-10, 9-6) come to town on
Thursday and Saturday, respectively, for the
Cardinal's final home games of the conference
season.
Stanford may be leading the conference, but
it's only edging out USC by half a game and Ari
zona by one game. With only four games left for
Stanford before the Pac-lOTournament begins,
a sweep this weekend would put the Cardinal
right back on track — after having suffered
through a season, thus far, that has been marked
by upsets.
The Cardinal's first Pac-10 loss of the season
came at the hands of the Women of Troy on Jan.
25 in Los Angeles. The upset marked the sec
ond straight season the Cardinal has lost at the
Sports Arena.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer em
phasized the need for better rebounding and
ball-handling against USC this time around, as
well as enthusiasm and intensity — what she
termed "inspired basketball."
The Cardinal's 61 -53 win against Cal last Sat
urday ended a two-game skid and brought the
team back into the top 10, but the win was far
from decisive. The Bears pulled within two
points in the second half and the eight-point
final margin was Stanford's closest home game
in the Pac-10 this season.
Stanford committed 20 turnovers against
Cal, a recurring problem this season.
"I honestly cannot understand some of
those turnovers," VanDerveer said. "Some of
the plays, instead of passing the ball, you
throw it at them ... at this point in the season
it's a puzzle. We're not doing a good job in our
offensive execution."
Still, the game showed that many members of
the Cardinal squad are capable of delivering
strong performances. Junior forward T'Nac Thiel
shot 88.9 percent from the field fora season-high
16 points and pulled down five rebounds.
"T'Nae is playing really well for us right
now," VanDerveer said. "Other people are

stepping up, and we're not depending on Nicole
for everything."
Senior forward Nicole Powell was held to
just 12 points against Cal but is still averaging
21.4 points and 11.3 rebounds in conference
play. She also leads the Cardinal with 20.4
points and 11.1 rebounds per game for the year.
VanDerveer was particularly proud of ju
nior guard Susan Borchardt, who added 14
points in the win over Cal.
"I was very excited with how Susan played."
VanDerveer said. "She was very aggressive."
The women have a history of strong games
on their home court. The Cardinal is 12-1 in
Maples Pavilion so far this year and has won 43
of its last 46 games at home.
Stanford continues to be plagued by in
juries. but some players may return to the court
this weekend.
Freshman center Kristen Newlin, who has
been out for four straight games with a bone
bruise to her knee, is expected to return on
Thursday and Stanford fans could get their first
look at redshirt freshman forward Eziamaka
Okafor in the coming weeks. Okafor, who
missed last season with a torn ACL, tore her
Achilles tendon before the start of this season.
The Women of Troy are within reach of
their first league title in a decade. They have not
had a shot at first place this late in the season
since winning their last Pac-10 championship in
1993-94.
Senior forward Ebony Hoffman leads the
team with 15.5 points per game and 7.9 re
bounds per game. Hoffman recorded her sev
enth double-double this season in USC's 68-66
upset of Arizona on Feb. 15. Senior guard
Rometra Craig (11.2 points per game) and
sophomore guard Meghan Gnekow (7.9 points
per game), who had 19 points against Arizona,
complement Hoffman's post presence.
As winners of five straight. UCLA is the con
ference's hottest team heading into the home
stretch. Freshman guard Noelle Ouinn — this
week's Pac-10 Player of the Week — has
notched five straight 20-point games and has four
double-doubles in the last five games. Sopho
more guard Nikki Blue leads the team with 14.4
points per game and 5.3 rebounds per game.
"Noelle was an outstanding high school play
er and is having an outstanding freshman year,"
VanDerveer said. "1 think she's put up bic num
bers for UCLA. Their perimeter [players]. Blue,
Lisa Willis and Ouinn, are carrying the team. 1 '
This weekend marks the Cardinal's last
home games in Maple's Pavilion before its ren
ovation. Practices will be moved to the Ford

Center and games early next season will be held
at Santa Clara University.
"I think it affects me more than them."
VanDerveer said. "I've been coaching games

in this building looking like this for over 18
years, longer than some of them have been
alive. I'm more sentimental about it than
they are."
