## Judicial bylaw changes compel testimony 
### JORDANA HUBER 
Two new bylaws of the Student Judicial Charter of
1997 have come into effect after approval by the Fac
ulty Senate last week. One bylaw is aimed at forcing
cooperation in investigations of student misconduct
and another is aimed at eliminating redundancy at Ju
dicial Hearings.
The first bylaw, created by the Board on Judicial
Affairs, places new sanctions on those who refuse to
cooperate in a student-misconduct investigation. Pre
viously, there was no penalty for non-compliance. Ac
cording to the new bylaw, students who fail to coop
erate in the adjudicative process may be subject to a
Fundamental Standard charge. The penalty applies to
witnesses at hearings as well as those accused of mis
conduct.
In addition, the bylaw specifies, "Non-student wit
nesses who fail to cooperate may be referred to au
thorities with appropriate jurisdiction."
Although the bylaw was adopted in the spring of
2003. it did not pass through administrative hurdles
until last week. More bylaw changes are in the works
for later in the year.
" The change grew out of two incidents," said
George Wilson, program coordinator for the Office
of Judicial Affairs. He explained that in 2001, a stu
dent accused of misconduct refused to participate in
the review process.
"We were faced with a situation where we needed
to hold a hearing in absentia because the student
would not cooperate."
That case, and another involving a staff member
who refused to appear as a witness, prompted the
Board on Judicial Affairs to create the bylaw.
"We're not like a judge, and we can't hold people
in contempt," Wilson said. "But we are trying to put a
few more teeth in the process."
This is the eighth time since its creation that the
Student Judicial Charter of 1997 has been amended.
The Board of Judicial Affairs creates bylaws, but sev
eral organizations have veto power over them, in
cluding the President's Office, the Faculty Senate and
the ASSIJ Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Stu
dent Council (GSC). None of the organizations chose
to use their veto power on these bylaws after they
were formed with student and administrative input.
The second bylaw grants new powers to the Judi
cial Panel, the group that hears student cases. Under
the new bylaw, the panel can limit witnesses to those
who are able to provide information that is relevant to
the case. In addition, the panel retains the power to
limit witness testimony to that which it deems ger
mane to the case.
Aimed at expediting Judicial Hearings by elimi
nating redundancy in witness testimony, the bylaw
stemmed from several cases "where students called 10
witnesses who all said the same thing," said Wilson.
These testimonies can prolong a hearing by four or
five hours.
The Judicial Panel will still give consideration to all
written arguments submitted on behalf of an accused
by a witness, he emphasized.
"The bylaws are improvements to our existing sys
tem," said ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a se
nior. "I think the GSC especially did a good job of
combing through the changes to make sure they are in
the best interest of students."
To review the bylaws, the GSC formed a commit
tee that worked in tandem with the Board on Judicial
Affairs, providing comment on earlier drafts.
"Amendments are necessary to keep the judicial
process up to date," said GSC Chair Steven Allison, a
doctoral candidate in biological sciences. "It will
make the process more fair and efficient."
According to Wilson, over the course of last year,
the Office of Judicial Affairs investigated 131 com
plaints, of which 75 went to Judicial Hearings and 71
students were "found responsible." Sanctions for vio
lations of the Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code ranged from community service assignments to
expulsion. The standard sanction is a one-quarter sus
pension and 40 hours of community service.
Several new bylaws are pending, including those
that would govern the exclusion of Judicial Panelists
for bias and create a set timeline for review and ap
proval of new bylaws.
