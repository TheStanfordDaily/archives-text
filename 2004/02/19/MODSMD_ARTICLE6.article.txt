Reflecting a national trend, the poker scene on campus
is heating up. The game, once stereotyped as a pastime for
casino rats and middle-aged men, is attracting a younger
following of students playing for fun, pride or money.
There are a number of reasons why the game is hotter
than a pair of aces, students said. Most attributed the rise
in interest to the increased coverage of poker in the media.
"I think it's all about TV," said freshman poker player
Josh Merritt, referring to coverage that includes ESPN's
broadcast of the annual World Series of Poker.
Merritt was taught the game by his math teacher, who
explained that people could play their way through college
with a good poker face.
Sophomore Jeff Sun is well on his way to footing at least
a bit of his tuition bill. He claims to have made almost
$6,000 playing, most of it online.
"The last two years in the World Series of Poker were
won by amateurs who won their way up from online sites,"
Sun said optimistically.
Sun explained that last year's World Series winner, an
accountant named Chris Moneymaker, won the $2.5 mil
lion jackpot after entering through a tournament run by
Poker Stars.com. He paid an entry fee of $40.
At Stanford, students say it's never hard to find a game.
"There seems to be a massive amount of people playing
here on campus," Merritt said.
Many beginners take part in games with their friends for
little or no stakes. Sophomore Kevin Gao started playing
because his friends were into the game.
"I played a little bit for fun with dormmates and my

roommate," Gao said. "Right now, I've won about $20 or
$30, but I haven't really been playing very seriously."
There are also higher-stakes games like the weekly
game at Xanadu, which has a $50 buy-in, as well as regular
games at fraternities.
The online poker sites Pacific Poker.com and Poker-
Room.com are a popular option among more serious play
ers, and another site, Party Poker.com, offers extra money
to players who type in the bonus code "Stanford."
Sun said he made his profits by sticking to a strategy.
"Basically, poker is about money," he said. "People put
their pride into poker, and those are the most beatable
people."
A Stanford education does not always lead to poker win
nings, according to Sun, but it may help. He said he believes
that no single academic skill correlates with poker talent,
but that statistical and psychological acumen are impor
tant — the latter of which often taking years to develop.
Despite its new hip reputation, poker remains a pre
dominately male activity, though experienced players
claim that women have a slight advantage.
When Josh Merritt plays online, he always makes his
icon a female so that other players underestimate him.
Stanford is not the only university to see a spike in in
terest about poker. The University of Pennsylvania's
"Penn Poker Club" drew 175 students and faculty to a re
cent championship tournament, which was sponsored by
Pokerßoom.com.
At the moment, Stanford has no organized poker clubs,
though some students think the idea would be popular.
"I'm sure there would be a lot of interest in starting a
club because a ton of people play," Gao said.
