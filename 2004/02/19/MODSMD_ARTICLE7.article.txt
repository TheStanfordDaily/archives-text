# GSC approves special-fee changes
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) voted unanimously last night
to approve a four-part plan designed
to protect and stabilize the special
fee system of funding student
groups. The GSC's approval means
that the four bills, which the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate passed on
Tuesday, can now go into effect.
The bills, authored by an ad hoc
committee of ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and GSC members, were
met with scant criticism from the
council at last night's meeting.
Aside from minor concerns over an
unclear phrase in one of the bills and
the proposed format of the Web site
for special-fee voting, the council's
members seemed happy to endorse
the proposals.
"I'm extremely pleased," said

GSC chair Steven Allison, a doctor
al candidate in biological sciences.
"This has been a really long
process, and we're ecstatic about the
outcome."
The bills aim to stabilize the sys
tem through two main strategies.
The first is making the refund re
quest process more difficult for stu
dents. The second strategy involves
obligating the student groups that
incur the most refund requests to
cover some of their refund costs.
An additional bill amended the
GSC's bylaws to allow for greater
scrutiny of groups requesting fees
from graduate students. Even
though undergraduate refund re
quests were mainly responsible for
the financial crunch, groups catering
to graduate students have been
threatened.
The trouble began last year,
when the number of students began

requesting special-fee refunds
began to increase dramatically. The
refund option was written into the
ASSU constitution to allow students
to withdraw their financial support
from student groups whose missions
they didn't agree with or whose ser
vices they found lacking.
In reality, however, the individ
ual student groups didn't have to
bear the cost of these refund re
quests. The money instead came out
of a general ASSU buffer fund,
which was maintained by charging
students an extra 8 percent on all
special fees.
For years, the surcharge had
been more than sufficient to accom
modate refund requests and had
even accumulated a surplus. But
when the rate of refund requests
skyrocketed last year and this year,
the buffer fund suddenly looked to
be on a fast track to bankruptcy.

The most substantial reform is a
bylaw change that allows the ASSU
to dip into student groups' reserve
funds to cover excessive refund
costs. This fiscal year, any student
group with more than a 16 percent
refund-request rate will have to
make up the difference through its
own reserve funds.
"Basically, we took this action
because the dramatic increase in re
fund rates both last spring and es
pecially in the fall meant that with
no action there was a strong possi
bility that the buffer fund could be
completely depleted by the end of
this year," said GSC member
Suryah Singh, a doctoral candidate
in engineering.
Other changes include requiring
students who request refunds to fill
out confidential surveys afterward;
changing the ballot Web site to raise

awareness of the consequences of special
fee votes; and, pending approval from the
University, providing refunds in the form
of credits to students' University bills,
rather than simply cutting a check.
GSC Financial Officer Travis Hopp, a
doctoral candidate at the Graduate School
of Business, said he is confident the changes

will result in a drop in refund requests and
stabilize the system in the long term.
"Part of the reason, we feel [the spike in
refund requests] happened is because it's
very easy to get a refund, and students
haven't perceived a link between request
ing a refund and taking money from a
group," Hopp said. "This [policy] creates a
pretty strong link between requesting re
funds and passing those along to groups,
so in the future, if there is a big spike in re
funds, that will lead to declines in the op
erating budgets for groups ... I think it
should work pretty well, by making people
think more about the ballot and think
more about collecting a refund."

haven't perceived a link between request
ing a refund and taking money from a
group," Hopp said. "This [policy] creates a
pretty strong link between requesting re
funds and passing those along to groups,
so in the future, if there is a big spike in re
funds, that will lead to declines in the op
erating budgets for groups ... I think it
should work pretty well, by making people
think more about the ballot and think
more about collecting a refund."
