### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hundreds of students, faculty members
and business professionals attended the
Sixth Annual Principal Investment Con
ference held yesterday at Stanford and
sponsored by the Graduate School of
Business (GSB). The conference focused
on the field of investment, in which jobs
rank among the most sought after posi
tions in business due to their high returns
and profitability.
Prominent figures in the investing
world discussed topics ranging from inter
national investing to real estate investing.
Keynote speakers Carl Thoma of Thoma
Cressey Equity Partners and James Coul
ter of Texas Pacific Group, Inc. — both
Stanford GSB alumni — addressed vari
ous types of investment, especially private
equity, and discussed the opportunities
available in each field.
Ali Rashid, a second year student at
the GSB and one of the head organizers of
the event, named several goals for the
conference.
"We're putting on this conference to
give back to the GSB by getting Stanford's
name out there and educating our fellow
classmates on various opportunities in in
vestment," Rashid said.
Richard Wang, also a second year stu
dent at the GSB and a head organizer for
the conference, added that the purpose of
the event was to discuss issues and trends
impacting all forms of institutional princi
pal investing.
"The conference also serves as a con
duit for members of the Stanford GSB
community to interact with members of
the principal investing community and vice
versa," he said.

Wang also addressed the developments
the conference since its inception.
"The conference has evolved by dis
cussing more topics such as distressed debt
investing, incorporating more forms of in
stitutional principal investing such as
hedge funds, and involving more members
of the Stanford GSB family," he said.
The conference was started in the late
1990s by a group of Stanford GSB students
who wanted to hold investment confer
ences, already popular among East Coast
schools, to Stanford and the West Coast.
"Many East Coast business schools like
Harvard and Wharton already have invest
ment conferences, but it's easier for them
since they have a larger student base and a
huge business community in the surround
ing areas," Rashid said. "Although the
Stanford business school comprises less
than 400 students, we have many top busi
ness leaders in California coming to speak
to us, plus several speakers flying from
other parts of the country."
Lewis Cheng, a first year student at the
GSB, attended the conference to gain per
spective from veterans in the investment
industry.
"Lots of MBA students are trying to get
into this field," he said. "So it's important
for us to learn how viable it is for post-
MBA students to get into investment.
Also, I get to explore the different classes
within investment to help me decide my
plans for the future."
Rashid expressed contentment at the
event's outcome.
"We are very fortunate that Stanford
has a significant amount of alumni in pri
vate equity, real estate and other invest
ment fields that are willing to give back to
this community and share their expertise
with us."
