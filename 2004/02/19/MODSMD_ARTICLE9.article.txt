# Fellow named to Iraq WMD panel
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
President George W. Bush named Graduate
School of Business Prof. Emeritus Henry S.
Rowen last Thursday to a bipartisan commission
charged with the investigation of possible intelli
gence failures concerning the United States as
sessment of Iraq's weapons arsenal.
Rowen was one of the final two members ap
pointed to the nine-person Commission on the
Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Re
garding Weapons of Mass Destruction.
An executive order by Bush released on
Feb. 6 qualified the panel's role in advising the
President: "In order to ensure the most effec
tive counter-proliferation capabilities of the
United States in response to the Sept. 11,2001,
terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat of ter
rorist activity."
The timing of the order, however, has led
some to interpret the commission's creation as a
result of the current controversy over whether
the United States was justified in claiming that
Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein possessed
weapons of mass destruction.
The panel members have yet to meet and do
not know the specific details of their task.
"It's too early to know the scope of the com
mission," Rowen said. "We still have to get secu
rity clearances for this particular commission."
The panel's co-chairmen are Washington
D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Laurence
Silberman, a Republican, and Virginia Gover
nor Chuck Robb, a Democrat. Rowen — a self
proclaimed "technocrat" who worked in the ad
ministration of Presidents John F. Kennedy,
Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and
George H.W. Bush — said that his interest in
the commission is purely as an expert and not as
a political partisan.
"I've been both a Democrat and a Republi
can," Rowen said. "I'm not sure how I'm regis
tered now. I might be a registered Democrat. I'm
an independent, basically."
Because the panel's full report is not due until
March 31, 2005 — after the 2004 presidential
election — some have criticized the Bush admin
istration for politicizing the commission process.
Rowen dismissed such claims, saying that crit
icism could not be avoided in a subject as polem
ical as the recent war in Iraq.
"What else is new?" he said. "You'd expect
the criticism. It would be surprising if there
were no criticism. This subject of weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq has become so con
tentious recently."
The other six members of the commission are
Lloyd Cutler, a White House counsel member
under the administrations of Bill Clinton and
Jimmy Carter; Yale president Richard Levin;
Arizona Republican Senator John McCain; for
mer deputy director of the CIA Admiral William

Studeman; former Washington, D.C. Court of
Appeals Judge Pat Wald and MIT president
Charles Vest.
Following his retirement in 1995, Rowen has
remained active in both the government and at
Stanford, serving as a member of the Defense
Policy Board for Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld and performing as director emeritus of
the Asia / Pacific Research Center.
He also continues to pursue research at the
Hoover Institution, working with Stanford stu
dents to explore such topics as the political
structure of North Korea. Sophomore Mojan
Movassate, who worked as a research assistant
for Rowen over the summer, said that Bush
made a wise decision in appointing Rowen to
the commission.

"Professor Rowen is a very experienced and
distinguished public servant who possesses a
keen understanding of international security is
sues," Movassate said. "In our meetings, he
would constantly challenge me to analyze situa
tions more deeply."
Rowen was deputy assistant secretary of de
fense for international security affairs from 1961
to 1964, president of the RAND Corporation
from 1967 to 1972, chairman of the National In
telligence Council from 1981 to 1983 and assis
tant secretary of defense for international securi
ty affairs from 1989 to 1991. He became a Stan
ford professor in 1972, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution in 1983 and is emeritus pro
fessor of public policy and management at the
Graduate School of Business.
