# Increases in tuition, housing concern students
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford announced last week that fees for tuition, room and board
will increase by a combined 4.5 percent for the 2004-2005 academic
year. Although University officials say the increase is necessary and
will not significantly affect the amount of financial aid students re
ceive. many students said they are concerned about the possible con
sequences of such an uptake.
The increase in undergraduate fees includes a 4.5 percent increase
in tuition from $28,564 to $29,847. There will also be a 6.1 percent in
crease in undergraduate housing costs and a 3.2 percent increase in
boarding fees.
Some students question, however, how necessary the increase is
given that the University is currently running on a surplus.
"It just doesn't make any sense that the school has a surplus and yet
is not using it to the students' benefit," said freshman Celen Zepeda.
University officials replied that the surplus does not contribute to
general operation fees.
"The surplus was in large part a result of the fact that the financial
markets produced a larger than expected payout from our endowment
and other investments," said University Provost John Etchemendy.
"Since two-thirds of the surplus represents restricted funds — in other
words, funds whose use is restricted to specific purposes by a donor —
the funds cannot support the general operation of the University."
In the past two years, Stanford has cut budgets across the board.
Faculty and staff are working with salaries frozen at last year's level.
The economy has placed stress on many universities across the nation.
According to the U.S. Detroit News, the average cost of tuition has in
creased by 40 percent nationwide within the past 10 years.
Many of Stanford's peer institutions are experiencing a similar
need to raise tuition. Yale University faces debt and increased tuition
by 4.5 percent last year, the greatest increase in a decade. However,
Yale also managed to reduce self-help— meaning loans and work
study — last year to $4,000 per student. Though the cost of attending
Harvard University has also increased in recent years, the amount of
financial aid given has increased 54 percent in the past four years.
The overall cost of attendance at Princeton University will increase
by 4.5 percent to $38,397 the upcoming academic year, which includes
a 4.8 percent increase in tuition. Cornell students will also pay an ad
ditional 4.8 percent in tuition for the 2004-2005 academic year.
Given the pressures of the economy and inflation in expenses. Uni
versity officials said that the 4.5 percent increase is acceptable.
"We're pleased that we are again able to hold the overall increase
for undergraduate charges to 4.5 percent," Chair of the Board of
Trustees Isaac Stein told the Stanford Report.
Etchemendy also pointed out that most students on financial aid
will likely be unaffected.
"The undergraduate financial-aid budget is always increased when
tuition goes up," he said. "If a student's family cannot afford to pay
more, then the tuition increase will have absolutely no effect on that
student, since the increase is covered by additional financial aid."
However, given that at the beginning of the year financial aid was
directed more toward self-help, some students said they worry that
the tuition increase will simply raise the amount of loans they have to
repay after they graduate.
"This just adds another year for me to work off," said freshman
Robert Lerrigo.
Associate Dean and Director of Financial Aid Earl Dowling said,
however, that an increase in the burden placed on students is a mis
conception. He again cited that if a family's income does not increase,
then financial aid will pick up the tuition increase.
"This year's tuition increase will not af
fect our student's self-help expectations,"
he said.
Nonetheless, many Stanford students
are concerned that this increase will be
particularly detrimental to students from
middle-class families who often are ineligi
ble for financial aid.
"In the four years that I've been at
Stanford I've seen tuition go up every
year," said senior Katie Buchanan. "Many
people are getting squeezed — not only
people on financial aid, but also middle
class families who are expected to absorb
this cost."

In response, university officials point
out that full tuition covers less than 60 per
cent of the costs of a Stanford education.
"It's important to recognize that stu
dents do not pay for the lull cost of an un
dergraduate education," Dowling said ear
lier this year. "Everyone is receiving some
help from the school."
Buchanan raises the concern, however,
of how continuous increases in tuition will
affect high school students considering
Stanford, especially those from the mid
die-class.
"Seeing tuition rise every year could be
a major deterrent," she said. "This may
lead to a bifurcation of the student body
toward the low-income families who re
ceive financial aid and the high-income
families who are willing to pay any
amount. I don't think that this will be good
for Stanford's diversity."
