# Tuition hike must be explained
## 
### 
Last week, the Board of Trustees approved
next year's undergraduate tuition at
$29,847 — an increase of 4.5 percent from
this academic year.
Although the sum of tuition and room and board
is now set to he $39,347, which exceeds the average
American income of $35,752, the University mini
mizes discussion of fee increases. Every year, ad
ministrators simply issue a press release announcing
the following year's tuition increase with carefully
worded quotations and selected information. The
explanations and rationalizations in this year's press
release were too short, inconsistent with last year's
press release and misleading with respect to finan
cial aid.
While we acknowledge that a first-class education
is unavoidably expensive, we call fora clearer expla
nation and discussion to justify our tuition increases.
Though such press releases often cite factors be
yond the University's control for the tuition in
creases, the blame on these external scapegoats can
seem contradictory. Last year, the explanation at
tributed the increase to "the downturn in the econ
omy." This year's explanation turned to "inflation
ary pressures," which always accompany the noted
"improvement in the overall economy." This incon
sistency leaves students wondering about the extent
to which the economy or other outside factors truly
affect tuition increases.
The press releases also attempt to justify the in
creases by citing financial aid and need-blind ad
mission. This year's press release claimed that "we
are increasing financial aid faster than we are in
creasing tuition." This statement has the potential
to mislead students and their families. Since finan
cial aid is disbursed through grant money past a cer
tain level of need, the nature of the financial aid sys
tem guarantees that for each additional dollar
charged for tuition, more financial aid will be
awarded than for the previous dollar. So, as tuition
increases, financial aid will always increase as a
share of tuition.
Indeed, many students would be surprised to
learn exactly how little the University chooses to
pay from its own pockets for financial aid. The 2003-
2004 budget projects $55 million in Stanford-fund
ed scholarship aid. up from $52 million last year.
But most of that aid comes from restricted alumni

gifts and other funds — such as athletic scholar
ships — that are designated specifically for finan
cial aid. Only $16 million comes from the Universi
ty's general funds. This constitutes a 12 percent de
crease from $18 million in 1993-1994, even though
the tuition rate was substantially lower ten years
ago. If the University has chosen to spend less of its
own money on financial aid over the past ten years,
why does it increase tuition each year in the name of
financial aid?
General funds constitute 26 percent of the $2.34
billion budget that is not pre-designated fora spe
cific part of the University. Tuition, unrestricted
gifts and endowment income contribute to the gen
eral funds.
Even if the University brings its general funds
contribution to financial aid back to $18 million,
(the proposed increase has not been published), it
will be dwarfed by next year's increase from $192
million to $200 million in total undergraduate tu
ition . We estimate that room and board will add an
other $50 million to bring next year's total under
graduate fees to $250 million.
We applaud the university for spending 2.3 per
cent of its $674 million general funds on under
graduate financial aid. However, it is hardly over
whelming enough — or increasing fast enough —
to deserve a starring role in justifying each year's
annual tuition increase.
Tuition increases should be discussed candidly
and fairly. Students are concerned that next year's
tuition increase is nearly three times last year's infla
tion rate of 1.6 percent. In the past three years alone,
attendance costs have increased a total of 16 percent
while the average American income has risen just
three percent. Next year's freshmen can expect their
costs of attending Stanford to approach $180,000.
We believe that the education is worth the price.
We also recognize that factors not mentioned in the
press releases — such as a desire to increase our na
tional and international reputation at the fastest
possible rate, in comparison with other institutions
sharing the same goal — may contribute substan
tially to setting tuition rates. But we believe that all
parts of the decision should be accurately and com
pletely presented to the students who pay. Simply
disseminating a short press release designed to de
flect criticism is not acceptable.
