# THE
						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## The
						coming of the 'anti-Bush' 
### 
Playing the politics of "the
other" is dangerous. As we
seniors push against the
walls of the Stanford bubble
waiting to break out and find jobs,
we should keep this potential pitfall
in mind. After all. as we overhear
those who casually mention heading
to New York fora job with Gold
man Sachs or to Paris fora fellow
ship, the temptation creeps in to go
hunting for similar jobs. How about
Goldman Sachs in Paris? In the end,
though, this strategy of "follow the
leader" yields frustration instead of
employment.
Defining one's qualifications as
not being something or someone
can be equally fruitless. Unfortu
nately, the race for the democratic
presidential nomination has done
little to remind voters and candi
dates of this vital reality.
The race began with a surpris
ingly dominant campaign by for
mer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.
His popularity was sparked by an
unbridled hatred of President
George W. Bush and an ability to
articulate that anger in a way that
resonated with similarly angry
American Democrats. Being the
"anti-Bush" seemed a potent
enough fuel to motor Dean all the
way to the nomination.
But as time passed and Dean's
delegate-counts in the primaries
dropped, exit polls revealed that

Democrats voted according to who
had the best chance at beating Bush.
Dean? Too liberal. Lieberman?Too

old. Clark? Too
inexperienced.
Instead of dis
cussing policies,
candidates strug
gled to cast them
selves as "not too
liberal," "not too
old" and most of all,
"not too Bush."
This "what I'm not"

campaigning even
tually whittled the field down to a two
man race between the Senators John
Kerry and John Edwards in last Tues
day's Wisconsin primary. While Kerry's
staying power was expected, Edwards'
continued pursuit and second place
showings came as a surprise.
Edwards has often stressed that
he is the son of a mill worker and
that his humble origins in the South
have translated into a hard stance
against the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and
other free trade agreements that
cause off-shoring of American jobs.
He is the only candidate who has
campaigned on his personal story
and has presented definitive policy
ideas. This is the strategy that
brought him within striking distance
of the frontrunner — Kerry — in
Wisconsin.
But Wisconsin allows everyone

to vote in its primary, not just
Democrats. While Kerry won big
with those voting on "electability"
and "anti-Bush" criteria, it was Ed
wards who almost caught up by
reaching Republicans and indepen
dents voting on policy issues.
Luckily for Kerry, Wisconsin is
unique because no other large states
have open primaries, and Kerry
should be able to carry the "anti-
Bush" vote through to the nomina
tion. Unluckily for Kerry, the suc
cess of Edwards with non-
Democrats and Democrats alike
sends a strong message: There
aren't enough angry Democrats to
go around. A successful presidential
campaign will depend upon a candi
date's ability to present himself not
simply as an "answer" to Bush, but
as a true alternative.
At their foundation, job markets
are the same for presidents and
freshmen looking for summer work.
You can't get what you want by not
being something. The catch to prop
ping yourself up against something
you despise is that if you succeed in
knocking it down, you fall over. And
as the current President's father fa
mously reminded us, "That
wouldn't be prudent."
