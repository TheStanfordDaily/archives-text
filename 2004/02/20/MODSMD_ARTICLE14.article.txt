# OP-ED
## Wake up. AIDS: It's still here 
### MEKLIT WORKNEH 
It was 11 a.m. on a Saturday
morning and I was in the pro
cess of distributing the ques
tionnaires 1 had created for my
study on HIV / AIDS, youth and
media in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
The room was a dark one in the
back of the neighborhood district
administrative office — an office
that doubled as a meeting and gath
ering area for the neighborhood
anti-AIDS youth club. The leaders
of this particular anti-AIDS club
had arranged for me to include
some of its members as part of my
study. As I finished distributing my
questionnaires and sat down to wait
for the study participants to fill
them out, one of the leaders of the
anti-AIDS club struck up a conver
sation about HIV/AIDS in the
United States.
During the conversation, I real
ized how little I knew about the sta
tus of the epidemic in the United
States. Like many other people
originally from outside the United
States — and this may be true fora
large group of people from the
United States as well — I did not
perceive HIV/AIDS as a large
problem here or in other Western
nations. While the epidemic's initial
breakout in the 1980s and early
1990s garnered extensive media at
tention, there now seems to be a lot
of silence and ignorance here in the

United States surrounding the
issue. It was not too surprising,
therefore, that this particular young
man — who is my age and is very in
volved in the fight against the epi
demic in Ethiopia — was under the
illusion that there is no HIV/AIDS
problem in the United States. I was
quick to tell him that although the
rates of infection and prevalence
are much lower in the United States
than in most sub-Saharan African
nations, the problem still very much
exists in the United States.
I did not realize how large this
problem was in the United States
until very recently. Two incidents
that occurred over the past couple
of days led me to write this op- ed.
The first was a program held two
nights ago entitled "Sex and the
City: The Real View, HIV/AIDS in
the Black Community." The second
was the reading that I actually did
(yes. I know how many of us Stan
ford students skirt around our class
es' readings) for "Social Class, Race
/ Ethnicity, and Health." In an arti
cle entitled "Minority Health Status
in Adulthood: The Middle Years,"
the authors discuss excess mortality
in racial and ethnic minorities as
compared to white persons. The ar
ticle looks at causes of death for
people between 21 and 64 years of
age and states that "46 percent of
deaths among black adults could be
considered excess deaths."
What was more surprising to me

— although I knew that HIV/AIDS
prevalence in the United States was
greater among minority groups
than among whites — was that HIV
mortality rates were 7.5 times
greater for black persons between
the ages of 15 and 24 than for whites
in the same age bracket. The mor
tality rate for Hispanics was twice as
high as that of whites.
This is unacceptable in a country
that is seen by the outside world as
having dealt with the HIV/AIDS
problem effectively. Policymakers'
concern about the HIV/AIDS epi
demic has shifted to sub-Saharan
Africa and other parts of the devel
oping world. And although this at
tention has been late in coming and
is very much needed given the dev
astation the epidemic is wreaking in
these parts of the world — the
problems in one's own backyard
should never be forgotten. Al
though international opinions
about the United States have in
creased in negativity over the past
few years, the world does still look
to countries like the United States
to set an example on frontiers such
as the battle against HIV/AIDS. In
order to effectively set this example
and wipe out this epidemic on a
world-wide level, the plights of peo
ple everywhere should and need to
be addressed.

in the same age bracket. The mor
tality rate for Hispanics was twice as
high as that of whites.
This is unacceptable in a country
that is seen by the outside world as
having dealt with the HIV/AIDS
problem effectively. Policymakers'
concern about the HIV/AIDS epi
demic has shifted to sub-Saharan
Africa and other parts of the devel
oping world. And although this at
tention has been late in coming and
is very much needed given the dev
astation the epidemic is wreaking in
these parts of the world — the
problems in one's own backyard
should never be forgotten. Al
though international opinions
about the United States have in
creased in negativity over the past
few years, the world does still look
to countries like the United States
to set an example on frontiers such
as the battle against HIV/AIDS. In
order to effectively set this example
and wipe out this epidemic on a
world-wide level, the plights of peo
ple everywhere should and need to
be addressed.
