Same-sex marriages do not violate
state constitution
Will O'Neill's letter to the editor
("Same-sex marriages in San Francisco vio
late state's constitution," Feb. 19) postulates
the question, "What is the point of voting if
one man [Mayor Gavin Newsom] can sub
vert a majority?" O'Neill seems to forget
that the citizens of California have adopted
a constitution with protections such as the
equal protection clause: "A person may not
be ... denied equal protection of the laws."
To argue that a single piece of legisla
tion, even if adopted by a large majority of
the population, is forever binding — inde
pendent of its implications for the liberty of
all citizens — is ludicrous. Such an argu
ment seemingly legitimizes Jim Crow laws,
laws that banned interracial marriage and
various other laws that contemporaneous

non-compliance of would also have ap
peared to "subvert a majority."

In response to Will O'Neill's letter to the
editor regarding same-sex marriage
("Same-sex marriages in San Francisco vio
late state's constitution," Feb. 19), I suggest
that the writer check his facts before letting
his emotions get in the way. Mayor Gavin
Newsom's decision to issue same-sex mar
riage certificates is not a violation of the
state constitution.
Proposition 22 was not a constitutional
amendment, but merely an amendment to
the state's Family Code, as evidenced by the
ballot phrasing: "Adds a provision to the
Family Code providing that only marriage
between a man and a woman is valid or rec

ognized in California."
Newsom is acting correctly by challeng
ing a law that, in fact, violates the California
State Constitution.

Will O'Neill brings up a good point in his
letter to the editor ("Same-sex marriages in
San Francisco violate state's constitution,"
Feb. 19), in which he criticizes San Francis
co Mayor Gavin Newsom's order to dis
tribute marriage licenses to same-sex cou
ples. The order does, in fact, run counter to
Proposition 22 — a statute that defines
marriage as a pact between a man and a
woman. I would point out, however, that in
the past, similar "overwhelmingly passed"
statutes prevented large segments of the
population from enjoying the rights and

privileges afforded to citizens in the U.S.
Constitution. Where would we be today if
no one had had the courage to stand up to
the Jim Crow laws of the 1950s and 19605?
What Newsom has done is given hope to
same-sex couples that merely wish for the
freedoms heterosexual couples enjoy. New
som's order has given a human face to the
issue, provoked public debate and high
lighted the hypocrisy of our current system.
I hold the city of San Francisco and New
som in the highest respect, and I applaud
him for his actions, even if they do run
counter to Proposition 22.

The Stanford Daily's editorial oversight
on Will O'Neill's letter (Feb. 19) on same
sex marriage was poor. It is factually incor

rect to say that "Same-sex marriages in San
Francisco violate [thej state's constitution,"
as the letter's title states.
Not all amendments were created equal.
Proposition 22 was not an amendment to
the California State Constitution but an
amendment to the state's Family Code,
adding section 308.5, which stated that
"Only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in California."
Newsom is not challenging the Califor
nia State Constitution, which contains
equal protection clauses similar to those in
Massachusetts. He is challenging a more re
cent amendment to California law that may
or may not be constitutional.
It is the place of the courts to exert over
sight over the constitutionality of laws
passed by legislatures and the populace.
