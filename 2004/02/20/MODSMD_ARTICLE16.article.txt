# Julie issues a challenge: Keep it simple
## 
### 
Rome Olympics, 1960. Abebe Biki
la, former shepherd and Imperial
Guardsman from Ethiopia, shat
ters the Olympic marathon record
by almost eight minutes. To add to the in
trigue, he sheds only 3/4 pound of water
weight during the race, while most people
lose nine.
Oh yeah, and the dude's barefoot.
Purist runners will tell you that running is
the simplest of sports. All you need is a pair of
shoes. No pool, no hoop, no bat â€” just your
self. Bikila didn't even need the shoes.
Too bad no one enjoys the simple things
anymore. My running shoes were specifically
matched to my feet with gauges for average
workout length, running surface, stability,
width, cushioning, pronation, my weight and
the shoe's weight. And I swear to you that I
can only run in the GRID-Jazz line of

Saucony shoes. I won't even
walk in them; it's bad for the
support.
Junior high regression:
seventh grade. I am a total
dork who's really into run
ning. I even have prescrip
tion sunglasses for practice.
The mean fat bully Ariel (I
know, it doesn't make
sense) chucks my new
Sauconys over the fence

into the hushes, right when the sprinklers go
on. That's okay, he (yes, he) went on to play
football at community college and I will soon
be an unemployed Stanford graduate with a
B.A. in anthropology.
I'm not even the worst of the group.
You've all seen it, because Stanford is a
hotspot of overaccessorized dorky runners
(so is Silicon Valley in general): reflective
night vests, Coolmesh running hats, chest
band pulse monitors, waist-band water
packs, special-ventilation ankle socks, iPods.
Not to mention electrolyte-replacement
drinks and Cliff bars. You can even purchase
a conveyer-belt machine so you can run in
place and bore yourself into dehydrated de
pression. It's called a treadmill.
Add this all up and not only is it expensive,
it's also completely and utterly unnecessary.
But at least all the superfluous accessory pro
duction is "good for the economy" or gives us
"freedom of choice" when choosing between
ankle socks. Useless, I tell you!
Other sports where someone is making a
pot of gold off specialty accessory items:
baseball. Helmets, special batting gloves,
special pants, special cleats, special bats, bat
bags, that black stuff for under your eyes,
cups, special tobacco.
Competitive Latin ballroom dancing: spe
cial fishnets, nude seamless underwear, flexi
ble leather-sole shoes and coloring to dye
them, scraper brush and special oil to get bet
ter traction, fake eyelashes, three kinds of
foundation, fake tanner (guys too), hair
spray. a tall partner.
Not to say you don't need a lot of this stuff,
just to say it's a lot of stuff.
So running barefoot must be the bottom
line, the simplest thing. This guy I met in
Brazil disagreed and argued that soccer is.
It's the international people's sport, and if
you get down to it. you can kick anything
around in an open space.
Note to soccer moms: This means you
don't need the Escalade and Sunny Delight,
and your suburbanite children will still turn
out okay. Not like I care.
Stanford grad students: You don't really
need the rotating flashing bike helmet. My
friend got in a bike accident this week and
broke her face (literally) and her eye almost
caved in, but helmets don't protect your face
now, do they?
Male runners: You don't need the chest
band pulse monitor. It is incredibly lame. So
are Palm Pilots. Plus, you can just take your
pulse the old-fashioned way.
Same with electronic toothbrushes. In
credibly lame.
I saw a guy running in Manhattan at 11
p.m. on Valentine's Day. Obviously a lonely
college student. He should transfer to Stan
ford. But the guy had on a T-shirt and shorts,
when everyone else was dressed head to toe
in earmuffs, beanies, scarves, jackets and
gloves. I am not quite sure how his skin did
not freeze off his body in fleshy sheets, but I
also find Abebe Bikila's whole run-26-and-a
-quarter-miles-barefoot-at-five-minutes-a-mile
mile deal pretty unbelievable.
Ways to simplify: Run around naked at
Columbae. Play the original Atari down in
the library. Take your vodka straight, with no
chaser (fewer calories, which is great if you're
trying to starve yourself). Or, take tap water
shots and support Stanford's "No Booze. No
Fun" initiative.
Keep it simple.

Julie has been disappointed by the lack of out
rage her recent columns have generated. So,
please, e-mail her at julieolo@stanford.edu
and tell her in no uncertain terms just how im
portant that chest-band pulse monitor is to
you. Thanks.
