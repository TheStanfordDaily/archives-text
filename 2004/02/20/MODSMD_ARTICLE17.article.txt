## Childress leads Cardinal to 22-0 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES, Calif. — On a night when the majori
ty of his teammates seemed helpless offensively against
Southern California, junior swingman Josh Childress was
simply spectacular — smooth, emotionally poised and ab
solutely unstoppable.
In front of a nowhere-near-capacity crowd at the Los
Angeles Sports Arena that applauded for top-ranked Stan
ford as it was introduced, Childress scored 36 points,
grabbed 11 rebounds and carried the Cardinal through a
dismal first half in which it shot 34.5 percent from the field,
2-for-10 from behind the 3-point arc and trailed by eight
points heading into the locker room at the half.
Despite its first half scoring woes, the Cardinal (22-0,13-
0 Pacific-10 Conference) escaped the Arena with a 76-67
win over the Trojans (10-13,5-9).
With the win, Stanford clinched a share of the Pac-10
title and extended its school-record winning streak to 22
consecutive wins and remained only one of two unbeaten
teams left in the country along with No. 2 St. Joseph's.
"We had a lot of incentive to come here and win," said
senior shooting guard Matt Lottich, who finished with 20
points (18 of which came in the second half) and was the
only other Cardinal to score in double figures. "We've been
playing all season fora Pac-10 Championship."
In the first half, USC jumped out to an 18-7 lead, after
scoring nine unanswered points during a two-minute
stretch during which senior shooting guard Desmon
Farmer hit two 3-pointers. With 9:56 remaining in the
first half, however, and the Trojans leading 20-11,
Farmer waswhistled for his third foul (all havingcome in
the previous two minutes) while driving to the basket.
Before being forced to the bench, Farmer had scored 11
points on 4-of-7 shooting from the field and 3-of-4 shoot
ing from downtown.
With USC's main offensive threat on the bench, the
Cardinal scored eight unanswered points. Trojan head
coach Henry Bibby was whistled fora technical foul during
a USC timeout after Childress hit a tough pull-up jumper in
the lane. Lottich converted both free throws bringing the
Cardinal within one-point, 20-19. However, Stanford then
went cold and didn't score a single field goal during an ugly
five-minute stretch, while the Trojans extended their lead
to 12 points — USC's largest lead of the game.
"I just don't think we were really aggressive [in the first
half]," said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery. "Chil
dress kept us in the [game]."

Interestingly enough, the Cardi
nal, a team that is known for its bal
anced scoring attack, didn't look all
that steady. Childress scored 18 of
Stanford's 28 first half points, keeping
the Cardinal within striking distance
by scoring on slashing layups and
crowd-silencing jumpers.
Essentially, Childress was at his of
fensive best in the first half, while his
teammates couldn't find the bottom
of the basket with a map.
Stanford jogged into the locker
room at the break down by eight
points, the score frozen at 36-28.
And then, just like that, USC
fell apart.
Just as effortlessly as the Trojans
had extended their first-half lead,
they imploded during a four-minute
second-half stretch and the Cardinal
went on a 12-4 run to reclaim the lead,
43-40, on a Lottich trey.
Stanford extended its lead to six
when Childress scored on a tough
spinning layup in traffic.
But outside of those two plays
(and a wide-open one-handed slam
by junior center Rob Little before
Lottich's three, tying the game at 40-
40) there was nothing especially spec
tacular about Stanford's comeback
run.
The Trojans turned the ball over
two times. Farmer missed a couple of
shots and USC just didn't get back on
defense as the Cardinal scored on
fastbreak layup after layup.
"The 1-3 zone caused some
turnovers and they just didn't get
back," Montgomery explained. "That
led to a few easy baskets."
"That wasn't us at our best, but we
fought," he continued. "We battled.
It's a great game when you can come

here and not be on the top of your game and still win."
Despite the Stanford surge, the Trojans battled back,
tying the game at 65-65 with 3:21 remaining.
But then sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez

on Stanford's next possession Childress took his man to the
basket and converted a layup. extending the Cardinal's
