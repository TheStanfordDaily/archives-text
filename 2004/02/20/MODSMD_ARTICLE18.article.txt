# Baseball to face undefeated Longhorns
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
At this point in the season, most college baseball
teams are trying to set lineups, integrate newcomers
and take one game at a time. But perennial power
houses like Stanford and Texas are already thinking
ahead, working their way toward a place that they've
been many times before — the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
So when the No. 4 Cardinal (8-1) and the No. 6
Longhorns (10-0) clash this weekend in their annual se
ries, it will be easy to call it a rivalry.
Easy, but hardly accurate.
There is no animosity between these teams and de
spite the fact that Texas has eliminated Stanford from
post-season play in the past, there is no overwhelming
desire for revenge.
In fact, both teams say that the main battle this week
end won't be against each other. The main battle will be
against themselves, as the squads try to figure out if they

have what it takes to make it back to Omaha.
"What (Stanford head coach Mark Marquess] and I
are trying to do is evaluate our teams and see if they are
playing at that championship level," said Texas head
coach Augie Garrido. "The Stanford team is playing at
the championship level day-in, day-out and year-in,
year-out, and [playing them] helps us."
Garrido — the winningest coach in Division I base
ball history — and Marquess have been friends for near
ly 30 years and when Garrido built Cal State-Fullerton
into a national baseball power years ago, the two coach
es began a series between the two schools. So it only
made sense that when Garrido took over the Texas pro
gram seven years ago, Stanford and Texas started an an
nual series — one in which Stanford holds a 15-12-1 ad
vantage. Stanford took last year's series in Austin, two
games to one.
"What we try to do outside of league is play the best
[teams]," Marquess said. "[Texas] is very well coached.
They're always in post-season play. It's good competi
tion and it's a gage for where we are."

Stanford has settled on number one and two starters
in time for the Texas series. Sophomore lefty Mark Ro
manczuk (2-1,3.12 ERA) will be the Friday night starter
and sophomore Jeff Gilmore (2-0, 2.00) will take the
mound on Saturday. Sunday's starter has yet to be de
termined, as Marquess intends to use whoever he needs
to win out of the bullpen in the first two contests, rather
than save a specific pitcher for Sunday.
Texas, on the other hand, has a much more concrete
rotation, which gives the undefeated Longhorns a strong
advantage, according to Marquess. The squad will start
three proven starters: lefties J.P. Howell and Justin Sim
mons and righthander Sam LeCure.
But the real Texas ace stays in the bullpen until late in
the game. Junior closer Huston Street, who is already the
Longhorn's all-time leader in saves, played the past two
summers on the Team USA squad with Romanczuk, ju
nior Danny Putnam and senior Sam Fuld.
Though Marquess said that the games will very like-
ly come down to pitching and defense, Texas and
Stanford have had very similar offenses so far
this season. Of the players that have started eight
games or more, both teams have six that are bat
ting above .300. Sophomore Jed Lowrie leads the
Cardinal with a .429 average, while junior Curtis
Thigpen paces the Longhorns at .447. Both are
the only players on their squads batting above
the .400 mark.
Texas and Stanford have yet another thing in
common — both are coming off of big wins.
The Longhorns notched a 6-3 win over de
fending national champion Rice last week,
while Stanford mounted a ninth-inning come
back to sweep Kansas on Sunday. And at least
for the Cardinal, that could be a factor in the
weekend's series.
"We were talking about it before the game
[against Kansas on Sunday]," senior Brian Hall
said. "We were saying, 'Let's win this one and get
some momentum for Texas.' It was definitely on
our minds before the game."
Of course, with these two teams, which have a
history of close games between them, nothing is
certain for the weekend.
"The thing about baseball is that for every ac
tion, there's a reaction," Garrido said. "And the
best way to see that is to wait till the game and see
what happens. This is going to be two teams play
ing great baseball."
The first pitch of the series is set for 6 p.m. on
Friday at Sunken Diamond. Gametime will be 1
p.m. for the Saturday and Sunday contests.

while Stanford mounted a ninth-inning come
back to sweep Kansas on Sunday. And at least
for the Cardinal, that could be a factor in the
weekend's series.
"We were talking about it before the game
[against Kansas on Sunday]," senior Brian Hall
said. "We were saying, 'Let's win this one and get
some momentum for Texas.' It was definitely on
our minds before the game."
Of course, with these two teams, which have a
history of close games between them, nothing is
certain for the weekend.
"The thing about baseball is that for every ac
tion, there's a reaction," Garrido said. "And the
best way to see that is to wait till the game and see
what happens. This is going to be two teams play
ing great baseball."
The first pitch of the series is set for 6 p.m. on
Friday at Sunken Diamond. Gametime will be 1
p.m. for the Saturday and Sunday contests.
At this point in the season, most college baseball
teams are trying to set lineups, integrate newcomers
and take one game at a time. But perennial power
houses like Stanford and Texas are already thinking
ahead, working their way toward a place that they've
been many times before — the College World Series in
Omaha, Neb.
So when the No. 4 Cardinal (8-1) and the No. 6
Longhorns (10-0) clash this weekend in their annual se
ries, it will be easy to call it a rivalry.
Easy, but hardly accurate.
There is no animosity between these teams and de
spite the fact that Texas has eliminated Stanford from
post-season play in the past, there is no overwhelming
desire for revenge.
In fact, both teams say that the main battle this week
end won't be against each other. The main battle will be
against themselves, as the squads try to figure out if they

have what it takes to make it back to Omaha.
"What (Stanford head coach Mark Marquess] and I
are trying to do is evaluate our teams and see if they are
playing at that championship level," said Texas head
coach Augie Garrido. "The Stanford team is playing at
the championship level day-in, day-out and year-in,
year-out, and [playing them] helps us."
Garrido — the winningest coach in Division I base
ball history — and Marquess have been friends for near
ly 30 years and when Garrido built Cal State-Fullerton
into a national baseball power years ago, the two coach
es began a series between the two schools. So it only
made sense that when Garrido took over the Texas pro
gram seven years ago, Stanford and Texas started an an
nual series — one in which Stanford holds a 15-12-1 ad
vantage. Stanford took last year's series in Austin, two
games to one.
"What we try to do outside of league is play the best
[teams]," Marquess said. "[Texas] is very well coached.
They're always in post-season play. It's good competi
tion and it's a gage for where we are."

Stanford has settled on number one and two starters
in time for the Texas series. Sophomore lefty Mark Ro
manczuk (2-1,3.12 ERA) will be the Friday night starter
and sophomore Jeff Gilmore (2-0, 2.00) will take the
mound on Saturday. Sunday's starter has yet to be de
termined, as Marquess intends to use whoever he needs
to win out of the bullpen in the first two contests, rather
than save a specific pitcher for Sunday.
Texas, on the other hand, has a much more concrete
rotation, which gives the undefeated Longhorns a strong
advantage, according to Marquess. The squad will start
three proven starters: lefties J.P. Howell and Justin Sim
mons and righthander Sam LeCure.
But the real Texas ace stays in the bullpen until late in
the game. Junior closer Huston Street, who is already the
Longhorn's all-time leader in saves, played the past two
summers on the Team USA squad with Romanczuk, ju
nior Danny Putnam and senior Sam Fuld.
Though Marquess said that the games will very like-
ly come down to pitching and defense, Texas and
Stanford have had very similar offenses so far
this season. Of the players that have started eight
games or more, both teams have six that are bat
ting above .300. Sophomore Jed Lowrie leads the
Cardinal with a .429 average, while junior Curtis
Thigpen paces the Longhorns at .447. Both are
the only players on their squads batting above
the .400 mark.
Texas and Stanford have yet another thing in
common — both are coming off of big wins.
The Longhorns notched a 6-3 win over de
fending national champion Rice last week,
while Stanford mounted a ninth-inning come
back to sweep Kansas on Sunday. And at least
for the Cardinal, that could be a factor in the
weekend's series.
