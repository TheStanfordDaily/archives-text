# Women trounce Trojans at home

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For Ihe No. 10 Stanford women's basketball team (19-5,12-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference), last night's game against Southern California (14-10,11-5) meant ev
erything. With USC just a half-game back in the conference standings, first place
was up for grabs. And after three straight lackluster performances, the season's
momentum was hanging in the balance.
So the Cardinal did exactly what a top-10 team should do —it went out and
dominated the Trojans, coming away with a 75-57 victory.
From the moment the two teams took the floor, it was evident the game
would be much different from the teams' first meeting at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena. Stanford came out with an energy and confidence that had been missing
from its play in recent weeks, and went on an 8-0 run to start the game.
"I think the slow start killed us," said USC head coach Chris Gobrecht. "It
gave them a dose of confidence that we didn't need them to have. They're a
much different team when they play with confidence."
However, the Cardinal would still have to weather several Trojan runs.
After Stanford's strong start. USC pulled to within one point at 8-7, but se
nior forward Nicole Powell responded by hitting a 3-pointer to start a seven
minute, 13-4 run.
1 he Cardinal did exactly what it had been wanting to do for weeks on offense
— feed the ball to post players for easy layups.
Azella Perryman led the way for Stanford's post, finishing with 17 points on
8-of-9 shooting while also pulling down eight rebounds.
"This was possibly Azella's best game ever at Stanford," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
That type of praise is almost unheard of from the tough-to-please Van-
Derveer, but Perryman was all over the place for the Cardinal.
When USC made a 7-0 run to start the second half and pulled within just six
points, it was Perryman who hit a layup to stop the bleeding. And after Gobrecht

January. Though Stanford dropped that game, it came roaring back last night to burn USC 75-57 at
Maples Pavilion. Suminski was one of three Cardinal women to post double-digit points, in a contest
highlighted by the revival of the team's low-post game.
