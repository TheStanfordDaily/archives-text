# Women trounce Trojans at home

### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For Ihe No. 10 Stanford women's basketball team (19-5,12-3 Pacific-10 Con
ference), last night's game against Southern California (14-10,11-5) meant ev
erything. With USC just a half-game back in the conference standings, first place
was up for grabs. And after three straight lackluster performances, the season's
momentum was hanging in the balance.
So the Cardinal did exactly what a top-10 team should do —it went out and
dominated the Trojans, coming away with a 75-57 victory.
From the moment the two teams took the floor, it was evident the game
would be much different from the teams' first meeting at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena. Stanford came out with an energy and confidence that had been missing
from its play in recent weeks, and went on an 8-0 run to start the game.
"I think the slow start killed us," said USC head coach Chris Gobrecht. "It
gave them a dose of confidence that we didn't need them to have. They're a
much different team when they play with confidence."
However, the Cardinal would still have to weather several Trojan runs.
After Stanford's strong start. USC pulled to within one point at 8-7, but se
nior forward Nicole Powell responded by hitting a 3-pointer to start a seven
minute, 13-4 run.
1 he Cardinal did exactly what it had been wanting to do for weeks on offense
— feed the ball to post players for easy layups.
Azella Perryman led the way for Stanford's post, finishing with 17 points on
8-of-9 shooting while also pulling down eight rebounds.
"This was possibly Azella's best game ever at Stanford," said Stanford head
coach Tara VanDerveer.
That type of praise is almost unheard of from the tough-to-please Van-
Derveer, but Perryman was all over the place for the Cardinal.
When USC made a 7-0 run to start the second half and pulled within just six
points, it was Perryman who hit a layup to stop the bleeding. And after Gobrecht

Junior guard Kelley Suminski drives past a USC opponent in the Cardinal's faceoff with tfie Trojans in
January. Though Stanford dropped that game, it came roaring back last night to burn USC 75-57 at

highlighted by the revival of the team's low-post game.
was whistled fora technical foul with the Cardinal up by just seven,
Perryman played a major part in the Cardinal's ensuing 13-1 run.
"Our guards did an awesome job getting the ball into the post,"
Perryman said. "We've been practicing it all week and we execut
ed well."
Stanford also got a lift down low from the return of freshman
Kristen Newlin, who had missed four games with a bone bruise
to her right knee. Newlin tallied nine points, three boards and
two blocks.
Newlin's presence proved especially key as junior forward

T'Nae Thiel — who was coming off an outstanding 16-point per
formance in last week's victory over Cal — got into quick foul
trouble and was limited to just 11 minutes of playing time.
While Newlin's offense was a little rusty when she first
stepped on the floor, she soon settled in, and after a particular
ly impressive layup in traffic, it was evident that she was back at
full force.
"It was great [to be back]," Newlin said. "I just love playing
basketball, so anytime I can be on the court, actually in uniform,
it's great."
Newlin's positive attitude and energy was certainly felt by the
entire squad, as the victory was a true team effort.
The matchup featured two of the biggest stars in the Pac-10,
Powell and senior forward Ebony Hoffman, but the contest was ul

timately decided by the play of the two seniors' supporting casts.
Along with the strong play of Newlin and Perryman, junior
guard Kelley Suminski poured in 16 points on 3-of-3 shooting
from 3-point range and 7-of-8 shooting from the charity stripe. Ju
nior guard Susan Borchardt also pitched in with eight points and
five assists.
Hoffman, who finished with 13 points and just three rebounds,
got little help from her teammates, as only one other Trojan fin
ished in double figures — sophomore forward Meghan Gnekow,
who led USC in both points (15) and rebounds (five).
Last night's victory will certainly be key in providing the Cardi
nal with momentum for Saturday's matchup with UCLA. The
Bruins are currently the hottest team in the Pac-10, riding a six
game win streak.
