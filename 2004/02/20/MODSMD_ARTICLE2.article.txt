# Fac Sen addresses costly journals
## 
### RYAN SANDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In response to the damaging effect of rising
serial costs on campus budgets, the Faculty
Senate passed guidelines yesterday for Stan
ford libraries, faculty and departments regard
ing academic journals.
There were four guidelines approved re
garding the budget strains on the libraries. The
first guideline encouraged faculty and libraries
to support affordable scholarly journals by vol
unteering articles and labor in the production,
review and editing of publications.
The second recommended that libraries
refuse bundled subscription plans. In these
plans, small journal subscriptions are only of
fered in a package with larger, more expensive
ones. These plans limit the library's ability to
make decisions on a title-by-title basis and
often inflate subscription costs.
The third guideline encouraged Stanford li
braries to scrutinize the pricing of journals and
to discontinue subscriptions of disproportion
ately expensive serials. This guideline specifi
cally singled out publisher Elsevier. In recent

months, Elsevier has been criticized by other
schools such as the University of California,
Harvard University and Duke University,
which have passed similar guidelines and acad
emic journal restrictions.
The fourth guideline "strongly asked" fac
ulty not to contribute articles or editorial ef
forts to publishers and journals that engaged in
exploitive pricing, but to look to other, more
reasonably priced venues for disseminating
their research.
The "serial crisis" motion, which was also
discussed at the previous Faculty Senate meet
ing, was met with little debate. Graduate
School of Business Prof. Joanne Martin, who
cast the one opposing vote to the motion, of
fered her concern over the adoption of guide
lines could cut leading journals based solely on
higher costs.
According to Martin, she and other faculty
in her department feel that it could be harmful
to staff and students alike if top-tier academic
journal subscriptions were cut.
"Despite their costs, we need the top-tiered
journals to keep up in our field," she said.
The Faculty Senate was also presented

with the Annual Report of the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial
Aid by Psychology Prof. Hazel Markus. With
in this report. Markus discussed the current
status of the President's Scholar Program at
Stanford.
The program, founded in 1995, is used to
encourage the top 200 students identified in
each year's admitted class to attend Stanford.
The awards often include a grant for the stu
dents to pursue undergraduate research and a
more favorable financial-aid package.
In recent years, the President's Scholar Pro
gram has come under fire fora variety of rea
sons from faculty and students who claim it
creates an elite group of students. The award
has also been criticized for not having a strong
effect on admitted students' decision to ma
triculate.
This year, according to Martin, the admis
sion office did not give out the Scholar Pro
gram. but instead set up a "shadow program"
that kept internal records of admitted students
of the Class of 2007 who would have been
given the award. The admission
office then followed the enroll
ment choices of these 200 stu
dents in order to determine if the
President's Award did in fact af
fect students' decisions to attend
Stanford.
Currently, the program has
concluded that the Scholar Pro
gram has little effect on students'
college choice. The designated
200 students matriculted at a rate
of 46 percent. This compares to
the rates of 45 percent and 45.5
percent for the classes of 2006 and
2005, respectively, when the Pres
ident's Scholar Program was actu
ally administered.
According to Martin, the pro
gram will continue into next year
in order to further study the mer
its of the Scholar Program. The
program's future at Stanford will
be decided based on the results of
this study.
