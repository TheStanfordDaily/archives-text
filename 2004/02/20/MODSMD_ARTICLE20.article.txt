# Softball hopes to extend winning streak at Palm Springs tourney
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
The No. 8 Caidinal soltball team (8-1) will head south this weekend
to ti y to extend its seven-game win streak at the Palm Springs Classic in
Palm Springs, Calif. Stanford will play five games at the tournament,
matching up against Noithwestern, Coastal Carolina, Notre Dame and
Penn State in regular-season games and the U.S. National Team in an
exhibition game.
The Cardinal starts things otf against No. 29 Northwestern on Friday
at 3.30 p.m. Northwestei n comes into this weekend with a 4-1 record in
cluding two wins against Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference rival, Ari
zona State. 1 he Cardinal has played Northwestern only once before a
1-0 victory in 1999.
Friday's nightcap is an exhibition game against the U.S. National
I earn, which includes former Cardinal Jessica Mendoza, a four-time
All-American during her tenure here.
Stanford head coach John Rittman has his own personal connec
tion to the National Team, having coached the squad in tournaments
including the 2002 World Championships. In addition. Rittman will
help coach the 2004 U.S. Olympic squad, on which Mendoza is an
outfielder and sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin is an alternate.
Saturday will mark a return to regular season action as the Cardinal
takes on No. 26 Notre Dame at 1 p.m. and then matches up against
Coastal Carolina at 3:30 p.m. Notre Dame brings a 4-1 record into this
weekend and has never before played the Cardinal.
C oastal C arolina is 2-1 on the season, with both wins posted by ace
pitcher Christina Doyle (2-0,0.00 ERA). Coastal Carolina and the Car
dinal met last year, a game that the Stanford won in a 7-1 rout.
The Cardinal will wrap up the Classic on Sunday morning against
Penn State, which, coming into this weekend, has yet to play this season.

The Nittany Lions have become a frequent victim of the Cardinal over
the last few years, as the all-time series stands at 4-0 in Stanford's favor.
All of those victories were recorded since 2001, including a 6-0 win for
the Cardinal last year.
While the Cardinal has four quality opponents this weekend in Palm
Springs — five if one includes the U.S. National exhibition game —
hopes are high for the Stanford squad.
Ace pitcher Dana Sorensen (4-1, 0.28 ERA) has 31 strikeouts and re
cently moved up to 10th all-time in the Pac-10 in career strikeouts.
Sorensen already holds Stanford records for career wins and strikeouts.
Freshman reliever Danika Dukes has looked sharp in recent appear
ances, and sophomore Laura Severson pitched well last weekend at the
Stanford Invitational.
While the Cardinal pitchers have been outstanding, the hitters have
shown phenomenal depth this year, getting solid contributions up and
down the lineup.
Sophomores Catalina Morris and Lappin, both All-Pac-10 selections
last year as true freshmen, have wielded the same big bats thus far and
Lappin's grit last weekend in the face of a ghastly facial injury proved a
rallying point for the Cardinal.
Freshman Jackie Rinehart has been a revelation at the leadoff spot,
setting the table for Morris. Lappin and senior catcher Jessica Allister,
who belted two home runs in one game last weekend. The rest of the
lineup has been more than solid, with junior outfielders Meghan Sickler
and Katherine Hoffman and junior third baseman Liz Bendig coming
through with big hits in key situations.
Overall, the outlook is bright for the Cardinal this weekend in the
Palm Desert. If it can continue to deliver big plays on both sides of the
plate, Stanford could see its winning streak pushed well beyond seven
going into next weekend's Arizona Tournament in Tucson.
