# Men travel to take on BYU
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
When the No. 11 Stanford men's volleyball team (5-9,3-7 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) travels to Utah this weekend to take
on No. 4 Brigham Young (7-3, 5-1), it will be at least a little con
cerned with the air up there.
Believe it or not, the higher altitude in Utah actually does matter.
"The air's thinner. It might affect you a little bit in recovery time
after long rallies," said head coach Don Shaw. "And the ball does
sail a little bit in the higher altitude. It's not something we're going
to dwell on."
The Cardinal definitely has more important things on its
mind. Stanford will be facing an opponent that has just about as
many consecutive wins under its belt as the Cardinal has con
secutive losses.
The Cougars, coming off two back-to-back three-game wins
against Pacific on Feb. 6 and 7, have stretched their win streak to
six. Stanford played a pair of back-to-back matchups last week
end, but fell in three games each to Hawaii, notching its fourth
and fifth consecutive losses.
"We want to break out of this funk," said junior outside hitter
David Vogel, who was held to just 10 kills by the Warriors last week
end. "We definitely have the potential, we just want to reach that."
BYU coach Tom Peterson agreed that the Cardinal was a team
to watch.
"Stanford is a good team," he said. "We have to win these match
es at home to stay competitive in the conference."
The Cougars are certainly a good team, too. Against Pacific
last Saturday, All-American senior outside / opposite hitter
Jonathan Alleman notched 11 kills and just two errors, while four
BYU players recorded eight kills apiece against Pacific. The
match lasted just an hour and a half.

Cardinal practice this week has consisted of organizing a solid
defense that will be ready to take on the Cougar attack.
"They run some interesting plays, so we've been mimicking
those plays and practicing against them," Vogel said at practice
on Tuesday.
Though Stanford's numbers haven't been impressive—junior
middle blocker Craig Buell led his team with just six kills last Satur
day — the Cardinal seems poised to focus on the present.
"We've put the past behind us," Shaw said. "We haven't even
worried about that."
The mission now, he explained, is reducing Cardinal hitting er
rors, re-energizing and preparing for the Cougars, a team that's a lit
tle different from the rest.
At a predominantly Mormon school, many Cougar volleyball
players tend to redshirt to go on their missions, returning to play at
a significantly older age.
"They come back as 21- or 22-year-old redshirt freshmen," Shaw
said. "Then the international players they bring in have a lot of ex
perience [too]."
But an older, experienced team isn't daunting to the Cardinal
men. And neither is the losing streak at their backs. Instead, sopho
more outside hitter Ben Reddy explained that the Cardinal ap
proach was to focus on taking care of the fundamentals and not al
lowing the past to dictate their play.
"Any pressure that's there is self imposed," he said.
Peterson is definitely taking the upcoming double header seriously.
"Stanford is a big-name school in volleyball and we cannot take
them lightly," he said. "We'll need to minimize our mistakes and
keep up our defense and blocking."
Fans can watch the game as it unfolds on College Sports Tele
vision, available on the Adelphia and Insight cable systems, and
on channel 610 of DirecTV. The telecast, which will air Saturday
at 7p.m., kicks off CSTV's men's volleyball schedule.
