After suffering a disappointing 4-3 loss to Rice on Stan
ford's courts last Saturday, the men's tennis team will at
tempt to redeem itself when the squad takes on California at
1 p.m. tomorrow at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
The loss to the Owls is the second of the season for Stan
ford after the team was defeated 4-2 by top-ranked Illinois
at the National Indoor Championships two weekends ago.
Rice, ranked No. 23 in the collegiate polls, overcame the
Cardinal by taking two of the three doubles points and split
ting the singles points, 3-3.
The matchup was difficult from the get-go, pitting the No.
10 Stanford sophomore duo of K.C. Corkery and James
Pade against Rice's No. 3 Richard Barker and William
Barker. The Owls dominated Corkery and Pade, 8-1, bring
ing the tandem's dual-match record down to 1-3.
"I think we were pretty prepared," Corkery said. "We
knew they were a tough team, probably one of the most
underrated teams in the country to start off the year.
They have extremely good players at the top of the line
up. We knew we'd be in fora fight, but we got a slow start
in the doubles."
Senior captain Carter Morris and junior Sam Warburg
boosted their overall dual-match record to an impressive 5-
1 after downing Rice's Tony Haerle and Vuk Rajevac, 8-3.
However, that was the only doubles win in store for the
Stanford as the duo of senior Joe Kao and senior Phil
Sheng were defeated, 8-5, by the Owls' Ben Harknett and
Robert Searle.
In singles action, the team was relatively more successful

as Corkery, freshman James Wan, and Warburg all garnered
wins. Playing in the No. 1 spot for Stanford, No. 71 Warburg
overcame No. 15 Searle, serving up a 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 win.
No. 43 Corkery won in straight sets over No. 22 Barker, 6-
4, 6-2, coming back strong into the match scene after strug
gling with injuries all season. Wan, who is having an excellent
freshman year so far, continued to dominate on the courts by
giving a 6-0, 6-2 thrashing to Rice freshman Jason Mok. The
win brings Wan to a team high 7-0 dual-match record.
Sheng, playing in the No. 3 spot for Stanford, gave up a 6-
1, 6-3 match to Richard Barker. Pade, ranked No. 89 na
tionally. followed suit and lost, 6-3, 6-2, to Rice's Haerle.
Morris also drew a three set loss from Harknett, accepting a
4-6, 6-4, 7-5 defeat.
This Saturday's match against Cal will be the first-ever
collegiate tennis dual match to be broadcasted play-by
play on a live audio Web cast. This unprecedented event
will be played on Radio Tennis.com, which broadcasted for
four different ITA national collegiate championships in
2003 alone.
The Golden Bears will enter this match with 1-3 record,
yet have a No. 11 ranking in the ITA polls. Cal recently lost
to Rice, No. 9 Texas A&M and Pepperdine. The Bears' win
comes from downing No. 13 Texas earlier in the month.
"We're always looking forward to playing Cal," Corkery
said. "We've had a lot of close matches with them in the past
years. They're always a tough match because of the rivalry."
Leading the Cal team are upperclassmen Conor Niland,
Balazs Veress and Wayne Wong. Veress and Wong, both se
niors, rank at No. 91 and No. 24 respectively. Niland, a ju
nior, will be the player to beat, entering the match with a
No. 10 ranking.
