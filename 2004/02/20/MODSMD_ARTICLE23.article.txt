### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite funding problems, the third annual International Gala
w ill offer graduate students a taste of world culturetonight at 8 p.m.
"It's one of the most spectacular events of the year," said the
event's general assistant Chaßandle Jordan, a medical and doctor
al student. "The event celebrates the cultural diversity of the grad
uate student population at Stanford. Our diversity is our greatest
strength and we should celebrate it and educate each other
about it."
"When I learned that the gala was about to be dropped this year,
I felt that it would be a tremendous loss to the Stanford communi
ty," said communications coordinator Nahom Minassie Beyene, a
master's student in biomechanical engineering.
"International Gala is the only event where cultural and ethnic
organizations can come together and collectively show off their
culture, introduce themselves and their countries," said perfor
mance coordinator Heili Pals, a doctoral candidate in sociology. "I
am from the Estonian Association at Stanford — we have a very
tiny organization and putting up big events open for all Stanford
students is nearly impossible."
The free celebration will be held at Frances C. Arrillaga Alum
ni Center. As one of the largest graduate student events,the gala
attracted more than 1,300 graduate students, faculty and staff last
year. Jordan said they discovered the key for publicity is to go di
rectly to student organizations.
"For various reasons, people don't always come out for events
there could be language barriers, cultural barriers — all types of
barriers that we don't always understand, but if you make the mes
sage clear to the leaders of organizations people will come in
mass,"Jordan said.

Global cultures will be showcased with food samples and cul
tural exhibits from countries like Malaysia and Argentina. A vari
ety of performances ranging from Italian Opera to native dancing
will follow.
"The gala is an evening when music, dance, culture and cuisine
from all over the world comes together under one roof at Stan
lord.'' said Amita Chudgar, foodtasting coordinator and third year
doctoral student at the School of Education. "It's one of the most
vibrant and colorful events on campus."
This event was made a reality two years ago by the Escondido
Community Associates program and Graduate Student Program
ming Board (GSPB).
"It was much more popular than originally imagined and be
came difficult fora few students to manage," Jordan said.
Organizers hope the International Gala will become an institu
tionalized tradition so future students can enjoy it.
"This is a program that honors the international students and in
forms the Stanford community about world cultures," Beyene said.
"Events like this need to be protected and sustained."
Organizers believe this program brings the diverse graduate
student population together.
"When so many voices are attracted to such an event in the
graduate arena, 1 feel we have not only reached out to a vital seg
ment of our student community, but we are making significant
progress toward communication with and celebration of the glob
al village we have in out midst."said Thom Massey, associate dean
of students cultural education affairs.
The event is made possible by the collaboration between
Massey, international student associations, Graduate Student
Council, Escondido Village (EV), GSPB, Dean of Students Of
fice,Vice-Provost for Student Affairs, Bechtel International Cen
ter and the Office of Cultural Education.
