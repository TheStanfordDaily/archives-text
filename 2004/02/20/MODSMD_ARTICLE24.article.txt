# Senator supports funds for stem cell research
## 
### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
U.S. Senator Arlen Specter spoke to an enthusias
tic crowd at the medical sch(x>l yesterday morning
about stem cells and the current state of government
funded medical research.
The Republican senator from Pennsylvania fo
cused his comments on his continuing frustration with
the Bush administration's current policy regarding
human stem cell research, which restricts scientists to
working with existing stem cell lines. Specter de
scribed the criminalization of this research as "scan
dalous" and bemoaned the loss of some of the top
American scientists in this field to other countries
where stem cell research is not limited.
Specter attributed the political obstacles stem cell
research faces in large part to confusion over its defin
ition. Nuclear transplantation is the process that leads
to the creation of embryonic stem cells that can be
come almost any type of cell in the human body.
Specter explained that opponents of stem cell re
search often equate this procedure — often labeled
"therapeutic cloning" — to "reproductive
cloning," the growth of an infant.

Throughout the course of his speech and during
the subsequent question-and-answer session. Specter
and others were mindful to refer to the process as "nu
clear transplantation."
Specter also emphasized his ongoing support for
the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a federal
agency that, according to its Web site, "funds scientif
ic studies at universities and research institutions
across the nation." He was largely responsible for dou
bling that agency's budget from 1998 to 2003, and he
continues to advocate for increased federal hacking of
the organization.
For the 2002 fiscal year, Stanford received nearly
$250 million for research and training grants and fel
lowships from the NIH, making the University one of
the leading recipients of these federal awards.
After Specter's prepared remarks, he fielded ques
tions from the crowd. One member of the audience
voiced concerns that the NIH would not continue to
see federal funding increases.
"Tell NIH to hold on until I'm the head of the com
mittee," Specter said, who is due to chair the coveted
Appropriations committee after the next election
cycle. The crowd met this proclamation with vigor
ous applause.
