# Festival in Hayward on Sat to benefit India's blind
## 
### 
The Sankara Eye Foundation will present "Rhythm of Light," a music and dance festival, this Saturday. Feb. 21, at
Chabot College in Hayward.
Proceeds from the event will go towards preventing and curing blindness in India. The show benefits the Focus-AP
Project, whose mission statement of "Vision 20/20 by 2020" projects the group's goal of completely eradicating curable
blindness from India by the year 2020.
"This money will make it possible for those living below the poverty line in India to have surgeries they need," said
junior Yogesh Raut, a member of the Stanford Hindu Students Council. "Much of the blindness in India is easily pre
ventable or curable through modern medicine."
Featured music will include Hindi pop, ghazals, and popular, fast-paced "Bollywood-style" music. Dhun, a local bay
area Hindi band, will be frontlining the event. The festival also features Indian. Spanish, Egyptian, and Latin dance per
formances.
Preventable eye conditions are common in India, where an estimated 7 million people are blind and 41 million are
visually impaired. About 80 percent of these cases are classified as "curable." The Sankara Eye Foundation, a non
profit organization, performs about 40,000 eye surgeries a year on glaucoma, cataracts and other conditions.
"Bollywood music, like Bollywood films, is renowned throughout the world for its lively style and high energy. This
event will expose people to many different types of music. It will also raise money fora good cause," said Raut.
Tickets are $12 and $15 for students and $25 for adults. —By Melissa Fusco
