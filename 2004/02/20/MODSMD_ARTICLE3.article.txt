# Meal plans confuse students
## 
### MARY STONE 
By changing meal plan options and insti
tuting new facilities, Stanford Dining has left
students a little bit confused.
Last month, Stanford Dining's new facili
ty, Union Square, opened up in the refur
bished Tresidder Union. Union Square offers
pizza and sushi, as well as food from a grill, a
salad bar, a wrap and bowl shop and a brown
bag cooler with to-go items from all of the
restaurants.
In order to make these new facilities more
accessible to students, Stanford Dining has
shaken up the traditional dining plans. In ad
dition to Cardinal Dollars and Meal Flan
Points, Cardinal Points are included in some
of the plans.
Why the change?
Stanford Dining Director Nadeem Sid
diqui said, "We felt the need to add more
flexibility to the plans to give students more
options to eat around campus during different
times of the day."
This added flexibility means that in addi
tion to the Meal Plan Points, which can only
be used in dining halls, and Cardinal Dollars,
which can be used in both dining halls and re
tail locations, students can now use Cardinal
Points in retail and dining hall locations.
What, then, is the difference between Car
dinal Points and Cardinal Dollars?
According to the Stanford Dining Web
site, "The primary difference among them
lies in WHERE they can be spent and
WHEN they expire."
Most students, however, don't understand
the old meal plans, let alone the new ones.
"I think Cardinal Dollars are currency for

meal plans, and Cardinal points are, maybe,
forced Cardinal Dollars," guessed junior
Eerik Hantsoo. "They make you buy them at
Wilbur. That's all I know."
Many students have also felt a rise in price
along with the rise in complexity.

"I think it's overly complicated and they
do that to mask how grossly overpriced it all
is," said senior Chris Ayer.
"We priced our meal plans this year with a

standardized price increase/' Siduiqui said in re
sponse to such complaints. "We didn't penalize
the students monetarily by allowing them to eat
at all the venues."
To address all the confusion, Siddiqui explained
that Stanford Dining offered several solutions.
"We set up information tables during the first
week of each quarter to answer questions students
may have. We have also created an office in Tresid
der for students to stop by with questions and make

meal plan changes."
Junior Alicia Dantzker visited the new Dining
offices in Tresidder to discover the truth about
meal plans.
"I went in there wanting a cheaper plan and
I came out with a more expensive one. The lady
was extremely helpful, and she called the one
plan I got 'c for choice.' Then she wouldn't let
me leave before giving me a highlighter color
coded map of all the food places on campus 1
could exercise these choices."
Even with the efforts to publicize and explain
the new system some students, like junior Miya
Woolfalk, remain mystified.
"What's Union Square?" she asked.
