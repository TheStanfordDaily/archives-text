# Lost in Transatlanticism:
## Brits are humming jazz and‘Queen’ 
### RACHEL SYME ANGLOPHILE COLUMNIST 
The other day, I was talking to my
token British friend, Charlie Perrins
(heir to the Worcestershire sauce for
tune, for all you condiment enthusi
asts), about ye olde nightlife here,
and he clued me into a popular drink
ing game that sounds SO exciting, SO
thrill-a-minute, it just has to come
from England. That's right, I'm talk
ing about "strip mathematics."
According to the sauce-hoss, Ox
ford college freshmen who are "hus
ting" (or campaigning, in American)
for class office have to undergo night
ly tortures fora week, of which the
highlight is a rip-roaring game of
high-stakes multiplication.
I don't know about you, but to
stand in front of a crowd while forced
to do long division or bare my skivvies
seems terrifying to me — and per
haps a little too brainy to be the cli
max of any party. But when you add it
all up, I don't understand a lot of
things about the British. And, most
likely, neither do you. That's why
you're reading this article.
1) Kevin Little's "Turn Me On": I
don't have much to say except that
this is THE party anthem right now in
British clubs. I'm not going to lie, its
Sean Paul-esque (did 1 just say that?)
reggae beat and cheesy synth-accents
are so catchy that I can't help but
shake a bit when I walk by a crowded
kebab van blasting it at 2 a.m.
2) Jazz Babies: The inspiration for
"American Idol" initially came from
England, so it is no surprise that vocal
jazz should have a renaissance here
as well.
The difference is, while the United
States only has idol-hopefuls and
Norah Jones to represent the popular
jazz contingent, Britain has an entire
ly new crop of young singers record
ing vintage-sounding albums and
rocketing up the charts. These days, it
is a must for budding vocalists to
cover Rat Pack-era tunes, as well as
busting out some Billie, Ella and clas
sic soul.
I think we can all agree that al
lowing 16 year-old white girls from
suburban England to record soul al

bums is risky, but some are calling
one such teen-crooner. Joss Stone,
the best new British export since
Earl Grey. She recently appeared on
MTV with her funk twist on the
White Stripes "Fell in Love With a
Girl." Some others to look at are
Katie Melua, Amy Winehouse and
Jamie Cullum (who sounds like
Harry Connick Jr... Jr).
3) Glamour and Glowsticks: OK.
let's face it, we all have a favorite
Queen memory. It might be the time
you finally realized you knew every
word of "Wayne's World," the secret
"We Are the Champions" rock-out
before the big game or the dance you
choreographed to "Don't Stop Me
Now" in front of your mirror. Or
maybe those are just mine
Whatever your Queen moment is,
I can still guarantee you that it was
not as awesome as the experience I
had when my girls and I rolled into
"We Will Rock You" in London's
West End earlier this month. Yes, I
saw the Queen musical. And it was
ridiculous. Well-timed, too, if you
want to consider the "glam rock" re
vival taking place across Britain. The
Darkness has brought irony back into
the trend, girls are sporting the very
accessible and everyday razored hair
and sparkly t-shirt dress look and the
Queen musical is nearly sold out
every night.
As it should be. It is only a matter
of time before it crosses the ocean and
when it does, be prepared. The acting
is borderline awful, the plot only pro
vides cheap segues between songs,
but, ah, the music, the music. Queen
songs are perfectly suited for this
venue, with the choral arrangements
and gaudy theatricality. The theater is
transformed into a concert-like at
mosphere, and if you think that you
wouldn't be standing up at the end,
waving a (complimentary) glowstick
and belting out the words to "Bo
hemian Rhapsody" with the rest of
the middle-aged crowd, you'd be
wrong.
