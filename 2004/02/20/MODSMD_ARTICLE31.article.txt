## Adam and Drew together again 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
I have a confession to make. I
am in love with Adam Sandler. His
goofy smile, his sophomoric wit,
his love of bad 80s music. Here's
my fantasy: I'm sitting in my
bathing suit on a Hawaiian island
being serenaded by Sandler play
ing the ukulele. In this fantasy, the
part of "me" will be played by
Drew Barrymore, and we'll call it
"50 First Dates."
The movie transports us to
Oahu and introduces us to Henry
Roth (Sandler), animal trainer by
day and comniitment-phobe by
night. It seems that Henry has no
trouble getting attached to the
animals he cares for, but when it
comes to women he's not quite
ready for the long-term.
It would seem then that when

Henry meets Lucy (Barrymore),
an art teacher with short-term
memory loss, it would be a
match made in one-night-stand
heaven. No short-term memory,
no need for commitment. Un
less, of course, Henry were to
fall in love.
After taking his boat out fora
spin and subsequently crashing,
Henry winds up eating Spam at a
cafe. (Little known fact: of all 50
states, Hawaii consumes the most
Spam.) This is where he first lays
eyes on Lucy, who's busy building
a volcano out of waffles. We later
learn that Lucy suffered a head in
jury after being in a car accident in
volving a cow, a pineapple and the
Flaming Lips' song "Do You Real
ize." (That's one song you
shouldn't listen to while operating
heavy machinery.)
The accident wiped out
Lucy's short-term memory, and
she can't remember anything
that happened prior to the inci
dent. She wakes up every day in
some sort of weird "Ground
hog's Day" re-enactment, reliv
ing the day of the accident over
and over again. Same clothes,
same cafe, same penchant for
waffle-sculpting. Her delusional

reality is maintained by her fa
ther, Marlin (Blake Clark) and
her brother, Doug (a barely-rec
ognizable lisping Sean Astin),
who continue to let her believe
that every day is the day after the
accident.
While it may seem like this is a
somewhat outlandish premise,
Sandler and his crew somehow
make it seem plausible. Zany,
quirky characters fill out the cast:
Henry's best friend, Ula (Rob
Schneider), spends the film sport
ing ultra-short shorts and a discol
ored eye, and Alexa (Lusia
Strus), Henry's co-worker, re

sembles Frau Farbissina of
"Austin Powers." Barrymore and
Sandler are quite perfect togeth
er, exchanging quips and encour
aging you to sing along with them
to the Beach Boys.
"50 First Dates" gives us some
surprises, some good laughs and a
really enjoyable time at the the
ater. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll
sing "Wouldn't It Be Nice."
Truthfully, I'd love to avoid saying
something corny like, "This is a
perfect date movie," but it really
is. So get yourself a date and go see
it, I've got to get back to my
ukulele fantasy.



Adam Sandler exhibits great chemistry with his costar. No, not Drew
Harry more — the penguin from the preview.
