# Bertolucci’s wet 'Dreamers'
## 
### JASON ROSENSWEIG INTERMISSION WRITER 
Bernardo Bertolucci's new film, "The
Dreamers," is a work of small genius — small in
the way that a short story's genius is small. The
movie's characters are small in experience
(three 20-year-olds), its space is small in size (al
most the whole film takes place inside a
Parisian apartment) and the story's time span is
small (it covers one month). Beyond displaying
masterful writing, acting and direction, the
film's true genius lies in its courageous and awe
some honesty.
In"The Dreamers," Bertolucci takes us
back to the revolutionary year of 1968.
Matthew, an American student played by
Michael Pitt, is studying abroad in Paris. He
meets two über-cool Parisian twins, Isabelle
(Eva Green) and Theo (Louis Garrel). Soon
after meeting, the twins invite him to stay in
their parent-less apartment. A month of per
sonal and sexual discovery ensues — with, I
might add, very little dreaming.
Bertolucci set new standards with his 1972
"Last Tango in Paris" (Marlon Brando, Maria
Schneider). "The Dreamers" surpasses. No
other film of such artistic quality has given such
an intense, true and beautiful place to sex. The
bare bodies of the three are almost always half
or wholly on the screen. They are thin, attrac
tive in that not-quite-developed nubile way;
Bertolucci gets his pay-off for casting charac
ters at their true age.

The film has a massive cinematic force. The
three self-proclaimed film buffs celebrate a lan
guage and a life that they take ravenously from
the movies; at times they act out shots from
their favorite films as Bertolucci splices in the
silver archive reels themselves. Though such a
tactic could be construed as the indulgent nar
cissism of an aging filmmaker, it is also symbol
ic of a post-war Western culture that defines it
self on the images and tropes of cinema (and
television).
The narrative is infused with the historical
(student revolutionaries canter by the apart
ment's windows) and the cultural (movie allu
sions and 60s-era rock music run throughout
the film). But the characters and their incestu
ous triangle drive the movie, reaching a series of

revelatory and
emotional nodes.
1 give you one
of those nodes ofl
raw brilliance: In
an ambivalent
stroke of revenge

and generosity, Theo dares Eva and Matthew
to have sex in front of him. The scene exempli
fies the sadistic and unconditional love of the
twins as it pulls in the captivated Matthew. Eva
is the 1968 Aphrodite: confident, free, sexy and
knowing. Matthew is the innocence of the
50stransported awkwardly into the next
decade. At one point later in the movie,
Matthew tells Eva that when he first saw her he
thought she was someone who had had many
lovers. She responds, laughingly, "I was act
ing."
But in this scene, no one is acting. On the
kitchen floor, they begin and Matthew shame
facedly asks Eva to help him. Once they get
going, Theo indifferently begins to fry some
eggs. After finishing, Theo leans down over
Eva's tender body and places his fingers on her
thigh; when he pulls them away, they are cov
ered in blood. After he withdraws, Matthew
and Eva kiss ardently, their hands, lips and
faces also smeared in blood.

Rosensweig's favorite movies from 2003 are " Thir
teen, " "Mystic River" and "Kill Bill." Just so you
know if his taste sucks.


"I wonder how tall the Eiffel tower is?"
