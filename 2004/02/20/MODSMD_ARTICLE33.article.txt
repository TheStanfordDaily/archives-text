### JENNY STINGLE INTERMISSION WRITER 
Here's all the Hollywood news and gossip fit to
print — well, at least all the news and gossip that's

fit for Intermission to print,
which isn't saying a whotl'
hell of a lot. Bizzang!
* Following in the
footsteps of "Beavis and
Butthead" and "South
park," "The Simpsons" will
finally become a movie in
the next few years. Creator

and writer James L. Brooks recently announced
the new project but refuses to let out details.

* Christopher Nolan, di
rector of "Memento," will be
remaking the character of
Batman in the new movie
"Batman: Intimidation," set
to come out next summer.
Nolan has said that the new
Batman, played by Christian
Bale, will be more "cool" and
"James-Bondish."
* Though Britney's marriage

to Jason Alexander was annulled after 55 hours,
the omnipresent Spears has been seen wearing
both a gold band and a diamond — encrusted
ring. It seems the fantasy of every heterosexual
male on this campus may be a taken woman.
* In similarly tasteful conduct, it was report
ed that Robert Downey Jr. got a tattoo of him
self as a super hero — basically the tattoo is of
his face on a super-buff body. I guess an image of
Downey shooting up heroin, although more re
alistic, didn't give out the vibe Downey was hop
ing to achieve.
* A quick list of some recent hookups: damn
hot Angelina Jolie and Jonny Lee Miller (the
chemistry from "Hackers" never faded), J.Lo and
Marc Anthony (who really cares? she's annoying
and he's gremlin-like), Mischa Barton and Ben
jamin McKenzie (the O.C. is a powerful place),
and Andre Balazs and Uma Thurman (I can't
pretend to know who this guy is... but at least
she's done with the cheating Ethan Hawke).
* After losing many a pound on the Trim-Spa
diet, Anna Nicole Smith just found out that her
reality show has been cancelled. Poor Anna. Ac
tually, Anna really will never be poor considering
she received millions of dollars from a horny, de
crepit old man.
* Diana Ross was convicted of a DUI in Ari
zona for driving with a blood alcohol concentra
tion of .2 percent when the legal limit is .08. The
Supreme-ly drunk Ross was far from inconspicu
ous — she was seen driving South in North
bound lanes.
* Although this may be old news, it is worth
mentioning that Billy Crudup dumped Mary-
Louise Parker for Claire Danes when Parker was
seven months pregnant with his child. Wow, what
a bastard.
* Mark-Paul Gosslaar had his first child with
his wife of seven years. As memorable and life
changing as "Saved by the Bell" is, it's nice to see
that someone has moved on from the show to be
successful.
* Have you ever wondered how well-endowed
Ewan McGregor is? Well, neither have I, but now
is the chance to find out. McGregor's full frontal
scene in "Young Adam" has just recently been
re-added to the U.S. version after it was removed
a few months ago. "Young Adam," which follows
the story of a young Scottish man who becomes
involved in a murder case about a woman found
floating in a river, won Best Picture at the Edin
burgh Film Festival and will be released in April.
