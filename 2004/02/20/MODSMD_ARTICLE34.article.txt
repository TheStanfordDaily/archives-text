## Romare Bearden: good with scissors, paste and cardboard 
### CHRIS MEYER INTERMISSION WRITER 
Romare Bearden did not start constructing collages until
1963, when he was 51 years old. Up until then, he was a full-time
social worker in New York City who did some painting and mag
azine illustrating on the side. If he had continued to paint until his
death in 1987 and had never switched to collage, he probably
would not be the subject of a major museum retrospective, "The
Art of Romare Bearden," now at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art.
The first room of the exhibit displays some of Bearden's early
work from the 19405. During this period, he devoted himself
mainly to figurative paintings, mostly of biblical themes. The style
of the paintings is reminiscent of the work of Picasso, whom Bear
den would later meet in 1950 during a leave from his work in so
cial services. The "Dove and the Leopard Wrestle" from 1946
looks as though Bearden might have had Picasso's Guernica in
mind when he was painting it.
The problem with Bearden's early work is that it is too reliant
on the work of other artists. He did not find his true artistic iden
tity — his "originality" — until he turned to the medium of col
lage. Collage allowed Bearden to develop his trademark style in
a way that painting had not. It is no surprise then that Bearden's
collages and photomontages make up the majority of the exhib
it's contents.
"Watching the Good Trains Go By" is a good example
of his early collage work. In this small piece (approximate
ly 14 inches by 17 inches), Bearden packs together a com
plex image from magazine cut-outs. He includes at least
eight figures in varying degrees of disorder in the fore
ground while a steaming train approaches in the back
ground. It is impossible to interpret this collage without first
mentioning something aboußearden: He was African-
American.
I avoided mentioning this fact in my opening because I want
ed to establish Bearden as an American artist rather than an
African-American artist. It is unfair to classify someone as a
"great African-American artist" because the danger of this sort

of label is that it somehow implies that the artist is the best among
a secondary category of artists. That said, the fact that Bearden
was African American is essential to understanding his art be
cause it is an issue that much of his art deals with in one form or
another.

The adjective "good" that Bearden applies to the passing
trains is telling. All of the faces in his collage are recognizably
African American, so the reality that the "good" trains are pass
ing them by gives the image a political message — especially
when you consider that it was constructed in 1964 during the Civil
Rights Movement. Bearden's placement of the figures in the
foreground gives them the appearance of waiting for the train to
stop, yet we know from the title that it will not.
Collages, and those of Bearden in particular, are a challenge
to comprehend. In effect they place the viewer in the role of the
artist, as one must construct the fragments into something coher
ent just as the Bearden did in the original act of assembly. There
is no instant gratification when visiting "The Art of Romare
Bearden." Some of Bearden's collages are so densely packed
with details that you could easily spend five or 10 minutes trying
to get a handle on a single image. When visiting the show, don't
get bogged down trying to look at every single piece. Your time
will be better spent if you focus on a few pieces in each of the ex
hibit's rooms.
A Bearden image that resonated with me was "Berkeley —
The City and Its People," a mural (10 feet by 16 feet) he con
structed in 1973 for the Berkeley City Hall. As a native of Berke
ley, Calif., I was impressed by how it managed to encapsulate my
own thoughts and feelings about the city and its values. Standing
in front of this image and recalling my own memories of growing
up in Berkeley, 1 realized that Bearden's collages are metaphors
for memory. Just as our memories are comprised of layers of de
tails, his collages assemble and juxtapose a wide variety of color
ful images into a meaningful whole.
At times, reconstructing a Bearden collage can be frustrating
for the viewer because it requires a level of patience that contem
porary American culture does not encourage. "The Art of Ro
mare Bearden" demonstrates that this patience can be rewarded
with satisfaction.

"The Art of Rotnare Bearden," which was organized hy the Na
tional Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., is currently on view at
SFMOMA until May 16.


While you may mistake this fora Picasso, trust us, it's not. The
lack of color is a dead giveaway.

At times, reconstructing a Bearden collage can be frustrating
for the viewer because it requires a level of patience that contem

While you may mistake this fora Picasso, trust us, it's not. The
lack of color is a dead giveaway.
Romare Bearden did not start constructing collages until
1963, when he was 51 years old. Up until then, he was a full-time
social worker in New York City who did some painting and mag
azine illustrating on the side. If he had continued to paint until his
death in 1987 and had never switched to collage, he probably
would not be the subject of a major museum retrospective, "The
Art of Romare Bearden," now at the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art.
The first room of the exhibit displays some of Bearden's early
work from the 19405. During this period, he devoted himself
mainly to figurative paintings, mostly of biblical themes. The style
of the paintings is reminiscent of the work of Picasso, whom Bear
den would later meet in 1950 during a leave from his work in so
cial services. The "Dove and the Leopard Wrestle" from 1946
looks as though Bearden might have had Picasso's Guernica in
mind when he was painting it.
The problem with Bearden's early work is that it is too reliant
on the work of other artists. He did not find his true artistic iden
tity — his "originality" — until he turned to the medium of col
lage. Collage allowed Bearden to develop his trademark style in
a way that painting had not. It is no surprise then that Bearden's
collages and photomontages make up the majority of the exhib
it's contents.
"Watching the Good Trains Go By" is a good example
of his early collage work. In this small piece (approximate
ly 14 inches by 17 inches), Bearden packs together a com
plex image from magazine cut-outs. He includes at least
eight figures in varying degrees of disorder in the fore
ground while a steaming train approaches in the back
ground. It is impossible to interpret this collage without first
mentioning something aboußearden: He was African-
American.
I avoided mentioning this fact in my opening because I want
ed to establish Bearden as an American artist rather than an
African-American artist. It is unfair to classify someone as a
"great African-American artist" because the danger of this sort

of label is that it somehow implies that the artist is the best among
a secondary category of artists. That said, the fact that Bearden
was African American is essential to understanding his art be
cause it is an issue that much of his art deals with in one form or
another.

The adjective "good" that Bearden applies to the passing
trains is telling. All of the faces in his collage are recognizably
African American, so the reality that the "good" trains are pass
ing them by gives the image a political message — especially
when you consider that it was constructed in 1964 during the Civil
Rights Movement. Bearden's placement of the figures in the
foreground gives them the appearance of waiting for the train to
stop, yet we know from the title that it will not.
Collages, and those of Bearden in particular, are a challenge
to comprehend. In effect they place the viewer in the role of the
artist, as one must construct the fragments into something coher
ent just as the Bearden did in the original act of assembly. There
is no instant gratification when visiting "The Art of Romare
Bearden." Some of Bearden's collages are so densely packed
with details that you could easily spend five or 10 minutes trying
to get a handle on a single image. When visiting the show, don't
get bogged down trying to look at every single piece. Your time
will be better spent if you focus on a few pieces in each of the ex
hibit's rooms.
A Bearden image that resonated with me was "Berkeley —
The City and Its People," a mural (10 feet by 16 feet) he con
structed in 1973 for the Berkeley City Hall. As a native of Berke
ley, Calif., I was impressed by how it managed to encapsulate my
own thoughts and feelings about the city and its values. Standing
in front of this image and recalling my own memories of growing
up in Berkeley, 1 realized that Bearden's collages are metaphors
for memory. Just as our memories are comprised of layers of de
tails, his collages assemble and juxtapose a wide variety of color
ful images into a meaningful whole.
At times, reconstructing a Bearden collage can be frustrating
for the viewer because it requires a level of patience that contem
porary American culture does not encourage. "The Art of Ro
mare Bearden" demonstrates that this patience can be rewarded
with satisfaction.
