# Contrary to popular belief, Stanford kids love 'Vagina'

### MERRITT FORREST BAER INTERMISSION WRITER 
It's a glorious day when wo can all
wear pins that say "I V Vagina" and
still be politically correct. It's amaz

ing that we can go watch a show
where the word "vagina" is used
more often than the word "the"and
not hear nervous giggles from the au
dience. We've grown up — as indi
viduals and as a community. The

women of the"The Vagina Mono
logues" have helped us reach this ma
turity, and at the same time created a
tasteful and powerful production
about an oft-considered taboo topic.
Produced by the exceptionally talent-

Ed Lauren Dunagan, Eve En
sler's "The Vagina Mono
logues" was not just a show of
female pride but, instead, a sin
cere social commentary on our
private lives and a dispelling of
our innermost insecurities.
Directed by senior Dani
Keenan-Miller, the production
was sleek and sophisticated.
With only a luscious sofa at cen
ter stage, 16 women seduced us,
enraged us, humored us and
transfixed us for almost two
hours. One of the highlights of
the evening was Dani Keenan-
Miller's introduction. Her
melding of formal welcoming
and playful monologue was
seamless. At the introduction's
end, all 16 women joined
Keenan-Miller onstage to finish

by recounting the multitude of vagi
na nicknames.
The different monologues broke
the play up into vignettes. Allison
McKenzie's "The Vagina Workshop"
was particularly endearing, and her
accent was impeccable. Describing
the loss (and then rediscovery) of her
clitoris, McKenzie's flair for comedy
was highly evident, as was Yana Ke
sala's in "Because He Liked to Look
at It." Kesala's performance was truly
wonderful and fully convincing. Her
character's layered insecurities were
subtle but clear.
On the other end of the spectrum
was the exciting and glorious "Angry
Vagina," performed by Dunagan. In a
piece that could easily be played over
the-top and ridiculous, Dunagan
brought intense passion to the role.
Her hysterical monologue really
showed her outstanding range as an
actress. The other actress of the
evening that truly showed off her
range was the ever-talented Sarah
Wilson. Possibly the funniest mono
logue of the evening, Wilson's

"Woman Who Loved to Make Vagi
nas Happy" was wickedly entertain
ing. Her exercise in moaning was bril
liantly comic — especially her "Stan
ford dorm moan," or lack thereof!
Shining performances filled the
evening, especially Tiffany
Hawthorne's "Hair," Rubi Vaughn's
"Coochi Snorcher," Sonia Monte
jano's "Cunt," and DeMara Cabr
era's moving "I Was There in the
Room." The elegant ambience was
mostly due to Christina "Duchess"
Chao's classy lighting. Each mono
logue found itself in a new space
thanks to her effective and stylish
technical expertise.
"The Vagina Monologues" was a
fitting and excellent conclusion to a
well-publicized V-Week. Campus
wide support flooded Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium for the entertaining yet often
heart-wrenching production. The
provocative production hit home,
forcing us to rethink the vagina's
role in our society and inspiring us
to love ourselves for who we are,
vagina or not.
