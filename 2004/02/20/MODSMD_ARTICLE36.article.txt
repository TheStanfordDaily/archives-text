# The

### CHRIS LEE STAFF WRITER 
The phrase "student film" often

stands fora myriad
of things — cheesy
synth scores, corny
lines, hamfisted
acting and over
artsy camera an
gles being the chief
offenses. Is it art?
Or just public mas-

turbation? Perhaps the more impor
tant question: Can a campus with no un-

dergraduate film production major actually
produce anything worth its DV stock?
The Stanford Film Society (SFS) presents
its third annual incarnation of The Pumpkin
Pie Project this Saturday, Feb. 21, and with it
an irrefutable argument for the promising
state of affairs of student film here. Regard
less of what you may or may not remember
seeing at previous student film screenings, to
me, the 11 offerings of this year's Pumpkin Pie
represent a significant cut above the standard
fare. If you're interested in student film in any
way, I urge you to go see them. Strike that. I
emphatically implore you to go see them. It's
like a great acid trip, a fat line of coke and a
ripping good candy flip, all in one. Ok, maybe
not that good — but it is free.
The brainchild of former SFS wunderkind
Matt Brutocao, Pumpkin Pie is a collection of
shorts made from various directors in the Ad
vanced Filmmakers Workshop (AFW). As
per tradition, all the shorts are linked by some
common theme; this year's linking device is a
large plastic cooler which appears in all (or at
least most) of the shorts, explaining the pro
gram's title of "Pumpkin Pie III: The Rise and
Fall of Cooler."
The preview tape this reviewer was given
contained six of the 11 final pieces, and even
without the promised inter-segment connec
tions and final sound mixes the overall quality
and production feels like a significant upgrade
from previous efforts. Part of this is in fact due
to the equipment — this year's directors were
fortunate enough to use a higher-end Pana
sonic digital camera that shoots at a stan-

o
dard 24 frames per second, as well as a
new lighting kit— and the overall
look of the pieces feels instantly more
cinematic. Gone are the harsh lighting
and unforgiving color schemes of stan
dard DV. But let's not give the actual
people involved short shrift either; the
filmmakers themselves are all sea
soned veterans of previous SFS pro
ductions and should be lauded for the
quality of presentation.
Coordinator Kirk Shimano said
that Pumpkin Pie was the primary pro
ject of this year's advanced workshop,
with participants devoting all of fall
quarter to discussing scripts and watch
ing rough cuts. "Our main overall goal
was to get filmmakers to spend more

time in the preproduction phase," Shimano
rioted, "because in the normal film festival,
things are so rushed that people rarely have
time to plan their shoots properly — they just
have to jump in straight away." The commit
ment shows. Pacing and editing of each short
moves along at a surprisingly intuitive pitch,
and even with the continuity errors inherent
in the preview I found myself able to appreci
ate each piece on its own. Of particular enter
tainment: the frenetic pacing and impressive
digital effects of Jack Conte's caper "Unde
velopers," the so-cornball-it's-good humor
and wordplay of Kirk Shimano's "Madame
Arrrrrbright," and lan Slattery's hilarious
mockumentary "Ushers."
Some moments are still hit or miss, but
that should probably be more embraced
than frowned upon with aspiring artists will
ing to take risks and still feeling themselves
out. The overall product is more than wor
thy of your time, and the principle weakness
of last year's Pumpkin Pie — a conspicu
ous dearth of entries— has been entirely
remedied with the dedication of this year's
workshop.
"I think that Pumpkin Pie has really come
into its own this year," Shimano adds. "Last
year, we really struggled with establishing
communication between the different film
makers. But this year, the AFW has provided
a way for all of the participants to communi
cate on a weekly basis and truly participate in
a collaborative process." You can bet your
box office this writer will be present at the
screening to see how it all turns out.


The Stanford Film Society attempts to bring some semblance of culture to the masses with
their "Pumpkin Pic III: The Rise and Fall of Cooler." Free viewing tomorrow.
