"Undevelopment: Rise and Fall of the Cooler"
Easily the most high-energy piece on the pre
view tape, "Undevelopment" is about two friends
who come into possession of a special Polaroid cam
era that traps the subject of every photo in the de
veloped picture. When one friend becomes trapped
in just this way, the race to save her — and elude a
mysterious villain with the same problem — is on
its way. The rapid-fire cutting and plentiful digital
effects are used with remarkable ingenuity, and the
score — synth-y as it is — effectively conveys both
Lthe zany and the ominous.
