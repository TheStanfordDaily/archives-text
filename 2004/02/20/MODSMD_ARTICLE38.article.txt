# "Madame Arrrrrbrightâ€™

### 
It seems to have all the makings of a terrifically
B-grade joke, but "Madame Arrrbright" shines be
cause it embraces what it is, transforming potential
ly stale cheese into a finely-aged gourmet dairy
product. A high government official pays a visit to
the Stanford campus, and in the process meets a pi
rate who needs help negotiating the return of his
booty. The appeal of the film lies entirely in the
comedic interplay of these two characters: the
bright, spunky Arrrbright and the goofball pirate.
Toss in a little screwball romance and you've got
one sly comedy that serves up plenty of laughs
with its ham.
