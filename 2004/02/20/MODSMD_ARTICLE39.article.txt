# "Ushers"
## 
### 
The mockumentary has always been something
of a double-edged sword â€” deadpan humor looks so
good on paper, but few can actually be the next
Christopher Guest. "Ushers" is a surprisingly well
executed foray into the genre, thanks in no small part
to its great actors who know when to play it lully
straight and when to slip into comic hysteria. Follow
ing a group of aspiring ushers taking the rigorous
UCAT entrance exams, the piece is tull of great vi
sual gags (ushers dashing down aisles, careening
around velvet ropes and practicing those big, smiley
greetings) and spot-on delivery. The only caveat:
The fun ends sooner than it should.
