# Special ed reform addressed
## 
### ANN CHIN 
In a talk last night in Wallenberg Hall, Dr.
Alice Parker, the assistant superintendent of Spe
cial Education in the state of California, stressed
the need to include all students — even students
with learning disabilities — in the general educa
tion system.
"We shouldn't have a director of Special Educa
tion," she said. "We should have a director of gener
al education."
Parker also argued that Special Education stu
dents should be expected to master state standards
like all other students.
"If they're not prepared for society, we've done
students a disservice," she said. "It doesn't do anyone
any good to not help them integrate into the world."
Parker gave a brief overview of the progress of
Special Education services in California and then
discussed recent policy issues, namely the Individu
als with Disabilities Education Act of 1997 and the
No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.
IDEA, originally the Education for the Handi
capped Act, was designed to provide disabled indi
viduals with civil rights, due process and access to
public schools.
The reauthorization of IDEA will be up fora
floor vote in the Senate on March 22. New concerns
involve streamlining the process of Individualized
Education Programs and an early intervention
model for children with learning disabilities. Though
the bill has already passed in the House of Repre
sentatives, the Senate version is expected to be very

different.
The goal of the No Child Left Behind Act was to
guarantee children access to quality curriculum and
the ability to demonstrate their skills while making
adequate yearly progress. The law emphasized re
sults and accountability.
Parker called it a "philosophical" piece of legis
lation that had good intentions but "fatal" flaws.
"We need to adjust the law so we look at progress
over time for each individual," she said.
Last year, there were 675,000 students receiving
special education services in California alone.
Only recently has legislation on Special Educa
tion focused more on the quality of education for
students rather than simply the opportunity to learn.
Parker explained.
Before 1997, Special Education was"a separate
curriculum based on different standards," she said.
"There was little relationship to general education
programs and activities."
Now, it is designed to meet the student's special
needs within the general education curriculum.
Despite the country's long history of poor out
comes for Special Education students, national poli
cies appear to be headed towards standards based on
accountability, Parker said.
"We've done a great job of reducing the number
of students served in separate facilities and increas
ing the number of students who spend more time in
regular classrooms," she added.
The event was part of a speaker series jointly


Maria Premiere
Isaac Babel's play made its U.S. debut in Pigott Theater last night
sponsored by the Human Biology depart
ment and Kids with Dreams, an organization
aiming to improve opportunities for chil
dren with disabilities.

Some students at the event felt that
many more students would have benefited
from attending.
"I thought it was very informative, but it
would be helpful if a lot more people came,"
said junior Amanda Redmond. "People here
are already interested in special education,
but it would also be informative for people
in general education."
