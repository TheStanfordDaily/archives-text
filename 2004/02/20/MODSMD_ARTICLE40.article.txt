# Illegitimate child of Ravi Shankar finds 'Home,' at last
## 
### RANDY MANO INTERMISSION WRITER 
Just about two years ago, a young
woman released her first album,
"Come Away with Me," tocritical ac
claim. The masses slowly drew into
Norah Jones'jazzy world, and she re
ceived multiple honors at the Gram
my Awards.
Here she is again with a fine fol
low-up, "Feels Like Home."

The timing of her releases

is perfect, at least to me.

Her music, particular
ly the upbeat"Sun-

rise" single, makes
me want to snug
gle into my
couch, clutching
a mug of hot
cocoa while al
ternating glances

at the fireplace, the
rain-streaked win-

dows, and my special
someone. It is no surprise

that her singles and albums first
appear deep into winter, amid the
raindrops of San Francisco and
snowflakes of Boston, two of her
major hubs for sales.
One caveat to everything from
here on out: Jazz music needs to be
heard live, not on the radio or your
mp3 player. The notes and lyrics are
highly interpretive and fluid, improv
ing upon repeated listenings.
I only hope that those who dig her
music will seek one of her perfor
mances once she starts touring the
United States. I loved how she dis
tilled her cozy notes at the Mountain
Winery in Saratoga, and I heard that
her Berkeley performance was

equally good. (Her upcoming tour
first swings through multiple coun
tries in Europe.)
It is clear that Ms. Jones is taking
more chances than her fairly straight
forward first offering. "Feels Like
Home" has a distinctly stronger influ
ence of non-jazz elements, such as
country and rock to create an uneven
sound. With Dolly Parton contribut
ing vocals, "Creepin' In" has a fun
country appeal (never thought I

would ever write that), to

transport us temporarily

to the Grand Ole

Opry.
Another one of

her tracks. "The
Long Way

Home," dutifully
reinterprets a re
cent Tom Waits
song, complete

with electric guitar.

Her rock'n'roll influ-

ence largely turns out to

be far less compatible with

the rest of the album and Jones' vocal
strengths. She turns more into a sec
ond-rate version of Bonnie Raitt,
particularly on "What Am I to You?"
"Feels Like Home" won't shake
up the music world like her first re
lease, but fans will embrace the fa
miliar jazz elements while critics will
applaud her infusion of new genres
into her style. Without repeating re
frains in her lyrics, this album
doesn't have any other radio-friend
ly singles, which is really how it
should be.
This 24-year-old has a lifetime to
perform live with the Handsome
Band and share her voice with jazz
admirers.
