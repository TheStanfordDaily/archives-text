## DJ John lays the beatdown 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION WRITER 
If your only experience
with techno is that lame party
Naranja threw a couple
weeks ago, then you're get
ting the short end of the stick.
Electronica may not have the
visibility of other musical
genres, especially in the
United States, but there are
still mountains of quality
music to explore. It's not all
ravers and glowsticks out
there...
What's New
Daft Punk released an
album of remixes entitled
"Daft Club" on Jan. 27. Fea
turing remixes by artists such
as the Basement Jaxx and the
Neptures, the French DJs
hoped to capitalize on the
success of their amazing
sophomore album, "Discov
ery." Unfortunately, the
remix album is full of preten
tious bullshit.
The Crystal Method re
leased its third album, "Le
gion of Boom," on Jan. 13;
now you can get your fix of
tweakv breakbeats and dark

rock. Wes Borland, formerly
of Limp Bizkit, plays his gui
tar on a few of the songs and
manages to avoid sucking
ass. This is a moody album
and showcases L.A.'s best
DJs doing their thing.
Plastikman, he of the min
imal techno, dropped his first
album in five years, entitled
"Closer." Droning and quiet,
the album thrives on slow,
subtle build-ups. Full of para
noid stop-starts and creepy
percussion, this takes some
time to wrap your mind
around but is pretty cool stuff.
Plaid's dry IDM beats are
hard to swallow sometimes,
and its most recent album,
"Spokes," sees them moving
back towards the mechanis
tic style they started with. A
lot of this music is just re
hashing of their earlier work.

ence, Inc. mixes Middle-
Eastern sounds with chill
beats, perfect for lounging
around after the parties.
Signed to Thievery Corpora
tion's Eighteenth Street
Lounge record label, these
guys put out quality
lounge/downbeat music.
"The Power of Suggestion" is
a strong debut that you
should check out.
What I've been listening to
Turntablism has reached
an art form with releases by

DJs such as Kid Koala and
Prefuse 73. Kid Koala's
"Some of My Best Friends
Are DJs" jumps from beat to
beat, with humorous samples
abounding. The Kid is smart
enough to keep songs short
before they get annoying,
and there is more than
enough material to keep you
happy through many listens.
Prefuse 73 recently put
out "Extinguished," an
album that jumps from track
to track before you know
what's going on. Racing
through 23 tracks in half an
hour, the album keeps you
guessing as Scott Herrin (aka
Prefuse 73) mixes in orches
tral arrangements, chunky
hip-hop beats, and anything
in between.

The lineup of this year's
Coachella Music Festival
(May 1 and 2) has been an
nounced. The two-day music

fest in Indio, Calif., attracts
some of the top artists in
every music genre and will be

ca's best acts will be on stage.
Kraftwerk, those legendary
Germans, help close out the
first night of music.
The Basement Jaxx
promise to serve up songs
from their latest funky offer
ing, "Kish Kash," which has
received wide critical ac
claim. On the trance side of
things, Paul Van Dyk and
Mark Farina, two well-trav
eled DJs, will be lighting up
the main tent at Coachella. In
addition, you can see Prefuse
73 and the Crystal Method
on the turntables, and Kinky,

"Some of My Best Friends
Are DJs" jumps from beat to
beat, with humorous samples
abounding. The Kid is smart
enough to keep songs short
before they get annoying,
and there is more than
enough material to keep you
happy through many listens.
Prefuse 73 recently put
out "Extinguished," an
album that jumps from track
to track before you know
what's going on. Racing
through 23 tracks in half an
hour, the album keeps you
guessing as Scott Herrin (aka
Prefuse 73) mixes in orches
tral arrangements, chunky
hip-hop beats, and anything
in between.
