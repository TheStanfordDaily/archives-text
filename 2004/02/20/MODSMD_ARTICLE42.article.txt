# Underground Fiesta brings the crews
## 
### MARCEL SOLORZANO INTERMISSION WRITER 
The stage was a block of
wood on the floor in the back
of Cafe Essaouira, a small
place on Valencia and Market
Street in San Francisco. The
man on the stage had his eyes
closed and was spitting words
out rapid fire in English, then
in Spanish, then in Portuguese.
Then he jumped behind the
har and served drinks the rest
of the night.
One of the hosts of the
event grabbed the mic and
asked,"How many emcees are
in the audience?" As more
than a dozen hands went up, it
became clear from the first five
minutes that the Underground
I iesta VII was going to be
something extremely different
than most "hip-hop" shows.
I he small bar, no age limit and
the "free" price tag were just
the beginning.

Hosted hy members of the
Forensic Science Crew, the
event was less about publicity
and profit and more fora
bunch of local crews to gath
er to have fun and rock a
crowd. With up-and-comings
like Eyecue, Enzyme &
Brayn Fuqt from the Audible
Monsters Crew, Sokrates the
Virgo, the Street Scholars
and Brodi all slated to per
form at some point in the
night, the show became a Hip
Hop open mic where most
audience members had their
instrumental tapes and CDs
in their pockets.
It started with a nonstop
line of emcees all waiting their
turn to freestyle fora song or
two as the crowd slowly grew.
The Underground Fiesta VII
wasn't the most well-publi
cized event, so most of the
people there were artists,
their friends and families and
passersby. Groups of kids still
in middle school lined the

back, and people reaching
their late forties watched as
the event got rolling. Enzyme
took over the mic after he got
on stage to freestyle and de
manded that everyone stand
up and approach the stage as
his crew quickly pushed all of
the tables and chairs into a
corner. Once the DJ threw on
his album, the event was offi
cially underway.
After his performance, the
rest of the Audible Monsters
got their turn on the mic, and
this format followed for most
of the performers. Each crew's
headliner would start with a
few songs, then they all would
get on the stage and do their
own pieces. After each was fin
ished, they would all join the
audience again and support
the next artist or walk
around handing out flyers
and selling CDs.
Some of the most notable
performances came from
Sokrates the Virgo in a song

with Prophet called "1984"
that infused the audience with
energy. This was followed by a
virtually unknown group
called Street Scholars whose
reggae rhythms made the
whole bar start dancing. Their
singing, rapping and well-pro
duced beats caught almost
everybody's attention, and
their stage presence turned the
place upside-down.
The show lost a lot of steam
after this performance because
few of the remaining emcees
who were slotted to perform
could not match the Street
Scholars' intensity. It slowly
wound down as the once
packed space thinned out.
However, this Underground
Fiesta did not disappoint
many. For such a low-key
event it drew a large crowd,
and the emcees delivered —
from those who performed
whole sets to those who flowed
for one minute delivered. Oh,
and it was free.
