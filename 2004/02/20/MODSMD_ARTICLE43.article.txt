# Don't forget about... The Frames

When you think of Irish music, what comes to mind?
Chances are you've heard of U2, the Cranberries and Sinead
O'Connor. Indeed, Irish rock periodically breaks out of
Dublin's alleys and cheap bars and makes huge impressions
across the pond. But the country still has a few musical secrets
up its sleeve, and one of these, the Frames, is about to slip out.
Vocalist Glen Hansard, a junior-high dropout, is the musi
cal force behind the Frames. Hansard assembled the band
around 1990, borrowed money from his parents to make a
demo and was immediately signed to Island records.
"Another Love Song," the band's 1992 debut, earned luke
warm reception and a red slip from its record label. But
Hansard was not to be taken out of the game so early; after a
short sabbatical, he reformed the band and recorded an inde
pendent album on a shoestring budget.
Soon after finishing the record, the band decided to make a
video for its favorite song, "Relevate." Penniless but resource
ful, the band invaded an Ireland post office, stuck a blank tape
in the security camera and recorded their video. The security
camera music video — made for four dollars — aired on pub
lic access video shows at first, and then on larger and larger
music channels, until eventually the clip was nominated for an
MTV Europe award.
The video's success led to a deal with Elektra, which finally
released the band's low-budget masterpiece, "Fitzcarraldo."
The album earned immediate and widespread praise for its raw
energy and for Hansard's strong voice and poetry. The songs
on "Fitzcarraldo," especially the title track and "Monument,"
provide powerful rock enthusiasm and became mainstays at
the Frames' increasingly legendary shows.
In 2001, the Frames enlisted the help of rock super-produc
er Steve Albini (who has manned the boards for the Pixies and
Nirvana) and avant-grunge vet Craig Ward for their third LP,
"For the Birds." This record stands as the Frames' best
achievement: subtle, understated folk-influenced rock songs
with gentle melodies and crystal-clear production.
"For the Birds" was somewhat of a departure from the
rockin' formula that led to the success of "Fitzcarraldo." Songs
like "Lay Me Down" and "Headlong" offer folk melodies and
rhythms that get loud only briefly, but do so in perfect taste.
The penultimate "Disappointed" is a 10-fi masterwork of
melancholy. "For the Birds" will satisfy the musical appetites
of any fan of Will Oldham, Songs: Ohia or other melodic folk
rock artists.
The Frames released two albums last year. The second, "Set
List," is a live album taken from a four-night stint at Vicar
Street in Dublin and showcases the awesome energy of the
band and their fans (a few years ago, Brian Eno went to a
Frames show and said it was the best rock show he'd been to in
five years). "Set List" shot to number one on the Irish charts.
While the Frames have escaped widespread recognition in
the United States, it's not for lack of trying. "For the Birds" and
"From Roads Outgrown" can easily be found at record stores,
but for online listening, the band has conveniently shared most
of their catalogue on their website (www.theframes.ie).
In addition, those looking to catch the band's transcendent
live show will have the chance in late March, when they come
to the Warfield. Check out the Frames and help turn Ire
land's best-kept secret into one of their most well-deserved
success stories.
