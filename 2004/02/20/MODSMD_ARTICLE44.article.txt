### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Stupid freshmen. They come to
Stanford, full of themselves, bragging
about how sexually educated they
are, but they fail to satisfy any Stan
ford stud(ent)'s expectations. Wan
dering from one frat to another, they
are full of talk and no action. Honest
ly, when will people grow up and ma
ture sexually? Hasn't puberty sup
posedly happened by, oh, you know,
the age of 18?
Maybe Roxy's a little pissed this
week because, ok, I admit it, I've done
the younger man thing. He was two
years younger, attractive, full of ideal

ism, and had the tools, but never read
the instruction manual. Yeah, dear
readers, it was THAT embarrassing
situation. The one where that game
has just started and already he's
fouled out. Where you've just re
moved a little bit of clothing and al
ready you're reaching for the
Kleenex. Ugh. 1 panicked. He pan
icked. Should I look sympathetic, give
him a comforting smile, and suggest a
cuddle to make him feel better? Or
should I be honest, kick him out of
bed and send him to obedience
school. I mean, it works for dogs. Why
can't younger men be trained not to
shoot when they aren't allowed to?
Alas, sexual etiquette demands ap

proaching the situation differently.
Some men are believers that if you
masturbate before a date, they won't
be as aroused if the opportunity to get
into my pants arises. But nobody
wants a sexual relationship predicat
ed on a masturbation pre-show.
Other men believe that by thinking
about prolonging an orgasm, they can
indeed hold it. But when Roxy's rear
ing to go with her handcuffs and
whipped cream, mind never triumphs
over matter.
So for all of the sexually immature
out there, for the love of God learn to
recognize the sensations that come
just before you ejaculate. If you rec
ognize that point, and you back off

just a bit, you'll be able to screw for
longer. It's the classic start /stop
technique known as the Masters and
Johnson methods in some sexual
health circles. Yes, it involves a great
deal of patience and practice, but it's
highly effective. So do your home
work. If you suffer from this ungodly
affliction (which some 30 to 40 per
cent of the population has at some
time been stricken with), try mastur
bating until just before that point of
no return, and then STOP. And
please, under no circumstance should
you attempt any form of penetrative
intercourse until you can get it under
control. Don't even try — pull out al
together and try positions that are
less stimulating, a position that will
allow for more than, say, six
thrusts. No one wants a two
minute man.
Other methods of prolonging play
time include variations on this tech
nique, such as squeezing the tip of the
base of the penis just before the point
of ejaculation, canceling out the or
gasm. Or perhaps a desensitizing
cream such as Pleasure Balm can be
added. If you think about it, condoms
are an effective way of decreasing
stimulation during sex. You'll last
longer and decrease your chances of
contracting an STD — you can't real
ly go wrong. Finally, Roxy is a firm be
liever in treating sex like real estate:

location, location, location. Trying a
change in position or a different
venue for sex might just do wonders
for your sexual stamina. Guys can
screw lying on their backs, they can
screw standing, they can screw in the
shower, all on command! And per
haps the ultimate solution is to wean
your partner off of intercourse fora
while, so they can regain control over
their precocious yet short-lasting tool.
But what about if you're on the re-

ceiving end of this
situation, so to
speak? Should
you expect the
humiliated party
to return the
favor? When two
people are having
sex, and one loses
control over or
gasm, is there a
moral obligation
to ensure the
other person gets
off? This is a
deeper question,
and depends on

your reiauonsnip with your partner-in
theory, nobody should be pressured to
make the other person climax. It's im
portant to note that if you're going to
be screwing, you should at least have
ground rules established and set ex
pectations. This requires, of all things,
communication with your partner. It's
also important to note that sex doesn't
have to be about climax, it's about
feeling comfortable. Many guys like
being in control and relate this to their
dicks with feelings of inadequacy, feel
ings that are dangerous to any sexual
relationship, be it a one-night stand or
something longer.
Ensuring that these sticky situa
tions don't happen require both
partners to foster open communica
tion. patience, and a self-awareness
of one's limits. I'll still hit up the
younger men-don't get me started
on how much fun a Screw Your
Roommate can be — but until they,
or any guy, can convince me of a ma
ture understanding of sex, I'm keep
ing the Kleenex on the table right
next to my handcuffs.


Even small kids
are embarrassed
For you.
