## High culture Cultural Awareness Associates make diversity happen 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While every dorm has a myriad
of residential staff, from Resident
Assistants to Writing Tutors, only
four dorms on campus have a spe
cial staff member — the Cultural
Awareness Associate (CAA).
Started by senior Eleanor Williams,
a current intern for Volunteers in
Asia, and senior Nadia Figueroa,
the current ASSU president, the
Cultural Awareness Associates
Program is a fledgling University
program installed in residential
dorms to promote diversity and
community.
Halfway into its second year, the
program consists of four CAAs sta
tioned in Larkin, Trancos, Paloma
and Naranja. The role of the CAAs
is to bring attention to diversity is
sues and promote dialogue in the
dorms.
"Many people ask of the differ
ence between a regular resident as

sistant and a cultural awareness as
sociate," said junior Willow Yang,
one of the four CA As this year.
"We're trained specifically for
the purpose of viewing issues from
the diversity perspective, and are
thus more specialized and geared to
the job," Yang said.
While the responsibilities of
RAs range from maintaining bath
rooms to creating a social dorm
atmosphere, the CAAs' only con
cern is the development of cultur
al appreciation.
The CAAs achieve their goals
through various means. First, they
distribute information about all of
the cultural or communal events
and organizations at Stanford.
"We are given the contact lists of
all of the ethnic clubs as well as the
women's center and the Lesbian
Gay Bisexual Transgender Com
munity Resource Center," Yang
said.
Furthermore, the CAAs carry
the responsibility of viewing issues

from a more culturally analytical
perspective than other staff mem
bers might. For instance, Larkin
slightly modified the annual dorm
tradition of Valentine's Day morn
ing, in which normally, guys greet
girls with flowers and breakfast.
Because some members of the Les
bian Gay Bisexual Transgender
community have complained that
the tradition is heterosexist and ig
nores the fact that some members
may feel uncomfortable, the
Larkin's CAA changed the tradi
tion so that everyone, not just girls,
would receive flowers and breakfast
on Valentine's Day morning.
In addition, CAAs are in charge
of dorm activities related to diversi
ty and culture. While in most dorms
the RAs led the race discussion and
"crossing the line" activities, these
events were all under the direction
of the CAAs for the four dorms. On
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the
CAAs distributed free copies of the
"The Dream" by Drew Hansen to

residents. Hansen was invited to
the campus to conduct a , v alk about
the impact of King and the civil
rights movement on the overall di
versity of society.
When asked what motivated
them to become CAAs, these indi
viduals responded that they had felt
a lack of diversity-related dialogue
in their previous years.
"While Stanford is very diverse
in the sense of numbers, it isn't very
diverse in the sense of people talk
ing about diversity in the dorms,"
Yang said.
Thomas Massey, the dean of stu
dent activities, agreed that the uni
versity lacks a "catalyst for commu
nity interaction," and that the
CAAs become the source.
"Students have a lot of opportu
nities, but those opportunities all
take time. We are here as a re
minder for the importance of cul
tural issues," Massey said.
Even when not engaged in any
specific activity, the CAAs remind
students about the existence of di
versity by their mere presence.
Since the program is still in the
process of finding its place, the
CAAs admit to difficulties carry
ing out their jobs. Junior Amelia
Ngai, the CAA of Naranja, said
that it is "extremely difficult to en
gage the upperclassmen."
Interestingly enough, Yang com
plained of an opposite problem.
"Freshmen tend to not open up
as freely. Because they're search
ing fora group of friends, they want
to talk about commonalities rather
than differences," Yang said.
In order to address these issues,
the CAAs try to organize activities
in which everyone in the dorm can
participate. Moreover, they look
for fun and engaging events such as
performances rather than relying
too much on serious discussions.
Applicants for next year's staff
positions are already in the selec
tion process, and Massey happily
comments that the applicant pool
has grown.
"The program is growing slowly,
but surely," Massey said.
Next year, the board plans to put
together an organization called the
MAESTRO, which would provide
peer-to-peer counseling on issues
related to diversity and community.
As a multi-cultural alliance, the or
ganization hopes to unite those in
terested in community awareness.
The efforts of the program could
be summarized as the mission of qual
ifying "culture." Culture, in the eyes
of the CAAs, encompasses far more
than merely difference in skin color.
Fostering appreciation for and
discussion of the multitude of fac
tors that constitute an individual
and learning to acknowledge differ
ences are the key to the success of
the program.
"Culture is not just about ethnic
or racial awareness, but about
being a social being," Massey said.

four dorms on campus have a spe
cial staff member — the Cultural
Awareness Associate (CAA).
Started by senior Eleanor Williams,
a current intern for Volunteers in
Asia, and senior Nadia Figueroa,
the current ASSU president, the
Cultural Awareness Associates
Program is a fledgling University
program installed in residential
dorms to promote diversity and
community.
Halfway into its second year, the
program consists of four CAAs sta
tioned in Larkin, Trancos, Paloma
and Naranja. The role of the CAAs
is to bring attention to diversity is
sues and promote dialogue in the
dorms.
"Many people ask of the differ
ence between a regular resident as

sistant and a cultural awareness as
sociate," said junior Willow Yang,
one of the four CA As this year.
"We're trained specifically for
the purpose of viewing issues from
the diversity perspective, and are
thus more specialized and geared to
the job," Yang said.
While the responsibilities of
RAs range from maintaining bath
rooms to creating a social dorm
atmosphere, the CAAs' only con
cern is the development of cultur
al appreciation.
The CAAs achieve their goals
through various means. First, they
distribute information about all of
the cultural or communal events
and organizations at Stanford.
"We are given the contact lists of
all of the ethnic clubs as well as the
women's center and the Lesbian
Gay Bisexual Transgender Com
munity Resource Center," Yang
said.
Furthermore, the CAAs carry
the responsibility of viewing issues

from a more culturally analytical
perspective than other staff mem
bers might. For instance, Larkin
slightly modified the annual dorm
tradition of Valentine's Day morn
ing, in which normally, guys greet
girls with flowers and breakfast.
Because some members of the Les
bian Gay Bisexual Transgender
community have complained that
the tradition is heterosexist and ig
nores the fact that some members
may feel uncomfortable, the
Larkin's CAA changed the tradi
tion so that everyone, not just girls,
would receive flowers and breakfast
on Valentine's Day morning.
In addition, CAAs are in charge
of dorm activities related to diversi
ty and culture. While in most dorms
the RAs led the race discussion and
"crossing the line" activities, these
events were all under the direction
of the CAAs for the four dorms. On
Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the
CAAs distributed free copies of the
"The Dream" by Drew Hansen to

residents. Hansen was invited to
the campus to conduct a , v alk about
the impact of King and the civil
rights movement on the overall di
versity of society.
When asked what motivated
them to become CAAs, these indi
viduals responded that they had felt
a lack of diversity-related dialogue
in their previous years.
"While Stanford is very diverse
in the sense of numbers, it isn't very
diverse in the sense of people talk
ing about diversity in the dorms,"
Yang said.
Thomas Massey, the dean of stu
dent activities, agreed that the uni
versity lacks a "catalyst for commu
nity interaction," and that the
CAAs become the source.
"Students have a lot of opportu
nities, but those opportunities all
take time. We are here as a re
minder for the importance of cul
tural issues," Massey said.
Even when not engaged in any
specific activity, the CAAs remind
students about the existence of di
versity by their mere presence.
Since the program is still in the
process of finding its place, the
CAAs admit to difficulties carry
ing out their jobs. Junior Amelia
Ngai, the CAA of Naranja, said
that it is "extremely difficult to en
gage the upperclassmen."
Interestingly enough, Yang com
plained of an opposite problem.
"Freshmen tend to not open up
as freely. Because they're search
ing fora group of friends, they want
to talk about commonalities rather
than differences," Yang said.
In order to address these issues,
the CAAs try to organize activities
in which everyone in the dorm can
participate. Moreover, they look
for fun and engaging events such as
performances rather than relying
too much on serious discussions.
Applicants for next year's staff
positions are already in the selec
tion process, and Massey happily
comments that the applicant pool
has grown.
"The program is growing slowly,
but surely," Massey said.
Next year, the board plans to put
together an organization called the
MAESTRO, which would provide
peer-to-peer counseling on issues
related to diversity and community.
As a multi-cultural alliance, the or
ganization hopes to unite those in
terested in community awareness.
The efforts of the program could
be summarized as the mission of qual
ifying "culture." Culture, in the eyes
of the CAAs, encompasses far more
than merely difference in skin color.
Fostering appreciation for and
discussion of the multitude of fac
tors that constitute an individual
and learning to acknowledge differ
ences are the key to the success of
the program.
"Culture is not just about ethnic
or racial awareness, but about
being a social being," Massey said.
