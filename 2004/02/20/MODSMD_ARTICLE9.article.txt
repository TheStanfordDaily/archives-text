## The 						Draw-ma doesn't end with graduation 
### 
At Stanford, the annual housing lottery, known as the Draw, can
elicit a lot of anxiety for many undergrads. We stress about
draw numbers, getting priority, trying to figure out which dis
ability we can exploit and, most importantly, draw groups.
Who you live with is a crucial decision. That one-room quad in Xanadu
will really suck if you can't get along with your roommates, despite its
prime location on the Row. We've learned though three years of Draw
drama that the best living situations don't always involve living with your
best friends.
Freshman year, the Draw seemed so exciting. We formed our group of

six, called ourselves "Perfect 10," and
bought stupid Abercrombie t-shirts that
sported our clever name across the chest.
Well, that Perfect 10 turned out to be a not
so-perfect 1909 — that was our Draw num
ber — and our dreams of drawing into 680
Lomita were dashed into the ground. We
learned the hard way, by living in Mirrielees,
that you can't beat the Draw — the Draw al
ways wins.
The first year of Draw always presents
some unique challenges. Going abroad or
applying for staff positions aren't yet op-

tions, so everyone is in the same boat. Unless you decide to Rush. If well
planned. Rush can get you out of the Draw and into prime campus hous
ing, but it can also destroy draw groups and change the future of your Stan
ford friendships. This is especially true for girls. Sororities are much less
likely to accept entire groups of friends than are fraternities. So while eight
guys from Rinc might easily get bids at Theta Delt, six girls from Larkin
will most likely not all pledge Pi Phi.
Freshmen also can find themselves in tough binds when forming Draw
groups. Finding your niche among Stanford's diverse population can take
longer than two quarters, and many freshmen may find themselves with
out a group of people they can call their best friends. You might end up
forming a group with people in your house only because they live down
the hall. But in the span of a year, once you've met a lot more people, you
could realize that you have nothing in common with your drawmates.
These issues don't go away after freshman year, but the Draw does get
easier. By the time sophomore year Draw rolls around, there are new op
tions to consider: Going abroad, having a baby and moving into EV, and
being on staff. Sophomores have it easiest — there's virtually no pressure
to draw with anyone. Besides, most people decide this is the time to draw
unpreferred, so there's much less stress once you've resigned yourself to
shitty housing.
By junior year, you've got it down. You probably have a preferred year
left, you're no longer stupid enough to laugh in the face of the Draw and
you realize that the best places to live on campus don't always draw the
lowest. Now hopefully you don't go and screw it all up by drawing with
your best friends, because that's not the way to go. Acquaintances often
make better drawmates than best friends; maybe because you're more re
spectful of their space and you don't have years of underlying tensions that
could ignite conflict at any moment.
As seniors, you like to think you've finally escaped the horror and con
fusion that comes every spring, but really you are about to enter what we
call "Real World Draw." Instead of options like the Row, Suites, Terra,
Twain or, for those too-cool-for-school kids in a Dead House, you'll be
drawing for apartments in San Francisco, New York, Boston, Los Ange
les or, if you're lucky, Detroit. Unfortunately, you've run out of your four
years of guaranteed housing. Even though Stanford charges you fora
shoebox of a room, Manhattan isn't going to be any better — if in fact you
can find an available studio.
Sure you'll be moving to exotic locales, but so will many other Stanford
alums. (Ew, we just used the word "alums" to describe ourselves.) It can
be scary to move out on your own, so some might find it comforting to split
the rent with a familiar face from the Farm. But think long and hard be
fore you sign that lease. Just because you are going to be in the same city
as someone does not mean you two will make good roommates. Remem
ber that awkward drawgroup you ended up with after freshman year?
And there are new factors to consider in the real world. No matter how
well you get along with someone, now that you're away from campus and
providing for yourself, income discrepancies will limit your choice of
roommates. Not all Stanford grads enjoy the same income. So while your
investment banking job may afford you an apartment on the Upper East
Side, understand when your friend working fora non-profit decides to
live elsewhere.
The point is, think carefully about who you want to live with. It can
make or break your year.

Yeah, we were freshman roommates, hut have we lived together since then? Hell
no! Holla hack at ns at chrigham@stanford.edu and cciccone@stanford.edu.
