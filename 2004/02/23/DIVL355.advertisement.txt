Child:
A Novel

The renowned novelist and poet Marge Piercy tells a
contemporary love story set in the twin realms of
college and national politics. In the politically promi
nent Dickinson family, ambition comes first, and
Melissa, the third child, has always felt that she comes
last. Going away to college offers her a chance at a life
free from her brilliant mother's constant scrutiny and
her famous father s lack of interest. There she meets
Blake, a man of mixed race and apparently unknown
parentage. His adoptive parents are lawyers whose
defense of death- row cases has brought them head-to
head with Melissa's father, the former governor of
Pennsylvania who is now a U.S. senator. Melissa and
Blake's attraction is immediate; their affair, fiery. Yet
Blake is keeping a dangerous secret from Melissa, one
that could destroy the - and their families. Dealing with
themes of love, honesty, identity, and the consequences
of ambition, this thoughtful, beautifully written story is
a remarkable and provocative page-turner.
