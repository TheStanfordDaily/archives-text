# KA off probation, Sigma Chi still on
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
While the Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity was
informed on Friday that it has been taken off
housing probation, the Sigma Chi fraternity was
informed by the Greek Housing Review Board
(GHRB) that its housing probation will contin
ue until the fraternity resolves specific issues
concerning the organization and maintenance
of its house. The GHRB had placed both frater
nities on probation in February 2003, after an
annual review.
"We do not view this as a setback here at
Sigma Chi," said junior Graham Gilmer, presi
dent of the fraternity, in a press release. "The
University has given us clear goals in order to
better our chapter and we look forward to meet
ing them. We expect to be in full compliance by
spring quarter."
The GHRB recommended that Sigma Chi
improve its kitchen, summer housing manage
ment and residential education program — and
document these changes in writing — in order
to achieve a measure of sustainability. The fra
ternity plans to hire a professional hasher and
bring in a summer management team in order to
address these issues.
"Although Sigma Chi has not been taken off
housing probation at this time, I feel that they
are very close to meeting the Housed Greek

Criteria," said Joey Greenwell, associate direc
tor of student activities and fraternity advisor.
"I look forward to working with them and hav
ing them taken off housing probation in the
near future."
Because Sigma Chi has made significant
progress since its last review in areas such as
house occupancy, alumni involvement, fire
code regulations and grounds upkeep, the hous
ing probation is not being extended fora set pe
riod of time. Instead, the chapter will be re
viewed again whenever it fixes the specified
problems.
"We are confident that Sigma Chi will quick
ly address the remaining concerns identified by
the GHRB," said Jane Camarillo, director of
Residential Education.
In taking KA off housing probation, the
GHRB cited improvements in the fraternity's
leadership structure, residential education pro
gramming, a campus-wide program on date
rape on college campuses and higher-quality
community service initiatives. Similar issues
were cited by the board when KA was placed on
probation.
"We were alleged to have 'apathetic,' 'anar
chist' or 'counter-culture' attitudes so it was
mostly a matter of separating ourselves from
and overcoming certain outdated perceptions,"
said senior Doug Johnstone, K A president." We
also put effort into beefing up some programs

and conveying that we are a fully functioning
organization in areas of community service, Res
Ed and pledge education."
Housing probation does not affect a fraterni
ty's ability to organize social activities, like par
ties. Instead, housing probation is a warning call
to fraternities to improve their residential and
programming issues to avoid losing their hous
ing, which may occur after repeated years of
probation.
"[Housing probation] gave us more 'street
cred' and made us sound a lot tougher; this will
ironically probably help with rush," Johnstone
said. "Being taken off didn't come as a surprise
since we went into it totally confident because,
in our and the rest of the campus' eyes, we did
nothing egregious. At this point we are proba
bly supposed to show some contrition but the
process itself took a lot more time and energy
than making the actual changes."
Although KA's hearing took place on Feb. 3,
with the results being conveyed to Johnstone
this past Friday, he had yet to tell his house
about the findings.
"I decided not to tell anybody else because I
didn't want us to be tempted to throw a double
header penthouse party," Johnstone said.
Greek houses are subject to annual reviews
of various criteria including their financial sta-

tus, occupancy, membership, com
munity service projects, residential
programming, conduct and leader
ship. A house can be placed on
housing probation if it has a pattern
of significant shortcomings in mul
tiple areas. The University can also
chose to commend Greek chapter
houses for repeated successes in
these areas.
"The GHRB and the University
are holding housed Greek chapters
accountable to higher housing
standards expected of groups with
a subjective selection process," said
senior Doug Carter, co-chair of the
GHRB. "The reviews are evidence
to the fact that housed Greek chap
ters take the [University] expecta
tions seriously and continually
strive to improve and go beyond
what the University expects of
them."
