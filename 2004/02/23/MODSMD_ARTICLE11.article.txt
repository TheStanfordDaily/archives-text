## Changes to special fees are not enough 
### 
The special-fees legislation passed last
week by the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) will not alone solve the high fee
refund rates currently facing student groups and
the student body at large. To execute better stew
ardship of the funding system, the ASSU should
develop a more robust approval process rather
than concentrate its efforts in the belated redistri
bution of special-fees funds.
The ASSU's recent legislation placed a priority
on this belated redistribution. In an e-mail sent last
week to special-fees group leaders, the ASSU made
this action the centerpiece of its response to the
fees-system crisis. The e-mail read, "The refunds
over the refund surcharge collected by the ASSU
(to be determined by the ASSU financial manager)
will be passed to groups to cover as they can —
from reserves and potentially from the operating
budget. This last point is crucial to the overall solu
tion." If you are a member of an organization re
ceiving special-fees funds, this stipulation means
that the funds the student body voted in favor of al
locating to your organization could be confiscated
by the ASSU in order to cover the debt of the Stu
dents' Organizations Fund that the ASSU manages
and through which special-fees monies flow.
The ASSU should not delay addressing problems
each year by waiting until after they develop. A bet
ter approach is needed, given the burden that this re
sponse would impose on student organizations that
depend on special fees and, in particular, the re
sponsible groups that engage in long-term planning.
Rather, the ASSU should focus its efforts on making
the approval process to reach the ballot more stringent.
Last week's legislation does little to help the Under
graduate Senate and the GSC make distinctions be
tween student groups, besides highlighting the criteria
already considered by both bodies in their annual fund
ing decisions. The Undergraduate Senate, for instance,
added a clause to its by-laws that would encourage its
appropriations committee to consider previous refund
rates. This clause does little as is. The appropriations
committee should establish specific numeric guidelines
and mechanisms in advance — such as that groups with
refund rates in excess of 20 percent automatically not re-

ceive the appropriations committee's recommendation
to be re-placed on that year's ballot — to avoid arbitrary
decisions in the recommendation or voting stages.
In the weeks before the legislative bodies cast their
votes on special-fees ballot approvals, a special effort
should be made to consider specific additional criteria in
order that belated confiscation of student group funds no
longer is "crucial to the overall solution." We suggest
amending the ASSU's constitution so that groups are re
quired to solicit a greater number of student signatures
before they are allowed on the ballot. Currently, groups
need signatures from 10 percent of the student population
to first appear on the ballot. This number can be reached
somewhat easily bv even the smallest student organiza
tions. If this number were to be raised, however, to 30 per
cent, for example, then it would become much more dif
ficult to acquire a sufficient number of signatures.
Thus, if both of these suggested proposals were im
plemented, organizations that experienced high re
fund rates over 20 percent would automatically have
to re-petition through the signature process be placed
on the ballot again. And, it would also be more diffi
cult for such organizations to be reauthorized given a
higher signature requirement of of 30 percent.
This system would admittedly penalize smaller or
ganizations that lack the critical mass or popular sup
port necessary to network enough signatures. We
argue, however, that this is actually an added benefit of
this proposed plan. Many of the groups from which stu
dents request refunds are small and do not directly
benefit many people on campus or even many not at
Stanford. If it were more difficult to be placed on the
ballot, it would be harder for such groups to receive
special fees, and there would presumably be fewer re
fund requests as a result.
Groups that do not serve many people in our com
munity or elsewhere should be held to higher standards
than those currently in place when it comes to deter
mining whether or not they are to be placed on the bal
lot. While this is a rather far-reaching change that we
call for, we believe that dire condition of the special
fees program calls fora more drastic, long-term revision
than that which has recently been approved. And, if the
legislative bodies choose to adopt these special-fee re
visions, they should openly explain the new require
ments to campus groups so that everyone is informed.
