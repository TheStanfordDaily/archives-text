# YANKEES SUCK
## Avenge the death of Fluffy 
### 
They're dying. Fluffy.
Bushie. Chubby McNuts.
We are in the midst of
nothing short of a bona
fide squirrel-o-cide.
Dying squirrels is not an entirely
new phenomenon on a campus that
is home to more than a few rodent
related myths. The infamous suici
dal squirrel has long plagued bikers
with its ill-timed, mid-road jaunts,
and before the University invested
in window screens, the nefarious
snack-seeking black squirrels that
entered dorms to secure a tasty
bounty no doubt met unpleasant
ends. The looming threat of ethnic
cleansing on the part of gray squir
rels to consolidate their power
amongst the larger varmint popula
tion never seems to fade.
But this is different.
If you don't live around Flo
rence Moore or the mid-Row,
you're most likely unaware that a
part of your own campus has be
come a swath of death for the ro
dents that comprise a good body of
Stanford lore. However, at its epi
center, this calamity is leaving resi
dents alternately dismayed and dis
traught — and our fluffy friends
cold and stiff.
Residents of these dorms and
houses report that, over the course
of the past quarter, an abnormally
high number of squirrels — black
and gray alike — have been found
deceased in the areas surrounding
their homes. It seems this unknown
killer does not discriminate, and it
has gotten to the point that students
in this small block of campus claim it
has become rare to ever see a frol
icking squirrel at all.
But what they find almost more
discomforting than the spike in the
number of squirrel deaths are the
suspicious circumstances sur
rounding these deaths. Accounts
consistently describe the squirrels
as lying stiff in open, random
places without any signs of trau
matic injury.
One FloMo resident, who said
she has come across three dead
squirrels this quarter, was left to ask,
" Why are they all dying?"
"At first I thought they fell out of
the tree and broke their neck," she
said. "But they were not slumped on
the ground. They were all stiff, as if
they had been sitting up then keeled
over so their little bodies weren't

flattened to the ground."
If you walk into some houses
and mention the "dying squirrel

problem," you
will inevitably be
barraged with
sordid tales of
disarmingly
bizarre squirrel
deaths that have
literally trauma
tized their unfor
tunate witnesses.
A resident of
Kappa Sigma woke

one morning to a quivering squirrel
outside his window that was "scared,
laying on his back in the mulch and
convulsing, non-responsive." Wor
ried that "Fluffy" had been intoxicat
ed by a poison or pesticide, he took
the squirrel and rinsed him in the sink.
The squirrel was dead within three
hours. Fluffy now rests in a small, un
obtrusive grave in the backyard of

Kappa Sig.
Despite how
heavily this situa
tion is weighing
on the minds of
several hundred
of Stanford's un
dergraduates, the
University is not
aware of the
problem. Both
the manager of
Undergraduate
Housing Opera
tions and a repre
sentative of Uni
versity Grounds
said they did not
know about large
numbers of dead
squirrels being
found anywhere
at Stanford.
But concerned
students are start
ing to demand an
swers, especially
amid suspicions
that these deaths
could be the re
sult of pesticide use

A FloMo resident assistant has
had to contact Facilities Operations
to request the removal of a dead
squirrel at least once, and other res
idence staff are beginning to contact
housing to push fora an inquiry into
what these residents say is an un
precedented problem.

Many questions loom. "Why is
the problem so geographically iso
lated?" and "What has so suddenly
prompted this spate of fatalities?"
figure prominently. Yet one thing is
for sure — the squirrels are dying
and it ain't natural. You could claim
that what's happening is for the best.
Squirrels are a nuisance. They cause
accidents, snipe food, deface land
scapes. The list could go on.
But the experiences of the resi
dents of central campus' squirrel
killing fields have demonstrated
that Stanford students love their
squirrels — despite their trouble
some tomfoolery. This aggression
— what or whoever its perpetrator
— will not stand on a campus that
still celebrates a 4+ rating on a 5-
point scale in the Gottshall Campus
Squirrel Listings.
As the carcasses continue to rain
down upon the lawns of Kappa Sig,
the residents still think about Fluffy.
"It was gorgeous, gray and red,"

one recalled. "The most beautiful
squirrel I have ever seen."
Demand answers. Do it for
Fluffy.

they had been sitting up then keeled

A resident of
Kappa Sigma woke

one morning to a quivering squirrel
outside his window that was "scared,
laying on his back in the mulch and
convulsing, non-responsive." Wor
ried that "Fluffy" had been intoxicat

the squirrel and rinsed him in the sink.
The squirrel was dead within three
hours. Fluffy now rests in a small, un
obtrusive grave in the backyard of

Kappa Sig.

A FloMo resident assistant has
had to contact Facilities Operations
to request the removal of a dead
squirrel at least once, and other res

Squirrels are a nuisance. They cause
accidents, snipe food, deface land
scapes. The list could go on.
But the experiences of the resi

some tomfoolery. This aggression
— what or whoever its perpetrator

They're dying. Fluffy.
Bushie. Chubby McNuts.
We are in the midst of
nothing short of a bona
fide squirrel-o-cide.
Dying squirrels is not an entirely
new phenomenon on a campus that
is home to more than a few rodent
related myths. The infamous suici
dal squirrel has long plagued bikers
with its ill-timed, mid-road jaunts,
and before the University invested
in window screens, the nefarious
snack-seeking black squirrels that
entered dorms to secure a tasty
bounty no doubt met unpleasant
ends. The looming threat of ethnic
cleansing on the part of gray squir
rels to consolidate their power
amongst the larger varmint popula
tion never seems to fade.
But this is different.
If you don't live around Flo
rence Moore or the mid-Row,
you're most likely unaware that a
part of your own campus has be
come a swath of death for the ro
dents that comprise a good body of
Stanford lore. However, at its epi
center, this calamity is leaving resi
dents alternately dismayed and dis
traught — and our fluffy friends
cold and stiff.
Residents of these dorms and
houses report that, over the course
of the past quarter, an abnormally
high number of squirrels — black
and gray alike — have been found
deceased in the areas surrounding
their homes. It seems this unknown
killer does not discriminate, and it
has gotten to the point that students
in this small block of campus claim it
has become rare to ever see a frol
icking squirrel at all.
But what they find almost more
discomforting than the spike in the
number of squirrel deaths are the
suspicious circumstances sur
rounding these deaths. Accounts
consistently describe the squirrels
as lying stiff in open, random
places without any signs of trau
matic injury.
