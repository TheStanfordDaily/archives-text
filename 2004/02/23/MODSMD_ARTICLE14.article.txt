# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Make Viennese Ball more killer 
### 
Well, from the depart
ment of really bad
ideas, here's one for
how to get more fund
ing for the Viennese Ball. I hear
the event could use some dough,
and since I've been playing nothing
but "Assassins" all week with my
dorm, I got to thinking. How about
we get a sponsor for the event,
from an organization that wants to
reach to the younger crowd? No,
better than Philip Morris. I'm
thinking the National Rifle Associ
ation (NRA). ~ Hold the death
threats and hear me out. Maybe
the NRA has a water gun branch or
something. Or a paintball division.
Whatever. Anyway, we give every
one water guns with red food col
oring or some other dye that re
sembles blood. Remember, they
are NRA guns, so they are not only
fun and American, but also God
worshipping and safe.
In addition to dancing at the Vi
ennese Ball, with this sponsorship
there would be the constant fear that
the person you are dancing with is
out to kill you. I know from my own
experience with dancing that I've
often wanted to die. Now. thanks to
my new game, I can. Basically, all of
the rules of "Assassins" will be ap
plied to dancing. For the uninitiated,
"Assassins" is a game in which you
are given a target that you have to
"kill." There can be no witnesses to
the killing or else it doesn't count.
You have someone seeking to kill
you as well, so you have to watch
your back. Everyone has a water
gun, and that's your instrument of
destruction. Usually there are safe
zones — places where you can't get
killed. But in my version, there is
only the "Macarena invulnerability"
— if you're dancing the Macarena

(regardless of what song is playing),
you can't be killed. But you only get
one of these invulnerabilities, so use

it sparingly, be
cause you'll look
like a moron if
you dance the
Macarena all
night. The rules
about witnesses
also apply, so be
ware of dancing
too close. Doing
that dip might
look cool, but it

could be your last.
"Oh you were a real gas,
Jerome," she whispers into his ear
and he intricately spins her, drawing
her close. "But I'm sorry,
now you have to die."
And then — bang — red food
coloring on his nice tux. It's a
rental, Jerome, stop being such a
wussy.
My plan would draw a complete
ly different spectrum of people.
Sure you can still have your roman
tics, professional dancers, free spir
its and people with coordination.
But you also get the paranoid war
game-loving Halo fans whose acne
matches the color of the dye in the
water guns. They'd be willing to
bust a move in order to get a clear
shot at their resident assistant and
I'm sure the ladies would be more
than willing to give them a dance if
that means they got to off them af
terward. See, not only will my plan
bring greater attendance, but it will
knock down any social barriers
faster than you can say "social Dar
winism." Who says guns don't bring
people together?
And the spirit of the two events
could not be more similar. One is
a game in which you can trust no

one and the idea is to quietly ma
nipulate relationships until you
come out on top. The other is
"Assassins."
OK, so I admit that combining el
egant ballroom dancing with a cut
throat thriller game may not be the
best idea. Concealing weapons in
evening gowns can be tricky, and the
NRA would be as likely to fund a
water gun / dancing event as Charl
ton Heston would be to film another
Planet of the Apes movie. So it
looks like the planners of the Vien
nese Ball will have to find other
means to fund their event.
As much as I am mocking the
Viennese Ball —an event I have
yet to attend — I do really want to
see its tradition continue. I had
other, even sillier ideas for getting
funding for the event — such as
bake sales, a "clothing optional"
theme and getting it special-fees
money. None of these seem feasi
ble, which is a shame because a $75-
per-couple ticket price is some
thing I'm not willing to shell out.
And those paranoid Halo fans, who
can get Halo 2 for something like
$50, are certainly not going to pay
$75 to dance to a live band. So if
anyone else has a creative plan for
getting funding for the dance to
drive down the ticket prices, I'm all
ears.
I wonder if Charlton Heston
went to ballroom dances. And if he
did, I wonder if he thought, even for
a second, "Boy I wish I could be in a
movie about apes taking over the
world."

something. Or a paintball division.
Whatever. Anyway, we give every
one water guns with red food col
oring or some other dye that re
sembles blood. Remember, they
are NRA guns, so they are not only
fun and American, but also God
worshipping and safe.
In addition to dancing at the Vi
ennese Ball, with this sponsorship
there would be the constant fear that
the person you are dancing with is
out to kill you. I know from my own
experience with dancing that I've
often wanted to die. Now. thanks to
my new game, I can. Basically, all of
the rules of "Assassins" will be ap
plied to dancing. For the uninitiated,
"Assassins" is a game in which you
are given a target that you have to
"kill." There can be no witnesses to
the killing or else it doesn't count.
You have someone seeking to kill
you as well, so you have to watch
your back. Everyone has a water
gun, and that's your instrument of
destruction. Usually there are safe
zones — places where you can't get
killed. But in my version, there is
only the "Macarena invulnerability"
— if you're dancing the Macarena

(regardless of what song is playing),
you can't be killed. But you only get
one of these invulnerabilities, so use

it sparingly, be
cause you'll look
like a moron if
you dance the
Macarena all
night. The rules
about witnesses
also apply, so be
ware of dancing
too close. Doing
that dip might
look cool, but it

could be your last.
"Oh you were a real gas,
Jerome," she whispers into his ear
and he intricately spins her, drawing
her close. "But I'm sorry,
now you have to die."
And then — bang — red food
coloring on his nice tux. It's a
rental, Jerome, stop being such a
wussy.
My plan would draw a complete
ly different spectrum of people.
Sure you can still have your roman
tics, professional dancers, free spir
its and people with coordination.
But you also get the paranoid war
game-loving Halo fans whose acne
matches the color of the dye in the
water guns. They'd be willing to
bust a move in order to get a clear
shot at their resident assistant and
I'm sure the ladies would be more
than willing to give them a dance if
that means they got to off them af
terward. See, not only will my plan
bring greater attendance, but it will
knock down any social barriers
faster than you can say "social Dar
winism." Who says guns don't bring
people together?
And the spirit of the two events
could not be more similar. One is
a game in which you can trust no

one and the idea is to quietly ma
nipulate relationships until you
come out on top. The other is
"Assassins."
OK, so I admit that combining el
egant ballroom dancing with a cut
throat thriller game may not be the
best idea. Concealing weapons in
evening gowns can be tricky, and the
NRA would be as likely to fund a
water gun / dancing event as Charl
ton Heston would be to film another
Planet of the Apes movie. So it
looks like the planners of the Vien
nese Ball will have to find other
means to fund their event.
As much as I am mocking the
Viennese Ball —an event I have
yet to attend — I do really want to
see its tradition continue. I had
other, even sillier ideas for getting
funding for the event — such as
bake sales, a "clothing optional"
theme and getting it special-fees
money. None of these seem feasi
ble, which is a shame because a $75-
per-couple ticket price is some
thing I'm not willing to shell out.
And those paranoid Halo fans, who
can get Halo 2 for something like
$50, are certainly not going to pay
$75 to dance to a live band. So if
anyone else has a creative plan for
getting funding for the dance to
drive down the ticket prices, I'm all
ears.
I wonder if Charlton Heston
went to ballroom dances. And if he
did, I wonder if he thought, even for
a second, "Boy I wish I could be in a
movie about apes taking over the
world."

Well, from the depart
ment of really bad
ideas, here's one for
how to get more fund
ing for the Viennese Ball. I hear
the event could use some dough,
and since I've been playing nothing
but "Assassins" all week with my
dorm, I got to thinking. How about
we get a sponsor for the event,
from an organization that wants to
reach to the younger crowd? No,
better than Philip Morris. I'm
thinking the National Rifle Associ
ation (NRA). ~ Hold the death
threats and hear me out. Maybe
the NRA has a water gun branch or
something. Or a paintball division.
