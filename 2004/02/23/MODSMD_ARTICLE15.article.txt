## Palmer, Ramsey proof of NFL's impatience 
### 
The recent word out of Cincinnati is that Carson
Palmer will unseat incumbent veteran Jon
Kitna as the Bengals' starting quarterback in
2004, while Patrick Ramsey is furious that the
Redskins are demoting him to clipboard duty after their
signing of the ancient Mark Brunell.
So what's the big deal? NFL teams make more per
sonnel moves than a frenetic backgammon player,
after all.
The thing is, neither of these moves make immedi
ate sense.
Now, 1 am a tremendous Carson Palmer fan. Who
wouldn't want a quarterback who has "got a strong arm,
throws with tremendous accuracy and timing, runs
through his receiver progressions with ease, finds his
backs and tight ends with great success and displays
poise in and out of the pocket."
I wrote that in this space last April, so you can rest as
sured that I was on and remain on the Palmer bandwag
on. And rightfully so; anyone who watched Palmer play
at Southern California knows just how good he is.
OK, so Palmer rocks more than a

tag sale at Carson Pirie Scott. But
Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis
needs to remember who is, in large
part, responsible for the Bengals'
turnaround from perennial doormat
to a scrappy, 8-8 squad that wasn't
eliminated from the playoffs until the
regular season's final weekend.
It certainly wasn't Palmer, who
didn't take a snap last season. It was
Jon Kitna, former Seahawk and long-

suffering Cincinnati veteran.
So when I found out that Lewis had hinted strongly
that Palmer would unseat Kitna in time for spring work
outs with the first unit, I was surprised and disappointed.
Lewis said Palmer, No. 1 overall draftee that he is.
had to play at some point (the guy did earn $11 million
last year, while Kitna's cap hit is about a third of that).
"Our guys are going to have to deal with that at some
point," Lewis said. "And Jon is well aware of that."
But Kitna dealt with Palmer breathing down his neck
last year, too. And Lewis never had cause to replace
him, because Kitna led the Bengals' resurgence. After
all, how could Lewis bench a guy who was being men
tioned as a possible NFL MVP candidate by the nation
al media?
Jon Kitna's not some retread who the talented
Palmer will easily outshine. Kitna threw for 26 touch
downs last year. Care to guess who threw for more?
Reigning NFL co-MVP Peyton Manning and three
time NFL MVP Brett Favre.
And that's it.
I fully believe that Palmer has the ability to eventual
ly make Kitna's very solid numbers (87.4 passer rating
last year) look pedestrian. But what's the hurry? It is
often pointed out that Chad Pennington is the only first
round quarterback since the 1 NFL-AFL merger not
to start a game in his first two seasons.
Well, look how that turned out in 2002, Pennington's
first year as a starter: 22 touchdowns against six inter
ceptions and an astounding 104.2 passer rating.
If I were Lewis, I'd say the job was Kitna's to lose.
That way, if Palmer falters or Kitna shines in minicamp,
you haven't painted yourself into a corner. But I can un
derstand where Lewis is coming from. While he may be
having a tremendous run playing high-card with Kitna's
jack of hearts, he's got Palmer's ace of spades in his back
pocket.
What I don't understand is what Joe Ciibbs thinks
he's doing with Mark Brunell and Patrick Ramsey.
Ramsey is widely regarded as a solid quarterback with
excellent development potential. He was tolerable last
year (75.8 rating) and is entering his third year in the
league — usually the make-or-break season for young
quarterbacks, when they are expected to be able to com
pete and win rather than just go in there, get sacked,
throw picks and complete other aspects of the typical
young quarterback's "learning experience."
So what do the Redskins do? They go out and sign
what is essentially a three-year deal with a 33-year-old
quarterback who, in a wonderful bit of irony, lost his job
to a rookie last year in Jacksonville.
Does this make sense to you?
Brunell is a solid, remarkably consistent player, who
has posted an 80-something passer rating each of the last
six seasons.
He's also 33, an age at which players' performances
very rarely do anything but decline. Furthermore, he's
replacing a player who the Redskins put a lot of effort
into grooming for the starting quarterback job, like,
this season.
So you spend two painful years throwing Ramsey
into games, forcing him to learn on the job and watching
him perform pretty decently, all-in-all. Then, just when
it's his time to shine, you bring in a guy who's eight years
older and. it's worth mentioning, a guy whose signing
bonus ($8.6 million) is larger than the entire five-year
value of Ramsey's own contract ($7.2 million).
Not surprisingly, Ramsey wants out of Washington.
And the Redskins are acting surprised and saying they
don't want to trade him.
So what does all this show? More than anything, it
proves that the NFL is unpredictable and inconsistent in
how it treats its young quarterbacks.
It can be said, though, that both Lewis and Gibbs
are looking to jumpstart their offenses — Lewis wants
to find out just how good Palmer is, while Gibbs
doesn't want to enter his first year back in the NFL
wondering if Ramsey will be able to take Washington
to the next level.
It can also be said that both men probably should've
been a little more patient.

Palmer will easily outshine. Kitna threw for 26 touch
downs last year. Care to guess who threw for more?
Reigning NFL co-MVP Peyton Manning and three
time NFL MVP Brett Favre.
And that's it.
I fully believe that Palmer has the ability to eventual
ly make Kitna's very solid numbers (87.4 passer rating
last year) look pedestrian. But what's the hurry? It is
often pointed out that Chad Pennington is the only first
round quarterback since the 1 NFL-AFL merger not
to start a game in his first two seasons.
Well, look how that turned out in 2002, Pennington's
first year as a starter: 22 touchdowns against six inter
ceptions and an astounding 104.2 passer rating.
If I were Lewis, I'd say the job was Kitna's to lose.
That way, if Palmer falters or Kitna shines in minicamp,
you haven't painted yourself into a corner. But I can un
derstand where Lewis is coming from. While he may be
having a tremendous run playing high-card with Kitna's
jack of hearts, he's got Palmer's ace of spades in his back
pocket.
What I don't understand is what Joe Ciibbs thinks
he's doing with Mark Brunell and Patrick Ramsey.
Ramsey is widely regarded as a solid quarterback with
excellent development potential. He was tolerable last
year (75.8 rating) and is entering his third year in the
league — usually the make-or-break season for young
quarterbacks, when they are expected to be able to com
pete and win rather than just go in there, get sacked,
throw picks and complete other aspects of the typical
young quarterback's "learning experience."
So what do the Redskins do? They go out and sign
what is essentially a three-year deal with a 33-year-old
quarterback who, in a wonderful bit of irony, lost his job
to a rookie last year in Jacksonville.
Does this make sense to you?
Brunell is a solid, remarkably consistent player, who
has posted an 80-something passer rating each of the last
six seasons.
He's also 33, an age at which players' performances
very rarely do anything but decline. Furthermore, he's
replacing a player who the Redskins put a lot of effort
into grooming for the starting quarterback job, like,
this season.
So you spend two painful years throwing Ramsey
into games, forcing him to learn on the job and watching
him perform pretty decently, all-in-all. Then, just when
it's his time to shine, you bring in a guy who's eight years
older and. it's worth mentioning, a guy whose signing
bonus ($8.6 million) is larger than the entire five-year
value of Ramsey's own contract ($7.2 million).
Not surprisingly, Ramsey wants out of Washington.
And the Redskins are acting surprised and saying they
don't want to trade him.
So what does all this show? More than anything, it
proves that the NFL is unpredictable and inconsistent in
how it treats its young quarterbacks.
It can be said, though, that both Lewis and Gibbs
are looking to jumpstart their offenses — Lewis wants
to find out just how good Palmer is, while Gibbs
doesn't want to enter his first year back in the NFL
wondering if Ramsey will be able to take Washington
to the next level.
It can also be said that both men probably should've
been a little more patient.

The recent word out of Cincinnati is that Carson
Palmer will unseat incumbent veteran Jon
Kitna as the Bengals' starting quarterback in
2004, while Patrick Ramsey is furious that the
Redskins are demoting him to clipboard duty after their
signing of the ancient Mark Brunell.
So what's the big deal? NFL teams make more per
sonnel moves than a frenetic backgammon player,
after all.
The thing is, neither of these moves make immedi
ate sense.
Now, 1 am a tremendous Carson Palmer fan. Who
wouldn't want a quarterback who has "got a strong arm,
throws with tremendous accuracy and timing, runs
through his receiver progressions with ease, finds his
backs and tight ends with great success and displays
poise in and out of the pocket."
I wrote that in this space last April, so you can rest as
sured that I was on and remain on the Palmer bandwag
on. And rightfully so; anyone who watched Palmer play
at Southern California knows just how good he is.
OK, so Palmer rocks more than a

tag sale at Carson Pirie Scott. But
Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis
needs to remember who is, in large
part, responsible for the Bengals'
turnaround from perennial doormat
to a scrappy, 8-8 squad that wasn't
eliminated from the playoffs until the
regular season's final weekend.
It certainly wasn't Palmer, who
didn't take a snap last season. It was
Jon Kitna, former Seahawk and long-

suffering Cincinnati veteran.
So when I found out that Lewis had hinted strongly
that Palmer would unseat Kitna in time for spring work
outs with the first unit, I was surprised and disappointed.
Lewis said Palmer, No. 1 overall draftee that he is.
had to play at some point (the guy did earn $11 million
last year, while Kitna's cap hit is about a third of that).
"Our guys are going to have to deal with that at some
point," Lewis said. "And Jon is well aware of that."
But Kitna dealt with Palmer breathing down his neck
last year, too. And Lewis never had cause to replace
him, because Kitna led the Bengals' resurgence. After
all, how could Lewis bench a guy who was being men
tioned as a possible NFL MVP candidate by the nation
al media?
Jon Kitna's not some retread who the talented
Palmer will easily outshine. Kitna threw for 26 touch
