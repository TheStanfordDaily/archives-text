# No. 10 Card wins final home game
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Whenever the No. 10 Stanford women's basketball team (20-5,13-3
Pacific 10 Conference) faces UCLA (15-11,10-7), it always seems like se
nior forward Nicole Powell has something special ready. Last season, she
sunk a jumper with 2.3 seconds remaining to lift the Cardinal to an 80-78
victory at Pauley Pavilion. In Stanford's visit to Pauley this season, Pow
ell scored 27 points and pulled down 14 rebounds to lead the Cardinal to
an overtime win.
And in the All-American's last game at Maples Pavilion, things would
be no different. Powell had 14 points, 15 boards and two blocks to lead
the Cardinal to a 63-54 win over the Bruins on the emotionally charged
Senior Day.
Prior to the game, a short ceremony was held to honor Stanford's
three departing seniors— Powell, center Chelsea Trotter and forward
Katie Denny.
"I didn't really know how I'd feel today and I really didn't expect to
cry," Powell said. "This has been such a special experience for my whole
family. I think it was emotional for all of the seniors, but we had to get fo
cused because UCLA is a good team and they don't care if it's Senior
Day or whatever."
And in the first half, Powell and the Cardinal may have let the day's
emotions get the best of them. Stanford shot just 34.5 percent and went
into the locker room trailing by two. 26-24. Powell had just four points
and two rebounds and was forced to the bench for the remainder of the
half after picking up her second personal foul with 6:29 to go.
But Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer issued a challenge at half
that the team took to heart.
"Coach told us at halftime, 'You guys have to play like a champi
onship team,' and that's what our goal is, so I think we came out [in
the second half] and played like that," junior forward Sebnem Kimy
acioglu said.
Kimyacioglu was one of the players who responded directly to that
challenge. She scored 11 of her 13 points in the second half, including
two key threes during an eight-minute, 20-6 Stanford run.
The entire tempo of the game changed in the second half — and that
began with Powell's play. Powell absolutely cleaned up on the defensive
glass, pulling down 11 defensive boards in the second half alone. And
after almost every rebound, she was able to push the ball up the court at
breakneck speed and either create fora teammate or finish herself.
"Nicole's such a good player, I knew we couldn't keep her under
wraps like we did in the first half," UCLA head coach Kathy Olivier said.
"In the second half she really looked to be more aggressive and got some
really key rebounds, really key rebounds that kept the momentum and
kept the crowd into it."
During the heart of the Cardinal run, after one of those "key re
bounds," Powell took the ball coast to coast fora layup in traffic, bring
ing the crowd to its feet and forcing a UCLA timeout.
Despite what seemed like a decisive Stanford run, the Bruins still had

some gas left and went on an 13-2
run of their own, trimming the Car
dinal lead to just three points.
But like so many other occasions,
Powell had the answers to UCLA's
runs. With just over three minutes
remaining, the Bruins put on a full
court press, hut the Cardinal re
sponded well and found a wide-open

trey to put Stanford up by six.
Kimyacioglu sealed Stanford's
victory with her third three of the af
ternoon, stretching the Cardinal's
lead to nine with just 1:18 to go.
And while the offensive firepow
er of Powell and Kimyacioglu —
along with juniors Kelley Suminski

and T'Nae Thiel, who finished with
13 and 10 points, respectively — is
what jumps out from the box score,
the Cardinal's defense proved to be
just as important.
Stanford held guard Noelle
Ouinn, the overwhelming favorite
for Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, to
17 points on 5-of-19 shooting,
breaking her six-game streak of 20
or more points.
The Cardinal also limited the ef
fectiveness of sophomore guard
Nikki Blue, who dominated the last
meeting between the two teams with
25 points and seven rebounds. On
Saturday, Blue managed just seven
points and four rebounds.
Stanford will travel to Ore
gon next weekend with a one
game lead over Arizona in con
ference play. The Cardinal faces
Oregon on Thursday and Ore
gon State on Saturday.
