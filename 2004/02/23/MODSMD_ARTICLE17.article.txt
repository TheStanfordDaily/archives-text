# Baseball wins, Fuld reaches 300
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
All told, it wasn't a bad day for senior
centerfielder Sam Fuld.
Fuld became only the fifth Stanford
player to reach 300 hits yesterday when he
led off the seventh inning with a single up
the middle, his second hit of the day. No, 4
Stanford went on to win easily, 8-1, to take
the rubber game of a three-game set with
No. 6 Texas.
"1 wasn't really thinking about [300 hits]
too much," said Fuld, who received a stand
ing ovation from both the Stanford and
Texas sides of the season-high crowd of
2,872. "It was more about doing the things
that I needed to do to help our team win."
Fuld stole second and came around to
score, then picked up the leather, went out
to centerfield and made a spectacular
Willie Mays-esque basket catch, doubling
off the runner on second base, who, think
ing the ball would not be caught, was
halfway down the third-base line.
"It was an ugly catch, and not exactly a
pretty hit either, but it works," Fuld said.
The same could be said of the series.
The fact that Stanford was able to take two
of three games from Texas despite batting
a meager .208 speaks to the team's ability to
capitalize on Longhorn mistakes — of
which there were many. Texas committed
10 errors, allowing Stanford to score 21
runs — eight of them unearned — on only
20 hits.
It was not good baseball — at times
it was downright ugly — but it got the
job done.
"We didn't hit the ball that well," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "We got some
timely hitting on Friday and some big hits
today, but they did a good job shutting
down our bats."
Stanford took advantage of its opportu
nities yesterday, scoring more runs (eight)
than it had hits (seven) and leaving only
two on base. The Cardinal won, 7-4, on Fri
day, scoring four unearned runs.
The two wins were sandwiched around a
9-6 loss on Saturday.
Mark Romanczuk and David O'Hagan
combined on a five-hitter to start the series

off, giving Stanford a 7-4 win.
"All three of my pitches were going
pretty well, especially later in the game,"
said Romanczuk, who retired the last nine
batters he faced.
He gave up four runs, two of them
earned, on five hits and struck out eight.
O'Hagan struck out five batters in two in
nings of work to earn his second save of
the year.
The Longhorns' defensive troubles
began in the bottom of the first inning of
Friday's game, when they committed two
on the same play, allowing the Cardinal to
score three unearned runs.
After Fuld walked to lead off the inning,
third baseman Johnny Ash hit a ground
ball to Texas first baseman Curtis Thigpen.
Thigpen threw to second to start the double
play, but the ball hit Fuld in the back and
bounced into left field. Leftfielder Nathan
Warrick's throw to third sailed wide, allow
ing Fuld to score and moving Ash to sec
ond. Ash came around to score two batters
later on a triple by John Mayberry Jr.
"They gave us a bit more than they're
normally going to give us," Marquess said,
referring to the runs the Cardinal was able
to score off of defensive miscues by Texas
over the course of the series.
Texas scored two runs in the top of the
second and added two more in the third
on a J.D. Reininger home run by to take a
4-3 lead.
Stanford reclaimed the lead in the bot
tom of that inning when catcher Donny
Lucy drove in two with a two-out single
with the bases loaded and right fielder
Brian Hall banged another single to score
one more run. Stanford picked up another
unearned run in the bottom of the fifth,
keyed by an errant pickoff throw by pitcher
J.P. Howell.
Stanford had its lfr-game home win
ning streak snapped on Saturday, losing 9-
6. The offense struggled, getting some
timely hits but collecting only six of them.
Starter Jeff Gilmore, who allowed seven
runs, took the loss.
At the beginning of the game, Stanford
was able to answer Texas's rallies. The

Freshman righty Matt Leva pitches the ball. The baseball team beat Texas in two out of
three games at Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Longhorns struck first in the top of
the first on a two-run home run by
shortstop Michael Hollimon, but the
Cardinal struck back with three in the
bottom half on one hit, three walks
and a hit batsman.
Texas scored two more runs in
the third on three hits before Stan
ford tied the game in the bottom
half. Rightfielder Brian Hall
reached first on a throwing error by
Hollimon, stole second and ad
vanced to third when the throw from
catcher Taylor Teagarden sailed
into the outfield. Hall came around

to score on a sacrifice fly by Chris
Minaker two batters later.
Stanford could not keep up with
Texas the rest of the way. however.
The Longhorns banged out three
more runs in the fourth and added
two in the sixth off of reliever Matt
Manship to take a 9-4 lead.
Stanford scored two runs in the
eighth to cut the lead to 9-6, then
mounted a two-out rally in the
ninth when freshman Jim Rappa
port, hitting for Hall, lined a single
to right — the first hit of his career.
Sorgi walked and Minaker, the po
tential tying run, singled to load the
bases. Fuld, however, struck out
looking to end it.
Sunday, though, belonged to Fuld
and freshman pitcher Blake Holler.
Marquess may have found the third

starter he's been searching for in
Holler, a spindly lefty, who got the
call to start on Sunday.
He had a stellar outing, allowing
only one run on three hits in six in
nings, striking out five.
"I was pleased with Holler," Mar
quess said. "He was a little wired up
in the first couple of innings, hut he
settled down."
Holler walked three batters in the
first two innings but had little trouble
finding the strike zone thereafter.
"We had great defense," Holler
said. "It was easy to let them do
the work."
Sophomore Kodiak Quick fin
ished the game off with three score
less innings to record the save.
The Cardinal scored a run in the
second with the help of two more

Texas errors and got two more on a
line-drive home run by John May
berry Jr., his fourth, that rocketed
over the leftfield scoreboard.
A towering Lowrie home run
to right center capped a four-run
fifth inning and gave Stanford a
commanding 7-1 lead.
Fuld recorded his 30()th hit in the
seventh and came around to score.
"He gives us stability," Mar
quess said of his senior centerfield
er. "Him coming back [for his se
nior year] was the biggest thing
that happened to this program this
year."
Stanford will play an exhibition
against Rikkio University — a

9-6 loss on Saturday.
Mark Romanczuk and David O'Hagan
combined on a five-hitter to start the series

off, giving Stanford a 7-4 win.
"All three of my pitches were going
pretty well, especially later in the game,"
said Romanczuk, who retired the last nine
batters he faced.
He gave up four runs, two of them
earned, on five hits and struck out eight.
O'Hagan struck out five batters in two in
nings of work to earn his second save of
the year.
The Longhorns' defensive troubles
began in the bottom of the first inning of
Friday's game, when they committed two
on the same play, allowing the Cardinal to
score three unearned runs.
After Fuld walked to lead off the inning,
third baseman Johnny Ash hit a ground
ball to Texas first baseman Curtis Thigpen.
Thigpen threw to second to start the double
play, but the ball hit Fuld in the back and
bounced into left field. Leftfielder Nathan
Warrick's throw to third sailed wide, allow
ing Fuld to score and moving Ash to sec
ond. Ash came around to score two batters
later on a triple by John Mayberry Jr.
"They gave us a bit more than they're
normally going to give us," Marquess said,
referring to the runs the Cardinal was able
to score off of defensive miscues by Texas
over the course of the series.
Texas scored two runs in the top of the
second and added two more in the third
on a J.D. Reininger home run by to take a
4-3 lead.
Stanford reclaimed the lead in the bot
tom of that inning when catcher Donny
Lucy drove in two with a two-out single
with the bases loaded and right fielder
Brian Hall banged another single to score
one more run. Stanford picked up another
unearned run in the bottom of the fifth,
keyed by an errant pickoff throw by pitcher
J.P. Howell.
Stanford had its lfr-game home win
ning streak snapped on Saturday, losing 9-

timely hits but collecting only six of them.
Starter Jeff Gilmore, who allowed seven
runs, took the loss.

Freshman righty Matt Leva pitches the ball. The baseball team beat Texas in two out of
three games at Sunken Diamond this weekend.
Longhorns struck first in the top of
the first on a two-run home run by
shortstop Michael Hollimon, but the
Cardinal struck back with three in the
bottom half on one hit, three walks
and a hit batsman.
Texas scored two more runs in
the third on three hits before Stan
ford tied the game in the bottom
half. Rightfielder Brian Hall
reached first on a throwing error by
Hollimon, stole second and ad
vanced to third when the throw from
catcher Taylor Teagarden sailed
into the outfield. Hall came around

to score on a sacrifice fly by Chris
Minaker two batters later.
Stanford could not keep up with
Texas the rest of the way. however.
The Longhorns banged out three
more runs in the fourth and added
two in the sixth off of reliever Matt
Manship to take a 9-4 lead.
Stanford scored two runs in the
eighth to cut the lead to 9-6, then
mounted a two-out rally in the
ninth when freshman Jim Rappa
port, hitting for Hall, lined a single
to right — the first hit of his career.
Sorgi walked and Minaker, the po
tential tying run, singled to load the
bases. Fuld, however, struck out
looking to end it.
Sunday, though, belonged to Fuld
and freshman pitcher Blake Holler.
Marquess may have found the third

starter he's been searching for in
Holler, a spindly lefty, who got the
call to start on Sunday.
He had a stellar outing, allowing
only one run on three hits in six in
nings, striking out five.
"I was pleased with Holler," Mar
quess said. "He was a little wired up
in the first couple of innings, hut he
settled down."
Holler walked three batters in the
first two innings but had little trouble
finding the strike zone thereafter.
"We had great defense," Holler
said. "It was easy to let them do
the work."
Sophomore Kodiak Quick fin
ished the game off with three score
less innings to record the save.
The Cardinal scored a run in the
second with the help of two more

Texas errors and got two more on a
line-drive home run by John May
berry Jr., his fourth, that rocketed
over the leftfield scoreboard.
A towering Lowrie home run
to right center capped a four-run
fifth inning and gave Stanford a
commanding 7-1 lead.
Fuld recorded his 30()th hit in the
seventh and came around to score.
"He gives us stability," Mar
quess said of his senior centerfield
er. "Him coming back [for his se

that happened to this program this
year."
Stanford will play an exhibition
against Rikkio University — a
Japanese team —at Sunken Dia
mond on Tuesday, the last home
game they will play for over a month.
All told, it wasn't a bad day for senior
centerfielder Sam Fuld.
Fuld became only the fifth Stanford
player to reach 300 hits yesterday when he
led off the seventh inning with a single up
the middle, his second hit of the day. No, 4
Stanford went on to win easily, 8-1, to take
the rubber game of a three-game set with
No. 6 Texas.
"1 wasn't really thinking about [300 hits]
too much," said Fuld, who received a stand
ing ovation from both the Stanford and
Texas sides of the season-high crowd of
2,872. "It was more about doing the things
that I needed to do to help our team win."
Fuld stole second and came around to
score, then picked up the leather, went out
to centerfield and made a spectacular
Willie Mays-esque basket catch, doubling
off the runner on second base, who, think
ing the ball would not be caught, was
halfway down the third-base line.
"It was an ugly catch, and not exactly a
pretty hit either, but it works," Fuld said.
The same could be said of the series.
The fact that Stanford was able to take two
of three games from Texas despite batting
a meager .208 speaks to the team's ability to
capitalize on Longhorn mistakes — of
which there were many. Texas committed
10 errors, allowing Stanford to score 21
runs — eight of them unearned — on only
20 hits.
It was not good baseball — at times
it was downright ugly — but it got the
job done.
"We didn't hit the ball that well," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "We got some
timely hitting on Friday and some big hits
today, but they did a good job shutting
down our bats."
Stanford took advantage of its opportu
nities yesterday, scoring more runs (eight)
