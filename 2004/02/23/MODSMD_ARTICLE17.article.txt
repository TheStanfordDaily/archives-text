# Baseball wins, Fuld reaches 300
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
All told, it wasn't a bad day for senior
centerfielder Sam Fuld.
Fuld became only the fifth Stanford
player to reach 300 hits yesterday when he
led off the seventh inning with a single up
the middle, his second hit of the day. No, 4
Stanford went on to win easily, 8-1, to take
the rubber game of a three-game set with
No. 6 Texas.
"1 wasn't really thinking about [300 hits]
too much," said Fuld, who received a stand
ing ovation from both the Stanford and
Texas sides of the season-high crowd of
2,872. "It was more about doing the things
that I needed to do to help our team win."
Fuld stole second and came around to
score, then picked up the leather, went out
to centerfield and made a spectacular
Willie Mays-esque basket catch, doubling
off the runner on second base, who, think
ing the ball would not be caught, was
halfway down the third-base line.
"It was an ugly catch, and not exactly a
pretty hit either, but it works," Fuld said.
The same could be said of the series.
The fact that Stanford was able to take two
of three games from Texas despite batting
a meager .208 speaks to the team's ability to
capitalize on Longhorn mistakes — of
which there were many. Texas committed
10 errors, allowing Stanford to score 21
runs — eight of them unearned — on only
20 hits.
It was not good baseball — at times
it was downright ugly — but it got the
job done.
"We didn't hit the ball that well," head
coach Mark Marquess said. "We got some
timely hitting on Friday and some big hits
today, but they did a good job shutting
down our bats."
Stanford took advantage of its opportu
nities yesterday, scoring more runs (eight)
than it had hits (seven) and leaving only
two on base. The Cardinal won, 7-4, on Fri
day, scoring four unearned runs.
The two wins were sandwiched around a
9-6 loss on Saturday.
Mark Romanczuk and David O'Hagan
combined on a five-hitter to start the series

off, giving Stanford a 7-4 win.
"All three of my pitches were going
pretty well, especially later in the game,"
said Romanczuk, who retired the last nine
batters he faced.
He gave up four runs, two of them
earned, on five hits and struck out eight.
O'Hagan struck out five batters in two in
nings of work to earn his second save of
the year.
The Longhorns' defensive troubles
began in the bottom of the first inning of
Friday's game, when they committed two
on the same play, allowing the Cardinal to
score three unearned runs.
After Fuld walked to lead off the inning,
third baseman Johnny Ash hit a ground
ball to Texas first baseman Curtis Thigpen.
Thigpen threw to second to start the double
play, but the ball hit Fuld in the back and
bounced into left field. Leftfielder Nathan
Warrick's throw to third sailed wide, allow
ing Fuld to score and moving Ash to sec
ond. Ash came around to score two batters
later on a triple by John Mayberry Jr.
"They gave us a bit more than they're
normally going to give us," Marquess said,
referring to the runs the Cardinal was able
to score off of defensive miscues by Texas
over the course of the series.
Texas scored two runs in the top of the
second and added two more in the third
on a J.D. Reininger home run by to take a
4-3 lead.
Stanford reclaimed the lead in the bot
tom of that inning when catcher Donny
Lucy drove in two with a two-out single
with the bases loaded and right fielder
Brian Hall banged another single to score
one more run. Stanford picked up another
unearned run in the bottom of the fifth,
keyed by an errant pickoff throw by pitcher
J.P. Howell.
Stanford had its lfr-game home win
ning streak snapped on Saturday, losing 9-
6. The offense struggled, getting some
timely hits but collecting only six of them.
Starter Jeff Gilmore, who allowed seven
runs, took the loss.
At the beginning of the game, Stanford
was able to answer Texas's rallies. The
