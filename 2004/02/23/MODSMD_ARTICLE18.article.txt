# L.A. rain delays tennis action

The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (8-0)
headed south to face Loyola Marymount and Pepper
dine last weekend, expecting sunny skies and solid wins.
But apparently, when the Cardinal brings the com
petitive heat to Los Angeles, it also brings pouring rain
and three-hour delays.
Match play never began against Pepperdine, and
there have certainly been more satisfying wins than the
6-0 closeout of No. 63 Loyola.
"We had finished introductions and were warming up
for doubles when it started pouring," freshman Theresa
Logar said. "[After waiting for so long], we were kind of
lushed and I don t think anybody played exceedingly
well."
Despite the setback, Logar posting a 6-2,6-1 win over
Patrycia Hubl in the No. 5 singles slot.
Logar is currently ranked 84th in the nation, and has
not dropped a match since losing to Oregon's No. 8
Daria Panova, in a three-set, round of 16 battle at the
Northwest ITA Regional Championships.
With an intimidating 15-2 record, Logar leads the
team in individual wins.
Back at Manhattan Country Club, Logar's team
mates all followed suit, recording straight-set victories
over the remaining Lions.
Sophomore Amber Liu defeated Carla Arguelles in
the top singles slot, 6-1, 6-0.
Liu was ranked second nationwide in the preseason,
before taking time off to compete in the professional
circuit.
Right behind in the No. 2 singles position, sopho
more Alice Barnes dispatched of Robyn Baker with the
same score.
Seventh-ranked Erin Burdette, a junior, stumbled at
first in her second set against Kimi Kaloi, who held a 3-

0 lead.
But Burdette bounced back, stopping Kaloi dead in
her tracks to clinch the No. 3 singles match, 6-1, 6-3.
Senior Lauren Barnikow, junior Story Tweedie-
Yates and freshman Anne Yelsey also competed on Fri
day.
Yelsey, who usually focuses on doubles, played at
No. 6 singles in hopes of gaining more experience in the
arena. Ranked at No. 72, Yelsey recorded a swift 6-1, 6-
1 victory over Serena Fermin, improving her singles
record to 8-3.
Due to the inclement conditions, all of the doubles
matches went undecided.
The leading tandem of Barnikow and Burdette re
mains ranked at No. 6, standing 6-0 in dual match play
and 13-1 overall.
Yelsey and partner Emilia Anderson, a senior, follow
in the doubles rankings at No. 17. The two are 5-0 in
dual match play and 8-1 overall.
Match play against the Waves has been postponed in
definitely, but should be rescheduled soon after the
match against No. 21 Fresno State, which was cancelled
last Tuesday due to rain.
Fresno State will revisit the Cardinal on March 4th.
After a slowed and sporadic week, Stanford will have
to shift back into high gear for the start of grueling Pa
cific* 10 Conference competition.
The Cardinal will face off against No. 42 Oregon at
Taube Family Tennis Stadium this Friday, before head
ing across the bay to take on No. 4 California on Sunday.
"1 think we're ready for [Pac-IOJ after getting tested
at Indoors against Washington," Logar said. "They
came out ready to play, points were tight, but we won
out in the end."
Taking this week's detours in stride, Logar added,
"If anything, the weather conditions [we faced] boosted
our confidence. We had to overcome the adversity, and
we did."
