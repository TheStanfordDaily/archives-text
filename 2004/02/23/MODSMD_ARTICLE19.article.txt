# Water polo blows out Irvine, escapes LBSU
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
8-1 and 8-7. One score shows the smothering of a
team. The other score? A little too close for comfort.
They were two very different ways of winning, but for
tunately for the No. 3 Stanford women's water polo team
(5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) both
games mean the same thing in the records, a win against
conference opponents.
The Cardinal started the weekend with an easy 8-1
win against UC-Irvine (5-6, 1-3) Saturday morning at
Avery Aquatic Center. The Cardinal got out to an early
lead in the first with a goal from sophomore Nancy El-
Sakkary off a 6-on-5 offense. That began the surge of of
fense the Cardinal showed in the first period as shots by
junior Hannah Luber, freshman Christine Hewko,
sophomore Scotti Shafer and a second goal from El-
Sakkary brought the score to 5-0.
Those goals would prove to be enough for the win as
long as Stanford could provide good defense.
Well, it provided more than just good defense.
"Our main goal in all games is to play good defense,
and that's what [won this] game because our goals come
out on their own," Shafer said.
Accomplishing what it set out to do, Stanford showed
stellar defense as it kept the Anteaters scoreless for the
first, second and third periods. In fact, the Anteaters' only
score came with one second left in the fourth period.
The Anteaters did manage to improve their defense as
the game went on. Irvine goalkeeper Sunceray Cham
blee totaled 11 saves on the game.
Things proved to be more than a bit harder in Sunday
afternoon's game when Stanford faced No. 4 Long Beach
State (5-1, 1-1). In what could have been an easier game
for Stanford, Long Beach was able to put pressure on the
Stanford defense and offense with its aggressive attacks.
The Cardinal got on the board first with a four-meter
penalty shot by Shafer after a foul from Tara Campbell.

The 49ers quickly struck back with a 6-on-5 goal by senior
Angelica Garcia and then another shot by junior Drue
Wawryznski. The Cardinal tied things up at the end of the
first as freshman Alison Gregorka took an outside shot
from two meters.
While Stanford freshman goalkeeper Meredith Mc-
Coll kept Long Beach at bay, Stanford took a 4-2 lead in
the second half off goals from Hansen and Shafer. Things
then got complicated as the game took on a quick back
and-forth pace. The 49ers opened with a hard shot from
Garcia followed by Wawryznski's goal into an unguard
ed cage to tie the game at 4-4.
"We got a two-goal lead at half and did a really poor
job defensively our first two possessions in the third peri
od," Stanford head coach John Tanner said. "We just had
the feeling that if we could get back to the two-goal lead
we would have control over the game."
As Tanner advised his players to be patient, the game
got tighter and ended regulation play with a 6-6 tie.
"We felt like we had so many options in our offense
that we were looking to do too many things in each pos
session," he said.
Trying to simplify his offense. Tanner continued the
successful advise into overtime.
In the first period of overtime, the Cardinal came out
with a simpler goal in mind. Senior Wendy Watkins sur
prised the 49ers with a backhand shot to score first in
overtime.
Watkins helped build the Cardinal lead by assisting
Luber, who scored from two meters off the crossbar to
make it 8-6. Despite attempts to come back, including a
goal in the sixth period by Wawryznski, the 49ers could
do nothing more.
Even though it pulled out with a win, Stanford be
lieves the game didn't have to go into overtime. The Sun
day nailbiter could have been a mirror of Saturday's
match.
"We could have held them a lot more just by playing
more consistently," Shafer said.
