# Pac-10 Champs!

### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Top-ranked
and still-undefeated Stanford has expected to
win the Pacific-10 Conference title fora while
now. which is perhaps the reason why the Car
dinal (23-0.13-0 Pacific-10 Conference) didn't
celebrate all that much after its title-clinching,
73-60 win over UCLA (11-12,7-8).
There were no loud displays of euphoria.
No frenzied yells or outbursts or post-game
locker room celebratory charades.
No, not this year, not with this team.
"Fora lot of people in [our locker room],
this is the first Pac-10 title, and that's exciting,"
sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez said.
"But we kind of knew it was just a matter of
time."
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery
concurred.
"I'm really proud of our guys." he said.
"We felt like we could win [the conference
title] and we wanted to win it here."
Junior center Rob Little led all scorers and
rebounders with a career-high 18 points and
seven boards and was one of four Stanford
players who scored 14 or more points. Junior
forward Nick Robinson added a career-high
15 points, while both junior Josh Childress and
senior Matt Lottich added 14 apiece.
"Rob stayed out of foul trouble, he fin-

ished, he battled inside," Hernandez said.
"He's capable of doing that every day."
Interestingly enough, UCLA has beaten a
top-ranked team in each of the last four sea
sons — twice beating Stanford, ending the
2000-2001 Cardinal squad's record 20-game
winning streak — a fact that many thought set
the stage for an intriguing Saturday game.
However, when it was all said and done, it
seemed like just another UCLA-Stanford
game at Pauley Pavilion, where Stanford has
won seven in a row (something no other Bru
ins opponent has ever done).
In the first half, the Bruins stuck to their
methodical half-court offense — weaving the
ball around the perimeter, waiting until the
shot clock reached the 10-second mark before
attacking the basket.
They didn't fastbreak.
They didn't take quick shots.
And they didn't score easy buckets in
transition.
And that was the difference in the first half
— and in the game.
That was the difference between a 23-point
first half for UCLA (19 points fewer than the
Cardinal managed) and the Bruins' 37-point
second half, which was six points better than
Stanford's.
In the first half, while UCLA busied itself

with wins over USC and UCLA.
with meaningless perimeter passes
that often forced Bruin guards into
difficult man-to-man situations with
the clock winding down, the Cardi
nal moved the ball around with pur
pose on the opposite end, hitting
cutters and wide-open players under
the basket for easy scores.
UCLA found out quite early that
you can't come out slow against
good teams — that you can't ap
proach the game with a throwaway
offense in the hopes of simply hang
ing around for awhile, waiting op
portunistically to make your move
— certainly not against a team that
was shooting as well as Stanford was
in the first half.
In the opening period, Stanford
had nine assists on 18 field goals,
shot 60.9 percent from the field and
went 4-of-5 from behind the arc,
while UCLA went 10-of-23 from the
field and shot a dismal 14.3 percent
from long range.
"The first half, we were very
good," Montgomery said matter
of-factly.
UCLA scored its 23rd point
when seven-foot center Michael Fey
hit a 12-foot baseline jumper with
6:01 left to play in the half.
The bucket brought the Bruins
within five points of the Cardinal,

28-23, and represented the last
points scored by UCLA in the
half.
With the Bruins stuck on 23,
Stanford took advantage — knock
ing down free throws, converting
easy hook shots in the post and
burying tough jumpers.
Lottich found a wide-open Lit
tle underneath the basket and Lit
tle converted the easy layup just
before the buzzer sounded.
The layup culminated a 14-0
Stanford run to end the half.
"The whole first half, we moved
the ball around extremely well,"
Hernandez said. "We kind of picked
apart the defense."
The second half was a slightly dif
ferent story, although the change
didn't affect the outcome at all.
A tentative first-half UCLA
squad, which found itself down by
19 at the break and unable to score
fora substantial portion of the first
period, came out of the locker room
at the half with a more aggressive
motion offense that actually chal
lenged the Cardinal (which was
switching between man and zone)
fora stretch.
The Bruins even came within
seven points after Ryan Hollins rat
tled in a shot from the post with
14:33 remaining.
To a certain extent, however,
Stanford forced the Bruins to move
into a more up-tempo game. The
Cardinal opened the second half
with four turnovers, all of which led

to UCLA field goals in transition.
Turning it over "gave them
some stuff," Montgomery said. It
"gave them the opportunity to get
back in it.
"I thought UCLA made some
good adjustments to attack [the
zone], but it just changed the pace,"
he continued. "The main thing was
that they scored off turnovers."
But seven points was as close as
the Bruins would get as Stanford
countered by scoring on its next four
possessions before Lottich and Her
nandez combined for three crowd
silencing treys in two minutes.
The buckets stretched Stanford's
lead to 64-46 with 6:34 remaining.
The Cardinal has four games re
maining in its Pac-10 schedule.
Next week, Stanford will play
Oregon State and Oregon at
Maples Pavilion on Thursday and
Saturday, respectively, before trav
eling to face the Washington
schools the following week to
round out the regular season.
We want to make history," Little
said. "Why not go out to win them
all? It's a personal goal for everyone
now, with four games left, to go un
defeated. Why not?"
Most of the UCLA crowd
didn't stick around to celebrate
the win, the streak or the Pac-10
title as Bruin fans began to exit
with about three minutes remain
ing in the game.
But, then again, they didn't miss a
huge party.
