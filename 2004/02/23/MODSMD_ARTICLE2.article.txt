# Pac-10 Champs!

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Top-ranked
and still-undefeated Stanford has expected to
win the Pacific-10 Conference title fora while
now. which is perhaps the reason why the Car
dinal (23-0.13-0 Pacific-10 Conference) didn't
celebrate all that much after its title-clinching,
73-60 win over UCLA (11-12,7-8).
There were no loud displays of euphoria.
No frenzied yells or outbursts or post-game
locker room celebratory charades.
No, not this year, not with this team.
"Fora lot of people in [our locker room],
this is the first Pac-10 title, and that's exciting,"
sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez said.
"But we kind of knew it was just a matter of
time."
Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery
concurred.
"I'm really proud of our guys." he said.
"We felt like we could win [the conference
title] and we wanted to win it here."
Junior center Rob Little led all scorers and
rebounders with a career-high 18 points and
seven boards and was one of four Stanford
players who scored 14 or more points. Junior
forward Nick Robinson added a career-high
15 points, while both junior Josh Childress and
senior Matt Lottich added 14 apiece.
"Rob stayed out of foul trouble, he fin-

ished, he battled inside," Hernandez said.
"He's capable of doing that every day."
Interestingly enough, UCLA has beaten a
top-ranked team in each of the last four sea
sons — twice beating Stanford, ending the
2000-2001 Cardinal squad's record 20-game
winning streak — a fact that many thought set
the stage for an intriguing Saturday game.
However, when it was all said and done, it
seemed like just another UCLA-Stanford
game at Pauley Pavilion, where Stanford has
won seven in a row (something no other Bru
ins opponent has ever done).
In the first half, the Bruins stuck to their
methodical half-court offense — weaving the
ball around the perimeter, waiting until the
shot clock reached the 10-second mark before
attacking the basket.
They didn't fastbreak.
They didn't take quick shots.
And they didn't score easy buckets in
transition.
And that was the difference in the first half
— and in the game.
That was the difference between a 23-point
first half for UCLA (19 points fewer than the
Cardinal managed) and the Bruins' 37-point
second half, which was six points better than
Stanford's.
In the first half, while UCLA busied itself
