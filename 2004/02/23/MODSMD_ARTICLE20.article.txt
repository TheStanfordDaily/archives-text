### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
Today, the Stanford women's golf team begins
play at the Wildcat Invitational in Tucson, Ariz.,
with a brand-new No. 25 ranking and the makings of
a championship team.
After its 11 th-place finish against a talented field
two weeks ago, the Cardinal has joined the ranks of
the elite in the Golfweek / Sagarin Collegiate Rank
ings. Head coach Caroline O'Connor is impressed
by her team's desire to improve and cites an exam
ple from a recent practice session.
"Our strength coach sent them on a fast-paced
three-mile run," she said. "When they returned he
was only going to put them through an ab workout,
rather than our typical circuit training and ab
workout. They requested to go through the entire
circuit."
This week, Stanford returns to the course in Ari
zona to see if its hard work on the practice range can
continue to pay off in competition.
For the third straight year, the event will take
place at the par-71, 6.134-yard Arizona National
Golf Course. The course was designed by famed golf
architect Robert Trent Jones Jr. and has been hon
ored in numerous publications.
Arizona National will offer players the generous
fairways and ample opportunity to pile up birdies, as
is typical of most desert courses.
With a talented field in town for this event, the
Cardinal could quickly find itself in a shootout.
"Arizona National is not as long as other golf
courses we play," senior Angie Rho said. "As a re
sult, it gives players opportunities to hit some great
approach shots. As always, great putting will lower
scores and increase overall confidence."
Along with Rho, O'Connor sends senior Kim

Kouwabunpat, sophomore Kelly Husted and fresh
men Jenni Tangtiphaiboontana and Lauren Todd.
Sophomore Stephanie Lue will compete in the event
as an individual but her score will not contribute to
the team total.
Though not as power-packed as the field at Stan
ford's last event, this week's group certainly has the
potential to post some very low scores. No. 2 UCLA
and No. 6 California will be among the 14 teams
competing, as weli as host-team Arizona, which is
ranked No. 3 in the country. No. 19 Pepperdine will
be defending its title at this year's tournament.
The individual competition should be dominated
by two big names: Arizona's Erica Blasberg and
UCLA's Charlotte Mayorkas.
Blasberg, a sophomore, is this year's defending
champion and was arguably the hottest golfer in
the country this fall, winning three consecutive
tournaments, and is currently ranked No. 3 in the
nation.
Mayorkas, a junior, comes off a victory at the
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, where she
set an all-time UCLA scoring record and bested
Blasberg, who finished in 11th place. Mayorkas also
collected Golfweek's inaugural Player of the Week
Award for her efforts.
Stanford finished fifth at last year's tourna
ment, led by Rho, who turned in a seventh-place
performance.
Todd said that the Cardinal's success this week
will be dictated by what happens above the shoulders.
"Sometimes I think we falter if we worry about
the outcome," she said. "If we stay confident and re
mind ourselves that previous rounds or shots do not
dictate future rounds or shots, we will play well this
week."
With hard work and attention to detail, outcomes
should be nothing to worry about this week.
