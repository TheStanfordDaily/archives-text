# No. 10 women's hoops shows improvement in wins

### ERIN ARCHERD SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For all of No. 10 Stanford's (20-5, 13-3 Pacific-10
Conference) shortcomings, this weekend's matchups
against UCLA and USC illustrated that the Cardinal has
been addressing its (laws — and improvement is finally
beginning to show.
Stanford gave its fans a scare at Arizona, dropping
two games in outings that seemed dispirited and poorly
executed. The loss to USC no longer looked like a learn
ing experience, but the start of a disturbing pattern.
But as the conference season draws to a close, it looks
liked the Cardinal has started to learn its lesson. It came
out strong this past weekend against the Women of Troy
and the Bruins, showing off its healthier bench and scor
ing combinations.
The post and perimeter finally appeared united in
efforts that allowed the whole team to get the ball to
the basket.

The Cardinal's offensive execution was sharp against
the L.A. teams. The Cardinal shot 50 percent against
USC, and managed to shoot 48 percent in the second
half against UCLA's pressure defense.
The Cardinal, simply put, was running its plays and
making its shots. And this paid off big against UCLA,
which wasn't. The Bruins came out strong in the first
half, leading the Cardinal by a basket at the half. But
they collapsed in the second, failing to sink their shots
and allowing Stanford to go on a 20-5 run.
Stanford's perimeter play was back this weekend,
as well.
The women shot 62.5 percent from long range against
USC, and came out in the second half against the Bruins,
sinking 6-of-12 at key junctures in the game. Junior
guard Kelley Suminski scored 16 points against USC
and 12 against UCLA. Junior forward Sebnem Kimya
cioglu was hot during Saturday's game, scoring 13 points
and shooting 3-of-4 from downtown.
In both games, the Cardinal's improved post play was

a critical part of its success. Junior forward Azella Fer
ryman contributed 17 points and 8 rebounds against the
Women of Troy, in what head coach Tara VanDerveer
called "her best game at Stanford."
And despite slow starts and fewer minutes than usual
in both games, senior forward Nicole Powell notched
back-to-back double-doubles in the final home games of
her Stanford career. She rightly emphasized the impor
tance of the team effort.
"The way we came out and played today, we proved
to ourselves that we can run with anybody," Powell said
of Saturday's performance. "I thought Sebnem was awe
some today. And our posts did a very good job. It was a
good team win."
Even the Cardinal's high turnover rate saw some im
provement over the weekend.
"I felt great about it," VanDerveer said. "Of course
you never like turnovers, [and] we had a couple that I
would like to yank back, but for the most part (UCLA
gets] a lot of steals. A total of 13, then, I think we made

our team goal."
Thirteen turnovers against the tight defense of the
Bruins shows just how far Stanford has come with its ball
handling — and with an average of 16.2 turnovers per
game for the season, 13 is a definite improvement. The
Cardinal aims for 14 or less each game.
"They're very big on the perimeter," VanDerveer
said of UCLA. "Willis and Quinn and Blue. They're
smart players. Blue right off the tip, the ball could have
been ours but she's right there and takes it away. 1 was
happy with how we took care of the ball and I think this
ought to be something for us to build on, because this has
been our number one problem, taking care of the ball."
It sounds like the Cardinal has rediscovered the atti
tude it needs to top the Pac-10 and live up to its pre-sea
son status as one of the top teams in the nation.
"It was great poise on behalf of everyone," Kimya
cioglu said of Stanford's game against UCLA. "The way
we were playing second half, we played with heart and
like a championship team."
