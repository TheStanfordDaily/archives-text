### BEN WHALEY 
Former provost James Rosse. 72,
died last Sunday, Feb. 16, in Newport
Beach, Calif., from a heart condition
following his hospitalization fora
sudden illness.
Rosse was at Stanford for 27 years,
provost for his final eight, before
leaving in 1992 to become the Presi
dent of Freedom Communications
Inc.. a media company in Irvine.
In interviews, Rosse said he loved
Stanford and loved the intensity of
being provost.
"I enjoy working, I enjoy doing
things," he told Stanford Report in
1992. "When 1 get to the point where
I can't work hard, I'll quit, but that's a
long way off."
As the University's eighth
provost, Rosse concentrated his ef
forts and made an impact on Stan
ford's budget, campus facilities, un
dergraduate curriculum and diversi
ty. Rosse devoted himself to the is
sues that truly meant something in his
heart, he said. When asked in a 1992
interview with Casa Zapata students
about what the most important lead
ership quality was, Rosse said, "In
tegrity ... Being true to what you
think is right."
Rosse became provost in Septem
ber 19N4. During his tenure, he was
quick to deprecate his work with
statements such as, "I haven't done
anything worthwhile," or spread his
credit among his many colleagues.
However, Rosse was instrumental
in dealing with the University's bud
get problems, using his unique per
sonal skills to solve problems. During
the budget crisis of the early 19905,
Rosse reduced a projected $14 mil
lion budget deficit to a mere $2 mil
lion. Rosse made budget cuts of tens
of millions of dollars from staff bud
get and operating costs to see the
University through its financial trou
bles. He also managed the $1.27 bil
lion Centennial Campaign, applying
the money to projects such as under
graduate research opportunities and
the Center for the Study of Language

and Information.
Rosse pursued diversity at Stan
ford through hiring decisions and cur
riculum reforms. Among his changes,
he started the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
Rosse reformed Stanford's gener
al curriculum to include an emphasis
on interdisciplinary study. Through
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Rosse helped in the creation
of a new system of distribution re
quirements, as well as the Western
Culture program, a precursor to the
Introduction to the Humanities
courses for freshmen. Rosse also ex
panded Stanford's programs, over
saw the creation of Stanford-in-
Washington.
Finally, Rosse helped implement
improvements throughout Stanford
and worked on the initial rebuilding
of the Main Quad after the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. Rosse drew
great pride from his work at oversee
ing new construction. The Rains
Houses, the Keck science building,
and Sweet Hall were all built on his
watch.
"Jim Rosse was provost during a
time of great growth of the Universi
ty, and also a time of great turmoil,"
said current Provost John
Etchemendy. "All of us who today
benefit from Stanford's present
strength owe much to Jim's critical
leadership during his eight years as
provost."
Rosse saw Stanford as much big
ger than the successes of failures of
any one individual.
"Whenever you get a strong
leader, you get good ideas, but you
also get mistakes," he said in his 1992
interview with the Stanford Report.
"We have an absolutely superb facul
ty. I don't think there is any place that
can even hold a candle to us, and it
goes from the senior people all the
way down to the junior people."
He added, "Stanford will be a cut
ting-edge institution fora long time
to come. The question is not, 'Will
this be an important institution?'
but. 'How important will it be in

shaping higher education over the
next 15 to 20 years?' I think it can be
very important."
Rosse began his career at Stanford
as a professor of economics and later
served as the chairman of the Eco
nomics Department. Rosse was the
first director of the Stanford Institute
for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR), and he won the dean's
award for distinguished teaching in
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences in 1976.
"If you were to ask Jim what was
his most important accomplishment,
he would say his students," said Eco
nomics Prof. John Shoven, the cur
rent director of SIEPR. "Some of his
students were like members of his
family. Here's my son, here's my stu
dent ... it was all the same to Jim. I
remember going to his retirement
party five years ago, there were a
number of his students there."
According to Shoven, the James
Rosse faculty and student lounge that
sits on the second floor of the Ralph
Landau Economics Building was
ready to be dedicated until Rosse dis
covered that they had the words in
the wrong order. "To this day, it's the
'student and faculty' lounge," Shoven
said.
Born Nov. 4,1931 in Sidney, Neb.
to James and Shirley Rosse, James
discovered early on a love for eco
nomics and mathematics as it related
to journalism (his father was a school
teacher and newspaper editor).
Rosse pursued economics through
his education with bachelors, mas
ter's and doctorate degrees, all in eco
nomics, at the University of Minneso
ta, where he was later a faculty mem
ber until coming to Stanford in 1965.
After retiring from his position at
Freedom Communication, Inc. in
1999, Rosse lived in Irvine with his
wife Janice Rosse. The Rosse family
has three surviving children and three
grandchildren in California and Ne
braska. A memorial fund has been es
tablished for graduate students in
economics. Services were held on Fri
day, Feb. 20, in Southern California.

statements such as, "I haven't done
anything worthwhile," or spread his
credit among his many colleagues.
However, Rosse was instrumental
in dealing with the University's bud
get problems, using his unique per
sonal skills to solve problems. During
the budget crisis of the early 19905,
Rosse reduced a projected $14 mil
lion budget deficit to a mere $2 mil
lion. Rosse made budget cuts of tens
of millions of dollars from staff bud
get and operating costs to see the
University through its financial trou
bles. He also managed the $1.27 bil
lion Centennial Campaign, applying
the money to projects such as under
graduate research opportunities and
the Center for the Study of Language

and Information.
Rosse pursued diversity at Stan
ford through hiring decisions and cur
riculum reforms. Among his changes,
he started the University Committee
on Minority Issues.
Rosse reformed Stanford's gener
al curriculum to include an emphasis
on interdisciplinary study. Through
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. Rosse helped in the creation
of a new system of distribution re
quirements, as well as the Western
Culture program, a precursor to the
Introduction to the Humanities
courses for freshmen. Rosse also ex
panded Stanford's programs, over
saw the creation of Stanford-in-
Washington.
Finally, Rosse helped implement
improvements throughout Stanford
and worked on the initial rebuilding
of the Main Quad after the 1989
Loma Prieta earthquake. Rosse drew
great pride from his work at oversee
ing new construction. The Rains
Houses, the Keck science building,
and Sweet Hall were all built on his
watch.
"Jim Rosse was provost during a
time of great growth of the Universi
ty, and also a time of great turmoil,"
said current Provost John
Etchemendy. "All of us who today
benefit from Stanford's present
strength owe much to Jim's critical
leadership during his eight years as
provost."
Rosse saw Stanford as much big
ger than the successes of failures of
any one individual.
"Whenever you get a strong
leader, you get good ideas, but you
also get mistakes," he said in his 1992
interview with the Stanford Report.
"We have an absolutely superb facul
ty. I don't think there is any place that
can even hold a candle to us, and it
goes from the senior people all the
way down to the junior people."
He added, "Stanford will be a cut
ting-edge institution fora long time
to come. The question is not, 'Will
this be an important institution?'
but. 'How important will it be in

shaping higher education over the
next 15 to 20 years?' I think it can be
very important."
Rosse began his career at Stanford
as a professor of economics and later
served as the chairman of the Eco
nomics Department. Rosse was the
first director of the Stanford Institute
for Economic Policy Research
(SIEPR), and he won the dean's
award for distinguished teaching in
the School of Humanities and Sci
ences in 1976.
"If you were to ask Jim what was
his most important accomplishment,
he would say his students," said Eco
nomics Prof. John Shoven, the cur
rent director of SIEPR. "Some of his
students were like members of his
family. Here's my son, here's my stu
dent ... it was all the same to Jim. I
remember going to his retirement
party five years ago, there were a
number of his students there."
According to Shoven, the James
Rosse faculty and student lounge that
sits on the second floor of the Ralph
Landau Economics Building was
ready to be dedicated until Rosse dis
covered that they had the words in
the wrong order. "To this day, it's the
'student and faculty' lounge," Shoven
said.

Rosse pursued economics through
his education with bachelors, mas

nomics, at the University of Minneso
ta, where he was later a faculty mem

tegrity ... Being true to what you
think is right."
