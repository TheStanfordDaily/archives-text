# Study notes lack of women profs

A recent survey of faculty demographics at U.S. research uni
versities presents evidence that the long-standing under-repre
sentation of women and minorities in sciences and engineering
continues to persist. The study, conducted by Dr. Donna Nelson
and Diana Rogers at the University of Oklahoma, shows that al
though undergraduate and graduate student compositions have
become more diverse, faculties remain nearly homogeneous.
A report on the status of women faculty will come before the
University Faculty Senate March 4. The interim report issued by
the Provost's committee last May said that among lab equip
ment, funding and pay, "there seems to be no pattern of dispar
ity that suggests any systemic gender inequity."
While the interim report pointed out a number of ways Stan
ford could improve its recruitment and retention of women fac
ulty, it also noted significant improvements from ten years ago,
when Stanford's percentage of female faculty was quite low
compared to peer institutions.
Under-representation in the sciences and engineering
"We have no women on our faculty," said Prof. Bruce
Clemens, chair of the Materials Science and Engineering De
partment, citing one example. "It's a deplorable situation that
we're trying hard to fix."
The survey by Nelson and Rogers sampled 14 departments at
50 top research universities. Stanford was included for eight de
partments: mathematics, computer science, electrical, civil, me
chanical and chemical engineering, chemistry and psychology.
Nelson and Rogers found that, for the 50 top research schools
in 2002, only eight percent of faculty in math are female; six per
cent in physics; and 10 percent in computer science.
The number of women earning doctorates in these fields is
not reflected in the number of junior faculty. In chemistry, for
example, though women earned 30 percent of the doctorates
over the last decade, only 20 percent of junior faculty members
are women.
Even in fields like psychology, where over 75 percent of bach
elor's degrees go to women, only 33 percent of faculty members

are women, according to the study.
Such facts can have a particularly negative effect on female
undergraduates. One study found that, for undergraduate
women, the best predictor of their success was the percentage of
women faculty at their school.
And for minority women, the numbers are even grimmer. As
of 2002, there were no black female faculty members in physics
at any of the top 50 research universities.
This also means that there were no racially representative
mentors for black female undergraduates.
The same goes for Hispanic women in computer science or
Native American women in all science and engineering fields ex
cept psychology and chemistry, in which there are only four Na
tive American women.
"Coming from Mexico, I never thought of these issues," said
Liliana Quintanar, a doctoral student in chemistry. "There, the
chemistry faculty is half female."
Nelson and Rogers noted that female faculty members are
necessary to decrease attrition rates of female students in sci
ences and engineering.
"We firmly feel that everyone in our department would ben
efit from having women on our faculty," Clemens said.
Why aren't women entering academia?
"A number of things contribute to it, one being sexist bias," said
Sabrina Burmeister, a post-doctoral researcher in psychology.
"It's not an appealing environment for women or other mi
norities," said Biological Sciences Prof. Joan Roughgarden. "It's
harder for women to see themselves as part of a group that
doesn't value what they have to offer."
Evidence suggests that some of the difficulties for women in
academia stem from discriminatory hiring practices â€” Profs.
Christine Wenneras and Agnes Wold from the Sahlgrenska
University Hospital in Sweden found that female post-doctoral
research applicants had to produce twice as many publications as
their male counterparts to have their applications rated equally.
Academic promotions also reflect a disparity between gen-
