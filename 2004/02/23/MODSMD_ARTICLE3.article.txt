# Study notes lack of women profs

### KERRY GRENS 
A recent survey of faculty demographics at U.S. research uni
versities presents evidence that the long-standing under-repre
sentation of women and minorities in sciences and engineering
continues to persist. The study, conducted by Dr. Donna Nelson
and Diana Rogers at the University of Oklahoma, shows that al
though undergraduate and graduate student compositions have
become more diverse, faculties remain nearly homogeneous.
A report on the status of women faculty will come before the
University Faculty Senate March 4. The interim report issued by
the Provost's committee last May said that among lab equip
ment, funding and pay, "there seems to be no pattern of dispar
ity that suggests any systemic gender inequity."
While the interim report pointed out a number of ways Stan
ford could improve its recruitment and retention of women fac
ulty, it also noted significant improvements from ten years ago,
when Stanford's percentage of female faculty was quite low
compared to peer institutions.
Under-representation in the sciences and engineering
"We have no women on our faculty," said Prof. Bruce
Clemens, chair of the Materials Science and Engineering De
partment, citing one example. "It's a deplorable situation that
we're trying hard to fix."
The survey by Nelson and Rogers sampled 14 departments at
50 top research universities. Stanford was included for eight de
partments: mathematics, computer science, electrical, civil, me
chanical and chemical engineering, chemistry and psychology.
Nelson and Rogers found that, for the 50 top research schools
in 2002, only eight percent of faculty in math are female; six per
cent in physics; and 10 percent in computer science.
The number of women earning doctorates in these fields is
not reflected in the number of junior faculty. In chemistry, for
example, though women earned 30 percent of the doctorates
over the last decade, only 20 percent of junior faculty members
are women.
Even in fields like psychology, where over 75 percent of bach
elor's degrees go to women, only 33 percent of faculty members

are women, according to the study.
Such facts can have a particularly negative effect on female
undergraduates. One study found that, for undergraduate
women, the best predictor of their success was the percentage of
women faculty at their school.
And for minority women, the numbers are even grimmer. As
of 2002, there were no black female faculty members in physics
at any of the top 50 research universities.
This also means that there were no racially representative
mentors for black female undergraduates.
The same goes for Hispanic women in computer science or
Native American women in all science and engineering fields ex
cept psychology and chemistry, in which there are only four Na
tive American women.
"Coming from Mexico, I never thought of these issues," said
Liliana Quintanar, a doctoral student in chemistry. "There, the
chemistry faculty is half female."
Nelson and Rogers noted that female faculty members are
necessary to decrease attrition rates of female students in sci
ences and engineering.
"We firmly feel that everyone in our department would ben
efit from having women on our faculty," Clemens said.
Why aren't women entering academia?
"A number of things contribute to it, one being sexist bias," said
Sabrina Burmeister, a post-doctoral researcher in psychology.
"It's not an appealing environment for women or other mi
norities," said Biological Sciences Prof. Joan Roughgarden. "It's
harder for women to see themselves as part of a group that
doesn't value what they have to offer."
Evidence suggests that some of the difficulties for women in
academia stem from discriminatory hiring practices — Profs.
Christine Wenneras and Agnes Wold from the Sahlgrenska
University Hospital in Sweden found that female post-doctoral
research applicants had to produce twice as many publications as
their male counterparts to have their applications rated equally.
Academic promotions also reflect a disparity between gen-
dcrs nationwide only a quarter of women faculty in
sciences and engineering receive tenure as opposed to
halt ot male faculty, according to the Commission on Pro
fessionals in Science and Technology.
Cathy Trower and Richard Chait wrote in Harvard
Magazine in 2002 that the tenure system needs to be re
formed. Old views used to determine who receives tenure
favor competition, research and autonomy; Trower and
Chait suggest that these views should be replaced by
more contemporary ideas favoring cooperation, collabo
ration, teaching and advising.
Additionally, I rower and Chait point out, women
tend to serve on a lot of committees and prioritize office
hours, which cannot be quantified like the number of
publications or grants.
In addition to low hiring rates, lack of recognition and
overlooked promotions, women earn less money than men.
Over the past several decades the gap in salaries has actual
ly widened — to a $12,000 difference at private schools in
2001 — despite larger numbers of women on faculty.
"When female professors are not hired, treated fairly,
and retained, female students perceive that they will be
treated similarly," Nelson and Rogers wrote. "This dis
suades them from persisting in that discipline."
According to Prof. Suzanne Pfeffer, chair of the Bio
chemistry Department, "Women are deciding to do other
things, work in biotech, education or law, and many of

them are choosing to pursue careers that give them more
time to build families."
Burmeister also noted that one factor pulling women
away from academia may be their desire to start families.
"The coincidence in time between beginning an acad
emic career and childbearing are nearly one to one, and
women choose to have more balanced lives," Burmeister
said.
Some universities like Stanford try to accommodate
parents by extending the tenure clock one year. Addi
tionally, many universities offer affordable childcare and
discounts on college tuition.
Making academia more agreeable to child bearing has
only had marginal effects, and women continue to choose
other careers, according to the study.
"In a recent faculty search we received 300 applica
tions, of which about 25 percent were women," Pfeffer
said. "This was a real surprise to me since graduate stu
dents and post-doctoral researchers in the medical sci
ences are 50 / 50."
Some fields suffer from an overall under-repre
sentation of women, from undergraduates to faculty.
In electrical engineering, for example, only 11 per
cent of doctorates earned in the past decade have
gone to women.
"One concern I have is that, at least domestically,
young girls are not encouraged to study engineering,"
said Prof. Bruce Wooley, chair of the Electrical Engi
neering Department.
This lack of encouragement seems to trickle up to col
leges, where only 13 percent of bachelor's degrees in elec
trical engineering are given to women.
"I would not have gone into chemistry without en
couragement," Cheyenne Brindle, a graduate student in

chemistry, noted.
A future fora diverse faculty
Major steps are being taken to beef up the numbers
and ensure proper representation of women on faculty at
Stanford. Some departments actively seek out women
and ask them to apply fora faculty position.
Deborah Rhode, a law school professor who chairs the
Provost's committee on the status of women faculty, told
The Daily last year that the University is committed to in
creasing diversity.
"I think there's been a great deal of effort by the ad
ministration to try to ensure gender equity in hiring and
promotion and retention, and a variety of strategies have
really begun to pay off," Rhode said.
This new approach has included efforts ranging from
"broadening the search process and ensuring that the
candidate pools are diverse and that the process proceeds
fairly" to structural changes like day-care services and
better accommodations for spouses.
According to Roughgarden, rooting out sexism from
acadeinia, however, is something that is rarely attempted.
" It comes down to the heart," she said. "If straight white
men are in denial that injustices take place here on campus
or in surrounding communities we will not get anywhere."
Many departments are slowly becoming more diverse.
The percentage of doctorates in the sciences and engi
neering earned by women has increased steadily for the
past 30 years. Astronomy, for example, has increased the
number of female doctorates from 12 percent from 1983
to 1992 to 20 percent from 1993 to 2002.
Despite their small numbers, women have made enor
mous impacts on science.

Tin not saying it's easy fora woman to make it in science'
In a talk Thursday night to the Chemistry Depart
ment, Prof. Magdolna Hargittai from Eotvos University
in Hungary described her interviews with some of the
most famous women in science, including all three living
female Nobel laureates.
"I started interviewing women who had made it to in
spire young women," Hargittai said.
According to Hargittai, two of the Nobel laureates,
Gertrude Elion and Rita Levi Montalcini, changed the
face of science while overcoming incredible obstacles —
besides just being a woman.
Elion never completed a doctoral degree and Montal
cini was forced to leave university in Italy because she was
Jewish.
Although the talk paraded dozens of success
ful women scientists, many had faced discrimi
nation or a lack of recognition throughout their
careers.
One famous scandal that Hargittai discussed is that of
Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray picture of DNA lead to
the model of the double helix — a contribution that only
later was admitted by the men who used it and subse
quently won the Nobel Prize.
Another controversy is that of Jocelyn Bell, whose
work on pulsars helped her doctoral advisor win a Nobel
Prize. Hargittai asserted that Bell deserved to share the
prize, and pointed out that two decades later, Russell
Hulse, a male graduate student, shared the prize with his
advisor for work on pulsars.
"I'm not saying it's easy fora woman to make it in sci
ence," said Hargittai.
"But you can do it."
