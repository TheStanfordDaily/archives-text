# Reno addresses punishment

### SHAMALA GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"One of the proudest moments in my career was when a
man stopped me in a downtown building and said, 'Ms.
Reno. I want to thank you for arresting me,'" former U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno said in her keynote speech
at the Stanford Law Review's "Punishment and Its Pur
poses" Symposium on Friday.
"I told him that I didn't arrest him," she said. "He said,
'I know. But you got me into drug court. 1 got my family
and job back, and I'll never lose them again.' That's what
you're in public service for, to make the hard decisions and
to be prepared to be wrong."
As she stood before an audience so large that the Law
School had to bring in extra chairs to the classroom, Reno
outlined the importance of creating sentences that would
help offenders become constructive members of society
rather than rendering them unable to function. In order to
do that, she believes that doing research about the effects
of punishment is the correct course of action.
Reno said that the biggest problem with our system of
punishment today is that politicians use rhetoric about
sentencing that is purely political and meant to convince
the public that justice will be served.
"We will never leave the politics of crime and sentenc

ing behind until we do our level best to successfully iden
tify the best research and develop crime and sentencing
policy based on solid research," Reno said. "I think these
are the issues to study: How can punishment be most ef
fective? How can punishment do the least harm? How can
punishment enable a person to come out of the punish
ment period with his self-respect intact? How can we re
turn him to the community with the ability to function as
an independent individual?"
Reno explained that research by psychologists and
criminologists shows that when people have been in prison
fora certain amount of time, they lose their ability to make
decisions in society and function like other members of the
community.
Reno said that it was her position that prosecutors and
judges should figure out what the safe amount of time to
put a certain person in prison is and then only sentence the
offender to that amount of time.
After that, they should figure out what they need to do
to bring the person back to the community.
"We've got to address their health-care problems," said
Reno. "We've got to address their drug-treatment needs,
their mental health problems."
She added, "One of the things that troubles me is that
lawyers like to wait until the crisis
occurs."
Reno stressed the essentiality
of research into preventative
measures.
"What we have [recently]
learned about psychology stag
gers the imagination," she said.
"We understand so much about
what can be done."
However, Reno said that there
has not been enough done with
this information with regard to
both drugs and mental illness.
"We can do far more if we
work together and, with the ex
perts, find out what works and
what doesn't work," she said.
She offered the example of
training police officers how to
react. "You can make such a dif
ference if you know how to react
to a mentally ill person. Don't
pull the gun. Start talking, learn
how to talk. You can do so much
to alleviate a problem if you
[only] care and follow through."
Reno went on to address the
issue of helping children who
have grown up with violence. She
pointed out that 50 percent of
prisoners have children, half of
whom are under 10 years old.
Despite these facts, Reno said,
our system of correctional agen
cies charges the family for phone
calls home.
She said that this is true even
though it has been shown that
these calls make the parent's re
turn home after release
smoother.
To contrast, she mentioned a
New York state facility that had a
nursery in a prison.
"You can paint up and fix up a
place, but you can't put smiles on
people's faces that are phony
smiles," she said. "[ln this
prison, J the kids were bouncy and
happy and smiling. The mothers
were in great shape. They told me
again and again what a difference
it had made. They had a far bet
ter understanding and were head
ed home and were going to do it

the right way this time."
Along the same lines, she said
that an effective system of pun
ishment will never prevail if we
do not work to change behavior
while potential criminals are still
in their formative years.
"If we wait until the child has
committed a crime at 18, we may
have some success, but nowhere
near enough." she said.
"We need to develop a study
ing and research capacity to help
people who were neglected along
the way," Reno declared. "Ladies
and gentlemen, it won't be done
by punishment. It will be done by
punishment thoughtfully con
strued and thoughtfully imple
mented, but with education and
opportunity to go with it."
Reno talked about the need
for an organized system of com
petent people working together
to perform research, construct
solutions and implement them

well. She suggested hiring fewer
people in the law enforcement
system hut offering them more
money, thus creating a reason
for more qualified people to
apply.
"I have spent over 25 years in
public prosecution, and trying to
figure out the tragic, mean, evil,
funny, laughing, remarkable
human race is one of the great
challenges that any public ser
vant can have," concluded Reno
to loud applause. "But what I ask
of all of you is don't get caught up
in the numbers.
Remember that these are all
people — flesh and blood, hopes
and fears, failures and
successes — who deserve a
chance to make a difference. And
we can provide it if we come to
gether and use the best science,
the best common sense, the best
cooperation, to try to achieve our
goals."
