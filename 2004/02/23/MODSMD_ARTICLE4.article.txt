"One of the proudest moments in my career was when a
man stopped me in a downtown building and said, 'Ms.
Reno. I want to thank you for arresting me,'" former U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno said in her keynote speech
at the Stanford Law Review's "Punishment and Its Pur
poses" Symposium on Friday.
"I told him that I didn't arrest him," she said. "He said,
'I know. But you got me into drug court. 1 got my family
and job back, and I'll never lose them again.' That's what
you're in public service for, to make the hard decisions and
to be prepared to be wrong."
As she stood before an audience so large that the Law
School had to bring in extra chairs to the classroom, Reno
outlined the importance of creating sentences that would
help offenders become constructive members of society
rather than rendering them unable to function. In order to
do that, she believes that doing research about the effects
of punishment is the correct course of action.
Reno said that the biggest problem with our system of
punishment today is that politicians use rhetoric about
sentencing that is purely political and meant to convince
the public that justice will be served.
"We will never leave the politics of crime and sentenc

ing behind until we do our level best to successfully iden
tify the best research and develop crime and sentencing
policy based on solid research," Reno said. "I think these
are the issues to study: How can punishment be most ef
fective? How can punishment do the least harm? How can
punishment enable a person to come out of the punish
ment period with his self-respect intact? How can we re
turn him to the community with the ability to function as
an independent individual?"
Reno explained that research by psychologists and
criminologists shows that when people have been in prison
fora certain amount of time, they lose their ability to make
decisions in society and function like other members of the
community.
Reno said that it was her position that prosecutors and
judges should figure out what the safe amount of time to
put a certain person in prison is and then only sentence the
offender to that amount of time.
After that, they should figure out what they need to do
to bring the person back to the community.
"We've got to address their health-care problems," said
Reno. "We've got to address their drug-treatment needs,
their mental health problems."
She added, "One of the things that troubles me is that
