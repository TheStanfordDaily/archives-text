## Rhythms reverberates Multicultural dance show features new competitive dance groups 
### MELANIE CORBETT 
"Where else would I be able to per
form with a Mariachi band?" said ju
nior Richard Torres, a performer in
this year's Rhythms multicultural
show. Co-chair of hip-hop dance group
DVB, Torres also shared the stage with
a Hindi film dance team. Talisman and
Raagapella singers and Los Salseros
salsa dancers at last Saturday's show.
Rhythms, an annual show consist
ing of Stanford's various cultural per
forming arts groups, not only dis
played the school's diversity, but cele
brated it. With clapping hands, thump
ing feet, colorful costumes and pulsat
ing beats, each group was thrilled to
share its talent with each other and
with the mesmerized audience.
"This year's show was by far the
best; every act was really solid," said
senior Sonia Nijjar, who has attended
Rhythms every year. "1 liked the new
South Asian competing groups and I
thought it was really diverse."
The show on Saturday evening,
nearly packed Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Event organizer sophomore
Kosha Shah was unsure if the auditori
um would fill because fewer $8 pre
sale tickets were sold than expected.
However, enough people bought the
$10 tickets at the door.
The show was sponsored by San
skriti — the South Asian student orga
nization at Stanford. The tremendous
response to Rhythms the past two
years has made it an annual winter
quarter tradition.
Though run by Sanskriti, just five of

the 12 acts were South Asian. This was a
slight increase from last year, which in
cluded three South Asian performances.
Additions to the program from last
year included three competitive dance
teams — the Stanford Bhangra Team, the
Stanford Raas Team and the Stanford
Hindi Film Dance Team — and the newly
formed Bharat Natyam team, Noopur.
Another change this year was the
publication of a literary magazine,
"Voices." The complimentary maga
zine. which also served as the program
guide, was distributed to all audience
members. It contained various student
works of art, poetry and photography.
"We included the literary magazine
to complement the music and dance
with poetry and prose," said junior
Ashvia Kumar, co-chair of the event.
"1 thought that the magazine was in
keeping with the multicultural focus of
the show," said freshman Megan
Stacey.
In addition to promoting diversity.
Rhythms' other goal was to fight
hunger. All of the show's profits go to
the Stanford Project on Hunger
(SPOON), which tries to minimize
food waste on Stanford's campus.
"This is one of our biggest fundrais
ers," said sophomore Greg Laughlin,
SPOON's hunger awareness coordina
tor. SPOON will donate the proceeds
from the show to Oxfam America, an
organization that works with poor
communities throughout the world to
find effective and enduring solutions
to hunger, poverty and social injustice.
The show opened with Raagapella,
the South Asian a cappella group.

Raagapella incorporated South Asian
culture into its act by altering the pop
ular songs midway through by adding
Indian dialogue and singing.
The next act was a collaboration be
tween Noopur, the South-Asian classi
cal dance ensemble and Taiko, the
Japanese taiko drumming group. The
performance was a unique combina
tion of sound created by hands slap
ping on drums, dancers' feet pounding
on the floor and metal ornaments and
jewelry jangling against Costumes. The
partnership between the two groups
was received by a standing ovation.
The Hawaii Club performed tradi
tional Hawaiian songs and hula dance.
Its act opened with freshman Holo
Ho'Opai reciting a captivating Hawai
ian chant. Then the women of the
Hawaii Club came on stage for the hula
dance and the entire group came to
gether at the end to sing a closing song.
"We chose traditional styles for our
performance, like the traditional hula
dance, to break away from stereo
types," said senior member of the
Hawaii Club Ryan McCormack.
Another stellar act was PASU's tra
ditional dance from the Philippines.
PASU members performed a partner
dance showcasing the Philippino tradi
tion of women dancing with lit candles
on their heads.
The Stanford Steppers were up
next. They clapped, slapped, stomped
and pounded their way to producing a
powerful rhythm that celebrated the
African-American culture.
Following the show was "Rhythms
Revolution," the after party at Mars

planned by the Sanskriti Social Committee.
"I went to the show and it was nice
to continue the night's events at Mars
afterwards," said freshman Erin
Gaines.
Hindi Film Dance Team
Although formed just this year, the
Stanford Hindi Film Dance Team
seemed like a veteran group onstage.
This was the team's first performance
in front of a large audience. The team
will be competing at Berkeley's third
annual Hindi Film Dance Competition
on Mar. 6, where it will perform an
eight-minute dance to a mix of Bolly
wood (India's film industry) songs. It
will compete against other California
schools.
"I know we can take this dance to
the next level and make people feel as
if they're actually watching a Bolly
wood movie," said Mantri. "In the end,
for us, it is not about winning or losing.
All that matters is how much the audi
ence gets thrilled and how much fun
we have making them feel that way."
Stanford Raas Team, "Basmati Haas"
This is the first year that Basmati
Raas is an official Voluntary Student
Organization, rather than a subset
Sanskriti. The team recently placed
second in a Raas-Garba competition
hosted by UC Irvine against numerous
California schools as well as other
teams from around the country. The
team also competed last year, but did
not place in the top three teams. The
group has performed at Rhythms the
past two years.
The group promotes South Asian
culture through performing both Raas
and Garba, two folk dances from the
state of Gujarat in India.
"The group was formed to show
case the talented and amazing Stan
ford students who have participated in
Raas to the intercollegiate realm of
Raas-Garba," said team co-leader, se
nior Alap Jani.
Stanford Bhangra Team
This is the first time that Stanford
has had an official, competitive
Bhangra team in over four years. The
team is currently preparing for compe
titions that will be held at UC Davis
and UCLA in spring quarter. Each
competition will include teams from all
over California, as well as some na
tional teams.
Although it is hard to say how well
the team will do because it is so new, the
prospects look very promising. The
group has a professional coach who
used to judge competitions and started
several Bhangra competitions in the
Bay Area.
The Stanford Bhangra team focus
es on the more traditional Punjabi folk
dance. It tries to demonstrate to peo
ple how the art is actually performed in
India and also tries to shake stereo
types that many people hold of the
dance form. At the same time, it incor
porates modern styles into the chore
ography, including hip-hop.
"We are open to anyone who loves
to dance," said team leader senior
Sonia Samagh.

food waste on Stanford's campus.
"This is one of our biggest fundrais
ers," said sophomore Greg Laughlin,
SPOON's hunger awareness coordina
tor. SPOON will donate the proceeds
from the show to Oxfam America, an
organization that works with poor
communities throughout the world to
find effective and enduring solutions
to hunger, poverty and social injustice.
The show opened with Raagapella,
the South Asian a cappella group.

Raagapella incorporated South Asian
culture into its act by altering the pop
ular songs midway through by adding
Indian dialogue and singing.
The next act was a collaboration be
tween Noopur, the South-Asian classi
cal dance ensemble and Taiko, the
Japanese taiko drumming group. The
performance was a unique combina
tion of sound created by hands slap
ping on drums, dancers' feet pounding
on the floor and metal ornaments and
jewelry jangling against Costumes. The
partnership between the two groups
was received by a standing ovation.
The Hawaii Club performed tradi
tional Hawaiian songs and hula dance.
Its act opened with freshman Holo
Ho'Opai reciting a captivating Hawai
ian chant. Then the women of the
Hawaii Club came on stage for the hula
dance and the entire group came to
gether at the end to sing a closing song.
"We chose traditional styles for our
performance, like the traditional hula
dance, to break away from stereo
types," said senior member of the
Hawaii Club Ryan McCormack.
Another stellar act was PASU's tra
ditional dance from the Philippines.
PASU members performed a partner
dance showcasing the Philippino tradi
tion of women dancing with lit candles
on their heads.
The Stanford Steppers were up
next. They clapped, slapped, stomped
and pounded their way to producing a
powerful rhythm that celebrated the
African-American culture.
Following the show was "Rhythms
Revolution," the after party at Mars

planned by the Sanskriti Social Committee.
"I went to the show and it was nice
to continue the night's events at Mars
afterwards," said freshman Erin
Gaines.
Hindi Film Dance Team
Although formed just this year, the
Stanford Hindi Film Dance Team
seemed like a veteran group onstage.
This was the team's first performance
in front of a large audience. The team
will be competing at Berkeley's third
annual Hindi Film Dance Competition
on Mar. 6, where it will perform an
eight-minute dance to a mix of Bolly
wood (India's film industry) songs. It
will compete against other California
schools.
"I know we can take this dance to
the next level and make people feel as
if they're actually watching a Bolly
wood movie," said Mantri. "In the end,
for us, it is not about winning or losing.
All that matters is how much the audi
ence gets thrilled and how much fun
we have making them feel that way."
Stanford Raas Team, "Basmati Haas"
This is the first year that Basmati
Raas is an official Voluntary Student
Organization, rather than a subset
Sanskriti. The team recently placed
second in a Raas-Garba competition
hosted by UC Irvine against numerous
California schools as well as other
teams from around the country. The
team also competed last year, but did
not place in the top three teams. The
group has performed at Rhythms the
past two years.
The group promotes South Asian
culture through performing both Raas
and Garba, two folk dances from the
state of Gujarat in India.
"The group was formed to show
case the talented and amazing Stan
ford students who have participated in
Raas to the intercollegiate realm of
Raas-Garba," said team co-leader, se
nior Alap Jani.
Stanford Bhangra Team
This is the first time that Stanford
has had an official, competitive
Bhangra team in over four years. The
team is currently preparing for compe
titions that will be held at UC Davis
and UCLA in spring quarter. Each
competition will include teams from all
over California, as well as some na
tional teams.
Although it is hard to say how well
the team will do because it is so new, the
prospects look very promising. The
group has a professional coach who
used to judge competitions and started
several Bhangra competitions in the
Bay Area.
The Stanford Bhangra team focus
es on the more traditional Punjabi folk
dance. It tries to demonstrate to peo
ple how the art is actually performed in
India and also tries to shake stereo
types that many people hold of the
dance form. At the same time, it incor
porates modern styles into the chore
ography, including hip-hop.
"We are open to anyone who loves
to dance," said team leader senior
Sonia Samagh.


Stanford's Bharat Natyam team, Noopor, performs at Rhythms — an annual multicultural dance show held on Saturday
"Where else would I be able to per
form with a Mariachi band?" said ju
nior Richard Torres, a performer in
this year's Rhythms multicultural
show. Co-chair of hip-hop dance group
DVB, Torres also shared the stage with
a Hindi film dance team. Talisman and
Raagapella singers and Los Salseros
salsa dancers at last Saturday's show.
Rhythms, an annual show consist
ing of Stanford's various cultural per
forming arts groups, not only dis
played the school's diversity, but cele
brated it. With clapping hands, thump
ing feet, colorful costumes and pulsat
ing beats, each group was thrilled to
share its talent with each other and
with the mesmerized audience.
"This year's show was by far the
best; every act was really solid," said
senior Sonia Nijjar, who has attended
Rhythms every year. "1 liked the new
South Asian competing groups and I
thought it was really diverse."
The show on Saturday evening,
nearly packed Dinkelspiel Auditori
um. Event organizer sophomore
Kosha Shah was unsure if the auditori
um would fill because fewer $8 pre
sale tickets were sold than expected.
However, enough people bought the
$10 tickets at the door.
The show was sponsored by San
skriti — the South Asian student orga
nization at Stanford. The tremendous
response to Rhythms the past two
years has made it an annual winter
quarter tradition.
Though run by Sanskriti, just five of

the 12 acts were South Asian. This was a
slight increase from last year, which in
cluded three South Asian performances.
Additions to the program from last
year included three competitive dance
teams — the Stanford Bhangra Team, the
Stanford Raas Team and the Stanford
Hindi Film Dance Team — and the newly
formed Bharat Natyam team, Noopur.
Another change this year was the
publication of a literary magazine,
"Voices." The complimentary maga
zine. which also served as the program
guide, was distributed to all audience
members. It contained various student
works of art, poetry and photography.
"We included the literary magazine
to complement the music and dance
with poetry and prose," said junior
Ashvia Kumar, co-chair of the event.
"1 thought that the magazine was in
keeping with the multicultural focus of
the show," said freshman Megan
Stacey.
In addition to promoting diversity.
Rhythms' other goal was to fight
hunger. All of the show's profits go to
the Stanford Project on Hunger
(SPOON), which tries to minimize
food waste on Stanford's campus.
"This is one of our biggest fundrais
