# A 						letter to the Stanford guys

### 
Dear Stanford Boy,
Before I begin my Three-Step Romantic Success
Plan. I have some things to say:
Casual dating is OK.
Asking a girl for her number is OK.
Random hookups are not ideal.
Sitting in your room and pretending to be content
with your love life, or lack thereof, is not cool.
This column is meant to revive casual dating at Stan
ford — a practice followed by most college students, yet
one that is strangely absent on this campus. Casual dat
ing does not mean commitment. It will not limit your
freedom. It will not interfere with the pursuit of those
good grades that we all want.
From my experiences, Stanford relationships tend to
fall into two categories: random

hookups or virtual marriage. Either
two people stay together fora few
hours and pretend like nothing hap
pened between them the next day, or
they become attached at the hip from
their first date and become oblivious
to the rest of the world.
The problem with these two ex
tremes is that most people want
something in the middle — some
thing that seems nonexistent at this
school. But boys, you can do some-

thing about that. And I will tell you how ...
1. Get girls' phone numbers. If you're attracted to a
girl, getting her number can't hurt. It will keep your op
tions open in the case that you decide that you may be
ready to go on an actual date at Stanford. Although this
is a rare occurrence, it does happen. Getting a girl's num
ber can be avoided if you think that you could invite her
out personally, which is ideal, as phone conversations
have the possibility of being somewhat awkward.
2. Hang out with your girl of interest during non-class,
non-dorm-activity time. Invite her over for dinner at
your house or dining hall or for some coffee, or [for the
gutsier guys] dinner at a restaurant. This is your chance
to get to know your girl.
Dates are fun! Even if there is no chemistry or not a
lot to talk about, getting together puts you out there. It
makes us feel like normal college students who do the
normal dating things. The first "date" will give you a
much better idea as to whether or not the girl is worth
your time.
3. If the date was less than ideal, don't be aloof when
you see the girl again. If your date made you realize that
this girl probably isn't for you, it's probably (hopefully)
a mutual thing. Chemistry and awkwardness are usually
felt both ways. But, don't pretend like it never happened.
You guys can still act civilly toward each other. Being
friends is totally okay.
If the date went well, don't smother the girl. It's defi
nitely nice to give call her a few days after your date, but
don't act like the two of you married! One date, or even
a few dates, does not mean life-long commitment. The
goal here is casual dating — hanging out on an occasion
al basis and having fun.
Although dating may lead to a relationship, it doesn't
have to. Understandably, people at this school don't al
ways have the time or desire fora significant other. But
many of us want to hang out on an individual basis with
members of the opposite sex that we like. And we aren't
necessarily happy with the predominant means of doing
that — party hookups. Casual dating is the perfect, mid
dle-of-the-road solution to this problem.
I know that asking a girl for her number or out to cof
fee or dinner can be hard, but it needs to be done. Stan
ford girls aren't mean! We try to encourage proactive be
havior.
Although rejection is always a possibility, the alter
native is just too attractive and too necessary to pass up.
Do you really want to go through your college years —
those prime years of your youth — without some form
of dating?
I should hope not.
