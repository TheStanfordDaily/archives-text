Questions and photographs by
COURTNEY BRIGHAM


"CSIO6A with Prof.
Mehran Sahami. He was
really funny and made the
class entertaining. Also,
it was videotaped so if I
missed it at 9am I could
watch it later. I took Math
41, 42, and 51 from Prof.
Bray, and he was really
goocl too. It's more about
the professor than the
material."
