Like many an exclusive club, the
medical profession subjects its
prospective members to rigorous
indoctrination: medical students are
overloaded with work, deprived of
sleep and normal human contact,
drilled and tested and scheduled
down to the last minute. Difficult as
the regimen may be, for those who
don't fit the traditional mold-white,
male, middle-to-upper class, and
heterosexual-medical school can be
that much more harrowing. This
riveting book tells the tales of a new
generation of medical students-stu
dents whose varied backgrounds are
far from traditional. Their stories will
forever alter the way we see tomor
row's doctors. In these pages, a black
teenage mother overcomes seeming
ly insurmountable odds, an observant
Muslim dons the hijab during train
ing, an alcoholic hides her addiction.
We hear the stories of an Asian
refugee, a Mexican immigrant, a clos
eted Christian, an oversized woman
these once unlikely students are
among those who describe their
medical school experiences with
uncommon candor, giving a close-up
look at the inflexible curriculum, the
pervasive competitive culture, and
the daunting obstacles that come
with being "different" in medical
school. Their tales of courage are by
turns poignant, amusing, eye-open
ing-and altogether unforgettable.
