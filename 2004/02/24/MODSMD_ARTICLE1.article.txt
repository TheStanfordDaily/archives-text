## about special fees 
### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Student leaders have responded reservedly to recent legislation reform
ing the ASSU's special-fees system. Many leaders predicted that the pro
gram will be changed dramatically.
"I definitely support this legislation," said sophomore Greg Laughlin, an
officer of SPOON. "It encourages groups to actually cover their own costs.
The part I like about the legislation is that money actually comes from the
organizations that people are trying to take money away from."
Addressing the long-term problems with paying for students' special
fees refunds while still funding student groups, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council passed legislation last week that will
change student refunds from mailed checks to credit on University bills.
The legislation will also require students to fill out a survey when they ask
for refunds so the ASSU can figure out the reason why they are requesting
refunds from certain groups.
In the short-run, the legislation will use the ASSU's buffer fund to cover
special-fees refunds for up to 16 percent of a group's quarterly operating
budget. 7'he legislation is designed to ensure the long-term viability of the
special-fees program.
Reaction to the legislation is mixed. Some organization leaders have
voiced concern over the limits placed on refunding, while others ques
tioned whether the legislation will actually solve the problems with the
special-fees system.
"A lot of the special-fees problems could be solved if students were more
active and discriminating in the special-fee voting process," Laughlin said.
In the long run, an ideal solution to the special fee's dilemma may
be reforming the whole system. One student suggested discriminating
between groups that serve the entire community and those with
smaller niches.
"The system should be restructured to make sure that student groups
who get special fees impact the entire student body," said junior Jenn Coyle,
a member of the Stanford Band. "Other groups with a more narrow focus
should be allowed to apply for funds from a restructured general-fee pool."
However, students have shown support for different elements of the
ASSU legislation. Specifically, the change from mailed checks to credit on
a University bill was generally praised.
"I feel like people just want a little extra pocket change when they ask
for these refunds," said sophomore Leslie Liang.
Sophomore Brian Boggs, a member of the Stanford Solar Car team,
said, "This change makes sure that refunds don't just end up in the pockets
of students."
Despite the changes, most student organizations still expect to apply for
special fees.
Senior Julie Fitzgerald, editor and financial officer for the Stanford
Womenspeak magazine, said, "Womenspeak is still going to apply for spe
cial fees for next year and we count on getting them."
She added, "The biggest change — that groups with higher refund
rates than the amount covered by the refund surcharge will have to cover
part of their costs themselves — is unfortunate but acceptable to us be
cause of the availability of other ways to raise supplementary amounts,
like the Stanford Fund."
In general, students have shown
concern about the distribution of spe
cial fees. Many feel that the some leg
islation is necessary to curb abuses of
the special fee system.
Fitzgerald said, "As far as the high
refund rates go, we feel that students
should consider thinking more as a
community and realize that when they
get refunds, it does impact groups that
are very important to other students
and to making this campus a diverse
and open place."
