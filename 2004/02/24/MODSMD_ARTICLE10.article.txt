# Tech and medicine Meet at clark

There is a new community in town at the intersection of engineer
ing and medicine. Its mission is to generate new ideas and innovations
to change the future. Its name is the James H. Clark Center — known
to most as Clark Center.
Its very architecture is bold. The glass and steel structure — with
its curvilinear body, overhanging walkways and transparent laborato
ries — is unique among campus buildings. Emily Ma, a coterminal stu
dent in mechanical engineering, said she is a big fan of Norman Fos
ter, the architect behind the project. She said Foster's work has made
the Clark Center "unique and special, and there is nothing like it in the
world."
The center is representative of the new work environments being
developed at Stanford. Craig Milroy, an instructor in charge of the
Product Realization Lab, is working to develop a workshop at the cen
ter. This lab will contain the latest prototyping equipment and provide
students with access to a wide variety of materials to build their devices
from.
Professors are excited to mention the fact that equipment and desks
are all built on wheels. They point out that this gives the flexibility to
students and faculty to change their work environments according to
their specific needs. Some professors have noted this is important in
maintaining a dynamic and innovative environment. Ma noted that the
spirit of innovation drives people working inside the center to be inno
vative themselves.
Evan Anderson, a Biodesign fellow, "loves the glass walls on
the outside of the building" because they create a "more open en
vironment for working." Ma agreed and said that it feels like an ac
tive place where "there is a lot going on."
However, the Clark Center is truly unique not only because of its
physical characteristics. Its uniqueness comes especially from its phi
losophy to bring people together. It hopes to unite the faculty through
out the University with the School of Medicine. To the students, the
Clark Center is not only a building — it is a community.
Students note that the center is very diverse. The faculty involved
in the center come from a variety of departments including computer sci
ence, biochemistry, physics and radiology.
Anderson said that he was "amazed by the open mindedness of
the people who have come from different backgrounds." He men
tioned though that the diversity might be hindering people trying to
understand each other. For example, Anderson said he knew little
about the work on molecular imaging that his neighbors are involved
in.
With a little time, however, "the full initiative of the Clark Center
will come into effect," he said. With that goal, Anderson has taken a
larger role by attending the weekly open house events. Despite being
"generally aware of what the different labs are doing," he wanted to
learn more about everyone's work.
Ma said that she was very interested in the cardiovascular bioengi
neering group. "Fluid flow in pipes was not something I really cared
about," Ma said, but she was unable to find a practical venue. Howev
er, when learning about blood flow in vessels, she realized she could
apply fluid dynamics into a real-life application.
Ma also noted that she was interested in using as a "design tool
rather than something to simply fix." She now looks toward biology for
inspiration and wants to use engineering to develop a better understanding
of this field. Despite being an engineer, she has discovered another passion
in human anatomy.
Ma is currently applying to the new bioengineering program. She
said she wants to be a part of something brand new because "it gives
you a chance to shape the initial stages of the program." She advised
that students take advantage of programs in the Clark Center, such as
the new Bio-X program, that gives students a "glimpse of all the differ
ent departments."
Expressing common student sentiment, Anderson believed that
bringing together people from different disciplines will "develop new ways
of thinking to solve difficult problems."
Many believe that the Clark Center is an invaluable resource for
students and faculty alike to become the new pioneers in their field.
"1 just feel lucky to be here," concluded Anderson.
