# Stanford goes large-scale on small-scale technology
## 
### SU FEN LEE 
Although nanotechnology
works at the tiniest molecular
level, it is definitely making its
presence felt across the many de
partments and research centers
on campus.
"There is no internationally
unified definition for nanotech,
but most think that it is coming
from the size of 100 nanometers
and smaller down to the atomic
scale," said Yoshio Nishi, direc
tor of the Stanford Nanofabrica
tion Facility (SNF) and a re
search professor in electrical
engineering.
"The scope of nanotech,
thereby, is to look into the world
of such small geometry from
physics, chemistry, biology and a
variety of engineering aspects,"
he added.
SNF is one of the largest and
most advanced facilities of its kind
in the world. It offers its laborato
ry services to researchers not only
from industry but also from gov
ernment. as well as research orga
nizations.
Even within campus, many
departments are using SNF's fa
cilities. According to Nishi, "most
of the School of Engineering and
a part of the Humanities and Sci

ences are involved in research in
the field of nanotech." This in
cludes the departments of physics,
applied physics, chemistry, biolo
gy, bioengineering, chemical en
gineering, electrical engineering,
materials science and mechanical
engineering.
SNF was one of the five
founding members of the Nation
al Nanotechnology Users Net
work. Stanford was also one of
the 13 universities in the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure
Network. The latter organization
combines the capabilities of its
members' facilities so that stu
dents and researchers can have
open access to all of these re
sources. Nishi believes that SNF
has also benefited from being part
of this network.
"SNF can also leverage on the
facilities at other sites if they are
not available at SNF and vice
versa," he said.
Thus, besides making use of
the on-site facilities, re
searchers can also make use of
its remote capabilities. SNF has
a variety of tools, such as Web
cams and live inspection sys
tems, which allow researchers
located remotely to communi
cate with onsite staff.
Indeed, SNF is more than just

a hands-on laboratory. It also
prides itself as being the "ultimate
'sandbox' for micro- and nano
machining." In addition, it also
seeks to foster an interactive com
munity of researchers by serving
as a forum where "interdisci
plinary science is the rule rather
than the exception." SNF also
hosts several symposia and work
shops each year in topics relating
to micro- and nanofabrication.
Each summer, SNF selects 12 un
dergraduate students to work
with faculty and graduate stu
dents on research projects on all
areas of nanotechnology. At the
end of the program, all the stu
dents working at the different
sites gather to present their re
search results.
With all this hype in nan
otechnology, how is the average
Stanford student benefiting from
so much research in this area?
"To some extent, we are al
ready enjoying the outcome from
nanotechnology, such as electron
ics, which involve microchips and
their übiquitous applications in
communications, computing and
digital consumer products," Nishi
said.
Nishi believes however that
"revolutionary technology" such
as carbon nanotubes, nanowires.

molecular devices, spintronics,
sensors and actuators. bio-MEMS
and even cloths with nanofibers
and so on will still need lots of ef
forts in both scientific research as
well as engineering development
before coming to reality.
"Once becoming successful,
there is no doubt that all such rev
olutionary technology will poten
tially make our lives more conve
nient, healthier and environmen
tally friendly," he said.
Nishi himself leads a research
group on nanoscale devices.
"Silicon nanoelectronics will
serve as the platform for highly
integrated systems with novel de
vices," he said. "The steady
progress of nanotech research will
produce breakthrough ideas that
will enable such systems to func
tion more effectively."
SNF is located in the Paul
Allen Center for Integrated Sys
tems building. The nanoscience
and technology laboratory is
10,500 square feet in area and ex
tends over three floors. It houses
a full range of micro- and nano
fabricational capabilities, ranging
from photolithography and etch
ing to thin-film deposition and
diffusion processing. In addition,
it is also open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

Although nanotechnology
works at the tiniest molecular
level, it is definitely making its
presence felt across the many de
partments and research centers
on campus.
"There is no internationally
unified definition for nanotech,
but most think that it is coming
from the size of 100 nanometers
and smaller down to the atomic
scale," said Yoshio Nishi, direc
tor of the Stanford Nanofabrica
tion Facility (SNF) and a re
search professor in electrical
engineering.
"The scope of nanotech,
thereby, is to look into the world
of such small geometry from
physics, chemistry, biology and a
variety of engineering aspects,"
he added.
SNF is one of the largest and
most advanced facilities of its kind
in the world. It offers its laborato
ry services to researchers not only
from industry but also from gov
ernment. as well as research orga
nizations.
Even within campus, many
departments are using SNF's fa
cilities. According to Nishi, "most
of the School of Engineering and
a part of the Humanities and Sci

ences are involved in research in
the field of nanotech." This in
cludes the departments of physics,
applied physics, chemistry, biolo
gy, bioengineering, chemical en
gineering, electrical engineering,
materials science and mechanical
engineering.
SNF was one of the five
founding members of the Nation
al Nanotechnology Users Net
work. Stanford was also one of
the 13 universities in the National
Nanotechnology Infrastructure
Network. The latter organization
combines the capabilities of its
members' facilities so that stu
dents and researchers can have
open access to all of these re
sources. Nishi believes that SNF
has also benefited from being part
of this network.
"SNF can also leverage on the
facilities at other sites if they are
not available at SNF and vice
versa," he said.
Thus, besides making use of
the on-site facilities, re
searchers can also make use of
its remote capabilities. SNF has
a variety of tools, such as Web
cams and live inspection sys
tems, which allow researchers
located remotely to communi
cate with onsite staff.
Indeed, SNF is more than just

a hands-on laboratory. It also
prides itself as being the "ultimate
'sandbox' for micro- and nano
machining." In addition, it also
seeks to foster an interactive com
munity of researchers by serving
as a forum where "interdisci
plinary science is the rule rather
than the exception." SNF also
hosts several symposia and work
shops each year in topics relating
to micro- and nanofabrication.
Each summer, SNF selects 12 un
dergraduate students to work
with faculty and graduate stu
dents on research projects on all
areas of nanotechnology. At the
end of the program, all the stu
dents working at the different
sites gather to present their re
search results.
With all this hype in nan
otechnology, how is the average
Stanford student benefiting from
so much research in this area?
"To some extent, we are al
ready enjoying the outcome from
nanotechnology, such as electron
ics, which involve microchips and
their übiquitous applications in
communications, computing and
digital consumer products," Nishi
said.
Nishi believes however that
"revolutionary technology" such
as carbon nanotubes, nanowires.

molecular devices, spintronics,
sensors and actuators. bio-MEMS
and even cloths with nanofibers
and so on will still need lots of ef
forts in both scientific research as
well as engineering development
before coming to reality.
"Once becoming successful,
there is no doubt that all such rev
olutionary technology will poten
tially make our lives more conve
nient, healthier and environmen
tally friendly," he said.
Nishi himself leads a research
group on nanoscale devices.
"Silicon nanoelectronics will
serve as the platform for highly
integrated systems with novel de
vices," he said. "The steady
progress of nanotech research will
produce breakthrough ideas that
will enable such systems to func
tion more effectively."
SNF is located in the Paul
Allen Center for Integrated Sys
tems building. The nanoscience
and technology laboratory is
10,500 square feet in area and ex
tends over three floors. It houses
a full range of micro- and nano
fabricational capabilities, ranging
from photolithography and etch
ing to thin-film deposition and
diffusion processing. In addition,
it is also open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.
