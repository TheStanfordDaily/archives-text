# Stop billing us for Internet access

Stanford students are currently charged in
dividually for in-room Internet connec
tions, a system that we find outdated and
not cost-efficient. As more students sign
up for Internet access and as the Web becomes
a more important learning resource, this ar
rangement makes less and less sense. Just as stu
dents who use campus libraries are not individ
ually assessed for the cost of using its books, In
ternet access should be provided to all students
as a part of their costs paid to attend Stanford.
The number of residential computing con
nections — around 11,600 according to the In
formation Technology Systems and Services In
ternet registration database — is already
greater than the number of students living in
dorms — 9,100. Most students have in-room
connections, and dorm computer clusters pro
vide Internet access for those that do not. At
this level of saturation, the efficiency savings of
students not having to register for the service,
the University not paying for the labor and
postage necessary to mail monthly bills and the

cashier not having to collect payments would
likely outweigh the extra costs associated with
providing everyone with individually billed In
ternet access. Under a fee-less system, extra
costs would presumably only arise when the
University had to foot the bill for certain stu
dents that qualified for financial aid. Otherwise,
by including the Internet connection fee in the
tuition costs, the University would still receive
the funds necessary to provide this service from
most students.
In addition to its greater efficiency, this pric
ing plan would be more fair as well. Students
could freely use both their in-room connections
and the computer clusters. Students who prefer
in-room connectivity but cannot afford it would
not be inconvenienced by having to leave their
rooms to use the Internet. As a learning expense
rather than a living cost, Internet would be cov
ered by financial aid. Finally, greater and more
accessible Internet connections would provide a
richer educational environment, just as free stu
dent library access is intended to accomplish.
