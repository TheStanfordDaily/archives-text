Residential Computing (ResComp) is in
many ways the ugly redheaded
stepchild of the Stanford community.
Students complain bitterly about the
high cost of printing (10 cents a page), service
outages and high fees for usage, but we at The

such as keeping the Stanford servers and com
puter networks secure despite constant attacks
from hackers, viruses and people trying to soak
bandwidth — that students rarely hear about or
take time to appreciate.

for residential computer coordinators (RCCs)
were due last Friday, and we would like to en

ResComp is constantly updating its software
and security measures to keep our network safe.
The staff goes to extraordinary lengths to do so,
yet their efforts are only noticed when they fail
to meet students' expectations. We think it is un
fair that ResComp is only noticed when some
thing goes wrong. Therefore we would like to
thank ResComp fora job well-done and express
our best wishes to students selected as next
year's RCCs.
