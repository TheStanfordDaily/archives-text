# GO BIG OR GO HOME
## Mikey imparts pearls of wisdom 
### 
Maybe it's too early to
talk about lessons
I've learned in life.
Half the time 1 have
my friends complaining that they
never see me anymore, my girl
friend saying that I never listen to
anything she says and Roger
Printup reminding me of the
many options 1 have if 1 don't
want to start studying harder.
The days have flown by. too
many nights have been spent
talking to friends instead of
studying and I only see sunrises
right when I'm about to fall
asleep. Those birds outside my
window mock me nightly. Daily.
Whatever.
But I guess I do feel older. My
door is closed more of the time
now so that I can concentrate on
getting some work done. I some
times catch myself eating alone
and reading "The Economist".
Who does that!? Worse yet, 1
party a lot less than I used to.
And while 1 suppose that isn't
saying all that much after last
weekend's escapades, 1 now ac
tually listen to my mom's lec
tures on cirrhosis and my dad's
firm reminder that "partying is
not the answer." I'm skeptical,
but at least I'm listening these
days.
The point, though, is that I feel
older. Whenever I pass by my old
stomping grounds — Lagunita,
Wilbur and yes, Wilbur again,
thank you very much — I shake
my head and smile, remembering
all the fears I had, the things I
thought I knew and the plans for
my life I thought I had set in
stone. And how wrong I was
about it all.
It's not that I now know any
thing about my future, but I'm
just doing what 1 love (unfortu
nately, "what I love" doesn't
seem to have anything to do with
my future, either, dammit). But
when your friends are getting
calls from McKinseyßainGold
manMerrill or being admitted to
YaleHarvardStanford Law and

UCSFUCLAUCSDUCLJX
CRVHWOJRZ Medical School,
it gets pretty distracting. I'm just

hoping Burger
King doesn't
need me to
write a cover
letter.
And for those
of you who are
going to said in
stitutions, don't
take offense to
what I just said.

Needless to say,
you should be proud of your ac
complishments. But if you find
time in a couple of years to invest
the $63.77 in my savings account,
defend me in court or help fix my
ailing health, I'd he eternally grate
ful. I'll probably still be working on
getting my bachelor's then, so my
e-mail (mikeylee@stanford.edu)
will still be the same. Hit me up.
Now for 10 of life's lessons ac
cording to Mikey:
1. Be adaptable.
You'll save yourself a lot of
grief. You'll save the people
around you a lot of grief. If some
thing doesn't go your way. don't
flip out. Adjust, and if you really
feel strongly about an issue, do
something to change it for the fu
ture. In the movie "Entrap
ment." Sean Connery says to
Catherine Zeta-Jones, "There
are alwaysh shurprishesh."
Cheesy line, but it's true. There
are always surprises.
2. Don't always react immedi
ately to something.
Be patient, and every once in a
while, wait something out to see
if you're right that it's wrong.
There are three sides to every
story and the third is not yours.
3. Confrontation is a good way
to solve problems.
Generally — and only if you
approach it in the right way. It also
helps you grow as a person and a
responsible member of society. As
long as you don't let emotions af
fect your judgment too much, you
should work your problems out in

stead of holding grudges or even
being apathetic.
4. Procrastination always
breeds brilliance.
Except that the brilliant ideas
you get when you're procrastinat
ing have nothing to do with the
task you're procrastinating on.
The shower is also a place that
breeds brilliance. If you don't
know what I mean, Stanky, then
go take one.
5. Be spontaneous.
Not all the time, and certainly
don't force yourself, but whenev
er you think you can be, you
should be. It livens things up.
6. Don't do anything you don't
want to do.
Well, that's a general guide
line. 1 don't like doing problem
sets and I sure as hell hate study
ing for finals. But overall, be fair
to people. Maybe the flip side of
Lesson 6 is better: If you do
something, make sure you either
really want to do it or you take on
an attitude that shows that you
do.
7. Sleep.
I don't know for sure since I
never do it, but somehow it just
seems like the right thing to do at
night.
8. Mortality is a good thing.
It's one of the few things that
makes people live.
9. Always plate yourself in the
other person's perspective.
Even if you know you're right.
10. You're not always right.
But don't take my word for it.
I could be wrong.

Mikey Lee is a senior majoring in
communication. He is done
preaching, at least for this week. If
you work for Goldman or Bain or
just want to tell him about lessons
you've learned in life, "hit him
up" at mikeylee@stanford.edu. If
you do song, dance or anything
that expresses culture and want to
perform in (his weekend's huge
Senior Cultural Extravaganza, e
mail him. Or just criticize him for
this shameless plug.
