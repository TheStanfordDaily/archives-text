# AN AVERAGE WHITE BAND
## Courts can define marriage 
### 
President George W. Bush
said last Wednesday that
he is "troubled by activist
judges who are defining
marriage," referring to recent
legal decisions in San Francisco
that have opened the way for
same-sex couples to marry and to
the Massachusetts Supreme Judi
cial Court ruling declaring the
ban on same-sex marriages un
constitutional. "People need to
be involved in this decision,"
Bush continued. "Marriage ought
to be defined by the people, not
by the courts."
Bush paints a picture of a
despotic court system with his
comments, a far cry from the del
icate workings of a revered insti
tution of our democracy kept
carefully in check. Bush did not
protest quite so loudly in Decem
ber 2000. when the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled to halt the Florida re
count, effectively handing Bush
the presidency. Had we listened
to the people then, by way of the
popular vote. Bush wouldn't be
sitting in the Oval Office today.
The ever-eloquent Laura Bush
supported her husband, saying.
"It's an issue that people want to
talk about and not want the Mas
sachusetts Supreme Court or the
mayor of San Francisco to make
their choice for them . . . People
ought to have that opportunity to
debate it, to think about it, to see
what the American people really
want to do about the issue."
Sure, people should have the
opportunity to discuss and debate
an issue. But people alone do not
make legal decisions â€” demo
cratic institutions that represent
them do. San Francisco Mayor
Gavin Newsom and various Mas
sachusetts Supreme Court judges
do not represent the opinions of

just a small minority. Had they
not taken the actions they did.
Bush would have continued to ig
nore the gay agenda and
marginalized the issue of equal
rights for homosexuals. In fact, it
is precisely because of their ac
tions that the issue has been
pushed to the forefront of nation
al debate and has made its way to
the dinner table and the water
cooler. But this nationwide rise in
interest does not seem to hearten
the President.
Bush's handling of the issue,
while intentionally fuzzy, is polit
ically savvy. He has taken a clear
stand against same-sex marriages
without (yet) backing a constitu
tional amendment, although he
nebulously invoked the possibili
ty in his State of the Union ad
dress last month. (Bush said that
if judges "insist on forcing their
arbitrary will upon the people,
the only alternative left to the
people would be the constitution
al process"). Bush is. to quote a
friend, "throwing rhetorical
bones to the right without upset
ting the center," staying astutely
loyal to his supporting factions.
Politics aside, it is incredible
to me that at the dawn of the 21st
century, same-sex marriages are
banned in most states. I cannot
think of a single legitimate rea
son why gay couples should not
be allowed to marry. To disallow
it flagrantly discriminates against
homosexuals. I am sure that in
twenty years we will look back
with shame on our failure to
rapidly provide equal rights for
gays. Only last year did the U.S.
Supreme Court reverse a 1986
ruling rejecting a claim that the
Constitution protected consen
sual gay sex, finally abolishing
state sodomy laws. It is about

time that we nationally legalize
gay marriages.
Those who oppose gay mar
riage protest that legalizing
same-sex marriages would defile
an institution created to protect
the sacred union between a man
and a woman. This objection is
ludicrous. How does the legal
recognition of a two people's love
for each other and desire to be to
gether for life diminish or sully
another couple's same vows?
Other dissenters argue that
marriages should remain hetero
sexual because they are conduits
of procreation. Also absurd.
Does this mean that we should
prevent post-menopausal women
from marrying? Or heterosexual
couples who do not want chil
dren? Should it be illegal to bear
children out of wedlock? A last
ing marriage in today's society is
rare enough as it is, and I certain
ly wouldn't characterize most
marriages as "sacred." The arbi
trary moralizing implicit in the il
legality in most states of same-sex
marriages is ridiculous. 1 wonder
il Bush still subscribes to the anti
quated philosophy that gays can
be "corrected" with proper coun
seling, often religious in nature.
Hmm . . . maybe if they join the
Catholic Church . ..
It is difficult enough to get
amendments approved when
most people support them. If
President Bush goes so far with
his right-wing agenda that he
backs a constitutional amend
ment, it will be a losing battle. As
it should be.
