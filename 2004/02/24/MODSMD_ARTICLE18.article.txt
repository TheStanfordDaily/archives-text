In response to David Horowitz's ad
yesterday ("The Middle East War is not
about a Palestinian state or Palestinian
land"), members of several student groups
want to clear up the distorted facts and
history presented.
Theodor Herzl, considered by many to
be the founder of the modern Zionist
movement, wrote in his diaries about how
to bring about the exodus of the native
Palestinians, which would enable the
Zionists to create a purely Jewish state.
Herzl's June 12, 1895, entry reads, "We
must expropriate gently the private prop
erty on the estates assigned to us. We
should try to spirit the penniless Arab
population across the borders by procur
ing employment for it in the transit coun
tries, while denying it any employment in
our country." Herzl's statement at the
face of it seems to be mild, but the princi
ple of evicting the Palestinian population
in the future Jewish state was already
enunciated.
The process of expropriating the prop
erty of the Palestinians was carried out
during and in the aftermath of the war of
1948, which was accompanied by a large
number of massacres. These massacres
were the main instrument for forcing the
Palestinians to leave and then expropri
ating their properties under the 1950 Ab
sentee Property Law.
The Israeli newspaper Ha'ir published
an article on May 6, 1992, entitled "Mas
sacres of Palestinians in 1947-49: During
the war. many Arabs were massacred by
Jews not only in Deir Yassin." This arti
cle included details of previously unre

ported massacres. In the article, Israeli
history researcher Ariyeh Yitzhaki con
cluded that "at least 20 large massacres of
Arabs took place during the War of Inde
pendence (defined as over 50 murdered
in each massacre) and about 100 small
massacres (defined as of individuals or
small groups). These massacres had a
profound effect on the fleeing of Arabs
from the country."
Yitzhaki points out that "for many Is
raelis it was easy to cling to the safe claim
that Arabs left the country because that
was what their leaders ordered. That is a
total lie. The fundamental cause for the
flight of the Arabs was their fear of Is
raeli violence and that fear had a basis in
reality. From almost every report that ap
pears in the [Israeli] army's archives
about the occupation of Arab villages
from May to July 1948 — the height of
confrontations with the Arab villagers —
there comes the smell of a massacre."
You ask, why massacre the Arabs?
In 1947, when the United Nations
voted to partition Palestine into two
states — one Arab and one Jewish — it
was clear to Zionist Jews that the Jewish
state would have an equal number of
Arabs and Jews. Zionist Jews wanted a
purely Jewish state with a decisive Jew
ish majority. This could be accomplished
through a massive and forceful expul
sion of Palestinians from the Jewish
state. In fact, this expulsion was planned
before the war started, according to Sir
John Bagot Glubb of England. In his
book, "A Soldier With the Arabs,"
Glubb related an encounter between a
British officer and a Zionist officer be
fore the war in December 1947. When

asked about the U.N. partition plan and
the fact that the Jewish state would have
internal problems from a large Arab
population, the Zionist officer reported
ly responded: "That will be fixed. A few
calculated massacres will get rid of
them."
The massacre of Deir Yassin was the
darkest stain on the Jewish record
throughout all the fighting. It was pre
meditated by Zionists to make Palestini
ans leave. Then Zionists justified the
massacre by the outcome. It is historical
ly important because it was to become the
beginning of a second legend with which
the terrorists sought to serve their cause
and justify their deeds. Just as they
claimed credit for the British decision to
leave Palestine as being the result of the
terrorists attacks on British troops, so
later they justified the massacre of Deir
Yassin because it led to the panic flight of
the remaining Arabs in the Jewish State
and lessened the Jewish casualties.
The systematic and deliberate nature
of the Deir Yassin massacre is very im
portant and relevant to our main study.
Crimes against humanity are intentional
acts systematically and deliberately com
mitted by any individual or group against
a civilian population. The intent was to
inflict upon the Arab civilian population
a major blow that would result in a psy
chological edge gained by the Israeli
forces. This psychological weapon, cou
pled with a massive media campaign fo
cused on the civilian population, made
fleeing the only logical option for the
Arabs.
The use of terror on the defenseless
civilian population was neither an isolat-

Ed incident nor a few soldiers acting ille
gally. On the contrary, it was the norm
and the understood mode of operation
employed to achieve the strategic goal of
a state with a Jewish majority. What is
far more remarkable is the ability of the
Israeli state and society to collectively
participate in a successful worldwide
campaign of disinformation and obfus
cation of the facts of the 1948 record of
genocide.
What makes 800,000 civilians flee
their country in a short period of time
without carrying any belongings? The
late William Zukerman, editor of the
Jewish Newsletter, concluded that "the
flight of the Palestine Arabs, which creat
ed the Arab refugee problem, was not a
spontaneous act, nor due entirely to the
propaganda call of the Arab leaders as
the Zionists have claimed all along. It was
a coldly calculated plan executed by the
Irgun [Military-National Organization J
but with the knowledge of the Hagana
(Israeli defense forces] and the Jewish
Agency of the time."
In the aftermath of the 1948 war, the
newly formed Israeli government em
barked on a massive program of confisca
tion of Palestinian properties and lands.
Fully furnished Palestinian houses, large
farms and lands were given to Zionist
Jews to live in and own. To put a stamp of
legitimacy on this thievery, the Israeli
government issued the 1950 Absentee
Property Law which labeled the property
of the Palestinians expelled by force as
absentee property. Moreover, the Israeli
government issued the Land Acquisition
Law of 1953, which transferred the ab
sentees' properties into the hands of the

Jewish National Fund. These laws com
pleted the process of the dispossession of
the Palestinians. This process started
with Palestinians' forced expulsion, con
tinued by the consideration of Palestini
ans as being absent from their property
and ended with the expropriation of their
properties. It was a very clean and civi
lized process of ethnic cleansing and
thievery.
In the most recent memory, one has to
recall Bosnia and the massive campaign
of ethnic cleansing that was directed at
the Bosnian civilian population in order
to comprehend what took place in 1948 in
Palestine. Certainly, Bosnian civilians
did not leave their homes in the thou
sands on their own. Rather, they were
forced out by the Serbs. If one accepts
that this recent mass exodus resulted
from ethnic cleansing, one should be able
to realize that a similar mass exodus oc
curring 55 years ago resulted from similar
circumstances. Our perceptions of what
took place in 1948 are constructed to fit
the accepted worldview that considers
the establishment of the state of Israel as
a positive development. If one admits
that the state was founded on the princi
ple of genocide and ethnic cleansing, then
the need to remedy the injustices be
comes more compelling.
