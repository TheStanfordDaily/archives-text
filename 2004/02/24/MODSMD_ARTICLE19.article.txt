# OP-ED
## Nader's campaign is a good thing for the Democratic Party 
### GALEN PANGER 
Let me say without hesitation that I
am a Democrat. 1 want to lay claim to the
party that started Social Security and
Medicare, got the United States out of
the Great Depression and oversaw the
largest economic expansion in the history
of this country. Of course, there is much
more to say on the issues that cause me to
believe in the Democratic Party, but
that's not quite the focus of this op-ed
piece.
What 1 want to say with this editorial is
this: Ralph Nader is running for presi
dent, and Democrats everywhere should
be rejoicing. The more voices we have in
this campaign, the more ideas and opin
ions that are added to our national de
bate, the better off our democracy is.
That sounds good in principal and it
gets even better in reality. Now we have
had four years of a George W. Bush pres
idency and it has certainly been an inter
esting four years. Four years of decline in
the jobs market, four years of environ
mental neglect, four years of infringe
ment on our civil liberties, four years of
failed foreign policy, four years of un
funded educational mandates and four
years of unparalleled secrecy and manip

ulation.
When the race for the Democratic
Party's presidential nomination began,
many Democrats and media pundits were
horrified to find that not two, not three,
not four, but nine candidates were run
ning. TTo some, the number of candi
dates was a sign that the Democratic
Party was ruptured, that it had lost its
message and that Bush was going to win
in a landslide. But then Howard Dean
came out of nowhere and harnessed the
anger that Democrats felt over their loss
in the 2000 presidential election and the
unilateral war in Iraq. And then John
Kerry came out of nowhere and capital
ized on the Democrats' general feeling
that they need someone who could beat
Bush in November . . . and now John Ed
wards seems to be coming out of nowhere
by building upon Democrats' incredible
optimism and positive outlook for "one
health care system, one educational sys
tem . . . one America" that is not behold
en to special interests. It has been an
amazing race, and it has unified
Democrats around one thing: beating
Bush and putting America back on
course.
Those nine voices criticizing Bush at
every campaign stop was the best thing

that has happened to the Democratic
Party in a long time. They were nine dif
ferent voices, each with a particular take
and a particular willingness to denounce
Bush's record. Nine voices, nine insights
into what makes the Democratic Party
tick, nine people all pulling the Demo
cratic Party in their direction.
Just look at what all this national de
bate has done for Bush's poll numbers: A
Feb. 18 LISA Today / CNN / Gallup num
bers showed both Kerry and Edwards
with double-digit leads over Bush.
I believe that Nader's candidacy will
do the same thing to the Democratic
Party's chances in November that this
strenuous race for the Democratic nomi
nation has done. Nader's blunt criticism
of Bush has already caught the media's
attention: Nader appeared on "Meet the
Press" on Feb. 22 and The New York
Times reports that Nader has promised
Democratic National Committee chair
man Terry McAuliffe that he "would not
criticize the Democratic nominee, but
rather focus on the failings of the Bush
administration."
As if that weren't enough assurance,
Nader's own Web site says,"The
Democrats need to be shown additional
ways — strong, rational, emotive ways to

defeat Bush and the Republicans" —
apart from what their overly cautious
consultants are telling them. These "ad
ditional ways" include calling for Bush's
impeachment, apparently. That will be
fun to watch.
Nader, of course, faces all kinds of
obstacles, the first of which is getting his
name on the ballot of every state. He
also faces the wrath of liberals all over
the country if he contributes in any way
to a Democratic defeat. But 1 think the
possible benefits of his campaign are
much greater than the possible risks.
Nader will be another voice pulling the
United States more to the left, and he
will be another — perhaps more
poignant — voice against Bush's reelec
tion in November. All of which is good
for Democrats.
Let me leave you with a quote from
the transcript of the Feb. 22 episode of
NBC's "Meet the Press." Nader's re
sponse to Russert's question should help
calm even the most fervently dubious.
Russert: If it got down to the final days
of the election and you saw that your
presence on the ballot could swing the
election to George Bush, might you con
sider stepping out and saying, "I endorse
the Democrat"?

Nader: First of all. there are 40 slam
dunk states where either the Republicans
or Democrats are going to win handily;
that's number one. Second, I think
there's a very good chance that President
Bush is going to start declining in the
polls. He's making a lot of mistakes. Peo
ple are beginning to realize that he
doesn't care about the American people,
although he says he does; that as a con
servative president, he's presiding over
and encouraging the shipment of indus
tries and jobs to the despotic Communist
regime in China; that he fabricated the
basis for the war in Iraq, which is now a
quagmire. And if President Bush doesn't
trust the American people with the truth,
why should the American people trust
George W. Bush with the presidency?
Now. you gave me a hypothetical, all
right? . . . When that and if that eventual
ity occurs, in the rare event that it occurs,
you can invite me back on the program,
and I'll give you my answer.
Still think Nader's out to get
Democrats?
