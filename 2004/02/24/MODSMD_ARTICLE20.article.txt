## The 						legend of The Pony lives on at Grinnell 
### 
The lights go out. The fans are nervous in
anticipation. Everyone wonders which
superstar may emerge out of the locker
room.
Cue "Eye of the Tiger."
As the guitar rocks through the opening bars of
the glorious song, a hoy. nay, a man, triumphantly
walks out.
1 lis shoes are ratty, his shorts are hiked up higher
than could possibly be comfortable, his uniform is an
old K-Mart special.
I le was.and forever will be, "The White Pony."
It was the greatest team ever assembled. Formed
during the storied I 999-2000 season, a ragtag squad of
rejects, underachieves and scrappers came together
in what will forever be known as the best high school
basketball team of all time.
Led on by The Pony in spirit and play, the mem
bers of this team redefined what it meant to be a
team player, what it meant to be part of a program,
what it meant to be a man.
In the cold, harsh winter of 2(XX). when my high
school's women's basketball

coach came calling fora practice
squad for his team, five of us —
The Pony. The Cowboy, White
Lightning, The Rock and myself.
The Armenian Barbarian —
laced up our high tops.
That's right, 1 was on the prac
tice squad for the girl's team.
1 was on a team that brutally
dominated its opposition with no
regard for decency.

I was on the Scrubs.
"I'd say we were somewhere between the quality
of the 1996-1997 Bulls and those Celtics teams that
won the NBA championship 10 out of 12 years," said
The Rock. holding down our starting power forward
position at an imposing 5-foot-9.
Our uniforms were "white cotton ribbed under
garments," thanks to high school rules frowning upon
the use of the term "wife-beaters" but we pimped
them out as best we could.
With style that would make Rod "He Hate Me"
Smart proud, our center, Matt Bernstien, rocked a jer
sey that proudly proclaimed, "The White Pony" in
Sharpie, as well as his number, —7?. After most
made baskets, he lived up to his name, riding an imag
inary horse back to halfcourt.
But I would be remiss — that's right, "remiss" —
if I didn't mention our basketball prowess. That's
right, "prowess."
While our shooting percentage hovered at a cool
21 percent or so, our tenacious defense swarmed the
ball and forced more turnovers than I could shake a
stick at — and I can shake a good stick (What the hell
does that even mean?).
Also adding to our dominance was our team phi
losophy of jacking up every open jumper. Thirty-two
footer? Sure! Bank it in off a baseline leaner? It could
happen! Go fora two handed jam? Not in this life
time, but why stop now?
We had no halfcourt offense, just a fastbreaking,
frantic, drive-and-dish philosophy that allowed a lot
of lavups and bombs from way downtown, but not
much in between.
Thankfully, our team was not the last to show this
glorious strategy. At a little school in lowa, the
Scrubs' philosophy lives on in spirit. You better be
lieve that Grinnell College is redefining basketball as
we know it.
Let's just take a look at the stats. In Stanford's sec
ond-highest scoring game (we won't look at the Har
vard nonsense), the Cardinal scored 87 points on 33-
of-68 shooting from the floor. Not bad at all. Grinnell,
however, in its second-highest scoring game, shot 30-
of-84 from the fl(x>r for 152 points.
Oh no, wait. Excuse me. that's 30-of-84 from 3-
point range.
Are you kidding me? They shot S4 three-pointers!
By comparison, Stanford shot a pathetic 13.
Please. Grinnell had three players who individually
had more than 13 3-ball attempts.
This is all thanks to the Scrubs' philosophy. Grin
nell head coach David Arsenault has two main
themes: sh<x>t the ball within 12 seconds and run. Run
on offense, run on defense, run to the bench.
The game must be hell fora play-by-play an
nouncer. Arsenault substitutes all five players like a
hockey team; shifts of players play a few minutes at a
time. Grinnell players take advantage of every open
look they get, passing around the perimeter to find the
open man. And of course, they sh(x>t. All the time.
They have literally rewritten the NCAA record
Ixxiks since adopting the strategy. Of the 37 records
Grinnell holds, Jeff Clement set the mark for individ
ual field goal attempts (68), three-pointers attempted
(52) and made (19) — all in the same game.
Of course, their sh<x)ting percentage is not won
derful, so they press on defense as often as possible to
force turnovers. And if the other team gets past Grin
nell — God bless 'cm — Grinnell will sometimes
allow a free layup just to get the ball back.
So far this season, Grinnell has posted a solid 18-5
record heading into the Midwest Conference Cham
pionships. Perhaps they'll win the Division 111 title: (
perhaps they'll go down in a blaze of glory. I'm just
happy the legacy of the Scrubs team, not to mention
The White Pony, lives on for another day. I'll shake a
stick at that.

Spencer Porter owns several Scrubs individual
records, including most airballs in a game (22) and
technical fouls in a season (35). E-mail The Armenian
Barbarian at porters@stanford.edu and ask him how
the Europeans like his "flair."
