# Men's tennis outlasts rain, Cal
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It took two days and hours of wait
ing through a rain delay, but the Stan
ford men's tennis team finally complet
ed a 5-2 win against rival California on
Sunday.
With ominous clouds hovering
above Taube Tennis Center on Satur
day, match play began with the singles
lineup. Doubles matches are normally
played first but the impending rain
spurred the decision to get singles play
out of the way.
Unfortunately, four of the six
matches were cut short, as players and
coaches armed with squeegees worked
fruitlessly against the rain to dry the
courts.
Stanford took advantage of the two
matches that were completed —
sophomore James Pade and freshman
James Wan collected easy wins for the
Cardinal.
"We needed to get back on the win
ning track after our loss to Rice," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould. "I
thought it was very important to get
some quick wins and both Pade and
Wan provided that for us."
Pade, ranked No. 82 and playing at
the No. 4 spot for Stanford, defeated
Cal's Tyler Browne, 6-1, 6-2. Wan,
competing as the Cardinal's No. 5 play
er, obliterated Patrick Briaud, 6-0, 6-0,
and improved to 8-0 in dual matches —
the best record on the team.
Picking up where the teams left off,
they continued play on Sunday without
any weather interruptions. Playing in
the No. 1 singles spot, Stanford junior
Sam Warburg, ranked No. 71, resumed
his match against Cal's Balazs Veress,

coming from behind in the second set
from 4-5 on Saturday to finish off his
opponent, 6-2, 7-5, on Sunday.
After taking a 7-5, 3-0 lead on Sat
urday, Stanford senior team captain
Carter Morris polished off Cal's Jake
Leivent 7-5, 6-1.
"We had a rain delay and then
Carter Morris was up a set at two
breaks," Gould said. "We were in
pretty good shape in that match. Sam
Warburg had won the first set, if we
could count on winning those two
matches we could win the match. We
went back on the courts and both
players won very quickly."
Stanford sophomore K.C. Corkery
pulled even at 4-4 in the second set on
Saturday but was unable to push the
match into a third set, losing to Wayne
Wong, 6-2, 7-6, when match play re
sumed. Stanford junior Phil Sheng,
playing in the No. 3 spot, put up a fight
in the second set against Daniel
Sebescen after losing the first but was
also unable to pull off a victory.
Sebescen won, 6-0, 7-6.
"Before the rain delay [Sebescen]
was playing really well and I couldn't
figure out a way to beat him." Shen
said. "During the rain delay 1 sat down
with the coaches and came up with
some new things to try. It worked out
really well and I took the second set to
the tiebreak. The score was 4-3 in the
second tiebreaker but I lost my focus
because of a teammate's code viola
tion and ended up losing by one
point."
In doubles, Stanford dominated
Cal. picking up all three wins and the
doubles point. The duo of Corkery

and Warburg handled Briaud
and Veress, 8-4, while Pade and
Wan captured an 8-5 win over
Browne and Sebescen. In the
No. 3 spot. Morris and Sheng
trampled John Pettit and
Wong. 8-1.
"The doubles went awe
some," Sheng said. "I played
with Carter and we played real
ly well, but there's a lot of room
to play even better."
Hoping for better weather
and a continued win streak,
the Cardinal returns to the
courts today against Utah (5-
2) at Taube Tennis Center at
1:30 p.m.
"We don't know much
about Utah but it will keep us
tending to business," Gould
said. "We'll have to hope the
weather will hold. We'll either
play it tomorrow or we won't
play at all."
When the two teams met last
year on the Farm, Stanford de
molished the Utes, 7-0.

No. 3 spot. Morris and Sheng
trampled John Pettit and
Wong. 8-1.
"The doubles went awe
some," Sheng said. "I played
with Carter and we played real
ly well, but there's a lot of room
to play even better."
Hoping for better weather
and a continued win streak,
the Cardinal returns to the
courts today against Utah (5-
2) at Taube Tennis Center at
1:30 p.m.
"We don't know much
about Utah but it will keep us
tending to business," Gould
said. "We'll have to hope the
weather will hold. We'll either
play it tomorrow or we won't
play at all."
When the two teams met last
year on the Farm, Stanford de
molished the Utes, 7-0.
It took two days and hours of wait
ing through a rain delay, but the Stan
ford men's tennis team finally complet
ed a 5-2 win against rival California on
Sunday.
With ominous clouds hovering
above Taube Tennis Center on Satur
day, match play began with the singles
lineup. Doubles matches are normally
played first but the impending rain
spurred the decision to get singles play
out of the way.
Unfortunately, four of the six
matches were cut short, as players and
coaches armed with squeegees worked
fruitlessly against the rain to dry the
courts.
Stanford took advantage of the two
matches that were completed —
sophomore James Pade and freshman
James Wan collected easy wins for the
Cardinal.
"We needed to get back on the win
ning track after our loss to Rice," said
Stanford head coach Dick Gould. "I
thought it was very important to get
some quick wins and both Pade and
Wan provided that for us."
Pade, ranked No. 82 and playing at
the No. 4 spot for Stanford, defeated
Cal's Tyler Browne, 6-1, 6-2. Wan,
competing as the Cardinal's No. 5 play
er, obliterated Patrick Briaud, 6-0, 6-0,
and improved to 8-0 in dual matches —
the best record on the team.
Picking up where the teams left off,
they continued play on Sunday without
any weather interruptions. Playing in
the No. 1 singles spot, Stanford junior
Sam Warburg, ranked No. 71, resumed
his match against Cal's Balazs Veress,

coming from behind in the second set
from 4-5 on Saturday to finish off his
opponent, 6-2, 7-5, on Sunday.
After taking a 7-5, 3-0 lead on Sat
urday, Stanford senior team captain
Carter Morris polished off Cal's Jake
Leivent 7-5, 6-1.
"We had a rain delay and then
Carter Morris was up a set at two
breaks," Gould said. "We were in
pretty good shape in that match. Sam
Warburg had won the first set, if we
could count on winning those two
matches we could win the match. We
went back on the courts and both
players won very quickly."
Stanford sophomore K.C. Corkery
pulled even at 4-4 in the second set on
Saturday but was unable to push the
match into a third set, losing to Wayne
Wong, 6-2, 7-6, when match play re
sumed. Stanford junior Phil Sheng,
playing in the No. 3 spot, put up a fight
in the second set against Daniel
Sebescen after losing the first but was
also unable to pull off a victory.
Sebescen won, 6-0, 7-6.
"Before the rain delay [Sebescen]
was playing really well and I couldn't
figure out a way to beat him." Shen
said. "During the rain delay 1 sat down
with the coaches and came up with
some new things to try. It worked out
really well and I took the second set to
the tiebreak. The score was 4-3 in the
second tiebreaker but I lost my focus
because of a teammate's code viola
tion and ended up losing by one
point."
In doubles, Stanford dominated
Cal. picking up all three wins and the
doubles point. The duo of Corkery
