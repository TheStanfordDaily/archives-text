The stage was set. The swimmers were
ready. The battle lines were drawn.
With tension built sky high, Saturday's
dual meet between the Stanford and Cali
fornia men's swim teams was no ordinary
swimming competition. This meet had ev
erything to make it great: a world-record
holder, national champions from numer
ous countries, NCAA champions and,
most importantly, passion.
With the superstars from each team
out in full force, the meet was, as Stan
ford head coach Skip Kenney put it,
"The fastest dual meet in college swim
ming history."
When the dust settled, Stanford had
won 126-117, but not before six pool
records fell on a day that Stanford
clinched the Pacific-10 Conference title.
Stanford entered the meet with 32 con
secutive dual-meet victories, but Cal's
star-studded lineup was formidable. Cal
was hoping to make this the year of the
Bears after the Cal women upset the Car
dinal women last weekend. No one knew
what the meet would hold, and under
cloudy skies at Avery Aquatics Center,
the battle commenced.
The first event of the meet was the 400-
yard medley relay, an event the Cardinal
usually wins. However, on Saturday, the
Bears struck first, winning the event in

3:09.16. Stanford finished in 3:10.65 and
the two times were the first- and second
fastest in the nation, both under the Avery
Aquatics Center pool record.
With their first victory in hand, the
Bears looked to take the meet by storm,
but Stanford freshman Shaun Phillips and
sophomore Mike McLean had other
ideas. In the first individual event of the
day, the 1000-yard freestyle, Phillips and
McLean placed 1-2 to give the lead right
back to the Cardinal. Stanford would not
trail again.
In the next event, junior Jayme
Cramer, freshman Andy Grant and
sophomore Tobias Oriwol swept the
200-yard freestyle to increase the Cardi
nal's lead.
But even after getting swept, the Bears
refused to fold. In the next event, the 50-
yard freestyle, Cal had its own 1-2 finish.
NCAA champion Duje Draganja and
NCAA finalist Renato Gueraldi finished
ahead of the Cardinal sprinters, and Dra
ganja's 19.42 broke another pool record.
The record was previously co-held by Cal
Olympic gold medalist Anthony Ervin
and Stanford star Randall Bal.
But the Cardinal pushed right back,
with senior Markus Rogan and fresh
man Hongzhe Sun finishing 1-2 in the
200-yard individual medley. Sun passed
two Cal swimmers on his final 50 yards,
