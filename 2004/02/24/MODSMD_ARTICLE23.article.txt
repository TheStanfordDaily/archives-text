# Women look to qualify at Pac-10s
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
While the No. 3 Stanford women's
swimming and diving squads (5-2, 3-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) head in different di
rections this week, members of both teams
have their sights on the same thing: a Pac
-10 Conference crown and, more impor
tantly, one last chance to qualify for the
NCAA Championships next month.
The diving team will look to score the
Cardinal points in Federal Way, Wash.,
while the swim team will compete in Long
Beach, Calif.
To this point, four swimmers have post
ed the NCAA "A" qualifying times neces
sary for an automatic berth to the NCAA
Championships. Junior Lacey Boutwell
had a qualifying finish in the 200 freestyle,
sophomore Kristen Caverly qualified in
the 200-yard individual medley, senior
Tara Kirk qualified for both of her breast
stroke events and sophomore Dana Kirk
made the cut for both butterfly events.
Many others on the squad have posted
"B" qualifying times, which do not guaran
tee a spot at nationals, so those swimmers
are hoping to achieve the"A" standard at
the Pac-10 meet, which will feature some of

the most challenging teams in the nation.
Cardinal head coach Richard Quick
said that defending champion UCLA is fa
vored to repeat its dominance in Long
Beach.
"I think that probably Arizona and Cal
are the next strongest teams and we're kind
of hoping that we can move in with those
teams," Quick said. "We have a chance to
do really well because we have pretty good
balance and we have good diving. I'm opti
mistic that we can put together a good meet
and take a run at the whole thing."
Stanford has dropped only two meets
this year, but both were to conference op
ponents. The Cardinal was blown out by
the Bruins last month, 151-92, and lost by
a mere two-point margin to the Golden
Bears last weekend to end the regular
season.
Stanford will likely collect a large num
ber of points this week from Tara Kirk,
whose collegiate unbeaten streak in the
100 breast stands at 33. She has not been
bested in the 200 breast since her sopho
more year. Kirk's younger sister, Dana, is
also expected to rack up points for the
Cardinal, as she has yet to be defeated in
the 200 fly this season. Caverly and
Boutwell should also contribute greatly in

their specialties.
But Quick emphasized that it will be im
portant for the meet to be a team effort if
the squad hopes to make a run at the Pac
-10 championship, a meet in which the Car

dinal finished second last year.
"There's no doubt about it, we're going
to win some races." Quick said. "But we do

need to have the bottom half of the
team score significant points."
The relay races will become
very important this week, and
though Stanford is not a dominant
team in the freestyle relay, its med
ley — featuring both Kirks — is a
strong point for the squad and
should help the Cardinal's score in
Long Beach.
The distance free races, which
tended to be a weak spot for the
Cardinal last season, have been re
vived this year by the arrival of

freshmen Morgan Hent/.en and
Lauren Costella, as well as by the
improved swimming of junior
Evins Cameron. The team's
progress in the distance free looks
to be another key contributor to
what happens this week.
"We are healthier than we were
during the regular season," Tara
Kirk said. "And, needless to say,
we are going to go down to Long
Beach and swim fast and then just
see how the cards fall."
Competition for the swim team
begins Wednesday night at 6 p.m.
and continues through Saturday
night. The diving team will com
pete all day from Thursday
