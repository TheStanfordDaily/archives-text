# Softball rebounds from opening loss to go 3-1 in Palm Springs
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
Despite a weekend that started out with
two losses and ended with a soggy, sloppy 1 -
0 victory over Penn State, the No. 8 Stan
ford softhall team managed to keep its spir
its up, going 3-1 in official games at the
Palm Springs Invitational to push its record
to 11-2 on the year.
After losing to Northwestern and the
U.S. Olympic team in an exhibition game
on Friday, the Cardinal won its remaining

three games of the weekend, defeating
Notre Dame, Coastal Carolina and the Nit -
tany Lions.
Friday did not begin well for Stanford —
its seven-game winning streak ground to a
halt with a 4-2 loss to Northwestern that af
ternoon before it was no-hit in a 9-0 loss to
the Olympians later that night.
Stanford's senior ace, Dana "Lightning
D" Sorensen, and Northwestern's Eileen
Canney matched up in a classic pitcher's
duel on Friday. With both pitchers firing on
all cylinders, the game was scoreless head
ing into the top of the sixth inning, when the

Cardinal pushed across two runs on a dou
ble by sophomore outfielder Catalina Mor
ris that scored freshman outfielder Jackie
Rinehart and junior outfielder Katherine
Hoffman.
Sorensen was unable to hold this lead in
the bottom of the sixth, however, as the
Wildcat bats came alive to the tune of four
runs off of two two-run homers. A would
be Cardinal rally in the bottom of the sev
enth was thwarted when junior third base
man Liz Bendig, usually known for her

clutch hitting, struck out with Cardinal
runners on second and third to end the
game.
While Friday afternoon's loss was dis
heartening— Stanford senior catcher Jes
sica Allister called it a "game we could have
won" — Stanford head coach John Rittman
was quick to point out the positives his
team exhibited.
"Northwestern is a quality opponent, and
really the game could have gone either way,"
he said. "Even after they took the lead com
ing into the final inning, we put ourselves in
a position to win or at least tie the game, and

we just didn't get the timely hit."
Stanford was no match for the Olympic
squad. Former Cardinal standout and cur
rent Olympic team outfielder Jessica Men
doza scored a run to help propel the victors.
Despite the loss, Rittman was optimistic
about his team's performance.
"This was the Olympians' first game of
their college tour, and they came out real
fired up," Rittman said. "I thought [sopho
more pitcher) Laura Severson pitched a
great game . . . These are the best players in
the world and to hold them to even nine
runs is difficult. Plus, we were facing possi
bly the two best pitchers in the world ... It
was a great learning opportunity for us."
Saturday morning's game marked a re
turn to regular season games for the Cardi
nal. Sorensen put Friday's meltdown be
hind her and pitched a complete game for
her fifth victory of the year. Morris home
red and scored two Stanford runs in the 4-2
Stanford win.
The Cardinal defeated Coastal Carolina,
3-1, Saturday afternoon behind a strong
performance from Severson, who pitched
six innings of four-hit ball to earn her third
win of the year before giving way to the ver
satile Sorensen, who earned her first save
of the season.
The Cardinal offense was keyed by mid
dle of its order. Big bats Lauren Lappin.
Morris and Allister all delivered RBI sin
gles in a three-run sixth inning that secured
the Cardinal victory.
Sunday's game against winless Penn
State was, by all accounts, an ugly affair,
thanks to an ill-timed Southern California
rainstorm that caused an hour-long rain
delay and left the field soggy and wet.
Stanford prevailed, 1-0, in a game that
featured a combined four fielding errors
and only five hits. A bases-loaded walk
drawn by Stanford sophomore third base
man Megan Bordelon plated the decisive
run. Freshman Danika Dukes and
Sorensen combined to throw a two-hit
shutout, and Sorensen was credited with
her sixth win after pitching five innings of
scoreless relief.
The weekend was, in the end, a qualified
success.
"We did a lot of good things this week
end, but we also showed some things we
have to work on," Allister said. "Overall,
this was good preparation for upcoming
tournaments, especially having to over
come the weather on Sunday."
Stanford travels to Tucson to compete in
the Arizona Tournament this weekend.
