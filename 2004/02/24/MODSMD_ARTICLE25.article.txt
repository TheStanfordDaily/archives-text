# Card spiked twice by BYU
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford men's volleyball team (5-11, 3-9 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) fell in three games in back-to-back matchups against No. 4
Brigham Young (9-3,7-1 MPSF) last weekend. The losi.es, however, do not do
justice to just how close the matches were, including a game that ended at 38-36.
That's right, 38-36.
On Saturday night, the Cougars were forced to play eight extra points to win
the first game by two, after a Cardinal hitting error and a kill by Cougars senior
outside hitter Jonathan Alleman. The win gave BYU the clear momentum for
the rest of the match.
"We fought hard," said Stanford head coach Don Shaw of the Cardinal's ef
fort in that game. "We had chances to win the game. We hung in there tough
but we could never get the [serving] advantage."
Stanford hung with the Cougars on Friday night as well, though none of the
games came close to the show on Saturday. After giving up an early 4-1 lead,
Stanford watched the Cougars go on a 3-0 run to take game one, 30-24. It was
a pattern of BYU hot streaks that Shaw said consistently cost Stanford games.
"They seemed to have one stretch in just about each game where they'd
score four or five points," he said.
The Cardinal went on a run of its own to start game two, pulling out to a 5-
I lead after a double block by junior outside hitter Patrick Bomhack and
sophomore middle blocker Chris Ahlfeldt. Stanford enjoyed the steady lead
until a kill and solo block by BYU freshman outside hitter Victor Baptista
evened the score at 19-19. BYU capitalized on the momentum and put togeth
er a 4-0 run to take game two, 30-24.
The Cougars came out swinging in game three, registering an early lead en
route to a 30-25 win and a .520 hitting percentage to take the match.
Shaw pointed to service errors as a key to Friday night's loss.
"We couldn't seem to get any momentum going," he said. "Missed serves
seemed to kill whatever momentum we could generate."
Saturday night opened with the endless back-and-forth thriller, culminating
in a 38-36 Cougar win — a loss from which the Cardinal found it difficult to re
bound. Equally unexpected was the stellar play from Stanford sophomore out
side hitter William Clayton, who came off the bench to lead his team's attack by
recording a season-high 12 kills. The Cardinal even changed its serving approach.
"We used a few more float serves than we normally would and it seemed to
work fairly well," Shaw said. "But still, we just couldn't stop them."
In spite of the Cardinal's 11-9 lead in game two off another Bomhack/
Ahlfeldt block, and a kill by junior setter Kevin Hansen for the 28-27 advan
tage, BYU emerged with another win, 30-28. But it was a struggle that Stanford
junior outside hitter David Vogel, who led the Cardinal the night before with
II kills, appreciated.
"In games one and two, it could have gone either way," he said. "We had a
couple of unlucky plays and those were the deciding factors."
Stanford saw a lead slip away once again when the Cougars squashed an
early 11-7 Cardinal advantage off a kill from Vogel with an 8-0 run. And
though, as usual, the Cardinal came close, this time at 25-23, it was not quite
enough. BYU closed out the weekend with a 30-25 win that Shaw said was
much to their credit.
"They have a very balanced attack, a lot of talent, and a lot of experience,"
he said.
Still, Stanford returned home invigorated from the experience.
"It was an exciting weekend of volleyball, playing in front of huge crowds
and on TV," Vogel said. "That was really fun."
Stanford will take on rival California on Wednesday and LaVerne on Fri
day in Burnham Pavilion.
