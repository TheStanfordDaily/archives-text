# Women's lax holds off Cal 9-6 to extend win streak to three
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 14 Stanford women's lacrosse team re
mained unbeaten this season, defeating rival Cal
ifornia, 9-6, in Berkeley last Thursday.
This weekend, the women will face a stiff test
when they host Ohio State on Friday and Notre
Date on Sunday.
Senior attacker Kim Cahill's hat trick helped
ensure that the Golden Bears' first game of 2004
was not a memorable one. In addition, senior mid
fielder Abbi Hills and sophomore attacker Megan
Burker scored two goals apiece for the Cardinal
(3-0).
Cahill found sophomore attacker Sarah Bach
in the second minute of play for an early Stan
ford lead, but Cal (0-1) came back to tie the
game.
After that, though, it was lights out for the
Bears. Goalkeeper Christina Saikus allowed just
one more first-half score by Cal, while Stanford

scored six more first-half goals fora command
ing 7-2 lead at the break.
Cal fought back in the second half, as two quick
goals pulled them within 6-4 and, following Hills
and Cahill goals, Schuyler Sokolow and Molly
Brady found the back of the net to pull the Bears
to within two, 8-6.
Junior midfielder Kelsey Twist would ice the
win, though, with her goal with 1:30 remaining.
Saikus notched 11 saves while allowing just six
goals in a strong effort for the Cardinal.
Scoring a game-high four times, Brady was the
game's standout, but her individual effort was not
enough to lift the unranked Bears over the West
Coast's only ranked team.
Ohio State will be playing its first match of
the year against Stanford, but the Buckeyes are
favored to win, by virtue of their No. 9 presea
son ranking. Last year, Ohio State went 14-4,
won the American Lacrosse Conference Cham
pionship and advanced to the NCAA quarterfi
nals. Stanford is just one of eight ranked teams

the Buckeyes will face this season.
Notre Dame, meanwhile, was ranked No. 17 in
the preseason coaches' poll. It will open its season
on Friday at Cal (where Ohio State will play Sun
day) before facing Stanford. The Fighting Irish
will face nine ranked teams this season. Although
Notre Dame finished 8-7 last year and missed the
NCAAs, it went out in style — scoring a school
record number of goals in a road game by routing
then-No. 15 Vanderbilt, 22-11, to close out its
2003 schedule.
Stanford will counter both teams with a de
fense anchored by the reliable Saikus, a senior
who has 18 saves against just eight goals allowed
over the past two games — giving her a remark
able .693 save percentage over that stretch.
Leading the Cardinal scoring attack this season
are Burker and Hills with eight goals apiece, Cahill
and Bach with five each and Twist with four.
At Maloney Field, the women face the Buck
eyes at 7 p.m. Friday and the Fighting Irish at
noon Sunday.
