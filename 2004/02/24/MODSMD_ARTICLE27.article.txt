The Rank Prize was recently awarded to Prof. Russell Fer
nald in recognition for his work on compensation for chro
matic defocus in lenses of vertebrates.
The prize was also awarded to three other members of his re
search team. Dr. Ronald Kroger of Sweden. Dr. Melanie Camp
bell of Canada, and Dr. 1 lans-Joachim Wagner of Germany.
Established in 1972 by Lord and Lady Rank, the Rank
prizes are awarded every two years in the fields of opto-elec
tronics and nutrition. This year's awards were presented on
Feb. 9 at the Royal College of Physicians in London.
Fernald said that his research began when he explored the
question of how animal lenses can grow and retain good opti
cal properties. He worked on a fish species in which the lens
growth was rapid and the eyes were spherical, making it hard
er to preserve their optics.
The results showed that usual errors in spherical lenses
called spherical aberration are corrected withui the fish lens
through a gradient of refractive index.
" This means the lens is optically like water on the outside
and like solid protein in the middle. But there is an additional

problem, namely that different colors focus at slightly differ
ent locations," Fernald explained.
He soon teamed up with Kroeger to work on this problem
of chromatic aberration, but soon realized that they needed
someone with mathematical expertise to assist in solving the
optical problems of the spherical lens. At that point, they
began collaborating with Campbell, a member of the Univer
sity of Waterloo's faculty.
Using the African cichlid fish Haplochromis burtoni as a
model system, they discovered that the lens created three
sharp images in monochromatic light. They also discovered
that the images are located at different distances from the
lens, which led them to call such lenses multifocal.
"Well-focused color images are thus created by a single
lens, an accomplishment that had been thought to be impossi
ble because of the laws of physics," Fernald explained. "This
solution appears to offer an explanation of why some noctur
nal animals have slit pupils."
The opto-electronics award has been awarded three times
in the past to Stanford faculty members â€” Prof. Baylor in
1980, Dr. Nathans in 1988, and Prof. Newsome in 1992.
Fernald received 1 (),()()() British pounds for winning the
Rank Prize.
