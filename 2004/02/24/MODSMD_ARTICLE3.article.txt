# Profs named to national academy

### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Engineering Profs. Brian J. Cantwell and
Robert L. Street recently received the profes
sional distinction of being elected to the pres
tigious National Academy of Engineering
(NAE).
Founded in 1964, NAE is a nonprofit orga
nization that works through the National Re
search Council and serves as an advisory re
source for the federal government. Current
NAE members elected Cantwell and Street,
among 74 others, to become a part of the asso
ciation that now has 2,342 active, emeritus and
foreign associates.
Both Cantwell and Street are actively tied
to the Stanford community. Cantwell serves as
the chair of the Department of Astronautics
and Engineering and Street is working with 24
different doctoral and postdoctoral students
and candidates this quarter.
Cantwell said he was looking forward to

being a part of the NAE.
"Probably the most important
role of the NAE is to provide inde
pendent expert advice to both gov
ernment and the private sector on
some of the most complex and vex
ing technical issues of the day —
the environment, hydrogen-based
energy, weapons proliferation, the
nation's infrastructure, the na
tion's space program, etc.,"
Cantwell said.
"It is a great honor to be recog
nized by one's peers and I feel for
tunate to be at Stanford with superb
students and a dynamic intellectual
environment that lends itself to re
search accomplishment," he added.
Street, who has had previous
advisory experience on commit
tees such as the board of trustees
for the University Corporation for
Atmospheric Research, said that
his new association with NAE
would not change his involve
ment in the University.
"Election to NAE should have
no effect on my role at Stanford. I
have had major advisory roles be
fore and one is able to balance
these duties with the Stanford
commitment," he said.

Because the two have not been formally in
ducted into NAE yet, they are unsure about
what their particular responsibilities in the or
ganization will be. However, they both said
they hope to use their extensive research
backgrounds in fluid mechanics to enrich the
NAE's knowledge bank.
In addition to his research in characterizing
the structure of space-time flows, Cantwell
has also worked on developing paraffin-based
fuels for hybrid propulsion and enjoys study
ing symmetry analysis.
"A long time interest of mine, ever since I
was a graduate student, has been the use of syni
metry-based methods for analyzing complex
physical problems," he said. "[Some of] the
methods are not widely known and I would like
to see them brought more into the mainstream
of science and engineering curricula especially
as our research students encounter nonlinear
problems more and more often."
Like Cantwell. Street was also elected to
the NAE for his work in fluid mechanics. But
as a member of the Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering and. by courtesy,
of Mechanical Engineering, Street has fo

cused more particularly on the ecological ap
plications of his work.
"What my students and I do is create and
apply computer programs for fluid mechanics
to simulate the transport of materials in the
ground, in coastal, estuary and / or river wa
ters, and in the air over valleys." he said. "We
use engineering principles, applied mathemat
ics, and computer science tools to predict
where pollution may go and how one might
mitigate a pollutant's impact or remove it."
Although both Cantwell and Street said
that they were honored by their election to the
NAE, neither had ever considered it to be a
particular career objective. Street, who was a
Stanford student before he was a Stanford
professor, said that he followed his profes
sional path by placing his faith in chance.
"Being a believer in serendipity. I never
have had any career goals." he said. "The facts
that I came to and returned to Stanford, got a
Ph.D., became a faculty member and spent 33
of my 42 years at Stanford deeply involved in
department, school and University manage
ment were not things that 1 set out to do; op
portunities happened. 1 am without doubt a

Jim Plummer, dean of
the School of Engineering
and a fellow member of the
N AE, expressed the depart
ment's pleasure in Cantwell
and Street's election to the
NAE. He praised their ser

vices to the department and
University over the course
of their careers.
"The School of Engi
neering is delighted that
Brian and Boh have been
elected to the NAE," he
said. "While their election
is based primarily on the
tremendous contributions
each of them has made to
their technical fields, they
have both also served the

school and the University
in many different ways."
"They are both consum
mate University citizens
— spectacular researchers,
terrific teachers and peo
ple who always step up to
contribute when their de
partments, the school or
the University need them.
All of us are honored to
have them as our col
leagues," Plummer added.
