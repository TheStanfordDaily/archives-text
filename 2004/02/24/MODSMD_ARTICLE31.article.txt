# Research describes genetic code

### SEAN HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Structural Biology Prof. Roger Kornberg and his lab
recently published two papers that reveal progress on
how genetic information is read and how it is expressed.
The Feb. 13 issue of Science magazine featured the arti
cles that focused on how RNA transcribes DN A's genes
into proteins.
Kornberg explained that the lab's major findings in
clude the discovery that RNA polymerase, "the cellular
machinery" for reading genetic information, is divided
into three layers. This finding represented a "milestone"
a couple of years ago when it was first published.
The lab's most current work surrounds the middle
layer and the molecules contained within.
"The reason seeing in the atomic layer is so interest
ing is because it enables us to understand how the in
formation is directed to the front of the genes," Korn
berg said.
Through a process that purifies the RNA proteins,
freezes them into crystals and then analyzes them
under a powerful microscope, the lab members were
able to determine the entire structure of the middle
layer. This process, the researchers say, helped them
understand on a microscopic level how RNA poly
merase initiates transcription.
Among the lab's specific findings was the discovery
of a docking site that could represent where transcrip
tion starts.
Another major finding was a portion of a helper fac
tor protein that "pokes into" the activation site of the en
zyme, which may show how transcription is slowed, a
process that ensures proper separation of DNA and
RNA strands.
David Bushnell, a postdoctoral fellow who was the

first author of one of the papers, thinks that this "protru
sion" of the helper factor protein gives significant insight
into the structure of the protein.
The second paper deals not with protein structure,
but with the process by which a genetic message is made
and separated to initiate transcription.
"These two papers are both quite astonishing in what
they reveal," Kornberg said in a press release. "One be
cause it shows us this protein finger that pokes through
and because we can intuit all the rest of the structure
around the polymerase, and the other paper because it
shows this amazing dynamic mechanism by which the
RNA is separated from DNA."
The lab utilized the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation
Laboratory (SSRL) to observe the structure of the pro
tein layers. The three-dimensional atomic structure can
be determined using the synchrotron, which passes in
tense X-rays through the crystals and creates diffrac
tion patterns.
"We couldn't do this without a facility like the
SSRL," Kornberg said. "SSRL has arguably the best
equipment and men in the world doing this; people trav
el all around the world for machinery like this so we are
lucky to have it right around the corner."
An automatic robotic screening system was used to
isolate good diffracting crystals an automatic robotic
screening system was used. The system stores hundreds
of microscopic frozen crystals on nylon loops at the end
of metal pins and then uses a robotic arm to retrieve each
pin and align the crystal in the path of the X-ray beam.
Lab members explained that using an automatic, re
mote system fora potentially laborious process was
greatly beneficial.
Kornberg articulated the importance of the finding.
"It represents a significant advance and is something
that others regard as unbelievable."
