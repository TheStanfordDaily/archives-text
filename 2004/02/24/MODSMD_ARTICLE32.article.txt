# Alums support coach in misconduct investigation
## 
### MEAGAN BALINK COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. — Five former Uni
versity of Colorado (CU) football players came out to
show support for suspended head football coach Gary
Barnett and all present and past CU athletes, who they
say have been deeply affected by allegations of sexual
misconduct against the football program. Former play
ers Charles S. Johnson, Rashidi Barnes, Scott Nemeth,
James Hill and Leonard Renfro told a swarm of media
on the steps of Dal Ward Athletic Center last Thursday
that their group decided to come together to discuss the
controversy surrounding their alma mater.
Johnson, a CU quarterback on the 1990 national
championship team, said the group was not sanctioned
officially by the CU Athletic Department, but the for
mer players wanted to make sure student-athletes knew
they were there for moral support.
"I think one side of the story has been told," said
Johnson. "The university has hundreds of young ath
letes, not just football players, that are part of the [uni
versity] who come from good homes and have good
values."
Johnson stood by Barnett, saying he coached with in
tegrity. Barnett was put on paid administrative leave
with pay last Wednesday night by CU Chancellor
Richard Byyny for disparaging remarks he made against
former CU kicker and alleged rape victim Katie Hnida.
He will be on leave until the conclusion of CUs in
dependent panel investigation, which has chartered by
the Board of Regents and CU President Elizabeth
Hoffman last week. That investigation is scheduled for
completion April 30. Rashidi Barnes, a free safety for
the Buffs in the late 19905, agreed with Johnson that he
felt the public and media were losing focus on the situa
tion. "We have come out to show support for them," he
said of the student-athletes, noting that they have been
bombarded with media calls and attention, which has
caused some stress and others to be maligned by their
peers. "They are already tabbed as villains and rapists,"
he said'
"A lot of kids were not even here when the allega
tions took place," Barnes said, adding that a victim
should never have to suffer the crime of rape and a per
petrator should be held responsible. "These kids walk
around like they have no support."
Barnes said he wanted to tell CU athletes and
football players, "I know you are not a villain; I

know you are not a rapist; I support you."
Barnes played during the 1999 season with Katie
Hnida, but would not comment on her allegations that
team members sexually harassed her and that one raped
her, which Hnida alleges in an upcoming Sports Illus
trated interview. Barnes said he only witnessed a dra
matic change in player accountability and protocols
when Barnett took over after former head coach Rick
Neuheisel left. Scott Nemeth, inside linebacker for CU
from 1998 to 2001, read from a statement he had pre
pared. He said at team meetings, Barnett would some
times spend hours stressing the importance of moral
and ethical character to the athletes.
"His rules were strictly applied. He suspended play
ers or added additional discipline for being late. Dress
ing out of uniform or displaying any sort of conduct that
did not meet the standards discussed in the player book
were not allowed," he said. "They [coaches] gave us a
wristband with the letters DTRT that stood for do the
right thing."
Nemeth, who played on the team during Hnida's
one-season tenure, also declined to comment on
whether he saw anyone mistreat her.
"1 treated her the same as any other teammate," he
said.
When asked who is to blame for problems in the
football program, Nemeth said perpetrators of crimes
should be held individually responsible for their actions.
"To blame someone else shows a lack of moral in
tegrity," he said. CU Regent Jim Martin was on the
scene, awaiting an interview with a major sports televi
sion network. He agreed that Barnett was not to blame
for CU's problems.
"He should not be the fall guy for the culture," said
Martin. "I'll guarantee you, Gary Barnett is not the
problem with that culture. Gary Barnett is a football
coach. Football is a big entertainment business."
Current CU quarterback Joel Klatt said that the
football team met with Barnett that morning.
"I know he's a good man," said Klatt. "I believe in
the coach."
Klatt said though Barnett's suspension is hard on the
team, Klatt is focusing on preparing for spring practice.
He also said the football team would fully support CU's
independent investigation into allegations of at least
five rapes by football team members.
"We're here to give any information we can to
the investigation," said Klatt. "We're not here to be
criminals."

He also said the football team would fully support CU's
independent investigation into allegations of at least
five rapes by football team members.
"We're here to give any information we can to
the investigation," said Klatt. "We're not here to be
criminals."
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo. — Five former Uni
versity of Colorado (CU) football players came out to
show support for suspended head football coach Gary
Barnett and all present and past CU athletes, who they
say have been deeply affected by allegations of sexual
misconduct against the football program. Former play
ers Charles S. Johnson, Rashidi Barnes, Scott Nemeth,
James Hill and Leonard Renfro told a swarm of media
on the steps of Dal Ward Athletic Center last Thursday
that their group decided to come together to discuss the
controversy surrounding their alma mater.
Johnson, a CU quarterback on the 1990 national
championship team, said the group was not sanctioned
officially by the CU Athletic Department, but the for
mer players wanted to make sure student-athletes knew
they were there for moral support.
"I think one side of the story has been told," said
Johnson. "The university has hundreds of young ath
letes, not just football players, that are part of the [uni
versity] who come from good homes and have good
values."
Johnson stood by Barnett, saying he coached with in
tegrity. Barnett was put on paid administrative leave
with pay last Wednesday night by CU Chancellor
Richard Byyny for disparaging remarks he made against
former CU kicker and alleged rape victim Katie Hnida.
He will be on leave until the conclusion of CUs in
dependent panel investigation, which has chartered by
the Board of Regents and CU President Elizabeth
Hoffman last week. That investigation is scheduled for
completion April 30. Rashidi Barnes, a free safety for
the Buffs in the late 19905, agreed with Johnson that he
felt the public and media were losing focus on the situa
tion. "We have come out to show support for them," he
said of the student-athletes, noting that they have been
bombarded with media calls and attention, which has
caused some stress and others to be maligned by their
peers. "They are already tabbed as villains and rapists,"
he said'
"A lot of kids were not even here when the allega
tions took place," Barnes said, adding that a victim
should never have to suffer the crime of rape and a per
petrator should be held responsible. "These kids walk
around like they have no support."
Barnes said he wanted to tell CU athletes and
football players, "I know you are not a villain; I

know you are not a rapist; I support you."
Barnes played during the 1999 season with Katie
Hnida, but would not comment on her allegations that
team members sexually harassed her and that one raped
her, which Hnida alleges in an upcoming Sports Illus
trated interview. Barnes said he only witnessed a dra
matic change in player accountability and protocols
when Barnett took over after former head coach Rick
Neuheisel left. Scott Nemeth, inside linebacker for CU
from 1998 to 2001, read from a statement he had pre
pared. He said at team meetings, Barnett would some
times spend hours stressing the importance of moral
and ethical character to the athletes.
"His rules were strictly applied. He suspended play
ers or added additional discipline for being late. Dress
ing out of uniform or displaying any sort of conduct that
did not meet the standards discussed in the player book
were not allowed," he said. "They [coaches] gave us a
wristband with the letters DTRT that stood for do the
right thing."
Nemeth, who played on the team during Hnida's
one-season tenure, also declined to comment on
whether he saw anyone mistreat her.
"1 treated her the same as any other teammate," he
said.
When asked who is to blame for problems in the
football program, Nemeth said perpetrators of crimes
should be held individually responsible for their actions.
"To blame someone else shows a lack of moral in
tegrity," he said. CU Regent Jim Martin was on the
scene, awaiting an interview with a major sports televi
sion network. He agreed that Barnett was not to blame
for CU's problems.
"He should not be the fall guy for the culture," said
Martin. "I'll guarantee you, Gary Barnett is not the
problem with that culture. Gary Barnett is a football
coach. Football is a big entertainment business."
Current CU quarterback Joel Klatt said that the
football team met with Barnett that morning.
"I know he's a good man," said Klatt. "I believe in
the coach."
Klatt said though Barnett's suspension is hard on the
team, Klatt is focusing on preparing for spring practice.
He also said the football team would fully support CU's
independent investigation into allegations of at least
five rapes by football team members.
"We're here to give any information we can to
the investigation," said Klatt. "We're not here to be
criminals."
