# MIRROR fights eating disorders
## 
### ANNY LIN 
This year, there is a new program that ad
dresses the issue of eating disorders at Stan
ford. MIRROR, an offshoot of The Bridge,
provides counseling and training for stu
dents who hope to help friends deal with eat
ing disorders.
According to Carole Pertofsky, Director
of Health Promotion Services (HPS) at
Vaden Student Health Center. MIRROR is
a "how to help" resource for students who
are concerned about someone who may have
an eating disorder but are unsure how to ap
proach the issue.
Consultation sessions vary depending on
client needs, according to MIRROR'S Web
site. Counselors are available to discuss top
ics including the best way to approach a
friend with an eating disorder. They are also
available to inform clients who wish to know
more about eating disorders.
At the end of every consultation, coun
selors will suggest a follow-up meeting or

phone call so clients can share their experi
ences and ask follow-up questions.
MIRROR was initiated by Molly Tanen
baum. Class of '03, last spring. Tanenbaum
explained that during her time on staff at the
Bridge and working as a peer health educa
tor (PHE), she saw a need fora program to
address the eating disorders at Stanford.
"I noticed how people at Stanford tended
not to deal with this issue until it became a
big problem," Tanenbaum said.
She and other Bridge staff, along with
staff at HPS, began planning for MIRROR
last spring and over the summer.
"MIRROR is an innovative and impor
tant service," Pertofsky said. "Stanford stu
dents are affected by eating disorders and
concerns about body image. It's always help
ful to have a well trained, knowledgeable
peer to talk to about sensitive health issues."
According to counselor and scheduling
coordinator Laura Hyde, MIRROR is en
tirely student-run. All MIRROR counselors
must go through The Bridge preparation and

receive training on eating disorders.
"We hope MIRROR will help students
talk openly with each other about disordered
eating, an issue that many doggedly avoid
despite its prevalence on campus," Hyde
said. "We are aiming to equip students with
the resources to help one another confront
this issue."
MIRROR will also refer students to
professional resources on campus, such as
nutritionists, Vaden doctors and Resi
dence Deans.
Additionally, the program aims to pro
mote healthy body image and attitudes to
ward eating and exercising on campus
through workshops and literature. Accord
ing to Hyde, MIRROR has scheduled an up
coming workshop at the Women's Commu
nity Center.
Tanenbaum added that in the future,
MIRROR hopes to expand by developing
dorm-outreach programs and becoming
integrated into resident assistant and
PHE training.
