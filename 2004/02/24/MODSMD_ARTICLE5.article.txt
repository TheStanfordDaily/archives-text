# Stanford Dems back Barton and Simitian
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
With the California primary a week away, Democratic candidates
running for state offices vied for endorsements from the Stanford De
mocrats at the organization's meeting last night.
Former assemblyman Ted Lempert and current assemblyman Joe
Simitian are in a neck-to-neck race for the State Senate Democratic
nomination. Fighting for the California 21st Assembly District seat
Simitian is abandoning are John Barton, a member of the Palo Alto
School District, and John Carcione, a board member of the West Bay
Sanitary District.
After hearing the candidates' platforms — all but one were present at
the meeting — and answers to students' questions, the Stanford De
mocrats voted by majority to endorse Barton for the State Assembly po
sition and Simitian for the State Senate position.
Because the Stanford Democrats had already heard Simitian's plat
form in a meeting last week, most of the meeting time was spent listen
ing to Lempert share his views.
Lempert, who noted that he graduated from Stanford Law School in

1986 and had been involved in Stanford Democrats, highlighted the
three key issues that he was concerned about — environment, education
and campaign-finance reform.
Campaign finance reform is an issue that differentiates the two State
Senate candidates; Lempert supports and Simitian opposes spending
limits.
In response to a question about how a Democratic candidate with
spending limits could compete against a Republican candidate backed
by soft money. Lempert said. "We should do everything we can to con
trol money. You can get outspent and still win."
Simitian. on the other hand, purported the belief that spending limits
would limit citizens' voices in the government.
"We want people to participate, so why take the cap?" he asked.
Lempert voiced his strong opposition to school vouchers, citing local
public and private school districts as examples of their impracticality.
"Vouchers take money away from public schools and give it to private
schools," Lempert said. "On the philosophical level, I'm against them.
On a practical level, I don't see how they would work."
Simitian and Lempert were amicable
toward each other except when Lem
pert criticized Simitian's lack of person
al connection with voters.
"Be careful, Ted," Simitian inter
rupted from the side.
Freshman Russell Husen said that
health care, education and experience

were the major factors that affected his
vote to endorse Barton and Simitian. Se
nior Nick Geballe noted that the candi
dates endorsed by the Stanford Democ
rats were the ones who had interacted with
and showed more support for the group.
"I liked Barton because he seemed
much more honest," Geballe said. I
liked his answers and he didn't duck the
questions. Also. Barton actually came
|to last night's meeting], whereas Car
cione just sent a representative."

Junior Dylan Mefford, president of
the Stanford Democrats, said that he was
pleased that the candidates could come
out to speak directly to the students.
"There were strong candidates in
each race and we will fully support
whomever wins on March for both elec
tions," Mefford said. "It is a testament to
the Stanford Democratic' involvement
in local and state politics that so many
candidates would come to the meetings
and ask for our support."
