## Vaccine trades needle FOR NASAL SPRAY 
### GEOFF KOCH STAFF WRITER 
Forget rolling up your sleeve for
your annual flu shot. The performance
of the new vaccine Flu Mist during its
first flu season suggests that a quick and
painless nasal spray could eventually
replace the needle.
"There are limitations to the cur
rent influenza vaccine," said Harry B.
Greenberg, a professor of medicine and
associate dean of research at Stanford
University Medical Center. "A live flu
vaccine meets a major public health
need."
After years of research and devel
opment, Flu Mist was released last year
by Maryland-based Medlmmune, Inc.
It appeared on the market with big
hopes and a concomitant marketing
budget, thanks to a partnership with
Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.
In the 2003-2004 flu season, though,
sales were initially sluggish and many of
the 4 million doses of Flu Mist that had
been manufactured went unsold. Some

doctors expressed concern that
those inoculated with the weak
ened but very much live version of
the virus in the vaccine might infect
others. And Flu Mist was expensive
- $50 or more per dose compared
to $10 to 15 fora walk-in flu shot.
Then came reports that the
season's flu was nastier than ex
pected. The deaths of several chil
dren were attributed to the virus,
and parents flocked to doctors for
flu shots. The United States quick
ly ran out of standard flu vaccine.
The shortage emphasized the im
portance of new vaccines, like Flu-
Mist, in the market.

A case study in drug
development
Greenberg took a leave of absence
from his Stanford duties to help devel
op the vaccine at the Mountain View,
Calif.-based company, Aviron. The
company was acquired by Medlmmune
in December 2001. He spoke about the
experience on Feb. 13 at a symposium
called "Viruses in the 21 st Century" at
the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science in Seattle, Wash.
Greenberg was motivated to work
on the drug, in part, by the millions of
people in the United States who go
without vaccinations each year. During
the 2002-2003 nearly 150 million
healthy people who might have benefit
ed from a flu shot did not receive one.
This figure includes more than 70 per
cent of high risk children who might
most benefit from receiving the vac

cine, he said. The result was more than
70 million lost work days, 38 million
missed school days and as many as 50
million influenza infections.
Flu Mist may have several advan
tages over these standard vaccines,
which are based on inactivated, that is
dead, viruses. As a live-virus vaccine,
Flu Mist not only elicits antibodies to a
targeted strain of virus present in the
vaccine, but also may be able to elicit
antibodies to antigenically drifted, that
is slightly different, strains. So if a virus
in the community undergoes small
changes, a relatively common occur
rence, the patient may still have a mea
sure of protection.
Also, the means of delivering the
vaccine — a quick squirt up the nose —
is more palatable to many children and
adults than a needle injection.
Last fall, several physicians ex
pressed concern about inoculating
themselves with Flu Mist because it is a
live-virus vaccine. They were worried
about subsequently infecting their pa-

tients, a result that could be especially
devastating if the patient has a weak
ened immune system. Such patients,
such as those who have HIV or cancer,
are not uncommon in a hospital, the
physicians said.
Greenberg said that studies con
ducted by Aviron and Wyeth should
clarify the extent of possible transmis
sion. He pointed to an unpublished
Wyeth study about transmission in a
Finnish day care center, the kind of en
vironment ripe for spread of a virus in
very young children, another vulnera
ble population.
Nearly 200 children from eight to
36 months of age were studied. The
children came to the day-care center
three days per week, four hours each
day. The result of the randomized, dou
ble-blind and placebo-controlled study
was a transmission rate of less than one
percent, Greenberg said.

The single case of transmission was
not associated with ill effects or with
any changes in the virus used in the vac
cine, he added. Some had expressed
concern that the virus used in Flu Mist
might itself drift to become other trou
bling strains, but the weakened virus in
the drug appears to be very stable.
At present, the drug is approved for
healthy people from 5 to 49 years of
age. Greenberg, though, expects this
range to be expanded as additional
studies are carried out to ensure that
the vaccine is safe and effective in
younger children and older adults.
Fragile economics,
19505-era technology
With health costs everywhere on
the rise, doctors, patients and insurance
companies initially balked at Flu Mist's
price. But Greenberg pointed out that
development costs associated with Flu-
Mist from 1996 to 2002 exceeded $500
million, all of which came from private
investors.

Many companies have stopped
making the low-profit flu vaccines
in favor of blockbuster drugs, such
as those treating acid reflux and
erectile dysfunction. At present,
just two drug companies in the
world, Aventis Pasteur and Chi
ron, manufacture standard inacti
vated flu vaccines.
Flu Mist is an innovative prod
uct, but it has not solved what some
see as the biggest risk to the world
wide system of vaccine production:
It takes time to produce.
Flu Mist is manufactured much
the same way as standard inacti
vated flu vaccines are. The active

component of the vaccine is grown
in chick embryos, a technique that has
not changed much since the 1950s and is
not conducive to manufacturing large
quantities of vaccine in a short period
of time.
Also, there is concern that if an es
pecially virulent virus jumped from
birds to humans — a scenario that has
health officials on edge as the monitor
the avian flu outbreak in Asia — then
the technology might fail outright. Such
a virus may kill the chick embryos used
to replicate it, effectively shutting down
worldwide flu vaccine production.
If and when the next pandemic hits,
the world will need lots of vaccine in
very short order. Yet Greenberg's ex
perience with Flu Mist suggests that
there is little that happens quickly when
it comes to vaccines.
"The road from invention to licen
sure is long and unpredictable, as is
the road to acceptance," Greenberg
said.

Intranasal vaccines may be more palatable to
children and adults who dread the needle.
