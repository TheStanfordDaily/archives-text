# Panel speaks on med student life
## 
### JACK LOVERIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After five years of balancing his
work as a student at the Stanford
School of Medicine and compiling
the stories of his colleagues, Nick
Rubashkin is finally seeing his work
on the published page.
Last night, Rubashkin and two
contributors to the book of essays
"What I Learned In Medical
School" discussed their varying edu
cational experiences and challenged
common perceptions about their
profession. The panel discussion,
hosted by the Stanford Bookstore,
was followed up by a question-and
answer session and a book signing.
After gathering 80 submissions
from medical school students from
across the country, Rubashkin and
his fellow editors, K.M. Takakuwa
and Karen Herzig, narrowed their
collection down to 22 essays. The
stories address the grueling medical
school experience from perspec
tives that stray from what is "tradi
tional" for future doctors. In the
book, Rubashkin relates his deliber
ation whether or not to reveal his
homosexuality when applying to
medical schools.
"What I Learned In Medical
School" also contains essays from a
teenage mother, a Mexican immi
grant and a recovering alcoholic all
trying to come to terms with the ob
stacles in their efforts to become
doctors.-
"It was a two-year process of
finding our contacts and getting out
requests for entries," Rubashkin
said. "We had no idea of what we
were going to get in response in
terms of number and content. In the
end, one third of the essays we in
cluded were written by medical stu
dents at Stanford."
Simone Eastman-IJwan, who is
currently finishing her residency in

family medicine at San Jose Medical
Center, related her story of making
her way through medical school with
the debilitating symptoms of sickle
cell anemia. As she described in her
essay "Daring To Be A Doctor,"
being forced to balance her workload
and nights on call with the pains of the
disease often discouraged her, but
she said overcoming her fears of fail
ure increased her determination.
"You need to really have a pas
sion for the field to get through med
ical school," Eastman-Uwan said. "If
you're not passionate about it, it be
comes an embittering experience
with all of the setbacks and complica
tions. The fear of rejection is always
prominent in medical school experi
ences. I also feared encountering
people who believed that individuals
with disabilities should not be doc
tors, but I just had to get over it."
In his essay featured in the book,
Akilesh Palanisamy, also currently
at San Jose Medical Center, de
scribed the challenges he faced at
LJC-San Francisco School of Medi
cine while trying to incorporate ele
ments of Ayurveda — a traditional
system of Indian medicine — into
more prominent western practices.
Palanisamy addressed the intimida
tion that he felt in introducing an un
orthodox idea into the medical
school environment.
"I was hesitant to share the full
degree of my medical views since I
feared my ideas would be rejected
by my colleagues as unconvention
al," Palanisamy said. "I've been very
surprised by the openness I've en
countered in response to my story
and my ideas. The experience of
having my story published quelled
many of my fears and apprehen
sions. I've actually been pleasantly
surprised to find a lot of curiosity re
garding allopathic medicine."
