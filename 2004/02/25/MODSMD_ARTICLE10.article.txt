# Letters from Stanford guys (and other random people)

(Editor's note: Following are letters received in re
sponse to the Feb. 23 column, titled, "A letter to the
Stanford boys," by Shirin Sharif.)
Casual dating was normal back in the da/
I scavenged a copy of The Daily at Taco Bell,
not being a regular reader. Nor am I the typical
male who might respond to a column (I am 71).
But, I thought I would comment about the way
times have changed.
When I was in college in the early 19505, casual
dating was the norm. It was an enjoyable and prac
tical custom in those days. It suited the financial
means of most men, who were supposed to initiate
the date and pick up the tab.
The modern Stanford male is from such a di
verse background, with such a high achievement
orientation, he is probably too embarrassed to
admit that he doesn't know how to "casual date" or
how to act when with a casual date. So the liberat
ed female student writes a gentle column and tells
him how to go about it. I hope the writer gets a
good response and start a "new" trend.

I got a kick out of Shirin Sharif's sound advice to
the "boys." What she is suggesting is exactly how I
operated when 1 was a student, and nobody had
any complaints.

Girls should ask guys out, too
First, I definitely agree with Shirin Sharif that
casual dating is a practice that should occur much
more frequently on this campus. However, I dis
agree with her letter because it is aimed solely at
the guys. She states that "Stanford girls aren't
mean! We try to encourage proactive behavior."
Couldn't Stanford girls actually engage in proac
tive behavior? Instead of promoting the stereotype
that girls must wait for guys to ask them out, could we
ask for guys' numbers and ask them out on dates? If
girls began doing this, I think guys would follow suit;
the problem seems to be that no one on this campus
takes action. I think Sharif's letter to Stanford guys
could easily be addressed to all members of this cam
pus and be much more effective.
Additionally, the letter disregards the possibility
of a Stanford guy not being interested in a girl but
being interested in a boy. I hope in the future, Sharif
will consider non-traditional ways of solving relation
ship / dating issues rather than relying on stereotypi
cal gender roles and assumptions of heterosexuality.

I can't help but wonder what motivates some
one to write a column lamenting the absence of a
Stanford dating scene in the form of a letter to male
students. Surely our wonderful Stanford women
are not so bound to old-fashioned, patriarchal gen
der norms that they are unable to initiate romances
themselves.
Why only ask why guys aren't asking anyone
out? Why aren't Stanford women asking for guys'
phone numbers? By deciding to simply blame the
problem on other students, the writer passes over
the opportunity to examine why dating actually is
so rare on the Farm. Are our notoriously over
achieving students incapable of casual relation
ships? Are we all too terrified of the prospect of
failure? Does nobody have the time fora quiet
evening with a date?
Are Stanford students simply not worth asking
out? I appreciate that it's easier and more gratify
ing to simply demand that other people change

their behavior, but addressing these questions in
stead would have made fora much better column.

Stanford girls aren't interested
I'm a male senior at Stanford and have pretty
much only had casual relationships here. I'm not
sure what the problem is, but it's definitely not be
cause of a lack of effort on my part. I get the phone
numbers of girls I'm attracted to, and I ask them
over to dinner and coffee with a fair amount of fre
quency as well.
However, the last time I did (over the phone),
the response I got was"I have something to occu
py my time for every hour of every day for the next
week." This was a pretty extreme reply, but a com
mon variant of the ones I often get.
I'm pretty sure Stanford girls are just more con
cerned about finishing their problem sets than giv
ing us guys a fighting chance.

Why would a young man like me spend the "prime
years of [his] youth" without some form of dating?
Surely there must be some form of motive. This mo
tive exists because of the utter falsehood Shirin Sharif
uttered: "Stanford girls aren't mean! We try to en
courage proactive behavior." A more hilariously,
stupidly untrue statement may never have been ut
tered in the hallowed pages of The Stanford Daily.
One guy I know once tried casual dating at Stan
ford. He mentioned to the person he was casually
dating that they'd almost been casually dating for
quite some time and his head was bitten off. It was
denied that "casual dating" had occurred.
Another friend of mine asked a girl out to dinner.
They went to dinner, and he offered to pay. The next
day he got a lengthy nasty e-mail telling him what a
worthless chauvinist he was for offering to buy her din
ner. Another friend of mine asked a girl to a dance.
She tactfully replied, "No. Get away from me!"
My point is that girls here are generally psy
chotic and delusional. Indeed, rejection is not the
only possibility when a guys asks a girl out. Other
possibilities include public humiliation, being
chewed out in written form and being treated as a
threatening figure without any provocation what
soever. Worse still, one might end up with a "life
long commitment" to one of these psychos.
In evaluating whether or not I wish to remain in
my room and avoid social occasions at all cost (a lit
tle different from "sitting in your room and pretend
ing to be content with [my] love life, or lack there
of'), my choice is clear. I do not wish to be subject
ed to extreme social and mental pain with only the
possibility of reward in the form of fool's gold.
Stanford men, I advise you to continue that ad
mirable practice of cave dwelling. Indeed it is a dan
gerous world out there — one that is to be avoided at
all cost. The lack of casual dating at Stanford cannot
be pinned on man alone. It is a two-way street, and
one from which I am running as fast as I possibly can.

tered in the hallowed pages of The Stanford Daily.
One guy I know once tried casual dating at Stan
ford. He mentioned to the person he was casually
dating that they'd almost been casually dating for
quite some time and his head was bitten off. It was
denied that "casual dating" had occurred.
Another friend of mine asked a girl out to dinner.
They went to dinner, and he offered to pay. The next
day he got a lengthy nasty e-mail telling him what a
worthless chauvinist he was for offering to buy her din
ner. Another friend of mine asked a girl to a dance.
She tactfully replied, "No. Get away from me!"
My point is that girls here are generally psy
chotic and delusional. Indeed, rejection is not the
only possibility when a guys asks a girl out. Other
possibilities include public humiliation, being
chewed out in written form and being treated as a
threatening figure without any provocation what
soever. Worse still, one might end up with a "life
long commitment" to one of these psychos.
In evaluating whether or not I wish to remain in
my room and avoid social occasions at all cost (a lit
tle different from "sitting in your room and pretend
ing to be content with [my] love life, or lack there
of'), my choice is clear. I do not wish to be subject
ed to extreme social and mental pain with only the
possibility of reward in the form of fool's gold.
Stanford men, I advise you to continue that ad
mirable practice of cave dwelling. Indeed it is a dan
gerous world out there — one that is to be avoided at
all cost. The lack of casual dating at Stanford cannot
be pinned on man alone. It is a two-way street, and
one from which I am running as fast as I possibly can.

We need more girls who are into dating
I have to agree with Shirin Sharif completely. I just
wish more girls at Stanford felt the same way as she does.

Response from Shirin Sharif: I admit to being tra
ditional in terms of gender roles. While I'm not op
posed to girls asking guys out, 1 think guys should
he more assertive and just ask girls out!
(Editor's note: Following are letters received in re
sponse to the Feb. 23 column, titled, "A letter to the
Stanford boys," by Shirin Sharif.)
Casual dating was normal back in the da/
I scavenged a copy of The Daily at Taco Bell,
not being a regular reader. Nor am I the typical
male who might respond to a column (I am 71).
But, I thought I would comment about the way
times have changed.
When I was in college in the early 19505, casual
dating was the norm. It was an enjoyable and prac
tical custom in those days. It suited the financial
means of most men, who were supposed to initiate
the date and pick up the tab.
The modern Stanford male is from such a di
verse background, with such a high achievement
orientation, he is probably too embarrassed to
admit that he doesn't know how to "casual date" or
how to act when with a casual date. So the liberat
ed female student writes a gentle column and tells
him how to go about it. I hope the writer gets a
good response and start a "new" trend.

I got a kick out of Shirin Sharif's sound advice to
the "boys." What she is suggesting is exactly how I
operated when 1 was a student, and nobody had
any complaints.

Girls should ask guys out, too
First, I definitely agree with Shirin Sharif that
casual dating is a practice that should occur much
more frequently on this campus. However, I dis
agree with her letter because it is aimed solely at
the guys. She states that "Stanford girls aren't
mean! We try to encourage proactive behavior."
Couldn't Stanford girls actually engage in proac
tive behavior? Instead of promoting the stereotype
that girls must wait for guys to ask them out, could we
ask for guys' numbers and ask them out on dates? If
girls began doing this, I think guys would follow suit;
the problem seems to be that no one on this campus
takes action. I think Sharif's letter to Stanford guys
could easily be addressed to all members of this cam
pus and be much more effective.
Additionally, the letter disregards the possibility
of a Stanford guy not being interested in a girl but
being interested in a boy. I hope in the future, Sharif
will consider non-traditional ways of solving relation
ship / dating issues rather than relying on stereotypi
cal gender roles and assumptions of heterosexuality.

I can't help but wonder what motivates some
one to write a column lamenting the absence of a
Stanford dating scene in the form of a letter to male
students. Surely our wonderful Stanford women
are not so bound to old-fashioned, patriarchal gen
der norms that they are unable to initiate romances
themselves.
Why only ask why guys aren't asking anyone
out? Why aren't Stanford women asking for guys'
phone numbers? By deciding to simply blame the
problem on other students, the writer passes over
the opportunity to examine why dating actually is
so rare on the Farm. Are our notoriously over
achieving students incapable of casual relation
ships? Are we all too terrified of the prospect of
failure? Does nobody have the time fora quiet
evening with a date?
Are Stanford students simply not worth asking
out? I appreciate that it's easier and more gratify
ing to simply demand that other people change

their behavior, but addressing these questions in
stead would have made fora much better column.

Stanford girls aren't interested
I'm a male senior at Stanford and have pretty
much only had casual relationships here. I'm not
sure what the problem is, but it's definitely not be
cause of a lack of effort on my part. I get the phone
numbers of girls I'm attracted to, and I ask them
over to dinner and coffee with a fair amount of fre
quency as well.
However, the last time I did (over the phone),
the response I got was"I have something to occu
py my time for every hour of every day for the next
week." This was a pretty extreme reply, but a com
mon variant of the ones I often get.
I'm pretty sure Stanford girls are just more con
cerned about finishing their problem sets than giv
ing us guys a fighting chance.

Why would a young man like me spend the "prime
years of [his] youth" without some form of dating?
Surely there must be some form of motive. This mo

uttered: "Stanford girls aren't mean! We try to en
courage proactive behavior." A more hilariously,
