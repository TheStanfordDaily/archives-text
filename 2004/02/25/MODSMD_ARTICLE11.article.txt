# Eat, Drink and be Merry
## A 						Los Angeles girl in Palo Alto, part deux

(Writer's note: This is a continuation of last week's col
umn. If you feel so inclined to refresh your memory of my

oh-so-insightful comments, hunt out
last Wednesday's edition somewhere in
your dining hall or foyer of your place
of residence. You know where that
Daily graveyard is; you've probably
contributed to it yourself. Also, plot
lines from the final episode of "Sex and
the City" will be revealed in this col
umn. Please read at your own risk if
you are still waiting to watch.)
_ ajor props to the astute read-

Mer out there who might have noticed that I
tried to parallel the ending of "Sex and the
City" with this two-part column. Just as Carrie
left you in the air over her beau-of-choice, I know I have
mimicked this anticipation with my last article's equally
thrilling cliffhanger ... "where to go for dinner."
Now 1 know this may sound quite banal to the busy
college student with a computer science program due on
Friday, or to the birthday girl who is celebrating her 22nd
with a party theme inspired by her mullet-checkered past
(oh yes, the boozer in the dirty South).
But think about it — if you look back over the famous
cliffhangers appearing in your life, which are the ones
that will stay with you forever?
If I came up to you on the street one day and said,
"Hey man, I know who shot J.R.," I'm sure it wouldn't

have had the same importance as if I said "Hey man, I fi
nally found a GREAT place to go for dinner tonight."
Tonight's dinner probably evokes a much more eager
concern (at least 1 should hope it would) than some tele
vision show's dramatic ending. Dinner will always be
there. "Dallas," "Friends," "Seinfeld" and "Sex and the
City" (sadly to admit) will not — unless, of course, you
own the DVDs.
So just as Carrie finally satisfied herself by leaving
Paris to live in New York with Mr. Big (whose name is
John? Random ...), you too will be able to satisfy your
self without ever having to whip out your frequent flyer
card or passport (I hate that picture too, so don't worry).
And for all of us who get a little teary-eyed at the
thought of a new era of Sunday nights without our 9 p.m.
TV ritual, try to recreate a dazzling night-on-the-town,
reminiscent of the girls' trip to Sushi Samba. Bed and
other glamorous destinations. It will be like your homage
to their stylishness.
But you may be thinking, "Um, Jennie, they were in
New York, where there is always a club opening or a
restaurant switching owners. We can't live like that here
at Stanford, where style is redefined as changing out of
our pajamas into actual clothes."
I would love to say you are absolutely wrong. I really
would, but in good conscience I can't deny the obvious. I
have to be honest and admit that a severe lack of trendi
ness exists in Palo Alto (hmm, it isn't a college town, it
isn't a trendy town, we're not left with many options,
folks).

But don't give up all hope, because there are a few
sparkling options that stand out among the dull vista.
One of my absolute favorites is a contemporary Viet
namese restaurant. Three Seasons.
Situated behind the immediate street-side. Three Sea
sons is nestled inside a quaint courtyard. It doesn't take
long to realize you've hit culinary gold. You immediate
ly feel like you've stepped into a "hot spot'' when you
walk through the door — the orchid arrangements draw
your attention to a glittering bar, bordered along the wall
by a succession of decorative buddhas. Seated in chairs
made out of woven wood at a variety of different table
heights, you are served drinks (even sodas) out of bam
boo-shaped glasses.
If any atmosphere could trendify someone, this would
work wonders on even the Steve Urkel among us (oh
yeah, we all loved "Family Matters" — even before he
became Stephan Urkelle after that weird stylifier ma
chine). But if the scene reels you in, it's the food that
keeps you coming back.
The delicate, clean lines of their freshly-wrapped
spring rolls (filled with a variety of ingredients like
mango, ahi tuna, avocado, soft-shell crab, mint and let
tuce) provide the perfect appetizer to an amazing menu
of mouth-watering options. The potstickers, although
sometimes heavy on the black pepper, gently hold the
light, individually defined shrimp filling.
The pad thai arrives at your plate as thin noodles
topped with a variety of crispy vegetables; the yellow
curry chicken sits in a bath of a creamy, yet mildly sea

soned, sauce. The prawns and pineapple tastes sweet yet
crispy, thinly veiled with a "walnut and exotic passion
fruit sauce" and the velvety Japanese eggplant slides
down your throat with delicious ease.
As you can probably see, I can't say enough about this
restaurant. The scene, the food, the people, the decor —
it all adds up to a fabulous dining experience, whether
that be a first date, a thirtieth date, a celebrate-with-the
girls night, or even a 1-bought-new-shoes-and-need-to
justify-their-purchase night.
As Carrie ended her final epilogue, she discussed her
final thoughts on relationships in this world. Some bring you
to the exotic, some bring you back home, some bring you
something you once had but then lost. The most important
relationship, however, is the one you have with yourself.
So decide what you need to find — the exotic or the
familiar — and hopefully Three Seasons can help make
the search a little bit easier.
Three Seasons is located at 518 Bryant Street, off of
University Ave. in Palo Alto.

If you know anyone who somehow has a connection to
the sixth season DVD of "Sex and the City," please let
Jennie know at jbroder@stanford.edu. Also, if you or
dered one of those new mini iPods hut decided that you
no longer want it, Jennie will he glad to take it off your
hands. Anv color will do.
