## R&DE must act on summer costs 
### 
At last night's Dining Committee meeting,
discussion of the summer meal plan issue
continued. Disappointingly, though the
dining committee first discussed this issue
last year, no progress has been made to reduce the
unreasonable costs of summer meal plans for Stan
ford students.
Residential & Dining Enterprises must take the
lead in finding an integrated solution to the summer
dining problem. Though the efforts of the Stanford
Dining financial staff should be commended, they
cannot solve the summer cost issue alone. They need
help from Residential & Dining Enterprises' resi
dential side to efficiently place summer students in
residences in a way that is cost-effective for students.
It is unreasonable to expect the Dining Advisory
Committee — composed of dining managers and
student representatives — to succeed as the primary
forum for discussing the issue. Since relevant budget
information — such as the operating costs of Flo
rence Moore Dining, the portions of income at
tributable to conferees / students and their respec
tive remainder contributions to "overhead" — is not
available to the dining committee, it is not equipped
to effectively address the issue.
However, the Dining Committee can and does

serve as a forum for expressing student opinion. The
committee has not only provided personal and rep
resentative input to administrators, but also commis
sioned the summer dining survey that clearly indi
cates an overwhelming student desire for summer
cost reforms.
Options do exist to address the summer meal plan
issue this year. First, the days of foodservice could he
adjusted to more closely mirror the ten weeks of
summer academic activities. In addition, future bud
gets could be prepared without forcing all summer
students to pay so much of the "overhead" that
would still exist without them. A critical analysis of
these "overhead" costs could also yield additional
long-run cost savings. Another potential source of
student cost savings would be untying spring-sum
mer interim housing (which adds an approximately
$150 fee fora service many students don't use) from
summer housing.
Regardless of where the savings come from. Res
idential & Dining Enterprises must proactivelv find
solutions to the summer cost problem. This should
entail a reduction in this summer's minimum housing
cost compared to last year, as well as a long-term
commitment to offering at least one dining plan in
the $400-600 price range.
