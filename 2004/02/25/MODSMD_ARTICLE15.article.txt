# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## Mac does the honors (thesis) 
### 
Until the beginning of this
quarter, I was busy writing
an honors thesis. I was a
senior dedicated to the
noble academic pursuit of research
ing the Common Foreign and Securi
ty Policy of the European Union. My
parents were more excited than-R
Kelly at a Paly High dance.
And then reality sunk in.
I don't really care that much about
the European Union — and definite
ly not enough to complete a 75-plus
page thesis since 1 have a finance job
already in hand for next year.
So the thesis was cast aside, with
chances of a comeback as legitimate
as those of MC Hammer. Truthfully,
my mind is just elsewhere.
I don't think the problem is that I
lack the desire to research and write a
thesis. It's just that I didn't pick the
right topic. When it comes down to it,
Luxembourg's views on a common
European defense force in the wake of
the war in Iraq just don't do it for me.
That said, I definitely possess the
same infectious intellectual curiosity
as other students in the honors pro
gram. But the questions that usually
stimulate my mind aren't as "respect
ed" in the academic powerhouse that
is Stanford.
For instance, I spend hours won
dering: How does Sean Penn maintain
credibility as an actor with a porn star
mustache that Ron Jeremy could only
dream of? Or, why do girls always do
that half-dance-hall-walk-shimmy
upon entering a new room at a party?
Are all girls that self-conscious?
I may not toss and turn in bed pon
dering the fate of the E.U.'s constitu
tional convention — but I can say
that I couldn't fall asleep for hours
one night last week because of an un
forgivable inability to remember
A.C. Slater's full name on "Saved by
the Bell." For those of you con
cerned, I finally remembered it was
Albert Clifford around 4 a.m. and
pleasantly drifted away into a sweet
slumber soon after.
I also think long and hard about
constructing a solid research design.

However, in my case, the purpose of
the experiment would be to determine
what would happen if you locked Gary

Busey, Lawrence
Taylor and George
Clinton in a room
and had them fight
over the last vial of
crack on earth. I
believe that Busey
has dual citizen
ship in Canada
and that, as a re
sult, U.N. peace
keeping forces

would definitely be called in to medi
ate — so I'm pretty sure the heads of
the international relations honors pro
gram would have approved this topic.
Further, the politics of the Ameri
can presidency have always interest
ed me, so maybe I should have
looked there fora thesis idea. Per
haps I could have examined why —as
the powerful man in the world — Bill
Clinton chose a needy, overweight
tramp over every other White House
intern at his disposal. Clearly, the
U.S. president can get more ass than
a toilet seat, but I seriously doubt that
any study has examined how a presi
dent would match up with a new hit
"boy band" in a "booty-off" contest.
Research into this query could fill a
huge void in the academic community.
Life here at Stanford also presents
a wide array of fascinating research
questions worthy of scholarship. For
example — who is the most hated
person on campus? Might it be one of
the members of the Ashcroft-like Of
fice of Student Activities, which has
launched a war on fun at Stanford
reminiscent of our fine U.S. Attorney
General's attack on civil liberties?
Speaking of prominent Republi
cans, perhaps I could have looked at
why every famous conservative in
this country ends up getting caught
doing the one thing he has spent his
lives preaching against. My research
could have examined whether Rush
Limbaugh (drugs), William Bennett
(gambling). Newt Gingrich (adul
tery) and Strom Thurmond (interra

cial affair and baby out of wedlock)
should be forced to pay back the mil
lions of dollars they've made off
being sanctimonious hypocrites —
or, better yet, be made to work as
naked cooks at Synergy for the next
decade. (Strom, 1 guess you missed
out, buddy.)
And then there are the pressing
questions about the entertainment
industry that Stanford's Journal of
International Relations inevitably
glosses over.
Who took better advantage of
their 15 minutes of fame, Kato
Kaelin or Joe Millionaire? Is one
night with Hillary Duff worth a six
month stint in prison? What are the
odds that Andre Agassi and Steffi
Graf's son will win Wimbledon in
2025? Who would win in a fight, Bill
O'Reilly or A1 Franken? Why is the
mullet getting so much love, while
the rat-tail is left out in the cold? And
could Snoop Dogg smoke all the
weed in Humboldt County in a
month if he put his mind — and his
lungs — to the test?
As I'm sure everyone would
agree that all of these questions are
undoubtedly worthy of an honors
thesis. And. if you're scoring at
home, I think Kato Kaelin takes the
cake, Hillary Duff is definitely
worth it, Jaden Gil Agassi will win in
2025, A1 Franken would kick
O'Reilly's ass all the way out of the
"No Spin Zone," the rat-tail is just a
little too trailer-park for the main
stream and Snoop could get the job
done — but he might need assis
tance from Nate Dogg and the rest
of the Dogg Pound.
Unfortunately, though, I never
put in the time and energy that these
questions deserve. And, clearly, the
IR honors program and the academic
community as a whole are at a loss be
cause of it.

forgivable inability to remember
A.C. Slater's full name on "Saved by
the Bell." For those of you con
cerned, I finally remembered it was
Albert Clifford around 4 a.m. and
pleasantly drifted away into a sweet
slumber soon after.
I also think long and hard about
constructing a solid research design.

However, in my case, the purpose of
the experiment would be to determine
what would happen if you locked Gary

Busey, Lawrence
Taylor and George
Clinton in a room
and had them fight
over the last vial of
crack on earth. I
believe that Busey
has dual citizen
ship in Canada
and that, as a re
sult, U.N. peace
keeping forces

would definitely be called in to medi
ate — so I'm pretty sure the heads of
the international relations honors pro
gram would have approved this topic.
Further, the politics of the Ameri
can presidency have always interest
ed me, so maybe I should have
looked there fora thesis idea. Per
haps I could have examined why —as
the powerful man in the world — Bill
Clinton chose a needy, overweight
tramp over every other White House
intern at his disposal. Clearly, the
U.S. president can get more ass than
a toilet seat, but I seriously doubt that
any study has examined how a presi
dent would match up with a new hit
"boy band" in a "booty-off" contest.
Research into this query could fill a
huge void in the academic community.
Life here at Stanford also presents
a wide array of fascinating research
questions worthy of scholarship. For
example — who is the most hated
person on campus? Might it be one of
the members of the Ashcroft-like Of
fice of Student Activities, which has
launched a war on fun at Stanford
reminiscent of our fine U.S. Attorney
General's attack on civil liberties?
Speaking of prominent Republi
cans, perhaps I could have looked at
why every famous conservative in
this country ends up getting caught
doing the one thing he has spent his
lives preaching against. My research
could have examined whether Rush
Limbaugh (drugs), William Bennett
(gambling). Newt Gingrich (adul
tery) and Strom Thurmond (interra

cial affair and baby out of wedlock)
should be forced to pay back the mil
lions of dollars they've made off
being sanctimonious hypocrites —
or, better yet, be made to work as
naked cooks at Synergy for the next
decade. (Strom, 1 guess you missed
out, buddy.)
And then there are the pressing
questions about the entertainment
industry that Stanford's Journal of
International Relations inevitably
glosses over.
Who took better advantage of
their 15 minutes of fame, Kato
Kaelin or Joe Millionaire? Is one
night with Hillary Duff worth a six
month stint in prison? What are the
odds that Andre Agassi and Steffi
Graf's son will win Wimbledon in
2025? Who would win in a fight, Bill
O'Reilly or A1 Franken? Why is the
mullet getting so much love, while
the rat-tail is left out in the cold? And
could Snoop Dogg smoke all the
weed in Humboldt County in a
month if he put his mind — and his
lungs — to the test?
As I'm sure everyone would
agree that all of these questions are
undoubtedly worthy of an honors
thesis. And. if you're scoring at
home, I think Kato Kaelin takes the
cake, Hillary Duff is definitely
worth it, Jaden Gil Agassi will win in
2025, A1 Franken would kick
O'Reilly's ass all the way out of the
"No Spin Zone," the rat-tail is just a
little too trailer-park for the main
stream and Snoop could get the job
done — but he might need assis
tance from Nate Dogg and the rest
of the Dogg Pound.
Unfortunately, though, I never
put in the time and energy that these
questions deserve. And, clearly, the
IR honors program and the academic
community as a whole are at a loss be
cause of it.

Until the beginning of this
quarter, I was busy writing
an honors thesis. I was a
senior dedicated to the
noble academic pursuit of research
ing the Common Foreign and Securi
ty Policy of the European Union. My
parents were more excited than-R
Kelly at a Paly High dance.
And then reality sunk in.
I don't really care that much about
the European Union — and definite
ly not enough to complete a 75-plus
page thesis since 1 have a finance job
already in hand for next year.
So the thesis was cast aside, with
chances of a comeback as legitimate
as those of MC Hammer. Truthfully,
my mind is just elsewhere.
I don't think the problem is that I
lack the desire to research and write a
thesis. It's just that I didn't pick the
right topic. When it comes down to it,
Luxembourg's views on a common
European defense force in the wake of
the war in Iraq just don't do it for me.
That said, I definitely possess the
same infectious intellectual curiosity
as other students in the honors pro
gram. But the questions that usually
stimulate my mind aren't as "respect
ed" in the academic powerhouse that
is Stanford.
For instance, I spend hours won
dering: How does Sean Penn maintain
credibility as an actor with a porn star
mustache that Ron Jeremy could only
dream of? Or, why do girls always do
that half-dance-hall-walk-shimmy
upon entering a new room at a party?
Are all girls that self-conscious?
I may not toss and turn in bed pon
dering the fate of the E.U.'s constitu
tional convention — but I can say
that I couldn't fall asleep for hours
one night last week because of an un
forgivable inability to remember
A.C. Slater's full name on "Saved by
the Bell." For those of you con
