# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## Osama in the house? 
### 
Have U.S. authorities cap
tured Osama Bin Laden?
If certain international pa
pers are to be believed, he
is currently surrounded by U.S. forces
and will be taken into custody at the
soonest politically expedient moment.
No, you haven't seen this reported in
the U.S. press — not even the story
that other press organizations are re
porting an Osama capture. But does
that mean the story is pure fiction?
Since 1 took a few swipes last week
at the press, everyone's favorite
whipping boy, why stop now? The
Osama rumors may be equal parts
conspiracy theory and overseas anti-
U.S. propaganda — but the weak
one-source only coverage of the war
in Iraq leaves a few questions about
the independence of America's
"Fifth Estate."
I'll get to the Osama story in a sec
ond, but first let's take a look at the
ineffectiveness of an "embedded"
press during the war. It sounded like
a good idea at the beginning of the
war last year, but consider the trouble
of suiting journalists up for war along
side soldiers, arming them and even
asking them to set down notebooks
and pick up stretchers or stand guard
over an enemy.
The Pentagon's plan of folding
thousands of would-be war correspon
dents into military units during the
Iraqi war allowed journalists to report
from the frontlines with some degree
of safety and gave them a more realis
tic idea of the life of a soldier.
But embedded journalists con
fuse the role of the press. The idea is
that there must be some kind of free
press to oversee the government's
use of tax dollars and power. If a re
porter is buried too deep, where's the
oversight?
In my mind, this was a Pentagon
trick to leverage and control journal
istic access to the news. Reporters that
didn't toe the official line in war cov
erage lost access, and journalistic free
agents in Iraq were lost and lonely —
ignored by the military and on their

own for protection. Just ask Geraldo
Rivera — a war zone is a pretty scary
place to have no friends. Not surpris-

ingly, most news
outlets went the
embedded-jour
nalist route.
Poor coverage,
however, had start
ed even before the
war commenced.

Rumsfeld received from the media?
Press conferences felt like love-ins
rather than what they should have
been — a confrontation of the people
with the powers-that-be.
All the questions that should have
been asked then are coming up now,
of course, but wouldn't they have
been more appropriate before the
country sacrificed so many sons and
daughters and destroyed the potency
of the United Nations? The press
didn't check power; they were a little
drunk on the idea of playing soldier in
the desert.
So what does this have to do with
the possible capture of the most want
ed man on the planet? I haven't a clue
of what is true or not, but I do think
the American press on the whole
doesn't push much harder than the
Defense Department's press releases
and, in most cases, the truth lies some
where between the official military re
port and the story carried in the for
eign press.
Think of the conflicting rescue
stories of Private Jessica Lynch and
recall the somewhat unbelievable
circumstances surrounding the cap
ture of Saddam Hussein. These
high-profile stories send the mes
sage that the mainstream press
prints without questioning the Pen
tagon's releases, and the press will
not hoJd the Bush administration re
sponsible for false reports or for
conflicting statements. The public, it
appears, doesn't really care.

So here is the Osama juice. Be
warned that the information comes to
us through one unnamed source. But
considering that most of our military
information comes to us from one
source — the government — time
will be the judge of what is true or not:
Two British papers. The Sunday
Telegraph and The Sunday Express,
reported Osama Bin Laden is sur
rounded by U.S. Special Forces in an
area of land bordering northwest Pak
istan and Afghanistan.
The claim is attributed to "a well
placed intelligence source" in Wash
ington, who is quoted as saying: "He
[Bin Laden] is boxed in."
The papers say the hostile terrain
makes an all-out conventional military
assault impossible. The plan to cap
ture him would depend on a "grab
him-and-go" style operation.
"U.S. helicopters already sited on
the Afghanistan border will swoop in
to extricate him," The Telegraph
wrote. It claims Bin Laden and his
men "sleep in caves or out in the open.
The area is swept by fierce snow
storms howling down from the 10,000
foot-high mountain peaks. Donkeys
are the only transport."
The U.S. Special Forces are "abso
lutely confident" there is no escape
for Bin Laden, and are awaiting the
order to go in and get him. The timing
of that order will ultimately depend
on President Bush, the source said.
"Capturing Bin Laden will certainly
be a huge help for him as he gets ready
for the election."
On Thursday last week. General
Richard Myers, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff said the United
States had been engaged in "intense"
efforts to capture Bin Laden, who
was believed to be hiding in the bor
der area between Pakistan and
Afghanistan. But he insisted that the
focus of the search had not narrowed
for months.

So what does this have to do with
the possible capture of the most want
ed man on the planet? I haven't a clue
of what is true or not, but I do think
the American press on the whole
doesn't push much harder than the
Defense Department's press releases
and, in most cases, the truth lies some
where between the official military re
port and the story carried in the for
eign press.
Think of the conflicting rescue
stories of Private Jessica Lynch and
recall the somewhat unbelievable
circumstances surrounding the cap
ture of Saddam Hussein. These
high-profile stories send the mes
sage that the mainstream press
prints without questioning the Pen
tagon's releases, and the press will
not hoJd the Bush administration re
sponsible for false reports or for
conflicting statements. The public, it
appears, doesn't really care.

So here is the Osama juice. Be
warned that the information comes to
us through one unnamed source. But
considering that most of our military
information comes to us from one
source — the government — time
will be the judge of what is true or not:
Two British papers. The Sunday
Telegraph and The Sunday Express,
reported Osama Bin Laden is sur
rounded by U.S. Special Forces in an
area of land bordering northwest Pak
istan and Afghanistan.
The claim is attributed to "a well
placed intelligence source" in Wash
ington, who is quoted as saying: "He
[Bin Laden] is boxed in."
The papers say the hostile terrain
makes an all-out conventional military
assault impossible. The plan to cap
ture him would depend on a "grab
him-and-go" style operation.
"U.S. helicopters already sited on
the Afghanistan border will swoop in
to extricate him," The Telegraph
wrote. It claims Bin Laden and his
men "sleep in caves or out in the open.
The area is swept by fierce snow
storms howling down from the 10,000
foot-high mountain peaks. Donkeys
are the only transport."
The U.S. Special Forces are "abso
lutely confident" there is no escape
for Bin Laden, and are awaiting the
order to go in and get him. The timing
of that order will ultimately depend
on President Bush, the source said.
"Capturing Bin Laden will certainly
be a huge help for him as he gets ready
for the election."
On Thursday last week. General
Richard Myers, chairman of the U.S.
Joint Chiefs of Staff said the United
States had been engaged in "intense"
efforts to capture Bin Laden, who
was believed to be hiding in the bor
der area between Pakistan and
Afghanistan. But he insisted that the
focus of the search had not narrowed
for months.

Have U.S. authorities cap
tured Osama Bin Laden?
If certain international pa
pers are to be believed, he
is currently surrounded by U.S. forces
and will be taken into custody at the
soonest politically expedient moment.
No, you haven't seen this reported in
the U.S. press — not even the story
that other press organizations are re
porting an Osama capture. But does
that mean the story is pure fiction?
Since 1 took a few swipes last week
at the press, everyone's favorite
whipping boy, why stop now? The
Osama rumors may be equal parts
conspiracy theory and overseas anti-
U.S. propaganda — but the weak
one-source only coverage of the war
in Iraq leaves a few questions about
the independence of America's
"Fifth Estate."
I'll get to the Osama story in a sec
ond, but first let's take a look at the
ineffectiveness of an "embedded"
press during the war. It sounded like
a good idea at the beginning of the
war last year, but consider the trouble
of suiting journalists up for war along
side soldiers, arming them and even
asking them to set down notebooks
and pick up stretchers or stand guard
over an enemy.
The Pentagon's plan of folding
thousands of would-be war correspon
dents into military units during the
Iraqi war allowed journalists to report
from the frontlines with some degree
of safety and gave them a more realis
tic idea of the life of a soldier.
But embedded journalists con
fuse the role of the press. The idea is
that there must be some kind of free
press to oversee the government's
use of tax dollars and power. If a re
porter is buried too deep, where's the
oversight?
In my mind, this was a Pentagon
trick to leverage and control journal
istic access to the news. Reporters that
didn't toe the official line in war cov
erage lost access, and journalistic free
agents in Iraq were lost and lonely —
ignored by the military and on their

own for protection. Just ask Geraldo
Rivera — a war zone is a pretty scary
place to have no friends. Not surpris-

ingly, most news
outlets went the
embedded-jour
nalist route.
Poor coverage,
however, had start
ed even before the
war commenced.
Remember the
rock star treat
ment Secretary of
Defense Donald
n r_i j : i

Rumsfeld received from the media?
Press conferences felt like love-ins
rather than what they should have
been — a confrontation of the people
with the powers-that-be.
All the questions that should have
been asked then are coming up now,
of course, but wouldn't they have
been more appropriate before the
country sacrificed so many sons and
daughters and destroyed the potency
of the United Nations? The press
didn't check power; they were a little
drunk on the idea of playing soldier in
the desert.
So what does this have to do with
the possible capture of the most want
ed man on the planet? I haven't a clue
