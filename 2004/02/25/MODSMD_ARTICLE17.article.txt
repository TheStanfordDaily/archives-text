## ASSU clarifies specifics of recent special-fees legislation 
### KYLE ALISHARAN 
The Stanford Daily's editorial on ASSU
special fees ("Changes to special fee are not
enough," Feb. 23) mischaracterizes the
ASSU's legislation and fails to disclose the
fact that The Daily itself receives special
fees and would benefit from the changes
suggested in the editorial.
According to the editorial, the special
fees legislation recently passed relies main
ly on the "belated redistribution of special
fee funds," which, according to the editorial
means that "funds the student body voted in
favor of allocating to your organization
could be confiscated by the ASSU in order
to cover the debt of the Students' Organiza
tions Fund." As the ASSU financial manag
er and a member of the special-fees com

mittee, I have been intimately involved with
this issue and had to read the article twice to
figure out what exactly was being stated.
Let me translate. "Debt of the Students' Or
ganizations Fund" means refunds request
ed by the student body from specific special
fee groups. "Belated redistribution of spe
cial fee funds" means that groups will be re
sponsible for paying their refunds. Togeth
er, these mean that the ASSU will hold
groups accountable for refunds requested
from their group, a practice the editorial
goes on to discredit as a "burden ... im
posed on student organizations that depend
on special fees."
The solution is simple. The ASSU is a
middle man. It breaks down like this:
1) Students vote to give student groups
funding.

-2) The ASSU collects money from stu
dents and distributes it to student groups.
3) Individual students request refunds
from student groups.
4) The ASSU collects money from stu
dent groups and gives it students.
I don't have a problem with The Daily's
taking issue with this approach, but to char
acterize it as a method to cover ASSU debt
is grossly misleading. The ASSU has not
carried any debt, now or in the past decade,
and does not benefit financially from run
ning the special-fees system. If The Daily is
interested in motivating a useful discussion
on refunds it must first present the issue
clearly and accurately.
The editorial goes on to present alter
native suggestions, several of which are
well thought out and could benefit from

further discussion. The special-fees com
mittee has and will continue to discuss
specific guidelines for how past refund
rates should be weighed and the possibili
ty of raising the requirements for groups
to get on the special-fees ballot. In fact,
the legislation passed last week included
both by-law and policy changes containing
significant initiatives to limit the number
of groups on the ballot. The legislation
stopped short of the editorial's sugges
tions partly because the constitution can
not be changed without referendum —
which requires the support of 15 percent
of the student body and approval by the
Board of Trustees — and partly because
raising the petition requirements for
groups to get on the ballot has the nega
tive side effect of penalizing new, relative

ly unknown groups. To The Daily's credit,
this is pointed out in the editorial. Howev
er, the editorial fails to mention this policy
would favor groups with a long history of
receivingspecial fees and that The Daily is
one of these groups. Similar to profession
al news organizations, The Daily should
disclose its relationship to the special fees
system if it going to pass judgment on a
process in which it has a clear vested inter
est. That said, I would like to thank the
Daily editorial staff for its suggestions and
assure students that these suggestions will
be discussed further.
