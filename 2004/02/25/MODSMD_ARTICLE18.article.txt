Students react to Israel-Palestine ad
I was deeply upset to read David
Horowitz's narrow characterization of
Arabs' beliefs in an advertisement run in The
Daily. He stitches together a shoddy collage
that portrays Arabs as uniformly hating Jews,
blacks, pluralism, tolerance, peace — you
name it. And once he sets up this false image,
he uses it to condemn and hang all Arabs.
Ironically, it seems that the "terrorism ex
perts" have hijacked the media and demand
ed that they — and certainly not Arabs them
selves — have the right to distill into a head
line what 280 million Arabs believe.
That said, I encourage The Daily's read
ers to join the Middle East Issues Dialogue
dinner series, which has created a space
where community members can listen to
varying perspectives on issues in the Middle
East. Through these discussions, I have
learned that what looks through binoculars
like "the enemy front" quickly dissolves
once individual voices are heard up close
around the dinner table; that reality makes
the wholesale condemnation of a group dif
ficult, if not dishonest. Indeed, if Horowitz
skipped the monologue and joined our dia
logue, he might be surprised to find a plural
ity of Arab opinions.

I'd like to address several issues brought
up by Ammar Nayfeh in his op-ed in The
Daily ("Advertisement misrepresented
historical events in Palestine," Feb. 24). He
goes to great lengths to show how Israel

"exiled and dispossessed" the Palestinians
in 1948. After reading his letter, one may
think that Israel just turned on a peaceful
population without provocation. That is
very far from accurate: After Ben-Gurion
pronounced the birth of Israel on May 15,
1948, the armies of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq,
Jordan and Egypt attacked the Israeli state.
Prior to that — and immediately after
the U.N. resolution on the division of
Palestine — many Palestinian Arabs rioted
and attacked Jewish communities in a pre
liminary onslaught. Nayfeh conveniently
skips over these occurrences and only
speaks of the "aftermath of the war of
1948," failing to mention Arab aggression
that led to the war.
Nayfeh also states that Jews wanted a
state "with decisive Jewish majority" and
decided to exile the Palestinian population.
However, if Jews were the ones with a dia
bolical plan to commit "ethnic cleansing,"
why did five Arab states attack Israel in the
first days of its existence? The 1947 en
counter between the British officer and the
Zionist officer mentioned by Nayfeh is very
dubious evidence for Israel's alleged plans
to exile the Palestinians. The mysterious
Zionist officer is not named and is most like
ly not a representative or spokesperson for
the Israeli government at the time.
Nayfeh also states that the massacre of
Deir Yassin was premeditated, but offers no
supporting proof for such confidence. If we
talk about premeditated, "systematic and
deliberate" massacres, Palestinian suicide
bombers are excellent examples of that.
What can be more deliberate than entering
a bus full of teenagers going to school, blow
ing them up and then glorifying the act? As

the op-ed states, "Crimes against humanity
are intentional acts systematically and delib
erately committed by any individual or
group against a civilian population." Fits
the situation well, doesn't it?

The Stanford Review beauty contest
objectifies women
I received a mass e-mail on Monday
evening entitled, "Wanted: conservative
woman." It claims to celebrate Stanford's
cultural diversity by seeking a beautiful rep
resentative of this "marginalized minority."
While mocking the serious issues of preju
dice and stereotypes, this ad also perpetu
ates a very real manifestation of marginal
ization: the objectification of women. Even
though the prize categories mention intel
lectual ability, the dominant image in the e
mail is a scantily dressed, thin, conventional
ly beautiful young woman. This image de
values women, whether or not they meet the
beauty criteria; it communicates that they
are valued on the basis of appearance rather
than who they are.
The media repeats this message every
day. Society trains us to recognize a certain
standard of beauty. Why don't we see that
all women are beautiful? If The Stanford
Review wants to show support for the con
servative, bright, young women on campus,
it should find another way. If this e-mail
doesn't bother you, I challenge you to ask
yourself why.

University should offer minority groups
equal funding opportunities
A university has a responsibility to offer
student groups equal funding opportunities
and to protect groups from homophobia,
racism and other prejudices in the process of
allocating funds. The special fees and special
fees refund system are a form of indirect dis
crimination that adversely affects sexual,
racial, ethnic and other minorities.
The only queer organization to receive
special fees — Masque Magazine — is also
the organization with the highest refund
rate, despite having the second lowest fund
ing request of all groups. The other organi
zations with the highest refund rates repre
sent racial and ethnic minorities. Not sur
prisingly, these groups also tend to be the
ones that passed the special-fees vote by
only a minute fraction to begin with. These
statistics do not correspond to the inherent
quality of these student groups or the extent
of their contributions to university life, but
rather to the social prejudices of the voting
student body.
Homophobia and racism affect all stu
dents, and in addressing these and similar is
sues these minority groups represent the in
terests of everyone on campus. Subjecting
these groups to a student body vote and
making refunds as easy as the click of a
mouse allows the forces of homophobia and
racism, which these minority groups are
working against, to revoke their funding.
The amount of money a group can re
quest from a general fund is much less
than the amount that can be requested

through special fees, forcing minority
groups to cut their budgets while groups
with rich- straight-white-people written
between the lines of their mainstream ap
peal continue to expand their budgets
each year. The limit set on a general fund
request versus a special- fees fund request
is arbitrary and cannot assume to mathe
matically embody the limited effect or rel
evance an oppressed group can have on a
student body versus the effect of a non-op
pressed group.
Effectively forcing non-mainstream
groups to divide amongst themselves fora
finite general fund also pits minorities
against each other as adversaries and cuts
off any hope of continuity of funding from
year to year. In an atmosphere in which
there is high membership turnover due to
graduation, the last thing student groups
need is an inconsistent source of funding
that they must fight for amongst them
selves every year. The amount the groups
can earn from the Stanford Fund and other
sources is also only a fraction of what spe
cial fees provides.
If the University cannot afford to or is
otherwise unwilling to provide all student
groups with an equal and unbiased opportu
nity to access funds through a process like
special fees, then it shouldn't allow any stu
dent groups this opportunity. The funding
process at a University should be based on
the merit of student groups and the quality
of their contributions to student life, not on
their popularity amongst a prejudiced stu
dent body.

dubious evidence for Israel's alleged plans
to exile the Palestinians. The mysterious
Zionist officer is not named and is most like

the Israeli government at the time.
Nayfeh also states that the massacre of
Deir Yassin was premeditated, but offers no

talk about premeditated, "systematic and

The Stanford Review beauty contest
objectifies women
I received a mass e-mail on Monday
evening entitled, "Wanted: conservative
woman." It claims to celebrate Stanford's
cultural diversity by seeking a beautiful rep
resentative of this "marginalized minority."
While mocking the serious issues of preju
dice and stereotypes, this ad also perpetu
ates a very real manifestation of marginal
ization: the objectification of women. Even
though the prize categories mention intel
lectual ability, the dominant image in the e
mail is a scantily dressed, thin, conventional
ly beautiful young woman. This image de
values women, whether or not they meet the
beauty criteria; it communicates that they
are valued on the basis of appearance rather
than who they are.
The media repeats this message every
day. Society trains us to recognize a certain
standard of beauty. Why don't we see that
all women are beautiful? If The Stanford
Review wants to show support for the con
servative, bright, young women on campus,
it should find another way. If this e-mail
doesn't bother you, I challenge you to ask
yourself why.

University should offer minority groups
equal funding opportunities
A university has a responsibility to offer
student groups equal funding opportunities
and to protect groups from homophobia,
racism and other prejudices in the process of
allocating funds. The special fees and special
fees refund system are a form of indirect dis
crimination that adversely affects sexual,
racial, ethnic and other minorities.
The only queer organization to receive
special fees — Masque Magazine — is also
the organization with the highest refund
rate, despite having the second lowest fund
ing request of all groups. The other organi
zations with the highest refund rates repre
sent racial and ethnic minorities. Not sur
prisingly, these groups also tend to be the
ones that passed the special-fees vote by
only a minute fraction to begin with. These
statistics do not correspond to the inherent
quality of these student groups or the extent
of their contributions to university life, but
rather to the social prejudices of the voting
student body.
Homophobia and racism affect all stu
dents, and in addressing these and similar is
sues these minority groups represent the in
terests of everyone on campus. Subjecting
these groups to a student body vote and
making refunds as easy as the click of a
mouse allows the forces of homophobia and
racism, which these minority groups are
working against, to revoke their funding.
The amount of money a group can re
quest from a general fund is much less
than the amount that can be requested

through special fees, forcing minority
groups to cut their budgets while groups
with rich- straight-white-people written
between the lines of their mainstream ap
peal continue to expand their budgets
each year. The limit set on a general fund
request versus a special- fees fund request
is arbitrary and cannot assume to mathe
matically embody the limited effect or rel
evance an oppressed group can have on a
student body versus the effect of a non-op
pressed group.
Effectively forcing non-mainstream
groups to divide amongst themselves fora
finite general fund also pits minorities
against each other as adversaries and cuts
off any hope of continuity of funding from
year to year. In an atmosphere in which
there is high membership turnover due to
graduation, the last thing student groups
need is an inconsistent source of funding
that they must fight for amongst them
selves every year. The amount the groups
can earn from the Stanford Fund and other
sources is also only a fraction of what spe
cial fees provides.
If the University cannot afford to or is
otherwise unwilling to provide all student
groups with an equal and unbiased opportu
nity to access funds through a process like
special fees, then it shouldn't allow any stu
dent groups this opportunity. The funding
process at a University should be based on
the merit of student groups and the quality
of their contributions to student life, not on
their popularity amongst a prejudiced stu
dent body.

Students react to Israel-Palestine ad
I was deeply upset to read David
Horowitz's narrow characterization of
Arabs' beliefs in an advertisement run in The
Daily. He stitches together a shoddy collage
that portrays Arabs as uniformly hating Jews,
blacks, pluralism, tolerance, peace — you
name it. And once he sets up this false image,
he uses it to condemn and hang all Arabs.
Ironically, it seems that the "terrorism ex
perts" have hijacked the media and demand
ed that they — and certainly not Arabs them
selves — have the right to distill into a head
line what 280 million Arabs believe.
That said, I encourage The Daily's read
ers to join the Middle East Issues Dialogue
dinner series, which has created a space
where community members can listen to
varying perspectives on issues in the Middle
East. Through these discussions, I have
learned that what looks through binoculars
like "the enemy front" quickly dissolves
once individual voices are heard up close
around the dinner table; that reality makes
the wholesale condemnation of a group dif
ficult, if not dishonest. Indeed, if Horowitz
skipped the monologue and joined our dia
logue, he might be surprised to find a plural
ity of Arab opinions.

I'd like to address several issues brought
up by Ammar Nayfeh in his op-ed in The
Daily ("Advertisement misrepresented
historical events in Palestine," Feb. 24). He
goes to great lengths to show how Israel

"exiled and dispossessed" the Palestinians
in 1948. After reading his letter, one may
think that Israel just turned on a peaceful
population without provocation. That is
very far from accurate: After Ben-Gurion
pronounced the birth of Israel on May 15,
1948, the armies of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq,
Jordan and Egypt attacked the Israeli state.
Prior to that — and immediately after
the U.N. resolution on the division of
Palestine — many Palestinian Arabs rioted
and attacked Jewish communities in a pre
liminary onslaught. Nayfeh conveniently
skips over these occurrences and only
speaks of the "aftermath of the war of
1948," failing to mention Arab aggression
that led to the war.
Nayfeh also states that Jews wanted a
state "with decisive Jewish majority" and
decided to exile the Palestinian population.
However, if Jews were the ones with a dia
bolical plan to commit "ethnic cleansing,"
why did five Arab states attack Israel in the
first days of its existence? The 1947 en
counter between the British officer and the
Zionist officer mentioned by Nayfeh is very
dubious evidence for Israel's alleged plans
to exile the Palestinians. The mysterious
Zionist officer is not named and is most like
