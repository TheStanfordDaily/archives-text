## Stanford kids need to step up the hatred 
### 
Listen up, fellow Cardinal bour
geoisie: We are the enemy. We don't
seem to know or care much, but our
nemesis across the Bay is wishing
death on us with every waking breath.
Cal students hate you more than you will
ever know. At Cal, from day one of new stu
dent orientation, you are ingrained with the
notion that Stanford sucks. Wearing a Stan
ford sweatshirt on the street is enough to get
rotten food thrown at you. Playing Stanford is
tantamount to a holy war and a Cal-Stanford
game in any sport is the culmination of the en
tire season's efforts. But at Stanford, where
you spend all your time beating everyone else,
your rival is often just an artificially important
game at the end of a long campaign.
When our basketball team went into Haas
Pavilion two weekends ago, it was by far the
single most important part of Cal's season.
They had the opport unity of playing the spoil-

er for their favorite oppo
nent, while also clinging to
tenuous Big Dance dreams.
For Stanford, though, it
was just another step closer
to the goals of another Pacif
ic-10 Conference champi
onship and an undefeated
season. And when we left,
nothing was really different
for the Cardinal: One more

tally had been added to our already-swollen
W-column. But the Bears' season was effec
tively over; their postseason hopes were all
but dashed and now they likely will have to
win the Pac-10 Tournament to earn an
NCAA berth. For Stanford, it was just anoth
er game. For Cal, it was another chapter in the
"Reasons to Hate Stanford" tome.
Our ongoing battle with Berkeley is less a
rivalry than it is a dominator-dominated rela
tionship. Let's not bring up academics or ath
letics; we're arrogant enough as it is and it
only fuels Cal's ability to perceive itself as the
gritty, Rudy-esque underdog taking on the
Man. Cal loves to see itself as the proletariat
— the teeming masses waiting to overthrow
the mustache-twirling robber barons from
across the Bay.
A lot of this mentality comes from the fes
tering civic sore that is Berkeley itself. The
urban planning and zoning was apparently ex
ecuted by trained chimps. Porno shops sit
next to family eating establishments and
stores that sell 80 different varieties of bongs.
Men in George W. Bush masks sit on street
corners and scream "GIVE ME YOUR
OIL!" at passersby.
Due to this environment, downtown
Berkeley fits pretty much every stereotype
that is leveled against it. It's a Bohemian mar
ketplace of ideas, but it's also a place where
you're fairly likely to be stabbed or urinated
on by a street person. Spending all your time
looking over your shoulder to make sure a
dreadlocked blur doesn't steal your wallet to
finance his Berkeley Anarchists discussion
group's snacks for that day makes you tough,
and that toughness manifests itself through
the type of steely-eyed, leather-lunged hatred
that we don't have here in the Bubble. Cal stu
dents are surprisingly hardcore — and with
good reason.
Cal students know what makes a rivalry. It
isn't about a friendly relationship with a local
opponent that manifests itself through clean,
invigorating competition on the athletic
fields. To them, it's a war. When 80,000 Cal
students scream "BEARS!" in unison in
Memorial Stadium, it's almost enough to turn
the tide of athletic talent in the opposite di
rection — best demonstrated in Southern
California's lone gridiron loss this year. You
can almost hear the bloodlust in their voices.
While we're content to chortle to ourselves
and put together oh-so-witty cheers about our
academic brilliance, they're busy figuring out
how much Ouikrete and bleach it would take
to blow up Stanford Stadium.
As much as I hate being on the bad side of
this analogy, we are the Yankees of this rela
tionship. While Red Sox fans spend their
every waking moment cursing the existence
of George Steinbrenner and burning Bucky
Dent and Aaron Boone in effigy, Yankee fans
are at best dimly aware of their rivals' feelings.
Whereas Cal's entire sporting universe cen
ters around beating Stanford, from our per
spective Cal is just another, slightly more im
portant opponent. Stanford students, by and
large, just don't care about Cal.
All this comes together to mean that while
we may win a lot on the field, it's not for the
other side's lack of enthusiasm. In this case,
we could take a lesson from our lessers and
pick up some of that fire. We need more fierce
desire to beat Cal, more abject hatred. Talent
may win ball games, but seething, blinding
rage toward your opponent always helps. So
do your part and hate Cal a little bit more, and
remember that somewhere the Bears are re
turning the favor.
