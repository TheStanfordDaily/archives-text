# Students try out to be Tree
## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
A group of students gathered
in the Band Shak Monday
evening to embark on a quest to
be the next Stanford Tree — or,
as this year's Tree Will Rothacker
puts it,"the next member of the
most exclusive club of lucky bas
tards on campus."
Stanford Band Manager Stella
Cousins, a senior, estimated that the
number of prospective Trees is
roughly "three and a half times the
population of Palau," including
three who attended the information
session via conference call from
overseas.
According to Band member Amy
Blasberg, a senior, the mascot candi
dates performed their first stunts at
Monday's meeting and will continue
their wild behavior all week and into
next in an attempt to prove them
selves worthy of wearing the distinc
tive garb of the Tree. Audition activ
ities will take place everyday at noon
in White Plaza.
"It's kinda like a homecoming for
me," said junior Emma Larkins
when asked why she is trying out to
be the Tree. "I grew up in the forests
of Maine, and I feel like being Tree
would bring me closer to the feeling
I had walking amongst the trees
when I was a child."
Some of the stunts students have
pulled during past auditions have
become the stuff of legend.
Rothacker remembers clinching the
coveted position with a few memo
rable performances of his own.
"I threw a beach party in [Prof.
David] Johnson's Econ 50 class —
thank you for the C, Prof. Johnson,"
Rothacker said. "I skydove, opened
my parachute and attempted to land
on Hoover Tower. I was shot out of
a cannon into the lake — it had
water in it. I was involved in a kidney
operation and I staged a giant action
sequence involving midgets, ninjas
and doctor thunder."
In the past, Tree hopefuls have

been shot and lit on fire. One candi
date even went so far as to hurl him
self in front of the University Presi
dent's car dressed as a deer.
"The fact of the matter is that
Trees love Stanford more than they
respect their bodies," said senior
Dan Bentley, a Band press represen
tative. "The sign of a true Tree is the
ability to commit sin against self...
and physics.".
While the process of becoming
the Tree is rigorous, the payoff is
well worth it, Rothacker said.
"Being a celebrity should be
enough motivation for most, but
having an excuse — and buffer in
case trouble finds us —to do the
crazy shit that we do on a regular
basis is priceless," he said.
The final decision of who be
comes the next Tree will be left up to
the marching Band and former
Trees, although Larkins said she be
lieves otherwise.
"Well, you see, ultimately it's all
decided by the Man," Larkins said.
"Everything's decided by the Man.
Or the Woman. The Man and the
Woman together. They get together
and make beautiful music, and that's
where the Tree comes from."
The result of the auditions will be
announced late next week. The Tree
will be "crowned" on the first full
moon of spring quarter at 3:50 a.m.
on the Quad. A special guest will
perform the coronation. According
to Bentley, past guests of honor have
included Joel Stein, Condoleezza
Rice and Martha Stewart.
Rothacker emphasized that the
evergreen contenders should hold
on to their dreams and not allow
themselves to be dissuaded by criti
cism — or pain, for that matter.
"Be Tree — don't listen to any
one else, because if they knew what
the fuck it was about, they'd be try
ing out — how could they not if
they actually thought they stood a
chance?" he said. "One of you is al
ready the Tree. Remember the
Tree adage, The rawest dog is a
dry, bare log.' "
