One of the two opponents the top
ranked Stanford men's basketball team (23-
0, 14-0 Pacific-10 Conference) will face this
weekend is coming in red-hot — and it's
not the team you'd expect.
While Oregon (12-9. 7-7), which is trying
to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament,
dropped both its games last weekend, losing
to No. 17 Arizona and then Arizona State,
Oregon State (11-13, 5-9) — which is fight
ing just to get into the Pacific-10 Confer
ence tournament — defeated Arizona
State on Thursday, 68-61. before knocking
off the Wildcats, 90-84, on Saturday.
In that big upset, David Lucas shot 10-
of-14 to lead the Beavers with 22 points and
nine rebounds, while guard Chris Stephens
shot 4-of-8 from downtown and had 22
points of his own. The Wildcats (17-7, 9-6)
got 18 points and 13 rebounds from Chan
ning Frye and had four other double-digit
scorers.
Arizona didn't shoot poorly, hitting 53
percent of their shots and 11-of-23 long
range attempts. The Beavers checked in at
55 percent, including 7-of-16 threes. The
only big disparity on the stat sheet was in
the turnover column — 20 for the Wildcats
and just seven for Oregon State.
That same defensive intensity had
served the Beavers well on Thursday,
when they held Arizona State (10-14,4-11)
to just 13 first-half points on 4-of-21 shoot
ing. Freshman guard Kevin Kruger led the
Sun Devils with 20 points, while Ike Diogu
struggled to get his 18 points and seven
boards, committing six turnovers in the
process. Lucas led the Beavers with 20
points and 12 boards, while Stephens had
15. Oregon State hit 13-of-14 free throws
down the stretch to seal the win.
Meanwhile, Oregon was outgunned in
Eugene, losing to Arizona, 100-87. The Pac
10's most explosive player, Salim
Stoudamire, was unstoppable for the Wild
cats. He notched a career-high 37 points on

some spectacular shooting: 9-of-14 from the
floor, 6-of-8 from 3-point territory and 13-
of-15 from the charity stripe.
Somehow, though, Oregon's Luke Jack
son was not to be outdone, even in a double
digit loss. The senior threw in 42 points of
his own and added 10 rebounds for good
measure. Jackson's stat line was as impres
sive as Stoudamire's: 14-of-21 from the
floor, 6-of-9 from deep, and 8-for-8 at the
foul line.
Oregon's backcourt was nowhere to be
found, however, as Aaron Brooks, James
Davis, Jordan Kent and Brandon Lincoln
shot a combined 2-of-21 from the floor to
sink the Ducks' chances.
The guards would fare a little better on
Saturday, but Jackson's 16 points and 10 as
sists were not enough to overcome the Sun
Devils. Arizona State picked up where Ari
zona left off handed Oregon a rare second
consecutive home loss, 86-75, behind 23
points and 12 boards from Diogu.
Elsewhere in the Pac-10, red-hot Wash
ington (13-10,8-6) staved off rival Washing
ton State (11-13, 5-9) in Seattle on Thurs
day, 71-67, for its eighth conference win in
its last nine tries. The Huskies then dropped
an unusual nonconference road game to
No. 13 North Carolina State on Sunday, 77-
72 — a battle that shows how tough Loren
zo Romar's squad is playing right now. A
balanced attack led Washington over the
Cougars despite 24 points from Thomas Ke
lati, who hit 6-of-8 from beyond the arc.
Against the Wolfpack, the Huskies held
a 34-34 halftime lead, and had a chance to
win it, but Brandon Roy's jumper in the
final minute was off the mark, and North
Carolina State hit four free throws to seal
it. Bobby Jones led the Huskies with 22
points and nine rebounds.
UCLA (11-12, 7-8) got a much-needed
conference win on Thursday, defeating a
slumbering California, 66-49, before losing
to Stanford, 73-60, on Saturday. Cal (11-12,
7-7) scored just 14 first-half points, and T.J.
