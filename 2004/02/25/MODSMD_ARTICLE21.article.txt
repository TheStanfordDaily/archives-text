# Gymnastics dominates
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
If there's a record for the number of record
breaking performances on one day of competition,
the No. 9 women's gymnastics team (6-3, 3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) may well have broken it at last Fri
day's meet.
In its last home competition, the team's five se
niors led the Cardinal to four team records, three na
tional-season records, over 10 personal-best scores
and a decisive victory over No. 32 California.
Senior Lise Leveille scored a perfect 10.0 for the
first time on balance beam and floor exercise, while
senior co-captains Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer scored 10.0s for the first time on floor exer
cise as well. The three seniors scored as many 10.0s
on Friday as the entire team has scored over the past
four years.
"It was surreal," Leveille said. "It almost seemed
like things were happening in slow motion and our
past three years had been on fast-forward. We had
been anticipating that night all year and when it ac
tually happened, we were on a cloud."
The team shattered the school record for overall
team score with a 198.875, more than a full point
higher than the previous record, which was set in
2001. The team score on Friday was also the highest
team score in the nation this season — although top
ranked UCLA tied the score in its meet the next day.
"You felt like nothing could go wrong," said se
nior Shelly Goldberg, who recorded a season-high
on vault with a 9.9 and a career-high on floor exer
cise with a 9.95.

The Cardinal also posted its highest-ever team
scores on vault, balance beam and floor exercise.
The team's floor exercise score, a near-perfect
49.925 out of a possible 50.0, and balance beam
score, 49.75, are the highest marks yet in the nation
on those events this season.
Wing and sophomore Natalie Foley tied the team
record for highest score in the all-around, each
recording a 39.825 out of a possible 40 points. Stan
ford assistant coach Larissa Fontaine had set the all
around record in 2000.
"I was speechless. It was just one of those magic
nights," said head coach Kristen Smyth. "I've never
enjoyed a meet more than this one. It is just an in
credible group of seniors who deserve for great
things to happen to them."
Senior Kendall Beck competed for the first time
at home this season on balance beam, scoring a 9.9,
after recuperating from a shoulder reconstruction
this past summer and about five knee surgeries over
the course of her career.
"Surgery after surgery, her body said no, but her
heart and mind said. Why not?' "Smyth said.
The team's five seniors—Wing, Fluhrer, Lev
eille, Goldberg and Beck — have played an integral
role in improving Stanford's program during their
time at The Farm. The team has made NCAA Na
tionals only six times in school history, but has qual
ified every year that members of the Class of 2004
has been competing.
"It was this class that helped take Stanford gym
nastics to a higher level," Smyth said at the senior

ceremony at the close of Friday's
meet.
The senior class is particularly
talented in part because it was re
cruited in the Olympic year of
2000. Olympic years typically pro
duce the most talented pool of col
legiate gymnasts since training
leading up to an Olympic year is
so intense. The incoming fresh
man class for next year is particu
larly talented as well.
But the Class of 2004 brought
more than gymnastics talent to the
Stanford program. Not only do
they have, ten All-American hon
ors between them, but they also
have ten All-Academic awards as
well. Beyond that, the seniors al
ways try to outdo their teammates
in team games like dodgeball and
charades.
"Whenever we do something
together, we decide to do it the
best," Fluhrer said.
For example, every year the

team dresses up for Halloween.
Some dress as animals or candies,
but the senior class plots their
outfits months in advance. This
past year, they were natural disas
ters — a hurricane, tornado, vol
cano, fire and asteroid.
"None of us really understood
what they were, but it was just
amazing," said junior Mandy Del
gado. "They're so creative and
have so much heart."
Coming to the end of their time
at Stanford, the senior gymnasts
are now plotting to take the
team's alumni scene to a new level
too.
For now, however, their sights
are set on finishing the season just
as they competed on Friday night.
The team has away meets against
Oregon State and Maryland over
the next two weeks and will then
face Pac-lOs, NCAA Regionals
and NCAA Nationals.
"Our goal is to bring that en
ergy, drive, commitment, and ev
erything else that happened on
Friday night to every meet for
the rest of the season," Beck
said.
