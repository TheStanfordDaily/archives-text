# Gymnastics dominates

### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
If there's a record for the number of record
breaking performances on one day of competition,
the No. 9 women's gymnastics team (6-3, 3-2 Pacific
-10 Conference) may well have broken it at last Fri
day's meet.
In its last home competition, the team's five se
niors led the Cardinal to four team records, three na
tional-season records, over 10 personal-best scores
and a decisive victory over No. 32 California.
Senior Lise Leveille scored a perfect 10.0 for the
first time on balance beam and floor exercise, while
senior co-captains Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer scored 10.0s for the first time on floor exer
cise as well. The three seniors scored as many 10.0s
on Friday as the entire team has scored over the past
four years.
"It was surreal," Leveille said. "It almost seemed
like things were happening in slow motion and our
past three years had been on fast-forward. We had
been anticipating that night all year and when it ac
tually happened, we were on a cloud."
The team shattered the school record for overall
team score with a 198.875, more than a full point
higher than the previous record, which was set in
2001. The team score on Friday was also the highest
team score in the nation this season — although top
ranked UCLA tied the score in its meet the next day.
"You felt like nothing could go wrong," said se
nior Shelly Goldberg, who recorded a season-high
on vault with a 9.9 and a career-high on floor exer
cise with a 9.95.

The Cardinal also posted its highest-ever team
scores on vault, balance beam and floor exercise.
The team's floor exercise score, a near-perfect
49.925 out of a possible 50.0, and balance beam
score, 49.75, are the highest marks yet in the nation
on those events this season.
Wing and sophomore Natalie Foley tied the team
record for highest score in the all-around, each
recording a 39.825 out of a possible 40 points. Stan
ford assistant coach Larissa Fontaine had set the all
around record in 2000.
"I was speechless. It was just one of those magic
nights," said head coach Kristen Smyth. "I've never
enjoyed a meet more than this one. It is just an in
credible group of seniors who deserve for great
things to happen to them."
Senior Kendall Beck competed for the first time
at home this season on balance beam, scoring a 9.9,
after recuperating from a shoulder reconstruction
this past summer and about five knee surgeries over
the course of her career.
"Surgery after surgery, her body said no, but her
heart and mind said. Why not?' "Smyth said.
The team's five seniors—Wing, Fluhrer, Lev
eille, Goldberg and Beck — have played an integral
role in improving Stanford's program during their
time at The Farm. The team has made NCAA Na
tionals only six times in school history, but has qual
ified every year that members of the Class of 2004
has been competing.
"It was this class that helped take Stanford gym
nastics to a higher level," Smyth said at the senior
