Playing in the No. 3 slot, Sheng quickly defeated Gryzb. 6-2,6-2, while Wan continued his win
streak, bringing his dual match record to 9-0. Stanford team captain Morris completely overcame
Scott, taking the match at the No. 5 position, 6-0,6-0.
Freshman Chris Rasmussen picked up his first dual match win of the year, fending off Dantley
Young and collecting a 6-4,6-3 victory.
"We did pretty well, especially coming off a rough couple of days against Cal," Rasmussen said.
It was a little tough getting our stuff together but we all came out on top, so now we have to re
cover against Arizona, which is coming up in a few days."

Next up lor the Cardinal are two matches this weekend against ranked teams. On Friday,
Stanford will face No. 42 Arizona at Taube Family Tennis Center, followed by a Saturday match against No. 23 Ari
zona State.
Arizona currently holds a 6-3 dual match record, which will change when it plays Cal on Thursday. The Cardinal
holds a 50-1 all-time record against the Wildcats.
One player to watch out for is the only individually-ranked member of the team. No. 66 sophomore Roger Mata
longa, who holds an 8-1 dual match record. Matalonga and junior Colin O'Grady were boosted to No. 27 in the dou

hies rankings yesterday and are currently undefeated this spring.
Arizona State will be going into Saturday's match full of confidence after pulling a surprise win over No. 9 UCLA
last week. The Sun Devils are 4-1 on the season and rely heavily upon their two ranked players. No. 79 Clinton Letch
er and No. 96 Chris Stewart.
"I don't know too much about Arizona this year," Gould said. "I do know Arizona State won against UCLA last
week, and it was a great win for them, because UCLA was ranked No. 2 at the time. And if they can beat UCLA, it's
going to be a tough match for us on Saturday."
