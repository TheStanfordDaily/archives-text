# Men's lacrosse sits atop
## WCLL after three games 
### NATHANIEL MYALL 
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team added to its early season suc
cess this past weekend with a win
over conference rival Santa Clara.
The 13-7 victory puts the Cardinal
(2-1) at the top of the standings in
the North Conference of the
Western Collegiate Lacrosse
League.
"We're a very young team in a
league where competition has be
come stronger every year," said
senior defensemen Ben Spohn,
one of the team's four captains.
"We've notched a couple good
league wins so far, with different
players stepping up and making
big plays every week."
The Cardinal enters this season
without last year's leading scorer,
Peter Munzig, who graduated in
the spring. Munzig led all scorers
last season with 24 goals and 32
total points. Fellow graduates Joe
Kennedy, Matt Kennedy and Ben
Swanson, all of whom had been on
the team for four years, are also
missing from this year's squad.

Fortunately for the Cardinal,
though, there are 16 players who
have returned from last year's
team including standout junior
Brooks Kinkaid.
Kinkaid, who finished second
with 30 points last season, has al
ready scored 10 points with 8 goals
and 2 assists in just three games
this season.
The team's biggest concern this
year, however, was who would
take over the starting job at goalie,
a position that was split last year
by graduates Joe Kennedy and
Gavin Sun.
First year sophomore Michael
Zell has stepped up to the chal
lenge, posting a .783 save percent
age through his first three games.
"Mike Zell came into the sea
son without much in-game experi
ence," Spohn said of the new
goalie. "But he's shown an ability
to make big plays and be a field
leader in a very short time."
Zell's supporting cast on de
fense includes senior captains
Spohn and Matt Towemy, senior
K.C. Lukens and sophomore

Brian Goodman.
Leading the midfield are senior
captain David Simpson, sopho
more Tyler Guttierez and fresh
man Ben Stillman. Stillman, while
only a freshman, has made his
presence known, scoring four goals
through three games.
"Yes, we lost several key play
ers that had played for four years,"
said head coach Bryan Smith, who
returns this year for his second sea
son. "However, this year's team
has done a great job of not missing
a beat without those guys around."
Smith led the Cardinal to a 7-7
record in his inaugural campaign
last season, taking them as far as
the quarterfinal round in the
WCLL playoffs where they lost to
Sonoma State.
This year, Smith and the Cardi
nal have their sights focused on
capturing the WCLL league title
and defeating school rival, Cal,
who they will face at Berkeley for
their final regular season game.
The Cardinal will face off
against Cal Poly at home this Sat
urday at 1 p.m.
