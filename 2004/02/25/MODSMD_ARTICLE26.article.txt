# Farmer's attitude on court makes him easy to dislike
## 
### ELIZABETH NEWMAN DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES — He's so easy to hate.
The smile, the upside down headband, the swagger.
But for USC's Desmon Farmer, it's all just part of his
game.
"I just love the game of basketball," he said. "I'm not
trying to be cocky, it's just how I enjoy myself on the
floor ... It's just how I express my love
for the game."
That love has taken Farmer from the playgrounds of
Flint, Mich., to the Los Angeles Sports Arena, where
the Trojans will face crosstown rivals UCLA Wednes
day evening.
Although Farmer has emerged as the Trojans'
strongest player this year as a senior, he is best known
for his on-court persona.
Farmer's lethal nature lies less in his ability to tally 30
points a game, as he has done multiple times this season,
and more on his on-court persona, which opposing fans
love to hate.
But his confidence — some may say cockiness — on
the basketball court emerged from his desire to make a
mark in the Pac-10 when he first arrived as a freshman
from the Midwest.
His decision to come to Los Angeles stemmed from
his desire to play fora school which utilized the same
type of up-and-down style he was used to, which is a
benchmark pattern of play in the Pac-10.
An injury allowed him to start immediately as a
shooting guard his freshman season. Benched after
the starter healed. Farmer wanted to create a trade
mark for himself.
After seeing UCLA's Jason Kapono sport a head
band on the court. Farmer decided that was the first step

and brought the look to USC.
"I wore one in high school as well," he said. "It's just
as a rival thing. That's just what I want to do. I just want
to be different."
It's fair to say he's succeeded: Any UCLA basketball
fan can pick him out of the cardinal and gold lineup, not
only as the guy wearing the upside down headband but
as the one player who plays better with every taunt and
plays harder with every boo.
When the Trojans visited Pauley Pavilion on Jan. 29,
the student section's relentless badgering only encour
aged Farmer, who played all 40 minutes and tallied a
game-high 28 points.
"I like the crowd taunting me," he said after the
game.
Unlike most college players, who break down or at
least get frustrated with a crowd's jeering. Farmer capi
talizes on it.
"It makes me play better and harder," Farmer said of
crowd's ire. "I already feel like I have confidence, it not
like I'm going to lose it. ... It makes me focus more."
With his final collegiate basketball season drawing to
a close. Farmer hopes his play will prove to others that
his basketball career shouldn't end now.
After graduating he hopes to enter the draft — and it
doesn t matter who, or where, just as long as he can con
tinue to play the game he loves.
"Farmer's had a big year," UCLA point guard
Cedric Bozeman said. "He's their best player."
There is no question that if he does go pro, the smile,
the swagger and the headband will go with him.
And the opposing fans will learn how easy it is to
dislike Desmon Farmer. He is also hoping that if they
take a closer look, they will see that his on-court per
sona isn't arrogance; it's simply pure love of the
game.
