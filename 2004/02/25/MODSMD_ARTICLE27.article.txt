# Great Donation reps speak to ASSU Senate
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY 
At the ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting last night, repre
sentatives from the group Students for the Great Donation present
ed a bill to place a referendum on spring-quarter election ballots
that would allow students to decide whether to add a $3 "involun
tary tax" to their ASSU fees. The Senate will vote on the bill next
week.
If such a referendum were passed, supporters say that the Great
Donation could generate up to $18,000, which would then be distrib
uted to global humanitarian aid organizations like Save the Children
and Doctors Without Borders.
Students would also have some input into which groups received
donations.
Senior lan Carmichael, an ASSU senator and one of the authors of
the bill, claimed that the Great Donation was within the legal, consti
tutional and functional role of the Senate. He cited an e-mail corre
spondence with Patrick Dunkley, the Senior University Counsel in
the Office of the General Counsel, in which Dunkley said that it was
legal for the ASSU to donate money to a non-profit organization,
provided that the non-profit meet some basic criteria.
"Students are distressed by what they see in the global communi
ty," Carmichael said. "It is our duty as an Undergraduate Senate to
listen to the student voice and respond with leadership."
ASSU Financial Manager Kyle Alisharan, Class of 2003, ex
pressed concerns about allowing a non-profit group to ask students
for money on an ASSU ballot at a time when the student government
is grappling with a special-fees crisis.
"We need to think about the precedent this sets for future," Al
isharan said. "What do we say to other groups that do this again and
ask for money?"
Some senators took issue with the philosophy behind the Great
Donation.
ASSU President Nadiya Figueroa, a senior, questioned whether
the idea contained an element of paternalism.
"It's like a token gesture. It's like, 'Let me give $3 I don't care
about and call it the Great Donation,' " she said.
Senior Patrick Bomhack, one of the organizers of Students for the
Great Donation, disagreed.
"To say it's paternalistic calls into question every aid organization
as well as U.S. governmental aid."
The debate will continue at next Tuesday's Undergraduate Senate
meeting, when the bill will come to a vote.
