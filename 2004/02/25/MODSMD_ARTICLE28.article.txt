# Students lobby for tax break
## 
### NIKI WILSON STAFF WRITER 
Lobbying for tax relief for the second time this acade
mic year, the Graduate Student Council (GSC) joined
forces with graduate students from 30 other universities in
Washington, D.C., on Feb. 12 and 13 to lend support for
H.R. 3412, the Higher Education Affordability and Equi
ty Act.
The bill, first presented to Congress last October, pro
poses an extension of tax-exempt status to graduate schol
arships that cover living expenses in addition to academic
expenses. Since an Internal Revenue Service tax code
change in 1986, stipends have been taxable beyond "tu
ition and required fees."
According to the GSC, the bill would benefit both
graduate and undergraduate students who receive such
stipends from their respective universities.
H.R. 3412 would also increase tax deductions on stu
dent-loan interest and increase the allowed contributions
to tax-exempt tuition savings accounts.
Through the National Association of Graduate-Pro
fessional Students (NAGPS), students nationwide are
continuing to work with the bill's sponsor Pennsylvania
Rep. Philip English and other legislators in favor of tax re
lief for graduate students.
Moriah Thomason, a student at the School of Medi
cine, served as the spokesperson for Stanford's graduate
student population during meetings with over 120 U.S.
representatives, senators and their staff.
Representatives from groups including the American
Medical Student Association, the Association of Ameri
can Universities and the Council of Graduate Schools
also endorsed H.R. 3412, providing the NAGPS students
with meeting facilities, experienced lobbying staff and let
ters of support, according to a GSC press release.
Thomason met with the aides of seven federal legisla
tors, requesting co-sponsorships for the bill, which she
stressed is uniquely bipartisan.
She also met with Sen. Daniel Akaka - 1 - a Democrat
from Hawaii â€” and his staff to review his proposed com
panion bill to H.R. 3412, which she described as a "more

grassroots initiative" that would promote training for
community-based education programs.
According to Thomason, local District 14 Rep. Anna
Eshoo has supported the bill for several months, but has
chosen not to co-sponsor it despite the high number of
graduate students in her constituency.
"While everyone we met with supported the bill,
whether they would co-sponsor the bill was the more in
teresting question," Thomason said.
The GSC members left Washington without the sup
port of Sen. Diane Feinstein, a Democrat. Since then,
Thomason has continued to discuss the merits of the bill
with the Senator's staff members.
NAGPS Legislative Concerns Chair Alik Widge, a
doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, said that
the potential hardship of financing graduate school cur
rently "drives people away from advanced degrees. We
need to expand the exemption to provide an incentive for
talented students to go to graduate school."
Statistics collected by the U.S. Department of Educa
tion show that the average doctoral student incurs costs of
about $26,(XX) and receives approximately $22,000 in aid.
GSC Chair Steve Allison, a graduate student in bio
logical sciences, said it is clear that "graduate students are
concerned about stipend levels and living expenses." He
praised H.R. 3412's capacity to reduce many sorts of tax
burdens, since "students earning a stipend and paying liv
ing expenses will have more cash on hand."
Allison added that Thomason's trip to Washington
D.C. was productive for the passage of the bill, and that he
applauds her for "taking steps to get the word out to Stan
ford and the public about our lobbying efforts."
As a follow-up to her experience. Thomason hopes to
organize a Web-based information center "to improve
the information we have on-line for how this legislation
will impact students."
This Web site, built with the help of GSC Webmaster
Alex Ene, would allow graduate students to learn about
and respond to new taxation laws
Thomason said, "I just think it is essential that the
Stanford University community be made aware of our
efforts."
