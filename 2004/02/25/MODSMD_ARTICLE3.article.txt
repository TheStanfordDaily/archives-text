# New Cancer Center opens doors, promises better care
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
After 10 years of planning, the
new Stanford Cancer Center will
open its doors to patients on March
1. The center will consolidate the
medical center's existing cancer clin
ics and resource services into a single
structure located next to Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital.
The Cancer Center is currently
applying for Comprehensive Cancer
Center designation from the Nation
al Cancer Institute, which recognizes
institutions that conduct programs in
three areas: basic research, clinical
care and prevention and control.
"Having this building shows a
commitment on the part of the
school to become a comprehensive
cancer center," Medicine Prof. Bra
nimir Sikic told the Stanford Report.
Sikic is the director of the Cancer
Clinical Trials Office, which has un
dergone significant changes and im
provements to meet the high stan
dards required by the Cancer Insti
tute's grant application. The grant
requires that the school maintain
databases to track trials and coordi
nate certain research resources.
"We are in an era of cancer re
search that is unparalleled," Sikic
added. "There is a confluence of
knowledge that is just waiting for
someone to put it to use."
In addition to allowing faculty,
nurses and staff to interact more suc
cessfully in conducting clinical trials,
the new center will also improve pa
tient care, said Philip Pizzo, dean of
the School of Medicine.
"It affords proximity for physi
cians and other professionals to
work more closely together," Pizzo
said. "The facility will foster a multi
disciplinary approach to diagnosis

and treatment and will permit the
teams of doctors, nurses and allied
staff who oversee clinical protocols
to work collaboratively and more
successfully."
The new center also hopes to es
tablish an innovative method of out
patient cancer care to make it more
accessible. Calling the old facilities
at Stanford Hospital antiquated,
Pizzo said the new building will have
state-of-the-art facilities for treating
individual patients.
"It will be a setting that is con
ducive to excellent patient care, that
fosters important clinical research
and that offers a caring and holistic

environment for patients undergo
ing the challenge of cancer treat
ment," Pizzo said. "The facility of
fers much more usable and attrac
tive space for radiation oncology
treatment as well as for the adminis
tration of cancer chemotherapy or
other treatments.
Medical students will have the op
portunity to gain hand-on experience
in cancer care at the new facility.
"Students who are on rotations in
medical, surgical or radiation oncol
ogy will work side-by-side with fac
ulty and staff in the Cancer Center,"

The Stanford Cancer Center, located next door to the Lucile Packard Chil
dren's Hospital, will offer new opportunities to students and patients.
Pizzo said. "This will afford the op
portunity to care for patients in a
very patient-sensitive and respon
sive environment and will offer the
opportunity to learn more about the
comprehensive care of the patient
with cancer."
The new center is 150.000 square
feet, with an additional 70,000
square-feet of shell space on the
third floor. The price tag for the fa
cility amounted to $85 million, not
including operation costs. Starting
March 1, the center will employ
more than 300 physicians, faculty
and staff.
