# Legislation aims to reduce bias in international studies classes
## 
### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In response to recently introduced legislation, stu
dents and faculty nationwide have begun to question
whether Middle East studies programs are biased against
the United States and Israel.
H.R. 3077, the International Studies in Higher Educa
tion Act of 2003, was introduced to the House Commit
tee on Education and the Workforce last year on Sept.
11. If approved, the bill would create an International
Advisory Board to "make recommendations that will
promote the excellence of international education pro
grams and result in the growth and development of such
programs at the postsecondary education level that will
reflect diverse perspectives and represent the full range
of views on world regions, foreign language and interna
tional affairs."
The board will consist of seven members, including
three appointees of the secretary of the U.S. Depart
ment of Education and two representatives from na
tional security agencies. The speaker of the House and
the president pro tempore of the Senate will each ap
point two members to the board with the recommenda
tion of the majority and minority leaders of their re
spective chambers.

The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3077
unanimously in October and referred it to the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
The Senate has yet to take action on the bill.
"This bill has negative potential for universities," said
Amy Newhall, executive director of the Middle East
Studies Association and faculty member at the Universi
ty of Arizona. "The powers of this advisory board are
quite broad."
According to H.R. 3077, all government entities are
"directed, to the extent permitted by law, to furnish such
information, suggestions, estimates and statistics directly
to the International Advisory Board, upon request made
by the chairman."
Newhall said she is worried that the establishment of
such a board could set a precedent allowing government
organizations to investigate other areas of academia.
She expressed her concern that the proposed board
might be an investigative body disguised as an advisory
committee.
Although public attention stirred by H.R. 3077 is fo
cused on Middle East studies, the bill applies to all colle
giate area studies programs, including African Studies
Asian Studies and Latin American Studies.
Proponents of the bill state that it
will ensure balance between differ
ent perspectives. On June 19,
Hoover Fellow Stanley Kurtz testi
fied before a House subcommittee
and endorsed efforts to eliminate
bias in this branch of education.
"In the long run, it would be best
for the country if we had a thriving
set of area studies programs that
were well balanced on policy views
and well funded," he said. "A major
reformation of the American acade
my's area studies programs is neces
sary to bring about such a result."
Prof. Nezar AlSayyad, chair of
the Center for Middle Eastern Stud
ies at UC-Berkeley, countered that

H.R. 3077 could potentially stifle dif
ferent points of view.
"This is an intolerant hill," he
said. "Balance is achieved through
academic research. We should main
tain the integrity of universities. This
is a McCarthyist bill."
Both Newhall and AlSayyad
questioned the motives of those in
support of the bill.
"It's not Middle East experts who
are advocating this," AlSayyad said.
"Many of them are not even based in
the United States."
Many proponents might have po
litical or foreign policy agendas that
would be furthered by the bill's ap
proval, he added.
"Legitimacy is derived from re
search," he said. "The advocates
of this bill would like to get people
more sympathetic to the Israeli
position."

Those in opposition to H.R. 3077
has made a concerted effort to main
tain a bipartisan stance.
"Both liberals and conserva
tives agree with the need for acad
emic freedom," AlSayyad added.
"It's fundamentally a libertarian
position."
Newhall said that some of the
bill's promoters might be making in
accurate generalizations about Mid
dle East studies programs.
"I think that there are a lot of false
accusations and misrepresenta
tions," she said. "People need to look
at the centers themselves. They pro
vide valuable services."
AlSayyad said he hopes the Sen
ate will kill the bill. He added that he
has full faith that the public will rec
ognize the harm done to free expres
sion and urge a quick repeal if H.R.
3077 is approved.

tion of the majority and minority leaders of their re
spective chambers.

The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3077
unanimously in October and referred it to the Senate
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
The Senate has yet to take action on the bill.
"This bill has negative potential for universities," said
Amy Newhall, executive director of the Middle East
Studies Association and faculty member at the Universi
ty of Arizona. "The powers of this advisory board are
quite broad."
According to H.R. 3077, all government entities are
"directed, to the extent permitted by law, to furnish such
information, suggestions, estimates and statistics directly
to the International Advisory Board, upon request made
by the chairman."
Newhall said she is worried that the establishment of
such a board could set a precedent allowing government
organizations to investigate other areas of academia.
She expressed her concern that the proposed board
might be an investigative body disguised as an advisory
committee.
Although public attention stirred by H.R. 3077 is fo
cused on Middle East studies, the bill applies to all colle
giate area studies programs, including African Studies
Asian Studies and Latin American Studies.
Proponents of the bill state that it
will ensure balance between differ
ent perspectives. On June 19,
Hoover Fellow Stanley Kurtz testi
fied before a House subcommittee
and endorsed efforts to eliminate
bias in this branch of education.
"In the long run, it would be best
for the country if we had a thriving
set of area studies programs that
were well balanced on policy views
and well funded," he said. "A major
reformation of the American acade
my's area studies programs is neces
sary to bring about such a result."
Prof. Nezar AlSayyad, chair of
the Center for Middle Eastern Stud
ies at UC-Berkeley, countered that

H.R. 3077 could potentially stifle dif
ferent points of view.
"This is an intolerant hill," he
said. "Balance is achieved through
academic research. We should main
tain the integrity of universities. This
is a McCarthyist bill."
Both Newhall and AlSayyad
questioned the motives of those in
support of the bill.
"It's not Middle East experts who
are advocating this," AlSayyad said.
"Many of them are not even based in
the United States."
Many proponents might have po
litical or foreign policy agendas that
would be furthered by the bill's ap
proval, he added.
"Legitimacy is derived from re
search," he said. "The advocates
of this bill would like to get people
more sympathetic to the Israeli
position."

Those in opposition to H.R. 3077
has made a concerted effort to main
tain a bipartisan stance.
"Both liberals and conserva
tives agree with the need for acad
emic freedom," AlSayyad added.
"It's fundamentally a libertarian
position."
Newhall said that some of the
bill's promoters might be making in
accurate generalizations about Mid
dle East studies programs.
"I think that there are a lot of false
accusations and misrepresenta
tions," she said. "People need to look
at the centers themselves. They pro
vide valuable services."
AlSayyad said he hopes the Sen
ate will kill the bill. He added that he
has full faith that the public will rec
ognize the harm done to free expres
sion and urge a quick repeal if H.R.
3077 is approved.
