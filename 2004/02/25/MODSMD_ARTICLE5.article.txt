# Summer dining plan criticized
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO 
The Stanford University Dining Committee met
last night to discuss issues relating to summer meal
plans for the 2004 summer session. Members of Din
ing Services talked with students on the ASSU advi
sory committee about how to resolve cost and flexi
bility problems in light of the recent online dining
survey and dissatisfaction among summer-session
students.
According to the survey of 405 students, 72 percent
of respondents said they would be more inclined to
live on campus during the summer if the meal plan
were optional. The current policy mandates that Stan
ford students attending summer-session classes and
participating in Summer Research College (SRC)
must purchase a dining plan.
In the past, Dining Services has relied on revenue
raised during the summer months to supplement the

cost of services during the academic year. Most of the
profit comes from conferences, which are run at the
University throughout the quarter. However, students
expressed concern that the unusually high cost of the
mandatory dining plan was being used to "subsidize"
the cost of dining for the rest of the school year.
In the words of one student committee member,
the current system is "unfairly and unnecessarily de
pendent on forcing students to purchase more food
than they want to."
Many of the dining survey's respondents said they
were displeased with the cost of dining and the uni
formity of the plans available. They also complained
about the high price, calling it "astronomical" and
"unreasonable," even in light of the generally high
cost of living in the Bay Area.
The committee members acknowledged the prob-
lem and stressed the obstacles in
volved in modifying services.
"This is not a perfect system,
[but] it's very difficult to change,"
said Nadeem Siddiqui. executive
director of Stanford Dining. He
said that offering more flexible
dining options would generate a
large financial shortfall because
the dining budget anticipates in
come from these summer students.
During summer quarter. Dining
Services is generally profit-orient
ed: Cafeterias are often closed and
dining from different areas is con
solidated to reduce the cost of
keeping many facilities open.
However, Dining Services admin
istrators also expressed a desire to
retain all of their employees dur
ing the summer months.
Last month's survey indicated
that more students would be will
ing to live on campus if dining
costs were reduced, suggesting
that the financial loss to dining
services might be offset by in
creased housing revenue. Howev
er, Siddiqui reported that housing
was filled to capacity and would be
unable to take on extra students
for any purpose.
"There simply are no extra
beds," he said. "If [modifying the
program] were that easy, it would
have been changed years ago."
Without the option of increased
housing, the committee consid
ered other ways to respond to stu
dents' needs. These included self
serve, bag-lunch and "Late Plate"
options to increase students access
to after-hours dining in addition to
a proposal to decrease the number
of days covered by the mandatory
plans.

Committee members also
called for more information about
the proportion of revenue that
comes from summer "confer
ences" as contrasted with revenue
from students, and how this com
pares to the operating costs of
Florence Moore Hall's dining fa
cility, where most of the students
eat. Siddiqui responded that stu
dents sitting on the advisory com
mittee were not privy to financial
information.
He added,"We are committed
to finding a resolution to this
issue."
