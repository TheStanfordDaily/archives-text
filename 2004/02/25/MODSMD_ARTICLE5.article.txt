# Summer dining plan criticized

### MELISSA FUSCO 
The Stanford University Dining Committee met
last night to discuss issues relating to summer meal
plans for the 2004 summer session. Members of Din
ing Services talked with students on the ASSU advi
sory committee about how to resolve cost and flexi
bility problems in light of the recent online dining
survey and dissatisfaction among summer-session
students.
According to the survey of 405 students, 72 percent
of respondents said they would be more inclined to
live on campus during the summer if the meal plan
were optional. The current policy mandates that Stan
ford students attending summer-session classes and
participating in Summer Research College (SRC)
must purchase a dining plan.
In the past, Dining Services has relied on revenue
raised during the summer months to supplement the

cost of services during the academic year. Most of the
profit comes from conferences, which are run at the
University throughout the quarter. However, students
expressed concern that the unusually high cost of the
mandatory dining plan was being used to "subsidize"
the cost of dining for the rest of the school year.
In the words of one student committee member,
the current system is "unfairly and unnecessarily de
pendent on forcing students to purchase more food
than they want to."
Many of the dining survey's respondents said they
were displeased with the cost of dining and the uni
formity of the plans available. They also complained
about the high price, calling it "astronomical" and
"unreasonable," even in light of the generally high
cost of living in the Bay Area.
The committee members acknowledged the prob-
