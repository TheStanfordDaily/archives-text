## Game boy, theater girl Gender divergence in role-playing activities 
### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
They both demand care
ful study, practice and talent.
They require their partici
pants to take on a role as a
particular character, act and
convince others of their role.
But somehow, they are in
herently different. The Stan
ford Gaming Society (SGS)
and campus theater produc
tions utilize role-playing in
an organized setting, but the
activities attract completely
different groups of students.
SGS hosts games every
other week in which 10 to 15
people take part in live-ac
tion, role-playing events.
Each member is assigned a
character and the game itself
takes place without a script.
"It's pitched as interactive
theater," said sophomore
Maria Tostado. "It's like im
prov theater without the au
dience."
One difference between
the two activities is clear:
SGS is dominated by males
whereas theater auditions
are packed with cutthroat fe
males vying fora limited
number of parts.
"There's a problem faced
in both theater groups and in
local gaming groups," Tosta
do said. "Any theatrical en
deavor is immediately bom
barded by female actors,
while male actors are few and
far between. However as one
the few active female mem
bers of SGS, I'm always puz
zled as to why more women
aren't attracted to role-play
ing events."
Where are the boys?
Females seem to be at
tracted to theater produc
tions, while males seem to be
drawn to gaming. Are fe
males intimidated by interac
tive theater? Do males think
that acting infringes on their
masculinity? While there are
no solid answers, participa
tion on campus shows that
gender plays a role.
In theater, there's a con
sistent lack of male actors at
Stanford and in the industry
at large.
"On this campus, it's a
very simple problem —
there are not a lot of guys
who are interested in doing
theater," said senior Ed Syl
vanus Iskandar, a theater
director.
Stanford Savoyards Di
rector David Euresti said he
doesn't understand why it's
harder to recruit men for
shows. Various excuses
range from not wanting to
sing like a girl to not wanting
to wear makeup.

"To that I say, 'Ask
one of the cute girls in
the cast to help you,'"
Euresti said. "That's
what I always did."
Iskandar questions
whether men on this
campus feel locked into
certain extracurricular
activities.
"We're a campus 40
minutes away from San
Francisco — complete
ly liberal and accepting
— so it's kind of ex
traordinary to me that
you wouldn't feel free to
experiment in this kind
of atmosphere," Iskan
dar said.
Despite this environ
ment, theater auditions
show an incredible gen
der imbalance.
"Constantly we're
finding that in shows
we're trying to cast, an
audition pool will con
sist of ten guys versus 50
girls," Iskandar said.
"It's problematic be
cause there's just not
enough [guys] to go
around."
The problem is also
mirrored in Stanford's
drama department.

"You'll find about three
to four female majors versus
one male major," Iskandar
said.
In productions the lack
of men leads to desperate
measures.
"When the [Stanford]
Savoyards don't find enough
men we usually have to
scrape the bottom of the bar
rel to find men," Euresti said.
"Sometimes we get really
lucky and find some wonder
ful people hidden in the
cracks. Sometimes we just
make do."
Cross-casting is one solu
tion. Often females play male
roles in productions.
"There's a lot of cross
casting on campus that is not
necessarily dramatically jus
tified," Iskandar said.
Theater is more forgiving
of cross-casting than film.
"Theater by its very na
ture is bigger than life, it's ex
perimental — it allows you
freedoms," Iskandar said.
Because the number of
males greatly outnumbers
the number of females, it is
much easier for males to be
cast in productions.
"Less able male actors are
getting cast and getting more
opportunities than equally
able female actors because of
the gender imbalance,"
Iskandar said.
However, he said the
lack of male actors is not a
new issue.
"It's not anything we've

seen happen; we've just
known it to be the case,"
Iskandar said.
As a director, Iskandar
has seen more women willing
to try out even without previ
ous theater work.
"I see a lot of girls more
willing to try out things that
they haven't had experience
doing," he said.
Iskandar said he decided
to do Stanford Shakespeare
Society's "Othello" as a con
cept piece. The show will run
this Wednesday through
Sunday as two separate one
hour edits of the text. The
first will be performed with
an all-male cast and a female
Othello, and the second will
be an all-female cast with a
male Othello.
"We thought Othello had
been done so many times as a
racial piece, we wanted to really
attack it the other way around,
so we turned it into a gender
concept," Iskandar said.
He sees Shakespeare's
work as gender-fluid.
"It was designed for males
playing females and there
fore the reverse should be
true also," he said.
Iskandar said he's learned to
deal with the lack of male actors.
"Sometimes it's been a
wonderfully stimulating, cre
ative challenge. Other times
it's been less so — it's been
kind of like 'Oh, my God,
how the hell am I going to
make this role work as a
woman?"' Iskandar said.

You got game
While theater produc
tions and gaming are two
completely different con
cepts, the people involved
tend to overlap. Junior Sarah
Terman said gaming is the
atrical in nature, just without
an audience.
"You don't find people
who act on stage, but you find
a lot of gamers who are
techies and stage managers,"
Terman said.
For some, SGS provides
an outlet to act.
"I love to do theater, but
I'm not good enough for the
stage and so gaming is a good
substitute for that," said ju
nior Nancy McKeown.
There seems to be a stigma
associated with being a gamer
in general, not necessarily
with being a female gamer.
"Oddly enough, there
isn't really a stigma attached
to being a female gamer; the
stigma is to being a gamer at
all," McKeown said. "We're
considered an odd bunch."
Whatever the reason,
there's a distinct lack of fe
males at SGS and throughout
the gaming community.
"Within the gaming cul
ture female gamers are a nov
elty: There's roughly a 5:1
ratio of men to women," said
McKeown. "I've heard ru
mors of there being societies
out there with more women
than men, but that's definite
ly the exception."

vanus Iskandar, a theater
director.
Stanford Savoyards Di
rector David Euresti said he
doesn't understand why it's
harder to recruit men for
shows. Various excuses
range from not wanting to
sing like a girl to not wanting
to wear makeup.

"To that I say, 'Ask
one of the cute girls in
the cast to help you,'"
Euresti said. "That's
what I always did."
Iskandar questions
whether men on this
campus feel locked into
certain extracurricular
activities.
"We're a campus 40
minutes away from San
Francisco — complete
ly liberal and accepting
— so it's kind of ex
traordinary to me that
you wouldn't feel free to
experiment in this kind
of atmosphere," Iskan
dar said.
Despite this environ
ment, theater auditions
show an incredible gen
der imbalance.
"Constantly we're
finding that in shows
we're trying to cast, an
audition pool will con
sist of ten guys versus 50
girls," Iskandar said.
"It's problematic be
cause there's just not
enough [guys] to go
around."
The problem is also
mirrored in Stanford's
drama department.

"You'll find about three
to four female majors versus
one male major," Iskandar
said.
In productions the lack
of men leads to desperate
measures.
"When the [Stanford]
Savoyards don't find enough
men we usually have to
scrape the bottom of the bar
rel to find men," Euresti said.
"Sometimes we get really
lucky and find some wonder
ful people hidden in the
cracks. Sometimes we just
make do."
Cross-casting is one solu
tion. Often females play male
roles in productions.
"There's a lot of cross
casting on campus that is not
necessarily dramatically jus
tified," Iskandar said.
Theater is more forgiving
of cross-casting than film.
"Theater by its very na
ture is bigger than life, it's ex
perimental — it allows you
freedoms," Iskandar said.
Because the number of
males greatly outnumbers
the number of females, it is
much easier for males to be
cast in productions.
"Less able male actors are
getting cast and getting more
opportunities than equally
able female actors because of
the gender imbalance,"
Iskandar said.
However, he said the
lack of male actors is not a
new issue.
"It's not anything we've

seen happen; we've just
known it to be the case,"
Iskandar said.
As a director, Iskandar
has seen more women willing
to try out even without previ
ous theater work.
"I see a lot of girls more
willing to try out things that
they haven't had experience
doing," he said.
Iskandar said he decided
to do Stanford Shakespeare
Society's "Othello" as a con
cept piece. The show will run
this Wednesday through
Sunday as two separate one
hour edits of the text. The
first will be performed with
an all-male cast and a female
Othello, and the second will
be an all-female cast with a
male Othello.
"We thought Othello had
been done so many times as a
racial piece, we wanted to really
attack it the other way around,
so we turned it into a gender
concept," Iskandar said.
He sees Shakespeare's
work as gender-fluid.
"It was designed for males
playing females and there
fore the reverse should be
true also," he said.
Iskandar said he's learned to
deal with the lack of male actors.
"Sometimes it's been a
wonderfully stimulating, cre
ative challenge. Other times
it's been less so — it's been
kind of like 'Oh, my God,
how the hell am I going to
make this role work as a
woman?"' Iskandar said.

You got game
While theater produc
tions and gaming are two
completely different con
cepts, the people involved
tend to overlap. Junior Sarah
Terman said gaming is the
atrical in nature, just without
an audience.
"You don't find people
who act on stage, but you find
a lot of gamers who are
techies and stage managers,"
Terman said.
For some, SGS provides
an outlet to act.
"I love to do theater, but
I'm not good enough for the
stage and so gaming is a good
substitute for that," said ju
nior Nancy McKeown.
There seems to be a stigma
associated with being a gamer
in general, not necessarily
with being a female gamer.
"Oddly enough, there
isn't really a stigma attached
to being a female gamer; the
stigma is to being a gamer at
all," McKeown said. "We're
considered an odd bunch."
Whatever the reason,
there's a distinct lack of fe
males at SGS and throughout
the gaming community.
"Within the gaming cul
ture female gamers are a nov
elty: There's roughly a 5:1
ratio of men to women," said
McKeown. "I've heard ru
mors of there being societies
out there with more women
than men, but that's definite
ly the exception."

They both demand care
ful study, practice and talent.
They require their partici
pants to take on a role as a
particular character, act and
convince others of their role.
But somehow, they are in
herently different. The Stan
ford Gaming Society (SGS)
and campus theater produc
tions utilize role-playing in
an organized setting, but the
activities attract completely
different groups of students.
SGS hosts games every
other week in which 10 to 15
people take part in live-ac
tion, role-playing events.
Each member is assigned a
character and the game itself
takes place without a script.
"It's pitched as interactive
theater," said sophomore
Maria Tostado. "It's like im
prov theater without the au
dience."
One difference between
the two activities is clear:
SGS is dominated by males
whereas theater auditions
are packed with cutthroat fe
males vying fora limited
number of parts.
"There's a problem faced
in both theater groups and in
local gaming groups," Tosta
do said. "Any theatrical en
deavor is immediately bom
barded by female actors,
while male actors are few and
far between. However as one
the few active female mem
bers of SGS, I'm always puz
zled as to why more women
aren't attracted to role-play
ing events."
Where are the boys?
Females seem to be at
tracted to theater produc
tions, while males seem to be
drawn to gaming. Are fe
males intimidated by interac
tive theater? Do males think
that acting infringes on their
masculinity? While there are
no solid answers, participa

gender plays a role.
