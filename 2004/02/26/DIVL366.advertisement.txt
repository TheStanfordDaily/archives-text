Why the Left arid Right Are Wr
Ik
According to radio personality and political
pundit Ronn Owens, what's tearing this
country apart is the ideological battle waged
between the far left and right. Preoccupied
with hating each other, polarized by issues, and
inflexible in their attitudes, liberals and
conservatives have poisoned our national
discourse to the point where independent
thought has practically become extinct. But
we can put an end to this schism by rejecting
the politics of the extremes and embracing the
values of the center. That's the simple yet
powerful message that drives VOICE OF
REASON: Why the Left and Right are Wrong
by top-rated San Francisco radio talk show
host and 2003 Marconi Award winner Ronn
Owens. A lively look at Presidential politics
and other topical issues from a centrist per
spective, VOICE OF REASON calls on cool
heads and a healthy dose of common sense to
resolve these turbulent times. By finding com
mon ground with each other instead of focus
ing on their political differences, Americans
left, right and center can bring forth a new
dimension in politics: moderation on a nation
al level. Ronn Owens is an award-winning
broadcaster and the host of the No. 1-rated
radio talk show in Northern California.
Broadcast daily on KGO-AM in San
Francisco, The Ronn Owens Program explores
a wide range of topical issues in a lively,
thought-provoking way. A straight-shooting,
plain-speaking "political pragmatist," Owens
competes directly against Rush Limbaugh and
is the only major-market radio personality who
consistently beats Limbaugh in the ratings.
Owens began his radio career in 1968, hosting
programs in four major markets before joining
KGO in 1975. Over the years, he has hosted
political debates, met with world leaders, and
interviewed national and international
celebrities and prominent newsmakers from a
variety of fields. Owens has appeared frequent
ly on CNN, MSNBC, and C-SPAN.
