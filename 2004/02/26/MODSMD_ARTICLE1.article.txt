# Cardinal men face two teams desperate for a win
## JUDGMENT DAY 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Tonight and Saturday, the top-ranked Stanford
men's basketball team (23-0, 14-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference) will face two opponents who desperately
need a win.
Tonight's opponent, Oregon State (11-13, 5-9),
coming off impressive wins over Arizona State and
No. 17 Arizona, suddenly finds itself in the thick of
the hunt fora berth in the Pac-lOTournament. Sat
urday's foe, Oregon (12-9,7-7), is coming off a pair
of disappointing losses to the Arizona schools.
While they have no fear of missing the Pac-10 tour
ney, a win over the nation's top team would do
quite a bit to revitalize the Ducks' flagging NCAA
Tournament hopes.
And, with starting power forward Justin Davis
not expected to play this weekend, Stanford finds it-
if ! _ • - - _

self going up against two
of the conference's best
big men shorthanded.
Oregon State's David
Lucas — the reigning
Pac-10 Player of the
Week — leads the
Beavers in scoring (17.7
points per game) and re
bounding (6.7 rebounds
per game). The 6-foot-7

junior is more than just a go-to guy, though — he's
an efficient offensive player, shooting an impressive
55.6 percent from the floor and 80.8 percent from
the line.
Lucas was lightly recruited out of high school and
played sparingly as a reserve last year, but has explod
ed onto the Pac-10 scene this year.
"To his credit, he has done a wonderful job at
changing his body and changing his game between last
year and this year and has really come on as a force in
this league," said Oregon head coach Ernie Kent.
Lucas's efficiency leaves plenty of shots for
sophomore guard Chris Stephens, a gunner who
averages 15.9 points per game and is the Beavers'
main 3-point threat.
"Stephens had 25 [points] last time [he played Stan
ford] and really shot the ball well," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery.
Montgomery's primary concern seems to be
Lucas, however.
"Lucas is one of the better big people in the
league," he said. "He's just very, very good inside.
And with Justin out, he's their four guy, so can we han
dle him with Nick [Robinson] and Matt [Haryasz], or
how are we going to guard him?"
If Lucas is dangerous, though, Oregon's Luke Jack
son is deadly.
Jackson averages a breathtaking 22.0 points, 7.0 re
bounds and 5.0 assists per game — all while shooting
50.9 percent from the floor, 47.0 percent from 3-point
range and 87.1 percent from the free-throw line.
He is, not surprisingly, a popular candidate for Pac
-10 Player of the Year.

"Luke's playing extremely well this season,"
said Stanford junior forward Josh Childress "He's
such an integral part of that offense, and he's hard
to stop. We're going to ... limit the amount of open
shots he gets and also limit how much he can create
for his teammates."
Jackson is coming off a weekend in which he threw
up 42 points on 12-of-18 shooting —in a game the
Ducks still lost by 13 to Arizona — and in which he
dished out 10 assists — but still saw Oregon fall to Ari
zona State.
The culprit? Poor guard play, as Oregon
guards Aaron Brooks, James Davis, Jordan
Kent and Brandon Lincoln shot a combined 2-
of-21 against Arizona before shooting a some
what-more-acceptable 14-of-37 against Arizona
State. Still, a weekend shooting percentage of
27.6 percent from your backcourt won't win you
many games, even if you do have Luke Jackson

as your small forward.
Montgomery has a good
memory, though.
"When we played [Ore
gon], their guards were real
good," he said.
In Eugene, Oregon on
Jan. 31. Davis made 5-of-9
three-pointers and scored
19 points, while he and the
rest of Oregon's guards

combined to commit just four turnovers.
Defensively, the Cardinal wants to focus on limit
ing what Lucas and Jackson can do for themselves and
their teammates. The offensive focus for Stanford is a
similarly large one.
"We've got to have a low-post presence," Mont
gomery said. "The ability of Rob [Little] to score in
side and be a threat is huge."
Big games from Little and forwards Joe Kir
chofer, Haryasz and Robinson would do a lot to
jump start the Cardinal. It is continued success
from long range, though, that makes Stanford's of
fense most effective.
"The ability of a player to make a play is what sep
arates people and teams," Montgomery said. "Every
one runs basically the same [plays]. I've watched these
teams that don't have any shooters and it's tough.
They're passing and passing and passing, they're run
ning a great offense, but they don't have anybody who
can [score]."
Both Oregon State and Oregon rely on their
premier post players to draw double teams and free
up open shooters beyond the arc — witness
Stephens, who jacks up over seven 3-pointers a
game, or Davis, who launched no less than 15
threes against the Sun Devils — so for the Cardi
nal, controlling the three-point threat begins with
keeping Lucas and Jackson in check.
The Beavers and the Cardinal will play tonight at 7
p.m. at Maples Pavilion, while Oregon and Stanford
will play the last contest in Maples prior to its renova
tion on Saturday at 4 p.m. Saturday's game will be tele
vised on ABC.
