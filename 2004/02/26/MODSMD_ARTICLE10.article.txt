Students will swap their sweats for
ball gowns and tuxedos this Friday, Feb.
27, when the 27th Annual Viennese Ball
takes place at the Hyatt Regency in
Burlingame.
The Viennese Ball tradition began in
1978, when students in the Stanford-in-
Vienna program organized the first
dance, which was attended by 350 people,
in Toyon Hall. Today, the ball is held off
campus and attended by 1,000 people.
Whether they are professionals or begin
ners, the Viennese Ball is open to stu
dents, faculty, parents, alumni and any
one who is just looking fora good time.
"The Viennese Ball is such a special
tradition because it offers a unique op
portunity for the Stanford community to
get together and celebrate," said Trang
Pham, one of this year's organizing co
chairs. "I can't think of another event
where so many undergraduates, graduate
students, alumni, and staff and faculty at
tend an event together."
The festivities will begin with the
Opening Ceremony at 8 p.m.
According to Howard Shen, another
organizing co-chair, the 36 dancers will
perform two pieces of choreography dur
ing the Opening Ceremony.
"It is a fairly big achievement for the
dancers involved because the choreogra
phy is complicated," Shen said. "And the
Opening Ceremony is watched by the
honored guests and many members of the
Stanford community."
The group practiced four hours a
week, starting at the beginning of fall
quarter.
During the event, couples can move
between the swing ballroom and the waltz
ballroom, each of which has a live band.
"One room focuses on waltzes, polkas
and other traveling dances; the other
room plays swing, salsa, cha-cha and
other largely 'stationary' dances," Shen
said.
All students, even those without prior
experience, are encouraged to attend the
Viennese Ball. Throughout Austria
Week, the week and a half preceding the

event, dance classes at five different levels
— beginning waltz, intermediate waltz,
beginning swing, intermediate swing and
polka were offered.
"The common misconception is that
you have to have taken social dance to go
to the Viennese Ball," said Jessica Luo,
one of the event's organizers. "It is pre
cisely for those people who haven't taken
social dance that we have the week of
lessons!"
In addition, there are a wide variety of ac
tivities slated during the Viennese Ball.
"We do offer dance lessons before the
ball, but with performances, dance con
tests and great food, a couple can spend
most of the night without having to step
on the dance floor if they don't want to,"
Shen said.
The Viennese Ball Committee faces a
new challenge this year, however, amid
rumors that this may be Stanford's last Vi
ennese Ball. The committee publicly stat
ed that the Constitutional Council ruled
last year that they could no longer raise
money both through ticket sales and the
ASSU's special-fees program. Although
organizing costs are rising, the Committee
is reluctant to charge higher ticket prices.
As a result, this is the last year that the
Viennese Ball will be organized with sup
port from the special-fees program.
"We are not yet out of resources, and
we fully plan on persevering next year in
trying to maintain this University tradi
tion," commitee members said "After this
year, though, the Ball may never be the
same."
However, they urge students to take
advantage of this year's celebration.
"Take advantage of the opportunity to
experience one of the most elegant tradi
tions Stanford has to offer. The 2004 Vi
ennese Ball could very well be the sast
Stanford Viennese Ball."
In addition to students and faculty,
this year's guests include the Consul Gen
eral of Austria, Vice Provost John Brav
man, Vice Provost Gene Awakuni. and
Prof. Emeritus Herant Katchadourian.
"It is truly rewarding to be intimately
involved with planning an event that so
many people on campus get so excited

about every year," Luo said. "I really love
doing something good for the Stanford
community and to put something back to
the Stanford community, since it has
given me so much in the two years I have
been here."
Shen agreed.
"The atmosphere of the Ball is also
unique; it has an elegance and formality
that is unmatched by any other Stanford
event,"he said.

Pham concluded, "The most reward
ing thing about planning the ball is hear
ing the stories about the wonderful times
people had at the ball. Very few under
graduates know of the times when people
used tcfsleep out in white plaza just to buy
Viennese Ball tickets because the number
of tickets sold was quite limited ... Hear
ing people share stories such as these,
adds to our motivation to make each ball
spectacular.

new challenge this year, however, amid
rumors that this may be Stanford's last Vi
ennese Ball. The committee publicly stat
ed that the Constitutional Council ruled
last year that they could no longer raise
money both through ticket sales and the
ASSU's special-fees program. Although
organizing costs are rising, the Committee
is reluctant to charge higher ticket prices.
As a result, this is the last year that the
Viennese Ball will be organized with sup
port from the special-fees program.
"We are not yet out of resources, and
we fully plan on persevering next year in
trying to maintain this University tradi
tion," commitee members said "After this
year, though, the Ball may never be the
same."
However, they urge students to take
advantage of this year's celebration.
"Take advantage of the opportunity to
experience one of the most elegant tradi
tions Stanford has to offer. The 2004 Vi
ennese Ball could very well be the sast
Stanford Viennese Ball."
In addition to students and faculty,
this year's guests include the Consul Gen
eral of Austria, Vice Provost John Brav
man, Vice Provost Gene Awakuni. and
Prof. Emeritus Herant Katchadourian.
"It is truly rewarding to be intimately
involved with planning an event that so
many people on campus get so excited

about every year," Luo said. "I really love
doing something good for the Stanford
community and to put something back to
the Stanford community, since it has
given me so much in the two years I have
been here."
Shen agreed.
"The atmosphere of the Ball is also
unique; it has an elegance and formality
that is unmatched by any other Stanford
event,"he said.

Pham concluded, "The most reward
ing thing about planning the ball is hear
ing the stories about the wonderful times
people had at the ball. Very few under
graduates know of the times when people
used tcfsleep out in white plaza just to buy
Viennese Ball tickets because the number
of tickets sold was quite limited ... Hear
ing people share stories such as these,
adds to our motivation to make each ball
spectacular.

Students will swap their sweats for
ball gowns and tuxedos this Friday, Feb.
27, when the 27th Annual Viennese Ball
takes place at the Hyatt Regency in
Burlingame.
The Viennese Ball tradition began in
1978, when students in the Stanford-in-
Vienna program organized the first
dance, which was attended by 350 people,
in Toyon Hall. Today, the ball is held off
campus and attended by 1,000 people.
Whether they are professionals or begin
ners, the Viennese Ball is open to stu
dents, faculty, parents, alumni and any
one who is just looking fora good time.
"The Viennese Ball is such a special
tradition because it offers a unique op
portunity for the Stanford community to
get together and celebrate," said Trang
Pham, one of this year's organizing co
chairs. "I can't think of another event
where so many undergraduates, graduate
students, alumni, and staff and faculty at
tend an event together."
The festivities will begin with the
Opening Ceremony at 8 p.m.
According to Howard Shen, another
organizing co-chair, the 36 dancers will
perform two pieces of choreography dur
ing the Opening Ceremony.
"It is a fairly big achievement for the
dancers involved because the choreogra
phy is complicated," Shen said. "And the
Opening Ceremony is watched by the
honored guests and many members of the
Stanford community."
The group practiced four hours a
week, starting at the beginning of fall
quarter.
During the event, couples can move
between the swing ballroom and the waltz
ballroom, each of which has a live band.
"One room focuses on waltzes, polkas
and other traveling dances; the other
room plays swing, salsa, cha-cha and
other largely 'stationary' dances," Shen
said.
All students, even those without prior
experience, are encouraged to attend the
Viennese Ball. Throughout Austria
Week, the week and a half preceding the

event, dance classes at five different levels
— beginning waltz, intermediate waltz,
beginning swing, intermediate swing and
polka were offered.
"The common misconception is that
you have to have taken social dance to go
to the Viennese Ball," said Jessica Luo,
one of the event's organizers. "It is pre
cisely for those people who haven't taken
social dance that we have the week of
lessons!"
In addition, there are a wide variety of ac
tivities slated during the Viennese Ball.
"We do offer dance lessons before the
ball, but with performances, dance con
tests and great food, a couple can spend
most of the night without having to step
on the dance floor if they don't want to,"
Shen said.
