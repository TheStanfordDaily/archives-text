## Senior Gift e-mail went too far 
### 
Senior Gift has been a Stanford tradi
tion since 1993. As a donation to the
Stanford Fund, Senior Gift helps to
support undergraduate programs such
as Undergraduate Research Opportunity
grants, Overseas Study Programs and finan
cial aid. Actual senior contribution have
been dwindling over the past few years how
ever; the Class of '03's 33 percent participa
tion rate was a record low. While the role of
Senior Gift committee is to encourage se
niors to donate, solicitation tactics used re
cently by this year's committee have raised
some concern.
Whether or not collecting monetary contri
butions for Senior Gift is appropriate at a time
when a large majority of the Senior Class is
unemployed is debatable in itself. That con
cern aside, however, some of the methods
being used to solicit contributions from se
niors have been cited as inappropriate by class
members. Most recently, an e-mail was sent to
the senior class mailing list containing a list of
names of those seniors who had made contri
butions thus far. This act has elicited criticism
from members of the Senior Class, and right
fully so.
We believe that the Senior Gift committee
should keep in mind that many members of
the class neither have the means of — nor

perhaps see the necessity of — giving to Se
nior Gift. Tactics designed to solicit contribu
tions by publicly praising those who have con
tributed and implicitly scolding those who
have not should not be acceptable. Although
a large number of the Senior Class may have
the resources to make large contributions to
Senior Gift, it should be taken into account
that a significant number of students are also
on financial aid at Stanford. Making a contri
bution under such conditions is much more
difficult.
The idea behind Senior Gift is a commend
able one because it offers seniors the chance
to fund future undergraduate endeavors. It is
also symbolically appropriate — seniors re
turn the gift of education that was given to
them. But tactics that may humiliate or create
unnecessary discomfort for members of the
Senior Class should be avoided. The Senior
Gift committee should be mindful of the fact
that it is not realistically possible for every
member of the class to contribute to the Se
nior Gift. Eliminating tactics that may be
viewed as offensive or humiliating should be
the first steps to improving the process of col
lecting contributions to Senior Gift. The com
mittee would do well to carefully consider the
personal situations of members of the Senior
Class.
