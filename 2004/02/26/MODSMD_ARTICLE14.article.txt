# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Prepping for parental scrutiny 
### 
At 2 a.m. on any given
Monday morning, I am
either asleep or wishing
I were asleep. But at 2
a.m. last Monday morning, 1 was
staring at one of my residents who
— after much knocking — roused
me out of bed and to the door. To
my surprise, she was not locked out
or in need of emergency care — she
was simply requesting to borrow
the vacuum. My guess is that she
was the first of many to be sucked
into the pre-Parents' Weekend
cleaning frenzy.
As college students, some of us
take the liberty of being away from
home to be a little messier than we
used to be. We leave trash bags un
tied and overflowing, beds unmade
and clothing unlaundered and
strewn about our rooms. Our desks
are in a constant state of disrepair
with books, pictures, CDs and
empty water bottles all forming
piles around our dusty computers.
Of course, for those of you living in
Stern, Wilbur, Lag or FloMo,
there's always the stack of plates
and utensils sitting by the doorway,
waiting to be taken back to the din
ing hall. And as long as you can
name someone who is even messier
than you are, living this way is never
a problem — until it is time for mom
and dad to come to campus to check
on their investment.
No parent wants to walk into a
dorm room smelling of sweaty socks
and week-old Easy Mac. And so we
always try to get our act together

just in the nick of time. Laundry is
folded and put away, sheets are
changed (finally!), desks are orga
nized and, of course, the carpet is
vacuumed once or twice to get rid of

shoe gunk and
mystery spots.
The clean-up ef
fort, however,
does not stop
there, lest we
want our parents
to know every
thing about our
secret college
lives. Alcohol
bottles are emp
tied into the sink

and thrown into the dumpster, play
boy pin ups are taken off the wall,
video game systems are packed
away and put into closets, and it's
just at matter of time before the
boys around the corner put their
beer pong table in storage for the
weekend. Yesterday, 1 even over
heard a girl reminding herself to re
move her boyfriend's toothbrush
from her shower caddy before her
parents arrived.
Pre-Parents' Weekend cleaning
has evolved far beyond the condom
and-marijuana-hiding of our par
ents' decade. We definitely have
more complicated tasks at hand, like
having to dispose of last year's Exot
ic Erotic costume that conveniently
doubled as an appropriate outfit for
the SAE Lingerie Party a few weeks
ago. (Imagine having to account for
something like that.) But it's not just

about hiding evidence of sex, drugs
and skimpy clothes — parents don't
like to see things like Cliffs Notes,
credit card bills or bad grades. So
while you're at it, you might as well
slide that stack of graded midterms
under the bed along with the rest of
your college paraphernalia.
It almost seems like Parents'
Weekend is more work than it is
worth, but these are our parents, so
that could never be the case. Be
sides, once everything is clean, dis
carded or carcfully hidden and the
parents finally arrive, the weekend
flies by in a blur of overeating at The
Cheesecake Factory and over
spending at The Stanford Store.
And just like our parents can't get
enough of "Stanford Mom and
Dad" gear (t-shirts, golf balls, din
ner plates, etc.), they also can't get
enough of the same "Congratula
tions on your child's achievement"
speech they have been hearing for
years. When it comes down to it.
Parents' Weekend is all about pleas
ing the very people who make Stan
ford possible — and so if they like
Stanford polo shirts, family pictures
in front of Mem Chu, recycled
speeches and pristine dorm rooms,
why not just give it to them? Besides
... they'll be gone by Monday.
