Lance Armstrong riding to
an unbelievable fifth

victory. Michael Jordan

win his sixth NBA championship.
Roger Bannister breaking the four
minute mile barrier.
Great athletic moments like
these have an unbelievable capacity
to awe, inspire and ignite within
even the most ordinary of us a desire
for greatness. Last Friday, I was for
tunate to witness an event that put
each of these athletic feats to shame.
I am, of course, referring to Fox's
newest television extravaganza,
"Man vs. Beast 2."
I imagine many of you watched
"Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Mil
lionaire" and thought, "Fox has just
reached its lowest." Then you saw
"My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance" and
hoped, "This must be as deep as they
will sink." Well, I would like to offer a
resounding "Shame on you." Ridicu
lous people making a mockery of
themselves is what makes this coun
try great, and nowhere does our eagle
soar higher than with "Man vs. Beast
2." Needless to say, I prepared for this
event with some relish. Imagine,
then, my surprise upon sitting down
to witness this pinnacle of modern
sportsmanship and realizing not only
that I would be privy to the finest
human vs. animal competition since
the USC football game, but also that
I would be able to cheer fora fellow
Stanford undergraduate. No, I'm
sorry to say that we didn't supply any
of the little people that raced against
the camel — prestigious as that
would be for our University. We did,
however, provide Marshall Erwin,
former All-American gymnast and
2002 NCAA rings champion.
What kind of competition, you
might wonder, could be appropriate
for an individual who is both a distin
guished athlete and an accomplished
scholar? What manner of event could
adequately encompass the unique
range of skills embodied by this prod
uct of the inimitable Stanford Uni
versity? The answer, my friend, is
simple: hanging from things.
Yes, in an advertisement for the
Farm that was better than anything
the Stanford public relations depart
ment could ever dream of, Erwin was
pitted against Bam-Bam the
Orangutan (I promise, I am not mak
ing this up) in the classic who-can
hang-from-a-bar-the-longest compe
tition. Clearly, I don't need to tell any
of you that this is an athletic display
that has captivated the imagination of
men deep into the annals of recorded

history. (OK, well, at the very least
Barn-Bam seemed excited.)
At this stage, you are probably
thinking "Well, at least a gymnast
and a monkey hanging from a bar
couldn't possibly be that embar
rassing for anyone involved." 1 am
all too glad to say that you are woe
fully mistaken
The competition began innocently
enough, with Erwin and Bam-Bam
grabbing on to their respective bars
and being lifted ten feet into the air.
Recognizing — as he later explained
to me — that"Bam Bam had spent all
day in the car and was restless," Erwin
immediately began an ingenious at
tempt to antagonize his orangutan
foe. (Kids at home, take notes. It's the
little things like these that separate
the all-time greats, like Erwin, from
the rest of us mortals.) Unfortunately,
Barn-Bam didn't respond to the
taunting, and Erwin's original predic
tion that "the orangutan would win
unless it got bored," seemed all too
prophetic. It was at this moment, how
ever, that the darker side of orangutan
nature began to rear its ugly head.
Making a decision that would
haunt him for each and every of his
thirteen seconds of short-term
orangutan memory, Bam-Bam
brought out a trick as old as competi
tion itself — indiscriminate urination.

Displaying utter disregard for both the
shorts he was wearing — of course the
monkey was dressed since Fox is a sen
sitive network that goes to great
lengths to avoid offending any viewers
— and thousands of established cul
tural norms, the orangutan (as Erwin
recounts) "pissed everywhere." Barn-
Bam was, of course, immediately dis
qualified, and Erwin carried the day.
Now, I understand that Stanford
currently has three varsity teams
ranked number one in the nation
and that you might have some diffi
culty getting as excited as I am about
a somewhat contrived bar-hanging
victory. However, I would suggest
that if you see Erwin around cam
pus, congratulate him on his success.
If you're feeling particularly mag
nanimous, you might even venture
where Barn-Bam dared not and re
frain from urinating on him. Either
way, I think Erwin should know that
we aren't taking him for granted.

Ben Daniel is a sophomore majoring
in mathematics who has never resort
ed to urination to win anything. If you
have, e-mail him at bmdaniel@stan
ford.edu so he can live vicariously
through your scatological exploits. If
you're still into that kind of thing,
though, don't contact Ben under any
circumstances.

sportsmanship and realizing not only
that I would be privy to the finest
human vs. animal competition since
the USC football game, but also that
I would be able to cheer fora fellow
Stanford undergraduate. No, I'm
sorry to say that we didn't supply any
of the little people that raced against
the camel — prestigious as that
would be for our University. We did,
however, provide Marshall Erwin,
former All-American gymnast and
2002 NCAA rings champion.
What kind of competition, you
might wonder, could be appropriate
for an individual who is both a distin
guished athlete and an accomplished
scholar? What manner of event could
adequately encompass the unique
range of skills embodied by this prod
uct of the inimitable Stanford Uni
versity? The answer, my friend, is
simple: hanging from things.
Yes, in an advertisement for the
Farm that was better than anything
the Stanford public relations depart
ment could ever dream of, Erwin was
pitted against Bam-Bam the
Orangutan (I promise, I am not mak
ing this up) in the classic who-can
hang-from-a-bar-the-longest compe
tition. Clearly, I don't need to tell any
of you that this is an athletic display
that has captivated the imagination of
men deep into the annals of recorded

history. (OK, well, at the very least
Barn-Bam seemed excited.)
At this stage, you are probably
thinking "Well, at least a gymnast
and a monkey hanging from a bar
couldn't possibly be that embar
rassing for anyone involved." 1 am
all too glad to say that you are woe
fully mistaken
The competition began innocently
enough, with Erwin and Bam-Bam
grabbing on to their respective bars
and being lifted ten feet into the air.
Recognizing — as he later explained
to me — that"Bam Bam had spent all
day in the car and was restless," Erwin
immediately began an ingenious at
tempt to antagonize his orangutan
foe. (Kids at home, take notes. It's the
little things like these that separate
the all-time greats, like Erwin, from
the rest of us mortals.) Unfortunately,
Barn-Bam didn't respond to the
taunting, and Erwin's original predic
tion that "the orangutan would win
unless it got bored," seemed all too
prophetic. It was at this moment, how
ever, that the darker side of orangutan
nature began to rear its ugly head.
Making a decision that would
haunt him for each and every of his
thirteen seconds of short-term
orangutan memory, Bam-Bam
brought out a trick as old as competi
tion itself — indiscriminate urination.

Displaying utter disregard for both the
shorts he was wearing — of course the
monkey was dressed since Fox is a sen
sitive network that goes to great
lengths to avoid offending any viewers
— and thousands of established cul
tural norms, the orangutan (as Erwin
recounts) "pissed everywhere." Barn-
Bam was, of course, immediately dis
qualified, and Erwin carried the day.
Now, I understand that Stanford
currently has three varsity teams
ranked number one in the nation
and that you might have some diffi
culty getting as excited as I am about
a somewhat contrived bar-hanging
victory. However, I would suggest
that if you see Erwin around cam
pus, congratulate him on his success.
If you're feeling particularly mag
nanimous, you might even venture
where Barn-Bam dared not and re
frain from urinating on him. Either
way, I think Erwin should know that
we aren't taking him for granted.

Ben Daniel is a sophomore majoring
in mathematics who has never resort
ed to urination to win anything. If you
have, e-mail him at bmdaniel@stan

through your scatological exploits. If
you're still into that kind of thing,
though, don't contact Ben under any
circumstances.

Lance Armstrong riding to
an unbelievable fifth
straight Tour de France
victory. Michael Jordan
launching a perfect buzzer-beater to
win his sixth NBA championship.
Roger Bannister breaking the four
minute mile barrier.
Great athletic moments like
these have an unbelievable capacity
to awe, inspire and ignite within
even the most ordinary of us a desire
for greatness. Last Friday, I was for
tunate to witness an event that put
each of these athletic feats to shame.
I am, of course, referring to Fox's
newest television extravaganza,
"Man vs. Beast 2."
I imagine many of you watched
"Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Mil
lionaire" and thought, "Fox has just
reached its lowest." Then you saw
"My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance" and
hoped, "This must be as deep as they
will sink." Well, I would like to offer a
resounding "Shame on you." Ridicu
lous people making a mockery of
themselves is what makes this coun
try great, and nowhere does our eagle
soar higher than with "Man vs. Beast
2." Needless to say, I prepared for this
event with some relish. Imagine,
then, my surprise upon sitting down
to witness this pinnacle of modern
sportsmanship and realizing not only
that I would be privy to the finest
human vs. animal competition since
