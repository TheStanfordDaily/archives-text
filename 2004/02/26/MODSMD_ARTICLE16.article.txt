## Friendship with an Iraqi student inspires reflection 
### REED ADAM 
The one-year anniversary of the start of the
war in Iraq is approaching. What was promised to
be a quick liberation of a people who have long
suffered under a dictatorship has turned into a
quagmire. By the beginning of February, more
than 500 U.S. soldiers lost their lives in the con
flict and many people estimate the Iraqi civilian
deaths to be at least 8,000.
Though the American press reports some
of the casualties on both sides, it is all too easy
to forget the lives of the Iraqi people, whose
voices rarely reach us. I am fortunate enough to
be in contact with an Iraqi student, whom I had
the pleasure of meeting and getting to know last
year in Istanbul, where we both were studying.
We met before the invasion began and had
many conversations, through which I began to
gain a greater understanding of a perspective
that was largely absent in media reports and po
litical discussions.
While the two of us sat drinking tea one
evening last spring, my friend shared with me
many of his thoughts and feelings about the cur
rent conflict. He worried greatly about the safety
of his family, but remained in contact with them
and assured me that they were safe. My friend

stressed that the majority of the people he knew
in his home city of Arbil, located in northern
Iraq, were against the invasion. He told me that
his people had always lived in fear of Saddam
Hussein. However, he said that since the Gulf
War, Hussein had become too weak and too wise
to wreak damage on the rebellious sections of the
Iraqi people, as he had done before and during
the 1991 conflict. For the past decade, Hussein
had left the northern, mostly Kurdish, region in
Iraq alone, and a relatively stable, functional sys
tem of government evolved there. My friend
agreed with the idea — commonly held by many
people around the world — that the reason be
hind the current war was that America wants to
control Iraq's oil. I asked him if he was angry
about this, and he said no; he understood the
Bush administration's motives. It was his view
that those on top often use their positions of
power to benefit themselves at the expense of
others, even though it is wrong for them to do
this. He explained to me that in Iraq, people did
not harbor a great deal of anger toward the
American people themselves and assured me that
if I were to travel there, the vast majority of
Iraqis would treat me with the traditional Muslim
hospitality.
During the summer, my friend returned to

Iraq for the first time since the war broke out
started to visit his family. When he came back to
Turkey, we met briefly, but long enough for him
to tell me succinctly and powerfully, "The
Americans had ruined everything." Recently, I
contacted my friend and asked him to share
some of his thoughts about the current situation
in Iraq. He replied in a hesitant tone; he did not
want to express all of his thoughts out of fear of
being discovered and being accused of some
thing that he wasn't. In his brief message, my
friend stated again that his people had opposed
the invasion before it happened. Although he is
not pleased with the occupation, he believes that
the United States must stay to prevent Iraq's
neighbors from possibly invading. (Iraq shares
borders with Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan and
Kuwait). He is also concerned that an "inner
war between the different parts of the Iraqi na
tion" may occur before a new government is es
tablished.
During the months preceding the invasion, I
had wished that all of the pundits and politicians
supporting military action would sit down and
speak with citizens of Iraq. When one is not ad
dressing the people of a country in person, it is
easy to fabricate truths about weapons of mass
destruction and wax on about the lofty ideals of

liberation and democratization. But the rhetoric
becomes much weaker when it comes face-to
face with the people it will impact the most. Now
that the United States is occupying Iraq, the
Coalition Provisional Authority must act in a way
that benefits the majority of the Iraqi people, not
a few select former Iraqi exiles whose new lead
ership positions are giving them an opportunity
to line their pockets or the multinational corpo
rations profiting from the war. We as U.S. citi
zens and residents must reflect on the human toll
of this war — the lives lost on both sides are not
just numbers. They include soldiers, students,
farmers, workers and their families — many of
whom have lives and dreams that are not so dif
ferent from ours, as I had the opportunity to dis
cover. The deaths of civilians and soldiers did not
have to occur. We must remember those who lost
their lives in this unnecessary conflict, oppose fu
ture wars and continue the struggle fora more
peaceful world.

Reed would like to thank his Iraqi friend for his
thoughts and his courage, but will keep his friend's
name anonymous out of respect for his safety and
that of his family.
