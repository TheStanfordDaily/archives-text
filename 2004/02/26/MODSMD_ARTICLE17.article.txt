## Emily wants to hang with the Diesel 
### EMILY KUEHLER 
He's the Diesel. He's the Daddy.
And when he's not fat, out of shape
and complaining about a sore big toe,
Shaquille O'Neal is the most domi
nant force in basketball.
But that's not what this column is
about. I hate the Los Angeles Lakers
more than I hate Dick Cheney —
which is really more than you want to
know — and could care less if Shaq
takes the court with them ever again.
It's his off-court endeavors that really
interest me.
Asan unathletics-foot-7girl with
the lung capacity of a 65-year-old
(thanks a lot, Philip Morris) who
hasn't picked up a basketball in
about five years except to get
schooled by a group of equally
unathletic guys in a pickup game,
I've pretty much given up all hopes
of ever donning an NBA uniform.
So, my sports dreams have shifted
in a different direction. And by differ
ent direction, I mean become friends
with Shaq.
To clarify, 1 just want to be friends
with him. I don't want to be a
Shaquille O'Neal groupie. I don't
want to have sex with the guy. In fact,
I'd rather have sex with that smelly
guy who lives in Columbae and
doesn't shower in an effort to con
serve water.
But I do want to be part of his
posse. And I think it's important that
we recogni/e the difference between
posse-member and groupie, with the
distinction being extremely clear —
groupies have to give it up. And let's
lace it, Shaq's wife probably doesn't
want to have sex with Shaq.
Now at this point you've gotta be
asking the question, "Why not Kobe?"
Surely Kobe's got as much to offer as
Shaq does, if not more.
Same sweet location down in L.A.
Comparable financial situations.
Kobe's clearly better looking. He's
younger. And in general he seems to
have a lot more going for him — un
less you count that whole "sexual as
sault charge" thing. But let's be hon
est, she must have been asking for it.
The perks that go along with being
in Shaq's posse are endless — and you
wouldn't have to deal with some ass
hole's smug attitude to reap the bene
fits. There's no way in hell a guy who
starred in "Kazaam" can be smug.
Shaq's gotta have a sense of
humor about himself. There's no
other way a 31-year-old man gets
away with an absolutely embarass
ing Superman obsession.
But back to the sweet perks.
You get to roll into all of L.A.'s
hottest clubs — without waiting in any
sort of line.
Imagine the seats at the Laker
games.
Imagine the connections — chill
ing with the entire cast of "Kazaam."
What could possibly be better?
And you know Shaq takes care of
his posse. Jewelry. Cars. Liquor. It
sounds like only A.l.'s posse can come
close to rivaling Shaq's.
The real question is this: Who
doesn't want to be friends with some
one who repeatedly makes outrageous
claims that he's slept with Venus
Williams, Aaliyah and Cindy Craw
ford? I know I do.
And who doesn't want to be friends
with someone who goes on profanity
laced tirades on live TV when he feels
like he's not getting every call he de
serves? I know I do.
So at this point it probably sounds
like I just want to use and abuse Shaq
and not really be friends with him
after all.
That couldn't be further from the
truth. I honestly think we have a lot
in common.
Shaq's lazy. I'm lazy.
Shaq likes watching basketball. I
like watching basketball.
Shaq doesn't like to run. I don't like
to run.
Clearly Shaq and I have all the
bases covered fora deep and meaning
ful friendship. If Shaq needs me, I'm
there.
