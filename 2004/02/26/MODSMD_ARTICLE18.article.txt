# Wrestling looks to pin down Pac

### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Since wrapping up its dual meet season with a 42-3 win over
Portland State on Valentine's Day, the Stanford wrestling
team has endured — and survived — its most challenging
practices of the year in preparation for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, which begin Sunday in Tempe, Ariz.
"They have all worked harder than any team I've ever
been a part of and I say without hesitation that they are
ready," said Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "We've
pushed through all kinds of barriers these past 10 days, both
mental and physical, and the intensity was exactly where it
needed to be. We talked today about competing with the per
fect blend of intensity and relaxation and I think the team has
that right now."
That relaxation was displayed in a game of handball that
broke out among teammates and coaches in the wrestling
room before practice yesterday. The intensity has shone
through on the mats all season, as Stanford (10-4,6-2 Pac-10)
has put together one of the best seasons in its history on the
heels of one of its worst (3-12, 1-6 in 2002-03).
The Cardinal's calm-but-focused attitude heading into the
conference championships, the tournament every team builds
up to and anticipates all season, emanates from the likes of se
nior tri-captain Brad Metzler, who is 25-3 in his final season of
a distinguished career on the Farm.
"I'm real excited and I'm trying to stay loose because I've
had problems in the past putting too much pressure on my
self," Metzler said. "The attitude in the room is good. We're
looking good and we know it."
Metzler, who placed fourth at Pac-lOs in 2002, will likely be
the top seed at 141 pounds when the seeds are finalized at a
coaches meeting on Saturday and is one of several Cardinal
grapplers with postseason experience.
Fellow Cardinal veteran Matt Gentry, ranked second in
the nation at 157 pounds as a junior, carries a school-record
34-match winning streak to Tempe, where he is attempting to
qualify for the NCAA Championships fora third straight
year. The top four finishers in each weight class plus three
wildcards qualify for NCA As, which will be held Mar. 18-20 in
Saint Louis, Mo.
Stanford seniors Paul Gross and John Garfinkel look to
extend their collegiate wrestling careers or, at the very
least, close them out on a high note with strong perfor
mances this weekend.
Gross tallied a 6-5 record in dual meet competition, in
cluding the exciting decisive win in the final bout of Stanford's
18-17 victory over Oregon State as part of the Cardinal's
seven-meet winning streak to end the season. Garfinkel, who
placed sixth at Pac-10s last season, has 23 wins and is tied for
the team-lead with six pins.
While the juniors and seniors provided leadership
throughout the season, Stanford's talented crop of under
classmen played an integral part in the team's turnaround
as well.
Freshman Tanner Gardner has 21 wins in his first season
for the Cardinal and will represent the Cardinal at 125
pounds. Sophomore Luis Vendrell, who has 19 wins and has
impressed since establishing himself as the starter at 149
pounds early in the season, looks to capitalize on his first trip
to Pac-10s, as does redshirt freshman Brian Perry, whose nine

dual meet wins at 165 pounds were the fourth-highest total on
the team.
Sophomore Imad Kharbush is second on the team with 29
wins at 174 pounds, including a 12-2 mark in dual meets. Fel
low sophomore Larry Ozowara, who competed at Pac-10s last
season at 197 pounds, has looked strong since entering the
starting lineup at 184, posting five dual meet wins in seven
bouts. Sophomore Shawn Ritzenthaler will wrestle at the
heavyweight position for the Cardinal.
While host Arizona State is the favorite to win the team
title, Stanford is one of several teams that could challenge the
Sun Devils for the conference crown. With six wins against
conference foes, the Cardinal is confident about its chances in
the team standings and figures to be closer to its all-time best
finish of third than its ninth-place finish of a year ago when all
is said and done.

"If you tell any member of our team they will not be Pac
-10 champions after the weekend, you'd better be able to turn
and run pretty quickly," Buddie said. "They believe it and
they've worked hard for it."
Still, the ultimate focus remains on each wrestler prepar
ing for each individual match, an attitude that should ensure
Stanford qualifies more than just one wrestler for NCAAs
this weekend.
"If we compete the way we can, we could take our entire
team to the NCAA tournament," Buddie said. "That is the
goal of any strong program, and that has always been the goal
of this team."
This relaxed and focused bunch has given reason to believe
that by Monday night, that goal might be closer to realized
than far-fetched.

Portland State on Valentine's Day, the Stanford wrestling
team has endured — and survived — its most challenging
practices of the year in preparation for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships, which begin Sunday in Tempe, Ariz.
"They have all worked harder than any team I've ever
been a part of and I say without hesitation that they are
ready," said Stanford head coach Steve Buddie. "We've
pushed through all kinds of barriers these past 10 days, both
mental and physical, and the intensity was exactly where it
needed to be. We talked today about competing with the per
fect blend of intensity and relaxation and I think the team has
that right now."
That relaxation was displayed in a game of handball that
broke out among teammates and coaches in the wrestling
room before practice yesterday. The intensity has shone
through on the mats all season, as Stanford (10-4,6-2 Pac-10)
has put together one of the best seasons in its history on the
heels of one of its worst (3-12, 1-6 in 2002-03).
The Cardinal's calm-but-focused attitude heading into the
conference championships, the tournament every team builds
up to and anticipates all season, emanates from the likes of se
nior tri-captain Brad Metzler, who is 25-3 in his final season of
a distinguished career on the Farm.
"I'm real excited and I'm trying to stay loose because I've
had problems in the past putting too much pressure on my
self," Metzler said. "The attitude in the room is good. We're
looking good and we know it."
Metzler, who placed fourth at Pac-lOs in 2002, will likely be
the top seed at 141 pounds when the seeds are finalized at a
coaches meeting on Saturday and is one of several Cardinal
grapplers with postseason experience.
Fellow Cardinal veteran Matt Gentry, ranked second in
the nation at 157 pounds as a junior, carries a school-record
34-match winning streak to Tempe, where he is attempting to
qualify for the NCAA Championships fora third straight
year. The top four finishers in each weight class plus three
wildcards qualify for NCA As, which will be held Mar. 18-20 in
Saint Louis, Mo.
Stanford seniors Paul Gross and John Garfinkel look to
extend their collegiate wrestling careers or, at the very
least, close them out on a high note with strong perfor
mances this weekend.
Gross tallied a 6-5 record in dual meet competition, in
cluding the exciting decisive win in the final bout of Stanford's
18-17 victory over Oregon State as part of the Cardinal's
seven-meet winning streak to end the season. Garfinkel, who
placed sixth at Pac-10s last season, has 23 wins and is tied for
the team-lead with six pins.
While the juniors and seniors provided leadership
throughout the season, Stanford's talented crop of under
classmen played an integral part in the team's turnaround
as well.
Freshman Tanner Gardner has 21 wins in his first season
for the Cardinal and will represent the Cardinal at 125
pounds. Sophomore Luis Vendrell, who has 19 wins and has
impressed since establishing himself as the starter at 149
pounds early in the season, looks to capitalize on his first trip
to Pac-10s, as does redshirt freshman Brian Perry, whose nine

dual meet wins at 165 pounds were the fourth-highest total on
the team.
Sophomore Imad Kharbush is second on the team with 29
wins at 174 pounds, including a 12-2 mark in dual meets. Fel
low sophomore Larry Ozowara, who competed at Pac-10s last
season at 197 pounds, has looked strong since entering the
starting lineup at 184, posting five dual meet wins in seven
bouts. Sophomore Shawn Ritzenthaler will wrestle at the
heavyweight position for the Cardinal.
While host Arizona State is the favorite to win the team
title, Stanford is one of several teams that could challenge the
Sun Devils for the conference crown. With six wins against
conference foes, the Cardinal is confident about its chances in
the team standings and figures to be closer to its all-time best
finish of third than its ninth-place finish of a year ago when all
is said and done.

"If you tell any member of our team they will not be Pac
-10 champions after the weekend, you'd better be able to turn
and run pretty quickly," Buddie said. "They believe it and
they've worked hard for it."
Still, the ultimate focus remains on each wrestler prepar
ing for each individual match, an attitude that should ensure
Stanford qualifies more than just one wrestler for NCAAs
this weekend.
"If we compete the way we can, we could take our entire
team to the NCAA tournament," Buddie said. "That is the
goal of any strong program, and that has always been the goal
of this team."
This relaxed and focused bunch has given reason to believe
that by Monday night, that goal might be closer to realized
than far-fetched.
