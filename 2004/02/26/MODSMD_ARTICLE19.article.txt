# Polo set for Gaucho
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If women's water polo were predictable,
Southern California could be declared the
winner of the Gaucho Water Polo Tourna
ment at UC-Santa Barbara this weekend.
Fortunately for the No. 3 Stanford water
polo squad (5-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) and for fans alike, wins and loss
es can go either way, especially as each indi
vidual team adjusts and improves throughout
the season.
"You can never predict exactly how a tour
nament like this will play out," senior Wendy
Watkins said. "We can not change or predict
how other teams will play or how refs will call
the games. All we can do is control what we do
in the pool."
With that state of mind, the Cardinal heads
down south ready to face any of the sixteen
other teams participating. The tournament
includes some of the best teams in the nation,
including No. 1 USC (8-0, 3-0), No. 2 UCLA
(4-1, 1-0) and six other teams ranked in the
top 10.
The tough competition prevents any team
from assuming it will win the tournament with
ease, but nonetheless Stanford is optimistic
about its chances.
"I have confidence that if everybody on
our team plays solid this weekend, we could
definitely have a good chance at winning the
tournament," Watkins said.
Stanford squares off against UC-San
Diego (6-8) Saturday morning before con
fronting the winner of the matchup be
tween No. 6 California (3-3, 1-1) and San
Jose State (5-5, 1-1).
While UC-San Diego does not boast a
great record, Stanford has chosen not to over
look them. The Tritons have defeated teams
ranked ahead of them and have won four of
their last five games. They also feature senior
Meris Bantilan-Smith, who is coming off a
scoring spree in the last four games.
Whether the team loses or wins its first
matchup, the Cardinal will have to face ei
ther Cal or San Jose State. The Golden
Bears come into the tournament after hav
ing a whole week off. The Spartans, on the
other hand, are coming off Sunday's win
against UC-lrvine (5-6,1-3). The Spartans'
recent success is partly due to the offensive
explosion of Laura Scott, who has racked

up 14 goals this season, and the defense of
goalkeeper Michelle Razzen, who has
saved 44 shots.
The Cardinal already defeated both teams
earlier this season at the Stanford Invitational.
Though they feel confident facing those teams
again, Stanford's players are still cautious about
predicting an outcome.
"We beat [them] but we can never get to
comfortable," Watkins said. "For the past two
weeks, those teams have most likely been
working on the areas of the game that they
were weak on during our tournament. We will
most likely see both teams improved, as well
as ourselves."
Sophomore driver Laurel Champion
agreed, adding that the squad will keep its
level of intensity high no matter which
team it faces.
"We have been seeing great improve
ments on our team defense since the Stanford
Tournament," Champion said. "Should we
face Cal or San Jose State this weekend, we
are going to have to continue to play great
team defense."
The Cardinal has already made the
power of its offense apparent even though
it is still early in the season. Stanford has
outscored its opponents, 53-28, coming out
strongly at the starts of each half. It also
boasts a .433 scoring percentage when
using its potent six-on-five offense. Backed
by freshman goalkeeper Meredith McColl,
the Cardinal has also done a good job in
preventing its opponents from taking many
shots.
"We will definitely try and showcase [good
offense and defense] this weekend," said
Watkins, who leads the team with 12 goals.
"We also want to be great on our five-on-six
defense and six-on-five offenses. If we can win
the power-play battle, we will have a really
good chance of winning the tough games we
will likely play."
While the actual outcome of the tourna
ment may be unpredictable, it will help the
teams define where they are in comparison to
the rest of the MPSF. Stanford hopes to get
some momentum-building victories as the
squad approaches some of its fiercest compe
tition in the upcoming weeks.
"This tourney will really set the stage for
the season, since most teams have their tough
est MPSF conference games in the next
month or so," Champion said.
