# The
						fiercest competitor

### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forgive Matt Lottich if he got a little excited during Stan
ford's win over UCLA last weekend. If he was running down
court with his face colored deep cardinal, shouting and pumping
his fist violently, all hut breathing fire and smoking from the ears
â€” it's only because he's a competitor.
Perhaps the fiercest, on a team full of competitors.
"He competes hard in line drills, in shooting drills, in sprints,"
assistant coach Tony Fuller said of the senior shooting guard.
"Everything we do he's first, or trying to be first."
At practice yesterday, he was running a drill in which two
players take turns driving, pivoting, and passing the ball back out
to the perimeter. The drill does not involve any defenders, but
Lottich had his lower jaw jutted out and his eyes burning with
focus as if he were being guarded tenaciously. At the end of the
drill, he burst into the air and nailed a 3-pointer.
"Whooo! That's right!" he taunted his imaginary defender.
At the end of practice, the players ran wind sprints.
"Haryasz, you better win this!" a coach shouted. Matt
Haryasz, a sophomore forward, ran as fast as he could, wanting
to respond to the challenge. Lottich narrowed his eyes, gritted
his teeth and ran faster. Haryasz came in second.
"It's amazing that after four years he hasn't said 'what the
heck' and started taking it easy a little bit," Fuller said, shaking
his head.
Instead, Lottich, who's scored more points this year than
any other member of the Cardinal, works as hard as he did

freshman year, when he was fighting fora few minutes of
court time per game.
Why?
"Maybe because I need it to be successful," he said. "I'm def
initely not the most athletic guy out there, but I am one of the
more competitive people. So maybe what I lack in athleticism, I
guess I make up for in competitiveness."
Watch Lottich play defense against smooth, quick scorers like
Salim Stoudamire of Arizona or Keith Langford of Kansas, and
you'll see him hustle, grunt, sprint, glare, grab a handful of jer
sey, stick out a knee. Sometimes, he'll get beaten anyway. But
never for lack of effort.
He's probably right that he wouldn't be successful if he
didn't fight so hard. That's true of countless college basketball
players. And maybe he was being sincere in saying that he feels
like he has to compete hard to make up for his lack of athleti
cism. But talk to him a bit more, and you'll find that his com
petitiveness is more than just a calculated response to his cur
rent circumstances.
First, he doesn't really buy the idea that he or his Stanford
teammates are unathletic.
"I was Chicago high school athlete of the year," he pointed
out. "People want to say we're not great athletes, but I think it's
time to turn around that stereotype."
Second, he's had a fighter's mentality since before he had
ever imagined coming to Stanford. It may even be genetic.
Growing up in Chicago, he was raised by his father David, a

Senior guard Matt Lottich might be the most competitive player on the floor this in this
weekend's games. His teammates love him for it, but opponents are less enthusiastic.
