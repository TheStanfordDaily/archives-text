# The 						fiercest competitor
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Forgive Matt Lottich if he got a little excited during Stan
ford's win over UCLA last weekend. If he was running down
court with his face colored deep cardinal, shouting and pumping
his fist violently, all hut breathing fire and smoking from the ears
— it's only because he's a competitor.
Perhaps the fiercest, on a team full of competitors.
"He competes hard in line drills, in shooting drills, in sprints,"
assistant coach Tony Fuller said of the senior shooting guard.
"Everything we do he's first, or trying to be first."
At practice yesterday, he was running a drill in which two
players take turns driving, pivoting, and passing the ball back out
to the perimeter. The drill does not involve any defenders, but
Lottich had his lower jaw jutted out and his eyes burning with
focus as if he were being guarded tenaciously. At the end of the
drill, he burst into the air and nailed a 3-pointer.
"Whooo! That's right!" he taunted his imaginary defender.
At the end of practice, the players ran wind sprints.
"Haryasz, you better win this!" a coach shouted. Matt
Haryasz, a sophomore forward, ran as fast as he could, wanting
to respond to the challenge. Lottich narrowed his eyes, gritted
his teeth and ran faster. Haryasz came in second.
"It's amazing that after four years he hasn't said 'what the
heck' and started taking it easy a little bit," Fuller said, shaking
his head.
Instead, Lottich, who's scored more points this year than
any other member of the Cardinal, works as hard as he did

freshman year, when he was fighting fora few minutes of
court time per game.
Why?
"Maybe because I need it to be successful," he said. "I'm def
initely not the most athletic guy out there, but I am one of the
more competitive people. So maybe what I lack in athleticism, I
guess I make up for in competitiveness."
Watch Lottich play defense against smooth, quick scorers like
Salim Stoudamire of Arizona or Keith Langford of Kansas, and
you'll see him hustle, grunt, sprint, glare, grab a handful of jer
sey, stick out a knee. Sometimes, he'll get beaten anyway. But
never for lack of effort.
He's probably right that he wouldn't be successful if he
didn't fight so hard. That's true of countless college basketball
players. And maybe he was being sincere in saying that he feels
like he has to compete hard to make up for his lack of athleti
cism. But talk to him a bit more, and you'll find that his com
petitiveness is more than just a calculated response to his cur
rent circumstances.
First, he doesn't really buy the idea that he or his Stanford
teammates are unathletic.
"I was Chicago high school athlete of the year," he pointed
out. "People want to say we're not great athletes, but I think it's
time to turn around that stereotype."
Second, he's had a fighter's mentality since before he had
ever imagined coming to Stanford. It may even be genetic.
Growing up in Chicago, he was raised by his father David, a

Senior guard Matt Lottich might be the most competitive player on the floor this in this
weekend's games. His teammates love him for it, but opponents are less enthusiastic.
carpenter, who won a suit for full custody of Matt
after his wife left. When Matt was in seventh grade,
he and hi: father moved to Winnetka, a wealthy
suburb, despite financial difficulties.
"We were living in a one-bedroom apartment
and trying to make ends meet in a town where there
were mansions all over the place," Matt recalls.
"My dad made sacrifices for me so 1 could get a
good education. Then we had to fight just to make
a name for ourselves, because we were kind of like
outsiders in the town."
Lottich did more than make a name for
himself among the 3,000-plus students at New
Trier High School — he made his name leg
endary there. Not only was he all-state in bas
ketball, he was also an all-state quarterback on
the football team and an all-state first base
man on the state championship baseball team.
He got scholarship offers from Division I
schools in all three sports.
His father helped guide, support and tough
en him.
"My dad's kind of a fiery guy too," Lottich ex
plained. "We definitely had some battles in that
house. We used to joke around that it was like two
bulls living in the same house."
Understand, then, that conflict is ingrained in
Lottich's character. He has earned everything
that's come his way at Stanford, too, after toiling
behind Ail-American shooting guard Casey Jacob
sen for his first two years on the team.
As a junior, he played through a slump in which
people questioned whether he deserved his starting
spot. This year, after starting so well that he was
nominated for the John Wooden Award as college
basketball's best player, he again suffered a shoot
ing drought. In the six games between Jan. 22 and
Feb. 14, he shot just 21-of-65 from the field and 8-
of-33 from 3-point range.
The turning point came in the second half of last
Thursday's game at Southern California. Lottich
had scored just two points in the first half, leaving
Josh Childress to carry the offensive burden for the
Cardinal. But Childress started slicing up USC's
man-to-man defense so deftly that Trojan head
coach Henry Bibby was forced to switch to a zone
defense to contain him.
Typically, you don't use a zone against Stanford,
because Lottich will terrorize you with his outside
shooting. With Lottich missing everything, USC
opted to take the gamble.
"You can look at it as a little disrespectful to a
shooter when they go to a zone, because you are
going to get some open, good looks," Lottich said.
"But 1 want to run over and thank a coach if he goes
to a zone."
Lottich didn't run over and thank Bibby. In
stead, he poured in 18 points in the second half to
help seal the win for Stanford.
So if he seemed overenthusiastic against
UCLA two days later — if you didn't like see
ing close-ups of the contorted red face, wild
gestures and shouts that accompanied his
flawless 4-for-4 performance from 3-point
range in that game — forgive him. That's just
his competitive nature.
