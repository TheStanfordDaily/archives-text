### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
It was a fight for survival this week at
the Wildcat Invitational in Tucson, Ariz.
When the dust finally cleared, the No. 11
Vanderbilt women's golf team emerged
with a 17-over-par total of 869 and a team
victory. Stanford finished in sixth place
out of 14 teams, compiling a three-round
score of 904.
Approaching the event, many expected a
shootout in which some of the nation's top
players would pile up birdie after birdie.
However, Monday's first round was de
layed 45 minutes by thunderstorms, and
when play resumed, conditions were wet
and difficult.
Soggy fairways lengthened the normally
short Arizona National Golf Course, and
strong winds turned the first 18 holes into a
battle to break 80.
Stanford fought gamely through the
opening round, shooting 308 as a team.
"With the weather, it was difficult to
really focus on your game because you
had to deal with the wind and the rain and
it got really intense," said senior Kim
Kouwabunpat.
Kouwabunpat led the Cardinal on the
first day of competition, battling through
the sloppy conditions to shoot a 1-under
par 70. The score landed her in a tie for
fourth place individually.
Freshman Lauren Todd carded a 78 and
stood in a tie for 35th place. One stroke
back was fellow freshman Jenni Tangtiphai
boontana, tied for 43rd place.
Rounding out Stanford's first-day scor
ing were senior Angie Rho and sophomore
Kelly Husted. Though Rho recorded her
best finish of the year in Tucson last season,
she struggled to an opening-round 81 on
Monday, dropping back to 50th place over
all. Husted shot 83 and was tied for 60th.
Competing as an individual, sophomore
Stephanie Lue shot 77 to tie for 28th place.
Even No. 3 Arizona, the host of the
event, found itself scuffling on the first day.
The Wildcats seemed to lose much of their

home-course advantage in the unusual ele
ments, stumbling into eighth place after the
first day.
"We're playing the golf course like
we've never seen it before," said Arizona
head coach Greg Allen. "We're hitting it in
the desert and getting big numbers, and
you've got to avoid the big numbers, and
we're not."
As the clouds cleared on Tuesday, Stan
ford took advantage of the improved scor
ing conditions, shooting 300 and gaining
sole possession of sixth place.
Kouwabunpat fell back a bit, shooting
79, but headed into the final round tied for
13th place and in good shape to compete for
her first top-10 finish of the year.
Todd's second-round 72 helped her
climb into a tie for 17th place, while
Tangtiphaiboontana shot 75 and got into
the clubhouse tied for 31st.
Husted bounced back from a tough first
round with a 74 on Tuesday and moved all
the way up to 43rd place overall. Rho con
tinued to struggle, carding a 79 and lan
guishing in 53rd.
As the third round began, the Cardinal
was just seven shots behind fifth-place
UNLV and 17 shots behind fourth-place
California. Meanwhile, No. 11 Vanderbilt
held a slim three-shot lead over No. 2
UCLA in the race for the team title.
The individual competition was tight as
well, with a three-way tie for the lead at 2-
under-par and another pair in hot pursuit
one stroke back.
Stanford played its best round of the
week — 296 — but it wasn't enough to
make up any ground and the Cardinal fin
ished seven strokes out of the top five.
Todd continued her charge on the final
day, posting a 1-under-par 70 and finishing
in a tie for 11th place individually. It marks
I odd's second consecutive top-25 perfor
mance and the best finish of her young col
legiate career.
Bouncing back from her rough second
round, Kouwabunpat fired a 74 on Wednes
day, finishing in a tie for 17th place. It was
the first time this year that two members of
the team have cracked the individual top 25
in the same event.
In her tirst tournament of the spring, Husted fin
ished solidly, backing up her second-round 74 with the
same on Wednesday. She passed six more names on
the final day to claim a share of 37th place.
Tangtiphaiboontana was one shot behind her team
mate and tied tor 40th place overall. Rho never got on
track, recording a 6-over-par 78 for her third round
and finishing in 52nd place. Lue struggled as well, fir
ing a 79 en route to a 42nd-place finish.
The individual crown went to Vanderbilt senior
May Wood, who distanced herself from the rest of
the leader board — including her sister —in con
vincing fashion. Her final-round 69 sealed a three
stroke victory and gave the Commodores a sweep
for the tournament.
With the conclusion of the Wildcat Invitational,
Stanford returns home for more than a month. The
team won't compete again until the Ping ASU Invita
tional on April 2-4.

the final day to claim a share of 37th place.
Tangtiphaiboontana was one shot behind her team
mate and tied tor 40th place overall. Rho never got on
track, recording a 6-over-par 78 for her third round
and finishing in 52nd place. Lue struggled as well, fir
ing a 79 en route to a 42nd-place finish.
The individual crown went to Vanderbilt senior
May Wood, who distanced herself from the rest of
the leader board — including her sister —in con
vincing fashion. Her final-round 69 sealed a three
stroke victory and gave the Commodores a sweep
for the tournament.
With the conclusion of the Wildcat Invitational,
Stanford returns home for more than a month. The
team won't compete again until the Ping ASU Invita
tional on April 2-4.
It was a fight for survival this week at
the Wildcat Invitational in Tucson, Ariz.
When the dust finally cleared, the No. 11
Vanderbilt women's golf team emerged
with a 17-over-par total of 869 and a team
victory. Stanford finished in sixth place
out of 14 teams, compiling a three-round
score of 904.
Approaching the event, many expected a
shootout in which some of the nation's top
players would pile up birdie after birdie.
However, Monday's first round was de
layed 45 minutes by thunderstorms, and
when play resumed, conditions were wet
and difficult.
Soggy fairways lengthened the normally
short Arizona National Golf Course, and
strong winds turned the first 18 holes into a
battle to break 80.
Stanford fought gamely through the
opening round, shooting 308 as a team.
"With the weather, it was difficult to
really focus on your game because you
had to deal with the wind and the rain and
it got really intense," said senior Kim
Kouwabunpat.
Kouwabunpat led the Cardinal on the
first day of competition, battling through
the sloppy conditions to shoot a 1-under
par 70. The score landed her in a tie for
fourth place individually.
Freshman Lauren Todd carded a 78 and
stood in a tie for 35th place. One stroke
back was fellow freshman Jenni Tangtiphai
boontana, tied for 43rd place.
Rounding out Stanford's first-day scor
ing were senior Angie Rho and sophomore
Kelly Husted. Though Rho recorded her
best finish of the year in Tucson last season,
she struggled to an opening-round 81 on
Monday, dropping back to 50th place over
all. Husted shot 83 and was tied for 60th.
Competing as an individual, sophomore
Stephanie Lue shot 77 to tie for 28th place.
Even No. 3 Arizona, the host of the
event, found itself scuffling on the first day.
The Wildcats seemed to lose much of their

home-course advantage in the unusual ele
ments, stumbling into eighth place after the
first day.
"We're playing the golf course like
we've never seen it before," said Arizona
head coach Greg Allen. "We're hitting it in
the desert and getting big numbers, and
you've got to avoid the big numbers, and
we're not."
As the clouds cleared on Tuesday, Stan
ford took advantage of the improved scor
ing conditions, shooting 300 and gaining
sole possession of sixth place.
Kouwabunpat fell back a bit, shooting
79, but headed into the final round tied for
13th place and in good shape to compete for
her first top-10 finish of the year.
Todd's second-round 72 helped her
climb into a tie for 17th place, while
Tangtiphaiboontana shot 75 and got into
the clubhouse tied for 31st.
Husted bounced back from a tough first
round with a 74 on Tuesday and moved all
the way up to 43rd place overall. Rho con
tinued to struggle, carding a 79 and lan
guishing in 53rd.
As the third round began, the Cardinal
was just seven shots behind fifth-place
UNLV and 17 shots behind fourth-place
California. Meanwhile, No. 11 Vanderbilt
held a slim three-shot lead over No. 2
UCLA in the race for the team title.
The individual competition was tight as
well, with a three-way tie for the lead at 2-
under-par and another pair in hot pursuit
one stroke back.
Stanford played its best round of the
week — 296 — but it wasn't enough to
make up any ground and the Cardinal fin
ished seven strokes out of the top five.
Todd continued her charge on the final
day, posting a 1-under-par 70 and finishing
in a tie for 11th place individually. It marks
I odd's second consecutive top-25 perfor
mance and the best finish of her young col
legiate career.
Bouncing back from her rough second
round, Kouwabunpat fired a 74 on Wednes
day, finishing in a tie for 17th place. It was
the first time this year that two members of
the team have cracked the individual top 25
in the same event.
In her tirst tournament of the spring, Husted fin
ished solidly, backing up her second-round 74 with the
same on Wednesday. She passed six more names on
the final day to claim a share of 37th place.
Tangtiphaiboontana was one shot behind her team
mate and tied tor 40th place overall. Rho never got on
track, recording a 6-over-par 78 for her third round
and finishing in 52nd place. Lue struggled as well, fir
