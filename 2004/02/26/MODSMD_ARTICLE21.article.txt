# Babel's 'Maria' makes U.S. debut at Pigott
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Secret police. Jewish mobsters. Smug
glers. Isaac Babel's famous play "Maria" has
it all.
In the play's eight scenes, Russian-Jewish
writer Babel takes his audience to Petrograd,
the ancient imperial capital of Russia, at the
end of the Russian Civil War. Desperation,
violence and corruption, which surround the
events in the play, reflect an era when the So
viets tried to rid the country of class distinc
tions. The play follows an aristocratic family
that loses nearly everything through this
time of chaos in Russia.
"Maria" premiered in the United States
for the first time on Feb. 19 in the Pigott The
ater at Stanford, and performances will also
take place from Feb. 26 to 29. Tickets have
been selling quickly for the performances;
the Feb. 29 show is already sold out.
The premiere of "Maria" in the United
States is under the direction of Drama Prof.
Carl Weber. Born in Germany, Weber
began his career as an actor at the Heidel
berg City Theater. He has lectured or direct
ed at Carnegie-Mellon University, Colum
bia University, Princeton University, Tem
ple University and the Justinvon Liebing
Universitat at Giessen. The actors in
"Maria" are mostly Stanford students —
both undergraduates and graduate students
— but there are a few professional actors, in
cluding a Brazilian television actor.
Slavic Languages and Literature Prof.
Gregory Freidin, approached Weber about
directing one of Babel's plays. Weber chose
to direct "Maria" as opposed to Babel's
other play "Sunset."
"I've always loved 'Maria,' " Weber said.
"1 read the play many years ago in German
and approached American producers to pro
duce the play, but at the time there was no
English translation. Even when the English
translation became available, regional the
aters were unwilling to produce the play be
cause the cast is very large and it is an expen
sive production."
Weber's clear-cut directing style allowed
him to direct a relatively large cast of 25
members and coordinate a play with many
changing scenes and locations.

"Carl has a very straightforward and effi
cient directing style," said Mandana Khosh
nevisan, Class of '01. Khoshnevisan is the
publicist for the Drama Department and
also plays a janitor / concierge in the play.
According to Khoshnevisan, the storyline
of "Maria" is structured in an unconvention
al, nonlinear fashion.
"The play runs like a film — there are so
many different locations and characters that
you have to be very attentive. They even had
to build a revolving stage in order to accom
modate all of the changing locations in the
story," Khoshnevisan said. "The play flows
in a very subtle manner."
Senior Adrian Coburn, a music major
who composed or rearranged several pieces
tor the play — including "Yablochka," a
piece sung in the second scene and arranged
the musical interludes for the play — said
working on the play was a "good experi
ence," but that "it was way, way, way more
work than [one would] think."
Coburn currently directs the Slavic folk
music choir. She was approached by Freidin
to help out with the play, because Coburn
both speaks Russian and writes music, even
though she had never worked with Weber
before working on Babel's "Maria."
The play is a part of a larger program
planned at Stanford to honor Babel's life and
work. An exhibition in the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Exhibit Pavilion is currently pre
senting "Isaac Babel: A Writer's Life,"
which will be on display until March 2. An in
ternational conference titled "Isaac Babel: A
Writer's Life" is set to take place from Feb.
29 to March 2 and will feature professors
from Stanford, Harvard and other American
universities — as well as a range of visiting
international professors from countries such
as Budapest, Israel and Russia.
Babel is one of the most translated So
viet authors of his generation. He also
wrote a series of short stories, published as
"Red Cavalry."
The events surrounding Babel's death are
as complicated and full of secrecy as the sto
ries in his plays. One night in 1939, Babel was
arrested by Soviet secret police and eventu
ally executed in the Lubyanka prison.
Babel's existence was virtually erased from
history by the Soviet government until 1954.

Although his plays have been around for
nearly 50 years, the Russian premiere of
"Maria" did not take place until 1994.
"The play is very controversial,"
Weber said. "[lt] shows the stories of both
sides clashing with each other during the
Russian Civil War — the Bolsheviks and
the old society members — without mak

ing a judgment one way or another.
Babel's opinion on either side is very am
biguous, but he does make the statement
that what happened after the (Bolshevik]
revolution may not have been the best
thing for Russia."
Weber encouraged people to see the
play even if they don't know much about

Russian history.
He explained: "The play is very self-ex
planatory. If you know a lot about the peri
od it may enrich the experience, but all of
the conflicts are quite easy to understand.
The program handed out before the play
can fill in any gaps you might have about
this era."

The events surrounding Babel's death are
as complicated and full of secrecy as the sto
ries in his plays. One night in 1939, Babel was
arrested by Soviet secret police and eventu
ally executed in the Lubyanka prison.
Babel's existence was virtually erased from
history by the Soviet government until 1954.

Although his plays have been around for
nearly 50 years, the Russian premiere of
"Maria" did not take place until 1994.
"The play is very controversial,"
Weber said. "[lt] shows the stories of both
sides clashing with each other during the
Russian Civil War — the Bolsheviks and
the old society members — without mak

ing a judgment one way or another.
Babel's opinion on either side is very am
biguous, but he does make the statement
that what happened after the (Bolshevik]
revolution may not have been the best
thing for Russia."
Weber encouraged people to see the
play even if they don't know much about

Russian history.
He explained: "The play is very self-ex
planatory. If you know a lot about the peri
od it may enrich the experience, but all of
the conflicts are quite easy to understand.
The program handed out before the play
can fill in any gaps you might have about
this era."

This is the second week of the U.S. premiere of Isaac Babel's play "Maria," directed by Carl Weber. The play is part of a larger pro
gram at Stanford honoring Babel's life.
Secret police. Jewish mobsters. Smug
glers. Isaac Babel's famous play "Maria" has
it all.
In the play's eight scenes, Russian-Jewish
writer Babel takes his audience to Petrograd,
the ancient imperial capital of Russia, at the
end of the Russian Civil War. Desperation,
violence and corruption, which surround the
events in the play, reflect an era when the So
viets tried to rid the country of class distinc
tions. The play follows an aristocratic family
that loses nearly everything through this
time of chaos in Russia.
"Maria" premiered in the United States
for the first time on Feb. 19 in the Pigott The
ater at Stanford, and performances will also
take place from Feb. 26 to 29. Tickets have
been selling quickly for the performances;
the Feb. 29 show is already sold out.
The premiere of "Maria" in the United
States is under the direction of Drama Prof.
Carl Weber. Born in Germany, Weber
began his career as an actor at the Heidel
berg City Theater. He has lectured or direct
ed at Carnegie-Mellon University, Colum
bia University, Princeton University, Tem
ple University and the Justinvon Liebing
Universitat at Giessen. The actors in
"Maria" are mostly Stanford students —
both undergraduates and graduate students
— but there are a few professional actors, in
cluding a Brazilian television actor.
Slavic Languages and Literature Prof.
Gregory Freidin, approached Weber about
directing one of Babel's plays. Weber chose
to direct "Maria" as opposed to Babel's
other play "Sunset."
"I've always loved 'Maria,' " Weber said.
"1 read the play many years ago in German
and approached American producers to pro
duce the play, but at the time there was no
English translation. Even when the English
translation became available, regional the
aters were unwilling to produce the play be
cause the cast is very large and it is an expen
sive production."
Weber's clear-cut directing style allowed
him to direct a relatively large cast of 25
members and coordinate a play with many
changing scenes and locations.

"Carl has a very straightforward and effi
cient directing style," said Mandana Khosh
nevisan, Class of '01. Khoshnevisan is the
publicist for the Drama Department and
also plays a janitor / concierge in the play.
According to Khoshnevisan, the storyline
of "Maria" is structured in an unconvention
al, nonlinear fashion.
"The play runs like a film — there are so
many different locations and characters that
you have to be very attentive. They even had
to build a revolving stage in order to accom
modate all of the changing locations in the
story," Khoshnevisan said. "The play flows
in a very subtle manner."
Senior Adrian Coburn, a music major
who composed or rearranged several pieces
tor the play — including "Yablochka," a
piece sung in the second scene and arranged
the musical interludes for the play — said
working on the play was a "good experi
ence," but that "it was way, way, way more
work than [one would] think."
Coburn currently directs the Slavic folk
music choir. She was approached by Freidin
to help out with the play, because Coburn
both speaks Russian and writes music, even
though she had never worked with Weber
before working on Babel's "Maria."
The play is a part of a larger program
planned at Stanford to honor Babel's life and
work. An exhibition in the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Exhibit Pavilion is currently pre
senting "Isaac Babel: A Writer's Life,"
which will be on display until March 2. An in
ternational conference titled "Isaac Babel: A
Writer's Life" is set to take place from Feb.
29 to March 2 and will feature professors
from Stanford, Harvard and other American
universities — as well as a range of visiting
international professors from countries such
as Budapest, Israel and Russia.
Babel is one of the most translated So
viet authors of his generation. He also
wrote a series of short stories, published as
"Red Cavalry."
