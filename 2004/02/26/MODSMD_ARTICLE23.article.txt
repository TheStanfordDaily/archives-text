## National eating disorders awareness week Helping residents in need, dorm staff steps up to the challenge 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
The story is all too common. A
young woman begins to lose weight
and is cheered on by her friends. A
young man regularly hits the gym.
and his girlfriend compliments his
growing biceps. In a stressful academ
ic environment, working out and diet
ing become ways to control one as
pect of an otherwise chaotic lifestyle.
Before long, what was once a healthy
habit begins to spiral out of control —
fueled by images in the media that
laud thinness — and the person de
velops an eating disorder.
Clinical disorders include anorex
ia nervosa, bulimia and binge-eating
disorder. While many people do not
have all of the symptoms of the clin
ical condition, a large portion of the
college population has what is
known as "disordered eating,"
which includes symptoms such as
going through occasional periods of
hinging and / or purging, dieting re
peatedly, excessively worrying about
food intake or suffering from poor
body image.
Many people on campus know a
friend or someone in their residence
who steers clear of any type of "bad"
food, avoids meals or exercises ex
cessively — all classical signs of dis
ordered eating.
"The issues of body image.

food and self esteem affect so
many students on campus," ex
plained Carole Pertofsky, director
of Health Promotion Services at
the Vaden Student Health Center.
"We are receiving messages from
some of the fitness centers on
campus about students that are
showing up seven days a week and
working out three or four hours
each day. We've simply never got
ten this many concerned people
who come to us about problems
their residents or friends have —
problems that are not minor and
are on the more serious side of the
disordered eating spectrum."
Peer health educators (PHEs)
echoed Pertofsky's statements
"I think that eating disorders
are a huge problem at Stanford,"
said Kat Alquero, a junior and
PHE in Larkin. "1 feel that it is
safe to say that every student on
campus knows someone who deals
with disordered eating, if not an
eating disorder."
When most people think of the
classical eating disorder patient,
they picture a woman, but the de
mographics of eating disorders are
changing. Vivian Crisman, the nu
tritionist at Vaden, said she has no
ticed a rise in the number of men
with disordered eating patterns, ex
cessive supplement use or intense
exercise patterns.

"Four or five years ago, I
wouldn't see a single guy come into
my office fora nutrition consulta
tion," Crisman said. "Now, while
men are still the minority, I see more
cases each year — and the numbers
may be higher than we think. Guys
are less likely to seek help or may
have very different symptoms and
may not identify their problem as an
eating disorder."
Residential stall working
on the front lines
Due to the stigmas attached to eat
ing disorders, people are resistant to
seek help and often deny their strug
gles, cases oftentimes go unreported.
Determining the exact percentage of
people with eating disorders is there
fore quite difficult, if not impossible.
But according to the estimates of the
National Eating Disorders Associa
tion (NEDA), up to 15 percent of
young women in the United States
have substantially disordered eating
behaviors. The figure is even more
shocking when put into tangible
terms: In a typical dorm of about 100
students (with an even sex ratio),
seven or eight women may show signs
of unhealthy eating and exercising
behaviors, and the number of men
with eating disorders is rapidly rising.
Given such figures, residential staff
on campus have an enormous respon

sibility. Resident assistants (RAs) or
PHEs can often be the first outlet or
source of help fora resident with dis
ordered eating.
Dealing with a resident who has an
eating disorder is an extremely chal
lenging task — one that Vaden wants
to make more straightforward for resi
dential staff. According to Alcjuero,
residential staffers receive extensive
training in health issues — particularly
focusing on how to recognize residents
with disordered eating problems.
PHEs are often the first ones ap
proached by concerned staff mem
bers or friends because, as Alquero
explained, they are the "health ex
pert[s] on staff and [the) default per
son to turn to with questions about
eating disorders.
"However, everyone has their
own experience and knowledge to
share when it comes to confronting
someone with a problem. We defi
nitely all work together as a team to
deal with this issue in what we feel is
the most helpful and supportive
way," Alquero said.
Yet there are often cases that
elude even the most trained staff,
and in those cases, they turn to
Vaden. Residential Edudaction
(ResEd) staff often refer students to
see Crisman, who said that about
thirty percent of the nutrition refer
rals she sees each year have to do
with disordered eating concerns.
"Staff see disordered eating in their
residences and they want to know how
to respond," said Kate Bedford, peer
health coordinator in the Health Pro
motion Services at Vaden.
Vaden helps student leaders
deal with cases
In response to a rising percentage
of reported cases of eating disorders
— and distressed messages from resi
dential staff about what to do about
their cases, Vaden has commissioned
an Eating Disorders Taskforce to de
velop a strategic plan of action dealing
with these matters. The taskforce in
cludes Vaden staff members, resi
dence deans, students and PHEs. One
goal of the taskforce is to help student
leaders — such as residential staff
members — learn ways to both edu
cate students about and approach stu
dents with disordered eating.
This past Tuesday, Vaden invited
motivational speaker and educator
Jessica Weiner to speak with residen
tial staff members at a meeting held at
the Vice Provosts Conference Room.
Members of ResEd — from RAs to
resident deans to resident fellows —
attended the roundtable discussion
with Weiner.
Weiner came to speak to Stanford
students in October, and her talk was
well attended. Over 120 students came
to listen to her speak.
"Students loved Jessica s presenta
tion when she was here in October,"
Bedford said. "We had a great turnout
and RAs and PHEs gave us wonderful
feedback about her presentation, so
we jumped at the opportunity to bring
her back on campus."

"[We wanted her) to meet specif
ically with staff because they are on
the front lines when it comes to eat
ing disorders and disordered eating.
We hope that Jessica's visit will help
residential staff address these issues
in their dorms and communities,"
Bedford added.
Weiner is the author of the hook
"A Very Hungry' Girl," published in
2003, that chronicles her recovery
from an eating disorder. She has
written several plays about serious
social issues, including eating disor
ders, relationships, school violence,
date rape and hate crimes. Weiner
has toured the nation with her the
ater company ACT Out Ensemble,
which is based in Indianapolis, and
her work has often been used in crit
ical social events, such as the recon
ciliation and recovery period of
Columbine High School in 1999.
In order to address issues perti
nent to the Stanford community,
Weiner had everyone at the
roundtable discussion bring up issues
they were dealing with in their dorms
/ houses and ask questions they had
about approaching a resident with
disordered eating behavior.
Although at the meeting Weiner
mentioned that "eating disorders do
not discriminate by age, gender,
race or socioeconomic status," she
later added in an interview with The
Daily that some environments can
be more conducive to pushing vul
nerable students into a full-blown
eating disorder.
"There are some college climates
that can lead to higher proportions
of eating disorders on campus," she
said. "Some colleges have competi
tive athletics programs, some have
competitive academics. Stanford has
both, making the pressures to be
'perfect' even greater."

She proceeded to come up with
strategies on how staff members could
deal with such issues. One of Weiner's
key points was that "[friends, parents,
staff and caregivers] cannot and will
not fix / heal / cure somebody with an
eating disorder."
"This is something that controls
and infiltrates their whole lives/'
she said. "At the same time, I don't
want you to feet hopeless. There
are still so many ways in which you
can help someone."
Peers and staff'can make a difference
Weiner outlined ways in which
staff members could help: engaging
the community, whether the dorm or
the house, in dealing with the prob
lem; and planning a confrontation to
maximize the chances of successful in
tervention; or referring the resident to
outside sources such as Vaden staff
members, psychological services or a
resident dean.
Additionally, Weiner ex
plained, "You must exude the prin
ciples that you believe in." She
mentioned how often certain be
haviors, such as talking about diet
ing or purchasing and reading fit
ness magazines, may lead to an at
mosphere that is conducive to con
tinuous eating or excessive exercis
ing. Those who wanted to help a
friend or a peer, she said, can often
start by analyzing their own atti
tudes and behaviors.
Weiner stressed: "Be conscious
of the language you are using when
talking about yourself. How often
do you put yourself down? If you
are using negative language when
you refer to your own body or
habits, you may not be as credible
when you approach others about
their behavior."
