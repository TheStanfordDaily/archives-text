# Approaching a friend with an eating disorder
## 
### 
Learn as much as you can about eating disorders.
Know the differences between facts and myths about weight,
nutrition and exercise. Knowing the facts will help you reason
against any inaccurate ideas your friend may be using as excus
es to maintain their disordered eating patterns
Be honest. Talk openly and honestly about your concerns with
the person who is struggling with eating or body image prob
lems. Avoiding or ignoring it won't help.
Be caring, but firm. Caring about your friend does not mean
being manipulated by them. Your friend must be responsible for
their actions and the consequences of those actions. Avoid mak
ing rules, promises or expectations that you cannot or will not
upnold. For example. "I promise not to tell anyone" or "If you do
this one more time I'll never talk to you again' are not honest
statements.
Compliment your friend's wonderful personality, successes or
accomplishments. Remind your friend that "true beauty" is not
simply skin deep.
Be a good role model in regard to sensible eating, exercise
and self-acceptance
Tell someone. It may seem difficult to know when. if at all, to
tell someone else about your concerns. Addressing body image
issues or eating problems in their beginning stages offers your
friend the best chance for working through these issues and be
coming healthy again. Don't wait until the situation is so severe
that your friend's life is in danger. Your friend needs as much
support and understanding as possible.
