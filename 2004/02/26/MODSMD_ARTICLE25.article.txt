## Adding a little spice to your sex life 
### VINNI INTERSIMONE SEX COLUMNIST 
Are you tired of the old heave ho? Is the mundane
back and forth getting you down? Then what you need is
a bit more zing for your fling: Today we'll be talking
about how to have more interesting, engaging and tanta
lizing sex. Hold on, I'm going to make it a bumpy ride.
From Dr. Ruth to Dr. Vinni (OK, so I'm not a doc
tor), sex experts often recommend a little paprika to
perk up your pecker. Suggestions on adding a new bent
on your sex life include having sex in a new location,
engaging in fantasy play and indulging in a bit of un
usual pleasure. Being the thorough sex columnist that
I am, today's column will cover all these major topics
— and a bit more.
The setting of your sexual encounter sets the mood,
which, in turn, determines the style of sex in which you'll
be engaging.
Playing techno music during the act makes for fast
paced, passionate — but not particularly tender — sex. The
Queer as Folk-type sex, if you will. The raunchy stuff.
On the other side of the spectrum, playing Dave
Matthews Band-type music when getting into the action
can lead to slow, rhythmic grinding. (The scene in "Meet

Joe Black" with Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani instantly
comes to mind.) But don't limit yourself to one style;
mixing slow and fast music and following the rhythm will
prolong the experience and vary your pleasure.
Where to have sex is your next dilemma. Your bed
room is quite comfortable, but isn't exactly spicy — and
there's always that annoying other person that lives there
with you. Green Library's (infamous) stacks are risky,
but don't quite promote long, loving sex. Perhaps some
thing between the two extremes of boredom and sketch
iness. Try a secluded beach at sundown or a patch of
grass off the beaten trail. Why feci guilty about doing it
in the open air. What's more natural than sex outdoors?
Aside from the outside entertainment, indoor fun
can be innovative as well. Sneaking your partner to the
dorm shower is a bit sketchy (which may be a good
thing — depending on what you're up for), but even a
little difference like having sex on the floor, on a chair
or on your desk adds excitement. You can escape the
boredom of the hum drum mattress and pillow. Here's
a sex equation for you: Experimentation in your sexu
al life equals more fun.
Fantasy can also add a little bounce to your thrust. Now,
when I say fantasy, I don't mean one of you has to dress up
like the naughty nurse from "Kill Bill" and the other as a

helpless patient in need of assistance. (If that's your cup of
tea, though, by all means, drink up.) Fantasy doesn't have
to mean playing "dress up." Give your sex some flair by
taking on a different attitude than you might be used to. If
you're usually soft and gentle in bed, go wild every now and
then and pretend you're a bit more wicked than your lover
ever thought possible. Gently bite, scratch and moan.
Move around more and take control — be on top.
If you're already the aggressor in bed, surprise
your lover even more by making your partner take
the lead. Whisper into your lover's ear that tonight
you want him or her to be on top (not that you can't
lead from the bottom.) If your loved one doesn't
know what you want, you can whisper the general
gist of your desires, but let your partner do it. Sur
rendering control can be an awesome experience.
Going from a bit different to a bit radical, let's talk
toys. First of all. you don't have to go to the sex shop to
add extras to your love life. Perhaps the most enjoyable
extras can be found at your local supermarket. Choco
late is key. From chocolate-covered strawberries to melt
ed chocolate, the possibilities are endless. Get a brush,
melt some chocolate and start painting. It's hard to tell
which is more fun, the painting or the clean up.
If you are brave enough to go to a sex-toy shop and

happen to he in L.A., I recommend the Hustler store
on Sunset Boulevard. For Larry Flint, the shop is sur
prisingly classy (well, as classy as a store with dildos
hanging on the walls can be). In this sex-toy shop and
dozens of others like it throughout San Francisco,
you'll find flavored, colored and bumpy condoms; fla
vored, scented and silicon lube; dildos, vibrators, butt
plugs, cock rings, hand cuffs, whips, chains and a num
ber of things even I don't know the names of. If there's
something out there that tickles your pickle, it
shouldn't be hard to find.
Using sex-toys, like trying out different locations and
attitudes, add variety to vanilla. Employ them sparingly
like you would sprinkles to frozen yogurt. The fro-yo is
what makes the dessert, the sprinkles just add that little
extra something to bring you over the edge.
Just remember to talk about new ideas with your
partner beforehand — surprises can be good, but they
can also scare someone off. Talking about your sex life
is always fun, and it can bring additional intimacy into
your relationship.

tor), sex experts often recommend a little paprika to
perk up your pecker. Suggestions on adding a new bent
on your sex life include having sex in a new location,
engaging in fantasy play and indulging in a bit of un
usual pleasure. Being the thorough sex columnist that
I am, today's column will cover all these major topics
— and a bit more.
The setting of your sexual encounter sets the mood,
which, in turn, determines the style of sex in which you'll
be engaging.
Playing techno music during the act makes for fast
paced, passionate — but not particularly tender — sex. The
Queer as Folk-type sex, if you will. The raunchy stuff.
On the other side of the spectrum, playing Dave
Matthews Band-type music when getting into the action
can lead to slow, rhythmic grinding. (The scene in "Meet

Joe Black" with Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani instantly
comes to mind.) But don't limit yourself to one style;
mixing slow and fast music and following the rhythm will
prolong the experience and vary your pleasure.
Where to have sex is your next dilemma. Your bed
room is quite comfortable, but isn't exactly spicy — and
there's always that annoying other person that lives there
with you. Green Library's (infamous) stacks are risky,
but don't quite promote long, loving sex. Perhaps some
thing between the two extremes of boredom and sketch
iness. Try a secluded beach at sundown or a patch of
grass off the beaten trail. Why feci guilty about doing it
in the open air. What's more natural than sex outdoors?
Aside from the outside entertainment, indoor fun
can be innovative as well. Sneaking your partner to the
dorm shower is a bit sketchy (which may be a good
thing — depending on what you're up for), but even a
little difference like having sex on the floor, on a chair
or on your desk adds excitement. You can escape the
boredom of the hum drum mattress and pillow. Here's
a sex equation for you: Experimentation in your sexu
al life equals more fun.
Fantasy can also add a little bounce to your thrust. Now,
when I say fantasy, I don't mean one of you has to dress up
like the naughty nurse from "Kill Bill" and the other as a

helpless patient in need of assistance. (If that's your cup of
tea, though, by all means, drink up.) Fantasy doesn't have
to mean playing "dress up." Give your sex some flair by
taking on a different attitude than you might be used to. If
you're usually soft and gentle in bed, go wild every now and
then and pretend you're a bit more wicked than your lover
ever thought possible. Gently bite, scratch and moan.
Move around more and take control — be on top.
If you're already the aggressor in bed, surprise
your lover even more by making your partner take
the lead. Whisper into your lover's ear that tonight
you want him or her to be on top (not that you can't
lead from the bottom.) If your loved one doesn't
know what you want, you can whisper the general
gist of your desires, but let your partner do it. Sur
rendering control can be an awesome experience.
Going from a bit different to a bit radical, let's talk
toys. First of all. you don't have to go to the sex shop to
add extras to your love life. Perhaps the most enjoyable
extras can be found at your local supermarket. Choco
late is key. From chocolate-covered strawberries to melt
ed chocolate, the possibilities are endless. Get a brush,
melt some chocolate and start painting. It's hard to tell
which is more fun, the painting or the clean up.
If you are brave enough to go to a sex-toy shop and

happen to he in L.A., I recommend the Hustler store
on Sunset Boulevard. For Larry Flint, the shop is sur
prisingly classy (well, as classy as a store with dildos
hanging on the walls can be). In this sex-toy shop and
dozens of others like it throughout San Francisco,
you'll find flavored, colored and bumpy condoms; fla
vored, scented and silicon lube; dildos, vibrators, butt
plugs, cock rings, hand cuffs, whips, chains and a num
ber of things even I don't know the names of. If there's
something out there that tickles your pickle, it
shouldn't be hard to find.
Using sex-toys, like trying out different locations and
attitudes, add variety to vanilla. Employ them sparingly
like you would sprinkles to frozen yogurt. The fro-yo is
what makes the dessert, the sprinkles just add that little
extra something to bring you over the edge.
Just remember to talk about new ideas with your
partner beforehand — surprises can be good, but they
can also scare someone off. Talking about your sex life
is always fun, and it can bring additional intimacy into
your relationship.
