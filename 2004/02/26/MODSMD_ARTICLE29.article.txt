# Ahead Of The PAC
## Women seek Pac-10 crown at Oregon, OSU 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
Last weekend, the No. 10 Stanford women's basketball
team (20-5, 13-3 Pacific 10 Conference) went into its two
games with a lot at stake — namely, the conference lead
— and it came away with decisive victories over Southern
California (14-11,11-6) and UCLA (15-11,10-7).
This weekend will be no different for the Cardinal as it
travels north to take on Oregon (12-14,4-12) on Thursday
at 7 p.m. and Oregon State (14-11,8-8) on Saturday at 3 p.m.
Heading into the final week of regular season confer
ence play. Stanford sits atop the Pac-10 leaderboard, but
with just one game separating it from second-place Ari
zona (20-7, 12-4) and Arizona State (17-8, 11-5), just two
games back in third place.
With a victory on Thursday night, the Cardinal can
clinch at least a share of the regular season Pac-10 Title,
but with a sweep of the Oregon schools, the squad can as
sure itself the No. 1 seed in the Pac-10 Tournament.
"We just want to go out and execute offensively, keep
playing defense the way we've been playing and re
bound," said Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. "We
just want to play well and get good momentum going into
the tournament."
The Ducks, who showed great promise to start the sea
son with a win over then-No. 9 Louisiana State, have since
been on a season-long skid in large part because of a sea
son-ending ACL tear to star forward Catherine
Kraayeveld. Kraayeveld was averaging 17.2 points and 8.6
rebounds per game.
Unfortunately for Oregon, the list of injuries does not
end there. Junior point guard Corrie Misuzawa, a transfer
from St. Mary's who leads the Pac-10 in assists per game
(6.2), partially tore her MCL.
Misuzawa is attempting to finish out the season, but is
unable to practice with the team.
"It's not something that our players want to use as an
excuse," said Oregon head coach Bev Smith. "I think al
most everyone in the country is feeling it at this point in
the season."
Stanford, however, may be one of the few teams whose
health isn't suffering. After an injury-plagued start to the
season, the Cardinal seems to be getting back to 100 per
cent at exactly the right time.
Six Stanford players have missed time due to injury

this season — freshman center Kristen Newlin (bone
bruise), junior center Chelsea Trotter (chronic knee
pain), senior forward Nicole Powell (sprained ankle), ju
nior forward T'Nae Thiel (stress fracture), junior forward
Azella Perryman (stress fracture) and redshirt freshman
Eziamaka Okafor (torn Achilles' tendon). Okafor made
the first appearance of her Cardinal career last week
against USC after sitting out her true freshman season
with a torn ACL.
"The main thing for us is being healthy," VanDerveer
said. "We had a great practice [MondayJ with everyone fi
nally participating. We know that we have a really impor
tant road trip up in Oregon and we're really excited."
Oregon State should prove to be more of a challenge
for the Cardinal. The Beavers feature a lineup that in
cludes senior center Brina Chaney. who owns the school
record for most career blocked shots and provides an ex
cellent defensive presence in the paint.
In addition to Chaney, first-team All-Pac-10 point
guard Leilani Estavan and guard Shannon Howell lead
Oregon State.
Shutting down Howell, a transfer from Nebraska, will
be key if Stanford is to come away with the victory. The ju
nior dropped 32 points on the Cardinal the last time the
two teams faced off, the highest individual point total
Stanford has allowed all season. She currently averages
15.3 points per game.
Despite Howell's impressive early-season perfor
mance, the Cardinal recorded a dominating victory over
the Beavers in December — and that was with All-Amer
ican Powell side-lined with a sprained ankle.
However, since the two teams' first meeting, Oregon
State has worked to integrate Howell better into its of
fense. After several high-scoring performances by How
ell — that did not translate into Beaver wins — Oregon
State head coach Judy Spoelstra admitted to her players
having a tendency to stand around and just watch Howell
go to work.
Heading into a weekend in which the Cardinal is fac
ing two teams it has already beaten — and beaten handi
ly, VanDerveer stressed her team's need to avoid any sort
of complacency.
"It's really important that we are as hungry when we
play a team for the second time after we've beaten them,"
she said. "That we come out and are aggressive and play
well. We need to be healthy and play with confidence."

T'Nae Thiel skies fora shot against UCLA last weekend. The Cardinal needs to win both games against
the Oregon teams to win the Pac-10 title outright, and one to guarantee a tie.
