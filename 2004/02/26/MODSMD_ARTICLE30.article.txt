# Perryman's post tenacity balances attack
## 
### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Balance.
It's one of those words we love
to toss around casually, especially
here at Stanford. It's prescriptive,
it's addictive, it's positively Oprah
esque.
And it holds the remarkable
cultural distinction of actually
working.
Just ask Azella Perryman and
the No. 10 Stanford women's bas
ketball team as they head to Ore
gon to round out the Pacific-10
Conference regular season and
enter the Pac-10 tournament next
weekend as its top seed.
It has been a rough conference
road for the Cardinal (20-5, 13-3
Pac-10). The Cardinal suffered its
first loss in conference play at
Southern California in January
and floundered during its subse
quent road trip to Arizona, drop
ping both games.
While lesser teams might have
started to unravel at this point,
Stanford took a hard look at itself
and made adjustments. Though
the team may have been lulled into
a false sense of complacency, ag
gression instead became a priority.
Where defensive lulls frustrated
the Cardinal's second halves,
tenacity became a 40-minute char
acteristic. And finally, where Stan
ford's offense might have looked a
little stagnant, versatility became
its greatest weapon.
At least, that's certainly what
last weekend's vengeful, 75-57
rout of USC seemed to say.
"We tried to get more aggres
sive as a team," Perryman ex
plained. "We felt we all needed to
give more and I think it has really
paid off."
Perryman, a junior, certainly
gave her all in a stellar effort
against the Women of Troy,
notching 17 points on 8-of-9 shoot
ing and garnering top praise from
her coach.
"I thought Azella might have
had her best game at Stanford."
said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer.
Perryman's success last week
end is the result of a concerted ef
fort to play a more balanced game
as Stanford heads into the final
stretch.
Perryman. one of the Cardi
nal's formidable post-players, was
called upon to help alleviate pres

sure on the perimeter and be a big
ger presence in the middle after
the losses in Arizona.
"There's bten a big emphasis
on getting the ball inside during
practices," Perryman said. "The
focus has been on the guards get
ting the ball to the posts for more

looks under the basket. That's al
ways fun."
Perryman and her posts cer
tainly had fun this past weekend.
Freshman Kristin Newlin re
turned to the Cardinal lineup
against USC and added nine
points while junior T'Nae Thiel

got in on the action against
UCLA, scoring 10 points of her
own.
More balanced scoring has
been met with a better all-around
game as Stanford has recently
reestablished its defensive
prowess and depth, challenging

those doubts about how far this
team could go.
"I think if we continue to come
out and play strong we can go pret
ty far." Perryman said.
The first test begins today as
the Cardinal faces its first road
game since its disastrous Arizona
spell.
Playing at Oregon's McArthur
court is always an experience and a
half — just ask the men. Though
the Ducks sit at 12-14 overall and
4-12 in conference, that gym is just
spooky, and Stanford will need to
play its game and by its rules.
That includes getting energy
and emotion from everyone —
something Perryman believes is
among her most important contri
butions to the team.
"I'm a big rebounder and ener
gy person," Perryman said. "1
bring fire to the game and I'm not
a big post, but I try to make up for
it with my presence and aggres
siveness."
Perryman certainly seemed
bigger than her size earlier this sea
son against the Oregon schools,
collecting a double-double against
the Ducks with 17 points and 11
boards and just barely missing an
other against Oregon State, grab
bing nine rebounds to go along
with 12 points.
That's exactly the kind of su
percharged emotion and energy
trips to Oregon require — indeed,
the Cardinal's precise and strate
gic game plan is usually best exe
cuted when balanced with that
type of aggression.
"We need to come out and
have another weekend like last
one," Perryman said. "We need to
keep making those statement
games."
There's a lot riding on this
weekend — a top seed in San Jose,
the regular-season title and the
proof that the Stanford team that
takes to the road this weekend is
not the same team that returned to
Palo Alto two weeks ago.
"We've really come together as
a team since the losses," Perryman
said. "I think it was kind of good
for us. Everybody's a little more
focused. We take it one game at a
time, one day at a time and just let
the rest come."
Well, the rest is coming as of
now.
Fortunately, the Cardinal looks
like it might have figured out how
to meet it.

Junior Azella Perryman had one of the best games of her career against USC last weekend. The
Cardinal will need her scoring and rebounding in the post to lead its attack this weekend.
