## Panelists debate treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay Law prof says Bush administration wants to create a 'legal black hole' 
### ANDREW GAY 
Panelists UC-Berkeley Law Prof. John
Yoo, Stanford Law Prof. Jenny Martinez and
attorney George Harris last night discussed
the detainment of more than 600 prisoners
held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba. The event was sponsored by
Bursting the Bubble and the Stanford Inter
national Human Rights Organization.
The prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay
were captured while allegedly fighting for ei
ther Taliban or Al-Qaeda forces. The issue of
whetehr the legal status of these detainees
should be prisoners of war (POW) or "un
lawful combatants" is now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. Because President George
W. Bush has declared the detainees unlawful
combatants, they are currently not being
granted all of the rights guaranteed to POWs
as directed by the dictates of the Geneva
Convention.
George Harris, John Walker Lindh's for
mer attorney, opened the debate by com-

paring his former client's situation to that of
the Guantanamo detainees. Harris said that
when the United States entered into the
conflict on the side of the Northern Al
liance, Taliban soldiers such as Lindh were
declared unlawful combatants by Bush, de
spite not being accused of any war crimes.
Harris said that Bush's blanket decision un
fairly lumps together Taliban and Al-Qaeda
fighters.
Martinez said that in its treatment of the
Guantanamo Bay detainees, "the |Bush| ad
ministration is attempting to create a legal
black hole, a piece of land where there is no
law that can be applied by the federal courts,
and a category of enemy combatants where no
law applies."
She argued that the federal courts should
be able to challenge the status of the detainees
as prisoners of war or as unlawful combatants.
Yoo, who is the former Deputy Assistant
Attorney General in the Office of Legal
Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice,
countered by saying, "There are two types
of detainees: Taliban detainees and Al-
Qaeda detainees. The Al-Qaeda detainees
are not part of a nation-state. The Taliban
detainees were part of units that did not fol
low the laws of war."
Yoo continued by noting that the Geneva
Convention rules apply only to soldiers fight
ing for nations that follow the laws of war.

Bush made the determination that neither the
Taliban nor the Al-Qaeda detainees fit this
description and therefore are not entitled to
P.O.W. status. Yoo also said that in past wars,
either the president or the military deter
mined the status of captured enemy combat
ants. According to Yoo, involving the federal
courts in a military decision would "lawyerize
war" and would not allow our military to pur
sue the nation's best interests.
Martinez said that the complete attempt
by the president to avoid any involvement by
the judiciary and by Congress shows "a re
markable distrust of the other branches of
government. The administration is saying
'We don't trust our Congress and we don't
trust our courts.' "
Yoo maintained that it is the president's
power to interpret treaties such as the
Geneva Convention and to determine our
action in wartime. He said that the attempt
to use the framework of the criminal justice
system in regards to enemy combatants is
like "trying to put a round peg into a square
hole" because that is the duty of the presi
dent and the military.
The first student question focused on the
physical treatment of the Guantanamo Bay
detainees. The panelists agreed that the de
tainees are being kept in humane conditions

that fulfill most of the Geneva Con
vention requirements. Detainees
are held in solitary confinement,
which is a violation of the Geneva
Convention requirements for
POWs. However, detainees are all
provided with food that meets
Muslim dietary laws, medical care
equal to that of the U.S. soldiers
stationed on the base and the op
portunity to worship.
In response to another student
question regarding future U.S. pol
icy towards captured terrorists,
Harris said that all branches of gov
ernment should be engaged in de
veloping this policy, rather than
just the executive branch. Martinez
agreed, stating. "It is too early to
decide, as Bush has, that the feder
al courts have no right fora pres
ence in these hearings."
Yoo said that it is too early to
see what the new U.S. program will
look like but admitted that such a
program was necessary in dealing
with captured terrorists. Martinez
agreed.
"We need to set up a system
based upon legislation with more
safeguards for abuses than the cur
rent system has as set up by the Bush
administration," Martinez said.

In response to another student

Harris said that all branches of gov

decide, as Bush has, that the feder

Yoo said that it is too early to

look like but admitted that such a
program was necessary in dealing
with captured terrorists. Martinez
agreed.
"We need to set up a system
based upon legislation with more
safeguards for abuses than the cur

administration," Martinez said.
Panelists UC-Berkeley Law Prof. John
Yoo, Stanford Law Prof. Jenny Martinez and
attorney George Harris last night discussed
the detainment of more than 600 prisoners
held at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba. The event was sponsored by
Bursting the Bubble and the Stanford Inter
national Human Rights Organization.
The prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay
were captured while allegedly fighting for ei
ther Taliban or Al-Qaeda forces. The issue of
whetehr the legal status of these detainees
should be prisoners of war (POW) or "un
lawful combatants" is now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. Because President George
W. Bush has declared the detainees unlawful
combatants, they are currently not being
granted all of the rights guaranteed to POWs
as directed by the dictates of the Geneva
Convention.
George Harris, John Walker Lindh's for
mer attorney, opened the debate by com-

paring his former client's situation to that of
the Guantanamo detainees. Harris said that
when the United States entered into the
conflict on the side of the Northern Al
liance, Taliban soldiers such as Lindh were
declared unlawful combatants by Bush, de
spite not being accused of any war crimes.
Harris said that Bush's blanket decision un
fairly lumps together Taliban and Al-Qaeda
fighters.
Martinez said that in its treatment of the
Guantanamo Bay detainees, "the |Bush| ad
ministration is attempting to create a legal
black hole, a piece of land where there is no
law that can be applied by the federal courts,
and a category of enemy combatants where no
law applies."
She argued that the federal courts should
be able to challenge the status of the detainees
as prisoners of war or as unlawful combatants.
Yoo, who is the former Deputy Assistant
Attorney General in the Office of Legal
Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice,
countered by saying, "There are two types
of detainees: Taliban detainees and Al-
Qaeda detainees. The Al-Qaeda detainees
are not part of a nation-state. The Taliban
detainees were part of units that did not fol
low the laws of war."
Yoo continued by noting that the Geneva
Convention rules apply only to soldiers fight
ing for nations that follow the laws of war.

Bush made the determination that neither the
Taliban nor the Al-Qaeda detainees fit this
description and therefore are not entitled to
P.O.W. status. Yoo also said that in past wars,
either the president or the military deter
mined the status of captured enemy combat
ants. According to Yoo, involving the federal
courts in a military decision would "lawyerize
war" and would not allow our military to pur
sue the nation's best interests.
Martinez said that the complete attempt
by the president to avoid any involvement by
the judiciary and by Congress shows "a re
markable distrust of the other branches of
government. The administration is saying
'We don't trust our Congress and we don't
trust our courts.' "
Yoo maintained that it is the president's
power to interpret treaties such as the
Geneva Convention and to determine our
action in wartime. He said that the attempt
to use the framework of the criminal justice
system in regards to enemy combatants is
like "trying to put a round peg into a square
hole" because that is the duty of the presi
dent and the military.
The first student question focused on the
physical treatment of the Guantanamo Bay
detainees. The panelists agreed that the de
tainees are being kept in humane conditions
