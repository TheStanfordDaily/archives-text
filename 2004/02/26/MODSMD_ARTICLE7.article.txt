# Prof. McClellan will head CMS
## 
### JULIA SPIEGEL 
Economics and Medicine Assoc. Prof. Mark B. McClellan was named by
President George W. Bush to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) last Friday.
McClellan was an associate professor at Stanford before he went on leave
to head the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However, he is now leav
ing his post at the FDA, which he held for only 16 months, to tackle Medicare
reform. Only one FDA commissioner served a shorter term.
According to some, McClellen worked at the FDA to empower consumers
and ensure rapid access to products that are safe and effective, greatly impact
ing biotechnology and drug industries.
"McClellan set a new tone for the agency by expediting the approval and
review processes, an improvement crucial to public health," said David Golla
her, chief executive of the California Healthcare Institute, a statewide bio
medical industry advocate.
Others were more critical of McClellan's impact at the FDA during his brief
term.
"Dr. McClellan is engaging and smart, but he leaves the FDA with
mediocre accomplishments and with the agency little better off than he found
it," said Dr. Henry Miller, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. McClel
lan's rejection of silicone breast implants for cosmetic use and unwillingness to
permit the Plan B morning-after contraceptive perpetuated the FDA's ten
dency to avoid risk, according to Miller.
Miller also noted that McClellan is beginning his third position in three
years, leaving the FDA without a head overseer, and Miller claimed that FDA
officials who are even more averse to risk during transitions of leadership. It
took over a year and a half to find McClellan for the position, and now the or
ganization must begin the search process again.
"McClellan tried to repeat a failed effort to privatize the Medicare indus
try, which they've been trying to do over the past 15 years," said Dr. Sidney
Wolfe, director of Public Citizen Health Research Group. "If you look at
healthcare as a business and not a service, Mark is the best person for it."
Wolfe faults McClellan's market-driven, pro-privatization attitude and at
tributes it to the tension between being both a physician and an economist.
Wolfe said that McClellan mistakenly views healthcare as a business instead of
a service.
But Dr. Alan M. Garber, director of Stanford's Center for Health Policy,
said he believes that McClellan has a uniquely broad perspective because of his
understanding of clinical concerns, economic factors and medical care data. In
fact, McClellan's research while at Stanford concentrated on the patterns of
care within the Medicare program.
Now at CMS, McClellan will have a greater impact on the medical technol
ogy industry. While the FDA has a budget of a little over one million dollars,
CMS has over $4(X) million. And McClellan has taken on the job of imple
menting the new Medicare bill, a complex and expansive legislation.
"His strength is his ability to work with members of both parties," Garber
said, which will be an important factor in moving the new legislation forward,
an issue that could potentially have serious implications for the upcoming elec
tion in November.
For the biotechnology industry, which has hundreds of experimental drugs
in late-stage testing, having a knowledgeable person at the Medicare and Med
icaid agency could prove very important, according to Gollaher.
" Biotech depends heavily on fast and efficient approval of their products to
survive," said Matt Gardner, president of the Bay Area Bioscience Center.
McClellan's leave from Stanford remains indeterminate.
"We're all wondering when he'll come back," Garber said.
