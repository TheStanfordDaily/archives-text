An immigrant worker from Kenya is suing journalist and former
Knight Fellow Wanja Njuguna-Githinji for human trafficking, which is
defined by the United Nations as the holding of persons against their
will.
Born into poverty, Alice 8., who asked to remain anonymous, left her
daughter and native homeland in Kenya in pursuit of new opportunities.
She claims that she arrived in the United States in 2002 with Njuguna-
Githinji, who promised sufficient pay to support her famiy back in
Kenya.
According to Alice's attorneys, Nancy Harris and Kathleen Kim, Njun
guna-Githinji's promises were empty.
"Alice came to the U.S. with Njuguna-Githinji in the hope of a better
life," Harris said. "Instead she was mistreated by Njuguna-Githinji, who
failed to pay Alice hourly wages that comply with federal minimum-wage
standards."
Kim added, "In addition to hourly wage violations, there is substantial
evidence that our client was a victim of false imprisonment, fraud and in
tentional infliction of emotional distress."
