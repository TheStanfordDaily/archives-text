# Knight Fellow accused of human trafficking
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
An immigrant worker from Kenya is suing journalist and former
Knight Fellow Wanja Njuguna-Githinji for human trafficking, which is
defined by the United Nations as the holding of persons against their
will.
Born into poverty, Alice 8., who asked to remain anonymous, left her
daughter and native homeland in Kenya in pursuit of new opportunities.
She claims that she arrived in the United States in 2002 with Njuguna-
Githinji, who promised sufficient pay to support her famiy back in
Kenya.
According to Alice's attorneys, Nancy Harris and Kathleen Kim, Njun
guna-Githinji's promises were empty.
"Alice came to the U.S. with Njuguna-Githinji in the hope of a better
life," Harris said. "Instead she was mistreated by Njuguna-Githinji, who
failed to pay Alice hourly wages that comply with federal minimum-wage
standards."
Kim added, "In addition to hourly wage violations, there is substantial
evidence that our client was a victim of false imprisonment, fraud and in
tentional infliction of emotional distress."
Although fully aware of her alleged mistreat
ment, Alice refrained from contacting authorities
after she was threatened that she would be de
ported if she spoke to others about her work, Har
ris said.
Human Biology Prof. William Abrams, the de
fendant's attorney, said that these charges are false
and extraneous.
"In my 24 years of practice, I've never heard of
a person accusing someone of peonage and false
imprisonment," Abrams said. "These accusations
are scandalous and outrageous. This case is
smearing the good name of a very respected jour
nalist and a human being."
N}uguna-Githinji attended Stanford fora year
after winning a prestigious Knight Fellowship for
journalism. During that time, she attended
Abrams' death-penalty course.
"I greatly enjoyed working with her and ad
mired her for her work as a journalist and stu
dent," Abrams said "She was very courageous
and outstanding. Next thing I know, she comes to
me in 2003 and says that she is being falsely
charged for mistreating an employee."
Abrams, who was an undergraduate at Stan
ford in the 19705, began his career in law because
it seemed to offer an opportunity to affect change,
he said. He took this case pro bono.
"Alice's attorneys have to provide the facts for
these claims. I ani certain that these accusations
have no merit at all," Abrams said.
However, attorneys Kim and Harris said they
have proof of Alice's mistreatment.
"We have a substantial amount of evidence that
Alice's story is truthful," Harris said. "And we will
demonstrate before a jury that she was poorly
treated and not paid fairly."
Kim, a member of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay area, pro
vides legal assistance to people of color, immi
grants and refugees. She currently is currently
leading the organization's Human Trafficking Pro
ject, and is working on this case as a co-counsel
with Harris, a member of the Orrick, Herrington &
Sutcliffe law firm.
According to U.N. estimates, nearly four mil
lion people are trafficked each year and forced
into labor. In the United States, this figure
reaches over 50,000. To help remedy this prob
lem, several groups around the world and in Cal
ifornia, including the U.N.'s Global Programme
against Trafficking in Human Beings, work to
promote international awareness of the prob
lem, train law enforcement officers and strength
en victim support.
