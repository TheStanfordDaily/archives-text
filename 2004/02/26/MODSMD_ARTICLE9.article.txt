# European constitution likely

### DANDAN WU 
As the scheduled European Union
(E.U.) expansion on May 1 approach
es, former Prime Minister of Belgium
Jean-luc Dehaene, spoke yesterday
afternoon about the prospect of an
E.U. constitution.
Dehaene, one of the most promi
nent politicians in Europe, served as
prime minister of Belgium from 1992
to 1999. He is now vice-chairman of
the E.U. Convention on the Future
of Europe.
In his speech, Dehaene focused on
the need fora constitution and the
major challenges posed by the upcom
ing enlargement — when 10 new
countries, mainly from Central and
Eastern Europe, will join the the exist
ing 15 member countries.
A constitution would bring more
transparency and understanding to
the Union, he said, and it would also

increase Europe's political influence
globally, according to Dehaene.
The question currently before
Dehaene is how the 25 countries can
negotiate at the same table in an effi
cient way.
"A constitution can guarantee
the efficiency of decision-making,"
he said.
Realizing these goals, however,
will not be easy. The key difficulty is
integration, and it is something that
must be achieved over the long term,
he stressed.
"It may not be realized in the first
four or five years, but we have to see
the finality and work to the finality,"
he said.
The E.U. was established in 1957
and first implemented in 1958 with
six founding members, including
Belgium. Over the intervening
decades, it has evolved from a trade
body to a major economic and polit
ical partnership.

Responding to a question about
the constitution's stage in develop
ment, Dehaene said that approxi
mately 90 to 95 percent of the draft
ed constitution has already been ac
cepted by the member nations.
"I think it is necessary to have a
constitution as soon as possible at
least by the end of this year," De
haene said. "Globalization is a reality
and we have to adapt to it in a more
organized way."
Audience members were largely im
pressed with Dehaene's presentation.
"It is a very first-hand view on the
dynamics of bringing consensus es
pecially in the political and govern
mental fields," commented John
Haller, a doctoral candidate in elec
trical engineering.
"The speech was very good and I
am struck that Mr. Prime Minister is
so decided and determined on the
issue," said A. Rowaert, a visitor
from Belgium.
