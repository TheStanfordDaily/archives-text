The Pledge
As the dark clouds of war gather and obscure the sunlit sky of
peace, the response of humanity is twofold: mute acceptance
and compliance with the will of the warmongers, or active and
spirited resistance to their plans and ploys. Today, we see both
reactions in equal measure. Half the world is caught up in the
glamour of 'a war against terrorism' (without recognizing the
underlying cause) and in terrorism itself. The other half
deplores both terrorism and the lack of understanding of its
genesis. They know that changes, on a major scale, alone hold
the key to ending this atrocious evil, and call to the leaders of
nations to recognize and address the inequalities which so
unfairly divide the world. This latter group must grow and
increase their resistance to the plans of those, now in power,
who so threaten the stability of the world. They must find each
other and work together, knowing that they work and speak for
the vast but silent majority who share their longing for peace
and manifested justice.
Peace will only come when justice reigns, when sharing has
opened men's hearts and awakened them to trust. Thus men
must work and speak loudly for justice and sharing which alone
will bring an end to men's suffering, to terrorism and war. We,
your Elder Brothers, are ready to do Our part. We will potentize
all actions taken on behalf of the Common Good. We await the
opportunity to manifest Our strength; to help to right the wrongs
of the past; to show men the uselessness of war. We pledge our
support of all who call for an end to war, for the restoration of
sanity and balance in the affairs of men, for the creation of jus
tice and freedom for all. Help Us to help you. Help Us to do Our
part. We long to act, as always, in the interest of the Common
Good, which, in Our understanding, is the best interests of all
men. Thus it is that We advocate sharing; thus do We advise jus
tice; thus do We see freedom and peace as the culmination of
sharing and justice. Let us work together for the rescue of this
world. Let us abandon differences in the interests of the race. Let
sanity triumph and bring men to see their mutual need for
peace, and the restoration of an ailing world.
Future
Many await the future in dread, fearful that man has lost his way,
that it is now too late to find the path to peace. We counsel oth
erwise. We know that the path to peace is simply found, needing
only the creation of justice and trust. We know that sharing
alone will engender that trust, and bring men to abandon both
terrorism and war. Thus will it be, and thus will men respond to
Maitreya's message of Brotherhood and Justice, free at last from
the glamors of fear and mistrust, ready f o create the future in
deed and in joy.
