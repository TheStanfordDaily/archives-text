So what are you and
your parents going to do
v this weekend?
Very little, 1
hope.
Too much,
for sure.
* I hope
1 got all the shady stufl
112 out of my room. The booze is
H J stashed, the rubbers are gone,
" the weed posters are y
down.
112 You think they
' don't know you drink,
smoke, and bone? Parents
know everyone does all
V that at Stanford, right? /
—■ I don't
see how they wouldn't
know. I mean, we can only make
up so many stories about classes
. and activities before the lies
become obvious.
1 don't
z' know, man. My parents keep
believing that books cost $500 a quarter.
\ I guess those casinos can thank
them for that one. ——
