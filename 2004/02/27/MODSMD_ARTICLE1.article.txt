# Tri Delt placed on suspension
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
At the recommendation of the
Organizational Conduct Board
(OCB), Dean of Students Greg
Boardman has placed the Delta
Delta Delta (Tri Delt) sorority on al
cohol suspension through June 2005
for violating University policy and
California state law for underage al
cohol consumption and hazing.
The charges stem from a Big Sis
ter / Little Sister pledge event held
on May 7. At the event, four fresh
man football players hosted a
"power hour," during which four
sorority pledges drank a shot of beer
every minute for an hour, according
to the police report regarding the in
cident. Five sorority members pur
chased the alcohol.
"Given the nature and magnitude
of these violations, I did give serious
consideration to suspending the
charter of Delta Delta Delta for at
least one year," Boardman said.
"But after factoring in the sorority's
overall positive history at Stanford,
its forthright and cooperative assis
tance in the OCB process and its
commitment to its action steps, I de
cided not to revoke Delta Delta
Delta's charter this time."
Alcohol suspension precludes
the presence of alcohol in the soror
ity house, including individual
rooms. Additionally, alcohol will be
banned from any chapter events —
specifically new member events and
pre-initiation — and at any sorority
sanctioned activity, held at the
house or elsewhere. The sorority
will be unable to co-sponsor any
events with alcohol present, like the
Intersorority Council Formal or par
ties with fraternities.
Tri Delt's hearing with the OCB
— which handles violations commit
ted by student groups — was held on
Feb. 10. In its report to Boardman,
the board recognized the sorority's
"willingness to take ownership of the
events of spring quarter 2003 and the
diligence of their work to address the
shortcomings of the chapter's new
member education program."
The report continued, "Neverthe
less, the seriousness of the lapses in
judgment demands an equally seri
ous response."
When the OCB listed the sorori
ty's violations, it brought special at
tention to the fact that alcohol was
supplied with the intention to permit
abuse of alcohol. In addition, the
sorority members initiated "an event
entirely focused on alcohol, which
had the potential to, and in fact did,
cause bodily harm."
One of the OCB's sanction rec
ommendations was that Tri Delt's
2004 pledge class be reduced in size.
Boardman instead placed Tri-Delt's

new member recruitment program
on a two-year probation through
June 2005.
"Specifically, this means that if
there is another infraction of Uni
versity policy that involves new
member education, the chapter will
be in violation of probation," Board
man said. "In such a case, the OCB
would immediately review the case
and would consider suspension or
termination of the charter, depend
ing on the facts."
The sorority will also be required
to complete 750 total hours of com
munity service by Dec. 10. The OCB
recommended that the hours be ful
filled at the Women's Community
Center and/or Health Promotion
Services at Vaden Student Health
Center on projects related to alcohol
and women's issues.

"Delta Delta Delta accepts the
sanctions placed on the chapter by
the Dean of Students' Office," said
Tri-Delt President Elizabeth Ander
son, a junior, in a press release. "[The
sorority] recognizes the areas for im
provement in its risk management
programming, and as a chapter, Tri-
Delt continues to make positive
changes and modify policies and tra
ditions to ensure the health and safe
ty of its members."
Boardman accepted the sorori
ty's "OCB Response Addendums."
which outlined a series of changes to
Tri Delt's pledge process. In addi
tion to the sorority's new guidelines,
Boardman has stipulated that the
new member classes for spring 2004
