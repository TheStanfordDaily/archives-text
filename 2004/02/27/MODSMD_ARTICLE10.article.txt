## Viennese Baller Stanford alumna sings her heart out 
### NICOLE WRIGHT STAFF WRITER 
Fans pack themselves into the
intimate venues where Stanford
aluma Vienna Teng— enjoys tick
ling the ivories while attending to
the needs of the microphone —
performs. She doesn't neglect her
audience, many of whom make re
turn trips for another sip of her tall
drink-of-water voice. Teng is the
anti-diva, but call her by her first
name anyway, because she has the
showstopper skills to make the
VHI cut. Teng recently released
her album "Warm Strangers" and
played at Borders on University
Avenue this past Tuesday.
"My music is more coffee-and
tea music than beer music," Teng
said.
Teng prefers audiences of 250
people or less. But she could fill up
a venue far larger." Her fame is
growing. She has appeared on Late
Night with David Letterman along
side Simon Cowell. CNN camera
toters trailed her for hours while
making a"Day in the Life" seg
ment. She's been named Tower
Records Artist of the Month twice.
And the local Borders sold out of
her CD.
Teng focuses on how her lyrics
affect others. To some fans, her
songs are aural therapy.
"I got a really moving note from

someone who was being shipped off
to Afghanistan the next day," Teng
said. The fan told her that her music
helped him remember why he was
going and what he was going for.
Teng said that becoming success
ful was a long, circuitous process.
Teng once was a Stanford
premed and played music recre
ationally.
"I wasn't playing any concerts,
but I would play for my dorm mates
at Paloma," Teng said.
After a one-year stint with the
Harmonics, the Stanford a cappella
group, Teng dabbled in everything
from Afro-Cuban music to string
quartets.
After graduation, Teng concen
trated on her engineering career.
"I worked in Silicon Valley at
Cisco Systems as a software engi
neer," Teng said.
After a few years of staring at
computer screens Teng ditched the
steady paycheck and tried the her
luck at a music career.
She knew that she was onto
something when a friend started
crying after hearing her play.
"I was encouraged a lot by
friends and people who had heard
my music and thought 1 was good
enough," Teng said.
"I do remember the moment I
made the promise to myself to be a
musician ... I remember standing
in the middle of the living room one

night and saying, i'm not going to
drift around for years. I'm going to
make the plans to make it happen,'
" she said.
Both her music and program
ming know-how came in handy
when Teng cut her first album right
here on campus, at the Center for
Computer Research in Music and
Acoustics on the Knoll. Then she
plunged into music as Vienna Teng,
a stage name she invented as a pre
teen. Teng freely admits that she
sometimes had her own doubts.
"The hardest part of the start
ing-out period was overcoming all
the moments of discouragement. I
would come home from a studio
session and have a mini-freakout,"
she said.
Although her parents were not
fully supportive of Teng's choice at
first, they gradually accepted her
career choice.
"It's still in the process. My mom
is supportive. My dad is a little more
reticent, 112 A) year after I committed
to music, he bought me some lug
gage. He said I was going to need it
when I went on tour," Teng said.
Teng is not sure if she is an indie
rocker.
"I don't know if I consider my
self indie," Teng said. "[But] I think
the way I pursued my career was
very indie. When I quit my engi
neering job, I had to do self-promo
tion. which I abhor. I didn't have

my own booking agent. But fortu
nately that's past now."
Teng got her big break when she
guest-starred on the National Pub
lic Radio (NPR) show "Weekend
Edition."
"I love NPR. I was kind of curi
ous [to find out] what response I
would get, and I woke up and
checked Amazon.com and I was
number eight."
Teng recently opened for such
marquee names such as Shawn
Colvin and Joan Osbourne, whose
soothing, quiet storm ballads have
influenced Teng's style.
"In high school, I listened a lot to
soft rock, that 'Easy Listening' sta
tion, KOIT. It was all about Celine
Dion and Elton John," Teng said.
Teng now resides in San Francis
co's Mission district. Just like her
new address, her taste has become a
tad edgier.
Teng appreciates the following
she has among Asian Americans in
the area.
One of her earliest musical mo
ments involved her parents singing
to her in Chinese.
"My first memory was singing a
Chinese folk song about jasmine
leaves. Actually, its the hidden
track on this album," Teng said.
Indeed, many of the album's
tracks are more than meets the eye.
For those of you who are looking
for funk. Teng is a-waiting.
