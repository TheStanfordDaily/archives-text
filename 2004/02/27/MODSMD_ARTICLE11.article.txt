						sexiest Stanford man 
### 
We love the Stanford humor magazine. Those jokers, they're
so funny. We just can't wait for it to come out every week.
No, we're not mistaken —The Stanford Review is issued
weekly. Oh, you thought we were talking about the Chap
pie? Wrong. There's a new humor magazine on campus.
If you've paid any attention to the most recent issue of The Review,
you may have noticed that it seems less like "an independently run stu
dent newspaper" and more like a group of conservative males that are
either really great at making jokes or take themselves way too serious
ly. The Review has been in the spotlight before. Earlier this year, con
troversy ensued regarding an article written that accused MEChA, the
Chicano student group, of having racist comments in its charter.
We're not still losing sleep over that issue, but we are interested in

the latest opinions The Review expresses.
Articles entitled "One Man in Defense of
Elitism," "The Penis Dialogues" and the
"Conservative Woman Contest" contra
dict The Review's claim of being non-po
litical (by which we assume they meant
"non-partisan").
These articles express typical sexist, eli
tist, conservative viewpoints to such an ex
treme degree that it must be a joke. At
least we hope it's a joke, and if so, then
Steve Yelderman, watch out — The Re
view's Editor in Chief Stephen Cohen is

coming to take your place as editor in cnief of! ne Manrora cnaparrai.
But if it's not a joke, we're really scared about the shit that's being cir
culated around campus and seen in the Stanford community as repre
sentative of the conservative perspective.
Let's take a look at the evidence.
1) In "One Man in Defense of Elitism," David Stat writes: "Walking
along the beach in Santa Cruz today, observing all the overweight, poor,
and generally unattractive people, it dawned upon me that I truly am su
perior to most everyone else. I mean, just look at me. 1 go to Stanford.
I'm extremely intelligent, I'm in good shape, I'm socially apt and, most
importantly, I'm rich."
Look, we've realized these things about ourselves too, but we don't
write a column about it. We know we have a journalistic responsibility
to address serious, pressing issues in the Stanford community.
Aside from representing conservatives as arrogant, elitist assholes,
the photograph of Stat is also misleading because it suggests that all Re
publicans smoke cigarettes and have rat-tails. (See photo online at
http://www.stanfordreview.org.)
2) Cohen's "The Penis Dialogues," written in response to "The Vagi
na Monologues," states: "The Penis Dialogues will lead college males
all around the country to grab their nut sacks and collectively scream
'My penis is good and so am I.' "
First of all, what could have been a relevant and interesting response
to feminism and V-Week came out as one man's insecurities about his
two-inch penis. Second, if you have to reassure yourself that your penis
is good, it's not.
3) Probably the most shocking piece in the newest issue of The Review
is an advertisement for the "Conservative Woman Contest." It says:"The
Review is holding a competition for the most beautiful conservative
woman. Send an e-mail to contest@stanfordreview.org containing your
name, a photo, your year, & 4 sentences about your political beliefs."
While writing this column, it occurred to us to send in a naked pic
ture, but we couldn't come up with four full sentences about our politi
cal beliefs. Damnit, we could smell the glory. If only they didn't make
this competition so difficult.
This last item got us thinking. We've been given this great opportu
nity to have our opinions widely read by the Stanford community, so
why not exploit it like The Review writers do?
We've organized a competition of our own: The Sexiest Stanford
Male. Send an e-mail to courtaline@hotmail.com containing your name,
a nude photo, your year and four sentences describing why you are so
sexy. The most compelling candidate will be given an opportunity to co
author next week's column with us, among other benefits.
When all is said and done, we applaud The Review for giving us a
new source of humor on campus that is more accessible (i.e. penis jokes)
than some of the Chappie's bizarre inside jokes. (Yelderman claims
that the Chappie doesn't publish inside jokes — he says sometimes
they're just not funny.) We just hope that The Review is actually kidding
and not trying to represent Stanford's conservative community, an al
ready marginalized group on campus.
(Writer's note: Special thanks to whomever donated $1 to the Senior
Gift in each of our names. We're really glad to have been able to support
such a noble cause that we wholeheartedly believe in.)
