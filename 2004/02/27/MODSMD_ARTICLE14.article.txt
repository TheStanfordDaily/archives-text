## Support female faculty members 
### 
Recent research on faculty demographics at
U.S. research universities has confirmed
what is already clear to anyone taking class
es at Stanford: There aren't enough women
faculty members around. This discrepancy is partly
due to outright discrimination and double standards
and partly due to the general hostility that can be pre
sent in the academic environment toward women.
Studies also show that when there are no women role
models, female students' education suffers.
The good news is that Stanford is already proac
tively gathering data about the problem, and pre
liminary results suggest we do not discriminate in
new hires' compensation, laboratory space, equip
ment, startup funds, research funds or summer
salaries. By scrutinizing the recruitment process,
actively recruiting women and adopting a more
family-friendly tenure clock, Stanford has taken a
leadership role in bringing more women into high
er education.
But there's more we can do. For one thing, we can
begin our outreach earlier. Like programs that pro
vide qualified minority or poor applicants with the
infrastructure and encouragement others get to
apply to college, we could start recruiting women fac
ulty earlier in the process. For instance, the Universi
ty could do more to encourage women about to earn
their doctorate to apply for job openings at Stanford.
Another step would be to reform retention prac
tices that implicitly discriminate against women.
Currently, one way to achieve a hefty raise is to so
licit a job offer from another school and then threat
en to leave if your current school doesn't beat the

offer. Women are more likely tied down to their chil
dren's schools or spouses' workplaces, and so can less
credibly threaten to move. Not only does this disad
vantage women directly, but the presence of such a
system discourages women from entering academia
over other careers.
As a third step, departments should look at com
mittee work demands placed on women faculty
members. The laudable goal of representing women
on every committee may mean that the few women in
a department end up doing more than their share of
committee work and thus have less time for the re
search that will earn them tenure. If committees such
as hiring and admission require extra participation
by women, women's other departmental duties
should be reduced accordingly.
Finally, the University should encourage women
graduate students to form women's groups within
their departments where they do not yet exist and to
join such groups where they do. Something as simple
as having biweekly dinners, encouraging each other
women to speak up in class or setting up mentoring
and networking programs with women faculty can
help make an otherwise hostile academic climate far
more friendly toward women.
Justice requires increasing the representation of
women in academic jobs, but it is particularly impor
tant because the absence of role models holds female
students back from other careers as well. Fighting
outright discrimination in hiring and compensation,
while admirable, is not enough. The University can
and should continue to dismantle the structural bar
riers that are pushing women out of academia.
