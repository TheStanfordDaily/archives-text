# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Straight guy for queer ties

You can recognize people
who fervently subscribe to
organized religions by
their superior tolerance for
digesting and regurgitating terrible
arguments. They are often satisfied
with "that's the way it is" as an expla
nation for why some illogical facet of
the status quo has yet to be wholly ex
pelled from the system.
While organized religion typical
ly doesn't promote tolerance in
people, it certainly endows pro-the
ists with hefty capacities for awful
logic. If it weren't so damn destruc
tive. I'd have to respect the amount
of discipline it takes to reach a level
where you can think you know ev
erything without having ever found
out anything.
As a camp counselor for three
summers, I noticed that this tolerance
is not fully developed in children. I re
member how often the children
would question the decisions of the
staff. We all dealt with them different
ly. The lazy, unpopular counselors
would try to strong-arm the poor kids
with punishments like picking up
trash or staring at the sun. It was as
sumed that authority and respect
went hand in hand.
I took a different approach. If a
kid asked "Why?" 1 took the time to
explain. At first, the kids tried to de
bate everything. Only laziness could
have made me alter my method, but it
didn't. After a short while, the
campers obeyed my orders like are-
Ilex. Like rolling your eyes at The
Stanford Review or flipping off cops.
They learned to trust that I was look
ing out for their best interests. The
other counselors, however, suffered
all summer long.
That is the most important lesson
that I learned from those episodes:
A taste for mindless obedience is an
acquired one. From what I have
seen, organized religion is a popular
means to that end. But isn't life easi
er without it? Without mindlessness,
that is.
For example, if it didn't exist, nei
ther would the same-sex marriage
issue. The arguments against it are so
disgracefully poor that your Uncle
Jack and Aunt Todd could have tied
the knot by now with a rainbow wed
ding in Redneckville, Miss., without a
second thought.
The only people in the media who
have been supporting this ridiculous
amendment to the constitution are
unprincipled Republicans salivating
fora wedge issue or conservative
Christian figureheads who base their
disapproval of homosexuality on the
Old Testament, which also says that

we can't eat shellfish. So slow down,
reverends. If we forsake homosexu
als, then for consistency's sake, we

should also have
to kiss crab Ran
goon goodbye. I
don't think you're
ready to do that.
But I don't
want to get into
the Bible right
now. Maybe some
day they'll write
me into Leviticus
fora goof, but

there's no time for that. I want to de
bate the issues.
The argument commonly spewed
out of the gaping mouths of assholes
everywhere is that the government
has a duty to protect the sanctity of
marriage. Who hired them to do that?
I don't think it's a duty, dude.
I actually looked up the definition
of "sanctity" to be sure. From what I
found, it relies on the definitions of ei
ther "holiness" or "sacred." Four out
of the five definitions of "sacred" re
gard religion. That leaves us with a 20
percent chance of having a word in
"sanctity" that the government can
actively defend. That definition is
"respectable, venerable." It sort of
pulls the carpet out from under them
if we force them to start defending the
"respectability" of marriage — in
light of our astronomical divorce rate
and Britney Spears' latest publicity
stunt in Vegas.
Realistically, government-spon
sored marriage is a result of pragmatic
concerns. Religions dictate who you
can marry — like whether your wife is
of the same faith and if you can divorce
or not. Legal marriage exists as an al
ternative to marriage in the church. As
far as the government is concerned, it
doesn't matter if you want to divorce
on a Friday or a Wednesday. It doesn't
matter what the color, creed or sexual
preference of your spouse is—just
the gender. There are economic incen
tives, but that's because marriage is
good for society.
So, it's a practical issue. If you
have no real-world basis for denying
people the opportunity to do some
thing they want to do, you have to let
them do it. It comes down to
whether society benefits equally or
more from committed homosexual
couples who are married than cou
ples who just pretend to be married.
Substantively, there's no difference.
Furthermore, many people who op
pose gay marriages support civil
unions — which lead to an identical
outcome. What kind of controversy
is it really? It's like not being able to

decide between a hamburger and an
upside down hamburger. Can we
just get this over with?
There are other ludicrous argu
ments out there, like the slippery
slope contention. If we allow same
sex marriage, critics say, we shall
have to allow polygamy (marriage
more than one person at a time),
unigamy (marriage to oneself), besti
agamy (marriage to a rhinoceros) or
Nickelodeonygamy (marriage to
Mark Summers). I say, cross those
bridges when we come to them. Be
sides, there are almost no rhinos in
America.
Another poorly constructed argu
ment is that of "the nature of man."
You know, you can't, like, plug the mi
crowave into the toaster. At least with
out something burning, right? Here's
my reply: It is in my nature to insemi
nate every beautiful woman that I pos
sibly can. If you want to write that into
the constitution, be my guest.
I better get started.
I don't support same-sex marriage
out of concern for the rights of homo
sexuals, necessarily. I don't even real
ly think that marriage is what they're
after. But I do think government en
dorsed same-sex marriage could have
a tremendously positive impact on
our society's future.
If same-sex marriages are made
legal once and for all, it will only be a
matter of time before the stigmas re
ally begin to wash away. We'll stop
seeing high-schoolers beaten, killed,
suicidal or afraid to talk to anyone.
Relatives won't have to move from
intolerant regions to Provincetown or
San Francisco. Sons or daughters
won't be ashamed to introduce some
one to mommy and mommy. And
straight people won't feel pressed to
make their straightness explicit, as I
have done compulsively throughout
this column.
In sum, the ill-constructed and er
roneous objections to same-sex mar
riage flake off the scalp of sound rea
soning with the ease of finding porn
on the Internet. I hope to see some of
you religio-bots begin to shake your
heads in revelation.
