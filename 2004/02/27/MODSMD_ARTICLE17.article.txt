## When policy gets outsourced 
### 
Dude, where's my startup?
When I enrolled at Stan
ford in 2000, it seemed
like start-up opportuni
ties — or all jobs for that matter —
were available a dime a dozen. Even
if you were pursuing a degree in
comparative literature, you were a
shoe-in somewhere. But those were
the old days. That year's national
election featured George W. Bush
against A1 Gore and no one really
seemed to care all that much. Amer
ica had gone the way of Stanford —
eternal good weather and general
political apathy.
But now. Stanford and America
have swung the opposite direction.
This year's election is hotly contest
ed, and in dining halls and dorms the
talk has taken a decidedly political
turn (not to mention it has been pour
ing all week). Increasingly, the ques
tions "where's my job" and "who's
my next president?" have come to
occupy the same conversation. We
are in the midst of the notorious "job
less recovery." While stock prices
have risen to some of their old
heights, most of us can't find summer
jobs or — for those of us daunted by
graduation and the end of "summer
vacation" — any job.
Over the past four years, tradi
tional Republican methods have not
created jobs. Bush's high-end tax
breaks should have stimulated the
economy by encouraging the rich to
invest the extra money in their com
panies. These companies, in turn,
would produce and purchase more,
which would create jobs in design.

manufacturing and technical assis
tance — leading to a trickle-down ef
fect. But the resurgence of an old

phenomenon has
been highlighted
by election sea
son: outsourcing.
It turns out that as
companies ex
pand, the new
jobs they create
can be filled over
seas at cheaper
prices. Company
stock prices rise

with increased efficiency and this
powers economic growth. But with
more people out of work and wages
dropping, the situation looks to
Americans more like a quality-of-life
downturn.
This debate has taken center stage
in the Democratic primaries. View
ing it as the major weakness of a po
tentially dominant Bush reelection
campaign. Senators John Kerry and
John Edwards have both focused the
bulk of their recent efforts on the
issue of jobs and job creation. Ed
wards, as the oft-touted son of a mill
worker, has promised blatant protec
tionism. Those manufacturing jobs at
steel mills in Pittsburg and at textile
plants in the south will no longer go
overseas regardless of what we might
have learned about comparative ad
vantage in Prof. Johnson's Econ 1.
Edwards sees this issue as explosive
enough to essentially bet his entire
campaign on it.
For his part, Kerry, who voted for
the North American Free Trade Act

(NAFTA), has been drawn toward
the Edwards position. Kerry has
weakly defended his advocacy of the
bill and has promised voters a 120-
day examination of all U.S. trade
agreements. As Kerry and the Demo
cratic party's free trade policies drift,
their priorities are laid bare: Win at
all costs. If jobs are the issue, then the
Democrats will promise jobs.
Every election descends into
populism, but the Democrats must
remember to protect their integrity
and, consequently, their ability to
win. NAFTA, for example, is one
of the most tangible legacies of the
hugely popular President Bill Clin
ton. Many Americans have real
ized how political unilateralism has
hurt America in the war on terror
ism and in keeping the peace in
Iraq. If Democrats did win the
election and responded with eco
nomic protectionism instead of re
sponsible free trade policy, they
would mirror Republican mistakes
for another four years.
With Bush's trickle-down policies
creating a jobless recovery.
Democrats must ensure that they
don't promise isolationist economics
in order to ensure election. The
world is an increasingly small place
and if we forget this at election time,
we Stanford students may never be
able to start-up in the same way
again.
