# OP-ED
## The 						Deir Yassin massacre is not the cause of the Arab exodus 
### DAVID MEIR-LEVI 
Ammar Nayfeh's recent op-ed in The Stanford Daily
("Advertisement misrepresented historical events in
Palestine," Feb. 24) is a sad miscarriage of historical jus
tice. Unwittingly, or perhaps not, Nayfeh has regurgitat
ed the standard Arab polemic that passes for pseudo-his
tory in his rebuttal of the David Horowitz ad in The Daily
("The Middle East war is not about a Palestinian state or
Palestinian land," Feb. 23). Every paragraph of
Nayfeh's op-ed — indeed, almost every sentence — is
an erroneous misrepresentation of the origins of the
Arab-Israel conflict.
Space does not permit a full and detailed rebuttal of
each error; so 1 will pick the most egregious examples:
1) Nayfeh implies that Theodr Herzl established a
principle of eviction as part of the Zionist endeavor,
but this implication is false. He did, as Nayfeh cor
rectly quotes, muse in his diary about the possible
need to gently relocate, via purchase and employ
ment, some of the local Arabs. So too did Ben Gurion
30 years later. But these private cogitations never be
came Zionist doctrine or strategy. The fact that the
two strongest and most high profile Zionist leaders
over fifty years of Zionist activity never once made
their musings public, nor tried at any time to effectu
ate such a strategy with their Zionist colleagues, is a
clear indication of the degree to which such musings
were an anathema to the Zionist movement and were
completely incongruous with Zionist activity. There is
not a single piece of evidence that these private
thoughts were translated into theoretical or practical
policy. To assert that because Herzl once thought of
relocating local Arabs means that the Zionist move
ment intended to do so is to argue irrationally ex
silentio.
2) Nayef asserts that it was the creation of the Israeli
state that caused the refugee problem. This is false. It is
important to recall that on Nov. 29,1947, the United Na
tions created two states: Israel for the Jews and Palestine
for the Arabs. Had the Arab states accepted the partition
plan, not only would there have been no refugee prob
lem, but there also would have been a state of Palestine
for the past 55 years. It was only the invasion by the Arab
armies that caused the war, and the war led to refugees
on both Arab and Jewish sides.
3) Nayfeh asserts that there were numerous mas
sacres during the 1947-1949 war and that these mas
sacres were intended to frighten Arabs into flight —
hence the 750,000 refugees seeking safety in Lebanon,

Syria, Jordan and the Gaza Strip. Although it is true
that some modern Israeli and Arab historians make
such assertions, there are three ominous factual lacunae
that should give pause before lending credence to the
claim. First, throughout the 40 years of the conflict from
1948 to the mid-1980's, Arab propaganda focused ex
clusively on one putative massacre: Deir Yassin. Had
there been many massacres, why in the world would the
Arab polemic omit mention? Second, once such "mas
sacre" at Tantura, has proven to be totally false. The
graduate student at Haifa University who invented the
"massacre" was forced to make his sources public, and it
became immediately evident that he had fabricated
some facts and prompted survivor witnesses for the rest
of the evidence he used to document the "massacre."
We cannot yet know how many other such "massacres"
were fabricated in the same way. Third, the poster child
massacre of the 1948 war was also, in part, a fabrication
of ex-post facto Arab propaganda. So let's turn now to
Deir Yassin.
4) Deir Yassin is used relentlessly by Arab polemi
cists to explain why 750,000 Arabs fled the war zone.
According to the Arab account, aptly summarized by
Nayfeh, the Jewish para-military force (Etzel) affect
ed the systematic murder of innocent civilians in a
quiet, non-militarized and inconsequential Arab vil
lage in order to terrify the Arab population far and
wide. While what really happened at Deir Yassin may
never be known, there are a number of facts — attest
ed to by the Arab polemicists themselves — which
cast light on the nature, motivation and outcome of
the attack.
A) The battle at Deir Yassin occurred on April 9,
1948. Before that date, more than 300,000 (by Arab
reckoning) Arabs had fled from the Galilee and north
ern coastal plain into Lebanon and Syria. The cause and
effect here is clear. It is unlikely that Deir Yassin was
the cause of the flight of almost half of the total
refugees. The battle occurred six months after the flight
began.
B) The Arab village that was the site of the massacre
overlooked the one road from Jewish Palestine to
Jerusalem. Arab control of that road would mean the
starvation and death of 150,000 Jews living in Jerusalem.
When Iraqi troops entered the village on March 13,1948,
their purpose was clear — and the village became a le
gitimate military target in the battle for Jerusalem. One
source indicates that the Iraqis were asked to leave the
village. However, there is no indication that they did
leave and armed soldiers were in the village when Etzel

troops entered.
C) When the Etzel troops entered the village, they
mounted a loud speaker on a jeep to warn civilians of their
entry. The troops did not block off the several roads that of
fered egress. It is irrational to suggest that the intent of the
battle, therefore, was massacre. No one announces military
entry and then lets the masses flee if one intends to massacre
the masses. The attack on Deir Yassin was a military oper
ation intended to secure the village, eject the Iraqis and
keep the road to Jerusalem open.
D) Based on a variety of sources including first-hand
witness accounts, the Iraqi soldiers dressed as women
and hid among women and children in private homes in
the village. Thus, when the Iraqis opened fire on the
Etzel troops, the latter killed innocent women and chil
dren in the cross fire. According to international law, the
full onus of culpability for the tragic deaths of these in
nocents rests solely upon the Iraqis and their craven tac
tic of using human shields. These dead civilians do not
constitute a massacre.
E) There were about 17 Arabs who were lined up
against a wall and shot. Their corpses were thrown into a
nearby quarry. These may indeed have been victims of
massacre. However, several accounts indicate that once
the Iraqis had surrendered and were herded into the vil
lage square, some Iraqis had weapons hidden under their
ample female robes. They opened fire upon the Etzel
troops. The latter fired back, killing more innocents in
the crossfire. Some or all of the 17 assassinated Arabs
may have been these erstwhile prisoners who opened fire
after surrendering.
F) When news of the battle reached the Arab
high command, the spokesperson in East Jerusalem
began to broadcast on Arab radio a largely fictional
ized account of horrendous atrocities, including
gang rape of women, the disemboweling of pregnant
women and the murder of their unborn children.
Deir Yassin survivors are on record, even on TV,
stating that no such atrocities ever occurred. When
they intervened with the spokesperson, insisting that
he was doing the Arabs a disservice by manufactur
ing atrocities, his response was: "We must capitalize
upon this event, so that other Arab nations will be
shamed into sending their armies and liberating us."
It is, therefore, clear, that to whatever degree Deir
Yassin may have been a motivator in Arab flight, it
was not the events of Deir Yassin that caused panic.
Rather, it was the lies invented by Arab leadership
about Deir Yassin that caused panic. One can hard
ly blame Etzel for that.

G) Yasir Arafat, in his authorized biography,
states unhesitatingly that the Arab leaders waved the
Deir Yassin incident in front of the Palestinians like " .
.. a red flag before a bull. They [the Arab leaders] ter
rorized us."
So, in sum. while we cannot know all the details,
there certainly was much tragic innocent deaths and
there may have been some unjustified assassinations as
well — it is clear that there was no intent to massacre.
Instead, Deir Yassin was a legitimate military objec
tive, much of the tragic civilian death was caused by
Iraqi tactics and Deir Yassin was not at cause for the
flight of the 300,000 Arabs who left between August
and April 1947, nor was it the cause for those who fled
afterwards.
5) Arafat, in the same biography, also tells us that the
flight of untold thousands of Arabs from the south of Is
rael was because:"... they came into our villages at night,
forced us out at gun-point, killed our leaders, took our
weapons, and marched us into concentration camps."
Who did this? The Egyptians. That is how, according to
Arafat, the Gaza strip got its 300,000 refugees. Why the
Egyptians did this is beyond the scope of this essay — but
they did it, not the Israelis.
6) Finally, there was never any intent on the part of
the Israelis to ethnically cleanse Palestine of Arabs. Dur
ing the Rhodes Armistice talks, the Israeli representa
tives offered to return all of the land that they had con
quered in the war — the land that the UN partition plan
had allocated for the state of Palestine. All that the Is
raelis demanded in return was recognition, negotiations
and peace. In that scenario, hundreds of thousands of
refugees could have come back to their homes. The Arab
states refused. It is irrational to assert that Israel planned
on driving out all the Arabs when in fact they offered to
let the refugees back in.
In conclusion, every one of Nayfeh's assertions ap
pears to be historically incorrect. They are the product
of revisionist polemic pseudo-history that has created
the un-historical framework needed to justify a 55-year
siege of Israel. The great tragedy for the Arabs of the
area is that so many have come to believe the lies and to
refuse the offer of peace that Israel has re-iterated many
times over. Peace begins with trust. Trust begins with
truth. It is time to abolish the Arab diatribe and speak
truthfully about what happened then, and what is hap
pening now.
