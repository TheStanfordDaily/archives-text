# KASA celebrates Korean culture

### NANCY WANG 
The Korean American Students
Association (KASA) will be holding
its annual Culture Night, from 8:30 to
10 p.m. tonight at Lakeside Dining.
The event features speakers such as
national bestselling author Helie Lee
and comedian Paul Kim, as well as
performances by Stanford Hwimori
and Stanford Tae Kwon Do.
Organizers see Culture Night as
an important way for the Stanford
Korean-American population to
share with the Stanford community
as a whole. In addition to celebrating
Korean-American heritage and cul
ture through entertainment and
food, the event also aims to uncover
deeper issues that face Korean
Americans.
"We also use culture night as a

tool for Korean-American activism
— to dispel stereotypes, discuss im
portant issues and promote unity,"
said sophomore Alex Choo, KASA
social chair.
Event organizers said they hope
to attract students from the entire
Stanford community. They added
that culture night is free to the public
and offers something for everyone
— the night includes literary discus
sion, free Korean barbeque served
at 8 p.m. and performances by on
campus groups.
For the literary enthusiasts, the
main speaker Helie Lee is one of the
most noted Korean-American au
thors. Lee is also a North Korean
human rights activist and lectures
around the country on her bicultural
heritage. She has been featured on
shows such as Nightline, CNN and

Oprah for her memoir, "In the Ab
sence of Sun: A Korean American
Woman's Promise to Reunite Three
Lost Generations of Her Family"
(2002). Lee will be signing her best
selling novel "Still Life with Rice"
(19%).
Stand-up comedian Paul Kim,
founder of the Korean talent show
Kollaboration, will also be per
forming for the crowd tonight.
Kim hosts the comedy show
"Asian Invasian" at the Laugh
Factory in Hollywood.
Freshman Jay Huang noted that
this will be a good opportunity for
Stanford students to unwind from
midterms and have fun, and learn.
"It's great that everyone can go
take a break and have some fun and
at the same time learn about the Ko
rean culture and the issues facing

Korean Americans," he said. Choo
said he hopes that Culture Night will
help dismiss the misconception of
Korean Americans — and Asian
Americans in general — as model
minorities.
"1 think there is a perception
among non-Koreans and non-
Asians that we're all doctors and
lawyers and that we like to distance
ourselves from other minorities,"
he said. "We would like people to
leave Culture Night understanding
that Korean Americans struggle
against racism and discrimination
and hardship just like other mar
ginalized groups. Also, we want
people to look to the future and
have a good feeling about the con
tributions Korean Americans have
been making and will make to
American society."
