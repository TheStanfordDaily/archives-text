rounding community and all parents here for Parents' Weekend.
Plus we send out over 500 invitations to local Tri Delt alumnae."
Items to be auctioned include a basketball signed by the entire
men's basketball team, two plane tickets, two Giants tickets, jew
elry and gift certificates to local restaurants and businesses. Also
included in the auction are some student-donated items, such as
a Fleet Street serenade, Wind Ensemble tickets, dinner cooked
by Sigma Nus and private tennis lessons from a Tri delt.
"Two Sigma Nus will cook a dinner for four, serve it and then
clean-up the kitchen," said Pablo Abad-Manterola, Sigma Nu

All of Tri Delt's philanthropy events benefit children's cancer
charities.
"We have paired up with the Children's Hospital for the past
16 years to raise money for them through the charity auction,"
Geehr said. Tri Delt also hosts Penny Wars during fall quarter to
