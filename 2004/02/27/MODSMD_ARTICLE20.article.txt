## Aaron Levine is just living the Dream 
### 
Winter quarter finals are 18 days
away, absolutely no one can
beat the men's basketball team
and some pro baseball players
might have taken some steroids, but I can't
imagine anything more exciting than Aaron
Levine's life for the next few weeks.
Frat boy extraordinaire, Stanford Daily
staffer, KZSU sports broadcaster and
diehard women's volleyball fan, lucky,
lucky, superlucky Aaron is having his face
broadcast all over national television as he
competes fora sportscasting contract (ooh,
ooh, and a new Mazda) on ESPN's "Dream
Job", the latest in completely unrealistic but
catchy "reality" TV.
Sure, sure. Tell yourself you too are spe
cial and successful at Stanford, even if
you're not on TV. Hey, we're all special
here, but we're not all partying in New York
and making weekly appearances on ESPN
like Mr. Levine is right at this moment.

But I know Aaron, you
say. He tried to dance
with me at a frat party
three years ago. What
makes him so special all
of a sudden? I mean, I did
receive the "Who's Who
Among High School Stu
dents" nomination in
2000, after all.
Hey, we can all have our

own individual systems of who's successful
and special and who's not, and that's great.
But I don't care how great of an honor your
Peace Corps mission in Azerbaijan is, be
cause in my opinion, if you're not on televi
sion, it's just not quite as special.
People have been telling me my whole
life that it doesn't matter what kind of
recognition you get, it's who you are on the
inside. And I've tried to buy into it, 1 swear.
Bullshit, I tell you.
Recognition matters and national televi
sion is a big way to get recognized.
Television dictates who's on top and
who is being ignored, which is exactly why
Teyo Johnson is an important athlete, and
whoever has the 100-meter breaststroke
women's record isn't. Or why Aaron
Levine is in the spotlight now, and the pres
ident of Kappa Sig three years ago isn't.
(Freshmen at this point are asking: What's
Kappa Sig, Julie? Oh, the frat house next to
Theta Delt.)
I'm not arguing a specifically causal rela
tionship here between TV exposure and
success. It's mutual reciprocity: Sports that
are more popular get more media space, get
more TV time, become more popular, and
so forth. The NFL gets airtime, rhythmic
gymnastics not so much.
I am also not saying that getting on TV is
always an honor. I do not consider appear
ances on Fear Factor, Real World vs. Road
Rules, Fox News, E!, Skinemax, and Or.
Phil markers of success, although plenty of
people in Middle America might disagree.
So while I plod through my winter
quarter classes, people I ate with in the
dining halls have been teleported to the
NFL, Jared Cohen got a Rhodes scholar
ship, one girl I did drama with in high
school just sold her screenplay to Magic
Johnson and the other is a regular on One
Tree Hill. At least it's not the 0.C., be
cause then I would be really jealous. And
now, Aaron Levine is flashing his bright
smile at me on Sunday nights.
Some people might be feeling bitter.
That's okay, you can be a promising young
Stanfordite and still feel bitter. That's what
makes us competitive anyway. But let's at
least give props where they're deserved.
Aaron Levine has landed himself a very
special place on Sunday night television.
Sure, anyone can eat hissing cockroaches
or be a Fifth Wheel. And while "Dream
Job" has a remarkably repetitive set-up in
the genre of played-out reality TV, com
plete with four supposedly hard-ass judges
and a nondescript set with some nice light
ing. you actually need to be good at some
thing to be on it. The contestants arc funny,
you get to see them all nervous and excited,
and a couple of them absolutely kick ass.
Based on Sunday's performance, Aaron
kicks ass. He tackled the hour with that
glint in his eyes, that ferocious and calm "I
am going to win" glint that most of us imag
ine we too have.
Guess what, we don't all have it, and if
you did once, you might have lost it. Aaron
is getting his, and I can't imagine anything
more exciting. Lucky him, they came out
with a reality show (I know, I know, like "re
alistically" anyone gets to compete on TV
for their Dream Job) that fit his description.
The guy loves sports.
So while we return to our problem sets,
course readers, and Wednesday night New
lyweds / O.C. sprees, let's try not to confuse
"getting your work done" with "waiting for
good things to fall into your lap." Nothing
good actually falls into your lap, unless it's a
cute girl, but that would be a chauvinistic
comment, now, wouldn't it.

lucky, superlucky Aaron is having his face
broadcast all over national television as he
competes fora sportscasting contract (ooh,
ooh, and a new Mazda) on ESPN's "Dream
Job", the latest in completely unrealistic but
catchy "reality" TV.
Sure, sure. Tell yourself you too are spe
cial and successful at Stanford, even if
you're not on TV. Hey, we're all special
here, but we're not all partying in New York
and making weekly appearances on ESPN
like Mr. Levine is right at this moment.

But I know Aaron, you
say. He tried to dance
with me at a frat party
three years ago. What
makes him so special all
of a sudden? I mean, I did
receive the "Who's Who
Among High School Stu
dents" nomination in
2000, after all.
Hey, we can all have our

own individual systems of who's successful
and special and who's not, and that's great.
But I don't care how great of an honor your
Peace Corps mission in Azerbaijan is, be
cause in my opinion, if you're not on televi
sion, it's just not quite as special.
People have been telling me my whole
life that it doesn't matter what kind of
recognition you get, it's who you are on the
inside. And I've tried to buy into it, 1 swear.
Bullshit, I tell you.
Recognition matters and national televi
sion is a big way to get recognized.
Television dictates who's on top and
who is being ignored, which is exactly why
Teyo Johnson is an important athlete, and
whoever has the 100-meter breaststroke
women's record isn't. Or why Aaron
Levine is in the spotlight now, and the pres
ident of Kappa Sig three years ago isn't.
(Freshmen at this point are asking: What's
Kappa Sig, Julie? Oh, the frat house next to
Theta Delt.)
I'm not arguing a specifically causal rela
tionship here between TV exposure and
success. It's mutual reciprocity: Sports that
are more popular get more media space, get
more TV time, become more popular, and
so forth. The NFL gets airtime, rhythmic
gymnastics not so much.
I am also not saying that getting on TV is
always an honor. I do not consider appear
ances on Fear Factor, Real World vs. Road
Rules, Fox News, E!, Skinemax, and Or.
Phil markers of success, although plenty of
people in Middle America might disagree.
So while I plod through my winter
quarter classes, people I ate with in the
dining halls have been teleported to the
NFL, Jared Cohen got a Rhodes scholar
ship, one girl I did drama with in high
school just sold her screenplay to Magic
Johnson and the other is a regular on One
Tree Hill. At least it's not the 0.C., be
cause then I would be really jealous. And
now, Aaron Levine is flashing his bright
smile at me on Sunday nights.
Some people might be feeling bitter.
That's okay, you can be a promising young
Stanfordite and still feel bitter. That's what
makes us competitive anyway. But let's at
least give props where they're deserved.
Aaron Levine has landed himself a very
special place on Sunday night television.
Sure, anyone can eat hissing cockroaches
or be a Fifth Wheel. And while "Dream
Job" has a remarkably repetitive set-up in
the genre of played-out reality TV, com
plete with four supposedly hard-ass judges
and a nondescript set with some nice light
ing. you actually need to be good at some
thing to be on it. The contestants arc funny,
you get to see them all nervous and excited,
and a couple of them absolutely kick ass.
Based on Sunday's performance, Aaron
kicks ass. He tackled the hour with that
glint in his eyes, that ferocious and calm "I
am going to win" glint that most of us imag
ine we too have.
Guess what, we don't all have it, and if
you did once, you might have lost it. Aaron
is getting his, and I can't imagine anything
more exciting. Lucky him, they came out
with a reality show (I know, I know, like "re
alistically" anyone gets to compete on TV
for their Dream Job) that fit his description.
The guy loves sports.
So while we return to our problem sets,
course readers, and Wednesday night New
lyweds / O.C. sprees, let's try not to confuse
"getting your work done" with "waiting for
good things to fall into your lap." Nothing
good actually falls into your lap, unless it's a
cute girl, but that would be a chauvinistic
comment, now, wouldn't it.

Winter quarter finals are 18 days
away, absolutely no one can
beat the men's basketball team
and some pro baseball players
might have taken some steroids, but I can't
imagine anything more exciting than Aaron
Levine's life for the next few weeks.
