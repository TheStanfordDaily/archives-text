# Men roll past OSU, 73-47

Oregon State did little to improve its Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament hopes last night at
Maples Pavilion, losing 73-47, as No. 1 Stanford
(24-0,15-0 Pac-10) treated the Beavers as if they
were a dominating Pac-10 team, actually capa
ble of challenging elite conference squads like
Stanford and Arizona.
OK, bad example.
Coming off its 90-84 upset over the then-No,
14 Wildcats, Oregon State (11-14, 5-10) was
hoping to put together a string of four consecu
tive conference wins the hard way.
And, in truth, in past years, Stanford
wouldn't have taken this particular game very
seriously. Last season, this was exactly the type
of opponent that Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery worried about the most — a team
playing in survival mode.
However, this time around, with the Pac
-10 title already secured, the Cardinal showed
no signs mental letdown — not even an
inkling of complacency against a team that is
fighting for the eighth and final spot into the
conference tournament.
"After accomplishing our first goal, which
was to win a Pac-10 title, we set another g0a1...
to go undefeated in the regular season," junior
swingman Josh Childress explained.
And it wasn't even close — never, ever even
the slightest bit close.
When freshman point guard Mark Bradford
banked in a 3-point shot from the top of the key
with 12.8 seconds remaining, no one in the
building was all too surprised.
It was just that kind of night for the Cardi
nal, which improved its undefeated streak to

24 consecutive wins with an easy victory over
the Beavers.
Stanford was relentless last night — poised
and yet emotional, its on-court demeanor as se
rious as it has looked all season long.
"We wanted to step in and play | well] against
a team that had some momentum [coming in],"
said sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez,
who led all Stanford scorers with 13 points. "I
think tonight, overall, we had a killer instinct..
. [We] set a tone."
And Stanford certainly did set the tone de
fensively, holding the Beavers to 8-of-28 shoot
ing from the field in the first half.
The Cardinal opened the game on a 32-16
run that ended when Childress hit a three
pointer from the baseline that rattled around
the rim and hit the backboard before going in.
He finished with 12 points (all of which came
in the first half) and five assists in 25 minutes
of play.
The last time that Stanford faced Oregon
State, in Corvallis on Jan. 29, the game could
have been a disastrous turning point for the
Cardinal. When senior Justin Davis went down
with an injury to his left knee early in the second
half, Stanford could have folded.
But four weeks ago, the Cardinal figured out
a way to beat the Beavers and then turned
around two days later and mustered enough en
ergy to change a 19-point deficit in the second
half at Oregon into a three-point, come-from
behind win.
And last night, with the Beavers in town,
Davis's injury, once again, took center stage.
Yesterday before the matchup, an MRI on
Davis's knee revealed that he was not com-

Senior Matt Lottich goes up and over a stunned Oregon State defenseman last night for
two of his seven points. The Cardinal mounted a massive defensive attack at Maples Pavil
ion that shut down the Beavers and gave Stanford its school-record 24th straight win.
