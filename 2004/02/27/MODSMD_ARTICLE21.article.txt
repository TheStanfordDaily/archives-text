# Men roll past OSU, 73-47

### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Oregon State did little to improve its Pacific
-10 Conference Tournament hopes last night at
Maples Pavilion, losing 73-47, as No. 1 Stanford
(24-0,15-0 Pac-10) treated the Beavers as if they
were a dominating Pac-10 team, actually capa
ble of challenging elite conference squads like
Stanford and Arizona.
OK, bad example.
Coming off its 90-84 upset over the then-No,
14 Wildcats, Oregon State (11-14, 5-10) was
hoping to put together a string of four consecu
tive conference wins the hard way.
And, in truth, in past years, Stanford
wouldn't have taken this particular game very
seriously. Last season, this was exactly the type
of opponent that Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery worried about the most — a team
playing in survival mode.
However, this time around, with the Pac
-10 title already secured, the Cardinal showed
no signs mental letdown — not even an
inkling of complacency against a team that is
fighting for the eighth and final spot into the
conference tournament.
"After accomplishing our first goal, which
was to win a Pac-10 title, we set another g0a1...
to go undefeated in the regular season," junior
swingman Josh Childress explained.
And it wasn't even close — never, ever even
the slightest bit close.
When freshman point guard Mark Bradford
banked in a 3-point shot from the top of the key
with 12.8 seconds remaining, no one in the
building was all too surprised.
It was just that kind of night for the Cardi
nal, which improved its undefeated streak to

24 consecutive wins with an easy victory over
the Beavers.
Stanford was relentless last night — poised
and yet emotional, its on-court demeanor as se
rious as it has looked all season long.
"We wanted to step in and play | well] against
a team that had some momentum [coming in],"
said sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez,
who led all Stanford scorers with 13 points. "I
think tonight, overall, we had a killer instinct..
. [We] set a tone."
And Stanford certainly did set the tone de
fensively, holding the Beavers to 8-of-28 shoot
ing from the field in the first half.
The Cardinal opened the game on a 32-16
run that ended when Childress hit a three
pointer from the baseline that rattled around
the rim and hit the backboard before going in.
He finished with 12 points (all of which came
in the first half) and five assists in 25 minutes
of play.
The last time that Stanford faced Oregon
State, in Corvallis on Jan. 29, the game could
have been a disastrous turning point for the
Cardinal. When senior Justin Davis went down
with an injury to his left knee early in the second
half, Stanford could have folded.
But four weeks ago, the Cardinal figured out
a way to beat the Beavers and then turned
around two days later and mustered enough en
ergy to change a 19-point deficit in the second
half at Oregon into a three-point, come-from
behind win.
And last night, with the Beavers in town,
Davis's injury, once again, took center stage.
Yesterday before the matchup, an MRI on
Davis's knee revealed that he was not com-

pletely healed and Montgomery's hopes that Davis would return
next week in Washington were dashed.
The MRI showed that the knee bone is still bruised, but he re
mains optimistic about his ability to play through the pain once he re
turns to the court.
"You can definitely play with a little bone bruise — a little boo
boo," Davis joked.
Davis now hopes to return for the conference tournament, which
takes place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on March 11-13.
"The obvious thing is you can't take a kid out of five weeks of in
activity and throw him out on the court." said Montgomery in Tues
day's press conference. "He needs to get some confidence in his knee,
make some mistakes and go through the whole process. You run the
risk of him wanting to be the player he was before he got hurt, and
that's just not going to happen overnight. We have to work him back
into the lineup."
With D-ivis' return put on hold for the time being, and Stanford
holding onto its 16-point halftime lead for the second half s opening
minutes, Montgomery began to sub. Sophomore point guard Jason
Haas hit a long 2-pointer with 12:23 left to play and a few minutes
later, Stanford reserves began to flood the court.
With eight minutes remaining, not a single Stanford starter was
left on the floor. Freshman swingman Fred Washington hit a 3-point
er at the three-minute mark, extending the Cardinal's lead to 22 (its
largest lead of the game). Washington scored a career-high 11 points
in 13 minutes of play off 4 of-5 shooting from the field.
"We're trying to get some guys some confidence [going into the
tournament]," Montgomery said of all the subbing. "I just think it's
healthy for your locker room if everyone gets a chance to play mean
ingful minutes."
Stanford, of course, wasn't without its faults. There were momen
tary stretches when the Cardinal looked out of rhythm offensively,
turning the ball over 19 times against little defensive pressure and
Oregon State outrebounded Stanford 35-31 — the second time this
season that the undersized Beavers have achieved that rare feat.
"We're not going to have Justin for awhile [so] we have to figure
out how to rebound with this lineup," Montgomery said.
But the Beavers couldn't capitalize despite their edge on the
boards, failing to piece together a single nin and never challenging.
Stanford will face unranked Oregon at 4 p.m. on Saturday at Maples.
Tipoff is scheduled for 4 p.m. and the game will be broadcast on ABC.
