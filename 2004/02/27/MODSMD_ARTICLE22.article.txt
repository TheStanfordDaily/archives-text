# Despite easy win over Beavers, Card keeps energy turned up
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
You're the top-ranked team in
the country, it's a Thursday night
and you're ready fora game of bas
ketball on your home court. You
haven't played in five days, you
haven't played at home in 19 days,
and you're fired up — but your op
ponent doesn't show up to play.
What do you do? You play
against yourselves.
No, Stanford wasn't forced to
hold an intra-squad scrimmage in
front of 7,391 fans at Maples Pavilion
last night. But the only real challenge
it faced in its 73-47 tune-up over a
lackluster Oregon State squad came
from its own high standards of per
formance.
"I don't think we're going to go
into the film room and have [head
coach Mike Montgomery] tell us we
looked good," said sophomore point
guard Chris Hernandez, whose

three early 3-pointers helped put the
game out of reach within the first 12
minutes. "I don't think he's happy
with our execution overall."
That would be because Stan
ford committed 19 turnovers — a
level of sloppiness it might not be
able to afford against tougher op
ponents. Several of the miscues
had little to do with any tough de
fense by the Beavers — the Cardi
nal players just threw the ball over
each other's heads.
"We were a little sloppy offen
sively, obviously," Montgomery
said. "We made some uncharacteris
tic plays."
Many of the mistakes stemmed
from sheer exuberance. Hernan
dez said he got so pumped up over
the team's stellar defensive play
that he simply threw passes too
hard on offense.
"I had too much energy," he said.
"I was a little out of control, and I
had four turnovers."

Often an un
derdog team will
hope to compen
sate for its defi
ciencies by work
ing harder and
expending more
energy on de-

fense. But last night, it was the
heavily favored Cardinal that
played with visibly more enthusi
asm than its opponent.
"When we've been gtxxi, all sea
son long it's been because of defen
sive energy," Montgomery said. "I
really think [our players] just were
geared up to play tonight, and they
got after it pretty well."
Their defensive intensity
throughout the game gave no hint
that they were trouncing the
Beavers on the scoreboard. Ignoring
the fact that Oregon State's shooters
couldn't hit anything, Stanford's de
fenders hustled on each possession
as though they were trying to claw

their way to a tough victory.
They didn't have to play that
hard to win, but the Cardinal's
players were playing to get better,
to keep their momentum, to make
a statement.
"I think tonight, overall, we real
ly wanted to come out and just de
fensively have a presence and set a
tone," Hernandez said. "We defi
nitely are going to need that instinct
going into some tough games and
the [Pacific-10 Conference and
NCAA] tournaments."
Hernandez's comments hinted
that Stanford treated the game as an
opportunity to show improvement
at a time when the team hopes to ap

proach its peak performance.
"I think we're starting to reach
that peak defensively," Childress
said after the game. "We were just
the aggressor all night. We really lim
ited their open looks and got into
their heads all night."
Indeed, it's tough to argue
with a defensive effort that result
ed in Oregon State's lowest point
total of the year. But Stanford be
lieves it still has work to do on the
offensive end.
"We're still working to peak of
fensively, and with Justin coming
back soon, we're going to try to work
him in and make it as seamless as
possible," Childress said.
