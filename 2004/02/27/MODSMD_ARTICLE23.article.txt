# Oregon rallies, upsets women
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
For the past two seasons, when the No. 10 Stanford
women's basketball team (20-6,13-4 Pacific-10 Conference)
has visited McCarthur Court to face Oregon nothing but
drama has ensued.
Last year, the Cardinal escaped from McCarthur Court
with a 75-74 victory over Oregon on two free throws by then
junior Nicole Powell after a 75-foot inbounds pass from
T'Nae Thiel.
Last night, however, the Ducks (13-14,5-12) pulled an
absolute shocker — defeating the Cardinal 67-66 on a
layup by junior guard Corrie Mizusawa with 8.6 seconds
on the clock.
Stanford looked to have the game in hand, after going up by
five points when freshman center Kristen Newlin converted
one of two free throws with 36 seconds on the clock.
But the last 36 seconds absolutely belonged to Mizusawa.
After Newlin missed the second free throw, junior guard
Sebnem Kimyacioglu looked to have an offensive rebound in
hand, but Misuzawa somehow got possession and was able to
call a timeout for Oregon.
On the subsequent Duck possession, Misuzawa took the ball
to the hole and somehow got an acrobatic 10-foot jumper to go
down, while drawing a foul on junior guard Kelley Suminski.
And while she missed the free throw, Misuzawa went after
the rebound and drew a loose ball foul on Suminski, her fifth —
sending the Cardinal junior to the bench.
Misuzawa sunk the next two free throws, pulling Oregon
within one with 20.6 seconds to go.
The Ducks had no choice but to foul and the Cardinal got
the ball into the hands of exactly the right person — their Ail-
American, cool-as-a-cucumber, fearless-under-pressure, 88.9
percent free-throw-shooting senior forward Nicole Powell.
But with the crowd on its feet making all the the noise it
could possibly make, Powell failed to convert, rimming out the
front end of her one-and-one.
It was again Misuzawa to the rescue, coolly taking the ball
the length of the floor and converting the final layup.
With 8.6 seconds left on the clock, the Cardinal attempted to
recreate last year's scene, getting the ball inbounds to Powell,
who took the ball the length of the court and drew some contact

on the final shot, but could not get the call
and was forced to throw up a desperation
air ball as the clock wound down.
"For us it's very disappointing to be in
the situation that we think we are in and
then not be able to step up and make big
plays down the stretch." said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
And while Stanford seemed to fall
apart in the final minute, it was actually
the first four minutes of the game — the
Ducks didn't miss a single shot and were
able to build a 10-point lead — that Van-
Derveer felt made the difference.
"I think we really got in trouble right
at the beginning of the game," said Van-
Derveer. "They really got their confi
dence up. [They had| eight threes in the
first half. Our defense was really passive
... this game obviously meant a lot to
their team."
And while Oregon had a hot start, the
Cardinal worked its way back into the
game with a fair amount of ease. Sumins
ki got hot, hitting three of her first four
shots — all threes — and within six min
utes the Cardinal had turned a 10-point
deficit into a six-point lead.
But having to overcome such a deficit
just might have taken a little too much out
of the Cardinal.
"We didn't come out with the intensi
ty that we needed to come out with. We

weren't the aggressors," Suminski said. "We had to come hack
from starting so slowly. Every minute of the game is important
and you can't waste any time, you really have to play your best
game every minute."
And it didn't seem that Suminski wasted any time — finish
ing with a game-high 19 points while adding five rebounds and
three assists in 39 minutes — VanDerveer questioned the de
sire and heart of some of her players.
"I think it's a disappointing loss," she said. "I wish it was
more painful... ITiere's not that competitive fire there for 40

minutes that this level demands."
VanDerveer alluded to a change in her starting lineup after
being unhappy with the way the team has come out of the gates
in its past two games.
"I think some people are playing their hearts out," she said.
"But we have to find the combinations of people who will real
ly work hard and get done what we need to get done."
The Cardinal will square off against Oregon State in
Corvallis on Saturday at 3 p.m. in an attempt to avenge
last night's loss.

layup by junior guard Corrie Mizusawa with 8.6 seconds
on the clock.
Stanford looked to have the game in hand, after going up by
five points when freshman center Kristen Newlin converted
one of two free throws with 36 seconds on the clock.
But the last 36 seconds absolutely belonged to Mizusawa.
After Newlin missed the second free throw, junior guard
Sebnem Kimyacioglu looked to have an offensive rebound in
hand, but Misuzawa somehow got possession and was able to
call a timeout for Oregon.
On the subsequent Duck possession, Misuzawa took the ball
to the hole and somehow got an acrobatic 10-foot jumper to go
down, while drawing a foul on junior guard Kelley Suminski.
And while she missed the free throw, Misuzawa went after
the rebound and drew a loose ball foul on Suminski, her fifth —
sending the Cardinal junior to the bench.
Misuzawa sunk the next two free throws, pulling Oregon
within one with 20.6 seconds to go.
The Ducks had no choice but to foul and the Cardinal got
the ball into the hands of exactly the right person — their Ail-
American, cool-as-a-cucumber, fearless-under-pressure, 88.9
percent free-throw-shooting senior forward Nicole Powell.
But with the crowd on its feet making all the the noise it
could possibly make, Powell failed to convert, rimming out the
front end of her one-and-one.
It was again Misuzawa to the rescue, coolly taking the ball
the length of the floor and converting the final layup.
With 8.6 seconds left on the clock, the Cardinal attempted to
recreate last year's scene, getting the ball inbounds to Powell,
who took the ball the length of the court and drew some contact

on the final shot, but could not get the call
and was forced to throw up a desperation
air ball as the clock wound down.
"For us it's very disappointing to be in
the situation that we think we are in and
then not be able to step up and make big
plays down the stretch." said Stanford
head coach Tara VanDerveer.
And while Stanford seemed to fall
apart in the final minute, it was actually
the first four minutes of the game — the
Ducks didn't miss a single shot and were
able to build a 10-point lead — that Van-
Derveer felt made the difference.
"I think we really got in trouble right
at the beginning of the game," said Van-
Derveer. "They really got their confi
dence up. [They had| eight threes in the
first half. Our defense was really passive
... this game obviously meant a lot to
their team."
And while Oregon had a hot start, the
Cardinal worked its way back into the
game with a fair amount of ease. Sumins
ki got hot, hitting three of her first four
shots — all threes — and within six min
utes the Cardinal had turned a 10-point
deficit into a six-point lead.
But having to overcome such a deficit
just might have taken a little too much out
of the Cardinal.
"We didn't come out with the intensi
ty that we needed to come out with. We

weren't the aggressors," Suminski said. "We had to come hack
from starting so slowly. Every minute of the game is important
and you can't waste any time, you really have to play your best
game every minute."
And it didn't seem that Suminski wasted any time — finish
ing with a game-high 19 points while adding five rebounds and
three assists in 39 minutes — VanDerveer questioned the de
sire and heart of some of her players.
"I think it's a disappointing loss," she said. "I wish it was
more painful... ITiere's not that competitive fire there for 40

minutes that this level demands."
VanDerveer alluded to a change in her starting lineup after
being unhappy with the way the team has come out of the gates
in its past two games.
"I think some people are playing their hearts out," she said.
"But we have to find the combinations of people who will real
ly work hard and get done what we need to get done."
The Cardinal will square off against Oregon State in
Corvallis on Saturday at 3 p.m. in an attempt to avenge
last night's loss.

Despite fouling out, junior guard Kelley Suminski was the Cardinal's top scorer
with 19 points in Stanford's down-to-the-wire loss to Oregon atMcArthur Court
last night. Ducks junior CorrieMizusawasinglehandedly closed a five-point gap
late in the game and scored the layup that gave Stanford its fourth conference
loss of the season.
For the past two seasons, when the No. 10 Stanford
women's basketball team (20-6,13-4 Pacific-10 Conference)
has visited McCarthur Court to face Oregon nothing but
drama has ensued.
Last year, the Cardinal escaped from McCarthur Court
with a 75-74 victory over Oregon on two free throws by then
junior Nicole Powell after a 75-foot inbounds pass from
T'Nae Thiel.
