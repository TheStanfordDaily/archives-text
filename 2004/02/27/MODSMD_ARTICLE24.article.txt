# Women in first at Pac-10 swim
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
If someone were making predic
tions about the Pacific-10 Confer
ence women's swimming and diving
championships, Stanford head coach
Richard Quick said that most people
would guess that No. 7 UCLA would
garner the title.
However, the Cardinal swam well
on the first day of competition on
Wednesday, putting the squad in a
tie for first place with California and
in prime position to pull an upset.
The team kicked off the Pac-10
meet with one of its weaker races —
the 800-meter freestyle relay. But
Stanford managed to finish in fourth
place behind Cal, Southern Califor
nia and Arizona.
The Cardinal's k A' team — ju
niors Tami Ransom and Lacey
Boutwell, sophomore Dana Kirk
and freshman Desiree Stahley —
finished with a time of 7:17.73,
with Stahley recording the team's
fastest lap.
The second and final event on
Wednesday night was the 200 med
ley relay, an event much more suited
to the Cardinal's strengths.
Seniors Megan Baumgartner and
Tara Kirk, junior Sarah Jones and
Dana Kirk combined to touch the
wall at 1:39.87, less than a second
ahead of the Arizona team and good
enough for the win.
At the end of the first day of com
petition, Stanford and Cal — each
with a first and a fourth place finish
— were tied at the top of the stand
ings with 116 points.
Stanford was able to hold onto
that lead in the second day of com
petition, pulling out a two-day total
of 482 to place them ahead of UCLA
(410), Arizona (398), Cal (354) and
Arizona State (322.5).
Freshman Morgan Hentzen
grabbed seventh place in the first race
of the day, the 500 free, which gave
the Cardinal 23 points. Fellow fresh
man Lauren Costella picked up 20
more points with a win in the consola

tion final of the event. Junior Evins
Cameron gave the squad another 13
points with her 14th place finish.
Two Stanford swimmers broke
into the top eight of the finals of the
200 individual medley event. Sopho
more Kristen Caverly, who missed
last weekend's meet against Cal for
health reasons, seemed back in full
form and pulled into the number
three spot with a time of 1:59.17.
Sophomore Laura Davis came in
seventh in the race at 2:02.03.
The Cardinal won yet another
consolation final, with Dana Kirk
touching the wall first for 20 points.
Ransom came in three spots behind
Kirk in 12th place.
Boutwell gave Stanford its first
win of Day 2 with a 22.60 time in the
50 free. The victory was her second
career Pac-10 meet win in the event.
Jones picked up eighth place with a
time of 23.38, while Baumgartner
finished 15th.
Thursday's final race was the 200
free relay, and the Cardinal picked
up yet another top-three finish to
close out its dominant day. Jones,
Baumgartner, Boutwell and Ran
som clocked in at 1:39.09, in third
place and just hundredths of a sec
ond off of the winning UCLA team.
Today's competition will in
clude the 400 IM, 100 butterfly, 200
free, 100 breast, 100 back and 400
medley relay.
The Stanford diving squad also
competed in the conference cham
pionships in Federal Way, Wash.
Freshman Cassidy Krug impressed
in the 3-meter competition, scor
ing 480.55 points and a second
place finish. She was bested only
by Arizona State's Trisha Tumlin
son, who dominated the event with
a score of 520.95.
Junior Ashlee Rosenthal pulled
into sixth place after picking up
457.80 points and sophomore Sara
Bowling was right behind Rosenthal
with a point total of 456.10.
Competition continues today
for the Cardinal divers with the 1-
meter event.
