# No. 1 baseball takes on Cal
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
The No. 1 Stanford baseball team
(10-2) will kick off the Pacific-10 Con
ference season when it travels across
the Bay to face arch-rival California
(7-6) this weekend. Most of the folks
over at Berkeley will be prepared to
give the Cardinal a rude reception.
"Our hitters and infielders usually
catch a lot of flak," senior rightfielder
Brian Hall said.
But at least one man — Cal coach
Dave Esquer — will welcome Stan
ford with open arms.
Or at least a handshake.
Esquer played on the Farm for
four years under head coach Mark
Marquess. He was the starting short
stop on the 1987 National Champi
onship team and served as an assistant
to Marquess from 1991 to 19%.
"He's done a great job," said Mar
quess of Esquer, the 2001 Pac-10
Coach of the Year. "It was strange
coaching against him the first time, but
we've gotten used to it."
The coaches' relationship predates
the birth of most of their current play
ers, and many of the players on both
teams have gotten to know each other
while playing summer ball.
But make no mistake: There is no
love lost between the two teams.
"We want to beat them bad,"
Hall said. "Over the summer you
get to know a lot of the guys on their
team, but now we just want to beat
them."
For that to happen, Stanford's her
alded offense will have to come alive.
The team combined to hit a meager
.208 in the Texas series, and it will face
another tough pitching staff this week
end. Cal's rotation is led by sophomore
starter Adam Gold, who came within
one out of a no-hitter against Fresno
State on Saturday, ending up with a
complete game shutout and a career
high 10 strikeouts. Gold has gone 3-0
this year, posting a remarkable 0.68
ERA in four starts.
The Cardinal did see some signs of
life from its offense in a 9-4 exhibition
win over Rikkyo University of Japan
on Tuesday, especially from the play
ers who have gotten the most time at
DH this year. That position is hitting

.156, but on Tuesday, the two players
who have logged the most time at DH
— sophomores Chris Carter and Ben
Summerhays — launched back-to
hack home runs to right field. In addi
tion, backup catcher John Hester, who
could also DH, went four-for-four in
the game.
"It's good to see those guys swing
ing the bat well," Marquess said. "It
gives us a lot of flexibility."
For the first time this season. Mar
quess has set the starting rotation
ahead of time. He will go with sopho
more Mark Romanczuk, the only
pitcher who has been starting since the
beginning of the season, on Friday.
Romanczuk is 3-1 with a 2.% ERA this
season and has come into his own of
late, allowing only three earned runs

and strikingout2l battersin 14 innings
of work over his last two outings.
Sophomore Jeff Gilmore, who had
a rough start last week, will follow Ro
manezuk in the rotation. Gilmore suf
fered his first loss of the year after giv
ing up seven runs in 3 2 / 3 innings of
work on Saturday, but he impressed in
his first two starts of the year, giving up
only four runs while striking out 13
battersin 15 innings.
Freshman Blake Holler will be re
warded with another start after his win
last Sunday, in which he gave up one
run on only three hits in six innings to
beat Texas, 8-1.
"I was very pleased with Holler,"
said senior centerfielder Sam Fuld of
the hard-throwing lefty's perfor
mance last week. "He is aggressive, he

comes after you and that's the thing
that really stands out about him."
Three of the four main collegiate
baseball polls, including Baseball
America, have ranked Stanford first
in their latest polls.
"We appreciate it, but we want to be
first at the end of the season," Hall said.
Marquess confirmed Hall's senti
ment, saying the ranking just means
that the team is off to a good start.
"It means that we've played well
the first few games, which is saying a
lot because we played some good
teams and took five of six from [No. 6]
Texas and [No. 14] Fullerton. It's nice
to be recognized," Marquess said.
Stanford will put that ranking on
the line this weekend at Evans Dia
mond, starting at 2 p.m. on Friday.

Freshman Blake Holler will take the moundat Cat's Evans Diamond on Sunday in a well-earned second start of the

"We want to beat them bad,"
Hall said. "Over the summer you
get to know a lot of the guys on their
team, but now we just want to beat
them."
For that to happen, Stanford's her
alded offense will have to come alive.
The team combined to hit a meager
.208 in the Texas series, and it will face
another tough pitching staff this week
end. Cal's rotation is led by sophomore
starter Adam Gold, who came within
one out of a no-hitter against Fresno
State on Saturday, ending up with a
complete game shutout and a career
high 10 strikeouts. Gold has gone 3-0
this year, posting a remarkable 0.68
ERA in four starts.
The Cardinal did see some signs of
life from its offense in a 9-4 exhibition
win over Rikkyo University of Japan
on Tuesday, especially from the play
ers who have gotten the most time at
DH this year. That position is hitting

.156, but on Tuesday, the two players
who have logged the most time at DH
— sophomores Chris Carter and Ben
Summerhays — launched back-to
hack home runs to right field. In addi
tion, backup catcher John Hester, who
could also DH, went four-for-four in
the game.
"It's good to see those guys swing
ing the bat well," Marquess said. "It
gives us a lot of flexibility."
For the first time this season. Mar
quess has set the starting rotation
ahead of time. He will go with sopho
more Mark Romanczuk, the only
pitcher who has been starting since the
beginning of the season, on Friday.
Romanczuk is 3-1 with a 2.% ERA this
season and has come into his own of
late, allowing only three earned runs

and strikingout2l battersin 14 innings
of work over his last two outings.
Sophomore Jeff Gilmore, who had
a rough start last week, will follow Ro
manezuk in the rotation. Gilmore suf
fered his first loss of the year after giv
ing up seven runs in 3 2 / 3 innings of
work on Saturday, but he impressed in
his first two starts of the year, giving up
only four runs while striking out 13
battersin 15 innings.
Freshman Blake Holler will be re
warded with another start after his win
last Sunday, in which he gave up one
run on only three hits in six innings to
beat Texas, 8-1.
"I was very pleased with Holler,"
said senior centerfielder Sam Fuld of
the hard-throwing lefty's perfor
mance last week. "He is aggressive, he

comes after you and that's the thing
that really stands out about him."
Three of the four main collegiate
baseball polls, including Baseball
America, have ranked Stanford first
in their latest polls.
"We appreciate it, but we want to be
first at the end of the season," Hall said.
Marquess confirmed Hall's senti
ment, saying the ranking just means
that the team is off to a good start.
"It means that we've played well
the first few games, which is saying a
lot because we played some good
teams and took five of six from [No. 6]
Texas and [No. 14] Fullerton. It's nice
to be recognized," Marquess said.
Stanford will put that ranking on
the line this weekend at Evans Dia
mond, starting at 2 p.m. on Friday.

Freshman Blake Holler will take the moundat Cat's Evans Diamond on Sunday in a well-earned second start of the
season. The lefty allowed just one run and three hits last weekend against Texas to join sophomores Mark Ro
manczuk and Jeff Gilmore in the No. 1 Cardinal's starting rotation.
The No. 1 Stanford baseball team
(10-2) will kick off the Pacific-10 Con
ference season when it travels across
the Bay to face arch-rival California
(7-6) this weekend. Most of the folks
over at Berkeley will be prepared to
give the Cardinal a rude reception.
"Our hitters and infielders usually
catch a lot of flak," senior rightfielder
Brian Hall said.
But at least one man — Cal coach
Dave Esquer — will welcome Stan
ford with open arms.
Or at least a handshake.
Esquer played on the Farm for
four years under head coach Mark
Marquess. He was the starting short
stop on the 1987 National Champi
onship team and served as an assistant
to Marquess from 1991 to 19%.
"He's done a great job," said Mar
quess of Esquer, the 2001 Pac-10
Coach of the Year. "It was strange
coaching against him the first time, but
we've gotten used to it."
The coaches' relationship predates
the birth of most of their current play
ers, and many of the players on both
teams have gotten to know each other
while playing summer ball.
But make no mistake: There is no
love lost between the two teams.
"We want to beat them bad,"
Hall said. "Over the summer you
get to know a lot of the guys on their
team, but now we just want to beat
them."
For that to happen, Stanford's her
