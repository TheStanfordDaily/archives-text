### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a Pacific-10 Conference double
header against No. 24 Oregon on Friday and
No. 9 California on Sunday, it's a pivotal
weekend for the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team (8-0).
The Cardinal-Ducks showdown, which
begins today at noon at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium, marks the long-awaited
opening of Pac-10 dual-match play for the
Cardinal.
Stanford is heavily favored, having swept
the Ducks for three consecutive seasons, 7-0.
"We are very excited to get our Pac-10
season finally underway," said Stanford
head coach Lele Forood. "[Though] we've
played two of the Pac-10 teams at the Na
tional Team Indoor Championships, it's such
a different format [there] that it didn't feel

like our Pac-10 season."
Earlier this month, Stanford downed No.
8 UCLA, 6-1, and No. 4 Washington, 5-0, on
its way to clinching a record seventh title at
Team Indoors. But unlike the drawn-out ac
tion characteristic of dual matches, many in
dividual matches were reigned in by time
constraints at Indoors.
Oregon was ranked 42nd at the time of
Team Indoors and was not invited to attend.
The Ducks currently boast a 9-1
record and have moved up into the top 25
for just the second time in history. Last
year in March, the Ducks hit a record No.
22.
Undefeated until last Saturday, Oregon
suffered a tough loss on Washington's home
courts, 5-2. No. 7 Daria Panova took her first
fall of the season, dropping in the top singles
position to No. 35 Claire Carter, 6-3, 5-7,1-0
(5).

Panova (21-5), a junior, has given the Car
dinal her share of trouble in recent meetings.
At Northwest Regionals, she got the best of
freshman Theresa Logar in the round of 16,
6-2,2-6, 6-1.
"Panova has had a great individual cam
paign, just like last year," Forood said.
"Amber Liu did beat her last year and she's
doing a lot of extra work [to repeat her victo
ry] this year."
Liu, a sophomore, heads the singles line
up and is currently ranked 61st.
As for teammate Logar, she has made a
huge leap from No. 84 to No. 26, according to
the new rankings published on Tuesday.
Backed by a considerable 16-2 record, Logar
is primed fora comeback.
"I have no hesitation saying we can rise to
the occasion," she said.
Logar competes in the No. 5 singles posi
tion and is currently the fifth-highest-ranked

freshman in the country.
Oregon's Dominika Dieskova also makes
the top-10-freshmen list, at No. 46. Playing in
the No. 2 singles slot, she will face No. 16
sophomore Alice Barnes today.
Stanford's confidence carries over to the
upcoming match against California (7-2).
Last season, the Cardinal won, 6-1, in its first
meeting with the Bears and edged them out,
4-3, in its second.
"We're a much more experienced team
this season," Forood said. "We had a lot of
new people in the lineup last year [but] this
year there are only two new people."
Stanford will he on the lookout for the
Bears' breakout player, No. 21 Sasha Pod
kolzina (6-3). After relinquishing a final de
cision at the Northwest Championships to
Panova, 7-5, 5-7, 2-6, the freshman has seen
little time on the courts.
"Sasha has been ill and we don't know if

we can expect to see her right now," Forood
said.
California's top singles player. No. 2
Raquel Kops-Jones, will face No. 12 Erin
Burdette on Sunday. Burdette, a junior, has
a point to prove after deferring to Kops-
Jones in the finals of the Riviera / ITA Ail-
American Women's Championships in Oc
tober, 6-3, 6-2.
Burdette teams up with No. 24 Lauren
Barnikow, a senior, to form the top-ranked
doubles team in the nation. Securing a 13-1
record, the two clinched a title over the No.
23 tandem of Kops-Jones and Podkolzina at
the Northwest Championships.
"[Despite our experience], we're still very
much a developing team and these matches
will help us improve our doubles play,"
Forood said. "Right now we have the benefit
of being ranked No. 1, but what matters most
is being top-ranked in June."
