# Softball heads to Wildcat Invite
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
The No. 7 Cardinal softball team (11-
2) should be well prepared for tourna
ment play against nationally ranked op
ponents when it travels to Tucson, Ariz,
for the Arizona Wildcat Invitational this
weekend. After all, the Cardinal has
emerged victorious in eight of its last nine
games, including wins over No. 9 Alaba
ma and No. 19 Pacific.
Judging by the quality of its opposi
tion, the Cardinal had better be ready.
The weekend schedule for Stanford in
cludes No. 25 South Florida (15-2) and
undefeated Pacific-10 Conference rival
Arizona (16-0), currently ranked second
in the country. The Cardinal will also play
Oklahoma State (9-4) and Boston Uni
versity (4-6) this weekend.
Stanford begins its weekend against
the highly regarded Oklahoma State on
Friday morning at 9 a.m. The Cowgirls
are currently sitting on the cusp of the
top 25. Stanford and Oklahoma State
have met six times before, with the all
time series split at 3-3. However, Stan
ford won its last matchup with the Cow
girls, a 3-1 victory last year at the Speed
line Invitational.
The biggest test of the weekend for
the Cardinal will be the Arizona game
Friday evening at 5 p.m. The Wildcats
bring a perfect 16-0 record into this
weekend thanks to the hitting of Au
tumn Champion (.582 batting average)
and Wendy Allen (.545) and the pitching
of ace Alicia Hollowell, whose numbers
are almost obscene â€” a perfect 11 -0
record and a minuscule 0.31 ERA to go
with 141 strikeouts.
The Wildcats hold an overwhelming
31-3 edge in the all-time series against the
Cardinal, but the pressure is somewhat

lessened on Stanford be
cause this tournament
game does not count in
the Pac-10 standings.
On Saturday, Stan
ford faces a South Flori
da squad looking to
avenge Stanford's 2001
victory in the only previ
ous meeting between
the two schools. The
Cardinal rounds out its
scheduled games for the
weekend against Boston
University at 11 a.m. on
Saturday. The Terriers
hold a 1 -0 edge in the all
time series against the
Cardinal, with the win
coming in 2001.
The Cardinal will
play its last game on Sun
day, with its opponent
contingent upon the out
come of Friday and Sat
urday's games.
The centerpiece of
the weekend is the Ari
zona game, which could
feature a matchup be
tween two of the best
collegiate pitchers in
the nation if the Wild
cats eo with Hollowell

against Stanford ace Dana Sorensen.
While Sorensen's numbers this year (6-
2, 0.82 ERA, 58 Ks) don't quite match
up to Hollowell's, "Lightning D" is a
former All-American and the Cardi
nal's best hurler.
Sorensen won't be without support,ei
ther, from sophomore sluggers Catalina
"Little Cat" Morris and Lauren Lappin,
whose offensive prowess won them both

All-Pac-10 selections last year as true
freshmen. Moms in particular is coming
off a huge weekend during which she bat
ted .400 with a home run, four RBI. and
three runs scored. Also coming off a big
weekend is sophomore pitcher Laura
Severson, who held Coastal Carolina to
one run in a 3-1 Cardinal victory and
pitched a strong game against the U.S.
Olympic team.

In the aftermath of last weekend's
Palm Springs Classic, head coach John
Rittman pointed out that "the timely
hit" was the only thing separating his
team from a 10-game winning streak in
collegiate play. If the Cardinal can pull
through with a few timely hits this
weekend, it just might pull off an upset
of No. 2 Arizona on its home turf and go
5-0 in Tucson, Ariz.

Freshman Lindsay Key and the Stanford softball squad face a weekend of challenges in Tucson,
most notably from host Arizona. The No. 2 undefeated Wildcats hold a decisive 31 -3 advantage
in meetings between the two squads and the Cardinal looks to end Arizona's current 16-game
win streak.
