# Parents' Weekend Guide
## A 						Publication of The Stanford Daily Welcome to Stanford Parents' Weekend attracts more than 3,000 to campus 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
Thousands of Stanford parents
are once again flooding campus for
a weekend of classes, panels and
entertainment.
According to Kate Chesley, as
sociate director of University
Communications, the mission of
Parents' Weekend, an annual
event, is to "help parents feel en
gaged with the University and wel
come on campus."'
She added, "We try to give (par
ents] a sense of a Stanford stu
dent's academic and social life."
Chesley estimated that approxi
mately 3,000 parents will attend
this year's Parents' Weekend.
While this number does not reflect
a major change from last year's , it
is a far cry from the event's early
years — as recently as 1997, only
1,700 parents attended.
"The most dramatic change [in
recent years] has been in upper
class parents," she said. "About
half of our attendees are freshmen
parents, 20 percent are parents of
sophomores and the rest divided
evenly between the junior and se
nior classes. And we've expanded
our programming in response."
In particular, Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Sharon Long will host a special ses
sion today focusing on the chal
lenges students face in their junior
and senior academic years.
Chesley said that another addi

tion to Parents' Weekend program
is a symposium tomorrow dis
cussing undergraduate research.
"Everyone is invited, so we
hope other students will attend and
learn what opportunities are open
to them," she said.
This weekend's programming
also includes a panel on choosing a
career hosted by Lance Choy, di
rector of the Career Development
Center, and a panel offering fresh
men perspectives on their first year
at Stanford.
The latter panel will be hosted
by Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students Judy Lythcott-Haims and
will feature six freshmen, five of
whom are members the Frosh
Council.
"My goal is for the audience to
come away with an understanding
of the richness of the freshman ex
perience at Stanford," Lythcott-
Haims said. "The panelists will
share challenges as well as tri
umphs, hopes as well as fears."
She added, "The panelists rep
resent a nice cross section of the
class, with respect to where they
live on campus and what part of the
country they hail from."
Stanford's six community cen
ters — the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro
cano, the LGBT Community Re
sources Center, the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center and the
Women's Community Center —
will all hold receptions for parents

today, giving them a chance to
meet staff and, in some cases,
watch performances.
"The reception is an opportuni
ty to let parents know that there is
a community of students and per
sonnel who are interested in the
success of Natives," said Winona
Simms, director of the Native
American Cultural Center. "Par
ents can learn what kind of support
is available and our program can
help them feel comfortable and
confident that Stanford is a place
where Native students belong."
Ben Davidson, director of the
LGBT-CRC, noted that the recep
tion can be a particularly important
occasion for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender students.
"For many of these students,
hosting their parents at the center
is an important step: a way of
pridefully sharing a part of them
selves they had previously felt
compelled to keep secret," he said.
"And many of their parents are
thrilled to see that Stanford em
braces and supports their LGBT
kids as an important part of its di
versity mission."
Sophomore Linda Tran, one of
the organizers of the LGBT-CRC's
reception, agreed.
"In the LGBT community, stu
dents have to deal with a lot of issues,
among them privacy, identity and ac
ceptance, so coming out or even ap
proaching topics of gender and sexu
al orientation with parents can be a
significant experience," she said.

According to Chesley, Stan
ford's Parents' Weekend tradition
probably began around 1984. Over
the years, number of attendees and
events has increased greatly, in
cluding a large jump in attendance
— which has been sustained in fol
lowing years— in 1998.
Chesley acknowledged that
Stanford is slightly unusual in that
it holds its Parents' Weekend on

the last full weekend of February,
while many other universities hold
theirs in the fall.
"I think Stanford's Parents'
Weekend was originally in the
fall," she said. "It appears as
though the date was switched to
February / March in the mid-1990s
. . . Some folks have suggested
changing the date, but any time of
the year is going to be challenging

given the University's crowded
schedule. February presents
weather challenges, but it's a good
midpoint in the year."
Chesley concluded, "We
couldn't hold Parents' Weekend
without help from a great number
of departments, organizations, of
fices and volunteers from through
out campus. We're very grateful
for all the support we receive."

weather challenges, but it's a good
midpoint in the year."
Chesley concluded, "We
couldn't hold Parents' Weekend
without help from a great number
of departments, organizations, of
fices and volunteers from through
out campus. We're very grateful
for all the support we receive."

tors are expected to come to tfie Farm through Sunday.
Thousands of Stanford parents
are once again flooding campus for
a weekend of classes, panels and
entertainment.
According to Kate Chesley, as
sociate director of University
Communications, the mission of
Parents' Weekend, an annual
event, is to "help parents feel en
gaged with the University and wel
come on campus."'
She added, "We try to give (par
ents] a sense of a Stanford stu
dent's academic and social life."
Chesley estimated that approxi
mately 3,000 parents will attend
this year's Parents' Weekend.
While this number does not reflect
a major change from last year's , it
is a far cry from the event's early
years — as recently as 1997, only
1,700 parents attended.
"The most dramatic change [in
recent years] has been in upper
class parents," she said. "About
half of our attendees are freshmen
parents, 20 percent are parents of
sophomores and the rest divided
evenly between the junior and se
nior classes. And we've expanded
our programming in response."
In particular, Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Sharon Long will host a special ses
sion today focusing on the chal
lenges students face in their junior
and senior academic years.
Chesley said that another addi

tion to Parents' Weekend program
is a symposium tomorrow dis
cussing undergraduate research.
"Everyone is invited, so we
hope other students will attend and
learn what opportunities are open
to them," she said.
This weekend's programming
also includes a panel on choosing a
career hosted by Lance Choy, di
rector of the Career Development
Center, and a panel offering fresh
men perspectives on their first year
at Stanford.
The latter panel will be hosted
by Dean of Freshman and Transfer
Students Judy Lythcott-Haims and
will feature six freshmen, five of
whom are members the Frosh
Council.
"My goal is for the audience to
come away with an understanding
of the richness of the freshman ex
perience at Stanford," Lythcott-
Haims said. "The panelists will
share challenges as well as tri
umphs, hopes as well as fears."
She added, "The panelists rep
resent a nice cross section of the
class, with respect to where they
live on campus and what part of the
country they hail from."
Stanford's six community cen
ters — the Asian American Activi
ties Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro
cano, the LGBT Community Re
sources Center, the Native Ameri
can Cultural Center and the
Women's Community Center —
will all hold receptions for parents

today, giving them a chance to
meet staff and, in some cases,
watch performances.
"The reception is an opportuni
ty to let parents know that there is
a community of students and per
sonnel who are interested in the
success of Natives," said Winona
Simms, director of the Native
American Cultural Center. "Par
ents can learn what kind of support
is available and our program can
help them feel comfortable and
confident that Stanford is a place
where Native students belong."
Ben Davidson, director of the
LGBT-CRC, noted that the recep
tion can be a particularly important
occasion for lesbian, gay, bisexual
and transgender students.
"For many of these students,
hosting their parents at the center
is an important step: a way of
pridefully sharing a part of them
selves they had previously felt
compelled to keep secret," he said.
"And many of their parents are
thrilled to see that Stanford em
braces and supports their LGBT
kids as an important part of its di
versity mission."
Sophomore Linda Tran, one of
the organizers of the LGBT-CRC's
reception, agreed.
"In the LGBT community, stu
dents have to deal with a lot of issues,
among them privacy, identity and ac
ceptance, so coming out or even ap
proaching topics of gender and sexu
al orientation with parents can be a
significant experience," she said.

According to Chesley, Stan
ford's Parents' Weekend tradition
probably began around 1984. Over
the years, number of attendees and
events has increased greatly, in
cluding a large jump in attendance
— which has been sustained in fol
lowing years— in 1998.
Chesley acknowledged that
Stanford is slightly unusual in that
it holds its Parents' Weekend on

the last full weekend of February,
while many other universities hold
theirs in the fall.
"I think Stanford's Parents'
Weekend was originally in the
fall," she said. "It appears as
though the date was switched to
February / March in the mid-1990s
. . . Some folks have suggested
changing the date, but any time of
the year is going to be challenging

given the University's crowded
schedule. February presents
weather challenges, but it's a good
midpoint in the year."
Chesley concluded, "We
couldn't hold Parents' Weekend
without help from a great number
of departments, organizations, of
fices and volunteers from through
out campus. We're very grateful
for all the support we receive."
