# Students and parents bond over weekend of activities
## 
### KATIE BEARMAN 
This weekend, hundreds of par
ents will flock to the Stanford cam
pus to visit their kids and to gather a
sense of life at Stanford. Tresidder
Union, dormitories. White Plaza and
campus cafes will be packed with
chipper adults snapping photos and
taking in the California sunshine.
Everywhere you turn, moms and
dads will be found in cardinal red
sweatshirts proclaiming that they are
"Proud Stanford Parents."
Many who attend Parents' Week
end have not been at Stanford since
they tearfully dropped off their chil
dren at New Student Orientation.
Stanford, then, is still relatively new
to them, and they are excited to take

another look at the University now
that their kids have happily adjusted.
Other parents, however, are
quite familiar with the Farm. Some
alumni use Parents' Weekend as an
opportunity not only to visit their
kids, but also to re-live their own
college experience. They miss their
Stanford days and want to experi
ence anew the active campus, the
tolls of the clock tower and the ex
citing sporting events.
Many students who now attend
Stanford heard, throughout their
childhood, stories about the school
from their grandparents, parents,
siblings, or other relatives. Whether
impressed by the caliber of Stanford
academics, tempted by the overseas
study and research opportunities or

entertained by tales of the often out
rageous Tree, many children devel
oped a strong desire to attend Stan
ford. Receiving acceptance to Stan
ford was an indescribable thrill;
opening the thick envelope bearing
"Congratulations" on the front flap
culminated their hopeful daydream
ing and commenced their long await
ed status as Stanford students.
Julia James, a sophomore from
Oregon, grew up with Stanford on
her mind. When she was nine years
old, her oldest sister was a freshman
at Stanford. Subsequently, three
more of her siblings enrolled at the
University. Although James was not
sure that she wanted to follow her
brothers and sisters to the Farm, she
said that she "dropped the [reluc

tance) act" when she got her accep
tance letter.
Like two of her siblings, James
plays on the ultimate frisbee team. She
also goes on geology field trips and
does community service tutoring.
James said that she loves Stanford and,
to her excitement, her little brother
Tom is going to be a freshman here
next year. Soon, the Stanford campus
will have been graced with the pres
ence of six James kids as students —
that must be some sort of record.
So why did so many members of
the James family choose to come to
Stanford? Julia James said that the
"first couple of kids in my family
based their decisions to come on the
typical things, like academic reputa
tion and location." She and her
younger brother, however, were
mostly motivated to come here by
the aspects of Stanford life that they
heard about through their siblings:
social and athletic stuff, opportuni
ties for travel and research, and
"crazy traditions."
When asked if she felt as if any
aspects of Stanford culture influ
enced her family life, Julia ex
claiihed, "Are you kidding? My
family life influences Stanford cul
ture. I think it's about time we got
our own theme house."
While James and her siblings con
nect with each other through Stan
ford traditions, senior Laura Fowler
has developed a Stanford bond with
her parents. Fowler's mother and fa
ther attended the University as un
dergraduates, lived in Rinconada as
freshman and got married while they
were still in school here.
Fowler seriously considered
many schools besides Stanford, but
she decided on the Farm because it
"seemed to fit [her] personality and
had cool classes." Although her par
ents were students here. Fowler said

that it was very easy to make the
campus feel like her own.
Although the draw is now com
puterized and there is no longer a
bowling alley in Tresidder as there
was during her parents' days, Fowler
and her parents think that many as
pects of Stanford have remained
"very similar."
"It's neat to be able to share some
of the same experiences as my par
ents. For example, both my mom
and I were Hum Bio majors. We
have had some of the same profes
sors and taken some of the same
classes," Fowler said.
Will McColl is another sopho
more whose family has deep roots in
the University. McColl's parents,
grandparents, uncles and various
other relatives spent their under
graduate years at Stanford.
McColl said that his family
bonds over the wonderful educa
tional institution that they have in
common; they share with each
other many stories about their Stan
ford experiences.
McColl's parents, for instance,
often talk about the movement to
take away the politically incorrect
"Chief Lightfoot" mascot which oc
curred while they were undergradu
ates. They remember with amuse
ment the administration's dismay
when the students voted on the Tree
as the new mascot. "Unable to han
dle" this decision, McColl said, the
administration declared that Stan
ford would be referred to as "The
Cardinal."
Although McColl takes pride in
Stanford's current character and
traditions, he wishes he could have
shared some of the fun experienced
by his parents; for example, his
mother and father said that "during
Dead Week . . . the mountain
climbing club would repel down the

side of Meyer Undergraduate Li
brary and deliver their version of a
study break."
"I wonder when the last time
something that exciting happened in
Green," McColl said.
Will McColl's grandfather, Bill
McColl, said that he "likes pontifi
cating about the 'good old days'"
and that his children and grandchil
dren are always "attentive, interest
ed, and courteous."
Obviously, much has changed at
Stanford since Bill McColl was a stu
dent. He mentioned that while today
there are no large single-sex resi
dences, Roble Hall housed only
women and Encina Hall only men
back in the 19505. Additionally, Bill
McColl was dismayed by the fact
that the lake no longer holds water.
"Lake Lagunita was full in the
spring. It was the center of activity
and was the site of the Fall Big Game
Bonfire," Bill McColl said. "Both
were great events and the present
students have not had a chance to ex
perience them."
Will McColl remarked that al
though some changes have taken
place, "the sun still shines down on
the golden foothills as it did fifty
years ago. [My relatives] love to
come back and feel that, and to see
how Stanford has grown into a pre
mier research institution while still
keeping in touch with its past. They
tell me how Stanford gives its gradu
ates a ... new perspective on life; I
can still see that love for life flicker in
their eyes."
It seems that Stanford remains
fun, lively and influential from gen
eration to generation. As moms and
dads take over the campus during
the next few days, we should remem
ber that one day, we too may attend
Parents' Weekend and reminisce
about the "good old days."

nect with each other through Stan
ford traditions, senior Laura Fowler
has developed a Stanford bond with
her parents. Fowler's mother and fa
ther attended the University as un
dergraduates, lived in Rinconada as
freshman and got married while they
were still in school here.
Fowler seriously considered
many schools besides Stanford, but
she decided on the Farm because it
"seemed to fit [her] personality and
had cool classes." Although her par
ents were students here. Fowler said

that it was very easy to make the
campus feel like her own.
Although the draw is now com
puterized and there is no longer a
bowling alley in Tresidder as there
was during her parents' days, Fowler
and her parents think that many as
pects of Stanford have remained
"very similar."
"It's neat to be able to share some
of the same experiences as my par
ents. For example, both my mom
and I were Hum Bio majors. We
have had some of the same profes
sors and taken some of the same
classes," Fowler said.
Will McColl is another sopho
more whose family has deep roots in
the University. McColl's parents,
grandparents, uncles and various
other relatives spent their under
graduate years at Stanford.
McColl said that his family
bonds over the wonderful educa
tional institution that they have in
common; they share with each
other many stories about their Stan
ford experiences.
McColl's parents, for instance,
often talk about the movement to
take away the politically incorrect
"Chief Lightfoot" mascot which oc
curred while they were undergradu
ates. They remember with amuse
ment the administration's dismay
when the students voted on the Tree
as the new mascot. "Unable to han
dle" this decision, McColl said, the
administration declared that Stan
ford would be referred to as "The
Cardinal."
Although McColl takes pride in
Stanford's current character and
traditions, he wishes he could have
shared some of the fun experienced
by his parents; for example, his
mother and father said that "during
Dead Week . . . the mountain
climbing club would repel down the

side of Meyer Undergraduate Li
brary and deliver their version of a
study break."
"I wonder when the last time
something that exciting happened in
Green," McColl said.
Will McColl's grandfather, Bill
McColl, said that he "likes pontifi
cating about the 'good old days'"
and that his children and grandchil
dren are always "attentive, interest
ed, and courteous."
Obviously, much has changed at
Stanford since Bill McColl was a stu
dent. He mentioned that while today
there are no large single-sex resi
dences, Roble Hall housed only
women and Encina Hall only men
back in the 19505. Additionally, Bill
McColl was dismayed by the fact
that the lake no longer holds water.
"Lake Lagunita was full in the
spring. It was the center of activity
and was the site of the Fall Big Game
Bonfire," Bill McColl said. "Both
were great events and the present
students have not had a chance to ex
perience them."
Will McColl remarked that al
though some changes have taken
place, "the sun still shines down on
the golden foothills as it did fifty
years ago. [My relatives] love to
come back and feel that, and to see
how Stanford has grown into a pre
mier research institution while still
keeping in touch with its past. They
tell me how Stanford gives its gradu
ates a ... new perspective on life; I
can still see that love for life flicker in
their eyes."
It seems that Stanford remains
fun, lively and influential from gen
eration to generation. As moms and
dads take over the campus during
the next few days, we should remem
ber that one day, we too may attend
Parents' Weekend and reminisce
about the "good old days."

Cars drive down Palm Drive in order to arrive in time for New Student Orientation two years ago.
This weekend, hundreds of par
ents will flock to the Stanford cam
pus to visit their kids and to gather a
sense of life at Stanford. Tresidder
Union, dormitories. White Plaza and
campus cafes will be packed with
chipper adults snapping photos and
taking in the California sunshine.
Everywhere you turn, moms and
dads will be found in cardinal red
sweatshirts proclaiming that they are
"Proud Stanford Parents."
Many who attend Parents' Week
end have not been at Stanford since
they tearfully dropped off their chil
dren at New Student Orientation.
Stanford, then, is still relatively new
to them, and they are excited to take

another look at the University now
that their kids have happily adjusted.
Other parents, however, are
quite familiar with the Farm. Some
alumni use Parents' Weekend as an
opportunity not only to visit their
kids, but also to re-live their own
college experience. They miss their
Stanford days and want to experi
ence anew the active campus, the
tolls of the clock tower and the ex
citing sporting events.
Many students who now attend
Stanford heard, throughout their
childhood, stories about the school
from their grandparents, parents,
siblings, or other relatives. Whether
impressed by the caliber of Stanford
academics, tempted by the overseas
study and research opportunities or

entertained by tales of the often out
rageous Tree, many children devel
oped a strong desire to attend Stan
ford. Receiving acceptance to Stan
ford was an indescribable thrill;
opening the thick envelope bearing
"Congratulations" on the front flap
culminated their hopeful daydream
ing and commenced their long await
ed status as Stanford students.
Julia James, a sophomore from
Oregon, grew up with Stanford on
her mind. When she was nine years
old, her oldest sister was a freshman
at Stanford. Subsequently, three
more of her siblings enrolled at the
University. Although James was not
sure that she wanted to follow her
brothers and sisters to the Farm, she
said that she "dropped the [reluc

tance) act" when she got her accep
tance letter.
Like two of her siblings, James
plays on the ultimate frisbee team. She
also goes on geology field trips and
does community service tutoring.
James said that she loves Stanford and,
to her excitement, her little brother
Tom is going to be a freshman here
next year. Soon, the Stanford campus
will have been graced with the pres
ence of six James kids as students —
that must be some sort of record.
So why did so many members of
the James family choose to come to
Stanford? Julia James said that the
"first couple of kids in my family
based their decisions to come on the
typical things, like academic reputa
tion and location." She and her
younger brother, however, were
mostly motivated to come here by
the aspects of Stanford life that they
heard about through their siblings:
social and athletic stuff, opportuni
ties for travel and research, and
"crazy traditions."
When asked if she felt as if any
aspects of Stanford culture influ
enced her family life, Julia ex
claiihed, "Are you kidding? My
family life influences Stanford cul
ture. I think it's about time we got
our own theme house."
