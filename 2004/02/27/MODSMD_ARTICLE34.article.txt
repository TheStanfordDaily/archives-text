# Eat, Drink and be Merry
## Top ten restaurants to check out (while your parents are footin' the bill) 
### JENNIE BRODER FOOD COLUMNIST 
Let me just begin by saying, I
know what you're thinking. You
are thinking about how great this
week just became because you get
to read two Jennie Broder articles
in a two-day period.
I know I'm not appearing in my
usual spot, but for this special week
end I decided to step out of my little
designated space into the world of
the parents — a world where the
dining options are sky-high. So all
those concerns you may have about
wasting meal points, or wasting dol
lar bills better spent on random pur
chases at the drugstore - throw them
out the window. When the parents
are in town, get ready for fine living
like you've never experienced be
fore. Well, you may have experi
enced it for those first 18 years of
life, but life doesn't really start until
college, anyway.
This weekend is your chance to
milk your parents for nice dinners
— it's one of those few times when
they will actually agree to take you
where you want to go and when
your little sister can't veto your de
cision or steal shotgun. So don't let
this opportunity pass you by.
A good plan of action, in my
opinion, is to set your sights on
places with entrees costing up
wards of $15. Not that you should
purposively look for expensive
places, but chances are you won't
be frequenting there as much as
Quizno's, so might as well go when
someone's willing to pay for it.
Take this advice, of course, in
moderation. My top ten list reflects
more than simply high-class dining.
Because I know that sometimes, you

just want to order a burger and move
on with your life. So I have chosen an
array of restaurants, ranging from
the excellent average places to the
exceptional pricey ones. A quarter at
school costs about $11,000, so per-

haps we could
ease up on the
parents' wallet
fora meal or two
this weekend.
D r u mr o 11
please . ..
10. Cheese
cake Factory $$

375 University Avenue, Palo Alto
or California Pi/.za Kitchen $$ 531
Cowper St, Palo Alto.
Don't give me that look. I know
these restaurants are pretty over
rated and usually have lines that
could rival Celine Dion's show in
Vegas, but they are spectacles not
able to be experienced in all cities.
So if you come from a town that is
not taken over by the massive por
tions of the Cheesecake Factory or
the thai chicken pizza of CPK, it
might be fun to take your parents
to these gastronomic zoos fora
night.
9. Max's Opera Cafe $$ 711
Stanford Shopping Center, Palo
Alto.
Although this claims to be a
deli, it doesn't serve breakfast
food and it's not open 24 hours (or
at least past 10 p.m.), so I'm some
what skeptical of this title. But this
atmosphere is much classier than
Cheesecake's and offers a similar,
yet less complex multi-paged
menu. So if your parents are in the
mood for classic American fare,
this place is a good bet. And the

warm raisin rolls they serve in the
beginning are pretty darn tasty.
8. Hobbee's $-$$ 67 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto or
Stacks $-$$ 600 Santa Cruz Ave at
El Cainino, Menlo Park.
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day, so you
should take it seriously and leave its
preparation to a professional (pro
fessional chef, that is). When my
parents came last year they wanted
to eat with me in the dining hall, but
1 quickly steered them from this op
tion and pointed them in Ihe direc
tion of Hobbee's. I am a huge egg
fan, and this is one of the few places
that can make a good scramble
every time I go. Stacks is another
solid brunch option with a more
diner-esque feel compared to
Hobbee's family-style atmosphere.
But people have their personal fa
vorites. The wait is the same (i.e.
very long) at either place, especially
at the hour that parents think is nor
mal to eat (i.e. very early). Stacks
offers a greater variety of pancake
options, like banana-coconut, but
Hobbee's offers amazing blueberry
coffeecake. And plus, as limited as
their pancake selection might be, 1
am still a huge fan of their sole op
tion, whole wheat-honey.
7. Pluto's $ 482 University Av
enue, Palo Alto.
Now I know this one isn't very
exciting—but if your family is
looking fora quick, light lunch or
dinner before a movie or other ex
citing excursion, you can't beat
Pluto's for its price, tastiness or
quickness. 1 think I've eaten here
more times during my Stanford ca
reer than is probably healthy, but

that's because it's the only place
around here to get an amazing
salad or grilled sandwich that's
under $8. And you can definitely be
in and out within an hour if need be.
6. Mandarin Gourmet $$ 420
Kamona Street, Palo Alto.
If you are in the mood forstraight
up Chinese food, but don't exactly
feel like ordering in and chilling with
your parents in your dorm room, try
this restaurant with classic Chinese
dishes in an upscale atmosphere.
Many a satisfied customer rave about
the sesame chicken, but every dish
here will be a safe, usually familiar,
bet. And what better way to eat a
family-style meal than with your
family ... it just works so perfectly.
5. Iligashi West $$-$$$ 636
Emerson St., Palo Alto or Fuki
Sushi $$•sss 4119 EI Camino, Palo
Alto.
These two sushi restaurants offer
top-of-the-line choices in peaceful
yet classy environments. Both can
entertain both the raw-fish and the
vegetable lovers, as they present a
wide selection of rolls as well as
soup, salads and main entrees. Fuki
Sushi offers more high-quality, tra
ditional rolls, whereas Higashi West
offers an inventive array of contem
porary rolls, using ingredients such
as mango, asparagus, mint and a lot
of smoked salmon. So, if you are
looking for an amazing, authentic
sushi experience, I'd recommend
Fuki Sushi, and if you want to try
something less raw-fish oriented
and more unusual, I'd suggest Hi
gashi.
4. Spago $$$-$$$$ 265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto.

This one's got a rep, folks. If
your parents are willing to pay the
pricey menu costs, you should
probably grab the chance to eat at
one of Wolfgang Puck's upscale
restaurants while you can. In
Spago you'll find a chic, trend-set
ting atmosphere with California
fusion cuisine (which means basi
cally everything — from Asian to
French to Italian to American, it all
fused together and decided to take
up residence in the Golden State).
Be prepared for some sophisticat
ed and innovative dishes, so the
timid taster should be warned.
3. Evvia $$$ 546 University
Ave., Palo Alto.
My favorite Greek restaurant in
Palo Alto, Evvia offers flavorful,
traditional menu options, along
with a beautiful, rustic atmosphere.
The pots and dried plants hanging
atop the kitchen frame make it feel
very home-like, and the solid wood
en tables and woven-wood chairs
add to the bucolic scene. The crusty
bread they initially serve is both
earthy yet soft, and the warm pita
bread melts in your mouth, blend
ing perfectly with the creamy tzatzi
ki sauce, stuffed grape leaves and
crunchy Greek salad. I absolutely
love this restaurant both for lunch
(served on weekdays) and dinner,
and if you are a fan of Mediter
ranean food, look no further.
2. Three Seasons $$$ 518 Bryant
St., Palo Alto or Tamarine $$$ 546
University Ave., Palo Alto.
As you might have gleaned from
my column on Wednesday, Three
Seasons is one of the best finds in
Palo Alto for Vietnamese cuisine,
for its trendy atmosphere and deli

cate yet superb dishes. In my arti
cle I did not mention Tamarine,
however, which is also an amazing
choice for Vietnamese fare. The
dishes are a little more sophisticat
ed there, and they offer a number
of different kinds of steamed rice
(from vanilla and coconut, to rain
bow, to jasmine, etc.) to accompa
ny the plates. The atmosphere at
Tamarine seems a little older, a bit
more refined and traditional,
whereas the atmosphere at Three
Seasons is a bit younger and funki
er. Both are excellent choices
though, and I would go whenever
there is a reservation open.
1. Straits Cafe $$$-$$$$ 3295 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto.
This is just one of those places
where students only seem to go
when parents are around, with the
exception of those few smart guys
who know how that this is a fabulous
place to bring a girl on a date. The
reason it works for both categories
— parents and dates — is that it is
such a warm, beautiful atmosphere
with classy overtones, that diners
are understandably impressed. Par
ents will love the ambiance, and the
bold Singaporean cuisine will engulf
even the most obstinate eater. Re
plete with outdoor seating and crisp,
white tablecloths, the blend of Indi
an, Chinese and Thai flavors results
in marvelously distinct flavors and a
beautiful presentation. The thick,
moist Indian roti prata bread is
amazing, as well as the curry and the
steamed fish dishes. All in all, a won
derful restaurant with high chances
of parent-approval.

on with your life. So I have chosen an
array of restaurants, ranging from
the excellent average places to the
exceptional pricey ones. A quarter at
school costs about $11,000, so per-

haps we could
ease up on the
parents' wallet
fora meal or two
this weekend.
D r u mr o 11
please . ..
10. Cheese
cake Factory $$

375 University Avenue, Palo Alto
or California Pi/.za Kitchen $$ 531
Cowper St, Palo Alto.
Don't give me that look. I know
these restaurants are pretty over
rated and usually have lines that
could rival Celine Dion's show in
Vegas, but they are spectacles not
able to be experienced in all cities.
So if you come from a town that is
not taken over by the massive por
tions of the Cheesecake Factory or
the thai chicken pizza of CPK, it
might be fun to take your parents
to these gastronomic zoos fora
night.
9. Max's Opera Cafe $$ 711
Stanford Shopping Center, Palo
Alto.
Although this claims to be a
deli, it doesn't serve breakfast
food and it's not open 24 hours (or
at least past 10 p.m.), so I'm some
what skeptical of this title. But this
atmosphere is much classier than
Cheesecake's and offers a similar,
yet less complex multi-paged
menu. So if your parents are in the
mood for classic American fare,
this place is a good bet. And the

warm raisin rolls they serve in the
beginning are pretty darn tasty.
8. Hobbee's $-$$ 67 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto or
Stacks $-$$ 600 Santa Cruz Ave at
El Cainino, Menlo Park.
They say breakfast is the most
important meal of the day, so you
should take it seriously and leave its
preparation to a professional (pro
fessional chef, that is). When my
parents came last year they wanted
to eat with me in the dining hall, but
1 quickly steered them from this op
tion and pointed them in Ihe direc
tion of Hobbee's. I am a huge egg
fan, and this is one of the few places
that can make a good scramble
every time I go. Stacks is another
solid brunch option with a more
diner-esque feel compared to
Hobbee's family-style atmosphere.
But people have their personal fa
vorites. The wait is the same (i.e.
very long) at either place, especially
at the hour that parents think is nor
mal to eat (i.e. very early). Stacks
offers a greater variety of pancake
options, like banana-coconut, but
Hobbee's offers amazing blueberry
coffeecake. And plus, as limited as
their pancake selection might be, 1
am still a huge fan of their sole op
tion, whole wheat-honey.
7. Pluto's $ 482 University Av
enue, Palo Alto.
Now I know this one isn't very
exciting—but if your family is
looking fora quick, light lunch or
dinner before a movie or other ex
citing excursion, you can't beat
Pluto's for its price, tastiness or
quickness. 1 think I've eaten here
more times during my Stanford ca
reer than is probably healthy, but

that's because it's the only place
around here to get an amazing
salad or grilled sandwich that's
under $8. And you can definitely be
in and out within an hour if need be.
6. Mandarin Gourmet $$ 420
Kamona Street, Palo Alto.
If you are in the mood forstraight
up Chinese food, but don't exactly
feel like ordering in and chilling with
your parents in your dorm room, try
this restaurant with classic Chinese
dishes in an upscale atmosphere.
Many a satisfied customer rave about
the sesame chicken, but every dish
here will be a safe, usually familiar,
bet. And what better way to eat a
family-style meal than with your
family ... it just works so perfectly.
5. Iligashi West $$-$$$ 636
Emerson St., Palo Alto or Fuki
Sushi $$•sss 4119 EI Camino, Palo
Alto.
These two sushi restaurants offer
top-of-the-line choices in peaceful
yet classy environments. Both can
entertain both the raw-fish and the
vegetable lovers, as they present a
wide selection of rolls as well as
soup, salads and main entrees. Fuki
Sushi offers more high-quality, tra
ditional rolls, whereas Higashi West
offers an inventive array of contem
porary rolls, using ingredients such
as mango, asparagus, mint and a lot
of smoked salmon. So, if you are
looking for an amazing, authentic
sushi experience, I'd recommend
Fuki Sushi, and if you want to try
something less raw-fish oriented
and more unusual, I'd suggest Hi
gashi.
4. Spago $$$-$$$$ 265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto.

This one's got a rep, folks. If
your parents are willing to pay the
pricey menu costs, you should
probably grab the chance to eat at
one of Wolfgang Puck's upscale
restaurants while you can. In
Spago you'll find a chic, trend-set
ting atmosphere with California
fusion cuisine (which means basi
cally everything — from Asian to
French to Italian to American, it all
fused together and decided to take
up residence in the Golden State).
Be prepared for some sophisticat
ed and innovative dishes, so the
timid taster should be warned.
3. Evvia $$$ 546 University
Ave., Palo Alto.
My favorite Greek restaurant in
Palo Alto, Evvia offers flavorful,
traditional menu options, along
with a beautiful, rustic atmosphere.
The pots and dried plants hanging
atop the kitchen frame make it feel
very home-like, and the solid wood
en tables and woven-wood chairs
add to the bucolic scene. The crusty
bread they initially serve is both
earthy yet soft, and the warm pita
bread melts in your mouth, blend
ing perfectly with the creamy tzatzi
ki sauce, stuffed grape leaves and
crunchy Greek salad. I absolutely
love this restaurant both for lunch
(served on weekdays) and dinner,
and if you are a fan of Mediter
ranean food, look no further.
2. Three Seasons $$$ 518 Bryant
St., Palo Alto or Tamarine $$$ 546
University Ave., Palo Alto.
As you might have gleaned from
my column on Wednesday, Three
Seasons is one of the best finds in
Palo Alto for Vietnamese cuisine,
for its trendy atmosphere and deli

cate yet superb dishes. In my arti
cle I did not mention Tamarine,
however, which is also an amazing
choice for Vietnamese fare. The
dishes are a little more sophisticat
ed there, and they offer a number
of different kinds of steamed rice
(from vanilla and coconut, to rain
bow, to jasmine, etc.) to accompa
ny the plates. The atmosphere at
Tamarine seems a little older, a bit
more refined and traditional,
whereas the atmosphere at Three
Seasons is a bit younger and funki
er. Both are excellent choices
though, and I would go whenever
there is a reservation open.
1. Straits Cafe $$$-$$$$ 3295 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto.
This is just one of those places
where students only seem to go
when parents are around, with the
exception of those few smart guys
who know how that this is a fabulous
place to bring a girl on a date. The
reason it works for both categories
— parents and dates — is that it is
such a warm, beautiful atmosphere
with classy overtones, that diners
are understandably impressed. Par
ents will love the ambiance, and the
bold Singaporean cuisine will engulf
even the most obstinate eater. Re
plete with outdoor seating and crisp,
white tablecloths, the blend of Indi
an, Chinese and Thai flavors results
in marvelously distinct flavors and a
beautiful presentation. The thick,
moist Indian roti prata bread is
amazing, as well as the curry and the
steamed fish dishes. All in all, a won
derful restaurant with high chances
of parent-approval.

Jennie Broder

Let me just begin by saying, I
know what you're thinking. You
are thinking about how great this
week just became because you get
to read two Jennie Broder articles
in a two-day period.
I know I'm not appearing in my
usual spot, but for this special week
end I decided to step out of my little
designated space into the world of
the parents — a world where the
dining options are sky-high. So all
those concerns you may have about
wasting meal points, or wasting dol
lar bills better spent on random pur
chases at the drugstore - throw them
out the window. When the parents
are in town, get ready for fine living
like you've never experienced be
fore. Well, you may have experi
enced it for those first 18 years of
life, but life doesn't really start until
college, anyway.
This weekend is your chance to
milk your parents for nice dinners
— it's one of those few times when
they will actually agree to take you
where you want to go and when
your little sister can't veto your de
cision or steal shotgun. So don't let
this opportunity pass you by.
A good plan of action, in my
opinion, is to set your sights on
places with entrees costing up
wards of $15. Not that you should
purposively look for expensive
places, but chances are you won't
be frequenting there as much as
Quizno's, so might as well go when
someone's willing to pay for it.
Take this advice, of course, in
moderation. My top ten list reflects
more than simply high-class dining.

important meal of the day, so you
should take it seriously and leave its
preparation to a professional (pro
fessional chef, that is). When my
parents came last year they wanted
to eat with me in the dining hall, but
1 quickly steered them from this op
tion and pointed them in Ihe direc
tion of Hobbee's. I am a huge egg
fan, and this is one of the few places
that can make a good scramble
every time I go. Stacks is another
solid brunch option with a more
diner-esque feel compared to
Hobbee's family-style atmosphere.
But people have their personal fa
vorites. The wait is the same (i.e.
very long) at either place, especially
at the hour that parents think is nor
mal to eat (i.e. very early). Stacks
offers a greater variety of pancake
options, like banana-coconut, but
Hobbee's offers amazing blueberry
coffeecake. And plus, as limited as
their pancake selection might be, 1
am still a huge fan of their sole op
tion, whole wheat-honey.
7. Pluto's $ 482 University Av
enue, Palo Alto.
Now I know this one isn't very
exciting—but if your family is
looking fora quick, light lunch or
dinner before a movie or other ex
citing excursion, you can't beat
Pluto's for its price, tastiness or
quickness. 1 think I've eaten here
more times during my Stanford ca
reer than is probably healthy, but

that's because it's the only place
around here to get an amazing
salad or grilled sandwich that's
under $8. And you can definitely be
in and out within an hour if need be.
6. Mandarin Gourmet $$ 420
Kamona Street, Palo Alto.
If you are in the mood forstraight
up Chinese food, but don't exactly
feel like ordering in and chilling with
your parents in your dorm room, try
this restaurant with classic Chinese
dishes in an upscale atmosphere.
Many a satisfied customer rave about
the sesame chicken, but every dish
here will be a safe, usually familiar,
bet. And what better way to eat a
family-style meal than with your
family ... it just works so perfectly.
5. Iligashi West $$-$$$ 636
Emerson St., Palo Alto or Fuki
Sushi $$•sss 4119 EI Camino, Palo
Alto.
These two sushi restaurants offer
top-of-the-line choices in peaceful
yet classy environments. Both can
entertain both the raw-fish and the
vegetable lovers, as they present a
wide selection of rolls as well as
soup, salads and main entrees. Fuki
Sushi offers more high-quality, tra
ditional rolls, whereas Higashi West
offers an inventive array of contem
porary rolls, using ingredients such
as mango, asparagus, mint and a lot
of smoked salmon. So, if you are
looking for an amazing, authentic
sushi experience, I'd recommend
Fuki Sushi, and if you want to try
something less raw-fish oriented
and more unusual, I'd suggest Hi
gashi.
4. Spago $$$-$$$$ 265 Lytton
Ave., Palo Alto.

This one's got a rep, folks. If
your parents are willing to pay the
pricey menu costs, you should
probably grab the chance to eat at
one of Wolfgang Puck's upscale
restaurants while you can. In
Spago you'll find a chic, trend-set
ting atmosphere with California
fusion cuisine (which means basi
cally everything — from Asian to
French to Italian to American, it all
fused together and decided to take
up residence in the Golden State).
Be prepared for some sophisticat
ed and innovative dishes, so the
timid taster should be warned.
3. Evvia $$$ 546 University
Ave., Palo Alto.
My favorite Greek restaurant in
Palo Alto, Evvia offers flavorful,
traditional menu options, along
with a beautiful, rustic atmosphere.
The pots and dried plants hanging
atop the kitchen frame make it feel
very home-like, and the solid wood
en tables and woven-wood chairs
add to the bucolic scene. The crusty
bread they initially serve is both
earthy yet soft, and the warm pita
bread melts in your mouth, blend
ing perfectly with the creamy tzatzi
ki sauce, stuffed grape leaves and
crunchy Greek salad. I absolutely
love this restaurant both for lunch
(served on weekdays) and dinner,
and if you are a fan of Mediter
ranean food, look no further.
2. Three Seasons $$$ 518 Bryant
St., Palo Alto or Tamarine $$$ 546
University Ave., Palo Alto.
As you might have gleaned from
my column on Wednesday, Three
Seasons is one of the best finds in
Palo Alto for Vietnamese cuisine,
for its trendy atmosphere and deli

cate yet superb dishes. In my arti
cle I did not mention Tamarine,
however, which is also an amazing
choice for Vietnamese fare. The
dishes are a little more sophisticat
ed there, and they offer a number
of different kinds of steamed rice
(from vanilla and coconut, to rain
bow, to jasmine, etc.) to accompa
ny the plates. The atmosphere at
Tamarine seems a little older, a bit
more refined and traditional,
whereas the atmosphere at Three
Seasons is a bit younger and funki
er. Both are excellent choices
though, and I would go whenever
there is a reservation open.
1. Straits Cafe $$$-$$$$ 3295 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto.
This is just one of those places
where students only seem to go
when parents are around, with the
exception of those few smart guys
who know how that this is a fabulous
place to bring a girl on a date. The
reason it works for both categories
— parents and dates — is that it is
such a warm, beautiful atmosphere
with classy overtones, that diners
are understandably impressed. Par
ents will love the ambiance, and the
bold Singaporean cuisine will engulf
even the most obstinate eater. Re
plete with outdoor seating and crisp,
white tablecloths, the blend of Indi
an, Chinese and Thai flavors results
in marvelously distinct flavors and a
beautiful presentation. The thick,
moist Indian roti prata bread is
amazing, as well as the curry and the
steamed fish dishes. All in all, a won
derful restaurant with high chances
of parent-approval.

Jennie Broder

Let me just begin by saying, I
know what you're thinking. You
are thinking about how great this
week just became because you get
to read two Jennie Broder articles
in a two-day period.
I know I'm not appearing in my
usual spot, but for this special week
end I decided to step out of my little
designated space into the world of
the parents — a world where the
dining options are sky-high. So all
those concerns you may have about
wasting meal points, or wasting dol
lar bills better spent on random pur
chases at the drugstore - throw them
out the window. When the parents
are in town, get ready for fine living
like you've never experienced be
fore. Well, you may have experi
enced it for those first 18 years of
life, but life doesn't really start until
college, anyway.
This weekend is your chance to
milk your parents for nice dinners
— it's one of those few times when
they will actually agree to take you
where you want to go and when
your little sister can't veto your de
cision or steal shotgun. So don't let
this opportunity pass you by.
A good plan of action, in my
opinion, is to set your sights on
places with entrees costing up
wards of $15. Not that you should
purposively look for expensive
places, but chances are you won't
be frequenting there as much as
Quizno's, so might as well go when
someone's willing to pay for it.
Take this advice, of course, in
moderation. My top ten list reflects
more than simply high-class dining.
Because I know that sometimes, you

just want to order a burger and move
on with your life. So I have chosen an
array of restaurants, ranging from
the excellent average places to the
exceptional pricey ones. A quarter at
school costs about $11,000, so per-

haps we could
ease up on the
parents' wallet
fora meal or two
this weekend.

10. Cheese
cake Factory $$

375 University Avenue, Palo Alto
or California Pi/.za Kitchen $$ 531
Cowper St, Palo Alto.
Don't give me that look. I know
these restaurants are pretty over
rated and usually have lines that
could rival Celine Dion's show in
Vegas, but they are spectacles not
able to be experienced in all cities.
So if you come from a town that is
not taken over by the massive por
tions of the Cheesecake Factory or
the thai chicken pizza of CPK, it
might be fun to take your parents
to these gastronomic zoos fora
night.
9. Max's Opera Cafe $$ 711
Stanford Shopping Center, Palo
Alto.
Although this claims to be a
deli, it doesn't serve breakfast
food and it's not open 24 hours (or
at least past 10 p.m.), so I'm some
what skeptical of this title. But this
atmosphere is much classier than
Cheesecake's and offers a similar,
yet less complex multi-paged
menu. So if your parents are in the
mood for classic American fare,
this place is a good bet. And the

warm raisin rolls they serve in the
beginning are pretty darn tasty.
8. Hobbee's $-$$ 67 Town &
Country Village, Palo Alto or
Stacks $-$$ 600 Santa Cruz Ave at
El Cainino, Menlo Park.
