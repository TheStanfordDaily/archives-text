# Stanford 101
## Learning the ways of the Farm, one grand tradition at a time 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
1. Learn Stanfordese.
You might sound like a toddler
to most people saying things like
CoHo (the Coffee House) and
HooTow (Hoover Tower) and
MemChu (Memorial Church),
but you'll be hip on the Stanford
campus.
2. Write an angry Opinions
piece to The Daily.
A Stanford education is not
complete without having one print
ed. Popular topics: The Daily's
journalistic "ethics," the Nazifica
tion of the campus Alcohol Policy
and anti-Palestinian hate ads fre
quently run in The Daily.
3. Explore the underground
labyrinths: steam tunneling.
Although it remains ver
boten, braving the musty (but
well-lit) subterranean confines
of the University's expansive
steam tunnel system is a Stan
ford tradition. Easy access
points behind MemChu (see
number one above), near the
math corner of the Quad and at
various other locations.
4. Natty Light and sweaty bod
ies: Enjoy Slavdom's jello party.
To understand the true under
graduate weekend experience,
go to a frat party. Everyone goes
to them — except for your son or
daughter. He/she just studies
on weekend evenings. Seriously.
5. Eat in downtown Palo Alto.
If there's one thing that Palo
Alto does well, it's food. (That,
and housing dot-com billionaires.)
Hot spots: Pasta? (always pro
nounced with an upward, ques
tioning inflection on the last sylla
ble), Peninsula Creamery and the
new Cheesecake Factory.
6. Get groped.
The serial groper, derriere tickler
extraordinaire, terrorized campus
tushies earlier this year. In an in
stance of remarkable journalistic ef

ficacy, he has struck only once since
The Daily ran an editorial entitled
"It's time for serial groper to go"

(Oct. 28). (Edi
tor's note: Others
at The Daily
would prefer that
you "get the grop
er" rather than
"get groped.")
7. Get a park
ing ticket.
Just park in
the Tresidder lot.

Or at Wilbur. Or Stern. Or Mir
rielees. Or ...
8. Take the train to the city.
Oh, wait: You're here for Par
ents' Weekend? Never mind this
one then. CalTrain doesn't run on
weekends. But you could always
take the bus ...
9. Drive north on the 28(1 freeway.
You may find it odd that this
one made it onto the list, but I
have little doubt that the 280 is
the most beautiful freeway in
Calif., passing forests, the Crystal
Springs dam and reservoir, and
eventually providing a hilltop
view of San Francisco. Just make
sure you refer to it as the 280;
never drop the article. (I'm look
ing at you. you lazy Northern
Californians.)
10. Go fountain-hopping.
Another Stanford tradition.
Plop yourself in one after the
other, from the bizarre modernist
Claw outside the Stanford Book
store to the elegant classic in front
of Memorial Auditorium.

Barrett Sheridan is a sophomore
majoring in economics — or, in
other words, something that might
ultimately get him a better job than
writing columns like this one. If you
want to hit Barrett up with your
thoughts (or just hit him), e-mail the
international man of mystery (who
conveniently has a domestic e-mail
address) at barretts@stanford.edu.
And please, no blind date requests.
At least not yet.
