Dear Daily staff member,
I am writing to make a sincere and desperate plea that you
please discontinue the "sex column." Each time my eyes have
stumbled upon this column in recent months, I have been dis
gusted and outraged by the offensive subject matter therein. It is
chalk full of both implicitly and explicitly immoral messages.
Please stop propagating this lewd material. It may not be as
provocative, out maybe you could write about cool ideas for cre
ative dating at Stanford.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
A Concerned Junior
