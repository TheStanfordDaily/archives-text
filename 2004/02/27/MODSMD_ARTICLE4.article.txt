### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
In a speech entitled "How to Make Black
America Better," NFL Director of Football
Operations Gene Washington told a group
of students last night to start addressing the
problem by improving themselves as indi
viduals and by looking to the black business
leaders of the United States for inspiration.
"To me the answer to that is to make
yourself better," Washington said. "To
the extent that you make yourself better
as an individual. Black America is for the
better as well. If you develop your spiritu
al side and your ability to earn a good liv
ing, the better off your child will be, the
better off your wife will be and it em
anates from there."
Washington asked the students in the au
dience what "making Black America bet
ter" meant to them.
"As an African American, to walk into a
room and know you're on equal footing,"
said senior Kevin Dious, a staff member at
the Black Community Services Center,
which sponsored the talk.
Senior Leigh Torrence said it means
"a sense of stability," economically and
otherwise.
"Economics is central to the success

and betterment of the Black Community," Washing
ton agreed.
Washington — who was a Stanford Ail-American,
spent nine seasons on the 49ers and one season with the
Lions and was named no. 29 on Sports Illustrated's
"Most Influential Minorities in Sports" —emphasized
that although they are not as well known as athletes or
other celebrities, African-American business leaders
provide the best example of how to "make Black Amer
ica better." He cited examples such as Franklin Raines,

Fannie Mae CEO, and Kase Lawal, the chairman and
CEO of CAMAC Holdings, Inc., the largest African-
American-owned business in the United States.
"These people have a lot of clout," Washington
said." And they make more money [than celebrities]."
About Lawal, who is Nigerian and whose oil com
pany conducts business in Nigeria, Washington said.
