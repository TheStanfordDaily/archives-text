# The 						Hollywood Life
## George gets curious about the big screen 
### JENNY STINGLE GOSSIP COLUMNIST 
* My dream from child
hood has finally been ful
filled: Curious George is
going to be made into a
movie. Joe Stillman (Shrek
1 & 2 scribe) is teaming with
Daniel Gerson (Monsters,

Inc.) to write the screenplay. Al
though the only known cast member
is currently Will Ferrell, the movie is
set come out late next year.
* Lawrence Bass's sexual assault
charges against Demi Moore have
been dismissed after a thorough in
vestigation. Bass, who worked as an
estate manager at Moore's Idaho
home, claims that Moore groped and

massaged him
against his will.
Being touched by
one of the most
beautiful women in
Hollywood — oh
the horror! I'm sure
the emotional dam
age will be severe.
* Because of
Justin Timberlake's
inappropriate antics
at the Super Bowl,
fellow N'Syncer JC
Chasez's perfor
mance at the NFL's
Pro Bowl game in
February has been
cancelled. Chasez is
outraged, but has
accepted apologies
from Timberlake.
Clearly, if the net-

work heads had investigated N'Sync
at all, they would stop generalizing
and realize that Chasez would never
follow in the same footsteps as Tim
berlake, who is clearly the ghettofied
badass while Chasez is the innocent
pretty boy with blonde highlights.
Wow, people are dumb.
* For all 'The 0.C." lovers out
there, it seems that Summer and
Seth's romance has crossed the line

from TV to reality. Rachel
Bilson and Adam Brody have
been spotted all over West
Hollywood making out and
holding hands.
* The boyish good looks of
Ashton Kutcher may not be
that boyish. Journalists at
the National Enquirer have
discovered an absolutely

shocking document revealing that
Kutcher is not 26 as he claims, but
actually 30. Even with the age differ
ence lowered from 15 to 11 years,
Demi Moore is still a pedophile.
* The stream of tears shed by con
fused teenage girls, immaculately
dressed gay men, and jaded middle
aged wives this past Sunday may have
been avoidable — "Sex and the City"

will be back.
Michael Patrick
King (screen
writer and exec
utive producer
of the show) is
already drafting
a script for the
big screen ver
sion of "Sex in
the City," which
will hopefully
be completed
by May and will
probably air on
HBO. Though
the cast mates
have been ap
proached about
the reunion,
there is no word
about their in
volvement in

the project.
* Director Todd Williams has
taken a new approach to adapting
books into movies. His screenplay for
"The Door in the Floor" is oddly
based only on the first third of John
Irving's 537-page book "A Widow for
One Year." With a release date of this
coming June, this movie will star Jeff
Bridges, Kim Basinger, Bijou Philips
and Mimi Rogers.
