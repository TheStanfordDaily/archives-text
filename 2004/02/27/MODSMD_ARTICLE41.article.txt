## Jesus: Messiah, Savior, movie star Jesus is my homeboy: The Lord speaketh out 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC JESUS H. CHRIST SON OF GOD 
More blood than "Kill Bill." As unwatchable as "Requiem
fora Dream." Nope, not some new slasher flick, but "The Pas
sion of the Christ," Mel Gibson's already controversial account
of the final day in the life of Jesus Christ (played by Jim Caviezel).
Yet, just like the painting of the Virgin Mary covered with buffa-

lo dung, underneath the film's ghastliness
lies a true work of art.
Gibson's tale begins in a beautifully
shot Garden of Olives, fraught with expec
tant tension amidst the foggy gloom of a
moonlit night. When the camera finally
finds the nerve to look Our Savior in the
eye, Jesus drops to his knees and prays for
the strength to complete his Earthly mis-

sion, namely getting the crap kicked, flogged, and crucified out of
him for the next 12 hours, at which time he'll have to undertake
the less-than-enjoyable act of sacrificing his life for all our sins.
To quote Marty McFly, this is heavy.
This film isn't for the faint-hearted. Witnessing Roman thugs
whip out their handy metal-spiked cat-o'-nine-tails and unmer
cifully wail away at Jesus' naked flesh fora good ten minutes
borders on repulsive. And that's before he's nailed to a cross in
super slow motion, leaving nothing to the imagination. Thank
the title character for the flashback scenes depicting better days;
the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper, the Jewish carpen
ter building a table, and so on. These breaks are built-in pre
sumably to allow the audience an opportunity to refrain from
getting nauseous.
In getting right to the heart of the controversy, whom does
Gibson blame for the grisly end to Jesus' earthly existence? Is
"Passion" anti-Semitic? I refuse to go that far and label Mad
Max a Jew-hater, but then again, the film doesn't go out of its way
to look kindly on the Jews either. Whereas Roman governor
Pontius Pilate is written (contrary to historians' reports) as a sym
pathetic character put in an impossible situation, the Jewish high
priest is made out to be a monster, calling for Jesus' crucifixion
and not even batting an eye while witnessing the awful beatings.
Then again, the only truly benevolent characters are Jews. Mary
(the Ashkenazic Maia Morgenstern) and Mary Magdalen (Mon
ica Bellucci). However, the film's overriding role of Jews (like
the maniacally cackling Romans) is that of storm troopers in Star
Wars, a mob of faceless, motiveless enemies.

Sitting through

this film's graph
ic bloodbaths, J

more remi
niscent of

Quentin Tarantino than a bibli-"
cal epic, "Passion" stays on mes-

sage about Christian virtues such as
loving and forgiving one's ene-j
mies. In condemning the unrelent
ing violence through which Jesus

suffered, Gibson makes
an understated point,
calling for the separation

of church and state, as^

yearnings religious ,
vengeance should not

mix with secular criminal trials. Going 1
further, Gibson makes arguments'

against all who have killed in Jesus'
name throughout history.

Although it's hard to get past "Pas-

Yet for all of this film's lack of subtleties (the androgynous.
Marilyn Manson-esque Satan, the repeated slow-motion im
agery of objects falling to the ground), and the seemingly om-i
nipresent cascades of blood, the film is a true work of art. It's ]
wonderful to look at, and the Aramaic, Latin, and ancient He
brew are lovely to listen to. Caviezel, who was struck by light- i
ning on the set, portrays of Jesus with a sincere physicality that,

is downright amazing. There is even some kind of perverse]

beauty in the deluge of blood, in

watching one man take such an

unbearable punishment and

sion" 's graphic violence without wincing,!
Mel Gibson surely doesn't want his audience'
to be desensitized. Even with the complete

lack of back-story concerning why Jerusalem
wanted Jesus dead, the movie fulfills its own am
bitions. For one. it taught this Reformed Jew

something about the New Testament, while I
telling a long-loved story with such beauty. Evenl
though 1 had to turn my head away once or twice,
"The Passion of The Christ" certainly has a lot to
offer.

Hello, My children. Since there has been so much con
troversy surrounding "The Passion of the Christ," a
movie with very personal meaning to Me (for obvious
reasons), I thought I'd use this forum, so graciously lent
|toMe by editors Barrett Sheridan and Tam Vo, to weigh
' in on the issue.

Since it was so difficult to get into a pre-re
lease screening, I haven't had a chance to see
l the film yet. I'm going to head over to the Me-

treon this weekend. (I love the high-tech

l glam of that place.) But, since I'm divine, I

already know what I think about it and the

surrounding hoopla. Omniscience has its

benefits.

So here's My Judgment (pardon
the pun ... the real thing's not for

quite some time yet): kudos to
{Mel.

In the last two millennia
or so, people have forgotten

just exactly how much shit I

went through for

humanity. I got
nailed to a cross, for

Chrissake. Do you
k have any idea
what that feels

like? I was on the receiving end of a

saber to the chest, a crown of thorns,

the savagery of the Romans — I suffered

the whole shebang.
In today's super-sized, fast-paced

world, it takes something very visceral for it
to be real to most people. Priests and pastors
can get up on their pulpit and sing My prais-

es all day long, but what, exactly, does it

mean for the layman in the pew? It means

he's missing the 49ers game.

But a movie, especially one with
lots of blood and gore and drama and lit-

tle imps? That gets people's attention.
Especially when it has Monica Belluc-
I ci in it. Did you see "The Matrix Re
loaded?" To quote Martin, "Damn,
Gina!"
Now, 1 know a lot of you don't
agree with Mr. Gibson's religious

views. I don't really, either. That
thing his dad said about the Jews?

What a nut. I love Jews. Except when
they're crucifying me.

People should stop being so up-

tight about religion. If Mohammed and the
Buddha and I can chill (which we do).

why can't you guys do it? Being reli-

gious is good, but don't let it keep

you from having a sense of

humor.
Well, I've said My piece. I
hope you go to see "The Pas-

sion," but don't let it depress
you. I'm doing just fine now, no

matter what you may see in the movie.

Jesus Christ is the Son of God and Saxrior of Mankind. Shoot

You'd think that we have a really funny quip to go here, huh? Even we have standards. Who can make fun of a guy car
rying a cross? Especially when he's Jesus.
