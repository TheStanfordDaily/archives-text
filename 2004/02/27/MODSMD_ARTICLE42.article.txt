Bolded items are the
recommendations of
famed Intermission
correspondent Vauhi
ni Vara. .. view at
your own risk.

It's that time of the year when San Fran
cisco lets out a rallying cry to the kids who
love music.
It's late February, and the city is calling
for the kids who lip-synch, the kids who
dance, the kids who sway, the kids who
crave the feeling of music pounding under
their feet. The city wants the kids who feel
lost in suburban Stanford, too far away from
the action — the kids who miss going to
shows, miss the iron taste of Pabst Blue Rib
bon, miss the doll-faced scenesters and even
the childbearing, hoodie-wearing, post
scenesters.
I'm one of those kids, and San Francisco
is calling to me, too.
The city is saying: Stop your bitching.
Get off your ass and get into town. The
Noise Pop festival has arrived.
I went to Noise Pop for the first time dur
ing my sophomore year, two Februarys ago.
The Makers, a terrible glam-rock band from
back home — Seattle — were playing at
Bimbo's 365 Club, and my best friend from
home was in town visiting. The show was 21
and over. We were 19, with shitty, cheap
plastic fakes. But Mike Maker was our fa
vorite lead singer of the moment — how
could any one person look so much like Iggy
Pop and Mick Jagger at the same time? —
and, goddammit, we were going to get in.
The bouncer traced his fingernail suspi
ciously across the laminated edges, then
bent our IDs back and forth roughly, before
handing them back, nodding. Looking back,
I realize that the bouncer just didn't give a
shit. But back then, it was magic. The Mak

ers never sounded better. And, that week,
neither did The Faint, Modest Mouse, The
Dirt bombs or Death Cab for Cutie.
Yes, we're Stanford students; yes, we're
busy; yes, the city is a half-hour away. But
this is one week that definitely makes the trip
worth your time. The free British Sea Power
show at Amoeba is too crowded? Go watch
the screening of that Ted Leo & the Phar
macists movie, and check out the British Sea
Power show later that night at Bottom of the
Hill. Not a fan? Go see Neko Case play with
Jesse Sykes and the Sweet Hereafter, or if
that's too tame and girly, stop by the Great
American Music Hall to see Pedro the Lion
— or find out if The Stills sing more than

one good song at their gig at the Inde-

pendent. Still not enough? Crash

at a friend's house and watch

The Wrens — or Devendra

Banhart, the Decem-

herists, Coachwhips or

Sage Francis on

Saturday.
