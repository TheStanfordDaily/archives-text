Don't shrug your shoulders. This is music that'd I
make the most Modest Mouse fan blush, and each \

their second album, "Who Will Cut Our Hair When We Are
Gone?," The Unicorns deliver a definitive affirmation, launch
ing forth on a whimsical, whiny tour that recalls The Shins,
Guided By Voices and a really, really fucked up circus.
Let's begin by listing the absurdities: Apart from the usual
drums-bass-rhythm-synth mix, the band employs toy pianos, toy
organs, tapes, accordions and glockenspiels. This instrumental
ambition is best represented by "Child Star," which begins with
a bass heartbeat and sensitive crooning. Then, suddenly, there's
a key-change, grunge sets in and the lead vocalists Nicholas Di
amonds and Alden Ginger start screaming, "I hate you." But re
ally, it's unconvincing. You can't say "I hate you" when the
whole song has morphed into a knee-slapping hoedown and ex
pect us to take you seriously. And that's not the point, anyway.
The point is to unsettle the listener. Take the opening song "I
Don't Wanna Die" — the staccato piano intro and "Do Do Do
or Die ..flirts with early-Bowie, but then BOOM! there's a
voice scratching over an intercom, and all the Unicorns chime in
creepy cellophane-tearing singing.

Crooked Rain") has a 70s-arena feel that would fog up River

Overall. The Unicorns' use of toy organs and
oards is engaging but potentially tiring. "In

titles) is ominous in the same way that a

something particularly charming about
ike "Somewhere in the asshole of my eye /
muscle that relaxes as I cry" and even the
fleet on your absence / genuflect in my pres-

ence."
Part of The Unicorns' charm, however, lies in their sheer
goofiness. If I made a disparaging clown comparison just a few
moments ago, then let me introduce a minor difference: clowns
smile, horses whinny. Unicorns — with their total ignorance of
the principle of extinction — giggle. And the only way to deal
with lines like "We're the unicorns / We're more than horses /
we're the unicorns and we're people too" is to give in to their
eccentricities. Thats exactly what the band does too, and I'd
pick juvenilia over pretension any day.
Moreover, as you listen to the album, what you begin to real
ize is that the celebrated lack of choruses is actually a misnomer
— each song has, not one, not none, but multiple choruses. A
lesser band would have spread these melodies across several al
bums.
The album comes full circle with the Flaming Lips influenced
"Ready to Die.' Despite the lyrical warning ("Don't pardon me,
it's nothing rude / things conclude"), the album's abrupt closure
is jarring and leaves you feeling a little hollow in the gut.
So, what else can you do but just replay it? Honestly, I'm
happy as long as 1 he Unicorns continue drilling through my
wax-laden ears with their mythical stubs.

The point is to unsettle the listener. Take the opening song "I
Don't Wanna Die" — the staccato piano intro and "Do Do Do
or Die ..flirts with early-Bowie, but then BOOM! there's a
voice scratching over an intercom, and all the Unicorns chime in
creepy cellophane-tearing singing.
"Sea Ghost," the album's one conventional apology song
(think "Cut Your Hair" on Pavement's "Crooked Rain,
Crooked Rain") has a 70s-arena feel that would fog up River

Overall. The Unicorns' use of toy organs and
oards is engaging but potentially tiring. "In
ate the innocuous" (one of a series of terrible
titles) is ominous in the same way that a
n is: by being too fucking cute. There is, how
something particularly charming about
ike "Somewhere in the asshole of my eye /
muscle that relaxes as I cry" and even the
fleet on your absence / genuflect in my pres-

ence."
Part of The Unicorns' charm, however, lies in their sheer
goofiness. If I made a disparaging clown comparison just a few
moments ago, then let me introduce a minor difference: clowns
smile, horses whinny. Unicorns — with their total ignorance of
the principle of extinction — giggle. And the only way to deal
with lines like "We're the unicorns / We're more than horses /
we're the unicorns and we're people too" is to give in to their
eccentricities. Thats exactly what the band does too, and I'd
pick juvenilia over pretension any day.
Moreover, as you listen to the album, what you begin to real
ize is that the celebrated lack of choruses is actually a misnomer
— each song has, not one, not none, but multiple choruses. A
lesser band would have spread these melodies across several al
bums.
The album comes full circle with the Flaming Lips influenced
"Ready to Die.' Despite the lyrical warning ("Don't pardon me,
it's nothing rude / things conclude"), the album's abrupt closure
is jarring and leaves you feeling a little hollow in the gut.
So, what else can you do but just replay it? Honestly, I'm
happy as long as 1 he Unicorns continue drilling through my
wax-laden ears with their mythical stubs.
