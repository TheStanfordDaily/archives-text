# In CCRMA, karma will catch up with you, others
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION STAFF WRITER 
When I arrive at the Knoll, the enormous stone
edifice that houses Stanford's Center for Comput
er Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA),
the first thing I find is a locked door. Once 1 get past
that — using my considerable ingenuity and the
combination printed next to the keypad — I find
the first floor deserted. The halls are dark, the
doors are shut. Some of the signs have been ripped
away. A floor plan of the building is cryptic and un
enlightening. Climbing the Gothic spiral staircase,
1 come to a conclusion — CCRMA must be hiding
something.
Sure, the second floor puts up a good front.
There's a comfy-looking lounge area with some
couches and a foosball table. And in the ballroom,
where I expect to find Mr. Boddy with a candle
stick in his skull, there's only music Prof. Jonathan
Berger.
Berger is involved in all three of CCRMA's

c»
main activities —
teaching, research,
and composing.
When I arrive, he's
decidedly un-sinis
ter, chatting amiably
with a student about
an upcoming pro
ject. As soon as he
starts his lecture,
however, my suspi
cions return. This is
Music 151, "Psy
chophysics and Cog-

nitive Psychology for Musicians." Today's topic:
subliminal messages.
To be fair, these messages are more properly
called "figure-ground ambiguities." They're the
musical equivalent of that popular optical illusion
that can look like either two faces or a vase. Just as
the vase might hide from us in the picture — be
cause our brains perceive it as background — dif
ferent melodies can hide within the same piece of
music.
That's where the computer part comes in. It's
not called CCRMA (and that's pronounced
'karma') for nothing. In addition to the traditional
piano and parquet floor, this ballroom comes
equipped with a desktop, a laptop, two monitors, a
television and what appears to be an elaborate
mixing station. Bergcr goes to town.
First he plays a piece that sounds a lot like a her
ald call in a royal robot court. Just like the faces and
vases illusion, there are two "pictures" here — can
we hear what they are'.' Those more musically in
clined than 1 soon pick them out: "Twinkle Twin
kle Little Star" and "Mary Had a Little Lamb.'
But all those microprocessors aren't here for
nursery rhymes. Now Bergcr plays a Bach prelude
and asks his students to listen for melodic patterns.
Here some CCRMA software comes into play.
Using a MIDI player, Berger speeds the prelude
up to a tempo of 2(X) beats per minute, making it
easier for the students to hear melodic groupings in
the music.
They soon find a four-measure pattern that ap
pears to repeat throughout the piece. But on the
final repetition, the fourth measure is missing. A
mystery is afoot — but not for long. Playing the
piece even faster, Berger reveals another four
measure pattern, hiding under the first like the
vase in the picture. This one resolves nicely at the
end rather than leaving the audience hanging.
Bach snuck it in — it doesn't start until the fourth
bar. But he must have known what he was doing;
listening to the fugue he wrote as a companion to
the prelude, we hear it repeated once again.
I ponder the mind-control possibilities of such

hidden musical codes, but Berger seems more in
terested what they say about our perception.
Composers, he says, have always had some under
standing the physical and psychological effects of
their music. CCRMA's work can enhance this un
derstanding. He mentions an ongoing project in
which he and colleagues take electrocardiograms
of subjects listening to music and then convert
their changing heart patterns into sound signals.
The conversion allows Berger to make music out
of the very act of listening — at least as impressive
as mind-control, if less nefarious.
After the lecture, Berger takes me on a tour of
the building. Our first stop is the lounge, in which
even the foosball table is a high-tech instrument.
Wired with motion and location sensors, it can turn
a game into a musical performance with a different
sound attributed to each player. Lest I think
CCRMA is all child's play, he next takes me to Stu
dio D. Here a system of six speakers allows exper
iments with "ambisonics," or the locations of
sound in physical space.
Then Berger leads me down to the dungeon
that is the first floor. 1 remember all the closed
doors, and my heart flutters a little at the prospect
of a secret laboratory or a crypt for dead com
posers. Instead, Berger shows me Studios A and B.
These are two rooms that, connected by audio
hookup, constitute what he calls "a free-floating
noise-free acoustical space." This space is what
keeps CCRMA in the dilapidated Knoll. Or so
Berger says.
Looking at the digital mixing board, with
switches that can be controlled by mouse, and at
the state-of-the-art recording equipment, I'm im
pressed but not convinced. Surely this old mansion
has more to it than prelude patterns and a nice
sound system. Perhaps a sound-controlled cold fu
sion reactor. Or a secret orchestra of evil robots.
Turns out CCRMA does have a bit of the sci-fi.
Berger's currently working on a project to make
cells sing. Using M ATLAB, he hopes to map data
about the state of a cell — its temperature, for in
stance — into "vocal-like sounds." Doctors will
then be able to diagnose cancer by listening, just as
a mechanic with her ear to the hood might notice
the telltale flapping of a bad fan belt.
My last stop, and final chance to uncover the
CCRMA secret, is a trailer out back, where grad
uate students do much of their day-to-day work.
Here I meet Roberto Segnini, a soft-spoken, de
cidedly non-robotic type who introduces me to
CCRMA's fuzzier side — composing.
Of course, even the fuzzy stuff here isn't all that
fuzzy. Segnini describes a recent project called the
Sound Kitchen, in which he and two fellow stu

dents created music from chemical reactions.
Changes in an electrolyte solution produced
changes in the voltage of a battery, which were
picked up by a device called a microcontroller
and translated into sound. What kind of sound?
Well, to call it music would be a bit of a stretch. In
its most euphonious moments, it sounds like the
monster's theme from a fifties sci-fi soundtrack.
And at its least, it sounds like that monster's roar
ing — played backwards.
This doesn't bother Segnini. For him, composi
tion is about "connecting with the now, the time in
which you live." That means taking advantage of
all available technology, and "that may clash with
perceptions of what is aesthetically pleasant." His
next project: an interactive opera game in which
players control the action with their voices. Such a
game might, he admits "stretch the boundaries"
of conventional listenability. "I also look at beau
ty," he says, "but it's a different way."
Leaving the trailers, 1 realize I've plumbed the
depths of CCRMA without finding a single dead
body, cache of contraband or top-secret lab. Per
haps I've misjudged; perhaps the Knoll is merely
a place where top-notch faculty and students use
state-of-the-art computing tools to explore the in
tersections between science and art.
Then I look up at the building one last time. I
realize there's one place I haven't been — the
third floor. Prof. Berger says it's condemned, ren
dered unsafe by the earthquake damage. Then he
tells me Stanford's President Richard Lyman orig
inally commissioned the building as his private
residence. A decaying mansion, a condemned
floor, a dead president — I can't help imagining
Lyman's ghost wandering those darkened halls.
So next time you walk by the Knoll on a dark
night, listen for the sounds of a departed soul. If
you hear the strains of Bach wafting through the
night air, he might be practicing a prelude. If the
music sounds more electronic, maybe he's experi
menting with the MIDI player. And if a strange as
sortment of beeps and whirrs emanates from the
stone walls, don't be too alarmed — he's probably
playing foosball.




This is not Prof. Jonathan Berger or Weird Al, but
Music Prof. Mark Applebaum.
