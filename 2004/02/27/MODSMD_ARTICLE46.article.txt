You've got to hand it to Air. I mean, not all of us
can live the effortless, almost alien life they seem
to lead, flitting around the globe with a martini in
one hand and a keyboard case in the other. The
Paris duo has spent most of their career lounging
about making 60s and 70s tribute music, schmooz
ing in hip places like Japan with hipster illuminati

UKe sona i. oppoia,
recording scores for cool
movies like Coppola's
2000 directorial debut
"The Virgin Suicides",
and along the way man
aging to record one of
the best sex soundtracks
in 25 years (1998's
"Moon Safari").
Now, after having of
fered their services fora
soundtrack to a second
Coppola Hick (contribut
ing a track to last year's
"Lost in Translation"),
the two have gone back
into business for them
selves with their new
long-player, "Talkie
Walkie."'
1 am heartened by what
1 hear on this blissfully
backwards-named
album. Though "Talkie
Walkie" shares the asex
ual spacey-ness of "The
Virgin Suicides," the
new album draws the lis
tener in much more easi
ly than the frankly ob
tuse "Suicides" or Air's
last studio LP, 2001's
"10,000 Hz Legend."

never live the swinging
life of the otherwordlv

duo, perhaps I can
at last come to un
derstand them and
perhaps even ac
ccpt them as (gasp!
human.

"Talkie Walkie" fea-

tures vocals more promi

nently than previous Air releases, and more im
portantly. is the first time Air-ites Jean-Benoit
Dunckel and Nicolas Godin handle all the lead vo
cals themselves. Their reed-thin voices give the
tracks a sense of ethereal grace and evoke the
timelessness of singing about traveling, space, and
the future.
Most importantly, the album is the first to con
vey a sense of fascination, rather than just fascinat
ing. Gone are the fluid basslines and plaything cho
ruses of "Sexy Boy" and the come-hither Burt
Bacharach tributes like "Kelly Watch the Stars."
The serene electronica of this release shows Air
looking up at the night sky along with us. instead of
just distracting us with shooting stars while they
steal our girlfriends.
And unlike "10,000 Hz Legend" and"The Vir
gin Suicides," this album boasts single power. While
"Talkie Walkie" isn't exactly the most danceable
slab of plastic to come across my desk lately, catchy
tunes like "Cherry Blossom Girl" and "Surfing on a
Rocket" give me the same excitement that "Sexy
Boy" and "Premiers Symptomes" did with "Moon
Safari." "Alone in Kyoto," an instrumental cut
which appeared on the "Lost in Translation"
soundtrack, closes the album in a strange, stately
melancholy of pianos, acoustic guitars, and Japan
ese-inspired synths.
Like Radiohead's "Kid A" before it, "Talkie
Walkie" seems to tug at the uncertainty of our
electronic future, but where "Kid A" creators
dwelled on their senses of alienation and anxiety,
"Talkie Walkie" only finds confidence and won
der in what lies ahead. Air creates an icy sound
scape that captures the darkness of "10.000 Hz
Legend" and"The Virgin Suicides," but that is
also sweet and inviting like "Moon Safari." You
could think of "Talkie Walkie" as a good sound
track fora future winter on Mars, but here on
Earth I just think of it as one of the strongest
records for this winter.
