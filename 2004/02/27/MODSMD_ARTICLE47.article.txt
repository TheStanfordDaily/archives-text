# Gozu, in Japanese, means cow head. Silly Japanese. Stick to raw fish.

This ain't your parent's cow head. In
America, interest in Japanese popular cul
ture, once relegated to the realm of nerds, fan
bovs and aspiring comic book artists, has
spread across the entire country. If you don't
believe me, please reflect fora moment on the
domination of the Cartoon Network by
Anime, the Best Supporting Samurai Oscar
nod for Ken Watanabe, and recent block
busters featuring Lucy Liu, Uma Thurman
and Tom Cruise spitting out considerable dia
logue in their own mangled American take on
the Japanese language.
Yes folks, the Occidental cultural hegemo
ny has finally made way for East Asian cine

ma.Not just limited to bubble-gum pop and
fancy swordplay, the influx of all things
Japanese has brought a new wave of horror
and psychological thrillers to America. Most
notable is the impressively successful "The
Ring," a remake of a Japanese supernatural
horror surrounding a creepy dead girl in a
well and a tape that kills you seven days after
you watch it.
And while "The Ring" is good and freaky,
the real revolutionary stuff, the genre-smash
ing, startlingly fresh horror and thrillers re
quire a little more searching to weed out. But
for many fans, the new wave of Japanese ex
treme cinema can be best summed up in two
words: Takashi Miike. Director and supreme
bad-ass, Miike was slow to be noticed in the
United States, but has recently seen a spate of

popularity among over-the
top shock film buffs and cool
kids nationwide. His films
employ gonzo directing tech
niques and extreme gore, and
each manages to touch on a
least three or four of society's

unspeakable taboos. This include: pedophilia,
the Oedipus complex, lactation, incest, tor
ture, sado-masochism, impotence and all the
other sick stuff mainstream media likes to bury
and ignore.
However, when crafted and embraced by
Miike's insanely unique vision, these themes
do not add up to unwatchable and unbearable
pieces of garbage; in fact, Miike's film are
more often hilarious, and through the use of
sex and violence make a series of subtle social
commentaries. This is true of his latest film
released in America, "Gozu," which played
earlier this month at the San Francisco Indie
Fest.
"Gozu" ("Cow Head" in Japanese) is
billed as being part of the "Yakuza Horror"
genre, but falls more into the realm of surreal
ist comedy. Like the great films of David
Lynch and David Cronenberg, Gozu's plot is
NOT the most important aspect of the film.
The film follows the story of Minami. a
Yakuza underling who is charged by the gang
bosses to drive a former gangster and "Aniki"
Okazaki (older brother) to a Nagoya junk
yard to be whacked. See, Okazaki is cracking
up, as evidenced by him whipping a Chi
huahua ("a Yakuza attack dog," according to
him) into a storefront window by its leash, and
other bouts of paranoia.

Along the way, Okazaki
seemingly dies and then later
disappears from the back seat
of the car. Minami spends the
rest of the film searching for
the lost gangster while run
ning into one insane deus ex

machina situation after another. He encoun
ters (in no particular order): A middle-aged
innkeeper who bottles her own breast milk, a
store owner's American wife who speaks by
reading broken Japanese off a series of cue
cards, a gang boss who can only achieve or
gasm with a soup ladle up his ass, a restaurant
staffed by transsexuals and old men arguing
for hours about whether yesterday was hotter
than today, a junkyard storage closet filled
with the skin of dead Yakuza and a woman
who claims to be the female incarnation of
"Aniki."
Miike's films are the great divider of movie
fans. Some people revile his films as exploitive
garbage, while others hail him as a genre
bending hero. "Gozu" is without much of the
violence of Miike's other films, but in its ab
sence ups the incongruity and obtuse situa
tions in which the insecure and empathetic Mi
nami stumbles into. "Gozu's" strength is the
lively color and spark with which each of the
dozens of characters are drawn. This remark
able and grotesquely enjoyable film sticks one
of the freakiest and laughably obscene
birthing scenes as a final coda to all the ran
dom, crazy-ass happenings in "Gozu." And in
the end, the film doesn't come to any logical
conclusion, as much as it allows the absurdity
to boil over.
