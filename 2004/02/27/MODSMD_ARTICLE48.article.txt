# Now on video: A beginner's guide to Miike classics

Visitor Q

One of Miike's lesser
known films, this story re
volves around the lengths
an aspiring filmmaker
goes to create a documen
tary about problems in
youth culture. This film is
shocking to the point of
hilarity, as we watch
scenes (through the
grainy viewpoint of the
DV camera) of the film
maker sleeping with his
own prostitute daughter,
his own son being bullied
and beaten by kids at
school and about 10 other
social taboos. The film is
in its essence a commen
tary on the strength of
family and the decaying
state of modern society,
but confronts this themes
in a way that only Miike
would dare attempt.

Happiness of the Katakuris

By far the best movie 1 saw last
year, this film revolves around
the Katakuri family, who run a
guest house where the cus
tomers (including a sumo
wrestler and his pre-teen
lover, a Japanese conman pre
tending to be a navy pilot and
member of the British Royal
Family and a man wanted for
murdering his wife) always
wind up dead in the morning.
The film's a ridiculous scram
ble of black comedy, Japanese
TV drama and musical genres,
resorting to claymation for
any sequences which would
have been complicated for
human actors to undertake
(falling off cliffs, fighting a vol
cano, etc). Do yourself a favor:
Buy this one and show it to
anyone who loves absurdist
comedy and adventurous film
making.

Ichi the Killer

Perhaps the quintessential
over-the-top Miike shock
film, Ichi is esentially a
Yakuza revenge flick, ex
cept a hundred times gorier
and a hundred times sicker
than anything else you've
ever seen. Nipples get sliced
off, guts and blood cover the
walls and ceilings and a nee
dle goes through some
dude's eardrum. This one is
brilliant for its sheer excess
and ridiculous gore, but
may be unwatchable to
some, and offensive to oth
ers (that is, women). Under
neath all the sick stuff, the
film does have an interest
ing subtext blurring the no
tions of reality and fantasy.
If you hadn't guessed by
now, this is NOT a first-date
movie or one to check out
with your parents!

Audition

Out of the dozens of films Takashi Miike makes each year, a handful have been recently released on DVD, fol
lowing the surge of interest in the new wave of Japanese horror. Check them out at your local video store or friendly
Green Library.

This film is based off a story by
Japanese novelist Ryu Muraka
mi and follows the story of a
widower that creates a fake act
ing audition in order to look for
a new wife. The woman he pur
sues ends up having her own
twisted history, and in the end
he pays a severe price for his
treatment of her and the other
women. This film is thematically
in line with shock social com
mentaries like "American Psy
cho," "Fatal Attraction" and
"Secretary" but more thorough
ly upsetting and downright diffi
cult to watch at its climax. I am
shuddering when thinking of the
sound effects (Piano wire
against bone . . . eughhhh)
Think "Misery" with a dash of
genitortue and a spritz of sev
ered tongues and feet. Required
viewing for fans of intense phys
iological horror. â€” R.S.
