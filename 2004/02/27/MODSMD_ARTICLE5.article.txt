### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford and the city of Palo Alto
can finally resume business as usual.
Calif. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger
signed a bill last Friday that will allow
LaDoris Cordell, Stanford's vice
provost for campus relations, to sit on
the Palo Alto City Council without
disrupting business between the two
entities.
"As of Friday, Stanford and Palo
Alto could do business again, so I
guess I'm legal now," Cordell said.
Section 1090 of the government
code had inhibited business negotia
tions between Stanford and Palo
Alto since Cordell took her seat Jan.
1 because it forbids city councils
from negotiating contracts with a

corporation for which a city council
member works. Stanford does not
fall under the exemption to the law
made for nonprofit organizations, as
was originally thought, since the
University is set up as a trust. There
are a handful of other exemptions to
the law, but none currently applies to
Cordell.
State Senator Byron Sher intro
duced the bill in January that would
alter the current exemption for non
profit organizations to include trusts
that operate as nonprofits, such as
Stanford. Assemblyman Joe Simitian
carried the bill in the state assembly.
Palo Alto Mayor Bern Beecham
oversaw a committee handling the
problem, and Stanford General
Counsel Vice President Debra
Zuniwalt and Stanford Assoc. Vice

President of Government and Com
munity Relations Larry Horton also
played key roles in resolving the
issue.
"I'm delighted that the bill has
been signed," Cordell said. "I'm ap
preciative of Simitian, Sher and
Mayor Beecham for taking the lead
on this and making this happen."
There are many ongoing contrac
tual negotiations between Palo Alto
and Stanford, dealing with every
thing from the Stanford shopping
center to Marguerite schedules, but
the city council had simply opted to
hold off on negotiating any contracts
with Stanford until the issue was re
solved. The bill was ultimately signed
a month earlier than expected.
"It's amazing that it went through
so quickly." Cordell said.
