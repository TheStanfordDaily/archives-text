# Roxy: A lipstick lesbian for beads
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
This past weekend. Miss Sass herself
took a field trip down south to the Big
Easy fora little par ty called Mardi Gras.
We're talkin' Bourbon Street, alcohol,
sweaty bodies, alcohol, glittering beads,
alcohol, flying boobs and, oh yeah, alco
hol. And what did Roxy find in the Sin
City of the deep South? Read on.
Now. I know that all you horny boys
out there with your tongues flopping on

the floor are just waiting to hear how
Roxy lifted her shirt ana flashed these
balconies of N'Awlins. Old men, ypung
men, tall men, sin jrt men, stout men—aß
shouting choruses of "Show your tits!
Show your tits!" But, sadly, no. Roxy
kept her boobies under wraps. What?
You really thought some sillv plastic
beads would incite Roxy to unleash her
bodacious tatas? No, sir. Not me. Never.
But wait, you have those beads with
the ducks that squeak on them? And,
what's that pair you're dangling now?

My ape-like attraction to shiny objects
just switched on overload! And, noly
crap, those beads over there are bigger
than my head! My eyes glaze over in
wonderment of so many pretty, shiny
dangly things... or maybe its just my
third Hurricane kicking'in. I must have
them, must have, must have the beads.
I reach up and touch my bra strap,
hold it gingerly between two fingers,
begin to slip it down my shoulder. The
shiny shiny beads are rocking in the air
before me, swinging back and forth, back
and forth, tantalizing, sexy, shiny, sexy,
big hard sexy beads ves! And then, one

of my girls taps me on the shoulder. "We
should make out for the beads!" she
whispers. Yes, yes, yes! A brilliant idea!
So, I am happy to say that my girl
friend and I are now the proud owners
of not only ducky beads nut squeaking
elephant beads, devil beads ana, oh yes,
the flashing beads. When we make out,
we make out!
Jostling our way through the sweaty
bodies on our second night of Bourbon,
my girls and I had a brilliant idea —
Hooters shirts. Yes, boys, you heard me
right. Hooters shirts. And let me tell
you, every gal needs one of these in her
closet. We made a little trip to the New
Orleans haven of buffalo wings and
bouncing boobies to purchase our very
own tiny tiny T"s. And I swear, these
shirts are magic! Something about the
design of these shirts actually lifts a girl's
melons up and thrusts them to her chin,
they are the wonderbras of t-shirts.
How come no one ever told us? The
crafty Hooters girls never let us in on
their secret. Those sluts.
Aimed in our hot Hooters ensem
bles, our puppies primed for jiggling and
admiration from the crowd, we set off on
our valiant crusade. I don't know what it
is about these shirts — I mean, I'm defi
nitely a girl who likes to show my ample
cleavage, and I own many shirts that are
just as low cut as this one was —but
there's just somethin' about a shirt having
the word "Hooters" across it in big or
ange bubble letters that drives every pass
ing man to stare, point, and veil, "Hoot
ers! HOOters! HooTERS! Hey, its
Hooter's girls!" Beads were flying,
breasts were flying, shots were bought...
we were all in a Hooters tizzy! One frat
boy come up to us, took all the beads off
of nis neck, and all he could do was shove
them in our direction and mouth "ALL
OF THEM!" When a lanky man in a
I bikers jersey walked by, he even stuffed
a dollar bill down dear Roxy's shirt.
Sweet! Cold hard cash! Even better than
those shinv beads!
And, Roxy asks, what is a trip to
Mardi Gras without a visit to a good,
old-fashioned strip club to soalk up
some of the culture? The first challenge
of our strip club escapade? Picking a
place. There are two strip clubs Tor
every block of Bourbon. And you can't

just go into the first one that you see. We
were on a quest for some quality
women... and some quality lap dances
(more on that later, wink).
So, my three girls and our two drool
ing boys canvassed the streets, checking
out the lobbies and sneaking peeks in
side the clubs. We finally decided on a
classy little joint called Rick's Cabaret.
Cover charge was twenty bucks for
guys, but girls got in free! ScorelAnd
now were the women inside, you ask?
H-O-T-T. A curvy blonde was just fin
ishing up a Catholic schoolgirl routine
when we walked inside, we assumed
schoolgirl, cause all she was wearing
were black Mary Janes and a g-string,
yummy. As new strippers took the
stage, my women and I sat back and ob
served, ready to learn some new moves.
One tall, skinny black girl was particu
larly stunning in her canary yellow
thone. This girl could actually lift ner leg
over ner head and around her neck ...
while standing on one foot! Now, I did
try to do this nifty little number myself
when we got back to the hotel. People
tell me that the bruise on my head will
heal 500n...
But now kids, here comes the best
Eart of our strip club experience — the
,AP DANCE. The guys bought them
for us, and we girls were ready Tor some
serious action. Best of all, we were all
lap dance virgins. And boy, did we ever
get our cherries popped!
We picked out a dazzling stripper in
a blue corset with long, black, wavy hair
running down her back. This girl was
Absolutely Amazing... and to top it
off, she was British. She sat your darling
Roxy down in a chair and pulled up a
big silver block to dance up high. She
swung her hips, she ripped open her
corset, she rubbed her boons, she
turned around and bent over and put
her head between her legs, she strad
dled me... unbelievable!
And, best of all. this sexy stripper
pulled down Roxy s shirt and Kra ancl...
gasp... oh my God... sucked on my
nipple! Yes, boys. Feel free to get hard
at tnis point. I know that the guys who
were with us did! So, please people, the
next time you go to a strip clun, give
Roxy a call. I just might suck on some
thing next time!

for us, and we girls were ready Tor some
serious action. Best of all, we were all
lap dance virgins. And boy, did we ever
get our cherries popped!
We picked out a dazzling stripper in
a blue corset with long, black, wavy hair
running down her back. This girl was
Absolutely Amazing... and to top it
off, she was British. She sat your darling
Roxy down in a chair and pulled up a
big silver block to dance up high. She
swung her hips, she ripped open her
corset, she rubbed her boons, she
turned around and bent over and put
her head between her legs, she strad
dled me... unbelievable!
And, best of all. this sexy stripper
pulled down Roxy s shirt and Kra ancl...
gasp... oh my God... sucked on my
nipple! Yes, boys. Feel free to get hard
at tnis point. I know that the guys who
were with us did! So, please people, the
next time you go to a strip clun, give
Roxy a call. I just might suck on some
thing next time!
This past weekend. Miss Sass herself
took a field trip down south to the Big
Easy fora little par ty called Mardi Gras.
We're talkin' Bourbon Street, alcohol,
sweaty bodies, alcohol, glittering beads,
alcohol, flying boobs and, oh yeah, alco
hol. And what did Roxy find in the Sin
City of the deep South? Read on.
Now. I know that all you horny boys
out there with your tongues flopping on

the floor are just waiting to hear how
Roxy lifted her shirt ana flashed these
balconies of N'Awlins. Old men, ypung
men, tall men, sin jrt men, stout men—aß
shouting choruses of "Show your tits!
Show your tits!" But, sadly, no. Roxy
kept her boobies under wraps. What?
You really thought some sillv plastic
beads would incite Roxy to unleash her
bodacious tatas? No, sir. Not me. Never.
But wait, you have those beads with
the ducks that squeak on them? And,
what's that pair you're dangling now?

My ape-like attraction to shiny objects
just switched on overload! And, noly
crap, those beads over there are bigger
than my head! My eyes glaze over in
wonderment of so many pretty, shiny
dangly things... or maybe its just my
third Hurricane kicking'in. I must have
them, must have, must have the beads.
I reach up and touch my bra strap,
hold it gingerly between two fingers,
begin to slip it down my shoulder. The
shiny shiny beads are rocking in the air
before me, swinging back and forth, back
and forth, tantalizing, sexy, shiny, sexy,
big hard sexy beads ves! And then, one

of my girls taps me on the shoulder. "We
should make out for the beads!" she
whispers. Yes, yes, yes! A brilliant idea!
So, I am happy to say that my girl
friend and I are now the proud owners
of not only ducky beads nut squeaking
elephant beads, devil beads ana, oh yes,
the flashing beads. When we make out,
we make out!
Jostling our way through the sweaty
bodies on our second night of Bourbon,
my girls and I had a brilliant idea —
Hooters shirts. Yes, boys, you heard me
right. Hooters shirts. And let me tell
you, every gal needs one of these in her
closet. We made a little trip to the New
Orleans haven of buffalo wings and
bouncing boobies to purchase our very
own tiny tiny T"s. And I swear, these
shirts are magic! Something about the
design of these shirts actually lifts a girl's
melons up and thrusts them to her chin,
they are the wonderbras of t-shirts.
How come no one ever told us? The
crafty Hooters girls never let us in on
their secret. Those sluts.
Aimed in our hot Hooters ensem
bles, our puppies primed for jiggling and
admiration from the crowd, we set off on
our valiant crusade. I don't know what it
is about these shirts — I mean, I'm defi
nitely a girl who likes to show my ample
cleavage, and I own many shirts that are
just as low cut as this one was —but
there's just somethin' about a shirt having
the word "Hooters" across it in big or
ange bubble letters that drives every pass
ing man to stare, point, and veil, "Hoot
ers! HOOters! HooTERS! Hey, its
Hooter's girls!" Beads were flying,
breasts were flying, shots were bought...
we were all in a Hooters tizzy! One frat
boy come up to us, took all the beads off
of nis neck, and all he could do was shove
them in our direction and mouth "ALL
OF THEM!" When a lanky man in a
I bikers jersey walked by, he even stuffed
a dollar bill down dear Roxy's shirt.
Sweet! Cold hard cash! Even better than
those shinv beads!
And, Roxy asks, what is a trip to
Mardi Gras without a visit to a good,
old-fashioned strip club to soalk up
some of the culture? The first challenge
of our strip club escapade? Picking a
place. There are two strip clubs Tor
every block of Bourbon. And you can't

just go into the first one that you see. We
were on a quest for some quality
women... and some quality lap dances
(more on that later, wink).
So, my three girls and our two drool
ing boys canvassed the streets, checking
out the lobbies and sneaking peeks in
side the clubs. We finally decided on a
classy little joint called Rick's Cabaret.
Cover charge was twenty bucks for
guys, but girls got in free! ScorelAnd
now were the women inside, you ask?
H-O-T-T. A curvy blonde was just fin
ishing up a Catholic schoolgirl routine
when we walked inside, we assumed
schoolgirl, cause all she was wearing
were black Mary Janes and a g-string,
yummy. As new strippers took the
stage, my women and I sat back and ob
served, ready to learn some new moves.
One tall, skinny black girl was particu
larly stunning in her canary yellow
thone. This girl could actually lift ner leg
over ner head and around her neck ...
while standing on one foot! Now, I did
try to do this nifty little number myself
when we got back to the hotel. People
tell me that the bruise on my head will
heal 500n...
But now kids, here comes the best
