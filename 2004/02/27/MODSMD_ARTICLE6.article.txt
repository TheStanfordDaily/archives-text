# Lymphoma researchers awarded grants

### JANET YU 
The Lymphoma Research Foundation re
cently awarded two-year fellowships to Stan
ford School of Medicine postdoctoral scholars

Alice Fan, M.D.. and
Paul Norman, Ph.D, for
their research on the
common disease. Fan is
a third-year medical on
cology fellow and Nor
man is a first doctoral
research fellow. Each
will receive $50,000
during the first year of
the fellowship and
$55,000 during the sec
ond year.
"Both of these peo
ple are working in out
standing labs while
they're doing the re
search we're funding,"
said Lymphoma Re
search Foundation Ex
ecutive Director
Suzanne Bliss. "Both of
them seem to have po
tential not only to be
good researchers but
also leaders in their
field."
Lymphoma is a

tumor of white blood cells that divided uncon
trollably, resulting in swollen lymph nodes or
other organs that contain these white blood
cells. The gene myc tells the cell when it should
stop growing and dividing and the gene bcl-2
controls cell death. Levels in these genes are too
high in lymphoma patients, preventing cells
from dying. Fan is conducting research on
whether or not "turning off" myc alone, bcl-2
alone or both genes will help lymphoma tumors
shrink and eventually disappear.
Norman is researching accurate ways to find
suitable donors for bone marrow transplanta
tions in lymphoma patients. The most successful
therapy comes from either related or non-relat
ed donors, Norman said. For his project, Nor
man proposed working in conjunction with the
Stanford Genome Technology Center.
"It's quite an exciting new approach to this
problem," Norman said in regard to using new
genotyping techniques.
Earlier work under Fan's mentor, Asst. Prof.
Dean Felsher, M.D.. showed evidence that inac
tivating myc in mice causes lymphoma tumors to
regress. "Stanford has a big history of a strong
clinical basis in addition to research for treating
patients," Fan said. "And it is a center for treat
ing lymphoma."
Fan added, "I have had excellent mentors
throughout my training."
She said that these mentors include Felsher
and Dr. Ronald Levy, chairman of the oncology
division. She also mentioned that she learned

much from her colleagues, specifically Sylvie
Giuriato, who started the project and shared her
results and techniques with Fan. Giuriato and
Felsher have also received grants from the foun
dation in past years.
According to Bliss, the general public is
largely unaware of lymphoma and its diagnosis.
One of the foundation's aims is to provide pa
tients and their families with as much informa
tion as they can about what lymphoma is, how it
is treated and what options the patient has.
"We're very much into patient education and
support services for the patients, their families
and their friends," Bliss said.
Another purpose of the foundation is to fund
research in hopes of finding a cure for lymphoma.
Seven other recipients besides Fan and Nor
man were awarded the annual grants this year
by the foundation. The recipients were chosen
by the Lymphoma Research Foundation's Sci
entific Advisory Board. Bliss said. After re
viewing proposals, the board picked the top
ones based on quality of the science, its rele
vance to lymphoma and the quality of the lab in
which the research will be performed, according
to Bliss.
This is the first time that Fan or Norman have
received a grant. Norman said he will use the
grant money to buy new equipment and
reagents and to pay his staff's salary. Fan. mean
while, said she will use the money to purchase
research supplies, pay salary and travel to re
search meetings.
