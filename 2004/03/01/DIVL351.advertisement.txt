Stanford University will be celebrating
Founders' Day on April 4, 2004.
This day is reserved on the University calendar to reflect and pay tribute to the
Stanford family and to recognize their achievements in founding our University
that bears their name.
A highlight of the Founders' Day activities will be a speech from one
undergraduate student and one graduate student. President Hennessy has
decided to continue the tradition of providing each student speaker with a
$1,000 cash award in hopes of increasing student awareness and
participation in Day.
A Founders' Day student committee has developed a two-stage process to
determine which students will have the honor of speaking at Founders' Day. The
first stage requires each student to submit a written copy of the actual speech by
12 noon on March 5 to the Dean of Students Office (on the second floor of
Tresidder Memorial Union, above jamba Juice), or through e-mail at:
mgraves@stanford.edu.
The Founders' Day student committee will review all completed submissions
regarding content, and will then invite a small group of finalists to deliver their
speech in front of the committee as the second and final stage of the process.
Speech Criteria:
1. Speeches should not take more than five (5) minutes to deliver.
2. Speeches can address any of the following elements:
• Historical background of the Stanford family.
• Historical background of the founding of Stanford University.
• What Stanford means to you.
• How Stanford has impacted your life.
• How Stanford impacts the world.
Speeches will be judged on their overall content, judges will be looking for
interesting, creative, thoughtful, and passionate speeches.
Please contact Morris Graves at 3-2733 or mgraves@stanford if you have any
