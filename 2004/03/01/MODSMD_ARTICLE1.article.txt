### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a speech emphasizing the importance of intellectual property
rights. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan concluded an econom
ic summit on Friday held by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Re
search (SIEPR).
The summit, which featured prominent economists, businessmen and
policymakers from around the world, was the first of its kind conducted by
SIEPR. It held forums that addressed critical national issues, such as the
budget deficit and education spending, and key international issues such as
rising Asian economic powers and competition policy.
The conference culminated in Greenspan's speech to approximately 450
guests at the Arrillaga Alumni Center.
Greenspan's address focused on the importance of protecting intellectu
al property rights in America's current economy.
He started the speech by discussing the necessity of protecting property
rights in general and cited the American "Wild West" and former Soviet
Union as two cases in which a lack of property-rights protection led to eco
nomic disaster. But he noted that many current political leaders understand
this necessity.
"Leaders of [former Soviet states] recognize that their future economic
success will depend on an efficient and predictable rule of law," Greenspan
said.
He also stated that governments need to create a balance between rule
of law and trust between trading partners, which is especially important in
the realm of intellectual property.
"If our market system is to function smoothly, the vast majority of trades
must rest on mutual trust and only indirectly on the law," he said.
Greenspan then discussed the changing nature of the U.S. economy and
its effect on property rights. He pointed out that physical goods are becom
ing less important in an economy based on conceptualization.
"The total fraction of our economy that is essentially conceptual rather
than physical has been rising," he said.
This movement has led to a decrease in dependence on raw materials. He
specifically pointed out how substituting transistors for vacuum tubes has
reduced the size of radios. In turn, the economy become increasingly ser
vice-based, requiring little physical input.
The Internet has also made it easier for companies to market and dis
tribute goods with fewer production costs.
However, this economic change has also made intellectual property a
major issue that will need to be addressed by economists and policy makers.
"Conceptualization is irreversibly increasing the emphasis on the pro
tection of intellectual — relative to physical — property rights," he said.
He cited the example of calculus, developed by Gottfried Leibnitz and
Isaac Newton, as an intellectual tool that has been built upon over centuries.
Referencing this example, he asked, "Should we have protected their
claim in the same way that we do for owners of land? Or should the law
make their insights more freely available to those who would build on them,
with the aim of maximizing the wealth of society as a whole?"
While Greenspan did not directly answer the question, he did say that it
was crucial for society "to strike a balance between the interests of those
who innovate and those who would benefit from innovation."
He concluded, "We must begin
the important work of developing a
framework capable of analyzing the
growth of an economy increasingly
dominated by conceptual products."
After his speech, Greenspan

fielded questions for half an
hour.
The most frequent question he
was asked dealt with the outsourcing
of American jobs to Asia. To answer
this question, he responded to his
audience, which consisted primarily
of economists, "There are certain
audiences where questions like that
do not need an answer, and this is
one of those."
