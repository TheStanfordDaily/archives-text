## Consider state issues on Tuesday 
### 
The Democratic presidential primary is sure
ly the headine-grabbing item on Tuesday's
California primary election ballot. Howev
er. we encourage students to consider care
fully some of the less discussed issues that will be
voted on tomorrow.
The propositions:
Proposition 55 is a $12 billion bond issue to build
public education facilities from kindergarten to
university levels. The argument in favor is that
schools are overcrowded; the argument against is
that we should pay for them later because we can't
afford to now. Issuing bonds for school infrastruc
ture is generally not thought of as a very controver
sial issue, and students should consider supporting
this proposition.
Proposition 56 addresses part of the reason for
California's fiscal mess: either party can block leg
islation. The Republicans can block tax increases
and the Democrats can block cuts in higher educa
tion and healthcare, and each can point fingers at
the other. Fed up with their legislators, voters dis
covered it was easier to pass propositions than to
get bills through the deadlocked assembly. Howev
er, government by plebiscite has only exacerbated
the more-spending-less-taxes situation. This
proposition would reduce the voting threshold for
spending bills from 66 percent to 55 percent (in
most states it is anything over 50 percent) and
would put a hold on legislators' salaries until a bud
get is passed, which we support.
Proposition 57 issues a one-time $15 billion bond
to pay off our current debts and deficits. While pay
ing for our current expenditures by accumulating
debt is not the best idea, the current legislature offers
little hope fora "plan B," and thus, bankruptcy is a
real — and unattractive — possibility if this proposi
tion does not pass.
Proposition 58 would establish a reserve fund
and require future budgets to be balanced, elimi
nating the need to issue more debt in the future.
Props. 57 and 58 are a package deal: if either is
voted down, neither becomes law. While there is a
strong argument for allowing the federal govern
ment to run deficits in recessions, in our view,
there is not a very strong argument against bal
anced budgets for states.
Democratic candidates for state senate:
Our senate district is gerrymandered safe for
Democrats. The candidates, Joe Simitian and Ted
Lempert, agree on almost all issues and are fighting
hard to invest in schools and protect the environ
ment. The main issue between them — Lempert's
acceptance of public campaign financing — has lit
tle salience because his allies have pumped soft
money into the race through unregulated issue-ad
vocacy loopholes. The Stanford Democrats and the

California Democratic Party have both endorsed
Simitian, arguing that he will he a more effective
advocate for Democratic values. Simitian also has
won University backing for his active support of
campus causes in recent years, such as work with
the Students of Color Coalition against Proposition
54. Though he has since apologized, Lempert is
criticized for dirty campaigning, including attacks
on current Congresswoman Anna Eshoo that were
deemed false in a citation by the California ethics
board.
Democratic candidates for state assembly:
Running to replace Simitian in the assembly are
four candidates: Palo Alto school board member
John Barton: 28-year old Redwood City attorney
John Carcione; Los Gatos Town Council member
Barbara Nesbet; and Redwood City council member
and former mayor Ira Ruskin. None of the candi
dates are very well known outside their respective
cities. This district is conventionally thought safe for
Democrats, but Steve Poizner — a socially moder
ate Silicon Valley millionaire, public school teacher,
former White House fellow and Stanford GSB grad
uate — is running unopposed in the GOP primary.
The Stanford Democrats have endorsed Barton;
Ruskin is slightly ahead in the polls, but the race
could go to any of them.
Republican candidates for U.S. Senate:
The almost certain winner. Bill Jones is up 30 per
cent in the polls and and has won the endorsements
of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Stanford
Republicans. Secretary of state from 1994 to 2002,
Jones is best known for authoring the three strikes
law providing mandatory minimum sentences for re
peat felons. The main worry is whether Jones, a for
mer cattle rancher, is the candidate best able to chal
lenge Sen. Barbara Boxer in November.
The self-billed "traditional conservative" in the
race, Howard Kaloogian is the most pro-life candi
date in the race and has taken the strongest stances
against gay marriage. A pro-choice Hispanic
woman who worked her way out of poverty,
Rosario Marin has a biography to challenge the
Democrats. Unfortunately her political resume is
awfully thin and she lacks the name recognition to
compete effectively. Stanford alumnus (MS, MBA)
Toni Casey's main campaign issue is that Bill Jones
was not tough enough on taxes or fighting immigra
tion. She is pro-choice.
Where to vote:
Your voting location depends on what precinct
you are in, and should be indicated on the voter in
formation you were sent by the state. There are four
voting locations on campus: FloMo, Faisan House
(Precinct 2539), Wilbur Hall Screening Room
(2542), El Centro Lounge (2543) and Quillen House
Lounge (2544).
