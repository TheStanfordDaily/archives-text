## Kerry says: Elvis still dead? 
### 
This column shall serve as
an open "WTF mates" let
ter to both John Kerry and
the South as a last ditch
plea before Super Tuesday. Let me
elaborate.
This year's State of the Union
was nothing short of a moment of
glowing pride for any real Mas
sachusettsian — but not because of
what was said in the speech. Let's be
honest, anything a Texan cowboy
says that makes John Ashcroft and
Don Rumsfeld radiate giddy school
girl smiles is not likely to tickle the
residents of the only state that voted
for George McGovern instead of
Nixon in 1972.
So if it wasn't a barrage of liber
al policy proposals, what could
please residents of such a Demo
cratic bastion?
None other than the sight of a
ruddy Ted Kennedy disgustedly
shaking his head at each bewilder
ing statement emanating from
George W. Bush's mouth. (Strange
ly, if you access the video version of
the State of the Union from the
White House Web site, their film ex
cludes the shots of Kennedy that
where aired on network television.
Shocker.)
If ever there was a symbol for the
essence of Massachusetts (minus
the alcohol and manslaughter), who
could trump this eight-term senator
who stands his ground as a lightning
rod for criticism from the wicked
heartless conservative establish
ment? That night, Ted Kennedy
broadcast to the country what the
Bay State is all about: being un
abashedly liberal and goddammit,
being right.
Or at least that's what everyone
seems to think — maybe not simply
about Ted Kennedy's State of the
Union antics, but about Mas
sachusetts politicians in general.
They're all just left-wing patricians.
Sure, maybe seeing Teddy K stick it
to the Bushmeister warmed hearts
from Worchester (Wuh-stir) to
Waltham, but these guys could
never be national politicians. JFK

was simply an anomaly and the
South is still pissed it lost the Civil
War, so it won't stand for any of

these damn Yan
kees rolling up to
1600 Pennsylva
nia Ave.
But more than
that, they are
boring and elitist.
Stiff. Self-righ
teous. Out of
touch with the
common man.
Their fathers

didn't work in mills because they're
all damn intellectuals. And, as Dan
Rather might imply, they really just
don't have enough "Elvis."
Maybe this explains what the hell
has happened to John Kerry.
Back in the day, he and Teddy K
functioned as a rather decent one
two tag-team duo. Kerry did serve
as (right-wingers, for the love of a
benevolent god, cover your eyes)
Michael Dukakis' lieutenant gover
nor, and Americans for Democratic
Action gave Kerry a 93 percent ap
proval rating — beating out Ted
Kennedy's 88 percent. The National
Journal tagged Kerry the most liber
al senator in 2003 based on his vot
ing record; John Edwards was
fourth.
So one of several things is hap
pening: either this new JFK (Kerry's
middle name is Forbes) has been
misconstrued for years, or he's hav
ing an identity crisis.
During yesterday's Democratic
debate, the last before tomorrow's
decisive round of primaries, Kerry
called the Journal's rating "abso
lutely the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen in my life." Hedging on
the moderator's question of "are
you a liberal," Kerry alternately
challenged the Journal's methods
and tried to convince viewers that
he was a conservative.
Along with Kerry's seesaw
esque trade policy and recent sup
port for an amendment to the Mas
sachusetts state constitution ban
ning gay marriage — despite being

one of only 14 senators to vote
against the 1996 federal Defense of
Marriage Act — the last several
weeks of campaigning in duck boots
and escalated use of the word
"man," as elucidated in last week's
New York Times, have left would
be loyal Kerry supporters thinking,
"... ho-kay?"
That said, John Kerry has not re
ally ever held the legendary, or, out
side of New England, infamous, po
litical role of Ted Kennedy as the
enduring symbol — and stereotype
— of Massachusetts liberal politics.
But in a beat-Bush-or-bust election,
the word seems to be unmistakable:
come across in any way as one of
those New England politicians that
anyone who hates A-Rod loves and
you might as well go pick out the
wood for your casket.
So this puts your New Englandite
in quite the predicament. Do they
accept that their old-school liberal
may have to morph out of his Mas
sachusetts mold to compete in states
where seeing a gun store isn't as rare
as good food at Lag? Or do they hold
him to what he represented from the
start (if that can be deciphered)?
Probably some combination of
the two would be reasonable. It is
unlikely that any candidate can es
pouse the same platform in a nation
al presidential election as in a Mas
sachusetts senate race and hope to
get... anywhere.
But eventually someone is going
to have to work to buck the popular
impression that, on the national
stage, New England politicians are
destined to the periphery.
So far we've tried out the cowboy
and are on the verge of seeing the
European action hero, and we all
know how well that's worked.
Maybe having a slightly stiff in
tellectual running this country
wouldn't be the end of the world.

Michael Dukakis' lieutenant gover
nor, and Americans for Democratic
Action gave Kerry a 93 percent ap
proval rating — beating out Ted
Kennedy's 88 percent. The National
Journal tagged Kerry the most liber
al senator in 2003 based on his vot
ing record; John Edwards was
fourth.
So one of several things is hap
pening: either this new JFK (Kerry's
middle name is Forbes) has been
misconstrued for years, or he's hav
ing an identity crisis.
During yesterday's Democratic
debate, the last before tomorrow's
decisive round of primaries, Kerry
called the Journal's rating "abso
lutely the most ridiculous thing I've
ever seen in my life." Hedging on
the moderator's question of "are
you a liberal," Kerry alternately
challenged the Journal's methods
and tried to convince viewers that
he was a conservative.
Along with Kerry's seesaw
esque trade policy and recent sup
port for an amendment to the Mas
sachusetts state constitution ban
ning gay marriage — despite being

one of only 14 senators to vote
against the 1996 federal Defense of
Marriage Act — the last several
weeks of campaigning in duck boots
and escalated use of the word
"man," as elucidated in last week's
New York Times, have left would
be loyal Kerry supporters thinking,
"... ho-kay?"
That said, John Kerry has not re
ally ever held the legendary, or, out
side of New England, infamous, po
litical role of Ted Kennedy as the
enduring symbol — and stereotype
— of Massachusetts liberal politics.
But in a beat-Bush-or-bust election,
the word seems to be unmistakable:
come across in any way as one of
those New England politicians that
anyone who hates A-Rod loves and
you might as well go pick out the
wood for your casket.
So this puts your New Englandite
in quite the predicament. Do they
accept that their old-school liberal
may have to morph out of his Mas
sachusetts mold to compete in states
where seeing a gun store isn't as rare
as good food at Lag? Or do they hold
him to what he represented from the
start (if that can be deciphered)?
Probably some combination of
the two would be reasonable. It is
unlikely that any candidate can es
pouse the same platform in a nation
al presidential election as in a Mas
sachusetts senate race and hope to
get... anywhere.
But eventually someone is going
to have to work to buck the popular
impression that, on the national
stage, New England politicians are
destined to the periphery.
So far we've tried out the cowboy
and are on the verge of seeing the
European action hero, and we all
know how well that's worked.
Maybe having a slightly stiff in
tellectual running this country
wouldn't be the end of the world.

This column shall serve as
an open "WTF mates" let
ter to both John Kerry and
the South as a last ditch
plea before Super Tuesday. Let me
elaborate.
This year's State of the Union
was nothing short of a moment of
glowing pride for any real Mas
sachusettsian — but not because of
what was said in the speech. Let's be
honest, anything a Texan cowboy
says that makes John Ashcroft and
Don Rumsfeld radiate giddy school
girl smiles is not likely to tickle the
residents of the only state that voted
for George McGovern instead of
Nixon in 1972.
So if it wasn't a barrage of liber
al policy proposals, what could
please residents of such a Demo
cratic bastion?
None other than the sight of a
ruddy Ted Kennedy disgustedly
shaking his head at each bewilder
ing statement emanating from
George W. Bush's mouth. (Strange
ly, if you access the video version of
the State of the Union from the
White House Web site, their film ex
cludes the shots of Kennedy that
where aired on network television.
Shocker.)
If ever there was a symbol for the
essence of Massachusetts (minus
the alcohol and manslaughter), who
could trump this eight-term senator
who stands his ground as a lightning
rod for criticism from the wicked
heartless conservative establish
ment? That night, Ted Kennedy
broadcast to the country what the
Bay State is all about: being un
abashedly liberal and goddammit,
being right.
Or at least that's what everyone
seems to think — maybe not simply
about Ted Kennedy's State of the
Union antics, but about Mas
sachusetts politicians in general.
They're all just left-wing patricians.
Sure, maybe seeing Teddy K stick it
to the Bushmeister warmed hearts
from Worchester (Wuh-stir) to
Waltham, but these guys could
never be national politicians. JFK

was simply an anomaly and the
South is still pissed it lost the Civil
War, so it won't stand for any of

these damn Yan
kees rolling up to
1600 Pennsylva
nia Ave.
But more than
that, they are
boring and elitist.
Stiff. Self-righ
teous. Out of
touch with the
common man.
Their fathers

didn't work in mills because they're
all damn intellectuals. And, as Dan
Rather might imply, they really just
don't have enough "Elvis."
Maybe this explains what the hell
has happened to John Kerry.
