# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Why I can't give tours anymore 
### 
I used to give visitors tours of
our fine University. I used to
guide prospective students
and their parents around
this beautiful campus, revealing
to them the thrills and opportuni
ties available at Stanford. Most
of all, I used to bring them joy.
But now, the University won't let
me. They claim that my tours are
"too alternative," "weird" and
"devoid of any real information
or pants."
To them I say: BAH!
They claim that I'm not the best
face Stanford wants to show the
world. If they want a Brad Pitt, I'm
more like a Quasimodo; maybe
they think that getting to know me
would make anyone want to attend
another school. These cannot be the
true reasons. Logically, I've sur
mised that they see me as a threat to
their little institution. They're wor
ried I'll spill the beans on some se
crets the University wants buried —
like the student disappearances in
the steam tunnel system and the
real reason Tresidder is closed on
weekends.
So reader, let me prove to you
how adept a tour guide I am. I've
had hundreds of tourists ask me
questions. I have not only been
friendly and knowledgeable, but
also have dated several people I've
had on my tours.
The most common question I got
was about campus safety. To this I
usually replied: "Crime at Stan
ford? This is the safest campus on
the face of the earth ... wait, what
are you planning?" I'd then call se
curity. We've been taught to call se
curity whenever we think there is
suspicious activity afoot. Anyone
who is asking about security is obvi
ously up to something.
I'm sure you've been on a college
tour or two. You've probably heard
this question before: "What's the al
cohol policy at Stanford?" Did you
ever wish you could just smack the
people who ask that? Well, as a tour

guide connoisseur, I know you just
can't do that. It disrupts the friendly
atmosphere of the tour, and most

profros get pretty
upset when you
level their par
ents with a right
hook. So I came
up with a better
approach. I
would just look
these question
ing people (usu
ally overbearing
parents) in the

eye and say, "Our alcohol policy
gives jobs to Americans and keeps
the commies down! So don't you
question it again!"
I'd then call security. Another
family Stanford could do without.
Sometimes we get asked ques
tions we simply can't answer. These
are the questions that test the
adaptability of the guide. They
make you think on your toes. But
I'm adaptable, even when asked
questions like "What is the average
salary of a graduate?" or "How
does that compare with the average
salary of someone who majored in
English?" or, the always impossi
ble. "Why don't you listen to your
mother and major in something
useful for God's sakes!?"
Silly tourists.
Every tour guide personalizes
the tour in his or her own special
way. Tour guides highlight things
that aren't on the prescribed tour,
such as their dorm or their favorite
building. I did better than that, be
cause I'd sprinkle the tour with per
sonal touches.
I liked to describe really
monotonous details about my life
and more specifically, where they
occurred. I used to point out the
spot where some guy cut me off on a
bike and I stood there for like five
minutes gasping for life and how
that was the closest thing I had ever
had to a near death experience.
Other tour highlights have includ-

Ed: where I called my parents from,
where was the last time I saw that
girl I had a crush on and the various
places I've parked my bike... in
chronological order. Incidentally,
my tours are a good two hours
longer than others. That's school
dedication for you!
Now, we tour guides — because
once again, I am a tour guide —
have also had experience seeing
other college tours. Through my
tour guide expertise, I've found that
the tour guide is on trial as much as
the school. A crappy tour guide
leads to a bad college visit experi
ence. Thus, for most tours I arrived
in my underpants. They said "Stan
ford" on them. I think. Except for
that one time. The one time they
were in the wash. Yeah, I don't
think anyone from that tour applied
here.
Old friends of mine used to
bark like dogs when they saw tour
groups come by. Seriously. No,
they were not barking at the
women in some ritualistic sexist
hounding. They were simply try
ing to scare the tour groups. Their
philosophy was: If the tourists
don't laugh at our antics, they
shouldn't come to the college. My
antics are all in a similar vein — I
can weed out the characters we
don't want attending our fine up
standing University. If they don't
think the tour is funny and awe
some, they can go someplace else,
like Harvard. Now that I've been
fired, I think it's a real shame that
the admissions office is excluding
me from excluding prospective
students. If I'm not here to sort
out the sea of applicants, who else
is going to make sure the incoming
class is awesome?

C hris Holt never was a tour guide,
but would love to give it a try. E-mail
him at cholt@stanford.edu for ap
pointments. His column appears
every Monday. Except for Dead
Week, cause he's union.
