# OP-ED
## Nader's campaign will hurt Democrats more than Bush 
### BRANDON LIVERENCE 
In a recent op-ed ("Nader's campaign is a good thing
for the Democratic Party," Feb. 24) in The Stanford Daily,
Galen Panger asserts that Ralph Nader's recent decision
to run for president is a good thing for the Democratic
Party. By Panger's calculation. Democrats everywhere
should be rejoicing. However, after three years of a Bush
administration — handed to us in part by Nader — it's
hard to see what exactly we should be rejoicing about.
As Panger asserts, it is true that a wider variety of lib
eral voices, such as Howard Dean and Nader's, that high
light the shortcomings of the Bush administration can only
be a good thing. But the difference between Nader and the
nine candidates who ran for the Democratic nomination is
that, ultimately, only one of those nine will be nominated
to compete against President George W. Bush. The rest
will align behind the Democratic nominee and throw in
their support for defeating Bush. By contrast, if Nader
runs, he will directly challenge the Democratic nominee
for votes, as he did in the 2000 elections.
Nader could criticize Bush even if he weren't running
for president by backing the Democratic nominee or tak
ing a grassroots approach similar to what Dean has sug
gested he will do. Nader's choice to run in this election
raises the question of whether it is his desire to advance
liberal causes or his ego that truly motivates him. Addi
tionally, the decision exposes Nader's most conspicuous
political shortcoming: his sheer inability to compromise.
Nader ignored pleas from Democratic party leaders, such
as Democratic national chairman Terry McAuliffe, who
urged him not to run, which isn't particularly surprising

given Nader's opposition to mainstream politics. What is
surprising is that he decided to run despite significant op
position from his own supporters. By running, he risks
dooming the causes he has fought so hard for in the past by
angering the base of supporters that would have voted for
him in future elections.
In a recent interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," Tim
Russert asked Nader if he would drop out of the race if, to
ward the end, it looked like he could swing the election in
Bush's favor. Nader gave no firm answer, instead asserting
that in the rare event that this did occur, he would return
to Russert's show to give him the answer. It is difficult to
believe that Nader's memory is so poor. What happened
in 200() could easily happen again in 2004.
Nader has repeatedly asserted that his bid for the pres
idency in 2000 was not responsible for then-Vice President
A1 Gore's loss. He suggested that most of the votes he
claimed in 2000, and will claim this year, are from "con
servatives and independents who are very upset with Bush
administration policies," rather than Democrats. Yet, exit
polls in 2000 showed that 45 percent of Nader voters
across all states would have voted for Gore and only 27
percent would have voted for Bush had they been the only
two candidates.
Gore lost Florida by 537 votes in 2000. It is lunacy to
suggest that had Nader conceded after realizing how close
the 2000 election was, most of the 97,488 citizens who
voted for him in Florida would have voted for Bush or
stayed at home instead. As we are all aware, he chose to
stay in the race and no one should doubt that history could
repeat itself in 2004, with another incredibly close race on
the horizon.

Nader has correctly asserted that in 40 states, the
Democrat and Republican votes are secure (contrary to
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's opinion, California is def
initely one of those states). Nader could most likely run in
any of these states without influencing the outcome of the
election. It is in key swing states such Michigan and Flori
da where Nader could potentially cause the most damage.
While Kerry may be leading Bush in some national polls.
Bush has a war chest of over $170 million to draw upon in
the coming months to convince Independents in those
swing states to re-elect him, and Nader's presence on the
ballots of any of those states could hand Bush victory
once again.
Panger asserts that Nader can be a force for positive
change for the Democrats. Yet, Nader argues that the
Democrats are no better than the Republicans — that
Democrats, like Republicans, "take orders from corpo
rate paymasters," and that Democrats have brought the
country "ten years of losses." By staying in the 2000 elec
tion, Nader proved that he didn't care whether a Demo
crat or a Republican won the presidency, so long as he re
ceived the five percent of the vote required for him to re
ceive federal campaign funding in 2004. In fact, had Nader
succeeded in winning his 5 percent, it would have been in
his best interest for Bush to take the presidency because
he wouldn't have had to compete for votes against a strong
incumbent Democrat in 2004. Do I still think Nader is out
to get Democrats? To quote the well-worn adage: "With
friends like that, who needs enemies?"
I believe that what Nader has fought for in the past
and continues to fight for today is a legitimate and funda
mentally good cause: A national voice for alternative po

litical groups and an end to the "two-party duopoly" in
American politics. The extreme polarization inherent in
America's two-party system forces many to choose a
party that at best approximates their own views. Simulta
neously, political views that fail to reflect what a majority
within either party believes are often marginalized. But
Nader's struggle is an ongoing one, and its proper place is
in an extended dialogue about the structure of our politi
cal system. It is not a pressing and immediate issue in the
same sense as electing a president who will advance liber
al causes, improve the nation's standing in the world and
repair the economy.
Further, if Nader failed to win five percent in 2000,
when he was still backed by the Greens and wasn't de
spised by (most of) liberal America, he has no chance of
winning five percent this year as an independent. The re
sponsible thing for Mr. Nader to do is sit this one out.
Then, he should run again in a year when the vote is fairly
secure for the Democrats, or at least in a year when the
Republican opposition isn't a fiscally irresponsible war
monger who potentially has the ability to appoint several
new U.S. Supreme Court justices — justices who are
themselves in a position to make monumental rulings on a
woman's right to choose, the legality of the death penalty,
gay marriage, affirmative action and countless other issues
for the next 40 years.
Personally, I'd rather not wait until the final days of
the election to find out if Nader has learned the difference
between Democrats and Republicans.

to get Democrats? To quote the well-worn adage: "With
friends like that, who needs enemies?"
I believe that what Nader has fought for in the past
and continues to fight for today is a legitimate and funda
mentally good cause: A national voice for alternative po

litical groups and an end to the "two-party duopoly" in
American politics. The extreme polarization inherent in
America's two-party system forces many to choose a
party that at best approximates their own views. Simulta
neously, political views that fail to reflect what a majority
within either party believes are often marginalized. But
Nader's struggle is an ongoing one, and its proper place is
in an extended dialogue about the structure of our politi
cal system. It is not a pressing and immediate issue in the
same sense as electing a president who will advance liber
al causes, improve the nation's standing in the world and
repair the economy.
Further, if Nader failed to win five percent in 2000,
when he was still backed by the Greens and wasn't de
spised by (most of) liberal America, he has no chance of
winning five percent this year as an independent. The re
sponsible thing for Mr. Nader to do is sit this one out.
Then, he should run again in a year when the vote is fairly
secure for the Democrats, or at least in a year when the
Republican opposition isn't a fiscally irresponsible war
monger who potentially has the ability to appoint several
new U.S. Supreme Court justices — justices who are
themselves in a position to make monumental rulings on a
woman's right to choose, the legality of the death penalty,
gay marriage, affirmative action and countless other issues
for the next 40 years.
Personally, I'd rather not wait until the final days of
the election to find out if Nader has learned the difference
between Democrats and Republicans.

In a recent op-ed ("Nader's campaign is a good thing
for the Democratic Party," Feb. 24) in The Stanford Daily,
Galen Panger asserts that Ralph Nader's recent decision
to run for president is a good thing for the Democratic
Party. By Panger's calculation. Democrats everywhere
should be rejoicing. However, after three years of a Bush
administration — handed to us in part by Nader — it's
hard to see what exactly we should be rejoicing about.
As Panger asserts, it is true that a wider variety of lib
eral voices, such as Howard Dean and Nader's, that high
light the shortcomings of the Bush administration can only
be a good thing. But the difference between Nader and the
nine candidates who ran for the Democratic nomination is
that, ultimately, only one of those nine will be nominated
to compete against President George W. Bush. The rest
will align behind the Democratic nominee and throw in
their support for defeating Bush. By contrast, if Nader
runs, he will directly challenge the Democratic nominee
for votes, as he did in the 2000 elections.
Nader could criticize Bush even if he weren't running
for president by backing the Democratic nominee or tak
ing a grassroots approach similar to what Dean has sug
gested he will do. Nader's choice to run in this election
raises the question of whether it is his desire to advance
liberal causes or his ego that truly motivates him. Addi
tionally, the decision exposes Nader's most conspicuous
political shortcoming: his sheer inability to compromise.
Nader ignored pleas from Democratic party leaders, such
as Democratic national chairman Terry McAuliffe, who
urged him not to run, which isn't particularly surprising

given Nader's opposition to mainstream politics. What is
surprising is that he decided to run despite significant op
position from his own supporters. By running, he risks
dooming the causes he has fought so hard for in the past by
angering the base of supporters that would have voted for
him in future elections.
In a recent interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," Tim
Russert asked Nader if he would drop out of the race if, to
ward the end, it looked like he could swing the election in
Bush's favor. Nader gave no firm answer, instead asserting
that in the rare event that this did occur, he would return
to Russert's show to give him the answer. It is difficult to
believe that Nader's memory is so poor. What happened
in 200() could easily happen again in 2004.
Nader has repeatedly asserted that his bid for the pres
idency in 2000 was not responsible for then-Vice President
A1 Gore's loss. He suggested that most of the votes he
claimed in 2000, and will claim this year, are from "con
servatives and independents who are very upset with Bush
administration policies," rather than Democrats. Yet, exit
polls in 2000 showed that 45 percent of Nader voters
across all states would have voted for Gore and only 27
percent would have voted for Bush had they been the only
two candidates.
Gore lost Florida by 537 votes in 2000. It is lunacy to
suggest that had Nader conceded after realizing how close
the 2000 election was, most of the 97,488 citizens who
voted for him in Florida would have voted for Bush or
stayed at home instead. As we are all aware, he chose to
stay in the race and no one should doubt that history could
repeat itself in 2004, with another incredibly close race on
the horizon.

Nader has correctly asserted that in 40 states, the
Democrat and Republican votes are secure (contrary to
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's opinion, California is def
initely one of those states). Nader could most likely run in
any of these states without influencing the outcome of the
election. It is in key swing states such Michigan and Flori
da where Nader could potentially cause the most damage.
While Kerry may be leading Bush in some national polls.
Bush has a war chest of over $170 million to draw upon in
the coming months to convince Independents in those
swing states to re-elect him, and Nader's presence on the
ballots of any of those states could hand Bush victory
once again.
Panger asserts that Nader can be a force for positive
change for the Democrats. Yet, Nader argues that the
Democrats are no better than the Republicans — that
Democrats, like Republicans, "take orders from corpo
rate paymasters," and that Democrats have brought the
country "ten years of losses." By staying in the 2000 elec
tion, Nader proved that he didn't care whether a Demo
crat or a Republican won the presidency, so long as he re
ceived the five percent of the vote required for him to re
ceive federal campaign funding in 2004. In fact, had Nader
succeeded in winning his 5 percent, it would have been in
his best interest for Bush to take the presidency because
he wouldn't have had to compete for votes against a strong
incumbent Democrat in 2004. Do I still think Nader is out
to get Democrats? To quote the well-worn adage: "With
friends like that, who needs enemies?"
