## No. 1 Stanford closes down Maples in style on Senior Day 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"From here on out we're on the road.
We're road warriors now," said Stanford head
coach Mike Montgomery after the No. 1 Car
dinal's 76-55 victory over Oregon at Maples
Pavilion.
Saturday's game — Saturday's win — rep
resented a lot of things. It was a farewell to
Maples (the building will undergo a $30 mil
lion renovation beginning today), a goodbye
to three Stanford seniors and one more win in
the midst of a history-making season with
plenty of games left to play.
After the final buzzer sounded. Pacific-10
Conference Champion hats and shirts were
handed out to the Stanford team (25-0, 16-0
Pac-10) as members rushed out to celebrate
with the Sixth Man Club. The win, Stanford's
25th, extended "the streak" and culminated a
perfect home season for the Cardinal (only
the third undefeated home season in 35 years
at Maples).
And on Saturday, on Senior Day, it was all
about the elders, literally, as a group of three

Stanford yell leaders circa 1940 draped in
cream-colored letter sweaters led the Sixth
Man Club in a chant of "Give 'em The Axe"
midway through the second half and, in a cer
emony preceding the game, three Cardinal se
niors — Justin Davis, Joe Kirchofer and Matt
Lottich — were honored in what would be
their final game at Maples.
Kirchofer got his second-career start be
cause of the Senior Day festivities. Junior cen
ter and regular starter Rob Little called Mont
gomery on Friday and asked that Kirchofer
start in his place, that Kirchofer "deserved it."
And Kirchofer spoke to Montgomery on his
own later that day, telling his coach that he
was fine with his role off the bench and didn't
need to start on Saturday.
"That to me spoke volumes about our bas
ketball team and what's important," Mont
gomery said.
Montgomery, who was afraid to change the
starting lineup because he felt it served to di
minish Kirchofer's role as a Stanford reserve,
had a change of heart. Kirchofer scored a ca
reer-high in both points and rebounds, scoring
13 points and grabbing 10 boards in his final

game at Maples.
Stanford's win over the Ducks (12-11,7-9)
was the last time the Cardinal would see
Maples before the facelift — the last time any
one would run up and down on those bouncy
floors, the final time the Sixth Man Club
would cheer Stanford on in mass this season.
The Cardinal will move daily practices to Ford
Center for the remainder of the season and
their locker rooms will be moved into trailers.
"The kids are packing up to get out of the
building," said Montgomery of the move.
"[We] are excited [to win the title] but we've
got business left."
And Stanford was all business on Saturday,
despite a slow offensive start by both teams.
After three minutes of up-and-down play, ju
nior forward Nick Robinson scored the
game's first point. The free throw began a 13-
0 Stanford run, which culminated when
sophomore point guard Chris Hernandez hit a
deep pull-up three-pointer from the top of the
key.
Oregon rallied back, countering with a 12-

Joe Kirchofer and shooting guard Matt Lottich in the No. 1 Cardinal's final home game of the season. With a 76-55 win over Oregon,
Stanford extended its winning streak to 25 consecutive games and remains one of only two unbeaten teams in the country.
