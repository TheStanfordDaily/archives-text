# Childress shines in home closer
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For Stanford seniors — Matt Lottich, Joe Kirchofer and the injured
Justin Davis — the last game at Maples Pavilion was a time to reflect, re
member and rejoice. But it was a junior — Josh Childress — who stole the
show in what Stanford fans are hoping was not his last game on the Farm.
After the buzzer sounded, a ceremony honored the three seniors for their
collegiate careers. No one wanted to think about whether Childress would
opt to cut his time short and enter the NBA draft after this season — least of
all, Childress, himself.
"I don't want to lose focus on what we're doing right now," he said.
"That's something that can wait until the end of the season. Me thinking
about that is losing focus, so I can't do that."
The Sixth Man Club crowd seemed to feel the same way. After all the se
niors had been properly cheered, Childress ran over and jumped into the
Sixth Man section, getting mobbed by the crowd in a show of mutual appre
ciation. Everyone went nuts, but the enthusiasm dissipated when a few stu
dents started up a chant of "One more year!" aimed at the star junior.
It may have been the place, but it wasn't the time.
True, it was the end of a perfect undefeated season on Stanford's home
court. But it was also the beginning of a new chapter, one that will determine
how — and whether — this Cardinal team will be remembered by history.
And judging by his recent performances, Childress might turn out to be the
main character.
Stanford is generally known to be the team without a star. But on Satur
day, playing against Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Year candidate
Luke Jackson, Childress was clearly the best player on the court.
Jackson is Oregon's go-to player, the team's leader in points, re
bounds and assists. In Stanford's 76-55 win, Childress topped him in all
three categories.
"That was a great performance tonight," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery of Childress' play. "You know, that's the kind of impact you
need fJosh] to have as you head toward the end of the season."
Not only did Childress pile up 29
points, 12 rebounds, 5 assists and 3
blocks, but his defense also frustrat
ed Jackson, the only Duck who can
consistently create his own scoring
opportunities. Jackson led his team
with 18 points but made just 6-of-18
shots from the field. Childress was
10-of-16 and 4-of-6 from 3-point
range.
His dominance inspired Kir
chofer to say that he would vote for
Childress for Pac-10 Player of the
Year. Wouldn't that imply that he is
also the Cardinal's star player?
Not necessarily, Montgomery
said. He acknowledged that Chil
dress is deserving of consideration
for the conference honor. But he
said a case could also be made for
point guard Chris Hernandez, Lot
tich or even utility player extraordi
naire Nick Robinson. If Davis were
healthy, Montgomery might add
him to the list, as well.
All good players, to be sure. On
other teams, any might be a star. Or,
perhaps, none would be — maybe
it's the way they work together at
Stanford that makes them all better.
Montgomery hinted as much in his
assessment of Childress's role on the
team.
"It would really help for him to be
consistently good," Montgomery
said when asked whether Childress
was capable of this type of domi
nance on a regular basis. "But I don't
want it to be a situation where we're
always looking to Josh. We need it to
be equal opportunity."
If equal opportunity sometimes
yields unequal results, that's one
thing. Against Southern California
on Feb. 19, every Cardinal starter
but Childress tried to score and

failed. So Childress took over, scor
ing 36 points and forcing USC's de
fense to adjust and open up opportu
nities for Lottich and other Stanford
scorers.
But neither Childress nor Mont
gomery wants the offense to revolve
around a single player. The Cardinal
posted some of its most impressive
wins in the non-conference season,
when Childress was out with an in
jury. That was the period during
which the team developed the chem
istry and balance that has resulted in
success throughout the year.
Childress said he doesn't think
his recent offensive explosions
threaten that delicate equation.
"I've just been trying to be ag
gressive and attack the basket and
open things up for my teammates,"
he said.
On defense, the aspect of the
game where Stanford shines the
brightest, it is true that the Cardinal
doesn't have a single star. On Satur
day, Childress's hard work on Jack
son was impressive. But Robinson
was equally good against the Oregon
standout, and the play of Hernan
dez, Lottich and junior center Rob
Little were equally important in
holding the Ducks to their lowest
point total of the year.
Still, there is a reason why Chil
dress is the one that fans are worried
might leave school early to play pro
fessionally.
As important as Little, Hernan
dez and Robinson are to Stanford's
team, no one is talking about them
bolting for the draft.
As wonderful as Lottich, Davis
and Kirchofer have been over the
past four years (five, in the case of
both Davis and Kirchofer), none is
regarded as highly as Childress by
pro scouts.
Montgomery has said in the past
that he doesn't think it's a good idea
for student athletes to leave school
early, with one exception: If they
have the potential to be a top-10
pick, he can see why that would be
hard to turn down.
