# Childress shines in home closer
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For Stanford seniors — Matt Lottich, Joe Kirchofer and the injured
Justin Davis — the last game at Maples Pavilion was a time to reflect, re
member and rejoice. But it was a junior — Josh Childress — who stole the
show in what Stanford fans are hoping was not his last game on the Farm.
After the buzzer sounded, a ceremony honored the three seniors for their
collegiate careers. No one wanted to think about whether Childress would
opt to cut his time short and enter the NBA draft after this season — least of
all, Childress, himself.
"I don't want to lose focus on what we're doing right now," he said.
"That's something that can wait until the end of the season. Me thinking
about that is losing focus, so I can't do that."
The Sixth Man Club crowd seemed to feel the same way. After all the se
niors had been properly cheered, Childress ran over and jumped into the
Sixth Man section, getting mobbed by the crowd in a show of mutual appre
ciation. Everyone went nuts, but the enthusiasm dissipated when a few stu
dents started up a chant of "One more year!" aimed at the star junior.
It may have been the place, but it wasn't the time.
True, it was the end of a perfect undefeated season on Stanford's home
court. But it was also the beginning of a new chapter, one that will determine
how — and whether — this Cardinal team will be remembered by history.
And judging by his recent performances, Childress might turn out to be the
main character.
Stanford is generally known to be the team without a star. But on Satur
day, playing against Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Year candidate
Luke Jackson, Childress was clearly the best player on the court.
Jackson is Oregon's go-to player, the team's leader in points, re
bounds and assists. In Stanford's 76-55 win, Childress topped him in all
three categories.
"That was a great performance tonight," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery of Childress' play. "You know, that's the kind of impact you
need fJosh] to have as you head toward the end of the season."
