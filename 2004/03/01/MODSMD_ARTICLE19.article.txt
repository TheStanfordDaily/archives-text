# Powell nails game winner
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford senior Nicole Powell was denied once. But
there's a reason she's an All-American.
With the No. 10 Stanford women's basketball team (21-6, 14-4 Pacific-10
Conference) down by one with under 10 seconds to go and the ball in Powell's
hands, the situation seemed eerily similar to what the Cardinal faced on
Thursday night — when it dropped a 67-66 heartbreaker to Oregon.
On Saturday, however, Powell was able to complete a 15-point Stanford
comeback by draining a 10-foot fade-away baseline jumper with just 5.4 sec
onds on the clock to beat Oregon State 67-66.
Powell's single shot changed more than just the outcome of a single game.
After Arizona's defeat of Washington — which was without starting senior
guard Gioconda Mendiola, who had been suspended for slapping Arizona
State's Kylan Loney — the Cardinal needed the win to clinch a share of the
Pac-10 regular season title.
With the victory, not only did Stanford defend its title, but it also claimed the
No. 1 seed for the Pac-10 Tournament by virtue of the conference tiebreaker.
Powell's shot was all the more remarkable because she had been struggling
offensively for much of the second half of conference play.
"Things were not necessarily going her way," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "It wasn't like she was in some great offensive flow, but she
just dug down deep and made a great play."
That "digging down deep" is something that had been missing from Stan
ford's play on its last few road trips. But when the squad found itself down by
15 points with just under 12 minutes to go, that's exactly what had to happen
— and not just from Powell.
"We really needed this. We had to work really hard for it," VanDerveer
said. "I'm really proud of our team and how we came back. We looked abso-
lutely dead in the water. We started
pressing and I think our aggressiveness
defensively really helped us."
In less than a minute, the Cardinal
cut a 15-point deficit to just 10 points
after two Powell free throws, a Kelley
Suminski steal and subsequent dish to
Powell, who drained a three.
"I really didn't feel a momentum
swing," Powell said. "I just think we
had to take it one play at a time. We
couldn't just try and score 15 at a time.
Then you're just rushing and taking
bad shots."
Back-to-back shots from junior for
ward T'Nae Thiel — an 8-foot jumper
followed by a fastbreak layup — cut
the Beaver lead to just four with 5:36
on the clock.
However, Oregon State was far
from gone. Up just three with 2:42 to
go, sophomore guard Mandy Close, a
31.3 percent three-point shooter,
drained a trey, stretching the Beaver
lead to six and seemingly shutting the
door on the Cardinal comeback.
And after Thiel was called fora trav
eling violation on Stanford's ensuing

possession, things looked even worse.
But the Cardinal dug deep, came up
with a defensive stop and Suminski
drilled a trey with junior guard Shan
non Howell closing in on her, cutting
the Beaver lead to three with 1:18 to go.
After another defensive stop, Pow
ell brought Stanford to within one on a
layup in traffic.
But to complete the comeback,
Stanford still needed some help from
OSU — and they got it.
Senior point guard Leilani Estavan,
an 81.5 percent free throw shooter,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
with 26.4 seconds to go, but Powell
missed two layups.
However, the Cardinal got lucky
again as Close also missed the first shot
of her one-and-one.
And after Powell pulled down the
rebound — her 13th of the game —
she went to work to win the game for
Stanford.
Powell finished the day with 23
points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, two
key steals and zero turnovers. Stanford
also saw a strong showing from Sumin
ski, who finished with 17 points and
five assists.
The Cardinal hopes to gain mo
mentum from its comeback victory as
it heads into this weekend's Pac-10
Tournament, where it will face the win
ner of Oregon / California in its first
game on Saturday afternoon.

EUGENE, Ore. — Stanford senior Nicole Powell was denied once. But
there's a reason she's an All-American.
With the No. 10 Stanford women's basketball team (21-6, 14-4 Pacific-10
Conference) down by one with under 10 seconds to go and the ball in Powell's
hands, the situation seemed eerily similar to what the Cardinal faced on
Thursday night — when it dropped a 67-66 heartbreaker to Oregon.
On Saturday, however, Powell was able to complete a 15-point Stanford
comeback by draining a 10-foot fade-away baseline jumper with just 5.4 sec
onds on the clock to beat Oregon State 67-66.
Powell's single shot changed more than just the outcome of a single game.
After Arizona's defeat of Washington — which was without starting senior
guard Gioconda Mendiola, who had been suspended for slapping Arizona
State's Kylan Loney — the Cardinal needed the win to clinch a share of the
Pac-10 regular season title.
With the victory, not only did Stanford defend its title, but it also claimed the
No. 1 seed for the Pac-10 Tournament by virtue of the conference tiebreaker.
Powell's shot was all the more remarkable because she had been struggling
offensively for much of the second half of conference play.
"Things were not necessarily going her way," Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "It wasn't like she was in some great offensive flow, but she
just dug down deep and made a great play."
That "digging down deep" is something that had been missing from Stan
ford's play on its last few road trips. But when the squad found itself down by
15 points with just under 12 minutes to go, that's exactly what had to happen
— and not just from Powell.
"We really needed this. We had to work really hard for it," VanDerveer
said. "I'm really proud of our team and how we came back. We looked abso-
lutely dead in the water. We started
pressing and I think our aggressiveness
defensively really helped us."
In less than a minute, the Cardinal
cut a 15-point deficit to just 10 points
after two Powell free throws, a Kelley
Suminski steal and subsequent dish to
Powell, who drained a three.
"I really didn't feel a momentum
swing," Powell said. "I just think we
had to take it one play at a time. We
couldn't just try and score 15 at a time.
Then you're just rushing and taking
bad shots."
Back-to-back shots from junior for
ward T'Nae Thiel — an 8-foot jumper
followed by a fastbreak layup — cut
the Beaver lead to just four with 5:36
on the clock.
However, Oregon State was far
from gone. Up just three with 2:42 to
go, sophomore guard Mandy Close, a
31.3 percent three-point shooter,
drained a trey, stretching the Beaver
lead to six and seemingly shutting the
door on the Cardinal comeback.
And after Thiel was called fora trav
eling violation on Stanford's ensuing

possession, things looked even worse.
But the Cardinal dug deep, came up
with a defensive stop and Suminski
drilled a trey with junior guard Shan
non Howell closing in on her, cutting
the Beaver lead to three with 1:18 to go.
After another defensive stop, Pow
ell brought Stanford to within one on a
layup in traffic.
But to complete the comeback,
Stanford still needed some help from
OSU — and they got it.
Senior point guard Leilani Estavan,
an 81.5 percent free throw shooter,
missed the front end of a one-and-one
with 26.4 seconds to go, but Powell
missed two layups.
However, the Cardinal got lucky
again as Close also missed the first shot
of her one-and-one.
And after Powell pulled down the
rebound — her 13th of the game —
she went to work to win the game for
Stanford.
Powell finished the day with 23
points, 13 rebounds, seven assists, two
key steals and zero turnovers. Stanford
also saw a strong showing from Sumin
ski, who finished with 17 points and
five assists.
