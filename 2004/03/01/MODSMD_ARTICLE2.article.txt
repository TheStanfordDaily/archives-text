# Resources do not impede development, study finds
## 
### MATT SMITH 
A Stanford economic study is gaining national attention in the wake
of the United States' involvement in Iraq. The study, written by Histo
ry Prof. Gavin Wright and Economics graduate student Jesse Czelus
ta, challenges a long-standing economic theory that natural resources
impede progress. Some claim that this theory could have strong policy
implications for developing nations such as Iraq.
In a 1995 study, economists Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner ob
served a trend that economies with an abundance of natural resources
tend to grow less rapidly than those without. According to Jeff
Madrick of The New York Times, economists argue that this abun
dance "encourages corruption, undermines institutional develop
ment" and "cannot support long-term growth because the reserves
eventually run out." Madrick cites this as an explanation for the de
clining economies of countries such as Iraq and Venezuela.
Wright and Czelusta's study disputes this notion, and it even claims
that plentiful natural resources can be a springboard fora thriving
economy. Wright cited the United States as an example of a nation that
has utilized its natural resources for positive growth in both the short
and long-term. The study blames the execution and usage of a natural
resource-based economy rather than the resources alone.
"My research tries to overturn the long-entrenched notion that nat
ural-resource-based economic activity is primitive, retrograde, some
thing that will be or should be discarded in favor of 'knowledge' in
dustries," Wright said. "In many modern economies, natural resource
sectors are part of the 'knowledge economy.' "
Wright first published an article in 1990 on the role of minerals in
U.S. development. He followed this paper with another study in col
laboration with Economics Prof. Paul David examining minerals as a
"knowledge" industry, which led to the controversial conclusion in the
current paper.
Wright and Czelusta's study emphasizes the importance of how re
sources are used rather than if they are used.
"Natural resource industries should not be seen as mere 'gifts of na
ture' or 'resource endowments,' Wright said. "They are better un
derstood as the results of investments of various kinds — in capital, in
frastructure and knowledge in a broad sense.
Wright concluded that an economy would diversify over time even
with few natural resources as a result of investing resource revenues in
areas such as basic education. Stabilization plans must be in place so
that these programs will endure and develop successfully, he said.
However, Wright cautioned against applying the study's implica
tions to Iraq.
"Any application of this research to Iraq is a stretch, he said.
Wright explained that his research discusses the positive potential
of natural resources, although
there are countries — such as
Iraq — that have made poor use
of that potential. However, he
does see another way to connect
the study's ideas with the fate of
Iraq.
"To the extent that there is any
relevance, it is to point out that
the discussion should not just be
about who gets the proceeds from
Iraq's oil, but about how to re
store and sustain the industry into
the future," he said.
While Wright and Czelusta
may not have intended for the
study to influence Iraq policy,
that has not stopped others from
applying it to the Middle East. To
many pundits, the study has a di
rect connection to the oil situation
in Iraq as a criticism of the Bush
administration. Madrick's New
York Times article argues that the
United States should relinquish
total control over oil resources
and distribute ownership more in
a more varied and equitable man
ner.
Wright, however, said that he
does not "see that it inadvertently
weighs in for or against the Bush
administration."
