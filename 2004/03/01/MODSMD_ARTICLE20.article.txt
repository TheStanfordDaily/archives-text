# No. 1 baseball team beats up on Golden Bears
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
If anyone hadn't yet figured out how the Stanford baseball team has
been able to build a 13-2 record and become the top-ranked squad in
the NCAA, this past weekend revealed it all. The Cardinal used every
strength in its arsenal in its sweep of California (7-9) and showed that
when explaining the team's success, it all comes down to one thing —
versatility.
"When we haven't pitched well we've been able to score enough
runs to give ourselves a chance to win and when we haven't scored a lot
of runs we've been able to pitch well," Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess said. "You've got to be able to do that... and we've proved that
we're capable."
The first game of the series was a huge offensive showing for both
Stanford and Cal, but the Cardinal emerged victorious in the war of
bats, 12-9.
Stanford sophomore pitcher Mark Romanczuk and the Golden
Bears' Friday starter Mike Padgett each gave up five runs in their out
ings, as both squads were formidable in the batter's box.
The Cardinal's offensive potency was highlighted by sophomore in
fielder Jed Lowrie's 3-for-3 performance. All three of his hits were
triples — a single-game feat that has never before been completed by
a Stanford player.
"It was really exciting." said Lowrie, who now leads the team in bat
ting average (.472), slugging percentage (.830), hits (25), runs scored
(22) and RBIs (22). "I caught a couple of breaks — the centerfielder
mishandled one of the balls and I got one to roll around in the rightfield
corner. But I'll take it."
Senior Jonny Ash also had a three-hit game with a pair RBIs, while

freshman designated hitter Jim Rapoport managed two RBIs. Junior
Donny Lucy and senior Brian Hall each added a homer to the Stanford
line.
The Bears hit nearly as well, as the lead switched five times in the
game and the score was tied twice. First baseman James Holder led the
Cal charge, going 4-for-5 and knocking in four of the Golden Bears'
nine runs.
In the end, junior Jonny Dyer collected the win after allowing just
one run on four hits in 2 and 1 / 3 innings of work.
Saturday's game was the first of two stellar rubber games for the
Cardinal. Sophomore Jeff Gilmore allowed only three runs in his seven
innings, retiring batters 1-2-3 in the first, second and fourth innings.
Gilmore's work was reinforced by the collegiate pitching debut of
freshman Jeff Stimpson, who threw two hitless innings to ensure the
Cardinal a 10-3 victory.
The Stanford lineup faced Cal righthander Adam Gold, who last
week narrowly missed a no-hitter at Fresno State, but Gold was unable
to put a stopper on the Cardinal bats.
This time it was junior leftfielder Danny Putnam who led Stanford,
going 3-for-5 with a homer and two RBIs. Lowrie and Ash each had
two-hit games while senior Sam Fuld paced the squad with three runs
scored.
The showing was yet another game in which the Cardinal has si
lenced doubts that it could maintain offensive dominance after losing
last year's sluggers, Carlos Quentin and Ryan Garko.
"Our offense is more balanced this year," Lowrie said. "[Garko and
Ouentin] were tough guys to lose but there are guys filling those shoes
and it's not just one or two guys. It's a collective thing. If the top of the

order isn't doing something,

us up."
Sunday's 6-2 win be
longed to freshman lefty
Blake Holler, who earned
the start after a strong outing
against Texas last weekend.
Holler gave up only one run
on five hits in his career-high
seven-inning outing.
"I still feel like I'm bat
tling for the job [as the Sun
day starter]," Holler said.
"But 1 just go out there and
do the best I can every
game."
Holler — who Marquess
said will definitely get anoth
er Sunday start next week
end — also had the advan
tage of being backed by a
solid defense that did not
commit an error in the entire
series.
"It's unbelievable know
ing that you have that kind of

back-up behind you," Holler
said. "[Yesterday] we had
several key double-plays and
[Fuld] made a big play in the
outfield for me. It makes it
that much easier to just
throw strikes and get people
out."
Sophomore hurler Matt
Manship took the mound for
11/3 innings before hand
ing it over to Dyer, who col
lected his first collegiate
save.
Sophomore first baseman
John Mayberry, Jr., had
three hits and three RBIs to
lead the Cardinal. Five other
Stanford players — Ash.
Lowrie, Lucy, sophomore
Chris Minaker and Putnam
— had two-hit games.
Only one member of the
Bears squad, Chris Errecart,
had a multi-hit game.
The series is the fifth
straight in which the Cardi
nal has bested Cal.
Stanford continues its
road play this weekend with
a three-game series against
conference rival Southern
California (3-6).
