## 
### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's tennis team gave
fans on Parent's Weekend something to cheer
about as the players continued their winning
streak, defeating No. 42 Arizona 5-2 on Friday
and sweeping the dual match 7-0 against No. 23
Arizona State on Saturday.
The Cardinal has been looking solid on the
courts recently and is now 8-2 on the season.
This is the fourth match in a row where the
team has captured the win.
"I'm proud of the guys for today's match,"
associate head coach John Whitlinger said.
"The doubles have been very good since we've
made the changes, and it's a nice way to end the
quarter dual match-wise with a match like
today."
Match play on Friday began at Taube Fami
ly Tennis Center with a sweep of the doubles
matches.
At the No. 1 spot, the Wildcats' Colin
O'Grady and Roger Matalonga gave up a quick
8-3 loss to Stanford's sophomore KC Corkery
and junior Sam Warburg. Sophomore James
Pade and freshman James Wan also dispatched
their opponents Daniel Andrus and Paul
Warkentin with relatively little resistance, clos
ing out the match at 8-3.
Playing at No. 3 doubles, the Cardinal tan

dem of senior team captain Carter Morris and
junior Phil Sheng battled back and forth with
Arizona's Whi Kim and Tim Mullane. The two
teams were neck and neck, but the Stanford duo
managed to thwart the Wildcats and pulled off
a 9-8 victory.
In singles, No. 31 Warburg defeated Ari
zona's Kim, 6-4, 6-1, while All-American Cork
ery grabbed a 6-3, 6-4 win from Tom Lloyd at
the No. 2 spot.
Stanford's Wan bounced back from a first set

In the losses, Stanford's Pade gave up a 1-6, 2-
6 loss to Matalonga, while at the No. 4 spot Sheng

unable to get one match past the Cardinal.
The Stanford duo of Corkery / Warburg
routed Chris Stewart and Jonathon Kinsella, 8-
5 followed by Pade / Wan defeating Daniel
Davies and Clinton Letcher, 8-4. At the No. 3
spot, Morris / Sheng dealt an 8-4 loss to ASU's
Christopher Biro and Andy Colombo.
"Sheng and I are playing a lot better dou
bles," Morris said. "It was hard to change ev

erything in the middle [of the season] but we've
switched up the teams and it's been going real
ly well. Sheng came back from a tough match
yesterday and played awesome today."
The Cardinal team continued to dominate
the Sun Devils in singles action, as well. Playing
at No. 1 again, Warburg soundly defeated his
opponent, sending ASU's Stewart home pack
ing with a 6-4, 6-3 victory. In the No. 2 spot,
Corkery easily overwhelmed Letcher, 6-1, 6-1.
"Obviously we're happy with how the last
two matches went, especially today's. With ev
erybody winning today it was a great feeling,"
Corkery said.
Pade, playing No. 3 singles for Stanford, was
down in the first set but battled his way back to
win the second.
The match was settled by a third-set tiebreak
where he fought it out on the courts with
Colombo, ending the match with an ace and
walking away with a 4-6, 6-3, 1-0(8) win.
The rest of the day's matches were quickly
settled in two sets.
Sheng defeated Biro, 6-2, 6-2, Wan once
again cleaned up with a 6-0, 6-4 win over Kin
sella and Morris took a 6-1, 6-4 victory at the
