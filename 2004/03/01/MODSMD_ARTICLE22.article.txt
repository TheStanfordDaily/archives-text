# No. 1 party school requires course in alcohol education
## 
### KAIHERINE CROWELL COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER,CoIo. — The Universi
ty of Colorado at Boulder will require all incoming
freshman to take an Internet course about alcohol
use and abuse beginning fall semester 2004.
Robert Maust, coordinator for the associate vice
chancellor for student affairs and principal investi
gator for A Matter of Degree program, said the uni
versity has not made a final decision as to which In
ternet alcohol use and abuse course will be used. He
is currently looking into "Alcohol EDU" and "My
Student Body," both Internet-based alcohol and
drug education programs used by universities na
tionwide.
Maust said he hopes the final decision will be
made this week.
"We are trying to provide a bottom-line com
mon experience for all students," Maust said. "Then
we will be able to say that you know at least that
much." He added that he wants to see if the pro
gram will have a positive impact on the behavior of
CU students.
The Internet course will be customized to fit
each student's knowledge about alcohol use, said
Maust. It will start with a survey to find out person
al information about the student, such as whether or
not the student drinks.
The student will also be asked about personal
perceptions of alcohol use at college and will re
ceive feedback and educational information based
on his or her answers.
Options for additional information on the topics
of interest will be available to the students through
the Internet course, according to Maust.
The course will take one to two hours, and will
not be credit-based. The student will receive a PIN
number for the course from the company that owns
the Web site. The Web site will notify the universi
ty when the student has completed the course, he
said.
A student's answers will be confidential and the
university will only receive general statistics about
the incoming freshman class's alcohol use and edu

cation level. For example, the course might report
that 50 percent of the students say they drink once a
week, according to Maust.
Maust said the companies supplying online alco
hol programs claim that they are effective in posi
tively altering the behavior of 20 to 30 percent of the
students participating.
"This is an experiment to see if the program will
work here," said Maust.
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Ron Stump
initiated the search for an educational alcohol pro
gram at CU — Boulder, Maust said. The idea for
the program came from surveying other universities
such as Florida State, University of Connecticut and
Duke University, which all use a similar Internet
program.
"Alcohol EDU" receives a grant from the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to test the pro
gram on the ten universities that also receive a grant
from the foundation, including CU — Boulder.
"Six of the schools are going to use 'Alcohol
EDU,'" Maust said. "This makes it more attractive
to us because we could compare notes with the
other schools."
Some CU — Boulder students are hesitant
about how effective the new Internet course will be.
"I think it's a good idea, but I don't necessarily
think it will work," said sophomore Desiree Lanz.
"It should be done, but when freshmen get into col
lege they have a whole new sense of freedom and
the whole idea of college as a party opportunity. But
it might be easier to get over the drinking phase if
they have the background for how harmful it is."
A few current freshmen said the Internet pro
gram is a waste of time.
"It's the same stuff everyone is force-fed all
through high school," said freshman Quinn Crist-
Fulk. "We know binge drinking is bad, but we won't
stop partying every night."
Freshman William Buckley thinks the program
will have a negative impact on incoming students.
"We've had all sorts of teaching for the past, like,
six or seven years that drinking and drugs are bad,"
said Buckley. "I think it will work conversely, mak
ing people want to drink. It's what we do; we rebel."
