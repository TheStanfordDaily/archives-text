# California propositions on tomorrow's ballot address state budget problems
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In tomorrow's primary, voters will decide not
only choose the candidates for each political party
that will appear on this November's ballot, but
also on four statewide propositions — Proposi
tions 55 through 58. Each deals with the allocation
of state funding.
According to a recent survey by the Hoover
Institution, a large portion of voters have not yet
decided how they will vote on the propositions.
Out of those who have made up their mind, two
out of three favor Prop. 57, and 55 percent sup
port Prop. 58. Most of the voters who favor either
proposition also approve of Arnold
Schwarzenegger's performance as governor.
Prop. 55, the Kindergarten-University Educa
tion Facilities Bond Act, would issue a $12.3 bil
lion bond to repair older school facilities and com
bat overcrowding. The total interest on the bond
would be $12.4 billion dollars, and the California
Voter Foundation estimates the fiscal impact of
the bond as $823 million per year.
Prop. 56 would lower the vote requirement for
enacting budget-related bills. If it passes, a 55 per
cent vote will be sufficient to pass a budget; cur
rently, 66 percent is necessary. According to the
California Voter Foundation, the impact of the
bill will vary depending on the actions of future
legislatures, but the bill will potentially lead to a
tax increase.
Props. 57 and 58 work in conjunction: Both
must be approved by a majority of voters in order
for either of them to pass, and both deal with bal
ancing California's budget.
Prop. 57 would let the state borrow $15 billion
by selling bonds in order to balance California's
budget.
Prop. 58 would forbid the state from borrow
ing money in the future to pay off debts and in
stead would mandate a state reserve fund.
Senior Nina Bilimoria, chair of Stanford in
Government, stressed the importance of col
lecting unbiased information about all of the
propositions.
"Students who lean one way or another on the
political spectrum may instinctively choose one
side of the proposition without really understand
ing the full argument," Bilimoria said. "Further
more, it is also important to read the language of
each proposition carefully and critically before
casting your vote."
In general, proponents of Prop. 55 favor edu
cational spending and believe that because inter

est rates are low, now is a good time to spend
money on classrooms.
Those who favor Prop. 56 — mostly Democ
rats in the legislature — point out that California
has not met the deadline to pass a budget since
1986 and that allowing them to do so would clear

up gridlock.
Opponents of Props. 55 and 56 believe that the
propositions raise taxes and hurt the economy.
