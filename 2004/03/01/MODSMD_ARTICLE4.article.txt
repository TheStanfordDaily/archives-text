# GPS developer joins Inventors Hall of Fame

### ZUBIN AGARWAL 
Aeronautics and Astronautics Prof. Emeritus
Bradford Parkinson, co-inventor of the Global
Positioning System (GPS), will be inducted in
the National Inventors Hall of Fame on May 1 in
Akron, Ohio.
Parkinson, who developed GPS with the late
Ivan Getting, served as the first director of the
NAVSTAR GPS Joint Program Office. As the
program's first manager, he was the chief archi
tect of GPS throughout the system's conception,
development and implementation, which includ
ed building, testing and selling the GPS system.
"GPS has revolutionized the concept of find
ing out where something is," Parkinson said.
GPS technology is now routinely used for air
traffic control systems, ships, search and rescue
and tracking environmental changes.
Parkinson said he was glad that the once clas
sified technology has now found wide use. Wal-
Mart advertises its GPS-equipped products as,
"Get 105t... Just for the fun of it."
Parkinson said he is proud of the many appli
cations of GPS, from farming to precision
weapons.
While testing the GPS technology used in
farm tractors, Parkinson was able to drive a golf
cart to within inches of a straight line. Now the
same technology he used is used in a majority of
tractors.
GPS has also helped revolutionize military af
fairs, Parkinson said. The technology was initial
ly developed to guide missiles to targets. Further
development has fostered the building of what
Parkinson calls the "humanitarian bomb" —
precision-guided munitions that prevent collat
eral damage. These accurate weapons have been
used in attacks in Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Also, with the development of GPS-guided
missiles, the military is now able to target things
in three dimensions, such as caves, Parkinson
said.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
is developing a system to provide precise guid
ance to pilots using airports and airstrips that
have no precision-landing systems. Critics
charge that GPS signals are too weak and easily
obscured by buildings or forests to accurately

compute the position of an airplane. However,
tests have shown that the FAA-sponsored Wide
Area Augmentation System (WAAS) is able to
predict the location of a plane to less than a
meter, Parkinson said.
Ivan Getting, who passed away in 2003, will
also be inducted into the National Inventors Hall
of Fame this year. While serving as vice presi
dent of research and engineering at the
Raytheon Corporation during the 19505, Get
ting developed the concept of using a system of

satellites to allow the calculation of precise posi
tioning data for rapidly moving vehicles ranging
from cars to missiles. Parkinson took this idea
and implemented it as head of the NAVSTAR
GPS program in its early stages.
According to a press release, inventors may
be nominated by anyone for induction into the
Hall of Fame, but they must hold a U.S. patent to
be considered. The nominee s invention must

A selection committee, com
prised of representatives from
national science and technology
organizations, reviews nomina
tions. Each year a new class of in
ventors is inducted into the Hall

of Fame in recognition of its
patented inventions that make
human, social and economic
progress possible.
Parkinson is among 20 inventors
— whose accomplishments range
from the discovery and identifica
tion of HIV to the advent of ad
vanced electronics — honored this
year. Included are Ray Dolby (noise
reduction systems), Harry Coover
(superglue), Charles Kelman
(cataract eye surgery) and Edith
Flanigen (molecular filters for pe
troleum processing).
