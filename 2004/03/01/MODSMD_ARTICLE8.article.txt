## Viennese Ball Stanford tradition in jeopardy 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
One by one, girls clad in
shimmering gowns grace ele
gantly into the room, hand in
hand with their dates. The
room is illuminated with fancy
lights and the atmosphere is
simply breathtaking. Like a
scene from Disney's animated
"Cinderella" or "Beauty and
the Beast," the night has a
touch of magic.
Welcome to Stanford's Vi
ennese Ball.
In 1978, Stanford students in
the Stanford-in-Austria pro
gram were fascinated by the
Austrian tradition of lavish
waltz balls. When they re
turned to the United States,
they thought to bring the tradi
tion to Stanford. The first Vi
ennese ball was held in Toyon
Hall and attracted nearly 350
students.
Twenty-seven years later,
the Viennese Ball attracts over

1,000 students and is held off
campus at the Hyatt in San
Francisco. Through the years,
the ball has become the most
formal dance of the year and a
Stanford tradition.
"The atmosphere was so ele
gant, I felt like I was at prom
again," said freshman Christine
Yang. "It was so fancy and
there was such a diverse group
of people age-wise."
Junior Whalen Rozelle said,
"This was my first time at the
ball and a truly had a wonderful
experience."
Having pulled an all-nighter
the night before, Rozelle said
that having "so much fun even
on zero hours of sleeps says
something."
This year's Viennese Ball
featured live music ranging
from waltz to salsa, tango to
polkas and even rock. Not only
were there a variety of dance
moves, but also a variety of
people. The age diversity was
vast: from freshmen to seniors

and faculty members to guests
over 60, the Viennese Ball was
a place for different age groups
to come together for an en
chanted evening.
Some people wonder if the
Viennese Ball is only restricted
to those familiar with formal
dance movements. Most of the
people at the dance are already
conversant with the dances or
have taken social dance classes
at Stanford.
"If I hadn't taken social
dance, I'm not sure if coming
would have been such a defi
nite decision," said freshman
Christopher Wen.
To address the worries of
students, the Viennese Ball
committee offers a week of
events prior to the actual
dance. The week is packed with
free dance lessons for students
who are not in social dance
classes. Moreover, at the actual
event, there are back-to-back
performances so that even if
people don't know how to

dance, people may spend the
night enjoying the perfor
mances.
This year's Viennese Ball,
however, may be the last one of
its kind. The Viennese Ball
committee faces a special fees
crisis. Last year, a student ac
cused the Viennese Ball com
mittee for receiving special fees
as well as charging students
ticket prices for the event. Spe
cial fees is a type of funding for
amounts over $6,000 and is pro
vided by the ASSU to student
organizations operating at
large-scale. The case was
brought to the ASSU Constitu
tional Committee, which ruled
that the Viennese Ball would
not receive special fees for next
year's event.
With funding drastically cut,
the committee faces a dilemma:
continue with a smaller scale
version of the event or end the
tradition completely.
Trang Pham, one of the
chairs of 2004 Viennese Ball,
said the ruling was unfair since
it only targeted the Viennese
Ball rather than all performing
arts organizations.
"We were unduly singled
out," Pham said.
With an annual special fee
of $11,000, the Viennese Ball
actually receives a small
amount of University funding.
"Moreover, while other or
ganizations use the special fees
to accommodate their events,
we redistribute the fee directly
back to the students, for all of
the money is spent on lowering
ticket prices," Pham said.
Considering that the ticket
prices cover the location, a
week worth of events, free
shuttle transportation and
food, the $75 price tag is rea
sonable to many. Pham said
that the Viennese Ball commit
tee has yet to decide what to
do.
"If we do continue, we'll
have to hold the event proba
bly in the Roble gym. However,
then we can't possibly accom
modate as many people as we
had this year," Pham said.
"[The switch in location
would] take away the magic of
the night. A big part of the at
mosphere was created by the
spectacular setting, and hold
ing it on-campus would under
mine the enchantment," Wen
said.
Regardless of what happens,
the Viennese Ball will continue
to be a treasured Stanford tra
dition. Beyond such practical
issues of funding lies the
essence of the event â€” stu
dents having the opportunity to
enjoy a lavish night with their
friends.
