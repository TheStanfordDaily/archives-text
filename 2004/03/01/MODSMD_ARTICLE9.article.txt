## Solving the mystery of the wrinkled sheet dream 
### PHILIP ZIMBARDO PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY 
One of the hot controversies in the field of human memory is the validity of memo
ries about traumatic abuse recovered decades after they have been repressed versus the
contention that many of those memories are false reconstructions and confabulations.
I offer for your consideration a partial memory of my traumatic ex-

perience whose meaning was consistently obscured in a recurring
dream for more than 50 years.
My dream of wrinkled sheets is a tale of denial, deception, fear
and guilt. It is also a story of courage, survival and resiliency of a
child desperately wanting to be a grown up and of a grown up who
never quite got to be a child. I don't recall the night when it first be
came a recurring nightmare, but I know for certain the exact mo
ment it was banished from my psyche. First, the dream frag
ment, then its recent revelation and finally back to its origin.
I look into a dark room with its unmade bed — sheets are dirty,
messy, wrinkled. 1 feel happy. Then big hands suddenly appear.

tearing the old sheets away and remaking the bed with shiny new sheets. I become sad,
frightened and then angry. I fight against those hands, desperately trying to keep the
old sheets from being exchanged for clean, new ones. We struggle, but I always lose
against the might of more powerful forces. Naturally, over time I would try to make
sense of it — after all I am a research psychologist who seeks causes for anomalous ex
periences. Also, I like to have my bed sheets clean and tightly tucked with neatly
trimmed hospital corners. But you'd never know that from my unceasing life-long bat
tle against clean sheets in my mysterious dream.
The solution came upon me suddenly and unexpectedly a few years ago, when I was
in the process of helping a former Stanford student who was dying of AIDS. I had become
his surrogate father. Lonnie's health bounced around for years until he got sick enough
to be hospitalized in a small San Francisco AIDS unit. Unexpectedly, he began to bounce
back to a remarkable level of vitality, so much so that the director wanted to release him
to make room fora waiting patient. I was unable to find alternative care for Lonnie and
was distressed until I noticed that Bill in the adjacent room was not there any longer. His
empty bed had had been remade with shinny new sheets for the next patient. "Oh good,"
I thought, "Lonnie does not have to leave because Bill died and there is a spare bed avail
able." I was instantly blasted with guilt, and that negative emotion cut through the thick
veil shrouding my dream. Wrinkled sheets mean life. Clean sheets mean death in the lan
guage of hospitals. Live people make messes, dead ones are removed to make way for the
next in line, who start their patient careers with bright starched sheets.
Presto — the wrinkled sheet dream imagery invaded my waking consciousness, and
its mysterious sheets were pulled back to reveal the ugly truth which had been covered
over all these years. This intense adult guilt pang was like a laser beam shooting back
in time to illuminate the identical sense of guilt I felt as a five-year old child waiting to
die in New York City's Willard Parker Hospital for Children with Contagious Diseases.
I lived there for five endless months with double pneumonia and whopping cough, sur
rounded by a sea of kids with every conceivable disease. At a conscious level, I had
color-coded this horrible experience with positive hues; I learned reading and writing
there before starting school, ingratiation skills from dealing with nurses and leadership
skills dealing with the sick and dying kids around me.
But it was a living hell. Visiting was limited to a brief time only on Sundays; parents
restrained behind a thick glass wall to prevent them from holding or kissing us. There
was no TV, no radio, no music, no games, no entertainment, no exercising, not ever
leaving your bed, never touching another human being or being touched. Kids coughed
and cried all the time, nurses were in masks and then night came with its dark terrors. I
prayed constantly to be rescued and promised any and everything in return — both to
God and to the Devil, in case he was the one who was in charge of such evil places.
When a kid died, I thought better he or she than me, sucked up the guilt and kept ask
ing the forces that played this game of genetic roulette to spare me. Did 1 mention it was
1939, and there were no medications for any of these horrendous diseases? I knew kids
had died when their messy beds were changed with clean sheets and the nurses lied
about their going home — always during the night. It was a conspiracy of denial we all
had to embrace or how could we entertain a glimmer of hope of survival?
The wrinkled sheet dream partially sustained my vow not to expose that conspiracy,
silently promising not to recognize the shadow that death was casting on all of us. The pow
erful sense of guilt I had experienced as a selfish child who wanted to live at the expense of
other kids was both the force behind the unconscious dream process all these years as well
as the enlightenment experienced in a flash at Lonnie's hospital decades later.
I can now trace almost everything I am — and also much that I have done in my life as a pro
fessional psychologist and educator — to that formative experience, but that is another story.
