The Quest for Consciousness:
A Neurobiological Approach
by Christof Koch
Tuesday, March 2,2004 • 6:OOPM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Consciousness is one of
science's last great unsolved
mysteries. How can the salty
taste and crunchy texture of
potato chips, the unmistak
able smell of dogs after they
have been in the rain, or the
exhilarating feeling of hang
ing on tiny finger holds many
feet above the last secure
foothold on a cliff, emerge
from networks of neurons
and their associated synaptic
and molecular processes? In
The Quest for Consciousness,
Caltech neuroscientist
Christof Koch explores the
biological basis of the subjec
tive mind in animals and peo
ple. He outlines a framework
that he and Francis Crick (of
the "double helix") have con
structed to come to grips with
the ancient mind-body prob
lem. At the heart of their
framework is a sustained,
empirical approach to discov
ering and characterizing the
neuronal correlates of
consciousness - the NCC -
the subtle, flickering patterns
of brain activity that underlie
each and every conscious
experience.
