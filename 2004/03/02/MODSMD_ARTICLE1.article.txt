# Local candidates vie for District 21 Assembly position
##

With each citing education and the California budget as key issues in
today's Democratic primary election, the four candidates running for
state Assembly in local District 21 spent yesterday campaigning and
precinct-walking to nab more votes.
The winner of today's primary will face Republican nominee Steve
Poizner in November. While the 21st district has historically been a De

Proposition 57, which would permit the state to sell $15 billion dollars in
bonds in order to close the deficit.

Countering this argument, Ruskin told The Weekly that the exis

partments would be threatened without the money borrowed through
bond sales.
Barton, a former faculty member at the School of Law, said he would
support increases in income taxes for the affluent and sales taxes. In
