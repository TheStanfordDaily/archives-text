# Local candidates vie for District 21 Assembly position
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
With each citing education and the California budget as key issues in
today's Democratic primary election, the four candidates running for
state Assembly in local District 21 spent yesterday campaigning and
precinct-walking to nab more votes.
The winner of today's primary will face Republican nominee Steve
Poizner in November. While the 21st district has historically been a De
mocratic stronghold, Poizner could be a formidable foe; he already
boasts massive campaign funds and contributions.
This year's Democratic candidates include city council members Bar
bara Nesbet and Ira Ruskin, school board member John Barton and san
itary district board member John Carcione. Current Assemblyman Joe
Simitian is vacating his seat to run for state Senate.
Aside from their origins, the candidates differ little in their
stances on major political issues facing the district and the state. In
response to California's budget crisis, all of the candidates said they
are in favor of re-establishing vehicle owner license fees at three
times the current amount.
While all four candidates endorse Proposition 56 — which would
allow the state legislature to only require 55 percent of the vote to ap
prove the budget and tax bills — only Nesbet and Ruskin support
Proposition 57, which would permit the state to sell $15 billion dollars in
bonds in order to close the deficit.
"The state's low [bond] rating makes California pay more in the long
run," Carcione told The Palo Alto Weekly, referring to the proposition.
In order to raise funds, he said he would support small increases in com
mercial property taxes.
Countering this argument, Ruskin told The Weekly that the exis
tence of many recreational facilities, parks, libraries and even fire de
partments would be threatened without the money borrowed through
bond sales.
Barton, a former faculty member at the School of Law, said he would
support increases in income taxes for the affluent and sales taxes. In
order to save money, he said he rec
ommends a reduction in prison con
struction and standardized testing in
primary and secondary schools. Sim
ilar to Ruskin, he said he would work
to close loopholes in corporate taxes.
Nesbet, an attorney with experi
ence in high-tech law in Silicon Val
ley, said she would also look to in
crease taxes for the wealthy and vehi
cle license fees to repair the budget
The improvement of public edu
cation is a top priority for each of
the four candidates, a goal that they
hope to achieve through smaller
class sizes, increased funding and
other new programs.
"I think the people in this district
are very committed to public educa
tion," Barton said. "They choose to
send their children to public schools
because of the noble intent and pur
pose of public education. There needs
to be more local control, better fund
ing, less testing and more options."
Barton added that he is the only
candidate with school board experi
ence and that he would know best
what it will take to better education
for students statewide.
Carcione concurred with Barton
that schools are in need of proactive
policies, adding that California's higher
education system needs to be protect
ed, especially in light of recent cutbacks.
"The Republican budget plans to

cut funding for the UC's and Cal
State public school systems," he said.
"The number one issue for me is to
make sure our public universities are
well funded."
Carcione, an attorney and child
advocate in the foster care system,
has recently become the center of
controversy. Philip Morris recently
spent $45,000 to send out a mailer to
residents of the district alleging that
personal injury lawyers had donat
ed $375,000 to Carcione's cam
paign. The current sanitary district
board member said he believes the
mailer was sent out in response to
his stand against special interests
and his proposal to raise taxes on
cigarettes.
"Philip Morris attacked the cam
paign because they are scared that I
will follow through with what I say,
that 1 will stand up for our children
when it comes to tobacco," Carcione
said. "I fully believe that Philip Mor
ris deserves to be prosecuted to the
full extent of the law."
Pointing to environmental preser
vation and consumer rights as other
key issues in which he opposes large
special interest groups and corpora
tions. In order to reduce spending
cuts in other areas, Carcione pro
posed a fee that oil corporations must
pay to extract oil from state land.
"I will be a new and independent
voice for children, consumers and the
environment," he said. "I will stand
up against big tobacco, insurance
companies and oil companies."
The environment is a salient issue
for Ruskin, who currently leads the

Bay Area Water Supply and Conser
vation Agency. While Ruskin was
unable to be reached for comment,
he told The Palo Alto Weekly that he
would make efforts to preserve the
district's watersheds and hold "tim
ber companies more accountable for
the damage they do."
Nesbet has also taken a firm
stance on issues of conservation and
water quality.
"I want to make sure laws are put
into place that are enforced and en
forceable," she said. "Many places
that could be used for homes or
commercial centers are not being
used to their greatest potential. In
stead, we are building on our open
space and farm land."
Adding that the current, more
centralized administration has wast
ed money in managing environmen
tal concerns, she said she supports
the decentralization of power and
would work to return political au
thority to local communities.
"This election is about reform,"
she said. "Reform of the electoral
process, reform of the budget and
reform of the structure of taxes
and expenditures in the state of
California."
Nesbet, Barton and Carcione ac
knowledged the role Stanford stu
dents will play in tomorrow's prima
ry, emphasizing that young voters
who usually neglect local elections
could make a major difference.
"It's very important to vote,"
Barton said. "Even if you don't vote
for me, it's important just to get
out there."
