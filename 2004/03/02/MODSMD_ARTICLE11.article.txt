## Better-Tasting Water? A
						look at water usage at Stanford 
### SU FEN LEE 
Exactly one month ago, did you
notice that your tap water tasted and
smelled better? On Feb. 2,
choloramine replaced chlorine as a
disinfectant in Stanford's domestic
water supply.
"Chloroamine — a mixture of
chlorine and ammonia — produces
fewer potentially dangerous by
products than chlorine alone and
provides better protection from bac
teria and microbes because it lasts
longer," said Susan Kulakowski,
campus energy manager of Stanford
Utilities Division.
Stanford's domestic water is pro
vided by the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC). It
made the switch from chlorine to
chloroamine disinfection to comply
with stricter federal and state water
quality regulations.
This is an additional improve
ment to our already safe, high-quali
ty drinking water. According to
Stanford's 2002 Annual Water Qual
ity Report, our tap water is in com
pliance with all California Depart
ment of Health Services and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency

drinking water requirements, includ
ing those for lead and copper.
"The source of water from the tap
and drinking fountains is the same,
so the only difference may be in the
piping material (usually copper) or if
there is a filter on either the tap or
the fountain," said Kulakowski.
"The fountain water is often cooler,
so it may taste a little different."
Jeremy Lee, a junior majoring in
chemical engineering, has no qualms
drinking from both the tap and
drinking fountain.
"1 don't notice any difference in
taste or smell," he said. "I drink
from both."
The switch to choloramine disin
fection was also intended to affect
minimally students living on cam
pus. According to Kulakowski,
"The only people who need to do
anything differently with regard to
chloroaminated water are fish, rep
tile and amphibian owners, dialysis
patients and researchers using high
ly treated water."
"Therefore, our publicity was tar
geted primarily to those folks and
less to students at large," she added.
Information about chloroamina
tion had been publicized for the last

two and a half years through adver
tisements in The Stanford Daily, ar
ticles in The Stanford Report, the
Stanford Utilities Annual Drinking
Water Report and an informational
Web site.
"I know that the campus has done
something to improve the water
quality here," said Lee, who has lived
on campus since he came to Stanford
three years ago as a freshman. "I've
heard about it since sophomore year,
I think, or maybe earlier, but 1 can't
tell the difference."
SFPUC water largely comes from
Sierra Nevada snowmelt, stored in
the Hetch-Hetchy Reservoir.
"Water that comes from Hetch-
Hetchy is of such high quality that it
does not require filtering, but only
disinfection," Kulakowski said. "All
domestic water is disinfected and flu
oridated before it reaches your tap."
Kulakowski cautioned however,
"While water in outdoor decora
tive fountains (i.e. the Claw or
Hoop) is treated, you really
shouldn't drink it."
Lee also agreed that, unlike tap
water, water from such outdoor foun
tains is unsafe for drinking. "You can
tell the difference just by the smell and

color," he said. "Not that it's
worse. It's just that in order to
keep the bugs out of the water,
they must add chemicals."
"It's also a lot more unhy
gienic, I think, when you think
of people fountain-hopping in
them," said Lee, who tried
fountain-hopping during his
freshman year.
The planning, operation
and maintenance of all the
water systems at Stanford is
managed by the Stanford
Utilities Division through its
Water Department. These in
clude domestic water, lake
water, chilled water supply
and return, sanitary sewer
and storm drainage systems.
In addition, these systems in
clude many components such
as dams, lakes, reservoirs,
deep wells, pump stations,
water and drainage piping
stretching over 200 miles,
open channels, fire hydrants,
manholes and metering.
While Stanford Utilities
has two large domestic water
storage tanks, "Most of our
non-potable water comes
from the Stanford foothills
watershed, where it is stored
behind dams in Searsville
Lake and Felt Lake," Ku
lakowski said. "We also have a
few wells, but these are only
used in late summer if the
lakes are depleted and are pri
marily meant for emergency
drinking water."
According to Kulakowski,
Stanford has an active water con
servation program that does both
technology retrofits (such as low
flow toilets) and educational out-

reach to the campus community.
"All of these activities help make
the campus less vulnerable to water
shortages such as those that oc
curred in the late 1980s," Kulakows
ki said.
In the event of a major earth
quake, however, the campus and
surrounding communities could be
without water for several days. "You
should store one gallon per day per
person to last at least 72 hours," Ku
lakowski said
According to the Stanford Uni
versity Water Conservation, Reuse,
and Recycling Master Plan, Stan
ford's average domestic water con
sumption was 2.7 million gallons per
day during the 1999-2000 academic
year. Since then, domestic use has
dropped to 2.4 million gallons per
day, plus 1.2 million gallons per day
of lake water.
"Our biggest domestic water user
is student housing and dining (about
27 percent of the total), followed by
the faculty / staff neighborhood and
the Central Energy Facility," Ku
lakowski said. "Combined lake and
domestic use in the 2001-02 academ
ic year was 141 gallons per person per
day, which was lower than the aver
age of 154 gallons for other Peninsu
la and East Bay communities."
Lee admits, however, that "tak
ing long showers is one way to waste
water, and I think many of us, in
cluding myself, are guilty."
"It's a good way to de-stress and
clear the head in between a problem
set," he added.
Stanford's cost to provide domestic
water to campus users is $4.35 per 1,000
gallons and $2.35 per 1,000 gallons for
lake water, according to Kulakowski.
This, however, is by no means an
indication that filling Lake Lagunita
will be cheaper than keeping Stan
ford students hydrated. More popu
larly known as Lag, the lake
has always been considered a mis
nomer because it is almost always
dry throughout the year.
"The bed of Lake Lagunita is
very porous, so even after it is filled,
it takes 400 gallons of water per
minute to keep it full," Kulakowski
said. "Therefore, the University has
a policy that Lake Lag will be filled
only if San Francisco Creek flows are
available and after Felt Lake is com
pletely full, and that hasn't hap
pened fora number of years."
"Given modern sensibilities
about wasting water, I doubt that
Stanford would ever keep Lake Lag
filled year-round. If we had a very
wet winter we might be able to fill it
for spring quarter, but we would
probably let it drain once irrigation
season begins," Kulakowski said.
Lee said "It is a pity, in a sense, to
have a dry lake. It would be much
more scenic to have the lake filled."
"But having a filled lake means
that it is a breeding ground for
mosquitoes, and that would entail
problems in terms of maintenance,"
Lee said.
