Soaring auroras
A study has published the first direct images ever of a solar
storm engulfing Earth. These events, known as auroras, are color
ful atmospheric displays that typically show up at the poles starting
60 miles above the surface. Until recently, astronomers believed
that auroras stretched no more than 250 miles above the surface be
cause, beyond that, the air has too few molecules. However, the im
ages from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager satellite show auroras
more than 500 miles above the surface. Bernard Jackson, a solar
physicist at UC-San Diego, said, "This is far higher than anyone
had ever expected. It may be that nitrogen from the ionosphere is
ejected into the higher altitudes during a coronal mass ejection [the
most violent form of solar storm]."

Of beetles and aircraft*
A beetle that squirts its enemy with hot Liquid
could help design better aircraft engines. Andy
Mcintosh of the University of Leeds in the Unit
ed Kingdom believes this defense system could
be mimicked to develop engines that reignite at
higher altitude. In the bombardier beetle, two
chemicals mix in a chamber and the reaction
shoots out violently from the nozzle. Combus
tion techniques in WWII planes were similar, but

the beetle does this much more efficiently. The secret may be in
how and where the chemicals are mixed. Mcintosh is currently con
ducting computer simulations to determine the best shape for the
mixing chamber.
Chimps sequenced
A consortium of scientists has officially released a 90 percent
draft of the chimpanzee genome. Richard Wilson, from the
Washington University School of Medicine and leader of one of
two teams, said, "It's a nice first glimpse, but there's more to
come." Chimps are the closest relative to humans and scientists
hope that comparing the two DN As might reveal what makes us
human. The chimp sequence is thought to be 99 percent identi
cal to ours and roughly the same size: 3 billion base pairs. Some
of the differences may lie in the development of brain and lan
guage and human-specific diseases such as Alzheimer's, AIDS
and malaria.
Improved drug-delivery systems
Two chemists from Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in
Brazil and University of Florida have published their results on
polypyrrole (PPy). PPy is an electroactive membrane, which re
sponds according to electricity. The scientists measured the rate of
ATP release and found they were able to adjust it electrochemical
ly. Thus, polymers using PPy could potentially be used in con
trolled drug-delivery devices. This has major implications in treat
ments like chemotherapy. Having drugs target malignant tumors
could reduce the damage done to benign tissue.
Micro fuel cells
Researchers at UC-Los Angeles and Penn State have devel
oped a high-power, micro fuel cell that works at room temperature.
Previously power sources for micromachines only worked at high
temperatures or produced toxic byproducts. This device is essen
tially a proton membrane embedded in a silicon fuel cell smaller
than the width of a human hair. The researchers believe it could be
potentially used to power portable electronic, medical tools and
other microdevices.
NMR to image bones
Scientists at Southwest Research Institute and the University
of Texas have improved nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tech
niques to image porous bones. Bones become porous with age, in
creasing the risk of fracture. This condition is known as osteo
porosis and, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation,
it affects 10 million Americans. Detecting porosity earlier can help
retard osteoporosis and reduce eventual medical bills. Qingwen
Ni, the lead author, said, "Since this NMR technique is non-inva
sive and non-destructive, it has great potential in the biomedical
fields, particularly in bone-related research and applications."
