# Can humans live elsewhere in the solar system?
## 
### 
Ah, fair inquisitor, glad you asked! According to pio
neering NASA scientist Chris McKay, our distant plane
tary cousin Mars once had the potential for sustaining

life. If this proves to be true, then Mars
could possibly be our first interstellar
home away from home.
Although Mars is 250 million miles
from the sun, the amount of sunlight
reaching the red planet is substantial
enough for scientists to include it under
the Habitable Zone. The Habitable
Zone is an area comprising life-sustain
ing solar levels shared only by the
earth. Solar energy, as you may know,
is the driving force behind the biologi-

cal reactions that keep most living organisms alive.
Sometime between 4.5 billion and 3.5 billion years
ago, water may have also coursed though the Martian
surface. Images of empty gorges and rivulets recently
taken by NASA's twin Mars rovers — Opportunity and
Spirit — suggest water once flowed freely and caused the
erosions on the Martian surface.
At the same time as water ebbed on Mars, the earth
was undergoing the pre-Cambrian explosion, a period
during which organic elements and compounds were
shifting to form the precursors of cells and living organ
isms. Biotic compounds on Mars may have also
emerged, but evidence remains millions of kilometers
from our grasp. .
The active surface transformations of both planets
also ascended into their atmosphere and outer orbits.

Current meteorological research suggests there is a high
possibility that rock compounds were exchanged be
tween the Earth and Mars during their formations. Just
to raise the hair on the back of your neck, are you still cer
tain life originated here?
Enough philandering. Let us go back 3.5 billion years
ago. Out of the two swirling, water-bubbling planets,
only one emerged as the crowning champion of life. We
know the answer to that, but the question is. why?
The Earth is able to attract and maintain heat in its
inner-core because of its large size, but Mars's surface
area is 10 times smaller.
Temperatures are also colder on Mars given that it is
farther away from the sun. High levels of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere prevent the greenhouse effect respon
sible for our warmer climates to occur. Scientists pin
point solar wind as the culprit for stripping away Martian
atmosphere, leaving behind just a thin layer of the gases
needed to trap heat. The atmosphere is so sheer that it al
lows UV light to penetrate the surface, which caused the
water in Mars channels to evaporate.
Amid the hollow bracken-red footprints left behind,
the possibility for sustaining life still exists in places you
probably wouldn't have guessed. McKay believes that at
very low temperatures found at the poles, water exists as
ice glaciers and permafrost.
This is where science meets sci-fi. Ever heard of ter
raforming? Just as the name implies (from the Latin
"terra," meaning Earth), it means the construction of
Earth-like conditions on other planets to make them
habitable. By terraforming, we would disrupt the plan
et's natural atmospheric and surface conditions to pave

the way for those that can sustain us.
The million dollar question is, is this possible?
Drive through the smog-ridden streets of Los Ange
les and you're sure to see bona fide ways to change any
planetary atmosphere. The harmful pollutants we pro
duce trap more solar energy, prevent more heat from es
caping and cause higher global temperatures. These very
pollutants currently destroying our planet, though, may
serve to make others habitable.
According to McKay, "the only current technology
we have that is capable of warming up planets is the pro
duction of supergreenhouse gases, such as C2F6. We are
making these gases on Earth where they are contributing
to global warming. If these gases contain chlorine and

bromine, they are also contributing to the depletion of
the ozone layer."
McKay continued, "On Mars, we actually want glob
al warming but we also want an ozone layer so [we
shouldn't consider] chlorine and bromine emissions."
In fact, by utilizing greenhouse gases with 100 percent
efficiency, he has estimated that Mars could equate our
atmosphere in 17 years. On a lower, more realistic, effi
ciency rate of 10 percent, it would take roughly 100 years.
The catch is, there still is no way of producing oxygen;
leave that to billions of years of organic evolution on
Earth. Although we can't mimic nature, we can find
shortcuts. Humans could still live on a warmer Mars, but
would have to wear oxygen masks.
"Some fraction of humanity needs to push the fron
tier," McKay said. "Mars is one of many frontiers. We
just never know which is ripe for pushing and which will
be important in our future. Recall that Alaska was called
•Steward's folly' when it was [first] purchased for seven
million dollars," he said.
Currently, plans for expeditions to Mars have been de
vised by researchers at NASA. Over time, McKay said
transport to Mars for scientific expeditions could be
come routine and relatively inexpensive — around a few
hundred million dollars.
So, the question becomes not if we can live elsewhere
in the solar system, but should we? Sometime in the not
so distant future, well probably have to decide whether
we'll just set foot or set edifices on Mars.
