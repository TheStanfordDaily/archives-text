# Consider state issues today
## 
### 
The Democratic presidential candidates are
sure to dominate voter consciousness in
today's California primary election ballot.
However, we encourage students to consid
er carefully some of the less discussed issues that will
be voted on today.
The propositions:
Proposition 55 is a $12 billion bond that will be
issued to build public education facilities from
kindergarten to university levels. The argument in
favor is that schools are overcrowded; the argu
ment against is that we should pay for them later
because we can't afford to now. Issuing bonds for
school infrastructure is generally not thought of as
a very controversial issue, and students should con
sider supporting this proposition.
Proposition 56 addresses part of the reason for
California's fiscal mess: Either party can block leg
islation. The Republicans can block tax increases;
the Democrats can block cuts in higher education
and healthcare; each can point fingers at the other.
Fed up with their legislators, voters discovered it
was easier to pass propositions than to get bills
through the deadlocked assembly. However, gov
ernment by plebiscite has only exacerbated the
more-spending-less-taxes situation. This proposi
tion would reduce the voting threshold for spend
ing bills from 66 percent to 55 percent (in most
states it is anything over 50 percent) and would put
a hold on legislators' salaries until a budget is
passed, which we support.
Proposition 57 issues a one-time $15 billion bond
to pay off California's current debts and deficits.
While paying for the current expenditures by accu
mulating debt is not the best idea, the current legisla
ture offers little hope fora "plan B," and thus,
bankruptcy is a real — and unattractive — possibili
ty if this proposition does not pass.
Proposition 58 would establish a reserve fund
and require future budgets to be balanced, elimi
nating the need to issue more debt in the future.
Props. 57 and 58 are a package deal: if either is
voted down, neither becomes law. While there is a
strong argument for allowing the federal govern
ment to run deficits in recessions, in our view,
there is not a very strong argument against bal
anced budgets for states.
Democratic candidates for state Senate:
Stanford's state Senate district is gerryman
dered safe for Democrats. The candidates, Joe
Simitian and Ted Lempert, agree on almost all is
sues and are fighting hard to invest in schools and
protect the environment. The main issue between
them — Lempert's acceptance of public campaign
financing — has little salience because his allies
have pumped soft money into the race through un
regulated issue-advocacy loopholes. The Stanford

Democrats and the California Democratic Party
have both endorsed Simitian, arguing that he will
be a more effective advocate for Democratic val
ues. Simitian also has won University backing for
his active support of campus causes in recent years,
such as work with the Students of Color Coalition
against Prop. 54. Though he has since apologized,
Lempert is criticized for dirty campaigning, includ
ing attacks on current Congresswoman Anna
Eshoo that were deemed false in a citation by the
California ethics board.
Democratic candidates for state Assembly:
Running to replace Simitian in the assembly are
four candidates: Palo Alto school board member
John Barton; 28-year old Redwood City attorney
John Carcione; Los Gatos Town Council member
Barbara Nesbet; and Redwood City council member
and former mayor Ira Ruskin. None of the candi
dates is very well known outside their respective
cities. This district is conventionally thought safe for
Democrats, but Steve Poizner — a socially moder
ate Silicon Valley millionaire, public school teacher,
former White House fellow and Stanford Graduate
School of Business alumnus —is running unop
posed in the GOP primary. The Stanford Democrats
have endorsed Barton; Ruskin is slightly ahead in
the polls, but the race could go to any of them.
Republican candidates for U.S. Senate:
The almost certain winner. Bill Jones is up 30 per
cent in the polls and and has won the endorsement of
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Secretary of state
from 1994 to 2002, Jones is best known for authoring
the three strikes law providing mandatory minimum
sentences for repeat felons. The main worry is
whether Jones, a former cattle rancher, is the candi
date best able to challenge Sen. Barbara Boxer in
November.
The self-billed "traditional conservative" in the
race, Howard Kaloogian is the most pro-life candi
date in the race and has taken the strongest stances
against gay marriage. A pro-choice Hispanic
woman who worked her way out of poverty,
Rosario Marin has the background to challenge the
Democrats. Unfortunately her political resume is
awfully thin and she lacks the name recognition to
compete effectively. Stanford alumnus (MS, MBA)
Toni Casey's main campaign issue is that Bill Jones
was not tough enough on taxes or fighting immigra
tion. She is pro-choice.
Where to vote:
Your voting location depends on what precinct
you are in, and should be indicated on the voter in
formation you were sent by the state. There are four
voting locations on campus: FloMo, Faisan House
(Precinct 2539), Wilbur Hall Screening Room
(2542), El Centro Lounge (2543) and Quillen House
Lounge (2544).
