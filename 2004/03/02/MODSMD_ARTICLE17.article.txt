# GO BIG OR GO HOME
## Mikey's first office hours 
### 
In the three and a half years I've
been at Stanford, I've never
once stopped by a professor's
office hours. I've hiked the
Dish, carved my initials into a table
at the Oasis and fountain hopped.
I've even viewed an item at Special
Collections. But not once have I
been to office hours. I hardly even go
to classes these days, especially with
Senior Class activities gearing up
and ASSU elections looming. Gotta
get stuff done, but it never has any
thing to do with class. Or professors.
So I decided that this week's col
umn would serve as my excuse to do
what I've wanted to do fora long
time: spontaneously show up at a
prof's office and just start talking.
They're smart people — maybe
they'd have their own nuggets of
wisdom that they'd want to share
with a random student dropping by.
My journey begins in the inner
Quad, flip-flops on my feet, t-shirt
on my back and a scruffy mug that I
haven't shaved in a couple days. My
hair is greasy and I'm not even the
slightest bit presentable, but my
quest is driven by my deadline to
turn this column in.
First stop: Classics Department.
First open door: a guy whose last
name is Devine. He's out of his office,
which is too bad (think of the tag-lines
for this column: "Devine Interven
tion," or "Waking Prof. Devine").
Richard Martin's secretary tells
me that the legendary lecturer's
door is closed, meaning that he isn't
taking any visitors. She says this
even though both of us can hear the
Mozart blaring from the inside of
fice. Note to self: Classics people lis
ten to classical music.
I shrug my shoulders and move on
to the History Corner. Nearly every
door is closed, and Joel Beinin, expert
in Middle Eastern history, is busy talk
ing to someone. I finally find an open
door and a prof who looks occupied.
"It's not my office hours," Richard
Roberts (or Robert Richards, I forget
which) says to me apologetically.
Stymied yet again. I begin to worry
that my first attempt to be a reporting
columnist will be a boring, fruitless
adventure around the Quad. Press on,
I say to myself. 1 don't have any more
of life's lessons, anyway. Last week's
column was probably enough.
Next stop: Psych building, where
I've spent many of my freshman days

dabbling in classes and experiments
that added up to an almost-minor
and about $35.

I start out on
the bottom floor
and walk through
the haunted hall
way where the in
famous Stanford
Prison Experi
ment took place.
No professors
anywhere to be
found. Turning
the corner, I near-

ly run straight into Prof. Phil Zim
bardo, the man behind the afore
mentioned prison experiment. This
freaks me out a little ... but he's on
his way out to teach a class and tells
me I should take it next year. No
problem, I say. After all, I might still
have time to get that minor consid
ering I'll probably be in school for
the next five years.
I see my friend Felicity Miao,
who is the president of the Stanford
Undergraduate Psychology Associ
ation. I ask her what the chances are
of my randomly dropping in to talk
to a professor outside of his or her
office hours. "Virtually nil," she
says. "But good luck!"
Another door open just a crack. 1
knock and am greeted by the puz
zled look on Prof. Barbara Tversky's
face. I've heard the name before,
and though I can't remember what
courses she teaches, I know she's
pretty prominent. And suspicious.
"1 ... uh, um, this is my first of
fice hours in four years here at Stan
ford. and I just want to talk about
something random. I don't know.
Life lessons. Uh ..."
I am trying not to tell her that I'm
planning to write a column about
my first office hours experience.
"Well, I have five minutes," she
#ays. I ask if I can sit down.
'"Sure, but five minutes," she polite
ly rfpiinds me. "I have a lot of meetings
to go to. I'm probably busier these days
than when I was as an undergrad."
She begins by asking me about
my major and my interests. I tell her
that I've done too many extracurric
ular, too little studying and that I 'm
not sure how I'm ever going to focus
on research or studying or graduat
ing. These are the questions I find
myself asking over and over again
these days. Questions that I'm sick

of asking and you're sick of hearing,
I know. I'm sorry. Barbara's never
heard them from me before.
"Well, it's good to focus on one
thing," she advises. "Experiences
build on one another, but if you focus
on one thing, you can look back and
feel a sense of accomplishment."
1 tell her that I like business, that
I'm a jack-of-all-trades and master
of none. And how this worries me
because I don't know how this will
lead me to feel a sense of fulfill
ment. She recounts a story of a
friend's father, who was a good
chemist. Good, but not great
enough to go into academia. He was
more fit for business. Ends up that
he earns a lot of money and puts it
towards organizations that he sup
ports and this is how he finds a sense
of fulfillment. "It's not that you
have to do what everyone else
does," she says when I bring up my
many friends who have perfect
grades and are off to grad schools.
We talk about politics, journal
ism, parents and careers. She tells
me about her son, a former math
major who became a video game de
signer. Now he's based in London,
doing the business side of things.
"He loves his job," she says. She tells
me about her daughter, who went to
Yale and didn't know what she
wanted to do when she graduated.
"I'm very proud of her now," Tver
sky says. "She's done very well."
The professor's wisdom is very
evident in her well thought-out
comments. "It all falls together,"
she says. "You'll land on your feet.
You seem to be a doer and an opti
mist. That's good."
It's ended up being a fine after
noon with even finer life advice. And
Prof. Tversky has saved me from dis
appointment on my adventure.
Over a half hour later, I shake
her hand and thank her for her time.
"No problem," she says. "Go visit
other professors . . . maybe ones
you know."
I just might do that.

of life's lessons, anyway. Last week's
column was probably enough.
Next stop: Psych building, where
I've spent many of my freshman days

dabbling in classes and experiments
that added up to an almost-minor
and about $35.

I start out on
the bottom floor
and walk through
the haunted hall
way where the in
famous Stanford
Prison Experi
ment took place.
No professors
anywhere to be
found. Turning
the corner, I near-

ly run straight into Prof. Phil Zim
bardo, the man behind the afore
mentioned prison experiment. This
freaks me out a little ... but he's on
his way out to teach a class and tells
me I should take it next year. No
problem, I say. After all, I might still
have time to get that minor consid
ering I'll probably be in school for
the next five years.
I see my friend Felicity Miao,
who is the president of the Stanford
Undergraduate Psychology Associ
ation. I ask her what the chances are
of my randomly dropping in to talk
to a professor outside of his or her
office hours. "Virtually nil," she
says. "But good luck!"
Another door open just a crack. 1
knock and am greeted by the puz
zled look on Prof. Barbara Tversky's
face. I've heard the name before,
and though I can't remember what
courses she teaches, I know she's
pretty prominent. And suspicious.
"1 ... uh, um, this is my first of
fice hours in four years here at Stan
ford. and I just want to talk about
something random. I don't know.
Life lessons. Uh ..."
I am trying not to tell her that I'm
planning to write a column about
my first office hours experience.
"Well, I have five minutes," she
#ays. I ask if I can sit down.
'"Sure, but five minutes," she polite
ly rfpiinds me. "I have a lot of meetings
to go to. I'm probably busier these days
than when I was as an undergrad."
She begins by asking me about
my major and my interests. I tell her
that I've done too many extracurric
ular, too little studying and that I 'm
not sure how I'm ever going to focus
on research or studying or graduat
ing. These are the questions I find
myself asking over and over again
these days. Questions that I'm sick

of asking and you're sick of hearing,
I know. I'm sorry. Barbara's never
heard them from me before.
"Well, it's good to focus on one
thing," she advises. "Experiences
build on one another, but if you focus
on one thing, you can look back and
feel a sense of accomplishment."
1 tell her that I like business, that
I'm a jack-of-all-trades and master
of none. And how this worries me
because I don't know how this will
lead me to feel a sense of fulfill
ment. She recounts a story of a
friend's father, who was a good
chemist. Good, but not great
enough to go into academia. He was
more fit for business. Ends up that
he earns a lot of money and puts it
towards organizations that he sup
ports and this is how he finds a sense
of fulfillment. "It's not that you
have to do what everyone else
does," she says when I bring up my
many friends who have perfect
grades and are off to grad schools.
We talk about politics, journal
ism, parents and careers. She tells
me about her son, a former math
major who became a video game de
signer. Now he's based in London,
doing the business side of things.
"He loves his job," she says. She tells
me about her daughter, who went to
Yale and didn't know what she
wanted to do when she graduated.
"I'm very proud of her now," Tver
sky says. "She's done very well."
The professor's wisdom is very
evident in her well thought-out
comments. "It all falls together,"
she says. "You'll land on your feet.
You seem to be a doer and an opti
mist. That's good."
It's ended up being a fine after
noon with even finer life advice. And
Prof. Tversky has saved me from dis
appointment on my adventure.
Over a half hour later, I shake
her hand and thank her for her time.
"No problem," she says. "Go visit
other professors . . . maybe ones
you know."
I just might do that.

In the three and a half years I've
been at Stanford, I've never
once stopped by a professor's
office hours. I've hiked the
Dish, carved my initials into a table
at the Oasis and fountain hopped.
I've even viewed an item at Special
Collections. But not once have I
been to office hours. I hardly even go
to classes these days, especially with
Senior Class activities gearing up
and ASSU elections looming. Gotta
get stuff done, but it never has any
thing to do with class. Or professors.
So I decided that this week's col
umn would serve as my excuse to do
what I've wanted to do fora long
time: spontaneously show up at a
prof's office and just start talking.
They're smart people — maybe
they'd have their own nuggets of
wisdom that they'd want to share
with a random student dropping by.
My journey begins in the inner
Quad, flip-flops on my feet, t-shirt
on my back and a scruffy mug that I
haven't shaved in a couple days. My
hair is greasy and I'm not even the
slightest bit presentable, but my
quest is driven by my deadline to
turn this column in.
First stop: Classics Department.
First open door: a guy whose last
name is Devine. He's out of his office,
which is too bad (think of the tag-lines
for this column: "Devine Interven
tion," or "Waking Prof. Devine").
Richard Martin's secretary tells
me that the legendary lecturer's
door is closed, meaning that he isn't
taking any visitors. She says this
even though both of us can hear the
Mozart blaring from the inside of
fice. Note to self: Classics people lis
ten to classical music.
I shrug my shoulders and move on
to the History Corner. Nearly every
door is closed, and Joel Beinin, expert
in Middle Eastern history, is busy talk
ing to someone. I finally find an open
door and a prof who looks occupied.
"It's not my office hours," Richard
Roberts (or Robert Richards, I forget
which) says to me apologetically.
Stymied yet again. I begin to worry
that my first attempt to be a reporting
columnist will be a boring, fruitless
adventure around the Quad. Press on,
I say to myself. 1 don't have any more
of life's lessons, anyway. Last week's
