# AN AVERAGE WHITE BAND
## For passion and tolerance 
### 
Mel Gibson was widely
ridiculed in Hollywood
and in the press last year
when word spread of a
film project he had undertaken de
picting the final hours of Jesus Christ
before his crucifixion. The movie was
regarded as a folly of epic proportions
and had critics (even the acerbic
Washington Post critic Tom Shales,
who usually reserves his vitriolic arse
nal for television) chuckling in antici
pation of the scathing reviews they
would get to write, many amounting
to nothing short of blood sport.
Now Gibson is laughing all the
way to the bank. "The Passion of
Christ" debuted at No. 1 last week at
the box office, pulling in an estimated
$76.2 million over the weekend,
bringing the total earnings up to
$ 117.5 million since its release on Ash
Wednesday. It was the biggest open
ing ever for an independent film.
"The Passion of Christ" is one of
the most talked-about films of the
year due to the controversy sur
rounding charges of anti-semitism
leveled at the film and its director, as
well as the graphic depiction of
Christ's crucifixion. Curious to see
what all the fuss was about, I stood in
line with plenty of nervous moviego
ers this weekend to watch what easily
qualifies as the goriest movie I have
ever seen. (I am well versed in the
Ouentin Tarantino school of cine
ma.) A couple of hours later, I left
questioning our nation's rating sys
tem, which labels "The Passion of
Christ" with a mere R while the tacky
but silly "Showgirls" was branded
with an NC-17 rating. Relieved that
the movie was over, I was not enlight
ened. The film itself has little merit. It
is essentially a glorified horror film, a
visceral assault on the senses that had
me peering through latticed fingers as

I watched Christ's skin ripped from
his back and nails slowly hammered
through his mangled hands.
Although I did not find the film in
teresting or enjoyable, I am not at
tacking Gibson for producing and di
recting it; indeed, on this page, I even
come to his defense. 1 value deeply the
freedom in our society for individuals
to express their views and beliefs, no
matter how controversial. If anything,
I think Gibson has shown courage in
bringing to life a vision he is obviously
deeply affected by. I cannot pretend
to understand his passion for repre
senting in such length and detail the
agonizing brutality suffered by Christ
before his death, but I believe calls for
censorship are misguided.
Individuals should exercise the
right to decide whether or not they
will see "The Passion of Christ."
Moviegoers should not be too sur
prised by Gibson's cinematographic
choices: The actor / director has long
had a penchant for using graphic
scenes to underscore the courage,
sacrifice and nobility of a character as
he perceives it. Who can forget his
brutal self-disembowelment as
William Wallace in "Braveheart?"
As for Gibson being labeled an anti
semite; well, I don't know the guy.
But he did take the story from the
gospels. Opponents of the film, Gib
son has said, don't take issue with his
movie so much as the book it was
adapted from. As Matt Labash wryly
noted in his piece in this week's issue
of The Weekly Standard, "The narra
tive necessarily implicates Jews and
Romans, since there weren't many
Norwegians around at the time."
Gibson has a right to his own polit
ical, moral, religious and aesthetic be
liefs. As are you. Attack him if you
will. But of interest to me is neither
the content of the film nor Gibson's

fervent passion for his faith. No, the
crux lies in the diverse reactions
prompted by his movie and the most
honest, personal and contentious dia
logue on religion that I have heard in
a while from a society that generally
walks on eggshells when it comes to
matters of faith (although many
would say that President George W.
Bush has changed this). The truth is
that the population of the United
States is extremely sensitive — and
diverse — when it comes to matters
of faith and religion. In addition, it is
often extremely devout. One cannot
assume, as in some societies, that
one's neighbor has the same religious
perspective as oneself. For these rea
sons — and because beliefs of this na
ture are so personal — religious be
liefs are not often topics of discussion
in social arenas. Unfortunately, this
trend ends up precluding what could
be productive, interesting discussion.
Certainly at Stanford, open dia
logue on religious beliefs and prac
tices is scant. I have found that stu
dents by and large keep these beliefs
to themselves. If questioned, students
will reveal their religious affiliations,
but usually not the strength or depth
of their faith and the beliefs that fol
low. Having grown up affiliated to no
particular church or religion, I am al
ways curious to learn about the prac
tices and beliefs of my peers. As an in
creasing number of people attend a
screening of "The Passion of Christ,"
perhaps a more open dialogue be
tween people of different back
grounds and religious affiliations can
be encouraged, to foster the ever-im
portant virtue of tolerance.
