Democrats should stop worrying about Nader
I'm writing this letter in response to Brandon Liv
erence's op-ed on Nader's presidential campaign in
The Stanford Daily ("Nader's campaign will hurt
Democrats more than Bush," March 1). First let me
state that I'm an ardent Democrat. I disagree with
Nader's statement that there is no difference be
tween the two parties. A brief browsing of some key
"progressive" legislation shows an almost strict par
tisan split. I do agree with Liverence's position that
Nader will most likely hurt Democrats more than
George W. Bush. However, I think it's time for
Democrats to get over the 2000 election. Nader is not
going to get the support he had back then. The scant
support he will get this time is most likely going to be
from the uncompromising idealists that wouldn't
vote Democrat anyway.
What Democrats need to do is stop whining about
Nader and get to work. Yes, work. If they really want to
get Bush out of office like they say they do, then they
should feel obligated to go precinct walking, make
phone calls and register new voters.(I would bet my
scant life savings that the Democrat expandable base is
much larger than that of the GOP.)
The Stanford Democrats are currently working to in
stall a new president in 2004. Feel free to join us by vis
iting our Web site: http://democrats.stanford.edu.

I am disappointed, though not surprised, to see un
doubtedly well-meaning liberals like Brandon Liver
ence ("Nader's campaign will hurt Democrats more
than Bush," March 1) fall into the old trap of blaming
Ralph Nader and third parties for the Democratic
Party's ills. This notion rests on the arrogant assumption

that everyone is simply "liberal," "conservative" or
somewhere in between, and a dissenter in the ranks is
somehow harmful to "liberal causes" (a phrase which
Liverence uses repeatedly in his op-ed without clarifica
tion as to what these causes are).
The real issue here is not whether there are clear dif
ferences between the Democrats and Republicans, but
whether there are clear differences between the
Democrats and Nader. There certainly are. He is not
merely another "liberal" in the race, but a true alterna
tive voice. The Democrats take nearly as much money
in corporate donations as the Republicans do, and in
return, they generally support "free" trade agreements
which perpetuate third world poverty, resist the decen
tralization of power to the state and local level and pay
lip service to such things as environmental protection
while taking no meaningful actions that might anger
their corporate donors. Rather than directing their
self-righteous anger at the few prominent opposition
figures in national politics, true progressives should be
outraged at a political system which ensures the con
tinued control of American government by two par
ties, and the continued domination of the two parties'
platforms by corporate interests, at the expense of
many human needs which conflict with big business's
profit motive.

Daily's statement on Viennese Ball's
special fee status incorrect
I would like to point out that The Daily's feature ar
ticle "Viennese Ball: Stanford tradition in jeopardy"
(March 1) incorrectly stated that the ASSU Constitu
tional Council ruled that the Viennese Ball Committee
"would not receive special fees for next year's event."

This is an inaccurate characterization of the rul
ing, which stated that the Viennese Ball Committee
violated Article V, Section 2. A.5 of the ASSU Con
stitution "by charging for services and receiving a
special fee."
The Viennese Ball Committee is free to apply fora
special fee for their services, but they cannot charge stu
dents in addition to this. This is similar to why The Stan
ford Daily is unable to charge students for its newspa
pers since it also receives special fees from them.
Finally, 1 believe 2004 Viennese Ball co-chair
Trang Pham's comments that her organization was
"unduly singled out" to be completely untrue. The Vi
ennese Ball Committee was given a one-year grace pe
riod to deal with the unconstitutionality of their ac
tions. In addition, all other special fees groups have
been made aware of this ruling and will therefore be
subject to the same constraints by the Undergraduate
Senate Appropriations Committee and the Graduate
Student Council.

Israel-Palestine activists should
engage in constructive dialogue
As students committed to mutual understanding and
creating common ground through sustained discussion
of the conflict in the Middle East, we, the members of
the Middle East Issues Dialogue (MEI) group find
David Horowitz's ad ("The Middle East War is not
about a Palestinian state or Palestinian land," Feb. 23)
and Ammar Nayfeh's response ("Advertisement mis
represented historical events in Palestine," Feb. 24) to
be counterproductive. Real education about any issue
and moving forward towards peace requires context

and compassion — something that was sadly lacking in
both pieces.
On this campus we have the unique opportunity to
talk civilly with those people whose opinions we might
find objectionable. This possibility lies at the heart of
education: By having such conversations we often real
ize that binary perspectives are an illusion, just as illu
sory as the monolithic groups — "Arabs" and "Zion
ists" — around which those aforementioned articles
frame their generalizations. Such generalizing serves
to make people defensive and hinders conversation,
when our goal should be the opposite: to create trust
ing environments for sincere discussion of these highly
complex issues.
The MEI group seeks to talk openly about the differ
ences among us on this issue. In doing so, we strive to un
derstand and develop empathy for one another's points
of view. It serves us well to understand who we are,
where we come from, why we believe the things we do
and to extend that respect to those with whom we're
speaking, regardless of the issue. We have learned that
peace and progress are not about winning debates or
scoring points, but about honest dialogue and more im
portantly, active listening.
We hope that The Daily's advertising staff, the edi
torial board, readers and finally, students having these
discussions in the privacy of their own rooms and
dorm halls, can benefit from our model of dialogue.
Further, we strongly encourage The Daily to exercise
journalistic quality control in the ads and op-eds it
chooses to run.
We invite anyone reading this to join us on Thursday
nights at Stern Hall at 5:15 p.m. If you would like more

Democrats should stop worrying about Nader
I'm writing this letter in response to Brandon Liv
erence's op-ed on Nader's presidential campaign in
The Stanford Daily ("Nader's campaign will hurt
Democrats more than Bush," March 1). First let me
state that I'm an ardent Democrat. I disagree with
Nader's statement that there is no difference be
tween the two parties. A brief browsing of some key
"progressive" legislation shows an almost strict par
tisan split. I do agree with Liverence's position that
Nader will most likely hurt Democrats more than
George W. Bush. However, I think it's time for
Democrats to get over the 2000 election. Nader is not
going to get the support he had back then. The scant
support he will get this time is most likely going to be
from the uncompromising idealists that wouldn't
vote Democrat anyway.
What Democrats need to do is stop whining about
Nader and get to work. Yes, work. If they really want to
get Bush out of office like they say they do, then they
should feel obligated to go precinct walking, make
phone calls and register new voters.(I would bet my
scant life savings that the Democrat expandable base is
much larger than that of the GOP.)
The Stanford Democrats are currently working to in
stall a new president in 2004. Feel free to join us by vis
iting our Web site: http://democrats.stanford.edu.

I am disappointed, though not surprised, to see un
doubtedly well-meaning liberals like Brandon Liver
ence ("Nader's campaign will hurt Democrats more
than Bush," March 1) fall into the old trap of blaming
Ralph Nader and third parties for the Democratic
Party's ills. This notion rests on the arrogant assumption

that everyone is simply "liberal," "conservative" or
somewhere in between, and a dissenter in the ranks is
somehow harmful to "liberal causes" (a phrase which
Liverence uses repeatedly in his op-ed without clarifica
tion as to what these causes are).
The real issue here is not whether there are clear dif
ferences between the Democrats and Republicans, but
whether there are clear differences between the
Democrats and Nader. There certainly are. He is not
merely another "liberal" in the race, but a true alterna
tive voice. The Democrats take nearly as much money
in corporate donations as the Republicans do, and in
return, they generally support "free" trade agreements
which perpetuate third world poverty, resist the decen
tralization of power to the state and local level and pay
lip service to such things as environmental protection
while taking no meaningful actions that might anger
their corporate donors. Rather than directing their
self-righteous anger at the few prominent opposition
figures in national politics, true progressives should be
outraged at a political system which ensures the con
tinued control of American government by two par
ties, and the continued domination of the two parties'
platforms by corporate interests, at the expense of
many human needs which conflict with big business's
profit motive.

Daily's statement on Viennese Ball's
special fee status incorrect
I would like to point out that The Daily's feature ar
ticle "Viennese Ball: Stanford tradition in jeopardy"
(March 1) incorrectly stated that the ASSU Constitu
tional Council ruled that the Viennese Ball Committee
"would not receive special fees for next year's event."

This is an inaccurate characterization of the rul
ing, which stated that the Viennese Ball Committee
violated Article V, Section 2. A.5 of the ASSU Con
stitution "by charging for services and receiving a
special fee."
The Viennese Ball Committee is free to apply fora
special fee for their services, but they cannot charge stu
dents in addition to this. This is similar to why The Stan
ford Daily is unable to charge students for its newspa
pers since it also receives special fees from them.
Finally, 1 believe 2004 Viennese Ball co-chair
Trang Pham's comments that her organization was
"unduly singled out" to be completely untrue. The Vi
ennese Ball Committee was given a one-year grace pe
riod to deal with the unconstitutionality of their ac
tions. In addition, all other special fees groups have
been made aware of this ruling and will therefore be
subject to the same constraints by the Undergraduate
Senate Appropriations Committee and the Graduate
Student Council.

Israel-Palestine activists should
engage in constructive dialogue
As students committed to mutual understanding and
creating common ground through sustained discussion
of the conflict in the Middle East, we, the members of
the Middle East Issues Dialogue (MEI) group find
David Horowitz's ad ("The Middle East War is not
about a Palestinian state or Palestinian land," Feb. 23)
and Ammar Nayfeh's response ("Advertisement mis
represented historical events in Palestine," Feb. 24) to
be counterproductive. Real education about any issue
and moving forward towards peace requires context

and compassion — something that was sadly lacking in
both pieces.
On this campus we have the unique opportunity to
talk civilly with those people whose opinions we might
find objectionable. This possibility lies at the heart of
education: By having such conversations we often real
ize that binary perspectives are an illusion, just as illu
sory as the monolithic groups — "Arabs" and "Zion
ists" — around which those aforementioned articles
frame their generalizations. Such generalizing serves
to make people defensive and hinders conversation,
when our goal should be the opposite: to create trust
ing environments for sincere discussion of these highly
complex issues.
The MEI group seeks to talk openly about the differ
ences among us on this issue. In doing so, we strive to un
derstand and develop empathy for one another's points
of view. It serves us well to understand who we are,
