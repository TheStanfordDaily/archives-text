# Election spurs political involvement
## 
### ANN CHIN STAFF WRITER 
The high turnout rate of young
voters in recent state primaries
across the nation has led to opti
mistic forecasts for today's primary
election in California. Early polls
predict a similarly high turnout
among young people for the presi
dential election in November.
According to the San Jose Mer
cury News, 17 percent of voters in the
lowa caucuses were under the age of
thirty, compared to 9 percent in 2000.
The number of voters in the under-30
age group also outnumbered those in
the 30-44 age group. A Harvard Uni
versity Institute of Politics survey
found that two-thirds of college stu
dents are registered to vote, and out of
those, 82 percent said they will vote
this year.
Though many Stanford students
said the growing political interest
among young people is due to dis
content with the current national ad
ministration, others expressed skep
ticism about this sudden change in
voting trends.
"I'll wait until I see it," said Political
Science Prof. Morris Fiorina. "In 2000
we were told to expect a big surge in
turnout because of the 'greatest voter
mobilization effort in history'.' It never
materialized."
Fiorina said that these early statis
tics are not necessarily representative
of the voters who will turn out for the
presidential election later this year.
"I'd say the lowa caucus result is
mostly a Dean effect," he said. "Bear
in mind that only 1 / 20 as many people
who voted in the caucuses as will vote

in lowa this November."
Before withdrawing from the race
two weeks ago. Democratic presiden
tial hopeful Howard Dean generated
widespread support on campuses na
tionwide, including at Stanford.
"He was able to speak with great
integrity and conviction about issues
that matter to folks our age," said
sophomore John Hamilton, co-coor
dinator of Stanford Students for
Dean. "He has been able to appeal to
many people who have been disen
chanted with the political system and
convince them that Bush's economic
and international policies have been
total failures."
Other students attribute the rising
political interest among the younger
population to concern over the coun
try's struggling economy.
"I think the status of the economy
is a huge factor in the higher voter
turnout, mainly because a lot of
younger people have a tough time
finding a job," said junior Peter Yu.
"As the problem persists, they start to
realize that it's the overall economy
that's at fault and that what the presi
dent or other political figures do is ac
tually very important to their own
well-being."
The turnout rate of younger voters
has been declining for several
decades. The University of Maryland
found that between 1972 and 2000,
the voting rate among Americans
under the age of 24 dropped 13 per
centage points.
Sophomore Tony Hung argued
that younger citizens do not vote be
cause none of the candidates offer an
alternative to the status quo.
"It's not that we think that our

votes don't count," he said. "It's that
our votes won't effect any change."
Many students said they do not
foresee a change in apathy any
time soon.
"It's nothing that can be changed
overnight," Hung said. "You're young.

you have your own agenda, and politics
doesn't really play a role in that."
Nonetheless, political groups on
campus said students have demon
strated much more interest this year

with the war in Iraq and the tight race for the Democrat
ic nomination.
Political groups leaning both left and right have taken
special measures on campus to encourage voting, includ
ing going to dorms to register voters and distribute flyers
to raise awareness.
"The Stanford Republicans are gathering more atten
tion as the election cycle approaches and in turn we've

begun stepping up our activities," said sophomore Bob
Sensenbrenner, the group's president.
Junior Dylan Mefford. president of the Stanford De
mocrats, explained that the organization's weekly meet
ings have tripled in attendance since last year.
"Our e-mail list has grown as well, and many people
have attended our events with Senator John Kerry and
Congresswoman Anna Eshoo," he said. "Stanford is
becoming more Democratic, as Bush's policies alien
ate students."

the 30-44 age group. A Harvard Uni
versity Institute of Politics survey
found that two-thirds of college stu
dents are registered to vote, and out of
those, 82 percent said they will vote
this year.
Though many Stanford students
said the growing political interest
among young people is due to dis
content with the current national ad
ministration, others expressed skep
ticism about this sudden change in
voting trends.
"I'll wait until I see it," said Political
Science Prof. Morris Fiorina. "In 2000
we were told to expect a big surge in
turnout because of the 'greatest voter
mobilization effort in history'.' It never
materialized."
Fiorina said that these early statis
tics are not necessarily representative
of the voters who will turn out for the
presidential election later this year.
"I'd say the lowa caucus result is
mostly a Dean effect," he said. "Bear
in mind that only 1 / 20 as many people
who voted in the caucuses as will vote

in lowa this November."
Before withdrawing from the race
two weeks ago. Democratic presiden
tial hopeful Howard Dean generated
widespread support on campuses na
tionwide, including at Stanford.
"He was able to speak with great
integrity and conviction about issues
that matter to folks our age," said
sophomore John Hamilton, co-coor
dinator of Stanford Students for
Dean. "He has been able to appeal to
many people who have been disen
chanted with the political system and
convince them that Bush's economic
and international policies have been
total failures."
Other students attribute the rising
political interest among the younger
population to concern over the coun
try's struggling economy.
"I think the status of the economy
is a huge factor in the higher voter
turnout, mainly because a lot of
younger people have a tough time
finding a job," said junior Peter Yu.
"As the problem persists, they start to
realize that it's the overall economy
that's at fault and that what the presi
dent or other political figures do is ac
tually very important to their own
well-being."
The turnout rate of younger voters
has been declining for several
decades. The University of Maryland
found that between 1972 and 2000,
the voting rate among Americans
under the age of 24 dropped 13 per
centage points.
Sophomore Tony Hung argued
that younger citizens do not vote be
cause none of the candidates offer an
alternative to the status quo.
"It's not that we think that our

votes don't count," he said. "It's that
our votes won't effect any change."
Many students said they do not
foresee a change in apathy any
time soon.
"It's nothing that can be changed
overnight," Hung said. "You're young.

you have your own agenda, and politics
doesn't really play a role in that."
Nonetheless, political groups on
campus said students have demon
strated much more interest this year

with the war in Iraq and the tight race for the Democrat
ic nomination.
Political groups leaning both left and right have taken
special measures on campus to encourage voting, includ
ing going to dorms to register voters and distribute flyers
to raise awareness.
"The Stanford Republicans are gathering more atten
tion as the election cycle approaches and in turn we've

begun stepping up our activities," said sophomore Bob
Sensenbrenner, the group's president.
Junior Dylan Mefford. president of the Stanford De
mocrats, explained that the organization's weekly meet
ings have tripled in attendance since last year.
"Our e-mail list has grown as well, and many people
have attended our events with Senator John Kerry and
Congresswoman Anna Eshoo," he said. "Stanford is
becoming more Democratic, as Bush's policies alien
ate students."
Early polls have led to high expectations for voter
turnout among the 18-30 age group in the November elec
tion as well.
