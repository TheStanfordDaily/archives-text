## Inquiring minds want to know, Spencer answers 
### 
It's mail hag time everybody! Time for Spencer
to respond to his loyal readers who have
emailed, called in or willed their questions to
him. Without further ado, here we go.
"Spencer, should all annoyingly inquisitive little
girl roles be eliminated from sports movies?" —
Kathy "The" Liu
After putting "Field of Dreams" as No. 1 on my
top-10 list of sports movies, I caught a lot of heat
from readers who claimed that the little girl (Karen)
eliminates the glorious film from contention as a
good sports movie. One reader hoped that Karen
would "just die!" after she choked on the hot dog,
forcing Moonlight Graham to leave the field — The
Field of Dreams.
Hold on a sec. that's one thing that I would man
date in every movie if I were a studio exec: stating
the title of the film somewhere in the movie. If you
have seen the classic Chris O'Donnell liber-drama
"Vertical Limit," you'll surely re-

call how every other line seems to
be. "The climbers have reached
their limit, their (dramatic pause)
Vertical Limit." Imagine how awe
some it could be, if Red said. "And
when I see Andy driving to the
Mexican border. I just know that
he had his redemption . . . his
Shawshank Redemption."
Okay, sorry, back to the annoy
ing girls. I agree, they usually have

no place in sports movies. This was my major prob
lem with "Remember the Titans": the coach's
daughter seemed to have more screen time than the
football games. But in terms of "Dreams," I'll let it
go. After all, the point of the movie is to pass the
game on to the next generation.
In the words of Max Kellerman: "Next Topic!"
"So Spencer, I hear you are in Oxford. How are
the British kids, are they any good at sports?" —
Kfir Gavrieli
After seeing the varsity Oxford-Cambridge bas
ketball game, no, no they aren't. Nowhere near
"good." In fact, I'm willing to say "quite terrible."
Of note in the game:
Only one player on the court was taller than six
foot-three.
One player played wearing wire-frame glasses.
And perhaps the most telling fact was that at
the end of the game, Cambridge's shooting
guard was embraced by his girlfriend, who had
to bend down to kiss him. He was six-foot, dom
inated the offensive glass and his girl towered
over him. Unbelievable.
"Does Mathletics count as a sport?" —
Karl Goodman
Karl (sigh)... shut up Karl.
"Why do they call it a cup? Why not the "ball
shield"? — Greg Larson
But Greg, is it really just a "ball shield"? I firmly
believe that a good protective cup does so much
more than just guard your testicles. It's a shoulder
to cry on, a pasta strainer in a pinch, and above all
else, a close friend. So the next time you need a fun
pirate eyepatch, an extra hand-drum or just a good
man-to-man talk, you'll be thanking me you don't
just think of your cup as a place to protect your fu
ture children.
"Is this Heaven?" — Shoeless Joe
"No, it's lowa."
But Joe, this is a special field, a Field of Dreams.
But really, can this happen? Please?
"So Spencer, any luck with British girls?" —
Every girl at Stanford
One word about the girls here: FRIGID. What's
cooler than being cool? Frigid. I was walking down
the street a few weeks ago and a British "bird" (look
at how I insert clever British vernacular into the col
umn! I'm such a good writer!) was wearing a "Uni
versity of San Francisco" sweatshirt. Now, being
from the Bay Area, I was pumped — a little home
town love in the U.K.! So as she approached, I said,
"Go Dons! Yeah USF!" and held out my hand for
her to high-five it.
I know, I'm a dork, but that's not the point.
The point is, not only did she walk right on by,
leaving me hanging, but she also stank-eyed me
with this "why-in-god's-name-would-I-ever-want
to-look-at-you-much-less-speak-to-you" look on
her face. I wanted to crawl in a hole and die.
Another true story: I was at a little house/col
lege party and at least the girls were beginning to
warm up to conversation with Americans, which
was a victory in and of itself. There were even some
cute girls there. It was real cool, and just as a girl was
smiling at me wider and wider, I was like, "Damn,
this is where all the nice, cute girls are ... oh my
God that is REVOLTING," as 1 saw her teeth. Dis
colored, out of place, gaps ahoy! — it was like 1357
A.D. all over again. It's called a toothbrush, look
into it! Wow.
"How many roads must a man walk down, before
you can call him a man?" — Bob Dylan
As my brother Ross would say, "The answer, my
friends, is three."
And finally, a question truly important to me:
"Spencer, how can I get more out of you? How
can I get additional columns and special ramblings
in addition to your Daily columns" — Hopefully
more people than just my mother
