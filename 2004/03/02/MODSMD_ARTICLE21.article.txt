# Volleyball stops skid with pair of wins
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Sweet victory. Twice.
Wins over California last Wednesday and
La Verne on Friday ended a season-high
seven game losing streak for the No. 12 Stan
ford men's volleyball team (6-11, 3-9 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation). The 3-0 vic
tories boosted the team's morale as well as
its record.
"These two games didn't entirely turn it
around, but they definitely helped, especially
our confidence," said Stanford junior middle
blocker Craig Buell, who notched a total of
17 kills over both matches.
Confidence will be essential as the Cardi
nal hits the road to take on No. 2 UCLA and
No. 11 UC-Irvine this week, as well as against
the rest of the stacked MPSF. After this
week, the Cardinal's remaining schedule in
cludes dates with conference foes Pepperdine
and Long Beach State, which are both in the
top five of the latest poll.
While the teams the Cardinal faced last
week aren't of that caliber — Cal is a club
team that participates in the Northern Cali
fornia Collegiate Volleyball League and La
Verne is Division 111 — Stanford's steady
play led to two impressive wins. It was an ef
fort that Stanford junior outside hitter David
Vogel, who led the team on Friday night with
12 kills, appreciated.
"I'd characterize these games as a test of
our ability to focus, to play consistently
against a club team and a division three
team," he said.
On Wednesday, Stanford came out
strong against the Bears in Burnham Pavil
ion, holding Cal to a .156 hitting percentage
to jump out to a one-game lead with a 30-22
victory. The pace slowed in game two, but
Vogel chipped in five kills to lead the Cardi
nal to a 30-25 win. Stanford closed out the
night with a win at 30-24 in game three fora
victory that coach Don Shaw credited large
ly to his team's good defense. Buell record
ed seven block assists for the night while the
Cardinal committed fewer receiving errors

than usual.
"I thought we passed the ball pretty well,"
Shaw said.
The same was true on Friday night, when
Stanford's relatively few errors made La
Verne's seem that much more obvious. The
Leopards started work on what would be a
.234 hitting percentage for the match in the
first game, when two consecutive La Verne
attack errors resulted in a Stanford lead at
19-9 and forced a Leopard timeout. Stanford
went on to take the first game 30-19.
Cardinal errors, on the other hand,
were minimized.
"We've been working on not making hit
ting errors and we did a good job of that,"
said Buell, who registered a .667 hitting per
centage for the match. Teammate Vogel,
who checked out his stats after the match to
find he had notched only three hitting er
rors, agreed.
"That's pretty good for me," he said.
Also hitting well was Stanford junior
outside hitter Pat Bomhack, who helped
the Cardinal to a 30-22 win in game two
with six kills.
With a 10-point lead at 21-11 in game three,
victory looked inevitable for Stanford but La
Verne went on a stunning 12-3 run to cut the
Cardinal lead to two at 24-22 and force a
timeout. The Cardinal responded with a
surge of its own, notching a 6-2 run to close
out the game and the match at 30-24.
In spite of the double wins and the marked
improvement, Vogel explained that there re
mains a lot to work on, especially in prepara
tion for more competitive MPSF teams, such
as UCLA and Irvine, which the Cardinal will
take on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
"I think blocking and serving [are key],"
he said. "Being a little more organized at the
net on defense, [and] keeping the ball in play
while still serving tough."
His coach agreed.
"The MPSF is so strong and the opposition
is much different than what we saw this
week," Shaw said on Friday. "We need to
maintain the intensity that we had tonight and
bring that with us on the road."
