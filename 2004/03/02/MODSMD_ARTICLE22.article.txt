# Cardinal captures 15th Pac-10 title
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Halfway through the 200-yard
breaststroke at the Pacific-10
Conference Championships this
weekend, Stanford senior Tara
Kirk was incredibly confused.
She felt like she was swimming
fast — too fast, in fact. She
couldn't understand why she
wasn't tired yet.
When Kirk touched the wall
and heard the cheering, she
looked up at the scoreboard but
could only see part of her time. Fi
nally, she saw it all — 1:07.13.
Kirk had broken her own
American record in the 200
breast.
"I was really excited |when I
realized it]," said Kirk, who set
the previous record at the NCAA
Championships as a sophomore
in 2002. "I didn't expect it be
cause I knew that it was going to
be a tough race. But I raced a
good strategy and got the
record."
Tough is an understatement.

Kirk was up against Oregon
State's Birte Steven, who has led
the NCAA in the 200 breast all
year, and Arizona State's Agnes
Kovacs, the defending Olympic
gold medalist in the 200-meter
breast.
"The measure of a great ath
lete is when the situation de
mands it, they deliver the best,"
said Stanford head coach Richard
Ouick. "And that's exactly what
Tara Kirk did. She used what
she's best at — speed — and set
the pace and just wore [Steven
and Kovacs] out."
Kirk's victory was merely a
cap to a thrilling weekend during
which No. 5 Stanford swimmers
and divers mounted a huge team
effort to win 1,380 points and
bring the squad's 15th Pac-10
Championship trophy home to
the Farm.
The Cardinal held off defend
ing champion and 2004 favorite
UCLA, which finished second
with 1,329 points. Arizona
nabbed a third-place finish with
1,221.5, followed by California

with 1,117.5. Arizona State gar
nered 863 points to round out the
top five.
"I think we surprised a lot of
people | by winning], especially be
cause our dual-meet season wasn't
as sparkling as it usually is," Kirk
said. "But we beat UCLA and we
beat Cal — [the two teams that
we lost to in the regular season] —
and we won it."
Kirk said that the Pac-10
meet, more so than any other
meet, requires incredible team
depth, because each race has 24
opportunities to score, as op
posed to the 16 chances in dual
and NCAA meets.
On Saturday — the final day
of competition — the Cardinal
scored 21 times to hold onto the
lead, which it held from the first
day of the Championships.
The freshman duo of Lauren
Costella and Morgan Hentzen
finished fourth and fifth, respec
tively, in the 1,650 freestyle race
on Saturday, capturing 51 points
between them.
Stanford juniors Kirsten

Gilbert and Marisa Wong, who
finished seventh and 11th place,
respectively, backed up Kirk's
performance in the 200.
Sophomore Dana Kirk shaved
two seconds off of her previous
career-best in the 200 butterfly,
hitting the wall at 1:54.00 and gar
nering a second-place finish.
Junior Tami Ransom was the
lone Cardinal to score in the 200
backstroke, finishing eighth in the
finals with a time of 2:01.89.
Six Stanford swimmers
made the top 24 in the 100 free,
with junior Lacey Boutwell
leading the way in third place.
Sophomore Ashley Daly also
swam in the finals, clocking in
at 51.00, good enough for
eighth place.
A relay team of Boutwell,
Daly, Dana Kirk and freshman
Desiree Stahley finished off the
Cardinal's charge in Long Beach,
Calif., with a third-place finish
and a time of 3:19.25.
While the swimmers were bat
tling for points in Long Beach, the
Stanford divers were competing

toward the team total in Federal
Way, Wash.
After finishing in seventh in
platform diving at the 2003 Pac
10s, sophomore Sara Bowling
roared back this year to finish
second with a score of 397.30. Ju
nior Erin Lashnits wasn't far be
hind in fifth place, while freshman
Brooke Sullivan rounded out the
effort with a ninth-place finish.
Freshman Cassidy Krug won
her first Pac-10 title in the one
meter dive with a 289.65 point
total that narrowly edged out
Arizona's Mary Yarrison. Junior
Ashlee Rosenthal scored 281.10
to finish in third place, while
Lashnits and Sullivan finished in
10th and 12th, respectively.
The diving squad next heads
to Oklahoma City, Okla., March
11-13 to compete at the NCAA
Zone E Meet, which will deter
mine which divers will qualify for
the NCAA Championships. The
swim team does not compete
again until NCAAs, which are to
be held March 18-20 in College
Station, Texas.
