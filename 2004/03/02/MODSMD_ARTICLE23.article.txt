### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis team (10-0)
continued its unbridled winning streak this weekend, rack
ing up huge wins over No. 24 Oregon and No. 9 California.
Stanford is off to a solid start in its Pacific-10 Conference dual
match season.
The Cardinal hunted down California in the Golden Bears'
own territory, racking up a Â£>-1 win at Hellman Tennis Complex
on Sunday.
After struggling to maintain her consistency against Oregon
on Friday, Stanford junior Erin Burdette (11-2) showed signs of
improvement in her No. 3 singles win over Catherine Lynch, (V
-4,6-3.
Ranked twelfth in the nation, Burdette snapped No. 88
Lynch's ten-match winning streak.
"My opponent was very scrappy," Burdette said. "[But| she
made me hit a lot of extra kills that most players wouldn't get to."
Burdette added, "I still didn't play great in singles; 1 played
gtxxl enough."
Teammates senior Lauren Bamikow, freshman Theresa
Logar, and senior Emilia Anderson enjoyed similar results in the
Nos. 4-6 singles slots, sweeping their opponents in straight sets.
Meanwhile, defending 2003 NCAA Singles Champion,
sophomore Amber Liu, suffered swift defeat in the top singles
position at the hands of second-ranked Raquel Kops-Jones.
No. 61 Liu has faced Kops-Jones five times in her collegiate ca
reer, losing four of the matches. The fifth match tix>k place at the
2003 NCAA Women's Tennis Championships and remained
unfinished with Liu barely in the lead, 7-5,4-3.
"I felt like it was a tough match for me serving-wise," said Liu

of Sunday's loss. "It was a little windy out there and I really didn't
feel like I served as well as I normally do. It was a good learning
experience though. It really makes me want to work harder to be
that much tougher when I play her the next time around."
In doubles, Stanford clinched the team point with victories in
the No. 1 and No. 2 positions. The top-ranked tandem of
Barnikow-Burdette continued their twelve-match winning
streak by overpowering Jieun Jacobs and Kops-Jones, 8-4.
The No. 2 duo of sophomore Alice Barnes and Liu emerged
victors over Nicole Havlicek and Sasha Podkolzina, 8-6.
Podkolzina is a freshman phenom, ranked No. 21 in singles
after reaching the finals of her first collegiate tournament. She is
usually paired with Kops-Jones in doubles.
Unfortunately, Podkolzina has been fighting off illness and
was absent from the singles lineup against Stanford.
"I think everyone agrees that Cal will be a tough[er| team if
and when their full line up is healthy," said Burdette. "We are all
looking forward to playing their full lineup at our next match-up
at home."
Stanford cruised by California after a 7-0 sweep of
Oregon on Friday. The shutout at Taube Family Tennis
Stadium marked the Cardinal's fourth consecutive
Ducks shutout.
Playing in the No. 5 singles position, freshman Theresa Logar
rea >rded the first singles win for Stanford, needing no more than an
h< >ur to defeat Ester Bak in straight sets, 6-1,6-2.
Competing in the top singles slot, Liu showed no mercy to
ward No. 7 Daria Panova in her 6-1,6-0 victory.
"Before the Oregon match, I put in a lot of time working on
my movement and ironing out my groundstrokes," Liu said. "1
wanted to make sure that I played solidly and that I had the
stamina to fight the entire match."
Liu continued, "I also put a lot of work into my serve, and it

really helped me, I felt like my first serves were very effective
on Friday."
The intensity of Liu's efforts was noted as she ran Panova
around the court during much of their match. Liu hit several
passing shots for winners, freezing Panova in place near the ser
vice line.
Liu tallied a single double fault in the match.
Competing in the No. 2 singles slot, sophomore Alice Barnes
also appeared to be in top form, trading stealthy backhand slices
with opponent Courtney Nagle.
No. 16 Barnes defeated Nagle 6-2,6-3, clinching the fourth,
game-winning point for Stanford.
In the final match of the day, Burdette struggled against No.
46 freshman Dominika Dieskova before pulling out a three-set
win, 6-3,4-6,1-0(8).
"My opponent was quite gcxxl at counterpunching at times
and my shots were not coming off too solidly," Burdette said.
"This combination led to some problems."
Burdette spent a lot of time hitting flat shots low to the
ground, especially against Dieskova's solid serve. Many of
these shots barely cleared the net, and several resulted in un
forced errors for the Cardinal.
Even the tiebreaker was a nail-biter for Burdette, as the op
ponents traded quick points. After hitting long two consecutive
forehands, Dieskova finally sealed her fate.
"I was not happy with how 1 played, [but] I was glad to squeak
out the win," Burdette said.
Stanford faces No. 14 Fresno State next, this Wednesday
at 1:30 p.m.
"We can't take Fresno State lightly," Liu said. "There
are a couple of new girls on the team that are pretty good,
so we have to prepare for this match like we would prepare
for any other."
