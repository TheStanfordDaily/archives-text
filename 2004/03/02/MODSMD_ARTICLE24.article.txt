# No. 7 Card goes 2-3 in desert
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE 
The No. 7 Stanford softball team (13-5)
weathered an uncommon amount of turbulence
during its flight home from the Arizona Wildcat
Invitational in Tucson, Ariz., on Sunday, but the
ride paled in comparison to the roller-coaster
weekend the Cardinal had just completed on the
field. Stanford, which lost in the tournament
championship game to Arizona, went 2-3 during
the wild weekend and three of its five games
were called after five innings due to collegiate
softball's eight-run "mercy rule."
Indeed, nothing went quite as expected for
the C ardinal. Stanford headed to Tucson know
ing that it would face its best competition to date
against undefeated and No. 2 Arizona (22-0). but
it was against No. 22 South Florida that the Car
dinal looked truly overmatched. In fact, the Car
dinal showed flashes of brilliance in two close
losses to the host Wildcats, including a 7-5 heart
breaker in the championship game on Sunday,
but Stanford failed to find any sort of rhythm in
a devastating 8-0 loss to the Bulls on Saturday.
The Cardinal dominated both of the un
ranked teams it faced this weekend, blanking
Oklahoma State, 10-0, in Friday's opener and
defeating Boston University, 8-0, on Saturday
evening.
Like Stanford's first game against the Wild
cats, a narrow 2-1 loss on a bases-loaded walk in
the bottom of the final inning on Friday, Sun

day's rematch proved to be a close battle. The
championship game was far from a pitching duel,
however, even though the two starting pitchers
were former All-Americans — senior ace Dana
Sorensen for Stanford and Alicia Hollowell for
Arizona.
Sorensen capped a difficult weekend by al
lowing three runs in four-plus innings before
yielding to sophomore pitcher Laura Severson,
who took the loss for the Cardinal to drop to 4-
2 on the year. Despite allowing five earned
runs, Hollowell went the distance fora com
plete game victory to move to a perfect 14-0 on
the season.
The Cardinal took a 5-4 lead in the top of the
sixth inning on a three-run home run by senior
catcher Jessica Allister, but Severson gave up
three runs in the bottom of the sixth to give Ari
zona back the lead and push the score to its final
7-5 tally.
With the exception of Stanford's first loss to
Arizona on Friday afternoon, none of the Cardi
nal's first four games of the weekend lasted past
the fifth inning due to collegiate softball's
"mercy rule," which stipulates that if a team
holds an eight-run lead at the end of five innings,
the game is called.
The Cardinal made quick work of Oklahoma
State on Friday morning as the squad smashed
four home runs en route to a season-high 10 runs
in a 10-0 victory. Allister and sophomore short
stop Lauren Lappin hit back-to-back home runs
in the bottom of the first inning to give the Car

dinal an early lead and sophomore center
fielder Catalina Morris smacked a towering
grand slam in the bottom of the second. Junior
first baseman Michelle Thiry went deep in the
fourth to pad the Stanford lead and Sorensen
pitched well, shutting out the Cowgirls over
five innings for her seventh victory.
Against South Florida, Bulls pitcher Leigh
Ann Ellis allowed only two baserunners over
five scoreless innings, while Sorensen and
freshman Danika Dukes yielded four runs
apiece in a Cardinal loss. Morris connected for
both of Stanford's hits.
The Cardinal came out re-energized in Sat
urday's second game and coasted to an 8-0 vic
tory against Boston University. Severson was
the star of the day in the circle, pitching a com
plete game one-hitter with eight strikeouts to
earn her fourth victory of the season. Lappin
added a home run and four RBIs and junior
jack-of-all trades Megan Sickler connected for
a home run and three RBIs in her first career
start at third base for the Cardinal.
The tournament showed many of the Car
dinal's strengths but also exposed the team's
weaknesses, particularly in the South Florida
debacle. If the Cardinal wishes to succeed in
the Pacific-10 Conference regular season, it
must show marked improvement in the next
couple of weeks before league play. Stanford
will look fora more consistent performance
when it travels to the Worth Invitational in
Fullerton, Calif., next weekend.

weekend. The Cardinal fell to No. 2 Arizona twice, including a 7-5 setback in
the tournament championship game on Sunday.
The No. 7 Stanford softball team (13-5)
weathered an uncommon amount of turbulence
during its flight home from the Arizona Wildcat
Invitational in Tucson, Ariz., on Sunday, but the
ride paled in comparison to the roller-coaster
weekend the Cardinal had just completed on the
field. Stanford, which lost in the tournament
championship game to Arizona, went 2-3 during
the wild weekend and three of its five games
were called after five innings due to collegiate
softball's eight-run "mercy rule."
Indeed, nothing went quite as expected for
the C ardinal. Stanford headed to Tucson know
ing that it would face its best competition to date
against undefeated and No. 2 Arizona (22-0). but
it was against No. 22 South Florida that the Car
dinal looked truly overmatched. In fact, the Car
dinal showed flashes of brilliance in two close
losses to the host Wildcats, including a 7-5 heart
breaker in the championship game on Sunday,
but Stanford failed to find any sort of rhythm in
a devastating 8-0 loss to the Bulls on Saturday.
The Cardinal dominated both of the un
ranked teams it faced this weekend, blanking
Oklahoma State, 10-0, in Friday's opener and
defeating Boston University, 8-0, on Saturday
evening.
Like Stanford's first game against the Wild
cats, a narrow 2-1 loss on a bases-loaded walk in
the bottom of the final inning on Friday, Sun

day's rematch proved to be a close battle. The
championship game was far from a pitching duel,
however, even though the two starting pitchers
were former All-Americans — senior ace Dana
Sorensen for Stanford and Alicia Hollowell for
Arizona.
Sorensen capped a difficult weekend by al
lowing three runs in four-plus innings before
yielding to sophomore pitcher Laura Severson,
who took the loss for the Cardinal to drop to 4-
2 on the year. Despite allowing five earned
runs, Hollowell went the distance fora com
plete game victory to move to a perfect 14-0 on
the season.
The Cardinal took a 5-4 lead in the top of the
sixth inning on a three-run home run by senior
catcher Jessica Allister, but Severson gave up
three runs in the bottom of the sixth to give Ari
zona back the lead and push the score to its final
7-5 tally.
With the exception of Stanford's first loss to
Arizona on Friday afternoon, none of the Cardi
nal's first four games of the weekend lasted past
the fifth inning due to collegiate softball's
"mercy rule," which stipulates that if a team
holds an eight-run lead at the end of five innings,
the game is called.
The Cardinal made quick work of Oklahoma
State on Friday morning as the squad smashed
four home runs en route to a season-high 10 runs
in a 10-0 victory. Allister and sophomore short
stop Lauren Lappin hit back-to-back home runs
in the bottom of the first inning to give the Car

dinal an early lead and sophomore center
fielder Catalina Morris smacked a towering
grand slam in the bottom of the second. Junior
first baseman Michelle Thiry went deep in the
fourth to pad the Stanford lead and Sorensen
pitched well, shutting out the Cowgirls over
five innings for her seventh victory.
Against South Florida, Bulls pitcher Leigh
Ann Ellis allowed only two baserunners over
five scoreless innings, while Sorensen and
freshman Danika Dukes yielded four runs
apiece in a Cardinal loss. Morris connected for
both of Stanford's hits.
The Cardinal came out re-energized in Sat
urday's second game and coasted to an 8-0 vic
tory against Boston University. Severson was
the star of the day in the circle, pitching a com
plete game one-hitter with eight strikeouts to
earn her fourth victory of the season. Lappin
added a home run and four RBIs and junior
jack-of-all trades Megan Sickler connected for
a home run and three RBIs in her first career
start at third base for the Cardinal.
The tournament showed many of the Car
dinal's strengths but also exposed the team's
weaknesses, particularly in the South Florida
debacle. If the Cardinal wishes to succeed in
the Pacific-10 Conference regular season, it
must show marked improvement in the next
couple of weeks before league play. Stanford
will look fora more consistent performance
when it travels to the Worth Invitational in
Fullerton, Calif., next weekend.
