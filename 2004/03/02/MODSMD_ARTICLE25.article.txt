# Cheer posts double-digit improvement at Nationals

### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Cardinal Competitive Cheer
competed at the United Spirit Association collegiate na
tionals in Sin City on Sunday and came away with its best
scores ever, as the five judges scored Stanford between
75 and 79.
Stanford's score was a double-digit improvement
compared to last year's, when the team's scores ranged
from 64 to 67.
"The improvement was mainly [in] difficulty level,"
head coach Gina Sanchez said. "They pulled off a lot of
good stuff in their routine."
"Just seeing their tapes from last year, it's amazing
how they've grown," assistant coach Jane Choi added.
Although the team's score wasn't enough to land it a
slot in yesterday's finals, the competition was not so much
about other teams as the squad's own improvement.
"I think it went really well, just considering nerves
and being a second-year program," said Brooke Dooley,
the squad's lone senior.
Held at the Cashman Center (a convention center
and auditorium), the weekend featured dozens of co-ed
and all-girl cheer teams as well as a plethora of partner
and group stunt teams and dance squads.
In Stanford's group — four-year, large, co-ed college
show cheer — the Cardinal went up against West Coast
teams, including finalists and fellow Pacific-10 Confer
ence schools Oregon, Oregon State and Arizona State.
Not surprisingly, this category proves highly competi
tive every year, and the top first-round score was an av
erage of 92.4 from the panel of judges.
"It kind of goes with who has good basketball and

football teams," Sanchez said in naming the best teams.
"We're just moving up the curve."
By comparison, the small group, four-year, co-ed di
vision posted a top score of almost 10 points lower. Car
dinal Cheer, which wants to make it to finals next year,
may switch to this category (which requires six to 19
team members).
"Had we competed in the small division, we
would've been at roughly the same level [of scoring],"
said Sanchez, who explained that this year's squad was
unexpectedly large due to increased interest and the
welcomed but unexpected addition of three new men
in the fall.
The auditorium was filled with cheer squads and
their friends and family and created an intense, support
ive atmosphere — even at the end of a 12-hour day.
Teams didn't just show up to perform but got there early
and stayed late to see other squads.
"When the All-Star squads come up, they're unbe
lievable," junior Renee Burrull said. "They'll do stuff
and you'll be like, 'How did they even think of that?' "
In additio* to this atmosphere, competitive cheer dif
fers from what a spectator sees at football or basketball
games in that it is much more performance-oriented —
there's a lot more than just cheering, and it's all encom
passed in a mix of tumbling, dance and stunting (where
a cheerleader is lifted or thrown into the air, sometimes
as part of a complicated formation, and then strikes a
pose or performs acrobatics).
In other words, the performances go far beyond what
is feasible to perform at a sporting event. Which isn't to
say that the squads don't enjoy those performances, but
just that the competition is what it's really all about.
"This is the only reason I cheer — competition,"

freshman Vein Taylor said. "It gives us a purpose."
Sophomore Noriko Boyd concurred.
"It makes it less superficial," she said. "Especial
ly at Stanford ... It definitely gives us another pur
pose and a way to represent Stanford in a way no one
has before."
And, like any athletic competition, last weekend's
Nationals were not without their physical costs. An Ari
zona State cheerleader broke her leg in the competition
immediately preceding Stanford's, and two All-Star
squads lost members mid-competition due to similar leg
injuries. The show doesn't stop, though, and the squad
completes its routine while the injured party tries to drag
themselves offstage.
In addition to this, most routines feature a rough
landing or a fall or two, as teams tend to take a few risks
in every performance in hopes of sticking it and separat
ing themselves from the competition. And that's just the
finished product.
"Sometimes [practices] are worse, because you have
to learn it," sophomore Desiree' Conrad said. "It's like,
That was my head, but let's do it again.' "
Stanford is no stranger to injury itself. The most in
tense example is junior Chelsea Dudek, one of the
team's founders, who tore her ACL and MCL at a bas
ketball game last year and then tore her other ACL at a
football game last year — and still came back to com
pete at Nationals this year.
"She rehabbed so hard," Sanchez said. "She really
wanted to compete."
While Dudek was working hard just to get back on
the floor, the rest of the team was attending early-morn
ing practices and doing individual gym work.
"You have to be able to have upper body and lower

body strength, a lot of technical skills," said freshman
Richard Barbour. "And with the girls, you're looking to
be tight and have good muscle control. [And] it involves
a lot of body control and flexibility."
For many of the team members, cheer is a new expe
rience, rather than the lifelong pursuit of so many of the
cheerleaders at Nationals.
"There are a ton of people on the team who've never
cheered before," freshman Rebecca Sawyer said.
That's a stark contrast to Stanford's competition at
nationals, which is made up of lifelong competitors who
often receive cheerleading scholarships. By contrast,
Stanford's team is almost entirely self-funded. But that
hasn't dampened its enthusiasm.
"We have people who've never had cheer experi
ence, and we're putting up Swedish falls," Conrad said,
referring to the penultimate stunt of Stanford's show.
Of course, though, cheer is all about energy and en
thusiasm, and Cardinal Cheer is no exception. This is
Vegas, after all, and the only competition the squad
competes in each year. In other words, they're already
talking about what they want to do on and off the mats
next year.
"This is the bonding that takes place," Sanchez said
Saturday as the team joked around in the Motel 6 park
ing lot. "This is for next year. When they're working
their butts off, you remind them of this."
The squad is in just its second year and has faced
a steep learning curve trying to catch up to the
West Coast elite teams, but that hasn't discour
aged the team.
"They've only been doing this two years, but you
know, they're Stanford people, so they think, 'Why can't
we [compete at that level]?' " Choi said.
