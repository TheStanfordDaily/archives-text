# Water polo falls victim to Trojans for second time this year in Gaucho Invite
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It can certainly hang with the best and it
definitely has what it takes to be the best,
but can the Stanford women's water polo
team beat the best?
Not quite yet.
Despite an 8-5 loss to No. 1 Southern
California (11-0, 3-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in the championship
game of the Gaucho Invitational at UC-
Santa Barbara, the Cardinal (8-2, 2-0)
demonstrated once again that it has the
skill and talent to compete with the superi
or teams in the country.
Saturday marked the second time this
season No. 2 Stanford played the Trojans
tough and lost. The Cardinal lost to USC
10-8 at the Stanford Invitational on Feb. 7.
"Two losses to USC is definitely disap
pointing," said Stanford junior defender
Hannah Luber.
While it couldn't outlast the Trojans,
the Cardinal continued to trounce the rest
of its competition with outstanding offense
and solid defense, adding three wins to its
record over the weekend and moving up a
notch in the polls to second.
Stanford faced UC-San Diego (6-10) in
its first game on Saturday and earned a 6-0
win, the first shutout of the season fora de
serving young Stanford team. Luber led all
scorers with three goals.
"In the first game of tournament, it is

nice to put away a team early," Faust said.
"Hopefully we'll get a few more of those
later in the season."
With 16 shots, the Tritons had many op
portunities to score, but the Stanford de
fense was up to the challenge. UCSD
failed to convert on penalty shots while
Stanford scored during three of its six
man-up situations.
The Cardinal defeated No. 6 California
9-7 later that day. After finishing the first
period with a 2-1 lead, the Cardinal played
well to maintain a lead throughout the
game. The Bears (5-5, 1-1) scored twice in
the fourth period but the Stanford defense
shut the door on any chance of a comeback.
Luber and freshman Christine Hewko
paced the Cardinal with two goals apiece
while Cal's top scorer Jodie Needles had
three goals in the loss.
Stanford had a come-from-behind win
against UCLA in the semifinal on Sunday
morning. Both teams came out very com
petitive in their first contest since they
faced each other in the NCAA champi
onships last year.
"We hadn't played UCLA yet this year
so we were really excited going into the
game," Luber said.
At the end of the half, the score stood at
3-3. The intensity continued as the squads
went back and forth and UCLA took a 5-4
lead into the fourth period. Stanford put up
two goals to escape with the close 6-5 win.
Finally, the Cardinal faced the Trojans

for the tournament title on Sunday after
noon. The third period ended in a 5-5 tie
but the Trojans scored three unanswered
goals in the fourth and fended off the Car
dinal for the rest of the game. USC's Erika
Figge got four shots past the Stanford de
fense. With the 8-5 loss, the Cardinal set
tled for second place.
"We had them all the way to the fourth
quarter, so it was a little disappointing that
we couldn't finish that off," Luber said.
Luber was the team-high scorer for the
tournament with eight goals, followed by
Faust and senior Wendy Watkins who had
four apiece. While the team's usual offen
sive threats led the way, six other Stanford
players scored as well.
"This year we have so many players that
are talented in all parts of their game," said
goalkeeper Meredith McColl. "Yet despite
the common strengths, each player adds
their twists of individuality as well. Togeth
er, we make a very strong team."
Perhaps with that mix of talent, depth,
strength and individuality, Stanford might
soon prove that not only can it be included
among the nation's best, but that it is the
best.
"USC being the only team who is still
undefeated really shows that they are the
team to beat but it's hard to be undefeat
ed," Faust said. "It's just a matter of learn
ing what we do that lets USC get easy
scores or great shots in. But we will get
them eventually."

ed," Faust said. "It's just a matter of learn
ing what we do that lets USC get easy
scores or great shots in. But we will get
them eventually."

The No. 2 Stanford women's water polo team defense sparkled in a 6-0 shutout of UC-San
Diego in the Gaucho Invite last weekend. Stanford defeated Cal and UCLA as well before
losing to No. 1 USC in the championship game.
It can certainly hang with the best and it
definitely has what it takes to be the best,
but can the Stanford women's water polo
team beat the best?
Not quite yet.
Despite an 8-5 loss to No. 1 Southern
California (11-0, 3-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) in the championship
game of the Gaucho Invitational at UC-
Santa Barbara, the Cardinal (8-2, 2-0)
demonstrated once again that it has the
skill and talent to compete with the superi
or teams in the country.
Saturday marked the second time this
season No. 2 Stanford played the Trojans
tough and lost. The Cardinal lost to USC
10-8 at the Stanford Invitational on Feb. 7.
"Two losses to USC is definitely disap
pointing," said Stanford junior defender
Hannah Luber.
While it couldn't outlast the Trojans,
the Cardinal continued to trounce the rest
of its competition with outstanding offense
and solid defense, adding three wins to its
record over the weekend and moving up a
notch in the polls to second.
Stanford faced UC-San Diego (6-10) in
its first game on Saturday and earned a 6-0
win, the first shutout of the season fora de
serving young Stanford team. Luber led all
scorers with three goals.
"In the first game of tournament, it is

nice to put away a team early," Faust said.
"Hopefully we'll get a few more of those
later in the season."
With 16 shots, the Tritons had many op
portunities to score, but the Stanford de
fense was up to the challenge. UCSD
failed to convert on penalty shots while
Stanford scored during three of its six
man-up situations.
The Cardinal defeated No. 6 California
9-7 later that day. After finishing the first
period with a 2-1 lead, the Cardinal played
well to maintain a lead throughout the
game. The Bears (5-5, 1-1) scored twice in
the fourth period but the Stanford defense
shut the door on any chance of a comeback.
Luber and freshman Christine Hewko
paced the Cardinal with two goals apiece
while Cal's top scorer Jodie Needles had
three goals in the loss.
Stanford had a come-from-behind win
against UCLA in the semifinal on Sunday
morning. Both teams came out very com
petitive in their first contest since they
faced each other in the NCAA champi
onships last year.
"We hadn't played UCLA yet this year
so we were really excited going into the
game," Luber said.
At the end of the half, the score stood at
3-3. The intensity continued as the squads
went back and forth and UCLA took a 5-4
lead into the fourth period. Stanford put up
two goals to escape with the close 6-5 win.
Finally, the Cardinal faced the Trojans

for the tournament title on Sunday after
noon. The third period ended in a 5-5 tie
but the Trojans scored three unanswered
goals in the fourth and fended off the Car
dinal for the rest of the game. USC's Erika
Figge got four shots past the Stanford de
fense. With the 8-5 loss, the Cardinal set
tled for second place.
"We had them all the way to the fourth
quarter, so it was a little disappointing that
we couldn't finish that off," Luber said.
Luber was the team-high scorer for the
tournament with eight goals, followed by
Faust and senior Wendy Watkins who had
four apiece. While the team's usual offen
sive threats led the way, six other Stanford
players scored as well.
"This year we have so many players that
are talented in all parts of their game," said
goalkeeper Meredith McColl. "Yet despite
the common strengths, each player adds
their twists of individuality as well. Togeth
er, we make a very strong team."
Perhaps with that mix of talent, depth,
strength and individuality, Stanford might
soon prove that not only can it be included
among the nation's best, but that it is the
best.
"USC being the only team who is still
undefeated really shows that they are the
team to beat but it's hard to be undefeat
ed," Faust said. "It's just a matter of learn
ing what we do that lets USC get easy
scores or great shots in. But we will get
them eventually."
