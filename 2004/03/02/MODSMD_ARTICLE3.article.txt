# Newsweek and SIIS sponsor national security panel
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday at noon, the Stanford
Institute for International Studies
and Newsweek Magazine co-hosted a
panel discussion entitled "Perspec
tives on National Security." The
event, which was held in Encina Hall,
is part of Newsweek's "Road to the
Whitehouse" series, which co-hosts
events at colleges to publicize impor
tant issues in the upcoming elections.
The panelists were Democratic
representative Jane Harman; Deputy
Director of the Stanford Institute for
International Studies Prof. Stephen
Krasner; Newsweek Senior Editor
Michael Hirsh; and former Secretary
of Defense and Professor of Manage
ment Science & Engineering Prof.
William Perry. The panel was mod
erated by Newsweek Investigative
Correspondent Michael Isikoff.
An audience that included Viet
nam veterans, students, faculty, cor
porate sponsors and University
President John Hennessey gathered
to listen to the panelists discuss a

wide array of topics, such as Iraq,
North Korea, nuclear proliferation
and the Bush administration. They
also touched upon post-Sept. 11 in
telligence and the current situation
in Haiti.
Representative Harman stated
that currently, the biggest threats to
national security were terrorism and
the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. She described nuclear
disarmament in Libya and the cam
paign against al-Qaeda as positive
developments on the world scene,
but remained critical of other current
policies, particularly in Iran, North
Korea and Israel.
"We have used excessively used
military tools instead of 'soft power,' "
Harman said. "Frankly, in the up
coming election there will be chance
for the Democratic nominee to con
trast positions with Bush â€” positions
that are different, not weaker. They
are critically important. We should
be judging our presidential candi
dates based on credibility on these is
sues," she said.
However, Krasner argued fora

strong American role in peacekeep
ing and security issues, especially in
the "historically unique international
environment" in the world today that
created a need for frequent Ameri
can intervention, despite the opin
ions of other countries.
"For the first time in history,
small extremely weak states can
damage much larger states in serious
ways," he said. "We need to create
domestic governments in rogue or
failing states."
Krasner prescribed a stronger
U.S. stance despite protests from al
lied European nations over issues of
national sovereignty in smaller,
weaker countries.
"Prospects of aligning ourselves
are dim," he said. "The U.S. is going
to have to take a decisive role. If we
try to take a uni-polar approach from
the beginning, we will fail," he said.
Perry disagreed with Krasner on
the issue of coordination and said
that the war on terrorism required in
ternational cooperation. He criti

alienating other countries and fo
cused on security issues in coun
tries other than Iraq.
Although he agreed with the
priorities of the Bush administra
tion, he felt that execution of
those priorities had been poor.
On the subject of nuclear disar
mament, Perry drew attention to
the failure to act in North Korea,
calling it a major setback in for
eign policy.
"The problem of loose nukes is
worse off by far today than it
needs to be," he said.
Hirsh added a different per
spective to the panel by shar
ing details of his experience
with American occupying
forces in Iraq, where he was
recently assigned.
Hirsh described the troops
creeping along walls of Iraqi
towns, breaking down doors at
any location where insurgents
were reported to be hiding.
"Once they get inside people's
homes, they are pressed into a
counterinsurgency, intelligence
gathering role that they're poorly
suited for. They didn't even have a
translator until a few months
ago," Hirsh recounted. "They
round up everybody. Everyone is
a suspect."
"While I'm extremely leery of
comparing the situation to Viet
nam ~ . there is a similarity in
the sense that we no longer know
who we're really fighting," Hirsh
said. "The insurgency has be
come hydra-headed. This is a sit
uation we have to get out of as
soon as possible."
However, Hirsh said that de
spite the conditions in Iraq, the
soldiers were inspiring.
"It's a godawful place," he said.
"Morale was very high, which was
amazing to me."
Recent violence in Haiti was
brought up by several of the pan
elists, serving as a focal point for
discussing America's role on the
worid stage.
"What happens in Haiti is im
portant to American security.
This was dramatically illustrated
in '94. That was a huge problem
for the U.S. and it's the type of
problem that's starting to mani

fest itself again. We should have
acted sooner." Perry said, refer
ring to a 1994 incident in which
Haitian residents sailing to Flori
da were detained by the U.S. gov
ernment and held at Guan
tanamo Bay.
Representative Harman called
Haiti an example of a "failed re
construction" and called for more
extensive post-war and post-con
flict planning. "I would consider
nation-building a function of our
Defense department. We ought to
budget for it. We ought to learn
from the past," she said.
Krasner characterized inter
vention in Haiti as a necessary
part of America's international
mission, suggesting international
oversight of Haitian elections.
"How do we create decent domes
tic governments in rogue or failing
states like this?" Krasner asked
the audience.
The panelists also spoke at
length about intelligence issues
and the recent chain of events
surrounding the justifications for
invasion of Iraq that have
sparked embarrassment for the
Bush administration.
"We were all wrong," said Har
man, referring to flawed prewar
intelligence on weapons of mass
destruction. "It's a lesson that
must be learned. We have to fix
our intelligence now."
However, the Congresswoman
defended her pro-invasion vote,
based on the information that
was given to House members at
the time.
"The heft of what we heard
over and over and over again was
'We are confident that this is a na
tion has chemical and biological
weapons.' They didn't say 'pro
gram-related activities.' They
said 'has,' " Harman recounted.
"That was the gist of what we were
told. Looking back, I don't regret
my vote."
Krasner spoke up on behalf of
the Bush administration. He char
acterized the invasion as a preven
tive measure taken in good faith,
emphasizing the political risk to
Bush that the issue has become.
"In hindsight, I would not
have gone into Iraq," he said. "It
was always clear that, while it
might be easy to conquer Iraq, it
would not be easy to put it back
together again."
Perry echoed Krasner's skepti

cism over "poor planning" in the
reconstruction of Iraq and also
criticized the administration for
failing to prioritize al-Qaeda over
Iraq in the war on terrorism.
"We are paying a very heavy
price for that today," he added. "I
fully agree with Bush's priority,
but I believe his strategies do not
act on it."
Krasner denied that the idea
that the invasion of Iraq was un
dertaken for publicity purposes.
"I don't imagine Karl Rove sitting
around thinking, 'Will this get
Bush reelected?'" he quipped.
Krasner also reiterated his po
sition on America's role in inter
national politics, which he called
"American decisiveness."
"The situation that is in
escapable is that we are the most
likely to be targeted. At some
point we are going to have to act
independently," he said.
Although the general trend of
presidential elections is domestic
economic issues at the top of the
agenda, the speakers all agreed
that international issues would
replace those concerns this elec
tion year.
"This election may well be the
first in at least 30 years when it's
the exception to that rule," Isikoff
said. "National security issues,
foreign policy and the war on ter
rorism are at least as predominant
as the economy and may well be
the most important factors.
That's why we want to spend more
time exploring these issues."
Isikoff also asked Harman,
who recently returned from de
briefing, about the probability of
capturing Osama Bin Laden. She
declined to state a "bottom-line
probability," but added, "I do
think more brain cells could have
been devoted to this problem be
fore getting mired down in Iraq."
"I don't know about the so
called 'October Surprise,' though
rumors are rampant," Harman
said, alluding to the possibility
that Bin Laden has already been
cornered by the Army. "There are
rumors that this guy will be de
frosted in October," she joked
amid laughter from the audience.
"But even I don't believe that."
