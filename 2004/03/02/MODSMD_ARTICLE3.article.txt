### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday at noon, the Stanford
Institute for International Studies
and Newsweek Magazine co-hosted a
panel discussion entitled "Perspec
tives on National Security." The
event, which was held in Encina Hall,
is part of Newsweek's "Road to the
Whitehouse" series, which co-hosts
events at colleges to publicize impor
tant issues in the upcoming elections.
The panelists were Democratic
representative Jane Harman; Deputy
Director of the Stanford Institute for
International Studies Prof. Stephen
Krasner; Newsweek Senior Editor
Michael Hirsh; and former Secretary
of Defense and Professor of Manage
ment Science & Engineering Prof.
William Perry. The panel was mod
erated by Newsweek Investigative
Correspondent Michael Isikoff.
An audience that included Viet
nam veterans, students, faculty, cor
porate sponsors and University
President John Hennessey gathered
to listen to the panelists discuss a

wide array of topics, such as Iraq,
North Korea, nuclear proliferation
and the Bush administration. They
also touched upon post-Sept. 11 in
telligence and the current situation
in Haiti.
Representative Harman stated
that currently, the biggest threats to
national security were terrorism and
the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. She described nuclear
disarmament in Libya and the cam
paign against al-Qaeda as positive
developments on the world scene,
but remained critical of other current
policies, particularly in Iran, North
Korea and Israel.
"We have used excessively used
military tools instead of 'soft power,' "
Harman said. "Frankly, in the up
coming election there will be chance
for the Democratic nominee to con
trast positions with Bush â€” positions
that are different, not weaker. They
are critically important. We should
be judging our presidential candi
dates based on credibility on these is
sues," she said.
However, Krasner argued fora

strong American role in peacekeep
ing and security issues, especially in
the "historically unique international
environment" in the world today that
created a need for frequent Ameri
can intervention, despite the opin
ions of other countries.
"For the first time in history,
small extremely weak states can
damage much larger states in serious
ways," he said. "We need to create
domestic governments in rogue or
failing states."
Krasner prescribed a stronger
U.S. stance despite protests from al
lied European nations over issues of
national sovereignty in smaller,
weaker countries.
"Prospects of aligning ourselves
are dim," he said. "The U.S. is going
to have to take a decisive role. If we
try to take a uni-polar approach from
the beginning, we will fail," he said.
Perry disagreed with Krasner on
the issue of coordination and said
that the war on terrorism required in
ternational cooperation. He criti
cized the Bush administration for
