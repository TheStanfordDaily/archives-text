# Mass for Dean keeps fighting, despite drop-out

(U-WIRE) BOSTON —
"BEANTOWN IS DEANTOWN"
and "Hope Not Fear" signs plaster
the outside of the Massachusetts for
Dean Headquarters in Cambridge's
Central Square. Passersby glance
curiously through the windows, the
signs obscuring their view.
After realizing little is left of for
mer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean's
presidential campaign, most contin
ue to walk. But hope is not lost, says
Massachusetts for Dean grassroots
coordinator Dorothy Keville.
"We've not given up," Keville
says. "We want his message to go
forward. He has asked us to vote for
him in the primaries."
A sign in the middle of the side
walk in front of the small former
jewelry store echoes Keville's senti
ments: "We are still open. Come in
side to find out why."
An event calendar stretches
across the wall in the sticker and sign
littered headquarters, with rallies
and stump speeches filling each day
before Feb. 15 with few scheduled
after that date.
Keville says the organization was
one of the most active Dean cam
paigns in the nation and still is. She
adds that the group not only focused
on promoting Dean in Massachu
setts, but has traveled to other states,
written letters and donated money.
Mass for Dean hopes to win 15
percent of the votes in each of Mass-
congressional districts to
get his issues, which include fiscal re

sponsibility, balancing the budget
and universal health care, on the De
mocratic National Convention plat
form.
Even though Dean formally
dropped out of the race for the De
mocratic presidential nomination,
his name remains on the ballot, giv
ing staffers hope even as they under
stand why he left.
"He didn't have a choice," says
Mass for Dean Office Manager Brad
Johnson. "After he lost lowa, it was
too late."
But Keville is more forgiving of
Dean's choice to leave the race.
"I support his decision," she says.
"I think that the way the media was
treating him in the early primaries
made it even more difficult for him
to continue."
Keville was in lowa during the
caucuses and was a witness to the so
called "Dean scream."
"We didn't hear it as a scream,"
Keville says."He wasn't angry. He
was enthusiastic, responding to the
crowd."
As a delegate for two Democrat
ic presidential candidates, George
McGovern and Bill Bradley, Keville
knows how the DNC works and how
it has evolved.
"I was the 'K' in 'Stop Dike
Bombing"' Keville says, reminiscing
on how protesting was once allowed
on the DNC floor during the Viet
nam War era. She says that now the
Democratic Party has much more
stringent rules.
Despite the changes, Keville says
she has applied to be a delegate for
Dean — whether she actually will be

one depends on whether he receives
enough votes in her district.
She says Mass for Dean is plan
ning a rally to muster up support and
to educate people on why it is im
portant to make sure Dean's issues
are heard.
"The primary is the most impor
tant part of the process," she says.
"Everybody I've talked to, except
|for] one person, is sticking with
Dean. Whether or not they'll go out
and vote I don't know."
While education is the main goal
of Mass for Dean's new plan of ac
tion, they have little choice since do
nations have plummeted, Keville
says.
"We don't have any money," she
says. Mass for Dean's limited budget
aside, Keville says that supporters
are putting an advertisement in the
Boston Metro by pooling personal
contributions.
Johnson explains how Dean's
campaign unraveled, saying that
Dean "called out" three major insti
tutions and that his campaign was
not strong enough to handle the af
termath.
Dean directly threatened Bush
and the Republican Party, con
demned the media and demanded
that the Democratic Party stop tak
ing the easy road and stand up for
core values it seemed to have lost,
Johnson says.
"In theory, things could have
been done better," Johnson says."I
don't really have any recriminations.
The big thing is that I think time will
show how remarkably successful
Dean's campaign was."

Mass for Dean hopes to win 15
percent of the votes in each of Mass-
congressional districts to
get his issues, which include fiscal re

sponsibility, balancing the budget
and universal health care, on the De
mocratic National Convention plat
form.
Even though Dean formally
dropped out of the race for the De
mocratic presidential nomination,
his name remains on the ballot, giv
ing staffers hope even as they under
stand why he left.
"He didn't have a choice," says
Mass for Dean Office Manager Brad
Johnson. "After he lost lowa, it was
too late."
But Keville is more forgiving of
Dean's choice to leave the race.
"I support his decision," she says.
"I think that the way the media was
treating him in the early primaries
made it even more difficult for him
to continue."
Keville was in lowa during the
caucuses and was a witness to the so
called "Dean scream."
"We didn't hear it as a scream,"
Keville says."He wasn't angry. He
was enthusiastic, responding to the
crowd."
As a delegate for two Democrat
ic presidential candidates, George
McGovern and Bill Bradley, Keville
knows how the DNC works and how
it has evolved.
"I was the 'K' in 'Stop Dike
Bombing"' Keville says, reminiscing
on how protesting was once allowed
on the DNC floor during the Viet
nam War era. She says that now the
Democratic Party has much more
stringent rules.
Despite the changes, Keville says
she has applied to be a delegate for
Dean — whether she actually will be

one depends on whether he receives
enough votes in her district.
She says Mass for Dean is plan
ning a rally to muster up support and
to educate people on why it is im
portant to make sure Dean's issues
are heard.
"The primary is the most impor
tant part of the process," she says.
"Everybody I've talked to, except
|for] one person, is sticking with
Dean. Whether or not they'll go out
and vote I don't know."
While education is the main goal
of Mass for Dean's new plan of ac
tion, they have little choice since do
nations have plummeted, Keville
says.
"We don't have any money," she
says. Mass for Dean's limited budget
aside, Keville says that supporters
are putting an advertisement in the
Boston Metro by pooling personal
contributions.
Johnson explains how Dean's
campaign unraveled, saying that
Dean "called out" three major insti
tutions and that his campaign was
not strong enough to handle the af
termath.
Dean directly threatened Bush
and the Republican Party, con
demned the media and demanded
that the Democratic Party stop tak
ing the easy road and stand up for
core values it seemed to have lost,
Johnson says.
"In theory, things could have
been done better," Johnson says."I
don't really have any recriminations.
The big thing is that I think time will
show how remarkably successful
Dean's campaign was."
