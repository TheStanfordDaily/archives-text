# Northwestern students protest for higher wages for Taco Bell employees
## 
### JACQUELINE CHMIELNICKI DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. â€” At 4 a.m. Fri
day, six Northwestern University students awoke,
piled into cars and drove six hours to Louisville,
Ky., where they marched 8 miles through the
town, chanting alongside Florida farm workers.
Holding signs emblazoned with "One penny
more" and "Taco Bell profits come from farm
worker exploitation," these students, members of
NU's Students for Economic Justice, joined the
Coalition of Immokalee Workers in protesting
the low wages the workers receive from Taco
Bell-contracted farm owners.
"It was great to see a lot of the farm workers
themselves fighting for their own livelihoods,"
said Britt Gordon-McKeon, a senior who helped
organize the trip. "They were able to see commu
nity organizations like us who make all of this ef
fort to be marching side by side with them."
The workers, who pick the tomatoes Taco Bell
uses for its food products and are paid per bucket
picked, receive the same wages as they did in the
19705. Currently the workers have to pick two
tons of tomatoes in a single day to get $50.
The march culminated at the headquarters of
Yum! Brands, a conglomeration of restaurant
chains, including Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza
Hut and Taco Bell.
Yum! Brands could not be reached for comment.
According to Gordon-McKeon, if Taco Bell's
farm owners paid the workers one cent more per
pound, the workers' wages would double. Howev
er, Gordon-McKeon, said the fast-food chain
doesn't think this is its responsibility because it
doesn't directly pay the workers. Thus Taco Bell
hasn't responded to requests.

"Taco Bell just refuses to admit the role they
play in affecting prices." she said. "A tiny price
difference, which would practically be no cost for
them, would make a tremendous difference in the
life of a tomato worker. But what is important to
them is getting tomatoes as cheap as possible and
not basic humane, decent wages."
Because protesters did not expect a response
from Taco Bell or Yum! Brands, the protest main
ly served to make the general public aware of the
conditions and to encourage a boycott of the fast
food restaurant. The Immokalee Coalition,
named fora farm town in Florida, called for the
boycott nearly two years ago, hoping Taco Bell
might respond if profits decrease.
"The march was less directly about getting a
response from (Taco Bell) and more to do with
getting Americans in general to associate the idea
that a place like Taco Bell exploits workers,"
Gordon-McKeon said. "When people make this
association, that's when Taco Bell will be really
scared and will change things. We wanted to raise
publicity about what is going on so people can put
pressure on Taco Bell."
The protesting NU students said they wanted
to support the workers and said they found the
protest a success because they "reached a lot of
people," Gordon-McKeon said.
"It was a really good trip to go on," said Kyle
Schafer, a McCormick freshman. "What was im
portant to me was that the workers saw that there
are people behind them who are helping them
fight. They see that they are not alone."
Gordon-McKeon agreed.
"I am definitely glad 1 went," she said. "We
sacrificed some sleep, but we got a chance to
stand up for what we believe in, and that's what
it's all about."
