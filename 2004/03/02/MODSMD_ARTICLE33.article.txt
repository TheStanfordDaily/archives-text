# Budget cuts force Cal students to defer enrollment

### KIM-MAI CUTLER DAILY CALIFORNIAN 
(U-WIRE) BERKELEY, Calif. — Breaking
with a four-decade tradition, the University of Cali
fornia system will divert 3,200 potential freshmen to
community colleges this month under Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger's proposed budget cuts.
The students, who would have been admitted to a
UC campus this year, may instead attend a commu
nity college for their first two years, free of charge.
They are later guaranteed admission to a UC school
during their junior year if they complete the re
quired coursework.
Totalling 10 percent of last year's freshman class,

each campus will turn away about 200 to 425 stu
dents. UC Berkeley administrators are estimating
that 300 potential freshmen will enroll under the
community college plan.
In rosier economic times, UC officials had origi
nally planned to enroll 5,000 more freshmen this
year to accommodate California's burgeoning popu
lation.
"I deeply regret that we have to curtail enroll
ment in a time when the number of eligible students
in the state is increasing," said Richard Black, UC
Berkeley assistant vice chancellor for admissions
and enrollment.
Local high school students are awaiting word
from several UC campuses as acceptance and rejec-

tion letters begin rolling in this week. Some fear the
plan may affect their chances of getting into their
UC school of choice.
"I'm sort of a middle-range candidate," said
Berkeley High School senior Peter True, who ap
plied to several UC campuses, including UC Berke
ley. "I think the caliber of UC I get into is going to be
affected by this."
The move could break 43 years of tradition out
lined in the 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education.
Under the guidelines, UC promised the top 12.5 per
cent of California high school seniors"a spot at one of
its nine undergraduate campuses, even if it was not
their university of choice.
Administrators fear the move could erode that

guarantee of accessibility under the Master Plan.
But policy analysts in the Legislative Analyst's
Office, a research arm of the state Legislature, re
ported last month that with slight adjustments in
admissions policy, UC can continue following the
plan.
Both groups are awaiting a study in May from the
California Postsecondary Education Commission
that will determine whether UC is living up to the
12.5 percent target.
"We know that students work very hard to be
able to come to the University of California," said
UC spokesperson Lavonne Luquis. "It is very dis
tressing that we may not be able to take all of them
this year."
