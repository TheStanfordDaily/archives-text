## 
### BRIAN TSAO CORNELL DAILY SUN 
(U-WIRE) ITHACA. NY. — Although her visit was
planned less than 24 hours in advance, Cornell University
students and community members packed the Straight's
Music Room to hear Vanessa Kerry, the youngest daugh
ter of democratic presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry,
speak on behalf of her father. Her visit comes right before
Super Tuesday when voters from ten states, including New
York, will award 1,151 pledged convention delegates in the
Democratic presidential nomination.
Vanessa Kerry's last-minute meeting was organized to
present her father's platform to the high density of voters in
Ithaca, according to senior Matt Gewolb. president of the
Cornell Students for Kerry. Gewolb said his organization
has been in ongoing contact with the senator's New York
campaign office.
Vanessa Kerry, a third-year medical school student,
spoke about a variety issues, but focused intently on en
couraging audience members to come out and "make vot
ingsexy again." Although her father is considered by many
to lie the front-runner in the democratic primary, Vanessa
Kerry is not counting her chickens just yet.
"I've heard a lot of people saying your dad's got it,"
Vanessa Kerry said. "We can't think that way; we can't
take anything for granted."
In addressing issues surrounding the presidential de
bate, the Yale University graduate took aim at President
George W. Bush's foreign policy, saying that he has ostra
cized the U.S. from the rest of the world. Taking the U.S.'s
current relations with the United Nations and the war on
Iraq as examples, she emphasized that there needs to be
much rebuilding of America's image.
"If you think of our foreign policy [recently], Vanessa
we've thrown out 40 years of diplomacy in one swoop,"
Kerry said. "We're not doing very much to make friends
abroad. In fact, we're creating a lot of anger."
Although John Kerry opposes Bush's alleged antago
nist foreign policy, she also addressed one of the main is
sues of contention concerning her father's record — the
Massachusetts senator's vote for the Iraqi war resolution.
Vanessa Kerry said that at the time, her father trusted
that the president would keep to his word in "exhaust(ing)

all of his resources" before going to war. The senator also
spoke to officials in the United Nations and submitted a
plan concerning Iraq, which would take necessary steps
while preventing war at the same time.
While her father was "shocked" when the United States
militarily intervened in Iraq, Vanessa Kerry said that the
connections the Senator made with members of the inter
national community and the United Nations will provide
him with a solid advantage if he becomes president.
"I think he would enter the U.N. with legitimacy al
ready," Vanessa Kerry said. "The ability to do that is in
credibly important."
Throughout her talk, Vanessa Kerry touched upon a
variety of issues including her father's National service
plan, his 20-20 initiative which would enforce the use of re
newable energy resources by the year 2020 and a proposed
health care reform which would make expand services and
decrease the cost of aid for Americans.
"We treat health care as a privilege and not a right in this
country," Vanessa Kerry said.
In addressing questions from audience members, she
dispelled concerns surrounding the lack of support from
moderate and independent groups for her father, saying
that his values and ideals have already appealed to some
groups and will attract more as the election proceeds.
Vanessa Kerry also addressed Ralph Nader, the former
Green Party candidate who announced his intention to run
for president as an independent last week.
Nader was accused by many groups of stealing costly
votes from then-Democratic presidential candidate, A1
Gore, in the 2000 election. However, Vanesssa Kerry
thinks that because of her fathers strengths and a strong
popular dislike for Bush, Nader will not be a factor in the
next election.
"I think the Democratic Party will unite very strongly
around their Democratic nominee," Vanessa Kerry said.
"I really feel there is so much frustration with this presi
dent."
The 26-year-old Vanessa Kerry, who has taken the past
few months tocampaign around the nation on behalf of her
father, said that although the senator instilled values such
as persistence and courage, she also considered him a
"goofball," who enjoys to joke around — a plus consider
ing the seriousness of his job.

Massachusetts senator's vote for the Iraqi war resolution.
Vanessa Kerry said that at the time, her father trusted
that the president would keep to his word in "exhaust(ing)

all of his resources" before going to war. The senator also
spoke to officials in the United Nations and submitted a
plan concerning Iraq, which would take necessary steps
while preventing war at the same time.
While her father was "shocked" when the United States
militarily intervened in Iraq, Vanessa Kerry said that the
connections the Senator made with members of the inter
national community and the United Nations will provide
him with a solid advantage if he becomes president.
"I think he would enter the U.N. with legitimacy al
ready," Vanessa Kerry said. "The ability to do that is in
credibly important."
Throughout her talk, Vanessa Kerry touched upon a
variety of issues including her father's National service
plan, his 20-20 initiative which would enforce the use of re
newable energy resources by the year 2020 and a proposed
health care reform which would make expand services and
decrease the cost of aid for Americans.
"We treat health care as a privilege and not a right in this
country," Vanessa Kerry said.
In addressing questions from audience members, she
dispelled concerns surrounding the lack of support from
moderate and independent groups for her father, saying
that his values and ideals have already appealed to some
groups and will attract more as the election proceeds.
Vanessa Kerry also addressed Ralph Nader, the former
Green Party candidate who announced his intention to run
for president as an independent last week.
Nader was accused by many groups of stealing costly
votes from then-Democratic presidential candidate, A1
Gore, in the 2000 election. However, Vanesssa Kerry
thinks that because of her fathers strengths and a strong
popular dislike for Bush, Nader will not be a factor in the
next election.
"I think the Democratic Party will unite very strongly
around their Democratic nominee," Vanessa Kerry said.
"I really feel there is so much frustration with this presi
dent."
The 26-year-old Vanessa Kerry, who has taken the past
few months tocampaign around the nation on behalf of her
father, said that although the senator instilled values such
as persistence and courage, she also considered him a
"goofball," who enjoys to joke around — a plus consider
ing the seriousness of his job.
