# Stanford collaborates with Jordan and Israel on desert research

Sciences Prof. Marcus Feldman, who
chairs the Stanford committee that ap
proved the project.
"The other goal is to generate sci
entific collaboration between Israeli
and Jordanian scholars who work on
those problems," Feldman added. "It
has that property of being science and
academics in the service of peace."
The project began four years ago,
before the escalation of hostilities in
the region, as a collaboration between
the Bridging the Rift Foundation and
Cornell. Feldman soon signed on to
offer Stanford's expertise in biology,
and he, along with Ron Elber of Cor
nell, have been developing and push
ing the program ever since.
The center was slated to open earlier,
but the violence in the Middle East halt
ed the effort. On March 9, construction
will finally begin with joint ceremonies in
Jerusalem and Amman and a ceremony
at the site attended by Cornell President
Jeffrey Lehman and Stanford's Vice
Provost Arthur Bienenstock, dean of re
search and graduate policy.

A new initiative aimed at securing
peace in the Middle East and catalogu
ing life in the desert will break ground
on March 9 on the border of Israel and
Jordan. The Bridging the Rift Founda
tion isfundingthe Library of Life, a col
laboration between Cornell and Stan
ford that will create a massive database
of all life in the Dead Sea region.
The project's founders charac
terized it as a scientific endeavor
with political goals and said they
hope to eventually host as many as
1,000 scientists at the facility. This
collaboration between Jordanian
and Israeli doctoral candidates is
one of the most advanced research
endeavors in the region.
"The scientific goals are to under
stand the biology of organisms that
live in some of the most stressful envi
ronments on the planet — extremely
high salinity and extremely high temp
with very little water," said Biological

Violence is still a concern for the
center, but researchers see the goals as
important in overcoming the current
political impasse.
"The decision had been made, at the
instruction of the committee, that the
development of this science center
could go ahead, even if in the rest of the
political spectrum little progress was
made," Feldman said. "If scientists of
good will could convince administra
tors and politicians that this was impor
tant then this could go forward."
"If you just wait for it to be calm,
then it would just never happen," said
Elber, a professor of computer science
at Cornell.
The 150-acre site — at a location
known as central Arava on the Israeli
side and Wadi Araba on the Jordan
ian side — was chosen for its scientif
ic as well as political significance. The
desert has fewer organisms than
many other climates, according to
Feldman, as he noted that the pro-
