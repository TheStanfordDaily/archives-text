# Kerry seizes Super Tuesday
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a decisive victory in yester
day's Super Tuesday primaries, four
term Massachusetts Senator John
Kerry has effectively claimed the De
mocratic presidential nomination for
the 2004 general election.
During the busiest day in the pri
mary process, elections took place in
California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New
York, Ohio, Rhode Island and Ver
mont, while Minnesota had a caucus.
In total, the 10 states represented
1,151 of the 2,162 delegates needed
to win the nomination. As of press
time, Kerry had won 9 of 10 contests.
His only defeat, Vermont, was to for
mer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean,
who had withdrawn from the race on
Feb. 18.
Kerry came into Tuesday's contest
with 771 delegates wrapped up, 500
more than his rival, North Carolina
Senator John Edwards. Before polling
closed in California, it was announced
that Edwards planned to drop out,
leaving Kerry as the overwhelming fa-

vorite to win the primary. The two
other remaining candidates, A1 Sharp
ton and Dennis Kucinich, are consid
ered non-factors because of how few
delegates they each have garnered.
Yesterday's dominating perfor
mance was another example of
Kerry's increasing momentum,
which first began to build after his
victory at the lowa caucus. With
good poll numbers and the nomina
tion within his grasp, Kerry has al
ready begun to look toward his battle
with President George W. Bush in
the 20()4 general election.
"It's good in the sense that it brings
Democrats behind one person," said
junior Dylan Mefford, the president of
the Stanford Democrats. "It should
enable Kerry to sharpen his message
and to prepare to beat Bush."
However, not all students thought
that Kerry's easy victory would bene
fit the Democratic Party.
"It's a little disappointing that it
was determined so soon," said Stan
ford Progressive President Michael
Zakaras, a senior. "I think the more
that we get debates, the more that we
get discussion, the better for the De
mocratic Party, in terms of media cov
erage. When you have two or more
candidates with discussion and dia
logue, you get more attention for the
Democratic Party in the whole, which
is better for us."
Hunter Hargraves, who coordinat
ed Stanford's Get Out the Vote drive
in 2002, expressed his disappointment
with the early announcement of Ed
wards' intent to withdraw.
"I think that it's really hard to be
lieve in a primary system that is fair
and truly representative of the wishes
of voters when by the time the largest
state in the nation casts its ballot,
there's only one candidate remain
ing," he said.
Hargraves commented that he was
disappointed by the fact that states
such as lowa and New Hampshire,

which "aren't representative of the
United States as a whole" impacted
the primary much more than states
such as California simply because their
contests were held earlier.
Zakaras made a similar observa
tion, stating, "I think what [the elec
tion] shows how important momen
tum is in these primaries, and how
much it's frontloaded. Kerry has just
ridden this wave of being the front
runner since winning lowa."
While Kerry's victory frees him up
to focus on the general election, it also
makes him the clear target now that
other Democratic candidates are no
longer serious contenders.
"It gives Bush an individual to focus
on, to take Kerry on more strongly,"
Zakaras said. "Bush has bought mil
lions in advertising, and more attention
will be put on Kerry versus Bush.
Kerry will have to respond."
Along with the presidential prima
ry, voters in California also turned out
to vote on a number of state elections
and propositions. The following are
the returns, as of press time, of the
contests that most directly concern
Stanford.
In the Democratic state Senate pri
mary for the local 21st District, Joe
Simitian led Ted Lempert with 54.6
percent to Lempert's 45.4.
In the local Democratic state as
sembly primary, attorney John Car
cione led with 40.1 percent of the vote.
Ira Ruskin trailed by approximately
six percent.
For the U.S. Senate Republican
primary. Bill Jones led overwhelm
ingly with more than 50 percent of
the vote.
With 41.3 percent of all precincts
reporting. Propositions 55, 57 and 58
were all passing, though the returns for
the Education Bond were extremely
narrow. The State Budget proposi
tion, also known as Proposition 56,
was failing with more than 60 percent
of the votes against it.

the Stanford Democrats. "It should
enable Kerry to sharpen his message
and to prepare to beat Bush."
However, not all students thought
that Kerry's easy victory would bene
fit the Democratic Party.
"It's a little disappointing that it
was determined so soon," said Stan
ford Progressive President Michael
Zakaras, a senior. "I think the more
that we get debates, the more that we
get discussion, the better for the De
mocratic Party, in terms of media cov
erage. When you have two or more
candidates with discussion and dia
logue, you get more attention for the
Democratic Party in the whole, which
is better for us."
Hunter Hargraves, who coordinat
ed Stanford's Get Out the Vote drive
in 2002, expressed his disappointment
with the early announcement of Ed
wards' intent to withdraw.
"I think that it's really hard to be
lieve in a primary system that is fair
and truly representative of the wishes
of voters when by the time the largest
state in the nation casts its ballot,
there's only one candidate remain
ing," he said.
Hargraves commented that he was
disappointed by the fact that states
such as lowa and New Hampshire,

which "aren't representative of the
United States as a whole" impacted
the primary much more than states
such as California simply because their
contests were held earlier.
Zakaras made a similar observa
tion, stating, "I think what [the elec
tion] shows how important momen
tum is in these primaries, and how
much it's frontloaded. Kerry has just
ridden this wave of being the front
runner since winning lowa."
While Kerry's victory frees him up
to focus on the general election, it also
makes him the clear target now that
other Democratic candidates are no
longer serious contenders.
"It gives Bush an individual to focus
on, to take Kerry on more strongly,"
Zakaras said. "Bush has bought mil
lions in advertising, and more attention
will be put on Kerry versus Bush.
Kerry will have to respond."
Along with the presidential prima
ry, voters in California also turned out
to vote on a number of state elections
and propositions. The following are
the returns, as of press time, of the
contests that most directly concern
Stanford.
In the Democratic state Senate pri
mary for the local 21st District, Joe
Simitian led Ted Lempert with 54.6
percent to Lempert's 45.4.
In the local Democratic state as
sembly primary, attorney John Car
cione led with 40.1 percent of the vote.
Ira Ruskin trailed by approximately
six percent.
For the U.S. Senate Republican
primary. Bill Jones led overwhelm
ingly with more than 50 percent of
the vote.
With 41.3 percent of all precincts
reporting. Propositions 55, 57 and 58
were all passing, though the returns for
the Education Bond were extremely
narrow. The State Budget proposi
tion, also known as Proposition 56,
was failing with more than 60 percent
of the votes against it.

With a decisive victory in yester
day's Super Tuesday primaries, four
term Massachusetts Senator John
Kerry has effectively claimed the De
mocratic presidential nomination for
the 2004 general election.
During the busiest day in the pri
mary process, elections took place in
California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New
York, Ohio, Rhode Island and Ver
mont, while Minnesota had a caucus.
In total, the 10 states represented
1,151 of the 2,162 delegates needed
to win the nomination. As of press
time, Kerry had won 9 of 10 contests.
His only defeat, Vermont, was to for
mer Vermont Gov. Howard Dean,
who had withdrawn from the race on
Feb. 18.
Kerry came into Tuesday's contest
with 771 delegates wrapped up, 500
more than his rival, North Carolina
Senator John Edwards. Before polling
closed in California, it was announced
that Edwards planned to drop out,
leaving Kerry as the overwhelming fa-

vorite to win the primary. The two
other remaining candidates, A1 Sharp
ton and Dennis Kucinich, are consid
ered non-factors because of how few
delegates they each have garnered.
Yesterday's dominating perfor
mance was another example of
Kerry's increasing momentum,
which first began to build after his
victory at the lowa caucus. With
good poll numbers and the nomina
tion within his grasp, Kerry has al
ready begun to look toward his battle
with President George W. Bush in
the 20()4 general election.
"It's good in the sense that it brings
Democrats behind one person," said
junior Dylan Mefford, the president of
the Stanford Democrats. "It should
enable Kerry to sharpen his message
and to prepare to beat Bush."
However, not all students thought
that Kerry's easy victory would bene
