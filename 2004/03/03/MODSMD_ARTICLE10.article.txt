# Class Shopper
## The 						real question is: EDGE of what? 
### 
Since I visited a humanities class last time (and yes I-
Hum does count) I thought I would visit an engi
neering class this time around. OK, so not really. See,
I visited that engineering class — I mean the one for
athletes and Pi Phis, in which A is for Attendance and the
only engineering class with "Ethics" in its title — EDGE.
(And no, the other "E" isn't for engineering, either; the full
title is "Ethics of Development in a Global Environment."
Although for all anyone cares it could have been "Even
DODO Gets Engineering" or something like that.)
So anyway, I was really excited about visiting EDGE be
cause I had thought I wouldn't be able to this quarter. You
see, one of my classes has a lab component scheduled at the
same time. (It's actually a mechanical engineering class,

which is ironic, don't you think?) But ap
parently my lab only meets for the first
half of the quarter, so I ended up being
able make EDGE, after all. At any rate, as
a result of my excitement you get an ex
ceptionally well-chronicled account of my
EDGE experience.
7:30 p.m.: I show up to the Psychology
basement (and yeah, it's also the only en
gineering class taught in the Psych build
ing) and find thirteen kids sitting quietly in
the 200-some-person auditorium. 1 settle

in. On the stage the projection screen is pulled down, and fo
cused onto it is the title page of a Powerpoint presentation:
"Reconstruction of Post-Conflict Countries & Japan's As
sistance (A Case of Mindanao)." Great.
7:45 p.m.: Class begins. (New head count: 30 people.) A
benevolent-looking man, the instructor, I guess, walks up to
the stage and makes an announcement: Papers are due Fri
day of Dead Week. Be sure to hand in your paper on time,
so it can get published in the EDGE journal. (I giggle.) He
introduces the visiting speaker as Mr. Hiroto Arakawa, and
a compact Japanese man purposefully approaches the stage.
He starts talking.
The cloying smell of perfume however, distracts my at
tention. 1 look around, and discover two faddishly-dressed
girls down the row. backs hunched over, simultaneously and
furiously applying lip balm. 1 watch them idly until I catch
their attention. I guiltily avert my glance.
8 p.m.: (Head count: 60.) The perfume is really starting to
bother me. Meanwhile, some guy walks in and sits down in
the seat in front of me, pulls out a paperback and starts read
ing it. Backwards. Intrigued, I angle around in my seat to see
what he's reading: The page heading says: DICK COUCH
[sic]. To my disappointment however, this isn't the title —
it's the author. (The title is on the opposite page. THE
WARRIOR ELITE.)
After briefly scanning the page he's on, (it reads, "You
ready to quit?" "Yes, Instructor Mrok"), I look up at the
stage: On the projection screen is something about the
"Moro Islamic Liberation Front" and the guy keeps talking
about MILF this, MILF that. Hehe.
8:15 p.m.: (Head count: 107, with almost everyone
jammed into the back right corner of the room.) The per
fume has subsided; the lecturer is no longer talking about
MILF (the screen now reads, "Shift to Rice (Corn to
Rice)"), and the guy in front of me is now at least reading
the book forwards (at 8 p.m. he was on page 75: now he's on
page 79, which reads: "HOOYAH, CHIEF YAYLOR!"
[sic]). And with that, I leave.
Originally I had planned to find out how many people
were in the class, but the flow of people entering never
slowed, and I'm just not that patient, man. Because really,
the class was that bad. And I'm not even saying that to pick
on EDGE; the lecturer was inane, the slides were incom
prehensible and the subject was incorrigibly boring — and
dude, this is coming from me, a big nerd. I can't even imag
ine what it must be like for the non-nerdy people actually
enrolled in it.
True, maybe the actual instructor is a lot better; maybe
the class really isn't as empty of content as this column.
But all's mama knows is that it was unambiguously the
worst class she has ever been subjected to and that she will
never, ever, take EDGE, no matter how desperate her
GPA gets. (Ever.)

enrolled in it.
True, maybe the actual instructor is a lot better; maybe
the class really isn't as empty of content as this column.

never, ever, take EDGE, no matter how desperate her
GPA gets. (Ever.)

Since I visited a humanities class last time (and yes I-
Hum does count) I thought I would visit an engi
neering class this time around. OK, so not really. See,
I visited that engineering class — I mean the one for
athletes and Pi Phis, in which A is for Attendance and the
only engineering class with "Ethics" in its title — EDGE.
(And no, the other "E" isn't for engineering, either; the full
title is "Ethics of Development in a Global Environment."
Although for all anyone cares it could have been "Even
DODO Gets Engineering" or something like that.)
So anyway, I was really excited about visiting EDGE be
cause I had thought I wouldn't be able to this quarter. You
see, one of my classes has a lab component scheduled at the
same time. (It's actually a mechanical engineering class,

which is ironic, don't you think?) But ap
parently my lab only meets for the first
half of the quarter, so I ended up being
able make EDGE, after all. At any rate, as
a result of my excitement you get an ex
ceptionally well-chronicled account of my
EDGE experience.
7:30 p.m.: I show up to the Psychology
basement (and yeah, it's also the only en
gineering class taught in the Psych build
ing) and find thirteen kids sitting quietly in
the 200-some-person auditorium. 1 settle

in. On the stage the projection screen is pulled down, and fo
cused onto it is the title page of a Powerpoint presentation:
"Reconstruction of Post-Conflict Countries & Japan's As
sistance (A Case of Mindanao)." Great.
7:45 p.m.: Class begins. (New head count: 30 people.) A
benevolent-looking man, the instructor, I guess, walks up to
the stage and makes an announcement: Papers are due Fri
day of Dead Week. Be sure to hand in your paper on time,
so it can get published in the EDGE journal. (I giggle.) He
introduces the visiting speaker as Mr. Hiroto Arakawa, and
a compact Japanese man purposefully approaches the stage.
He starts talking.
The cloying smell of perfume however, distracts my at
tention. 1 look around, and discover two faddishly-dressed
girls down the row. backs hunched over, simultaneously and
furiously applying lip balm. 1 watch them idly until I catch
their attention. I guiltily avert my glance.
8 p.m.: (Head count: 60.) The perfume is really starting to
bother me. Meanwhile, some guy walks in and sits down in
the seat in front of me, pulls out a paperback and starts read
ing it. Backwards. Intrigued, I angle around in my seat to see
what he's reading: The page heading says: DICK COUCH
[sic]. To my disappointment however, this isn't the title —
it's the author. (The title is on the opposite page. THE
WARRIOR ELITE.)
After briefly scanning the page he's on, (it reads, "You
ready to quit?" "Yes, Instructor Mrok"), I look up at the
stage: On the projection screen is something about the
"Moro Islamic Liberation Front" and the guy keeps talking
about MILF this, MILF that. Hehe.
8:15 p.m.: (Head count: 107, with almost everyone
jammed into the back right corner of the room.) The per
fume has subsided; the lecturer is no longer talking about
MILF (the screen now reads, "Shift to Rice (Corn to
Rice)"), and the guy in front of me is now at least reading
the book forwards (at 8 p.m. he was on page 75: now he's on
page 79, which reads: "HOOYAH, CHIEF YAYLOR!"
[sic]). And with that, I leave.
