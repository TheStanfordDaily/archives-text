# Eat, Drink and be Merry
## Battle of the Tastebuds 
### 
I am not sure if you knew this fact or not, but a food
writer is not infallible. Unfortunately I cannot look
into a crystal ball of tempura shrimp and tell you
that Fuki Sushi is the best restaurant in town 100
percent of the time (even though it comes pretty darn
close). If I could puppeteer the waiters
and chefs so that every meal they pre
pared and delivered was impeccable
(like that guy did in Pinnochio, for
those who need visuals), 1 should have
drawn into Mt. Olympus instead of de
bating between Casa Italiana and 680.
But, I have to admit, my confidence
in my taste buds was somewhat tram
pled upon this weekend. When I
clicked to refresh my e-mail, this won
derful testament to free speech ap-

peared. cleverly headed "Eat. drink and be sorry." I
couldn't do justice to it by paraphrasing, so I reprinted it
for you here:
Dear Ms. Jennie,
We came for Parents' weekend to feed our children
and we followed your recommendations.
We went to Straits Cafe and if you are The Stanford
Dailv's food columnist we feel really sorry for all Stan
ford students. Not only is Straits Cafe (rated one in your
column) unprofessionally run (they lost our reservation),
the food is course, unauthentic and extremely unhealthy.

Every dish tasted the same with sweet and sour sauce.
You have never tasted real Singaporean / Asian food, or
to be more precise, real food. What we had was not prop
erly cooked food! The Stanford dorm food by compari
son was many times better.
Sincerely yours,
Stanford Parents
Now, at first, I didn't know if I had been Punk'd and
was going to see Ashton Kutcher suddenly appear in my
computer cluster (which I most likely would not com
plain about). But then I thought that Ashton was prob
ably sitting at the Oscars with Demi, so chances are I
wouldn't be catching a glimpse of his Von Dutch hat that
night. Damn.
I have discovered through this experience that peo
ple are very, very testy when it comes to food. Because
taste is such an intimate sense, there is no way for some
one to believe that a meal was delicious when, to them,
it was apparently worse than Stanford Dining. Harsh
words, my friends.
So I can't claim to prove Straits Cafe's worth with any
statistical data that I compiled from surveying Stanford
students and food experts. I chose it as my number one
pick based on my own personal experiences and on the
effusive words of praise I heard from other students,
which only reinforced my opinion. Just as a point of com
parison to the experience of the nameless Stanford par
ents, here are some testimonials from happy customers

who e-mailed me on their own accord, reassuring me that
I was not crazy in thinking Straits Cafe was good:
* I went this weekend with my mom and while there
was a long wait, that was because it was so popular, be
cause it is SO GOOD! I loved it! Thank you for the great
recommendation!
* FYI... my parents took my brothers and five
friends there Saturday night and said it was A-mazing.
So obviously there is not a be-all-end-all version of
Straits Cafe. I, along with plenty of other students, think
that the Straits Cafe menu is wonderful, varied, delicious,
aromatic and worth coming back to. Apparently these
parents thought it was unhealthy, unauthentic and bland.
As for the unauthentic comment, 1 really have no ex
pertise in what authentic Singaporean food tastes like. I
have, however, received this comment from another
Singaporean student, who told me about a restaurant
that serves genuine Singaporean favorites, called Raf
fles Cafe, located in Fremont. He makes the good point
that the food at Straits Caf6 is "fusionized" and "modi
fied to suit the American palate."
So if you are feeling courageous, break from the mold
and try traditional, home-style Singaporean fare — such
as rice noodles in a spicy coconut milk gravy with
seafood, chicken in curry cooked in the nonya tradition,
fried radish cakes and, for the brave ones, pig's in
testines (apparently a local favorite). I would suggest
trusting a native's recommendation; the Singaporean

student I talked to describes Raffles Cafe "as close to the
real thing as you can get." I haven't had the opportunity
to try it yet, but if you go perhaps I'll see you there.
So the moral of the story: Avoid Straits Cafe if you
are looking fora truly authentic experience. However,
please try this restaurant if you want an eclectic menu
with an interesting fusion of flavors, creating a melodi
ous meal that will leave you singing its praises. Maybe it
won't 100 percent of the time, but it most likely would
score better than I did on my PoliSci midterm.
But what I do know is that I trust my taste buds, and
yes, I know what real food tastes like, contrary to what
some parents might believe. So if you have a bad experi
ence at a restaurant, don't discount it completely. Try it
once again if you have the chance, order something dif
ferent, be willing to change your mind. It's a very attrac
tive and useful quality in a person.
Raffles Cafe is located at 41068 Fremont Ave. in
Fremont. Calif.

yes, I know what real food tastes like, contrary to what
some parents might believe. So if you have a bad experi
ence at a restaurant, don't discount it completely. Try it
once again if you have the chance, order something dif
ferent, be willing to change your mind. It's a very attrac
tive and useful quality in a person.
Raffles Cafe is located at 41068 Fremont Ave. in
Fremont. Calif.

I am not sure if you knew this fact or not, but a food
writer is not infallible. Unfortunately I cannot look
into a crystal ball of tempura shrimp and tell you
that Fuki Sushi is the best restaurant in town 100
percent of the time (even though it comes pretty darn
close). If I could puppeteer the waiters
and chefs so that every meal they pre
pared and delivered was impeccable
(like that guy did in Pinnochio, for
those who need visuals), 1 should have
drawn into Mt. Olympus instead of de
bating between Casa Italiana and 680.
But, I have to admit, my confidence
in my taste buds was somewhat tram
pled upon this weekend. When I
clicked to refresh my e-mail, this won
derful testament to free speech ap-

peared. cleverly headed "Eat. drink and be sorry." I
couldn't do justice to it by paraphrasing, so I reprinted it
for you here:
Dear Ms. Jennie,
We came for Parents' weekend to feed our children
and we followed your recommendations.
We went to Straits Cafe and if you are The Stanford
Dailv's food columnist we feel really sorry for all Stan
ford students. Not only is Straits Cafe (rated one in your
column) unprofessionally run (they lost our reservation),
the food is course, unauthentic and extremely unhealthy.

Every dish tasted the same with sweet and sour sauce.
You have never tasted real Singaporean / Asian food, or
to be more precise, real food. What we had was not prop
erly cooked food! The Stanford dorm food by compari
son was many times better.
Sincerely yours,
Stanford Parents
Now, at first, I didn't know if I had been Punk'd and
was going to see Ashton Kutcher suddenly appear in my
computer cluster (which I most likely would not com
plain about). But then I thought that Ashton was prob
ably sitting at the Oscars with Demi, so chances are I
wouldn't be catching a glimpse of his Von Dutch hat that
night. Damn.
I have discovered through this experience that peo
ple are very, very testy when it comes to food. Because
taste is such an intimate sense, there is no way for some
one to believe that a meal was delicious when, to them,
it was apparently worse than Stanford Dining. Harsh
words, my friends.
So I can't claim to prove Straits Cafe's worth with any
statistical data that I compiled from surveying Stanford
students and food experts. I chose it as my number one
pick based on my own personal experiences and on the
effusive words of praise I heard from other students,
which only reinforced my opinion. Just as a point of com
parison to the experience of the nameless Stanford par
ents, here are some testimonials from happy customers

who e-mailed me on their own accord, reassuring me that
I was not crazy in thinking Straits Cafe was good:
* I went this weekend with my mom and while there
was a long wait, that was because it was so popular, be
cause it is SO GOOD! I loved it! Thank you for the great
recommendation!
* FYI... my parents took my brothers and five
friends there Saturday night and said it was A-mazing.
So obviously there is not a be-all-end-all version of
Straits Cafe. I, along with plenty of other students, think
that the Straits Cafe menu is wonderful, varied, delicious,
aromatic and worth coming back to. Apparently these
parents thought it was unhealthy, unauthentic and bland.
As for the unauthentic comment, 1 really have no ex
pertise in what authentic Singaporean food tastes like. I
have, however, received this comment from another
Singaporean student, who told me about a restaurant
that serves genuine Singaporean favorites, called Raf
fles Cafe, located in Fremont. He makes the good point
that the food at Straits Caf6 is "fusionized" and "modi
fied to suit the American palate."
So if you are feeling courageous, break from the mold
and try traditional, home-style Singaporean fare — such
as rice noodles in a spicy coconut milk gravy with
seafood, chicken in curry cooked in the nonya tradition,
fried radish cakes and, for the brave ones, pig's in
testines (apparently a local favorite). I would suggest
trusting a native's recommendation; the Singaporean

student I talked to describes Raffles Cafe "as close to the
real thing as you can get." I haven't had the opportunity
to try it yet, but if you go perhaps I'll see you there.
So the moral of the story: Avoid Straits Cafe if you
are looking fora truly authentic experience. However,
please try this restaurant if you want an eclectic menu
with an interesting fusion of flavors, creating a melodi
ous meal that will leave you singing its praises. Maybe it
won't 100 percent of the time, but it most likely would
score better than I did on my PoliSci midterm.
But what I do know is that I trust my taste buds, and
