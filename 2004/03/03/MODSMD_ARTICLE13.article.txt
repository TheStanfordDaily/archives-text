# Students offer parents fun events

### 
Parents' Weekend 2004 drew the largest num
bers of parents in the event's history. Al
though this increasingly popular campus
event was expanded this year to include
more University-sponsored events and activities for
upperclassmen's parents, what truly seemed to make
it special were the increased number of events that
were student-sponsored. Although the events orga
nized by the University give parents an invaluable
glimpse into their children's academic lives, events
that are student-initiated and -sponsored offer per
haps the best glimpse into students' social and extra
curricular lives.
The Hip-Hopera, a Black Liberation Month
event held last Friday and Saturday, was one such ex
ample. This theatrical event incorporated hip-hop
into drama, music and dance to create a single per
formance about different generations of a family of
black women in America from times of slavery to
contemporary Harlem, New York. The organizers
and participants of this event should be applauded
for the hard work and effort they put into creating a

wonderful production. Their foresight in scheduling
this event during Parents' Weekend should not be
missed. Parents thus had the opportunity to see a
premier example of a completely student-organized
event and caught a good show at the same time.
Other student-organized events that drew large
crowds of parents included the annual Black Student
Union Soul Food Dinner and two Zoot Suit programs
— a dramatic performance and a party — that were
part of a week-long series organized by Casa Zapata,
the Chicano theme house. "Zoot Suit" was presented
on Friday and a Saturday-night party were the two
particular events overlapping with Parents' Weekend.
All these events were well-organized and offered
something for people with varying interests. The
Stanford community was enriched by these pro
grams and Parents' Weekend coordinators should
consider ensuring similar opportunities for parents
in upcoming years. The energy and passion of stu
dents truly comes across in such programs and
events, and they should be encouraged as an essen
tial aspect of Parents' Weekend.
