community through an impressive series of
events that celebrated Mexican-American
identity and culture and at the same time cast histori

such as racial profiling and discrimination by the U.S.
legal system.
Zoot Suit Week — sponsored by MEChA and co
ordinated by the Ethnic Theme Associates of Casa
Zapata — annually provides historical insights into
the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial that brought
attention to the intolerance and injustices faced by
young Mexican Americans during those times. This

role in a case involving Latino discrimination. The
staged reading of "Zoot Suit," directed by sopho
more Amanda Johnson, boasted a larger cast than
ever before and attracted close to 250 audience mem

first time this year. It had previously been held at
Casa Zapata; the new venue indicated organizers'
commitment to attracting a large audience.
