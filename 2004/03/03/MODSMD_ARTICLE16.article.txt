# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## 'The Passion of the Childress' 
### 
Most columnists begin
their first column by in
troducing themselves
to their readers. I chose
not to do so and instead launched
straight into a rant worthy of a
Dean-like scream.
Maybe because over the past
couple of years I had already writ
ten so many sports columns, 1 felt
like I didn't need to introduce my
self to The Daily's constituency. I
thought that whatever elements of
my background were necessary in
order to understand my columns
should be clear enough — basical
ly, my warped mind would speak
for itself.
But I changed my mind. So, be
fore I get to the topic of the week —
Stanford men's basketball — let me
give you the quick 411 on who I am,
in hopes of putting in context some
things that I will touch on all vol
ume long.
I am a senior in SAE, a fraterni
ty loved and respected by all. I am
an international relations major
who dropped his thesis a couple
weeks ago to dedicate all of his time
to reality television and beer pong.
And 1 have already taken an invest
ment banking job for next year, sell
ing out harder than Ben Affleck
since "Good Will Hunting."
I grew up and will soon return to
New York City — meaning that 1
speak loudly, I have no patience and
you'd probably say that I'm arro
gant. I don't think that's the case
though. It's just that if you disagree
with me, there's a 99 percent chance
you're wrong.
I can admit that I have a slight
gambling problem and I'm told that
I drink excessively on occasion, al
though I can't really remember that
happening so often.
I am a sports fanatic — a die
hard Mets, Knicks and Giants fan.
And I hate the Yankees more than
Ted Kennedy hates Dubya. Let me
just say that if I had a gun with one
bullet and Osama bin Laden and
Derek Jeter were standing in front
of me, I'd have to think twice before
pulling the trigger.
Growing up in New York, my
boyhood idols were Darryl Straw
berry, Lawrence Taylor and Mike

Tyson — so it's probably a miracle
that I'm at Stanford and not in jail.
And my top-five list of women I'd

chop off my left
foot to spend a
night with in
clude Penelope
Cruz, Jennifer
Aniston, Katie
Holmes, Britney
Spears and Jessi
ca Alba.
I'm fairly lib
eral politically.

with my views
veering leftward over the last few
years, which definitely has more to
do with Bush taking office than any
Stanford effect. I'm pretty sure of
this since my dislike for tree-hump
ing, tie-dye-wearing protesters has
simultaneously skyrocketed. After
watching enough retarded protests,
nothing would make me happier
than throwing buckets of raw meat
at the next students I see picketing
against labor standards for migrant
workers in some country I've never
heard of.
I think Biggie was better than
Tupac, the invention of Red Bull
and vodka is as important as Eli
Whitney and his cotton gin and
Steven Seagal could kick Jet Li's ass
if he got back in "Under Siege"
shape and didn't come into the fight
looking like he swallowed Gary
Coleman.
I think the three funniest people
on earth are Dave C'happelle, Larry
David and Will Ferrell. and if I ran a
TV station, R Kelly would have to
be on a "Dismissed" episode with
the Olsen twins — while the afore
mentioned Dream Team of Come
dy gave play-by-play.
I've been obsessed with sports
ever since I can remember and while
I played sports throughout high
school, my physical stature (think of
"Rudy" without the heart of a cham
pion) led me to cover sports for The
Daily starting freshman year.
And that leads me now to a brief
discourse on the performance put on
this year by our still undefeated bas
ketball team — or, as I like to call it,
"The Passion of The Childress."
Led by high-flying J.C., Stan
ford's top-ranked men's basketball

team is now 25-0 going into the last
weekend of the regular season.
From start to finish, we have made
our opponents look dumber than
Jessica Simpson, abusing the Pac-10
as if our name were Wacko Jacko.
And clearly the national media has
caught on; the Cardinal receives
more media coverage than the right
breast of Jacko's kid sister.
We've been called the essence of
"team ball" and have become the
darling of college basketball com
mentators across the nation. So, un
less our team spontaneously com
busts, we should be the No. 1 seed in
the West come tournament time. A
national title is so close we can taste it.
Since 1 came to Stanford four
years ago, the Cardinal has won a
bunch of national championships.
But they've all come in random
sports that no one really cares about
other than the team members and
their significant others. Never in
basketball, baseball or football.
Never a title that gets the team on
Sports Center — and. more impor
tantly. never a title that incites a riot.
After every major championship
won in the past ten years (whether it
be college or professional), fans of
the champions have overturned
cars, started bonfires and generally
engaged in drunken destructiveness
on mass levels.
I want this to happen here. No, 1
need this to happen here. My four
years will be incomplete without it. 1
can't graduate without turning a
Jeep upside down in the Quad or
setting half of Mayfield Avenue on
fire. It just wouldn't be right.
Unfortunately, though, it's out
of my hands for now. The team has
11 more games before a banner can
forever rise in the renovated Maples
Pavilion — and. more importantly,
before I can live out my lifelong
dream of rioting after watching my
team win a championship.
Hopefully the season will have a
better ending than the movie from
which I got its nickname. You can
bet I'm praying for it.

Most columnists begin
their first column by in
troducing themselves
to their readers. I chose
not to do so and instead launched
straight into a rant worthy of a
Dean-like scream.
Maybe because over the past
couple of years I had already writ
ten so many sports columns, 1 felt
like I didn't need to introduce my
self to The Daily's constituency. I
thought that whatever elements of
my background were necessary in
order to understand my columns
should be clear enough — basical
ly, my warped mind would speak
for itself.
But I changed my mind. So, be
fore I get to the topic of the week —
Stanford men's basketball — let me
give you the quick 411 on who I am,
in hopes of putting in context some
things that I will touch on all vol
ume long.
I am a senior in SAE, a fraterni
ty loved and respected by all. I am
an international relations major
who dropped his thesis a couple
weeks ago to dedicate all of his time
to reality television and beer pong.
And 1 have already taken an invest
ment banking job for next year, sell
ing out harder than Ben Affleck
since "Good Will Hunting."
I grew up and will soon return to
New York City — meaning that 1
speak loudly, I have no patience and
you'd probably say that I'm arro
gant. I don't think that's the case
though. It's just that if you disagree
with me, there's a 99 percent chance
you're wrong.
I can admit that I have a slight
gambling problem and I'm told that
I drink excessively on occasion, al
though I can't really remember that
happening so often.
I am a sports fanatic — a die
hard Mets, Knicks and Giants fan.
And I hate the Yankees more than
Ted Kennedy hates Dubya. Let me
just say that if I had a gun with one
bullet and Osama bin Laden and
Derek Jeter were standing in front
of me, I'd have to think twice before
pulling the trigger.
Growing up in New York, my
boyhood idols were Darryl Straw
berry, Lawrence Taylor and Mike

Tyson — so it's probably a miracle
that I'm at Stanford and not in jail.
And my top-five list of women I'd

chop off my left
foot to spend a
night with in
clude Penelope
Cruz, Jennifer
Aniston, Katie
Holmes, Britney
Spears and Jessi
ca Alba.
I'm fairly lib
eral politically.

with my views
veering leftward over the last few
years, which definitely has more to
do with Bush taking office than any
Stanford effect. I'm pretty sure of
this since my dislike for tree-hump
ing, tie-dye-wearing protesters has
simultaneously skyrocketed. After
watching enough retarded protests,
nothing would make me happier
than throwing buckets of raw meat
at the next students I see picketing
against labor standards for migrant
workers in some country I've never
heard of.
I think Biggie was better than
Tupac, the invention of Red Bull
and vodka is as important as Eli
Whitney and his cotton gin and
Steven Seagal could kick Jet Li's ass
if he got back in "Under Siege"
shape and didn't come into the fight
looking like he swallowed Gary
Coleman.
I think the three funniest people
on earth are Dave C'happelle, Larry
David and Will Ferrell. and if I ran a
TV station, R Kelly would have to
be on a "Dismissed" episode with
the Olsen twins — while the afore
mentioned Dream Team of Come
dy gave play-by-play.
I've been obsessed with sports
ever since I can remember and while
I played sports throughout high
school, my physical stature (think of
"Rudy" without the heart of a cham
pion) led me to cover sports for The
Daily starting freshman year.
And that leads me now to a brief
discourse on the performance put on
this year by our still undefeated bas
ketball team — or, as I like to call it,
"The Passion of The Childress."
Led by high-flying J.C., Stan
ford's top-ranked men's basketball

team is now 25-0 going into the last
weekend of the regular season.
From start to finish, we have made
our opponents look dumber than
Jessica Simpson, abusing the Pac-10
as if our name were Wacko Jacko.
And clearly the national media has
caught on; the Cardinal receives
more media coverage than the right
breast of Jacko's kid sister.
We've been called the essence of
"team ball" and have become the
darling of college basketball com
mentators across the nation. So, un
less our team spontaneously com
busts, we should be the No. 1 seed in
the West come tournament time. A
national title is so close we can taste it.
Since 1 came to Stanford four
years ago, the Cardinal has won a
bunch of national championships.
But they've all come in random
sports that no one really cares about
other than the team members and
their significant others. Never in
basketball, baseball or football.
Never a title that gets the team on
Sports Center — and. more impor
tantly. never a title that incites a riot.
After every major championship
won in the past ten years (whether it
be college or professional), fans of
the champions have overturned
cars, started bonfires and generally
engaged in drunken destructiveness
on mass levels.
I want this to happen here. No, 1
need this to happen here. My four
years will be incomplete without it. 1
can't graduate without turning a
Jeep upside down in the Quad or
setting half of Mayfield Avenue on
fire. It just wouldn't be right.
Unfortunately, though, it's out
of my hands for now. The team has
11 more games before a banner can
forever rise in the renovated Maples
Pavilion — and. more importantly,
before I can live out my lifelong
dream of rioting after watching my
team win a championship.
Hopefully the season will have a
better ending than the movie from
which I got its nickname. You can
bet I'm praying for it.
