# BLOWING INTO TOWN
## Here's to 'American Idle' 
### 
It's an ugly time in the quarter.
Papers and final projects are
due, the books you haven't
read form a gravity-defying
tower on your desk, your rapidly ex
panding "to-do" list silently shames
you every day. Basically the piper is
looking for his due, people, and if he
has to, he'll pry it from your cold,
dead hands.
Frankly, I'm scared. If you count
the amount of pages I have to write
and turn in before next week, we're
talking three digits. And the blithe
manner in which Leland's cronies
are piling on more work calls to mind
a brilliant philosophy from Nobel
Prize winner Bertrand Russell.
Russell wrote in defense of idle
ness. And he wrote in 1932, during a
period of non-elective idleness we
like to call the Great Depression.
Sure, he's a little outdated in some
of his reasoning and maybe even
wrong on a few points. But his basic
idea is that less is more, and though
the conventional wisdom reads that
diligent labor is a virtue, one look at
the unequal monetary benefits of
globalization (the rich become rich
er, the poor are still scraping by)
confirms Russell's genius. I want to
kiss Russell's cold dead lips for say
ing what I feel: It's bad — really re
ally bad — to work too hard.
Think of it as the philosophical
underpinnings of the Mexican fish
erman modern-day fable that went
around the Internet a few years
back. The story goes that a success
ful businessman vacationed in a
tiny seaside Mexican town and met
a young fisherman with his own
small boat. The fisherman caught
his own fish and cooked it. The
businessman loved the fish so
much, he saw a rich moneymaking
opportunity. He suggested a deal to
the fisherman that he sell his
recipe, oversee a preparation facil

ity and make millions. The fisher
man wanted to know why he should
accept the offer, and when the

money didn't im
press him, the
businessman
promised that
after years of
work, the fisher
man could retire
and get a little
fishing boat in a
small town.
The point, of

course, is that we
work all our lives to get to a place in
life where we can have a little idle
ness, when we could probably have
that right now.
Russell is hip to that jive; in fact
he might have invented the notion.
He said, "If you ask [a worker] what
he thinks is the best part of his life,
he is not likely to say, 'I enjoy man
ual work because it makes me feel
that I am fulfilling man's noblest
task, and because I like to think how
much man can transform his planet.
It is true that my body demands pe
riods of rest, which I have to fill in as
best I may, but I am never so happy
as when the morning comes and 1
can return to the toil from which my
contentment springs.' I have never
heard working men say this sort of
thing. They consider work, as it
should be considered, a necessary
means to a livelihood, and it is from
their leisure that they derive what
ever happiness they may enjoy.
"I hope that, after reading [my
words), the leaders of the YMCA
will start a campaign to induce good
young men to do nothing. If so, I
shall not have lived in vain."
Russell also lobbied fora four
hour workday: "When I suggest that
working hours should be reduced to
four... I mean that four hours'
work a day should entitle a man to

the necessities and elementary com
forts of life, and that the rest of his
time should be his to use as he might
see fit."
Russell's plan would cut out
over-abundance, drive up prices and
wages and equalize the classes. It's a
crazy idea — less work amounting
to more productivity and more
jobs? Our current hyper-drive cul
ture probably won't give Russell's
theory much of a look.
For my purposes, I'm going to
liken Russell's idea of excessive
manual labor to busy work — work
neither virtuous nor necessary.
I hink when a book is assigned when
a chapter would do, or a massive
paper is required when something
shorter would suffice.
My self-serving point here is that
many of us work ourselves too hard,
sacrificing sleep and idle time — the
stuff that keeps us human. I can hear
Russell's words in my ears, asserting
that a packed schedule isn't a badge
of virtue.
The ironic part here, as I'm
drowning in reading, is that I en
rolled in graduate school to land a
good job, hopefully to make a chunk
of change so I one day in the dis
tance I could retire and read all the
books I 've been putting off all these
years. Russell would get a kick out
of that.
I do know I'm living the aca
demic high life now; I'm taking time
off to study at a beautiful campus
with smart people, for crying out
loud. But here at the dregs of the
quarter, I feel the pleas for mercy of
my fellow-students rising up around
me. Help us. they seem to say, keep
America idle.
