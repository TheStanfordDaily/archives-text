## Graduate students should consider serving on GSC 
### STEVEN ALLISON 
Building a community is challenging, especially within
Stanford's diverse graduate population. But there is one or
ganization — the Graduate Student Council (GSC) — ded
icated to serving the interests of the entire graduate commu
nity. I'm calling on you to run for office in this organization.
The GSC has a strong record of success. In the late 19905,
graduate students frustrated by an overpriced housing mar
ket staged protests on the Quad and lobbied the University
and Santa Clara County to fix the problem. The leaders of
this movement founded the GSC to help resolve the housing
crisis and to bring attention to graduate student issues. Their
efforts have already added 834 units — Studios 1 to 6 — of
new graduate housing to campus.
I admit, most students know little about the activities of
the GSC. When pressed to run fora position last year, 1 was
skeptical. I asked a friend and former GSC member if the
GSC really does anything. His response — the GSC had just
negotiated a 50 percent health care subsidy for graduate stu

dents and completed a survey on graduate quality of life with
2,1(X) respondents — convinced me to run .
Shortly after 1 was elected, the GSC attained one of its
greatest advocacy victories — a commitment to build a
graduate community center. Thanks to a donation by alum
nus John Arrillaga, the center is now a reality. The GSC
banner hangs proudly on the wire fence enclosing the
emerging steel skeleton of the $3.8 million building on Es
condido Road. This project symbolizes more than five years
of planning and cooperation by GSC members and the Uni
versity administration.
GSC advt)cacy efforts extend far beyond the community
center. Every year, we lobby the administration for higher
minimum stipends. This year we are also lobbying federal
legislators to lower taxes on stipends. We are on the verge of
replacing the archaic housing lottery with a system that guar
antees stability. Students with children will ultimately bene
fit from our negotiations fora University-supported child
care program. Our recent survey on academic issues gar
nered an unprecedented 32 percent response rate, and you

can bet we'll follow up on those responses to improve aca
demic life at Stanford.
But the GSC is more than just an advocacy group. We
also build community. This year over 1,500 people feasted
on a catered Thanksgiving dinner organized and largely
funded by the GSC. The GSC hosts an annual Fourth of July
barbeque that typically draws 500 people. Each year the
GSC distributes $90,000 for student group activities, includ
ing the recent International Gala, that enrich the graduate
student community.
Members of the GSC influence nearly all parts of the
University. President Hennessy and Provost Etchemendy
regularly meet with GSC members. We control whether
special-fees groups go on the ballot, which sets the size of
graduate students' quarterly ASSU fees. GSC members in
terviewed all of the candidates that applied for the recent
ly filled dean of students position. By running for the GSC,
you can join an organization with proven credibility at
Stanford.
Being on the GSC can also be extremely rewarding. Past

GSC Deputy Chair Lisa Marin said, "I found all kinds of op
portunities to improve the Stanford graduate experience,
plus I got to work with so many bright, motivated people
outside of my department whom I never would have met
otherwise." Council members often find that their service
leads to a great feeling of personal satisfaction.
There is a position for everyone on the GSC. It values
the different talents of all members. Whether you love or
hate the Stanford experience, whether you're soft spoken
or opinionated, you can represent Stanford graduate stu
dents. Come to our information session at 5 p.m. today in
the Tresidder VPS A Conference Room and talk with cur
rent GSC members. Then make your commitment to run at
http://elections.stanford.edu by March 12. The GSC is rely
ing on you to step up and improve the Stanford graduate
experience.
