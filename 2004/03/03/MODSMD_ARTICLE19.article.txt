## Rooting for the Dukies? Madness! 
### 
The recent hurricane on campus has de
clared that March is here, meaning that it's
time for CBS commentators everywhere
to soil themselves in anticipation, for Dick
Vitale to be taken out of the straitjacket he's stored
in for the other 11 months of the year and for Steve
Lavin to superglue his hair into place. Office p<x)ls
are starting up across the nation, only to be won by
receptionists who pick winners based on the attrac
tiveness of their players or the color of their uni
forms. That's right, it's the sports justification of
chaos theory — March Madness.
This is one of my favorite times of the sports
year (the others being playoff baseball and playoff
football, in that order), and not only because it's
very easy to incorporate gambling. February is the
long, dark void where only the NBA and NHL are
filling the sports quota. The NCAA Tournament,
thankfully, provides a welcome break from this lull.
As an aside, this is also the biggest reason that

the Big Dance is sweet: It pro
vides a hoops alternative to the
NBA. The NBA, in short, sucks.
The ever-expanding search for
raw athletes has created a game
without the shooters or passers
that are capable of controlling
the college game. The pros are
populated by thugs who rival
Snoop Dogg in terms of marijua
na consumption, and Dennis
Rodman is contemplating are-

turn to the game. Also, Rasheed Wallace.
The NCAA basketball tournament is every
thing that the NBA will never be: It is equitable and
it at least allows for the possibility that a mid-major
school will prove itself the best in the nation.
Schools like Valparaiso and Kent State go from
being flyover country in the Midwest to inspiring
hundreds of thousands of people. For that One
Shining Moment, David triumphs over Goliath. In
a sports world with few upsets, this is a good thing,
mostly because it usually means seeing Duke lose
in one way or another.
Through this season, attention has been focused
largely on three teams: Duke, Stanford and St.
Joseph's, all of which expect to pull No. 1 seeds en
tering the tournament. However, a quick rundown
for those not acquainted with the Dukies and
Hawks may be necessary.
Duke basketball has become a Final Four fix
ture in the past decade and a half, mostly by domi
nating the Atlantic Coast Conference and produc
ing superteams under the watch of Mike "Polish K"
Krzyzewski. The Blue Devils always seem to have
a glut of great college players who never translate
into NBA superstars (see Shane Battier and Chris
tian Laettner). TV commentators love to go on and
on about Duke's academic prowess in addition to
their athletic skill, as if being called "the Harvard of
the South" wasn't an insult. That's like being the
hottest girl at Cal Tech, or having the largest penis
in Japan.
Ttie Blue Devils are the Yankees of colle
giate basketball. Actually, Duke is worse in that
Yankee fans typically have a solid understand
ing of baseball, while the Cameron Crazies are
usually nerds with no athletic background who
have decided to go watch basketball because it's
the cool thing to do. Plus, it can't hurt their cause
when ESPN.com, along with every other major
sports media source, has had its face glued to the
Devils' collective ass all year.
Also, in case you haven't had this beaten into
your head yet. there are actually two unbeaten
teams in the nation. The sports pages have been
busy slavering over the continued unbeaten
streaks of Stanford and St. Joseph's and how
they'll pan out in the NCAAs. It's insulting to the
Cardinal to be mentioned in the same sentence as
St. Joe's. Sorry to not hop on the Hawks' Cin
derella story, but going 27-0 against Drexel,
Duquesne and St. Bonaventure doesn't prove a
whole lot.
St. Joe's Wooden Award candidate, undersized
guard Jameer Nelson, is just the type of player that
you spend all of March hearing about because of his
"heart," "grit," and "desire," none of which make
him the type of player who will "succeed in the
NBA." But senior point guards win champi
onships, and he'll probably be the reason St.
Joseph's proves it deserves at least a portion of the
respect afforded to its perfect record.
So what does this mean for Stanford? It means
that we're going to get a No. 1 seed in our home re
gion and deal with some pretty big Dance expecta
tions. This means more than a respectable showing
followed by a loss in the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight to
a team we have no business losing to. With the
ridiculous display we've put on all season, anything
less than a trip to San Antonio for the Final Four
will be a disappointment.
The killer instinct Stanford has shown all
winter had better show up in the NCAAs, or
otherwise even a perfect regular season will
end up meaningless. They've consistently
demonstrated the defensive skill and power on
the boards to put down the more athletic ACC
teams that used to pose a problem in the later
rounds, and hopefully that will translate into a
national championship. But that remains to be
seen, and until then all that can be done is to
watch spring training games and hope that
Luol Deng, Andre Iguodala and Emeka
Okafor are all involved in kitchen accidents of
some kind.

Dan McCarthy is a sophomore who is probably
giving Andre lguodala just a little bit too much cred
it. It-mail inbox at dmcc23@stanford.edu if you
think he went too easy on Duke.

Joseph's proves it deserves at least a portion of the
respect afforded to its perfect record.
So what does this mean for Stanford? It means
that we're going to get a No. 1 seed in our home re
gion and deal with some pretty big Dance expecta
tions. This means more than a respectable showing
followed by a loss in the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight to
a team we have no business losing to. With the
ridiculous display we've put on all season, anything
less than a trip to San Antonio for the Final Four
will be a disappointment.
The killer instinct Stanford has shown all
winter had better show up in the NCAAs, or
otherwise even a perfect regular season will
end up meaningless. They've consistently
demonstrated the defensive skill and power on
the boards to put down the more athletic ACC
teams that used to pose a problem in the later
rounds, and hopefully that will translate into a
national championship. But that remains to be
seen, and until then all that can be done is to
watch spring training games and hope that
Luol Deng, Andre Iguodala and Emeka
Okafor are all involved in kitchen accidents of
some kind.

Dan McCarthy is a sophomore who is probably
giving Andre lguodala just a little bit too much cred
it. It-mail inbox at dmcc23@stanford.edu if you
think he went too easy on Duke.

The recent hurricane on campus has de
clared that March is here, meaning that it's
time for CBS commentators everywhere
to soil themselves in anticipation, for Dick
Vitale to be taken out of the straitjacket he's stored
in for the other 11 months of the year and for Steve
Lavin to superglue his hair into place. Office p<x)ls
are starting up across the nation, only to be won by
receptionists who pick winners based on the attrac
tiveness of their players or the color of their uni
forms. That's right, it's the sports justification of
chaos theory — March Madness.
This is one of my favorite times of the sports
year (the others being playoff baseball and playoff
football, in that order), and not only because it's
very easy to incorporate gambling. February is the
long, dark void where only the NBA and NHL are
filling the sports quota. The NCAA Tournament,
thankfully, provides a welcome break from this lull.
As an aside, this is also the biggest reason that

the Big Dance is sweet: It pro
vides a hoops alternative to the
NBA. The NBA, in short, sucks.
The ever-expanding search for
raw athletes has created a game
without the shooters or passers
that are capable of controlling
the college game. The pros are
populated by thugs who rival
Snoop Dogg in terms of marijua
na consumption, and Dennis
Rodman is contemplating are-

turn to the game. Also, Rasheed Wallace.
The NCAA basketball tournament is every
thing that the NBA will never be: It is equitable and
it at least allows for the possibility that a mid-major
school will prove itself the best in the nation.
Schools like Valparaiso and Kent State go from
being flyover country in the Midwest to inspiring
hundreds of thousands of people. For that One
Shining Moment, David triumphs over Goliath. In
a sports world with few upsets, this is a good thing,
mostly because it usually means seeing Duke lose
in one way or another.
Through this season, attention has been focused
largely on three teams: Duke, Stanford and St.
Joseph's, all of which expect to pull No. 1 seeds en
tering the tournament. However, a quick rundown
for those not acquainted with the Dukies and
Hawks may be necessary.
Duke basketball has become a Final Four fix
ture in the past decade and a half, mostly by domi
nating the Atlantic Coast Conference and produc
ing superteams under the watch of Mike "Polish K"
Krzyzewski. The Blue Devils always seem to have
a glut of great college players who never translate
into NBA superstars (see Shane Battier and Chris
tian Laettner). TV commentators love to go on and
on about Duke's academic prowess in addition to
their athletic skill, as if being called "the Harvard of
the South" wasn't an insult. That's like being the
hottest girl at Cal Tech, or having the largest penis
in Japan.
Ttie Blue Devils are the Yankees of colle
giate basketball. Actually, Duke is worse in that
Yankee fans typically have a solid understand
ing of baseball, while the Cameron Crazies are
usually nerds with no athletic background who
have decided to go watch basketball because it's
the cool thing to do. Plus, it can't hurt their cause
when ESPN.com, along with every other major
sports media source, has had its face glued to the
Devils' collective ass all year.
Also, in case you haven't had this beaten into
your head yet. there are actually two unbeaten
teams in the nation. The sports pages have been
busy slavering over the continued unbeaten
streaks of Stanford and St. Joseph's and how
they'll pan out in the NCAAs. It's insulting to the
Cardinal to be mentioned in the same sentence as
St. Joe's. Sorry to not hop on the Hawks' Cin
derella story, but going 27-0 against Drexel,
Duquesne and St. Bonaventure doesn't prove a
whole lot.
St. Joe's Wooden Award candidate, undersized
guard Jameer Nelson, is just the type of player that
you spend all of March hearing about because of his
"heart," "grit," and "desire," none of which make
him the type of player who will "succeed in the
NBA." But senior point guards win champi
onships, and he'll probably be the reason St.
Joseph's proves it deserves at least a portion of the
respect afforded to its perfect record.
