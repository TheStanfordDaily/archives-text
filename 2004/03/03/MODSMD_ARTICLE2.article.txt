### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In its meeting last night, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate rejected a
proposal by the Students for the Great Donation to place a special ref
erendum on the spring quarter ballot allowing student's to add $3 to the
following year's undergraduate ASSU fee.
The proposal also stated that that a student-wide vote would deter
mine the specific aid organization to which the money was contributed.
While members of the Senate expressed their support for the Great
Donation's cause, many questioned its addition to the spring ballot, rais
ing concerns that it bypassed student choice and tied the ASSU too di
rectly to the project.
"There are entire organizations that devote themselves to these de
cisions," said Senator Alyssa Schwartz, a sophomore. "We don't know
whether the money is going where we want it to go."
Schwartz also suggested a "campus-wide service day" as an alter
native to the Great Donation. Several other senators supported her
suggestion of approaching the student body directly for Great Dona
tion support.
Another major concern was that the request would create an un
wanted precedent for other student groups to bypass the special fee
process. ASSU Financial Manger Kyle Alisharan, Class of 2003, ex

pressed concern about dealing with the possible future consequences of
such a decision.
"If we pass it this year, we set a precedent," he said. "We have to be
cognizant of that. I'm concerned about giving to the Great Donation at
the cost of another student group."
Senate Chair Josh Shipp. a junior, echoed Alisharan's sentiments.
"I'm not sure if it's the Senate's place to put this on the ballot,"
he said.
Representatives from Students for the Great Donation acknowl
edged the difficulty, but added that they had special reasons for tying the
donation to the Stanford name.
"The role of the ASSU, as I understand it. is to represent student con
cerns and interests," said senior Patrick Bomhack, who spoke on behalf
of Students for the Great Donation. "I can't think of a better way to ex
press our concern as a student body. We as a student body are saying:
this is what it means to be a Stanford student."
Although representatives from the Great Donation expressed disap
pointment in the Senate's decision, they resolved to continue seeking
other ways to raise money for aid organizations.
The Senate also confirmed he four new members of the Nominations
Commission for 2004-2005: sophomores Chioke Borgelt-Mose, Francis
co Cendejas, Lindsay Love and Katherine Wang. Cendejas was con
firmed as chair of the commission.
