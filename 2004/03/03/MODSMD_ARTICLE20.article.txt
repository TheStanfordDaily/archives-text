Top-ranked Stanford. Washington and Califor
nia solidified their places atop the Pacific-10 Con
ference last weekend by all going 2-0, while UCLA
and Oregon fell into a tie for fifth place after losing
both of their contests.
Meanwhile, No. 22 Arizona (18-8, 10-7
Pac-10) continued its mercurial ways, losing
to Washington on Thursday, 89-84. before
rebounding to beat Washington State, 72-60,
on Saturday.
The Huskies (15-10. 10-6) moved into second
place in the Pac-10 after they beat the Wildcats be
hind Tre Simmons' game-high 22 points off the
bench and another 14 points from fellow reserve
Hakeem Rollins. And it all happened in Tucson,
where Washington had not won since an 80-79
overtime thriller in 19%.
Hassan Adams scored 22 points for Arizona on
8-of-12 shooting, while Channing Frye banged his
way to 25 points and nine boards. But the Wildcats
were outrebounded, 35-31, and got only nine points
from their bench.
Arizona's Saturday win was paced by 21
points by Salim Stoudamire, who returned after
serving a one-game suspension lor insubordina
tion. Frye added 20 points and Andre Iguodala
had 16 rebounds, while the Cougars got 27
points from Thomas Kelati in a truly impressive
one-man effort.
Kelati shot 11-of-13 — and 5-of-7 from down
town — despite the fact that no other Cougar
scored more than six points. And we're not done yet

— Kelati also led his team in rebounds (six), assists
(three) and steals (three).
The Cardinal (25-0, 16-0) rolled over Oregon
State (11-15,5-11) at home on Thurdsay, 73-43, be
fore easily dispatching Oregon (12-11.7-9) on Sat
urday. 76-55. further dampening the Ducks' waning
NCAA Tournament hopes.
The Ducks had lost on Thursday, falling to Cal in
overtime, 85-81. The Golden Bears (13-12, 9-7)
blew a nine-point lead with less than three minutes
remaining in regulation, but two free throws and a
big block of I vUke Jackson by Leon Powe sealed the
deal in overtime.
Powe had 20 points and 11 boards, while
Richard Midgley added a game-high 22 on 7-of-12
shooting. Jackson had 18 points and eight rebounds
to lead Oregon.
The Beavers' own tournament hopes —
Pac-10 Tournament hopes, that is — took a
hit last weekend as well. After their loss to
Stanford, they dropped Saturday's game to
Cal, 75-58, falling to ninth place in the Pac-10
and one game out of the final spot in the Pac
-10 tourney.
Powe came off the bench on Senior Day at
Haas Pavilion for game-highs of 23 points and
10 boards, while Amit Tamir shot 6-of-8 and
was perfect from behind the arc in totaling 17
points. Oregon State got 14 points apiece from
J.S. Nash and David Lucas. Lucas, a probable
all-conference pick, had a tough weekend,
shooting a combined 10-of-29 in the Beavers'
two losses.
