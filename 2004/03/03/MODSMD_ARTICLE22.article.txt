# Gymnasts reach new heights
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's No. 11 men's gymnastics team (3-4,0-3 Pacific
-10 Conference) fell to the No. 4 Oklahoma Sooners at home
this past Saturday, but it's too soon to tell how well the Cardi
nal will fare as the postseason approaches.
The team traditionally peaks very late in the season and this
year looks to he no different. The Cardinal posted its highest
team mark yet for the season, 214.575, but head coach Thorn
Glielmi says the team can improve that score by at least three
points.
"Our backup guys with less difficult skills are hitting solid,
clean routines," Glielmi said. "But we didn't hit all of our big
risk routines and so we didn't count the high scores that we'll
hopefully be seeing at the end of the season."
Senior captain Dan Gill took the risk of attempting a tum
bling pass on the floor exercise, which he had never before
used in competition or even completed successfully in practice.
He did what a burger-lover might call a double-double, animal
style: a double backflip with a double twist, immediately fol
lowed by a front Hip purposefully landed on his stomach for
added difficulty. And he nailed it.
According to Glielmi, Gill is the only man in the world who
has successfully competed that tumbling pass. Gill had a bit too
much power on his other tumbling passes, however, and
stepped out of bounds on two occasions. A step out of bounds
is a 0.1 deduction, leaving Gill with a score of 9.4, good enough
for second place to Oklahoma's Jock Stevens.
Sophomore Sean Doolan also competed some very dif
ficult skills, but took some rough falls on the floor exer
cise, pommel horse and vault. He hit the remainder of his
routines, however, to take second place in the all-around
with a 51.4.
Gill also stepped up the difficulty of his high-bar routine,
doing a triple-twisting, double-layout dismount. He is only one
of about three people in the world and the only man in the coun
try who uses that dismount, but he rolled out of his landing,
which cost him half a point. He also fell on a kovax release move.
"I was really frustrated that I missed my release and dis
mount," Gill said. "1 had been hitting them in practice every
single time, so it's very frustrating."
Junior teammate Nate Downs, however, turned in the best
high bar score of his career with a 9.5 to take third on the event.
"I'm really proud of the team. We're stepping up at every
meet," Gill said. "The guys are starting to realize how much po
tential we've got and that is building our confidence. And for
us, confidence is going to be the key to competing successfully."
The men have the potential to go far in the upcoming post
season, but they will need to hit their high-risk routines in
order to make the most of that potential.
"We're a late-peaking team, and that's what always makes
us fun to watch at NC'A As at the end of the season," Gill said.
"We can really scare some people."
The men may be taking their time to peak, but the No. 5
women's gymnastics team (7-3, 4-2) is charging ahead. After
tying top-ranked UCLA for the highest home score in the na
tion two weekends ago, the lady Cardinal tied the Bruins for
the highest away score in the nation this past weekend.
Sophomore Natalie Foley led the Cardinal to Friday

night's 197.85 to 197.175 win over the No. 16 Oregon State
Beavers. 197.85 ties Stanford's best ever road score and is al
most a point and a half higher than any of the team's away
scores this season.
Foley, currently ranked sixth in the nation in the all
around. won the all-around with a 39.725, as well as the vault
with a 9.925, the uneven bars with a 9.925 and the floor exer
cise with a 9.95. She was named Pac-lOGymnast of the Week,
an honor that no Stanford gymnast has received for the past
two years.
"Natalie had a super meet, she is such a great leader
and steady competitor for us," said head coach Kristen
Smyth. "Vault and bars were as strong as I'd ever seen
her perform."
The team has struggled on the road in the past, having
been undefeated at home but winless on the road until
last Friday night. The Cardinal has often lacked the same
energy it has at home when they travel, but Friday night
was different.
"Oregon State was a great place to compete, with almost
4,1 XX) fans, the band playing, and just a lot of enthusiasm for
great gymnastics," Smyth said. "Our gymnasts warmed up ef
ficiently and competed confidently."
The team hit 24-of-24 routines without a single fall. Bal
ance beam was particularly strong, as five of the six gymnasts
scored 9.925 sand Foley rounded out the effort with a 9.9.
Stanford is currently ranked third in the nation on beam.
