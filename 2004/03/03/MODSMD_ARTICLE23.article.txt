### THOMAS TAYLOR 
Club sports might not he among the most fash
ionable sports here, hut when their athletes play
against another university they do it purely because
they love the sport and want their team and school
to win. When one sees his or her teammates playing
on regardless of injuries for nothing more than the
sake of those around them, their dedication be
comes apparent.
Interested students should know that club sports
are open to all students. They can visit the club sports
Web site at http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pe/club
sports.html. Now, on to this week's roundup.

Rugby
Next weekend is the Big Game for both the men's

home on Saturday in the latest of a long run of match
es that highlight the sometimes-intense sporting ri
valry between the two universities. In fact, from 1906
to l l )14, the official Big Game was Rugby, not Amer
ican football.
I he women s team hopes to continue its excellent
yeai with a win over Cal, while the men know that
even given the difficult nature of their season so far,
anything can happen in this contest.
