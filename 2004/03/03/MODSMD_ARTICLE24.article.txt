# Men head to Pac-10 swim
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's swim team
certainly boasts some impressive
statistics: 33 consecutive dual meet
victories, a 93-13 record against Cal
and eight NCAA championships,
just to name a few. But perhaps the
most incredible figure is the num
ber of consecutive Pacific-10 Con
ference titles that the team has
won: 22. For over two decades, only
one team has walked away from
Pac-lOs with the first-place trophy.
This weekend, at the Belmont
Plaza Olympic Pool in Long Beach,
Calif., the Cardinal hopes to win
number 23. After going undefeated
against both Pac-10 and non-con
ference opponents, the Cardinal
wants to keep its momentum going
into NCAAs at the end of March.
Coming off an exciting victory over
Cal two weekends ago, Stanford is
considered the favorite going into
this year's meet. Stanford's depth
will help it immensely, and with the
team beginning to gel together, the
outlook is positive.
"Every last person on this team

is very well prepared," senior An
drew Schneil said. "And no one
wants to be part of the team that
ends the streak."
The usual suspects will lead the
way for the team, with seniors
Peter Marshall and Markus Rogan
looking to win individual titles.
Marshall, a two-time NCAA cham
pion in the 100-yard backstroke,
has not won a Pac-10 title in the
event — at least not yet. Rogan,
another one of the nation's top
backstrokers, should contend for
titles in both backstroke and indi
vidual medley events. Senior
Michael Bruce, the Pac-10 meet
record holder in the 200-yard
breastroke, should continue his
strong recovery from injury.
With the strong senior class
leading the way, the rest of the
Stanford team should also con
tribute heavily to the scoring. Ju
nior butterflyers Jaynie Cramer
and Matt McDonald look to take
on Cal heavyweight Michael Cavic,
while Dan Trupin looks to score
some big points in the individual
medley events.
One of the team's many

strengths, its distance swimming,
comes from the lower classmen.
Freshman Shaun Phillips and
sophomore Mike McLean should
place high in the 500- and 1650-yard
freestyle events. In the 200-yard
freestyle, a distance swimmer's
sprint, freshman Andy Grant,
sophomore Tobias Oriwol and
Cramer should all contend for the
title. After placing 1-2-3 at the Cal
meet in the 200, the three could re
peat their sweep at the conference
level; they are seeded 1-2-3 going
into the meet.
Overall, the meet should yield
some extremely fast times and an ex
citing atmosphere. All of the Pac-10
teams are readying for the NCAA
Championships at the end of March,
and this week's meet is one of the
final stages of preparation.
With the women's team having
won its own Pac-10 title just last
weekend, this could definitely be
the year of the Cardinal.
