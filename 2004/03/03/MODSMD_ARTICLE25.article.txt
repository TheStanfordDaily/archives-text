# Men's lacrosse falls to Cal Poly
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's usually much easier to main
tain a lead than it is to erase one.
That's what the No. 20 Stanford
men's lacrosse team discovered this
past Saturday in a 14-6 home loss to
No. 13 Cal Poly.
The loss drops the Cardinal —
which earned its first top-25 rank
ing of the season last week — into
second place in the West Coast
Lacrosse League North Confer
ence, one game behind first-place
Cal Poly.
Outscored 6-1 in the first half,
the Cardinal (2-2, 2-1 WCLL
North) was unable to generate
much of an offensive rhythm early
in the game. Despite registering
five goals after halftime, Stanford
struggled to compete with the ag
gressive Mustang offense that re
sponded with eight goals of its own.
"We came out flat from the be
ginning," said sophomore attacker
Alex Choo. "We got on a run be
cause we got back our game plan,
but we weren't able to hold onto it

for long."
The Mustangs wasted little time
in the first quarter, scoring their
first goal after just 45 seconds of
play. With help from Kenny
Williams and Peter Reed. Cal Poly
quickly jumped out to a 4-0 lead.
Stanford finally got on hoard
when freshman Ben Stillman found
the top corner of the net with just
two seconds remaining in the first
quarter. It would turn out to be the
Cardinal's only point of the half,
however, as it was held to just four
shots on goal in the second quarter.
Despite three goals in the third
quarter, including two from sopho
more midfielder Tyler Gutierrez,
and two in the fourth, the Cardinal
was unable to erase its five-point
deficit from the first half.
"We didn't do any of the little
things well." said sophomore goalie
Michael Zell, who had 12 saves in
Saturday's game. "We didn't win
ground balls, we threw the ball
away on offense, and we were out
hustled in between the lines. We
generally brought little intensity to
the game."

Besides being out-shot 39-25
and losing 12 of 20 face-offs, the
Cardinal was also plagued by in
juries. Standout sophomore mid
fielder Malcolm Brown did not play
on Saturday and is going to be out
for the remainder of the season
with a knee injury.
"Brown is our best defensive
midfielder, and we had relatively
inexperienced guys replacing him,"
Zell said. "On defense, as well,
three of the four defensemen in the
rotation were battling injuries."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
though, senior captain Ben
Spohn, who suffered a mild con
cussion during the second quar
ter, will not be missing any prac
tice time this week.
The Cardinal will look to avenge
its loss when it heads down south
for the Loyola Marymount Invita
tional this next weekend. Facing off
against No. 12 Simon Fraser Uni
versity on Saturday and either No.
19 Boston College or No. 25 Loyola
Marymount on Sunday, the Cardi
nal hopes to prove that it is indeed
worthy of a top-25 ranking.
