"I haven't felt any more pressure
than normal," she said. "Right now
I'm just concentrating on this week
end's games and am focused on
whoever we play Saturday."
Newlin also stressed the
team's focus going into the Pac
-10 Tournament.
"We are doing everything we
can to win the Pac-10 Champi
onship this weekend. We're fo
cused and practicing hard," Newlin
said. "We know it won't be easy,
but if we play like we're capable of
we will do very well."
With a talented roster and a
strong work ethic, the Stanford
women at their best could dominate
the Pac-10 as much as the men have.

Unfortunately, the team has been
inconsistent to date.
VanDerveer noted Stanford's
improvement in taking care of the
ball. The Cardinal had a combined
14 turnovers in its last two games,
while it often approaches 20 in a sin
gle game. She would like the team
to be more physical and take more
shots close to the basket.
"We're not as aggressive as we
need to be to give ourselves the best
chance at high percentage shots,"
VanDerveer said.
She sounded optimistic about
the team's potential, and said the
Cardinal is always trying to fig
ure out the best combinations of
its players.
A strong showing at the Pac-10
Tournament might not mean much
national prestige for the Card, but a
weak performance will send a mes
sage to the NCAA committee and
could make Stanford's progress
through the NCAA Tournament

considerably harder.
"1 think it's a good presumption
[that we're in NCAAsJ," Van-
Derveer said. "1 think we can hurt it
more than we can help it."
Roughly half of the Pac-10 has a
shot at making it to the Big Dance.
Stanford and, which has been
ranked in the top ten for most of the
season, and Arizona are almost as
sured a spot somewhere in the tour
nament. Arizona State, Southern
California and UCLA need a strong
Pac-10 Tournament finish if they
hope to remain in the running.
With so many recent shake
ups in the Pac-10, each team has a
shot at making the champi
onship, though the Cardinal is
still the favorite.
The Cardinal squad seems excit
ed, but resolute, going into this
weekend.
"If people aren't excited about
the tournament, they should take
up tennis," VanDerveer said.
