## Immunization controversy: Should colleges require the bacterial meningitis vaccine? 
### LAUREN GONG 
It starts out like a bad case of the flu: You experi
ence body aches, a high fever, headaches and vomiting.
The reason you suspect it might not be an ordinary case
of influenza is a stiffness in the back of your neck.
These are the symptoms of meningococcal meningi
tis. which caused the death of Alisa Lewis, the UC-
Berkeley basketball player on Jan. 19, and has prompt
ed many to wonder whether vaccinations should be a
college entrance requirement.
In 1999, following the Center for Disease Control's
(CDC) report that college freshmen have a moderately
heightened risk of contracting the disease, 13 states, not
including California, began to require the vaccine. How
ever, both Stanford students and health administrators
have mixed opinions about the decision to make the vac
cine mandatory.
Meningococcal meningitis has two forms, bacterial
and viral; only the former is treatable. The disease
spreads the same way as mononucleosis — through
sharing drinks, kissing and coughing in someone else's
mouth. While both can be fatal, the bacterial infection
is the one to be concerned about — the viral infection
is usually less severe.
The bacterial infection leads to death in about 10
percent of those infected and can also cause brain
damage and hearing loss if not treated with antibi
otics quickly. It is also the strain most common on
college campuses.

According to a one-year survey performed in 1998
by the CDC, there is a higher incidence of meningo
coccal meningitis among college students compared 18
to 23 year olds not enrolled in college.
The meningococcal meningitis vaccine only works
against some strains of bacterial meningitis. However,
according to the CDC, it could still potentially eradi
cate 80 percent of all college meningitis cases.
Stanford and the CDC both strongly recommend
that students read up on the disease and consider get
ting the vaccine. It costs $80 and lasts about three to
five years. The Vaden Student Health Center offers the
vaccine year-round at the immunization clinic and in
the past has administered about 200 meningitis immu
nizations a year.
Vaden currently does not require the vaccine but
provides education about the infection and treatment.
"I don't think it would be a good policy to require
the vaccine," said Dr. Ira Friedman, who works at
Vaden. "A vaccine should be required only when its
benefits far outweigh its costs, in dollars and other
wise. This is not the case for the meningococcal vac
cine. That's why public health authorities support an
educational approach."
However, other medical professionals disagree with
Friedman's opinions and claim that there is no signifi
cant reason not to get the meningitis vaccine. Accord
ing to the CDC. the vaccine proves 85 to 90 percent ef
fective against the most common strains.with rare side
effects of mild redness or slight fever.

According to Dr. Larry Hsu, who practices inter
nal medicine in Chico, Calif., "Requiring students
to have the vaccine does not seem to me to be a sig
nificant burden, as it is proven effective with few
side effects. Meningococcus is highly contagious,
and therefore, the more people that are vaccinated
and protected the fewer overall cases / deaths there
will be."
Friedman cites administrative costs and the private
expense of the vaccine incurred by the student as un
necessary burdens.
"The cost of administering the requirement here
would draw resources away from other efforts, like di
rect services to students," she said.
"It could also draw attention away from other, more
pressing problems and effective vaccines, such as hep
atitis B vaccine," she added.
Many students are not convinced that the vaccine
should be required and said they believe that it is more
than just a preventative measure against a disease, but
an act that affects one's basic rights.
"Freedom of choice is a constitutional right, so re
quiring students to be vaccinated prior to entering
college is a violation of basic rights," said sophomore
Ben Reddy. "It's similar to requiring someone to be
a certain religion."
However, other students do not see vaccination
requirements as an infringement of personal choice;
rather, they see the requirement as protection
against contagious agents. Requiring the vaccination
ensures maximum risk avoidance for the entire stu
dent body, while allowing freedom of choice impos
es risk on everyone.
Sophomore Rachel Hsu is unsure whether colleges
should make the meningitis vaccine mandatory, but
thinks that not getting vaccinated does put others at
greater risk.
"My parents are both doctors and they told me to
get the vaccination just because it's a risk you don't
want to take," Hsu said. "Sometimes I think that get
ting vaccinations shouldn't be your choice because if
you get a contagious disease like meningitis, you're
putting others in danger," she added.
Still, as of now. Stanford has no plans to introduce a
vaccination requirement.
"A requirement might suggest to students that the
vaccine is more effective than it really is," Friedman
said. "We don't want students to get a false sense of se
curity that somehow they are not at risk at all, since the
vaccine is not 100 percent effective, even for the strains
that it covers."
As of now, Vaden's educational approach is work
ing. Many students said that they have been encour
aged to get the vaccine by just becoming more aware
of the disease and its risks.
Just earlier this week, sophomore Elise Haas
made an appointment to get the meningitis vaccina
tion after hearing about the recent Bay Area death
caused by the disease.
"My doctor recommended that I get the bacterial
meningitis vaccine because 1 live in a dorm," Haas
said. "When 1 heard about Alisa Lewis, the basket
ball player from |UC-Berkeley], I remembered that I
hadn't gotten vaccinated yet and made an appoint
ment at Vaden," she said.
However, if not every student receives the vac
cine, even those who do make the choice to get the
vaccine are placed at risk by others who haven't
taken that step because the vaccine is not 100 per
cent effective. Some still contend that the act of get
ting vaccinated is not a matter of individual choice
but should be a public health decision to keep a com
munity safe.
Added Hsu, "Every individual has a responsibility
to the community that he / she lives in. Another way
to look at it is: If an unvaccinated person became in
fected with meningococcal meningitis, not only might
he die, but he has also unnecessarily put many other
people at risk."
