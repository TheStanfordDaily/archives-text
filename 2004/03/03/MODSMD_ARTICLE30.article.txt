## Stocking your essential college life medicines 
### CHARLES FENG HEAL TO COLUMNIST 
My parents keep our cornucopia of
medicine bottles tucked away in a nonde
script cabinet in the bathroom — for fear
that snooping visitors might unearth dirty,
little secrets concerning the current state of
our family's health. Adhering to family tra
dition. I stash my medications in a white
plastic bag at the bottom of my dresser.
Yet for some reason — perhaps because
I'm leaving in June or maybe because of my
Peer Health Educator (PHE) aspirations,
which, sadly, will never be realized — I
suddenly feel compelled to share the list of
medicines that have kept me going since I
arrived on the Farm as a starry-eyed fresh
man. As a senior, I can tell you that there is
no douht that college life is stressful; Lack
of sleep, tough courses, endless extracurric
ular activities — they all take a toll on your
immune system. Which is why every college
student should be armed with an essential
medicine kit.
But first, the fine print. Medicines
should only be used when absolutely neces
sary. As young, spry and blindingly idealis
tic students, we can rest assured that our
natural defenses will, in most cases, ade
quately protect us against the bacteria and
viruses that can infiltrate our organs. More
importantly, our bodies, as unique as fin
gerprints, will respond with varying de
grees of efficacy to different medications.
So if you're old or recovering from a life
threatening illness a different medicine
cabinet might, of course, be more applica
ble. In addition, some can drugs interact
with other medications or ingested prod
ucts. For example, alcohol can interact with
many medications, so always check the
package before you pop the pill.

Pcpto-Bismol. Its active ingredient, bis
muth salicylate, coats the intestinal track and
alleviates the grease-laden symptoms from
the Stern Late Nite fare 1 wolfed down the
night before. In more rare circumstances,
Pepto-Bismol helps my stomach live through
the morning-after effects of a wicked hang
over. Get the chewable kind only, because
when you're overcome with nausea, the last
thing you want to be imbibing is a pink, cur
dled liquid.
Tylenol. As far as all-purpose medica
tions go, Tylenol is the one-stop shop for all
your pain-relieving needs. Like any good
monopoly, Tylenol has elongated its tenta
cles to include special pills for menstrual
cramps, arthritis, children's pains and pain
relief accompanied by sleeplessness. The
original strength formula, however, will suf
fice for most purposes. I've taken it in the
midst of finals week; after I got my wisdom
teeth pulled out; and when, as the latest
plague blazed through dormitory, my throat
became unbearably scratchy.
Sudafed. Based on the recommendation
of Margaret Onwuka, senior and Murray
PHE extraordinaire, Sudafed Cold and
Cough is the drug of choice when your once
innocuous cold has exploded into a cacopho
ny of coughs, wheezes and nostril mayhem.
Sudafed acts primarily as a decongestant,
shrinking blood vessels in the nose so that
the nostrils become temporarily cleared of
mucus. Bonus: Sudafed doesn't cause
drowsiness, making it especially useful dur
ing the end-of-quartcr crunch.
NyQuil. It's like Sudafed, except that it's
supposed to be taken at night; as it relieves
symptoms, NyQuil advertises an evening of
sweet slumber. So my barnyard regiment of
late, when I'm too lazy to go to Vaden, is
Sudafed in the day and NyQuil before bed.
although no scientific studies have ever vali

dated the effectiveness of this common cold
fighting tag team. Indeed, neither Sudafed
nor NyQuil will cure your cold or flu; they
can only temporarily relieve your symptoms.
Nevertheless, the combination works for me,
if only because I've deluded myself with the
placebo effect.
Cortaid. This topical medicine is not some
thing that passes through your esophagus, but
it's still equally indispensable. In order to fight
itching — whether it be from poison oak,
mosquito bites or a lack of showering — Cor
taid's main component, hydrocortisone, sup
presses your body's natural allergy response.
How it works, exactly, nobody knows, because
medical science, with far more pressing con
cerns, has not worked out the biological path
ways of itching. Its weakness, however, is its
lack of potency. For more serious skin ailments
— don't worry, most everyone has one — you
might need a dermatologist's prescription.
Even though these medications might be
useful, Onwuka recommends prevention — vi
tamins, plenty of water, ample amounts of
sleep. Going through the day-to-day motions of
college life, however, it's easy to forget that a lit
tle preventive effort now can go a long way to
ward a healthy lifestyle later. Lost in the exu
berance of youth. I am, of course, invincible —
although down the line. I'll certainly be inun
dated with a slew of chronic illnesses, at which
point I'll have a new bag of medications to
share.

if only because I've deluded myself with the
placebo effect.
Cortaid. This topical medicine is not some
thing that passes through your esophagus, but
it's still equally indispensable. In order to fight
itching — whether it be from poison oak,
mosquito bites or a lack of showering — Cor
taid's main component, hydrocortisone, sup
presses your body's natural allergy response.
How it works, exactly, nobody knows, because
medical science, with far more pressing con
cerns, has not worked out the biological path
ways of itching. Its weakness, however, is its
lack of potency. For more serious skin ailments
— don't worry, most everyone has one — you
might need a dermatologist's prescription.
Even though these medications might be
useful, Onwuka recommends prevention — vi
tamins, plenty of water, ample amounts of
sleep. Going through the day-to-day motions of
college life, however, it's easy to forget that a lit

ward a healthy lifestyle later. Lost in the exu
berance of youth. I am, of course, invincible —
although down the line. I'll certainly be inun
dated with a slew of chronic illnesses, at which
point I'll have a new bag of medications to
share.

College life is tough on your immune system so make sure you have medicines
such as Pepto-Bismol, NyQuil, Tylenol and Sudafed on hand.
My parents keep our cornucopia of
medicine bottles tucked away in a nonde
script cabinet in the bathroom — for fear
that snooping visitors might unearth dirty,
little secrets concerning the current state of
our family's health. Adhering to family tra
dition. I stash my medications in a white
plastic bag at the bottom of my dresser.
Yet for some reason — perhaps because
I'm leaving in June or maybe because of my
Peer Health Educator (PHE) aspirations,
which, sadly, will never be realized — I
suddenly feel compelled to share the list of
medicines that have kept me going since I
arrived on the Farm as a starry-eyed fresh
man. As a senior, I can tell you that there is
no douht that college life is stressful; Lack
of sleep, tough courses, endless extracurric
ular activities — they all take a toll on your
immune system. Which is why every college
student should be armed with an essential
medicine kit.
But first, the fine print. Medicines
should only be used when absolutely neces
sary. As young, spry and blindingly idealis
tic students, we can rest assured that our
natural defenses will, in most cases, ade
quately protect us against the bacteria and
viruses that can infiltrate our organs. More
importantly, our bodies, as unique as fin
gerprints, will respond with varying de
grees of efficacy to different medications.
So if you're old or recovering from a life
threatening illness a different medicine
cabinet might, of course, be more applica
ble. In addition, some can drugs interact
with other medications or ingested prod
ucts. For example, alcohol can interact with
many medications, so always check the
package before you pop the pill.

Pcpto-Bismol. Its active ingredient, bis
muth salicylate, coats the intestinal track and
alleviates the grease-laden symptoms from
the Stern Late Nite fare 1 wolfed down the
night before. In more rare circumstances,
Pepto-Bismol helps my stomach live through
the morning-after effects of a wicked hang
over. Get the chewable kind only, because
when you're overcome with nausea, the last
thing you want to be imbibing is a pink, cur
dled liquid.
Tylenol. As far as all-purpose medica
tions go, Tylenol is the one-stop shop for all
your pain-relieving needs. Like any good
monopoly, Tylenol has elongated its tenta
cles to include special pills for menstrual
cramps, arthritis, children's pains and pain
relief accompanied by sleeplessness. The
original strength formula, however, will suf
fice for most purposes. I've taken it in the
midst of finals week; after I got my wisdom
teeth pulled out; and when, as the latest
plague blazed through dormitory, my throat
became unbearably scratchy.
Sudafed. Based on the recommendation
of Margaret Onwuka, senior and Murray
PHE extraordinaire, Sudafed Cold and
Cough is the drug of choice when your once
innocuous cold has exploded into a cacopho
ny of coughs, wheezes and nostril mayhem.
Sudafed acts primarily as a decongestant,
shrinking blood vessels in the nose so that
the nostrils become temporarily cleared of
mucus. Bonus: Sudafed doesn't cause
drowsiness, making it especially useful dur
ing the end-of-quartcr crunch.
NyQuil. It's like Sudafed, except that it's
supposed to be taken at night; as it relieves
symptoms, NyQuil advertises an evening of
sweet slumber. So my barnyard regiment of
late, when I'm too lazy to go to Vaden, is
Sudafed in the day and NyQuil before bed.
although no scientific studies have ever vali

dated the effectiveness of this common cold
fighting tag team. Indeed, neither Sudafed
nor NyQuil will cure your cold or flu; they
can only temporarily relieve your symptoms.
Nevertheless, the combination works for me,
if only because I've deluded myself with the
placebo effect.
Cortaid. This topical medicine is not some

taid's main component, hydrocortisone, sup
