# Engineers face changes in curricula

Department of Civil Engineering
officials appear unconcerned by a re
port released on Feb. 25 by the
American Society of Civil Engineers
(ASCE), which recommends signifi
cant changes to many schools' cur
rent curricula.
According to the society's Web
site, the report's authors attempted
to define the "Body of Knowledge
needed to enter the practice of civil
engineering at the professional level
(licensure) in the 21st Century."
Richard Luthy, chair of the De
partment of Civil and Environmen
tal engineering, said that Stanford
already observes many of the fea
tures of ASCE's "Body of Knowl
edge" study. He described the report
as a reflection of evolving thought in
the field.
"The report has 15 broad points,
and 10 are already part of what we
do to meet accreditation," he said.
"There's not much new that's
popped up, and of the other points,
some seem to be elaborations of
those 10."
The Body of Knowledge (BOK)
report advocates an increase in the
number of hours of course work
students should complete before
being eligible for licenses in civil
engineering.
Luthy said he was skeptical
about increasing the hours of
coursework required for under
graduate students.
"We would not be a department
that thinks the way to the future is to
cram more courses into the under
graduate curriculum," he said.
One civil engineering student,
sophomore Teena Redhorse, did
not sound troubled by the idea of ad
ditional coursework.
"I think that Stanford does its
share of challenging some of the na

tion's most accomplished youth,"
she said. "I think that improving any
kind of engineering department,
whether it be civil, chemical, electri
cal or mechanical, is not necessarily a
bad thing, because by challenging us
with coursework it just forces us to
look deeper and to work harder."
The BOK report also recom
mends that the majority of faculty
members in civil engineering have
practical experience in the field.
Luthy explained that the idea
professional licenses for civil and en
vironmental engineers is unique
among the engineering fields.
"It's like ail MBA in business"
"In our field we look at buildings
and structures, at the quality of air
and water and soils," he said "We deal
with human safety and health ...
those are things you don't want to
screw up on."
Senior Carolyn Calcagni, an elec
trical engineering major, agreed that
experience is especially important in
civil engineering projects.
"I would support a curriculum
that integrates more practical expe
rience into education," she said.
"I've been lucky to find good intern
ships that have added that dimen
sion to my engineering education,
but not everyone has that experi
ence to draw from. Additionally. I
feel like it's even more important to
apply civil engineering knowledge
than electrical engineering because
of the stakes — trial-and-error is
fine in the lab and the classroom, but
not in a construction or city plan
ning project."
On the other hand, Luthy said he
felt that professional experience or
licensing might be less important in a
university context. It is still a topic up
for debate, with some states — in
cluding Texas — requiring that pro
fessors have practical experience.

While Luthy is licensed, some in
structors in the department are not.
"I'm not so sure that having a li
cense makes someone a good
teacher," he said. "It depends on the
history of the individual. Did they
work or go straight into academia
from a Ph.D.?"
He also mentioned that some
professors choose not hold Califor
nia licenses because of additional re
quirements in earthquake engineer
ing and safety that have little to do
with their fields of research.
"It's more important that a facul
ty member serve as a scholar, educa
tor and role model," he said.
Calcagni said she was also op
posed to requiring professors to
have practical experience working in
their field.
"Part of the benefit of having
academia separated from the busi
ness world is the freedom to work
with new ideas outside of the con
straints of profitability and market
place demands." she said. "The role
of professors in doing research is to
look further out than industry can af
ford to. Requiring them to come
from industry would take away some
of that separation and possibly also
negatively impact the flow of re
search ideas."
Scott Cloyd, a master's student in
the Construction Engineering and
Management (CEM) Program and a
registered professional mechanical
engineer in North Carolina, said he
believed that students planning on
pursuing careers outside of acade
mia would benefit from professors
with practical experience in the field.
"Experience as a practicing engineer
helps the individual engineer devel
op a better understanding of all of
the constraints found in the real
world — funding, manpower, time,
