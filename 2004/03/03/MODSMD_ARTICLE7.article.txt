### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
As the grand prize winner of the
national "MTV and mtvU Free Ride
Contest," sophomore Jeff Orlowski
received a $50,000 college scholarship
and a hybrid Toyota Prius. Freshman
Edwin Chiu won second place.
The competition, held by MTV;
Music Television and college televi
sion network mtvU, celebrated higher
education and the pursuit fora cleaner
environment by awarding the means
to make a difference and an environ
mentally friendly way to get around,
according to the press release.
The impressive prize convinced
Orlowski and Chiu to enter.
"It was a really cool prize," Or
lowski said. "Because of the scholar
ship money and the car, I thought it
would be worth my time to apply."
The 16- to 25-year-old applicants
completed two essay questions about
the environment and how music has
impacted their lives. The essays were
judged by MTV, the Natural Re

sources Defense Council and the rap
per Nas to choose the grand prize, first
place and second place winners.
In his essay, Orlowski discussed his
experience with Talisman, the a cap
pella group he manages. Orlowski said
the cultural significance of the music
has given him a different more global
perspective and has shaped his views
of the world.
In response to the other essay topic
that asked how he would help the en
vironment if he had only one year, Or
lowski said he would use a large-scale
media campaign to advocate protect
ing the environment.
"Massive advertising campaigns
have been really successful and are
going to be most effective if you want
to reach out to young people and bet
ter environmental practices," he said.
He also discussed his prior work
with environmental groups and with
Jane Goodall.
Orlowski said he believes he won
because his essays reflected his deep
connection to music and the environ
ment.

"I've been very involved with
[ music and the environment] fora long
time," said Orlowski. "The essays
were really easy to write because I
have so much to say about the topics."
Orlowski's involvement with music
started with playing the piano for ten
years and developed when he began
singing in Talisman last year.
"Talisman has played a huge role in
my Stanford life and my life in general,
connecting me to a huge world of cul
ture and diversity of music, which is in
credibly valuable to me," he said.
"They're an incredible group of peo
ple from all over the world, and just
sharing music with them has been one
of best things at Stanford for me."
Orlowski said he has always en
joyed camping and being outdoors.
For that reason, he has been involved
with activism and various groups to
protect the environment.
Orlowski is particularly excited he
won the Prius because of its innovative
technology and gas mileage.
