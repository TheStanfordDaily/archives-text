## Battle of the singers Fleet Street and Harmonics compete in the ICCA 
### MELANIE CORBETT 
Lately, Stanford's Fleet Street a
cappella group has not just been
singing at its rehearsals. Closely resem
bling an athletic team. Fleet Street has
included crunches, stretches, running
and elaborate choreography work into
its practices.
The adoption of such an intense
routine has been in preparation for the
International Championship of Colle
giate A Cappella (ICCA) at which
Fleet Street competed this past week
end at Brigham Young University
(BYU) in Utah. The Harmonics also
competed in the same Western divi
sion, but in a different quarterfinal
round. They performed at UC-Berke
ley on Feb. 7.
"The competition at Brigham
Young was a lot of fun. We left our per
formance feeling satisfied that we had
put on one of our best shows of the
year." said junior Sanjay Kairam, Fleet
Street's business director.
Fleet Street placed third, missing
the opportunity to advance to the semi
finals by just one spot. The Harmonics
did not place in the top three groups.
Every year, the ICCA holds 25 com
petitions from January to March in six
regions across the country. All of the
regions run three quarterfinals, each
exhibiting six groups, and the top two
groups from each quarterfinal advance
to the region semifinals. The first place
team from each semifinal competes in
the finals, which are held in Carnegie
Hall and the Lincoln Center's Avery
Fisher Hall in New York City.
Stanford's two groups started
preparing for the competition almost
six weeks ago. Members of Fleet Street
went running before many rehearsals
in order to get in shape and to improve
breath control and energy. Three
weeks ago, they began working on
complex choreography and sometimes
employed special stretches and drills
on isolation movement, according to
freshman Rory Everitt, Fleet Street's
album manager.

As the competition drew nearer,
the group worked even harder to per
fect its acts.
"For the last week before the com
petition. we went into rehearsal-inten
sive mode, really working on our
sound and polish," Everitt said.
The Harmonics also dedicated sub
stantial time and energy to preparing
for the competition. At their re
hearsals, they practiced the three songs
of their set â€” "Blurry" by Puddle of
Mudd. "Die Another Day," by Madon
na and "Bring Me to Life," by Evanes
cence. They also worked on how they
would present the songs at the ICCA.
"We added choreography to our set
and also tied them all together with
musical transitions instead of pausing
between songs," said senior Gautam
Raghavan, president of the Stanford
Harmonics.
The Harmonics have competed in
the ICCA three years in a row, while
this is the first time in several years that
Fleet Street has participated in the
event. The ICCA began in 19%, and
since its launch it has given top college
acappella groups the chance to display
their talent to an international audi
ence and receive valuable commentary
from highly qualified judges.
"The ICCA is a great way of moti
vating a group to really perfect a cou
ple of songs," Raghavan said.
The fact that only two of Stanford's
a cappella groups participated in the
competition can partly be attributed to
the judging subjectivity of competi
tions in general.
"Everyone knows how subjective
competitions like these are, so they all
have to make the decision of whether
it's worth their time and effort to sub
mit an application." Raghavan said.
"This year, we decided it was, if only
for the chance to perform fora large
audience, get some exposure and win
some awards."
The other main reason for the ab
sence of several Stanford groups
from the ICCA is the incredible ded
ication that is required both to pre

pare and to compete.
Fleet Street can attest to this.
"Since we were simultaneously
recording our eighth album, planning a
spring tour to the East Coast and
preparing for the competition, this
winter quarter was very busy for us,"
Everitt said.
Transportation to and from the
event was an experience in itself. For
the majority of the group, it took ap
proximately 14 hours each way to drive
to the Park City, Utah, house where
they stayed. Even travel time for those
who flew was significant.
When the time came to perform, the
group was not only well-prepared but
also very composed. The members did
not let nerves get in the way of their
performance or their ability to enjoy
themselves onstage.
"I didn't get very nervous for the ac
tual performance. I was able to get out
on stage and just have a good time. We
had worked on drilling our perfor
mance into our minds, so that once we
hit the stage, we could just run on au
topilot," Everitt said.
Fleet Street's enthusiastic perfor
mance received a tremendous re
sponse from the audience at BYU. In
fact, it was the crowd's most positive
reaction to a group that was not native
to BYU, according to Everitt.
"When it was announced that we
had won third place, the crowd mur
mured with surprise. While it was a lit
tle disappointing that we did not ad
vance, it was satisfying to see that the
audience had wanted for us to do so,"
Kairam said.
It is likely that the particular biases
of the judges at least partly accounted
for the outcome, according to Everitt.
"One of the judges enjoyed more
conservative a cappella, whereas we
tend to be cutting edge in entertainment,
and thus we didn't win," said Everitt.
They may not have won the top
group award, but Fleet Street did take
home some of the individual prizes.
The ICCA individual categories are
Outstanding Vocal Percussion, Out

standing Arrangement, Outstanding
Choreography and Outstanding
Soloist. Fleet Street placed first in Out
standing Choreography and Outstand
ing Soloist, which sophomore Ben
Rosebrough claimed for his rendition
of "Renegade."
At UC-Berkeley, the Harmonics'
senior Ben D'Angelo and junior
Daniel Holbert won the award for Out
standing Vocal Percussion. Addition
ally, senior Christine Olivas was
praised in the judges' comments for her
solo in "Bring Me To Life."
Both groups were very pleased with
their performances and enjoyed the ex
posure to other a cappella acts.
"We were very happy with our per
formance and impressed with some of
the other groups," Raghavan said.
Everitt also noted the chance to see
how Fleet Street measured up against
other teams.
"We were able to watch three other
groups perform, and it was very inter
esting to mentally compare Fleet
Street to them," Everitt said.
Fleet Street and the Harmonics are
ready to utilize the feedback they received
from the competition. They plan on con
tinuing to work hard and to have even
more success at next year's competition.
"It has been many years since Fleet
Street last competed in the ICCA, so
now we know what the judges look for
and can tailor accordingly. We will al
most definitely be back next year to
kick butt," Everitt said.
Stanford will host the semifinal
round for the Western division on
March 13 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The groups that will compete are the
University of Oregon "Divisi" and the
University of Oregon "On The
Rocks" (the top finishers from the
UC-Berkeley competition), the Mt.
San Antonio College "Fermata
Nowhere" and the University of
Southern California "Reverse Osmo
sis" (from the USC competition), the
BYU "Vocal Point" and the Universi
ty of Colorado "Extreme Measures"
(from the BYU competition).
