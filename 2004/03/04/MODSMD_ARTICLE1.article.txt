# Perfection in sight
## 
### WILL OREMUS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There are so many potential pitfalls on a 27-game
regular-season schedule. A trip to Oregon's raucus
Mac Arthur Court. Two matchups with arch rival Ari
zona. A duel with perennial NCAA Tournament pow
erhouse Gonzaga. An early-season battle against top
ranked Kansas.
So far, Stanford has navigated its way through 25
games without tripping up once. Two more, and the No. 1
Cardinal makes history as the first team ever to compile a
perfect 18-0 record in Pacific-10 Conference play. Eleven
more wins, and... well, the team isn't thinking about that
possibility yet.
"It's like the elephant in the back of the room," head
coach Mike Montgomery said of his team's undefeated
record, which has brought the program a level of national
attention unprecedented in the modern era. Stanford (25-

0, 16-0 Pac-10) and Saint
Joseph's (27-0,18-0 Atlantic
-10) have a chance to become
the first teams since Nevada-
Las Vegas in 1991 to enter the
NCAA Tournament without
a loss.
For now, Stanford's focus
is on taking care of business in
the Pacific Northwest by win
ning its last two scheduled
regular-season games

against Washington State today and Washington on Sat
urday.
The road trip comes at the end of a tumultuous week
for the Cardinal. On Saturday, after beating Oregon State
and celebrating the Pac-10 Championship, the team said
goodbye to Maples Pavilion, which will be closed until
January of 2005 for a massive renovation. The team has
taken up temporary residence in a pair of trailers next to
the Ford Center, where the remainder of Stanford's home
practices will be held.
And on Monday, starting forward Nick Robinson and
his wife Meagan had their first baby, Annie Lee Robin
son, who he said yesterday is happy and in good health.
With all the distractions, it might seem that this week
end offers the Cardinal a perfect chance to lose before the
Pac-10 Tournament and NCAA Tournament. Senior
guard Matt Lottich doesn't see it that way.
"It kind of feels like a new start," he said of all the up
heaval. "The college basketball season is very long, and
teams can get tired and worn down, and this kind of feels
like a new start. It's kind of a jolt to our team."
Saturday's game against Washington has been circled
on people's calendars for a long time. The Huskies (15-10,
10-6), second in the Pac-10 behind Stanford, boast one of
the most athletic rosters the Cardinal has seen this year,
and they have won 10 of their last 11 conference games.
An upset win over Stanford would turn their season
from solid to special, and maybe land them a spot in the
NCAA Tournament.
But tonight's Washington State game (7:30 p.m.,
Fox Sports Bay Area) is lurking to keep the Cardinal
from looking ahead. The Cougars (12-14, 6-10) have
improved dramatically this year under the guidance of
new head coach Dick Bennett, who coached Wisonsin

to a Final Four appearance in 2000.
Lottich said this weekend's two opponents play entire
ly different styles of basketball.
"Washington State really tries to control the tempo,"
Lottich said. "They're running 28 seconds off the shot
clock before taking a shot, a high-percentage shot. It kind
of gets at your team after awhile. You play a lot of defense
and it can be frustrating at points, so it's really important
to stay positive, to stay focused, and not to come down and
take a quick shot offensively."
On offense, the Cougars' fortunes depend largely on
senior guard Marcus Moore, an erratic performer who
might miss all eight of his shots one night and bust loose
for 30 points the next. But on defense, Washington State
has been remarkably consistent, giving up more than 75
points just once all year.
Washington presents a different kind of challenge. The
Huskies began the conference schedule with five straight
losses, but their high-scoring, fast-breaking attack has pro

pelled them to several big
wins since. They are the only
team other than Stanford to
beat No. 22 Arizona twice.
They are led by three
guards: 6-foot-6 Brandon
Roy (13.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg), 5-
foot-9 Nate Robinson (12.5
ppg) and 6-foot-2 point
guard Will Conroy (12.3
ppg, 4.6 apg). Their up-and
down style helps obscure

their weakness in the post, where their tallest starter
stands just 6-foot-8.
Lottich said the Huskies will likely play the Cardinal
tougher than they did in an 85-72 loss to Stanford at
Maples on Jan. 4.
"They're playing a lot better now," Lottich said. "I
think they've found what they're good at and are execut
ing very well. They have kind of a crazy style of play, kind
of the exact opposite of Washington State, so we really
want to control the tempo against them, keep them in a
half-court game and not give them any easy buckets."
Washington ended a 10-game losing streak to Stanford
with a 73-68 win in Seattle last year.
"We've always had trouble up there," Montgomery
said. "We've always had to extend ourselves up there.
Being the end of the season, with everything on the
line ... it's going to be a tough trip."
Lottich said the team is looking at this season
ending road swing as a unique opportunity, not a do
or-die situation.
"I think just from a historical standpoint it's special, be
cause not many teams have finished the regular season un
defeated. But it's not the end of the world if we don't... I
think this team is mature enough and focused enough to
regroup and make a run at what's really important: the
NCAA Tournament."
His attitude echoes that of Montgomery, who is always
more focused on substantive goals like winning the con
ference or reaching the Final Four than on symbolic
achievements like an undefeated season.
"This is a special group of kids, regardless of what their
record would be," Montgomery said. "It just so happens
that this year it manifested itself into something that peo
ple could see."

defeated. But it's not the end of the world if we don't... I
think this team is mature enough and focused enough to
regroup and make a run at what's really important: the
NCAA Tournament."
His attitude echoes that of Montgomery, who is always
more focused on substantive goals like winning the con
ference or reaching the Final Four than on symbolic
achievements like an undefeated season.
"This is a special group of kids, regardless of what their
record would be," Montgomery said. "It just so happens
that this year it manifested itself into something that peo
ple could see."

Senior forward Joe Kirchofer pulls down a board against Oregon last weekend. The Cardinal looks to com
plete its perfect regular season in Washington this weekend.
There are so many potential pitfalls on a 27-game
regular-season schedule. A trip to Oregon's raucus
Mac Arthur Court. Two matchups with arch rival Ari
zona. A duel with perennial NCAA Tournament pow
erhouse Gonzaga. An early-season battle against top
ranked Kansas.
So far, Stanford has navigated its way through 25
games without tripping up once. Two more, and the No. 1
Cardinal makes history as the first team ever to compile a
perfect 18-0 record in Pacific-10 Conference play. Eleven
more wins, and... well, the team isn't thinking about that
possibility yet.
"It's like the elephant in the back of the room," head
coach Mike Montgomery said of his team's undefeated
record, which has brought the program a level of national
attention unprecedented in the modern era. Stanford (25-

0, 16-0 Pac-10) and Saint
Joseph's (27-0,18-0 Atlantic
-10) have a chance to become
the first teams since Nevada-
Las Vegas in 1991 to enter the
NCAA Tournament without
a loss.
For now, Stanford's focus
is on taking care of business in
the Pacific Northwest by win
ning its last two scheduled
regular-season games

against Washington State today and Washington on Sat
urday.
The road trip comes at the end of a tumultuous week
for the Cardinal. On Saturday, after beating Oregon State
and celebrating the Pac-10 Championship, the team said
goodbye to Maples Pavilion, which will be closed until
January of 2005 for a massive renovation. The team has
taken up temporary residence in a pair of trailers next to
the Ford Center, where the remainder of Stanford's home
practices will be held.
And on Monday, starting forward Nick Robinson and
his wife Meagan had their first baby, Annie Lee Robin
son, who he said yesterday is happy and in good health.
With all the distractions, it might seem that this week
end offers the Cardinal a perfect chance to lose before the
Pac-10 Tournament and NCAA Tournament. Senior
guard Matt Lottich doesn't see it that way.
"It kind of feels like a new start," he said of all the up
heaval. "The college basketball season is very long, and
teams can get tired and worn down, and this kind of feels
like a new start. It's kind of a jolt to our team."
Saturday's game against Washington has been circled
on people's calendars for a long time. The Huskies (15-10,
10-6), second in the Pac-10 behind Stanford, boast one of
the most athletic rosters the Cardinal has seen this year,
and they have won 10 of their last 11 conference games.
An upset win over Stanford would turn their season
from solid to special, and maybe land them a spot in the
NCAA Tournament.
But tonight's Washington State game (7:30 p.m.,
Fox Sports Bay Area) is lurking to keep the Cardinal
from looking ahead. The Cougars (12-14, 6-10) have
improved dramatically this year under the guidance of
new head coach Dick Bennett, who coached Wisonsin

to a Final Four appearance in 2000.
Lottich said this weekend's two opponents play entire
ly different styles of basketball.
"Washington State really tries to control the tempo,"
Lottich said. "They're running 28 seconds off the shot
clock before taking a shot, a high-percentage shot. It kind
of gets at your team after awhile. You play a lot of defense
and it can be frustrating at points, so it's really important
to stay positive, to stay focused, and not to come down and
take a quick shot offensively."
On offense, the Cougars' fortunes depend largely on
senior guard Marcus Moore, an erratic performer who
might miss all eight of his shots one night and bust loose
for 30 points the next. But on defense, Washington State
has been remarkably consistent, giving up more than 75
points just once all year.
Washington presents a different kind of challenge. The
Huskies began the conference schedule with five straight
losses, but their high-scoring, fast-breaking attack has pro

pelled them to several big
wins since. They are the only
team other than Stanford to
beat No. 22 Arizona twice.
They are led by three
guards: 6-foot-6 Brandon
Roy (13.6 ppg, 5.3 rpg), 5-
foot-9 Nate Robinson (12.5
ppg) and 6-foot-2 point
guard Will Conroy (12.3
ppg, 4.6 apg). Their up-and
down style helps obscure

their weakness in the post, where their tallest starter
stands just 6-foot-8.
Lottich said the Huskies will likely play the Cardinal
tougher than they did in an 85-72 loss to Stanford at
Maples on Jan. 4.
"They're playing a lot better now," Lottich said. "I
think they've found what they're good at and are execut
ing very well. They have kind of a crazy style of play, kind
of the exact opposite of Washington State, so we really
want to control the tempo against them, keep them in a
half-court game and not give them any easy buckets."
Washington ended a 10-game losing streak to Stanford
with a 73-68 win in Seattle last year.
"We've always had trouble up there," Montgomery
said. "We've always had to extend ourselves up there.
Being the end of the season, with everything on the
line ... it's going to be a tough trip."
Lottich said the team is looking at this season
ending road swing as a unique opportunity, not a do
or-die situation.
"I think just from a historical standpoint it's special, be
cause not many teams have finished the regular season un
defeated. But it's not the end of the world if we don't... I
think this team is mature enough and focused enough to
regroup and make a run at what's really important: the
NCAA Tournament."
