## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
This weekend, while the Stan
ford men's basketball team was
busy dominating the Pac-10 at
Maples Pavilion, another Stanford
team was also conquering the west.
The Stanford Bridge Team won
the west coast qualifier for the 2004
American Contract Bridge League
(ACBL) National Collegiate
Bridge tournament last Saturday,
Feb. 28, beating out UCLA, Cal
tech, University of Nebraska, UC-
Berkeley and University of Utah in
the online tournament.
The team of four students will be
headed to New York City in an all
expense paid trip in June to defend
its crown as champions of the 2003
ACBL National College Tourna
ment.

The four students of the team
representing Stanford are sopho
more Eric Mayefsy, computer sci
ence graduate student Samuel
leong, physics graduate student
Joon Pahk and computer science
graduate student Ho-Lin Chen.
The team will be competing in
the final tournament against other
universities that qualified
UCLA, MIT, Dartmouth, Ohio
Wesleyan and Carnegie Mellon.
Mayefsky said that going into
the qualifier this year, his team was
a little worried about the competi
tion because new schools partici
pated this year.
"We were worried, but the qual
ifier went better this year than last
year," Mayefsky said. "We won all
our matches this year."
However, now that the team has
gotten past the qualifying round,

Mayefsky is confident that they can
reclaim the title again.
"I was more worried about the
qualifier than anything else because
the matches are a lot shorter if
you have a stroke of bad luck, then
you get knocked out," Mayefsky
said. "The qualifier was only five
hands compared to the final match,
which will be 32 hands."
Mayefsky began playing bridge
when he was 13, but only became
serious about it a couple years ago.
Pahk is a "life master," a distinction
that is given to players who have
earned enough points from winning
tournaments through the ACBL.
Pahk has also competed for the
U.S. Junior National Team. leong
and Chen are international stu
dents and thus do not hold the same
distinction as Pahk; however, they
are recognized in their countries for
their bridge skills.
The team practices once a week
on Tuesday nights with the Stan
ford Bridge Club.
Mayefsky said that although
many of the players in the club have
developed their own systems of bid
ding, he and his teammates use the
standard advanced systems.
Robin Monsky, public relations
consultant for ACBL, said that
bridge's popularity has been in
creasing because people are realiz
ing the benefits of playing.

"Bill Gates and Warren Buffet
are huge fans of the game and par
ticipate in our tournaments," Mon
sky said. "Bridge is one of the top
games in preventing Alzheimer's
because it keeps your mind active."
The tournament will be taking
place at the same time as a national
tournament that ACBL sponsors.
