# Space Technology Center opens

### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to advance space research through
academic and industrial collaboration, two new tech
nology centers have opened near the National Aero
nautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Ames
Research Center in Mountain View. One of these
programs, the Space Technology Center (STC), will
bring students and faculty from Stanford and other
local universities together to develop new innova
tions and research opportunities.
In combining the knowledge of academics and in
dustry professionals, NASA aims to advance space
exploration, specifically in the area of robotics. Stan
ford will join forces with Santa Clara University, San
Jose State University, Utah State Universities and
Los Angeles-based Aerospace Corp. A NASA rep
resentative said they hope the research produced by
the STC will help to power the economy and facili
tate technology transfer, making cutting-edge dis
coveries more widely available to companies who
can apply them.
The center's site, located near Hangar One of the
Moffett Federal Airfield, includes classroom, labo
ratory and office space.
Education in space technology and industry is the
top priority for NASA and faculty members working
at the site. According to NASA officials, the new
centers will also focus on expanding knowledge in
areas of biotechnology, energy development, wire
less communication and information exchange.
This is not the first time Stanford has worked with
NASA or Ames.
Approximately 100 Stanford doctoral students
in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronau
tics have had the opportunity to be advised by
NASA Ames researchers since 1980. Students in
the University's mechanical engineering programs
have also benefited from advising relationships
with Ames professionals.
"Through past collaboration we are now helping
advance a concept of free flyers that NASA will be
using to do new space experiments due to limited ac
cess to the shuttle and the space station," said Aero
nautics and Astronautics Prof. Robert Twiggs, who
will be teaching "Spacecraft Design" for graduate
students at the site. "We expect the free flyer pro
gram to provide a significant advancement in low
cost, rapid access to space."
The STC will make Stanford a more permanent
fixture at the research park, offering educational
programs for both students and industry profession
als looking to sharpen their skills.
Twiggs' 14-unit class will last a year and will be
broken into four segments during which students will
design, construct, test and eventually launch satel

lites. These students some of whom work at Lock
heed Martin and other Silicon Valley companies
will also design their own space missions. Profession
als taking the class will earn a certificate instead of a
degree.
"What we're hopeful will happen is that the more
veteran engineers who are practicing will provide in
sights about the world of work to the younger engi
neers who don't yet have that experience," Andy Di-
Paolo, executive director of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development, told the Stanford News
Service. "So it will strengthen the academic exercise
on campus as well."
According to Twiggs, research conducted at the
STC will focus on the development of small satellites,
Antarctic instrumentation and factors associated
with space reentry.
"Our objective is to have collaborative projects
with many schools on space related projects such as
balloon flights, rocket launches and earth-orbiting
small satellites," Twiggs said, adding that 22 stu
dents, mostly from Lockheed Martin and Ames, are
already working at the site.
Brian Cantwell, chair of Stanford's Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department, said he believes

Twiggs' class is important since many professional
engineers never have the opportunity to see a project
all the way through the development process.
"The idea behind Bob's course is that the stu
dents come in and they do an entire project from con
ception to completion that is, from the defining of
requirements to the designing of equipment to build
ing to testing to flight —in less than a year,"
Cantwell told the Stanford News Service.
Companies support the effort to train profession
als currently working in the field in order to keep up
with emerging technology.
Students at the STC will be exposed to the most
recent knowledge in a variety of related technical
fields.
According to Ames Director G. Scott Hubbard,
"This work in education and research and develop
ment in space technology is exactly the kind of thing
that we need to do as a community here in Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area in order to take advantage
of our premier education institutions, of our incredi
bly talented workforce, of our young folks who are so
interested in robotics, so interested in information
technology and the communities that we have here
of our industrial partners."

bring students and faculty from Stanford and other
local universities together to develop new innova
tions and research opportunities.
In combining the knowledge of academics and in
dustry professionals, NASA aims to advance space
exploration, specifically in the area of robotics. Stan
ford will join forces with Santa Clara University, San
Jose State University, Utah State Universities and
Los Angeles-based Aerospace Corp. A NASA rep
resentative said they hope the research produced by
the STC will help to power the economy and facili
tate technology transfer, making cutting-edge dis
coveries more widely available to companies who
can apply them.
The center's site, located near Hangar One of the
Moffett Federal Airfield, includes classroom, labo
ratory and office space.
Education in space technology and industry is the
top priority for NASA and faculty members working
at the site. According to NASA officials, the new
centers will also focus on expanding knowledge in
areas of biotechnology, energy development, wire
less communication and information exchange.
This is not the first time Stanford has worked with
NASA or Ames.
Approximately 100 Stanford doctoral students
in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronau
tics have had the opportunity to be advised by
NASA Ames researchers since 1980. Students in
the University's mechanical engineering programs
have also benefited from advising relationships
with Ames professionals.
"Through past collaboration we are now helping
advance a concept of free flyers that NASA will be
using to do new space experiments due to limited ac
cess to the shuttle and the space station," said Aero
nautics and Astronautics Prof. Robert Twiggs, who
will be teaching "Spacecraft Design" for graduate
students at the site. "We expect the free flyer pro
gram to provide a significant advancement in low
cost, rapid access to space."
The STC will make Stanford a more permanent
fixture at the research park, offering educational
programs for both students and industry profession
als looking to sharpen their skills.
Twiggs' 14-unit class will last a year and will be
broken into four segments during which students will
design, construct, test and eventually launch satel

lites. These students some of whom work at Lock
heed Martin and other Silicon Valley companies
will also design their own space missions. Profession
als taking the class will earn a certificate instead of a
degree.
"What we're hopeful will happen is that the more
veteran engineers who are practicing will provide in
sights about the world of work to the younger engi
neers who don't yet have that experience," Andy Di-
Paolo, executive director of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development, told the Stanford News
Service. "So it will strengthen the academic exercise
on campus as well."
According to Twiggs, research conducted at the
STC will focus on the development of small satellites,
Antarctic instrumentation and factors associated
with space reentry.
"Our objective is to have collaborative projects
with many schools on space related projects such as
balloon flights, rocket launches and earth-orbiting
small satellites," Twiggs said, adding that 22 stu
dents, mostly from Lockheed Martin and Ames, are
already working at the site.
Brian Cantwell, chair of Stanford's Aeronautics
and Astronautics Department, said he believes

Twiggs' class is important since many professional
engineers never have the opportunity to see a project
all the way through the development process.
"The idea behind Bob's course is that the stu
dents come in and they do an entire project from con
ception to completion that is, from the defining of
requirements to the designing of equipment to build
ing to testing to flight —in less than a year,"
Cantwell told the Stanford News Service.
Companies support the effort to train profession
als currently working in the field in order to keep up
with emerging technology.
Students at the STC will be exposed to the most
recent knowledge in a variety of related technical
fields.
According to Ames Director G. Scott Hubbard,
"This work in education and research and develop
ment in space technology is exactly the kind of thing
that we need to do as a community here in Silicon
Valley and the Bay Area in order to take advantage
of our premier education institutions, of our incredi
bly talented workforce, of our young folks who are so
interested in robotics, so interested in information
technology and the communities that we have here
of our industrial partners."
