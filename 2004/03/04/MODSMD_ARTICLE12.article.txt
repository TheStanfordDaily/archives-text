# Underground Reading Series launched

### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
The English Department's Cre
ative Writing Program launched its
Underground Reading Series last
night with local writers Michelle
Tea, who read from her forthcoming
book "Rent Girl," and Stephen El
liott, who read from his new novel
"Happy Baby."
"The Creative Writing Program
at Stanford absolutely recognizes
that writing has a future as well as a
past or a present," said Prof. Eavan
Boland, the program's director. "We
want to pay tribute to young, excit
ing writers and writing. We want to
recognize the achievement of to
morrow that's what this is all
about."

According to Elliott, the series'
organizer, the program hopes to rec
ognize and support talented authors
who are not well-connected to the
academic and literary circles that
often provide financial backing for
writers.
"We really want to bring in local
talent from outside the network,"
Elliott said.
He cited Tea as a perfect example
of a writer who has not found the
support she deserves.
"Michelle Tea has written three
amazing books, but she still bar
tends, because she's not plugged in,"
he said. "To pay her $750 for this
reading isn't much money for the de
partment, but it's a total bonanza for
her, it's like two months' worth of
rent... Her novel 'Valencia' out

sells most books produced by writers
in [Stanford's Wallace] Stegner Pro
gram. She's changing the face of lit
erature, especially gay and lesbian
literature."
Elliott, who is Stanford's Marsh
McCall Lecturer for Creative Writ
ing, said that he wants the Under
ground Reading Series to feature
writers "who are classically under
represented and have a very hard
time writing for a living ... People
who are making art outside of the
system, they have to just keep pro
ducing or they're fucked. Whereas
people who are plugged into acade
mia, they can take a break from
writing, do some teaching or go on
sabbatical.
"I'm not saying that the people
who have plugged into the system

don't deserve their success, because
they do, but there certain other peo
ple who deserve it just as much but
they can't plug in."
Due to Elliott's current commit
ment to writing a book about this
year's presidential election and cam
paigns, last night's event will be the
last reading during this academic
year.
However, Elliot said that he in
tends to hold two Underground
Readings next year, with Craig
Clevinger, Neal Pollack and Lydia
Lunch as potential participants.
He added, "We really want to
get writers who appeal to under
grads, so we might form an under
graduate committee to help select
the writers who are going to fill
these four slots."
