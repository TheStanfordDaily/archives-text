# New probation policy is helpful
## 
### 
The Undergraduate Advising Center
(UAC) recently announced a change in its
academic probation policy. Students are
now required to meet regularly with an ad
visor as soon as they are placed on probation; previ
ously, students were not assigned to one of the cen
ter's advisors until they were placed on provisional
registration, which is a more severe academic pun
ishment. We commend the UAC for adopting a
more proactive approach in helping students who
are struggling academically.
Stanford is certainly a challenging school, and the
workload can easily become overwhelming. Many
new students, though qualified to be here, are some
what unprepared for the rigors of the University's
academics. Additionally, Stanford students tend to
be classic overachievers who get involved in multiple
extracurricular activities and causes conveniently
forgetting about their academic obligations until
panic mode sets in during midterm or finals time and
they are already far behind.
While Stanford's advising program seeks to catch
these problems before they become overwhelming,
it is far from perfect. The fact that many students still
find themselves academically struggling over long
periods of time indicates that this is rightfully a rea
son for concern and for additional efforts on the part
of the University. The University owes it to both its
students and itself to ensure students are in good
academic standing defined by the University as
having a GPA of 2.0 or higher, completing 36 units

in the past three quarters and completing at least
nine units during the most recent quarter. Students
in good academic standing reflect better on the Uni
versity, because they are more likely to graduate on
time and are less likely to be kicked out, both of
which positively affect Stanford's retention rate.
More importantly, however, having students in good
academic standing means that the University is
doing its job of fostering learning. With tuition as
high as it is, Stanford must help its students as much
as possible in their educational pursuits. Each Stan
ford student deserves as many chances as the Uni
versity can offer. Finally, students who are doing
well in their classes contribute much to the Univer
sity's intellectual life and are often happier, less
stressed people in general.
In an interview with The Daily last month, As
sociate Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Carol Porter said, "Students often struggle
with these issues: [they are] reluctant to confide in
anyone, and unaware of the many resources avail
able to help them when facing financial, emotional
and emergency situations that affect their academ
ic performance."
Providing these students with an advisor as soon
as they are placed on probation should alleviate
some of these stressors. Despite various budget cuts
this year, we appreciate that the University recog
nizes academic probation as an important campus
issue deserving of financial support in the form of
more advising.
