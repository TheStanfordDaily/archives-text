## THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT Procrastination as social protest 
### 
There are 15 days until the end
of the quarter, which means
that before we can enjoy
Spring Break and its bounty
of friends, family and quality beach
time, we must first go through that hell
known as Dead Week.
At other schools, the period be
fore final exams is usually called
"reading week" other schools'
professors seem to be aware of the
fact that very few students even think
about starting their reading before
the end of the term. But here, a week
of no classes, commitments or assign
ments is a luxury that we simply don't
have. Why even call it Dead Week if
it is exactly the same as weeks one
through nine?
By the last week of the quarter, we
are all entirely too burned out from
midterms, papers and weekly social
drama to pull all-night study sessions.
As much as I told myself to stay awake
and catch up on some research last
night, I was asleep by 1 a.m. without
having made any significant progress.
Don't get me wrong, I was at my com
puter for a good five hours I just
wasn't being productive.
First I signed on to AOL Instant
Messenger to read everyone's away
messages and profiles, because that is
my way of keeping up with friends these
days. As usual, my best friend's away
message was a tribute to "Sex and the
City," so I went to Amazon.com to see if
season five was on sale. Since it was, I
bought it. Shopping always makes me

hungry, and so I decided to go to my
kitchen and eat some frozen cookie
dough. While eating I sat on the couch,

found the remote
and could not resist
turning on the TV.
Coincidentally
back-to-back
episodes of "The
Cosby Show" were
on and let's be
honest, who passes
up "The Cosby
Show"? An hour
later, I made it back
to my computer, re

turned to AIM and started the whole
chain of procrastination over again. Like
I said, I got no work done, but that's OK
because when it comes to procrastina
tion, I know that "everybody's doing it."
As students, procrastination is our
only way of protesting against all of
the absurd amounts of work that we
have to do. It is our right, and I for one
am going to take full advantage of it.
Just like 19th-century railroad work
ers rebelled against their managers by
uniformly slowing down construction,
we too can slow down our own per
sonal production by indulging in on
line shopping, frequent snack breaks
and extended visits to hallmates. By
mocking efficiency and filling our
ideal work time with the most creative
forms of procrastination, we are tak
ing a stand for what is truly important
in life self-indulgence.
Next to Web-browsing and IM

chatting, my favorite procrastination
activity is definitely playing "Snood."
My roommate and I not only have
contests about who can get the highest
score, but also about who spends the
most time playing in general I usu
ally win both. The greatest thing
about the game is that it allows for
multi-tasking, so that between levels,
I can check my e-mail and download
music, increasing my non-school
work-related productivity.
See, I'm really not a lazy person. I
dedicate hours to valuable activities
like reading the newspaper, having cof
fee with my best girls and playing
Scrabble with my boyfriend. I just don't
see why I should be wasting the best
years of my life scrunched up on a dingy
chair in Green Library after midnight,
trying to read the last sentence of the
appendix in every one of my books for
every one of my classes.
In the end, I know that all of my
work will get done by the time my dead
lines roll around and probably with
some time to spare. So why shouldn't I
try to squeeze out every moment be
tween now and then? The truth is that
computer games have to be played, e
mail has to be read and cookie dough
has to be eaten just as much as history
papers have to be written, so why waste
time feeling guilty about wasting time
I can do that tomorrow.
