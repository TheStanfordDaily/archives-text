## 'Razzies' reward really rotten releases 
### 
Ah, the Oscars. That magical
time of year when a billion
people across the globe
tune in and watch a bunch
of beautiful people they'll never meet
give each other little gold statues. Hon
estly, this entire ordeal couldn't be
more of a self-congratulatory love-fest
if they changed the name to "Gor
geous People That Are Better Than
You" and gave each other platinum
tiaras. Needless to say, I didn't miss a
moment of it. I'd like to say that I only
watched out of a morbid fascination,
like witnessing a train wreck on an
enormous scale, but I'd be lying if I
didn't admit I also really wanted to
know who won the stupid things. (Hint
"The Lord of the Rings.") I can
safely tell you, however, that not
changing the channel during Sting's
heart-wrenching performance on the
hurdy-gurdy was purely visceral.
Nonetheless, even despite such bril
liant moments of unintentional come
dy, there is something fundamentally
unsatisfactory about these kinds of
award shows for a cynic like myself. Ev
eryone is just too damn happy with each
other even the losers are exceeding
ly gracious. Is it just me, or could Bill
Murray have made the whole night in
finitely better by standing up after losing
and saying "Sean Penn? I just lost to
Sean Penn? I was a comic legend while
that idiot was still dating Madonna and

punching paparazzi. Sean Freaking
Penn." OK, it's probably just me. Re
gardless, I still feel like there's some
thing missing, and apparently I'm not

the only one. So,
without further
ado, I'd like to in
troduce all of you
to an award show
after my own heart
the "Razzies."
Question:
What kind of
award show gives
out over 50 percent
of its prizes to the

epic Bennifer disaster "Gigli," and
touts Sylvester Stallone as its all-time
winningest recipient (thirty nomina
tions, ten victories)? Answer: Not a
very nice one. Held annually twenty
four hours before the Oscars, the Gold
en Raspberry Awards ("Razzies") are
reserved for the worst of the worst, the
poorest of the poor, the, well, the
Sylvester Stallones of the acting world.
Among this year's recipients were Ben
and J-Lo, winners of the Worst Actor
and Worst Actress awards, respective
ly, as well as combining for the Worst
Screen Couple honor. Their joint ef
fort, "Gigli," was also "honored," re
ceiving nods for Worst Screenplay,
Worst Director and Worst Picture.
Sylvester Stallone, a perennial favorite,
was not overlooked in the Worst Sup

porting Actor category for his especial
ly horrendous performance in "Spy
Kids 3-D" (and if there's anything
worse than having to watch Sly "act,"
it's having to watch him act in three di
mensions). The golf-ball sized, spray
painted raspberry will doubtlessly
share space on his mantle with his pre
vious Razzie victories, awarded for
screen gems such as "Stop or My Mom
Will Shoot" and "Rambo: First Blood
II" not to mention the much-covet
ed Worst Actor of the Century title.
Surprisingly, no nominees were
present at the awards ceremony, held
in the penthouse suite of the Santa
Monica Sheraton. Ben and Jennifer
reportedly planned initially on attend
ing, but canceled at the last minute to
accommodate a top-secret wedding
(which was subsequently canceled,
un-canceled and then postponed in
definitely). Stallone was unavailable
for comment, as he is currently on the
set of his new movie "Rocky 9 4-D:
Adrian's Revenge," which will be on
the back shelf of a video store near you
later this fall.

Ben Daniel is a sophomore majoring in
mathematics who has already reserved
an advance copy of "Rocky 9." If your
idea of a romantic evening is cuddling
up on a futon with a columnist and a
four-dimensional Sylvester Stallone, e
mail him at bmdaniel@stanford.edu.

II" not to mention the much-covet
ed Worst Actor of the Century title.
Surprisingly, no nominees were
present at the awards ceremony, held
in the penthouse suite of the Santa
Monica Sheraton. Ben and Jennifer
reportedly planned initially on attend
ing, but canceled at the last minute to
accommodate a top-secret wedding
(which was subsequently canceled,
un-canceled and then postponed in

for comment, as he is currently on the
set of his new movie "Rocky 9 4-D:
Adrian's Revenge," which will be on
the back shelf of a video store near you
later this fall.

Ben Daniel is a sophomore majoring in
mathematics who has already reserved
an advance copy of "Rocky 9." If your
idea of a romantic evening is cuddling
up on a futon with a columnist and a
four-dimensional Sylvester Stallone, e
