Digital ballots compromise democracy
Like many, (too few, unfortunately)
I went to flex my democratic muscle in
the ballot box on Tuesday. I am a regis
tered Green Party member, an artifact
from my misguided Nader support in
2000.1 was told, however, by numerous
people and authorities that despite my
party affiliation, I could vote for the
Democratic Primary candidate.
I went into the gym at Escondido
School expecting to feel refreshed by
exercising my freedom of choice, but
ended up with a foul taste in my mouth.
I picked up my digital ballot card and
popped it into the voting machine. (The
whole ritual is absurdly reminiscent of
getting money out of an ATM.)
To my horror, only the knuckle
heads from the Green Party came on
screen. "I was told I could vote in the
Democratic Primary," I said, to which
the voting booth volunteers replied,
"Oh, we have to key that into your card
before it gets inserted into the ma
chine." Translation: "You're screwed."
I moaned and groaned at them for an
other ten minutes, but to no avail. "If
we still had the paper ballots, I could
just void your ballot and give you the
right one," said one older gentleman
proctor. "But with these new machines,
there's nothing I can do."
Devastating. I ended up writing-in,
(or rather, touch-typing in) the name of
John Kerry. As the Green Party candi
date? What atravesty. Granted, I should
have changed my party affiliation to
match my politics beforehand, but the
current voting technology is, I suggest,
deeply flawed. If I was cheated and mis
informed, it will happen to others.
(Florida, anyone?) The voting protocol
ought to reflect maximum freedom of

choice, rather than glitchy, "you're-too
late" treatment. I am one Green-cum-
Democrat who refuses to let HAL 9000
deny me my suffrage. Come Election
Day, I will be a registered Democrat.
Maybe I'll even bring my resident com
puter coordinator along in case another
snafu like this happens.

Dukies challenge Cardinal
to bring it on
As Dukies, we feel that next time
you want to write a column that men
tions us, ("Rooting for the Dukies?
Madness!" Mar. 3) you do some re
search first. The sentence that strikes us
the most reads, "Actually, Duke is
worse [than the Yankees] in that Yan
kee fans typically have a solid under
standing of baseball, while the
Cameron Crazies are usually nerds
with no athletic background who have
decided to go watch basketball because
it's the cool thing to do."
If you look at "The Princeton Re
view's" list of the top 20 "jock schools,"
you will see Duke sitting at number
eight. If you talk to the majority of stu
dents here at Duke, they will tell you
that they played a sport at one point
during high school. And Cameron Cra
zies know basketball. Why would
someone who doesn't understand the
sport sleep in a tent outside in the cold
for months just to see a game?
As for columnist Dan McCarthy's
derision of Duke being deemed "the
Harvard of the South," we'd like to
point out that Stanford seems to be
quite proud of its title as "the Harvard
of the West." So just remember one

thing ranked higher doesn't mean
better basketball team. Come play
Duke at Cameron Indoor Stadium, and
then we'll talk. See you in San Antonio.

Stanford Dining prices not so bad
when compared to housing, tuition
It seems that there's been much talk
lately in various editorials in The Daily
about the "outrageously overpriced"
nature of the Stanford meal plan. Hav
ing worked as a student at Stanford
Dining for the past two and a half years,
perhaps I'm a bit biased, but I certainly
do not sign on to that position.
I would like to challenge The Stan
ford Daily to enact a study of assorted
student-living costs at Stanford in order
to ascertain how the cost of a meal plan
stacks up against other aspects of stu
dent life. I would love to see a study il
lustrating how the price of a meal plan
has risen in the past ten years in com
parison to average dorm housing costs,
tuition and the cost-of-living in the Bay
Area. If memory serves me correctly,
housing costs have risen at least twice as
fast as a typical meal plan has during my
past four years at Stanford. I would not
be surprised to hear that tuition has also
risen faster than meal plan costs.
As astronomical as most students
would like to think their meal plans
are, I believe there are other, more
costly aspects of life on the Farm that
would be more worthwhile topics of
student gripe-fests.
