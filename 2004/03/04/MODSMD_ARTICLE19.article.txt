## Life lessons learned from Nintendo 
### 
All we really need to know we learned
in Kindergarten. Yeah I ripped off
the title of that book, but it's true.
That's because all any of us really
need to know are the lessons of sport, and by
age five we were already well trained in the
trade. My dad was a scientist, my ma an artist,
but my brother and I were pros at every athlet
ic endeavor in existence. Shooting, you bet.
Boxing, yep. Hockey, for sure. Racing,
mmhmm. Basketball, you know it.
They say if you're gonna learn it you need to
learn it young. Well the best educational tool
my parents ever bought us wasn't the junior
electricity science kits we'd run around shock
ing each other with. No. It the best learning tool
anyone ever had growing up the Nintendo
Entertainment System.
One of my old friends came to America as a
thirteen-year old after growing up in South
Korea. Besides going to school

for 12 hours per day as a mid
dle-schooler, sports were the
biggest part of his life. But he
only read about them. All the
students did. He was tested on
sports, in school. When he came
to America he had never actu
ally played a single sport in his
life. He hadn't even pushed a
wooden hoop down a dirt road
with a stick. But he had every

rulebook and had read every sports textbook
yes sports textbook and had been tested, ac
tually tested in school on scenarios such as what
part of the field is easiest to hit a home run to, and
what type of dunk involved a full turn before the
slam. His study guide in the one-hour a day he
wasn't sleeping, eating or studying? The same
guide we all used, the original NES.
For years global youth and ambitious par
ents allowed the Nintendo 8-BIT system to
teach them the ways of sport. Not just the terms
"home run" and "touchdown" but the subtle
lessons of sport, the ones we realized we picked
up only years later in moments of throwback
nostalgia.

The first thing we ever learned to do with
Nintendo as calcium deficient weaklings was
shoot. Michael Moore in "Bowling for
Columbine" can't stop asking what's the root of
America's gun problems. Well, in his never end
ing quest to verbally shred NRA president
Charlton Heston he must have forgotten the
first advanced video game he ever played was
Duck Hunt.

In my inability to separate the virtual realm
from reality, I used to unplug the gun from the
console and run around the yard sniping local
fowl. I knew I needed to reload after five shots,
and I let my parents know in many a Christmas
List the best shooters needed a doggie compan
ion to help them in their athletic achievements.
I have been searching for a loyal pooch pal ever
since.

Olympic Track and Field, I had that game too,
complete with the power pad you ran on to make
the guy on the screen run. This game had it all
over the imitation Powerpad style of the techno
funk Dance Dance Revolution. On that Power
pad we learned to pump the legs, drive the knees,
hurdle like morons in our living rooms, and cele
brate an Olympic medal in style. For 30 minutes.
In my case at least, the best lesson that game
taught me was not to invest in cheap technological
crap. Four games of sprinting by a fifty pounder in
slip-on Keds and I'd already crushed the circuits
inside that feeble running mat. My Olympic career
was over, once that Powerpad became a slip-and
slide that in the backyard that summer and I had
learned the importance of innovation I sure be
came one running-j umping-sliding fool.
Baseball Stars. Taught me everything I know.
Want to hit homeruns? Pick the team of behe
moths and keep swinging until you connect.
Needless to say my tee-ball career, blocked out
from memory by the helmet five sizes too big for
my head, left most parents checking their watch
es with each additional swing and a miss. And
how about the all-girls team I'd make my friends
play as so I could hit them and watch as the girls
fell to the ground and cried? That lesson single
handedly kept me out of Principal Murphy's of
fice so regularly I cannot thank Nintendo enough.
Recess was a recurrent tale of fresh picked Con
cord grapes in hand and one Becky in a new dress
nearby and me seeing myself launch handfuls at
her in good-natured humor only to see her fall
down and cry and then see my tush catch a few
firm southpaws when I got home from school.
Baseball Stars, you're my saving grace.
You name it, each one of these sports games
taught us more than we give credit. Don't tell me
Mike Metzger and Dave Mirra didn't grow up
playing Excite Bike, Baby Lebron and Carmelo
didn't grow up on the dunk and three point con
tests in Bird vs. Jordan, and don't tell me Lance
Armstrong didn't train in his downtime by dodg
ing firehydrants playing Paper√üoy.
Sure the football games today are better than
watching the NFL, and sure in MLB 2004 you
can swing with medium power to the opposite
field or slide into third headfirst with one arm,
basically do anything short of actually play the
game. But don't tell me eight button controllers
and infinite game options have added to these
games. All we ever really needed was an A and B
button, four arrow keys, and an 8 BIT console.
