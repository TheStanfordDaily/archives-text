Finishing the season 14-4 in Pacific-10 Conference play, the No. 12
Stanford women's basketball team earned the top seed in this weekend's
Pac-10 Tournament in San Jose. Splitting last weekend 1-1 with a 66-67
loss to Oregon (14-14,6-12 conference) and 67-66 win over Oregon State
(14-13, 8-10), the Cardinal won the tournament top-seed tiebreaker
against Arizona (22-7,14-4), the co-champion of the Pac-10.
This year marked Arizona's first Pac-10 Championship title for
women's basketball, while Stanford earned its fourth straight. Regardless
of conference standings, the winner of the Pac-10 Tournament earns an
automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament later this month.
"We're very excited about the tournament," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We're happy and relieved that we won the regular
season, and we really need to take this week to work hard and come out
and play well this weekend. It's different in a tournament and we know
this determines the NCAA automatic bid."
The Cardinal will play its first game of the tournament this Saturday at
5 p.m. against the winner of eighth-seed Oregon versus ninth-seed Cali
fornia game. Having just lost to Oregon on the road, Stanford will have
plenty to prove if it faces the Ducks in its first game of the tournament.
"If we play Oregon, trust me, our team has not forgotten last week
end," VanDerveer said.
The winner of the Oregon / California game is far from determined.
Both teams have shown that they are capable of playing great basketball,
and their conference rankings belie their potential.
VanDerveer repeatedly emphasized the necessity of a healthy and
hungry team, a team that is excited about the game. Most of the injuries

have been concentrated in the post junior forwards Azella Perryman
and T'Nae Thiel, along with senior center Chelsea Trotter and freshman
center Kristen Newlin have all missed significant time.
"I am thankful to actually be able to play again this season since I know
my injury could have been a lot worse," Newlin said "I know it's a bit cliche,
but it's true that you don't realize what you have until it's gone. It was hard
sitting out of the games, but it made playing again even sweeter."
Senior forward Nicole Powell the Cardinal's leading scorer and re
bounder with 20.1 ppg and 11.4 rpg characterized the team as upbeat
and focused on the task ahead.
VanDerveer praised Powell as the most versatile player she has ever
coached.
"She can make a lot happen ... The numbers speak for themselves.
There've been 13 triple-doubles in the Pac-10 and Nicole's had 6 of
them," she said.
She also said that Powell was critical in advancing Stanford through
the post-season, and suggested that Powell might see less playing time to
conserve her energy and minimize the beatings she takes every time she
steps onto the court.
"In order for out team to even go to the next level, we need more from
Nicole," VanDerveer said. "I also think we need to play her less. She logs
major minutes and gets a body on her every time down the court."
She also said that Powell had a tendency to take too much on herself,
describing her as "carrying the basketball world on her shoulders."
Powell said she didn't feel any additional pressure going into this
weekend's tournament.

Freshman forward Kristen Newlin and the women's basketball team will
be the favorites heading into this weekend's Pac-10 Tournament.
"I haven't felt any more pressure
than normal," she said. "Right now
I'm just concentrating on this week
end's games and am focused on
whoever we play Saturday."
Newlin also stressed the
team's focus going into the Pac
-10 Tournament.
"We are doing everything we
can to win the Pac-10 Champi
onship this weekend. We're fo
cused and practicing hard," Newlin
said. "We know it won't be easy,
but if we play like we're capable of
we will do very well."
With a talented roster and a
strong work ethic, the Stanford
women at their best could dominate
the Pac-10 as much as the men have.

Unfortunately, the team has been
inconsistent to date.
VanDerveer noted Stanford's
improvement in taking care of the
ball. The Cardinal had a combined
14 turnovers in its last two games,
while it often approaches 20 in a sin
gle game. She would like the team
to be more physical and take more
shots close to the basket.
"We're not as aggressive as we
need to be to give ourselves the best
chance at high percentage shots,"
VanDerveer said.
She sounded optimistic about
the team's potential, and said the
Cardinal is always trying to fig
ure out the best combinations of
its players.
A strong showing at the Pac-10
Tournament might not mean much
national prestige for the Card, but a
weak performance will send a mes
sage to the NCAA committee and
could make Stanford's progress
through the NCAA Tournament

considerably harder.
"I think it's a good presumption
[that we're in NCAAs]," Van-
Derveer said. "I think we can hurt it
more than we can help it."
Roughly half of the Pac-10 has a
shot at making it to the Big Dance.
Stanford and, which has been
ranked in the top ten for most of the
season, and Arizona are almost as
sured a spot somewhere in the tour
nament. Arizona State, Southern
California and UCLA need a strong
Pac-10 Tournament finish if they
hope to remain in the running.
With so many recent shake
ups in the Pac-10, each team has a
shot at making the champi
onship, though the Cardinal is
still the favorite.
The Cardinal squad seems excit
ed, but resolute, going into this
weekend.
"If people aren't excited about
the tournament, they should take
up tennis," VanDerveer said.
