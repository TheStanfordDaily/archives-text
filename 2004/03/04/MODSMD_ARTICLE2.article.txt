Finishing the season 14-4 in Pacific-10 Conference play, the No. 12
Stanford women's basketball team earned the top seed in this weekend's
Pac-10 Tournament in San Jose. Splitting last weekend 1-1 with a 66-67
loss to Oregon (14-14,6-12 conference) and 67-66 win over Oregon State
(14-13, 8-10), the Cardinal won the tournament top-seed tiebreaker
against Arizona (22-7,14-4), the co-champion of the Pac-10.
This year marked Arizona's first Pac-10 Championship title for
women's basketball, while Stanford earned its fourth straight. Regardless
of conference standings, the winner of the Pac-10 Tournament earns an
automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament later this month.
"We're very excited about the tournament," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "We're happy and relieved that we won the regular
season, and we really need to take this week to work hard and come out
and play well this weekend. It's different in a tournament and we know
this determines the NCAA automatic bid."
The Cardinal will play its first game of the tournament this Saturday at
5 p.m. against the winner of eighth-seed Oregon versus ninth-seed Cali
fornia game. Having just lost to Oregon on the road, Stanford will have
plenty to prove if it faces the Ducks in its first game of the tournament.
"If we play Oregon, trust me, our team has not forgotten last week
end," VanDerveer said.
The winner of the Oregon / California game is far from determined.
Both teams have shown that they are capable of playing great basketball,
and their conference rankings belie their potential.
VanDerveer repeatedly emphasized the necessity of a healthy and
hungry team, a team that is excited about the game. Most of the injuries

have been concentrated in the post junior forwards Azella Perryman
and T'Nae Thiel, along with senior center Chelsea Trotter and freshman
center Kristen Newlin have all missed significant time.
"I am thankful to actually be able to play again this season since I know
my injury could have been a lot worse," Newlin said "I know it's a bit cliche,
but it's true that you don't realize what you have until it's gone. It was hard
sitting out of the games, but it made playing again even sweeter."
Senior forward Nicole Powell the Cardinal's leading scorer and re
bounder with 20.1 ppg and 11.4 rpg characterized the team as upbeat
and focused on the task ahead.
VanDerveer praised Powell as the most versatile player she has ever
coached.
"She can make a lot happen ... The numbers speak for themselves.
There've been 13 triple-doubles in the Pac-10 and Nicole's had 6 of
them," she said.
She also said that Powell was critical in advancing Stanford through
the post-season, and suggested that Powell might see less playing time to
conserve her energy and minimize the beatings she takes every time she
steps onto the court.
"In order for out team to even go to the next level, we need more from
Nicole," VanDerveer said. "I also think we need to play her less. She logs
major minutes and gets a body on her every time down the court."
She also said that Powell had a tendency to take too much on herself,
describing her as "carrying the basketball world on her shoulders."
Powell said she didn't feel any additional pressure going into this
weekend's tournament.
