### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
On a baseball team that includes four All-Americans, lefthanded pitcher Blake Holler
is the quintessential All-American boy. Holler, a freshman, was raised in Terra Haute, In
diana, and is one of four kids, all boys, all of whom play sports. He speaks with a Mid
western twang that he insists is not an accent and you can just picture him shrugging and
flashing his million-dollar smile whenever he gets into a sticky situation (his dad, Jess, is a
dentist).
In his free time, Holler studies geography. He could tell you the population and most
of the suburbs of any major city. In all seriousness, he probably knows the place you grew
up better than you do.
"Playing for summer baseball teams, I did a lot of traveling on the road," Holler said.
"I wanted to know where we were going and how we were getting there."
After his first career start at Stanford, he told his mom that he loved her in the post
game interview.
"It made her cry," Holler said.
There's no doubt that Holler is a gem off the field, but on it, he's just hell to face.
You want stuff? He's got it. A fastball that has topped out at ninety-two miles per hour
and tails away from righthanded batters. A changeup that drops right before it reaches the
plate. And a curveball that's just plain nasty.
"He's the prototypical lefty," sophomore pitcher Jeff Gilmore said. "He has great
movement, and his ball is hard to pick up and hard to hit. The thing that sets him apart is
he has a really explosive finish that makes him very difficult to hit."
You want control? He threw ten strikes and only one ball in the first inning against Cal
last weekend, and two-thirds of his pitches in his entire outing went for strikes.
You want poise? If you had stopped by the Stanford bullpen just fifteen minutes before
his start last Sunday, you would have found Holler listening to music and poring over his
atlas, a pre-game ritual. If the kid was any cooler, he'd be Encino man.
The only thing Holler doesn't have is experience, but that is coming quickly. The first
start of his career came in the rubber match of a series two weekends ago against then-No.
6 Texas. Holler responded by striking out five and allowing only one run on three hits in
six innings to give the Cardinal a win that vaulted it into the top spot in the Baseball Amer
ica poll.
Last week, he had an even more impressive performance against Cal, allowing just one
run in seven innings. It was an economical outing Holler threw only 85 pitches, and
after a first-inning home run, no Cal runner got as far as third base. Only one even reached
second.
He owns a 1.89 ERA in 19 innings pitched this year, to go with 15 strikeouts. He has
given up one run in each of his four appearances, and has two wins and two saves.
It's safe to say that, for now at least, the tall, lanky kid from Terra Haute has earned
himself a starting spot. In fact, you can't really call the 6'4" Holler who came to school
this fall weighing a mere 152 pounds lanky anymore. Hoping to add velocity to his fast
ball, he has packed on 22 pounds to his once-spindly frame, thanks to a steady diet of dou
ble and triple cheeseburgers.
"The obvious goal of all pitchers on our staff is to be a starter," Holler said. "Since I've
been given that opportunity, I'm just going to try to go out and do my best every chance I
get."
Though Holler's unexpected impact on the rotation has drawn comparisons to that of
sophomore Mark Romanczuk another lefty who moved into the rotation during his
freshman year and went on to win 12 games there is no road map to where Holler is
headed. At this point, no one knows how high his ceiling is.
Holler may not know where he is going, but wherever it is, all early indications are that
he has a pretty good idea of how to get there.

It's safe to say that, for now at least, the tall, lanky kid from Terra Haute has earned
himself a starting spot. In fact, you can't really call the 6'4" Holler who came to school
this fall weighing a mere 152 pounds lanky anymore. Hoping to add velocity to his fast
ball, he has packed on 22 pounds to his once-spindly frame, thanks to a steady diet of dou
ble and triple cheeseburgers.
"The obvious goal of all pitchers on our staff is to be a starter," Holler said. "Since I've
been given that opportunity, I'm just going to try to go out and do my best every chance I
get."
Though Holler's unexpected impact on the rotation has drawn comparisons to that of
sophomore Mark Romanczuk another lefty who moved into the rotation during his
freshman year and went on to win 12 games there is no road map to where Holler is
headed. At this point, no one knows how high his ceiling is.
Holler may not know where he is going, but wherever it is, all early indications are that
he has a pretty good idea of how to get there.

Freshman pitcher Blake Holler has been absolutely F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S this year on
the mound, with a 1.89 ERA - hip-hopping his way to two wins and two saves.
