### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's tennis team will close out the quarter
with an appearance at the 115 th Pacific Coast Men's Doubles
Championships in La Jolla, Calif, beginning on Friday. The tourna
ment is host to a large array of doubles teams from around the coun
try and is open to all collegiate and adult players.
"As far as the doubles tournament coming up, we are just going
down there to practice our doubles, to solidify these teams, and [to]
see what we [can] do with other combinations possibly," associate
head coach John Whitlinger said. "But right now these teams
haven't lost a match together so I'm very anxious to see them play
in the tournament format and it'll be good practice for us and a good
time to work on our doubles."
Coming off a four-game winning streak, the Cardinal is looking
to carry their success into the weekend.
"Everybody's getting their confidence back and we look for
ward to the tournament," said sophomore All-American K.C.
Corkery. "It is a little bit relaxing [to play in] but it's also a good time
to work on our doubles which has been going pretty well recently."
Stanford will be sending four doubles teams into the tourna
ment, all of whom are in the main draw. Competition starts tomor
row, but those who are not in the draw will begin competition today.
Corkery and junior Sam Warburg will enter the competition as
the No. 3 seed and have received a first round bye. They will face off
at 9 a.m. against Sean Maymi of Cmc, Fla., and Paul Settles of
Claremont, Calif., in the second round.
Playing at the No. 2 spot for Stanford, the tandem of sophomore
James Pade and freshman James Wan will hit the courts at 11:30
a.m. and go up against junior Matt Coin and freshman Elad Stern of
UCSB.
Also playing a UCSB team will be the No. 3 Cardinal team of se
nior team captain Carter Morris and junior Phil Sheng. They will go
head-to-head with UCSB's No. 2 doubles team of Nicholas Brot
man and Nick Edlefsen.
At the No. 4 spot for the Cardinal, freshmen Eric McKean and
Chris Rasmussen will meet up with Bruce Aiken and Paul Matysek,
who are managers for the USC men's tennis team. McKean and
Rasmussen have a 1-0 record from earlier this year when they
played Hawaii in November.
Last year, Stanford advanced two teams to the round of 16, in
cluding Corkery and Pade. Morris and Warburg were knocked out
of the second round, along with Sheng and senior Joe Kao. Corkery
and Pade were eventually defeated in the semifinals.
If the teams lose in the draw, they will be thrown into the conso
lation rounds.
"It's going to be a really good time. Our doubles combinations,
as we've adjusted them, have worked out really well," said Gould.
"We're looking for a chance to take a break from the dual meets
and just concentrate on our doubles. The combos are pretty new
and it's a perfect time for us to do this. Everyone is assured of at least
two matches, which is good also."
Match play will continue through Sunday if the teams make it
through to the final rounds.
