# Women's hoops faces more physical conference foes
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
in any sport, officials and refer
ees are constantly under fire
from players, coaches, even fans.
And when things get called incon
sistently— well, that's when frus
tration levels reach their highest.
And last year, the No. 12 Stan
ford women's basketball team (21-
6, 14-4 Pacific 10 Conference) en
countered that exact frustration at
exactly the wrong time.
After playing 18 tightly officiat
ed Pac-10 games where ticky-tack
touch fouls were not uncommon,
the Cardinal met an unexpected
change beginning in the Pac-10
Tournament.
"Throughout the Pac-10 things
were called very tight," said Stan
ford head coach Tara VanDerveer.
"And then in the [Pac-10] Tourna
ment and NCAAs, basically noth
ing was called."
VanDerveer was not the only
coach that noticed the change.
During the offseason, when the
coaches met with officials coordi
nator Gooch Foster, a change in the
style of officiating and was dis
cussed, with an emphasis on a more
physical, "just let them play" type
of game.
"Personally, I think the game
should be a finesse game and it

should not be a wrestling match out
there," VanDerveer said. "But for
some reason over the past several
years, in the NCAA Tournament,
the officials have an attitude of 'lt's
the Tournament, so now we let
things go.'"
And although the Pac-10's less
than stellar showings in recent
NCAA Tournaments obviously
cannot be attributed to Pac-10 offi
ciating, last year's regular season
style could not have helped.
However, things have unques
tionably changed this year.
"They've let things go more this
year," VanDerveer said. "There
are times this year when I've
thought 'Well, that's a foul, but ok,
if this is how it's going to be, let's
play through this and adjust to how
it's going to be now instead of play
ing a certain way in December, Jan
uary, February and then March
comes and all of a sudden we're not
ready for it' "
And while the Cardinal has en
dured an increased level of physi
cality throughout the regular sea
son, things are certain to become
even more heated in this weekend's
tournament.
With a first round matchup
scheduled for Saturday against the
winner of Friday's Oregon / Cali
fornia contest, Stanford will face a
physical matchup on Saturday re

gardless of the outcome.
The benefits of the officiating
change for the Cardinal begin with
the start of the Pac-10 Tournament.
As the only nationally ranked
team in the conference, Stanford
plays with an enormous bull's eye
on its back in every conference
matchup, and that bull's eye only
grows larger with the start of the
Pac-10 Tourney.
And because of the conference's
relatively weak reputation around
the country, a poor showing this
weekend could spell disaster for
the Cardinal's NCAA Tournament
seeding, while a repeat as Tourna
ment Champs is simply expected.
"[The Pac-10 Tournament] gets
us ready for NCAAs in terms of
how aggressive and physical every
one is," VanDerveer said. "Lately
[the conference] hasn't done as
well as we want to do or as well we
need to do in the NCAAs."
Entering this year's tourna
ment, Stanford knows exactly what
to expect and hopes to take the
court with an intensity and physi
cality seen only at times this season
and the Cardinal will need every
bit of it if the squad hopes to make
it through the grueling three games
in three days schedule and emerge
as Tournament Champions, as well
as gaining some much needed mo
mentum for the NCAAs.
