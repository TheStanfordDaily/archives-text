# Men's golf takes home another top-ten finish
## 
### ZACH JONES STAFF WRITER 
No. 14 Texas was truly the lone star this week at the
Cleveland Golf Collegiate Invitational, cruising to a 15-
stroke victory in the team competition behind individual
medalist Matthew Rosenfeld. The Longhorns emerged
from tough conditions to knock over a talented field, as
three Texas players finished in the top five overall.
Stanford struggled early in driving wind and rain, but
was able to mount a minor charge near the tournament's
close, finishing in a tie for ninth place.
"This was the best ninth-place finish we've had in a
long time," coach Jeff Mitchell said. "It was pretty tough
out there, and I was really happy with the way the guys
hung in there."
The two-day event was hosted by Southern California at
the North Ranch Country Club in Westlake, Calif, and fea
tured a field of 17 teams from across the country. Of those
teams, eight are ranked in the nation's top 25, including No.
3 UCLA, No. 6 Texas Christian and No. 8 Arizona State.
After collecting a pair of top-five finishes earlier in
the season, the Trojans were finally able to step into the
winner's circle at their own event. They also exacted a
measure of revenge on rival UCLA, which claimed indi
vidual and team honors at last year's tournament.
For Stanford, on the other hand, this week's story
was frustratingly familiar. Despite a solid performance
from freshman Zack Miller, who placed ninth individu
ally, the Cardinal was unable to post enough good scores
behind its No. 1 man to place well as a team.
Traditionally, the team has played well in Southern
California, and its fourth-place finish at this event last
spring was Stanford's best performance of the year.
"This is a big tournament for us," Mitchell said, "and
one that has been instrumental to our success the last
couple of years."
This year, however, the Cardinal got off to a sluggish
start, and never recovered. The format of the tourna
ment dictates that teams play 36 of the event's 54 holes
on the first day. This marathon of golf can either allow
players to play their way into a rhythm, or spiral to the
bottom of the scoreboard if things are going poorly.
In Stanford's case, there was no rhythm in sight. In
consistency was the order of the tournament for the Car
dinal, as the team continues to search for an event where

multiple players put together solid performances.
Sophomore Kyle Gentry and freshman Brandon
Lawson were a study in contrasts on Monday. Gentry
began the tournament in brilliant fashion, going 3-
under-par in his first five holes. He made just one bogey
after that, and his 2-under-par round of 69 placed him in
third overall after the first 18 holes.
His second round started similarly, with an early pair
of birdies, but quickly fell apart with a triple-bogey dis
aster and a double-bogey later. Gentry carded a dismal
78 in his second round and fell to a tie for 37th place.
Lawson, on the other hand, struggled out of the gate,
recording a 5-over-par 76 in his opening round. He re
bounded in the afternoon, however. In a roller-coaster
18 holes that included five birdies, four bogeys and a
double-bogey, Lawson held on in the pouring rain and
posted a solid 72. Despite a rugged start, he finished the
day just a stroke back of Gentry.
"I'm used to playing in bad conditions, being from
Illinois," Lawson said. "I just tried to stay tough and not
get down on myself."
Meanwhile, Miller led the team with his steady play,
working his way into the top 25 with rounds of 72 and 73.
At the other end of the scoring spectrum were senior
Blake Mastalir and junior Kevin Blue. Rounds of 80 and
76 dropped Mastalir down to a tie for 80th place overall
Monday night. Blue, the only member of this year's
starting five to play in the Cleveland last year, looked
lost on Monday, shooting 77 and 81 while recording 10
bogeys in his afternoon round.
Sadly, a strong performance in the tournament's final
round on Tuesday only served to hint at what might have
been for the Cardinal. Miller led the way with a 70 and his
strong final round locked up a third consecutive top-10.
"I've been playing really well lately," Miller said.
"The more I play a course, the better informed I am
about how to play it and where to hit the ball."
Gentry shot 71, to move up to 22nd place and claim his
second top-25 finish of the year. With a 73, Lawson also
passed several names in the final round, tying for 32nd place.
Meanwhile, Mastalir shot a 74-his best round of the
week-to tie for 70th place. Blue continued to struggle,
posting a final-round 77, and tied for 80th.
Stanford's 288 was the best round of the day
matched by Texas and Arizona State and allowed the
Cardinal to break into the top 10.
