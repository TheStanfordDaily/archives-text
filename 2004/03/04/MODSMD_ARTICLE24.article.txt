(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES -
The sting of playing a season-low
21 minutes on Senior Day obvi
ously has not subsided yet for T.J.
Cummings.
The senior forward who fin
ished Saturday's loss to Notre
Dame on the bench was terse
when speaking to reporters about
the game Tuesday.
"I don't want to talk about it,"

he said.
UCLA coach Ben Howland
spoke to Cummings Monday be
fore practice, and explained to
him why he didn't get his usual
playing time.
"I told him his defense was sus
pect at best," Howland said. "If
he's not producing, then we've got
to play the guys who give us the
best chance to win."
Howland did note that Cum
mings grabbed three steals in prac
tice on Monday. That wouldn't be

notable, except that Cummings
has grabbed just four steals in 618
minutes of play all season.
"If you're playing hard and
getting your hands up, you'd ex
pect to have more than one steal
every 200 minutes," Howland
said.
Cummings declined to discuss
his performance or his conversa
tion with Howland, instead choos
ing to focus on the team's upcom
ing trip to face the Oregon
schools.
