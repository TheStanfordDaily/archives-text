# National hormone therapy study halted
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Nearly 11,000 American women received a letter from
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) this past Monday
explaining that the estrogen hormone therapy clinical trial
they had been involved in was being stopped a year earlier
than planned due to the unacceptable health risks associat
ed with the treatment.
These women were taking part in the Women's Health Ini
tiative (WHI), a large set of trials studying nutrition, hormone
therapy and health outcomes. The women in this particular
trial were taking estrogen therapy for a variety of reasons, in
cluding easing menopause symptoms, increasing bone density
and reducing their risk of heart disease, but a safety review
board at the NIH determined that the risk of stroke had be
come significantly high enough that the trial needed to be halt
ed, and the agency informed participants that estrogen thera
py conferred no protection against heart disease.
The NIH review board also reported that the risk of breast
cancer was not higher for the women receiving the estrogen
treatment when compared to those receiving the placebo.
Marcia Stefanick, medicine professor and researcher at the
Stanford Prevention Research Center and principal investiga
tor of the WHI, had been expecting the phone call from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) to halt the estrogen-only
hormone treatment after another trial in the WHI determined
that the combined therapy of estrogen and progesterone could
elevate a woman's risk of heart attack, stroke and breast can
cer. And last week, Stefanick received that call, requiring her
and the rest of the research team to go through a flurry of
phone calls and letters, informing all of the participants in the
study and 40,000 gynecologists and health professionals
that the study had to be halted and that women should not
continue taking estrogen.
Prior to the WHI, medical professionals hypothesized that
because a woman's risk of heart attack was higher after she un
derwent menopause, estrogen and / or progesterone probably
had some type of preventative action against heart disease.
These two WHI trials, where women received either estrogen
and progesterone or estrogen alone, demonstrate that these
theories no longer hold, and doctors may no longer recommend
hormone therapy to reduce a woman's risk of heart disease.
"Even though these two clinical trials have shown that
there is no protective action against heart disease from hor
mone therapy, some researchers still believe that there is a
window of opportunity where estrogen deprivation can have
an impact of the heart disease outcome," Stefanick said. "But
I'm not sure if I buy into this theory."
Hormone therapy has also been prescribed to lower the
risk of osteoporosis, but the Food and Drug Administration
now recommends that women seek other treatment methods.
For women who plan on using hormone therapy for easing
menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, NIH researchers
recommend that women should minimize the dose and length
of treatment to avoid elevating health risks.
Stefanick said she was surprised by the significantly lower
number of hip fractures experienced by those on the hormone
therapy compared to those on the placebo. Many of the
women in the study are either overweight or obese, meaning
that they are already at a low risk for osteoporosis, but re
searchers still saw a rise in bone density among those receiving
the hormones.
"Both studies suggest that estrogen is important in main
taining bone density from facilitating calcium absorption in
the gut to preventing calcium loss in the kidneys to moving cal
cium from the blood into the bone-making cells but we are
now beginning to realize that estrogen may act on bone struc
ture as well. The mechanisms for estrogen's actions in building
and maintaining bone structure, however, are not as well un
derstood," Stefanick said.
Stefanick added that the results of the study have not been
fully analyzed and that the complete report will be published
by a medical peer-review journal in mid-April.
