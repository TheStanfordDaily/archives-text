### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
A coalition of student groups will gather
today in White Plaza for "Book Not Bombs
II" rally, which will feature a rally,, alternative
classes and a candlelight vigil. Last year's
rally attracted as many as 1,000 students and
community members. Stanford is one of a
number of schools across the nation partici
pating in Books Not Bombs 11. Campus orga
nizers said they plan to address events both
local and international.

"We want to inform people of how the war
in Iraq affects the Stanford community and
how the war has been influenced by policies
produced by the Hoover Institute, and that
students take responsibility for this connec
tion," said freshman Nancy Wang, one of the
event's organizers. "We also want to use this
event to allow students to speak out against
the war and emphasize the fact that we won't

be silenced, as many students and faculty
have been nationwide since the war started."

The previous Books Not Bombs, which
took place on March 6 of last year, protested
what was then the possibility of a war in Iraq.
Many participants chose to attend alternative
lessons held in the Quad rather than their reg
ular classes.

Today's events will begin with a rally
from noon to 1 p.m., followed by classes at
1:15 p.m. Instructors of alternative classes
include History Prof. Joel Beinin, History
Prof. Estelle Friedman, Japan Studies post
doctoral fellow Adrienne Hurley, English
Lecturer Emeritus Kathleen Namphy, and
Cultural and Social Anthropology Prof.
Sylvia Yanagisako.
"We're in the process of contacting all pro
fessors on campus to inform them of our ac
tion on Thursday, and the response has been
overwhelmingly supportive," said junior Eric
Shih, another organizer.

The day's events will conclude with a can
dlelight vigil at 8:30 p.m.
According to Wang, a diverse coalition of
student groups are sponsoring this year's
rally, including MEChA, Muslim Students
Awareness Network, Stanford American In
dian Organization, Stanford Asian American
Activism Coalition, Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, Stanford Democrats, Stan
ford Greens, Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion and Students for Choice.

Wang acknowledged that without a loom
ing war in Iraq, the rally will probably not at
tract as many students as it did last year.
"We recognize that many might not see
this as a pressing issue this year, but we hope
to remind people of what has happened in the
past year," Wang said. "Though the event
might not turn out as many people as last
year's event, we think that a number of stu
dents will participate in at least one of the ac
tivities during the day."

Last year's Books not Bombs rally drew as many as 1,000 community members. A lower turnout is expected by organizers this year, but
they still hope to draw students to protest the occupation of Iraq and U.S. budget cuts.
