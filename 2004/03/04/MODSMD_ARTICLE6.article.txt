## Tree sprouts, Dollies chosen 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The new Stanford Tree and Dol
lies have been selected and are
ready to carry on Stanford tradition
and take their places alongside the
band through Winter 2005.
The Stanford Band announced
last night at midnight that junior
Isaac William Salier-Hellendag 111
is the new Tree.

Salier-Hellendag's theme
through the Tree selection process
was "the cleansing of the superflu
ous." According to Salier-Hel
lendag, he tried to eliminate things
in his life that were superfluous, in
cluding the ring toe of his left foot
and his appendix (removed by his
PHE in Branner). Salier-Hellendag
also said that he refrained from eat
ing, sleeping and drinking water for
a period of eight days from Feb. 22
to Mar. 2.

"Isaac is a completely cleansed
of all superfluity," said junior
William Rothacker Jr., the current
Tree. "If you think about it, things
of excess adulterate our existence.
Isaac is pure of all excess at this
point. He'll absolutely make a good
Tree. We [past Trees on the selec
tion committee] all knew that Isaac
was the Tree. It happens every year.
We feel very spiritual about it."
Salier-Hellendag is currently a
Yell Leader, campus tour guide and
an resident assistant in Branner.
Salier-Hellendag also tried out to
be the Tree last year, but he said
that this year he had a better idea of
what to expect.
"We knew from the beginning
that Isaac had a complete disregard
for safety and the opinions of others
that was required," said former
Tree Chuck Armstrong, Class of
'O3. "He has a kamikaze intensity."
Salier-Hellendag said he is look
ing forward to the coming year.
"I envision it as a highway with
out speed limits and stop signs," he
said. "No one is going to slow me
down."

In an event related to a tree
stunt, Rothacker, the current tree,
junior Emma Larkins, a tree candi
date, and junior Nathan Fitzgerald
were detained for a burglary of the
Center for Educational Research at
2:30 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 27. Ac
cording to Larkins, the three
climbed in through an open window
to see the view from the top of the
building.
"My intention was to take the
current tree up there," she said.
"It's a freaky experience."
A security patrol saw someone
inside and other police officers
were called. Police surrounded the
building thinking a large robbery
was in progress, she said, and they
detained the suspects after they
found incriminating evidence such

as a bent screwdriver.
Larkins was dropped as a Tree
candidate and suspended from the
band after the incident.
"We ended up not being charged
with anything," Larkins said. "We
basically got really unlucky. It
didn't cross my mind that some
thing like that would happen."
"We were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time," Fitzgerald said.
The five new Dollies (listed in
height order, as this is a tradition),
Megan Hoarfrost, Lisa Asari,
Nicole D'Arcy, Jessica Whitten and
Carrie Edwards, all freshmen, are
currently being trained for their of
ficial debut at Dollie Splash the
day when the old and new Dollies
are splash around in the Claw with
the Band and perform new dances
in May.
Dollie tryouts took about three
weeks to complete. There were 30
to 40 people who auditioned at the
beginning of the process, but only
about half of the candidates re
mained after the first cuts, two
weeks into the selection. Judges
were old band managers and old
Dollies, and they made their selec
tion based on technical ability as
well as stage presence.
Second and third cuts took place
on "Dollie Day," Saturday, Feb. 21.
The 11 girls remaining had to per
form three dance numbers in front
of the entire current band.

"Throughout tryouts the Band
introduces the Dollies to their crazi
ness by performing skits, reading
dirty limericks and having competi
tions between sections," said cur
rent Dollie Veronica Spindler, a ju
nior. "Dollie day is the pro-dos'
(prospective Dollies') first real
taste of what it will be like to be a
part of the band."
The top eight candidates were
invited to the last round of audi
tions: a party at the Band Shak, also
know as the pro-do shak party.
"The party does not involve any
dancing. Instead, it is a time for the
band and old Dollies to get to know
the pro-dos and decide if, personal
ity-wise, they would be good Dol
lies," Spindler said. "At the end of
the night the Band members break
out their instruments and have an
informal rally, full of dancing and
general good times."
Dollies from this year and last
year are currently teaching the new
Dollies the necessary dances. They
will probably learn about 20 old
numbers and will choreograph
about 10 of their own numbers.

"I have no doubt that [the new
Dollies] will be able to fill our shoes
well, as their tryouts showed that
they have incredible dance and
choreography abilities," Spindler
said. "They are amazing people and
we have no doubt that they will
make exceptional Dollies."
