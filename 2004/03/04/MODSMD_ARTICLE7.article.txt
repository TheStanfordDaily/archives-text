The news media present one-sided coverage of do
mestic violence, according to participants in a sympo
sium last night at the Stanford Women's Community
Center. The symposium, entitled "Call It What It Is," fo
cused on whether the media are too sympathetic to per
petrators of domestic violence and on what can be done
about the problem.
"We're here because we care about changing public
perceptions of domestic violence," said freshman Kanyi
Maqubela, one of the organizers.
Rolanda Pierre-Dixon, a Deputy District Attorney
with the Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Unit,
presented statistics from the county that showed 5,393
cases of domestic abuse in 2003, and 3,656 charges
filed, many more than ever make the news. Over the
same period, there were 21 deaths that resulted from
abusive relationships.
The speakers claimed that the media's presentation
of domestic violence cases suffers from lack of coverage,
a disproportionate focus on homicides and a tendency to
blame the victim and excuse the perpetrator through se
lective reporting. They pointed to coverage of the Laci
Peterson case as an example.
According to Emma Vaughn, a freshman, the news
media chastise victims of domestic violence for staying in
abusive relationships and places undue emphasis on ir
relevant facts like whether the victim dressed promiscu
ously or was unfaithful. Meanwhile, she says, perpetra
tors are partially absolved of responsibility when the
media claim that violence occurred in the heat of the
moment or under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Pierre-Dixon agreed, arguing that the media are mo
tivated more by pleasing their audience than by the facts
of domestic violence.
"They want the sexy story," she said. "They want the
one that is going to make everyone look good."
Pierre-Dixon said she believes that the prevalence of
abuse should give news organizations pause to think
more about their reporting.
"When the San Jose Mercury lost one of its own re
porters to domestic abuse, they had to look inward," she
noted, going on to explain how a reporter fell victim to
the largely-ignored crime.
Nancy Fomenko, director of education for the Sup
port Network for Battered Women, said she understands
that the media must strike a balance between presenting
the truth and keeping its audience interested.
"I can't blame the media entirely, because this is what
we crave," she said. "We are all guilty of it, myself in
cluded."
The symposium also presented potential solutions to
problems in media coverage, including more coverage of
domestic violence, a focus on patterns of abuse rather than
homicides alone and coverage of success stories in which
women have broken free from abusive relationships.
The symposium, attended by a couple dozen people,
was the product of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric
Community Writing Project where a team of freshman
helped the domestic violence agencies examine and ex
plain media coverage.
Allison Mackey, a freshman, felt that better coverage
of domestic abuse could help to lift the stigma that pre
vents victims from seeking help.
"Public perception of intimate violence needs to
change," she said.
