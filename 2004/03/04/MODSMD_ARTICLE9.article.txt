James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank,
spoke yesterday afternoon at the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) about the World Bank's development
and his experience in transforming the institution from a
financial group to an organization focused on people and
poverty.
Wolfensohn is now serving his second five-year term
as president. In his introductory remarks, GSB Dean
Robert Joss noted that Wolfensohn has led the bank be
yond a focus on finance and into a focus on poverty.
When Wolfensohn first came to the World Bank, he
said, he felt that he had to change the culture from one
of self-importance to one of unity. During the beginning
of his tenure, he focused on creating dialogue about
human beings, emotion and poverty along with financial
concerns.
"I wanted to establish a passion and get these people
to think differently," Wolfensohn said.
And little by little, he explained, he brought about that
change through internal reform efforts.
Wolfensohn said he also tried to transform the bank
from a technical entity to a knowledge-based bank. He fo
cused on organizing and pooling knowledge, stemming
the stealing of bank files that was common when he ar
rived.
Now, he said, the World Bank is among the top 10
banks in the world in knowledge management. One
change he said he was proud of was getting people to
record not only successes, but also failures.
"The real important thing is having an objective and
dealing with the internal order that can change things sig
nificantly," he said.
On the external level, Wolfensohn focused on how to
create development and involve people in communities,

both local and international.
To achieve the World Bank's goals in each country,
Wolfensohn indicated that many things need to be con
sidered together, such as institutional structure, capacity
in government, a legal system to protect rights and a
transparent financial system.
"Above all, we need a system [that is] not corrupt,"
Wolfensohn said.
Wolfensohn joked that what he thought of as "corrup
tion" might be considered "family values" in some of the
countries where the World Bank works. To deal with
that, he emphasized the importance of creating an insti
tutional framework that would not tolerate corruption in
any countries.
But "the key to all," as Wolfensohn put it, was "growth
private sector growth" that can generate jobs. This pri
vate-sector growth has been a continued focus of the
World Bank ever since its inception and was still at the
core of its mission, he explained.
Wolfensohn was born and raised in Australia. He re
ceived both his bachelor's degree and law degree in Syd
ney. Before he joined the World Bank in 1995, he worked
through various occupations in law firms and banks. He
got his M.B.A. degree from Harvard during the middle of
his career.
Wolfensohn has traveled more than 100 countries in
the world, and Joss said Wolfensohn is a person of great
generosity, humility and versatility. He is one of the only
three people to have his five-year term extended while at
the World Bank.
Wolfensohn outlined what he considers the World
Bank's goals: winning clients, changing community action
and, most importantly, bringing a better life, better
chance and better stability to the world.
"If we don't do that, we get troubles," he concluded.
"And they cannot be solved by military expenditures."
