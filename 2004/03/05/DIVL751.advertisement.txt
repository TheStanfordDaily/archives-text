"In addition to being
terrific fun, Ellipse is a
feast for the eyes."
—New York Times
Theatrical and hip, Graeme Murphy's
company returns after their hugely
successful performance of Salome in
2000. With Ellipse, the company's
relentless energy and impossible
fluidity is combined with romantic
costumes, fascinating onstage
lighting, and a modern score
that's a blast of pure
musical adrenaline.
