For Stanford students, the coming of spring also
means the coming of the ASSU elections. Yester
day, the ASSU released a list of candidates apply
ing for executive positions within the organization,
as well as candidates for class presidents and mem
bers of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate. Ballots
can be cast on April 7 and 8, and students will have
the opportunity to learn more about the candi
dates when campaigning officially begins on
March 31.
There are three slates of candidates running for
president and vice president of the ASSU. These
candidates said they will tackle a variety of finan
cial and social issues in their campaigns.
Presidential candidate junior Ajani Husbands
and vice presidential candidate junior Alyssa
Schwartz said they plan to focus on topics like cost of
living and the special-fees process, among others.
Husbands served on the Senate two years ago, when
he helped develop the ASSU arts grant, and is cur
rently involved at the Haas Center for Public Service
and is a member of Alpha Pi Alpha. Schwartz is cur
rently the chair of the Senate Advocacy Committee.
"Being involved in the Senate made me realize
that it is vital that the ASSU accurately reflect the
needs of students and work with the administra
tion," Schwartz said.
Senior Mikey Lee, another slate's presidential can
didate, and junior Dylan Mefford, Lee's vice presi
dential candidate, said they also plan to make commu
nication a key concern. The pair is emphasizing their
extensive leadership experience in the ASSU and
elsewhere. Lee was a Junior Class President last year
and is currently a Senior Class President. He has also
served leadership positions at The Stanford Daily and
at the Sigma Nu fraternity. Mefford is an ASSU sena
tor and president of the Stanford Democrats.
"I've used my four years getting ready for this,
and now it's time to implement what I've learned,"
