## 
### BRENDAN SELBY 
For Stanford students, the coming of spring also
means the coming of the ASSU elections. Yester
day, the ASSU released a list of candidates apply
ing for executive positions within the organization,
as well as candidates for class presidents and mem
bers of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate. Ballots
can be cast on April 7 and 8, and students will have
the opportunity to learn more about the candi
dates when campaigning officially begins on
March 31.
There are three slates of candidates running for
president and vice president of the ASSU. These
candidates said they will tackle a variety of finan
cial and social issues in their campaigns.
Presidential candidate junior Ajani Husbands
and vice presidential candidate junior Alyssa
Schwartz said they plan to focus on topics like cost of
living and the special-fees process, among others.
Husbands served on the Senate two years ago, when
he helped develop the ASSU arts grant, and is cur
rently involved at the Haas Center for Public Service
and is a member of Alpha Pi Alpha. Schwartz is cur
rently the chair of the Senate Advocacy Committee.
"Being involved in the Senate made me realize
that it is vital that the ASSU accurately reflect the
needs of students and work with the administra
tion," Schwartz said.
Senior Mikey Lee, another slate's presidential can
didate, and junior Dylan Mefford, Lee's vice presi
dential candidate, said they also plan to make commu
nication a key concern. The pair is emphasizing their
extensive leadership experience in the ASSU and
elsewhere. Lee was a Junior Class President last year
and is currently a Senior Class President. He has also
served leadership positions at The Stanford Daily and
at the Sigma Nu fraternity. Mefford is an ASSU sena
tor and president of the Stanford Democrats.
"I've used my four years getting ready for this,
and now it's time to implement what I've learned,"
Lee said.
As part of their platform, Lee
and Mefford are proposing to
turn the current ASSU social ini
tiative, Absolute Fun, into a
matching-grant program that they
hope will engage a larger part of
the student body in social events.
They said they are currently
working with the University Pres
ident John Hennessy's office to
discuss the idea.
"Community is the number
one concern," Lee said. "We are
convinced that we can fight the
decentralization of all student
groups in a strong effort to make
way for more diversity."
The final slate of candidates
consists of senior Charlie Stock
man and junior Matthew
Henick. Both are writers for the
Stanford Chapparal. Stockman
ran on an all-Chappie ticket last
year but lost to the current team
of senior Nadiya Figueroa and
junior Joey Natoli.
He expressed high hopes for
this year's election.
"While other candidates are
putting flyers up on bathroom
mirrors just to immediately tear
them down and berate them
selves for breaking the rules, I'll
be sitting back in a lawn chair
winning the election." Stockman
said. "You don't run for ASSU
president again and lose, that
just doesn't happen."
Among their qualifications,
Stockman and Henick are citing
"war experience" logged in the
fight against poverty with the
Salvation Army.
"When our opponents are tak
ing I-banking jobs and moving
into high-rise apartment build
ings, we will be holding our noses
and jumping into the sewers,
hunting down the hobos where
they live," Henick said.
The candidates for Class Pres
idents were also announced. The
slates running for Junior Class
Presidents and Senior Class Pres
idents are unopposed, but the
race for Sophomore Class Presi
dents promises competition, with
three slates of candidates vying

for the position.
Michael Lazar, a freshman, is
running as part of the SOLV
slate. The name is derived from
the last names of the four slate
members, and the group is pitch
ing a slogan to "SOLV the
Sophomore Slump."
"Everyone talks about the so
called sophomore slump, and
we're trying to change that,"
Lazar said. "The four of us have
had good experiences this year
with leadership opportunities,
and we have different interests
that represent the class well."
Another slate of candidates,
the Unity slate, also plans to ad
dress the issue of declining
school spirit after the freshman
year.
Unity candidate Jeremy Bat
tle, a freshman, said that part of
the answer to this problem lies in
the proper distribution of the
funds allocated to the Sopho
more Class Presidents.
"We should use those funds
wisely to make sure the social
scene is moving forward after the
freshman year," Battle said.
The final slate running for
Sophomore Class President de
clined to comment for this
article.
The newest batch of senators
will also be decided on election
day. There will be 35 candidates
on the ballot. Next year's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate will have
to deal with many of the same
issues facing the current Senate,
including special fees and cost
of living.
Lee and Mefford's campaign
slogan echoes the optimism and
determination expressed by many
of the candidates: "It's time to get
stuff done, and we've never been
more ready."
Schwartz vowed that she and
Husbands would work with all
groups on campus to achieve
results.
Meanwhile, Stockman and
Henick promised to shake up the
race.
"We will be preaching the
hard truth, tacking bleak facts
to your bulletin boards and pro
tecting this campus from false
promises and even worse, va
grants," they said in a statement
released to The Dailv.
