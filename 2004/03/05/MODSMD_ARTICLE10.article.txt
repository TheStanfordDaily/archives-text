# Salvadorian refugee shares story

### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students gathered in Bechtel International Center
last night to commemorate women's struggles in the
name of International Women's Day, which is March 8.
The event featured three keynote speakers who spoke
about their shared pursuit of justice for torture and
human rights abuses against Salvadorean civilians.
The evening's focus was on the story of torture sur
vivor Neris Gonzales and her involvement in a civil case
against Salvadorean Generals Jose Guillermo Garcia
and Eugenio Vides Casanova. Along with Gonzales,
University Prof. Terry Karl and international human
rights attorney Shawn Roberts also spoke of their in
volvement in the case.
Gonzales grew up in the countryside of El Salvador, a
country with the longest history of dictatorship in Latin
America. At the age of 17, Gonzales initiated a literacy
and health program with the help of a local priest to pre
vent peasants from being cheated of their earnings. As a
result of this initiative, she was captured by a death squad
and tortured for two months.
Gonzales was supposedly killed but found bare
ly alive in a body dump and taken to a secret clinic
for recovery.
"It's painful to share this with you, but I think it's im
portant for you to know what happened during those
years," she said.
Gonzales then described the decade of war in El Sal
vador, financed by President George H.W. Bush, when
sophisticated and damaging weapons such as artillery
and napalm were used against the Salvadorean citizens.
Gonzales came to the United States for trauma treat
ment in 1997 and then filed for political asylum.
In Chicago, Gonzales met Roberts, the former legal
director of the Center for Justice and Accountability.
With two other plaintiffs who suffered similar abuses,
Gonzales filed a lawsuit against Generals Garcia and
Casanova, who both happened to be in exile in Florida.
Though the two generals were not found guilty in a

case filed simultaneously on behalf of four American
nuns murdered in El Salvador, the jury ruled in favor of
the plaintiffs in Gonzales's case.
"It was so beautiful when the jury was able to under
stand what we were saying," she said.
Karl, who is the former director of the Latin Ameri
can Studies Program, introduced Gonzales and spoke of
her experience testifying as an expert in the trial.
"When so many people died, those of us who know
who is responsible are compelled to pursue justice,"
Karl said.
Gonzales stressed, however, that she is still recov
ering from the trauma she experienced. She empha
sized that the most horrific part of her experiences was
witnessing massacres of innocent children by govern
ment soldiers.
Today, Gonzales works with an organization she
founded that uses gardens as therapy for herself and
urban youth. She hopes to make a difference in her
Chicago community plagued by gangs, drug addictions
and homelessness.
"I find that I'm in a place that's very similar to my
home," she said.
Roberts said that Gonzales serves as a role model for
being a strong woman with an interminable spirit.
"Neris shows us that there are ways that everyone can
get involved â€” you can make a difference," Roberts
said. "She had a spirit that could not be extinguished, and
we shared a vision to expose the horror she and many
others experienced and to do something about it."
After an emotional recount of her tale, Gonzales,
Karl and Roberts were questioned by the audience.
When asked as to the current state of affairs in El Sal
vador, all three agreed that though conditions have not
improved, there is hope.
"The effects of globalization have been horrific," Roberts
said. "There are McDonalds and Pizza Huts at every corner,
and there is no way for people to make a living."
The panelists described how basic economic problems
that faced the country at the beginning of the war have ac
tually worsened and how children are now dying of pre-

vent a b Ie
causes.
Karl
noted that the
postwar situ
ation in El
Salvador is
no different
from postwar
situations
elsewhere.
"There is
no good post
war period,"
she said. "The
South took
many years to
recuperate
from the Civil
War. This will
be the same
case in Iraq.
All wars lead
to a back
wards pro
gression for at
least 40 to 50
years."
However,
the hope, the
speakers said,
lies in the up-

coming Salvadorian presidential elections on March 21.
The guerrilla party, Farabundo Marti National Libera
tion Front (FMLN), has a high chance of winning, ac
cording to Roberts. Since the current dictatorship has
never been effectively challenged before, the panelists
noted that death threats and violence are once again in
creasing. The panelists also directly addressed the audi
ence and asked them to spread awareness so that the elec
tions will not be robbed.

Sophomore Allison Whippel left the event feeling
moved and inspired to act.
"The most striking thing was to be able to hear
someone who actually experienced the things I've
studied in classrooms," she said. "It makes it so
much more real, and it makes me so much more
angry."

Activist Neris Gonzales spoke of her travails in commemoration of International Women's Day.
The evening was sponsored by
Unidas, a Latina women's organiza
tion that offers personal and acade
mic support for its members.
Organizers of the event ex
pressed satisfaction afterward with
how the evening proceeded.
"Hearing from individuals who
have overcome unbelievable chal
lenges and continue to stand up for
values of peace and justice is in
credibly energizing and inspiring,"
said organizer Crystal Lopez. "I
hope that people came away with a
feeling of hope and determination
to continue fighting for what
they believe."
