## All the cool kids are doing it Thousands of Stanford students join facebook Web site 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
Classes are being skipped. Work is
being ignored. Students are
spending hours in front of their
computers in utter fascination.
Thefacebook.com craze has swept
through campus.
As of publishing time, there were
over 2,815 Stanford students registered
on the newly launched http://www.the
facebook.com.
Modeled after social networking
Web sites like Friendster.com, this site
provides Stanford students with a net
work of their peers. Students post and
browse pictures of themselves along
with brief descriptions of anything from
gender and year in school to music,
movie tastes and relationship status.
"The online facebook is just what
Stanford needs. It's a brilliant idea be
cause it connects names to photos and
provides a way to find out about some
one without even approaching them,"
said sophomore Mike Rothenberg, who
has over 115 friends on the site.
Students have the ability to add and
confirm others as their friends. Friends of
friends become part of an extended social
network that can be visualized on the site.
The more friends one adds, the larger his
or her extended network becomes. A stu
dent with just over 1(X) friends can have a
network of over 1,500 people.
"I signed up on Tuesday morning and
I was immediately addicted," Rothen
berg said. "Nothing validates your social
existence like the knowledge that some
one else has approved you or is asking
for your permission to list them as a
friend. It's bonding and flattering at the
same time."
The site was created by Harvard Uni
versity sophomore Mark Zuckerberg. A
double major in computer science and
psychology, Zuckerberg wrote all of the
code for the site by himself in one week.
"There has been a bunch of hype at
Harvard for the last few months about
the administration putting together an
online facebook for everyone in the
school," Zuckerberg said. "1 got tired of
waiting for them to finally put it up, so I
just threw this site together myself."
He launched the site on Feb. 6 at
Harvard, Feb. 25 at Columbia Uni

versity, Feb. 26 at Stanford and Feb.
29 at Yale University. Zuckerberg
picked schools where the site would
generate a good response. He told a
few of his friends at each of these
schools to tell their friends about it,
and the rest is history.
More than 7,00(3 people have signed
up in less than a month at Harvard, in
cluding 85 percent of the school's under
graduates. There have been over 1.5 mil
lion profile views. In less than a week at
Stanford, users have viewed profiles al
most 267,000 times. There are over
10,000 users registered at the four
schools combined.
Zuckerberg wants to build a huge
network throughout many schools. The
next schools on his list are Cornell and
Dartmouth, whose sites should be up by
tomorrow.
"I know it sounds corny, but I'd love
to improve people's lives, especially so
cially," Zuckerberg said.
The site seems to be expanding stu
dents' romantic options. According to
one account, an anonymous Stanford
male, a sophomore, invited an attractive
girl that he didn't know to be his friend.
She "confirmed" the friendship (the
standard procedure when an e-mail of
friendship is sent) and proceeded to ask
the male out. They are set to go out on
their first date tonight.
Zuckerberg has also received e
mails from people telling him about
new relationships they're in as a result
of the site.
"I'm not exactly sure how they
come about, but the site does have a
strange way of bringing people togeth
er," Zuckerberg said. "I think that the
site also gives people a better sense of
those in the communities around them,
and as one Stanford student wrote in
an e-mail, 'it brings classes to life' since
he now knows more about the students
in them."
The site can also be used to connect
with other students in your classes or
who share your interests. Students can
add the classes that they are taking to
their profiles. Sophomore Greg Laugh
lin used the site to find a ride to the
Coachella Valley Music Festival, as he
guessed that there would be other Ra
diohead music fans that would want to
go. He ended up receiving several e-

mails from stu
dents offering and
requesting rides to
the concert.
"One person
replied to the
whole list to say
that she thought
we should start
some sort of club
based around this
kind of music,"
Laughlin said.
"Another girl
wrote to say that
there were a few
concerts coming
up at a place she
likes and asked if
some people
wanted to join her.
In my opinion, this
is the point of the
facebook concept.
Sure, its fun to
look at a bunch of
pictures and inter
esting connec
tions, but what re
ally matters is the
facilitation of so
cial interaction
like this."
It is costing
Zuckerberg $85

per month to rent the server, with the
money coming out of his own pocket. He
initially developed the site just for Har
vard students, but it ran so efficiently that
Zuckerberg realized he could run other
colleges off of the same server for no ad
ditional cost. There are no immediate
plans for recuperating the start-up costs.
"In the future we may sell ads to get
the money back, but since providing the
service is so cheap, we may choose to not
do that fora while," Zuckerberg said.
There are many features unique to
thefacebook.com that appeal specifical
ly to college students. When viewing
someone's profile, there are also links to
Stanford Daily articles that the person
has appeared in. If someone posts their
Instant Messenger screenname, then the
person's most recent away message also
appears next to his or her profile. The
site also allows students to send mes
sages to one another.
This Web site is the latest addition to
Zuckerberg's repertoire of Web cre
ations. He was accused of breaching se
curity, violating copyrights and violating
individual privacy and faced school ex
pulsion with his last site conception,
www.facemash.com, which used photos
from Harvard dorms' online facebooks
without permission and placed pictures
of two random Harvard undergraduates
next to each other, asking users to
choose the "hotter" person.
This time, Zuckerberg has taken care
to ensure that he does not violate any
one's privacy. Users can pick which
parts of their profile will be displayed to
other users and friends. In addition, only
people with stanford.edu or stan
fordalumni.org emails can sign up for
the Stanford Web site.
"I really went out of my way to build
robust privacy settings so users have
control over who gets to see every part
of their information," Zuckerberg said.
"People haven't really complained
much about privacy at all."

Zuckerberg faced some scaling is
sues when the Harvard site first went
up, as he hadn't expected more than a
couple hundred people to be using it at
once. On some nights, 10 percent of the
university's students were online at the
same time. After receiving the over
whelming response, Zuckerberg has
worked to make things run faster. So
far, there haven't been any serious tech
nical problems.
"The server hasn't crashed â€” we've
been pretty good about that," Zucker
berg said. "Sometimes we take the site
down fora few minutes to update parts
of it. but that's really the only time it's
ever offline."
Zuckerberg's roommate. Harvard
sophomore Dustin Moskovitz, is in
charge of expanding the site to other
universities. He was vague about what
the duo hopes to achieve from the sites.
"I don't want to elaborate too
much on our end goal / purpose, but I
will say we are not without a plan,"
Moskovitz said.
Some students are resisting theface
book.com craze, calling it a waste of time.
"It's a system designed for people
who feel insecure and need to numeri
cally quantify their friends," said se
nior Alejandro Foung.
For users intrigued by the ambiguity
of the "poking" function, the site's fre
quently asked questions section offers
little explanation.
"We have about as much of an idea [of
what poking is] as you do," the site says.
"We thought it would be fun to make a
feature that has no specific purpose and
to see what happens from there. So mess
around with it, because you're not getting
an explanation from us."
Rothenberg thinks that the creators
should add a feature that would allow
someone to pick where they poke peo
ple, like poking them in the eye or in the
butt, as this "would add a whole new di
mension to the site."
