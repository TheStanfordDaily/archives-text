## Protest this 
### 
Yesterday, The Daily published a news article about
the "Books Not Bombs II" protest. Upon reading
the article, we flashbacked to last year. In March
2003, the campus, the country and the world were
in crisis about the possibility of war with Iraq, and Stanford
students and community members rallied at a protest called
"Books Not Bombs." There were some real issues on hand
at the time. Was pre-eminent attack a legitimate type of
warfare? Did Iraq really have weapons of mass destruction?
But this year, we're a little confused. Last we heard. Bush
had declared war on Iraq, battles were fought, shit hit the
fan, and Saddam Hussein crawled out of a hole and into
American custody looking like many of the male residents of
Synergy. And now we're still in Iraq, trying to put things back
in order. The point is, the war happened. So what exactly is
"Books Not Bombs II"

protesting this time around?
The freshman organizer of
yesterday's protest, Nancy
Wang, stated that the point was
to show "how the war in Iraq
affects the Stanford communi
ty and how the war has been in
fluenced by policies produced
by the Hoover Institution, and
that students take responsibili
ty for this connection."
Sorry Nancy, but we
think you've got it all wrong.

We certainly don't take responsibility for the Hoover
Institution. We do, however, take responsibility for the suc
cess of the Stanford Shopping Center through weekly, if
not bi-weekly, visits. We take responsibility for Moon
bean's thriving business by drinking at least one chai a day.
We take responsibility for Charles Shaw's booming enter
prise (and after consumption of their product take no ab
solutely no responsibility for anything).
We feel that the majority of Stanford students do not
feel a direct connection to the Hoover Institute. We'd ven
ture to guess that a good number of undergrads don't even
know what it does, including Courtney. So Nancy, why as
sume that students take responsibility fora thinktank that
most students simply associate with a giant phallic symbol
in the middle of campus?
Sure, there are some people at Stanford who support
the war, and yes, we all pay taxes that go to the government.
But whether you agree with war or not, it's doubtful that
your feeble opinion actually matters to President George
W. Bush and his policymakers anyway.
We're not saying it's silly to protest against a cause that
you believe in or that grass-roots activism has the potential
to cause social change. It's just important to protest some
thing that actually matters now. We're not even sure what
this protest was about. Against war in general? Or against
the war with Iraq (which already happened)? Or perhaps
against the present occupation of Iraq by American
troops? Again, we're not sure. And it would seem that the
organizing committee of the event isn't so sure either. Be
cause if they are, it wasn't well communicated.
The title of the protest itself, "Books not Bombs,"
doesn't give us any clues. It'd be nice if it were more ex
planatory, but it's not. Books and bombs are not mutually
exclusive, as far as we know. Also, if they're protesting in
defense of education, it makes no sense to skip classes, es
pecially on a campus where the majority of the faculty was
against the war to begin with.
There's a lot of faulty logic here. The small number of
super-conservative Stanford affiliates are focused on all the
time. Condoleeza Rice does not represent Stanford as a
whole, because for every Condie there are at least a couple
Joel Beinins (a well known liberal professor in the
History Department).
We're not trying to make a political judgment here; we
clearly don't have the vocabulary or facility to engage in
that discussion, so if you're thinking about writing us a let
ter about our politics, don't bother — we won't write back
with anything impressive. We'll probably just try to score a
free dinner out of it. We don't even agree with each other
on this issue.
But we do agree that we're in confusion on what this protest
was all about. Come on. Books Not Bombs was SO 2003.
