## Does OSA deflect liability? 
### 
Last week, student leaders from club and
recreational sports received an e-mail
from the Office of Student Activities
(OSA) inviting them to "meet other presi
dents and find out what other groups are doing"
and to "cover the advisor role, inter-group collabo
ration etc."
Of the student leaders who chose to attend the
sessions, many were surprised and concerned
when they learned that OSA's pretext was false
— the meeting was entirely devoted to telling
student club leaders about new liability manage
ment policies. As a result of these new policies,
some teams must write supplementary waiver
forms or safety rules while others must write con
tracts for their coaches. The club leaders were
also told that they might have to cease all activi
ties involving students or community members
under the age of 18.
These meetings serve to substantially reduce the
risk of a multi-million dollar lawsuit against OSA
or Stanford University in the event of an accident.
Liability management is generally a good idea,
since it often improves safety and reduces legal lia
bility and potential humiliation in the press. In ad
dition, the student leaders who had been interested
in meeting other groups came away with some
primitive knowledge about how they could protect
themselves from being found negligent in court.
However, it is debatable whether athletic group
leaders are more or less exposed as a result of last
week's meetings. In the rush to reduce risk to the
University, OSA failed to adequately educate and
protect club leaders. OSA's actions attempt to shift
the onus to club sports leaders who are ill-equipped
to assume the liability. It is unreasonable to expect
overextended Stanford students with little experi
ence in law or contracts to effectively design
waivers, policies or contracts without substantial
help. In addition, many sports group leaders who
would want to learn about liability rules were not

present at last week's meetings because of the mis
leading invitation (which, in many cases, arrived in
student leaders' inboxes indirectly through anoth
er student intermediary).
Although Assistant Director of Student Activ
ities Joey Greenwell promised that if student
leaders are sued, "the University will help you
out," such a vague promise cannot provide ade
quate insurance.
It is unclear whether the recent policies are mo
tivated by a desire to increase safety or simply an
attempt to reduce the University's legal exposure
to the dangerous activities and sports it sanctions.
Apprehensive students cite similarities between
last week's policy announcements and alleged in
creasing pressure from the administration to drink
behind closed doors. Policies inducing such behav
ior may protect the University, but many students
believe that these policies actually increase the
danger of alcohol-related injuries or deaths. These
students fear that, while shielding itself, the Uni
versity's actions may increase both the danger and
legal liability to students. Though these student ac
cusations cannot be proved, the possibility that it
may be true is disconcerting and should be ad
dressed by administrators.
Alcohol or involvement in sports groups can be
dangerous. In order to truly fulfill its custodial
duty, the University must not only promulgate
rules or hold meetings designed to reduce its liabil
ity, but also strive to fully educate students regard
ing the safety and legal risks they face in participat
ing in or leading risky activities. Requiring student
group leaders to be thoroughly trained is better for
everyone in the Stanford community than sending
confusing and misleading invitations to attend con
trived training sessions.
Thus, while overall liability reduction is posi
tive, such a reduction must come along with the
maximum possible reduction in actual risk to stu
dent liability as well.
