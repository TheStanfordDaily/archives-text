# THE 						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## Finals week for the EU 
### 
Spring quarter's coming. You
can almost see yourself eat
ing lunch outside on a day
ripped from the pages of the
Stanford brochure. But first, you
need to deal with those damned fi
nals. You need to finish that story
about the middle aged man for fic
tion class and take care of those six
psych chapters that somehow
didn't get read. If only you could
only just press fast forward.
Europe is in a finals week of
sorts these days. With its member
ship about to jump from 15 to a
whopping 25 countries on May 1,
the European Union (EU) is try
ing to draft a constitution. This
task was difficult enough for our
13 former English colonies that
had just won a war of indepen
dence. In Europe, the debate rages
between 25 countries — many of
them former empires — with
thousands of years of national his
tory behind them.
Following a year-long Constitu
tional Convention, the EU mem
ber states nearly signed on the dot
ted line in December of 2003 until
the issue of how to distribute votes
between states halted all progress.
Europe couldn't agree and the fu
ture promised more deadlocked
negotiations around a table now
seating 25.
However, states continue to co
operate outside the EU's frame
work. On Wednesday, Germany
and France announced their joint
plan for the Middle East. Their co
operation is indicative of a general
increase in shared policies —
mostly focused on foreign affairs

— that has occurred since the
failed constitution talks. The Unit
ed Kingdom has also collaborated

with Germany
and France on
major defense
plans and the
three have been
accused of trying
to form a "Core
Europe."
For Germany
and France, both
long-time propo
nents of a strong

EU, the strategy seems to be pay
ing off. The past weeks have
proven that more important than
the existence of a "core" is the
specter of one. Germany had al
ready begun to pull back from
some of the British and French
plans in order to refocus on the
constitution. Meanwhile, the
largest new member state, Poland,
recently reconsidered its stubborn
stance on the voting issues and ap
pears ready to make some conces
sions during negotiations.
What Poland and Germany
both saw was a Europe moving for
ward without all of its members in
volved. Both states realized that
they were not nearly as powerful
alone as they were together. The
French-German Middle East plan
doesn't carry the same internation
al authority as one under the flag of
a united Europe. And while the ex
istence of a constitution hardly
guarantees that the states will be
able to agree on policy in general,
it will create the crucial attitude of
unity that only something as sym

bolic as a constitution can provide.
The world needs a second
source of authority to balance the
influence of the United States.
Whether or not you agree with the
policies of the present U.S. admin
istration, separation of powers is
the foundation of justice. Further,
the rebellion in Haiti, the escala
tion of attacks in Iraq and crises
around the world demand more at
tention than the United States can
provide alone. A German / French
plan that appears to snub America
for its failures in the region will not
capture the imagination of the
world. While the past decade has
proven that Europe is far better at
planning to make foreign policy
than it is at actually making it, a
European constitution would force
the EU to live up to its new re
sponsibilities and expectations.
There is hardly another choice.
Today's world is one in which big
ger is better. Whether it be interna
tional corporations, political enti
ties or the size of your courseload,
the best way to affect change in a
shrinking world is to keep growing.
With finals week around the cor
ner, European leaders and Stan
ford students are being put to the
test and sacrifices will prove neces
sary. While a beautiful spring
awaits, the dark clouds of Euro
pean disunity and transcript "in
completes" will hover above us if
we fail.
