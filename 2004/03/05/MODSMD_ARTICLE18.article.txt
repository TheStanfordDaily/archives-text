Humßio Core module overlooks
eating disorders
1 was dismayed to learn that
last week's Human Biology core
module on obesity failed to ad
dress, even in passing, the closely
related problem of eating disor
ders. Though students spent sev
eral days in lecture learning about
the dangers of obesity and its asso
ciated risks, no mention was made
of Ihe physical and emotional
harm caused by anorexia, bulimia
and other disordered eating
habits. The omission was presum
ably due to the statistically larger
prevalence of obesity among the
national population; yet such
statistics, however compelling, do
not accurately represent attitudes
at Stanford. Students here are, in
fact, far more likely to be overly
concerned with their weight than
they are to be unhealthily neglect
ful of it. A module failing to ac
knowledge this phenomenon sim
ply reinforces the problem.
Mirror, a student group recent
ly featured in The Daily, was cre
ated to help address the growing
problem of disordered eating on
campus. At Mirror, we see disor
dered eating as a significant threat
to student health and well-being,
and we worry for students in the
Humßio core who left last week
newly convinced of the dangers
food poses to them. For students
affected by disordered eating or
body dissatisfaction, distortion of
self and food is standard and eat
ing in "moderation" rarely
amounts to a healthy diet. While
obesity is undeniably a critical
health concern facing Americans
today, equally undeniable is the
pressure — particularly on col
lege campuses — that students
constantly face to be both thin and
"fit." Class exercises that amplify
this pressure, compiling, for ex
ample, the body mass index of
each student into a bar graph dis
played before the entire class,
only encourage unhealthy com
parison and body dissatisfaction. I
sincerely hope that next year's
module takes this serious problem
into account.

Students should focus on books,
not bombs
The revival of the "Books Not
Bombs" protest, organized by the
Stanford Community for Peace
and Justice (SCPJ), is misguided

and dangerous. The title of the
event implies that SCPJ values ed
ucation. but its actions and anti
war stance hurt education. Though
some people may question
whether democracy is better for
Iraq than a Baathist dictatorship,
the invasion has undoubtedly ben
efited education in Iraq. The Unit
ed States renovated more than
1,200 schools and now funds a ten
fold increase in salary for Iraqi
teachers. The new textbooks no
longer teach Iraqi children to love
Saddam Hussein and hate Jews.
There are many good reasons to
oppose the war, but concern for
education is not one of them.
Though this event will change
nothing in Iraq, it has harmful ef
fects on learning here at Stanford.
How can the event organizers en
courage students to skip class and
ask professors to cancel lectures
for an event called "Books Not
Bombs"? SCPJ should organize its
protests on the weekends or at
night so that they do not interfere
with the real learning that happens
in classrooms.

EDGE has academic merit
I am writing this letter in re
sponse to the feature article on
EDGE in The Daily ("Class Shop
per: The real question is: EDGE of
what?" March 3) which refers to it
as a course "for athletes and Pi
Phis." I am not a Pi Phi and I am
not an athlete. I'm an internation
al relations major who — believe
it or not — actually cares about
the topics I have the opportunity
to hear every week in that heinous
room of disinterested athletes, lip
balm-toting sorority girls and —
let's just say it — the big nerds ei
ther playing video games on their
lap tops or viciously highlighting
their Humßio course readers. My
first EDGE lecture was, I'll admit,
a shock. I'd never attended a class
in which students dared to come
hours late, put their feet on the
back of people's chairs, sleep, play
video games or do their home
work, while important speakers —
such as the president of the Truth
Commission in Peru — made time
out of their busy schedules to tell a
group of disinterested, over-privi
leged Stanford students about top
ics like the investigation of gross
human rights violations in Peru. I
felt both appalled and ashamed of
the disrespect with which this

speaker (and a plethora of others
in past lectures) was treated. It
would be nice if the students in
EDGE could at least show some
respect fora man that traveled half
the world to inform us about a
cause he was personally commit
ted to and passionate about. Is that
too much to ask for?
I think The Daily's feature was
a little too condemning as the
writer only attended one lecture
(and a particularly boring one, I'll
give you that; I was there). Stu
dents shouldn't totally dismiss
taking this class. I.for one, don't
regret taking EDGE. Sure, the
name of the class is an acronym
and you have to constantly spell it
out or answer the oh-so-delightful
question,"Oh, are you an ath
lete?" but EDGE actually opened
me to a number of different op
portunities I wouldn't have had
without taking the class. These in
clude meeting Professor Terry
Karl, my current teacher for the
Global Politics of Human Rights;
Carlos Mauricio, a victim of tor
ture and persecution during El
Salvador's Dirty War and founder
of the Stop the Impunity Project;
and, of course. Dr. Lerner, the
president of the Truth and Recon
ciliation Commission in Peru. No,
I didn't take EDGE in a desperate
attempt to raise my grade point
average. No, I didn't write a 10
page research paper on the history
of the WTO. I got an A + — but I
believe that was due to the hard
work I put into the weekly re
search and the three-page paper I
wrote on the problem of impunity
and human rights violations in
Peru. EDGE is a great outlet for
students interested in world poli
tics and enjoy attending one-hour
workshops to discuss topics they
personally care about with a pro
fessor and not just another irrev
erent teaching fellow. Sorry, the
class really isn't as empty as The
Daily's one-sided column.

Stanford still better than Duke
In regards to yesterday's letter
submitted by the two Dukies:
ranked higher does mean a better
basketball team; that's why we're
ranked higher. If Duke were a
better basketball team, then Duke
would be ranked higher.
