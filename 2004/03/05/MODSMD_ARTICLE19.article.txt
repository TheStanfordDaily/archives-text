## Foster Asian-American subgroups in admissions process 
### LAUREN HILARIO 
Last year, Asian-American groups on
campus celebrated the fact that Asians and
Asian Americans at Stanford comprised
nearly one-fourth of the undergraduate pop
ulation— a striking increase from the six
Asian students in attendance when the Uni
versity opened in 1891. Further, these groups
were proud to announce that the numbers of
students of Filipino and Vietnamese descent
admitted had hit an all-time high, almost
doubling the total number of admits on cam
pus from these ethnicities.
As active members in our respective
Asian-American communities and commu
nity organizations on campus, we continue
our efforts to reach out to youth in the Bay
Area and beyond, promoting the very real
and attainable possibility of higher educa

tion and becoming a student at Stanford. The
members of the Pilipino American Student
Union and the Stanford Vietnamese Stu
dents Association currently mentor and
form ties with high school students in San
Jose, Fremont, Union City and other parts of
the Bay Area. As members of these organi
zations, we table at college fairs and hold
conferences on campus focused on minority
youth empowerment. Further, with the help
of the Office of Undergraduate Admissions
staff, we have formed personal connections
and established avenues for communication
with admitted students; we contact admits of
the ethnic background we represent through
phone calls, letters and e-mails.
We refuse to stop there. Discrepancies
between Asian-American subgroup popula
tions in the United States and on campus still
exist, raising the crucial issue of under-repre

sentation based on race relations, back
ground and privilege. For instance, while a
large number of Asian-American focused
organizations exist at Stanford, there are
groups such as Hmong, Thai, Laotian and
Mien that do not have the student group
manpower to run outreach efforts. We ask
that the Admissions Office take concrete
steps in providing institutional support and
resources to serve these groups.
We can celebrate the growing number of
Asian-American students, but we must ad
dress the fact that between the Vietnamese,
the Filipino, the Indian, the Chinese, the
Cambodian communities — indeed, be
tween all of the Asian-American subgroups
— there exist strong differences in not only
culture, but in socioeconomic demograph
ics. These socioeconomic demographics re
veal barriers to the attainment of higher ed

ucation — barriers that are progressively
being broken down through youth outreach
and the admissions policies adhered to by
the University and numerous other educa
tional institutions.
Now we seek improved outreach efforts
both by our growing population and by the
University for those groups that lack sup
port from student organizations. We seek a
solidification of University policy that gives
special consideration to underrepresented
Asian-American subgroups in the admis
sions process. If the purpose of the special
consideration policy is to aid ethnic groups
disadvantaged because of their racial back
ground, policy-makers must realize that
today there are subgroups of the Asian-
American population that are living far
worse than others. Stanford's policy cur
rently names African Americans, Mexican

Americans and Native Americans as recip
ients of special consideration. Given the
current disparity, it follows that underrep
resented Asian-American subgroups are
worthy of being explicitly listed in the Uni
versity's admissions policies as well. Un
dertaking such change would increase di
versity on campus, thus formalizing Stan
ford's commitment to fostering the best
possible environment for personal and aca
demic growth.
