PULLMAN. Wash. — Just when it looked
like it was over — the streak, the game—just
when everyone at Friel Court was ready to cele
brate, with Stanford junior swingman Josh Chil
dress sidelined with five fouls and several Cardi
nal turnovers down the stretch — Stanford con
jured up one more miracle.
Playing in front of Washington State's largest
crowd in seven years, the Cardinal scored eight
points in the final 26 seconds of the game to over
come a six-point second-half deficit to keep the
undefeated streak alive.
"It looked so many times like we weren't going
to win the game," said Stanford head coach Mike

The 63-61 Stanford win, which culminated
when senior guard Matt Lottich hit an off-bal

go undefeated in the regular season.
Stanford didn't exactly looked poised down
the stretch, but it got the job done. With 17.4 sec

61-60 in favor of the Cougars.
Washington State guard Marcus Moore went
to take the ball out of bounds, but was whistled for
a controversial five-second violation before he
could call the timeout — the second five-second
call against the Cougars in a tightly officiated game.
Stanford inbounded the ball to Chris Hernan

around on the floor, touching several diving play
ers' hands before finding its way to Lottich, who
threw it to Nick Robinson. Robinson stopped
