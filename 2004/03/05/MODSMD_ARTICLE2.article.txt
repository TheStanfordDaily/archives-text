# Another Miracle
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
PULLMAN. Wash. — Just when it looked
like it was over — the streak, the game—just
when everyone at Friel Court was ready to cele
brate, with Stanford junior swingman Josh Chil
dress sidelined with five fouls and several Cardi
nal turnovers down the stretch — Stanford con
jured up one more miracle.
Playing in front of Washington State's largest
crowd in seven years, the Cardinal scored eight
points in the final 26 seconds of the game to over
come a six-point second-half deficit to keep the
undefeated streak alive.
"It looked so many times like we weren't going
to win the game," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "A lot of things had to happen for
us to win."
The 63-61 Stanford win, which culminated
when senior guard Matt Lottich hit an off-bal
ance, desperation 3-pointer as the buzzer sound
ed, moves Stanford to 26-0 overall (17-0 Pacific
-10 Conference) and gives the Cardinal a shot to
go undefeated in the regular season.
Stanford didn't exactly looked poised down
the stretch, but it got the job done. With 17.4 sec
onds remaining and the Cardinal down by five,
sophomore guard Dan Grunfeld hit a three from
the corner and was fouled by a hard-charging
Jeff Varem. He converted the free throw to com
plete the four-point play, bringing the score to
61-60 in favor of the Cougars.
Washington State guard Marcus Moore went
to take the ball out of bounds, but was whistled for
a controversial five-second violation before he
could call the timeout — the second five-second
call against the Cougars in a tightly officiated game.
Stanford inbounded the ball to Chris Hernan
dez, but he then lost the handle. The ball rolled
around on the floor, touching several diving play
ers' hands before finding its way to Lottich, who
threw it to Nick Robinson. Robinson stopped

few seconds, and passed the ball out to Lot

Washington State fans threw trash and

view the shot at the scorer's table.
"We played our hearts out," Cougar forward
Shami Gill said, 'it stings when you lose like
that — How many chances do you get to beat
the No. 1 team? And [wej had it."
Washington State fell to 0-24 all-time against
top-ranked teams.
Washington head coach Dick Bennett had
been saying it all week long — preaching it in
the locker room and in practice to his players,
emphasizing it to the media during midweek
press conferences.
According to Bennett, if the Cougars were
going to have any shot at upsetting top-ranked
and still undefeated Stanford, they were going
to have to play a downtempo, half-court game.
That meant keeping the Cardinal from fast
breaking and no quick shots by the Cougars on
offense. In basketball-speak, Bennett meant
that Washington would have to out-smart Stan
ford in order to be successful.
And the Cougars almost did it — almost
did what no other team has been able to do
this season.
On offense, when Stanford was in a man
to-man defense, Washington State went to
the pick-and-roll almost religiously, aggres
sively attacking the basket and nailing tough
pull-up jumpers.
When the Cardinal switched to their 1-1-3
zone, the Cougars countered by putting four
men out on the perimeter, actively moving the
ball around the three-point arc, forcing Stan
ford's perimeter defenders to run from man to
man, hoping to stretch the zone and create an
open man.
And Washington found them — converting
an easy baseline layup here, and hitting a wide
open 15-footer there.
Things had been a little tougher in the first
half for the Cougars, as Stanford went on a 10-0
run during a four-minute stretch early in the first
half, extending its lead to 19-10 when senior
guard Matt Lottich hit a wide-open trey.
The Cougars called a 30-second timeout and
then retaliated, quickly closing the gap.
With a little over a minute remaining in the
half, Washington State senior guard Marcus

Moore (the Cougars leading scorer) converted
only his second field goal of the night to pull
Washington State within five points.
Junior guard Thomas Kelati then came up
with the steal on the defensive end and dribbled
the ball down the court for the easy lay. After a
Stanford miss on the other end, Kelati scored
another field goal, bringing the Cougars within
one-point.
Washington State finished the first half down
three points, 29-26, after Stanford freshman
Fred Washington nailed a couple of free throws
with less than a second left on the clock.
In the second half, the Cougars — who are
desperately fighting for the eighth and final spot
in the Pac-10 Tournament next week — quick
ly tied the score at 31 three minutes into the pe
riod. On their next offensive possession, Moore
found a cutting Varem in the lane fora wide
open two-handed slam for Washington State's
first lead since the game's opening minutes.
The Cougars extended their lead to six
points, 39-33, before Montgomery called a time
out with 14:13 remaining. Almost three minutes
later, a layup by sophomore Matt Haryasz tied
the score at 41 and after a Cougar miss, Haryasz
nailed a 15-footer to put the Cardinal up by two.
But even after all of that back-and-forth, it
all came down to those final seconds, that
final minute when Stanford figured out a way
not to lose. Its best player on the sideline say
ing his prayers and the Washington State
crowd up in arms.
With 25 seconds remaining, Varem hit two
free throws, putting the Cougars up by five,
61-56.
But that was the last time Washington
State, which had led since the 10-minute mark,
would score.
Grunfeld scored four in a hurry and then
Lottich came up big, as the Cardinal rushed the
floor in celebration.
"We had some fortunate things go our way,"
Lottich said of the win.
Montgomery felt the Cardinal's win was a lit
tle too miraculous.
"[I told the guys] we needed to try and treat
this like a loss," he said. "(We can't) walk away
feeling like a million bucks."
Since the Pac-10 expanded to an 18
game schedule in 1979, no team has ever
gone 18-0 in the conference. Two teams,
however, have achieved records of 17-1
(Oregon State in 1981 and Arizona on five
different occasions.)
Stanford will travel to Seattle to face
red-hot Washington, which has clinched
second place in the Pac-10, on Saturday
at 3 p.m. in a game that will be televised
on ABC.

Shami Gill said, 'it stings when you lose like
that — How many chances do you get to beat

Washington State fell to 0-24 all-time against
top-ranked teams.
Washington head coach Dick Bennett had
been saying it all week long — preaching it in
the locker room and in practice to his players,
emphasizing it to the media during midweek
press conferences.
According to Bennett, if the Cougars were
going to have any shot at upsetting top-ranked
and still undefeated Stanford, they were going
to have to play a downtempo, half-court game.
That meant keeping the Cardinal from fast
breaking and no quick shots by the Cougars on
offense. In basketball-speak, Bennett meant
that Washington would have to out-smart Stan
ford in order to be successful.
And the Cougars almost did it — almost
did what no other team has been able to do
this season.
On offense, when Stanford was in a man
to-man defense, Washington State went to
the pick-and-roll almost religiously, aggres
sively attacking the basket and nailing tough
pull-up jumpers.
When the Cardinal switched to their 1-1-3
zone, the Cougars countered by putting four
men out on the perimeter, actively moving the
ball around the three-point arc, forcing Stan
ford's perimeter defenders to run from man to
man, hoping to stretch the zone and create an
open man.
And Washington found them — converting
an easy baseline layup here, and hitting a wide
open 15-footer there.
Things had been a little tougher in the first
half for the Cougars, as Stanford went on a 10-0
run during a four-minute stretch early in the first
half, extending its lead to 19-10 when senior
guard Matt Lottich hit a wide-open trey.
The Cougars called a 30-second timeout and
then retaliated, quickly closing the gap.
With a little over a minute remaining in the
half, Washington State senior guard Marcus

Moore (the Cougars leading scorer) converted
only his second field goal of the night to pull
Washington State within five points.
Junior guard Thomas Kelati then came up
with the steal on the defensive end and dribbled
the ball down the court for the easy lay. After a
Stanford miss on the other end, Kelati scored
another field goal, bringing the Cougars within
one-point.
Washington State finished the first half down
three points, 29-26, after Stanford freshman
Fred Washington nailed a couple of free throws
with less than a second left on the clock.
In the second half, the Cougars — who are
desperately fighting for the eighth and final spot
in the Pac-10 Tournament next week — quick
ly tied the score at 31 three minutes into the pe
riod. On their next offensive possession, Moore
found a cutting Varem in the lane fora wide
open two-handed slam for Washington State's
first lead since the game's opening minutes.
The Cougars extended their lead to six
points, 39-33, before Montgomery called a time
out with 14:13 remaining. Almost three minutes
later, a layup by sophomore Matt Haryasz tied
the score at 41 and after a Cougar miss, Haryasz
nailed a 15-footer to put the Cardinal up by two.
But even after all of that back-and-forth, it
all came down to those final seconds, that
final minute when Stanford figured out a way
not to lose. Its best player on the sideline say
ing his prayers and the Washington State
crowd up in arms.
With 25 seconds remaining, Varem hit two
free throws, putting the Cougars up by five,
61-56.
But that was the last time Washington
State, which had led since the 10-minute mark,
would score.
Grunfeld scored four in a hurry and then
Lottich came up big, as the Cardinal rushed the
floor in celebration.
"We had some fortunate things go our way,"
Lottich said of the win.
Montgomery felt the Cardinal's win was a lit
tle too miraculous.
"[I told the guys] we needed to try and treat
this like a loss," he said. "(We can't) walk away
feeling like a million bucks."
Since the Pac-10 expanded to an 18
game schedule in 1979, no team has ever
gone 18-0 in the conference. Two teams,
however, have achieved records of 17-1
(Oregon State in 1981 and Arizona on five
different occasions.)
Stanford will travel to Seattle to face
red-hot Washington, which has clinched
second place in the Pac-10, on Saturday
at 3 p.m. in a game that will be televised
on ABC.

Junior Josh Childress managed a double-double before fouling out in ihe final minutes or lasl
nighf s win, a game that nearly caused a heart attack for every Stanford fan watching.
PULLMAN. Wash. — Just when it looked
like it was over — the streak, the game—just
when everyone at Friel Court was ready to cele
brate, with Stanford junior swingman Josh Chil
dress sidelined with five fouls and several Cardi
nal turnovers down the stretch — Stanford con
jured up one more miracle.
Playing in front of Washington State's largest
crowd in seven years, the Cardinal scored eight
points in the final 26 seconds of the game to over
come a six-point second-half deficit to keep the
undefeated streak alive.
"It looked so many times like we weren't going
to win the game," said Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery. "A lot of things had to happen for
us to win."
The 63-61 Stanford win, which culminated
when senior guard Matt Lottich hit an off-bal
ance, desperation 3-pointer as the buzzer sound
ed, moves Stanford to 26-0 overall (17-0 Pacific
-10 Conference) and gives the Cardinal a shot to
go undefeated in the regular season.
Stanford didn't exactly looked poised down
the stretch, but it got the job done. With 17.4 sec
onds remaining and the Cardinal down by five,
sophomore guard Dan Grunfeld hit a three from
the corner and was fouled by a hard-charging
Jeff Varem. He converted the free throw to com
plete the four-point play, bringing the score to
61-60 in favor of the Cougars.
Washington State guard Marcus Moore went
to take the ball out of bounds, but was whistled for
a controversial five-second violation before he
could call the timeout — the second five-second
call against the Cougars in a tightly officiated game.
Stanford inbounded the ball to Chris Hernan
dez, but he then lost the handle. The ball rolled
around on the floor, touching several diving play
ers' hands before finding its way to Lottich, who
threw it to Nick Robinson. Robinson stopped
