## Why the Postal Service should not be a monopoly 
### RICK GEDDES 
The U.S. Department of Justice an
nounced last week that Oracle's takeover of
People Soft violates antitrust law, stating
that "we believe this transaction is anti-com
petitiveâ€” pure and simple." Ironically, in
the same week the U.S. Supreme Court, in
United States Postal Service v. Flamingo In
dustries, decided that the massive U.S.
Postal Service is exempt from all antitrust
laws. Yet anticompetitive behavior by the
Postal Service is more harmful to con
sumers, competitors and the overall econo
my than most private sector mergers.
The Postal Service enjoys a government
enforced monopoly over the delivery of all
letters. Yet it competes in a wide and in

creasing array of businesses in which private
firms are already active, including package
and express delivery; it has recently ven
tured into selling a variety of retail mer
chandise and e-commerce services (most of
which are unrelated to postal services).
A major concern is that the Postal Ser
vice will use funds from monopolized de
livery services, where it holds customers
captive, to under-price in businesses
where it faces competition. Given that the
final authority to set rates rests not with its
regulator, the Postal Rate Commission,
but with the Postal Service itself, that fear
is justified. Moreover, the best available
estimates (given the Postal Service's poor
accounting data) indicate that it has
earned losses on many products where it

faces competition. Under-pricing is thus
nearly a certainty.
Various other concerns have arisen
about the Postal Service's competitive activ
ities. In addition to monopoly power, it is ex
empt from all taxation. It can borrow from
the Treasury at government-guaranteed
rates. It has the power of eminent domain
and is excused from Security and Exchange
Commission disclosure requirements. It is
not required to pay parking tickets or regis
tration fees on its vehicles. It is immune
from antitrust laws and is not subject to Fed
eral Trade Commission truth-in-advertising
regulations, meaning that it can assert any
thing it wishes in ads.
All those valuable government-bestowed
privileges allow the Postal Service to ineffi

ciently and unfairly compete with private
firms. The Postal Service is able to force pri
vate firms out of business by virtue of its spe
cial privileges, rather than through superior
management acumen, better labor relations
or any business-related skills. It can offer
any competitive service it wishes at any time
at any price without any regulatory over
sight whatsoever.
This is bad policy. Consumers will be hurt
because the costs of those ventures will be
passed on to them through higher rates in
monopolized activities and because they will
face less choice after the Postal Service has
forced competitors out of business. Com
petitors will go out of business, shrink or not
start up in the first place in the face of unfair
competition from the Postal Service. Final

ly, state and local governments will lose tax
revenue when the Postal Service forces out
taxpaying businesses.
The executive and legislative branches
should act. The Postal Service ought to be
kept out of competitive activities entirely.
Better still, it should be relieved of all gov
ernment-granted privileges, including
monopoly power. This situation is anti
competitive. pure and simple, and it should
be changed.
