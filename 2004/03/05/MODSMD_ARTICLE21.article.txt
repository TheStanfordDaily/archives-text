## Why are those Brazilians so hot? Ask Julie 
### 
I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Brazilian women are hot. And for
those of you unfortunate Palo Altans
who missed Carnaval in Rio do Janeiro
lost week, I'm going to let you in on anoth
er secret.
Contrary to many popular misconcep
tions. Carnaval in Rio. unlike Mardi Ciras, is
completely devoid of drunk, beer-belly col
lege- girls flashing their untanned ta-ta's for
plastic beads. Glittery, glistening, gorgeous,
golden women parade — with enough ener
g\ to make their feet bleed and lose an easy
10 pounds by the time they're done traveling
a short 700 yards — in front of hundreds of
thousands as honored highlights of each
samba school's parade.
Wh\ are Brazilian women so hot? Why
arc black guys so good at basketball? Why
are nav men such damn good dancers?

Interesting, that the first
question is so innocuous,
while the next two are pret
ty loaded. A lot of people
just naturalize the issue and
say it's genetic. Ethnicity,
genes and recreational hob
hies get lumped together.
Although last I checked,
free-throw percentages and
stage flair aren't attached to
;inv chromosomes.

I lot women? That's got at least a little
something to do with your genes. Brazilian
women trace their chromosomes hack to in
digenous groups, Portuguese colonizers and
African slaves. They affirm my assertion that
mixed people are generally very, very hot.
The anthropologist would point out
that "Brazilian," "black" and "gay" are all
culturally constructed categories, general
izations within themselves, which is a
much more interesting approach to the
questions than searching for the actual an
swers themselves.
But I want to talk about hot women. Be
cause a big reason Brazilian women are re
puted to be so damn hot is that they actually
work out. And I'm not talking about walking
on the treadmill. Walking is only exercise if
you are over 60 years old, okay?
Wait, are we reading the Sports column,
or the Fitness and Health section?
It's my column, so shut up. Or, tune in the
rest of the week and read inane, stereotypical
accounts of some guy's arbitrarily favorite
sports teams, favorite player /childhood idol
and why you should care what someone's
perimeter shooting percentage was two
weeks ago.
I'll rather talk about professional hoop
player Olsi Perry, who underwent circumci
sion as part of the process of converting to
play for the Israeli national team. Or. not. So,
Brazilian fitness clubs.
Sign on at an "academia" in Rio and sud
denly you've got a personal trainer and nutri
tionist. fat percentage analysis, lymphatic
drainage, shiatsu massages, Tae 80, hydro
gymnastics. trampoline workouts, samba /
mambo / rumba / axe aerobics, capoeira and,
yes. yoga too. Some clubs will even throw in
English classes, van transport to and from
your workout and group excursions for
rapelling, hiking in the jungle, tree climbing,
rafting, even dancing in Carnaval.
if you peek in on even a standard aero
bics class, you see dozens of perfectly cut
women in outrageous spandex outfits with
50-pound weights on each leg like it's no
thing. The whole scene is absolutely ridicu
lous and awe-inspiring.
Granted, women in Wisconsin probably
have no real incentive to "get in shape." It's
not like they live two blocks from the beach in
the world's capital for plastic surgery. But
being fit is not just an aesthetic thing — espe
cially when we live in a country where one of
our biggest enemies is heart disease (it's a
health thing) and where Jenny Craig, Weight
Watchers and Anna Nicole Smith are profit
ing off of fat women who still aren't losing the
weight (it's an economic thing).
What's the deal with American fitness
clubs, anyway? No one at Bally's even looks
remotely like the people in their commer
cials. and these places are generally plain,
boring, smelly and grossly over-priced. Even
at Stanford, the Disneyland for smart kids,
we get a weight room with roped-off sections
for "real athletes" and some blocks we can
jump on. Or. Tresidder Fitness, the two-by
four afterthought with glass walls facing the
public restroom.
When Americans are out of shape, they
cover up. When Brazilians are out of shape,
they get their beautiful asses to the gym (or
take diet pills, but why belabor the de
tails?) and still rock bikinis at the beach. In
Rio. at least, they have got it down. The fit
ness club is a bizarre, multi-function
Utopia. The result? Hot, hot bodies, from
the guy who walks your dogs to the pre
miere dancer in Carnaval.

E-mail Julie at julieolo@stanford.edu if
Jenny Craig has ever lied to you. Granted,
she has presented no causal link between the
Brazilian fitness phenomenon and beautiful
Carnaval dancers.

work out. And I'm not talking about walking
on the treadmill. Walking is only exercise if
you are over 60 years old, okay?
Wait, are we reading the Sports column,
or the Fitness and Health section?
It's my column, so shut up. Or, tune in the
rest of the week and read inane, stereotypical
accounts of some guy's arbitrarily favorite

I'll rather talk about professional hoop
player Olsi Perry, who underwent circumci

play for the Israeli national team. Or. not. So,
Brazilian fitness clubs.
Sign on at an "academia" in Rio and sud
denly you've got a personal trainer and nutri
tionist. fat percentage analysis, lymphatic
drainage, shiatsu massages, Tae 80, hydro
gymnastics. trampoline workouts, samba /
mambo / rumba / axe aerobics, capoeira and,
yes. yoga too. Some clubs will even throw in
English classes, van transport to and from
your workout and group excursions for
rapelling, hiking in the jungle, tree climbing,
rafting, even dancing in Carnaval.
if you peek in on even a standard aero
bics class, you see dozens of perfectly cut
women in outrageous spandex outfits with
50-pound weights on each leg like it's no
thing. The whole scene is absolutely ridicu
lous and awe-inspiring.
Granted, women in Wisconsin probably
have no real incentive to "get in shape." It's
not like they live two blocks from the beach in
the world's capital for plastic surgery. But
being fit is not just an aesthetic thing — espe
cially when we live in a country where one of
our biggest enemies is heart disease (it's a
health thing) and where Jenny Craig, Weight
Watchers and Anna Nicole Smith are profit
ing off of fat women who still aren't losing the
weight (it's an economic thing).
What's the deal with American fitness
clubs, anyway? No one at Bally's even looks
remotely like the people in their commer
cials. and these places are generally plain,
boring, smelly and grossly over-priced. Even
at Stanford, the Disneyland for smart kids,
we get a weight room with roped-off sections
for "real athletes" and some blocks we can
jump on. Or. Tresidder Fitness, the two-by
four afterthought with glass walls facing the
public restroom.
When Americans are out of shape, they
cover up. When Brazilians are out of shape,
they get their beautiful asses to the gym (or
take diet pills, but why belabor the de
tails?) and still rock bikinis at the beach. In
Rio. at least, they have got it down. The fit
ness club is a bizarre, multi-function
Utopia. The result? Hot, hot bodies, from
the guy who walks your dogs to the pre
miere dancer in Carnaval.

Brazilian fitness phenomenon and beautiful

I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
Brazilian women are hot. And for
those of you unfortunate Palo Altans
who missed Carnaval in Rio do Janeiro
lost week, I'm going to let you in on anoth
er secret.
Contrary to many popular misconcep
tions. Carnaval in Rio. unlike Mardi Ciras, is
completely devoid of drunk, beer-belly col
lege- girls flashing their untanned ta-ta's for
plastic beads. Glittery, glistening, gorgeous,
golden women parade — with enough ener
g\ to make their feet bleed and lose an easy
10 pounds by the time they're done traveling
a short 700 yards — in front of hundreds of
thousands as honored highlights of each
samba school's parade.
Wh\ are Brazilian women so hot? Why
arc black guys so good at basketball? Why
are nav men such damn good dancers?

Interesting, that the first
question is so innocuous,
while the next two are pret
ty loaded. A lot of people
just naturalize the issue and
say it's genetic. Ethnicity,
genes and recreational hob
hies get lumped together.
Although last I checked,
free-throw percentages and
stage flair aren't attached to
;inv chromosomes.

I lot women? That's got at least a little
something to do with your genes. Brazilian
women trace their chromosomes hack to in
digenous groups, Portuguese colonizers and
African slaves. They affirm my assertion that
mixed people are generally very, very hot.
The anthropologist would point out
that "Brazilian," "black" and "gay" are all
culturally constructed categories, general
izations within themselves, which is a
much more interesting approach to the
questions than searching for the actual an
swers themselves.
But I want to talk about hot women. Be
cause a big reason Brazilian women are re
puted to be so damn hot is that they actually
work out. And I'm not talking about walking
on the treadmill. Walking is only exercise if
you are over 60 years old, okay?
