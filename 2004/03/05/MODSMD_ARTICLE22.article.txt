# Baseball takes on struggling USC
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
Historically, there are not many college baseball teams
that have the upper hand over Stanford, but Southern
California is one of them; it holds a 198-150-3 all-time ad
vantage over the Cardinal. Top-ranked Stanford (13-2),
however, has taken four straight series from the Trojans
(4-7) and will look to do so again this weekend when the
team travels to Los Angeles fora three-game set begin
ning tonight.
USC is not having a typically strong year, perhaps be
cause of recent injury troubles, but that does not mean the
Trojans are not a dangerous team. The series is as big as
ever this year.
"They could turn their season around with a sweep,"
sophomore pitcher Jeff Gilmore pointed out. "They're al
ways hungry to play us ... We're two of the best pro
grams in the history of college baseball, so this series is al
ways big."
The Cardinal will have their hands full right off the bat
when freshman lan Kennedy takes the mound for the Tro
jans on Friday. Kennedy has been lights-out as the Trojans'
Friday starter this year, striking out an almost unfath
omable 32 players in only 18 innings of work and posting a
neat 1.00 ERA to run up a record of 2-0. He even closed out
USC's 2-0 win over UC-Irvine on Tuesday to earn a save.
The Cardinal may have trouble hitting Kennedy, but if
the team holds true to form, it will squeeze all it can out of
the base knocks it does get. Stanford has been remarkable
at capitalizing on its opportunities this year, scoring 124

runsononly 150 hits. For
comparison's sake, op
posing teams have man
aged only 59 runs on 128
hits.
"That's a big part of
what we try to do, seizing
our opportunities and
scoring every inning,"
said junior left fielder
Danny Putnam. "You try
to get the hall in play to
get a guy to second, take
a pitch to right or get the
two-out hit. It's all about
the little things."
Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess com
pared hitting to shoot
ing a basketball — that
both can be streaky and
if you hope to win, you
have to rely on things
that can stay more or
less constant.
"In basketball, there
are times when your
jump shot's just not

going in," Marquess said, "And hitting isa lot like that. You
might be hitting the ball hard, but hitting it right at people.
You just have to do what it takes as a team. We've seemed

to pitch well when we haven't hit, and hit well when our
pitching hasn't been there."

The Cardinal bats will face a challenge from USC ace lan Kennedy in the weekend's series.
Situational hitting has helped the
Cardinal to overcome the losses of
Ryan Garko and Carlos Quentin,
two of the best hitters in college
baseball, after both left for the
major league draft last year. The
team is averaging over eight runs
per game.
"We've had so many guys step
up," Putnam said. "Every game is
somebody else's turn."
Marquess, though pleased with
the team's ability to get move run
ners over and get clutch hits, has not
been impressed by the way it is
swinging the bats.
"At best, our hitting has been av
erage," Marquess said. "It's better

than what we've shown so far."
Marquess added that we have not
seen the pitching staffs full poten
tial either, despite its collective 3.76
ERA. The staff is an inexperienced
one — the three starters essentially
have a total of one year of game ex
perience between them — but. Mar
quess pointed out, so is everyone
else's rotation.
"Almost no teams in the Pac-10
returned their Friday starter,"
Marquess said. "Everyone has
good, young arms, but no one has
experience. The team that will win
the league is the team that does
the best job developing its pitch
ing staff."
The staff's youth will work in its
favor down the line, because the
three current starters — sophomore
Mark Romanczuk, Gilmore and
freshman Blake Holler — will all re

turn next year. For now, though,
Gilmore — who pitched only 2 1/3
innings last year — and Holler will
be learning on the fly.
But, as Marquess points out, no
one (save Romanczuk and senior
David O'Hagan, a closer) has a de
fined spot on the staff. Heralded
freshman Greg Reynolds, who has
been out with arm tendonitis, will
return after spring break and possi
bly compete fora starting spot, and
Marquess is still trying out pitchers
in various roles.
"We're still trying to figure it
out," he said. "There will be lots of
competition for action."
The Cardinal will kick of the se
ries against USC at Dedeaux Field
in Los Angeles on Friday at 6 p.m.
Opening pitches for the Saturday
and Sunday contests are scheduled
for 1 p.m.
