# Baseball takes on struggling USC
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
Historically, there are not many college baseball teams
that have the upper hand over Stanford, but Southern
California is one of them; it holds a 198-150-3 all-time ad
vantage over the Cardinal. Top-ranked Stanford (13-2),
however, has taken four straight series from the Trojans
(4-7) and will look to do so again this weekend when the
team travels to Los Angeles fora three-game set begin
ning tonight.
USC is not having a typically strong year, perhaps be
cause of recent injury troubles, but that does not mean the
Trojans are not a dangerous team. The series is as big as
ever this year.
"They could turn their season around with a sweep,"
sophomore pitcher Jeff Gilmore pointed out. "They're al
ways hungry to play us ... We're two of the best pro
grams in the history of college baseball, so this series is al
ways big."
The Cardinal will have their hands full right off the bat
when freshman lan Kennedy takes the mound for the Tro
jans on Friday. Kennedy has been lights-out as the Trojans'
Friday starter this year, striking out an almost unfath
omable 32 players in only 18 innings of work and posting a
neat 1.00 ERA to run up a record of 2-0. He even closed out
USC's 2-0 win over UC-Irvine on Tuesday to earn a save.
The Cardinal may have trouble hitting Kennedy, but if
the team holds true to form, it will squeeze all it can out of
the base knocks it does get. Stanford has been remarkable
at capitalizing on its opportunities this year, scoring 124

runsononly 150 hits. For
comparison's sake, op
posing teams have man
aged only 59 runs on 128
hits.
"That's a big part of
what we try to do, seizing
our opportunities and
scoring every inning,"
said junior left fielder
Danny Putnam. "You try
to get the hall in play to
get a guy to second, take
a pitch to right or get the
two-out hit. It's all about
the little things."
Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess com
pared hitting to shoot
ing a basketball â€” that
both can be streaky and
if you hope to win, you
have to rely on things
that can stay more or
less constant.
"In basketball, there
are times when your
jump shot's just not

going in," Marquess said, "And hitting isa lot like that. You
might be hitting the ball hard, but hitting it right at people.
You just have to do what it takes as a team. We've seemed

to pitch well when we haven't hit, and hit well when our
pitching hasn't been there."
