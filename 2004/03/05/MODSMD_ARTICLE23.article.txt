# Men's volleyball hopes for repeat magic
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Earlier this season, the No. 12 Stan
ford men's volleyball team (6-11, 3-9
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
beat the team that is now ranked No. 1 in
the couriitry.
But can they do it again? That will be
the question on everyone's minds when
the Cardinal travels south to take on
UCLA this Saturday. The same ques
tion exists for the Cardinal's less-excit
ing matchup against No. 9 UC-lrvine,
which Stanford also defeated earlier in
the season.
But things have changed since Jan. 16
and 17, when Stanford took down the Bru
ins and then the Anteaters in two thrilling
back-to-back matches in Burnham Pavil
ion. Since then, Stanford has suffered a

seven-game losing skid that included
falling to unranked Southern California in
three games.
The Cardinal put a stop to that
streak last weekend, but only by defeat
ing California, a club team, and La
Verne, a Division 111 team, in the com
fort of its own gym.
Now Stanford must not only face off
against higher caliber teams, but also do so
on the road.
"UCLA is looking good," said junior
outside hitter David Vogel, who led his
team with 16 kills in the previous matchup
against the Bruins. "And it's always hard
to play in Pauley Pavilion."
The last time the two teams met, then-
No. 11 Stanford served up an unexpect
ed upset win over then-No. 2 UCLA in
only four games. It was an accomplish
ment that in many ways has been the

highlight of the season.
Alongside the stellar play of Vogel,
junior setter Kevin Hansen lit up the
court, handing out a match-high 49 as
sists to go along with seven kills and nine
digs. On the following night, he notched
52 assists, a team-high 10 digs and three
block assists to lead his team to a 3-2 vic
tory over the Anteaters.
For his performance in those wins,
Hansen was named Molten I MPSF
Player of the Week.
Cardinal head coach Don Shaw ac
knowledged that the weekend was the
most exciting of the season.
"Those matches that weekend we
played about as well as we played all year
long," he said. "I don't think we've actual
ly played that well since. I don't think it's
that we've gotten worse, it's just that we
had an incredible weekend. It's hard to

keep up that level [of play]."
But not impossible. Shaw explained
that in some ways Stanford has improved
their skills since January, particularly with
regard to their attacking efforts.
"I think we're different [from the
team we were in January,] in that if we
pass the ball well enough, our offense is
a little bit more diverse now," he said.
"Our offense isn't quite as basic as it
was before. I think we'd be a little bit
harder to defend now, but that relies on
good passing."
According to Shaw, the Bruins have
changed a bit, too. Though their depth as a
team has improved, he says, they look in
consistent on the tape of their two-match
road split against No. 2 Hawaii.
"They're not hesitating to go to their
