# Softball faces five unranked squads in SoCal
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 10 Stanford Softball team (13-5) hopes to bounce back from a diffi
cult Arizona Tournament last week at this weekend's Worth Invitational in
Fullerton, Calif. Stanford went 2-3 in Tucson, Ariz., dropping three games to
nationally-ranked teams, including two close losses to No. 2 Arizona.
But the C ardinal should have an easier time this weekend — the squad
will play all five of its games in Fullerton against unranked teams, including
Oklahoma State, which the Cardinal dominated in a 10-0 victory last week
end in Tucson.
The Cowgirls (12-6) will be the Cardinal's first opponent in Fullerton as
Stanford takes on Oklahoma State at 10 a.m. on Friday. Stanford hopes fora
repeat of its performance against the squad last week. Oklahoma State boasts
the most wins of any of Stanford's opponents this weekend.
Friday s action will continue at 4 p.m. when the Cardinal takes on Cal State-
Northridge (10-4), a team led by ace pitcher Erin Sigala (4-0, 1.04 ERA) and
outfielders Cristen Bedwell (.400 batting average, 16 RBI) and Monique Lovell
(.381). The Cardinal holds a slim 4-3 edge in the all-time series between the two
teams after a 4-2 victory in their last meeting in 2002.
Saturday morning the Cardinal will face UC-Santa Barbara (12-11). The
Gauchos have never beaten the Cardinal; the all-time series between the two
teams is at 6-0, Stanford. The Cardinal and the Gauchos last met in 2002 when
Stanford won both games of a doubleheader, 7-2 and 8-3.
Saturday afternoon's matchup with Portland State (5-5) features another

opponent against whom the Cardinal has never lost. Stanford leads Portland
State 5-0 in the all-time series.
Sunday's game pits the Cardinal against a rebuilding Cal-State Fullerton
team (4-10) that has not played consistently all season after losing several key
seniors from last year's squad, which heat the Cardinal, 6-0, at the 2003 ASU
Fiesta Bowl Classic. The Card still retains a 9-3 edge over Fullerton in the all
time series.
The Cardinal did exhibit a few bright spots last weekend in Tucson despite
its sub-par 2-3 overall record. Junior second baseman Meghan Sickler hit .444
in the desert and, after hitting the first home run of her collegiate career on
Friday against Oklahoma State, smacked two more over the course of the
weekend to more than double her RBI output for the year. Sophomore out
fielder Catalina "Little Cat" Morris showed her usual pop at the plate and
middle-of-the-order hitters sophomore Lauren Lappin and senior Jessica Al
lister both hit home runs in Tucson.
Stanford hopes to find a little more consistency in the circle this weekend
from its one-two starting punch of senior Dana "Lightning D" Sorensen and
sophomore Laura Severson. Sorensen weathered a difficult weekend in Tuc
son, taking two losses. The staff ace must find a way to regain her form for the
Cardinal to win this weekend.
Overall, though, Stanford isn't worried yet. With both its losses against un
defeated and No. 2-ranked Arizona coming down to the final innings, the Car
dinal still needs to find what head coach John Rittman calls "the timely hit."
With the Softball team getting a week off to rest after this weekend's Worth
Invitational before the Stanford Round Robin March 20-21, the time is now.
