# Women shoot for home wins over Sun Devils, Aztecs
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The NCAA women's water polo championships aren't until May, but No. 2
Stanford (8-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has been thinking ahead
since before the season started. Planning ahead is the reason why its upcoming
conference games are being taken so seriously.
"You can't get to the NCAA Championships without doing well in the con
ference tournament," said Stanford head coach John Tanner. "These games
will determine our seeding, so they are significantly more important than a tour
nament game or a non-conference game."
After traveling up to UC-Davis (11-6) today, the Cardinal comes back home
and resumes conference play with two matches this weekend.
The Cardinal has moved up one spot in the national rankings with its second
place finish last weekend at the Gaucho Invitational in Santa Barbara where it
defeated UCLA (7-2. 1-0) hut fell to Southern California (11-0, 3-0) in the
championship game. The Cardinal is now behind only the Trojans in the na
tional polls.
it's going to be hard for us to move up [in the rankings] since we lost to
USC," Tanner said. "But we're pleased overall at how were playing.
"We know that were going to need to get better in every area of the game,"
Tanner continued. "I think we're just a little slow moving from one area of the
game to the next. The transitioning is something we can improve on."
Stanford meets No. 5 San Diego State (12-2,2-0) fora night game at Avery

Aquatic Center tomorrow. While Stanford has been on a pretty good roll late
ly, the Aztecs have been hot lately as well.
San Diego State has emerged this season with its best start in the program's
10-year history. The squad has won nine of its last 10 games and is coming off
last week's matches with a 4-1 record, which were all against top-15 teams.
The Aztecs are hoping to extend their conference record to 3-0, a mark that
the team last reached in 1997. Offensive power senior Sandy Onweller leads the
squad. Onweller presents a threat to the Cardinal, having scored 17 goals in her
last six games, including a career-high six goals in an 11-10 overtime victory
against Hawaii (7-7,1-2) last week. Onweller leads the Aztecs with 24 goals on
the season followed closely by fellow senior Holly Hartzell with 23 goals.
"Hartzell has caused us a lot of problems in the past," Tanner said. "She's a
really good goal scorer in front of the goal as well as a perimeter shooter."
San Diego State has struggled with Stanford in the past. The last time the
Aztecs defeated the Cardinal was in 1997. Stanford has the upper hand in the
all-time series, 11-4.
Tanner is hoping that his squad will be able to maintain its tradition of dom
inance against the Aztecs, but noted that it will be a tough battle this year.
"[The Aztecs have] been getting better and better each year," he said. "They're
keeping all their games really close so it's a really big concern."
On Sunday, Stanford will compete for the first time in conference play
against No. 17 Arizona State. The Sun Devils are in their first season as part of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference. This weekend marks the
team's first conference road trip.

Arizona State is looking for its first conference victory this weekend with the
help of senior Katie Davies, who has scored 24 times already. Stanford will have
to try and stop her scoring streak — Davies has scored at least one goal in each
of her last 13 games.
The Cardinal counterattacks with senior Wendy Watkins, who has also
shined on offense this season. Watkins is currently third in the conference, scor
ing an average of two goals per game.
The Cardinal will try to capitalize on the inexperience of Arizona State in
conference games.
"[Arizona State is] good. They do a nice job on counterattack. They have
some good shooters and a pretty strong goalie," Tanner said. "But they are new
to this level of competition and we'll have to sort of expose the fact that they
don't have the same depth that we have. That will certainly be an advantage
for us."

keeping all their games really close so it's a really big concern."
On Sunday, Stanford will compete for the first time in conference play
against No. 17 Arizona State. The Sun Devils are in their first season as part of
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference. This weekend marks the
team's first conference road trip.

Arizona State is looking for its first conference victory this weekend with the
help of senior Katie Davies, who has scored 24 times already. Stanford will have
to try and stop her scoring streak — Davies has scored at least one goal in each
of her last 13 games.
The Cardinal counterattacks with senior Wendy Watkins, who has also
shined on offense this season. Watkins is currently third in the conference, scor
ing an average of two goals per game.
The Cardinal will try to capitalize on the inexperience of Arizona State in
conference games.
"[Arizona State is] good. They do a nice job on counterattack. They have
some good shooters and a pretty strong goalie," Tanner said. "But they are new
to this level of competition and we'll have to sort of expose the fact that they
don't have the same depth that we have. That will certainly be an advantage
for us."
