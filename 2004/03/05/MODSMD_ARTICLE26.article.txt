# Faculty Senate bumps up med school start date by three weeks
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
I he Faculty Senate unanimously voted yesterday to start the Medical
School academic year three weeks earlier on Sept. 2. They also discussed
ways to hire more women and people of color.
I he earliei start date lor School of Medicine would he required only for
first-and second-year students.
I h f rat,onale is pretty clear â€” the students already find themselves hard
pressed to complete the program, and starting earlier seems like a good
idea, James Baron the chair on the Committee on Graduate Studies, said.
This change would bring Stanford more in line with M.D. programs at other
major medical schools and provide a less overwhelming classroom schedule
)r * f' rsl ~ second-year students who will be the primary beneficiaries
of this change.
Currently the School ot Medicine has a 30-week academic year compared
to ' wee academic years at other major medical schools.
I he School ol Medicine has also updated its curriculum to keep up with

new technologies and advancements in patient care. They have integrated
basic science class with clinical medical instruction in order to remove re
dundancy from their program. However, according to Baron, learning the
new methods and techniques that are available to doctors today puts too
great a burden on students.
"It was difficult previously to fit a year's teaching into [the current) time
frame." Baron said, "Under the new curriculum, it is impossible."
Dr. Julie Parsonnet, the senior associate dean for medical education,
added that students currently have about 30 hours of regular class time
and that they do not spend that much time pursuing research. At other
medical schools, that sort of didactic learning is a much greater component
of the program.
"We need to decompress the curriculum so there is not as much passive
learning so students can spend more time getting involved with research,"
she said.
The change to the academic year will not affect tuition. Since all the
School of Medicine lectures are videotaped, third and fourth-year students
will still be able to take certain classes that will start earlier.

In addition, students who arrive on Sept. 2 will be eligible for on-cam
pus housing.
Aside from voting to extend the School of Medicine academic year, the
Faculty Senate also discussed female faculty and faculty of color.
Of the men and women up for tenure over the last 25 years, 43.6
percent of women have gotten tenure and 40.3 percent of men have
gotten tenure, but there are over three times as many men in the
tenure track.
In addition, last year the faculty grew by 1.6 percent to 1,744 people with
109 new appointments and 80 departures. The number of faculty of color in
creased by 13 to 279 professors and the number of women increased by 14 to
394 professors.
However, Vice Provost of Faculty Development Pat Jones said that as a
percentage of total faculty that increase is statistically irrelevant.
History Prof. Albert Camarillo acknowledged that hiring more women
and minorities is an agonizingly slow process, but that there are 15 possible
appointments that could materialize into the largest number of appoint
ments of color.
