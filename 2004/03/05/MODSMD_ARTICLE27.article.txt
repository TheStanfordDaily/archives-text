# New male birth control pill may supress daily sperm production
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
A pack of birth control pills lies on the bedside table. But
the pills don't belong to the woman — they are her
boyfriend's pills. Unlikely, you might think. Well, think
again: A pharmaceutical company in the Netherlands,
Organon, is developing a pill that would suppress daily
sperm production in a pill form, which would make the idea
of a male birth control pill a reality very soon.
The pill — one of many emerging products in male birth
control — is still in development and clinical trial stages,
and may not be available in the United States fora few
years until it clears Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
approval. But the idea of a male pill may change the way
we think about birth control pills and contraceptive meth
ods in general.
Scientists at the Edinburgh University Centre for Re
productive Biology who are working on the development of
the pill recognized that desogestrel — a synthetic hormone
similar to progestin and also acts as the main component of
the female birth control pill —could block the production
of sperm.
Initially, some male birth control pills developed used
only testosterone as the primary hormone: Exogenous
testosterone (not produced by the body) can trick certain
cells in the testes not to produce certain hormones essential
to spermatogenesis, the production and maturation of
sperm. In some men, however, exogenous testosterone
alone could not sufficiently suppress spermatogenesis.
"There are racial differences in the ability of androgens
(like testosterone) to inhibit the hypothalamic-piutitary
testicular axis," said Medical School Prof. Andrew Hoff
man, who holds appointments in the endocrinology, geron
tology and metabolism departments. "This is why [prog
estins] like desogestrel are added to the regimens."
Suppressing the actions of the hypothalamic-pituitary
testicular axis, which directs reproductive hormone path
ways in the body, directly suppresses sperm production.

The combination of testosterone and desogestrel pill
has so far proven to be 100 percent effective in the com
pany's preliminary clinical trials, meaning that it would be
even more effective than the female control pill —which
has a failure rate of less than one percent, but a failure
rate nonetheless.
Birth control pills for women are widespread: The Na
tional Center for Health Statistics reported in 1995 that the
pill was the leading contraceptive method among women
under 30. Traditional birth control pills for women work by
releasing small amounts of estrogen and / or progesterone
— female steroid hormones — which suppress other hor
mones essential to egg maturation.
The male condom is also used commonly, although
many couples use both, the pill offers no protection against
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as genital warts,
genital herpes and chlamydia. The new male pill would not
prevent against any of these STIs; couples not engaged in
monogamous sex are advised to continue using a condom.
While the researchers developing the new pill claim it
will be very effective, there is a difference between absolute
effectiveness — i.e. the effectiveness of the product in labo
ratory conditions — and actual effectiveness. As with the
female birth control pill, the effectiveness of the pill is only
as good as the drug compliance of the individual: The drug
will only work if men remember to take the pill every day.
And unlike the female birth control pill, which has seven or
so placebo pills to mimic the regular female cycle, all of the
male pills in the pack would contain the active hormones,
meaning that mistakes could be costly.
According to Hoffman, some longer term male birth
control methods are in development, which may make the
daily pill unnecessary.
"Long-acting and depot-preparations are in develop
ment," Hoffman said. "Daily dosing may not be necessary."
As for side effects, "decreased testicular size may result
from this treatment, but everything should be reversible,"
he said.
Given the effort, weighty responsibility and unconven

tionality of this new pill, the question then becomes, would
men be willing to take it?
Students around Stanford had varying opinions regard
ing the pill.
Freshman Tony Cassanego said that he thought it was an
interesting concept, but that he would want to wait a few
years to determine the relative safety of the pill. When
queried if he would take the pill upon request by a girl
friend, Cassanego replied he would first rather try other,
more traditional methods of birth control.
"It would have to be discussed between the two of us,"
said Cassanego. "But I don't think I would go for it. It's just
completely different — and honestly, very odd."
Others were a little more willing to try something new —
and the idea of a male version of the pill has made them re
flect on women's birth control methods.
"Female birth control is so common," said freshman
Dave Koslow. "People just accept it as a good precaution to
take, and that's what is expected in society. Thinking about
taking the male pill has made me realize how much girls
have to go through. Women have to take a pill every single
day and have to deal with many side effects. I suppose that
if [male birth control] became more common, I would con
sider taking it."
Women surveyed on campus said they were pleased
with the idea of sharing birth control responsibilities with
their male partners.
"I think it is a great idea," said senior Iga Zelazny. "It
would be great if I could take the [female version of the] pill
half of the year and my partner could take the [male version
of the] pill the other half of the year. I don't think that I
would have a problem with trusting a future boyfriend to
take the pill. In a relationship, you either trust someone or
you don't. It has nothing to do with the birth control."
Freshman Alexandra Goldman, who is currently taking
a course on sexual health, agreed that the pill is a good in
novation, but held concerns over trusting men with such an
important responsibility.
"If men took the pill, women wouldn't have to deal

with the side effects such as gaining weight or feeling
moody," said Goldman. "At the same time, it is a huge
trust issue. Could you trust a guy on an issue where the
woman would pay for the mistake — with rather
large consequences?"
Emily Neaville, who works at the Vaden Student Health
Center's Sexual Health Peer Research Center, said she
thought it was a great new development, but was unsure
whether guys would want to take it, especially because birth
control pills, for both men and women, modify endogenous
hormone levels, i.e. changing the levels of hormones pro
duced and secreted naturally by the body.
"If the pill changes testosterone levels, I could see men
thinking 'don't mess with my manhood,"' Neaville said.
"Men may also feel unsure about blocking the production
of their sperm."
Indeed, altering hormone levels to block the production
of sperm has proven to be a challenging task for the devel
opers of new birth control methods because hormone fluc
tuations can result in undesirable side effects — including
reduced testosterone levels. Researchers at Organon have
tried to find ways to circumvent this problem. Testosterone
— the primary male sex hormone —is responsible fora lot
more than sperm production: It contributes to sex drive,
bone maintenance and muscle mass maintenance, among
many actions. Lower levels may result in fatigue, loss of
muscle or a lowered desire to have sex. Thus, the male pill
had to be tweaked in order to prevent testosterone levels
from dropping. Desogestrel was paired with testosterone in
the new pill, resulting in normal hormone levels in the consequent
clinical trials.
And for some, the development of new birth control
pills — for men or for women — is not currently a concern.
"It is good that [the pharmaceutical companies] are
coming up with an option to give the man more responsi
bility," said sophomore Matthew Grubb. "But I personal
ly don't see a need for it. I'm more of the opinion that if
you're going to be having sex, you should be prepared to
have a kid."
