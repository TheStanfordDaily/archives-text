# Demonstrators protest U.S. policy domestically and abroad

### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
In the campus' first major antiwar demonstration this
academic year, community members gathered in White
Plaza for "Books Not Bombs II,"a smaller version of last
year's student strike. An hour of cheers and speeches —
most of them focused on criticizing the foreign and do
mestic policies of President George W. Bush — was fol
lowed by a march to Hoover Tower and alternative class
es led by Stanford faculty and scholars.
"This is about holding Bush accountable," said
demonstration organizer Sofia Lee, a senior. "I mean,
he's trying to feed us the idea that this federal mar
riage amendment is the central issue of this election.
That's not what this election is about. It's about all
the people who have died in Iraq. It's about remem
bering the 2000 election and all the Florida voters
who got disenfranchised."

Organizers emphasized that one of the event's main
goals was simply to remind students of what they de
scribe as the injustices of the past two years — a theme
driven home at a poetry reading during the candlelight
vigil, which featured chants of "We refuse to forget."
The rally opened with performances by the Stanford
Mariachi Band and spoken-word artist Marc Bamuthi
Joseph. Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo gave a speech
depicting the Bush administration as waging a campaign
of fear against U.S. citizens and using the threat of ter
rorism to push through the legislation that it wants.
When Stanford janitor Doroteo Garcia spoke to the
crowd, Lee translated his words from Spanish. Garcia
argued that the war in Iraq has harmed the lives of
local workers.
"Last year, we were negotiated a new contract, and the
big companies used the pretext of hard economic times
