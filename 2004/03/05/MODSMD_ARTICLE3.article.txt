### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
In the campus' first major antiwar demonstration this
academic year, community members gathered in White
Plaza for "Books Not Bombs II,"a smaller version of last
year's student strike. An hour of cheers and speeches —
most of them focused on criticizing the foreign and do
mestic policies of President George W. Bush — was fol
lowed by a march to Hoover Tower and alternative class
es led by Stanford faculty and scholars.
"This is about holding Bush accountable," said
demonstration organizer Sofia Lee, a senior. "I mean,
he's trying to feed us the idea that this federal mar
riage amendment is the central issue of this election.
That's not what this election is about. It's about all
the people who have died in Iraq. It's about remem
bering the 2000 election and all the Florida voters
who got disenfranchised."

Organizers emphasized that one of the event's main
goals was simply to remind students of what they de
scribe as the injustices of the past two years — a theme
driven home at a poetry reading during the candlelight
vigil, which featured chants of "We refuse to forget."
The rally opened with performances by the Stanford
Mariachi Band and spoken-word artist Marc Bamuthi
Joseph. Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo gave a speech
depicting the Bush administration as waging a campaign
of fear against U.S. citizens and using the threat of ter
rorism to push through the legislation that it wants.
When Stanford janitor Doroteo Garcia spoke to the
crowd, Lee translated his words from Spanish. Garcia
argued that the war in Iraq has harmed the lives of
local workers.
"Last year, we were negotiated a new contract, and the
big companies used the pretext of hard economic times

because of
the war to

from getting
a raise," Gar
cia said. "We

know that while social services and health care are
being cut at home, the money is being used to kill
people in foreign countries."
Alumn Kuusela Hilo, Class of '03, gave a
speech describing her work for the Commit
tee on Human Rights in the Philippines; she
attributed the misery in that country to U.S.
imperialism.
Citing an earlier successful campaign by Stan
ford students to convince the University to di
vest from the Coca-Cola Company because of its
support for the apartheid government in South
Africa, Hilo said, "1 got the hell out of here last
year, but I'm back to remind you that Stanford
students have a legacy of protecting and liberat

ing people."
Sophomore Linda Tran, the event's MC,
ended the rally with a denunciation of Stanford's
Hoover Institution and the involvement of
Hoover Fellows in planning Bush's foreign poli
cy. Many of the demonstrators marched to
Hoover Tower, where they gathered in a circle
and shouted chants such as, "Whose war?
Hoover's war!"
Junior Hai Binh Nguyen urged the demon
strators on, shouting into a bullhorn, "Say it
loud! They gotta hear you upstairs!"
While many passersby simply stared at the
marching crowd, a Marguerite driver waved and
yelled. "Hey! No more war!"
The march was followed by a set of alterna
tive classes taught in the Main Quad. Faculty
teaching alternative lessons included History
Prof. Joel Beinin, History Frof. Estelle Freed
man. Japan Studies postdoctoral fellow Adri
enne Hurley, English Lecturer Emeritus Kath-

leen Namphy and Cul
tural and Social An
thropology Prof. Sylvia
Yanagisako.
History Prof. Joel
Beinin gave a lecture on

the dispute over Middle East Studies, particular
ly on recent conservative characterization of
academia being dominated by leftist, pro-Pales
tine radicals. Beinin warned against upcoming
legislation giving the federal government greater
power over the research and publications of
Middle East scholars, arguing that it was only the
first step in a larger campaign of McCarthyism.
"There's a big crowd of folks out there spend
ing a lot of energy policing what people think,
write and say about the Middle East," he said.
The evening concluded with a candlelight
vigil in front of El Centro Chicano. During the
vigil, Elena Larssen, campus minister for the
United Campus Christian Ministry, spoke to
students and urged them to remain hopeful in
their activism.
"There's a lot of ways to keep going," she
said. "One of the ways is anger. Anger, properly
channeled, can do amazing things. But it's a hard
way to live your life."
Religious Studies Prof. Thomas Sheehan
spoke briefly to the crowd, telling students that
their activism filled him with hope.
"The whole purpose of your time at a univer
sity is not just to understand and interpret the
world, but also to radically change it,"he said.
