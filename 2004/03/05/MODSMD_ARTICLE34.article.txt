### TAM VO BARRETT SHERIDAN INTERMISSION EDITORs 
WHO: Stanford students, alumni, fac
ulty, sketchy grad students.
WHAT: The Facebook
WHERE:
http://stanford.thefacebook.com

WHEN: Now! Or next
week , instead of study
ing for finals
WHY: Because you
broke up with your sig
nificant other and now
realize you don't have
any real friends; because
you weren't one of the
popular kids in high
school and want to resur
rect your self-esteem by

collecting virtual friends; or you want
to get a start on memorizing faces to
find at next year's Full Moon on the
Quad.
A dialogue on the social
significance of thefacebook.com
BS: Tarn. I know we're supposed to
talk about the Facebook, but we both
have really odd initials, don't we?
TV: Yeah, but you're not the run-of
the-mill BS that I encounter everyday.
BS: Do you encounter a lot of run-of
the-mill BS on the Facebook?
TV: No, I just don't like it because so
many people Asian fetishists stalk me.

BS: Well, aren't you
Miss Popular.
TV: Well, how manyj
friends do you have Mr. j
Sheridan?
BS: I don't know. My
total is somewhere
around 70,1 guess.
TV: Yeah, well, Mikey
Lee has you beat. He

has over 200 now. And I beat you by at
least 10.

BS: That's it. I can no longer live with
myself. I am even unpopular in the vir
tual world.
TV: That's right, Barrett. Go cry and
rock yourself to sleep in the corner.
BS: Hey, JT's "Senorita" just came on
iTunes radio. Is it wrong of me to like
that song?
TV: Yeah, you wish you could dance

like that, white boy.
BS: Okay, that's it. We
should really start talk
ing about the social sig
nificance of this site
now. What do you
think it means for the
University as a whole?
Do you think this will
improve the dating
scene?
TV: So being poked by

someone is the
equivalent of
someone saying,
"Hey, Foxy,
want to go out
with me?"
BS: Tarn, it feels
like somepin's
heatin' up, can I

leave witchoo? j cnnic K im, Intcr-
FV: Gentlemen, mission Design lia
good night. nana
BS: Ladies, good
morning.
TV: We should quote song lyrics more
often.
BS: No, we should only quote them

when we're trying to kill
'space — like now.
TV: Do you think that Ihe
: Facebook will become a
hotter trend than "The
0.C.?"
jBS: No. Where is the
Facebook equivalent of
Mischa Barton?
TV: I should punch you

right now. But since we're not in the
same place, I'll just have to poke you.
