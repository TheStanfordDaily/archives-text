## 'Havana Nights': the reason Elián braved the inner tube 
### NICOLE BECKLEY INTERMISSION WRITER 
In 1987, "Dirty Dancing" was a girl's
chocolate-sundae-daydream. Fueled by
teen angst and Patrick Swayze's hips, we
all wanted to be Baby (Jennifer Grey),
disobey our parents and gyrate to "1 Had

the Time of My Life." Why then, was there a need to res
urrect the title "Dirty Dancing" 17 years later and trans
port the story to Cuba? 1 don't know — it's like placing the
cast of "The Breakfast Club"in a school in Italy or taking
Ferris Bueller to Russia. We already had our chocolate
sundae-daydream, and we're full.
Set in 1958, and claiming to be "based on true events"
(the true events being Cuba's existence in 1958), "Ha
vana Nights" is not so much a film as it is a, slightly
longer, bad Enrique Iglesias music video. Oh wait — is
that redundant?
The film centers around an American high school se
nior, Katie, played by British actress Romola Garai (who
was probably chosen because the producers thought she'd
look enough like Cameron Diaz in the previews to per
suade people into seeing the film). When Katie's father's
job transfers him and his family to Cuba, Katie feels scared,
timid and out of her element. For about two seconds. De
nouncing the rich white kids that she's supposed to become
friends with and instead taking up with a Cuban busboy,
Katie learns that if she frees her mind, her hips will follow.
At the outset of the film, Katie is presented to us as "a
real brain" who always follows all the rules. But when she
sees Javier (Diego Luna), the busboy from her hotel, danc
ing on the street, that all changes. Just like Britney Spears
in "Crossroads," this good girl realizes she's not a girl, not
yet a woman, but she has breasts, so she might as well use
them. With a self-righteous holier-than-thou air that only
grows as the film progresses, Katie convinces Javier to

dance with her in the big dance
competition (aptly titled "The Big
Dance Competition"), in order to
compete for enough prize money
to get his family out of abject
poverty. Because as we all know,
dancing cures all, even the reign of
Bautista in communist Cuba in

the 19505. Thank God for salsa.
"Havana Nights" wants to give us a sense of the politi
cal drama that was unfolding at the time, but it is about as
successful in this attempt as "A Knight's Tale" was in ac
curately depicting the Middle Ages. The film also offers a
subplot involving Katie's mother (Sela Ward), who sacri
ficed her own dancing dreams to raise her two daughters
— a sacrifice which, quite frankly, she regrets. While this
should elicit sympathy from the viewer and create cross
generational tension, it merely causes one to question the
intelligence of Sela Ward's agents.
Besides the trite dialogue and weak story line, the real
problem of the film seems to be Garai herself. Where Jen
nifer Grey was able to display a sort of fierce presence in
the first "Dirty Dancing," Garai has none of that. Not only
does her character lack credibility, she comes off as insin
cere. Garai suffers from the Piper Perabo ("Coyote Ugly")
Complex: She's beautiful, but you can't empathize with
her. Luckily, this can be remedied with two simple words:
acting lessons.
We have to believe that "Havana Nights" was made as
a lame excuse to get to play salsa music, to have brightly
colored costumes and to give Patrick Swayze something to
do. Poor guy.
Don't get me wrong, the film does have its good points.
There's dancing. Other than that, the only other really
striking feature of the film is Diego Luna's lower lip, which
almost makes it worth watching the trailer. But definitely
not the film.


May I sniff your forehead, please?
