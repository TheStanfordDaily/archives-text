# Shouldn't it be 'Shaolin Football'? Only in America...
## 
### JOHN HOLGATE INTERMISSION WRITER 
Two soccer players soar through the air passing the ball be
tween them as they leap over defenders and then nail the ball past
a diving goalie into the net. "Wow, how'd they do that?!? asks
another player on the team.
"It must be the special effects!" exclaims another.
"Shaolin Soccer," Hong Kong's most successful movie ever,
thrives on this sort of tongue-in-cheek humor and the gravity-de
fying special effects that you would expect to see in a martial arts
film. Hong Kong's most successful moviemaker, Stephen Chow,

wrote, directed, produced and starred in this hilarious blend of
soccer, parody and the ancient art of Shaolin.
The setup is simple: Six young followers of the Shaolin disci
pline have lost their way in life, except for Sing (Chow). With the
help of a crippled coach, Sing convinces the other brothers to
form a soccer team in order to demonstrate their brilliant abilities
and take on the creatively named Team Evil in an open soccer
competition. Each brother wields an all-powerful but unusual tal
ent that lends itself to the team's success. Their unique abilities
also get tons of laughs and showcase some amazing stunts. Shin,
with the power of his "steel leg," dents the goal frame with his
kicks, scoring from midfield with ease. Another brother, with the

power of his "hooking leg," break dances like a freak, simultane
ously dribbling the ball in crazy patterns and generally kicking ass.
You'll just have to watch for yourself to see what the "weight

vest," "iron head,"
and "empty hand"
brothers can do. The
movie is a nice twist on
the traditional martial
arts movie, replacing
most of the fighting
with intense soccer
games and soaring
special effects.

The movie was originally released several years ago, but it was
never distributed in the United States after complaints arose
about how the movie was dubbed. The subtitles work well and
allow the original comedic acting to shine through. However, the
whole delay has somewhat detracted from the movie's appeal, as
some of the special effects have been eclipsed in the past few
years, and many of the jokes aimed at contemporary targets fall a
little flat now. But the humor remains the film's best aspect. You
can only imagine the fun everyone had off stage, because it seems
like the cast could barely muffle their laughter until the cameras
stopped rolling. The entire film seems like one big inside joke be
tween the cast and their audience, something that's rarely
achieved in comedies.
You'll be hard pressed to find a movie that combines visual
brilliance with great comedic touches quite as well as "Shaolin
Soccer." The movie is beautifully subtle, drawing its laughs with
out hammering you over the head with sarcastic jokes. So go
check out the movie when you're in need of a laugh and discover
the ancient art of Shaolin. Maybe one day you too will be able to
soar through the air with the help of special effects.
