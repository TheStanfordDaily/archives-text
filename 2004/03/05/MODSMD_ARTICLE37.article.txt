# Attention LOTR nerds: Lord Aragorn is in the house
## 
### BEATRICE KIM INTERMISSION WRITER 
I'm in the top floor "secret" suite at
the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco,
waiting my turn to talk to "Hidalgo"
star Viggo Mortensen (better known
as Aragorn from "The Lord of the
Rings" trilogy) and director Joe John
ston ("Jumanji," "October Sky").
Viggo walks in, shoeless, carrying a
pot of herbal tealeaves. His hair is
blond and spiked and he wears an old
fuzzy sweater over a tattered
"NAALA 2002 Youth and Family" t
shirt. Seeing him face-to-face, his light
eyes blending with his very non-
Aragorn blonde hair, he looks a lot
shorter and much more like his 45-
year-old self than I was expecting.
Before anything else, he whispers,
"Let's go outside. Be careful, don't get
hurt or I'll be in trouble." He leads us
out through the window to the roof of
the hotel, running and looking behind
him like a little kid. He hunches over
to whisper: "Last time I did this [the
woman running the press junket] got
mad. Is everyone OK?"
Mortensen's newest movie, "Hidal
go," is set in 1890. It is based on the
true life of Frank Hopkins, a Pony Ex
press courier who travels to the deserts
of Saudi Arabia to participate in a
10,000-mile horse race with his trusty
mustang Hidalgo. Mortensen stars as
Hopkins, a man who is haunted by his
past with the Native American people.
What first attracted Mortensen to the
role was the background story, the
same reason he gave for being in the
LOTR trilogy. Both stories, he says,
"extol the value of finding a common
ground with others, especially with
those who seem different and with
those you disagree with."
He realizes the importance of the
success of the LOI R trilogy and the
role it played in helping him get his
choice of roles. "I've been in two pro
jects in a row, which is incredibly
lucky. Most people don't even get to
be in one. It'd be hard to top it, 1
should probably quit while I'm
ahead." He laughs.
After being in the biz for 20 years,
how does he view this sudden rush of
popularity? "Some people get that at
tention, find that they like it and then

that becomes the reason for working
and then they base their selection on
that. You know, 'I need to stay on top,
I better do another huge movie, or it
must be a lead character.'
"1 don't have those things in mind.
I've gotten more attention than I
would have wanted in several life
times in the past couple of years and
it's like, you know, I'm trying to make
the most out of an unusual situation
that I have no doubt will pass. In the
next couple of years, they'll move on
to somebody else."
With such modesty, I had to turn to
Johnston for praise about Mortensen.
"Viggo is an amazing actor, incred
ibly funny. There were times when I
wished this movie were a comedy be
cause he made so many things that
happened funny. What we were doing
was so difficult, he was just helping us
keep things light."
Viggo's professionalism as an actor
also earned Johnston's respect.
"We were shooting some scene,
and for some reason there was a
longer lens on the camera so 1
couldn't get that close to him. 1 was
watching him; he was, like, 10 feet
away, and 1 remember thinking, 'He's
not doing anything, he's not even
moving his face.'
"We went to dailies the next day
and we were looking at the scene on J
a 20-foot screen, where his face is /
now six feet high, and he's doing all /
kinds of things, these amazing, sub- /
tie things. He knew that it would /
show on a 20-foot screen. He's a /
very technical actor in that way, he V,
knows the camera. He knew what \
lens was on the camera and he knew
not to overplay it. I saw him a couple
of times look at the camera to see
what lens was on it. Stuff that most ac
tors should know but it's too bad that
they don't."
A poet, artist and photographer,
Viggo has released three jazz CDs,
publishedseveral books of poetry and
showcased his art and photography
around the world, most recently in
New York and Denmark. He's a pet
lover too — at the end of the shoot, he
bought one of the five horses that por
tray Hidalgo in the film.
Apparently, some people can have
their cake and eat it too.


A rare cosmic disturbance brings World War I hero King Faisal of Saudi Arabia
face-to-face with Indiana Jones.

After being in the biz for 20 years,
how does he view this sudden rush of
popularity? "Some people get that at
tention, find that they like it and then

that becomes the reason for working
and then they base their selection on
that. You know, 'I need to stay on top,
I better do another huge movie, or it
must be a lead character.'
"1 don't have those things in mind.
I've gotten more attention than I
would have wanted in several life
times in the past couple of years and
it's like, you know, I'm trying to make
the most out of an unusual situation
that I have no doubt will pass. In the
next couple of years, they'll move on
to somebody else."
With such modesty, I had to turn to
Johnston for praise about Mortensen.
"Viggo is an amazing actor, incred
ibly funny. There were times when I
wished this movie were a comedy be
cause he made so many things that
happened funny. What we were doing
was so difficult, he was just helping us
keep things light."
Viggo's professionalism as an actor
also earned Johnston's respect.
"We were shooting some scene,
and for some reason there was a
longer lens on the camera so 1
couldn't get that close to him. 1 was
watching him; he was, like, 10 feet
away, and 1 remember thinking, 'He's
not doing anything, he's not even
moving his face.'
"We went to dailies the next day
and we were looking at the scene on J
a 20-foot screen, where his face is /
now six feet high, and he's doing all /
kinds of things, these amazing, sub- /
tie things. He knew that it would /
show on a 20-foot screen. He's a /
very technical actor in that way, he V,
knows the camera. He knew what \
lens was on the camera and he knew
not to overplay it. I saw him a couple
of times look at the camera to see
what lens was on it. Stuff that most ac
tors should know but it's too bad that
they don't."

Viggo has released three jazz CDs,

showcased his art and photography
around the world, most recently in
New York and Denmark. He's a pet
lover too — at the end of the shoot, he
bought one of the five horses that por

I'm in the top floor "secret" suite at
the Ritz Carlton in San Francisco,
waiting my turn to talk to "Hidalgo"
star Viggo Mortensen (better known
as Aragorn from "The Lord of the
Rings" trilogy) and director Joe John
ston ("Jumanji," "October Sky").
Viggo walks in, shoeless, carrying a
pot of herbal tealeaves. His hair is
blond and spiked and he wears an old
fuzzy sweater over a tattered
"NAALA 2002 Youth and Family" t
shirt. Seeing him face-to-face, his light
eyes blending with his very non-
Aragorn blonde hair, he looks a lot
shorter and much more like his 45-
year-old self than I was expecting.
Before anything else, he whispers,
"Let's go outside. Be careful, don't get
hurt or I'll be in trouble." He leads us
out through the window to the roof of
the hotel, running and looking behind
him like a little kid. He hunches over
to whisper: "Last time I did this [the
woman running the press junket] got
mad. Is everyone OK?"
Mortensen's newest movie, "Hidal
go," is set in 1890. It is based on the
true life of Frank Hopkins, a Pony Ex
press courier who travels to the deserts
of Saudi Arabia to participate in a
10,000-mile horse race with his trusty
mustang Hidalgo. Mortensen stars as
Hopkins, a man who is haunted by his
past with the Native American people.
What first attracted Mortensen to the
role was the background story, the
same reason he gave for being in the
LOTR trilogy. Both stories, he says,
"extol the value of finding a common
ground with others, especially with
those who seem different and with
those you disagree with."
He realizes the importance of the
success of the LOI R trilogy and the
role it played in helping him get his
choice of roles. "I've been in two pro
jects in a row, which is incredibly
lucky. Most people don't even get to
be in one. It'd be hard to top it, 1
should probably quit while I'm
ahead." He laughs.
