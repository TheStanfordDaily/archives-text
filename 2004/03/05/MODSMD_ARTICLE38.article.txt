# Meet the cast of STARSKY AND HUTCH
## Starring Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson 
### RAMIN SETOODEH INTERMISSION WRITER 
MARINA DEL REY, Calif.—"Starsky and
Hutch," the television show, is more dated than
lava lamps. Can you still dig it? Ben Stiller and

Owen Wilson say you can — as a movie. The
two lead actors, along with some of their co
stars, answered our burning questions last

month at the Ritz-Carlton just outside
Los Angeles.
Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson have
worked together on at least four movies —

The Royal Tenenbaums," "ZooJander,"
"Meet the Parents" and "Permanent Mid
night" — andfive, if you count "The Cable
Guy," which Stiller directed. Now comes
number six: The two star as cop partners in
"Starsky & Hutch."

QUESTION: How did the two of you
first meet?
BEN STILLER: I met Owen when he
I came in to audition for "Cable Guy."

He was so funny and so unique.
OWEN WILSON: Not funny enough

for you to totally think you were going
to cast me.
BS: I was a little concerned. He had

the best audition, but he also had
this spark or something. My co-pro
ducer convinced me to take a shot.

Q:Would you describe "Starsky
and Hutch" as a remake or a

spoof?
OW: You know, we grew up watching that show
and so we didn't want to do a total spoof. But yet,

it's going to be me and Ben reinterpreting the
characters. A lot of stuff that might seem like a
parody is in the show; one time 1 think [the original
Starsky and Hutch] go undercover as mimes.
BS: We didn't want it to be 100 goofy. We didn't
want it to be a broad 70s spoof. The way that [di
rector Todd Phillips] described it was that this
could be the pilot for "Starsky and Hutch" and
then they fired us.
Q: You did some of your own car stunts in the film?
BS: I got to spend a couple days in the parking lot.
1 really had a good time. And I know Owen en

joyed sitting shotgun next to me.
OW: That's not true. One day, we were filming at
Paramount and we drove a car off the set and out
on the street. People started freaking out.
BS: That's because we were at Santa Monica Boule
vard. They thought we were looking for action.
Q: What other TV remake would you want to
star in?
OW: 1 don't know I'd want to be in it, but I loved
"Miami Vice."
BS: "The Munsters." I'd play either Eddie or
Herman.
Q: Is comedy hard?
OW: I don't go to comedy clubs. It's more
what 1 find funny is stuff I find in real life, real

situations.
BS: I wasn't a class clown as a kid. 1 real
ly resisted it fora long time because my

parents were comedians, and I didn't
want to do that.

Q: This is your sixth movie togeth
er. What have you learned?
BS: I learned that Owen... there's
not much to learn about Owen,
he's a surface kind of guy. No. He's
fun to hang out with. We'd laugh a

lot. We have a comfortability with *
each other because we've known each
other for years.

()W:The comfortability that Ben just spoke

of, a lot of our comedy comes from that
comfortability.




Ah, the '70s. I wasn't alive for 'cm. but I sure do
miss 'cm.
