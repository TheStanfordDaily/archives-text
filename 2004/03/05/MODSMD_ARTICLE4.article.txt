# ITSS to layoff employees, outsource jobs
## 
### JANET YU 
To meet budget constraints. Information Tech
nology Systems and Services (ITSS) has drafted a
plan to outsource a number of its technical tasks. In
the past months, some employees have already been
laid off.
"It's very difficult to lay off dedicated employ
ees who have given so much to the University,"' said
Chief Information Officer Chris Handley. "I'm
very aware how layoffs affect not only the person
losing his or her job, but also the people he or she
has served."
Decisions to outsource work are made by Hand
ley in conjunction with the ITSS management team
and are reviewed by senior University management.
ITSS provides the Stanford community with a
computing and communication infrastructure to sup
port academic, business and administrative activities.
There are currently about 450 people on staff. Ac
cording to Handley, only four positions have been re
placed with off-shored services by an American com
pany's branch in another country.
"In ITSS's case, outsourcing can cost about half of
what the services cost if they are provided with in
house staff," Handley remarked.
Employees were notified in a memo that the pres
ident and provost expect the centrally funded por
tion of ITSS's annual budget to be reduced by four
million dollars over the next two years. To accom
modate, ITSS will utilize off-shoring to bring about
"significant expense reductions, the ability to accom
plish more outcomes with few resources and work
force stabilization by avoiding staffing for peak needs
and then laying staff off."
Handley added, "Outsourcing is also a viable and ef
fective tool because it allows us to access very special
bed services for however long we need those services."
