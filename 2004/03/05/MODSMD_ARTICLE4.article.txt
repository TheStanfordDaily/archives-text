# ITSS to layoff employees, outsource jobs
## 
### JANET YU 
To meet budget constraints. Information Tech
nology Systems and Services (ITSS) has drafted a
plan to outsource a number of its technical tasks. In
the past months, some employees have already been
laid off.
"It's very difficult to lay off dedicated employ
ees who have given so much to the University,"' said
Chief Information Officer Chris Handley. "I'm
very aware how layoffs affect not only the person
losing his or her job, but also the people he or she
has served."
Decisions to outsource work are made by Hand
ley in conjunction with the ITSS management team
and are reviewed by senior University management.
ITSS provides the Stanford community with a
computing and communication infrastructure to sup
port academic, business and administrative activities.
There are currently about 450 people on staff. Ac
cording to Handley, only four positions have been re
placed with off-shored services by an American com
pany's branch in another country.
"In ITSS's case, outsourcing can cost about half of
what the services cost if they are provided with in
house staff," Handley remarked.
Employees were notified in a memo that the pres
ident and provost expect the centrally funded por
tion of ITSS's annual budget to be reduced by four
million dollars over the next two years. To accom
modate, ITSS will utilize off-shoring to bring about
"significant expense reductions, the ability to accom
plish more outcomes with few resources and work
force stabilization by avoiding staffing for peak needs
and then laying staff off."
Handley added, "Outsourcing is also a viable and ef
fective tool because it allows us to access very special
bed services for however long we need those services."
Some view this as a negative aspect
of outsourcing.
"There's a lot of work to do to stabi
lize our new financial system," said a
former ITSS employee who was laid
off last year and requested to remain
anonymous. "Yet, instead of keeping
the staff and have them work on these
issues — most have been working on
the system for two to three years and
know it very well — the majority were
laid off."
A memo sent out to School of
Medicine faculty yesterday men
tioned that problems with the system
are "significantly impacting the abili
ty of the finance and administration
staff to perform their normal job
functions and to provide accurate fi
nancial information."
Stanford has hired external organi
zations both in the United States and
other countries to support ITSS in the
past, Handley said. Other outsourced
areas include Benefits Management
for employees and Electronic Admis
sions for prospective students.
Nine months ago, after the Peo
ple Soft projects were completed,
the organization was reduced by 20

to 30 employees and the bulk of sup
port and enhancement work moved
offshore. Other categories of work
are currently being considered for
future outsourcing.
"Once the project is over, as a
thank you gesture, you get laid off,"
the former ITSS employee continued.
He described those still employed by
ITSS as having "no future growth, no
long term relationship, no hope" in
their work environment.
The problems with oflshoring
One of the main issues with off
shoring is the security of private data
being sent to other countries. Accord
ing to another former ITSS employee,
who asked to remain unidentified,
"While there is no reason why any
given non-U.S. citizen is less scrupu
lous than a U.S. citizen, it is far more
difficult to prosecute somebody out
side the U. 5.," making illegal use of
personal information more tempting.
ITiere are plans in an upcoming
project to move confidential student data
to servers overseas, said a concerned cur
rent employee, who asked to remain
anonymous. Handley responded by say
ing that sensitive data, such as social se
curity numbers, is being scrambled,
which is beyond what most firms do.
To deal with language and cultural
issues that accompany working with a

foreign group, ITSS has been working
with Forrester Research.
Nevertheless, some frustrations
with offshoring have already presented
themselves. A current employee ob
served that ITSS has not figured out
how to appropriately handle working
with another company overseas be
cause work procedures need to be
more formal for tasks to be done well.
"You have to be very specific about
how something needs to be fixed. You
expect a certain level of expertise, but
we've found that to be lacking and end
up doing 'repair work' here." she elab
orated. "1 don't necessarily think that
off-shoring is bad, but like anything
else, when it's badly done, it's destruc
tive ... There's not quite the level of
oversight there should be."
Another problem is that the turn
around time to fix bugs in ITSS systems
significantly increases when its resolu
tion relies on a non-local employee
whose knowledge of the systems isn't
as deep, a former employee added.
"Faculty have worked extremely
hard to get here and build a career in a
non-corporate environment. They do
not expect to use generic systems —
they want systems tailored to the exact
needs of academia," he commented.
"This is, in fact, what they had until the
recent move from our in-house sys
tems to off-the-shelf products such as
People Soft and Oracle Financials."

"The constant and impending
threat of losing our jobs has made
morale within ITSS abysmal," he con
tinued. When he first came to ITSS, "it
was by far the best job I had ever had.
When I left, it was by far the worst."
A survey conducted last year by A
Great Place to Work Institute showed
that 37 percent of those who responded
felt that overall, ITSS was a great place
to work — a relatively low percentage
compared to other averages.
"Most people love Stanford as an
institution, yet they hate the current
conditions in ITSS," he noted. A cur
rent employee agreed, saying that
there is a lot of uncertainty among em
ployees about what outsourcing means
for their function at work and whether
they will have a job at all.
Handley said that ITSS manage
ment is aware of how the staff s moti
vation affects their work.
"It creates an energy and collegiali
ty that serves the ITSS mission and the
University community," Handley said.
"But we must also provide services in a
cost-efficient manner to ensure that the
institution's primary resources are di
rected, first and foremost, to the central
teaching and learning initiative rather
than support functions."
A national issue
Offshoring has also become a hot

topic of debate in the political and in
dustrial arenas, with people on both
sides of the argument.
Not only does off-shoring present
the possibility of lowering costs fora
company, but "in many countries with
a small number of jobs overall for
well-educated people, it gives them
opportunities they might not other
wise have in satisfaction and pay,"
commented Jim Sweeney, a professor
in the Management Science and Engi
neering department.
Sweeney teaches courses in micro
economic theory and natural re
sources. Customers also benefit
through a higher quality of service,
since companies can afford to hire
more people than they could have in
the United States.
"If you recognize that the outsourc
ing of white-collar jobs is fundamental
ly no different than the outsourcing of
physical goods, you realize that the
process has been going on since the lib
eralization of trade in the 1930s and
19405," Sweeney said.
Opponents of off-shoring have
suggested protectionist measures to
battle unemployment.
"1 don't think it's a good policy,"
Sweeney countered, "because the long
term problems exceed the short term
benefits. When we restrict imports,
other countries usually find ways of re
taliating and nobody wins."

Economics Prof. Roger Noll sug
gested that in the short-term, the loss
of jobs at ITSS has nothing to do with
the general outsourcing debate
going on in the rest of the country.
As an organization within an institu
tion with a hiring and pay freeze,
"ITSS has a very hard time hiring
and retaining first-rate people. With
in the current constraints, they just
can't do it."
Nationwide, Noll added, the out
sourcing phenomena is a small per
centage of job loss and only a small per
centage of what companies do.
Although technical outsourcing is
relatively new, most universities
have been outsourcing jobs such as
maintenance, gardening and trash
collection, Noll said, though the de
gree of it varies with the strength of
local labor unions.
ITSS management is meeting with
Ivy League colleagues in April to dis
cuss outsourcing. Handley said. Future
plans include having an executive
steering committee look at ITSS issues
on a University wide basis.
"We want to make sure we are
doing what is best for the entire
University," Handley said. "No
one. least of all me, wants to elimi
nate jobs, but information technolo
gy is an area in which we must re
main flexible and our skills mix
needs are changing."
