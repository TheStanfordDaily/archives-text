## 
### 
Rapper. Film
star. MTV personality. v .v. *-v.
Snoop Dogg has worn many hats throughout
i his career. Now he stars as Huggy Bear, an in- \
I formant who works with Starsky and Hutch.
0: Antonio Fargas played the original Huggie Bear

in the TV series. Ever watch him?
SNOOP I)OGG:A whole lot. Because seeing him

on TV in the early 19705, he was a cool dude. He
helped us pattern ourselves and give us something to
reach for as kids. When I had the opportunity to play this char- l
acter, I wanted to bring him to life for those who didn't know'

him. But at the same time, I wanted to have the Snoop
Dogg element — with the pinky ring and the hair being pret
ty and doing all the exciting things that I do.
Q: So, this is sort of like a period piece for vou — no?
, SI): You really had to know the slingo and the lingo. The emphasis I put\

in the character was, I felt like 1 was really in the 70s when 1 was doing this \
. shit. 1 wasn't on nothing but the 70s. I was watching 70s movies, I was'
k there. I wasn't about what was going on right now.

l Q: As a child, is this the life you envisioned for yourself?

SD: I think 1 dreamed of being an athlete first. 1 wanted

to be a football player or a basketball player. And
then eventually being a musician or an actor. We
™ all have crazy dreams coming from the ghetto
being a child from the 70s.

Q: And now, a Barbara Walters question: Tell us about
your parents.
SI): My pops was in the Vietnam war in 1969. He got shot
three times. I was born in 1971, so imagine all that shit
going down with him.

! Q: Is Snoop Dogg the rapper also a character for you?
f SI): 1 don't think he's a character. I think I'm Su
perman. 1 come out of the booth with my cape on.

. 0: Any thoughts on the Super Bowl scandal?
k SI): Yeah, they should have had me performing.
A I'd probably would have pulled my... nah.
