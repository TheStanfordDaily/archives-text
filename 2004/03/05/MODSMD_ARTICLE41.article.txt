# Carmen Electra as Staci
## 
### 
Carmen Electra got her big break when
she replaced Jenny McCarthy on the MTV
dating show "Singled Out." In "Starsky &
Hutch," she plays Staci — a cheerleader who
shakes her pom poms with Amy Smart and
the guys.

QUESTION: How did you and Amy Smart work
together as cheerleaders?
CARMEN ELECTRA: When 1 went into the [au-

dition] room with Amy. it felt good. It felt right. I
had a big smile on my face, and I was so excit-

Ed when I got the call and Amy was going
to be cast as my friend. I get to kiss
Amy?! How many guys are going to be
jealous?

Q: Any history as a cheerleader?
i CE: I'd never cheered before, believe
it or not. I just studied dance. We
didn't even have a football team at our
school. But I always wanted to be a
cheerleader.

Q: You married musician Dave Navarro
and your wedding was filmed as an

MTV reality show. How

was that?

CE: It premiered as the highest
rated MTV show in history. So

we're very happy. That was so great about
doing our show, they only wanted to film us
when we wanted to do wedding stuff. So they
weren't there 24 / 7. It made it easier for us.

Q: Any advice to future brides?
CE: It was really stressful because I'm not much for
details. I just like everything to be really easy. Dave

thank God, he was like the bride — he was into the j

details. If I were to ever do it again, which I hope

not, I'd really be more involved than I was.

Q: Do you see a future for yourself inl
reality TV? 1
CE: We've actually thought of a tape we
want to release on the Internet. Kind of
like a Paris Hilton project.
Q: What does Carmen Electra do in

her free time?
CE: I play Scrabble.
Q: Longest word?
CE: I can't remember. But I've

had some pretty
long ones.
