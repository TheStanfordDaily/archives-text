What's new
* The Outerna
tionalists, a new

project from Simon Emmerson
(formerly of the Afro-Celts) and
producer Phil Meadley, put out
their first album, entitled "Eth
nomixocology." The title de
scribes the music perfectly. This is
good dance fusion, mixing techno
beats with music from around the
world. You'll hear everything
from sultry oriental singing to folk
guitar loops to bagpipes.
* "All People Is My Friends" is the
name of DJ Koze's newest release.
This is another mix album, and it
takes a little while to develop. It
takes eight minutes for you to get a
steady beat on the album, but once
it starts up it begins to kick your
ass. The last half of the CD is full of
good 4/4 beats and tight synth
lines.
* Greg Davis makes pretty music
that can also be pretty boring.
"Curling Pond Woods" is his third
album of "laptop folk," a style that
mixes dance-oriented beats with
warm, live instrumentation. Davis
was originally trained as a jazz and
classical guitarist, and you can tell.
It's pleasant stuff to listen to, but
won't do much to excite you.
Bands to check out
* Plej rocks. "Electronic Music
From the Swedish Left coast" has

great beats with lots of funk and
soul. Signed to the British label
Exceptional, Plej's first album
shows great promise. This is most
ly house and down-tempo stuff,
but you'll hear a lot of funk guitar
and bits of horns and trumpets that
sound great.
What I've been listening to
* DJ Frane has blown my mind
away. "The Electric Garden of
Delights" is easily one of the best
albums I have heard in a few years.
Frane takes off where DJ Shadow
left off, but what sets this album
apart is its cohesive flow. Each
track leads beautifully into the
next, one stoner beat follows an
other and it's hard to find a point
where you want to hit the skip but
ton. I don't know quite how to con
vey the awesomeness of this
album. It's beyond organized.
Concerts
* If any of you kids are sticking
around here for spring break,
check out Kid Koala, Bonobo,
and Anion Tobin on March 26.
They're all going to be playing at
the Mezzanine in San Francisco.
This looks like it's gonna be a hel
luva show. This is only a ten-stop
tour, so check it out before it dis
appears. Kid Koala is nasty on
the turntables, while Bonobo and
Amon Tobin put out some of the
most beautiful down-tempo
you'll ever hear. Label-mates Six
too. Blockhead and Diplo will be
there too, if you need more rea
son to go.
