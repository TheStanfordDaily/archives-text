# The 						horse and his boy

### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION WRITER 
Whenever I hear about a film that is "based on a true story," I al
ways cringe. Instead of a deep, arousing film that fleshes out the real
people and events that inspire it all, we end up watching the same Hol
lywood crap that does anything it can to create a cheap thrill while hid
ing behind its creative license. Such is "Hidalgo," Touchstone's
newest flick about a man, his horse and a race for personal redemp
tion. It had the potential to be something big, but instead it took the
easy way out with a film filled with unnecessary action that drives the
plot into unrealistic territory.
"Hidalgo" stars Viggo Mortensen as Frank Hopkins, a Pony Express
courier who's known for his impressive streak of long distance races
won with his horse. Hidalgo. When offered a chance to race in"The
Ocean of Fire," a race across the Arabian Desert, Hopkins decides to
accept the invitation and takes a ship across the Atlantic. Why would a
1890s cowboy decide to travel halfway across the world for chance to
win a meager sum of money in a race across a giant desert that would

probably kill him?
Well, it's mostly for personal redemption
and proving to the world that Hidalgo, a
mixed blood Mustang, isn't inferior to all
the other "pure blood" horses that will be
racing. I suppose this is a noble cause, but
it doesn't translate very well on screen.
This leads up to the next big question
about the movie: How do you take two
hours of footage showing a horse running
through the sand and make it exciting? It's
easy enough, just throw in a bunch of bor
ing special effects and subplots which de
tract even further from the already dwin
dling experience of the film. One scene
has the duo running away from a giant

sandstorm that just mysteriously ap
pears out on the horizon. It looks sort of
cool, but it's just a blatant rip-off from
"The Mummy."
There are also about seven scenes
that feature all the residents of the

desert trying to shoot at Hopkins and his horse. Apparently, the fact that
an American is racing in an Arabian race has perturbed a few people. I
got the message after the second time he was shot at; 1 don't need to be
constantly reminded.
There are a few storylines that attempt to keep the audience in
terested, but, like the rest of the movie, they're boring and cliched.
Let's use the story of the Sheikh of Sheikhs as an example. He, like
everyone else at the beginning of the film, hates Hopkins with a pas
sion. This is because Hopkins is considered an infidel to the people of
this region.
Actually, the only interesting plot line in the movie is the relation
ship between Hopkins and the Muslim community, but even this is
tainted by Hollywood. The Sheikh's daughter falls for Hopkins and,
by the end of the movie, almost every one that hated the American
has grown to love him for reasons unknown â€” big surprise.
Speaking of surprises, guess who wins the race? Well, 1 won't spoil

it, but let's just say that Hidalgo features
the most unrealistic, tedious race finish
ever. The epilogue attempts to redeem the
rest of the movie by inserting a few emo
tional scenes, but no cigar.
Simply put, "Hidalgo" is boring,
predictable, cliched and just not worth
your seven bucks. I don't care how hard
you try at the end of it to make it all better,
it's not going to work in an industry that
has seen this same formula a thousand
times. If you're really curious, then rent it
when it comes out or convince an unsus
pecting friend to shell out the cash to see it.
I suggest you avoid it like the bubonic
plague, since you've already seen it before.


Arc you scared? Looks a little bit like the KKK to us.
