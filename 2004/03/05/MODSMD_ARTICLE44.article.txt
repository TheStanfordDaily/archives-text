# Don't forget about ... Circulatory System

### MIKE ORME INTERMISSION WRITER 
Nestled in the heart of the deep South, in the musical oasis
of Athens, Ga., a mysterious musical collective is growing. Its
members live communally in Candyland-style houses
adorned with colored tinfoil, toys and old records of all vari
eties. Its founders share an ingenuous adoration of 60s pop
and a zealous devotion to their own music. It counts among its
membership progenitors of the 10-fi musical movement such
as Apples in Stereo, Beulah and Neutral Milk Hotel. This is
the Elephant 6 Collective.
At the center of the Elephant 6, surrounded by cultish
mystery, is the collective's leader William Cullen Hart. Hart
started the collective with friends Jeff Mangum (of Neutral
Milk Hotel) and Robert Schneider (of the Apples in Stereo)
while in high school and fronted seminal psychedelic pop
group the Olivia Tremor Control in the 90s. However, Hart's

most striking work has come out of the ashes of the Olivia
Tremor Control with his new group. Circulatory System.
Circulatory System's self-titled 2002 debut is an atmos
pheric balance of pop and experimentalism that Olivia
Tremor Control's last album, 19%'s "Black Foliage: Anima
tion Music Vol. 1," only hinted at. The opening piece. "Yes
terday's World," serves as an effective thesis statement, fea
turing a shimmering verse with fuzzy guitars, clarinets and
seemingly just about every percussive element the Elephant
6ers could find.
The twenty-two tracks clock in at a surprisingly lean 57
minutes because many of the tracks are under two minutes
long. However, there are no underdeveloped ideas here; all
the tracks from the minute-long "Fingers" to the six-minute
tracks "Outside Blasts" and "Inside Blasts" work as fully
formed pop gems.
However, Circulatory System represents a drastic depar
ture from the 10-fi rock of Olivia Tremor Control and other
Elephant 6 work. Whereas the Olivia Tremor Control albums
take their pop with a light-hearted, four-tracked bombast,
Circulatory System is dark and meticulously orchestrated.
Collaborators such as Neutral Milk Hotel's Mangum con
tribute horns, various stringed instruments, and vocals to an
album which boasts at times 60 or more instruments on a song.
The results are astounding.
The album takes strange twists through musings on time
and space, all focused through the conceptual unity of a single
Brian Wilson-esque guitar riff repeated throughout. The two
song series "Now" and"A Peek" offer Middle Eastern-influ
enced instrumentation a la the Beatles' "Within You Without
You," with Hart tracking himself about ten times over to cre
ate a ghostly choir of his own voice.
Some of the strangest tracks also prove to be the
strongest. "The Lovely Universe" and "Waves of Bark and
Light" come off like romps through a magical, turn-of-the
century space trip. The shanty "Illusions" dances around a
sweet, stoned guitar figure. Finally, the campfire singalong
"Forever" ends the album like a solemn hymn to the strange
Elephant 6 gods.
Luckily for us. Hart has continued his Circulatory System
project with fruitful results. Be sure to check out Hart's psych
pop brilliance and let yourself be drawn in by the mystical
world of the Elephant 6.
