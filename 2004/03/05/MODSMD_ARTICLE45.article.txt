### BARRETT SHERIDAN SNOOPER EXTRAORDINAIRE 
"We might have met, but I'm always drunk."
— A chesthair-revealing, white-shirted, tall Junior,
bespectacled in snazzy rainbow-tinted sunglasses
(even while inside)
"Well, at the very least, she should have been ugly."
— Girl wearing an astonishing amount of pink (her
sweater, shirt and even sandals were the hue of a
freshly gutted salmon)
I think they should turn the lights out right now, be
cause at the end of the night people just
aren't looking their best."
— Girl with a tasteful red, white and green-striped
shin, at 1:50 a.m.
"I can't find my bra."
— Girl #1, in the shower stall in the girl's
bathroom at SlavDom
"I found mine, but I don't think I'm gonna
wear it anymore."
— Girl #2, running around the bathroom topless
