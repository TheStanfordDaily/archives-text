# Sociology of gender: the strap-on
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Dear readers, it's the beginning of
March, which means that it's time for
spring cleaning! Rummaging through
my files and boxes of past columns,
old pornos and spare sample pack
ages of watermelon flavoured lube
from the oh-so-sketchy clubs Roxy
used to frequent her sophomore year,
I happened to unearth my preferred
weapon of choice that has sadly been
demonized in the sexual arena recent
ly: my favorite black strap-on.
It's true: between all of the Femi
nist Studies 101 readings and the
only remaining video copy of the
threesome 1 had with two Stanford
varsity swimmers (don't think that
they didn't enjoy each other's com

pany just as much as I did), lies the
Texas Two Strap in black. It's quite
possibly my most beloved sex toy
and provides more opportunity for
devious deviance than anyone could
possibly imagine.
Having a woman don a strap-on
and fuck me has been one of my huge
turn-ons for quite some time now.
One of my favorite dyke friends once
screwed me silly in one of the hottest
sexual experiences of my life. Women
who use strap-ons aren't hung up
about penis size, performance anxiety
or needing to prove their manhood.
And for those of you who think that
strap-ons are only for mullet-sprout
ing man haters, it's an undeserved
myth — as one of my many Sapphic
lovers told me, the fake appendage
isn't as political as it is fun. People use
it because they get off from penetra
tion, and the strap-on is merely a tool
to enhance sexual pleasure.
But what about the other side? 1
can count on one hand the number of
straight men out there who aren't ut
terly cowed by the taboo, and I can
think of better uses for that hand.
That is unreservedly absurd. If I
learned anything from Humßio core,
it's that the prostate gland is, sensa
tion-wise, an extension of the penis,

running right up alongside the rec
tum. Plainly put, it's an erogenous
zone, and one that merits more dis
covery. The first time I banged a man
(as opposed to getting banged by one)
opened my eyes into what it means to
be on top: a little disgust, some cau
tion and a lot of up fucked up gender
sociology. Regardless of who is top
and who is bottom, surrender is at the
center of any sexual experience. Soci
ety has ingrained the issue of invasion
into sex to the point where the butt is
the ultimate form of sexual conquest,
a way of negotiating access and dis
torting gender.
That said, there are a number of
factors the budding strappist must
take into account. Like any prosthetic
penile purchase, the size must be ap
propriate to what your partner can
take. One complaint I have with
strap-ons is that they often move too
much, so make sure that the harness
provides enough support around the
waist. Color is also vital — some pre
fer outrageous shades, but for Rox,
the mood dies when she walks in
wearing purple around her crotch.
Strap-ons aren't limited to around the
crotch, either — many are designed
to be worn around the knee or the
wrist. Some strap-ons come strapless,
and can be attached to a wall or a mir
ror for solo enjoyment.
So if you're a straight guy who
has some inhibitions about taking it
up your ass from a woman, well,
then, practice makes perfect. Start
by having your partner use her fin
gers, a condom-covered cucumber,
and a handheld dildo before you run
out and buy the Texas Two Strap.
Finally, go out and rent Carol
Queen's deliciously educational
"Bend Over Boyfriend." It's vital to
any straight couple thinking about
role reversals and provides the visu
al proof that anal penetration fora
man can provide some of the wildest
orgasms you'll ever have. And un
less you spend your strap-on nights
screaming "Yes, varsity swimmer!
Do me hard!" then you're not gay.
Straight sex with a strap-on is still
straight sex.

than the real thing. Fo' sho.

it's that the prostate gland is, sensa
tion-wise, an extension of the penis,

running right up alongside the rec
tum. Plainly put, it's an erogenous
zone, and one that merits more dis
covery. The first time I banged a man
(as opposed to getting banged by one)
opened my eyes into what it means to
be on top: a little disgust, some cau
tion and a lot of up fucked up gender
sociology. Regardless of who is top
and who is bottom, surrender is at the
center of any sexual experience. Soci
ety has ingrained the issue of invasion
into sex to the point where the butt is
the ultimate form of sexual conquest,
a way of negotiating access and dis
torting gender.
That said, there are a number of
factors the budding strappist must
take into account. Like any prosthetic
penile purchase, the size must be ap
propriate to what your partner can
take. One complaint I have with
strap-ons is that they often move too
much, so make sure that the harness
provides enough support around the
waist. Color is also vital — some pre
fer outrageous shades, but for Rox,
the mood dies when she walks in
wearing purple around her crotch.
Strap-ons aren't limited to around the
crotch, either — many are designed
to be worn around the knee or the
wrist. Some strap-ons come strapless,
and can be attached to a wall or a mir
ror for solo enjoyment.
So if you're a straight guy who
has some inhibitions about taking it
up your ass from a woman, well,
then, practice makes perfect. Start
by having your partner use her fin
gers, a condom-covered cucumber,
and a handheld dildo before you run
out and buy the Texas Two Strap.
Finally, go out and rent Carol
Queen's deliciously educational
"Bend Over Boyfriend." It's vital to
any straight couple thinking about
role reversals and provides the visu
al proof that anal penetration fora
man can provide some of the wildest
orgasms you'll ever have. And un
less you spend your strap-on nights
screaming "Yes, varsity swimmer!
Do me hard!" then you're not gay.
Straight sex with a strap-on is still
straight sex.
