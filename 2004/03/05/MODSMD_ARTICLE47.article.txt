## Dry as a Triscuit: Waterproof porn 
### ALLA GONOPOLSKY LIZZIE EPSTEIN 
During a particularly stressful trip
to the Stanford Bookstore, it took me
an entire hour to locate textbooks for
three classes, despite their seemingly
foolproof organizational system (the
alphabet). Weary, i met up with my
friend Jasmine and we proceeded to
the checkout, whining about the diffi
culty of finding anything in this com
plicated, information-inundated day
and, "HEYJThey have 'Wet!'" she
exclaimed with joy. I refer, of course,
to the second volume of "Aqua Erot
ica," America's favorite compilation
of sordid short stories on waterproof
pages. Sure enough, it was displayed
prominently right in between the
children's books and Stanford key
chains. We eagerly skimmed our new
treasure to see if it was as promising
as its predecessor, and were not dis
appointed:
"No surprise, then, her singular
dedication to the science of lubrica
tion ... the job in Elias Martin's lab
was ideal to her purposes."
"When the shark darted for
ward, I used my hands to grab it by
the pectoral fins and clasp it to my
bosom." This was sure to provide
hours of quality entertainment in
any aquatic environment. (Writer's
note: the bookstore could not be
reached for comment.)
I sprinted into my room, eager to
share the news with my roommates,
but they were far too engrossed in
"See Jane Score" and "Fancy Pants,"
respectively, to pay much attention to
ine. Oh well, when in Rome... I
picked up "Lady Lyte's Little Secret"
and sat down on the couch too, all
thoughts of my physics reading drift
ing away. According to certain male
acquaintances who consider them
selves above such frivolity, we are
"losers." However, these are the
same boys who visit us night after
night, under the guise of wanting to

spend quality time with girls, but real
ly just want to read sex stories in our
Cosmopolitans. Freshman year, an
exciting Tuesday night always in
volved our favorite guy friend reading
aloud rather animatedly the best pas
sages of "Sex For Dummies."
In the words of our nerdy pro-fro,
"Shouldn't you guys be studying?"
Don't Stanford kids have anything
better to do? Would our professors be
shocked to learn of this behavior, or
would they think guiltily of their own
copiy of "I Brake for Bad Boys" hid
den in their briefcase?
Sure, deep down every girl wants
to be kidnapped in the Ottoman Em
pire and get sold to the domineering
Khalid as a concubine and eventually
fall in love with his raw masculinity
and hairy muscular chest. Also, he's
great in bed. And nearly every guy
has fantasized at some point or other
about reenacting his favorite innuen
do-laden comic book scene with a
nearby schoolgirl (or schoolboy!) and
maybe some oysters.
Porn movies were so high school,
and besides, they make sex seem like
it is a dirty ritual only performed by
unattractive people during power
outages. Stanford students want their
sex glamorous, they want it classy and
they want to learn eloquent new
phrases to describe their sexual ex
ploits. The editor of "Aqua Erotica"
diligently spends many hours careful
ly choosing only the most delicious,
well-written, and educational tales —
gems such as "her apparatus re
mained dry as a Triscuit" have gotten
us all through some tough times.
With all the pressure on us to do
useful things with our time and ener
gy, our brains sometimes scream fora
little relief-some brain candy. Read
ing a romance novel (or "sex novel"
as one of my Philistine friends calls
them) is a great way to slip into an
other country fora little bit, without
having to think too hard. And even
though we won't admit it, the very act
of reading allows us to convince our
selves that we are doing something to
better our minds. Finally, even jaded
cynical Stanford students can appre
ciate tales of love blossoming and tri
umphing against all odds — although
these columnists tend to skip the plot
and go straight for the juicy parts.
