# Art is hard
## "Picasso to Thiebaud" at Cantor Arts Center 
### CHRIS MEYER INTERMISSION ART CRITIC 
This is the true story of five under
graduates, four graduate students and
two curators picked to work together
on a museum exhibit. Find out what
happens when people stop being polite
and start getting real...
No, MTV has not decided to adapt
its famous reality show, "The Real
World," into something that might ap
peal to art and museum buffs. For the
last two quarters Stanford's Art depart

merit offered a seminar titled "Anato
my of an Exhibition," in which students
worked with curators from the Cantor
Center for Visual Arts on an upcoming
exhibit. The product of this experi
ment, "Picasso to Thiebaud: Modern
and Contemporary Art from the Col
lections of Stanford University Alumni
and Friends," is now on view through
June 20.
The impressive collection includes
the works of some of the most iconic
names of the 20th century — Picasso,
Juan Gris, Alexander Calder, Jackson

Pollock, Jasper Johns and Andy
Warhol. The exhibit also displays
prominent California painters: Richard
Diebenkorn, Wayne Thiebaud and
David Hockney (an Englishman
turned-Southern CaJifornian).
"Picasso to Thiebaud" is worth vis
iting on the strength of Thiebaud's
"Dark Land"(l997) alone. Thiebaud's
depiction of the Sacramento River
Delta landscape is so lush and sensu
ous that I was overwhelmed by the
painting at first sight. But the work's
immediate effect is not its only reward.
Like all great art, "Dark l,and" re
wards patient viewing and deliberate
reflection. Once the initial feeling sub
sides, the image's complex construc
tion becomes apparent.
Thiebaud is obviously a student of
art history: His painting draws on both
Western and Eastern perspective sys-

tems as well as both ab
stract and figurative modes
of construction. The
painter manages to aim
bine these seemingly dis
parate parts into one de
lightful whole.
It should be noted that
the exhibit's pieces (65 in
all) had been pre-selected
by the curators before the
seminar took place. The
exhibit's presentation —
selecting the wall panels
and labels and organizing
and placing the works —
was the subject of the semi
nar. Students grouped the
works by themes and wrote
many of the wall labels.
Unfortunately, the results
are somewhat clumsy.
The show's wall labels
are very uneven —perhaps
the consequence of nine
different voices working
together. Most of the wall
labels in "Picasso to
Thiebaud" are too long
and redundantly descrip
tive. Moreover, they are lit
tered with hiehlv subjective

statements which should be left up to a
viewer's interpretation.
Another problem is the exhibit's
premise. Many of the works are orga
nized into a "mini-university" of aca
demic themes: History, Music, Eng
lish Literature, Feminist Studies, and
Science, Technology and Society.
The "History" section offers an ap
propriate example. The wall panel
tries to establish a link between the
abstract expressionists (such as Pol
lock) in the 1950s to contemporary
historical events: "Gestural, some
times violent brushwork suggests the
trauma of the global encounter or a
world blown apart at the beginning of
the atomic age."
Art always reflects its historical en
vironment. But to suggest that the tech
niques of the abstract expressionists
was a manifestation of "a world blown
apart at the beginning of the atomic
age" is a dubious statement that sug
gests a causal relationship between
technique and current events. Such a
statement is an over-simplification that
ignores other works from the same pe

riod that do not fit that criteria.
Despite these criticisms, the show is,
on the whole, very rewarding. "Picasso
to Thiebaud" includes interesting art
from diverse time periods and artists
and in many different mediums.
Morris Louis' "Number 85"
(1961- 1962), a vertical canvas com
posed of a staccato of juxtaposed
lines in various colors, is visually sat
isfying in its simplicity. Helen
Frankenthaler's "Orange Median"
(1966) employs a "stain painting"
method that gives her work a feeling
of lightness and floating.
In"The Polish Sisters" (1994), a
sculpture by Rebecca Horn, two pairs
of scissors slowly open and close at a
rate dictated by an attached motor. A
yardstick suspended by strings to
each pair of scissors moves up and
down as the scissors open and close.
The gradual movements are hypnot
ic, yet you fear that the scissors will
unexpectedly snap shut at any mo
ment. These three works and many
more make "Picasso to Thiebaud"
well worth a visit.


Picasso's work was fueled by a high-carb diet, con
trary to popular stereotypes of the "starving
artist."

The show's wall labels
are very uneven —perhaps
the consequence of nine
different voices working
together. Most of the wall
labels in "Picasso to
Thiebaud" are too long
and redundantly descrip
tive. Moreover, they are lit
tered with hiehlv subjective

statements which should be left up to a
viewer's interpretation.
Another problem is the exhibit's
premise. Many of the works are orga
nized into a "mini-university" of aca
demic themes: History, Music, Eng
lish Literature, Feminist Studies, and
Science, Technology and Society.
The "History" section offers an ap
propriate example. The wall panel
tries to establish a link between the
abstract expressionists (such as Pol
lock) in the 1950s to contemporary
historical events: "Gestural, some
times violent brushwork suggests the
trauma of the global encounter or a
world blown apart at the beginning of
the atomic age."
Art always reflects its historical en
vironment. But to suggest that the tech
niques of the abstract expressionists
was a manifestation of "a world blown
apart at the beginning of the atomic
age" is a dubious statement that sug
gests a causal relationship between
technique and current events. Such a
statement is an over-simplification that
ignores other works from the same pe

riod that do not fit that criteria.
Despite these criticisms, the show is,
on the whole, very rewarding. "Picasso
to Thiebaud" includes interesting art
from diverse time periods and artists
and in many different mediums.
Morris Louis' "Number 85"
(1961- 1962), a vertical canvas com
posed of a staccato of juxtaposed
lines in various colors, is visually sat
isfying in its simplicity. Helen
Frankenthaler's "Orange Median"
(1966) employs a "stain painting"
method that gives her work a feeling
of lightness and floating.
In"The Polish Sisters" (1994), a
sculpture by Rebecca Horn, two pairs
of scissors slowly open and close at a
rate dictated by an attached motor. A
yardstick suspended by strings to
each pair of scissors moves up and
down as the scissors open and close.
The gradual movements are hypnot
ic, yet you fear that the scissors will
unexpectedly snap shut at any mo
ment. These three works and many
more make "Picasso to Thiebaud"
well worth a visit.


Picasso's work was fueled by a high-carb diet, con
trary to popular stereotypes of the "starving
artist."
This is the true story of five under
graduates, four graduate students and
two curators picked to work together
on a museum exhibit. Find out what

No, MTV has not decided to adapt
its famous reality show, "The Real
World," into something that might ap
peal to art and museum buffs. For the
last two quarters Stanford's Art depart

merit offered a seminar titled "Anato
my of an Exhibition," in which students
worked with curators from the Cantor
Center for Visual Arts on an upcoming
exhibit. The product of this experi
ment, "Picasso to Thiebaud: Modern
and Contemporary Art from the Col
lections of Stanford University Alumni
and Friends," is now on view through
June 20.
The impressive collection includes
the works of some of the most iconic
names of the 20th century — Picasso,
Juan Gris, Alexander Calder, Jackson

Pollock, Jasper Johns and Andy
Warhol. The exhibit also displays
prominent California painters: Richard
Diebenkorn, Wayne Thiebaud and
David Hockney (an Englishman
turned-Southern CaJifornian).
"Picasso to Thiebaud" is worth vis
iting on the strength of Thiebaud's
"Dark Land"(l997) alone. Thiebaud's
depiction of the Sacramento River
Delta landscape is so lush and sensu
ous that I was overwhelmed by the
painting at first sight. But the work's
immediate effect is not its only reward.
Like all great art, "Dark l,and" re
wards patient viewing and deliberate
reflection. Once the initial feeling sub
sides, the image's complex construc
tion becomes apparent.
Thiebaud is obviously a student of
art history: His painting draws on both
Western and Eastern perspective sys-

tems as well as both ab
stract and figurative modes
of construction. The
painter manages to aim
bine these seemingly dis
parate parts into one de
lightful whole.
It should be noted that
the exhibit's pieces (65 in
all) had been pre-selected
by the curators before the
seminar took place. The
exhibit's presentation —
selecting the wall panels
and labels and organizing
and placing the works —
was the subject of the semi
nar. Students grouped the
works by themes and wrote
many of the wall labels.
