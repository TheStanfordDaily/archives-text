Urban Nights, a student dance performance spon
sored by Cardinal Ballet that also features Urban
Styles and Bent Spoon, will showcase some of Stan
ford's most talented dancers this weekend.
A highlight of the show will be a piece called "Who
Cares?" choreographed by George Balanchine to
music by George Gershwin. All ballets by Balanchine
are property of the Balanchine Trust, and profession
al companies and schools must obtain permission from
the Trust in order to perform them.
"Cardinal Ballet is privileged to have the rights to
perform this ballet," said freshman Emily Hite, a
member of Cardinal Ballet.
"Balanchine is recognized as one of the greatest

choreographers of the twentieth century."
Cardinal Ballet also had to pay for Trust employee
Charles Anderson, formerly of The New York City Ballet,
to stage the ballet and rehearse it with the group. Cardinal
Ballet member Martine Cicconi, formerly of the NYCB
and current Stanford freshman, assisted Anderson.
According to Hite, this process ensures the accura
cy and quality of the work to be performed.
"[Balanchine] has a very particular style and tech
nique," she said. "Dancers that aren't trained in his style
need the guidance of someone trained under him."
Urban Nights also includes a contemporary ballet
piece entitled "Nine Women Breathe," a new work by
Bay Area choreographer Danielle Martinelli, who
has choreographed for Sacramento
Ballet, Diablo Ballet and the Univer
sity of Utah.

"Urban Nights is a fantastic op
portunity for dance lovers and those
new to dance to experience great art
and great entertainment," Hite said.
Performances are today and Sat
urday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m.
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. Tickets
are free and can be acquired today
from 12-lpm in White Plaza.
