# The 						Stanford Review's Beauty Contest elicits mixed responses

### MARISA C. JUÁREZ 
The Stanford Review is looking fora woman who knows
that "rich people don't eat babies." In what has been
dubbed the "Beautiful Conservative Woman Contest,"
The Review will be judging women who agree with this and
other similar statements.
Responses to what the contest's advertisement calls an
effort to "recognize a marginalized minority: the conserva
tive woman" have been mixed.
Although the ad claims to "celebrate Stanford's rich cul
tural diversity," The Review Editor-in-Chief Stephen Cohen,
a junior, said that the cash-prize contest was mostly a joke.
"It's half-serious, half-joke — the reward is real, but
the funny part is, conservatives don't actually use terms
like 'marginalized minority.'" Cohen said. "It's a serious
contest, though — I'm not spending three hundred dol
lars on nothing."
Cohen went on to explain that the contest originated in
response to "The Vagina Monologues," admittedly after a
few beers and in an effort to reorient The Review to include
more humor.
"Each piece has an underlying conservative tone, even
the humorous pieces," he said. "We need more humor.
Don't take it too seriously. If you don't think it's funny, then
put down the paper."
Laura Harrison, assistant dean of students and di
rector of the Women's Community Center, had a dif
ferent opinion.
"While I can see the educational benefit of sponsoring an
essay contest on views that some students find to be under
represented, the photo part of this contest illustrates the sex
ist presumption that a woman is defined by her appear

ance," Harrison said.
Cohen said The Review stands behind its characteriza.-
tion of the contest as humorous.
"People have been saying [the contest is] just so I can
get phone numbers from beautiful conservative women
on campus," Cohen said. "[Contestants will] mostly be
judged on beauty, but it's really all about the four state
ments — there are millions of Democrats who agree
with them."
The Review has received e-mails both in support and
against the contest, though the number of complaints re
ceived is about twice the number of supportive emails.
"I think it's degrading that even with such smart people
on campus, people still feel the need to categorize people
based on their looks," said junior Ritu Sarin.
Cohen said he is not disheartened by the number of com
plaints he has received.
"It's not bad fora campus that is about 85 percent liber
al," he said.
So far The Review has received several entries, ranging
from serious contestants to a man in a Boy Scout outfit in a
seductive pose. They have not decided on a formal process
forjudging yet, but the judges will consist of select Review
editors and contributors
"We're trying to weed out the people from the Green
Party who are entering just to make fun of us — although, 1
would enjoy getting nude pictures from the Green Party,"
said Cohen. "We're a non-partisan conservative paper, not
Republican. Anyone can enter — we're looking at her ide
ological beliefs, her perspectives."
Many students who find the contest in poor taste
acknowledge its joking intent and are
taking it lightly.
"I think they're welcome to write
whatever they want," said junior Jane
Nevins. "As a big women's rights ac
tivist on campus I find it somewhat ir
relevant to my work. Whenever
there's a social movement there's
going to be backlash."

To enter the contest students must
submit their name, a photo and their
year, along with four sentences about
their political beliefs.
"A human being is a complete
package: mind, body, soul," Cohen
said. "Physical beauty is just as impor
tant. There is nothing inherently objec
tifying when you're looking at other
stuff, too."
Cohen and The Review staff en
courage contestants to continue apply
ing, hoping to prolong the contest for
at least another week.
