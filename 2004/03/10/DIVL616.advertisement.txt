Appropriating Blackness:
Performance and the
Politics of Authenticity
by E. Patrick Johnson
Friday, March 12, 2004 • 12:00PM
Stanford Bookstore Art Alcove
Performance artist and scholar E. Patrick
Johnson's provocative study examines
how blackness is appropriated and per
formed—toward widely divergent
ends —both within and outside African
American culture. Appropriating
Blackness develops from the contention
that blackness in the United States is nec
essarily a politicized identity—avowed
and disavowed, attractive and repellent,
fixed and malleable. Drawing on per
formance theory, queer studies, literary
analysis, film criticism, and ethnographic
fieldwork, Johnson describes how diverse
constituencies persistently try to pre
scribe the boundaries of "authentic"
blackness and how performance high
lights the futility of such enterprises.
Johnson looks at various sites of per
formed blackness, including Marlon
Riggs's influential documentary Black Is .
. . Black Ain't and comedic routines by
Eddie Murphy, David Alan Grier, and
Damon Wayans. He analyzes nationalist
writings by Amiri Baraka and Eldridge
Cleaver, the vernacular of black gay cul
ture, an oral history ofhis grandmother's
experience as a domestic worker in the
South, gospel music as performed by a
white Australian choir, and pedagogy in
a performance studies classroom. By
exploring the divergent aims and effects
of these performances—ranging from
resisting racism, sexism, and homophobia
to excluding sexual dissidents from the
black community—Johnson deftly ana
lyzes the multiple significations of black
ness and their myriad political implica
tions. His reflexive account considers his
own complicity, as ethnographer and
teacher, in authenticating narratives of
blackness.
