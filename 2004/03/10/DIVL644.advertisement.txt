Announcitig Openings for*
Sophomore College Assistants and Oral Communication Tutors
for the 2004 Sophomore College
September 5 - September 25, 2004
Sophomore College is a set of programs for returning sophomores, who live together in a student residence and work under faculty supervision in a series
of small-group classes during early September, before the start of fall quarter.
Sophomore College Assistants(SCAs): Each faculty member is assisted by two upper-class sophomore college assistants (SCAs). (In some instances, one
of the SCAs may be a graduate student.) Any student who will be a junior or senior in 2004-05 and is in good academic standing is eligible to apply. SCAs will receive
room, board, and $750 for full-time work during the course of the program, and for possible planning meetings at the end of spring quarter. Note: Due to the fact that the
training for RA, RCC, PAA, OV and HPAC programs conflict with Sophomore College, if you are selected for both positions, you must choose between them.
Oral Communication Tutors (OCTs): Student tutors in oral communication will also live in each residence and will receive room and board as part of
their compensation. OCTs will be paid an hourly wage commensurate with level of training.
