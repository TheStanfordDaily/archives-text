## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first
female U.S. Supreme Court Justice
and a Stanford alumna, will speak at
the 2004 Commencement, Stan
ford's Senior Class presidents an
nounced Tuesday.
"Justice O'Connor received re
sounding support from the Senior
Class through our nomination
process, and we are absolutely
thrilled that she has accepted our in
vitation," the Senior Class presi
dents said in a statement released
Monday. "She brings insight and
perspective to the University com
munity through her experiences as
both an undergraduate and graduate
student at Stanford. Her life story —
one of courage and integrity in the
face of challenges — provides inspi
ration to our class as we approach
Commencement. We are honored
and privileged that she will share this
milestone with us."
O'Connor graduated from Stan
ford magna cum laude with a bach
elor's degree in economics in 1950
and earned her law degree from
Stanford in 1952, finishing third in
her class. Since her appointment to
the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981,
she has written crucial judicial opin
ions on some of the most con
tentious political issues of the past
two decades.
Senior Class Presidents Mary
Himinkool, Mikey Lee and Ryan
Taylor recommended O'Connor
to University President John
Hennessy.

"I am extremely pleased and
proud to accept the recommenda
tion of the class presidents," Hen
nessy said. "By suggesting Justice
O'Connor, the Senior Class recog
nized not only her role as a central
figure in contemporary U.S. history,
they have chosen someone who has
deep ties to Stanford on an intellec
tual and personal level. I know that
her reflections will have special
meaning for our graduates, and I
look forward with great anticipation
to hearing her speak."
O'Connor graduated from the
Stanford Law School in the same
class as U.S. Supreme Court Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, who
graduated first in the class. She
met her husband, John J. O'Con
nor 111, while at Stanford, and
both of their sons are also alumni
of the University.
Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
Stanford Law School, said O'Con
nor was an inspired selection.
"Justice O'Connor is a wonderful
choice for Commencement speak
er," Sullivan said. "A great friend to
Stanford and its law school, she has
made history twice — once as the
first woman appointed to the
Supreme Court, and again through
the strength and grace of her opin
ions, which have kept the court true
to its historic role as a moderate
counterweight to the extreme posi
tions often expressed in politics."
Commencement will be held on
Sunday, June 13, and is part of a two
day celebration for graduates, their
families and friends, and members of
the Stanford community.
