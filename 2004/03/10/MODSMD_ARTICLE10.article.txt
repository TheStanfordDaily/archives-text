## This sure ain't cabo Students participate in Alternative Spring Break 
### ARAM HUR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This spring break, a certain group
of students will experience "the week
that lasts a lifetime." They are mem
bers of the Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) program, which is designed to
expose students to the socioeconomic
and cultural issues involving the na
tion today.
Stanford's ASB program is nation
ally recognized as "the best Alterna
tive Spring Break." The program of
fers students a myriad of student-cho
sen topics to study and culminates in
educational trips during spring break.
Students apply for the topic of their
choice during fall quarter and; once ac
cepted, participate in the program's
three-part program.
ASB's three components effectively
mingle community service with an in
valuable learning experience. During
winter quarter, students take a one or
two-unit academic class in which ger
mane articles, essays and academic peri
odicals are examined in open discussion

once a week. The program's pinnacle is
the actual trip during spring break when
students travel to different locations
around the country for first-hand educa
tion in their concentrations.
The experience concludes with a post
break reflection about the trip and pro
gram as a whole.
Senior Harini Raghupathi, one of the
directors for ASB 2(X)3-2(X)4, said, "The
program's greatest strength lies in its
unique and comprehensive approach —
to contextualize public service within a
broad framework of education."
This year, the program's topics in
clude capital punishment, agriculture,
Asian-American issues, Hawaiian histo
ry and many others. The program at
tracts a truly diverse array of students
who have different passions but are unit
ed under the same cause of helping the
community and absorbing more about
their environment.
Indeed, the program has grown in
both intensity and size since it was first
launched in the 1986-1987 school year.
The initial version was quite different;
rather than focusing on local community

building, it sought to address issues far
away, even going beyond the United
States. Within ten years of its installa
tion, the ASB program was deemed "the
best Alternative Spring Break program
of the year" by the BreakAway: The Al
ternative Break Connection Founda
tion. Since its creation, the number of
participants has doubled, and the pro
gram has evolved to more localized and
curriculum-based.
ASB is student-directed. Every year,
the topics are chosen from a pool pro
posed by students. Students whose topics
are selected become the student direc
tors and take on the responsibilities of
leading discussion and planning the trip.
The student leaders are usually former
participants of the program or are very
passionate about pursuing the specific
topics they lead.
"I was attracted to the program be
cause it seemed like a good way to con
tinue my involvement with the Asian
American community," said juniot Eric
Shih, one of the leaders for the Asian-
American Identities ASB.
Participants have more diverse rea-

sons for joining the program.
"Since I live on the east
coast, I knew I wasn't going
back for spring break. I
didn't want to spend a whole
week doing nothing, and
thought ASB was a fun and
educational program," said
freshman Nancy Wang, a
participant in the Asian
American Identities ASB.
The impact of the pro
gram on the community and
the participating students is
evident by the longevity and
continuing growth of the
program. Wang said that
with more publicity, the pro
gram would probably grow
even faster.
"I know many friends
that are staying on campus
for spring break and would
have loved to be in ASB, but
did not know," Wang said.
Ultimately, the pro
gram lets students step out
of the University's en
closed walls and become in
tune with the pressing is
sues of society.
"I think that ASB is ef
fective in exposing students
to conditions and communi
ties outside of Stanford. And
it's also important for stu
dents to have spaces to dis
cuss issues amongst them
selves and to develop ideas
or interests that might not get
covered in professor-led lec
tures or seminars," Shih said.
By aiding students in
maturing into attentive and
proactive citizens of the com
munity, ASB may truly be a
live-changing experience.

gram as a whole.
Senior Harini Raghupathi, one of the
directors for ASB 2(X)3-2(X)4, said, "The
program's greatest strength lies in its
unique and comprehensive approach —
to contextualize public service within a
broad framework of education."
This year, the program's topics in
clude capital punishment, agriculture,
Asian-American issues, Hawaiian histo
ry and many others. The program at
tracts a truly diverse array of students
who have different passions but are unit
ed under the same cause of helping the
community and absorbing more about
their environment.
Indeed, the program has grown in
both intensity and size since it was first
launched in the 1986-1987 school year.
The initial version was quite different;
rather than focusing on local community

building, it sought to address issues far
away, even going beyond the United
States. Within ten years of its installa
tion, the ASB program was deemed "the
best Alternative Spring Break program
of the year" by the BreakAway: The Al
ternative Break Connection Founda
tion. Since its creation, the number of
participants has doubled, and the pro
gram has evolved to more localized and
curriculum-based.
ASB is student-directed. Every year,
the topics are chosen from a pool pro
posed by students. Students whose topics
are selected become the student direc
tors and take on the responsibilities of
leading discussion and planning the trip.
The student leaders are usually former
participants of the program or are very
passionate about pursuing the specific
topics they lead.
"I was attracted to the program be
cause it seemed like a good way to con
tinue my involvement with the Asian
American community," said juniot Eric
Shih, one of the leaders for the Asian-
American Identities ASB.
Participants have more diverse rea-

sons for joining the program.
"Since I live on the east
coast, I knew I wasn't going
back for spring break. I
didn't want to spend a whole
week doing nothing, and
thought ASB was a fun and
educational program," said
freshman Nancy Wang, a
participant in the Asian
American Identities ASB.
The impact of the pro
gram on the community and
the participating students is
evident by the longevity and
continuing growth of the
program. Wang said that
with more publicity, the pro
gram would probably grow
even faster.
"I know many friends
that are staying on campus
for spring break and would
have loved to be in ASB, but
did not know," Wang said.
Ultimately, the pro
gram lets students step out
of the University's en
closed walls and become in
tune with the pressing is
sues of society.
"I think that ASB is ef
fective in exposing students
to conditions and communi
ties outside of Stanford. And
it's also important for stu
dents to have spaces to dis
cuss issues amongst them
selves and to develop ideas
or interests that might not get
covered in professor-led lec
tures or seminars," Shih said.
By aiding students in
maturing into attentive and
proactive citizens of the com
munity, ASB may truly be a
live-changing experience.
