## What you really do DURING DEAD WEEK 
### 
If you haven't already been diagnosed with ADD, you might be feeling like you need to
get checked out. It's that time of the quarter when we are all easily distracted by any
thing and everything—just to avoid taking on the massive amounts of work we've
avoided all quarter long.
You probably have books — still tightly wrapped in plastic with that awesome bonus CD
ROM staring you in the face every time you think about opening it — that you have yet to
touch. Papers that you were supposed to be researching the entire quarter but have yet to de
termine a topic for cannot be completed in five hours. Your printer cartridge is too low to
handle the 500 pages of past problem sets, solution sets, practice exams and answer keys that
you're trying to print off of Coursework the night before the final.
Well, in case you've run out of ideas for procrastination and really want to push those
deadlines a little further, we've compiled a fantastic list of our favorites. Here you have it —
The Top 10 End-of-the-Quarter Distractions:
The weather: The newly arrived springtime weather isn't making studying easy for any
one. Who wants to go seclude themselves in a cubby in Green when you could be sleeping
in the sun? Plus, we're in the Stanford bubble, so you can't get skin cancer, don't worry. You

don't even have to wear sunscreen! Just lie out on Wilbur
Field with your books next to you and perhaps just by being
closer to them than you've been all quarter you'll absorb
something useful. Or you'll fail your finals, but at least you'll
be tanned.
Thefacebook.com: Need we really comment? This thing is
ridiculous. Since its initial Stanford launch on Feb. 26, over
3,000 of our fellow students have registered, and the numbers
are still rising.
Our column: Well, we know that you usually anxiously
await our column all week long, so this week it should be less
painful — a Thursday edition instead of Friday! Relief at last.

But while it may be relief for your mind, it's torture for your heart having to look at that hot
photo again so soon. You barely got a chance to cool off from last week. We're sorry. We can't
help it.
Dinner with The Stanford Review writers: If you can swing it, go out with these guys. They
really know how to treat a girl right. And all it takes is a simple article in The Daily telling
them they have small dicks and are elitist assholes! Finally, the key to successful Stanford dat
ing revealed. They were dying to prove us wrong. The question is, did they? Perhaps it will
remain a mystery, unless The Review chooses to bare all in its next issue.
Cleaning your room: The end of the quarter will probably be the closest your room will
ever get to being clean. When you have a pressing PWR paper on your back or a looming
Stats 60 final, there's nothing more appealing than organizing your closet, filing every paper
you've received throughout the quarter and trying to vacuum that mystery stain off of your
carpet. The problem is, at the end of it all, you're right back where you started: nevermind
work has been done, that stain is still there, and your shit will be all over your room again
shortly when you go back to finding more ways to procrastinate.
The Time Schedule: Just when you thought you find yourself por
ing over a book of them with uninhibited excitement. You're busy arranging your ideal
schedule, the schedule you likely will be forced to take and, if you're really dedicated, fanta
sy schedules based on the classes you would take if you were a number of other majors. And
you love it.
Nick and Jessica (and other quality TV): Now is the time to catch up on everything
you've missed the entire quarter. If you try hard enough, you can find reruns and even
mini-marathons of all your favorite shows. And in the meantime, why not pick up a few
more programs to follow? There's a lot of great shit out there. I bet most of you didn't
know that Wings reruns are on Nick at Nite every evening from 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. Something
to think about.
Trying to move things in your room tclckinetically: It takes a lot of brainpower, but if you
focus hard enough, who knows? We all read those books in sixth grade about howit happened
all the time to random kids, just when they least expected it. So don't give up.
The mall: For us, this is a distraction for the entire quarter, but in the face of five papers
you've yet to start that are all due on Friday, you really begin to wonder if Banana Republic's
inventory has changed in the past few days. You'll think about something you wanted but
didn't buy and eventually will go back in and have a nervous breakdown when you can't find
it. The sales people will stare in horror as you diagram the item's movement throughout the
store's recent displays and will try not to laugh as you finally break down and buy the first
thing you see, just to get it out of your system.
Midnight Breakfast: We've never been, but we can imagine just how ridiculously ridicu
lously distracting it must be. Breakfast, at midnight? How is that possible? Maybe that's the
way it should be — lunch should be the first meal of the day. Perhaps there is some college
campus that has implemented this system, like the College of William and Mary. Stuff gets
crazy in Colonial Williamsburg. Or maybe Stanford could be the first to claim this brilliant
system. We could be on to something.
Looks like the hardest part about the end of the quarter is choosing your mode of pro
crastination. Good luck!
