" What's your Dead Week study schedule? "

Questions and photographs by
COURTNEY BRIGHAM


"What Dead Week? We
have just as many classes
now as we usually do. Dur
ing Finals Week I sit in my
room and study. It's much
quieter in my apartment
because everyone's al
ready at the library."
ANDREW SCHNELL
Senior, Economics


"I get up around llish to
read and do practice prob
lems. I try to study with
other people to see how we
can exchange information.
And I eat a lot when I study
— pounds and pounds of
food."
TIFFANY CHIOMA
ANAEBERE
Freshman, Undeclared


"Monday I have a take
home quiz that will proba
bly get dropped anyway,
and then I'm done. I think
this will be good prepara
tion for my spring quarter,
during which I have no
classes."
KATY BLAKEMORE
Senior, Human Biology


"I'm a professional athlete.
I'm on the U.S. Cycling
Team. My dead week is
around March 15, when I'll
go to Houston, Texas, to try
to qualify for the World
Cup in England."
TERRY TENETTE
Manager, Tresidder Fitness
Center


"I get up about an hour
after my alarm goes off. I
usually procrastinate,
which is really bad, but not
this time. I make a list to
prioritize my time. And I
always have to take a dance
break - fifteen minutes
every other hour."
SHAKISHA O'CONNOR
Freshman, Political Science


"I usually have papers, so I
generally write them a day
or two before they're due,
and I'm done."
