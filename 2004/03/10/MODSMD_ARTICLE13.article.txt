# Renowned Ethiopian Artist Comes to Stanford
## Afewerk Tekle talks to The Daily about art and life 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
Afewerk Tekle is the foremost
Ethiopian painter, muralist and sculp
tor. Over his six-decade career, he has
been awarded numerous honors, in
cluding being chosen as World Laure
ate of the American Biographical Insti
tute at the 27th International Congress
Millennium on the Arts and Communi
cation in Washington, D.C. He de
signed the three-panel stained glass en
trance to Africa Hall at the headquar
ters of the OAU (now United Nations
Africa) and his work is on permanent
display at the Royal Chapel in the
Tower of London.
Tekle visited Stanford this weekend
and spoke at Kresge Auditorium on
Sunday afternoon, when he was award
ed the Pioneer's Award. His visit was
sponsored by the Stanford Ethiopian
Students Union, in association with
Bechtel International Center and The
Center for African Studies.
The Daily spoke yesterday with Tekle
about his visit, his work and his life.
The Daily: How are you enjoying your
visit?
Afewerk Tekle: I never really accept
an invitation to speak somewhere
more than two years in advance, but
I'm really glad that I came at such
short notice. I was very much flattered
to be recognized as one of the pio
neers in my field, especially to be rec
ognized by a prestigious university
and the brilliant students it possesses.
It really refreshes me, to see the ocean
of faces of different nationalities. It is
in these universities that we will build
an international understand and unity
of mankind.
TD: Are you trying to convey a specific
message with your work?
AT: Yes, I am not one of those contem
poraries artists who believe that they can
paint and sculpt what they like without
caring whether people understand them.
I believe that before you start to do cre
ative work, you need to think, think and
think again about whether your idea is
worthy enough to have moved you to
want to share that idea with others.
Even with a one centimeter by one
centimeter canvas, I wouldn't want to
waste it on an unworthy idea. It's like
land that you have plowed. Art tran
scends your generation; you should
shape it from beginning to end into

something meaningful. An artist
should never make it terribly difficult
for the audience to understand the
message he is sending. If he has no mes
sage, he might as well not do anything.
Art in particular can quickly pass on
a message with great depth. I try to use
art's visual language to pass — I don't
want to say wisdom, but the results of
my search for the truth.
In a country like the United States,
artists have so many ways of express
ing themselves that they can become
fatigued and tired with trying to com
municate. I admire the courage of
these artists, but I think that they are
wasting their time. I still believe that in
order to share, you have to do art in a
language you hope others will under
stand. I feel like artists sometimes use
abstract art to clad themselves in a

toga or a cape so that their technique
cannot be inspected.
I struggle to create new techniques
and appreciate the techniques of oth
ers. It is a great joy to pass on a mes
sage — not just to this generation, but
the next generation.
TD: Could you talk a little bit about
what it was like when your art was first
internationally recognized?
AT: I 've always been surprised when I
receive international recognition, espe
cially in big countries like Russia and
America. Like many unexperienced
and untraveled Africans, I used to think
that in order to get that kind of atten
tion, I would have to paint abstract art.
When people choose my work and
award me for it, it's very encouraging.

Sometimes people in and out of
Africa just expect me to reproduce tra
ditional, almost folkloric art. I always
say that well, we have the right to look
into our tradition, but we also want to
look at the rest of the world. We are the
children of the world, and we must try to
assimilate and dig into our past culture
and inject it into what we are creating.
And I think the content of that work
is very important. The French say, "It's
not that container that is important, it
is the contained." I think that Western
critics often overlook that.
TD: Of all the great artists who you
have met, which have inspired you the
most?
AT: Well, I have met so many — Cha
gall, Picasso, Dali, Rivera. I respect
them all. Sometimes the meetings are
trouble, though. When I met Pablo Pi
casso and his wife, he was totally differ
ent from what I expected. He was a very
humorous man, and when he looked at
my work, he said that my drawings were
stunning work, but I needed to work
harder on my oil paintings.
But then these Texan patrons of his
work came for lunch, and he completely
ignored me. He took a piece of bread
and traced it on the tablecloth, then he
traced his hand. The Texan said, "I
would like to acquire that." If anyone
had said that to me, I would have been
offended, but Picasso told his wife to
take the tablecloth and prepare it.
I was absolutely spellbound to see
the reaction of [the Picassos], In a way,
I wish that I had never met him, be
cause he became just a simple mer
chant in my eyes.
TD: Is there any advice that you'd like
to give to young, aspiring artists?
AT: Yes, one of my mentors said to me
once that I had to remember three
things: "First, you will make money
through painting, but you must try to
treat money as your best servant, but not
as your god. Second, work, work and
work. Never stop. Never only work
when you are inspired. You must also
think about it, so that you feel inspired
more often. Third, you have a rich cul
tural background. Try to study it. Study
and interpret your culture. You can give
the world a glimpse of Ethiopian art. It is
from these sources that great art is made.
I mean, you cannot go back into your
shell, you should try to assimilate and di
gest the art of the world ... Your art will
become universal.

The Daily spoke yesterday with Tekle
about his visit, his work and his life.
The Daily: How are you enjoying your
visit?
Afewerk Tekle: I never really accept
an invitation to speak somewhere
more than two years in advance, but
I'm really glad that I came at such
short notice. I was very much flattered
to be recognized as one of the pio
neers in my field, especially to be rec
ognized by a prestigious university
and the brilliant students it possesses.
It really refreshes me, to see the ocean
of faces of different nationalities. It is
in these universities that we will build
an international understand and unity
of mankind.
TD: Are you trying to convey a specific
message with your work?
AT: Yes, I am not one of those contem
poraries artists who believe that they can
paint and sculpt what they like without
caring whether people understand them.
I believe that before you start to do cre
ative work, you need to think, think and
think again about whether your idea is
worthy enough to have moved you to
want to share that idea with others.
Even with a one centimeter by one
centimeter canvas, I wouldn't want to
waste it on an unworthy idea. It's like
land that you have plowed. Art tran
scends your generation; you should
shape it from beginning to end into

something meaningful. An artist
should never make it terribly difficult
for the audience to understand the
message he is sending. If he has no mes
sage, he might as well not do anything.
Art in particular can quickly pass on
a message with great depth. I try to use
art's visual language to pass — I don't
want to say wisdom, but the results of
my search for the truth.
In a country like the United States,
artists have so many ways of express
ing themselves that they can become
fatigued and tired with trying to com
municate. I admire the courage of
these artists, but I think that they are
wasting their time. I still believe that in
order to share, you have to do art in a
language you hope others will under
stand. I feel like artists sometimes use
abstract art to clad themselves in a

toga or a cape so that their technique
cannot be inspected.
I struggle to create new techniques
and appreciate the techniques of oth
ers. It is a great joy to pass on a mes
sage — not just to this generation, but
the next generation.
TD: Could you talk a little bit about
what it was like when your art was first
internationally recognized?
AT: I 've always been surprised when I
receive international recognition, espe
cially in big countries like Russia and
America. Like many unexperienced
and untraveled Africans, I used to think
that in order to get that kind of atten
tion, I would have to paint abstract art.
When people choose my work and
award me for it, it's very encouraging.

Sometimes people in and out of
Africa just expect me to reproduce tra
ditional, almost folkloric art. I always
say that well, we have the right to look
into our tradition, but we also want to
look at the rest of the world. We are the
children of the world, and we must try to
assimilate and dig into our past culture
and inject it into what we are creating.
And I think the content of that work
is very important. The French say, "It's
not that container that is important, it
is the contained." I think that Western
critics often overlook that.
TD: Of all the great artists who you
have met, which have inspired you the
most?
AT: Well, I have met so many — Cha
gall, Picasso, Dali, Rivera. I respect
them all. Sometimes the meetings are
trouble, though. When I met Pablo Pi
casso and his wife, he was totally differ
ent from what I expected. He was a very
humorous man, and when he looked at
my work, he said that my drawings were
stunning work, but I needed to work
harder on my oil paintings.
But then these Texan patrons of his
work came for lunch, and he completely
ignored me. He took a piece of bread
and traced it on the tablecloth, then he
traced his hand. The Texan said, "I
would like to acquire that." If anyone
had said that to me, I would have been
offended, but Picasso told his wife to
take the tablecloth and prepare it.
I was absolutely spellbound to see
the reaction of [the Picassos], In a way,
I wish that I had never met him, be
cause he became just a simple mer
chant in my eyes.
TD: Is there any advice that you'd like
to give to young, aspiring artists?
AT: Yes, one of my mentors said to me
once that I had to remember three
things: "First, you will make money
through painting, but you must try to
treat money as your best servant, but not
as your god. Second, work, work and
work. Never stop. Never only work
when you are inspired. You must also
think about it, so that you feel inspired
more often. Third, you have a rich cul
tural background. Try to study it. Study
and interpret your culture. You can give
the world a glimpse of Ethiopian art. It is
from these sources that great art is made.
I mean, you cannot go back into your
shell, you should try to assimilate and di
gest the art of the world ... Your art will
become universal.
