# Ten Random Questions
## With Chief of Police Laura Wilson 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Wilson, who majored in human biology while an undergraduate at Stanford, is currently the chief of
police. She originally considered being a competitive athlete or a fire fighter.
What's your best chase story?
It was fairly early on in my career. Here I am: Stanford grad, female, petite. A couple of car bur
glars broke into some cars in one of the parking structures. A Palo Alto officer actually stopped
the car in Palo Alto and so I responded over. There were two fairly young, probably 18,19-year-

old thieves, and one of them had to have been 6-foot-5. And I'm 5-
foot-2.1 turn to my guy and I say, "Turn around, place your hands be
hind your back." He turns around and runs, and the pursuit is on.
Your adrenaline does really get going, and I'm, like, running across
the El Camino like you would see in a chase or something, putting my
hand up like that's really gonna stop cars moving 45 miles an hour as
I run across the street. Then as we get to Jamba Juice the guy grabs a
bicycle from somebody and I'm yelling, "Police! Stop, you blankety
blankety-blank! " in front of all these people. We keep running after
him, but now he's on a bike and I'm not. Out of the corner of my eye,
I see this police car coming, and as the police car tries to cut the guy off
the guy runs into the police car. So we caught the bad guy.
Did you get to throw him against the car and handcuff him and everything?
Actually, when he fell off the bike, he was on the ground, and there

were a lot of people. 1 forgot to tell you, I did actually have my gun point
ed at him at one point in time because he stopped, and I stopped, and I didn't know if he had a gun
so I'm standing there, thinking, "If he reaches for something, I will end up shooting him." I'm actu
ally a fairly good shot. But he didn't, and you can't shoot someone for no reason, so I had to put my
gun back in my holster and keep running after him. But when I hopped the fence I actually cut my
hand open, so I was bleeding, and when I went to cuff him everyone looks down and sees blood on
him and they thought 1 had nicked him or somehow hurt him and then we realized all the fat was
coming out of my hand.
When you're interrogating a suspect, are you the good cop or the bad cop?
I usually would play the good cop. I have a hard time being the hardass. You have to learn
to do both, but now that I'm chief I don't really conduct investigations anymore.
What's your favorite cop movie?
I have to admit, I don't really watch [them].
How many parking tickets have you received on-campus?
I received five. Three as a student; from someone who now works for me, and the other two I
actually received when I was with Chelsea Clinton. I had intentionally taken off my parking per
mit because I was doing — essentially it was undercover work — and I didn't want my car to be
recognized. Now, I've driven the same car for 10 years. Everyone knows my car: It has a bumper
sticker on it that said "Practice Random Acts of Kindness." This guy that no longer works here
gave me two tickets. It took forever to get them off at the DMV so I could register my car.
Any good Chelsea Clinton stories?
I was the liaison [between the Secret Service and the police]. I didn't want to deceive students,
but for the first week — I didn't pretend that I was a student, I just didn't make it known that I
wasn't a student. People in the dorm, freshmen, assumed that I was a student until we were sit
ting around, like students do, in the hallway one day, and I'm just sitting on the floor and we're
all having a chat, so they asked who I was and what do I do. They were a little surprised.
Have you ever had to use your gun?
I have pointed it at people and there have been a couple of times when I thought I would po
tentially have to pull the trigger, but I have not ever shot it.
What do you think of the term PoPo for police officer?
I haven't really heard it used that often. I don't consider it that flattering.
Which best describes The Stanford Daily: felon for life, misdemeanor offender or innocent lit
tle angel?
Misdemeanor offender. Trying to reform.
What's your favorite alcoholic drink?
Probably a margarita.
Are you going to be sending any of your officers to film school to prepare for "Exotic Erotic"
this year?
[Laughs], No.

police. She originally considered being a competitive athlete or a fire fighter.
What's your best chase story?
It was fairly early on in my career. Here I am: Stanford grad, female, petite. A couple of car bur
glars broke into some cars in one of the parking structures. A Palo Alto officer actually stopped
the car in Palo Alto and so I responded over. There were two fairly young, probably 18,19-year-

old thieves, and one of them had to have been 6-foot-5. And I'm 5-
foot-2.1 turn to my guy and I say, "Turn around, place your hands be
hind your back." He turns around and runs, and the pursuit is on.
Your adrenaline does really get going, and I'm, like, running across
the El Camino like you would see in a chase or something, putting my
hand up like that's really gonna stop cars moving 45 miles an hour as
I run across the street. Then as we get to Jamba Juice the guy grabs a
bicycle from somebody and I'm yelling, "Police! Stop, you blankety
blankety-blank! " in front of all these people. We keep running after
him, but now he's on a bike and I'm not. Out of the corner of my eye,
I see this police car coming, and as the police car tries to cut the guy off
the guy runs into the police car. So we caught the bad guy.
Did you get to throw him against the car and handcuff him and everything?
Actually, when he fell off the bike, he was on the ground, and there

were a lot of people. 1 forgot to tell you, I did actually have my gun point
ed at him at one point in time because he stopped, and I stopped, and I didn't know if he had a gun
so I'm standing there, thinking, "If he reaches for something, I will end up shooting him." I'm actu
ally a fairly good shot. But he didn't, and you can't shoot someone for no reason, so I had to put my
gun back in my holster and keep running after him. But when I hopped the fence I actually cut my
hand open, so I was bleeding, and when I went to cuff him everyone looks down and sees blood on
him and they thought 1 had nicked him or somehow hurt him and then we realized all the fat was
coming out of my hand.
When you're interrogating a suspect, are you the good cop or the bad cop?
I usually would play the good cop. I have a hard time being the hardass. You have to learn
to do both, but now that I'm chief I don't really conduct investigations anymore.
What's your favorite cop movie?
I have to admit, I don't really watch [them].
How many parking tickets have you received on-campus?
I received five. Three as a student; from someone who now works for me, and the other two I
actually received when I was with Chelsea Clinton. I had intentionally taken off my parking per
mit because I was doing — essentially it was undercover work — and I didn't want my car to be
recognized. Now, I've driven the same car for 10 years. Everyone knows my car: It has a bumper
sticker on it that said "Practice Random Acts of Kindness." This guy that no longer works here
gave me two tickets. It took forever to get them off at the DMV so I could register my car.
Any good Chelsea Clinton stories?
I was the liaison [between the Secret Service and the police]. I didn't want to deceive students,
but for the first week — I didn't pretend that I was a student, I just didn't make it known that I
wasn't a student. People in the dorm, freshmen, assumed that I was a student until we were sit
ting around, like students do, in the hallway one day, and I'm just sitting on the floor and we're
all having a chat, so they asked who I was and what do I do. They were a little surprised.
Have you ever had to use your gun?
I have pointed it at people and there have been a couple of times when I thought I would po
tentially have to pull the trigger, but I have not ever shot it.
What do you think of the term PoPo for police officer?
I haven't really heard it used that often. I don't consider it that flattering.
Which best describes The Stanford Daily: felon for life, misdemeanor offender or innocent lit
tle angel?
Misdemeanor offender. Trying to reform.
What's your favorite alcoholic drink?
Probably a margarita.
Are you going to be sending any of your officers to film school to prepare for "Exotic Erotic"
this year?
[Laughs], No.
