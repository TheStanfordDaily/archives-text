# Eat, Drink and be Merry
## Late nights and bright mornings during Dead Week 
### 
I was intending to talk about where best to reward
yourself during Dead Week after those intense
days of studying. But then I got distracted by the
masses of people tanning in our lounge chairs, on
Wilbur field and in the Oval. I wouldn't even be sur
prised if I saw a few die-hard students pull out their
shades and bathing suit top in their 11

a.m. lecture (prime tanning hour),
open the window to free the sun rays
so cruelly blocked by the window and
chill in their butterfly chairs. Hey, it
could happen.
Spring has hit the Farm, and hope
fully it won't be moody and decide to
'peace out' like it did last year, leaving
Winter a free pass to roll through with
the thunderclouds and gloomy skies.

And while 1 do see this constant 75-
degree weather as probably an unwelcome distraction
during finals time, I do think it has its redeeming quali
ties as well.
1 don't think I've ever gone to my 9 a.m. class with
such energy as I have had in the past couple of days. My
usual routine — alarm goes off, snooze, alarm off again,
eyes open, see rain and wind, eyes close and mind thinks,
"missing one class isn't the end of the world" — is com
pletely wiped away. Instead it's — alarm goes off,
snooz, alarm off again, eyes open, sunny, warm, yay for

sunshine, yay for class — well, not yay for class per se,
but yay for walking to class on this beautiful morning.
But you can plainly see the difference in energy and
exuberance levels between the two scenarios. Ah, it's
like a shot of wheatgrass for the soul. (I mean, what bet
ter way to remind yourself you're alive during dead
week than to know skin cells are basking in the glow of
ultra-violet rays!)
It's so tempting to imagine that it's spring break al
ready. With the Time Schedule out and tanning oil gear
ing up to full force, it's easy to forget that finals are just
around the corner. Especially with my friends' AIM
profiles counting down the days to their respective trips
to Cabo.
I feel like it's partly nature's cruel joke and partly na
ture's gift to give us the sun right when we should be
trapped in our rooms reading the deluge of pages that
just didn't seem so pressing during weeks two through
nine. And the whole studying in the sunshine excuse just
doesn't work in reality. Ask the girl who was sprawled
on our patio reading John Grisham, a book clearly not
for class. Or ask the one who was peacefully napping on
the hammock. (She was only planning on closing her
eyes fora second, she swears.)
The sun is a counterbalance to such a depressing pe
riod and a pleasant reminder of good times to come.
With springtime comes the desire to switch from your
Starbucks toffee nut latte to perhaps an iced chai tea or

a mocha frappacino. The desire for warm, comforting
dishes gives way to light al fresco dining. I don't know
about you, but the mm-mm-goodness of chicken pot pie
just doesn't seem to jive well on a sunny day of eighty de
grees. So next quarter you can look forward to restau
rants with great patios, great food and great atmo
spheres that let you show off your gorgeous tan with the
appropriate lighting. Look forward to places you can
relax in the sun with a stunning view of the hillside,
places to grab a refreshing drink and places to celebrate
the sun.
I couldn't give away all these places today, because
then I wouldn't have anything to talk about for the re
mainder of the year. So today I must bring you back to
winter quarter, to finals and to dead week.
So I was thinking of places that are good to catch a
late-night snack to keep you awake because you pro
ductively spend the entire day lazing in the sunshine.
But then I remembered that Palo Alto closes at 10
p.m., so too bad for anyone who stays awake later than
the nightly news. Some people I guess actually fall
asleep to Tom Brokaw.
In Palo Alto, there are three main places that stay
open twenty-four hours — Denny's, Jack in the Box and
Happy Donuts. So depressing in a college town, but you
have to roll with what you've got. Today I'm going to
focus on the segment of my readership that wants a
quick, inexpensive, pick-me up snack when Late Nite is

closed. And for this person, what I recommend is J-bo.
Now this is not, let me repeat, a normal recommen
dation. I would not tell you to go to Jack in the Box over
Baja Fresh, Quizno's, Chipotle. In-n-Out or the myriad
of other relatively decent fast food places. But come 3
a.m., you have limited options.
I have, in my time, become one of the designated J
bo drive-thru chauffeurs. I've become quite adept at or
dering the sourdough jack, the oreo cookie shake, 2
monster tacos, curly fries, and the extreme sausage sand
wich. Not my ideal meal by any means, but everyone
seems to crave fake-food post midnight.
J-bo has a huge menu, so chances are even the picki
est eater can find something to stomach — there is even
the option of a turkey burger or a turkey sub. So when
you're looking for greasy, salty and oh-so-bad-but
amazing-at-the-same-time food. Jack in the Box is the
place to be. Just remember to ask for ketchup. I made
that mistake once. So sad.
So this is goodbye. At least for the quarter. Stay sane
this week, and remember that you'll be over with what
ever hellish class you're taking in five to nine days.
Good luck, and remember to wear sunscreen.

for class. Or ask the one who was peacefully napping on
the hammock. (She was only planning on closing her
eyes fora second, she swears.)
The sun is a counterbalance to such a depressing pe
riod and a pleasant reminder of good times to come.
With springtime comes the desire to switch from your
Starbucks toffee nut latte to perhaps an iced chai tea or

a mocha frappacino. The desire for warm, comforting
dishes gives way to light al fresco dining. I don't know
about you, but the mm-mm-goodness of chicken pot pie
just doesn't seem to jive well on a sunny day of eighty de
grees. So next quarter you can look forward to restau
rants with great patios, great food and great atmo
spheres that let you show off your gorgeous tan with the
appropriate lighting. Look forward to places you can
relax in the sun with a stunning view of the hillside,
places to grab a refreshing drink and places to celebrate
the sun.
I couldn't give away all these places today, because
then I wouldn't have anything to talk about for the re
mainder of the year. So today I must bring you back to
winter quarter, to finals and to dead week.
So I was thinking of places that are good to catch a
late-night snack to keep you awake because you pro
ductively spend the entire day lazing in the sunshine.
But then I remembered that Palo Alto closes at 10
p.m., so too bad for anyone who stays awake later than
the nightly news. Some people I guess actually fall
asleep to Tom Brokaw.
In Palo Alto, there are three main places that stay
open twenty-four hours — Denny's, Jack in the Box and
Happy Donuts. So depressing in a college town, but you
have to roll with what you've got. Today I'm going to
focus on the segment of my readership that wants a
quick, inexpensive, pick-me up snack when Late Nite is

closed. And for this person, what I recommend is J-bo.
Now this is not, let me repeat, a normal recommen
dation. I would not tell you to go to Jack in the Box over
Baja Fresh, Quizno's, Chipotle. In-n-Out or the myriad
of other relatively decent fast food places. But come 3
a.m., you have limited options.
I have, in my time, become one of the designated J
bo drive-thru chauffeurs. I've become quite adept at or
dering the sourdough jack, the oreo cookie shake, 2
monster tacos, curly fries, and the extreme sausage sand
wich. Not my ideal meal by any means, but everyone
seems to crave fake-food post midnight.
J-bo has a huge menu, so chances are even the picki
est eater can find something to stomach — there is even
the option of a turkey burger or a turkey sub. So when
you're looking for greasy, salty and oh-so-bad-but
amazing-at-the-same-time food. Jack in the Box is the
place to be. Just remember to ask for ketchup. I made
that mistake once. So sad.
So this is goodbye. At least for the quarter. Stay sane
this week, and remember that you'll be over with what
ever hellish class you're taking in five to nine days.
Good luck, and remember to wear sunscreen.

I was intending to talk about where best to reward
yourself during Dead Week after those intense
days of studying. But then I got distracted by the
masses of people tanning in our lounge chairs, on
Wilbur field and in the Oval. I wouldn't even be sur
prised if I saw a few die-hard students pull out their
shades and bathing suit top in their 11

a.m. lecture (prime tanning hour),
open the window to free the sun rays
so cruelly blocked by the window and
chill in their butterfly chairs. Hey, it
could happen.
Spring has hit the Farm, and hope
fully it won't be moody and decide to
'peace out' like it did last year, leaving
Winter a free pass to roll through with
the thunderclouds and gloomy skies.

And while 1 do see this constant 75-
degree weather as probably an unwelcome distraction
during finals time, I do think it has its redeeming quali
ties as well.
1 don't think I've ever gone to my 9 a.m. class with
such energy as I have had in the past couple of days. My
usual routine — alarm goes off, snooze, alarm off again,
eyes open, see rain and wind, eyes close and mind thinks,
"missing one class isn't the end of the world" — is com
pletely wiped away. Instead it's — alarm goes off,
snooz, alarm off again, eyes open, sunny, warm, yay for

sunshine, yay for class — well, not yay for class per se,
but yay for walking to class on this beautiful morning.
But you can plainly see the difference in energy and
exuberance levels between the two scenarios. Ah, it's
like a shot of wheatgrass for the soul. (I mean, what bet
ter way to remind yourself you're alive during dead
week than to know skin cells are basking in the glow of
ultra-violet rays!)
It's so tempting to imagine that it's spring break al
ready. With the Time Schedule out and tanning oil gear
ing up to full force, it's easy to forget that finals are just
around the corner. Especially with my friends' AIM
profiles counting down the days to their respective trips
to Cabo.
I feel like it's partly nature's cruel joke and partly na
ture's gift to give us the sun right when we should be
trapped in our rooms reading the deluge of pages that
just didn't seem so pressing during weeks two through
nine. And the whole studying in the sunshine excuse just
doesn't work in reality. Ask the girl who was sprawled
on our patio reading John Grisham, a book clearly not
for class. Or ask the one who was peacefully napping on
the hammock. (She was only planning on closing her
eyes fora second, she swears.)
