# Cardinal Points are unnecessary
## 
### 
Residential & Dining Enterprises' points sys
tem — which was already confusing
enough in prior years — has been further
complicated by the introduction of Cardi
nal Points. Stanford Dining claims to offer students
more flexibility and options in their dining choices
through these Cardinal Points, but Cardinal Points
function exactly like the previously existing Cardi
nal Dollars. Nadeem Siddiqui, executive director of
Stanford Dining, said that the difference between
the two is their expiration dates — all but 50 Cardi
nal Points expire at the end of each quarter, where
as Cardinal Dollars roll over to subsequent quarters
of the academic year.
The creation of Cardinal Points is of no clear
benefit to those who purchase meal plans. Most stu
dents would assumedly opt for Cardinal Dollars
over Cardinal Points if they were given the choice,
since Cardinal Dollars expire on an annual rather
than quarterly basis. We question the necessity of a
distiction between Cardinal Points and Cardinal
Dollars. Why cannot Dining Services simply offer
Cardinal Dollars in place of Cardinal Points for all
of its meal plans? This is a question to which Dining
Services has not provided a direct answer. But by

creating a class of points that expire on a shorter
timeframe, it is difficult to refrain from speculating
that Stanford Dining has created the Cardinal-
Point system in order to more regularly capture stu
dents' unused points.
We would prefer a straightforward simplification
of the points system. This could be accomplished in
a manner that would benefit not just students but
also Stanford Dining itself. Stanford Dining claims
on its Web site that Meal Plan Points, Cardinal Dol
lars and Cardinal Points are all equivalent to $1.00.
If this is in fact the case, we believe it would make
sense to simply integrate all three of these into one
standard point system, and then apply this point sys
tem to all Stanford Dining locations across campus.
Not only would this create ultimate flexibility for
students, but it would also improve Stanford Din
ing's image on campus among students frusturated
by high meal costs.
Admittedly, our proposed change is likely a step
larger than what Dining Services is willing to take.
But at the very least. Dining Services should provide
us with an satisfactory explanation of why it has cre
ated the Cardinal Points / Dollars distinction —or
eliminate the distinction altogether.
