# Writing series is commendable
## 
### 
On Wednesday, March 3, the English
Department's Creative Writing pro
gram held the first reading of its new
Underground Reading Series, an at
tempt to bring talented writers who are not in
volved in the academic mainstream to campus.
The event — which featured program organizer
Stephen Elliott and local author Michelle Tea —
drew a large crowd and should be commended
for its attempt to promote diversity in the cam
pus literary scene.
The series — a brainchild of Elliott, who is
Stanford's Marsh McCall Lecturer for Creative
Writing — includes an honorarium for the visiting
writer for the reading, thus providing financial
support to authors who are not backed by Univer
sity grants or faculty postings. While the amount
paid is not large (Tea received $750), it provides
an incentive to local writers to participate in the
series and to share their experiences with Stanford
students. We hope the English Department will
continue to financially support this endeavor.
Further, by recognizing non-mainstream au-

These editorials represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of The
Daily 's editor in chief, two opinions editors and six community members at-large. Signed columns and
contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

thors such as Tea — an important and original
voice in gay and lesbian literature — the English
Department lends credibility to genres that the
University curriculum often overlooks. This is
encouraging for students who feel constrained
by academic standards and traditions for cre
ative writing.
Finally, we hope that the series will be better
advertised to students, especially undergraduates,
in much the same way as the English Depart
ment's successful Four-Minute Reading series
was. The organizers of the Underground Reading
Series have also suggested that an undergraduate
committee might be formed in order to select writ
ers who appeal to undergraduates. We believe this
is a step in the right direction. Students rarely have
a say in deciding which authors are brought to
campus, and an increased diversification of the lit
erary events at Stanford should be matched with a
simultaneous increase in student input. But we ap
plaud the English Department's efforts thus far
and urge fellow community members to attend
upcoming readings.
