# ASSU selects groups for special-fees ballot
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate last night selected which student
groups to include on the special
fees ballot this spring. The meeting
was attended by representatives
from the groups, many of whom
raised concerns about large cuts to
their groups' operating budgets.
The Appropriations Committee,
which met with student groups last
weekend to review their budget re
quests, provided recommendations
to the senators. The Senate is trying
to reduce students' special fees in
hopes of avoiding a repeat of this
year's special-fees crisis, which was
caused by high rates of refund re
quests from students. This year's
targeted reduction follows on the
heels of general reforms to the spe
cial-fees system passed by the Sen
ate during the last several weeks.
ASSU Financial Manager Kyle
Alisharan, Class of '03, empha
sized the importance of passing as
many of the recommended cuts
as possible.
"Currently, the fee is around $90
per quarter," Alisharan said. "Even
with these changes, it's still coming
to $80 per quarter."
Many of the budget cuts that were
passed were made in areas like trans
portation costs, honoraria and offi
cer salaries.
The club sports program, which

has the highest budget of any of the
special-fees groups, faces sizable
cuts to its proposed budget, pending
consideration by the Graduate Stu
dent Council on its status as a joint
group, which would make it eligible
for funding from the graduate com
munity. Group representatives said
the cuts could potentially limit trav
el for club sports teams.
"In order for club sports to be vi
able, we need to travel and compete
against other teams," said senior
Jose Guevara, the group's president.
The Senate also voted not to
place some student groups on the
ballot, including a large proportion
of performing arts groups and stu
dent publications. These groups
were deemed to have fallen outside
the Undergraduate Senate's De
clared Statement of Purpose for
Special-Fees.
"Given what we have estab
lished as general guidelines under
the Statement of Purpose, the Com
mittee felt that some of the groups
did not benefit enough of the cam
pus to be included on the ballot,"
said Committee Chair Lindsey
Love, a sophomore.
Ivan Ortiz is a coordinator of the
Barrio Assistance group, whose mem
bers tutor disadvantaged students
from surrounding areas. Ortiz pleaded
with the Senate not to exclude his
group from the special-fees vote.
"To say that Barrio Assistance does
not impact Stanford students would not
be accurate at all," he said. "Without
that money, our program would not be
able to function."
After a lengthy debate, the Senate
voted not to put Barrio Assistance on this
year's ballot. Other groups that faced a
similar decision include the a cappella
group Everyday People, the Stanford
Jazz Orchestra and Masque Magazine, a
publication for queer expression.
These groups can petition to be added

to the ballot by collecting signatures from
15 percent of the student body. Otherwise,
they can apply for funds from the ASSU's
more restrictive general-fees program.
Nonetheless, members of the Senate
said they were optimistic about the out
come of the meeting.
"The discussion we had tonight was re
ally valuable," said Senate Chair Josh
Shipp, a junior. "It was good because com
munity input was included."
Thinking long-term, he suggested that
the University could give more assistance
in the funding of student groups.
"Students provide so much to the
Stanford community that the University
is not adequately compensating for,"
Shipp said.
