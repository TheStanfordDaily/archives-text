## Thefacebook.com for dummies 
### 
Ambiguous unsolicited ad
vances. Invitations to
friendship from absolute
strangers. Poking.
This is but a glimpse of the may
hem that thefacebook.com has
wrought upon the Farm in two short
weeks. This cyber-demon has demol
ished all existing social conventions
and caused more than one panic at
tack about rejecting a random friend
listing or actually admitting you're
looking for "random play."
Order must be restored. The
facebook.com has been able to sow
such grief only because there is no
guide on how to use it appropriate
ly. Luckily, through an elaborate
stealth operation, The Daily was
able to acquire the creator's secret
thefacebook.com conduct manual.
To mollify those who have awoken
to the cold sweat of social anxiety,
what follows is an abridged version
of these official guidelines, focusing
on the areas where students are
most apt to stumble.
Heed these strategies or prepare
for your imminent social demise.
1) Approaching theface
book.com: Thefacebook.com is not
a joke. It is now the single most im
portant indication of your social
worth at Stanford. Failure to choose
the appropriate photo, profile infor
mation and friend network will lead
to elongated periods of celibacy.
2) What are you "looking for?":
For guys here, the answer is simple.
Despite only wanting to get ass, it is
essential to check all boxes includ
ing "friendship" and "relationship."
Failure to include admittedly falla
cious assertions of your interest in
commitment will only salt your
game by broadcasting your promis
cuity to all registered females. This
is neither the time nor place to be
honest. Girls are in a similar

predicament. Failure to indicate an
interest in "random play" will only
leave you seeming prudish and

thwart your ef
forts to cultivate
a meaningful re
-latio n s hi p
through theface
book.com. Thus
the clear option
for both sexes is to
simply indicate
that you are look
ing for everything.
3) Selecting
your interests: It is

essential to explicitly express your
interest in "sex." This is in no way
tool-ish or desperate, especially
since thefacebook.com is a perfectly
acceptable medium to solicit sex. In
fact, most people will be intrigued
and perhaps even turned on by your
having interests as nuanced, deep
and unique as "sex."
4) Choosing your photo: The
photo is arguably the most impor
tant component of your profile, and
you want to walk a line between
looking fun but sexy. For guys, a
great way to do this is to include a
photograph of your shirtless self,
preferably after having recently lift
ed weights. This is a subtle way to
flash your peacock feathers without
being at all ostentatious. For girls, an
artsy portrait may be the best way to
go, alluding to your mysterious in
trigue. Under no circumstances
should the photo include a stuck out
tongue or any unflattering pose, be
cause that would mean you were not
taking thefacebook.com seriously
enough (see guideline number one).
5) Friendship invitations: Grow
ing a large network is imperative, as
others will check to see how many
friends you have, and a small num
ber implies that you either are woe

fully antisocial or simply not cool. '
Or, if you actually are not cool, ;
growing a large friendship network «
will allow you to feign coolness. J
Thus it is imperative to invite any- ♦
one you have ever met to be your J
friend. Ever. This includes people J
from your freshman dorm whom *
you haven't talked to in over two J
years, people you met once at a «
party while faded, somebody whom J
you saw once in a class and anybody *
you make eye contact with when *
walking around campus. Don't J
worry, they won't reject you.
6) Poking: Due to its unmistak- J
ably sexual subtext, poking should «
only be used in the context of flirta- '
tion. If you have been biding your •
time to make a move, poking serves
as an excellent icebreaker; more- ,
over, it an excellent means of com- «
municating your carnal desires in an
impersonal, ambiguous and thus •
risk-free context. However, do keep I
in mind that not all thefacebook.com '
users may be ready for you to poke
them, especially if you sneak up on
them from behind, so this feature ;
should be approached with caution. !
Also, always remember that poking
isn't just about you. Before trying to
poke someone it may be best to
warm them up by inviting them to be
your friend first and messaging back
and forth for at least 10 or 15 min
utes. If you can stand it, go for 20 —
nobody likes a selfish poker.

facebook.com, and you should e
mail her at jagos@stanford.edu if
you too are interested in squirrel
puppets. You should also ask
Alexandra Pocek to be your
friend and then poke her. She
wanted to list "random play" as
what she's looking for, but was
just too afraid to.

Order must be restored. The
facebook.com has been able to sow
such grief only because there is no
guide on how to use it appropriate
ly. Luckily, through an elaborate
stealth operation, The Daily was
able to acquire the creator's secret
thefacebook.com conduct manual.
To mollify those who have awoken
to the cold sweat of social anxiety,
what follows is an abridged version
of these official guidelines, focusing
on the areas where students are
most apt to stumble.
Heed these strategies or prepare
for your imminent social demise.
1) Approaching theface
book.com: Thefacebook.com is not
a joke. It is now the single most im
portant indication of your social
worth at Stanford. Failure to choose
the appropriate photo, profile infor
mation and friend network will lead
to elongated periods of celibacy.
2) What are you "looking for?":
For guys here, the answer is simple.
Despite only wanting to get ass, it is
essential to check all boxes includ
ing "friendship" and "relationship."
Failure to include admittedly falla
cious assertions of your interest in
commitment will only salt your
game by broadcasting your promis
cuity to all registered females. This
is neither the time nor place to be
honest. Girls are in a similar

predicament. Failure to indicate an
interest in "random play" will only
leave you seeming prudish and

thwart your ef
forts to cultivate
a meaningful re
-latio n s hi p
through theface
book.com. Thus
the clear option
for both sexes is to
simply indicate
that you are look
ing for everything.
3) Selecting
your interests: It is

essential to explicitly express your
interest in "sex." This is in no way
tool-ish or desperate, especially
since thefacebook.com is a perfectly
acceptable medium to solicit sex. In
fact, most people will be intrigued
and perhaps even turned on by your
having interests as nuanced, deep
and unique as "sex."
4) Choosing your photo: The
photo is arguably the most impor
tant component of your profile, and
you want to walk a line between
looking fun but sexy. For guys, a
great way to do this is to include a
photograph of your shirtless self,
preferably after having recently lift
ed weights. This is a subtle way to
flash your peacock feathers without
being at all ostentatious. For girls, an
artsy portrait may be the best way to
go, alluding to your mysterious in
trigue. Under no circumstances
should the photo include a stuck out
tongue or any unflattering pose, be
cause that would mean you were not
taking thefacebook.com seriously
enough (see guideline number one).
5) Friendship invitations: Grow
ing a large network is imperative, as
others will check to see how many
friends you have, and a small num
ber implies that you either are woe

fully antisocial or simply not cool. '
Or, if you actually are not cool, ;
growing a large friendship network «
will allow you to feign coolness. J
Thus it is imperative to invite any- ♦
one you have ever met to be your J
friend. Ever. This includes people J
from your freshman dorm whom *
you haven't talked to in over two J
years, people you met once at a «
party while faded, somebody whom J
you saw once in a class and anybody *
you make eye contact with when *
walking around campus. Don't J
worry, they won't reject you.
6) Poking: Due to its unmistak- J
ably sexual subtext, poking should «
only be used in the context of flirta- '
tion. If you have been biding your •
time to make a move, poking serves
as an excellent icebreaker; more- ,
over, it an excellent means of com- «
municating your carnal desires in an
impersonal, ambiguous and thus •
risk-free context. However, do keep I
in mind that not all thefacebook.com '
users may be ready for you to poke
them, especially if you sneak up on
them from behind, so this feature ;
should be approached with caution. !
Also, always remember that poking
isn't just about you. Before trying to
poke someone it may be best to
warm them up by inviting them to be
your friend first and messaging back
and forth for at least 10 or 15 min
utes. If you can stand it, go for 20 —
nobody likes a selfish poker.

you too are interested in squirrel
puppets. You should also ask
Alexandra Pocek to be your
friend and then poke her. She
wanted to list "random play" as
what she's looking for, but was
just too afraid to.

Ambiguous unsolicited ad
vances. Invitations to
friendship from absolute
strangers. Poking.
This is but a glimpse of the may
hem that thefacebook.com has
wrought upon the Farm in two short
weeks. This cyber-demon has demol
ished all existing social conventions
and caused more than one panic at
tack about rejecting a random friend
listing or actually admitting you're
looking for "random play."
