# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Thefacebook.com's darker side 
### 
Like so many among you, I
have been caught up in this
thefacehook.com craze.
After all, it's the only thing
that's spreading faster than mono at
last week's Jell-O hash.
Many people have told me that
they are surprised that a computer sci
ence major from Harvard designed
this people-meeting service. Yeah,
I'm surprised, too, that a CS major
from socially vibrant Harvard would
try to find a novel way to meet people.
Who would have guessed that?
Now, students at Stanford. Har
vard, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cor
nell and Yale have adopted the ser
vice, with many other top-tier uni
versities on the way. However, I
think the creators of the service
should have called it something
other than "The Facebook." Per
haps "acne-ridden dork magazine"
would have worked better. I kid —
sort of. Cornell girls are hideous.
Mark Zuckerberg and Dustin
Moskovitz, the masters of the Web
site, seem only to have good inten
tions in mind when they created it.
Zuckerberg said, "I know it sounds
corny, but I'd love to improve peo
ple's lives." Corny, Mr. Zucker
berg? No, that seems downright sus
picious. Why shell out cash fora
Web site that serves other people? I
smell a rat. Moskovitz was quoted as
saying, "I don't want to elaborate
too much on our end goal / purpose,
but I will say we are not without a
plan." No one seemed to catch that
ominous statement in Friday's edi
tion of The Daily ("All the cool kids
are doing it," Mar. 5).
Just what are they up to?
Through my sources, I believe

I've uncovered their goal: They are
using the service to create a black

market. Kidneys,
gallbladders, en
dangered species
and illegal Nerf
weapons are
among the items
they seek to sell.
But what is most
frightening to me
is their hoarding
of eggs and
sperm. Stay with
me. Zuckerberg
and Moskovitz

are muscling in on the age-old egg /
sperm racket.
Ever see those ads in the back of
The Daily? They usually read some
thing like this: "Donors Wanted:
eggs from 6 ft. woman, with SATs
over 1500 and able to bench 250
lbs." Kind of specific, isn't it?
And don't you think it's peculiar
that they are only establishing the
Web site at top-tier universities
(and Cornell)? They need recruits
— smart people who have the
know-how to run a multi-million
dollar illegal racket and keep their
mouths shut. Zuckerberg and
Moskovitz aren't just trying to get
people to meet other people; no,
they are trying to build their crime
family. Al Capone used something
similar in the 1930s called "the
mugshot.com" and more recently,
Martha Stewart used "itsa
goodthing.com" to form her "Liv
ing" cadre. It's practically the oldest
trick in the book.
Not only do they need partners in
crime, but they are in desperate need of
eggs and sperm from the top one percent

of academia. With these eggs, they will
create a super race of mutant dorks, who
will be able to pass CS 235 and able to
bench twice that number.
Don't believe me? Next time you
look at your thefacebook.com pro
file, notice the different options for
relationships. You can enter that you
are seeking: "friendship / random
play / a relationship / eggs and sperm
to help build super smart people,"
And tell me you weren't suspi
cious about the "poke" option. No
one knows what it is, and the cre
ators aren't letting on. I have sever
al theories for this one.
Poking could be how they initiate
trade agreements. The eggs of a
woman with 1530 SATs would be
negotiated for cash; Stephen Cohen
of The Stanford Review's sperm
might be traded fora piece of lint. To
"poke" someone may also be a way
to initiate confidence, like they are
welcoming you into their dire, dorky
racket. Or, to "poke" could mean to
say "hi" to someone, as in a greeting.
It's definitely one of those three.
Well, thefacebook.com looks
like it is here to stay. But to Zucker
berg and Moskovitz I say: Your
plans have been unveiled and, in
time, will be foiled. You shall never
have any of my man seed, for I have
created my own network of friends.
It's called womenwhowanttosleep
withchrisholt.com. It had so many
hits the first day that the server
crashed. Take that, super dorks.

Moskovitz, the masters of the Web
site, seem only to have good inten
tions in mind when they created it.
Zuckerberg said, "I know it sounds
corny, but I'd love to improve peo
ple's lives." Corny, Mr. Zucker
berg? No, that seems downright sus
picious. Why shell out cash fora
Web site that serves other people? I
smell a rat. Moskovitz was quoted as
saying, "I don't want to elaborate
too much on our end goal / purpose,
but I will say we are not without a
plan." No one seemed to catch that
ominous statement in Friday's edi
tion of The Daily ("All the cool kids
are doing it," Mar. 5).
Just what are they up to?
Through my sources, I believe

I've uncovered their goal: They are
using the service to create a black

market. Kidneys,
gallbladders, en
dangered species
and illegal Nerf
weapons are
among the items
they seek to sell.
But what is most
frightening to me
is their hoarding
of eggs and
sperm. Stay with
me. Zuckerberg
and Moskovitz

are muscling in on the age-old egg /
sperm racket.
Ever see those ads in the back of
The Daily? They usually read some
thing like this: "Donors Wanted:
eggs from 6 ft. woman, with SATs
over 1500 and able to bench 250
lbs." Kind of specific, isn't it?
And don't you think it's peculiar
that they are only establishing the
Web site at top-tier universities
(and Cornell)? They need recruits
— smart people who have the
know-how to run a multi-million
dollar illegal racket and keep their
mouths shut. Zuckerberg and
Moskovitz aren't just trying to get
people to meet other people; no,
they are trying to build their crime
family. Al Capone used something
similar in the 1930s called "the
mugshot.com" and more recently,
Martha Stewart used "itsa
goodthing.com" to form her "Liv
ing" cadre. It's practically the oldest
trick in the book.
Not only do they need partners in
crime, but they are in desperate need of
eggs and sperm from the top one percent

of academia. With these eggs, they will
create a super race of mutant dorks, who
will be able to pass CS 235 and able to
bench twice that number.
Don't believe me? Next time you
look at your thefacebook.com pro
file, notice the different options for
relationships. You can enter that you
are seeking: "friendship / random
play / a relationship / eggs and sperm
to help build super smart people,"
And tell me you weren't suspi
cious about the "poke" option. No
one knows what it is, and the cre
ators aren't letting on. I have sever
al theories for this one.
Poking could be how they initiate
trade agreements. The eggs of a
woman with 1530 SATs would be
negotiated for cash; Stephen Cohen
of The Stanford Review's sperm
might be traded fora piece of lint. To
"poke" someone may also be a way
to initiate confidence, like they are
welcoming you into their dire, dorky
racket. Or, to "poke" could mean to
say "hi" to someone, as in a greeting.
It's definitely one of those three.
Well, thefacebook.com looks
like it is here to stay. But to Zucker
berg and Moskovitz I say: Your
plans have been unveiled and, in
time, will be foiled. You shall never
have any of my man seed, for I have
created my own network of friends.
It's called womenwhowanttosleep

hits the first day that the server
crashed. Take that, super dorks.

Like so many among you, I
have been caught up in this
thefacehook.com craze.
After all, it's the only thing
that's spreading faster than mono at
last week's Jell-O hash.
Many people have told me that
they are surprised that a computer sci
ence major from Harvard designed
this people-meeting service. Yeah,
I'm surprised, too, that a CS major
from socially vibrant Harvard would
try to find a novel way to meet people.
Who would have guessed that?
Now, students at Stanford. Har
vard, Dartmouth, Columbia, Cor
nell and Yale have adopted the ser
vice, with many other top-tier uni
versities on the way. However, I
think the creators of the service
should have called it something
other than "The Facebook." Per
haps "acne-ridden dork magazine"
would have worked better. I kid —
sort of. Cornell girls are hideous.
