# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## An ode to Spring Break (or how to get laid without really trying) 
### 
Next week, we'll all take finals,
close the book on winter quarter
and take a week off for spring
break. Many of us, including
yours truly, will use this time to go on the
eponymous Spring Break. Yeah, that.s
right, capital "S," capital "B," Spring Break
— the amazing MTV creation that glorifies
everything that's great about our nation.
At this time of the year, college kids from
all walks of life leave their monotonous rou
tines on campus and head to beaches across
the United States and its neighboring coun
tries, united in the noble pursuit of booze,
boobies and general debauchery of the
finest kind.
I will be going to Acapulco with a group of
18 gentlemen from my fraternity. Call me
crazy, but I believe this group could single
handedly solve the problem of increasing anti-
American sentiment in Mexico as we spread
... our culture, to the best of our abilities.
I'm sure young people have been going on
wild and crazy vacations for decades. But in re
cent years, there is no doubt that cultural van
guards like MTV have ingrained in our heads
the idea that during Spring Break we must
party like it's our job, birthday and birthright,
all rolled into one. And God bless them for it.
I, for one, can say that during my forma

tive years as a teenager, my eyes were glued
to the television in a Buddhist-like trance
whenever MTV Spring Break came on the

screen. Quite simply,
whether the locale was
Panama Beach, Cancun
or Miami, it just looked
like paradise.
The days were filled
with wet t-shirt contests,
never-ending drinking
games and random
hookups galore. And
then the nights made

the days look like they
were PG-rated middle-school dances.
From the looks of it, every girl seemed to
just have broken up with a boyfriend of two
years and was rearing to get hack those 24
months she wasted in a meaningless rela
tionship during her seven days of Spring
Break. Needless to say, the guys were having
the time of their lives. Coronas in hand, they
goofed around on the beach all day long;
every ridiculous night at the club had an
after-party with a hot-tub, champagne and a
two to one girl to guy ratio involved.
No longer were all of these kids in the
U.S.A. They were in the land of T. n. A. —
and they loved every second of it.

As a young tyke with hardly a whisker on
my chin, I watched these images and swore
to myself that this was my future. No matter
where 1 was at school, no matter what I was
doing in my "normal life," I was going to go
on a Spring Break trip just like this.
If my life were a movie, the music would
have approached a dramatic crescendo as
my character peered into the mirror, flexed
his prepubescent, scrawny body and vowed
that he would make this vision a reality. And
I'm proud to say 1 have.
Next week will be my third Spring Break
voyage, and with graduation just a few short
months away, 1 know that it will probably be
my last. Will I be sad to see it go? You bet
your ass I will. But I know it's my time.
Now I can only hope that more of my
classmates join in on the legacy of Spring
Break. Let's be honest — no one is ever
going to mistake Stanford fora "party
school." The bar scene in Palo Alto is nonex
istent, the Bing Wing might be the most hap
pening spot on campus and, to put it simply,
there is a significant number of students who
care more about their chem problem sets
than they could ever care about letting loose
on a given night, let alone an entire week.
But that shouldn't deter the rest of you
from going out and experiencing what most

of our peers outside our Stanford "bubble"
experience all of the time.
It's probably too late to make Spring
Break plans for this year, but I implore ev
eryone reading this column to think long
and hard about next year. When MTV plays
its Spring Break footage ad nauseam over
the next month, watch it so often that you
can recite from memory the measurements
of every contestant in the "Fashionably
Loud" wet t-shirt contest. Let it soak in,
learn to love it and start booking your tick
ets for the coming year.
If you're a little nervous about how your
peers from other (less academically chal
lenging) schools will perceive you in an en
vironment that is so different from what
you're used to at Stanford, I have a quick
anecdote that might ease your concerns.
During Spring Break my freshman year,
I went to Cancun with three friends. One
night, we were standing outside a club, wait
ing in line, when one of my buddies tried
kicking some game to the group of girls
ahead of us. Small talk ensued and the girls
eventually found out that we were from
Stanford (they went to some unmemorable
state school in the Midwest, by the way) and
they had a good laugh, at our expense, about
how we were a bunch of "smart kids" (read:

nerds) on Spring Break.
Fora moment, the prospects did not ap
pear very healthy. There was a mechanical
failure during take-off and it looked like we
were going to have to abort our mission
ASAP. And then one of the girls said quiet
ly, "My mom always wanted me to marry a
guy from Stanford ..
I needn't say where the story goes from
here. You can use your imagination.
To be honest, I could sit here all day and
give you pep talks about Spring Break — I be
lieve it's an American institution and a hall
mark of our as-of-yet indefinable generation.
And attending a school like Stanford — with
its relatively high level of academic stress and
underdeveloped social life — only accentu
ates the need to let everything go fora week.
God made the seventh day of the week
the day of rest fora reason. And I have to
believe that He stuck Spring Break in the
middle of the academic calendar fora simi
larly divine purpose. So talk to your friends,
book your flight and pack your bags. Go on,
brush your shoulders off — you're in for the
time of your life.

Next week, we'll all take finals,
close the book on winter quarter
and take a week off for spring
break. Many of us, including
yours truly, will use this time to go on the
eponymous Spring Break. Yeah, that.s
right, capital "S," capital "B," Spring Break
— the amazing MTV creation that glorifies
everything that's great about our nation.
At this time of the year, college kids from
all walks of life leave their monotonous rou
tines on campus and head to beaches across
the United States and its neighboring coun
tries, united in the noble pursuit of booze,
boobies and general debauchery of the
finest kind.
I will be going to Acapulco with a group of
18 gentlemen from my fraternity. Call me
crazy, but I believe this group could single
handedly solve the problem of increasing anti-
American sentiment in Mexico as we spread
... our culture, to the best of our abilities.
I'm sure young people have been going on
wild and crazy vacations for decades. But in re
cent years, there is no doubt that cultural van
guards like MTV have ingrained in our heads
the idea that during Spring Break we must
party like it's our job, birthday and birthright,
all rolled into one. And God bless them for it.
I, for one, can say that during my forma

tive years as a teenager, my eyes were glued
to the television in a Buddhist-like trance
whenever MTV Spring Break came on the

screen. Quite simply,
whether the locale was
Panama Beach, Cancun
or Miami, it just looked
like paradise.
The days were filled
with wet t-shirt contests,
never-ending drinking
games and random
hookups galore. And
then the nights made

the days look like they
were PG-rated middle-school dances.
From the looks of it, every girl seemed to
just have broken up with a boyfriend of two
years and was rearing to get hack those 24
months she wasted in a meaningless rela
tionship during her seven days of Spring
Break. Needless to say, the guys were having
the time of their lives. Coronas in hand, they
goofed around on the beach all day long;
every ridiculous night at the club had an
after-party with a hot-tub, champagne and a
two to one girl to guy ratio involved.
No longer were all of these kids in the
U.S.A. They were in the land of T. n. A. —
and they loved every second of it.

As a young tyke with hardly a whisker on
my chin, I watched these images and swore
to myself that this was my future. No matter
where 1 was at school, no matter what I was
doing in my "normal life," I was going to go
on a Spring Break trip just like this.
If my life were a movie, the music would
have approached a dramatic crescendo as
my character peered into the mirror, flexed
his prepubescent, scrawny body and vowed
that he would make this vision a reality. And
I'm proud to say 1 have.
Next week will be my third Spring Break
voyage, and with graduation just a few short
months away, 1 know that it will probably be
my last. Will I be sad to see it go? You bet
your ass I will. But I know it's my time.
Now I can only hope that more of my
classmates join in on the legacy of Spring
Break. Let's be honest — no one is ever
going to mistake Stanford fora "party
school." The bar scene in Palo Alto is nonex
istent, the Bing Wing might be the most hap
pening spot on campus and, to put it simply,
there is a significant number of students who
care more about their chem problem sets
than they could ever care about letting loose
on a given night, let alone an entire week.
But that shouldn't deter the rest of you
from going out and experiencing what most

of our peers outside our Stanford "bubble"
experience all of the time.
It's probably too late to make Spring
Break plans for this year, but I implore ev
eryone reading this column to think long
and hard about next year. When MTV plays
its Spring Break footage ad nauseam over
the next month, watch it so often that you
can recite from memory the measurements
of every contestant in the "Fashionably
Loud" wet t-shirt contest. Let it soak in,
learn to love it and start booking your tick
ets for the coming year.
If you're a little nervous about how your
peers from other (less academically chal
lenging) schools will perceive you in an en
vironment that is so different from what
you're used to at Stanford, I have a quick
anecdote that might ease your concerns.
During Spring Break my freshman year,
I went to Cancun with three friends. One
night, we were standing outside a club, wait
ing in line, when one of my buddies tried
kicking some game to the group of girls
ahead of us. Small talk ensued and the girls
eventually found out that we were from
Stanford (they went to some unmemorable
state school in the Midwest, by the way) and
they had a good laugh, at our expense, about
how we were a bunch of "smart kids" (read:

nerds) on Spring Break.
Fora moment, the prospects did not ap
pear very healthy. There was a mechanical
failure during take-off and it looked like we
were going to have to abort our mission
ASAP. And then one of the girls said quiet
ly, "My mom always wanted me to marry a
guy from Stanford ..
I needn't say where the story goes from
here. You can use your imagination.
To be honest, I could sit here all day and
give you pep talks about Spring Break — I be
lieve it's an American institution and a hall
mark of our as-of-yet indefinable generation.
And attending a school like Stanford — with
its relatively high level of academic stress and
underdeveloped social life — only accentu
ates the need to let everything go fora week.
God made the seventh day of the week
the day of rest fora reason. And I have to
believe that He stuck Spring Break in the
middle of the academic calendar fora simi
larly divine purpose. So talk to your friends,
book your flight and pack your bags. Go on,
brush your shoulders off — you're in for the
time of your life.
