# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Bring on spring break and leave your do-gooder desires behind 
### 
Now that the rain has stopped
(goodbye rain boots) and the
temperature has risen above the
70-degree mark, I can finally
bring up my favorite topic — spring! Who
doesn't love its perfect weather, better class
es and cute open-toed shoes? And of course,
let's not forget that pinnacle of springtime
— spring break.
Spring break is like Christmastime for
college kids. No classes, no mandatory read
ing, no alarm clocks — and for those of you
going to Mexico, no rules. Sure, it can stand
to be a little longer (I wouldn't mind an en
tire quarter of spring break), but at its cur
rent length of about ten days, most of our
parents don't even expect us to come home.
So, whether you're right here on campus,

at some exotic beach locale or in the van
you've rented for your road trip down the
coast, spring break should be a time when

you can do a lot of noth
ing and feel good about
it. See, doing nothing
over spring break feels
just as good as procrasti
nating during Dead
Week — only during
spring break, it can be
done without even the
slightest pang of guilt.
Naturally there are
still some people who ac-

tually prefer to work during spring break,
and I would love to go up to each of them
and give them a good shake and make them

end the insanity. Last week a girl in one of
my classes asked me what I was doing for
spring break and when I told her I was
going to Hawaii, she met my enthusiasm
with a look of condemnation. No, it wasn't
out of jealousy — she actually disapproved
of my trip because she is going on a com
munity service expedition to feed the starv
ing raccoons in the foothills or something
like that.
I'm not really against community ser
vice; I just don't think that spring break is
the time for it. We all lead extremely hectic
lives, and so in order to maintain an accept
able level of sanity when school is in ses
sion, we ought to take full advantage of
breaks to be a little crazy and out-right lazy.
I'm not asking anyone to get arrested reen

acting scenes from"The Real Cancun," but
I also can't advocate alternative spring
breaks trips during which students try to
save the world in between winter and
spring quarters. Not only is it unhealthy for
18- to 22-year-olds to completely eliminate
fun from their spring break schedules, but
it also makes those of us who cherish the
debauchery of a more traditional spring
break look bad.
So then, what does the fun-loving, polit
ically correct Stanford student do during
spring break? For starters, if the girl from
my class promises to carry a flask full of
tequila into the foothills to share with the
starving raccoons, I will go to a national
park while in Hawaii and learn a thing or
two about nature. Maybe the folks vaca

tioning in Mexico can take time away from
Club Med to see what the world looks like
outside of a resort and the political activists
can skip a day of protesting in White Plaza
(especially since no one's on campus any
way) to check out a nearby beach. That
way, our communities are served, the world
is saved and no one feels guilty about
spending spring break "MTV Beach
House" style.
I guess this is just another one of life's
lessons in balance. While work and play
don't really mix well in the real world, dur
ing spring break, anything goes.
