# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Econ majors beware — your kind are stingy, self-centered pigs 
### 
I bet there are hordes of wealthy in
vestors conglomerating in high rises
and chateaus, sniveling out of sympa
thy for the recently convicted Martha
Stewart. After all, she was a fellow sub
scriber to the cheater culture that — as indi
cated by the corporate swinery of World-
Com and Enron execs — multiplies like a
tumor and ain't benign. Today, these in
vestors are all crying, "It could have been
any one of us!"
See, it's like in grade school when the
teacher leaves the room. If one person par
ties, then everyone parties. On Wall Street,
everyone's been partying for years.
Armed with debate-stopping phrases
like "trickle down economics" and "class
warfare," the rich and the greedy can justify
injustices such as surrendering social ser
vices for cuts in income tax. To them, avarice
is fundamental to a functioning society and
"the pursuit of happiness" can be used inter
changeably with "material accumulation."
They assure us that self-interest is not a

vice but a patriotic duty. Ask not what your
country can do for you, but what you can do
for yourself — or what you can get other

people to do for you.
Our corporate role
models are the paragons
of this so-called rational
behavior. They manipu
late citizens through ad
vertising and pervert
law through lobbying.
As consumers, we learn
by error that trust is
merely a function of
naivete. Nothing looks

like the picture on its box. There is always a
catch. And those people chit-chatting
about hemorrhoid criime over Salisbury
steak on that airline — they are actors. We
grow so habituated to markets that we sit
idly by when politicians fall from their
shelves into the shopping carts of the high
est bidders.
We can adapt to our grossly competitive

environment by adopting cynicism and los
ing concern for others. Sure, at first glance,
it's tough to accept, but we learn to ignore
our intuitions. Who cares about what's fair
when you've got laissez-faire? Capitalism is
king and the king demands raw, unemotion
al self-interest.
To justify this, they refer us to the
economists. These are the folks who make all
the predictions and enjoy most of the finan
cial success. They ought to know best, right?
To answer this question, social scientists
set out to observe economists like monkeys
in the wild. They have returned with some
astounding revelations.
Economists are generally more self-in
terested than non-economists. This is not
just because economics attracts aspiring in
vestment bankers who dream of Ferraris
and hair plugs. A study by Robert H. Frank,
Thomas Gilovich and Dennis T. Regan
found that one course in microeconomics al
tered students' attitudes toward self-inter
est. After the course, they viewed a failure to

report a favorable billing error as more ac
ceptable than previously held. If only the
IRS would take some microeconomics ...
Those same scientists found that eco
nomics professors donate less to charity than
faculty in any other field and that economics
graduate students are less cooperative and
more corruptible in experimental settings.
An econ major friend of mine questions the
statistics of these studies based on her teach
ings in none other than an economics statis
tics class (Note: she hasn't looked at the
statistics, she just questions them).
Sounds like its getting personal, huh?
The root cause, social scientists say, is the as
sumption of human self-interest embedded
within neoclassical economics. It leads to
some serious consequences — like Republi
cans eating babies.
But the norm of self-interest is acquired
through the indoctrination of a self-fulfilling
social theory. The greedy rich use neoclassi
cal economics to justify their frigid hearts
and gold-plated fingernails. They bring ar

guments to the masses like a cool kid brings
a cigarette to the playground. One measly
puff won't get you hooked ...
Thanks to the work of economist Daniel
Kahneman and Stanford's late, great psy
chology professor Amos Tversky, psycholo
gists, sociologists, management scientists
and questioning economists have shifted
their attentions to behavioral economics —
a field where advances in social sciences can
translate easily to better economics and, in
turn, social good. This social good manifests
itself in the form of better market predic
tions, better policy decisions and a better
outlook on life.
In good time, behavioral economics will
free us of our bleak assumptions of our
neighbors — even the neoclassicists.
