OSA is working to inform student groups
As The Daily recently indicated ("Does
OSA deflect liability?", March 5), the Office
of Student Activities has been sponsoring a
number of information sessions for athletic
and recreational groups. The primary purpose
of these meetings was to introduce OSA staff,
meet the leaders of these groups and discuss
areas of interest and concern. There was dis
cussion about how to have safe events but staff
also discussed OSA resources, fundraising and
space and storage needs. It was a time to pro
vide examples of information useful to group
leaders and to answer questions. We plan to
continue these sessions covering additional re
sources. The leaders of athletic and recre
ational groups work hard to provide recre
ational activities for Stanford students. Our
goal is to provide whatever support we can to
make their jobs easier.

U.S. Postal Service deserves appreciation
For the price of one refrigerated 12-ounce
can of Diet Coke (nutritional value: none), I
can send two letters anywhere within the
3,000 miles of the United States.
Rick Geddes is right that the potential for
abuse exists in the U.S. Postal Service ("Why
the Postal Service should not be a monopoly,"

Mar. 5). But he does little to convince me that
that potential is being leveraged. Or that if it
were, holy retribution would not rain down
from the government oversight. And so I am
thankful that if my computer should sponta
neously combust and my phone run out of bat
teries. I will still have access to a fundamental
service that charges next-to-nothing fora se
cure channel of communication protected by
federal law and supported by history. Demo
cratic society as we know it cannot exist with
out the perseverance of guaranteed dialogue,
and for that —thank you Postal Service.

Column's stereotypes of athletes
and Pi Phis are unfounded
As a proud Stanford alumna of Pi Beta
Phi, soon-to-be-lawyer who double majored
and received her master's in four years at
Stanford (never once taking EDGE) and
served as class president her sophomore
year, I'm horribly offended by Bonita Song's
distasteful use of generic stereotypes that
bear no meaning on her column ("The real
question is: EDGE of what?" Mar. 3).
Had Song taken the time to get to know ei
ther group of people her column mocks, she
may not have been so critical. Some of the most
driven people I have ever met are athletes and
our school should be proud that we have the

best athletes in the country. These students put
in an extra three hours a day to practice, besides
taking classes and doing school work. Addition
ally, some of the most intelligent, articulate and
unique girls I have had the privilege to know are
Pi Phis, who contribute in such diverse ways to
the Stanford community and who do not de
serve to be limited by mere generalizations.
The very people Song demeans in her col
umn will graduate to be movers and shakers
in our country one day, not just because of
their academic abilities, but because they are
fuller, more well-rounded people for having
cared about more than just books. I would
advise Song to be more careful the next time
she writes, because her words have an impact
on a lot of people.

Duke students continue to resent
Stanford men's basketball
I applaud Dan McCarthy for his recent col
umn on, among other things, why he hates
Duke University ("Rooting for the Dukies?
Madness!", March 3). The column was a bla
tant example of the inferiority complex that
the rest of the college basketball world has
with regard to Duke.
According to McCarthy, March Madness is
great because it usually means Duke will lose.
Wow. he's really gone out on a limb here. Mc-

Carthy has predicted that one team out of 65
will not win it all. I never thought I'd live to see
such a bold prediction. Sure, Dan, the odds are
against Duke winning, but they are against all
teams winning, even your beloved Cardinal. It's
difficult to win six straight games, at least four of
which are against very tough competition.
Further, why does McCarthy, someone
who lives thousands of miles and three time
zones away, feel the need to talk negatively
about Duke? The answer is simple. Trash talk,
like gripes, moves up the ladder, not down.
Duke is No. 4 all-time in wins, has been to 13
Final Fours and has won three national titles.
Stanford, on the other hand, has one National
Championship that predates the fall of the
Third Reich, two Final Fours a, forty-five year
Tournament drought and an NIT Champi
onship. With all of this in mind, it is clear why
Stanford fans hate the Blue Devils. I would,
too. We win, and we win often. And more im
portantly we do it with the type of program that
every other school wants. We are the team
Stanford fans want theirs to be. Both schools
have basketball traditions as well academic
strengths. Both teams win with class while
graduating players and both play a brand of
team ball very rarely seen in basketball today.
But only Duke wins big on a consistent basis.
Finally, I want to point how little McCarthy
about college basketball. He claims that the
Cameron Crazies are nothing but nerds whose
knowledge of the game is limited, right before
he slams the St. Joseph's Hawks for playing a

weak schedule. He questions the validity of St.
Joseph's 27-0 record because "going 27-0
against Drexel, Duquesne and St. Bonaventure
doesn't prove a whole lot." Using his criteria,
I'd say going 26-1 against Sacramento State,
UC-Irvine, Rice, Harvard, Southern Utah and
the other Pac-10 teams doesn't prove much ei
ther. Kansas and Arizona, Stanford's supposed
big wins, were never top-10 caliber teams, at
least during the regular season. St. Joseph's
boasts the country's 32nd best schedule while
the Cardinal's comes in at 102 nd. That's a large
difference. I'd think a Stanford student
would've done his research.
All in all, McCarthy's article was laughable.
The Japanese penis joke aside, he says what all
college basketball fans think. Duke is the evil
empire. Well, as a Duke student I have no
problem with that. If McCarthy feels the need
to bash a team located so far from his cozy
dorm in California, that's okay. Knowing that
Duke creates so much frustration among peo
ple so far away is flattery in itself. We are Duke,
and we are the epitome of college basketball
— and if that pisses you off, good. I'm actually
kind of mad Stanford lost on Saturday to
Washington. I wanted Duke to be the team
that dashed the Cardinal fan's dream of an un
beaten season, if for no other reason than to
add fuel to McCarthy's hatred. It's early March
— keep pulling for your team, and hopefully
we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
