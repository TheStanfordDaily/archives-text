# New laundry program only small part of housing cost increase
## 
### ALI ALEMOZAFAR SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Costs from Student Housing's new "Just
Like Home" laundry program will be a min
imal part of the 4.5 overall percent increase
in tuition, room and board for the 2004-
2005 school year, according to Rodger
Whitney, the executive director of the Stu
dent Housing division of Residential &
Dining Enterprises.
Of the $286 increase in the undergradu
ate room rate, $44 is intended for the pro
gram. Through it, the average cost per stu
dent per laundry load will be reduced from
an average of $1.75 to a projected $1.20, a 31
percent reduction. Estimates are based on
an average student doing a load of laundry
every 1.5 weeks.
The program change would no longer
require students to pay for their laundry at
the washers and dryers. Laundry costs
would be incorporated into the room rate,
enabling a bulk of the cost to be covered
by financial aid or research fellowships
and assistantships.
The Board of Trustees set undergradu
ate tuition next year at $29,847, a 4.5 percent
increase from $28,564 this year. The stan
dard undergraduate room rate rose 6.1 per
cent, from $4,726 to $5,012, and the board
rate rose from $4,347 to $4,488 dollars, a 3.2
percent increase. The combined housing

and board rate increase is 4.7 percent.
"This actually represents less than 1 per
cent of the total room rate increase, and it is
a one-time-only impact on the room rates,"
Whitney said. "Even at a 6.1 percent in
crease, the Stanford Housing rate alone re
mains the seventh or eighth lowest among
Ivy League universities."
The other parts of the increase in the
housing rate. Whitney said, are due to fac
tors such as increased costs in debt service
because of recent housing construction and
ongoing capital improvement projects,
housing renovations, increased costs in util
ities, University salary and benefit increases
for next year, and other expenses.
"The 6.1 percent increase was also kept
at this level because of nearly $400,000 in
budget reductions [Stanford Housing Ser
vices) made over the past year," Whitney
said. "Otherwise, it might have been higher
than this 6.1 percent."
Despite efforts made to improve the
laundry program by Coinmach. the outside
vendor that operates the machines and coin
based system currently in use, the service
ratings collected by Student Housing did
not meet the division's expectations.
New washing machines and dryers will
be installed and maintained by an outside
vendor to be selected by the University in a
lottery, Whitney said. Bid packages will go
out to vendors, including Coinmach, in
March and are expected to be returned

sometime in April. The winning vendor will
install approximately l(MK) washers and dry
ers in 100 rooms over the summer in ti me for
fall quarter.
The machines to be installed will be more
water and energy-efficient, said Melissa
Purcell, manager of graduate housing oper
ations for Student Housing.
"Since the new front-loading washers
have larger capacity, use less water and
spin faster, they will reduce utilities
[costs] overall," she said. "The environ
mental impact of reducing soap and water
usage is significant."
Front-loading washers will use 50 per
cent less water and 75 percent less soap than
conventional top-loading machines, said
Rob Kolar, the housing energy manager of
Student Housing.
"Because clothes also come out much
drier after the final spin cycle, the dryers
will consume less natural gas and electrici
ty," he said.
Just Like Home'' at Stanford
A version of this plan was first proposed
last year, but was temporarily shelved due to
student complaints about its fairness and
environmental soundness. Since last fall.
Student Housing and the ASSU have been
revising the plan and presenting it to focus
groups of randomly selected students.
In focus groups run by the ASSU and

Student Housing last fall to get feedback
about the program, some students were con
cerned that it will result in an excessive use
of the laundry facilities, beyond the project
ed two loads per three weeks per student.
"We want to be very sensitive to some of
the concerns raised by some students re
garding potential energy impact of the new
system through overuse," said Imogen
Hinds, manager of undergraduate housing
operations. "We will be monitoring this
closely and engage in a very proactive edu
cation program with students to preclude
any abuse of the new program."
The overall student response to the
changes was overwhelmingly positive, ac
cording to the ASSU and Student Housing.
"A large majority of the students in the
focus groups favored the new laundry pro
gram and each focus group ended up en
dorsing the program as an overall group,"
Whitney said. "The survey indicated that 75
percent of students overall favored change."
Approximately 80 percent of all under
graduate and graduate student couples,
and nearly 70 percent of single graduate
students were in favor of the new program,
he added.
"Cost of living is a major issue for Stan
ford students and, as such, the ASSU is al
ways looking for initiatives and programs
that will cut student costs," said ASSU Pres
ident Nadiya Figueroa, a senior. "In the case
of the laundry program, the ASSU and Stu

dent Hosing have been able, over a year
timeline, to craft a program and garner stu
dent feedback to the satisfaction of both stu
dents and the University."
And across the nation ...
Conceptually, this new program is not
new to acadeinia as other universities have
switched to similar programs. The pro
gram is similar to that implemented by
Princeton University in 1996 and the State
University of New York College at
Oneonta in 2002.
After implementation of the program at
Princeton, 94 percent of students were satis
fied with the coin-less arrangement, 65 per
cent found the facilities less crowded and 67
percent noticed less equipment breakdown.
Additionally, vandalism, theft and mainte
nance were dramatically reduced.
Coin-less laundry programs are an in
creasing trend in universities across the
country, Whitney said. The new program
will be monitored over the course of the fol
lowing year to gauge its efficacy. If results
do not meet expectations, he added. Stu
dent Housing has the option of going back
to the old system.
"I believe this new program, with such
strong support from students and with our
water and energy conservation priorities
and commitments, will be a solid success,"
Whitney said.

And across the nation ...
Conceptually, this new program is not
new to acadeinia as other universities have
switched to similar programs. The pro
gram is similar to that implemented by
Princeton University in 1996 and the State
University of New York College at
Oneonta in 2002.
After implementation of the program at
Princeton, 94 percent of students were satis
fied with the coin-less arrangement, 65 per
cent found the facilities less crowded and 67
percent noticed less equipment breakdown.
Additionally, vandalism, theft and mainte
nance were dramatically reduced.
Coin-less laundry programs are an in
creasing trend in universities across the
country, Whitney said. The new program
will be monitored over the course of the fol
lowing year to gauge its efficacy. If results
do not meet expectations, he added. Stu
dent Housing has the option of going back
to the old system.
"I believe this new program, with such
strong support from students and with our
water and energy conservation priorities
and commitments, will be a solid success,"
Whitney said.
Costs from Student Housing's new "Just
Like Home" laundry program will be a min
imal part of the 4.5 overall percent increase
in tuition, room and board for the 2004-
2005 school year, according to Rodger
Whitney, the executive director of the Stu
dent Housing division of Residential &
Dining Enterprises.
Of the $286 increase in the undergradu
ate room rate, $44 is intended for the pro
gram. Through it, the average cost per stu
dent per laundry load will be reduced from
an average of $1.75 to a projected $1.20, a 31
percent reduction. Estimates are based on
an average student doing a load of laundry
every 1.5 weeks.
The program change would no longer
require students to pay for their laundry at
the washers and dryers. Laundry costs
would be incorporated into the room rate,
enabling a bulk of the cost to be covered
by financial aid or research fellowships
and assistantships.
The Board of Trustees set undergradu
ate tuition next year at $29,847, a 4.5 percent
increase from $28,564 this year. The stan
dard undergraduate room rate rose 6.1 per
cent, from $4,726 to $5,012, and the board
rate rose from $4,347 to $4,488 dollars, a 3.2
percent increase. The combined housing

and board rate increase is 4.7 percent.
"This actually represents less than 1 per
cent of the total room rate increase, and it is
a one-time-only impact on the room rates,"
Whitney said. "Even at a 6.1 percent in
crease, the Stanford Housing rate alone re
mains the seventh or eighth lowest among
Ivy League universities."
The other parts of the increase in the
housing rate. Whitney said, are due to fac
tors such as increased costs in debt service
because of recent housing construction and
ongoing capital improvement projects,
housing renovations, increased costs in util
ities, University salary and benefit increases
for next year, and other expenses.
"The 6.1 percent increase was also kept
at this level because of nearly $400,000 in
budget reductions [Stanford Housing Ser
vices) made over the past year," Whitney
said. "Otherwise, it might have been higher
than this 6.1 percent."
Despite efforts made to improve the
laundry program by Coinmach. the outside
vendor that operates the machines and coin
based system currently in use, the service
ratings collected by Student Housing did
not meet the division's expectations.
New washing machines and dryers will
be installed and maintained by an outside
vendor to be selected by the University in a
lottery, Whitney said. Bid packages will go
out to vendors, including Coinmach, in
March and are expected to be returned

sometime in April. The winning vendor will
install approximately l(MK) washers and dry
ers in 100 rooms over the summer in ti me for
fall quarter.
The machines to be installed will be more
water and energy-efficient, said Melissa
Purcell, manager of graduate housing oper
ations for Student Housing.
"Since the new front-loading washers
have larger capacity, use less water and
spin faster, they will reduce utilities
[costs] overall," she said. "The environ
mental impact of reducing soap and water
usage is significant."
Front-loading washers will use 50 per
cent less water and 75 percent less soap than
conventional top-loading machines, said
Rob Kolar, the housing energy manager of
Student Housing.
"Because clothes also come out much
drier after the final spin cycle, the dryers
will consume less natural gas and electrici
ty," he said.
Just Like Home'' at Stanford
A version of this plan was first proposed
last year, but was temporarily shelved due to
student complaints about its fairness and
environmental soundness. Since last fall.
Student Housing and the ASSU have been
revising the plan and presenting it to focus
groups of randomly selected students.
In focus groups run by the ASSU and

Student Housing last fall to get feedback
about the program, some students were con
cerned that it will result in an excessive use
of the laundry facilities, beyond the project
ed two loads per three weeks per student.
"We want to be very sensitive to some of
the concerns raised by some students re
garding potential energy impact of the new
system through overuse," said Imogen
Hinds, manager of undergraduate housing
operations. "We will be monitoring this
closely and engage in a very proactive edu
cation program with students to preclude
any abuse of the new program."
The overall student response to the
changes was overwhelmingly positive, ac
cording to the ASSU and Student Housing.
"A large majority of the students in the
focus groups favored the new laundry pro
gram and each focus group ended up en
dorsing the program as an overall group,"
Whitney said. "The survey indicated that 75
percent of students overall favored change."
Approximately 80 percent of all under
graduate and graduate student couples,
and nearly 70 percent of single graduate
students were in favor of the new program,
he added.
"Cost of living is a major issue for Stan
ford students and, as such, the ASSU is al
ways looking for initiatives and programs
that will cut student costs," said ASSU Pres
ident Nadiya Figueroa, a senior. "In the case
of the laundry program, the ASSU and Stu

dent Hosing have been able, over a year
timeline, to craft a program and garner stu
dent feedback to the satisfaction of both stu
dents and the University."
