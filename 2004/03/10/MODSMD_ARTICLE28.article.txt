# Scientist claims arms reduction is best defense
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
Citing arms reduction and im
proved intelligence as the best meth
ods against national security threats.
Dr. Richard Garwin discussed nu
clear weapons at Cubberley Audito
rium last night.
Garwin —2002 National Medal
of Science Recipient and Senior Fel
low for Science and Technology at
the Council on Foreign Relations —
warned, "There will be terrorist nu
clear explosions in cities."
The reduction of U.S. and Russ
ian nuclear weapons stockpiles from
over 10,000 currently to 2,000 and
then 1,000, Garwin said, would make
terrorist acquisition increasingly dif
ficult. He also noted the need to con
solidate plutonium and highly en
riched uranium into fewer sites, es
pecially in Russia where the govern
ment does not have the resources to
provide adequate security for its nu
clear weapons.
Although North Korea and Iran
could be developing nuclear
weapons, Garwin cited terrorism as
the greatest threat to national securi
ty today.
"In New York, a nuclear explo
sion could kill up to 200,000 people,"
Garwin said. "There is a higher prob
ability that a few people will use nu
clear weapons without restraint not
because of valid political reasons, but
because they want to kill people."
To combat the threat, Garwin

supports increased spending on
diplomatic measures and intelli
gence. In particular, Garwin cited
the cost of the Nunn-Lugar program
which removed the nuclear weapons
from Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Be
larus after the fall of the U.S.S.R. and
destroyed over 5,000 nuclear
weapons to date.
"We need to compare the $ 1 bil
lion for the Nunn-Lugar Coopera
tive Threat reduction program with
the $87 billion for less than a year
in Iraq," Garwin said. "These are
real weapons of mass destruction
we are talking about here com
pared to the ones in Iraq that in my
mind do not exist."
Bush has established the Prolif
eration Security Initiative (PSI) to
deal with the threat, but Garwin
dismissed the PSI as "words but
not actions."
"These issues will have higher
priority after the first nuclear explo
sion in our cities," Garwin said.
Co-Director of the Center for In
ternational Security and Coopera
tion Dr. Christopher Chyba said that
there is currently a debate about
whether the United States should re
sume nuclear weapons testing to de
velop new warheads. Some contend
that an "agent defeat" nuclear
weapon, for example, could poten
tially destroy biological and chemical
weapons without sending them up
into the atmosphere.
Garvin is unconvinced.
"I have seen no calculation of

doing what is advertised without re
leasing undestroyed material into
the atmosphere," Garwin said.
Garwin also expressed disap
proval over the U.S. Senate's failure
to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT) under the Clinton
Administration. The CTBT would
have banned all nuclear testing, ex
tended the Non Proliferation Treaty
indefinitely, and provided more inter
national monitoring systems.
According to Garwin, senators

voted against ratification because they
thought nuclear testing would ensure
the reliability and safe maintenance of
current nuclear weapons and that the
low level weapons testing would not
be detectable in other countries.
Garvin does not see nuclear test
ing as necessary to ensure reliability.
"Eisenhower said that the failure
to achieve a comprehensive test ban
treaty was the greatest failure of his
administration and of any adminis
tration," he said.
