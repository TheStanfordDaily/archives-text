# Cardinal Today
## No. 2 Card tries to rebound in L.A. 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford men's baskeball team will
look to start another winning streak tomorrow,
when it takes on Washington State in the first
round of the Pacific-10 Conference Tournament.
Despite a rough weekend in Washington that
witnessed the Cardinal's first loss of the season to
Washington and a last-second escape from Wash
ington State, Stanford still won the Pac-10 by five
games and is not only the top seed at this weekend's
tourney in Los Angeles but also the clear favorite
to win the tournament.
Fora Stanford squad that wasn't proud of its
performance last weekend, the usually loathsome
Pac-10 Tournament offers a nice, quick chance at
redemption — and a chance to enter the NCAA
Tournament on a high note.
The Cardinal (26-1, 17-1 Pac-10) will face the
Cougars (13-15,7-11) at the Staples Center at 12:20
p.m. tomorrow. Dick Bennett's Washington State
squad is the last team in the field, squeaking in as
the No. 8 seed after beating California on Saturday,
70-58, to finish one game ahead of Oregon State.
Despite the Cougars' unimpressive record, last
Thursday's contest — won by Stanford, 63-61, only
after senior guard Matt Lottich swished a despera
tion shot at the buzzer — will be fresh in the minds
of the Stanford players.
"With Dick Bennett this year, they've really im
proved as a team," Stanford head coach Mike
Montgomery said. "Now we're all in the situation
where it's one loss and you're out."
The Cardinal is a lock for the NCAA Tourna
ment regardless of its performance this weekend,
while the Cougars would need to win the Pac-10
tourney to get in (the winner receives the Pac-10's
automatic Tournament bid regardless of its record,
ratings percentage index or any other factor).
Stanford knows that it has what it takes to beat
every team it plays this weekend, but it had that
same ability last weekend and came up short, so the
team is hoping to come out with better energy this
time around.
"Looking at the tapes of the Washington and

Washington State games, we sure didn't look like
the same team we looked like the rest of the year,"
Montgomery said. "I don't know what the reason
for that is, but I definitely do think there was some
pressure."
And it showed.
In its 75-62 loss to Washington last Saturday,
Stanford looked sluggish on the defensive end, fail
ing to rotate quickly enough in its zone defense to
cover up Tre Simmons, who hit three 3-pointers to
quell the Cardinal's second-half comeback at
tempt. Offensively, Stanford alternated between
rushed shots — the Cardinal threw up 24 3-point
attempts, many of them rushed, making just five of
them — and tentativeness.
"We were rushing stuff. We weren't making the
second and third pass," sophomore point guard
Chris Hernandez said of the team's offense against
ihe Huskies.
Hernandez supplied much of the team's energy,
scoring 21 points on a variety of strong drives to the
hoop. As floor general, he wants to set a strong
tone this weekend.
The Cougars game, with its miraculous finish,
seems miles away after Saturday's loss. But Stan
ford took away a lot of important lessons about
Washington State's personnel.
Forward Jeff Varem was an all-around terror,
and the anticipated return from injury of Stanford
forward Justin Davis should go a long way toward
neutralizing the Cougars' most energetic, dynamic
player — the type of athlete that the Cougars had
so notably missed in recent years.
Varem had 14 points, a team-high nine re
bounds and four assists against Stanford; he is av
eraging 9.5 points and 4.1 rebounds per game this
season.
The Cougars traditionally get most of their of
fense from their backcourt combination of senior
Marcus Moore and junior Thomas Kelati. Moore
had 14 and Kelati had 12 points against Stanford.
The pair has excellent height, helping them on
both ends of the floor. Moore, a 6-foot-6 shooting
guard, has struggled this year, scoring 13.4 points
per game on 37.4 percent shooting (including just
25.4 percent accuracy from long range), but leads

the team in assists (3.8 points per game) and re
mains the dangerous athlete that attracted notice
able interest from NBA teams last year.
Kelati is a 6-foot-5 point guard and excellent
team player, with one of the best pure 3-point shots
in the Pac-10. He averages 11.4 points and shoots
45.2 percent from downtown and 96.3 percent from
the free-throw line.
Should Stanford beat the Cougars, it will face
the winner of the California-Oregon matchup on
Friday at 6:15 p.m.
Should the Cardinal win that game as well, it will
face Washington, Arizona, Southern California or
UCLA in the tournament final at 3:15 p.m. on Sat
urday. All games will be televised on Fox Sports
Net.
"We want to win the Pac-10 Tournament, not
just go and play and feel good about ourselves,"
Hernandez said.
It sounds like the Cardinal, which was perfectly
untouchable for so much of the season, finally has
a chip on its shoulder.
And that's probably a good thing.
"We're coming down to win, we're coming
down to play [hard]," Montgomery said. "The kids
are excited."
