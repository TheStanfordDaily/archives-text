# Deadlines approach for Research College
## 
### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WAITER 
Students who are pondering
what to do over the summer still
have the option of applying for
Summer Research College
(SRC). SRC is an eight- to 10-
week residential program that al
lows Stanford students to partici
pate in departmental and faculty
led research. Program partici
pants will be housed in Roble Hall
from June 20 to Aug. 27. Dead
lines for applications vary by de
partment, and some are set for as
early as this week.
SRC started four years ago
with the purpose of fostering
close intellectual and social con
tact between students and faculty.
The program has progressed
from 70 participants to an expect
ed 310 students.
The program is not itself a
source of funding for summer re
search. Students who participate
in SRC are expected to pay room,
board and house dues, as well as
the University summer bill and
other academic expenses.
However, students can obtain
funding through a departmental
research program, a Vice Provost
of Undergraduate Education
Faculty Grant for Undergraduate
Research or a Undergraduate
Research Office Major Grant.
Grant applications are available
through Undergraduate Re
search Programs.
Since SRC aims to encourage
cross-disciplinary scholarly in
quiry, a variety of intellectual and
social activities are planned for
students. Junior Satoko Kakihara,
who participated in the program
last year and will be staffing this
year, noted that one of the high
lights of the program was the resi
dential aspect.
"Living in a dorm with a good
community of people who are
interested in research is great,"
she said. "It's good to have a
support system of other students
who're also working on indepen
dent research."
According to SRC assistant
program director and previous
program participant Ben David-

son, a senior, aft avaiaae week in -
cludes a dinner with a faculty
guest, an academic workshop and
two social events.
"SRC is intended to enrich un
dergraduates' summer research
experience," Davidson said. "We
hope that students in SRC will
learn about each others' research,
gain further appreciation for
scholarship, learn about available
resources through academic work
shops, make lasting friendships
and have fun."
Applying for SRC is a two
step process. First, to apply for
research positions, students
should contact the department
and faculty directly to find out if
research opportunities are avail
able for the summer. Each de
partment has its own selection
criteria and decisions are made
by faculty committees.
Approximately 30 depart
ments offer summer research op
portunities, including the depart
ments of Cultural and Social An
thropology, Economics, Human
Biology, International Relations,
Linguistics, Political Science, Psy
chology, Chemistry, Electrical
Engineering, Mechanical Engi
neering and Physics. Fora com
plete list, see the Undergraduate
Research Programs Web site.
The second step in applying for
SRC is registering to live in Roble
over the summer. Students al
ready accepted into a departmen
tal summer research program re
ceive priority in applying for sum
mer housing. The priority registra
tion period is set tentatively for
Monday, March 29 through
Thursday, April 8.
A second, "open" registration
period allows all other students to
apply for Roble housing through
Axess, according to regular Hous
ing Assignment Services summer
application deadlines.
"Demand for SRC beds is very
high, and it is likely that we won't
be able to meet full demand for
SRC slots during the Open SRC
Registration period," said Susie
Brubaker-Cole, assistant vice
provost for Undergraduate Edu
cation and director of Undergrad
uate Research Programs.
