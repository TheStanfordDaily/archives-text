# Justin Davis prepares for final goodbye
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
On Senior Day two Saturdays ago, a few hours after he
walked to center court to greet his crying mother with roses
and a hug, senior forward Justin Davis addressed a sellout
Maples Pavilion crowd that stayed to celebrate then-No. 1
Stanford's final home game of the season.
Davis was handed a microphone and asked to address the
crowd.
"I've been here a long time," he laughed as the Sixth Man
Club cheered. "Thanks for all your support."
The speech — Davis's farewell to Maples — had been a
long time coming in many ways.
The fifth-year senior will openly tell you that "he's been
here forever," and while that particular game represented
the last time he'd be introduced on the bouncy floors, Davis's
final game at Maples — although he didn't know it at the
time — was played a month earlier on Jan. 24 against USC.
The following week, he injured his left knee (for the
second time in his career) while playing against Oregon
State in Corvallis.
Justin Davis didn't get a traditional Senior Day.
After Davis's speech, Stanford head coach Mike Mont
gomery talked about Davis the person, noting how much he
had matured over the years — how his words that day, his
ability to speak in front of a crowd like that, really showed
how much he's grown over the years.
Montgomery said that the best part of his job was getting
to see players like Davis mature.
In truth, we've only seen glimpses of the player Davis is
capable of becoming on the court, only shadows of a poten
tial truth. A breakout performance here, a double-double
there, a sustained all-around effort becoming increasingly
consistent and reliable as each game passed.
He just wanted to contribute.
And then there were the injuries — all untimely and un
expected. The sprained ankle and strained abdominal mus
cle during his redshirt freshman year, the bruised ribs his
sophomore year, neither of which were as devastating as in
juries to his left knee during his junior and senior campaigns
— a bone bruise and a partially torn ligament — an injury
that he is still battling now.
Last season, that same injury cost him five Pacific-10
Conference games, and while he returned to action before
the end of the regular season, it took Davis several games
to get back into shape, rediscover his touch and look com
fortable on the court with both his knee and the brace he
was told to wear.
This year, the recovery time has been double that. Davis
has missed 10 games already, but hopes to make his return
on Thursday in the first round of the Pac-10 Tournament in
Los Angeles.
"I don't know [if I'll play]," Davis said. "I'm sure if things
go well in practice this week, I '11 probably get thrown into the

mix a little bit."
He pauses, shrugs.
"But I don't know,"he says in a reflective tone.
On Monday, Davis participated in his first practice since
the Jan. 29 injury.
"[The knee] feels pretty good, considering the fact that
I've been off of it for awhile and I haven't practiced much on
it," Davis reported after practice. "Right now, I'm just start
ing to move around on it."
"If everything goes well, he'll probably get a little time
on Thursday," Montgomery said. "I do think that if we can
get some games in the [Pac-10] tournament, get Justin
back on the floor.. . [and] get some rust off him," that
would be helpful.
"Hopefully [his return] will give us the chance to be a lit
tle more flexible, move Nick [Robinson] out on the perime
ter," Montgomery continued.
Before hurting his left knee, Davis was averaging 11.5
points and seven rebounds in 17 games, including a pair of
21-point performances against UNLV and UCLA, 18 points
and nine boards against Gonzaga and a team-leading 17
points against Washington.
However, what is most interesting about Davis — what is
most captivating about this 6-foot-9 forward from Berkeley
who, off the court, at times, radiates confidence and charis
ma — is the vulnerability he's shown in the wake of so much
potential.
Potential.
It's a big word that seems more applicable to Davis than
to any other person on this Cardinal team.
On the surface, Davis tries to remain optimistic, cracking
jokes in the locker room with his teammates and during press
conferences in front of hordes of media.
He's got an intriguing mix of seeming invincibility and sar
castic self-awareness.
Two weeks ago, after the Cardinal had beaten up on Ore
gon State, 73-47, at Maples Pavilion, Davis ambled into the
post-game press conference to discuss the disappointing
news of an MRI exam that had taken place earlier that day.
The MRI revealed that Davis wouldn't be returning to
play against the Washington schools the following week like
Montgomery had hoped.
As he sat down, one reporter quickly asked him about his
mentality with regard to the injury.
"The way I look at it, I'm going to play tomorrow," said a
serious Davis.
"And what did the MRI show?" the reporter followed up.
Davis paused, smiled and answered, "that I'm not going
to be playing tomorrow."
It was one of those moments, one of those truthful times
in sports, when that tension between desire and ability was
painfully thrust into the forefront for all to see.

Senior forward Justin Davis has battled injuries throughout his Stanford career. He is cur
renHv sidelined with a bone bruise to his right knee, but hopes to return to action for this
weekend's Pac-10 Tournament.
Two weeks ago, the MRI revealed that the bone
in his left knee was still bruised, and at the time he
remained optimistic about his ability to play
through the pain once he returns to the court.
"You can definitely play with a little bone bruise
— a little boo-boo," Davis joked.
Along with the laughter, the frustration is there,
as well, for those who care to see it, hidden behind a
strong exterior, which tries to roll with life's (and
basketball's) punches as they come.
"The injury was a little disappointing," Davis
said. "I was probably playing my best and most con
sistent basketball sense I've been here at Stanford."
He hasn't exactly gotten a "fair" chance to show
what he's got — not this season or any season at
Stanford, for that matter.
But then again, what's fair got to do with it?
That said, Davis impressed enough people dur
ing the first seven conference games to warrant an
AII-Pac-10 honorable mention award.
Awards aside, right now, in truth, he's facing the
reality that as every day passes, as every week goes
by, the chances that he'll ever be at full strength this
season are diminishing considerably.
Always confident, however, not being 1 (X) per
cent isn't Davis's primary concern right now.
"Eighty percent," he laughs. "Eighty percent is
enough."
After all, he just wants to contribute — to be a
part of it again and, most of all, say goodbye to Stan
ford the right way.
