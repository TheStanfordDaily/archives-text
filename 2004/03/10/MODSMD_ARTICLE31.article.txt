# Pac-10 Tournament Champs!
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
When Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer, who has coached 766 NCAA bas
ketball games, opens a press conference by
saying, "That was a really strange game,"
there must have been some pretty weird stuff
going on.
The No. 12 Stanford women's basketball
team (24-6) shot just 31.6 percent and was
outrebounded, 44-32, but still managed to
overcome a 16-point deficit to No. 2 seed
Arizona (24-8) to take home the Pac-10
Tournament title, 51-46, and the automatic
NCAA Tournament bid that goes with it.
Despite playing from behind for nearly
the entire game, the seasoned Cardinal squad
was able to weather a red-hot start from the
Wildcats and convert when it came down to
crunch time.
"What helps with experience is that you
know you're never out of it," said junior
guard Kelley Suminski. "None of us really
were panicking. We're worried about the
outcome of the game, but we knew we'd
come around. Basically, we just had to step
up and start playing the way we played ail
season."
And down the stretch, that's exactly what
Stanford was able to do. After chipping away
at Arizona's lead, the Cardinal took its first
lead of the game with 3:53 to go on a Sebnem
Kimyacioglu 3-pointer — her only shot of
the game.
However, the Wildcats answered with a
three from junior point guard Dee-Dee
Wheeler to regain the lead.
But senior Ail-American forward Nicole
Powell responded by giving the Cardinal the
lead for good by hitting two free throws after
being fouled on a drive to the basket with
2:22 on the clock.
Powell — who finished with 24 points, 3
rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and the Tourna
ment's Most Outstanding Player honors —
showed extreme poise down the stretch, con

verting on all six of her attempts from with
charity stripe in the final 2:22.
Arizona star center Shawntinice Polk, on
the other hand, missed 3-of-4 free throw at
tempts in the final 1:28.
The 6-foot-5 Polk dominated the boards
all night — finishing with 18 rebounds — but
primary defender T'Nae Thiel limited her to
just eight points on 3-of-6 shooting from the
floor. The junior got help from senior center
Chelsea Trotter, Powell and freshman center
Kristen Newlin in keeping Polk under wraps.
Thiel, who gives up four inches to Polk,
kept her out of her comfort zone by either
fronting the sophomore or winning the posi
tion battle and keeping her out of the paint.
The 21-point turnaround was all the more
remarkable as Arizona came out of the gates
absolutely on fire. The Wildcats started the
game by hitting 10 of their first 18 field goals,
including three treys, while the Cardinal was
absolutely ice cold.
"They seemed to hit everything they were
shooting," said VanDerveer, who recorded
her 599 th career win. "We, I thought, looked
frantic. We just rushed in every aspect of our
offense."
Powell was the only Cardinal to score until
just 10:21 remained in the half, when Trotter
converted a layup.
And even when Stanford managed to
score, Arizona always had the answer. After
a Powell 3-pointer, the Wildcats went on a 3
1/2 minute, 12-2 run, putting themselves up
by 16.
The Cardinal, however, kept its cool,
made a key adjustment and went on a run of
its own.
After switching to a zone defense, Stan
ford closed out the half with an 8-0 run —
with junior guard Susan Borchardt scoring all
eight points.
Borchardt's clutch play very nearly could
have been absent from the Cardinal lineup.
In Stanford's first game of the tournament,
an 80-55 blowout of California. Borchardt
got tangled up with several Bears and went

down clutching her right knee — the same
knee that kept her out of nearly two seasons
of play and required three surgeries.
Borchardt had to be helped off the court
and was expected to be out for the remainder
of the weekend, but the injury was not as se
rious as originally anticipated and the gritty
junior, with a heavily wrapped knee, was in
the starting lineup for the Cardinal's semifi
nal matchup with UCLA.
In addition to coming through on the of
fensive end, Borchardt played the top of
Stanford's 2-3 zone along with Suminski and
severely limited the effectiveness of All-Pac
-10 selection Wheeler.
"We owe our Pac-10 championship to our
zone defense," VanDerveer said. "We went
into our zone, people really moved in it well,
especially in the second half when we were
able to save our fouls, and then we could be
very aggressive at the end of the game and
not have to pay for it at the free-throw line."
Had it not been for that zone defense,
which was almost never used during the reg
ular season, Stanford might not have even
been in the championship game to begin
with.
On Sunday, the Cardinal came back from
11 points down against the Bruins (17-12),
whose dynamic backcourt duo of sophomore
Nikki Blue and freshman Noelle Quinn was
unable to solve Stanford's zone.
It was Suminski, who was named to the
All-Tournament Team, who came through
against UCLA, shooting 5-of-7 from down
town to lead Stanford with 18 points.
And while the Cardinal was forced to ex
pend a great deal of energy to capture the
Pac-10 Title, it seems to have given them the
right mentality heading into the NCAA
Tournament.
"Right now it's just about winning, about
surviving," Powell said. "We were in a tough
game and we didn't want to be down, espe
cially to a team like Arizona, but that's the
situation we put ourselves in and you just
have to find a way to win."

outrebounded, 44-32, but still managed to
overcome a 16-point deficit to No. 2 seed
Arizona (24-8) to take home the Pac-10
Tournament title, 51-46, and the automatic
NCAA Tournament bid that goes with it.
Despite playing from behind for nearly
the entire game, the seasoned Cardinal squad
was able to weather a red-hot start from the
Wildcats and convert when it came down to
crunch time.
"What helps with experience is that you
know you're never out of it," said junior
guard Kelley Suminski. "None of us really
were panicking. We're worried about the
outcome of the game, but we knew we'd
come around. Basically, we just had to step
up and start playing the way we played ail
season."
And down the stretch, that's exactly what
Stanford was able to do. After chipping away
at Arizona's lead, the Cardinal took its first
lead of the game with 3:53 to go on a Sebnem
Kimyacioglu 3-pointer — her only shot of
the game.
However, the Wildcats answered with a
three from junior point guard Dee-Dee
Wheeler to regain the lead.
But senior Ail-American forward Nicole
Powell responded by giving the Cardinal the
lead for good by hitting two free throws after
being fouled on a drive to the basket with
2:22 on the clock.
Powell — who finished with 24 points, 3
rebounds, 3 assists, 2 steals and the Tourna
ment's Most Outstanding Player honors —
showed extreme poise down the stretch, con

verting on all six of her attempts from with
charity stripe in the final 2:22.
Arizona star center Shawntinice Polk, on
the other hand, missed 3-of-4 free throw at
tempts in the final 1:28.
The 6-foot-5 Polk dominated the boards
all night — finishing with 18 rebounds — but
primary defender T'Nae Thiel limited her to
just eight points on 3-of-6 shooting from the
floor. The junior got help from senior center
Chelsea Trotter, Powell and freshman center
Kristen Newlin in keeping Polk under wraps.
Thiel, who gives up four inches to Polk,
kept her out of her comfort zone by either
fronting the sophomore or winning the posi
tion battle and keeping her out of the paint.
The 21-point turnaround was all the more
remarkable as Arizona came out of the gates
absolutely on fire. The Wildcats started the
game by hitting 10 of their first 18 field goals,
including three treys, while the Cardinal was
absolutely ice cold.
"They seemed to hit everything they were
shooting," said VanDerveer, who recorded
her 599 th career win. "We, I thought, looked
frantic. We just rushed in every aspect of our
offense."
Powell was the only Cardinal to score until
just 10:21 remained in the half, when Trotter
converted a layup.
And even when Stanford managed to
score, Arizona always had the answer. After
a Powell 3-pointer, the Wildcats went on a 3
1/2 minute, 12-2 run, putting themselves up
by 16.
The Cardinal, however, kept its cool,
made a key adjustment and went on a run of
its own.
After switching to a zone defense, Stan
ford closed out the half with an 8-0 run —
with junior guard Susan Borchardt scoring all
eight points.
Borchardt's clutch play very nearly could
have been absent from the Cardinal lineup.
In Stanford's first game of the tournament,
an 80-55 blowout of California. Borchardt
got tangled up with several Bears and went

down clutching her right knee — the same
knee that kept her out of nearly two seasons
of play and required three surgeries.
Borchardt had to be helped off the court
and was expected to be out for the remainder
of the weekend, but the injury was not as se
rious as originally anticipated and the gritty
junior, with a heavily wrapped knee, was in
the starting lineup for the Cardinal's semifi
nal matchup with UCLA.
In addition to coming through on the of
fensive end, Borchardt played the top of
Stanford's 2-3 zone along with Suminski and
severely limited the effectiveness of All-Pac
-10 selection Wheeler.
"We owe our Pac-10 championship to our
zone defense," VanDerveer said. "We went
into our zone, people really moved in it well,
especially in the second half when we were
able to save our fouls, and then we could be
very aggressive at the end of the game and
not have to pay for it at the free-throw line."
Had it not been for that zone defense,
which was almost never used during the reg
ular season, Stanford might not have even
been in the championship game to begin
with.
On Sunday, the Cardinal came back from
11 points down against the Bruins (17-12),
whose dynamic backcourt duo of sophomore
Nikki Blue and freshman Noelle Quinn was
unable to solve Stanford's zone.
It was Suminski, who was named to the
All-Tournament Team, who came through
against UCLA, shooting 5-of-7 from down
town to lead Stanford with 18 points.
And while the Cardinal was forced to ex
pend a great deal of energy to capture the
Pac-10 Title, it seems to have given them the
right mentality heading into the NCAA
Tournament.
"Right now it's just about winning, about
surviving," Powell said. "We were in a tough
game and we didn't want to be down, espe
cially to a team like Arizona, but that's the
situation we put ourselves in and you just
have to find a way to win."
