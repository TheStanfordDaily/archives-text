# Cardinal beginning to show Big Dance attitude

### TERRY HURLBUTT SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford women's basketball team (24-
6) led Monday night's game against the University of
Arizona for less than four full minutes.
Fortunately, that was just enough to seal the deal,
and the Cardinal garnered its second Pacific-10 Confer
ence Tournament championship in as many years by
defeating its regular season co-champion. 51-46, thanks

primarily to its defensive effort.
Stanford's numbers were hardly impressive, but the
team's win was, as it showcased qualities needed to
make a run in March.
Arizona opened the game with a stellar offensive
performance, leading 31-15 with just under five minutes
to play in the half. Stanford, unable to find an offensive
rhythm of its own, was in dire straights — only seniors
Nicole Powell and Chelsea Trotter had scored for the
Cardinal and they were sitting on the bench fora quick

breather.
Where lesser teams might have panicked, Stanford
reached deep and made a key adjustment by moving to
a zone defense and the Wildcats did not score for the
rest of the half.
On the other end of the floor, team leader Susan
Borchardt took matters into her own hands and spear
headed her team's comeback, going on an 8-0 run in
cluding knocking down two key 3-pointers on her way
to an 11-point game.

That run shaved Stanford's deficit to eight and the
team that took to the court for the second half barely re
sembled the group that played in the first.
The Cardinal hustled all over the floor — knocking
balls loose, collapsing inside on Arizona's formidable
center Shawntinice Polk and getting in the faces of
sharpshooters Aimee Grzyb and Dee-Dee Wheeler.
While the Wildcats have faced zones successfully be-
fore, Stanford's gamble worked and Arizona was held to only 15
points in the second half.
"We won because of our defense," said head coach Tara Van-
Derveer. "We were able to keep fresh posts in there and we lim
ited them to just one shot and rebounded better out of [the
zone]. We had a great effort tonight."
"They went to a zone and I thought we were a little bit hesi
tant," said Arizona head coach Joan Bonvicini. "It changed the
tempo for us. Stanford is a great basketball team and they
showed a great deal of character and poise."
Throughout numerous games this season, the Cardinal has
been forced to draw from that well of strength, but this tourna
ment proved how far this team has come. Remaining steady,
Stanford slowly but surely chipped away at the Arizona lead be
hind 24 points from the tournament's Most Outstanding Player,
Powell, and key 3-point shots from junior guards Kelly Sumins
ki and Sebnem Kimyacioglu.
"We've had a lot of experience being in this situation," said
Borchardt. "We stay together and don't give up."
The win was especially meaningful for the Cardinal, which
dropped four conference games and played a competitive Pac
-10 schedule. Fora team loaded with talent, it is precisely this
blend of defensive grit and offensive resolve that just might carry
the day in March.
"I'm really excited to be going into [the NCAA Tournament]
with people digging down," VanDerveer said. "This team bent
in the regular season but we didn't bend in this tournament. We
learned a lot about ourselves."
