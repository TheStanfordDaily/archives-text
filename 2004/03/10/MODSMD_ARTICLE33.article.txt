# Men fall one short of perfection, upset by UW
## 
### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. — And just like that, it
was over.
Finally? ... Over.
The steak, the dream of an undefeated sea
son, the No. 1 ranking and the endless com
parisons with undefeated St. Joseph's — all
the talk about history and all the hoopla
ended Saturday afternoon in front of a na
tional television audience and a record crowd
of 10,086 at Bank of America Arena in Seat
tle, where the Stanford men's basketball team
(26-1,17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) lost its first
game this season, 75-62, to Washington (17-
10,12-6).
The loss — the Cardinal's first since
March 22,2003, when the Cardinal fell 85-74
in the second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment to Connecticut — ended Stanford's his
tory-making winning streak and caused the
Cardinal failed to become the only team in
Pac-10 history to go 18-0 during the regular
season.
Stanford will join Arizona and Oregon
State on the list of Pac-10 teams to complete a
17-1 conference season.
And with that loss, speculation begins.
Suddenly questions about the prospects of
going undefeated have morphed into queries
about almost perfect.
Some argued that going undefeated in the
regular season wasn't the best way to go about
winning a national title — "too much pres
sure," they said. "You learn more from a loss
than a win," they claimed.
"I never bought into that," said disap
pointed senior guard Matt Lottich, shaking
his head.
"It's just that we were one game away
from something pretty special," added
head coach Mike Montgomery before a
throng of reporters outside of a quiet Stan
ford locker room. "It might take a little
while to get over that."
History aside, on Saturday, it was clear
from the get-go that the Huskies were upset
hungry. The local media printed pictures of
Washington players cheering when the Cardi
nal overcame a six-point deficit in the final 26

seconds to beat Washington State, 63-61, in
Pullman on Thursday and the Huskies' ath
letics department passed out signs reading 26-
1 to the student section before the game.
To Washington players, who are fight
ing for an at-large bid into the NCAA
Tournament as a "bubble team," it was im
portant that they face a still-undefeated
Cardinal squad — they wanted to do what
no other team in 26 tries had been able to
do this season.
And, on Saturday, the Huskies did just
that, taking advantage of a Stanford team that
couldn't hit a shot and, at points during the
contest, looked sluggish on the defensive end
and nervous on offense.
"We've had bad shooting games before
but our defense has been able to [overcome
that]," Lottich said.
In truth, Stanford just didn't play very well
last weekend. Although it escaped Washing
ton State on a miracle buzzer-beating 3-point
heave by Lottich, the Cardinal never seemed
to find its offensive rhythm — never quite
looked in sync at any point during the trip.
Between the two games up north, Stanford
went a meager 10-of-38 from behind the 3-
point arc. On Saturday against Washington,
the Cardinal shot a dismal 5-of-24 from long
range and 39.1 percent from the field overall.
"Washington certainly shot the ball better
than we did," Montgomery said. "Washing
ton was ready to play. We just didn't have a
real good weekend.
"We knew this was going to be a tough
road trip," he continued. "We didn't play well
enough to win [and] Washington did. That's
the bottom line."
Moreover, against Washington, Stanford
turned the ball over 13 times in the opening
half, which accounted for 12 of the Huskies'
35 first-half points.
"We just weren't handling the ball very
well," Montgomery said.
But even after all that, the Cardinal still
managed to fight its way back from a 10-point
halftime deficit to find itself within one point
of Washington on three occasions during the
second half. However, Stanford was never

The then-No. 1 Stanford men's basketball team was upset last Saturday by Washington and saw hopes of a perfect season dashed.
able to take the lead.
With 15:06 remaining on the clock, junior swingman
Josh Childress found junior center Rob Little in the post
for the easy layin — a bucket that culminated a 9-0 Stan
ford run to start the second half and brought the score to
35-34 in favor of the Huskies. Almost four minutes later,
the Cardinal cut the deficit to one, once again, when sopho
more point guard Chris Hernandez drove down the gut to
score an easy layup.
On the Huskies' next offensive possession, though,
Washington guard Tre Simmons nailed a long 3-pointer to
put Washington up by four. And almost two minutes later,
after a series of fouls and turnovers, Simmons hit another
big trey, exploiting Stanford's zone defense. He led all
Washington scorers with 16 points off 6-of-10 shooting from
the field and 4-of-5 shooting from behind the arc.
Hernandez led all Stanford scorers with 21 points.
Stanford pulled within four points with five minutes re
maining when Hernandez hit both free throws in a bonus
situation, but then Brandon Roy completed a 3-point play
on the opposite end, Lottich missed a three and Washington
forward Mike Jenson nailed a trey, extending the Husky
lead to nine, 60-51.
The Cardinal never challenged after that stretch and a
few minutes later, with the game wrapped up, Washington
players began signaling for The Dawg Pack (Washington's
equivalent of the Sixth Man Club) to rush the floor.
When it was all said and done, however, the difference
was at the free throw line. While the Cougars shot a re
spectable 24-of-30, Stanford only went 3-of-3 from the line,
and that was the ball game.
That's right, three free throws all game.
Seventeen of Washington's 30 attempts came during the
final two minutes of the game, when the Cardinal began
fouling to stop the clock.

"We shoot three foul shots, that means we're not being
aggressive," Montgomery said.
And just like that —just like that — it was over.
The streak, the No. 1 ranking, the comparisons to St. Joe
sph's and all that hoopla surrounding Stanford's potentially
history-making regular season.
How will Stanford respond to a loss that meant noth
ing to its present reality — tournament seeding and abil
ity to return to the Final Four — but possibly everything
in the future?

Will the loss to Washington simply be an asterisk? Some
random trivia question in the future asking which team
ended the streak, which squad actually heat that Stanford
team back in 2004?
Or is it a sign that the Cardinal's "luck" — if there is such
a thing — has finally run out?
Stay tuned: Up next, Washington State ... again. The
two teams face off tomorrow at 12:20 p.m. at Los Ange
les' Staples Center in a game that will be televised on Fox
Sports Net.
