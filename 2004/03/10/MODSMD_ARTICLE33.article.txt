# Men fall one short of perfection, upset by UW

### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. — And just like that, it
was over.
Finally? ... Over.
The steak, the dream of an undefeated sea
son, the No. 1 ranking and the endless com
parisons with undefeated St. Joseph's — all
the talk about history and all the hoopla
ended Saturday afternoon in front of a na
tional television audience and a record crowd
of 10,086 at Bank of America Arena in Seat
tle, where the Stanford men's basketball team
(26-1,17-1 Pacific-10 Conference) lost its first
game this season, 75-62, to Washington (17-
10,12-6).
The loss — the Cardinal's first since
March 22,2003, when the Cardinal fell 85-74
in the second round of the NCAA Tourna
ment to Connecticut — ended Stanford's his
tory-making winning streak and caused the
Cardinal failed to become the only team in
Pac-10 history to go 18-0 during the regular
season.
Stanford will join Arizona and Oregon
State on the list of Pac-10 teams to complete a
17-1 conference season.
And with that loss, speculation begins.
Suddenly questions about the prospects of
going undefeated have morphed into queries
about almost perfect.
Some argued that going undefeated in the
regular season wasn't the best way to go about
winning a national title — "too much pres
sure," they said. "You learn more from a loss
than a win," they claimed.
"I never bought into that," said disap
pointed senior guard Matt Lottich, shaking
his head.
"It's just that we were one game away
from something pretty special," added
head coach Mike Montgomery before a
throng of reporters outside of a quiet Stan
ford locker room. "It might take a little
while to get over that."
History aside, on Saturday, it was clear
from the get-go that the Huskies were upset
hungry. The local media printed pictures of
Washington players cheering when the Cardi
nal overcame a six-point deficit in the final 26

seconds to beat Washington State, 63-61, in
Pullman on Thursday and the Huskies' ath
letics department passed out signs reading 26-
1 to the student section before the game.
To Washington players, who are fight
ing for an at-large bid into the NCAA
Tournament as a "bubble team," it was im
portant that they face a still-undefeated
Cardinal squad — they wanted to do what
no other team in 26 tries had been able to
do this season.
And, on Saturday, the Huskies did just
that, taking advantage of a Stanford team that
couldn't hit a shot and, at points during the
contest, looked sluggish on the defensive end
and nervous on offense.
"We've had bad shooting games before
but our defense has been able to [overcome
that]," Lottich said.
In truth, Stanford just didn't play very well
last weekend. Although it escaped Washing
ton State on a miracle buzzer-beating 3-point
heave by Lottich, the Cardinal never seemed
to find its offensive rhythm — never quite
looked in sync at any point during the trip.
Between the two games up north, Stanford
went a meager 10-of-38 from behind the 3-
point arc. On Saturday against Washington,
the Cardinal shot a dismal 5-of-24 from long
range and 39.1 percent from the field overall.
"Washington certainly shot the ball better
than we did," Montgomery said. "Washing
ton was ready to play. We just didn't have a
real good weekend.
"We knew this was going to be a tough
road trip," he continued. "We didn't play well
enough to win [and] Washington did. That's
the bottom line."
Moreover, against Washington, Stanford
turned the ball over 13 times in the opening
half, which accounted for 12 of the Huskies'
35 first-half points.
"We just weren't handling the ball very
well," Montgomery said.
But even after all that, the Cardinal still
managed to fight its way back from a 10-point
halftime deficit to find itself within one point
of Washington on three occasions during the
second half. However, Stanford was never
