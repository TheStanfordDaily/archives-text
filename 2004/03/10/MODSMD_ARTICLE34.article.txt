# Julie protests the return of "the Chief"
## 
### 
The idiots at The Stanford Review
are at it again. In their bizarre Feb.
19 issue, they feature their Beavis
and Butthead-esque "Chief" carica
ture in the Smoke Signals section. He's back
from the dead (circa 1995), and it's pissing
people off.
The Stanford Athletics department
dropped the school's Indian mascot. Prince
Lightfoot, back in 1972, sparked by a petition
by Native American students. And while
Stanford made the switch before a lot of uni
versities and public high schools, which are
catching on in increasing numbers, you can
still find throwback alumni hobbling around at
football games donning Indian mascot shirts,
buttons and other feathered paraphernalia.
A group of Stanford students at the Native
American Cultural Center is circulating its
own petition to get the Review to stop using
the caricature, but did you really expect any

better from the same Review
that rotates through
marginalizing ethnic groups
and also said "The best thing
that most Stanford girls will
ever have a chance to do for
the environment is have a
baby"? ("Abortion 101:
True Pro-Choice," Oct. 15).
Assholes.
So I'm going to walk us

through a very basic "Why the Chief is offen
sive" tutorial. I'm no expert on the subject, hut
rather proof that you don't need to be Native
American or live in Columbae to "get it."
Clue no. 1: If someone says you're offend
ing them, then guess what, you're being of
fensive. Offending, offensive: verb, adjec
tive. This is why it's not a good idea to call
someone a nigger, unless you want to offend
that person. Same goes for redskin in a lot of
people's books.
Alright, if Tom Cruise gets offended every
time the tabloids say he's gay, who cares. Law
suit winnings will never bring Nicole back. If
an entire ethnic population is banding togeth
er to say Indian mascots offend them, maybe
it's time to stop being assholes and listen.
We're talking about an ethnic population that
is targeted for violent crimes more than twice
as often as U.S. residents in general and has
higher suicide rates and a shorter life ex
pectancy than any other ethnic group in the
U.S. Since most people know absolutely noth
ing about Native Americans —or indeed,
what the correct term to even use is — maybe
it's more understandable that a lot of people
don't listen to or care what they have to say on
the mascot issue. Understandable, maybe, but
certainly not acceptable.
But Julie, my roommate's friend is 1 / 32nd
Cherokee, and he says he's not offended by In
dian sports mascots. First of all, buddy, your
roommate's friend is not considered Ameri
can Indian, at least by the U.S. government,
which imposed bogus blood quantum laws to
wipe out the population anyway. You know,
after enough generations, no one will even be
"1 /Bth Indian," so the American people can
finally put this pesky panoply of indigenous
groups in the systematic genocidal past.
Second of all. Prince Lightfoot was full
blooded Yurok Indian, but he isn't the
spokesperson for the entire ethnicity, either.
Okay, Julie, I may not be personally of
fended by a cartoon Indian, but if other people
are, fine. What about mascots that are honor
able representations of Indians, like stoic war
riors and tribal chieftains? Why can't Indians
just accept the compliment?
Sadly, my hometown Arcadia High
School thought the good move would be to
replace their cartoon Indian with a stoic
guy with lots of feathers. Hey, Stanford al
most did. Great move, Arcadia. But hey,
it's also a city that doesn't care when people
play "let's try to run over momma peacock
and her babies" and approved a tract hous
ing project to bulldoze over the historic
landsite where Arcadia's founder lived.
Either mascot depiction is a (fill in the
blank:) patronizing, insensitive, mocking, de
humanizing, ill-informed stereotype and not
entirely harmless. Stephanie Fryberg's re
search shows that American Indian high
school students shown a picture of either Indi
an mascot (the stoic or the cartoonish) before
taking a psychological assessment showed de
creased self-esteem. Yeah guys, and that's just
looking at a picture once.
Big issue fora small column, so for now,
let's leave it at this: "If Native Americans
find the mascots offensive, maybe they ac
tually have a point!" If you have no better a
clue of why Indian mascots are offensive
and racist, why not take a stab at your own
proactive education? In the words of one
Stanford frat boy's license plate, "SAC
UP": There are classes, a Native American
Cultural Center, and yes, Google searches,
all part of our inflated tuition package at the
Farm. And backwards alumni sports fans
and racist student publications if you can't
see the relevance.
