## Card takes series from Trojans, 2-1 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The unranked Southern Califor
nia baseball squad (4-7) has had a
rough season so far, likely because
of injury problems and a tough
schedule. So when top-ranked Stan
ford (15-3) rolled into Los Angeles
last weekend fora three-game se
ries, most people figured that the
Cardinal would be able to chalk up
three easy wins.
The Trojans proved every
one wrong.
After dropping Friday night's
game, 10-2, USC refused to go qui
etly, losing 8-7 in 13 innings on Sat
urday and capping off the weekend
with an 11-8 win on Sunday.
"As coaches, we knew they
were a strong team," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
knew they were better than their
record and they played that way
against us."
Friday's game looked to be close,
as three innings came and went with
out a single run being scored by ei
ther team. The Cardinal broke the
tie with a four-run fourth frame and
never looked back.
Sophomore lefty Mark Ro
manczuk threw seven innings, giving
up seven hits and not allowing a run.
Marquess called the outing a season
best for his ace.

"One of my goals this year was to
be a more dominating pitcher, be
more of a presence, strike out more
batters," Romanczuk said. "I think,
at USC, I was able to do that."
The Trojans scored both of
their runs in tne eighth inning, off
junior reliever Jonny Dyer. USC
leftfielder Baron Frost and short
stop Blake Sharpe got on base
with back-to-back singles before
scoring on RBI groundouts later
in the frame.
By the ninth inning of Satur
day's contest, it seemed as though
the Cardinal was going to take a
loss — the team was down 7-3 —
and spend Sunday fighting for the
series win.
Enter senior Brian Hall, who
kicked off a rally with a single and a
stolen base. After junior Chris
Carter singled to score Hall, senior
Jonny Ash hit a key two-run home
run to bring the Cardinal within one.
Sophomore John Mayberry Jr. plat
ed the tying run a few batters later to
send Stanford into its first extra-in
ning contest of the season.
Four and a half hours after the
first pitch of the game, Putnam
smacked a two-out RBI single to
give Stanford a 13-inning, 8-7 win.
"It was really the most exciting
game of the season," Mayberry Jr.
