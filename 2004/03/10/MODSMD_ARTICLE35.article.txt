## Card takes series from Trojans, 2-1 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The unranked Southern Califor
nia baseball squad (4-7) has had a
rough season so far, likely because
of injury problems and a tough
schedule. So when top-ranked Stan
ford (15-3) rolled into Los Angeles
last weekend fora three-game se
ries, most people figured that the
Cardinal would be able to chalk up
three easy wins.
The Trojans proved every
one wrong.
After dropping Friday night's
game, 10-2, USC refused to go qui
etly, losing 8-7 in 13 innings on Sat
urday and capping off the weekend
with an 11-8 win on Sunday.
"As coaches, we knew they
were a strong team," said Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess. "We
knew they were better than their
record and they played that way
against us."
Friday's game looked to be close,
as three innings came and went with
out a single run being scored by ei
ther team. The Cardinal broke the
tie with a four-run fourth frame and
never looked back.
Sophomore lefty Mark Ro
manczuk threw seven innings, giving
up seven hits and not allowing a run.
Marquess called the outing a season
best for his ace.

"One of my goals this year was to
be a more dominating pitcher, be
more of a presence, strike out more
batters," Romanczuk said. "I think,
at USC, I was able to do that."
The Trojans scored both of
their runs in tne eighth inning, off
junior reliever Jonny Dyer. USC
leftfielder Baron Frost and short
stop Blake Sharpe got on base
with back-to-back singles before
scoring on RBI groundouts later
in the frame.
By the ninth inning of Satur
day's contest, it seemed as though
the Cardinal was going to take a
loss — the team was down 7-3 —
and spend Sunday fighting for the
series win.
Enter senior Brian Hall, who
kicked off a rally with a single and a
stolen base. After junior Chris
Carter singled to score Hall, senior
Jonny Ash hit a key two-run home
run to bring the Cardinal within one.
Sophomore John Mayberry Jr. plat
ed the tying run a few batters later to
send Stanford into its first extra-in
ning contest of the season.
Four and a half hours after the
first pitch of the game, Putnam
smacked a two-out RBI single to
give Stanford a 13-inning, 8-7 win.
"It was really the most exciting
game of the season," Mayberry Jr.

Freshman starter Blake Holler struggled early in the Cardinal's loss to USC on Sunday. Stanford won the se

said. "It was a true test of a team's
will to win."
Saturday starter Jeff Gilmore, a
sophomore righthander, had a
rough outing, as he allowed all
seven USC runs. However, all
three of the Cardinal's relievers —
sophomore Matt Manship, senior
David O'Hagan and freshman Jeff
Stimpson — threw a combined
nine scoreless innings to keep
Stanford in the game.
"We have a lot of depth and that
helps us," Romanczuk said of the
Cardinal pitching staff. "If a guy's
having an off day, our ninth, 10th
and 11th guys can come in and pitch
well for us."
Sunday's ninth inning looked
strikingly familiar, as Stanford
found itself facing an 11-7 deficit.
Only this time, the squad couldn't
pull off a comeback.
"We have an attitude in every
game to never give up," Mayberry
Jr. said. "And the beautiful thing
about baseball is that there's no time
limit, so we can just try and do what
we need to do. It just didn't come our
way this time."
Stanford was forced to go through
five pitchers in the game, as freshman

starter Blake Holler had his worst
outing this season, giving up seven
runs on seven hits in his 22/3 innings.
Dyer, senior Drew Ehrlich, junior
Mark Jecman and sophomore Kodi
ak Quiek all came out of the bullpen,
but Quick was the only one that did
not give up at least one run.
The Trojans were productive
throughout their lineup, as all nine
of their starters scored at least once.
Catcher Jeff Clement — who re
turned to the USC lineup after an in
jury kept him out of a few games —
and Sharpe lead the Trojans with
three hits apiece.
Stanford senior Sam Fuld, Hall
and Mayberry Jr. all had three-hit
days for the Cardinal —which
outhit USC 15-13 — but the effort
was not enough to prevent the
Trojan victory.
The Cardinal will not play again
until it visits St. Mary's on March
23 and Santa Clara on March 24.
Stanford then returns home fora
three-game series against Cal Poly
March 26-28.
In the meantime, the Cardinal
will be using the 16-day break to
its advantage.
"Some people might look at that
break and say we have a chance to
regroup," Romanczuk said. "But
[MarquessJ looks at it differently
and says we have a chance to work
hard and get better."
