# Men upset UC-Irvine, nearly top UCLA
## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 12 Stanford men's volleyball
team is back.
Notching its first road win to upset
No. 9 UC-Irvine (7-12, 3-9 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) on Friday and
nearly upsetting top-ranked UCLA (16-
3, 10-3) on Saturday, the Cardinal (7-12,
4-10) performed like it had when it first
met these two teams at home in January,
when it put on a show head Coach Don
Shaw then said was "about as well as we
played all year long."
Maybe the good experience last time,
in which the Cardinal defeated the
Anteaters and the Bruins back-to-back
in Burnham Pavilion, charged the Cardi
nal fora repeat of the consecutive wins.
Or maybe Stanford's confidence was
buoyed by the strong 3-0 wins over Cali
fornia and LaVerne last week, perfor
mances that turned a season-high seven
game skid into a winning streak.
That streak only continued Friday
night, when Stanford junior Kevin
Hansen set to give five hitters double
digit kills in a 3-1 win over the Anteaters.
According to Hansen, who had a stun
ning 53 assists for the night, it all starts
with good defense.

"I think we handled [Irvine] much
better this time with respect to our serv
ing and passing," he said. "When we
pass well, I am able to establish a quick
offense that is difficult to stop."
Difficult, but not impossible. In game
one, even after sophomore outside hit
ter William Clayton recorded a kill to
open up a 23-18 lead, the Anteaters
surged to tie the score at 28. A game that
included 15 ties was only put away when
Clayton knocked down two more kills,
en route to 12 for the night, to end the
contest at 32-30.
Clayton wasn't the only one hitting
well that night. Junior outside hitter
David Vogel also had 12 kills while ju
nior Pat Bomhack recorded 15. Thanks
to Hansen, a variety of players were get
ting the chance to swing away.
"I always try to distribute the sets in a
way that the other team won't catch on to
our offense," Hansen said. "By setting
everyone, the blockers can't anticipate
where the set is going and our offense
will become unpredictable and hard to
defend."
The Anteaters seemed to catch on in
game two, when another Stanford lead,
this time 10-3, was overcome by Anteater
senior outside hitter and All-American
Jimmy Pelzel, who notched a kill to tie it

up at 29. Irvine would go on to win, 32-30.
Games three and four continued in
the same pattern, as Stanford took an
early advantage that continued to be
threatened by the play of Pelzel, who
had a match-high 25 kills to go along
with 10 digs and four block assists. But
Stanford always kept up, winning
games three and four by identical
scores of 30-27.
"It felt so good to get a win on the
road," said junior middle blocker Craig
Buell, who led Stanford on Friday with
16 kills. "It was a team we needed to beat
in order to have a shot at getting into the
playoffs."
UCLA's playoff berth is a sure thing,
and upsetting the Bruins on Saturday
would have made the Cardinal's position
much more secure. Even so, Cardinal
players were pleased with their perfor
mance in always-competitive Pauley
Pavilion, where the Stanford underdog
nearly took down the top team in the
country. Even the improvement from the
night before was remarkable.
"We played even better against
UCLA than we did against [Irvine],"
Buell said.
After dropping game one, 30-28, Stan
ford swung fora .317 hitting percentage
to win game two, 30-28. In game three, 10

Bruin hitting errors and a stellar Stan
ford defense would ensure the most
definitive win of the match for the Cardi
nal. 30-22, as UCLA hit only .111.
"Our defense, specifically blocking,
was the best I have ever seen it against
UCLA," Hansen said. "We focused on
not just blocking balls down but touching
balls and slowing them down, enabling
our diggers to pass it to the net and con
vert in transition."
Stanford had 19.5 blocks to UCLA's
11.
But the Bruins picked up their hitting
to win game four, 30-24, and the teams
went on to face off in a definitive game
five. The squads exchanged points in a
match that was to last a grueling two
hours and 19 minutes, and the Cardinal
dropped two opportunities for match
point to give the Bruins the 17-15 victory.
In the end, the win came down to a few
points here and there.
"I think if we just eliminated a few
streaks of points, specifically in the first
game of UCLA, that would have made
the difference," Hansen said.
Stanford will have two weeks to con
centrate on further improvement. The
Cardinal won't play again until March
26-27, when it hosts UC-San Diego and
Long Beach State, respectively.

Notching its first road win to upset
No. 9 UC-Irvine (7-12, 3-9 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) on Friday and
nearly upsetting top-ranked UCLA (16-
3, 10-3) on Saturday, the Cardinal (7-12,
4-10) performed like it had when it first
met these two teams at home in January,
when it put on a show head Coach Don
Shaw then said was "about as well as we
played all year long."
Maybe the good experience last time,
in which the Cardinal defeated the
Anteaters and the Bruins back-to-back
in Burnham Pavilion, charged the Cardi
nal fora repeat of the consecutive wins.
Or maybe Stanford's confidence was
buoyed by the strong 3-0 wins over Cali
fornia and LaVerne last week, perfor
mances that turned a season-high seven
game skid into a winning streak.
That streak only continued Friday
night, when Stanford junior Kevin
Hansen set to give five hitters double
digit kills in a 3-1 win over the Anteaters.
According to Hansen, who had a stun
ning 53 assists for the night, it all starts
with good defense.

"I think we handled [Irvine] much
better this time with respect to our serv
ing and passing," he said. "When we
pass well, I am able to establish a quick
offense that is difficult to stop."
Difficult, but not impossible. In game
one, even after sophomore outside hit
ter William Clayton recorded a kill to
open up a 23-18 lead, the Anteaters
surged to tie the score at 28. A game that
included 15 ties was only put away when
Clayton knocked down two more kills,
en route to 12 for the night, to end the
contest at 32-30.
Clayton wasn't the only one hitting
well that night. Junior outside hitter
David Vogel also had 12 kills while ju
nior Pat Bomhack recorded 15. Thanks
to Hansen, a variety of players were get
ting the chance to swing away.
"I always try to distribute the sets in a
way that the other team won't catch on to
our offense," Hansen said. "By setting
everyone, the blockers can't anticipate
where the set is going and our offense
will become unpredictable and hard to
defend."
The Anteaters seemed to catch on in
game two, when another Stanford lead,
this time 10-3, was overcome by Anteater
senior outside hitter and All-American
Jimmy Pelzel, who notched a kill to tie it

up at 29. Irvine would go on to win, 32-30.
Games three and four continued in
the same pattern, as Stanford took an
early advantage that continued to be
threatened by the play of Pelzel, who
had a match-high 25 kills to go along
with 10 digs and four block assists. But
Stanford always kept up, winning
games three and four by identical
scores of 30-27.
"It felt so good to get a win on the
road," said junior middle blocker Craig
Buell, who led Stanford on Friday with
16 kills. "It was a team we needed to beat
in order to have a shot at getting into the
playoffs."
UCLA's playoff berth is a sure thing,
and upsetting the Bruins on Saturday
would have made the Cardinal's position
much more secure. Even so, Cardinal
players were pleased with their perfor
mance in always-competitive Pauley
Pavilion, where the Stanford underdog
nearly took down the top team in the
country. Even the improvement from the
night before was remarkable.
"We played even better against
UCLA than we did against [Irvine],"
Buell said.
After dropping game one, 30-28, Stan
ford swung fora .317 hitting percentage
to win game two, 30-28. In game three, 10

Bruin hitting errors and a stellar Stan
ford defense would ensure the most
definitive win of the match for the Cardi
nal. 30-22, as UCLA hit only .111.
"Our defense, specifically blocking,
was the best I have ever seen it against
UCLA," Hansen said. "We focused on
not just blocking balls down but touching
balls and slowing them down, enabling
our diggers to pass it to the net and con
vert in transition."
Stanford had 19.5 blocks to UCLA's
11.
But the Bruins picked up their hitting
to win game four, 30-24, and the teams
went on to face off in a definitive game
five. The squads exchanged points in a
match that was to last a grueling two
hours and 19 minutes, and the Cardinal
dropped two opportunities for match
point to give the Bruins the 17-15 victory.
In the end, the win came down to a few
points here and there.
"I think if we just eliminated a few
streaks of points, specifically in the first
game of UCLA, that would have made
the difference," Hansen said.
Stanford will have two weeks to con
centrate on further improvement. The
Cardinal won't play again until March
26-27, when it hosts UC-San Diego and
Long Beach State, respectively.
