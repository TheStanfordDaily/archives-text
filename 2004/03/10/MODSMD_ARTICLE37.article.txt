### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
They've got three in a row, but can they connect four?
Stanford's No. 3 women's gymnastics team (8-3,4-2 Pacific-10
C onference) closed the regular season with its third straight win
last Saturday, defeating Maryland. The team hopes to continue
the winning streak through the Pac-10 Championships in Arizona
on March 20.
The Cardinal's biggest challenge at Pac-lOs will likely come
from top-ranked UCLA. Stanford lost to UCLA by over a point
earlier this season, but the two teams have been neck-and-neck
near the end ol the regular season — Stanford's average team
score over the past three meets is 198.17, besting UCLA's 198.1
average over the same period. The Cardinal and the Bruins are
also tied tor the highest home score in the nation this season
(198.875).
Stanlord's 197.775 to 197.375 victory on Saturday moved the
team from No. 5 to No. 3 in the national rankings, leaving the Car
dinal behind only UCLA and Georgia. This is the Cardinal's high
est rank this season, and it is mostly due to the team's three week
winning streak.
Senior co-captain Caroline Fluhrer led Stanford in the all
around on Saturday night, placing first with a 39.6. Fellow se
nior co-captain Lindsay Wing took third in the all-around with
a 39.425.
Vault was Stanford's highest-scoring event of the meet.
Sophomore Jessica Louie led the charge down the runway with a
career-high of 9.975 and took first place. Fluhrer and seniors Lise
Leveille and Shelly Goldberg swept up by placing second, third
and fourth.
Senior Kendall Beck led the Cardinal on beam, tying her
career high of 9.925 and winning the event for the first time
this season.
Stanford's No. 10 men's gymnastics team (3-5, 2-3) lost to No.

4 Penn State at home this past Saturday, but the Cardinal tied its
highest team score this season (214.575) and had some exception
al performances on the high bar.
Junior Ambert Yeung posted an 8.8 on high bar and sopho
more Nate Downs swung to a career-high of 9.6. Junior Kelly
Lang scored an 8.25 but debuted a release move that no one else
in the NCAA is currently competing. Every skill in gymnastics
has a difficulty rating ranging from A (the easiest) to E (the most
difficult). Lang's release was not only an E, it was a super E.
Senior captain Dan Gill finished his last dual meet at home
with a near perfect high-bar routine that showcased some of the
most difficult skills in the country. He hit the triple-twisting, dou
ble-layout dismount and the kovacks (a move where you do a full
twisting double back flip over the bar and then catch the bar
again), which he missed last weekend.
The crowd, led by Gill's Kappa Alpha fraternity brothers —
who were sporting Gill's old leotards — chanted fora 10.0, but
the judges gave the routine a 9.825 — which was still a career high
for Gill and enough to win the event.
"I really wanted to hit that routine after last week," Gill said.
"It was a good way to finish my last dual meet at Stanford."
Former longtime head coach of the men's team, Sadao Hama
da, who had recruited and coached Gill as a freshman and sopho
more, was proud to watch Gill's last dual meet at home.
"When he was a freshman, he was my uncut diamond," Hama
da said. "There are still a few areas to chisel off, but he's almost
done and ready for the Olympic year."
Saturday's meet put Stanford's team in a secure position to
qualify for NCAA Nationals on April 1. The top 12 teams qualify
to Nationals based on their four best scores during the regular
season as well as their score at the regional meet.
The Cardinal will host the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration Regional Championships on March 19-20 against
No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 3 California, No. 8 Nebraska and No.
16 Air Force.

men's squad will host the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Regionals. Both teams are coming off of solid performances
