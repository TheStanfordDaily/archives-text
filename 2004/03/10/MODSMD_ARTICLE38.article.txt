# Men swim to 23rd consecutive Pac-10 crown, Rogan nabs two individual titles
## 
### BEN WILDMAN-TOBRINER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Twenty-three years ago, most Stanford
undergraduates were not yet bom. Twenty
three years ago, Ronald Regan was just
stepping into office. Twenty-three years
ago, the Stanford men's swim team won a
Pacific-10 Conference title. Why do we care
about what happened 23 years ago?
Because the Cardinal has won every
Pac-10 title since.
Last week at the Belmont Plaza
Olympic Pool in Long Beach, Calif., the
No. 2 Cardinal took title number 23, con
tinuing a streak of excellence that has last
ed for over two decades.
It was no surprise that Stanford's main
competitor at the Championships was tal
ented No. 4 California. But when all was
said and done, Stanford's 866.5 points out
classed Cal's 773.
The meet was close at times, but the Car
dinal was never seriously challenged. Al
though Cal swam extremely fast, Stanford's
incredible depth eventually overpowered
the Bears in the long and grueling meet.
Stanford's lineup was so deep that all 19 of
the officially entered Cardinal swimmers
scored in every event they raced, a feat
rarely accomplished.
The fact that Cal brought a good team to
the meet only amplified the already expect
ed atmosphere — everyone wanted to see
Stanford lose. When a team wins for so
long, every other squad wants to bring that
team down. But with number 23 on the line,
the Stanford men overcame the pressure
and defended their title.
Competition started with a night session
featuring the 200-yard medley relay and the
800-yard freestyle relay. With an intense at
mosphere filling the complex, the Cardinal
won the 800 but got second in the 200 to the
Golden Bears. With Cal's third-place finish
in the 800, the Cardinal took a slight lead
into the first full day of competition.
Thursday proved to be a bit tougher
than expected for the Cardinal. Cal super
star Duje Draganja won the 50-yard

freestyle in a blistering 19.17 seconds, while
Southern California star Ous Mellouli
barely touched out Stanford junior Jayme
Cramer in the 500-yard freestyle. However,
senior Markus Rogan's victory in the 200-
yard individual medley capped an event
featuring four Cardinal swimmers in the
top eight. By the end of the day, Stanford
had a solid 27-point lead.
On day two, however, the Cardinal re
ally started to get in gear. One of the most
important events of the day for the Cardi
nal was the 200-yard freestyle. After a
good preliminary session, the team
placed five swimmers in the top eight.
That night in finals, Cramer placed sec
ond in the event, followed by sophomore
Tobias Oriwol in third.
In addition to amassing a large load of
points in the 200 free, the 100-yard back
stroke proved to be another good event
for the Cardinal. Stanford senior Peter
Marshall won the event in 45.21, setting
a new Pac-10 record and establishing
himself as the second-fastest American
in the event's history. The team in
creased its lead to over 50 points with
only one day to go.
On the final day of the meet, the Cardi
nal's lead only continued to grow. Rogan
won his second title of the meet in the 200-
yard backstroke, while Cramer won his first
in the 200-yard butterfly. Freshman Shaun
Phillips placed second in the 1650-yard free
while sophomore Mike McLean took
fourth. By the time the last relay finished
up, the Cardinal had pulled ahead by over
90 points.
This year's Pac-10 victory was neither
the biggest blowout nor the closest call for
the Cardinal. It was, however, the perfect
tune-up for the NCAA Championships at
the end of March. With number 23 under
their belt, the swimmers now turn their full
attention to Long Island, N.Y., and the
Championships, to be held Mar. 25-27.

Olympic Pool in Long Beach, Calif., the
No. 2 Cardinal took title number 23, con
tinuing a streak of excellence that has last
ed for over two decades.
It was no surprise that Stanford's main
competitor at the Championships was tal
ented No. 4 California. But when all was
said and done, Stanford's 866.5 points out
classed Cal's 773.
The meet was close at times, but the Car
dinal was never seriously challenged. Al
though Cal swam extremely fast, Stanford's
incredible depth eventually overpowered
the Bears in the long and grueling meet.
Stanford's lineup was so deep that all 19 of
the officially entered Cardinal swimmers
scored in every event they raced, a feat
rarely accomplished.
The fact that Cal brought a good team to
the meet only amplified the already expect
ed atmosphere — everyone wanted to see
Stanford lose. When a team wins for so
long, every other squad wants to bring that
team down. But with number 23 on the line,
the Stanford men overcame the pressure
and defended their title.
Competition started with a night session
featuring the 200-yard medley relay and the
800-yard freestyle relay. With an intense at
mosphere filling the complex, the Cardinal
won the 800 but got second in the 200 to the
Golden Bears. With Cal's third-place finish
in the 800, the Cardinal took a slight lead
into the first full day of competition.
Thursday proved to be a bit tougher
than expected for the Cardinal. Cal super
star Duje Draganja won the 50-yard

freestyle in a blistering 19.17 seconds, while
Southern California star Ous Mellouli
barely touched out Stanford junior Jayme
Cramer in the 500-yard freestyle. However,
senior Markus Rogan's victory in the 200-
yard individual medley capped an event
featuring four Cardinal swimmers in the
top eight. By the end of the day, Stanford
had a solid 27-point lead.
On day two, however, the Cardinal re
ally started to get in gear. One of the most
important events of the day for the Cardi
nal was the 200-yard freestyle. After a
good preliminary session, the team
placed five swimmers in the top eight.
That night in finals, Cramer placed sec
ond in the event, followed by sophomore
Tobias Oriwol in third.
In addition to amassing a large load of
points in the 200 free, the 100-yard back
stroke proved to be another good event
for the Cardinal. Stanford senior Peter
Marshall won the event in 45.21, setting
a new Pac-10 record and establishing
himself as the second-fastest American
in the event's history. The team in
creased its lead to over 50 points with
only one day to go.
On the final day of the meet, the Cardi
nal's lead only continued to grow. Rogan
won his second title of the meet in the 200-
yard backstroke, while Cramer won his first
in the 200-yard butterfly. Freshman Shaun
Phillips placed second in the 1650-yard free
while sophomore Mike McLean took
fourth. By the time the last relay finished
up, the Cardinal had pulled ahead by over
90 points.
This year's Pac-10 victory was neither
the biggest blowout nor the closest call for
the Cardinal. It was, however, the perfect
tune-up for the NCAA Championships at
the end of March. With number 23 under
their belt, the swimmers now turn their full
attention to Long Island, N.Y., and the
Championships, to be held Mar. 25-27.
