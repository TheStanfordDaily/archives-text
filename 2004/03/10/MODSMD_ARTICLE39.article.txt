# Softball posts perfect 5-0 record at Worth Invitational

### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a difficult tournament in Tuc
son, Ariz., a week ago, the No. 10 Stan
ford softball team (18-5) regrouped and
posted a perfect 5-0 record at last week
end's round-robin Worth Invitational in
Fullerton, Calif.
None of the Cardinal's five opponents
in Fullerton were nationally ranked, but
winning five games in three days is diffi
cult no matter the competition. The Car
dinal is riding high heading into an off
week before the Stanford Round Robin
on March 20-21.
The Cardinal started off slowly on Fri
day morning in Fullerton against an Ok
lahoma State team it had destroyed a
week earlier in a 10-0 victory. There was
no easy victory this time around as the
game was close until the very end. The
Cowgirls (13-11) took a 6-3 lead into the
bottom of the sixth inning before Stan
ford posted a four-run rally capped by ju
nior outfielder Meghan Sickler's go
ahead s'.ngle to right field to give the Car
dinal a 7-6 lead. Stanford senior ace Dana
Sorensen came in to close out the final in
ning to pick up her second save of the sea
son. Sophomore Laura Severson got the
win despite giving up eight walks in five
innings.
Stanford faced Cal State-Northridge
(11-5) in Friday's nightcap with Sorensen
in the circle again, this time as the Cardi
nal starter. Despite allowing three runs,
two earned, on eight hits, Sorensen
earned a complete game victory and
struck out 11 Northridge batters in a 7-3

Cardinal win.
The story of the game, however, was
Stanford freshman outfielder Jackie
Rinehart, who went five-for-five from the
leadoff spot, one hit shy of the team
record for hits in a single game.
With Rinehart setting the table every
time she stepped to the plate, the rest of
the Cardinal lineup took advantage, as
five different Stanford batters recorded
RBIs.
While the Cardinal pitchers were pro
ficient on Friday, earning victories thanks
largely to their prodigious run support,
Saturday morning's game against Port
land State began a three-game stint of ab
solute pitching dominance by Severson
and Sorensen. The duo combined to pitch
three straight complete-game shutouts on
Saturday and Sunday, starting with Sev
erson's 4-0 victory over Portland State (6-
9).
Severson allowed only two hits over
seven innings and regained her control,
walking only two batters. After the game,
Severson credited her teammates for her
success.
'Tm really proud of the fight all week
end from everyone ... The entire lineup
contributed, and as a pitcher that (gave]
me a lot more confidence," she said.
Saturday night's matchup against UC-
Santa Barbara (12-16) and Sunday's
game against Cal State-Fullerton (6-12)
were both dominated by Sorensen, who
pitched two complete game shutouts to
pick up her ninth and 10th victories of the
year. Saturday's 4-0 victory over the Gau-

The Stanford softball team rebounded from a rough tournament in Arizona to make a dean sweep of its contests in Fullerton, Calif, last weekend.
chos was keyed by Stanford sopho
more shortstop Lauren Lappin's
three doubles in addition to
Sorensen's control in the circle.
The entire Cardinal lineup got
behind Sorensen in Sunday's 9-0 de
molition of the Titans, with usual
suspects Lappin, Sickler and Rine
hart all delivering multiple hits and
knocking in Cardinal runs.
The feel-good story of the day,
however, was Stanford junior third
baseman Liz Bendig, who came off
the bench to go two-for-two with two
RBIs to break out of a prolonged hit
ting slump.
If the Cardinal continues to sup

plement dominant pitching with co
pious run production like it was able
to do last weekend in Fullerton,
there is no telling how well the team
could do in the coming weeks. The
Cardinal will enjoy a week off before
the Stanford Round Robin March
20-21 at Boyd and Jill Smith Family
Stadium against UC-Santa Barbara
and Illinois-Chicago.
"This weekend was most impor
tant because we got five wins," Sev
erson said. "We have a bit of a
break coming up, so it was impor
tant to end this part of the season
on a high note."
After its undefeated weekend
featuring masterful performances
on both sides of the plate, the Car
dinal has hit that high note and
should be in tune for the next phase
of its season.
