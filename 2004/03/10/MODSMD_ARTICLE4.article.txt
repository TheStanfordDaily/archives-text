# New golf class helps GSB students network

### JORDANA HUBER 
Stanford's Graduate School of Business stu
dents are being offered a new class this year —
and the only math involved is calculating a golf
handicap. For two hours a week, participants in
Stanford's Golf for Business and Life Program
can learn skills that will come in handy outside of
a boardroom, said Business School golf club
member Ron Johnson, who first pitched the idea
for the class.
"Golf gives a person moving into the busi
ness environment another 'tool' to relate to
people," he said. "It allows people to interact in
a non-typical business setting that is usually
lower pressure."
Physical education instructor Jim Miller, who
coordinates the golf classes, said the sport is a

natural fit for business students, who take any
opportunity to network very seriously. Will
Yanagisawa, an All-American golfer and former
teammate of Tiger Woods, teaches three classes
of ten students.
"1 don't want to limit myself," said first year
business student Jaclyn Baumgarten, who plans
to take golf in the spring. "On the golf course is
the place where ideas and deals are developed
and I don't want to be left out of an opportunity
where these ideas get nurtured."
She emphasized that as a woman, it is espe
cially important for her to learn because she
wants to enter the typically male-dominated field
of land development.
A hefty $180,000 donation from Woods
helped jumpstart the program. Open to all Stan
ford students, the classes are very popular,

Miller said. This semester there are 19 sessions
with 14 students each, not to mention an exten
sive waitlist.
While Business School classes are technically
open to all students — including undergraduates
— Miller said that almost all 30 students this quar
ter are from the Business School.
Unlike regular golf courses taught twice a
week during the day for credit. Business School
golf is taught one night per week for two hours
and no academic credit is given. Students must
pay a $175 fee for 18 hours of instruction.
"Its not my first choice for fun," said first-year
business student Adam Hopkins, who is current
ly enrolled in golf classes. "I only quasi-enjoy it
hut it is a good skill to have for business purpos
es and the golf course is a good place to get to
know people."
