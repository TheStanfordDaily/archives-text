### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
After opening its season with three wins, the
No. 17 Stanford women's lacrosse team ran into
some tough competition, dropping three match
es against ranked opponents to fall to .500 on
the year.
The Cardinal didn't go without a fight,
though, taking No. 9 Ohio State to overtime be
fore losing, 10-9, on Feb. 27. Last Saturday, the
women suffered another narrow loss, falling to
No. 11 Vanderbilt, 6-5.
On Feb. 29, Stanford was upset by then-No.

worst loss since Cornell's 20-6 win over Stan
ford on March 2, 2002.
Against Ohio State, junior midfielder Nina
Pantano scored with just eight seconds left in
regulation to send the game into overtime. Get
ting to the extra period was an accomplishment
in itself, as the Buckeyes held an 8-4 halftime
lead.
The Cardinal defense hung tough, allowing
just one second-half score and using an aggres
sive offense to close the gap.
The first overtime period was a defensive
battle, as each team managed just one shot on

goal, but Ohio State Ail-American Regina
Olivier broke through the defense for the win
ning score two minutes into the second over
time.
Stanford senior goalkeeper Christiana
Saikus recorded a career-high 20 saves on the
night — just one shy of the school record.
Pantano, sophomore attacker Sarah Bach
and freshman attacker Michelle DeChant each
had two goals for the Cardinal.
Notre Dame scored eight goals in each half
in a dominating wire-to-wire performance two
days later. The Fighting Irish scored the game's
first six goals before Pantano scored in the 21st
minute.
Abby Owen and Meredith Simon led Notre
Dame with four goals apiece.
Sophomore Megan Burker was the Cardi
nal's only multi-goal scorer, with two scores.
Saikus had an off day, recording just four saves.
Katie Horowitz had just two saves in relief.
Vanderbilt (2-1) led at the half, 4-2, on Sat
urday. Although Burker scored with 55 seconds
left to pull Stanford within striking distance, the
Commodores held on for the narrow win.
Burker's early goal gave Stanford a 1-0 lead.
