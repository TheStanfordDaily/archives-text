# Track prepares for NCAA Championships
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's and women's track squads will
look to successfully cap off a season of victories and
tough breaks at the NCAA Indoor Track Champi
onships in Fayetteville, Ark., this weekend.
Already this season, the women's team saw two
school records set and claimed its second consecutive
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title.
Senior Jillian Camarena tied her own school record
in the shot put at 57 feet, 2.25 inches, which she set at
last year's NCAA Indoor Championships. After finish
ing second last year, her mark again sets her up as one
of the favorites for the NCAA title this weekend. She
will go up against the reigning U.S. National Indoor
shot put champion and the 2(X)3 NCAA Indoor shot put
champion, Laura Gerraughty of North Carolina. Ger
raughty currently owns the collegiate record distance at
62 feet, 9.75 inches.
The women's 1,600-meter relay team of sophomores
Chinny Offor and Nashonme Johnson and freshmen
Keisha Gaines and Ashley Freeman set a school record
en route to victory at the MPSF Championships. Their
time of three minutes, 40.19 seconds bested the old
mark by more than three seconds.
Despite the stellar performance, the squad missed
the qualifying cutoff for the NCAA Championships by

less than a second.
Stanford, as usual, also had a huge amount of success
at the women's distance event. Redshirt sophomore
Alicia Craig's 15:56.58 in the 5,()00 is the No. 2 time in
the NCAA as well as the No. 1 time in the U.S this sea
son. Craig will face tough competition in junior Kim
Smith of Providence whose best is a blazing 15:18.54.
Craig also captured the MPSF title at 3,000 meters.
Redshirt sophomore Sara Bei joins Craig as a quali
fier in the 3,000. The pair has posted times of 9:13.32
and 9:14.72 to earn them the No. 7 and No. 9 rankings in
the NCAA, respectively. Smith of Providence again has
the nation's top time in this event at 8:55.08.
Bei is also a member of the Cardinal's NCAA qual
ifying distance medley relay team. The distance medley
relay is comprised of four different length legs â€” 1200,
400,800 and 1600, run in that order.
The team posted an 11:08.67 at the Washington
Qualifier last weekend. Their time is No. 5 in the NCAA
and moves them into a tight race for the title, as the top
five teams are all within five seconds of each other.
There were several other key performers for the
women throughout the season on the sprint, distance
and field teams.
Junior Anita Siraki claimed her first MPSF title, win
ning the 5,000 in 16:58.74. The title capped a strong return
for Siraki, who suffered from injuries last track season.
Freeman also enjoyed a successful campaign,

earning a national ranking in both the 400 and 800
while leading a 1 -2-3 Cardinal sweep of the 400 at the
MPSF Championships.
As outdoor season begins, the women look to con
tinue their success and get their squad healthy after
some key injuries to make a run at their first Pacific-10
Conference title.
The men's squad, led by its stellar distance group,
will be represented in fewer events at the Indoor Cham
pionships than in years past.
Despite their efforts, the Cardinal will fail to send a
distance medley relay team to the Indoor Champi
onships for the first time in seven years. Without the
Cardinal in the mix, Michigan may be in perfect posi
tion to set a new world record, breaking the record
9:28.83 currently held by Stanford's 2000 squad.
The season was not all lost, though, as the Cardinal
completely dominated the national scene in the 3,000
and 5,000. Seven of the top 22 3,000 times in the nation
belong to Cardinal runners, including three of the top
six. Senior Grant Robison leads the group with a 7:51.80
fora No. 3 ranking in the NCAA. He is joined by ju
niors lan Dobson and Don Sage, who are ranked fifth
and sixth, respectively. Robison's time is the second
best in school history.
Dobson also holds the No. 3 time in the 5,000, lead
ing five other Stanford runners among the top 35 in the
NCAA. Dobson's time of 13:49.17 not only ranks him

second in the Stanford record hooks, but also places
him No. 2 in the U.S. this season.
In both events. Stanford runners will be challenged
by the defending 5,000 and 3.000 meter champion, Al
istair Cragg of Arkansas. Cragg currently has NCAA
leading times in both events, including the collegiate
record in the 3,000.
Michigan's Nick Willis, who formerly held the colle
giate record in the 3,000, will also be a strong contender
for the NCAA title at that event.
Stanford also had support from its young and talent
ed middle-distance group this season. Junior Curtis
Goehring, who claimed third in the 400 at the MPSF
Championships, ran a personal best 47.69 seconds at the
event to climb to No. 2 in the Stanford record books. His
time missed the NCAA cut by less than half a second.
Sophomore Solomon Welch also enjoyed a solid in
door season before a slight injury. His best jump of 49
feet, 2.75 inches is No. 2 all-time at Stanford and also
just shy of an NCAA qualifying mark.
Events for the Cardinal begin with the women's
5,000 on Friday night in Fayetteville.
The men are currently ranked No. 7 in the nation
while the women end ranked No. 11. Both squads are
aiming to finish this up-and-down season with top-10
showings before turning their attention to outdoor track
and July's Olympic Trials, which is the focus for many of
Stanford's best runners, jumpers, and throwers.
