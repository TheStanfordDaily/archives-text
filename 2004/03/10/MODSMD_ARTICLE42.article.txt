### NATHANIEL MYALL 
The No. 20 Stanford men's lacrosse team trav
eled south this past weekend for the Warrior In
vitational Tournament at Loyola Marymount
University. There, the Cardinal continued its re
cent slide, losing to No. 12 Simon Fraser Univer
sity on Saturday and No. 25 LMU on Sunday.
The two losses drop the Cardinal (2-4, 2-2
West Coast Lacrosse League North) below .500
for the first time this season and move Stanford
into the middle of the standings in the WCLL
North Conference behind Sonoma State, Cal
Poly and Chico State.
The same problems that contributed to last
weekend's lopsided loss to Cal Poly plagued the
Cardinal again throughout the tournament. The
team started off both games slowly, finding
themselves down by at least five goals at each
half.
The Cardinal was also forced to compete
without several of its key defensemen, all of
whom were sidelined by injuries. Standout
sophomore Brian Goodman, who will be out
four to six weeks with a broken foot, did not play
at all this weekend, while senior co-captain Matt
Twomey was out on Sunday with a sore back.
"On Sunday, with only three long poles
dressed, we were forced to run man-down de
fense with four short sticks and only two long
poles," said sophomore goalie Michael Zell.
"It's an important disadvantage."

The Cardinal's biggest challenge of the week
end came on Saturday against the highly-touted
Simon Fraser Clansmen, who entered the tour
nament with just one loss. Although it eventual
ly lost, 16-13, the Stanford squad rallied from a
six-point halftime deficit to bring the score to 14-
13 by the fourth quarter. The second-half
turnaround was led by sophomore midfielder
Tyler Gutierrez, who connected for four goals
and one assist, and junior attacker Brooks
Kinkaid, who finished the game with a hat trick.
"We played some of the best lacrosse of the
year in the second half," Zell said. "The offense
really came to life."
Unfortunately, the Cardinal offense was not
able to carry its momentum over to its second
match against LMU. Down 10-5 at halftime, the
team had its back against the wall throughout
the second half, eventually losing 13-7.
The Cardinal struggled against a very solid
LMU defense that allowed only 15 shots on goal.
On offense, LMU was led by midfielder Jon
Wiley, who scored six goals and had two assists.
Stanford was led by freshman midfielder Ben
Stillman, who contributed two goals, while se
nior defenseman and co-captain Ben Spohn
added an assist.
The Clansmen won the four-team tourna
ment, surviving a scare from No. 19 Boston Col
lege, which had defeated LMU the day before.
The Cardinal will play its last game before
spring break this Saturday at home against
Southern California at 1 p.m.
