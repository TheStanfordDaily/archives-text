# Sherwood wins 'Heisman trophy of squash' as a senior
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
Four years ago, Richard Sherwood, then a fresh
man, decided to go out for Stanford's club squash
team with his friend Sam Gellman. Both had played
tennis in high school, but neither had played squash
before.
7 wo weeks ago, after finishing 37th at nationals,
Sherwood was given the Skillman award, which Gell
man describes as the Heisman trophy of squash. It is
awarded to the senior who demonstrates great abili
ty and does the most for the sport. It was the first
time a member of a club team had received the
award, and the first time it has been given to a play
er west of Pennsylvania.
It generally goes to a previous National Champi
on, but Sherwood is a special case.
"It's very hard to explain how Rich has shocked
the international squash community," Gellman said.
"His form isn't great, but he just goes out there and
beats everybody. He out-hustles everyone."
His game may not be pretty, but no one can say
that Sherwood doesn't work at it. He was cut from
the team when he went out as a freshman, but the
coach reinstated him after some of the players who
had made the team threatened to quit if Rich was not
allowed to play. He worked hard over the summer
after his freshman year and came back as the team's
top player.
Midway through that year, something clicked for
Sherwood.
"He became the team's most dependable win,"
Gellman says."And that's going up against the other
teams' best players. Then, in our junior year, he just
started beating everybody."
Sherwood finished 39th in the nation that year be
fore his 37th-place finish this season.
Sherwood is not just a devoted athlete; he is also
runs the team

"The reason we can play is because of Rich," Gell
man said.
He single-handedly set up tournaments, arranged
matches and made travel accommodations this sea
son. He also ran a summer squash camp on the Farm
for kids this year, and he even taught a Stanford
squash class.
The team, which was founded only two years be
fore Sherwood's freshman campaign, improved each
year in his four years here, culminating in an 18th
place finish at Nationals this season, a meet in which
only one other club team, Denison, participated.
Denison beat Stanford to win the third division's
title game.
"Playing against teams who had more experience
than we did, who were favored to beat us, motivated
us to get better," Sherwood said. "It's cool that
we've been able to get to such a high level, consider
ing that we are able to practice just four times a
week."
Sherwood's personal ascent in the sport has been
unprecedented, but his impact reaches far beyond
that. He has single-handedly put West Coast squash
on the map (Stanford is one of only two schools on
the West coast that fields a squash team, the other
being California), and in doing so he has taken a
sport that is really an East Coast prep school phe
nomenon — four of the nation's top five teams are in
the Ivy League — and nationalized it.
"It's really hard to put into words what he's done
to people here," Gellman said. "Squash is just so
much bigger on the East Coast than it is out West."
Who knows? When the new recreation center
goes in, it will triple the number of squash courts on
the Stanford campus, and you can bet that Rich Sher
wood had something to do with it. If you notice an
unusually large group of people wearing goggles,
walking around with small tennis rackets and rubber
balls in the next couple of years, you will know whom
to thank.
