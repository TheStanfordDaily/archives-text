### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's tennis team had its
share of wins and losses at the Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Championships at La Jolla, Calif., but one
doubles team managed to bring a championship back
to the Farm.
Sophomore All-American KC Corkery and junior
Sam Warburg battled through four consolation-round
matches to capture the consolation championship.
Corkery and Warburg, seeded third, were forced into
consolation play after losing, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, to the inde
pendent team of Sean Maymi and Paul Settles of Clare
mont, Calif., in the main draw on Friday.
After dropping out of the main draw, Corkery and
Warburg defeated Rice's Tony Haerle and Vuc Raje
vac, 6-3,6-3, in the fourth round on Saturday. They then
moved on to trounce John Nallon and Alex Strom of
Texas A&M, 6-3,6-0, moving the Stanford duo into the
consolation semifinals.
Next in line was the independent team of Neel
Grover and Julien Heine and Corkery and Warburg slid
by with a 6-4,6-4 win to seal their place in the final round.
In the championship match, the Stanford duo routed
Notre Dame's Stephan Bass and Eric Langenkamp, 6-4,
6-2, to claim the consolation championship title.
"I think we're still trying to figure each other out, ac
tually," said Corkery in regards to playing with War
burg. "It's a change for me and him, but I'm really excit
ed that when we finally get on the same page with each
other, we will get even better."
The doubles combinations are fairly new for the
Stanford team, but they have proved to work out well
when it comes down to winning matches on the courts.
"We're making good progress with bearings we have
now," Stanford head coach Dick Gould said. "Who
knows, the doubles teams may turn out to be our great
est strength in the spring matches."
In other match play, Stanford's doubles team of
sophomore James Pade and freshman James Wan
crushed UCSB's Matt Coin and Elad Stern, 6-2,6-0, in
the first round. They then faced Simo Dakki and Matt

Loucks in the second round and overcame the Texas
A&M duo, 6-4,6-3.
On Saturday, however, Pade and Wan were dealt
their first loss of the season in a close 7-5,5-7,6-4 match
in the round of 16 by fourth-seeded Jon Endrikat and
Brian Morton of UC-Irvine.
Two other Stanford teams collected first round wins
but were unable to make it past the second round of the
main draw. Freshmen Eric McKean and Chris Ras
mussen eased by Bruce Aiken and Paul Matysek, 6-1,6-
2, but were handed a 6-1,6-1 loss by the No. 1 team of
Lester Cook and Ante Matijevic of Texas A&M.
Stanford senior team captain Carter Morris and ju
nior Phil Sheng grabbed a 6-3, 6-2 win over Nicholas
Brotman and Nick Edlefsen of UCSB but were then
eliminated, 6-2, 6-1, by Rice's Richard and William
Barker, the second-seeded team. The Barker brothers
went on to win the championship.
The Cardinal returns to the Farm to host Baylor at
Taube Family Tennis Center on March 22. While they
slipped three spots in the rankings this week, the No. 6
Bears come to Stanford with a 10-2 record.
"Baylor is a great team, a very definite threat to win
the NCAA team championship," Gould said. "I don't
like playing them right before finals because our guys
won't have time to practice as much. 1 just hope we can
make a reasonable showing toward them. TTiey are a
very good team."
There are a few ranked players who could potential
ly be worthy adversaries for the Stanford team. One
player to watch out for is Baylor junior Benedikt
Dorsch, who is the top-ranked singles player in the coun
try. Dorsch is ranked at No. 32 in doubles with partner
Ivor Lovrak. Benjamin Becker, ranked No. 6 nationally
in singles, should also be a difficult opponent.
Stanford has never beaten Baylor during Gould's
long tenure, having lost both matches against the Bears,
including a 4-0 defeat last season.
"We have a few guys on the team who hold a grudge
against Baylor," Corkery said. "It wasn't really a match
last year because they beat us pretty bad. We're not try
ing to prove anything, though. We're just going to play it
like any other match."

in singles, should also be a difficult opponent.
Stanford has never beaten Baylor during Gould's
long tenure, having lost both matches against the Bears,
including a 4-0 defeat last season.
"We have a few guys on the team who hold a grudge
against Baylor," Corkery said. "It wasn't really a match
last year because they beat us pretty bad. We're not try
ing to prove anything, though. We're just going to play it
like any other match."
The No. 4 Stanford men's tennis team had its
share of wins and losses at the Pacific Coast Men's
Doubles Championships at La Jolla, Calif., but one
doubles team managed to bring a championship back
to the Farm.
Sophomore All-American KC Corkery and junior
Sam Warburg battled through four consolation-round
matches to capture the consolation championship.
Corkery and Warburg, seeded third, were forced into
consolation play after losing, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, to the inde
pendent team of Sean Maymi and Paul Settles of Clare
mont, Calif., in the main draw on Friday.
After dropping out of the main draw, Corkery and
Warburg defeated Rice's Tony Haerle and Vuc Raje
vac, 6-3,6-3, in the fourth round on Saturday. They then
moved on to trounce John Nallon and Alex Strom of
Texas A&M, 6-3,6-0, moving the Stanford duo into the
consolation semifinals.
Next in line was the independent team of Neel
Grover and Julien Heine and Corkery and Warburg slid
by with a 6-4,6-4 win to seal their place in the final round.
In the championship match, the Stanford duo routed
Notre Dame's Stephan Bass and Eric Langenkamp, 6-4,
6-2, to claim the consolation championship title.
"I think we're still trying to figure each other out, ac
tually," said Corkery in regards to playing with War
burg. "It's a change for me and him, but I'm really excit
ed that when we finally get on the same page with each
other, we will get even better."
The doubles combinations are fairly new for the
Stanford team, but they have proved to work out well
when it comes down to winning matches on the courts.
"We're making good progress with bearings we have
now," Stanford head coach Dick Gould said. "Who
knows, the doubles teams may turn out to be our great
est strength in the spring matches."
In other match play, Stanford's doubles team of
sophomore James Pade and freshman James Wan
crushed UCSB's Matt Coin and Elad Stern, 6-2,6-0, in
the first round. They then faced Simo Dakki and Matt

Loucks in the second round and overcame the Texas
A&M duo, 6-4,6-3.
On Saturday, however, Pade and Wan were dealt
their first loss of the season in a close 7-5,5-7,6-4 match
in the round of 16 by fourth-seeded Jon Endrikat and
Brian Morton of UC-Irvine.
Two other Stanford teams collected first round wins
but were unable to make it past the second round of the
main draw. Freshmen Eric McKean and Chris Ras
mussen eased by Bruce Aiken and Paul Matysek, 6-1,6-
2, but were handed a 6-1,6-1 loss by the No. 1 team of
Lester Cook and Ante Matijevic of Texas A&M.
Stanford senior team captain Carter Morris and ju
nior Phil Sheng grabbed a 6-3, 6-2 win over Nicholas
Brotman and Nick Edlefsen of UCSB but were then
eliminated, 6-2, 6-1, by Rice's Richard and William
Barker, the second-seeded team. The Barker brothers
went on to win the championship.
The Cardinal returns to the Farm to host Baylor at
Taube Family Tennis Center on March 22. While they
slipped three spots in the rankings this week, the No. 6
Bears come to Stanford with a 10-2 record.
"Baylor is a great team, a very definite threat to win
the NCAA team championship," Gould said. "I don't
like playing them right before finals because our guys
won't have time to practice as much. 1 just hope we can
make a reasonable showing toward them. TTiey are a
very good team."
There are a few ranked players who could potential
ly be worthy adversaries for the Stanford team. One
player to watch out for is Baylor junior Benedikt
Dorsch, who is the top-ranked singles player in the coun
try. Dorsch is ranked at No. 32 in doubles with partner
Ivor Lovrak. Benjamin Becker, ranked No. 6 nationally
in singles, should also be a difficult opponent.
Stanford has never beaten Baylor during Gould's
long tenure, having lost both matches against the Bears,
including a 4-0 defeat last season.
"We have a few guys on the team who hold a grudge
