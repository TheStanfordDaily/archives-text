# Police identified a serial groper suspect
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
Police confirmed on Monday that
they identified a serial groper suspect
around Oct. 30, 2003, when the last
groping incident occurred. The suspect
was not arrested.
"Nobody could identify him," said
Sgt. Rick Tipton.

One victim who wished to remain
anonymous confirmed that she was
brought in fora lineup but could not
identify the suspect.
"I am not surprised that the police
were not able to find someone to iden
tify him," she said in an e-mail. "When
I was groped, it was nighttime and the
guy came up behind me on a bike,
grabbed me, and hiked away. He never

really turned around, so I didn't get a
view of his face."
Tipton said, "Until the statute of
limitations runs out, there is still a pos
sibility that additional evidence will
come up. Until additional evidence is
brought forth, there is not enough to
charge the guy with anything."
Tipton told The Daily in late Janu
ary — well after the suspect was identi

fied — that there was speculation that
the suspect was a janitor. An anony
mous source confirmed that the sus
pect was a janitor. On Monday, Tipton
told The Daily that he did not know the
occupation of the identified suspect.
In January, Tipton also stated that
he did not know if a suspect had been
arrested or what had happened to the
serial groper.
"He's kind of hard to catch if he's
not hitting," Tipton said then. "He
could have moved on."
On Monday, Tipton said he did not
know whether the suspect was brought
in for questioning, hut did say that
"whatever admissions he makes, until
he's charged they are not admissible."
Santa Clara County Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Victoria Brown also de
clined to comment on why no charges
were pressed.
laptop taken at gunpoint
A laptop thief was arrested by Palo
Alto police on Friday night after al
legedly stealing a laptop from sopho
more Andrew Ardinger at knifepoint.

At about 7:15 p.m., the thief climbed
into Ardinger's window on the first
floor of Loro, according to police.
When Ardinger confronted the al
leged thief, the man threatened him
with a knife and escaped with the lap
top. The man fled on bicycle, but after
a description was transmitted around
the area, Palo Alto police located a
suspect near Serra Street and El
Camino Real.
"Officer Joe Kang spotted the sus
pect riding away at about 7:20 p.m.,"
said Palo Alto Lt. Doug Keith. "The
suspect saw Joe, jumped off his bicycle
and ran through yards for two blocks."
Kang caught the suspect at Birch
Street and Park Boulevard and ar
rested him.
Francisco Garcia, 33, was arrested
on charges of armed robbery and false
imprisonment after he was identified
by the Stanford Police Department.
Stanford Police Sgt. Rick Tipton
said that this robbery was probably un
related to two laptop thefts out of un

lucked dorm rooms on East Campus a
week earlier. This was a rare campus
robbery where the thief was armed,
and Tipton warned anyone caught in
such a situation not to do anything rash.
"Don't confront him," Tipton said.
"Get as much information as you can
— a description, which direction he
flees. Be the best witness you can."
Stereo thefts
Four car stereos were stolen or dam
aged in the Wilbur parking lot early Sun
day morning, according to police reports.
An unknown suspect broke win
dows and took the stereos from the
dash, though the person only succeed
ed in stealing two stereos, while break
ing the other two.
"It's a little bit different from
usual," Tipton said, noting that most
recent car burglaries have involved
only one car.
But police had little information on
Mondav about the thefts.
