### JACK LOVERIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a record-breaking men's bas
ketball season drawing to a close, the
lines of fans and clusters of reporters
at the Maples Pavilion have been re
placed by bull dozers and jackham
mers as a $30 million renovation pro
ject gets underway.
Construction at the 35-year-old
facility began March 1, signaling the
temporary closure of the sports fa
cility that hosts men and women's
basketball and volleyball games.
The renovation project will focus on
adding a covered concourse that
will loop around the perimeter and
extend 60 feet out from the current
walls. The new structure will pro
vide an area for concessions and
ticket pickup.
Assistant Athletics Director Dave
Schinski said the renovations, com
pletely funded by patron donations,
will take place over the next nine

months and are expected to be com
pleted by the last week of December.
In the mean time, however, home vol
leyball games will be played at Burn
ham Pavilion, and nonconference and
exhibition basketball games will be
hosted at the Leavey Center at UC-
Santa Clara.
"The Pavilion's age is the simple
factor behind this project." Schinski
said. "Planning for the renovation of
the Pavilion has been on our radar
since we started serious discussion
with architects in early 2000. A mod
ern, functional facility needs to pro
vide much more in terms of conve
nience and concessions access and
those areas are where we are going to
focus our efforts."
Internal renovations will include
the complete removal of the present
wooden bleachers and the addition
of retractable, arena-style seating.
The renovations will add 400 extra
