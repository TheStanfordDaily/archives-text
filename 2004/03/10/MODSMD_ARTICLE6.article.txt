# $30 million renovation launches at Maples
## 
### JACK LOVERIDGE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a record-breaking men's bas
ketball season drawing to a close, the
lines of fans and clusters of reporters
at the Maples Pavilion have been re
placed by bull dozers and jackham
mers as a $30 million renovation pro
ject gets underway.
Construction at the 35-year-old
facility began March 1, signaling the
temporary closure of the sports fa
cility that hosts men and women's
basketball and volleyball games.
The renovation project will focus on
adding a covered concourse that
will loop around the perimeter and
extend 60 feet out from the current
walls. The new structure will pro
vide an area for concessions and
ticket pickup.
Assistant Athletics Director Dave
Schinski said the renovations, com
pletely funded by patron donations,
will take place over the next nine

months and are expected to be com
pleted by the last week of December.
In the mean time, however, home vol
leyball games will be played at Burn
ham Pavilion, and nonconference and
exhibition basketball games will be
hosted at the Leavey Center at UC-
Santa Clara.
"The Pavilion's age is the simple
factor behind this project." Schinski
said. "Planning for the renovation of
the Pavilion has been on our radar
since we started serious discussion
with architects in early 2000. A mod
ern, functional facility needs to pro
vide much more in terms of conve
nience and concessions access and
those areas are where we are going to
focus our efforts."
Internal renovations will include
the complete removal of the present
wooden bleachers and the addition
of retractable, arena-style seating.
The renovations will add 400 extra

seats to the facility, which currently
seats 7,391. Additionally, the unique
four-layered floor of crisscrossing
hardwood beams will be replaced,
new floor-mounted baskets will be
added and an eight-sided score
board along with four video displays
will be mounted on the ceiling above
the court.
"I think it's awesome that they're
revamping it," said freshman Marie
Rowell. "It's too small right now, and
we need bigger score boards so we can
keep track of what's going on. In the
long run, this is going to be really ben
eficial and the wait's nothing com
pared to the outcome."
The renovations will not only ben
efit fans, however. A new press sec
tion will be constructed at the top
three rows of the arena and will be
equipped with fiber optics. Also
under construction is a 9,000-square
foot complex that will extend under
ground in front of Maples toward
Campus Drive. The subterranean fa
cility will house new locker rooms,
player lounges, showers and coaches'
offices. Media work rooms and
weight training and taping rooms are
also under construction.
"The renovations to the court itself
will maintain the intimacy and feel of
the old pavilion while improving on
the public amenities like circulation,
ticketing, concessions and restrooms,"
Schinski said. "Specifically, the seating

areas in the lower bowl will have a
wrapping' effect and we have kept the
Sixth Man Club student section as be
fore. Our modeling and treatment of
the pavilion acoustics has ensured the
continuation of an exciting and loud
home court advantage."
The piece of the old floor from
which forward Nick Robinson took
his three-point shot that kept the Car
dinal's winning streak alive in the Feb.
7 match with Oregon was auctioned
on eßay and sold for over $3,000.
Schinski said that there are currently
no plans to sell other items from the
pavilion as memorabilia.
"Playing court floors seem to be
the most symbolic elements, probably
due to the scenarios that played out
on them and their historical value,"
Schinski said. "There has been an
amazing amount of interest in the fate
of the floor. However, for now, we
have removed the floor and are stor
ing it in a warehouse until we deter
mine what to do with it."
Although he said he liked the
slight "bounce" provided by the old
game floor, volleyball player and se
nior Patrick Bomhack said the reno
vations will be a necessary inconve
nience, considering the long-term
benefits of the project.
"It would be great if these renova
tions spark an increase in attendance,
but I think Maples is a great athletic
facility as is," Bomhack said. "I won
der if our perception of what is an un
acceptable athletic facility is a little
skewed being at Stanford where
every facility is a multimillion-dollar
mosaic of perfection."

Schinski said that there are currently

"Playing court floors seem to be
the most symbolic elements, probably
due to the scenarios that played out
on them and their historical value,"
Schinski said. "There has been an
amazing amount of interest in the fate
of the floor. However, for now, we
have removed the floor and are stor
ing it in a warehouse until we deter
mine what to do with it."
Although he said he liked the
slight "bounce" provided by the old
game floor, volleyball player and se
nior Patrick Bomhack said the reno
vations will be a necessary inconve
nience, considering the long-term
benefits of the project.
"It would be great if these renova
tions spark an increase in attendance,
but I think Maples is a great athletic
facility as is," Bomhack said. "I won
der if our perception of what is an un
acceptable athletic facility is a little
skewed being at Stanford where
every facility is a multimillion-dollar
mosaic of perfection."
With a record-breaking men's bas
ketball season drawing to a close, the
lines of fans and clusters of reporters
at the Maples Pavilion have been re
placed by bull dozers and jackham
mers as a $30 million renovation pro
ject gets underway.
Construction at the 35-year-old
facility began March 1, signaling the
temporary closure of the sports fa
cility that hosts men and women's
basketball and volleyball games.
The renovation project will focus on
adding a covered concourse that
will loop around the perimeter and
extend 60 feet out from the current
walls. The new structure will pro
vide an area for concessions and
ticket pickup.
Assistant Athletics Director Dave
Schinski said the renovations, com
pletely funded by patron donations,
will take place over the next nine

months and are expected to be com
pleted by the last week of December.
In the mean time, however, home vol
leyball games will be played at Burn
ham Pavilion, and nonconference and
exhibition basketball games will be
hosted at the Leavey Center at UC-
Santa Clara.
"The Pavilion's age is the simple
factor behind this project." Schinski
said. "Planning for the renovation of
the Pavilion has been on our radar
since we started serious discussion
with architects in early 2000. A mod
ern, functional facility needs to pro
vide much more in terms of conve
nience and concessions access and
those areas are where we are going to
focus our efforts."
Internal renovations will include
the complete removal of the present
wooden bleachers and the addition
of retractable, arena-style seating.
The renovations will add 400 extra

seats to the facility, which currently
seats 7,391. Additionally, the unique
four-layered floor of crisscrossing
hardwood beams will be replaced,
new floor-mounted baskets will be
added and an eight-sided score
board along with four video displays
will be mounted on the ceiling above
the court.
"I think it's awesome that they're
revamping it," said freshman Marie
Rowell. "It's too small right now, and
we need bigger score boards so we can
keep track of what's going on. In the
long run, this is going to be really ben
eficial and the wait's nothing com
pared to the outcome."
The renovations will not only ben
efit fans, however. A new press sec
tion will be constructed at the top
three rows of the arena and will be
equipped with fiber optics. Also
under construction is a 9,000-square
foot complex that will extend under
ground in front of Maples toward
Campus Drive. The subterranean fa
cility will house new locker rooms,
player lounges, showers and coaches'
offices. Media work rooms and
weight training and taping rooms are
also under construction.
"The renovations to the court itself
will maintain the intimacy and feel of
the old pavilion while improving on
the public amenities like circulation,
ticketing, concessions and restrooms,"
Schinski said. "Specifically, the seating

areas in the lower bowl will have a
wrapping' effect and we have kept the
Sixth Man Club student section as be

the pavilion acoustics has ensured the
continuation of an exciting and loud
