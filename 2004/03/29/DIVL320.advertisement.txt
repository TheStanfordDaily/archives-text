"Images of Women in French Cinema" is designed to sup
port the study of gender roles through the discussion and
analysis of female roles in French cinema from the post-
World War II period to the 19905.
Images of Women in French Cinema
Professor Jean-Marie Apostolides
Spring Quarter 2004
Grounded in a sociological analysis of French society and
on feminist film theories, the course will be both theoretical
and practical. It is taught by Jean-Marie Apostolides and
fulfills two general requirements:
• 3a-Humanities
• 4C-Gender Studies.
The course's main objectives are:
• To define the "mythological image of woman"
• To trace the evolution of this myth over a fifty-year peri
od of French cinema
• To follow this evolution by insisting on three precise
topics: the family, the couple, and gender characteristics.
