# Band gets threeyear suspension

### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The Band has been placed on a three-year alcohol suspen
sion through winter quarter 2006-2007 for destruction of pri
vate property, violating University policy and state law for
underage alcohol consumption and violating University trav
el policy.
The charges stem from a Los Angeles road trip the Band
took on Oct. 10 of last year fora football game against the
University of Southern California. The travel bus was left in
improper condition, with broken equipment and vomit left in
the bathroom sink.
The Organizational Conduct Board and Dean of Students
Greg Boardman placed additional sanctions on the Band in

After a meeting with the Athletic Department on Oct. 24,
University officials added that all Band travel had to be cleared
through the Athletic Department and that a department staff
member would accompany the Band on buses indefinitely.
"We don't take great pleasure in any of the things that hap

In accordance with the three-year alcohol suspension, all
alcohol is to be completely removed from the Band Shak, and
there will be no alcohol at any Band events or activities, ei

Bentley attributed what he called the "over-reactionary"
sanctions, specifically sanctions concerning the alcohol sus
