# Band gets threeyear suspension
## 
### SHIRIN SHARIF DESK EDITOR 
The Band has been placed on a three-year alcohol suspen
sion through winter quarter 2006-2007 for destruction of pri
vate property, violating University policy and state law for
underage alcohol consumption and violating University trav
el policy.
The charges stem from a Los Angeles road trip the Band
took on Oct. 10 of last year fora football game against the
University of Southern California. The travel bus was left in
improper condition, with broken equipment and vomit left in
the bathroom sink.
The Organizational Conduct Board and Dean of Students
Greg Boardman placed additional sanctions on the Band in
cluding a one-year travel probation, 1,500 hours of communi
ty service of which no more than 750 hours can be musical
performances and a ban from traveling to or performing at
the Oct. 31 football game in Los Angeles this year.
The "harshness" and volume of the sanctions surprised the
Band because of the proactive steps the management had
taken after the road trip to prevent similar incidents, accord
ing to senior Dan Bentley, the Band public relations director.
The Band plans to appeal some of the sanctions in the up
coming weeks.
"We made it clear after the trip that we saw a problem and
we wanted to change," Bentley said.
As soon as Band management learned of the incidents
from the bus company, they implemented measures specify
ing that Band members going on bus trips would have to sign
a document that stated the Band's travel policy and the Fun
damental Standard. Alcohol was prohibited on buses after
the incident, and Band staff members were present in the
ratio of one staff member for every 10 Band members.
After a meeting with the Athletic Department on Oct. 24,
University officials added that all Band travel had to be cleared
through the Athletic Department and that a department staff
member would accompany the Band on buses indefinitely.
"We don't take great pleasure in any of the things that hap
pened," Bentley said. "We want to improve."
In accordance with the three-year alcohol suspension, all
alcohol is to be completely removed from the Band Shak, and
there will be no alcohol at any Band events or activities, ei
ther on- or off-campus.
Bentley attributed what he called the "over-reactionary"
sanctions, specifically sanctions concerning the alcohol sus
pension, to University efforts to raise the bar for voluntary
student organizations and for organizations to take responsi-
bility for their members'
actions.
"It's unfortunate that
the actions of a couple of
people will have such a
large impact on genera
tions of Band members
to come," Bentley said.
"They (the University]
are just killing off three
generations."
Bentley said he also
disagreed with the means
that the University is
using to achieve its ends.
If the University wants to
change the Band, it
should institute less pro
bation and more actual
changes like the ones that
the Band has already in
troduced, he said.
"If the University

wants to change our cul
ture, their methods
aren't really effective,"
Bentley said. "Our
methods do a better job
of this. Three years from
now, we'll be band
alums. We want to make
sure that the attitude
then is the attitude
now."
In response to the
sanction regarding com
munity service, Bentley
noted that the stipula
tion that the majority of
the project hours involve
providing support to
University-wide events
and other University
special projects, as "the
Band provides a service
to the Stanford commu
nity every time it plays."
The one-year travel
probation from April 6
to April 5 next year lim
its the Band to 15 off
campus Athletic Depart
ment-sponsored events
and 25 off-campus non-

Athletic Department
sponsored events.
The Band must also
establish a written set of
criteria for establishing
full-participatory mem
bership in the group and
develop an alcohol and
other substance abuse
program, a comprehen
sive leadership-training
program and party and
trip planning guidelines.
"It would take a lot of
our teams doing really
well in the NCAAs for us
to really be affected by
this," Bentley said. "But
this is technically what
we want."
The OCB hearing was
held Feb. 27 and the
Band learned the results
of the hearing from
Boardman on March 9.
At the time, an internal
band e-mail obtained by
The Daily warned Band
members not to widely
disclose the results.
"Though the rest of

the student body will
eventually find out, I as
sert to you that it is bet
ter if they find out at a
time that falls after
ASSU special fees elec
tions than before," the e
mail said.
Boardman said he has
been pleased with the
Band management since
his arrival.
"I have been im
pressed with the current
Band leadership
throughout this
process," Boardman
said. "I hope and trust
this is a sign of good
things to come. That
said, I urge the Band to
seize this opportunity to
demonstrate its commit
ment to the values and
principles of good citi
zenship by complying
with institutional stan
dards and policies ap
plicable to all registered
volunteer student orga
nizations."
