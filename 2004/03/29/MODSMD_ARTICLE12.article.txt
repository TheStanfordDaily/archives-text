# Hats off to Cardinal basketball
## 
### 
We would like to congratulate both the
men's and women's basketball teams for
their incredible seasons this year and for
their representation of the University in
this month's NCAA Tournament.
Both teams placed first in the Pacific-10 during the
regular season — with the women sharing the title with
Arizona — and both teams won the Pac-1() Tourna
ment Championship. Both teams were rewarded with
automatic berths into the NCAA Tournament and en
sured their continuing prominence in Division 1 basket
ball. The men's team earned their trip to the tournament
for the tenth straight year — a school record.
Tara VanDerveer. head coach of the women's team,
achieved her 600 th career win in 25 years of coaching
during the tournament game against Missouri on March
20. Mike Montgomery, head coach of the men's team
was named Coach of the Year by the monthly magazine
Basketball Times. Both coaches have led extremely suc
cessful programs at Stanford and have helped to mold
their players into world-class athletes, and in the process
they have made names for themselves on the national
scene. They should both be commended for their repre
sentation of Stanford on the court.
Also to be commended are the players. Both Josh
Childress and Nicole Powell have been named First-
Team All-American by the Associated Press — an
honor awarded to only five men and five women in
the nation. Childress is also a finalist for both the John
R. Wooden and the Naismith Player of the Year

awards, despite the fact that he missed the first nine
games of the season due to injury. Powell scored her
2,000 th career point against Oklahoma on March 22
and prior to the victory against Vanderbilt last night
was ranked fourth in the Stanford record books for
most career points.
These two individuals have amassed numerous acco
lades, but every player deserves recognition. Watching
both teams play, one can tell that Stanford basketball
truly is a team effort — a fact that many sportscasters
have commented on — from the vocal support from the
bench to the plays from the other starters. While the
men's season ended disappointingly early, the Alabama
team that Stanford lost to in the second round was un
deniably underrated and continued to prove its talent
when it beat defending national champion Syracuse in
the third round; the Cardinal need not be ashamed of its
showing in the men's tournament.
Meanwhile, Stanford should be truly proud of the
women's team's performance in the tournament.
Ranked sixth in their region, the Cardinal downed third
ranked Oklahoma in the second round to advance to
last night's third-round game against second-ranked
Vanderbilt, a very close game won by Stanford in the
last two seconds. The women's team now advances to
the Elite Eight. For all the hype surrounding the men's
team over the past several months, the women's team
has quietly shown that it is just as worthy of media at
tention. We wish VanDerveer and her team the best of
luck as they face the No. 1 seeded Lady Vols.
