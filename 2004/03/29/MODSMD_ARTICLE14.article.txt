## What keeps America together 
### 
Interstate-40, U.S.A.—Think-
ing about volunteering fora
presidential campaign? Noble
goal. Good luck. Could be fun —
if you're a masochist. Don't believe
me? Then you haven't spent any time
on an American interstate.
Here's your mission, should you
chose to accept it: Pick an issue — any
issue — and tell me how you're going
to get all of these people to buy the po
sition you and your candidate are try
ing to sell:
- The farmers in unpleasantly arid
central and southern California,
where the highway is littered with
signs reminding you that "Food
Grows Where Water Flows."
- The Grand Canyon park rangers
who charge you $20 to drive into the
park but don't mention the federal
government's threats to fire docents,
cut back park hours and close the park
on national holidays.
- The minister in Flagstaff, Ariz.,
whose church advertises that "1 Cross
+ 3 Nails -4 Given."
- The American Indians in New
Mexico who have also managed to lit
ter the highway with signs imploring
you to buy "cheap Indian goods."
OK, OK ... so you're a high-mind
ed idealist, like any good Stanford stu
dent should be. This task doesn't seem
insurmountable. But I haven't even
gotten past New Mexico. What if I
throw in some people east of Moun
tain Standard Time, such as:
- The 60-year-old woman that
works at "Boots 'N Jeans" in Amaril
lo, Tex. and has a fancy belt buckle
for when she goes out fora night on
the town.
- Whoever decided to build the
largest cross in the Western hemi
sphere (really) about 60 miles west of
Shamrock, Texas.
- The lonely gas station attendant
in Barstow. Okla. that can't believe
Pitt almost beat Oklahoma State and
sells an 18-pack of Busch Light for
$10.45. (Come on now. Shibu, let's get
with the program here.)
- The homeless black man who asks
for spare change near Beale Street in
Memphis and suggests, after you have
blown most of your money on over
priced barbeque in the city's main
tourist trap, that you check out the site
of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassina
tion just two blocks down the street...
Suffice it to say the Lorraine Motel is
a lot harder to find than he promised,
but you can tour the modest National
Civil Rights Museum housed there

for free.
- Here's the kicker — this guy just
might mess up your game plan — the

Minnesota uncle
and Vietnam vet
eran who exasper
atedly proclaims,
"Fighting for peace
is like screwing for
virginity," and is
quick to add, "Is
there a single
party that espous
es what you truly
believe? Where is

the third party?"
By the time you're riding the Music
Highway through Nashville, I'll bet
you'll be less optimistic and more
amazed that Texas is the only state try
ing to secede from the union. After
seeing, along one road in a matter of
four days, the diversity of life — and
political interests — that exist in one
country, all that's left to conclude is
that it's pretty damn remarkable no
one has just stopped by Los Alamos,
N. M. (only an hour off I-40), picked up
some nukes and blown everyone up.
If that doesn't work, there are still
some alien spaceships in Roswell.
N.M. (not even three hours off 1-40)
that could surely be resurrected to fuel
intranational sectarian combat.
Frankly, it's amazing New Mexico still
exists at all.
Land of Enchantment aside, en
countering this array of situations and
interests is discouraging when it forces
the realization that maybe the desires
of each person within the geographic
borders of the United States are funda
mentally incompatible with what other
people want. The United States cer
tainly wouldn't be the lirst nation-state
to face this dilemma, but in the grand
scheme of things this has yet to pose a
large-scale problem. Quebec wants to
get the hell out of Canada, any good
Rage Against the Machine fan would
know that there's been rebellion in
southern Mexico for years — and
that's just in North America. Hangout
with Louis Bremmer in Iraq and men
tion "Kurds" and it becomes clear that
holding it all together seems to be a lot
harder everywhere else than it is here.
So what's our "secret?" How have
we avoided Civil War Redux? (so far,
at least... anybody betting on the gay
marriage controversy to finally push
out the South once and for all?) It's
not hard to pick up the popular answer
to this question along the 1-40 as well.
Born to be free. That's right —

freedom, man. Did I mention the free
dom? Freedom freedom freedom.
Dude, where's my freedom?
If you were to look at every bill
board visible from the I-4()— I don't
care if you're in Albuquerque or Little
Rock — the only word that rivals
"God" and "Jesus" in terms of fre
quency is "freedom." Throw bumper
stickers into the equation and you're
going to be so sick of freedom you may
finally take that tour of Alcatraz and
"forget" to leave.
OK, probably not. Because, as
George W. Bush & Co. are more than
happy to remind you, "freedom" is a
good thing people generally like to have
around. Whether at the current admin
istration's urging or as part of a much
broader, entrenched phenomenon, it
becomes clear that the majority of the
American population has bought into
the idea that any difference that exists
can be eclipsed by a mutual love, pas
sion and respect for "freedom."
But by the time you hit your three
hundred-fifty-thirteenth-umpteenth
billboard extolling the virtues of "free
dom." you start to wonder what that
word really means. In the context of
the government, it would seem "free
dom" means "we better let people do
whatever the hell they want or this
whole deal is going to implode." But in
practice, it certainly doesn't seem that
all those people you encounter along
the 1-40 are free or able to pursue their
interests — and even if they were,
would that result in the sort of society
you and your fellow campaign volun
teers hope to create?
So this poses two important ques
tions for you as you run back to cam
paign headquarters. First, what falls
through the cracks when you just de
cide to let everybody alone? Can you
accept this premise and still project a
political vision? And second, if you
don't just let everybody alone, but if
no one is ever going to want the same
thing, then who wins? Basically you
have to wonder — is faith in the vague
concept of "freedom" enough to sus
tain a nation?
I'm not saying 1 have the answers
— that's for your campaign to figure
out. All I'm saying is that, right now,
I'm not particularly excited to vote for
any of you, but I sure did enjoy being
able to go on my cross-country drive.
