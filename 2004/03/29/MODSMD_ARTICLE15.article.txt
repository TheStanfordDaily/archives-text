# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Our fine nation of... blonghds 
### 
News tends to pile up at The
Daily during the ten-day
span of spring break. Two
weeks ago, Martha Stewart
was convicted. And 12 days ago, Conan
O'Brien made a joke about it. Eleven
days ago. Jay Leno and David Letter
man did the same. Ten days ago, The
Onion covered it.and nine days ago,
there was a cartoon about it in ITie New
Yorker. Yesterday, Phil Thompson, a
kid I know from English class, made
what he thought was a really clever and
original insight. Way to go, Phil.
In other news...
California atheist Michael Newdow
is suing the school district his 3rd-grade
daughter attends — Elk Grove Uni
fied School District in Sacramento —
claiming that the Pledge of Allegiance
is a form of religious "indoctrination."
Newdow cites the clause "under God"
as an endorsement of religion, some
thing he argues violates the Constitu
tion s ban on government-established
religion. Newdow's wife, a born-again
Christian, is against the decision to sue.
Critics think the case is probably
going to be thrown out, but it makes
for an interesting question: Should we
care what born-again Christians say?
Whoops. I mean, should we keep the
phrase "under God" in the Pledge
of Allegiance?
Let's look back at 1954, when the
U.S. Congress decided to add the
phrase "under God" to the Pledge of
Allegiance. It wasn't in there before,
but religious lobbyists (always people
we should trust) and Cold War hawks
(always open-minded individuals) de
termined that it had to be put in there.
If you read how the rhythm of the
pledge is thrown off by the phrase, you
can probably tell that it was written by
politicians. They hoped the phrase
"under God" would serve as a vocal
shield against would-be commies and /
or free thinkers. Those two words may
have done more than detente to end
the war.

In my opinion, the same clear-mind
ed, non-panicked thinking that defined
the Cold War era can still be applied to

today's world. If
there's anything
modern politicians
can tell us, it's that
we can get all of
our values from
the 19505.
And let's face it:
We need that kind
of unification right
now. If we don't in
doctrinate our chil-

dren to love Amer
ica, who will? I mean, you may think
that as a kid. you only kind-of said the
pledge. You may not have thought it
was important. You may have been
half-asleep, with oatmeal on your
breath, only waiting for gym class. My,
how you loved gym class. The feel of
your shorts, the thrill of dodgebail, the
way the other boys...
Where was I? Oh yes, we need to
keep the Pledge of Allegiance in
our schools. And the "under God"
thing must stay, because otherwise
Luxembourg will think we are weak
and invade.
But in my opinion, keeping the
Pledge of Allegiance God-friendly isn't
the biggest concern. It's the National
Anthem I'm worried about. No one has
reported on this recently, but it is a sad
fact of modern times that the National
Anthem is being desecrated. Dozens,
perhaps millions, of people are giving
Lady Liberty a slap in the face every
time they sing the National Anthem.
And I'm not talking about some a
cappella group missing the high F. No,
they may be terrible human beings, but
the;' are not threats to our nation.
I'm talking about the repeated,
atrocious, butcher-like slaying of our
National Anthem. I'm talking about
Norwegians screwing up royally.
In Los Angeles two weeks ago. Nor
wegian pop recording artist Sissel at

tacked America directly with what
should be recorded as the worst thing to
happen to the Staples Center since
Shaq began shooting free throws there.
Her attack was insidious, unexpect
ed. She lured her audience into an un
suspecting state with her cool, Celine
Dion-like vocals. Then she struck. It
first happened when she repeated the
line "through the perilous fight" for re
ally no reason. Then she went Mike
Tyson and mumbled out the next two
lines. She concluded with "blonghd of
the free, home of the brave." I still have
no idea what the heck "blonghd"
means. 1 think it's some Norwegian
word fora type of bread roll, the equiv
alent of calling someone a "jerk." So
basically, she got away with calling us
jerks. She started the song so brilliantly
and then mocked our nation by calling
us a land of "blonghds." Clearly, she
must be stopped.
And her power is gaining, not wan
ing. She has sold eight million albums
world-wide, and is participating in the
"Lord of the Rings Music Tour." The
eight million albums are probably gross
mockeries of our finest patriotic cus
toms. I hear one of her album covers
features her looking up ITie Statue of
Liberty's copper nightie. As for"The
Lord of the Rings Tour," what the hell
is that? I mean, seriously. Are they
going to reenact epic scenes from the
movie as she sings along? Is Gimli
going to belt the blues? Do the Hobbits
have a heavy metal band? The entire
thing reeks of being un-American. Not
to mention really stupid.
With Luxembourg's invasion
looming, the Norwegian musical
threat of Sissel on the rise and Hobbits
possibly forming a heavy metal cover
band of "Slayer." we are in fora rough
spring. I"he only thing worse. I sup
pose, is being Phil Thompson He's a
definite blonghd.

we can get all of
our values from
the 19505.
And let's face it:
We need that kind
of unification right
now. If we don't in
doctrinate our chil-

dren to love Amer
ica, who will? I mean, you may think
that as a kid. you only kind-of said the
pledge. You may not have thought it
was important. You may have been
half-asleep, with oatmeal on your
breath, only waiting for gym class. My,
how you loved gym class. The feel of
your shorts, the thrill of dodgebail, the
way the other boys...
Where was I? Oh yes, we need to
keep the Pledge of Allegiance in
our schools. And the "under God"
thing must stay, because otherwise
Luxembourg will think we are weak
and invade.
But in my opinion, keeping the
Pledge of Allegiance God-friendly isn't
the biggest concern. It's the National
Anthem I'm worried about. No one has
reported on this recently, but it is a sad
fact of modern times that the National
Anthem is being desecrated. Dozens,
perhaps millions, of people are giving
Lady Liberty a slap in the face every
time they sing the National Anthem.
And I'm not talking about some a
cappella group missing the high F. No,
they may be terrible human beings, but
the;' are not threats to our nation.
I'm talking about the repeated,
atrocious, butcher-like slaying of our
National Anthem. I'm talking about
Norwegians screwing up royally.
In Los Angeles two weeks ago. Nor
wegian pop recording artist Sissel at

tacked America directly with what
should be recorded as the worst thing to
happen to the Staples Center since
Shaq began shooting free throws there.
Her attack was insidious, unexpect
ed. She lured her audience into an un
suspecting state with her cool, Celine
Dion-like vocals. Then she struck. It
first happened when she repeated the
line "through the perilous fight" for re
ally no reason. Then she went Mike
Tyson and mumbled out the next two
lines. She concluded with "blonghd of
the free, home of the brave." I still have
no idea what the heck "blonghd"
means. 1 think it's some Norwegian
word fora type of bread roll, the equiv
alent of calling someone a "jerk." So
basically, she got away with calling us
jerks. She started the song so brilliantly
and then mocked our nation by calling
us a land of "blonghds." Clearly, she
must be stopped.
And her power is gaining, not wan
ing. She has sold eight million albums
world-wide, and is participating in the
"Lord of the Rings Music Tour." The
eight million albums are probably gross
mockeries of our finest patriotic cus
toms. I hear one of her album covers
features her looking up ITie Statue of
Liberty's copper nightie. As for"The
Lord of the Rings Tour," what the hell
is that? I mean, seriously. Are they
going to reenact epic scenes from the
movie as she sings along? Is Gimli
going to belt the blues? Do the Hobbits
have a heavy metal band? The entire
thing reeks of being un-American. Not
to mention really stupid.
With Luxembourg's invasion
looming, the Norwegian musical
threat of Sissel on the rise and Hobbits
possibly forming a heavy metal cover
band of "Slayer." we are in fora rough
spring. I"he only thing worse. I sup
pose, is being Phil Thompson He's a
definite blonghd.

News tends to pile up at The
Daily during the ten-day
span of spring break. Two
weeks ago, Martha Stewart
was convicted. And 12 days ago, Conan
O'Brien made a joke about it. Eleven
days ago. Jay Leno and David Letter
man did the same. Ten days ago, The
Onion covered it.and nine days ago,
there was a cartoon about it in ITie New
Yorker. Yesterday, Phil Thompson, a
kid I know from English class, made
what he thought was a really clever and
original insight. Way to go, Phil.
In other news...
California atheist Michael Newdow
is suing the school district his 3rd-grade
daughter attends — Elk Grove Uni
fied School District in Sacramento —
claiming that the Pledge of Allegiance
is a form of religious "indoctrination."
Newdow cites the clause "under God"
as an endorsement of religion, some
thing he argues violates the Constitu
tion s ban on government-established
religion. Newdow's wife, a born-again
Christian, is against the decision to sue.
Critics think the case is probably
going to be thrown out, but it makes
for an interesting question: Should we
care what born-again Christians say?
Whoops. I mean, should we keep the
phrase "under God" in the Pledge
of Allegiance?
Let's look back at 1954, when the
U.S. Congress decided to add the
phrase "under God" to the Pledge of
Allegiance. It wasn't in there before,
but religious lobbyists (always people
we should trust) and Cold War hawks
(always open-minded individuals) de
termined that it had to be put in there.
If you read how the rhythm of the
pledge is thrown off by the phrase, you
can probably tell that it was written by
politicians. They hoped the phrase
"under God" would serve as a vocal
shield against would-be commies and /
or free thinkers. Those two words may
have done more than detente to end
the war.

In my opinion, the same clear-mind
ed, non-panicked thinking that defined
the Cold War era can still be applied to

today's world. If
there's anything
modern politicians
can tell us, it's that
we can get all of
our values from
the 19505.
And let's face it:
