## No. 1 Card completes Cal Poly sweep 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
When your pitchers hardly need any run support
but your hitters give them all that any team could ask
for, you know that things are going well.
Such is the case for the top-ranked Cardinal base
hall team, which got the broom out of the equipment
shed after a two-week hiatus for finals and spring
break and swept Cal Poly (22-12-1) out of Sunken
Diamond to run its record to 20-3. The Cardinal
sandwiched two blowouts — 16-4 on Friday and 10-
3 yesterday — around a 3-1 win on Saturday.
Stanford, winner of 11 of its last 12 games, is right
where it wants to be heading into the beginning of
official Pacific-10 Conference play next week. The
team's hitting and pitching are clicking at the same
time — the Cardinal scored 29 runs and gave up only
10 in the series.
"We pitched well and played solid defense, and
I'm pleased," said head coach Mark Marquess. "We
deserve it."
The starting pitching, which was a big question
mark at the beginning of the season — when Stan
ford had only one experienced starter — was lights
out this weekend, and it seems that the staff has set
tled down into a set rotation.
Each starter went at least seven innings for the
first time this year, and the trio of Mark Romanczuk,
Blake Holler and Jeff Gilmore allowed a grand total
of four earned runs in 22 innings.
Romanczuk pitched well on Friday and got plen
ty of help from his friends. Shortstop Jed Lowrie

continued his hot streak, clubbing a three-run home
run in the bottom of the first inning, his eighth of the
season, to go with a team-leading 35 RBI in just 81
at-bats.
To put those numbers in perspective: If Lowrie
were playing a standard major league season, he
would be on pace to hit over 50 homers and 200 RBI.
He is the prime example of a player who has stepped
up on a Stanford team full of players who have
stepped up this year.
"It's contagious," Lowrie said, "because you see
the guys in front of you hit the ball well and you want
to do the same."
That has been the case for most of the season, but
Saturday was a different story.
The Cardinal hitters weren't themselves, scratch
ing out only three runs, but it didn't matter because
of a gutsy performance by Holler, who nearly threw
a complete game. After struggling early, he settled
down and took a 3-1 lead into the ninth, but Holler
allowed two quick singles and was pulled in favor of
senior David O'Hagan.
After a sacrifice bunt by Cal Poly first baseman
Kyle Blumenthal, O'Hagan struck out pinch-hitter
Billy Saul and got Sam Herbert to fly out to Sam
Fuld in center.
O'Hagan has been the team's fireman this season,
notching four saves in a team-leading eight appear
ances and coming in to slam the door whenever a
starter struggles. He has compiled a 1.30 ERA and
opposing batters are hitting just .194 against him.
Holler got out of jambs in each of the first three
innings, in which he allowed seven hits, but he set

tied down and did not allow another baserunner
until the ninth.
"I was a little disappointed not to have finished
the game, hut 1 was happy with the way it came out,"
he said.
Sophomore Jeff Gilmore picked up where Holler
left off in yesterday's game, allowing only four hits
and walking none in seven innings of work.
"He was in command for the whole game," Mar
quess said.
"I was able to mix things up and get each pitch
working," Gilmore said. "They're a tough team to
strike out, though. You have to give them credit. We
just got them early in the count."
The offense came back to life yesterday, jumping
on Cal Poly early to pound out six runs in the first
four innings, which proved to be plenty the way
Gilmore was pitching.
First baseman John Mayberry Jr. singled twice
and added some insurance with a three-run home
run to left field in the sixth inning.
Freshman Ryan Seawell singled in the team's first
two runs with the bases loaded in the bottom of the
second, and the Cardinal never looked back.
"1 was looking fastball because I knew he was
struggling to throw strikes, and I just saw the ball
and got the barrel of the bat on it," Seawell said.
He went on to bang out two more base knocks,
and finished the day three-for-four with four RBI.
So, after a weeklong break from practice, the
team is back in business, refreshed and ready to
begin the most important stretch of the regular sea
son, starting next weekend at UCLA.
