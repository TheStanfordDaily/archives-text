# The 						fairy tale ends in Seattle (again); Card finishes history-making season 30-2

### ARISHA HATCH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
SEATTLE, Wash. — A little over two weeks ago, in the same city
that the top-seeded Cardinal lost its first game of the season to Washing
ton. then-No. 1 Stanford (30-2) racked up its second and final loss of the
year, a 70-67 upset by eighth-seeded, unranked Alabama in the second
round of the NCAA tournament.
More importantly and perhaps most devastatingly for Stanford fans,
for the second time in three weeks, a Stanford fairy tale ended in Seattle.
And.in reality, it had all the makings of a fairy tale — all the drama
and intrigue and seemingly ironic storylines — an almost-perfect season
with the potential to make a return trip to San Antonio for the Final
Four.
But it didn't end that way. Instead, the Cardinal failed to advance past
the round of 32 for the third consecutive year.
This particular ending — during this particular season finale — stung
a bit more than the sites and sounds of U-dub fans rushing the courts at
Hec Edmundson Pavilion, the (irst blemish on a season that had been, up
until that point, blemish-free.
"It's very difficult to gain some perspective from this game when we
are hurting so badly, and to try to put into perspective what we've ac
complished this year," said Stanford head coach Mike Montgomery as
he struggled to find his words. "I can't really help them through that."
"I'm angry," junior swingman Josh Childress added. "I'm angry and
disappointed."
After an even opening period in which the Cardinal found itself up by

two at the half, 39-37, Stanford clawed its way to a 13-point second half
lead with eight minutes left to play, holding the Crimson Tide to 1 -of-17
shooting for the opening 12 minutes of the period.
And then the unthinkable happened — the tide turned — and Stan
ford went cold.
Alabama scored 16 consecutive points over the next 41/2 minutes to
take the lead, 56-53, and Childress picked up his fifth foul and was forced
to watch the remaining three minutes from the bench. Childress finished
with 12 points and seven boards in what might be his final game in a Stan
ford uniform.
The Cardinal came within one-point of the Crimson Tide when
sophomore forward Matt Haryasz converted a fastbreak layup just
under the two-minute mark, bringing the score to 58-57 in favor of Al
abama.
"We were down but I never thought it had slipped away," Childress
said. "They hit their free throws, which was unfortunate for us, but I
[never] felt like it slipped away."
But Stanford never took the lead as the Cardinal missed three at
tempts from the field during a critical 40-second stretch in which the Tide
converted six free throws to extend its lead to seven with 46 seconds left
to play.
Senior shooting guard Matt Lottich hit a pair of 3-pointers with less
than 30 seconds remaining and senior forward Justin Davis converted a
putback to bring the Cardinal back within three points with 7.2 seconds
on the clock.

The Stanford bench watched the final moments of the Cardinal's 70-67 season-ending loss to eighth-seeded Alabama with great antici
pation. The Crimson Tide's upset over the Cardinal represented Stanford's third consecutive NCAA tournament second round loss.
Then, Alabama guard Earnest Shelton
missed a pair of free throws on the other
end with 5.6 seconds left on the clock, al
lowing the Cardinal one more chance to
tie, to pull off another last second miracle.
Stanford forward Nick Robinson
pushed the ball up court and found sopho
more shooting guard Dan Grunfeld on the
wing.
But Grunfeld's shot came up just short
as he fell to the ground in disappointment.
"I thought it had a chance," said a
disappointed Grunfeld. "At that point
you're hoping a little bit. When I let it
go it was in the vicinitv."

And when it was all over — when
the dust had settled, after various Al
abama players pumped their fists in
the air in celebration, cheering along
with their fans, after the Key Arena
crowd was emptied and silent — after
all of that, Stanford was left to remi
nisce, once again, about a run that
ended prematurely in Seattle, about
its season, the streak, "the second
round jinx," how far they had come
and all that team chemistry and cama
raderie that had sustained this team
for so long.
After all that reminiscing, the Cardinal
will be forced to try to pick up the pieces,
to confront the reality of the situation
and, perhaps most importantly, convince
itself that there are dreams left to chase,
that maybe, just maybe, that this loss is
just another page, another twist, in the
eventual fairy tale — that there are still
"happy endings" left to achieve.
