# Despite its early postseason exit, Stanford's season was magical
## 
### 
So, they lost in the second
round, as they have in each
of my three years at Stan
ford. Let it at least be said,
though, that it is impressive simply
to reach the second round 10 years
in a row, even if you lose seven of
those games. Sure, you could say
those frustrating losses define
Stanford basketball, and I
wouldn't completely disagree.
Let's be honest — everyone is
aware of that stigma.
But Stanford fans should at
least be glad that an early loss in
the tournament is always a disap
pointment. That is to say, while
Stanford basketball can't claim to
be defined by postseason success,
it is defined by always finding a
way to get there in a very competi
tive, capricious sport.
And getting there is a much
truer test of talent than winning
once you're there. Does anyone
really think Alabama would win a
seven-game series against the
Cardinal? How about Alabama-
Birmingham vs. Kentucky? Even
more unlikely.
The NCAA Tournament is, if
nothing else, unfair. The best team
in the nation rarely wins it. Even
Duke — which is so stacked talent
wise that the New York Yankees
wish they were the Blue Devils of
Major League Baseball — has
been upset short of its goal much
more often than not (thank you.
Jay Williams).
The Tournament rewards a lot
of things that don't necessarily
play into Stanford's hands. It re
wards gambles, big one-time per
formances and, particularly, mo
mentum. This year's second
round giant-slayers, Alabama and
Alabama-Birmingham, beat vast
ly superior teams thanks to frenet
ic hustle, clutch shooting and a
healthy dose of sheer will. As the
saying goes, they had nothing to
lose. Meanwhile, the Wildcats and
Cardinal, with everything to lose,
were swept up by the (Crimson)
tide of improbability.
Watching the Stanford loss —
as the Cardinal diligently ran its of
fense during Alabama's big run
only to miss good shot after good
shot while Alabama ran down the
floor, flew into the face of a tough
defense and scored basket after
basket — is as good as any evi
dence that the Tournament unfair
ly distills 30 games' worth of prepa
ration into a few minuies.
That's not to excuse Stanford
(or Kentucky) for dropping a
winnable game against inferior
teams that inevitably and not
surprisingly got steamrolled in
later rounds.
But it is to say that for every
Cinderella, there's someone
heading home from the dance
early and alone.
Let's look at the bright side.

Thirty wins against two losses. A
magical regular season that felt so
very meaningful and historic.
Mind-blowing clutch shots and in
credible comebacks. The confer
ence crown and a Pac-10 Tourna
ment title.
Would you trade all that fora
20-win regular season and a couple
more rounds of advancement in
the Tournament?
I don't know that 1 would. This
Stanford team

was — is —
one of the best
units in the
country. And
the Cardinal
was incredibly
enjoyable to
watch.
Sure, it will
be very bitter
sweet when

someone else cuts down the nets
and when CBS plays its inexplica
bly touching "One Shining Mo
ment" highlight video.
But just remember how you felt
when Nick Robinson and Matt
Lottich hit their game-winning
threes. Sure, the storybook had the
last few pages ripped out, but it was
a great ride, one most schools are
lucky to experience even once a
century. Stanford itself went al
most 50 years between postseason
appearances before Mike Mont
gomery built the present decade
long dynasty.
On the plus side for Cardinal
fans, while the men provided a
heartbreaking upset this year, the
women are producing a heart
warming Cinderella run. As a No.
6 seed in the women's Tourna
ment, they managed to upset No. 3
seed Oklahoma last week. Yester
day, Kelley Suminski drained a 3-
pointer with 0.3 seconds remaining
to give the Cardinal a come-from
behind win over No. 2 seed Van
derbilt, 57-55, and a berth in the
Elite Eight.
The women struggled a bit dur
ing the regular season, and after a
pair of February losses in Arizona,
many dreaded an early postseason
upset. But, in true Tournament
fashion, they rolled to a Pac-10
tourney crown and then rode their
momentum and superior talent to
what can already be called a suc
cessful postseason. Maybe basket
ball tourneys aren't always so bad
after all.
