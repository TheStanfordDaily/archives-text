### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
I hough the Auburn women's swimming and diving
squad left ( ollege Station, Texas, last week with its
third national title in hand, Stanford senior Tara Kirk
left the N( A A C hampionships just as content as anv
of the Tigers.
Kirk returned to the Farm with NCAA Swimmer
of the Year honors — making her the fourth Cardi
nal woman to win the award — along with her 10th
and 11th NCAA titles. She completed her college ca
reer with a perfect 35-0 mark in the 100-yard breast
stroke. She was a part of a solid Cardinal team that
finished the meet in fifth place — one spot above its
2003 finish.
Oh yeah, and she broke a world record.
Kirk's 1:04.79 finish in the 100 breast — which was
her fourth consecutive national title in the event —
smashed the world record set in 2003 by Leisel Jones
of Australia (1:05.09) and was the perfect cap to Kirk's
illustrious Stanford career.

"I don't think 1 could have had a better ending [to
my college career]," said Kirk, a possible 2004
Olympian. "This is one more thing that I can say I've
accomplished that's really satisfying."
Kirk's world record was easily the highlight of the
Championships for the Cardinal, but the team showed
depth and strength in many events that led to its fifth
place finish, just behind second-place Georgia, Ari
zona and Florida.
Stanford kicked off competition on March 18 with
a second-place finish in a hard-fought 400 medley
relay race. Kirk and her younger sister, sophomore
Dana Kirk, teamed up with juniors Lacey Boutwell
and Tami Ransom to clock in at 3:58.00, less than two
seconds behind the winning team from Georgia.
Boutwell touched at a personal-best 25.23 in the 50
freestyle fora seventh place finish in the event, mak
ing her Stanford's top scoring individual swimmer on
the first day.
Junior diver Ashlee Rosenthal finished in seventh
in the 1-meter springboard with a final score of
287.15, improving on her eighth place finish at the

2003 NCAAs. Alison Brennan of South Carolina
took top honors in the 1-meter, racking up 307.20
points in the finals.
Spectators got quite a show on Friday, as they not
only witnessed Kirk's 100 meter shocker, but saw Cal
ifornia senior Natalie Coughlin capture her fourth
consecutive win in both the 100 butterfly and 100
backstroke. Coughlin and Kirk are two of only four
swimmers in history to win the same event four
straight years at NCAAs.
Dana Kirk finished in second behind Coughlin
in the 100 fly with a time of 57.16, a personal best
for the sophomore.
The Cardinal, which entered the day in fifth place,
had another successful medley relay race on the sec
ond day, hitting the wall in time fora third-place fin
ish. The Kirk sisters combined with senior Megan
Baumgartner and junior Sarah Jones on the effort.
Stanford did not compete in the final rounds for
half of the day's events, which pushed the Cardinal
down a slot in the team standings to sixth going into
the third day.

The elder Kirk raced to victory in the 200 breast for
the 19th straight time, clocking in at 2:20.70, an Amer
ican record. Boutwell also added key points to the
team's total, touching the wall at 54.49 in the 100 free,
good enough for third place.
Dana Kirk had another personal best in her second
fly race, the 200-meter, ending in fourth place with a
time of 2:06.54.
Freshman Lauren Costella won the consolation
final of the 1500 free to add points to the Cardinal
score and sophomore diver Sara Bowling earned
413.60 points and a seventh-place finish for her per
formance on the platform.
Kaitlin Sandeno of Southern California garnered
the highest individual point total in the meet with 57.
with Coughlin just behind at 56. Auburn swimmers
Kirsty Coventry and Margaret Hoelzer each managed
54 to tie for third.
The NCAA meet completes the season for the Car
dinal, which held a No. 5 ranking heading into the
competition. Stanford ended the year with a 5-2 dual
meet record.
