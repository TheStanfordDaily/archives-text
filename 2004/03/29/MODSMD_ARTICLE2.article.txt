# Suminski's buzzer-beating three sends Stanford to the Elite Eight
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
NORMAN, Okla. —When the Stan
ford women's basketball team (29-6) re
ceived its draw from the NCAA Selection
Committee, things looked bleak. A No. 6
seed in the Midwest, where the Cardinal
would be lumped behind overall No. 1 seed
Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma — many
pundits' dark horse pick to reach the Final
Four — and SEC Tournament Champ
Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with a huge
chip on its shoulder and used the Selection
Committee's snub to advance to the Elite
Eight yesterday, defeating Vanderbilt in
the Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three-point
er by junior Kelley Suminski with 0.3 sec
onds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a nine
point halftime lead behind the brilliant
first half play of Nicole Powell. Powell,
who had a double-double within 12 min
utes of tipoff, orchestrated the Stanford
offense to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Com
modores' patented matchup zone defense
with ease in the first 20 minutes, shooting
an astounding 61.9 percent from the field
in the first half, including 6-for-10 from
long range.
Powell finished the first half with 14
points, 11 rebounds and six assists, but what
may have been more important than the
All-American's stellar play was the ability
of her teammates to step up.
In the first half, junior forward T'Nae
Thiel and junior guard Sebnem Kimya
cioglu chipped in with six points apiece,
while Suminski had four.
In the second half, however, it seemed
as though an entirely different team took
the floor. The Cardinal shot just 26.9 per
cent from the floor in the second half on 7-
of-26 shooting.
Powell, who was 5-of-8 from the field in
the opening half, did not convert a single

field goal in the second half, going 0-of-8.
Additionally, the crowd turned on the
Cardinal squad — which had knocked out
hometown Oklahoma in the second round
— and on Powell in particular. After Pow
ell fouled freshman Dee Davis on a break
away and Davis did not immediately get
up, the crowd began to boo Powell on
every touch.
"In the second half it was just tough to
get open shots," Powell said. "I had a cou
ple of good looks I didn't knock down and
frankly, I made some awful turnovers. But
it's a team game."
Vanderbilt capitalized on the Stanford's
cold shooting — and fast. Within two min
utes of the start of the second half, the
Commodores cut the Cardinal's lead to just
three points, and with 16:24 remaining,
Vandermilt tied the ballgame on a Jenni
Benningfield layup.
"Vanderbilt was playing a lot more ag
gressively in the second half," said senior
center Chelsea Trotter, who chipped in
three points and two assists. "We had our
was in the first half, but they really stepped
it up a notch in the second half. The inten
sity level skyrocketed and fora while they
were dictating the pace of the game."
Despite its poor second-half shooting
performance, Stanford managed to stay in
the game with its defense. The Cardinal
held Vanderbilt to 41.5 percent shooting on
the game and limited Benningfield, the
Commodores' All-America candidate to
11 points on 4-of-13 shooting.
Stanford also won the rebounding
battle, 33-28, which proved key, as it was
able to limit Vanderbilt's second chance
opportunities.
Despite the Cardinal's outstanding de
fense and rebounding, the Commodores
were able to build a 55-52 lead with just
2:37 on the clock.
And after 2:06 of scoreless ball by both
teams, Powell was able to work herself to
the line, drawing a foul on Hillary Hager.

Junior guard Kelley Sumanski hit the game-winning three-pointer
against Vanderbilt yesterday to send the Cardinal to the Elite Eight of
the NCAA Tournament. Sumanski's basket just before time expired
helped Stanford overcome a subpar second half shooting perfor
mance. Stanford will face top-seeded Tennesse on Tuesday night.
Powell coolly sank both free throws and
the Commodores got the hall back with
43.1 seconds to go.
Stanford, however, employed its out
standing defense once again and forced a
30-second shot clock violation to regain
possession with 11.2 seconds on the clock,
setting the stage for Suniinski's heroics.
Predictably, it was Powell who took the
ball up the court for the Cardinal. And pre
dictably, Powell drove to the hoop, at
tempting to get by her defender with a spin
move. Instead, she drew a tough double
team, but rather than force the shot, she
wisely found a wide-open Suminski just

behind the 3-point arc, who drained the
game-winner.
"We were looking for Nicole to get the
last shot," said Suminski. "1 saw her pene
trating and I went to slide behind her in
case someone went to [double-team], and
they did. She made a great pass and I don't
really know what happened after that."
Powell recorded her ninth assist of the
night on the final play, missing a triple
double by just a single assist as she also tal
lied 16 points and 17 boards.
Suminski's final stat line was impressive
as well as the junior tallied 11 points and
seven rebounds.
In order for the Cardinal to reach the
Sweet Sixteen, it had to get through two
Big 12 powers — Oklahoma and Missouri.
After having no trouble with the Mis
souri, defeating the Tigers 68-44, Stanford
was slated for an absolute battle with the
Sooners.
Oklahoma, playing fora chance to con

tinue Regional action on its home court,
was one of the hottest teams in the nation
coming into the Tournament after a sur
prise Big 12 Tournament win. But that bat
tle never materialized. •
Stanford's defense absolutely dominat
ed and Powell was, once again, outstand
ing on the offensive end of the floor. Pow
ell finished with 23 points, 11 boards and
seven assists and the Cardinal allowed just
43 points to the usually balanced Sooners.
Thiel and Suminski absolutely shut
down Oklahoma's two top scores, guard
Maria Villaroel and forward Caton Hill.
Villaroel managed just eight points on 2-
of-11 shooting, while Hill had only nine.
Stanford will have a chance to advance
to the Final Four on Tuesday, when it will
face Tennessee for the second time this
season. The Lady Volunteers got the best
of the Cardinal in their December
matchup, winning an overtime thriller, 70-
66.

43.1 seconds to go.
Stanford, however, employed its out
standing defense once again and forced a
30-second shot clock violation to regain
possession with 11.2 seconds on the clock,
setting the stage for Suniinski's heroics.
Predictably, it was Powell who took the
ball up the court for the Cardinal. And pre
dictably, Powell drove to the hoop, at
tempting to get by her defender with a spin
move. Instead, she drew a tough double
team, but rather than force the shot, she
wisely found a wide-open Suminski just

behind the 3-point arc, who drained the
game-winner.
"We were looking for Nicole to get the
last shot," said Suminski. "1 saw her pene
trating and I went to slide behind her in
case someone went to [double-team], and
they did. She made a great pass and I don't
really know what happened after that."
Powell recorded her ninth assist of the
night on the final play, missing a triple
double by just a single assist as she also tal
lied 16 points and 17 boards.
Suminski's final stat line was impressive
as well as the junior tallied 11 points and
seven rebounds.
In order for the Cardinal to reach the
Sweet Sixteen, it had to get through two
Big 12 powers — Oklahoma and Missouri.
After having no trouble with the Mis
souri, defeating the Tigers 68-44, Stanford
was slated for an absolute battle with the
Sooners.
Oklahoma, playing fora chance to con

tinue Regional action on its home court,
was one of the hottest teams in the nation
coming into the Tournament after a sur
prise Big 12 Tournament win. But that bat
tle never materialized. •
Stanford's defense absolutely dominat
ed and Powell was, once again, outstand
ing on the offensive end of the floor. Pow
ell finished with 23 points, 11 boards and
seven assists and the Cardinal allowed just
43 points to the usually balanced Sooners.
Thiel and Suminski absolutely shut
down Oklahoma's two top scores, guard
Maria Villaroel and forward Caton Hill.
Villaroel managed just eight points on 2-
of-11 shooting, while Hill had only nine.
Stanford will have a chance to advance
to the Final Four on Tuesday, when it will
face Tennessee for the second time this
season. The Lady Volunteers got the best
of the Cardinal in their December
matchup, winning an overtime thriller, 70-

NORMAN, Okla. —When the Stan
ford women's basketball team (29-6) re
ceived its draw from the NCAA Selection
Committee, things looked bleak. A No. 6
seed in the Midwest, where the Cardinal
would be lumped behind overall No. 1 seed
Tennessee, red-hot Oklahoma — many
pundits' dark horse pick to reach the Final
Four — and SEC Tournament Champ
Vanderbilt.
Stanford, however, played with a huge
chip on its shoulder and used the Selection
Committee's snub to advance to the Elite
Eight yesterday, defeating Vanderbilt in
the Sweet Sixteen, 57-55, on a three-point
er by junior Kelley Suminski with 0.3 sec
onds on the clock.
The Cardinal jumped out to a nine
point halftime lead behind the brilliant
first half play of Nicole Powell. Powell,
who had a double-double within 12 min
utes of tipoff, orchestrated the Stanford
offense to perfection.
Stanford broke down the Com
modores' patented matchup zone defense
with ease in the first 20 minutes, shooting
an astounding 61.9 percent from the field
in the first half, including 6-for-10 from
long range.
Powell finished the first half with 14
points, 11 rebounds and six assists, but what
may have been more important than the
All-American's stellar play was the ability
of her teammates to step up.
In the first half, junior forward T'Nae
Thiel and junior guard Sebnem Kimya
cioglu chipped in with six points apiece,
while Suminski had four.
In the second half, however, it seemed
as though an entirely different team took
the floor. The Cardinal shot just 26.9 per
cent from the floor in the second half on 7-
of-26 shooting.
Powell, who was 5-of-8 from the field in
the opening half, did not convert a single

field goal in the second half, going 0-of-8.
Additionally, the crowd turned on the
Cardinal squad — which had knocked out
hometown Oklahoma in the second round
— and on Powell in particular. After Pow
ell fouled freshman Dee Davis on a break
away and Davis did not immediately get
up, the crowd began to boo Powell on
every touch.
"In the second half it was just tough to
get open shots," Powell said. "I had a cou
ple of good looks I didn't knock down and
frankly, I made some awful turnovers. But
it's a team game."
Vanderbilt capitalized on the Stanford's
cold shooting — and fast. Within two min
utes of the start of the second half, the
Commodores cut the Cardinal's lead to just
three points, and with 16:24 remaining,
Vandermilt tied the ballgame on a Jenni
Benningfield layup.
"Vanderbilt was playing a lot more ag
gressively in the second half," said senior
center Chelsea Trotter, who chipped in
three points and two assists. "We had our
was in the first half, but they really stepped
it up a notch in the second half. The inten
sity level skyrocketed and fora while they
were dictating the pace of the game."
Despite its poor second-half shooting
performance, Stanford managed to stay in
the game with its defense. The Cardinal
held Vanderbilt to 41.5 percent shooting on
the game and limited Benningfield, the
Commodores' All-America candidate to
11 points on 4-of-13 shooting.
Stanford also won the rebounding
battle, 33-28, which proved key, as it was
able to limit Vanderbilt's second chance
opportunities.
Despite the Cardinal's outstanding de
fense and rebounding, the Commodores
were able to build a 55-52 lead with just
2:37 on the clock.
And after 2:06 of scoreless ball by both
teams, Powell was able to work herself to
the line, drawing a foul on Hillary Hager.
