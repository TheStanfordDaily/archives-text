# Shakespeare in Asia leads to cultural exchange
## 
### ANTHONY HA MANAGING EDITOR 
A four-day event that will bring directors,
scholars and performers from across the globe to
explore the performance of William Shake
speare's plays in Asia begins Thursday.
"This is going to be a public educational event,
in which all the people involved will be learning,"
said English Prof. Patricia Parker, one of Shake

speare in Asia's primary organizers.
Parker said that she spent many years as a
Shakespeare scholar unaware of Shakespeare
performance in Asia, until one of her students
wrote a senior honors thesis on Shakespeare
in Taiwan.
"Now I have directed dissertations and senior
honors theses on international Shakespeare —
not just in Asia, but Eastern Europe, particularly
in relation to the politics of performing certain

i plays, and eise
j where."
Parker said
! that she is excited
• by "a dynamic in
teraction with
Shakespeare and
different cultures
... In the older
Anglophone no
tion of Shake
speare, the West
Coast is on the
periphery. But in
the new interna
tional scene,
we're right in the
middle."
The event
also coincides
with the launch of
the Shakespeare
in Asia Web site
(http://sia.stan
ford.edu) which
organizers hope
will become a
major gateway
site and interna
tional Shake
speare resource.
Many of the
conference's
highlights will
focus on artists
whose work
brings together
different cultures.

— artistic direc
tor of Theatre-
Works in Singa
pore — will dis
cuss and show
Y video recordings

of his work this Friday at 7:30 p.m. Noriyuki Sawa
will perform Shakespeare puppet theater on Sat
urday at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. in Pigott Theater. Film
producer Ismail Merchant of Merchant Ivory Pro
ductions will discuss his life and work at 7 p.m. on
Sunday in Kresge Auditorium, followed by a
screening of his film "Shakespeare Wallah."
According to Parker, all of the events will in
clude visual materials. She noted that many of the
productions that will be discussed at Shakespeare
in Asia are "visually striking" and "an extraordi
nary experience."
She added, "Because the stories are so famil
iar, audiences should still be able to enjoy the pro
ductions even if they don't have the language."
Shakespeare in Asia will also feature the Bay
Area premiere of "Maqbool" — an Indian adap
tation of "Macbeth" — at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium.
The materials collected for the event have re
sulted in what Parker calls a "one-of-a-kind" col
lection of performance videos, which will be do
nated to Stanford's special collections. She said
that preparing for the event has benefited the Uni
versity in other ways.
"Through the two years I've spent organizing
this project, I haven't just been organizing this
event," Parker said. "I've also been making inter
national contacts that have already started to ben
efit Stanford undergraduates. We want to create
and expand networks that will go both ways."
Parker noted that through her contact with
Prof. Shen Lin of the Beijing Dramatic Academy,
junior Ross Perlin was able to live with Prof. Lin
and perform research in China last fall.
"The goal is to make Stanford a Shakespeare
center for international intercultural research and
exchange," Perlin said.
Parker explained that the study of Shake
speare from an international perspective can en
rich the understanding of his work.
"If we just know English, it impoverishes our
sense to understand Shakespeare's English, which
was multilingual," she said.
According to Parker, for many years English
scholars were unaware that the character lago from
"Othello" had a Spanish name, that of the saint in
whose name the Moors were driven out of Spain.
"A lot of this work is open to all students across
the fuzzy/techie divide," Parker said. "That's why
the Web site was so much fun."
"My dream is that the Web site becomes a
major state-of-the-art distance learning tool, but
that sort of thing would require major funding,"
Parker said.

productions that will be discussed at Shakespeare
in Asia are "visually striking" and "an extraordi
nary experience."
She added, "Because the stories are so famil
iar, audiences should still be able to enjoy the pro
ductions even if they don't have the language."
Shakespeare in Asia will also feature the Bay
Area premiere of "Maqbool" — an Indian adap
tation of "Macbeth" — at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday in
Memorial Auditorium.
The materials collected for the event have re
sulted in what Parker calls a "one-of-a-kind" col
lection of performance videos, which will be do
nated to Stanford's special collections. She said
that preparing for the event has benefited the Uni
versity in other ways.
"Through the two years I've spent organizing
this project, I haven't just been organizing this
event," Parker said. "I've also been making inter
national contacts that have already started to ben
efit Stanford undergraduates. We want to create
and expand networks that will go both ways."
Parker noted that through her contact with
Prof. Shen Lin of the Beijing Dramatic Academy,
junior Ross Perlin was able to live with Prof. Lin
and perform research in China last fall.
"The goal is to make Stanford a Shakespeare
center for international intercultural research and
exchange," Perlin said.
Parker explained that the study of Shake
speare from an international perspective can en
rich the understanding of his work.
"If we just know English, it impoverishes our
sense to understand Shakespeare's English, which
was multilingual," she said.
According to Parker, for many years English
scholars were unaware that the character lago from
"Othello" had a Spanish name, that of the saint in
whose name the Moors were driven out of Spain.
"A lot of this work is open to all students across
the fuzzy/techie divide," Parker said. "That's why
the Web site was so much fun."
"My dream is that the Web site becomes a
major state-of-the-art distance learning tool, but
that sort of thing would require major funding,"
Parker said.
