# Fee changes felt from Club Sports to KZSU

Though many students remain baffled by the complicated issue of
special-fees funding, the effects of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
recent decision to slash the proposed budgets of many student groups
is already being felt across campus.
In the wake of the special-fees votes last month and this month, stu
dent groups have been scrambling to reassess their budgets and to cir
culate petitions that would allow them to regain a place on the special
fees ballot for the spring election.
Petitions were so prevalent during dead and finals weeks — hand
ed out in dining halls, posted on bulletin boards and passed door to
door in residences — that most students were asked to sign more than
one. The largest burden fell on those student group members who
were assigned to collect signatures.
Freshman Jarret Guajardo, a member of the Stanford Equestrian
Team, was asked to collect signatures on behalf of Club Sports, which
had its budget proposal reduced from $200,629 to $156,897 by the Sen
ate.
"I don't have the time during finals week to go out and collect sig
natures, especially because we were supposed get graduate signa
tures," Guajardo said. "I would have to hunt them down."
Another group that was hit particularly hard by the Senate vote was
KZSU, which will stop broadcasting away games starting next year if
its funding is cut, according to junior Jordi Mata-Fink, the station's co
sports director.
Mata-Fink said that if KZSU does not receive money for road trav
el, the coverage of at least eight sports will be affected next year, in
cluding football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's
soccer, women's volleyball, Softball and baseball.
Currently, KZSU broadcasts around 210 games during the school
year, but that number could be drastically reduced as a result of the
Senate's decision.
"This is disappointing on several levels," said sophomore Sean
Bruich who covers baseball for KZSU. "First, it's a neat thing to be
able to travel with the team, to see some other schools and to have an
opportunity to gain that experience of broadcasting on the road. But
it is also frustrating because I know that much of our audience,
whether it is friends, professors or parents, relies on us to bring them
away games."
According to KZSU financial manager Orges Beqiri, a junior, the
station's budget was cut by about $23,000, with most of that figure
coming from the sports department.
"The ASSU rationale this year was to cut all special-fees funding
that was meant for travel use because all activities taking place off
campus benefited only a very, very small portion of the campus popu
lation," Beqiri said. "Their mistake was in applying this standard,
blindly, across the board, to all groups. KZSU sends broadcasters
