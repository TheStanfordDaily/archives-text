# Fee changes felt from Club Sports to KZSU

### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though many students remain baffled by the complicated issue of
special-fees funding, the effects of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate's
recent decision to slash the proposed budgets of many student groups
is already being felt across campus.
In the wake of the special-fees votes last month and this month, stu
dent groups have been scrambling to reassess their budgets and to cir
culate petitions that would allow them to regain a place on the special
fees ballot for the spring election.
Petitions were so prevalent during dead and finals weeks — hand
ed out in dining halls, posted on bulletin boards and passed door to
door in residences — that most students were asked to sign more than
one. The largest burden fell on those student group members who
were assigned to collect signatures.
Freshman Jarret Guajardo, a member of the Stanford Equestrian
Team, was asked to collect signatures on behalf of Club Sports, which
had its budget proposal reduced from $200,629 to $156,897 by the Sen
ate.
"I don't have the time during finals week to go out and collect sig
natures, especially because we were supposed get graduate signa
tures," Guajardo said. "I would have to hunt them down."
Another group that was hit particularly hard by the Senate vote was
KZSU, which will stop broadcasting away games starting next year if
its funding is cut, according to junior Jordi Mata-Fink, the station's co
sports director.
Mata-Fink said that if KZSU does not receive money for road trav
el, the coverage of at least eight sports will be affected next year, in
cluding football, men's and women's basketball, men's and women's
soccer, women's volleyball, Softball and baseball.
Currently, KZSU broadcasts around 210 games during the school
year, but that number could be drastically reduced as a result of the
Senate's decision.
"This is disappointing on several levels," said sophomore Sean
Bruich who covers baseball for KZSU. "First, it's a neat thing to be
able to travel with the team, to see some other schools and to have an
opportunity to gain that experience of broadcasting on the road. But
it is also frustrating because I know that much of our audience,
whether it is friends, professors or parents, relies on us to bring them
away games."
According to KZSU financial manager Orges Beqiri, a junior, the
station's budget was cut by about $23,000, with most of that figure
coming from the sports department.
"The ASSU rationale this year was to cut all special-fees funding
that was meant for travel use because all activities taking place off
campus benefited only a very, very small portion of the campus popu
lation," Beqiri said. "Their mistake was in applying this standard,
blindly, across the board, to all groups. KZSU sends broadcasters
broadcasters away from campus so
they can bring Stanford sports "to cam
pus."'
ASSU Senator Chris Lin, a junior,
said groups that disagreed with their
approved budgets or groups that were
rejected for balanced placement alto
gether could demonstrate support
from the student body through the pe
tition process. A group must obtain
signatures from 15 percent of the un
dergraduate or graduate student bod
ies in order to be placed on their re
spective ballots in the spring.
(iroups have criticized the petition
ing process as a form of pointless red
tape, since students rarely decline to
give their signature, but Lin says the
process works.
"While it is true that some students
will sign any petition that comes their
wav. especially if it is their friend re

questing the signature, petitioning
nevertheless requires a substantial
amount of organization, and more im
portantly, student interest in that
group." Lin said.
The ballot vote is also being criti
cized from within the Senate. Senator
Dylan Mefford. a junior, broke with
many of his colleagues by registering
his disapproval of the special-fees
arrangement.
"It is arrogant for the ASSU to tell
student groups that they should cut
their budgets when the members of
the ASSU don't understand the diffi
culties of fundraising to fill budget
shortfalls, or the importance of the
funding for the groups," Mefford said.
"I trust student groups to ask for rea
sonable amounts. Their original bud
gets showed that they did so."
Mefford is running this spring to be
the ASSU vice president.
For now. KZSU is trying to regain
its original budget through the peti
tion process.
Because of complaints about the
timing of the petition deadline during
finals week, the Senate extended the

deadline to Tuesday. March 30.
The station is also continuing to
seek outside funding, though it is espe
cially difficult because as a non-com
mercial station. KZSU cannot have
advertising on the air.
Instead. KZSU obtains funds from
businesses through underwriting,
which means that businesses can do
nate money to the station and have
their donation recognized during
broadcasts.
Finally, the station is trying to
arrange funding from the Athletic De
partment, although Nlata-Fink says
that like many departments at Stan
ford. the Athletic Department is al
ready strapped for money.
For Beqiri. this means more time
spent trying to avert the painful reali
ties of the special-fees crisis.
"The ASSU special-fees application
process gets tougher and tougher each
year." he said. "Every time through,
there's more paperwork to be filled
out. more rules to keep in mind, more
committees to meet with, more manda
tory meetings to attend and so forth.
Frankly, it's a little ridiculous."
