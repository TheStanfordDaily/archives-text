## Volunteer for vets Stanford-based organization goes national 
### ERIK HOPE 
The Stanford chapter of
United Students for Veter
ans' Health (USVH), one of
the largest service organiza
tions on campus, is celebrat
ing its tenth anniversary
this spring.
Founded in 1994, USVH
serves the social needs of
geriatric and psychiatric pa
tients at the Menlo Park Vet
erans' Administration (VA)
Hospital. Each of the organi
zation's approximately 60
volunteers spends two hours
every week interacting and
building relationships with
veterans who otherwise
would not get the attention
they need.
The organization has built
an excellent record of service
to veterans and has received
letters of commendation from
former California governor
Pete Wilson and former presi
dent Ronald Reagan.
Vance Vanier, Class of '95,
founded the organization in
1994 after a visit to the
Alzheimer's Ward at the
Menlo Park VA Hospital,
where he felt that many of the
patients were lonely and suf
fering because they did not
have anyone to interact with.
Vanier realized that the
helpful but undersized staff at
the hospital was unable to
meet all of the veterans'
needs, and so he founded the
first chapter of USVH at Stan
ford to ensure that the veter
ans would not feel lonely or re
jected, according to junior
Manisha Bahl, the current
Stanford director of USVH.
The organization began
with 40 students who were
willing to volunteer their
time to brighten the lives of
lonely veterans at the hospi
tal. At one point, USVH had

over ten active chapters, and
there are currently chapters
working with local Veterans'
hospitals at Dartmouth Col
lege, Oregon Episcopal
School, UC-San Diego and
West Point. The Stanford
chapter is the national head
quarters, and a nationwide
project to open new chapters
is underway.
The experience of working
with veterans suffering from
psychiatric illnesses is both ex
tremely difficult and reward
ing for volunteers. Many of the
veterans are unable to commu
nicate orally, so holding con
versations with them and find
ing activities that they enjoy is
a challenge.
"When I first began volun
teering at the VA Hospital, I
found it very challenging and
frustrating," Bahl said. "But,
as I continued, I began devel
oping meaningful relation
ships with the veterans I visit
ed. Now, spending time at the
VA has become part of my
life. I never return from the
VA without a new take on life
and a new experience to
share with others."
Volunteers who wish to
work for USVH must first
apply and commit to volun
teering two hours a week. In
all, USVH volunteers collec
tively contribute about 1,000
hours of community service
per quarter.
For those who choose to
volunteer, the time commit
ment is well worth it. Student
volunteers find that the experi
ence of spending time with vet
erans is personally rewarding,
in addition to being helpful to
the veterans.
"Having the opportunity to
volunteer with those who have
served so bravely is a heart
warming and enlightening ex
perience," said junior Jason

Horn, direc
tor of volun
teering.
Describ
ing her expe
riences at
the Veter
ans' Hospi
tal, Director
of National
Recruitment
senior Kristin
Primus said,
"I've had
some of the
most mean
ingful con
versations of
my life at the
Veterans'
Hospital."
As part of
its service to
veterans,
USVH also
organizes
special group
events such

as crafts days, talent shows and
music days for the veterans. Stu
dent volunteers perform music,
and the organization has also
brought a number of Stanford a
cappella groups to the hospital
to perform.
Recently, USVH co-spon
sored a charity bowling tour
nament with the Delta
Kappa Epsilon fraternity
that raised over $1,000 for
the Menlo Park VA, The
event was a success and in
volved over 100 Stanford stu
dents, according to junior
Kenny Gundle, national di
rector of USVH. The organi
zation is currently planning a
carnival to be held at the
Menlo Park VA for students
from Stanford and other
local schools.
Through its efforts, UVSH
is able to help not only the sur
rounding veterans' communi
ty, but also the greater commu
nity at large. Last summer, with
the help of VA Volunteer Ser
vices, the Stanford chapter of
USVH published a collection
of essays and photographs enti
tled "Living Memories. Reflec
tions of Students Volunteering
in VA Hospitals."
Written and created en
tirely by Stanford students,
the book allowed volunteers
to share their experiences
working with veterans.
Vanier came up with the
idea, and his younger brother
Andre, a JD / MBA joint-de
gree student and current na
tional adviser to USVH
worked on the editorial
board. The book is available
nationwide and has helped
inform people across the
country about veterans'
health issues.
USVH's national program
also allows students opportu
nities to do more than volun
teer. In an effort to spread

awareness about volunteer
ing, Gundle, along with
Horn, recently participated
in filming a video called "A
Million Reasons to Volun
teer," for which they both re
cently received awards in
Washington. D.C.
The national focus of the
organization allows USVH to
help many more veterans
than if it were just a local
Stanford student group, Gun
dle said.
"Expanding USVH na
tionally has allowed more
and more students to get in
volved in volunteering with
the underserved veteran pop
ulation," he said.
As the influence of USVH
has spread, so has the contri
bution of volunteers.
"In the last 10 years approx
imately 1,000 USVH volun
teers have contributed close to
20,000 hours of their time visit
ing hospitalized veterans at the
Menlo Park VA and veterans
hospitals across America,"
Andre Vanier said.
All of those hours represent
times that student volunteers
were able to brighten veterans'
lives while learning from their
rich life experiences.
USVH continues to seek
new schools to open chapters
at and new venues to spread
its message about the impor
tance of veterans' health is
sues. The organization will be
participating in the upcoming
Stanford Community Day on
April 4, and it is always open
to new members. With a con
tinued strong volunteer pres
ence, USVH will be able to
ensure that more veterans in
hospitals feel appreciated
rather than lonely.
