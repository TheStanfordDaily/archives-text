## The 						jobs of a university president, part I 
### PROF. GERHARD CASPER UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT EMERITUS 
Editor's Note: This column is the first of two columns by Prof Gerhard Casper, with the sec
ond part to run on Wednesday, Mar. 31.

From 1992 to 2000 I served as president of Stanford University. Students
often ask me: "What was the job like?"
Among the many things I learned as president was the fact that 1 had at
least nine jobs and that one of those nine jobs was a job that most everybody
in the country referred to as "college president." The other jobs were CEO
of a very substantial enterprise, trustee of a trust established in perpetuity, a
fundraiser, an educator, a public figure, a social worker and an entertainer.
The designation "college president" suggests a stereotypical nineteenth cen
tury image of somebody who walks around a small campus in a tweed jacket with
leather patches on his elbows to chat with faculty and students and admire the
fall colors. And, indeed, there were quite a few students who thought the only
thing I did in the summer was to get ready for the first football game of the fall.

Instead, the president of Stanford is primarily a "university" president with the responsibility
for teaching and research, academic clinical care and a dizzying number of academic programs.
Yet, it is true that, as far as public attention is concerned, the focus is mostly on the under
graduate side of universities. The "college" aspect of a university president's job makes itself
especially felt with respect to most "hot button" issues involving higher education, such as un
dergraduate admissions, curriculum, tuition levels and athletics.
The undergraduate experience in the United States, and in the United States only, signifi
cantly includes college athletics, especially football and basketball. For the president, this may
involve such high visibility issues as who will be the football coach — and on what terms — or
worrying about the so-called "friendly rivalry" between competing athletic teams that so easi
ly can turn distinctly hostile.
When I first arrived at Stanford, I was somewhat infamous for — perish the thought — not
caring about football. After all, I had come to Stanford from the University of Chicago, which
is known as a former member of the Big Ten. I was put in my place fairly promptly. When the
time came to pick the one person who had had the greatest impact on Stanford in the first year
of its second century. The Daily chose Bill Walsh who, at about the same time I had become
president, had returned to Stanford as the football coach.
"Bill Walsh has had more of an invigorating effect on campus than the University presi
dent," June Cohen, The Stanford Daily editor, told The New York Times. "Casper hasn't come
out with anything that's gotten people real riled up or real excited." she continued.
Secondly, the president is also the CEO of a major institution: In the case of Stanford, in my
last year as president, with expenditures in excess of $2.2 billion (including the University's hos
pitals), an endowment of almost $9 billion (before the downturn of the markets) and a vast
physical plant. The number of faculty was almost 1,700, the number of students in excess of
14,000 and the number of staff 9,000.
Under conditions that resemble "structured anarchy", the University president is, among
many other things, responsible for compliance with laws, regulations and rules that apply to in
dividuals and business corporations and then those that specifically address higher education.
Not a year goes by when the federal government (which has no substantive jurisdiction over
higher education) does not pass several laws or regulations to attend to some perceived or real
shortcoming of ours. I estimated, conservatively I should say, that at least 12.5 cents of every
tuition dollar went to regulatory costs.
The third job of a university president is being a trustee of a trust established in perpetuity.
One has fiduciary duties not only for the present but also the future in a setting in which many
incumbent faculty and students find it hard to understand why the University does not devote
its resources primarily to them given their many excellences, legitimate claims and clearly ar
ticulated preferences. Very important among the fiduciary duties are maintenance of the en
dowment and maintenance and improvements of the physical plant for future generations.
One fiduciary duty of the president is fundraising and what is called "development" more
generally. The thought and effort that go into these activities justify their characterization as a
separate, fourth job category.
What is fascinating with respect to fundraising is how many faculty and students seem to
take it for granted and assume that that is what one does 90 percent of one's time (one does
not). Some, occasionally, turn their assumption into accusations ("He is raising money from
alumni," as one student wrote about me in The Daily). I did indeed. I even worked hard to in
crease the participation level of seniors in the Senior Class gift. One of my proudest moments
as president came when the class of 2000 reached a participation of 74 percent (beating, I think,
every other university).

Prof. Gerhard Casper served as the University president from 1992-2000. He is also the Peter
and Helen Bing Professor in Undergraduate Education, a professor of law, a senior fellow at
the Institute for International Studies and a Professor of Political Science (by courtesy). He
earned his first law degree from the universities of Freiburg and Hamburg. He holds a Mas

cantly includes college athletics, especially football and basketball. For the president, this may
involve such high visibility issues as who will be the football coach — and on what terms — or
worrying about the so-called "friendly rivalry" between competing athletic teams that so easi
ly can turn distinctly hostile.
When I first arrived at Stanford, I was somewhat infamous for — perish the thought — not
caring about football. After all, I had come to Stanford from the University of Chicago, which
is known as a former member of the Big Ten. I was put in my place fairly promptly. When the
time came to pick the one person who had had the greatest impact on Stanford in the first year
of its second century. The Daily chose Bill Walsh who, at about the same time I had become
president, had returned to Stanford as the football coach.
"Bill Walsh has had more of an invigorating effect on campus than the University presi
dent," June Cohen, The Stanford Daily editor, told The New York Times. "Casper hasn't come
out with anything that's gotten people real riled up or real excited." she continued.
Secondly, the president is also the CEO of a major institution: In the case of Stanford, in my
last year as president, with expenditures in excess of $2.2 billion (including the University's hos
pitals), an endowment of almost $9 billion (before the downturn of the markets) and a vast
physical plant. The number of faculty was almost 1,700, the number of students in excess of
14,000 and the number of staff 9,000.
Under conditions that resemble "structured anarchy", the University president is, among
many other things, responsible for compliance with laws, regulations and rules that apply to in
dividuals and business corporations and then those that specifically address higher education.
Not a year goes by when the federal government (which has no substantive jurisdiction over
higher education) does not pass several laws or regulations to attend to some perceived or real
shortcoming of ours. I estimated, conservatively I should say, that at least 12.5 cents of every
tuition dollar went to regulatory costs.
The third job of a university president is being a trustee of a trust established in perpetuity.
One has fiduciary duties not only for the present but also the future in a setting in which many
incumbent faculty and students find it hard to understand why the University does not devote
its resources primarily to them given their many excellences, legitimate claims and clearly ar
ticulated preferences. Very important among the fiduciary duties are maintenance of the en
dowment and maintenance and improvements of the physical plant for future generations.
One fiduciary duty of the president is fundraising and what is called "development" more
generally. The thought and effort that go into these activities justify their characterization as a
separate, fourth job category.
What is fascinating with respect to fundraising is how many faculty and students seem to
take it for granted and assume that that is what one does 90 percent of one's time (one does
not). Some, occasionally, turn their assumption into accusations ("He is raising money from
alumni," as one student wrote about me in The Daily). I did indeed. I even worked hard to in
crease the participation level of seniors in the Senior Class gift. One of my proudest moments
as president came when the class of 2000 reached a participation of 74 percent (beating, I think,
every other university).

Editor's Note: This column is the first of two columns by Prof Gerhard Casper, with the sec
ond part to run on Wednesday, Mar. 31.

From 1992 to 2000 I served as president of Stanford University. Students
often ask me: "What was the job like?"
Among the many things I learned as president was the fact that 1 had at
least nine jobs and that one of those nine jobs was a job that most everybody
in the country referred to as "college president." The other jobs were CEO
of a very substantial enterprise, trustee of a trust established in perpetuity, a
fundraiser, an educator, a public figure, a social worker and an entertainer.
The designation "college president" suggests a stereotypical nineteenth cen
tury image of somebody who walks around a small campus in a tweed jacket with
leather patches on his elbows to chat with faculty and students and admire the
fall colors. And, indeed, there were quite a few students who thought the only
thing I did in the summer was to get ready for the first football game of the fall.

Instead, the president of Stanford is primarily a "university" president with the responsibility
for teaching and research, academic clinical care and a dizzying number of academic programs.
Yet, it is true that, as far as public attention is concerned, the focus is mostly on the under
graduate side of universities. The "college" aspect of a university president's job makes itself
especially felt with respect to most "hot button" issues involving higher education, such as un
dergraduate admissions, curriculum, tuition levels and athletics.
The undergraduate experience in the United States, and in the United States only, signifi
cantly includes college athletics, especially football and basketball. For the president, this may
involve such high visibility issues as who will be the football coach — and on what terms — or
worrying about the so-called "friendly rivalry" between competing athletic teams that so easi
ly can turn distinctly hostile.
