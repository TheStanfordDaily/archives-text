11 OA. Introduction to the Italian Renaissance
A study of the art of the Italian Renaissance through painting, sculpture, and architecture, from Florence,
Rome, Milan, and the Veneto. Focus is on genre; city squares, churches, chapels, palaces, and libraries;
and their painted and sculptural decoration such as altarpieces, narrative cycles, devotional painting, and
portraits.
Professor Evers, MW 4:15-5:30, ART 4
192A. The Arts of Africa
The art of black sub-Saharan African cultures such as ancient Nigeria and coastal and Sudanic Africa
including the Yoruba, Igbo, Dogon and Senufo. Artistic traditions within their social context and as myth,
ritual, music, dance, and world view.
Professor Reid, TTH 2:15-3:30, ART 4
206. Virginity and Power: Mary in the Middle Ages
The Virgin Mary has been the most influential female figure in Christianity whose state cult was intricate
ly connected with the idea of empire. Focus is on the production and control of images and relics of the
Virgin and the development of urban processions and court ceremonies through which political power
was legitimized in papal Rome, Byzantium, Carolingian and Ottonian Germany, lliscany, Gothic France,
and Russia.
Professor Pentcheva, T 3:15-5:05, ARTIO3
295A. Towards the Modern Museum
The display, storage, and classification of art from the early modern Kunstkammer to the postmodern
museum, focusing on shifting configurations, meanings, and functions of space. Topics include: ety
mologies and metaphors of the collection space including treasury, library, palace, temple, theater,
school, warehouse, supermarket and theme park; regulation of access; shifting conceptions of public and
private; dialogues between museums and commercial spaces; retrofitted and purpose-built museums;
boundaries between art and decoration; integration and segregation of media; open and closed storage;
and fixed and flexible le systems.
Professor Larkin, M 1:15-4:05, Cantor Art Center
457A. Feminist and Queer Art History, 1971-2001
Traces the development of a critical literature in feminist and gay/lesbian art history. Beginning with
foundational texts of the 1970s (Nochlin and Saslow), examines how art historians, critics, and curators
have addressed issues of gender and sexuality over the course of the last three decades. Approaches fem
inist and queer art history as distinct, though sometimes allied, fields of inquiry.
Professor Meyer, T 1:15-3:05, ARTIO3
507. Medieval Image Theory
The middle Ages saw the development of a theoretical framework on visual representation in response to
charges of idolatry. The defenders of religious images drew on the dogma of Incarnation; as the Virgin
gave human flesh to the Logos/Christ, the image offered a material manifestation of the divine. Focus is
on the change in perception and staging of the image. Early in the period, the icon or relic expressed
the presence of the sacred; later in the period, visual representation was designed to trigger an emotional
resnonse that led the view to a union with the divine.
Professor Pentcheva, TH 3:15-5:05, ARTIO3
