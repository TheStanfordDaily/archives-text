### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
announced yesterday that a total of 2,424 stu
dents have been admitted to the Class of 2008.
Letters were mailed yesterday to 1,621 admit
ted students who applied through the regular
review process. Follow-up letters have been

sent to the 803 students previously offered ad
mission under Stanford's single-choice early
action program.
Developers of online security software,
community peace advocates and a creator of a
spoken and written language are among the
prospective freshman of Stanford's Class of
2008. With 19,169 applications, an increase
from last year's 19,000, the entrance pool re

mained extremely competitive, with only 12.6
percent of applicants offered admission.
The acceptance rate increased from last
year's 12.1 percent, although it is still below
12.7 percent from two years ago. Given the
rise in early acceptances, the number of ad
mitted students has increased from last
year's 2,250. The change from early decision
to single-choice early action provided a no
ticeable difference in the number of appli
cants offered admittance during the early
process. For the Class of 2007, 597 admits
were offered spots during the early process,
while 803 admits were offered admittance for
next year's prospective freshman class, the
Class of 2008.
The number of regular decision accep
tances remained relatively constant with ad
mittance offered to 1,653 students in the regu
lar pool last year and 1,621 regular decision
applicants offered admittance this year.
In a press release, Dean of Admission and
Financial Aid Robin Mamlet noted that the
bar was once again raised for academic ex
cellence, with over 90 percent of admits
ranked in the top ten percent of their class
and over 80 percent having a CPA of above
4.0. She remarked that the applicants of
fered admittance displayed talents and acad
emic excitement that fit perfectly into the
Stanford community.
With the change in the early policy, this
year's Admit Weekend will play a large role in
helping make the decision for admitted stu
dents and their parents. Admit Weekend is set
to take place from April 22 to 24, providing
prospective freshmen with the opportunity to
explore the academic and social community
at Stanford.
