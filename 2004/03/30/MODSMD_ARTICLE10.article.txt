# Pollution causing mass extinction
## 
### TANIA ROJAS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you thought our basketball season was intense, get ready for
March Madness on a mass extinction scale. Right now, the score is
5-1, nature vs. humans.
By the time it takes for you to finish that econ problem set, sev
eral species may have become extinct. There's nothing new about
this, over 99 percent of the species that ever walked on Earth no
longer exist. As a tribute to Disney's new DVD, the Lion King, it's
the circle of life playing out before our eyes.
Paleontologists have hypothesized that five major extinctions
have occurred on Earth, each one responsible for the demise ef
thousands of species. Two recent studies appearing in the journal
Science, published by American Association for the Advancement
of Science, even go so far as to suggest that the world could be ex
periencing another mass extinction.

The catch is this one is slightly different.
It is not asteroids and colder temperature
shifts that are to blame but pollution. Industry
developments have depleted nitrogen — an es
sential nutritious source — from the soil, creat
ing a fissure in species' food webs. Scientists from
the United Kingdom's Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology found that the United Kingdom and
Central Europe may have already lost 20 percent
of their species to nitrogen deposition.
Even more frightening, according to a recent
issue of American Scientist magazine, is the fact

that species are becoming extinct at historical rates. The author of
the article, Dr. Donald A. Levin, a botany professor at the Univer
sity of Texas, claims that species extinction is occurring about 100-
1,000 times more than normal. At this rate, he calculated that on av
erage, species are becoming extinct every twenty minutes!
I wonder if any amount of technological progress and global ex
pansion is worth the loss of nearly half of our species in the next
hundred years.
Just last week, China announced its plan to launch a moon rover
in 2012, Japan's Toshiba Corporation earned a Guinness World
Record for creating the world's smallest disk drive (the size of a
stamp) and farmers in St. Louis, Mo., have pooled together to pro
duce the first ready-to-eat beef in a can. At the same time, scientists
from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii also announced
record-high carbon dioxide emission levels in the atmosphere.
Although not a direct consequence of the aforementioned
events, pollution is an inevitable byproduct of our progress. It seems
we plow the globe with our novelties in science, architecture, tech
nology, and too many other areas to list, at a cost, a very high cost.
As our population numbers and industrial developments escalate,
the living conditions of the Earth's flora and fauna simultaneously
decline. The question is, does our ability to splice DNA, land on the
moon and build impressive civilizations justify their destruction?
Perhaps it's no use quantifying the value of a macaque's habitat
with Mendelssohn's string symphonies. Our achievements surpass
the basic instinct of survival into a desire for commodities. Therein,
as Gandhi once quoted, many of man's struggles deal not with sat
isfying his needs, but his greed.
This is what sets us apart from other species, our ability to ex
ploit our surroundings by choice. The Greek pantheons, Roman
coliseums, Egyptian pyramids and even New York's skyscrapers
bear witness to a species that is quite capable of converting natural
resources and virgin land into almost anything. Now that we have
advanced farther than any other civilization on the technological
frontier, I think we have a duty to protect the environment from
further degradation.
Our current efforts to wash up the damage are notable, but they
are not as effective. For example, even after the establishment of
the Endangered Species Act in 1970 to protect threatened or en
dangered species, animals keep on dying. The Tecopa pupfish, the
blue pike and the Santa Barbara song sparrow are examples ;of
species that have gone extinct in the United States since then. Birds
in Kakamega Forest, Kenya's only rainforest, are dying long after
logging activities have stopped.
It is difficult to come up with feasible alternatives to our plane
tary woes. Curbing industrial expansion and reducing pollution
emissions isn't going to work unless we all work together. Make an
effort to be more conscientious about our environment and look
ahead. Our actions now, believe it or not, determine which species
will survive or forever disappear.
After the past five mass extinctions, scientists have noted re
markable jump backs in species diversity. There is still hope that
species can and will flourish. All it takes is assuming responsibility
for our advancements and respecting the right to live of all animals,
great and small.
For our current bout over mass extinctions, I wouldn't mind if
nature takes the crown.
