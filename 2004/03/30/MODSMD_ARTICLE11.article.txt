# A 						billionaire looks to the stars, funds new telescope
## 
### GEOFF KOCH STAFF WRITER 
NASA's Mars missions have garnered all the
headlines lately. But while the Spirit and Opportunity
rovers search for microscopic life on the Red Planet, the
Mountain View-based SETI, or Search for Extraterres
trial Institute, recently announced what may be the most
significant news in decades in the search for intelligent
life beyond Earth.
"This may change forever the way the world
makes radio telescopes," said Chris Chyba, Carl Sagan
chair of the SETI Institute and Stanford professor of ge
ology and environmental science.
Chyba was referring to the March 18 announce
ment by the SETI Institute and UC-Berkeley of plans to
build the world's newest and most powerful radio tele
scope, the Allen Telescope Array, or ATA.
The array is named for investor and philan
thropist Paul Allen. The Microsoft billionaire's $13.5 mil
lion donation will pay for the first two phases of a radio
telescope that will eventually comprise 350 6.1-meter
dishes in Hat Creek, a remote, "radio-quiet" region of
California 290 miles northeast of San Francisco.
Like other radio telescopes. Allen's dishes will
mine the depths of space for information about the den
sity of the early universe, the formation of stars and mag
netic fields in the interstellar medium. But the ATA will
also conduct round-the-clock scans for possible signals
from technologically advanced civilizations elsewhere in

the galaxy.
To understand why this is important, consider a
very brief history of SETI. In 1960, American as
tronomer Frank Drake used the National Radio Astron
omy Observatory in Green Bank, W. Va., to look for in
telligent life in our galactic neighborhood.
Drake's Project Ozma, named for the queen in
American writer L. Frank Baum's novels about the imag
inary land of Oz, aimed at two stars: Tau Ceti and Epsilon
Eridani, both about 11 light-years from Earth. He
searched six hours a day from April to July 1960. Besides
a tantalizing false alarm caused by a secret military ex
periment, no signals were detected.
The most ambitious recent SETI research. Pro
ject Phoenix, was a privately funded effort to scan 1,000
Sun-like stars for radio signals of intelligent origin. Noth
ing turned up, but researchers are quick to point out that
this number represents the tiniest fraction of the billions
of stars that might support life.
The recently concluded project took ten years
to complete, in part because Phoenix researchers had to
share time on existing radio telescopes with other scien
tists. For instance, the world's most famous radio tele
scope, the 1,000-foot dish at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, could
only spare three weeks of observing time per year for the
SETI effort.
ATA is different because, rather than a single
enormous dish or several large dishes, it will comprise
hundreds of small dishes capable of supporting several
research projects at the same time. The data collected

will be processed as much as possible by standard, off
the-shelf — and thus relatively inexpensive — hardware
and software.
According to the institutes Web site, Allen's
dishes "will increase SETI search speed by 300 times over
previous efforts and will achieve [its] goals at one-fifth
the cost of traditional radio telescopes of comparable col
lecting area and complexity."
The SETI Institute, which is funded by a unique
combination of public and private money, including gifts
from some of the Silicon Valleys' wealthiest companies,
does more than scan the dial for interstellar program
ming. In fact, Chyba, who directs the institutes Center for

the Study of Life
in the Universe,
often pursues re
search of a much
more terrestrial
concern.
At present,
Chyba has fund
ed research that
attempts to an
swer an age-old
question in biolo
gy: Is intelligence
merely an acci
dent of evolution
or does natural
selection lead

inexorably to smarter, bigger-brained animals.
Some claim that intelligence is a fluke and that
if you wound back the clock a hundred million years and
let biology evolve a second time, there is no guarantee
that an intelligent civilization of any kind would exist in
2004. Others point to characteristics such as the wing,
which appears to have evolved independently several
times in insects, birds and even mammals and fish.
"It's the kind of argument that goes on for an
eternity over beers,'" Chyba said.
But it is also the kind of argument that may yield
to a rigorous statistical analysis of the evolutionary histo
ry of some of our big-brained animal counterparts, such
as the toothed whales.
Of course the answer to the question bears di
rectly on the chances of Allen's dishes of ever picking up
anything more than static. If natural selection leads in
evitably to intelligence, then the universe might be teem
ing with broadcasts from advanced alien civilizations. If
intelligence is merely an accident, the Hat Creek facility
might be relegated to collecting information about inter
esting but more mundane matters such as star formation
and the like.
At least one thing seems clear. Despite the spec
tacular successes of the Mars rovers, NASA does not
have a monopoly on the pursuit of answers to two of as
tronomy's biggest questions. How did we get here? Are
we alone?
