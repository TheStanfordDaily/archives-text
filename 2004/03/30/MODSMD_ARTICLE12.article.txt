## Band sanctions are reasonable 
### 
The recent sanctions placed on the Band by
the Organizational Conduct Board are,
for the most part, both fair and well
thought-out. We applaud Dean of Stu
dents Greg Boardman's decision to take a multi
ple-pronged approach in reprimanding the Band.
The Band had clearly not learned its lesson from
past alcohol warnings, and another mere alert of
this level might have only produced similar re
sults. Therefore, the use of community service,
travel probation, leadership training and alcohol
and substance abuse programs, among other
things, represents a promising development in
University policy. Rather than automatically slap
ping groups with alcohol probation or suspension,
the University appears to be using other methods
to supplement these actions. These additional
methods stress education and service and are a
positive consequence to groups' misdeeds, in con
trast to the negative nature of probation / suspen
sion. They should prove beneficial to both the
Band and the University.
That said, however, we take issue with the
OCB's decision to place the Band on a three-year
suspension. Three years seems excessive for al
most any offense — and breaking equipment and
leaving vomit in a bus' bathroom does not seem to
us to warrant such a lengthy suspension. Admit
tedly, the larger issue here is underage alcohol
consumption, an offense for which the Band is no
torious. Perhaps the OCB hopes to reshape Band
culture by removing alcohol from the program,
thereby changing the association of the Band with
alcohol. This may or may not be effective (we tend
to think it will not work), but the primary problem
with this long suspension is that the University is
punishing three years' worth of future Band mem
bers who were not involved in the October inci
dent. Some of this fall's incoming freshmen will

turn 21 before the Band comes off suspension —
so even when of age, they will not be able to drink
at Band events / activities as a result of an incident
in which they had absolutely no part.
We do not deny that the Band should be
severely punished for its actions. The Band fool
ishly and openly flouted various University poli
cies— not to mention state law — last October.
Further, the Band came off alcohol probation just
last year. Despite its past punishments, Band
members continued to express contempt for Uni
versity rules.
Regardless of how one feels about the Univer
sity's Alcohol Policy, a group that is trying to
prove itself as worthy of University trust following
a suspension should not publicly participate in
drunken and rowdy behavior while traveling and
representing Stanford. Some may wonder why
Delta Delta Delta recently received only a one
year alcohol suspension for an incident that in
volved forced drinking that led to pledges passing
out and potentially being sexually assaulted — a
much more egregious offense. However, Tri-Delt
had shown prior to the May incident that it was a
model group, commended by the University. The
Band, meanwhile, has given the University cause
for concern in the recent past. So the OCB was
therefore justified in taking strong action against
the Band.
Three years' suspension, however, is too long.
The OCB should consider a form of parole being
offered to the Band if its behavior improves. We
believe the Band has shown since the October in
cident that it is serious about cleaning up its act. If
the Band continues with its efforts, it should be re
warded — and sooner than in three years. Effec
tive behavior molding always includes both sticks
and carrots, and we urge the OCB to consider this
when reviewing its sanctions on the Band.
