## Mikey's senior thesis on special fees 
### 
Special fees. You're going to
hear a hell of a lot about
them this week. Not in my
four years here have I seen
a situation like the one the ASSU is
currently facing. If you haven't
been reading The Daily, signed a
petition or paid attention to any
student group on campus, you
might not know what's going on
with special fees.
Let's look at the actual mecha
nism of the special-fees refund.
The first step for voluntary stu
dent organizations (VSOs) such
as MEChA, the Black Student
Union, Stanford American Indian
Organization and Asian Ameri
can Students' Association — as
well as the Stanford Concert Net
work, Barrio Assistance and, yes.
Club Sports — that are seeking
special fees is to get on the ballot.
That's the one on which you vote
for about 60 groups. To do this,
they need to meet with the ASSU
Appropriations Committee,
which, after looking at the
group's proposed budget, makes
its recommendations. The group
goes to get its petitions signed (if
it's an "old" VSO that was on a
previous year's ballot, it does not
have to go through the petition
process). After the appropriate
number of signatures is obtained,
the group goes before the Senate
or the Graduate Student Council
(GSC), which votes to recom
mend the group's placement on
the ballot — and has the option to
change the amount requested be
fore approving it. These two bod
ies also have the power to reject a
group's proposal. In the case
where a group's budget is
changed, the group can petition to
get back on the ballot with the
amount it originally asked for by
getting 15 percent of the popula
tion it is targeting (either under
graduate, graduate or both if it's a
joint-group fee) to sign its peti
tions. Thus, we had the petitions
from groups like Club Sports and
SCN circulating during finals
week last quarter.
Anyway, this is all a technical
preface. When the VSOs finally get
on the ballot, you'll get to vote yea
or nay on each of these groups' re
quests for funding. All it takes to
pass is a majority, and if the special
fees request passes, that group will
receive the voted-upon amount on
a quarterly basis the following year.
In comes the refund.
According to a press release
from ASSU President Nadiya
Figueroa and ASSU Financial
Manager Kyle Alisharan, the spe
cial-fees refund was first intro
duced to the Stanford student
body in 1971 by the "Child Care
Center," which sought to bolster
support for its special-fees request
by offering the refund as an option
— if you didn't want to give your
money to "Child Care Support,"
well, you could always just take
back your money after you voted
"yes" on the request.
The success of this idea led to
more groups offering the opportu
nity, and eventually, the ASSU in
cluded the special-fees refund in its
constitution: "Any member of the
Association shall be entitled to a
refund of at least the amount as
sessed in support of the entire, or
any portion of, any General or Spe
cial Fee. This amount shall be spec
ified in the collection schedule for
the Fees, and should be as close as
practical to the actual per capita
amount collected for the Fee in
question" (Article V, Section 4,
No. 1).
Any student thus has the right
to get a refund of all or part of the
fee they pay. This is the point
where a lot of the controversy
comes into play. We'll get to that
later. In the mean time, let's talk
about how a refund affects a stu
dent group. The $88 fee you saw on
your University bill includes an ad
ditional eight percent tacked on by
the ASSU to serve as a buffer
against refunds.
However, 2002-2003 brought a
jump in refunds from 6.56 percent
in the fall to 13.27 percent in the
winter and 17.25 percent in the
spring. This year saw the refund
rate at about 14 percent in the fall
and about 22 percent last quarter
— considerably exceeding the
eight percent provided for by the
ASSU as a buffer.
These increases were way be
yond what anyone expected. And

by anyone, I mean the ASSU exec
utive, the Senate and the GSC, the
financial manager and most of all,
the student groups. You see, spe
cial-fees funding is the only form of

funding fora stu
dent group
where there is a
risk of up to 100
percent of the
student body
taking back 100
percent of the
money upon
which it voted.
Let's look at all

the sources of funding fora VSO
(with some information from the
Office of Student Activities Web
site, located at http://osa.stan
ford.edu).
1) ASSU: There are two ways a
VSO can obtain funding with the
ASSU — through the ASSU gen
eral fee or through special fees.
a) The ASSU general fee:
There are three items that are on
the ballot under the title "general
fee": programming, community
service and publications. The total
amount of the general fee (a little
less than $300,000) is distributed by
the Senate Appropriations Com
mittee or the GSC's Funding Com
mittee to VSOs that are not receiv
ing special fees. The maximum
each of these non-special-fees
VSOs can receive in one fiscal year
is $6,000 (although recent legisla
tion has increased that number to
$8,000 for groups requesting
money from only the community
service portion).
b) Special fees: Logically,
if your VSO is requesting funds
that exceed $6,000, you'll ask for
special fees.
2) The Stanford Fund Partner
ship: The Stanford Fund offers
around $300,000 total to student
groups. VSOs earn this money by
staffing events, running random er
rands, but primarily through writ
ing Stanford Fund letters. The most
a student group can receive from
this source in one fiscal year is
$13,500.
3) Individual University depart
ments and offices: These might in
clude administrative departments
or even academic departments.
The amount that is annually given
by these departments is estimated
between $100,000-200,000.
4) On-campus fundraising: This
option has many more constraints
and rules attached to it, but it is the
way in which some groups fund
their activity (e.g. the Mendicants'
Valentine's Day serenades, which
help to fund studio time).
5) Off-campus fundraising:
There are almost too many con
straints on this option, making it
less attractive.
Where does this bring us?
We have a situation where more
students than in the past are request
ing refunds. This is hurting the spe
cial-fees VSOs, which rely on that
now-volatile funding for the operat
ing costs that they have budgeted for.
We get back to the point of con
troversy, which can be distilled
down to one issue — students get
ting their refunds.
Getting your refund. Is that so
bad? The constitution allows you
to. You're not involved in any
group's activities. You don't go to
any event put on by a VSO.
But wait. The campus wouldn't
be as diverse and as vibrant with
out most — if not all — of the
VSOs and their programming and
outreach. Let's look again at your
rights regarding special fees.
While we'd like to believe that the
structure to refund one's money is
in place to serve as a way to
protest against a group for ideo
logical disagreements, the princi
ple upon which the refund was
first introduced had nothing to do
with that. Limiting refunds only
to students who can demonstrate
that they disagree with a group's
ideology seems to make some
sense. Will this happen? It's a
possible solution.
Should you get your refund just
because you don't participate in a
group's activities? I personally
don't think so, and even though I
don't participate in activities of
quite a number of the special-fees
groups, I don't take my refund
back. If you could, do you think it's
right to take back money that goes
into research lab space if you don't
do research? If you could, would
you take back a portion of the

money that goes into paying a pro
fessor's salary if that professor
were not in your department?
So what's the long-term solution
to the volatility of the system?
Can it he found in lowering the
quarterly fee? Maybe, but that's
not really a long-term solution
and it leaves room fora lot of
variance. Setting a certain limit
on the amount charged or lower
ing the quarterly per-capita fee
assumes that the impact of such
an amount directly and almost
completely affects refund behav
ior. This may be an assumption
that is unfounded.
Can it be found in controlling
and reducing the number of spe
cial-fees groups on the ballot or
even cutting down their budgets
(only to have them reappear on the
ballot as requested after spending
their finals weeks collecting signa
tures fora petition)? Again, not
long-term.
The only long-term solution
is student knowledge of the sys
tem. Education. Transparency.
Accessibility.
Let's start by asking, do you
know what the ASSU does?
What about the apathetic kid
sitting across from you as you're
reading this? Does she know?
Hell, according to a Daily article
earlier this year ("Senate ad
dresses special fee problem; two
senators depart," Jan. 28), even
Jason Sinocruz — an ASSU Sen
ator — didn't know what the
ASSU does:
"Sinocruz explained that he was
unsure as to what the Senate ac
complished. i asked myself anoth
er question — if the Undergradu
ate Senate were to disappear from
Stanford, what would be the loss to
the campus?' he continued. 'Aside
from having a body to appropriate
funds to different student groups,
an aspect of Senate that I think is
crucially important, 1 could not
come up with any definite concrete
answers to my question." "
Do you know who any of the
special-fees groups are and what
they do? Do you know where to
find that information out? The
ASSU not only represents the 600
VSOs on campus, but it also repre
sents you and should naturally
serve as a liaison to both parties.
But can one access anything any
one is doing at anytime?
The ASSU Web site is not up
to-date, there are many dead links
and you can't even get the gov
erning documents through the
site. Did you know about the
ASSU's efforts in improving aca
demic advising? How about the
steps it has made in bettering the
cost-of-living situation? Do you
even know what situation I'm
talking about?
Before I start asking too many
questions, I'll put down a declara
tive statement:
If the student body is unaware of
how its money is being spent or
what its leadership is doing, and if
the student body does not even
have easy access to these things, the
ASSU should not be surprised
when the number of students re
questing refunds increases. Stu
dents don't know where their
money is going. They will not likely
just fork it over to the ASSU with
out discernment.
It's clear that the ASSU actual
ly does a lot of things. Most of
those things are done behind the
scenes. If you want to know what
your leadership is doing — or
thinking about or working on —
wouldn't you like to be able to
find out?
Transparency isn't all that
hard to achieve. Once members of
the student body are easily able to
find out what their leadership
does on a weekly (if not daily)
basis — and once students have
easy access to see where their
money is going — everyone will
have better perspective.
This will build community.
I his will build trust. Most impor
tantly, this will build understand
ing of all student groups and
their missions. This will eventu
ally solve special fees.
