## Spencer's back, but his bracket died in Berlin 
### 
I'm back, biatch. Just like Tyrone Will
ingham, I've made my triumphant re
turn to Stanford, ready to exude my
indelible spirit upon the populace. Oh,
it's good times, ladies and gentlemen, and
only the eternal California sunshine can
validate that.
But all is not right in the land of Jamba
Juice, chicken enchiladas, and stellar dental
hygiene. I'm still haunted, chilled to the
bone by a vision of an Armenian man in
Germany, the symbol of all that went
wrong on my spring break.
I'm in the heart of Berlin, clutching a
bottle of champagne as we walk back to
the Park Inn Hotel, a little honey of a
spot that makes your Soto double look
roomy. Alexanderplatz is the site in
question, populated by despondent
youth eerily resembling a combination
of grunge punks, Nazi leaders and

Martha Stewart. Wearing
nothing but ratty clothes,
scowls, and cleverly ac
cessorized spike-laden
necklaces, these kids
looked like they were a
couple of Nirvana albums
away from marrying
Courtney Love.
As an aside, if I'm Ger
man, known in large part

for being the cause of the largest mass
genocide ever known to man, then maybe,
and this is just a maybe, 1 put on a smile. I
mean, honestly, these people are the cold
est, harshest, and most threatening people
on the planet. I'd walk past the punks'
hangout and the little bastards would
heckle me in German. I mean, I had no
idea what they were saying, but it didn't
sound like they were asking me to the
prom, if you know what I mean. Maybe I
try to change the stereotype is all. Christ
on a cracker, have a heart.
But back to my vision. It's cold, and
Stanford is about to play Alabama in the
round of 32. After a failed effort the night
before, we have learned that no place in
Germany shows basketball on TV unless
"DIRK!" is playing, so 10 Stanford kids are
huddling in front of a bank of computers in
an Internet cafe, watching choppy video fil
ter in over http://www.finalfour.com.
We've attracted the attention of the
cafe owner, Vardan, a cheery Armenian
man who would give me both his phone
numbers by the end of the night in a mo
ment where the language barrier kept
me from ever understanding his true in
tentions. He hasn't the foggiest idea of
what we're watching, why we're watch
ing it or why all the players freeze simul
taneously (you have a crappy Internet
connection, V-man), but he is enjoying
himself like a true G.
And at first, my vision looks good. We're
up by double digits, playing our game, mak
ing it almost seem as if the $10 we spent for
the video, just to make sure we wouldn't
lose, wasn't necessary after all. We would
go on to the next round. We would make
the Final Four. We would do it all.
And just as it looked like we had it,
Vardan had to go and ruin it all. He had
no idea what he was doing, or the conse
quences of his action, but after he
brought out a bottle of champagne for
us with 12 minutes left in the second
half, it was all over.
Oh, Vardan.
And before you could say "undefeat
ed," "East Coast Bias" or "One Shining
Moment," Josh Childress was watching
from the sidelines as Grunfeld missed a
last-second three to close the game. The
season, the tournament, the dream,
was over.
And you know, you could rationalize
it with a lot of things. That Alabama had
the toughest strength of schedule in the
country, masking their mediocre 18-12
record entering the tourney. That the
Seattle crowd was as much a disadvan
tage for us as playing in Montgomery
(Alabama, not Mike, although that
would be a sight to behold), what with
Gonzaga and Washington fans booing us
to claim West Coast superiority. Or that
we just didn't close out the game when
we had the chance.
But in the end, my bracket was truly
busted. I literally chewed up the folded,
tearstained paper, spitting it out as I
passed the Kurt Cobains-in-training for
the last time. The Zags would not make
the Final Four, St. Joseph's would live
another day and Stanford would not
beat Duke in the final game, a rematch
of the 2000 game that inspired me to
come to this school.
But life goes on, the sun still shines, and
next year's tournament is only a season
away. Maybe I'll call up Vardan to watch it
with me. Then again, maybe not.

Spencer Porter, a junior, may have re
turned from Europe, but he's still writing
