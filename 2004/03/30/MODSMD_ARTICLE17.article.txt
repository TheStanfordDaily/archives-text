# Card faces Lady Vols in Elite Eight
## 
### EMILY KUEHLER DESK EDITOR 
First, they rolled over No. 3 seed
Oklahoma to advance to the Sweet
Sixteen. On Sunday, they needed a
buzzer-beater to squeak by No. 2
Vanderbilt. Tonight at 6 p.m., the
sixth-seeded Stanford women's bas
ketball team (27-6) will face overall
No. 1 Tennessee (29-3) in the Cardi
nal women's first Elite Eight appear
ance since 1997.
Tonight's meeting will be the
second of the season between the
two teams, with the Lady Vols tak
ing the first matchup, 70-66, in an
overtime thriller.
While Stanford needed a trey by
junior guard Kelley Suminski with
0.3 seconds remaining to get past the
Commodores, Tennessee got past
fourth-seeded Baylor on what will
undoubtedly go down as the most
controversial call of the tournament.
With the score tied at 69, Ten
nessee forward Shyra Ely intercept
ed a Baylor pass, but missed a wide
open layup. Lady Vols guard Tasha
Butts and Bears guard Jessika Strat
ton went for the loose ball and, on
what appeared to be incidental con
tact, the referees whistled a foul on
Stratton, putting Butts on the line
with 0.2 seconds on the clock. Butts
converted both free throws, giving
Tennessee the win.
Both in Sunday night's win and
their early season victor)', the Lady

Vols displayed their uncanny ability
to pull away when the pressure is on
and win the close games.
In its six games this season that
have been decided by six points
or fewer, Tennessee has dropped
just one — a 66-68 overtime loss
to Georgia in the SEC Tourna
ment semifinals.
The Cardinal has played nine
games decided by six points or fewer
and has come out on the short end of
the stick on four occasions.
However, after struggling in
close games at the beginning of the
season, Stanford lately seems to
have found a way to perform when
it counts.
After senior Nicole Powell's win
ning baseline jumper to lift the Car
dinal over Oregon State in late
February, Stanford has not dropped
a game and four of those seven wins
have come by five points or fewer.
"We've been in a lot of situations
and dealt with a lot of adversity this
year," said Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer. "I think it's
helped us a lot that we've been in
close games this year."
Because of the familiarity the two
teams have with each other, the key
to the contest may be late-game exe
cution — something the Cardinal
struggled with in the two teams' first
matchup, on Dec. 14 of last year.
After holding Tennessee to just
18 points in the first half on a paltry
23.5 percent shooting, the Cardinal

went into the locker room with a
nine-point advantage.
After a truly amazing first half
in which Nicole Powell could do no
wrong, Tennessee head coach Pat
Summitt made a brilliant defensive
move, putting the 6-foot-5, but sur
prisingly mobile Ashley Robinson
on Powell. The combination of fa
tigue and Robinson's suffocating
defense worked wonders for the
Lady Vols as Powell missed 10 con
secutive shots during one stretch of
the game.
The tide truly turned when La-
Toya Davis picked Kelley Sumins
ki's pocket as she was bringing the
ball upcourt with 20 seconds remain
ing in regulation. Davis's steal led to
a fastbreak layup and, more impor
tantly, a tie game.
After Davis's steal, the Lady Vols
took control of the game and were
able to pull away in overtime.
And while the teams are ex
tremely familiar with one another,
each will be presenting different
looks tonight.
Tennessee will be without start
ing point guard Loree Moore, who
went down with a torn ACL in the
Lady Vols' win over Duke. Moore's
absence presents Tennessee with
difficulty handling the ball, but
Tasha Butts has stepped up well for
them, including a 37-point outing
against Vanderbilt.
