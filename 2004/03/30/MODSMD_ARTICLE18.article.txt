# Gentry makes history at NCAAs
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The stakes were higher and the stage
grander, but for Stanford junior Matt Gentry,
the outcome was plenty familiar.
With a late reversal, Gentry defeated
Ohio's Jake Percival 4-2 in the 157-pound
final at the NCAA Wrestling Championships
in St. Louis 10 days ago to dap an undefeated
season and become the first national champi
on in Stanford wrestling history.
"It's a great experience, quite an honor,"
Gentry said. "Stanford athletics is an amazing
program, and 1 feel grateful to be able to wres
tle for them."
Stanford head coach Steve Buddie, who
placed fourth at NCAAs as a junior in 1990
before taking the reins at his alma mater three
years ago, is equally grateful to have Gentry as
the cornerstone of a much improved program.
"When your program turns a corner, you
just know there is no turning back, Buddie
said. "This was that defining moment for
our program."
Gentry's magical run, coupled with the
performance of four other Stanford NCAA
qualifiers, catapulted the Cardinal into a top
-20 finish for just the third time in school his
tory. The strong performance at NCAAs
capped a year in which the Cardinal won 10
dual meets and went 6-2 in the Pacific-10
Conference during the regular season, just
one year after stumbling to a 3-12 record.
Still, Stanford knows there's a lot more work
to be done.
"The great thing about our program this
year is that we aren't a team that settles for
less than greatness," Buddie said. "No one
settles fora pat on the back ... The team
wants more and will do whatever it takes to
break into the top 10."
Gentry finished the season 42-0. bringing
his career win total to 109, which ties Buddie

for the most all-time in Stanford history. As
Gentry took to the mat in the final bout before
thousands of jubilant fans and several of his
teammates, Buddie watched intently and con
fidently from the side.
"Objectively, it was a close and exciting
match, but I just wasn't that nervous," Buddie
said. "This was his year, from beginning to
end, and 1 just knew that no one was going to
take that from him."
In the end, no one did take the title from
Gentry, but several tried.
As the second seed in the 157-pound
bracket. Gentry became the first Stanford
grappler to even advance to an NCAA title
bout with four wins over the first two days of
competition, including a thrilling 6-4 sud
den-victory over Michigan's Ryan Berlin,
the defending national champion, in the
semifinal bout.
Percival, who Gentry defeated 13-10 deci
sion in an exhibition match at the NWCA All-
Star Classic in early February, entered the
final bout with an unblemished 38-0 record
and was coming off a semifinal victory over
top-seeded and previously-unbeaten Alex
Tirapelle of Illinois.
But with 30 seconds left in the match and
Percival working on a minute of riding
time, Gentry turned a 2-2 tie into a 4-2 lead
with a reversal and held on for the win to
end Percival's perfect season while keeping
his own intact.
"I came into the match with a lot of
momentum," Gentry said. "Watching the
tape of the match, I was really surprised at
how relaxed I looked, but I stayed focused
and calm."
Stanford senior Brad Metzler, who Bud
die said is not expected to return for his final
season of eligibility, placed ninth at 141
pounds with a 3-2 record, including a 10-0
major decision victory over UNC-Greens
boro's Kevin Artis.

"(Brad's] been an anchor for this program
for four years, and it will be extremely hard to
see him leave," Buddie said.
Fellow senior Paul Gross saw his collegiate
career come to a close as well, but not before
he registered a couple more wins, including a
pin of lowa's Trent Goodale.
At 174 pounds, sophomore Imad Khar
bush lost to Penn's Matt Herrington, 7-2, be
fore being knocked out of the tournament by
Fullerton's Leonel Sanchez. Freshman Tan
ner Gardner, who won 23 matches this season
at 125 pounds, suffered two narrow defeats
but gained valuable tournament experience in
his first trip to NCAAs.
In the aftermath of the greatest
achievement in Stanford wrestling histo

ry, Gentry will turn his attention to de
fending his title. For his teammates, some
of whom were already in the weight room
lifting the next day, the attention turns to
putting in the work that could make them
the Cardinal's next national champions in
the near future.
"The greatest thing that I believe
comes from something like this is the fa
miliarity element," Buddie said. "Every
one on our team sees Matt train, they see
he is a vulnerable athlete just like anyone
else. They see his strengths, his training
pattern, his weaknesses, his work ethic,
basically, his humanity. And they know
now that they can accomplish this kind of
goal as well."
