The Stanford track and field program concluded a suc
cessful indoor campaign at the NCAA Indoor National
Championships on March 12-13 in Fayetteville, Ark. The
women's squad finished seventh overall at nationals, led by
four top-three finishes, while the men's squad was 19th on
the heels of junior lan Dobson's incredible performances.
The Stanford women opened on the first night of the
Championships with the 5,000-meter, in which redshirt
sophomore Alicia Craig finished second in 15 minutes,
45.08 seconds. Craig ran 13 seconds ahead of third place
and was the only finisher not lapped by Providence's Kim
Smith, who won in a collegiate record time of 15:14.18.
The women continued their hot streak in the distance
medley relay later that evening when the team of freshmen
Katy Trotter and Ashley Freeman, sophomore Chinny
Offor and junior Sara Bei finished second in 11:07.15.
Bei grabbed the baton in second place going into the
1,600-meter anchor leg. During her relay leg, Bei not only
held off UCLA's Lena Nilsson, one of the top middle dis
tance runners in the nation, but almost caught Tennessee's
Lindsay Hyatt, who had received the baton for the Lady
Vols nearly eight seconds before Bei.
Bei's unofficial split of 4:36 would place her among the
best indoor milers in the NCAA.
"I could see I was gaining on her, but I just ran out of
track," Bei said of trying to chase down Hyatt, who attend
ed Stanford before transferring to Tennessee this year for
graduate school.
"It's easy to look back on it and say, What if I had

gone sooner?' But I don't want to have any regrets
about the race because we were so blessed just to be
there," Bei continued.
Bei added another second-place finish for the Cardinal
the next evening in the women's 3,000-meter. Her time of
9:05.02 ranks third in the Stanford record books. She, like
Craig, finished second to Smith of Providence, who set her
second collegiate record of the Championships. Smith
toured the 200-meter banked track at Arkansas's Tyson
Stadium 15 times in only 8:49.18.
Smith's time broke the previous collegiate record, held
for 21 years by PattieSue Plummer of Stanford, by over
four seconds.
"After watching Alicia's race in the 5,000,1 realized that
it would be better to try to protect second place and hope
that [Kim Smith) would start to come back to us," Bei said.
"She is so strong right now. The times she is running are
very admirable."
The final stellar performance for the Cardinal women
came from senior Jillian Camarena in the shot put. Up
against the current collegiate record holder, North Caroli
na's Laura Gerraughty, Camarena finished a strong third
with a toss of 56 feet, 8.0 inches. Nebraska's Becky Briesch
finished just slightly ahead of Camarena with a toss of 56-
10.25 while Gerraughty broke her own collegiate record
with a toss of 62-10.
The women finished with 30 points, tied with Texas for
seventh while LSU narrowly edged Florida for the team
title, 52-51.
All six women who represented the Cardinal in Fayet
teville returned to the Farm with All-American honors.
"Overall, I feel we did an excellent job," said women's

head coach Edrick Floreal. "We had a few chances here
and there for more points, but I was very impressed. We re
sponded well and competed well in our events."
On the men sside, redshirt junior lan Dohson account
ed for all the points that landed the Cardinal 19th place in
the competition.
While all the pre-race publicity for the 5,000 focused on
reigning champion Alistair Cragg from Arkansas, reigning
NCAA cross country champion Dathan Ritzenhein of Col
orado and lona s Richard Kiplagat. Dobson quietly moved
up in the last lap to sneak into second place, just behind
Cragg, who successfully defended his crown.
Dobson s time of 13:40.91 was a Stanford record, best
ing the time run by Cardinal Olympian Brad Hauser.
To complete his weekend at the Championships, Dob
son added a second All-American honor, this time in the
3,000, by finishing fifth in 8:04.49.
Also in the 3,000, senior Don Sage gained the ninth All-
American title of his career by finishing 11 th in 8:16.18.
Louisiana State completed a historical sweep of the in
door national team titles when its men out-dueled Florida
to finish with 44.5 points to the Gators' 38.
The Cardinal now moves on to the outdoor season with
hopes of improving upon its performances during the in
door campaign. Many of the athletes on both the men's and
women s squads will also be looking toward July, when the
U.S. will hold its Olympic Trials for track and field.
Stanford is expected to produce several Olympians,
just as in 2000, only adding to the excitement that is al
ready brewing on the Farm as the squads look to earn
top marks and places in both the Pacific-10 Conference
and NCAA Championships.
