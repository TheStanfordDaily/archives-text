### MELANIE CORBETT 
Prominent Bay Area news analyst and scholar
Dr. Michael Krasny will speak on Thursday about
the relationship between politics, public policy,
public service and journalism. The event is being
organized by Stanford in Government (SIG) and
will take place at 7:30 p.m. in Room 002 of the His
tory Corner.
In addition to being a professor of English at
San Francisco State University since 1970. Krasny
has for over 10 years been the host and senior ed
itor of "Forum," the National Public Radio
(NPR) affiliate that airs every morning on San
Francisco's KQED. "Forum" focuses on news and
civic issues in the arts, culture, health, business
and technology.
On the show, Krasny mediates discussions
among various recognized personalities about
current events. He has interviewed numerous

chief newsmakers and public figures of the past
several decades, including former president
Jimmy Carter, Cesar Chavez. Noam Chomsky,
Nelson Mandela, Newt Gingrich and Rosa Parks.
Will Levi, the director of SlG's public policy
forum, said that although the show is only aired
locally, its scope is further reaching than one
might expect.
"The focus of Forum is not just on Bay Area is
sues, but also on those relevant to California, na
tional and international interests," he said.
According to Levi, Krasny's aptitude for
addressing such a diversity of topics appealed
to SIG, which seeks to provide speakers that
attract a range of people of various interests
and opinions.
"The ability to grapple with all these issues is
something we try to include in these on-campus
events, in order to give a well-rounded perspec
tive on public policy," Levi said.

Thursday's event featuring Krasny is the
kick-off for SlG's spring quarter speaker series
that focuses heavily on the upcoming presiden
tial election.
"He will address the election in general, as well
as factors influencing voter behavior," Levi said.
"Seeing as it is an election year, we hope to in
crease on-campus awareness and involvement."
SIG will be sponsoring an upcoming panel fo
cusing specifically on the election featuring
Stanford professors Morris Fiorina, David
Brady, Richard Brody, Shanto Iyengar and
James Fishkin.
SIG and the Public Policy Department are
also offering the speaker series entitled Current
Trends in Policy-Making this quarter. The se
ries will feature policy experts such as Coit
Blacker, Roger Noll, Stephen Krasner and
Terry Moe. The class will be from 6 to 8 p.m. on
Wednesday nights.
