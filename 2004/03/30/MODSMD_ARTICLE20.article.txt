# Softball plays nine in nine days, emerges as tournament champion
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most Stanford students,
spring break is the easiest seven
days they encounter between Jan
uary and June. However, for the
No. 12 Softball team (27-7), last
week was its busiest so far this sea
son, as it played nine games in nine
days — all at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium.
You won't find the Cardinal
complaining, though, after going
7-2 over the break, including
seven straight wins to close out
the week.
The Cardinal saved its most im
pressive victory for its last game of
the break, as senior ace Dana
"Lightning D" Sorensen no-hit
Hawaii Sunday afternoon en route
to a 1-0 Cardinal victory in the title
game of the Stanford Classic.
Despite a mediocre 17-17
record coming into the game,
Hawaii had an ace in the circle in
starting pitcher Melissa Coogan,
who had held the Cardinal to just
one run over seven strong innings
in the teams' first matchup of the
weekend, a hard-fought 1-0 Cardi
nal victory on Friday afternoon.
Friday's game had proved to be
a pitching duel between two aces,
with Sorensen eventually coming
out victorious by pitching a com
plete-game shutout victory in
which she recorded a season-high

15 strikeouts.
Sunday's game featured the
same Coogan-Sorensen pitching
matchup, but this time, both pitch
ers upped the ante. Coogan allowed
only one unearned run over six in
nings and Sorensen was nearly per
fect in hurling a no-hit victory.
Indeed, "Lightning D" left the
Wahine batters thunderstruck,
throwing 13 strikeouts and allow
ing only one baserunner (due to a
hit-by-pitch) as the Cardinal once
again eked out a 1-0 victory.
Sorensen was modest in the
wake of her fourth career no-hit
ter. Reflecting upon her perfor
mance, she said: "I've been feeling
good. Now that I've been throwing
more, I'm feeling comfortable."
Sorensen noted that injuries
had limited how much she had
been able to throw in preparing for
the season.
Cardinal head coach John
Rittman was optimistic after the
Cardinal's seventh straight victory
on Sunday.
"We finished strong," he said.
"We played in some very close
games this week. We made some
mistakes today, especially in our
baserunning, but those are things
we will work on."
The Cardinal endured the first
weekend of its nine-game home
stand with mixed results, earning 1-
1 splits against unranked UC-Santa
Barbara and Illinois-Chicago in the

Stanford Round Robin on March
20 and 21.
Neither the Gauchos (14-21)
nor the Flames (14-20) had win
ning records on the season, so
after losing both its Sunday
games, the Cardinal needed to re
group before facing No. 17 Fresno
State in a Wednesday double
header leading up to the Stanford
Classic March 26-28.
The Cardinal came out firing on
all cylinders against the 25-10 Bull
dogs, winning both games of
Wednesday's doubleheader, 3-2
and 7-0, respectively.
Sorensen pitched a complete
game, extra-innings victory in the
first game, and sophomore Laura
Severson and freshman Danika
Dukes combined fora shutout in
the nightcap.
Sophomore shortstop Lauren
Lappin slapped six hits in the dou
bleheader and drove in four Cardi
nal runs.
The Cardinal followed up its im
pressive showing against Fresno
State with five straight victories in
the Stanford Classic. In addition to
its twin 1-0 victories over Hawaii,
the Cardinal defeated Cal State-
Riverside, Illinois and Brigham
Young in the Stanford Classic.
Severson earned a complete
game victory in Friday's 3-1 deci
sion over Riverside, then Satur
day morning Sorensen dominat
ed Illinois en route to another

complete game shutout before
the Cardinal BYU 7-5
in Saturday's nightcap behind
three hits by junior first baseman
Liz Bendig.
Pitching was clearly the under
lying theme to the Cardinal's suc
cess over the last half of spring
break, and Rittman was quick to
point out the contributions of No. 2
starter Severson.
"Laura stepped up for us this
week. She got hit a little bit on Sat
urday, but she held her compo
sure," Rittman said."She's giving
us quality innings and quality
starts, giving us a chance to win
every time she's in the circle."
The Cardinal begins Pacific-JO
Conference play next weekend
against Oregon State and Oregon,
and over the next few weeks the
Cardinal will face a brutal confer
ence schedule featuring four top
-10 teams and seven top-25 teams
as opponents.
With Sorensen already in All-
American form, the Cardinal could
prove a force to be reckoned with
for the duration of the season, es
pecially if Severson remains con
sistent and big bats Lappin and
Catalina Morris continue to drive
in runs for the Cardinal.
Sorensen put the Cardinal's out
look in perspective after Sunday's
game: "This tournament was a good
step toward Pac-10 play. That's
when the real season begins."

Pitching was clearly the under
lying theme to the Cardinal's suc
cess over the last half of spring
break, and Rittman was quick to
point out the contributions of No. 2
starter Severson.
"Laura stepped up for us this
week. She got hit a little bit on Sat
urday, but she held her compo
sure," Rittman said."She's giving
us quality innings and quality
starts, giving us a chance to win
every time she's in the circle."
The Cardinal begins Pacific-JO
Conference play next weekend
against Oregon State and Oregon,
and over the next few weeks the
Cardinal will face a brutal confer
ence schedule featuring four top
-10 teams and seven top-25 teams
as opponents.
With Sorensen already in All-
American form, the Cardinal could
prove a force to be reckoned with
for the duration of the season, es
pecially if Severson remains con
sistent and big bats Lappin and
Catalina Morris continue to drive
in runs for the Cardinal.
Sorensen put the Cardinal's out
look in perspective after Sunday's
game: "This tournament was a good
step toward Pac-10 play. That's
when the real season begins."

The Cardinal Softball squad dropped only two of its nine spring break
games and won a tight 1 -0 matcnup for the tournament win at home.
For most Stanford students,
spring break is the easiest seven
days they encounter between Jan
uary and June. However, for the
No. 12 Softball team (27-7), last
week was its busiest so far this sea
son, as it played nine games in nine
days — all at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium.
You won't find the Cardinal
complaining, though, after going
7-2 over the break, including
seven straight wins to close out
the week.
The Cardinal saved its most im
pressive victory for its last game of
the break, as senior ace Dana
"Lightning D" Sorensen no-hit
Hawaii Sunday afternoon en route
to a 1-0 Cardinal victory in the title
game of the Stanford Classic.
Despite a mediocre 17-17
record coming into the game,
Hawaii had an ace in the circle in
starting pitcher Melissa Coogan,
who had held the Cardinal to just
one run over seven strong innings
in the teams' first matchup of the
weekend, a hard-fought 1-0 Cardi
nal victory on Friday afternoon.
Friday's game had proved to be
a pitching duel between two aces,
with Sorensen eventually coming
out victorious by pitching a com
plete-game shutout victory in
which she recorded a season-high

15 strikeouts.
Sunday's game featured the
same Coogan-Sorensen pitching
matchup, but this time, both pitch
ers upped the ante. Coogan allowed
only one unearned run over six in
nings and Sorensen was nearly per
fect in hurling a no-hit victory.
Indeed, "Lightning D" left the
Wahine batters thunderstruck,
throwing 13 strikeouts and allow
ing only one baserunner (due to a
hit-by-pitch) as the Cardinal once
again eked out a 1-0 victory.
Sorensen was modest in the
wake of her fourth career no-hit
ter. Reflecting upon her perfor
mance, she said: "I've been feeling
good. Now that I've been throwing
more, I'm feeling comfortable."
Sorensen noted that injuries
had limited how much she had
been able to throw in preparing for
the season.
Cardinal head coach John
Rittman was optimistic after the
Cardinal's seventh straight victory
on Sunday.
"We finished strong," he said.
"We played in some very close
games this week. We made some
mistakes today, especially in our
baserunning, but those are things
we will work on."
The Cardinal endured the first
weekend of its nine-game home
stand with mixed results, earning 1-
1 splits against unranked UC-Santa
Barbara and Illinois-Chicago in the

Stanford Round Robin on March
20 and 21.
Neither the Gauchos (14-21)
nor the Flames (14-20) had win
ning records on the season, so
after losing both its Sunday
games, the Cardinal needed to re
group before facing No. 17 Fresno
State in a Wednesday double
header leading up to the Stanford
Classic March 26-28.
The Cardinal came out firing on
all cylinders against the 25-10 Bull
dogs, winning both games of
Wednesday's doubleheader, 3-2
and 7-0, respectively.
Sorensen pitched a complete
game, extra-innings victory in the
first game, and sophomore Laura
Severson and freshman Danika
Dukes combined fora shutout in
the nightcap.
Sophomore shortstop Lauren
Lappin slapped six hits in the dou
bleheader and drove in four Cardi
nal runs.
The Cardinal followed up its im
pressive showing against Fresno
State with five straight victories in
the Stanford Classic. In addition to
its twin 1-0 victories over Hawaii,
the Cardinal defeated Cal State-
Riverside, Illinois and Brigham
Young in the Stanford Classic.
Severson earned a complete
game victory in Friday's 3-1 deci
sion over Riverside, then Satur
day morning Sorensen dominat
ed Illinois en route to another

complete game shutout before
the Cardinal BYU 7-5
in Saturday's nightcap behind
three hits by junior first baseman
Liz Bendig.
