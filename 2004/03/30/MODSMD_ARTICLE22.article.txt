# Card fights for playoff spot
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volley
ball team (8-13, 5-11 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation)
might not have had the most ex
otic spring break.
"We went to Palo Alto,"
joked junior outside hitter Pat
Bomhack. "We went to Chilis."
But staying on the Farm for
a hard week of practice proba
bly earned the Cardinal a play
off berth. Stanford defeated
UC-San Diego (7-15, 3-13) in
three games on Friday night be
fore falling to Long Beach State
(21-4, 14-3) on Saturday. And
though the Cardinal split its
matches over the weekend, Fri
day's win was crucial for Stan
ford's future play.
"We've got to beat the
teams we're fighting with for
the playoffs, so this was huge
for us," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We own the
tie-breaker over San Diego
and Irvine."
In spite of his jokes, prac

tice certainly paid off for
Bomhack, who led the team
Friday night with 13 kills and
on Saturday with seven. He hit
a stunning five for six kills in
game one against the Tritons,
while sophomore outside hit
ter William Clayton led with
six. Junior setter Kevin
Hansen closed game one on an
ace at 30-25.
Bomhack led the Cardi
nal's attack in game two, post
ing four kills en route to a 30-
27 win.
"Pat is becoming more of an
offensive threat for us, and we
need that," Shaw said.
In the third game, it was the
Cardinal's defense that made
the difference. Two consecu
tive blocks gave Stanford its
greatest lead of the night at 25-
16 and forced a UCSD time
out. The Cardinal would post
six stuffs before winning, 30-24.
"Our blocking didn't start
coming together until the tail
end of game two," Shaw said.
"Most impressive to me tonight
was our passing. [Hansen] is a

very dangerous setter when
you give him a good pass."
Bomhack agreed.
"We passed like champs
tonight," he said.
But it was a skill Stanford
couldn't seem to maintain. On
Saturday night, the Cardinal
struggled to pass the ball, par
ticularly in serve receive.
But Stanford came out
strong in game one against Long
Beach, holding a 19-15 lead until
the 49ers went on a three-point
run. After that, the Cardinal
couldn't pull away, going on to
lose, 30-27. According to Shaw,
dropping the lead was a turning
point in the match.
"We should have won the
first game," he said. "We win
that first game, we gain confi
dence [and] we have a chance
to build a match."
It was a loss the Cardinal
couldn't seem to recover from.
Both teams exchanged points
early on in game two, but Stan
ford couldn't handle the su
perb play of 49er senior out
side hitter Jeff Wootton, who

swung for nine of nine at
tempts in the game en route to
25 kills for the match. He also
registered four aces in game
two, though problems with
serve receive plagued the Car
dinal throughout the match.
"We didn't handle their
serve very well," Shaw said. "If
we don't pass, we don't give
ourselves a chance."
Long Beach went on a 9-4
run to close out game two, 30-22.
The 49ers rode their mo
mentum well into game three,
jumping out to a 15-3 lead in a
contest that included several
highly disputed calls and a yel
low card for Hansen. Stanford
tried to recover with a 7-3 run,
but it was too little, too late.
Long Beach closed out the
match at 30-19.
Stanford still has several
chances to improve its record
before tournament time. The
Cardinal will hit the road this
week, trying to avenge an earli
er loss to Cal State-Northridge
on Friday before facing UC-
Santa Barbara on Saturday.

matches over the weekend, Fri
day's win was crucial for Stan
ford's future play.
"We've got to beat the
teams we're fighting with for
the playoffs, so this was huge
for us," said Stanford head
coach Don Shaw. "We own the
tie-breaker over San Diego
and Irvine."
In spite of his jokes, prac

tice certainly paid off for
Bomhack, who led the team
Friday night with 13 kills and
on Saturday with seven. He hit
a stunning five for six kills in
game one against the Tritons,
while sophomore outside hit
ter William Clayton led with
six. Junior setter Kevin
Hansen closed game one on an
ace at 30-25.
Bomhack led the Cardi
nal's attack in game two, post
ing four kills en route to a 30-
27 win.
"Pat is becoming more of an
offensive threat for us, and we
need that," Shaw said.
In the third game, it was the
Cardinal's defense that made
the difference. Two consecu
tive blocks gave Stanford its
greatest lead of the night at 25-
16 and forced a UCSD time
out. The Cardinal would post
six stuffs before winning, 30-24.
"Our blocking didn't start
coming together until the tail
end of game two," Shaw said.
"Most impressive to me tonight
was our passing. [Hansen] is a

very dangerous setter when
you give him a good pass."
Bomhack agreed.
"We passed like champs
tonight," he said.
But it was a skill Stanford
couldn't seem to maintain. On
Saturday night, the Cardinal
struggled to pass the ball, par
ticularly in serve receive.
But Stanford came out
strong in game one against Long
Beach, holding a 19-15 lead until
the 49ers went on a three-point
run. After that, the Cardinal
couldn't pull away, going on to
lose, 30-27. According to Shaw,
dropping the lead was a turning
point in the match.
"We should have won the
first game," he said. "We win
that first game, we gain confi
dence [and] we have a chance
to build a match."
It was a loss the Cardinal
couldn't seem to recover from.
Both teams exchanged points
early on in game two, but Stan
ford couldn't handle the su
perb play of 49er senior out
side hitter Jeff Wootton, who

swung for nine of nine at
tempts in the game en route to
25 kills for the match. He also
registered four aces in game
two, though problems with
serve receive plagued the Car
dinal throughout the match.
"We didn't handle their
serve very well," Shaw said. "If
we don't pass, we don't give
ourselves a chance."
Long Beach went on a 9-4
run to close out game two, 30-22.
The 49ers rode their mo
mentum well into game three,
jumping out to a 15-3 lead in a
contest that included several
highly disputed calls and a yel
low card for Hansen. Stanford
tried to recover with a 7-3 run,
but it was too little, too late.
Long Beach closed out the
match at 30-19.
Stanford still has several
chances to improve its record
before tournament time. The
Cardinal will hit the road this
week, trying to avenge an earli
er loss to Cal State-Northridge
on Friday before facing UC-
Santa Barbara on Saturday.
