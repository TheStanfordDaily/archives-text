LONG ISLAND, N.Y. â€” Like the rest of the student
body, the Stanford men's swim team had its weeklong hiatus
from school last week. However, instead of tropical get
aways, snowy mountains, and crazy parties, the team had a
spring break filled with exciting swimming. The break
marked the coming ol the NCAA Swimming and Diving
Championships, which were held on Long Island last Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday.
With its No. 2 national ranking and an undefeated record,
the Cardinal brought high hopes into the three-day battle!
But in the end, the top-ranked Auburn Tigers came away
with the 2004 championship. Stanford finished second, ahead
ol rival Texas in what turned out to be one of the fastest
NCAA meets in recent history.
The first day of competition was the toughest for the Car
dinal, featuring a series of events that played to the strengths
of the Tigers. In the 200-meter freestyle relay, the Stanford
relay team of Ben Wildman-Tobriner, Peter Marshall, An
drew Schnell and Bobby O'Bryan took second place while
setting an American record in the event. In the 400-meter
freestyle, junior Jayme Cramer finished fifth, while fresh
man Shaun Phillips took 16th.
Although the 400 helped the Cardinal, the next two

events, the 200-meter individual medley and the 50-meter
freestyle, did not. In the 2001M, senior Markus Rogan start
ed off his stellar meet with a second-place finish in the event.
However, Auburn's George Bovell won the event in world
record fashion, while three additional Tigers placed in the
top eight. In the 50-meter free, Schnell placed seventh in his
first NCAA final appearance. Auburn's Fred Busquet won
with another world record and two other Auburn swimmers
placed in the top eight. At the end of the first day, the Cardi
nal faced a challenging deficit of nearly 100 points.
Day two of the championships looked better for the Cardi
nal. However, the finals session started roughly when the Stan
ford relay team was disqualified in the 200-meter medley relay.
Overcoming adversity, the Cardinal battled back, with junior
Matt McDonald and senior Peter Marshall finishing fifth and
seventh, respectively, in the 100-meter butterfly.
In the next event, Cramer won the 200-meter freestyle in
an extremely close race. The top six finishers were separat
ed by only 0.6 seconds.
The next event, the 100-meter backstroke, only carried
that momentum further. The event was one of the highlights
of the meet, featuring two-time defending champion Peter
Marshall, Rogan, and Texas star Aaron Peirsol. In one of the
most exciting races of the meet, Marshall defended his
crown, with his winning time of 50.32 setting a new world
record. Rogan finished second ahead of Peirsol. Although

the Cardinal performed well, Auburn's strength and the lost
relay were too much for the team to overcome, and their
deficit increased to nearly 200 points.
The third and final day of competition turned into a race
for second between Stanford and Texas. The final session
started off well for the Cardinal, as freshman Shaun Phillips
swam to a sixth-place finish in the 1500-meter freestyle.
In the 200-meter backstroke, Rogan, Marshall and freshman
Hong/Jie Sun placed 24-6 in a race won by Peirsol in world
record time. Rogan touched second, his third runner-up finish of
the meet. Gary Marshall continued his strong meet in the 200-
meter breastroke with a third-place finish, while senior Michael
Bruce ended his swimming career with a 16th-place finish.
In the final individual event of the meet, the 200-meter

butterfly, Cramer ended up on the other side of a close race.
After winning the 200-free by the slimmest of margins,
Cramer got second by 0.03 seconds, while McDonald fin
ished sixth to wrap up a solid meet for the butterflyers.
2004 was a bittersweet year for the Cardinal. Although swim
mers performed well individually, the lack of a team champi
onship left some of the team members feeling disappointed. Ad
ditionally, the swimming careers of Stanford stars Michael
Bruce and Bobby O'Bryan came to a close.. However, the fu
ture is bright for the team, as the swimmers begin to prepare for
the Olympic Trials in July and their chance at Olympic glory.
