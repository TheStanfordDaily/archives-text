# Women go 2-1 over break
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Beautiful beaches, sunny weath
er, inviting pools and a little compe
tition from the world's best water
polo players. Yes, the women of
Stanford water polo had a spring
"break" to envy.
No. 2 Stanford (13-2,5-0 Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation) start
ed its break off right, packing up its
suits and Cardinal caps fora trip to
Hawaii for the Aloha Classic. In
stead of lounging on the sands, the
squad had hard fought contests in
the water.
First off, Stanford faced No. 6
Hawaii (9-8,3-4) in a thriller on March
20. Stanford escaped with a 7-6 over
time. come-from-behind victory to
notch another conference win.
Led by Beth Norvick, the Rain
bow Wahine came out pounding to
build a 4-0 lead by the second period,
leaving the Cardinal offense to con
templation. But the Cardinal pulled
it together and gained energy against
Hawaii in the second half.
Thanks to freshman goalkeeper
Meredith McColl, who rebounded
after a shaky first half and allowed
only one goal in the second, the Car
dinal had the chance to come back.
After scoring on its power play op
portunities, Stanford tied the game
up at five to force overtime.
Hawaii was dangerously close to
topping Stanford, as it led in over
time — which would have given the

Cardinal its first loss to a lower-ranked
team. Fortunately for Stanford, senior
Wendy Watldns' two shots into the
cage sufficed as the defense kept the
Wahine from scoring again.
The close win added perhaps a little
more stress than a break should have,
but after all the Cardinal's "break" was
filled with stiff competition.
On March 21, Stanford continued
its dominance, beating No. 12 Indiana
in Aloha Classic play. Taking advan
tage of the 6on-5 offense at the start of
the game, senior Lauren Faust netted
one to give Stanford the early lead.
The low-scoring game was left at 2-1
as each team headed into the locker
room for the half.
The Hoosiers' Kandace Waldthaler
was able to tie the game coming into the
second half with hersecond match goal,
but Stanford's 6-on-5 came through
again as Katie Hansen scored in the
fourth. Stanford pulled away with an
other goal as the game came to an end
with a 4-2 Cardinal win.
Adding to Stanford's spring
break experience in Hawaii were the
international teams from Japan,
Canada and Brazil that the Cardinal
met in exhibition games.
The wins in Hawaii also gave the
Cardinal a five-game winning streak
as it headed into the exciting culmi
nation of its spring break — the
chance to play Team USA in an ex
hibition game.
The first match in Stanford histo
ry against Team USA, which is
preparing for this summer's

Olympics, drew the largest crowd yet
this season at Avery Aquatic Center.
Fans also got a chance to see old fa
vorites, as four former Stanford ath
letes are on the Athens-training
team, including Brenda Villa, Class
of 2003.
Though entering the game with a
winner's momentum, Stanford fell
to the highly experienced and talent
ed Olympians. The first half had
good signs for the Cardinal, as Mc-
Coll and the defense kept the com
petition to three goals. Good de
fense on both sides of the pool re
sulted in a 3-2 score at halftime.
The second half, however, was
much different. It turned out to be an
offensive frenzy for both teams as
defenses fell apart. Ten goals in
seven minutes added to the back
and-forth action. The quick pace
seemed to fit Team USA better, and
it came away with a 14-7 win.
While the Cardinal did not fare
well, it did have highlights in the game.
Sophomore driver Laurel Champion
and Watkins had two goals apiece,
and sophomore goalkeeper Amanda
Matuk did a good job of replacing Mc-
Coll in the fourth.
Robin Bueregard and Kelly
Ruben led Team USA with three
goals each.

Wendy Watldns' two shots into the
cage sufficed as the defense kept the
Wahine from scoring again.
The close win added perhaps a little
more stress than a break should have,
but after all the Cardinal's "break" was
filled with stiff competition.
On March 21, Stanford continued
its dominance, beating No. 12 Indiana
in Aloha Classic play. Taking advan
tage of the 6on-5 offense at the start of
the game, senior Lauren Faust netted
one to give Stanford the early lead.
The low-scoring game was left at 2-1
as each team headed into the locker
room for the half.
The Hoosiers' Kandace Waldthaler
was able to tie the game coming into the
second half with hersecond match goal,
but Stanford's 6-on-5 came through
again as Katie Hansen scored in the
fourth. Stanford pulled away with an
other goal as the game came to an end
with a 4-2 Cardinal win.
Adding to Stanford's spring
break experience in Hawaii were the
international teams from Japan,
Canada and Brazil that the Cardinal
met in exhibition games.
The wins in Hawaii also gave the
Cardinal a five-game winning streak
as it headed into the exciting culmi
nation of its spring break — the
chance to play Team USA in an ex
hibition game.
The first match in Stanford histo
ry against Team USA, which is
preparing for this summer's

Olympics, drew the largest crowd yet
this season at Avery Aquatic Center.
Fans also got a chance to see old fa
vorites, as four former Stanford ath
letes are on the Athens-training
team, including Brenda Villa, Class
of 2003.
Though entering the game with a
winner's momentum, Stanford fell
to the highly experienced and talent
ed Olympians. The first half had
good signs for the Cardinal, as Mc-
Coll and the defense kept the com
petition to three goals. Good de
fense on both sides of the pool re
sulted in a 3-2 score at halftime.
The second half, however, was
much different. It turned out to be an
offensive frenzy for both teams as
defenses fell apart. Ten goals in
seven minutes added to the back
and-forth action. The quick pace
seemed to fit Team USA better, and
it came away with a 14-7 win.
While the Cardinal did not fare
well, it did have highlights in the game.
Sophomore driver Laurel Champion
and Watkins had two goals apiece,
and sophomore goalkeeper Amanda
Matuk did a good job of replacing Mc-
Coll in the fourth.
Robin Bueregard and Kelly
Ruben led Team USA with three
goals each.
After a week of traveling to
Hawaii and having the great chance
to play the best in women's water
polo during their spring break, Stan
ford gets back to work this upcoming
Friday against Southern California
