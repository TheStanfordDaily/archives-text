# Grad student dies over break in car accident
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
First-year School of Education graduate student Amir Lopatin
died last Thursday in a car accident near Las Vegas at the age of 28.
Lopatin had just begun a doctoral degree in the Learning Sciences
and Technology Design program.
Friends and acquaintances said Amir was a smart, inquisitive
student and would be missed as much for his approach to life as for
his educational contributions.
"He was extremely multidisciplinary," said his brother Uri
Lopatin. "He was a computer geek who loved outdoor things."
Amir was active in the Orthodox Jewish community at Stanford
and was quickly making friends in his first few months on campus.
"He was a very bright, intensive person, and extremely friend
ly," said Rabbi Joey Felsen. who works with Hillel. "He also liked
to spend time with his thoughts."
"The Orthodox Jewish community at Stanford is small," Felsen
added. "For us it is a very big loss."
Amir grew up in Englewood. New Jersey, and completed a com
puter science degree at Brown University, where he was on the Ul
timate Frisbee team. Later, while he was working in New York
City, Amir founded the New York City Public Ultimate League,
which he ran until coming out to Stanford.
"The league was my brother's brainchild," Uri said.
Just beginning to find his place at Stanford, Amir had already
impressed professors with his intelligence and incisive questions.

"He had great enthusiasm, great
intellectual integrity," said Assoc.
Prof. Dan Schwartz, who taught
Amir." He was hold to state his opin
ion and you always learned more
when you talked to him."
Amir had already made an im
pact on colleagues in his small
doctoral program of about
15 students.
"I'm going to miss that he's a
straight-shooter," said master's stu
dent Paula Wellings. "He would tell
you exactly what he's thinking ...

and he was sweet."
Amir was taking advantage of the
sunny weather, driving back from
Las Vegas with childhood friend
Jonathan Wilson from New Jersey
when his new Honda Element
flipped. Wilson was in critical but
stable condition at University Med
ical Center in Las Vegas.
"He said [Stanford] was one of
the most beautiful places he'd ever
seen," said Joe Rosen, a research sci
entist who worked with Amir. "He
was very happy here."
"Not only will I miss him at a per
sonal level, but at a professional
level he will be greatly missed,"
Rosen also said. "I've been doing
this for 25 years and there were
things I could learn from Amir."

Amir had gone back to school to
try to apply technology to learning,
moving beyond the design and pro
gramming he had pursued in pri
vate industry.
"He wanted to help find ways of
helping people learn," said Uri.
"He was enamored by the concept
of education."
A funeral for Amir took place
on Sunday in Englewood, and a
memorial gathering was held last
night at Stanford. His family has
set up a Web site at www.amir
lopatin.com. which will have infor
mation about a foundation to be set
up in his memory.
Amir is survived by his mother
Sara, his older sister Shoshana and
his younger brother Uri.
