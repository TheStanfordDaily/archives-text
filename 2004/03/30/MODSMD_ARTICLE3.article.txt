### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
First-year School of Education graduate student Amir Lopatin
died last Thursday in a car accident near Las Vegas at the age of 28.
Lopatin had just begun a doctoral degree in the Learning Sciences
and Technology Design program.
Friends and acquaintances said Amir was a smart, inquisitive
student and would be missed as much for his approach to life as for
his educational contributions.
"He was extremely multidisciplinary," said his brother Uri
Lopatin. "He was a computer geek who loved outdoor things."
Amir was active in the Orthodox Jewish community at Stanford
and was quickly making friends in his first few months on campus.
"He was a very bright, intensive person, and extremely friend
ly," said Rabbi Joey Felsen. who works with Hillel. "He also liked
to spend time with his thoughts."
"The Orthodox Jewish community at Stanford is small," Felsen
added. "For us it is a very big loss."
Amir grew up in Englewood. New Jersey, and completed a com
puter science degree at Brown University, where he was on the Ul
timate Frisbee team. Later, while he was working in New York
City, Amir founded the New York City Public Ultimate League,
which he ran until coming out to Stanford.
"The league was my brother's brainchild," Uri said.
Just beginning to find his place at Stanford, Amir had already
impressed professors with his intelligence and incisive questions.
