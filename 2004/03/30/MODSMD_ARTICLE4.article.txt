# Stanford couple adopts child through alternative service
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
University staff members Mario Acquesta and
Valerie Beeman began the journey to adopt their
nine-year-old daughter, Diana, in 2002. As the
second Stanford family to adopt a child through the
Adoption Adventure Network, the couple found
themselves participating in a program that is chang
ing the nature of the contemporary
adoption process.
While researching on the Internet for adoption
agencies, Acquesta, the director of Human Re
sources Information Systems, and Beeman, the
Campus Readiness Specialist in ITSS, found them
selves inundated with seemingly impersonal online

pictures of far-away orphans.
"It was sad, and it was overwhelming," Beeman
said. "We thought, 'How can we make that sort of
life decision when all we have is a tiny little photo
graph and a one-paragraph description?"'
However, Acquesta and Beeman found Adop
tion Adventure Network's program to he a depar
ture from the practices of traditional adoption agen
cies and decided to adopt a child through them.
Adoption Adventure Network is a Bay Area pro
gram that works with adoption agencies in Russia to
bring orphaned children to potential adoptive fami
lies in the United States. The network organizes a
three week "American Culture Camp"in which the
children, whose ages range from four to eleven
years, stay with American families and participate

in day camp activities such as learning English and
arts and crafts.
The couple hosted the then eight-year-old Russ
ian orphan for two weeks in the winter of 2002.
"We knew, in the less than twenty-four hours that
she was in our home, that we were going to go for
ward [with the adoption)," Beeman said.
Beeman cited the Adoption Adventure Program,
along with a grant from Stanford's Adoption Assis
tance Program as two pivotal factors that helped her
and her husband bring Diana into their home this
past August. The $10,000 grant, which is available
through the Stanford Work Life Office, helped
cover a significant portion of what Azilla estimates
as the $28,000 average cost of adopting a child.
Because the Adoption Adventure Network deals

largely with older children, program founder and
coordinator David Azilla feels strongly about the
organization's philosophy of connecting the child to
the family in a natural home environment.
"With the older kids, it's on your own home turf,
you don't have to travel and it costs nothing," Azil
la said. "You get to see them in the context of your
own family. You get an extended period of time
where you can see some of the child's temperament
and you can see how they interact with their peers."
Beeman also discussed the merits of the hosting
experience, especially as this was her first time hav
ing a child in the family.
"It really gives you a good ability to see not only
how the child is like but to see how you respond to
the child's needs," she said. "We
really learned about ourselves
and we learned about what we
wanted to cultivate in a relation
ship with a child."
Although there are not many
programs such as Adoption Ad
venture Network in the United
States, they are growing in num
ber, and their average success
rate in matching host families
with children is 93 percent, ac
cording to Azilla.
In addition to the hosting pro
gram, Adoption Adventure Net
work has the added security that
the Russian birth mothers have a
longer period of time to decide

whether they truly want to put up
their baby for adoption than
birth mothers in the United
States. Thus, when the birth
mother gives her child up for
adoption, she effectively termi
nates her parental rights, leading
to fewer instances of families
being split from their adopted
children after the adoption has
occurred, according to press con
tact Corrie Reynolds.
The Adoption Adventure Net
work has facilitated nearly 65
adoptions in the two and a half
years since it began, a number
that surpasses the total number of
children adopted through all the
other Bay Area organizations
combined, said Azilla. Most of
the adoptive families are in the
Los Altos and Palo Alto areas,
with two of those families from
the Stanford community.

In fact, Beeman and her hus
band continue to keep in touch
with the other families who
adopted Russian children through
Adoption Adventure Network,
contacting the other parents to
share advice as well as to invite
each other to social gatherings.
Through these gatherings, the
adopted children have the oppor
tunity to reunite and speak to
each other in Russian, which Bee
man hopes will be a factor con
tributing to Diana's successful
transition into the United States.
Although the couple does not
speak Russian, they have found a
Russian-speaking therapist to
help Diana in her first year of
third grade.
"She has so amazingly quickly
picked up her English, and yet she
is still able to retain her native
language," Beeman said.

States, they are growing in num
ber, and their average success
rate in matching host families
with children is 93 percent, ac
cording to Azilla.
In addition to the hosting pro
gram, Adoption Adventure Net
work has the added security that
the Russian birth mothers have a
longer period of time to decide

whether they truly want to put up
their baby for adoption than
birth mothers in the United
States. Thus, when the birth
mother gives her child up for
adoption, she effectively termi
nates her parental rights, leading
to fewer instances of families
being split from their adopted
children after the adoption has
occurred, according to press con
tact Corrie Reynolds.
The Adoption Adventure Net
work has facilitated nearly 65
adoptions in the two and a half
years since it began, a number
that surpasses the total number of
children adopted through all the
other Bay Area organizations
combined, said Azilla. Most of
the adoptive families are in the
Los Altos and Palo Alto areas,
with two of those families from
the Stanford community.

In fact, Beeman and her hus
band continue to keep in touch
with the other families who
adopted Russian children through
Adoption Adventure Network,
contacting the other parents to
share advice as well as to invite
each other to social gatherings.
Through these gatherings, the
adopted children have the oppor
tunity to reunite and speak to
each other in Russian, which Bee
man hopes will be a factor con
tributing to Diana's successful
transition into the United States.
Although the couple does not
speak Russian, they have found a
Russian-speaking therapist to
help Diana in her first year of
third grade.
"She has so amazingly quickly
picked up her English, and yet she
is still able to retain her native
language," Beeman said.
University staff members Mario Acquesta and
Valerie Beeman began the journey to adopt their
nine-year-old daughter, Diana, in 2002. As the
second Stanford family to adopt a child through the
Adoption Adventure Network, the couple found
themselves participating in a program that is chang
ing the nature of the contemporary
adoption process.
While researching on the Internet for adoption
agencies, Acquesta, the director of Human Re
sources Information Systems, and Beeman, the
Campus Readiness Specialist in ITSS, found them
selves inundated with seemingly impersonal online

pictures of far-away orphans.
"It was sad, and it was overwhelming," Beeman
said. "We thought, 'How can we make that sort of
life decision when all we have is a tiny little photo
graph and a one-paragraph description?"'
However, Acquesta and Beeman found Adop
tion Adventure Network's program to he a depar
ture from the practices of traditional adoption agen
cies and decided to adopt a child through them.
Adoption Adventure Network is a Bay Area pro
gram that works with adoption agencies in Russia to
bring orphaned children to potential adoptive fami
lies in the United States. The network organizes a
three week "American Culture Camp"in which the
children, whose ages range from four to eleven
years, stay with American families and participate

in day camp activities such as learning English and
arts and crafts.
The couple hosted the then eight-year-old Russ
ian orphan for two weeks in the winter of 2002.
"We knew, in the less than twenty-four hours that
she was in our home, that we were going to go for
ward [with the adoption)," Beeman said.
Beeman cited the Adoption Adventure Program,
along with a grant from Stanford's Adoption Assis
tance Program as two pivotal factors that helped her
and her husband bring Diana into their home this
past August. The $10,000 grant, which is available
through the Stanford Work Life Office, helped
cover a significant portion of what Azilla estimates
as the $28,000 average cost of adopting a child.
Because the Adoption Adventure Network deals

largely with older children, program founder and
coordinator David Azilla feels strongly about the
organization's philosophy of connecting the child to
the family in a natural home environment.
"With the older kids, it's on your own home turf,
you don't have to travel and it costs nothing," Azil
la said. "You get to see them in the context of your
own family. You get an extended period of time
where you can see some of the child's temperament
and you can see how they interact with their peers."
Beeman also discussed the merits of the hosting
experience, especially as this was her first time hav
ing a child in the family.
"It really gives you a good ability to see not only
how the child is like but to see how you respond to
the child's needs," she said. "We
really learned about ourselves
and we learned about what we
wanted to cultivate in a relation
ship with a child."
Although there are not many
programs such as Adoption Ad
venture Network in the United
States, they are growing in num
ber, and their average success
rate in matching host families
with children is 93 percent, ac
cording to Azilla.
