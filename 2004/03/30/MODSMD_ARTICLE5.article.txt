# Students raise concerns with University's investments
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students joined students from
four other universities on March 2 to request
more information about the social and envi
ronmental effects of investments by the
world's fourth-largest hedge fund, San-Fran
cisco-based Farallon Management LLC.
"It seems some of the businesses and
companies they have invested in do not

have very socially responsible priorities,"
said sophomore Alyssa Schwartz, one of
the signatories of a letter to the company.
"As students, it's our money when we pay
the University. We are concerned money
may not be used in ways we would want it,
like sweatshops."
Tom Steyer, senior managing member
of Farallon and member of the advisory
board of Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, denied the students' first re

quest fora meeting on March 17.
"That our university invests in hedge
funds like Farallon raises many ethical con
cerns which must be explored and dis
cussed," said sophomore Kiyomi Burchill —
another of the signatories— in a press re
lease. "We want to engage Stanford officials
in how they are spending our endowment."
The students' campaign for information
began in the form of an open letter to Stey
er published on a Web site, http://www.un

farallon.info.
The letter carried 18 signatures, including
those of Burchill. sophomore Derek Kilner
and Schwartz. Stanford students also wrote a
letter to Michael McCaffery. president and
CEO of the Stanford Management Compa
ny, requesting information about Stanford's
investments in Farallon. Stanford has not re
sponded to the request and a spokesperson
was not reached for comment by press time.
Stanford Management Company

spokesperson Linda Kimball told Hedge
fund.net that Stanford mandates that invest
ments conform to human rights, environ
mental, labor and corporate governance
standards.
"We have repeatedly asked the Stanford
Management Company to provide informa
tion on the size and details of the investment,
but they have not responded." Kilner said.
"Our most important tool right now
is information, which we can use to
pressure Farallon into reforming
their practices and to show the Uni
versity how its money is being spent."
He added, "They have a history
of socially irresponsible investments,
from Argentina to Indonesia."
The Stanford campaign has not
gained the momentum that Farallon
protests have at Yale University,
where more than 60 students
demonstrated against a related land
sale at the beginning of March.
About 15 students, mostly from
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, have joined the
Stanford group challenging Univer
sity investments, according to Kilner.
Colleges are increasing the per
centage of their endowment assets
that they invest in hedge funds, ac
cording to http://unfarallon.info.
The Web site's creators — a
coalition started by students at Yale
University — believe Farallon may
use university money in investments
that are socially and environmental
ly harmful.
"As students paying tuition, and
thus putting our money into Stan
ford's endowment, we have a right to
know where our money is being in
vested, and to know that our money is

being used for socially responsible in
vestments," Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice member Kate Skol
nick, a junior, said in a press release.
Kilner cited the example of
Cordevalle Golf Club and Resort in
San Martin, in which Farallon is a
major partner. Cordevalle violated
two conditions of its 1996 use permit:
first, it neglected to reserve 60 per
cents of its grounds for public use;
second, it reneged on its promise to
create pools in order to protect two
endangered species that lived on its
grounds. According to the Web site,
Farallon helped Cordevalle hire a
lawyer to come up with a new pro
posal in place of its permit.
"We believe that we are stake
holders in the investments you make
with University money; so, too, are
the communities affected by these
investments," the letter to Steyer
reads. "Stated simply, we do not
want our universities to profit from
investments that harm other com
munities. We are concerned about
the effect some of Farallon's recent
investments have had."
In Steyer's response letter, he
stated that although Farallon appre
ciates the importance of the issues
that the letter raised, "We have
strong disagreements with you on
the facts about our investments and
the conclusions you draw."
Steyer continued to say that Far
allon works hard to maintain strong
values as a business.
"It is abundantly clear from vour

work that we disclose a great deal of
information to our limited partners,"
Steyer said. He also said that Faral
lon voluntarily registers with the
SEC as an investment advisor.
On the issue of environmental
impact, Steyer wrote, "We do be
lieve that our role in allocating capi
tal contributes to economic growth
in countries around the world, which
in turn improves long-term social
and environmental conditions."
He concluded, "We communi
cate extensively with our in
vestors, including universities, on
these and all other investment is
sues and concerns. Therefore, we
do not believe a meeting with you
is appropriate."
On the same day, Steyer wrote a
letter to Farallon's limited partners,
stating that Farallon had reviewed
the Web site's charges and found
them "factually inaccurate" and
"misleading." In this letter, Steyer
also wrote, "I am hopeful that this
issue will quiet down, though we will
of course work vigorously to protect
our reputations, if need be."
A Farallon spokesman would
not comment beyond clarifying
Steyer's remarks.
On March 19, students wrote to
Steyer again asking whether Faral
lon wanted to identify pieces of in
formation on the student Web site as
misleading. This letter has not yet re
ceived a response.
A day of action involving many
universities is planned for mid-April.

protests have at Yale University,
where more than 60 students
demonstrated against a related land
sale at the beginning of March.
About 15 students, mostly from
the Stanford Labor Action Coalition
and the Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice, have joined the
Stanford group challenging Univer
sity investments, according to Kilner.
Colleges are increasing the per
centage of their endowment assets
that they invest in hedge funds, ac
cording to http://unfarallon.info.
The Web site's creators — a
coalition started by students at Yale
University — believe Farallon may
use university money in investments
that are socially and environmental
ly harmful.
"As students paying tuition, and
thus putting our money into Stan
ford's endowment, we have a right to
know where our money is being in
vested, and to know that our money is

being used for socially responsible in
vestments," Stanford Community for
Peace and Justice member Kate Skol
nick, a junior, said in a press release.
Kilner cited the example of
Cordevalle Golf Club and Resort in
San Martin, in which Farallon is a
major partner. Cordevalle violated
two conditions of its 1996 use permit:
first, it neglected to reserve 60 per
cents of its grounds for public use;
second, it reneged on its promise to
create pools in order to protect two
endangered species that lived on its
grounds. According to the Web site,
Farallon helped Cordevalle hire a
lawyer to come up with a new pro
posal in place of its permit.
"We believe that we are stake
holders in the investments you make
with University money; so, too, are
the communities affected by these
investments," the letter to Steyer
reads. "Stated simply, we do not
want our universities to profit from
investments that harm other com
munities. We are concerned about
the effect some of Farallon's recent
investments have had."
In Steyer's response letter, he
stated that although Farallon appre
ciates the importance of the issues
that the letter raised, "We have
strong disagreements with you on
the facts about our investments and
the conclusions you draw."
Steyer continued to say that Far
allon works hard to maintain strong
values as a business.
"It is abundantly clear from vour

work that we disclose a great deal of
information to our limited partners,"
Steyer said. He also said that Faral
lon voluntarily registers with the
SEC as an investment advisor.
On the issue of environmental
impact, Steyer wrote, "We do be
lieve that our role in allocating capi
tal contributes to economic growth
in countries around the world, which
in turn improves long-term social
and environmental conditions."
He concluded, "We communi
cate extensively with our in
vestors, including universities, on
these and all other investment is
sues and concerns. Therefore, we
do not believe a meeting with you
is appropriate."
On the same day, Steyer wrote a
letter to Farallon's limited partners,
stating that Farallon had reviewed
the Web site's charges and found
them "factually inaccurate" and
"misleading." In this letter, Steyer
also wrote, "I am hopeful that this
issue will quiet down, though we will
of course work vigorously to protect
our reputations, if need be."
A Farallon spokesman would
not comment beyond clarifying
Steyer's remarks.
On March 19, students wrote to
Steyer again asking whether Faral
lon wanted to identify pieces of in
formation on the student Web site as
misleading. This letter has not yet re
ceived a response.
A day of action involving many
universities is planned for mid-April.
Stanford students joined students from
four other universities on March 2 to request
more information about the social and envi
ronmental effects of investments by the
world's fourth-largest hedge fund, San-Fran
cisco-based Farallon Management LLC.
"It seems some of the businesses and
companies they have invested in do not

have very socially responsible priorities,"
said sophomore Alyssa Schwartz, one of
the signatories of a letter to the company.
"As students, it's our money when we pay
the University. We are concerned money
may not be used in ways we would want it,
like sweatshops."
Tom Steyer, senior managing member
of Farallon and member of the advisory
board of Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, denied the students' first re

quest fora meeting on March 17.
"That our university invests in hedge
funds like Farallon raises many ethical con
cerns which must be explored and dis
cussed," said sophomore Kiyomi Burchill —
another of the signatories— in a press re
lease. "We want to engage Stanford officials
in how they are spending our endowment."
The students' campaign for information
began in the form of an open letter to Stey
er published on a Web site, http://www.un

farallon.info.
The letter carried 18 signatures, including
those of Burchill. sophomore Derek Kilner
and Schwartz. Stanford students also wrote a
letter to Michael McCaffery. president and
CEO of the Stanford Management Compa
ny, requesting information about Stanford's
investments in Farallon. Stanford has not re
sponded to the request and a spokesperson
was not reached for comment by press time.
Stanford Management Company

spokesperson Linda Kimball told Hedge
fund.net that Stanford mandates that invest
ments conform to human rights, environ
mental, labor and corporate governance
standards.
"We have repeatedly asked the Stanford
Management Company to provide informa
tion on the size and details of the investment,
but they have not responded." Kilner said.
"Our most important tool right now
is information, which we can use to
pressure Farallon into reforming
their practices and to show the Uni
versity how its money is being spent."
He added, "They have a history
of socially irresponsible investments,
from Argentina to Indonesia."
