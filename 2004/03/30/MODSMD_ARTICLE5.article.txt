# Students raise concerns with University's investments
## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford students joined students from
four other universities on March 2 to request
more information about the social and envi
ronmental effects of investments by the
world's fourth-largest hedge fund, San-Fran
cisco-based Farallon Management LLC.
"It seems some of the businesses and
companies they have invested in do not

have very socially responsible priorities,"
said sophomore Alyssa Schwartz, one of
the signatories of a letter to the company.
"As students, it's our money when we pay
the University. We are concerned money
may not be used in ways we would want it,
like sweatshops."
Tom Steyer, senior managing member
of Farallon and member of the advisory
board of Stanford's Graduate School of
Business, denied the students' first re

quest fora meeting on March 17.
"That our university invests in hedge
funds like Farallon raises many ethical con
cerns which must be explored and dis
cussed," said sophomore Kiyomi Burchill —
another of the signatories— in a press re
lease. "We want to engage Stanford officials
in how they are spending our endowment."
The students' campaign for information
began in the form of an open letter to Stey
er published on a Web site, http://www.un

farallon.info.
The letter carried 18 signatures, including
those of Burchill. sophomore Derek Kilner
and Schwartz. Stanford students also wrote a
letter to Michael McCaffery. president and
CEO of the Stanford Management Compa
ny, requesting information about Stanford's
investments in Farallon. Stanford has not re
sponded to the request and a spokesperson
was not reached for comment by press time.
Stanford Management Company

spokesperson Linda Kimball told Hedge
fund.net that Stanford mandates that invest
ments conform to human rights, environ
mental, labor and corporate governance
standards.
"We have repeatedly asked the Stanford
Management Company to provide informa
tion on the size and details of the investment,
but they have not responded." Kilner said.
