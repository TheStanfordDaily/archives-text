## Educators Corner ENCOURAGES ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
Where can you hear CEOs, ven
ture capitalists and successful en
trepreneurs share their experiences
and advice, 24 hours a day? The an
swer is simple: at the Stanford Tech
nology Venture Program's Educa
tors Corner, located at http://ed
corner.stanford.edu. SVTP pro
vides faculty with resources for
teaching students innovative en
trepreneurial strategies.
A project funded by the Kauff
man Foundation of Kansas City, the
Educators Corner provides video
content from the Entrepreneurial
Thought Leaders Program, case
studies and other material to users
from 43 countries. Stanford users
comprise nine percent of the total
user base.
"This project is an online archive
of teaching resources for faculty,"
said Katherine Emery, director of
educational technologies at the
Stanford Technology Ventures Pro
gram. "It is designed for faculty who
teach entrepreneurship to engineers
and scientists."
Emery described the origin of the
STVP.
"[Tom Byers, STVP academic

director] looked at what was going
on in Silicon Valley and said, "we
have all these engineers who are
starting companies and reach a cer
tain point where they hit a wall,"
Emery said. "Then they are either
bought out, or leadership is brought
in and they are kicked, or they fig
ure out how to manage and lead and
grow the company. We have a
unique opportunity, specifically for
engineers, to help them understand
basic business skills."
The STVP bridges engineering
and business schools.
"The goal [of the program] is to
create leaders, to create students
who can come in at any level of an
organization and think strategical
ly," she said. "Entrepreneurship,
unlike other disciplines, has some
technical expertise, but a lot of it is
practice and experience and under
standing the industry."
The Educators Corner allows
users, particularly those without di
rect access to the startup environ
ment, to tap into the experience of
real Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
"[When] we show [the Web site]
to people, especially people outside
of Silicon Valley, they find it very
valuable," said Tina Seelig, STVP
executive director. "We're so lucky;

we have so many resources that it
would be difficult for them to get.
We're happy to share."
Initially, there were some prob
lems getting faculty onboard.
"Unlike K-12 education, univer
sity professors have a different mo
tivational and incentive structure,
and many faculty would say, 'Why
would I ever want to share what it is
I do? My class is my intellectual
property and I'm not putting it up
online,"' Emery said. "So, there
wasn't a lot of excitement or inter
est. What I've seen in the last three
years is the development of course
management systems. Faculty can
now very easily put their content up
online, and they realize how easy it
is to share resources."
This is evident on campus by the
Coursework and CCNet initiatives,
and the rapid growth of Educators
Corner.
Rather than provide complete
course solutions, Educators Cor
ner allows faculty members to
use chunks of content in their
own classes.
"We could tape our classes and
put them up online, but faculty un
derstand their students, their con
text, their geography, their market,
and our classes might not be rele
vant to students, say in Kansas City
or New York City," she said. "But,
there are certain topics that are rel
evant. So we set up this Web site.
The original vision was that we
would always be faculty-driven. The
key parts of [the Educators Corner]
are building an [entrepreneurship]
center, designing a course and join
ing a community."
This ability to combine small seg
ments of content is a key feature.
"We realized that we had this
huge wealth of content in the video
tapes from [the Entrepreneurial
Though Leaders Seminar]," Seelig
said. "Faculty do not want you to
give them material they will use ver
batim in their courses; they want re
sources they can mix and match."
Tom Byers taught E145: Intro
duction to High Technology En
trepreneurship last quarter. He de
scribed the difficulty of creating a
new entrepreneurship class.
"You might be full-time, or you
might be part-time," Byers said.
"You might be an engineering pro
fessor or you might be a business
school professor. You've got the job
to go teach entrepreneurship. You
sit down, and go, "How do I do
that?" [You] know entrepreneur
ship because something has quali
fied [you] to be requested to do this.
Then, it's "How do I pull off a class
like this?"
He feels that Stanford offers a
wealth of resources to other schools
looking to develop entrepreneur
ship courses targeted at engineer
ing students.

"We are a giant laboratory on how
to teach entrepreneurship to [engi
neering school students], and ev
erything we try to do is addressing
the needs of students," Byers said.
"We want to give that away to edu
cators around the world. Stanford
has a history of creating curriculum
material, then sharing it, particular
ly in CS [computer science]. We
built a Web site to help facilitate
that sharing. Everyone around the
world looks at Stanford on how to
build a CS curriculum. We'd be
honored if [the Educators Corner]
got a similar [reputation]."
The Web site has about a hun
dred new users per month.
"I am so impressed with [the Ed
ucators Corner]," Seelig said. "It has
developed into something that is so
robust and so valuable. Essentially,
what we set out to do was figure out
a way that we could share what
we're doing at the STVP with other
faculty members."
The Web site was developed with
a $1.5 million grant from the Kauff
man Foundation.
"It all started when we began to
look at innovative business and en
trepreneurship education in the en
gineering school, and Stanford
seemed like a ideal candidate to get
involved in that conversation early
on," said Judith Cole, vice president
of knowledge management at the
Kauffman Foundation. "We funded
some programs with the engineering
school, and [Educators Corner]
grew out of that. Stanford was al
ready in the game of collecting video
and putting things online within a
couple hours after lecture, so they
already had that expertise and they
proposed to us that they could ex
pand that to the entrepreneurship
education arena."
The Educators Corner is a criti
cal link toward Kauffman's long
term goals.
"When we look at expanding en
trepreneurship education out of
business schools, we want it to go
into engineering and biosciences,
but we also want it in liberal arts,"
Cole said. "We want it in every area
as a field of study. So, this is a great
model. Every single person should
know that [entrepreneurship] is an
option for them."
Stanford has a long relationship
with the Kauffman Foundation.
"Stanford was one of the first
schools that we ever became in
volved with," she said. "The Kauff
man-Stanford relationship has al
ways been a great relationship.
They were there at the beginning
with us, helping us, then working to
gether, to do some really significant
things. We're really grateful we had
them as partners."
Summarizing the current state of
the project, Byers said, "We're for
real, and it's scaling really well."

"The goal [of the program] is to
create leaders, to create students
who can come in at any level of an
organization and think strategical
ly," she said. "Entrepreneurship,
unlike other disciplines, has some
technical expertise, but a lot of it is
practice and experience and under
standing the industry."
The Educators Corner allows
users, particularly those without di
rect access to the startup environ
ment, to tap into the experience of
real Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.
"[When] we show [the Web site]
to people, especially people outside
of Silicon Valley, they find it very
valuable," said Tina Seelig, STVP
executive director. "We're so lucky;

we have so many resources that it
would be difficult for them to get.
We're happy to share."
Initially, there were some prob
lems getting faculty onboard.
"Unlike K-12 education, univer
sity professors have a different mo
tivational and incentive structure,
and many faculty would say, 'Why
would I ever want to share what it is
I do? My class is my intellectual
property and I'm not putting it up
online,"' Emery said. "So, there
wasn't a lot of excitement or inter
est. What I've seen in the last three
years is the development of course
management systems. Faculty can
now very easily put their content up
online, and they realize how easy it
is to share resources."
This is evident on campus by the
Coursework and CCNet initiatives,
and the rapid growth of Educators
Corner.
Rather than provide complete
course solutions, Educators Cor
ner allows faculty members to
use chunks of content in their
own classes.
"We could tape our classes and
put them up online, but faculty un
derstand their students, their con
text, their geography, their market,
and our classes might not be rele
vant to students, say in Kansas City
or New York City," she said. "But,
there are certain topics that are rel
evant. So we set up this Web site.
The original vision was that we
would always be faculty-driven. The
key parts of [the Educators Corner]
are building an [entrepreneurship]
center, designing a course and join
ing a community."
This ability to combine small seg
ments of content is a key feature.
"We realized that we had this
huge wealth of content in the video
tapes from [the Entrepreneurial
Though Leaders Seminar]," Seelig
said. "Faculty do not want you to
give them material they will use ver
batim in their courses; they want re
sources they can mix and match."
Tom Byers taught E145: Intro
duction to High Technology En
trepreneurship last quarter. He de
scribed the difficulty of creating a
new entrepreneurship class.
"You might be full-time, or you
might be part-time," Byers said.
"You might be an engineering pro
fessor or you might be a business
school professor. You've got the job
to go teach entrepreneurship. You
sit down, and go, "How do I do
that?" [You] know entrepreneur
ship because something has quali
fied [you] to be requested to do this.
Then, it's "How do I pull off a class
like this?"
He feels that Stanford offers a
wealth of resources to other schools
looking to develop entrepreneur
ship courses targeted at engineer
ing students.

"We are a giant laboratory on how
to teach entrepreneurship to [engi
neering school students], and ev
erything we try to do is addressing
the needs of students," Byers said.
"We want to give that away to edu
cators around the world. Stanford
has a history of creating curriculum
material, then sharing it, particular
ly in CS [computer science]. We
built a Web site to help facilitate
that sharing. Everyone around the
world looks at Stanford on how to
build a CS curriculum. We'd be
honored if [the Educators Corner]
got a similar [reputation]."
The Web site has about a hun
dred new users per month.
"I am so impressed with [the Ed
ucators Corner]," Seelig said. "It has
developed into something that is so
robust and so valuable. Essentially,
what we set out to do was figure out
a way that we could share what
we're doing at the STVP with other
faculty members."
The Web site was developed with
a $1.5 million grant from the Kauff
man Foundation.
"It all started when we began to
look at innovative business and en
trepreneurship education in the en
gineering school, and Stanford
seemed like a ideal candidate to get
involved in that conversation early
on," said Judith Cole, vice president
of knowledge management at the
Kauffman Foundation. "We funded
some programs with the engineering
school, and [Educators Corner]
grew out of that. Stanford was al
ready in the game of collecting video
and putting things online within a
couple hours after lecture, so they
already had that expertise and they
proposed to us that they could ex
pand that to the entrepreneurship
education arena."
The Educators Corner is a criti
cal link toward Kauffman's long
term goals.
"When we look at expanding en
trepreneurship education out of
business schools, we want it to go
into engineering and biosciences,
but we also want it in liberal arts,"
Cole said. "We want it in every area
as a field of study. So, this is a great
model. Every single person should
know that [entrepreneurship] is an
option for them."
Stanford has a long relationship
with the Kauffman Foundation.
"Stanford was one of the first
schools that we ever became in
volved with," she said. "The Kauff
man-Stanford relationship has al
ways been a great relationship.
They were there at the beginning
with us, helping us, then working to
gether, to do some really significant
things. We're really grateful we had
them as partners."
Summarizing the current state of
the project, Byers said, "We're for
real, and it's scaling really well."
