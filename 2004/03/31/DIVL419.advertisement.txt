This course explores the multifaceted nature of language in the US, under three broad headings: (1)
VARIETIES OF ENGLISH, including regional, social and ethnic varieties such as Appalachian English
and African American Vernacular English; (2) OTHER LANGUAGES, including Spanish, Native
American languages, Asian American voices, and American Sign Language; and (3) THE SOCIOLIN
GUISTIC SITUATION, including language attitudes and prejudices, rap and hip hop, doctor-patient
communication, and the English Only and Ebonics controversies.
Stanford has become known for its scholarship in this area. The first (1981) edition of the text
Language in the USA was edited by Stanford professors Charles Ferguson and Shirley Brice Heath. And
the completely new Language in the USA: Themes for the 21st Century (our primary course text) is
edited by instructor John R. Rickford, and Ed Finegan (USC).
