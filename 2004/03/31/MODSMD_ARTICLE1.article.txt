With campaigns for the ASSU spring election
set to begin today, the Undergraduate Senate last
night attempted to wrap up the loose ends associ
ated with the special-fees group ballot.
One of the issues the Senate addressed in its
meeting was a loophole in its constitution that
gives it the power to approve or reject groups that
successfully complete the petition process. Ac
cording to Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior, the
Senate only has this power when the petition
deadline has been extended from its original date,
as it was this year. However, the Senate voted not
to utilize this clause â€” all groups that completed
valid petitions will be placed on the ballot.
Senators at last night's meeting also debated
whether a special designation should be included
on the ballot distinguishing between student
groups that entered the ballot through a Senate
vote and those that entered through the petition
ing process. Several options were put forward, in
cluding placing symbols next to groups that peti
tioned, placing symbols next to all groups and not
distinguishing between groups at all.
Representatives from some groups felt that
any attempt to distinguish between different
groups could be perceived as a de facto recom
mendation from the Senate to approve or reject a
group based on the manner in which it entered
the ballot.
"Until you know whether it is going to sway
the voters, it would be very irresponsible to put
stuff on the ballot," said senior Andrea Osborne,
a representative from the group Volunteers in
Latin America.
"There's three constitutionally valid ways of
getting on the ballot, and who's to say that any
one is better than another?" said senior Nick Ro
driguez from Education Democracy for Youth.
Several senators felt that some kind of distin
guishing marker was necessary.
"Voters should know which groups were vet
ted by the Senate and which groups weren't, be
cause the groups that were petitioning could have
included any budget they wanted," said Senator
Chris Lin, a sophomore.
In the end, the Senate voted not to isolate the
groups that petitioned, instead including infor
mation about how all groups entered the ballot,
with an additional disclaimer stating that all
methods of entry are legitimate.
