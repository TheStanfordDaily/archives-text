## The 						jobs of a university president, part II 
### PROF. GERHARD CASPER UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT EMERITUS 
Editor's Note: This column is the second of two columns by Prof. Gerhard Casper. The first column
was printed on Monday, March 29.

A fifth role of the university president is to be an educator. One must attempt to
educate students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and"the public" about what needs
to be the focus of the university (that is, teaching, learning and research rather than
being all things to all people), what needs to change, what needs to be preserved
and, perhaps most importantly, what must not be done.
The university president's educational task alone is extraordinarily demanding.
In my eight years, I gave roughly 1000 talks and speeches.
The president of a major research-intensive university also needs to be what
Stanford historian David Kennedy has called "a scholar in university service." In an
environment of structured anarchy, most of what one can accomplish is accom
plished because one is persuasive. One needs to be accepted by students and facul
ty as one of the faculty. One needs to continue to have a hand in teaching and, ide
ally, in research. I was able to underscore my views about the changes Stanford

should make (and did indeed make) in undergraduate education by teaching undergraduate seminars.
Job number six is being a public figure: on campus, in a region and in a state. In the case of some uni
versities, such as Stanford, the presidents are national figures, and indeed figures worldwide. When I
spoke at the centenary of Peking University in 1998, media in the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan all
seemed equally interested in my presence and my remarks.
The public figure status leads to demands on university presidents to take positions on public issues.
I was infamous for being especially austere when it came to politics.
Other than on issues directly pertaining to the university or higher education (for instance, affir
mative action), I do not believe I had a brief to commit the university (and with it its students, faculty
and staff) politically. Let us face it, my views or support were solicited primarily because of the posi
tion I held and not because of my personal reputation or expertise. My political preferences would
have been identified as those of "the president of Stanford" rather than purely and simply as those of
Gerhard Casper.
The university president is also, number eight, a social worker. Many people entertain the view that
one should solve problems by intervening in individual cases: whether it be a matter of unpaid student
fees, a legacy admission, a salary perceived as too low, a family tragedy or parking. The demands are
many on the service provider that the modern university has become.
Clark Kerr, the former president of the University of California, once said that a university presi
dent's job was to provide parking for the faculty, sex for the students and football for the alumni. Since
then, the range of expectations has greatly increased.
Finally, job number nine is "entertainer." Saul Bellow opened his novel Ravelstein saying: "Anyone
who wants to govern the country has to entertain it." That insight is also applicable to university pres
idents. One year, just before Christmas, the following appearances were on my schedule over a three
week period. Week 1: At a charity dinner for the benefit of our hospital that was occasioned by the
opening of a Bloomingdale's at the Stanford Shopping Center, I had to warm up the audience for Liza
Minnelli; week 2:1 tried to amuse a full house of students three nights in a row (add one night for re
hearsal) by playing myself and also performing the Macarena(!) at Gaieties. The third week I read a
Christmas bedtime story at a dorm.
The complexity of the job of a contemporary university president was nicely captured in March 1992
in a cartoon by Scott Willis for the San Jose Mercury News. The cartoon purported to be page one of
100 in the application form for president of San Jose State University. The box for "ethnicity" had such
hyphenated categories as "Euro-American," "Native-American," "African-American," "Japanese-
American" etc. and instructed the applicant to "check as many as possible."
The religion box mentioned "Atheist," "Buddhist," "Catholic," "Protestant," "Jewish," Hindu,"
"Satanic," "Other" and "Football." You were to "check all applicable." As to football specifically, it
gave three choices: "I love it,""I love it"and "I love it." The questionnaire contained six categories for
"sexual orientation" and asked the subject: "Are you politically: correct, incorrect, confused?"
The point of the cartoon was obviously that a president is supposed to be all things to all people. That
is also the view of many letters, editorials and other communications that inform the university presi
dent that the author is "appalled", "totally shocked", "dismayed", "scandalized", "deeply saddened",
"nauseated", "sick to his stomach" or "disgusted" by something the president, or somebody else at the
university (especially a student or a group of students), did do or failed to do: If one's skin is thick
enough to shrug it all off, the danger is that one has become callous.
And, finally, the good news: There is no job in American public life that is more challenging but also
more satisfying than making a contribution, in this particular role, to the increase of knowledge. And
it is not a lonely job because it depends on and greatly benefits from the often unstinting collaboration
of a great number of people: provosts, faculty, deans, chairs, students, trustees, senior officers, the staff,
alumni, parents and local, national and worldwide friends.

gave three choices: "I love it,""I love it"and "I love it." The questionnaire contained six categories for
"sexual orientation" and asked the subject: "Are you politically: correct, incorrect, confused?"
The point of the cartoon was obviously that a president is supposed to be all things to all people. That
is also the view of many letters, editorials and other communications that inform the university presi
dent that the author is "appalled", "totally shocked", "dismayed", "scandalized", "deeply saddened",
"nauseated", "sick to his stomach" or "disgusted" by something the president, or somebody else at the
university (especially a student or a group of students), did do or failed to do: If one's skin is thick
enough to shrug it all off, the danger is that one has become callous.
And, finally, the good news: There is no job in American public life that is more challenging but also
more satisfying than making a contribution, in this particular role, to the increase of knowledge. And
it is not a lonely job because it depends on and greatly benefits from the often unstinting collaboration
of a great number of people: provosts, faculty, deans, chairs, students, trustees, senior officers, the staff,
alumni, parents and local, national and worldwide friends.

A fifth role of the university president is to be an educator. One must attempt to
educate students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and"the public" about what needs
to be the focus of the university (that is, teaching, learning and research rather than
being all things to all people), what needs to change, what needs to be preserved
and, perhaps most importantly, what must not be done.
The university president's educational task alone is extraordinarily demanding.
In my eight years, I gave roughly 1000 talks and speeches.
The president of a major research-intensive university also needs to be what
Stanford historian David Kennedy has called "a scholar in university service." In an
environment of structured anarchy, most of what one can accomplish is accom
plished because one is persuasive. One needs to be accepted by students and facul
ty as one of the faculty. One needs to continue to have a hand in teaching and, ide
ally, in research. I was able to underscore my views about the changes Stanford

should make (and did indeed make) in undergraduate education by teaching undergraduate seminars.
Job number six is being a public figure: on campus, in a region and in a state. In the case of some uni
versities, such as Stanford, the presidents are national figures, and indeed figures worldwide. When I
spoke at the centenary of Peking University in 1998, media in the PRC, Hong Kong and Taiwan all
seemed equally interested in my presence and my remarks.
The public figure status leads to demands on university presidents to take positions on public issues.
I was infamous for being especially austere when it came to politics.
Other than on issues directly pertaining to the university or higher education (for instance, affir
mative action), I do not believe I had a brief to commit the university (and with it its students, faculty
and staff) politically. Let us face it, my views or support were solicited primarily because of the posi
tion I held and not because of my personal reputation or expertise. My political preferences would
have been identified as those of "the president of Stanford" rather than purely and simply as those of
Gerhard Casper.
The university president is also, number eight, a social worker. Many people entertain the view that
one should solve problems by intervening in individual cases: whether it be a matter of unpaid student
fees, a legacy admission, a salary perceived as too low, a family tragedy or parking. The demands are
many on the service provider that the modern university has become.
Clark Kerr, the former president of the University of California, once said that a university presi
dent's job was to provide parking for the faculty, sex for the students and football for the alumni. Since
then, the range of expectations has greatly increased.
Finally, job number nine is "entertainer." Saul Bellow opened his novel Ravelstein saying: "Anyone
who wants to govern the country has to entertain it." That insight is also applicable to university pres
idents. One year, just before Christmas, the following appearances were on my schedule over a three
week period. Week 1: At a charity dinner for the benefit of our hospital that was occasioned by the
opening of a Bloomingdale's at the Stanford Shopping Center, I had to warm up the audience for Liza
Minnelli; week 2:1 tried to amuse a full house of students three nights in a row (add one night for re
hearsal) by playing myself and also performing the Macarena(!) at Gaieties. The third week I read a
Christmas bedtime story at a dorm.
The complexity of the job of a contemporary university president was nicely captured in March 1992
in a cartoon by Scott Willis for the San Jose Mercury News. The cartoon purported to be page one of
100 in the application form for president of San Jose State University. The box for "ethnicity" had such
hyphenated categories as "Euro-American," "Native-American," "African-American," "Japanese-
American" etc. and instructed the applicant to "check as many as possible."
The religion box mentioned "Atheist," "Buddhist," "Catholic," "Protestant," "Jewish," Hindu,"
"Satanic," "Other" and "Football." You were to "check all applicable." As to football specifically, it
gave three choices: "I love it,""I love it"and "I love it." The questionnaire contained six categories for
