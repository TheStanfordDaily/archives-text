A little taste of home

Let me be the first to say, welcome back folks to
the carnival that is spring quarter. And don't
worry — yesterday's cloudy chill will soon
give way to sunnier, warmer skies, according
to Weather.com. (Get ready for an expected 80 degrees

on Friday!).
And while milk does a body good,
apparently sunshine does the soul
good. During spring quarter, every
one is a little happier, friendlier and
perhaps more inclined to skip another
lecture to make that bikini tan line a
bit more pronounced. Basically, spring
break is extended into spring quarter.
Nonetheless, those five days —
nine if you count the two bookend

weekends! Wow! — are plenty of
time to build upon the base tan that we all worked so
hard to achieve over finals week. Many a student comes
back from spring break with that Hawaiian Tropic glow
in their eyes and color on their shoulders.
(Disclaimer: while the color hot pink is a definite
"do" for pedicured toes and stiletto heels, it's a definite
"don't" on your face, back and arms. Please do not con
fuse the two.)
And while practically every person I know was jetting
off to Cabo, Cancun, Hawaii, the Caribbean and Palm
Springs, I was stuck spending my vacation at home in
Los Angeles. Which isn't all that bad, I guess.
So I decided to have a week that would rival all those
trips to Cabo. Who needs a stressful plane ride with gross

bathrooms when 1 can just make my own resort in my
backyard? My mom would be my cabana boy bringing
me lemonade to cool me off and my dad would be my
personal chef creating poolside snacks at my every whim.
Right.
Well, I hadn't checked out of The Four Seasons:
Broder yet when the marine layer decided to check in.
Fabulous. As I sat in my room watching "The Newly
weds" reruns, thinking of my friends frolicking on white
sandy beaches, I was tempted to stop by one of those
spray-on tanning places before I left. At least then 1
could pretend that my pigment-challenged week at
home in lovely overcast L.A. was actually some exotic
rendezvous in Aruba.
1 did see Marissa from"The 0.C." and Bob Sagat at
dinner one night (not together, of course), so I guess I
can't complain too much.
Some of the best things about going home — besides
the bed, the shower, the cleanliness and the laundry ser
vice known as mom — are your favorite places to eat.
Now my perception is probably skewed a little bit
coming from L.A. (my roommate last year had never
had sushi before Wilbur dining), but everyone has their
couple of restaurants that are essential stops for any trip
back home. Whether it be your favorite clam chowder
place that your dad has been taking you to since you
were old enough to remember or the Japanese restau
rant that makes the most amazing salad dressing — you
start craving it as soon as your plane starts to descend
over your home turf.
For me, one of my absolute favorite, only-in-L.A.

eateries is a small Italian market / deli in Santa Monica
called Bay Cities. They make the most amazing deli'
sandwiches, with a huge variety of meats, the best crusty
baguettes and a wonderful group of toppings known
fondly as "the works."
If any of you roadtrip down to So Cal and are looking
fora quick, inexpensive, amazing sandwich place (that
also sells the fattest individually-wrapped string cheeses
that I've ever seen), I highly recommend Bay Cities.
So when I came to Stanford, I sensed a serious lack of
quality gourmet sandwiches. I went to Andronico's, I
went to Whole Foods, but it just wasn't the same. The
sandwiches were tasty to be sure, but they lacked a sense
of cohesiveness. The lettuce, tomato and various
spreads didn't belong to the sandwich —they just
seemed to be grouped together against their will on
Dutch Crunch. Obviously the presence of a good sand
wich didn't make or break my year, but it would have
been a nice complement.
But then, one great day in winter quarter, I found Bay
Cities' long-lost cousin, known as The Cheese House.
And to think, it's picture wasn't even on the back of a
milk carton or on those "Have You Seen (The Cheese
House]" flyers with coupons on the back.
Tucked away in the very back of Town and Country,
next to the offices of Assemblyman Joe Simitian (bet
you didn't know that one was there), this little hole in
the wall market / deli sells amazing create-your-own
sandwiches. Just like my L.A. fave, they have a huge
variety of meats — from classic turkey to the more ad
venturous mortadella and Genoa salami — and an

even more impressive selection of fillings. They too
have the works, consisting of a harmonious blend of
lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, peppers and their fa
mous pickle spread (mustard, mayonnaise and pickles,
from what I can deduce).
You can also add in many other ingredients — my fa
vorites being sweet roasted red peppers and cucumbers.
And you aren't tied down to any individual kind of
bread — the Dutch Crunch gives a crunchier, sturdier
sandwich. For the single sliced bread (we ordered rye)
they use three pieces to hold all the fillings. This choice
gives you a softer, lighter sandwich.
Basically, any way you order, I'm sure you will be
pleased. The Cheese House also sells a great selection of
block cheeses and other random market purchases (jars
of pickles, olives, vegemite, etc.) So this quarter try to
seek out the relatives of your favorite home restaurants.
Everyone needs a little touch of home while at school. If
anything, it will compensate for doing your own laundry.
VJU Village Cheese House is located at 157 Town &
Country Shopping Center in Palo Alto.

If you have ever been to Bay Cities and want to remi
nisce together, shoot Jennie an e-mail at jbroder@stan
ford.edu. Or, if she inspired you to blow off Friday
class and drive the six hour trek to L.A., let her know
and she '11 give you directions to mmm-mmm goodness.
