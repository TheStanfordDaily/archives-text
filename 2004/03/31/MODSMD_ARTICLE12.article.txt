## State should invest in stem cells 
### 
Stem cells, derived from human fetuses, have the
potential to develop into any other type of
human cell. For this reason, they hold unique
promise for medical research. Stem cell research
may help to treat or cure everything from cancer and
heart diseases to Alzheimer's to diabetes and AIDS.
Last year, the Bush administration made a contro
versial decision to withhold federal funding for medi
cal research on any stem cell lines that had not already
been extracted from fetuses at the time. Much of the
medical community believes this restriction will prove
disabling to scientific advance, and so most stem cell
research is funded either by foreign governments,
states or private organizations such as universities.
To address this funding gap, the California Stem
Cell Research and Cures Initiative proposes to allo
cate $300 million a year from California bonds to pro
vide funding for research on stem cells in California.
There are three major reasons such an initiative
makes sense for California.
First and foremost, the scientific advances will like
ly save countless lives and improve many others. Sec
ond, California spends so much on health care that if
advances from stem cell research end up reducing costs
by just 1 percent, the initiative will pay for itself. Also
worth considering are the patent revenues the state
could earn under the law and the stimulation it would
provide to the sagging California technology sector.

Finally, just like Silicon Valley's advantages for IT
startups brought prosperity to California and the Unit
ed States, who reaps the prosperity of the future
Biotech Valley will depend on who establishes the ini
tial lead. With this in mind. New Jersey, Wisconsin,
Minnesota and a number of other states, as well as Har
vard University, are allocating money to attract stem
cell researchers. With the U.S. federal restrictions on
stem cell research and burgeoning investments in
places like South Korea, it will take state and local lead
ership to ensure that this important industry does not
establish itself overseas.
This initiative makes sense for Stanford as well.
Just as Stanford has reaped enormous rewards from
the IT boom, Stanford would be a primary beneficia
ry of investments in stem cell research. Stanford has
already established itself as a leader with the new pri
vately funded Institute for Cancer / Stem Cell Biology
and Medicine. Access to state money would bring new
resources to Stanford and allow the University to con
duct exciting and life-saving new research.
The coalition Californians for Stem Cell Research
and Cures is distributing petitions online at
http://www.curesforcalifornia.org in hopes of getting
the initiative placed on the November 2004 ballot.
We urge interested Stanford community members to
visit the Web site to learn more and perhaps con
tribute to the cause.
