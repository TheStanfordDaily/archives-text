# WALLACE WORLD
## Montgomery's one word 
### 
There are fans and there are
fanatics. I must have been of
the second category to jump
in a car with two complete
strangers and drive thirteen hours to
Seattle to watch our boys in the first
and second round of the NCAA
Men's Basketball Tournament. The
final outcome destroyed my tourna
ment brackets — in fact, it probably
put a dent in every betting pool in the
country — and it was a disappoint
ment. Oddly though, I didn't leave
Seattle disappointed.
Most stories are told with the
ending in mind. In fact, for most
sporting events, the ending is the
only fact that matters. But the
story of the 2004 Cardinal men's
basketball team has very little do
to with the final score or the offici
ating or the bloody curse or any
thing else that got airtime after
both teams filed out of Key Arena
in Seattle.
Yes, we lost by three points to Al
abama, a team not expected to get
through the second round of tourna
ment play. And it all happened in a
blur — kind of like the way you would
expect the world to look to our crazily
spinning mascot the Tree.
One moment Stanford was up by
thirteen points and the next we were
down by a couple of baskets with
many of the first-stringers in foul trou
ble. In the last minutes, Josh Childress
fouled out, leaving a vacancy on the
floor when we needed someone to
create baskets. But there were Nick
Robinson and Dan Grunfeld battling
until the end, launching one last shot
from three-point land that could have
tied the game.
That fight is what characterizes the
Cardinal and made it so fun to watch

this season. Even when a game ap
peared to be finished and many faint-

hearted Stanford
fans had already
moped out of the
arena, somehow
Stanford came
back to pick up
another win. Ex
cept for the one
and only season
loss, the team was
able to scrounge up

whatever that game required, and
they did it with a poise and maturity
not often seen in college sports.
During Stanford's first round
game against the University of
Texas at San Antonio, the Cardinal
led the first half. But then the team
stumbled a little in the second half.
Shooters went cold just when San
Antonio got hot, we turned over the
ball a few times, got a little sloppy,
and all the while the other team
kept scoring.
They shaved what had been a dou
ble-digit lead down to just six points
— dangerously within striking dis
tance. The temperature had decided
ly changed on the floor and it oc
curred to me that Stanford could
make history that day being the first
number one ranked team to lose in
the first round.
The entire arena was wild for
UTSA (odd when this should have
been friendly Pac-10 country), and the
cheering was deafening. Head coach
Mike Montgomery called a time-out
and when his team hit the floor again,
they were in charge. They handled
UTSA easily, adding one more win
and advancing to the next round.
The next day, I ran into Nick
Robinson at a reception. I had won

dered what Coach Montgomery told
his team in that time-out to make such
a significant difference in its play, so I
asked Nick what happened. He said
the coach wrote one word on a piece
of paper, and after he let the team ab
sorb it, he went into planning the next
plays.
That one word is for me the story
of the Cardinal team this year — why
they were successful, why they ended
the Pacific-10 Conference season on
top, why they left Key Arena in Seat
tle as champion ball players even if
they didn't advance as far into the
tournament as their potential would
predict. It was why I loved to watch
them play all season long and would
happily jump into a car with the afore
mentioned strangers to drive a long
distance when I should have been
working on a paper.
The one word? Poise.
Nick said Montgomery had often
reminded his players to take poise to
the court, to play with the confidence
of their evident talent. That is one
practice drill I would say Montgomery
can rest assured his boys learned. They
were poised in their string of victories
and in their rare defeats.
There were reasons to be upset in
Seattle. There were some crazy calls
— I think the fact that Alabama made
34 points from the foul line should tell
the whole story of the inconsistent of
ficiating — but our team was poised
and fighting until the end.
So I have my own word for the
team: thanks. Thank you for the thrills
and exciting season.
