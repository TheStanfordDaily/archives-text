Alcohol sanctions address
liability, not safety

In reference to the recent alcohol
suspension administered to the
Stanford Band, The Stanford
Daily's editorial board asserts that
"the larger issue here is underage al
cohol consumption, an offense for
which the Band is notorious"
("Band sanctions are reasonable,"
March 30).
This may be true; I know little
about the current student body's
perception of the Band. I submit,
however, that a more appropri
ate synopsis might be that college
is notorious for underage alcohol
consumption. It is naive, inap
propriate and irresponsible to
pretend that underage drinking
does not and will not occur
at Stanford.
The recent trend of alcohol sus
pensions at Stanford addresses one
problem: liability. It does not ad
dress student safety, a concern that
should be of paramount impor
tance. Students in freshman dorms,
fraternities and student organiza
tions are learning that underage
drinking leads to lost privileges.
They are learning that a call for help
results in alcohol suspension. Mis
takes are unacceptable, and conse
quences are steep.
Perhaps the current adminis
tration believes this culture of
fear will prevent underage alco
hol consumption; I suspect it will
lead to unsafe and unsupervised
drinking that could result in
tragedy. I drank alcohol as an un
derage Stanford freshman. I am
grateful for the support and su
pervision that I received from res
ident assistants and fellow stu
dents in learning to drink respon
sibly. I value the opportunity I
had to make my own responsible,
informed decisions.
Alcohol suspensions will not
teach student groups to deal re
sponsibly with alcohol. Rather,
student groups will learn to obey
rules ui.der the threat of lost
freedom. I only hope that Stan
ford's turn-the-other-way ap
proach does not result in true dis
aster (read: death, not lawsuit).

The Review's racist content
requires more forceful response

I know there has been a lot of
publicity on this subject already,
but I think recent content in the
Stanford Review (March 9) justi
fies a new, more forceful response.
The image of "the Chief" and the
"Smoke Signals" section of The
Stanford Review are utterly
ridiculous. The Review's repeated
inclusion of this racially derogato
ry section is not just insulting; it's a
slap in the face to many communi
ties on campus.
I am not a member of any minor
ity group on campus, but as a Stan
ford student and a human being, I
am deeply offended by this issue. I
haven't always agreed with opinions
of The Daily or other publications
on campus, but with regard to the
Review controversy, this is the first
time I have fever been embarrassed
to be associated with Stanford.
I think higher powers need to re
alize that The Stanford Review rep
resents the University when it uses
the name, and that Stanford gets
dragged through the mud every
time the Review publishes an arti
cle like that on March 9. Is there
anything we can do to force this
issue to resolution?

Venezuelan president is
obstructing democracy
Some of you might know that
Venezuela is trying to recall its pres
ident, Hugo Chavez, through a ref
erendum, but this has not happened
yet for various devious reasons. Ev
erybody says that Venezuela's best
option is to solve its problems in a
constitutional way. However, they
fail to realize that Chavez bends the
constitutional laws that he himself
wrote years ago, depending on how
they affect him now. This means
that by trying to solve the problem
in a constitutional way, we will
never be able to solve it. Somebody
or some organization needs to stand
up to its mission statement and
make sure that President Chavez
takes a democratic turn.
Venezuela is going through hard

times, not just because of President
Chavez's government but also be
cause of the chain of corrupt politi
cians who have been depleting na
tional treasures. For how long does
the population of Venezuela have
to be living under these conditions?
Chavez might have done a few de
cent things for the poor, but in the
meantime he has severely op
pressed the middle class. A presi
dent must respond to the needs of
all sectors of the population, not
only to one.
The Venezuelan government
was democratically elected, but
changing the rules of the game, op
pressing large parts of the popula
tion and ignoring the needs of the
country are not exactly the charac
teristics of a legitimate democratic
government. We are a potentially
rich nation and we have many things
to offer, but we need another
chance. Will the United Nations, the
Organization of American States or
Chavez himself give Venezuela an
other chance?
I have faith somebody will.

Former provost brings
shame to Stanfora
Condoleezza Rice, our current
national security adviser, was a
provost and faculty member of the
Political Science Department at
Stanford while I was an undergradu
ate on campus.
Rice is currently refusing to meet
with the 9 /11 Commission in pub
lic, under oath, to testify on what she
and other members of the Bush ad
ministration knew about terrorist
threats in the days and months pre
ceding 9/11. One can only wonder
why. Perhaps she just can't fit it into
her busy schedule. After all, she has
been on several television talk
shows this week, doing damage con
trol for the president.
It's a sad day when a former
provost and faculty member brings
such shame to our wonderful Uni
versity. The winds of freedom
don t seem to blow as far as Wash

Venezuelan president is
obstructing democracy
Some of you might know that
Venezuela is trying to recall its pres
ident, Hugo Chavez, through a ref
erendum, but this has not happened
yet for various devious reasons. Ev
erybody says that Venezuela's best
option is to solve its problems in a
constitutional way. However, they
fail to realize that Chavez bends the
constitutional laws that he himself
wrote years ago, depending on how
they affect him now. This means
that by trying to solve the problem
in a constitutional way, we will
never be able to solve it. Somebody
or some organization needs to stand
up to its mission statement and
make sure that President Chavez
takes a democratic turn.
Venezuela is going through hard

times, not just because of President
Chavez's government but also be
cause of the chain of corrupt politi
cians who have been depleting na
tional treasures. For how long does
the population of Venezuela have
to be living under these conditions?
Chavez might have done a few de
cent things for the poor, but in the
meantime he has severely op
pressed the middle class. A presi
dent must respond to the needs of
all sectors of the population, not
only to one.
The Venezuelan government
was democratically elected, but
changing the rules of the game, op
pressing large parts of the popula
tion and ignoring the needs of the
country are not exactly the charac
teristics of a legitimate democratic
government. We are a potentially
rich nation and we have many things
to offer, but we need another
chance. Will the United Nations, the
Organization of American States or
Chavez himself give Venezuela an
other chance?
I have faith somebody will.

Former provost brings
shame to Stanfora
Condoleezza Rice, our current
national security adviser, was a
provost and faculty member of the
Political Science Department at
Stanford while I was an undergradu
ate on campus.
Rice is currently refusing to meet
with the 9 /11 Commission in pub
lic, under oath, to testify on what she
and other members of the Bush ad
ministration knew about terrorist
threats in the days and months pre
ceding 9/11. One can only wonder
why. Perhaps she just can't fit it into
her busy schedule. After all, she has
been on several television talk
shows this week, doing damage con
trol for the president.
It's a sad day when a former
provost and faculty member brings
such shame to our wonderful Uni
versity. The winds of freedom
don t seem to blow as far as Wash
ington, D.C.

Alcohol sanctions address
liability, not safety

In reference to the recent alcohol
suspension administered to the
Stanford Band, The Stanford
Daily's editorial board asserts that
"the larger issue here is underage al
cohol consumption, an offense for
which the Band is notorious"
("Band sanctions are reasonable,"
March 30).
This may be true; I know little
about the current student body's
perception of the Band. I submit,
however, that a more appropri
ate synopsis might be that college
is notorious for underage alcohol
consumption. It is naive, inap
propriate and irresponsible to
pretend that underage drinking
does not and will not occur
at Stanford.
The recent trend of alcohol sus
pensions at Stanford addresses one
problem: liability. It does not ad
dress student safety, a concern that
should be of paramount impor
tance. Students in freshman dorms,
fraternities and student organiza
tions are learning that underage
drinking leads to lost privileges.
They are learning that a call for help
results in alcohol suspension. Mis
takes are unacceptable, and conse
quences are steep.
Perhaps the current adminis
tration believes this culture of
fear will prevent underage alco
hol consumption; I suspect it will
lead to unsafe and unsupervised
drinking that could result in
tragedy. I drank alcohol as an un
derage Stanford freshman. I am
grateful for the support and su
pervision that I received from res
ident assistants and fellow stu
dents in learning to drink respon
sibly. I value the opportunity I
had to make my own responsible,
informed decisions.
Alcohol suspensions will not
teach student groups to deal re
sponsibly with alcohol. Rather,
student groups will learn to obey
rules ui.der the threat of lost
freedom. I only hope that Stan
ford's turn-the-other-way ap
proach does not result in true dis
aster (read: death, not lawsuit).

The Review's racist content
requires more forceful response

I know there has been a lot of
publicity on this subject already,
but I think recent content in the
Stanford Review (March 9) justi
fies a new, more forceful response.
The image of "the Chief" and the
"Smoke Signals" section of The
Stanford Review are utterly
ridiculous. The Review's repeated
inclusion of this racially derogato
ry section is not just insulting; it's a
slap in the face to many communi
ties on campus.
I am not a member of any minor
ity group on campus, but as a Stan
ford student and a human being, I
am deeply offended by this issue. I
haven't always agreed with opinions
of The Daily or other publications
on campus, but with regard to the
Review controversy, this is the first
time I have fever been embarrassed
to be associated with Stanford.
I think higher powers need to re
alize that The Stanford Review rep
