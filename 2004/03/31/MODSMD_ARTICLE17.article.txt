## Argument against gay marriage lacks logic 
### SAM ALTMAN 
Even when reason is not on its side,
The Stanford Review seems willing to
stand by its party line at all costs.
In the March 9 article "Taking the
Next Step," Christopher Fish writes
that if we issue marriage licenses to
gay couples, we should also issue
them to people desiring to wed "The
State of New Hampshire," "Mrs.
Brown's Third Grade Class" and
"The Gray-Haired Wildebeest".
His fellow staff member
Stephen Cohen accuses the gay
rights movement of lacking "moral
maturity." I accuse him and his col
leagues of the same.
These are the desperate attempts of

men whose views have no rational
basis. Contrary to Fish's witty article, al
lowing homosexuals to marry does not
change the fundamental nature of mar
riage; marriage will remain an institu
tion between two consenting adults
who love one another. It does not de
stroy the binary nature of marriage, and
it does not allow a person to marry any
thing other than another person.
Opponents of gay marriage warn
us of a future in which people marry
their dogs. This is simply the best de
fense of a position for which no ra
tional defense exists. Letting homo
sexuals marry does not radically
change marriage — it simply mod
ernizes the institution.
Marriage between different races

was once also illegal, but the law was
ruled unconstitutional. Marriage be
tween a black man and a white
woman does not harm the institution
of marriage, because it does not
change the aspect of marriage that
matters: two consenting adults who
love each other.
It is unfair to deny two consent
ing adults who wish to be married
the recognition and benefits that
come with the license. I sincerely
hope that The Review does not
support a law banning interracial
marriage. By the very same logic,
they should not support a ban on
homosexual marriage.
Cohen claims that gay marriage
will destroy society as we know it.

Neither his article nor any other part
of The Review present a convincing
argument explaining why letting two
people of the same sex marry each
other is so apocalyptic.
This is because no such argument
exists; two women exchanging vows
will have no negative impact on your
life. Two men joining together in
marriage is not the Second Coming.
In lieu of a reasoned argument,
Cohen resorts to citing the "flam
boyant homosexuals of the San
Francisco gay pride parades [that]
appear more like a group of drunken
fraternity boys than a dignified mi
nority group" as a reason why the
gay community as a whole does not
deserve equal rights.

The obvious fact that flamboy
ance is not a reason to deny equal
rights notwithstanding, it is irre
sponsible to pass judgment on an
entire group based on an unrepre
sentative fraction.
If we were to use Fish's juvenile
attempt at reasoning as the standard
by which to judge all conservatives,
we would most likely come to the
conclusion that conservatives are
not mature enough for marriage.
