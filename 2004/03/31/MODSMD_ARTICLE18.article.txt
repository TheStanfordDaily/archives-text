## California, we have a winner 
### 
Continuing my "X is better than Y
because Y sucks" theme, this
week I've decided to elaborate
on the fact that California pro
duces better athletes than its colder
counterparts across the vast wasteland in
the middle of the continent.
On campus, this week has been a mi
crocosm of why the Left Coast (here
inafter "The Better One") produces so
many stud athletes. It's still March, and
Wilbur Field is already swarming with
people playing Ultimate. Last year on
Groundhog Day, I distinctly remember it
being 80 degrees.
In fact, it's surprising that they don't
just have Spring Training out here, al
though I guess professional sports has to
throw Arizona a bone in response to sad
dling them with the worst uniforms (in

baseball, basketball
AND hockey) since that
first caveman who de
cided to cover his geni
tals with an animal skin.
Purple, unless paired
with gold or black, is not
meant for sports. The
only team they have in
Phoenix that doesn't
look like a colorblind

toddler's art project is
known primarily as
where Emmitt Smith's career went to
die. But I digress.
The source of California's talent,
then, is not particularly difficult to pin
point. I'm drawing a conclusion here
worthy of Julie "People's bodies are
nicer in Brazil because they work out"
Ruvolo: the weather is nice, allowing for
more practice time.
I pity New Englanders' inability to
throw the horsehide around in March, al
though I'm sure it must be tragically
funny to see the ball swept sideways by
gale-force winds.
Today's temperature in New York is
36 degrees and raining. Where I'm from,
in Orange County, it is 78 degrees and
sunny. Most of my friends are either at
the beach or skateboarding, saying "bro"
and "sick" and pretty much engaging in
every lame stereotype promoted by that
botched entertainment abortion of a TV
show that shares its name. Not that
there's anything wrong with that; the OC
is awesome . . . Bitch. Thus, Orange
County and its surroundings, due to their
status as God's chosen country in terms
of sunshine, have become a breeding
ground for sports dominance.
California sports is what the East
Coast wishes it could be. I fully realize
that in response to this column, I'm
about to get angry e-mails from bitter,
jaded New Yorkers claiming that crappy
weather somehow toughens them. This
may be true after a while, but a signifi
cant proportion of the blue-chip athletes
that play for East Coast teams — both
college and pro — are from California.
Southern California in particular is a
hotbed for baseball prospects, even at a
young age. My club baseball team when I
was 14 has so far produced three pro
draft picks and at least 10 Division I col
lege baseball players, and we weren't
even the best team in a 15-mile radius.
My freshman year, our high school base
ball team was ranked No. 4 in the nation
and we didn't win our league because the
No. 1 team was in it.
With regard to football, California
also plows through its opponents. USC
football is usually a good representa
tion of this; their athletes are Nike
spokemen waiting to happen. The an
nual Shrine Prep All-star Game held
between California and Texas kids is
so packed with scouts you'd think
they'd cloned Terrell Owens and left
out his personality.
L.A.'s hoop dreams, too, are rivaled
only by New York. The Venice Beach
court is the blacktop legends are made
on, and not only because of the visceral
"American History X" scene shot there.
You wouldn't know it from their perfor
mance in the last couple of years, but
UCLA is also probably the most success
ful franchise in college basketball histo
ry, built almost entirely from a sun
drenched California base.
It's beautiful outside, and you'd
have to be crazy to go anywhere else. In
fact, drop this paper right now, skip
your physics lecture and go throw the
football around. Participate in Califor
nia's tradition of sports excellence. Do
it now, and think about how much bet
ter it is than spending your "spring"
break back home in Buffalo was. Al
though I'm sure Lake Erie is stunning
this time of year.
