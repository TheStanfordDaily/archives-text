NORMAN, Okla. —The magical run is over. The Nicole Pow
ell era is over. The Stanford women's basketball team's up-and
down season has come to a heart-breaking close at the hands of
Tennessee, a team which the Cardinal just can't seem to close out.
The top overall seed in the NCAA Women's Basketball Tour
nament, Tennessee extended its dominance over the sixth-seeded
Stanford women, defeating the Cardinal, 62-60, to advance to yet
another Final Four appearance — and it took yet another contro
versial call to do it.
After defeating Baylor in the Sweet Sixteen on free throws with
0.2 seconds on the clock, the Lady Vols seemed to get away with an
offensive foul that put junior guard Kelley Suminski on the ground
with under a minute left, setting the stage fora Tasha Butts three,
putting Tennessee in the lead.
Senior forward Nicole Powell, however, was able to answer back
with an off-balance, one-handed runner in the lane to tie the ball
game with 44 seconds remaining on the clock.
Stanford came up with the defensive stop it needed, but the re
bound was swatted off the hands of senior center Chelsea Trotter,
giving Tennessee another opportunity to take the lead.
Butts caught an inbounds pass and worked one-on-one
against Powell, wrapping around the taller, slower Powell fora
layup from the left block to put Tennessee up by two with 1.7
seconds remaining.
On the final play, Powell caught a perfect baseball pass from ju
nior forward T'Nae Thiel and was able to get off a final shot. The
shot was on line, but hit the front of the rim. There was contact with
two Lady Vols on the shot, but no foul was called.
"Nothing was going to be called," said Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer. "But I don't think it boils down to that one play. Even
with 1.7 seconds, we had a good shot."
The game was possibly most heart-breaking for Powell. Powell
played an amazing two halves, finishing with 31 points, 10 rebounds
and two blocks on 14-of-24 shooting from the field.
"That's what was missing — a win," Powell said. "We played re
ally tough, but they made the plays that count."
The sixth seeded Cardinal got off to an extremely hot start, hit
ting six of its first eight shots on its way to a 26-18 lead with 8:26 re
maining in the first half.
Tennessee, however, was able to work its way back into the game
with a balanced offensive attack. The Lady Vols went on a 3 1/2
minute, 11-0 run with 6:51 left in the first half before the Cardinal
was able to stop the bleeding with a layup by Thiel.
The Lady Vols seemed to have all the answers for the Cardi
nal to start the second half, absolutely shutting down the Stan
ford offense, save Powell, who was able to create almost at will
for the Cardinal.
And while Tennessee was able to quiet Stanford's offense at the
start of the second half, the Cardinal was unable to do the same on

Senior Nicole Powell's three-pointer fell short at the buzzer, giving Tennessee a 62-60 win after Tasha Butts made
a layup with 1.7 seconds left.
the defensive end. The Lady Vols
executed to perfection, shooting a
ridiculous 61.9 percent from the
field in the final period.
While Powell had an absolute
ly phenomenal game, the rest of
the Cardinal team had a hard
time stepping up on offense.
Powell was the only Cardinal in
double figures and was named
Most Outstanding Player of the
Mid-West Regional.
The usually sharp-shooting
Stanford squad was unable to knock
down its long-range shots. The team
shot 3-of-16 from 3-point land, with
Powell knocking down the only
treys of the night for the Cardinal.

Stanford did get fantastic de
fense from Thiel, who was able to
hold Tennessee's top scorer, Shyra
Ely, to 12 points.
"Our team has really over
achieved," VanDerveer said.
"Nicole is obviously an exception
al player. I don't think you could
ask for more from T'Nae. She did
an outstanding job on Ely. And
Susan Borchardt just played her
heart out."
Tennessee will advance to New
Orleans to take on Seimone
Augestus and Lousiana State.
Augustus is leading all scorers in
the tournament after back-to
back 29-point games.
