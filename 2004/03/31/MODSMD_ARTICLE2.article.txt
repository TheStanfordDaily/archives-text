# Leibel to direct cancer center
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The new 150,000-square-foot Stanford Cancer Cen
ter, which opened at the beginning of March, will wel
come its first director, Steven Leibel, on July 1. Leibel
currently serves as chairman of the department of radia
tion oncology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York. He has worked to develop new
methods of radiation therapy for prostate cancer and will
also become president of the American Board of Radiol
ogy this summer.
Born at Stanford Hospital in San Francisco, Leibel is
no stranger to the Bay Area. He hopes to continue to
practice and will continue to teach, but his main focus will
be building the new center, he said.
The Daily interviewed the new director yesterday
about his expectations and goals for the Stanford Can
cer Center.
The Daily: Stanford has treated cancer before, what do
you see the new cancer center doing differently?
Steven Leibel: 1 think that the cancer programs have
been focused on a few areas, and we need to improve
those areas. First and foremost is to build the patient pop
ulation, to have more people come to Stanford. To do
that, we have to grow the program in common tumor
sites. Gastro-intestinal, prostate, breast, head and neck,
lung cancer; all those areas are where there is opportuni
ty for growth.
We also have to demonstrate that we're practicing cut
ting edge medicine. We have to say, "This is what we're
doing and this is why you should come to Stanford first
and not somewhere else first." We need to make sure
everyone is practicing cutting edge medicine.
We also need to make it very convenient for the pa
tients to make their way through the center. The key is
to have good service. We want people to tell their doc
tors, "I had a wonderful experience, despite this terri
ble disease."
TD: There are other cancer centers around the country
— what will be different about Stanford?
SL: I think that Stanford in terms of all the cancer centers
is number 18. I'd like to see us be three or four rapidly. To
distinguish ourselves, first we need a [National Institute
of Health] designation as a comprehensive cancer center.
That distinguishes us from Peninsula Medical Center's
cancer center in Burlingame. for example.
That involves cutting edge medicine, state of the art
treatment, identifying areas that no one else is. We need
to get our foot in door and demonstrate outcomes that
are successful. This requires a good research infrastruc
ture and informatics systems.
TD: What are you looking forward to the most about re
turning to the Bay Area?

SL: Several things — my parents live there, my
lifestyle is more conducive to that than here. Also, 1
have the opportunity at Stanford to be on the ground
floor of something on the upward slope where you can
really put your imprimatur on something and make it
something successful.
TD: Why is it so important to gain a designation
as a comprehensive cancer center and how is this
accomplished?
SL: You have to apply fora grant. The grant is a com
bined science grant, funding basic science research, trans
lational research (transferring research to patients) and
clinical research, funding a comprehensive overriding
cancer program. The grant gives you a lot of dollars to
make that program move forward. In the cancer world
this gives you a special place and I'm told allows you to
get more grants.
TD: How much is the new center about making Stanford
a destination of choice for patients?
SL: I don't know if people come to a center fora building,
but they do come for the reputation and ease of move
ment. They are looking for high quality care and cutting
edge medicine.
I'm a radiation oncologist, so I know doctors at Stan
ford, and they do excellent medicine, but people still
don't come in droves. Now we have a beautiful center all
together. It's extremely convenient, with all the special
ists there together so can they can get the best diagnosis
and treatment...
TD: So much of the new center's goals focus on increas
ing patient flow and revenue?
SL: Yes. Let me add, the beauty of the program today is
that both the hospital and the University both want this
to be highly successful. There is enormous support on
both sides to do that.
TD: Speaking of the University, will there be a teach
ing component?
SL: There are medical oncology fellows, radiation oncol
ogy residents, as well as surgical oncology. I'm not in a
place with students, so I'm not thinking that way yet. Of
course there's a tremendous specialization and the way
you get people to go into oncology specialties is to have
them do rotations with you.
TD: What do you anticipate being your biggest challenge?
SL: The challenge is being able to recruit all the people
we need. We have to establish what the cutting-edge
medicine is going to be, to decide what the focus will be.
And recruiting patients, recruiting doctors and staff is
probably going to be the biggest challenge.

TI): So this will expand Stanford's cancer capacity?
SL. The capacity has grown, but we want to grow it
more. To do that we also have to have medical staff,
nurses, social workers, assistants to work with you and
so forth. And recruiting to the Bay Area is difficult.
Also, patients we are not seeing are currently being seen
elsewhere; it's not that they are not getting treatment.
So we need to tell them, "Stanford is better and you
should come here first."
TD: You've done a lot of work with clinical trials, will that
be a focus at Stanford?
SL: The talk that I hear is that there are some issues in the
clinical trials infrastructure that need to be addressed. I
will try to address those, as clinical trials are critical to a
cancer center and something that brings patients in.
