# Stanford gets season's first shutout, over San Jose St
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Despite the fact that the Stanford
baseball squad (21-3) swept San Jose
State (14-13-1) in the teams' two 2003
meetings, last night's contest at Municipal
Stadium held no guarantees for the top
ranked Cardinal. The Spartans spent the
off-season revamping their lineup and
have been exhibiting offensive power
that was absent from last year's squad —
in fact, the team is three homers from
equaling its total for all of 2003.
In the end, though, San Jose wasn't
able to get timely hits and was run over by
the Cardinal, 5-0.
Tuesday night games tend to be a time
for Stanford relievers to prove them
selves, and the Cardinal tested out five
hurlers over the course of the evening.
The first three frames of the matchup
were quick, as both starting pitchers were
in control right away. Stanford freshman
righthander Matt Leva gained control of
his breaking ball early and baffled the San
Jose hitters, while Spartans starting righty
Jose Amaya trapped three of the first six
batters he faced into 0-2 counts.
But after three tight innings, four be
came the magic number for the Cardinal.
Stanford plated four runs on four hits in
the fourth to break the scoreless tie.
The one-out rally began when sopho
more infielder Jed Lowrie got a free ride
to first and advanced to third on a hard hit

to right from sophomore first baseman
John Mayberry Jr.
At that point the Spartans' pitching
crumbled and junior outfielder Danny
Putnam, junior designated hitter Chris
Carter and sophomore infielder Chris
Minaker each recorded RBIs before the
inning's end.
San Jose regained its composure on
the mound by the fifth, but the damage
was done and the Cardinal pitchers went
to work.
Junior Mark Jecman, sophomore
Matt Manship, senior David O'Hagan
and freshman Jeff Stimpson combined to
finish off the shutout.
"We've been doing a good job of
keeping everybody sharp," Stimpson
said of the Cardinal pitching staff.
"We're throwing strikes and really going
after hitters."
The Spartans got a few base knocks
after the fourth, but preserved the Cardi
nal shutout by stranding their runners.
The second half of the order was dormant
the entire night — all of the team's six hits
came from the first five batters.
Stanford also struggled offensively
after its four-run surge, scoring only once
more in the eighth on a sacrifice fly from
Minaker. Mayberry Jr. was the only Car
dinal player to get more than one hit.
Players on both teams said that

counted for some of the squads' trou

Stimpson also said that the Cardinal
let its offensive intensity slip after its
four-run surge.
"I think we just got satisfied with
our lead and let our pitching work for
us," he said. "We got relaxed."
The game marks the Cardinal's first
shutout of the season and the second
straight time that the team has blanked
the Spartans on San Jose turf. (Stan

ford topped San Jose last May, 3-0.)
Though the Spartans did not pose
much of a challenge, head coach Mark
Marquess still thought the game was
worthwhile.
"[We are] still a work in progress,"
he said after last night's win. "We still
have room for improvement. [But] our
record is 21-3 and [this team] has
earned it."
Stanford will continue its seven
game road trip this weekend with
its official conference opener in
Los Angeles against the UCLA
Bruins (14-10). Game time is 6 p.m.
on Friday night and 1 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday.
