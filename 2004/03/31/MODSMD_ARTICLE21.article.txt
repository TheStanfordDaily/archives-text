# Women's Gymnastics Wins Pac-10 Championship
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
With a Pacific-10 Conference team championship title
and the highest ranking in program history under its belt,
the No. 2 Stanford women's gymnastics team (8-3, 4-2
Pac-10) is ready to vie fora national championship.
The team won the Pac-10 championship on March 20
with a score of 197.9, continuing its four-meet winning
streak and beating out top-ranked UCLA by a mere
0.025 points. UCLA beat Stanford earlier in the season
by more than a point, but opened the door for the Cardi
nal at Pac-lOs with two major mistakes on balance beam.
Sophomore Natalie Foley led the Cardinal by capturing
the all-around title with a score of 39.8. She is the first
Stanford gymnast be crowned with that honor.
"Nat has been leading the team in the all-around all
year and she really put it together for Pac-lOs. She hit
every landing and competed with enthusiasm," said head
coach Kristen Smyth. "She does big, exciting gymnastics
and can be a contender for the all-around at nationals."

Foley also tied fora win on vault, scoring the first 10.0
of her career. She competed an explosive full-and-a-half
twisting Yerchenko — doing a round-off onto the spring
board, a handspring onto the horse and a full-and-a-half
twisting layout off the horse, sticking the landing for
good measure. Senior Kendall Beck is the only other
Stanford gymnast to ever score a 10.0 on vault.
Senior Lindsay Wing won her fourth consecutive bal
ance beam title with a 9.95, tying five other gymnasts, in
cluding her senior co-captain, Caroline Fluhrer. Wing is
the only gymnast to ever win four consecutive event ti
tles in the Pac-10.
"The most exciting part of the competition was that
we didn't have our best meet." said Smyth. "It's great to
have performed as well as we did and know there's still
more that we're capable of doing."
The team hopes to peak for NCAA Nationals, which
are held on April 14-17. To qualify for nationals, the
team must finish either first or second at this weekend's
North Central regional meet in Denver. Seedings for re
gional are determined by regular-season scores; Stan

ford is ranked No. 2 and will compete against No. 11
Washington, No. 14 Denver, No. 20 lowa, Minnesota and
Southern Utah.
Smyth, who was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
after the conference meet, anticipates improvement at
regionals and nationals on vault and floor exercise. At
the Pac-10 meet, both Wing and sophomore Jessica
Louie landed short on their vaults. They have been
strong throughout the season and will work on cleaning
up their vaults this week before heading to Denver.
The team also wants to improve each floor exercise
routine by at least 0.1 points. Senior Lise Leveille, one of
the team s best on floor, had to water down her routine
at Pac-lOs due to an injured Achilles tendon, but she will
likely be back at full strength tor regionals and nationals.
The team should also be able to improve its energy
level. The conference meet was particularly challeng
ing for the gymnasts, who were fatigued after two
weeks of the team's hardest conditioning of the sea-
son. On top of physical exhaus
tion, the gymnasts were mentally
tired after taking finals just prior
to the Saturday competition.
"Coming off of dead week
and finals week, they did a
tremendous job," Smyth said.
"They had finals and we had two
of our toughest weeks of train
ing, so muscularly they're fa
tigued and mentally they're ex
tremely fatigued."
The work in and out of the gym
paid off — a week after capturing
the Pac-10 championship, six team
members earned Pac-10 All-Aca
demic honors for their achieve
ments in the classroom. Senior
Shelly Goldberg, a mechanical en

gineering major, and Fluhrer, a
civil engineering major, received
first team honors and Leveille
made second team honors. Wing,
Foley and Beck earned honorable
mention.
This is the third year that Gold
berg has earned first team all-aca
demic honors. She owns a 3.99
grade point average, the highest
GPA in Pac-10 gymnastics, and is
moreover a dreaded opponent in
team games of trivia.
"Being at Stanford, the girls'
priority is academics," Smyth
said. "They know there is life
outside of gymnastics and it's
part of the routine they've done
their whole lives."

outside of gymnastics and it's
part of the routine they've done
their whole lives."
With a Pacific-10 Conference team championship title
and the highest ranking in program history under its belt,
the No. 2 Stanford women's gymnastics team (8-3, 4-2
Pac-10) is ready to vie fora national championship.
The team won the Pac-10 championship on March 20
with a score of 197.9, continuing its four-meet winning
streak and beating out top-ranked UCLA by a mere
0.025 points. UCLA beat Stanford earlier in the season
by more than a point, but opened the door for the Cardi
nal at Pac-lOs with two major mistakes on balance beam.
Sophomore Natalie Foley led the Cardinal by capturing
the all-around title with a score of 39.8. She is the first
Stanford gymnast be crowned with that honor.
"Nat has been leading the team in the all-around all
year and she really put it together for Pac-lOs. She hit
every landing and competed with enthusiasm," said head
coach Kristen Smyth. "She does big, exciting gymnastics
and can be a contender for the all-around at nationals."

Foley also tied fora win on vault, scoring the first 10.0
of her career. She competed an explosive full-and-a-half
twisting Yerchenko — doing a round-off onto the spring
board, a handspring onto the horse and a full-and-a-half
twisting layout off the horse, sticking the landing for
good measure. Senior Kendall Beck is the only other
Stanford gymnast to ever score a 10.0 on vault.
Senior Lindsay Wing won her fourth consecutive bal
ance beam title with a 9.95, tying five other gymnasts, in
cluding her senior co-captain, Caroline Fluhrer. Wing is
the only gymnast to ever win four consecutive event ti
tles in the Pac-10.
"The most exciting part of the competition was that
we didn't have our best meet." said Smyth. "It's great to
have performed as well as we did and know there's still
more that we're capable of doing."
The team hopes to peak for NCAA Nationals, which
are held on April 14-17. To qualify for nationals, the
team must finish either first or second at this weekend's
North Central regional meet in Denver. Seedings for re
gional are determined by regular-season scores; Stan

ford is ranked No. 2 and will compete against No. 11
Washington, No. 14 Denver, No. 20 lowa, Minnesota and
Southern Utah.
Smyth, who was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year
after the conference meet, anticipates improvement at
regionals and nationals on vault and floor exercise. At
the Pac-10 meet, both Wing and sophomore Jessica
Louie landed short on their vaults. They have been
strong throughout the season and will work on cleaning
up their vaults this week before heading to Denver.
The team also wants to improve each floor exercise
routine by at least 0.1 points. Senior Lise Leveille, one of
the team s best on floor, had to water down her routine
at Pac-lOs due to an injured Achilles tendon, but she will
likely be back at full strength tor regionals and nationals.
The team should also be able to improve its energy
level. The conference meet was particularly challeng
ing for the gymnasts, who were fatigued after two
weeks of the team's hardest conditioning of the sea-
son. On top of physical exhaus
tion, the gymnasts were mentally
tired after taking finals just prior
to the Saturday competition.
"Coming off of dead week
and finals week, they did a
tremendous job," Smyth said.
"They had finals and we had two
of our toughest weeks of train
ing, so muscularly they're fa
tigued and mentally they're ex
tremely fatigued."
The work in and out of the gym
paid off — a week after capturing
the Pac-10 championship, six team
members earned Pac-10 All-Aca
demic honors for their achieve
ments in the classroom. Senior
Shelly Goldberg, a mechanical en

gineering major, and Fluhrer, a
civil engineering major, received
first team honors and Leveille
made second team honors. Wing,
Foley and Beck earned honorable
mention.
This is the third year that Gold
berg has earned first team all-aca
demic honors. She owns a 3.99
grade point average, the highest
GPA in Pac-10 gymnastics, and is
moreover a dreaded opponent in
team games of trivia.
"Being at Stanford, the girls'
priority is academics," Smyth
said. "They know there is life
outside of gymnastics and it's
part of the routine they've done
their whole lives."
