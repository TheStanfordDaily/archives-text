# Men's gym headed to NCAAs

### CARLING NGUYEN 
Can Stanford vault its way to a strong finish? Judging from recent perfor
mances and previous late-peaking seasons, the odds for Stanford's No. 8 mens
gymnastics team (3-5, 2-3 Pacific-10 Conference) at NCAAs look promising.
TTie team leaves today for the NCAA Championships, to be held April 2-4 in
Champaign, 111.
While most Stanford students were partying hard in South Beach or tak
ing outrageous road trips over spring break, the team was attending gruel
ing practices and competing in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
Championships March 19-20. The Cardinal, ranked ninth at the time, com
peted against then- No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 3 California, No. 8 Nebraska and
No. 16 Air Force.
Coming out of a long week with the stress of finals, the men still managed to
qualify for NCAAs and come out in third place, with a score of 214.675 placing
them behind California (220.225) and Oklahoma (219.600).
"Half of the guys were in finals that morning," said head coach Thom Gliel
mi. "They did a good job, stayed in the meet, and put up a solid team score."
In the first rotation, the men got off to a good start on the floor by scoring a
team score of 36.625, the second-best score for that event Friday night. Senior
captain Dan Gill scored the fourth highest score with a 9.5 and sophomore
Sean Doolan tied for fifth with a score of 9.350.
The team also competed well on the rings during the third rotation. Doing
especially well, freshman Peter Derman posted a season-high score of 9.7. At
an earlier meet this season in Michigan, one of the rings broke during Der
man's routine, forcing him to perform back-to-back routines, and he "had a
hard time recovering from that" Glielmi said. "He's gotten better and better
with each meet and has done a great job."
On the fourth rotation, the Cardinal scored the third-best score of the night
with a 36.575. Gill was Friday's top scorer in the vault with a 9.525 and Doolan
came in sixth with a 9.25.
As the final rotation approached, the pressure was on the team to execute
excellent routines on the high bar. The men rose to the challenge and re
sponded with a 36.8. Gill came out with a 9.75, the best score of the night, and
sophomore Nate Downs scored a 9.7, putting him in second place.
Glielmi is confident the team can handle the high-pressure situations.
"The guys are used to the pressure, where they know they have to hit their
routines," he said.
The team will certainly have a chance to respond to the pressure and prove
itself this weekend, especially since two of its members were injured last week.
Junior Ambert Yeung, a competitor in the floor, pommel horse and high bar
events, sustained a wrist injury and freshman Brice Rolston, one of the team's
top pommel horse competitors, suffered a neck injury.
It is unlikely that these injuries will faze Gill. He was an NCAA champion
as a sophomore and his odds for this coming weekend look good. At last week
end's MPSFs, Gill captured the all-around title and was also named MPSF
Gymnast of the Year for 2004.
"I don't think there's another all-arounder
who could beat him," Glielmi said. "He's been training very well and is very
confident with his routines. He's ready to go."
Although Stanford is ranked eighth and only the top three teams from each
of the two brackets will advance to Saturday, Gill and the rest of the team are
ready to go.
"We're going to surprise some people," junior Kelly Lang said.
