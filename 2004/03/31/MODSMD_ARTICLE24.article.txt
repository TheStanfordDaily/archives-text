Cycling
After starting the season with a third place finish in the UC-San
Diego road race, the Stanford cycling team has been racing consistent
ly well. Its next challenge is at California this weekend, and the team is
hoping to host a race nearby in the next few weeks. Though the season
is now in full swing, the team welcomes anyone at Stanford interested
in cycling to come join their daily group rides, starting from the Post
Office at 3:30 p.m. on weekdays and 9:00 a.m. on weekends.
Women's Rugby
Instead of a traditional spring break vacation, the women's rugby
team spent last week intensively training in Monterey for the upcom
ing postseason tournaments. A friendly match on Sunday ended the
week with another win in a 107-0 defeat of Radcliffe (Harvard) Rugby.
The Cardinal is currently ranked first in Northern California after a
perfect 5-0 season, and it is now looking forward to the Pacific Coast
Playoffs, to be held on campus this weekend. From there, the team
hopes to continue on to the Sweet Sixteen round of the National Cham
pionhips at Penn State April 17-18, and if all goes well, they will be back
at Stanford for the Final Four round of the Championships in May. The
Pacific Coast Playoffs can be watched at the Steuber Family Rugby
Field this Saturday and Sunday
Women's Ultimate Frisbee
At the beginning of spring break the team, Superfly, competed in
the Centex College Tournament in Austin. Texas, and came away vic
torious after two days at one of the most competitive college tourna
ments in the nation. On the first day, it faced a pool of UC-Santa Cruz,
lowa and Northwestern. Santa Cruz proved the toughest opposition,
but Stanford secured wins against all three teams and moved on to play
Brown in the next round. A 13-6 win finished the day and sent the team
through to the quarterfinals on Sunday.
The first challenge the next day was MIT, in a rematch of last year's
national championship final (which the Cardinal also won). Particularly
windy conditions led to a first half of trading upwind and downwind
points, and left Stanford trailing, 8-6, but after the break, they rallied and
came back to capture a 10-8 win. In the semifinals, the Cardinal played
Carleton, a top team against which Stanford has little experience, and
stayed ahead for the whole game. That set up a tough match in the final
against the Cardinal's biggest rival, Cal. Cal had beaten Stanford in its
last game at a tournament in San Diego, so the pressure was on. Stanford
led comfortably for most of the game until the final minutes, when it al
lowed Cal to close in. but as time ran out, Stanford held on fora 9-8 win.
Having avenged its only two losses this year, the team is looking for
ward to the upcoming college series, starting with sectionals in mid
April and then regionals in early May. If everything continues as
planned, the team will earn a spot at College Nationals in Seattle at the
end of May.
