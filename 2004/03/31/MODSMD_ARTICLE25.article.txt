# Krzyzewski questions Duhon's absence from All-Region selections
## 
### JAKE POSES THE CHRONICLE 
(U-WIRE) DURHAM. N.C. —The Duke Blue
Devils used the Monday after advancing to the Final
Four as a day for rest, planning and regrouping. Head
coach Mike Krzyzewski gave his team most of the day
off, only holding a meeting to brief his players on what
lies in the week ahead. The health and play of Chris
Duhon were in the forefront of Krzyzewski's mind
when he addressed the media Monday afternoon in
Cameron Indoor Stadium.
Krzyzewski was baffled by the absence of Duhon
on the All-Region Team, which included the At
lanta Region's Most Outstanding Player, Duke's
Luol Deng, and fellow Duke big man Shelden
Williams.
"I don't know who picks the All-Region Team down
there, but Duhon was the best player in Atlanta,"
Krzyzewski said. "Not that he needs the individual
honors, he just wants to win, but for him not [to] be
chosen for that, the game isn't being looked at the right
way. No way we would be in San Antonio without
Duhon. No way."

Even though he played 40 intense minutes during
Sunday's 66-63 victory of Xavier, Duhon — hampered
by bruised ribs following a collision with a television
camera in the ACC Championship final — said Mon
day afternoon that he was feeling as good as he has since
suffering the injury March 14. The Duke senior has
been wearing a wrap around his torso during games
along with icing, heat and stem therapy.
After practicing only sporadically during the previ
ous two weeks, Duhon plans to spend more time on the
court in the week leading up to Saturday night's na
tional semifinal. The team will practice Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday morning before departing
for San Antonio later that day. After getting a taste for
the city and enjoying a dinner out Thursday evening,
the team will then have an open practice in San Anto
nio Friday afternoon.
Duke's lack of depth has been a concern for
Krzyzewski all season and played a major role in the
Blue Devils' regional final contest. With the game close
down the stretch, the Blue Devils were forced to leave
big men Williams and Deng on the court, despite each
being only a foul away from ejection. Duke's only regu
lar post sub, Shavlik Randolph, had already fouled out.

Krzyzewski said that Williams's and Deng's experi
ence playing with fouls earlier in the season helped each
evade his fifth foul Sunday.
"I believe some of the things we've done in the regu
lar season have allowed our players to play with fouls,"
Krzyzewski said. "There's a discipline you can't learn in
practice, you have to learn it in the game."
Deng's ability to remain on the court and his 19-
point performance Sunday evening were only the tangi
ble impacts the precocious freshman had on the game.
He made an emotional halftime speech that, Krzyzews
ki said Monday, was a critical component of the team's
ability to overcome a two-point halftime deficit and ad
vance to the Final Four.
"It was somebody doing something that should be
done," Krzyzewski said. "If it's done by a player, a
coach can do the same thing, but if a player says it, it has
more impact. A lot of times people hold back feelings
and what they say and a group doesn't move forward.
We moved forward."
Moving forward is exactly what the Blue Devils will
be doing in the coming days. With the exception of
Duhon, no Duke player has Final Four experience, but
Krzyzewski, making his 10th trip to the sport's greatest

stage, will have plenty to call upon as he tries to direct
his team to a national title.
Among the tactics the Duke coach has used to help
his team adjust to the emotion of the NCAA Tourna
ment is showing the players video clips of great Duke
tournament moments. Saturday night, before the
Xavier matchup, the team viewed footage from six past
regional championship contests.
"It showed the excitement of who they played
against," Krzyzewski said. "We let them know
about the moment; you can't assume they know
about the moment. We'll do some of that before the
game Saturday."
