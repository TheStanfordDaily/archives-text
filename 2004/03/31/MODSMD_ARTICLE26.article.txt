# N.C. State cheer pumped for Nationals

### RYAN REYNOLDS TECHNICIAN 
(U-WIRE) RALEIGH, N.C. - A small
group of people stood out among the crowd
of around 400 that had accumulated in
Reynolds Coliseum around 6 p.m. on Sunday.
The group, sitting near the rafters in the
upper deck, repeatedly screamed one word in
unison that bounced off the concrete walls of
the old gym and projected to the basketball
court — "Chris!"
They were referring to North Carolina
State University cheerleading captain
Chris Gregory.
Gregory acknowledged their presence
several times, as did other cheerleaders,
but not with the enthusiasm that cheerlead
ers often have during football and basket
ball games.
That's because the 2004 National Cheer
leaders Association (NCA) Nationals are on
the horizon, and this is a serious and pres
sure-packed time for the Wolfpack cheer

leading squad.
The squad performed twice in front of the
crowd at Reynolds Coliseum, garnering a
standing ovation from many of the people in
attendance. It was one of the few opportuni
ties that parents and students could see the
cheerleaders perform before nationals.
"There was some pressure performing in
front of the crowd, and there will be even
more when we are down at nationals, but the
pressure is what makes us perform better,"
junior Jackie Piscitelli said.
NCA Nationals are set for Thursday and
Friday in Daytona Beach, Fla., and the Pack
feels its routine could earn the team a nation
al championship.
The performance is a little more than two
minutes long. Basket tosses, pyramids and
the scorpion stunt are some of the routines
performed in the stunt section.
Mistakes were rare during the first prac
tice performance on Sunday night, but by the
second go-round the Pack was even better,
seeming more comfortable and smooth

through the whole routine.
"Tumbling is definitely a step above last
year," junior Andrew George said. "No rou
tines are easier than in previous years, and
the dance and other elements are harder."
The Pack had early success in the nation
als last year, placing in first after the prelimi
nary round. But some mistakes in the final
performance dropped State to eighth place in
the final standings.
"We got real caught up in getting first, and
it was real tough because right before we
went on floor we heard Louisville's score,
and they set a record," George said. "That
dropped us down a little bit because that was
hard to beat."
Head coach Harold Trammell shows no
signs of worrying about last year's result hav
ing an effect on the 2004 national team.
"We have a lot of young people on the
team this year that don't even know what
happened last year," Trammell said. "We're
younger overall and younger people usually
bring a little bit of spark to the team."
