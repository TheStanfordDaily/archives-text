### KRISTIN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
After an intense rehearsal period that began
in January, the cast and crew of the spring musi
cal "Kiss Me Kate," presented by the Ram's
Head Theatrical Society, is fine-tuning the last
minute details before the show opens April 9.
"Kiss Me Kate" is also playing April 10, 15, 16
and 17 at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
"We had auditions for three nights in January
— each person who auditioned performed a
song, monologue and a dance —and then we
narrowed it down from that," said producer
Trang Pham, a senior. "After we selected the cast
we pretty much went straight into rehearsals four
nights a week."
"Kiss Me Kate" is actually a play within a
play, which traces the backstage feuding of two
couples performing in a rendition of Shake
speare's "The Taming of the Shrew." Fred Gra
ham and his ex-wife Lilli Vanessi take to the

stage in the leading roles of Petruchio and Kate
in Shakespeare's play. In addition, the plot also
follows former cabaret partners and lovers Bill
Calhoun and Lois Lane, who play Lucentio and
Bianca and who struggle to keep their romance
alive off-stage.
Freshmen Merritt Baer and Cindy Prieto play
Fred and Lilli, respectively. Junior Kyle Duarte
takes the role of Bill Calhoun, and senior Sasha
Cox is Lois Lane.
"The process has been really fun," Cox said.
"Ram's Head usually does a lot more modern
musicals, but I am very pleased with the return to
the big classic musical. The cast has had a lot of
fun doing the show, and we are all working hard
and rehearsing six hours a day."
Although Baer, Prieto, Duarte and Cox com
prise the four main leads, the cast includes a total
of 21 people. In addition, a crew of over 30
worked on the production backstage.
"The show is looking really great and we have
a huge set piece »hat is motorized that the audi

ence will be able to see move across the stage,"
Pham said. "We had a good group of people stay
on campus over spring break to help build and
paint the set."
Samuel and Bella Spewack wrote the libretto
for "Kiss Me Kate" and Cole Porter wrote the
music and lyrics. "Kiss Me Kate" first opened at
the New Century Theater in 1948 and closed in
1951 after over 1,000 performances. The 1999
Broadway revival of the musical claimed five
Tony Awards. According to director Lauren
Kramer, a junior. Ram's Head selected the musi
cal last May.
"A committee reviews all the potential musi
cal candidates, presents three or four choices to
membership, and membership votes," Kramer
said. "The vote is then ratified by the Ram's
Head Board."
Tickets for the show are now on sale in White
Plaza and cost $9 for students and $15 for the gen
eral public. They can also be purchased online at
