# Students ripped off by spring break trips to tropical destinations
## 
### AMANDA MUNOZ TUFTS DAILY 
(U-Wire) MEDFORD, Mass. — For students who went to tropical loca
tions for spring break, there could be worse things than a bad sunburn: get
ting ripped off.
Starting early on in the school year, posters lure students with all-inclu
sive spring break packages to destinations like Cancun and Acapulco. These
seemingly blissful and convenient packages are a college student's dream —
planning a trip without having to do much research. As many students can
attest, however, these deals often aren't exactly what they say they are.
This month, the State Public Interest Research Groups' Higher Educa
tion Project released a report, "Spring Broke: How to Avoid a Spring Break
Ripoff," that examined the deceptive advertising practices of travel compa
nies which target college students. According to the report, which surveyed
travel company posters across the country, hidden fees for each trip (usual
ly only mentioned in fine print) totaled on average up to $367 — resulting in
a trip price 62 percent higher than advertised.
After a disappointing spring break package to the Bahamas her sopho
more year, senior Ani Altoonian opted to use a travel agency to book her
spring break to the Dominican Republic this year.
"We just ended up spending a lot more money [last year] than we had an
ticipated once we got there," she said about her sophomore spring break.
Altoonian and her friends had found out about Suncoast Vacations' Ba
hamas package from posters on campus. The trip promised fun in the sun
and free drinks, but Altoonian and frie/ids had to wait in the airport for their
charter flight and the free drinks were limited.
"You thought it was [all-inclusive], but it wasn't. They said something like
20 hours of free drinks or something [but] it would end up being that the bar
that had the free drinks was across the island, you had to take a cab to get
there, and once you got there, there was 1000 people there and you get one
drink before they ran out."
For the same reasons, senior Mike Stevenson booked his vacation to Ja
maica with a travel agent and not a travel company. "It was all-inclusive,"
Stevenson said about his spring break package. "If we had wanted to stay on
the resort the whole time, we wouldn't have had to spend any extra money
at all."
Not all spring break deals are a nightmare, however. Sophomore Sarah
Feldberg enjoyed her sunny spring break, which she booked with Student
Travel Agency (STA) that uses Student Travel Services (STS) once they ar
rived in Jamaica. Her $807 package included the flight, airport shuttle, and
hotel with additional food and drink options. Her group opted for the $160
drink package, which Feldberg says was worth the extra money.
"It was really nice not having to carry lots of cash or pay cover charges,"
Feldberg said. "Looking back it probably would have been worth it to do the
food too."
For students who don't plan on drinking heavily every night of their
week-long trip, however, such drink packages may not be worth the cost."It
was a good deal as long as you are crazy enough to drink that much," sopho
more Jessica Brauser, who also went on Feldberg's trip, added.
Many services, such as STS, offer additional deals once students have ar
rived at their spring break destination. In Jamaica, for example, excursions
such as climbing waterfalls and jumping off cliffs or the "booze cruise" are
offered and range in price from and extra $25 to $65 extra dollars. Once on
vacation, students are often eager to see and to do as much as possible, giv
ing these services the chance to reel in even more money.
According to sophomore Gabby Lubart, who also went to Jamaica, it
may have been cheaper to plan the excursion themselves. "We probably
could have saved some money by renting our own bus," Lubart said. She
added, however, that the safety of having a guided trip and chaperones made
it worth the extra cost.
According to the report, "In addition to deceptive pricing, companies
also require travelers to give up many of their rights. Travel companies re
serve the right to change travel and accommodation plans at their discretion.
In addition, companies require travelers to sign contracts in which they must
waive or limit their legal rights to file disputes with the travel company."
