# Porn mail sent to Princeton Class of 1994
## 
### NATASHA DEGEN THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-Wire) PRINCETON, N.J. — Cut-and
pasted pornography and a forged Princeton
University document are only two parts of a
drama facing the Class of 1994 and the Uni
versity after several illicit mailings were sent
to members of the class.
Several months ago, a letter was sent to the
Class of 1994 containing pornographic repre
sentations of several of their classmates, said
four members of the class.
After a second mailing — on letterhead
from the University's Alumni Council office
and purportedly signed by General Counsel
Peter McDonough — the University began an
investigation to determine the "origin of the
letters and the extent of the mailing," Univer
sity Counsel Clayton Marsh said.
The University may take legal action.
Several members of the Class of 1994 — in
addition to inquiries by The Daily Princetoni
an — have suggested that one person is be
hind the letters. But, agreeing to a request by
the University, the 'Prince' is not publishing
that person's name or the names of those men
tioned in the letters at this time.
The first letter included "mug shots" of

members of the Class of 1994 "that seemed to
be taken from a yearbook or facebook" and
pasted onto pornographic images with offen
sive captions, 1994 graduate Tamar Laddy
said.
A second letter dated Jan. 29 was sent on
Alumni Council letterhead under the guise of
a memorandum from McDonough.
"At first the letter looked very official," a
'94 alumnus said, "but as you read [the letter],
it devolves, using nonprofessional syntax and
wording and making bizarre accusations. My
first impression was just 'what the hell?'"
This false letter included accusations tar
geted at specific members of the Class of 1994,
assigning blame for the mailing of the first let
ter and accusing others of having homosexual
affairs.
Marsh characterized the letter as a series of
"false and defamatory statements" and en
sured "Peter McDonough did not write it. It is
a complete fabrication."
After being informed of the forgery by re
cipients of the letter, Marg&ret Miller, direc
tor of the alumni association, issued a re
sponse on March 4, stating: "The University is
investigating the matter on an expedited basis
and is exploring appropriate legal and other
actions."

"We are taking this matter seriously,"
Miller said. "This letter is offensive and inap
propriate."
One member of the Class of 1994 was
pleased with the rapid response.
"I was glad to receive the follow-up letter
and hear that the University was investigat
ing," Laddy said. "The letters were truly
shocking and very offensive."
Though Director of Communications Lau
ren Robinson-Brown and Marsh declined to
comment on the status of the investigation or
the suspected author of the letters, some
members of the Class of 1994 said they know
who is responsible for the mailings.
Some members of the Class of *94 also said
that they immediately recognized the letter as
fake and disregarded its allegations.
"Obviously whoever wrote it was not think
ing correctly," one '94 alum said. "Everyone
assumes that none of it is true. I think every
one just wants it to stop."
Other 1994 alumni, however, were disap
pointed that such misappropriations were cir
culated on the eve of their 10th class reunion.
"It's very upsetting that someone from
Princeton would do something like this,"
Laddy said.
