# Student initiated courses reach record high; offer a variety of off-beat topics

### ALBERT CHIOU STAFF WRITER 
This spring, Student Initiated Courses
(SICs) will once again serve as the last bas
tion for students interested in learning
about subjects such as bicycle repair, U.S.
cybersecurity and Western U.S. fire policy.
Designed and run by students, the one- to
two-unit SICs cover topics that are under
represented or nonexistent in Stanford's
curriculum. Other SICs for this quarter in
clude classes on children's literature, the
Beatles, archery and the Koran.
In order to get an SIC approved, stu
dents must go through a rigorous selection
process. Students looking to teach an SIC
must first submit a proposal that includes
both a detailed syllabus and a letter of spon
sorship from a faculty member. Afterward,
the students must attend a series of four
workshops organized by the Center for

Teaching and Learning on teaching skills,
course design and service learning. Finally,
the proposal goes before the SICs faculty
committee. If it is approved, then the course
is offered in the next quarter.
One reason for the stringent selection
process for courses is to weed out prospec
tive student teachers who are not serious
about the job.
"SICs are a major time commitment,"
said junior Karan Mahajan, one of this
year's SIC coordinators. "Students must
be willing to dedicate themselves to de
signing lectures, keeping in touch with
faculty sponsors and carrying out course
responsibilities. Because the application
process is rigorous, this is, in many ways, a
self-selecting process."
SICs continue to thrive at Stanford, de
spite the special fees issues that plague
many other student programs. Both SIC
coordinators have stated that the program

has not experienced any budget problems.
A total of 14 courses are being offered this
quarter, and each can draw up to $1,000
for operating costs.
"The standard Stanford curriculum, al
beit vast, cannot possible cover all areas
and subjects," Mahajan said. "SIC allows
students to identify the gaps in the cur
riculum and fill them in a systematic way."
Many SICs are designed to explore
real-world situations and scenarios.
"SIC gives students the means to re
spond to recent events in a unique and ef
fective way," Mahajan said. "Faculy mem
bers are unable to initiate courses on short
notice due to departmental restrictions
and timelines.
The SIC program publicizes classes
through flyers, Daily ads and e-mail.
Many of the courses are also listed in the
time schedule and are signified with the
suffix "SI."
