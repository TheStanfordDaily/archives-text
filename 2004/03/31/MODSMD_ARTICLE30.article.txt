# Scientists discuss shifts in climate
## 
### JULIE CARSON COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK — Scientists widely
agree on the fact and causes of climate change.
Politicians, however, do not. Speakers at the
State of the Planet Conference at Columbia Uni
versity held on Monday night focused on the ways
the environment and the political realm interact.
"There is a problem with the credibility of
science," Harvard Professor and Director of
Geochemical Oceanography Daniel Schrag
said, "when decades of testimony by top scien
tists to the Senate on climate change has con
vinced less than half of the senators."
While the scientists did not shy away from the
details of the science behind the modern con
sensus, the most pressing focus of the day was
political: how to implement changes. Numerous
speakers warned that we are at a critical point in
our manipulation of the earth's climate, and that
our action over the next 10 years will determine
our ability to recover from the current level of
destruction in the coming century.
Chief Scientist of the World Bank Robert
Watson discussed the grounds on which the
United States refuses to implement the Kyoto
protocol, an agreement signed by 160 nations in
1997, which mandates reductions in carbon
emissions by developed countries. President
George W. Bush withdrew from the treaty in
2001. A main reason the United States govern
ment has cited is scientific uncertainty regarding
climate change. The government, Watson said
to applause, employs the precautionary princi
ple in all of its international relations, but not in

environmental standards.
Mary Robinson, the former president of Ire
land and new Columbia faculty member, and
Jeffrey Sachs, the director of Columbia's Earth
Institute, also spoke. The problem, Schrag
scathingly empathized, is, "How do you plan
and make change for something that lasts longer
than an election cycle?" The hindrance to action
is most convincingly economic, and this problem
was tackled in different ways by the speakers.
The economic issue behind climate change is
two-fold; on the one hand is the poverty caused
and exacerbated by such effects of climate
change as destruction of ecosystems, extreme
weather events, and dislocating rises in sea level
caused by melting glaciers, which are caused in
turn by global warming. On the other hand is the
risk and cost involved in transferring the current
energy industry of oil and coal to an industry of
renewable energy. Beyond that is the economics
of damage control, how much it will cost to pro
tect vital resources and sequester carbon.
All of the speakers were optimistic about the
economic feasibility of renewable energy and
resource protection. The numbers for enacting
these goals were repeatedly put in context of
government spending. Harvard Professor, Ed
ward Q. Wilson, who has won a Pulitzer Prize
and a National Medal of Science, compared the
estimated $28 billion that it would take to pro
tect key ecosystems to the $87 billion being
spent on restructuring Iraq, or the $250 billion
spent on tax cuts.
Watson stressed that there is no dichotomy
between the economic growth and renewable
energy. In response to a question regarding the

World Bank's support of projects which perpet
uate climate change, he admitted that we cannot
expect developing countries to use more expen
sive energy sources. There are, he explained,
cost-effective and equitable solutions to climate
change, but political will and moral leadership is
needed; the United States and other developing
countries must make changes first, he said.
Over-consumption and misuse of energy is
the perpetrator of climate change, which lands
the responsibility for setting a path towards
change on the shoulders of the wealthy coun
tries like America, the speakers said. While
some would agree with this standard of respon
sibility, Schrag presented a different standard of
engagement in reform based on models of pro
jected results. Even if the United States were to
completely sequester — store or chemically
transform — carbon there would be an insuffi
cient drop in carbon levels. Reversing the trend
toward global warming requires the internation
al effort which the Kyoto treaty began, he said.
The direction of American environmental
policy frustrated many of the conference's
speakers. The Senate is ready to vote again on
the previously filibustered energy bill, which
was vehemently denounced by Watson, who
called for fundamental market reform and the
elimination of "perverse subsidies." The Repub
lican-supported Energy Bill includes billions of
dollars in subsidies to the oil, coal, and logging
industries. Policies like this were denounced by
the scientific community at the conference as ig
noring the evidence of climate change and the
uncertain future our planet faces as a result.
