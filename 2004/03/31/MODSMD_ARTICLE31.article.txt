# Antibiotic use for common diseases linked to breast cancer
## 
### YARA SOUZA THE DAILY AZTEC 
(U-WIRE) SAN DIEGO —Strep
throat, acne, urinary tract infections and
ear infections are just a few among many
ailments routinely remedied with a variety
of antibiotics, the very method of treat
ment that has become increasingly popu
lar in the United States.
A newly released study, however, has
raised a red flag on antibiotic use, linking
it with an increased risk for breast cancer.
The study, published in the Feb. 18
issue of the Journal of the American Med
ical Association, states an increased risk
of incident breast cancer was associated
with increasing cumulative days of antibi
otic use.
Researchers from the University of
Washington and the Group Health Coop
erative in Seattle conducted a case-control
study among 2,266 women over the age of
19 with invasive, or having a tendency to
spread, breast cancer and 7,953 women
who do not have breast cancer, as stated
on JAMA's Web site, www.jama.ama
assn.org.

Researchers found women who took
any antibiotics for at least 501 days over a
17-year period were twice as likely to de
velop breast cancer as compared with
those who did not take any. The more pills
taken, the higher the risk was, according
to www.ninemsn.com.
An article about the study on the same
Web site also stated, "Women who took up
to 500 antibiotics over the same period
were 1.5 times more likely to develop this
type of cancer as non-users."
According to The New York Times, the
authors of the study clarified their finding
as "an association, not a causal link."
"This is potentially worrisome, but we
don't know why this connection exists —
we only have an observation," Dr. John
Potter, an author of the report and director
of the division of public health sciences at
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, Wash., stated on
www.nytimes.com.
"At the moment, we need to see these
results replicated with more research be
fore drawing any conclusions."
The study's immediate association
should also be considered against other

variables, since it doesn't answer several
questions, according to San Diego State bi
ology experts.
"The scientists are cautious about mak
ing conclusions, which is appropriate, but it
would be incorrect to conclude from this ar
ticle that x number of years using antibiotics
will increase the risk of breast cancer," biol
ogy professor Bruce Wingerd said.
Wingerd said the study didn't look at a
significant number of subjects and there
were no controlled experiments, since data
was controlled by asking patients questions.
People can misrepresent the truth, or there
may have been other factors influencing the
responses, such as diet, exercise or family
history that was not factored, he said.
"The study showed a possible connec
tion between long-term antibiotic use and
breast cancer risk, pointing to the need for
controlled experiments to evaluate it more
carefully," Wingerd said.
Undeclared San Diego State University
sophomore Laurel Butcher said she's con
stantly on antibiotics and is concerned by
the study's findings.
"It's scary that I might have an increased
risk in breast cancer, especially to hear

about these links and also knowing breast
cancer runs in my family," Butcher said.
According to www.cnn.com, the study's
authors said more research is needed be
cause the diseases women used antibiotics
to treat could have been what increased
their breast cancer risk, rather than the
drugs themselves.
"The point to be made is that there are
many cellular and possibly environmental
triggers to the development of breast can
cer," biology professor Bob Pozos said.
"The point that the women in the study
were taking antibiotics for such a long time
is interesting in itself.
"This suggests that possibly they had
other underlying problems, such as an al
tered immune response."
Lead author of the study and researcher
at Group Health Cooperative Christine
Velicer stated on www.cnn.com that the
medications' effects on intestinal bacteria
could change the body's way of metaboliz
ing foods cancer preventive foods as one
theory of antibiotic use increasing breast
cancer risk.
Potter suggested on www.nytimes.com
that women who use antibiotics more often

are naturally predisposed to breast cancer
because they have hormonal imbalances.
Student Health Services Medical Di
rector Dr. Gregg Lichtenstein questioned
antibiotics' presence in food as another
point to be considered in the association.
"Antibiotics are unfortunately used
rather indiscriminately in the food indus
try, both to prevent infections and to in
crease growth rates of certain animals,"
Lichtenstein said. "Although I encourage
patients to avoid antibiotics as much as
possible, frequently antibiotics are more
effective than other therapies."
He compared using Accutane — "an
expensive drug with many potential im
mediate side effects" — with using antibi
otics to treat acne.
"It's well-known that there is a tenden
cy to use these drugs against the common
cold and other things they're not effective
for," Potter stated on www.nytimes.com.
"What we found should not be used as ev
idence to base medical or health policy de
cisions on, but it is a reminder about mis
using antibiotics."
