# University of Maryland legislation to protect transgendered students

### KATE SLUSARK THE DIAMONDBACK 
(U-WIRE) COLLEGE PARK, Md. —The Univer
sity of Maryland Student Government Association re
cently passed legislation to protect transgendered stu
dents in response to the state Attorney General's office's
decision last month that nixed a similar university-wide
policy.
In a 27-1 vote, the Student Government Association
decided last Wednesday to include language in its bylaws
to prevent SGA-funded student groups from discrimi
nating against transgendered students — students who
identify themselves as the opposite gender or have had a
sex-change operation. The new language protects trans
gendered people under the clauses "gender identity" and
"gender expression."
Groups that violate the code will have their SGA
funding revoked.
Last month, the University Senate unanimously voted

to include language protecting transgendered people on
the campus under the human relations code. The initia
tive was nixed, however, when the state Attorney Gen
eral's office said it would not approve the change because
of a lack of similar legislation in the city, county or state
governments.
"In essence this is a response to that," said SGA Com
mons Legislator Stuart McPhail. "Hopefully the Attor
ney General will rethink their opinion."
The only person who voted against the bill was Engi
neering Legislator Mike Mintz. Mintzsaid he felt the dis
cussion surrounding the bill, though not the wording it
self, was more about accepting the transgender commu
nity on the campus than protecting its rights.
"The purpose of the bill was more to embrace the
transsexual community as a desired part of community
than to protect their rights," Mintz said. "So 1 sort of felt
it's not the SG A's position to embrace this community as
a desired part of our larger community. I haven't decid
ed what I think about transsexuals, but 1 just don't feel

comfortable making that decision for the student body."
BSOS Legislator Xiaolin Li voted in favor of the bill.
"If you believe in equal rights for all races, if you be
lieve in equal rights for all religions, you should believe
in equal rights for all genders," she said.
Students working for the policy change at the univer
sity level were pleased with the SGA's initiative.
"I think it shows that the SGA wants to take a stand
beyond a political stance in support of the issue by actu
ally augmenting their own policy," senior government
and politics major Ashton Phillips said.
Phillips said he plans to pursue transgender rights be
yond the SGA and keep working to see the university in
cludes protections in its human relations code, despite
the initial roadblock. He said he is willing to try to change
county policy so the Attorney General's office could not
refuse the university's change.
"I look forward to continuing to fight for this right and
taking that fight to P.G. County if need be," Phillips said.
