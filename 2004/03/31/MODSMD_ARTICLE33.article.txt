# University of Minnesota gives students the old-fashioned sex talk
## 
### HAYLEY ODOM MINNESOTA DAILY 
(U-WIRE) MINNEAPOLIS —University
members gathered in Lind Hall Monday to talk
about sex.
Jodi O'Brien, a professor of sociology at Seattle
University, lectured on "sexual silence and shame
and good old American values" to a crowd of ap
proximately 30 people.
O'Brien focused on explaining U.S. culture's
simultaneous obsession with and repression by the

topic of sexuality. She said this idea helps explain
how today's sex-based controversies play out in
U.S. society.
"Sexual imagery is absolutely everywhere and
at the same time (society) is only being educated
with abstinence," O'Brien said.
She said sexuality defines the role people play
in society.
''The sex story contains a recipe for what you can
and can't do," she said. "You can't be feminine and
a good father or a sex worker and a good mother."
O'Brien also spoke about how institutions such

as religion and family values muddy the realms of
sexuality and produce boundaries that separate
people with different sexual representations, beliefs
and ideas.
"In our society homosexuality is acceptable as
long as the person afflicted wears a cloak of shame,"
she said.
"The assumption is that being straight is a default
condition and that you aspire to be a part of that fam
ily equation," she said "The attempt to separate sex
by the family equation indicates a shaky institution."
O'Brien's lecture drew students from many

University departments who had vested interests in
the issues discussed.
Aaron Bruenger, a graduate student with a
minor in literacy and rhetorical studies, said he
came to the lecture because of his interest in the
rhetoric of sexuality and gender.
Senior Nicole Relyea attended the lecture be
cause she is taking a cultural studies class on sexu
ality and culture. She said she liked that O'Brien
actually answered questions about sexuality. In
her class, Relyea said, students often just sit and
ponder answers.

"These are very liberal ideas and a lot has to
be said for the conservativism of our country "
she said.
The Center for Writing brought O'Brien in as
part of the annual speaker series for the interdis
ciplinary graduate minor in literacy and rhetori
cal studies, said Susan Meyers, the center's assis
tant director.
She said O'Brien's ability to create classroom
like discussions about controversial issues was an
important draw for including her in the series.
