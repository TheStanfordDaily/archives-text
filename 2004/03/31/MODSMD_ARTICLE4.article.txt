# Grad students, postdocs oppose Bush's use of scientific research
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to expose what it describes as the U.S.
presidential administration's misrepresentation of scien
tific research, a group of graduate students and postdoc
toral fellows have created an online petition to bring the
issue to the public's attention. The group is urging envi
ronmental scientists nationwide to sign the petition.
The petition — located at http://scienceinpolicy.org
— is similar to the statements released by the Union of
Concerned Scientists last month. Twenty Nobel laure
ates signed the statement, asserting that President
George W. Bush's administration manipulates scientific
findings to support its political goals, especially in light of
the upcoming election. While the White House hasn't is
sued a response to the Stanford petition. Presidential

Science Adviser John Marburger said that the union's
accusations were unfounded.
Fourteen Stanford students initiated the petition last
spring and launched the Web site in December. Since
then, they have collected 1491 signatures, including 290
professors, 133 postdoctoral fellows, 708 graduate stu
dents, as well as 41 government scientists from agencies
ranging from the National Forest Service to the U.S. Ge
ological Survey.
"Our effort is not specifically about policy," said Paul
Higgins, co-founder of scienceinpolicy.org who received
his doctorate from Stanford. "It is about the misuse and
misrepresentation of science in creating and defending
these policies. Science provides objective information
that can inform policy makers and the general public.
However, this administration is abusing scientific values
in many different ways."

Higgins' partner, co-founder Steve Porder, a fourth
year doctoral candidate in the Department of Biological
Sciences, concurs that the Bush administration is un
precedented in the extent to which science has been ma
nipulated for political means. He said that he hopes the
petition will make both the scientific community and pub
lic more aware of the validity of environmental policies.
"We hope to prod the scientific community to take
greater interest in defending science from the manipula
tions of political spin-doctors," Porder said. "We hope to
convince the public that the misuse of science is an im
portant issue that they should pay attention to."
According to Porder, the influence of the petition is de
pendent on the number of signatures they gather and the
amount of press the effort can attract. To encourage more
members of the scientific community to sign, the authors
of the petition have written editorials and letters to the ed

itors, including a piece that appeared in Nature magazine.
"I believe that many actions by the current adminis
tration are purposefully made to seem environmentally
friendly, when in fact they tend to have corporate inter
ests at heart," said Heather Galindo, a second-year doc
toral student who helped write the petition. "This gener
al attitude does not only occur at the federal level and it
is important to hold state and local governments ac
countable for their actions as well. The current environ
mental issues are by no means wholly the responsibility
of the Bush administration, but I do believe they are
doing far more harm than good with their policies."
Specifically, the organizers of scienceinpolicy.org are
concerned about climate change, air and water pollution,
and forest management and oil exploration in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
According to the group's Web site.
Bush made a critical error is disregard
ing the United Nation's prediction that
the Earth's surface temperature will
rise between 2.7 and 10.4 degrees
Fahrenheit by the year 2100. In addi
tion. the site states that the administra
tion has inaccurately judged the amount
of accessible oil in Alaska and the dam
age that would be caused by drilling.
Galindo said she believes that poli
cies titled "Healthy Forests" and "Clear
Skies" are designed to confuse voters
and convince them that actions are
being taken to preserve the environ
ment when that is not the case. She also

said that the administration has inten
tionally overlooked important scientific
information.
"In particular I think the idea of scien
tific uncertainty is unfairly used to discred
it valid research," Galindo said. "Contrast
this with the federal government's military
policy in which uncertainty does not stand
in the way of preemptive action."
Biological sciences postdoctoral student
Kai Chan, the petition's author, said that
the effort is geared toward scientists he
cause they know that good policies are con
tingent on thorough understanding of sci
entific evidence in consideration with ethi
cal and economic issues.
"Scientists should support our efforts
because they are the only ones with the
technical knowledge to recognize when sci
ence is being abused," Chan said. "As citi
zens with that power, they have the respon

sibility to defend the public interest by pub
licizing such abuses. We provide an outlet
for that."
Porder maintains that the petition in
nonpartisan.
"We felt this should be publicized be
fore voters went to the polls in November,"
he said. "However, whomever wins the
election, we will continue to focus on the
use of science by U.S. administrations."
As far as goals for the future, Chan said
he would like to see the group's efforts re
sult in new legislation that would protect
the integrity of science in policymaking or
the creation of a watchdog organization
that would monitor how politicians pre
sent scientific knowledge.
"The administration appears to want
the public to believe that President Bush's
policies are supported by the best available
science," Porder said. "That just isn't true."

policies are supported by the best available
science," Porder said. "That just isn't true."
In an effort to expose what it describes as the U.S.
presidential administration's misrepresentation of scien
tific research, a group of graduate students and postdoc
toral fellows have created an online petition to bring the
issue to the public's attention. The group is urging envi
ronmental scientists nationwide to sign the petition.
The petition — located at http://scienceinpolicy.org
— is similar to the statements released by the Union of
Concerned Scientists last month. Twenty Nobel laure
ates signed the statement, asserting that President
George W. Bush's administration manipulates scientific
findings to support its political goals, especially in light of
the upcoming election. While the White House hasn't is
sued a response to the Stanford petition. Presidential

Science Adviser John Marburger said that the union's
accusations were unfounded.
Fourteen Stanford students initiated the petition last
spring and launched the Web site in December. Since
then, they have collected 1491 signatures, including 290
professors, 133 postdoctoral fellows, 708 graduate stu
dents, as well as 41 government scientists from agencies
ranging from the National Forest Service to the U.S. Ge
ological Survey.
"Our effort is not specifically about policy," said Paul
Higgins, co-founder of scienceinpolicy.org who received
his doctorate from Stanford. "It is about the misuse and
misrepresentation of science in creating and defending
these policies. Science provides objective information
that can inform policy makers and the general public.
However, this administration is abusing scientific values
in many different ways."

Higgins' partner, co-founder Steve Porder, a fourth
year doctoral candidate in the Department of Biological
Sciences, concurs that the Bush administration is un
precedented in the extent to which science has been ma
nipulated for political means. He said that he hopes the
petition will make both the scientific community and pub
lic more aware of the validity of environmental policies.
"We hope to prod the scientific community to take
greater interest in defending science from the manipula
tions of political spin-doctors," Porder said. "We hope to
convince the public that the misuse of science is an im
portant issue that they should pay attention to."
According to Porder, the influence of the petition is de
pendent on the number of signatures they gather and the
amount of press the effort can attract. To encourage more
members of the scientific community to sign, the authors
of the petition have written editorials and letters to the ed

itors, including a piece that appeared in Nature magazine.
"I believe that many actions by the current adminis
tration are purposefully made to seem environmentally
friendly, when in fact they tend to have corporate inter
ests at heart," said Heather Galindo, a second-year doc
toral student who helped write the petition. "This gener
al attitude does not only occur at the federal level and it
is important to hold state and local governments ac
countable for their actions as well. The current environ
mental issues are by no means wholly the responsibility
of the Bush administration, but I do believe they are
doing far more harm than good with their policies."
Specifically, the organizers of scienceinpolicy.org are
concerned about climate change, air and water pollution,
and forest management and oil exploration in Alaska's
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
According to the group's Web site.
Bush made a critical error is disregard
ing the United Nation's prediction that
the Earth's surface temperature will
rise between 2.7 and 10.4 degrees
Fahrenheit by the year 2100. In addi
tion. the site states that the administra
tion has inaccurately judged the amount
of accessible oil in Alaska and the dam
age that would be caused by drilling.
Galindo said she believes that poli
cies titled "Healthy Forests" and "Clear
Skies" are designed to confuse voters
and convince them that actions are
being taken to preserve the environ
ment when that is not the case. She also

said that the administration has inten
tionally overlooked important scientific
information.
"In particular I think the idea of scien
tific uncertainty is unfairly used to discred
it valid research," Galindo said. "Contrast
this with the federal government's military
policy in which uncertainty does not stand
in the way of preemptive action."
Biological sciences postdoctoral student
Kai Chan, the petition's author, said that
the effort is geared toward scientists he
cause they know that good policies are con
tingent on thorough understanding of sci
entific evidence in consideration with ethi
cal and economic issues.
"Scientists should support our efforts
because they are the only ones with the
technical knowledge to recognize when sci
ence is being abused," Chan said. "As citi
zens with that power, they have the respon

sibility to defend the public interest by pub
licizing such abuses. We provide an outlet
for that."
Porder maintains that the petition in
nonpartisan.
"We felt this should be publicized be
fore voters went to the polls in November,"
he said. "However, whomever wins the
election, we will continue to focus on the
use of science by U.S. administrations."
As far as goals for the future, Chan said
he would like to see the group's efforts re
sult in new legislation that would protect
the integrity of science in policymaking or
the creation of a watchdog organization
that would monitor how politicians pre
sent scientific knowledge.
