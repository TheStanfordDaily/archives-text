Susan Moller Okin, a well-known feminist thinker
and Ethics in Society professor, died on March 3 at age
57 in her home in Lincoln, Mass. Although the cause of
death was not released, her ex-husband. Bob Okin,
said that possibilities of suicide and foul play have
been eliminated.
A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. on Mon
day, April 19 at Memorial Church.
After her arrival at Stanford in 19W, Okin worked
to examine the suppression of the female voice in
Western political thought. Attacking gender issues
from the perspective of political philosophy, she re
searched and published papers evaluating the role and
participation of women in political arenas. In this spir
it she published three books including "Women in
Western Political Thought."
"Susan Okin really did revolutionize the field of
political theory in that she made it impossible for po
litical theorists not to ask questions about justice,
gender and the family," said Robert Reich, an assis
tant professor of political science. "She began from
the simple position that men and women were equals
and that in a just world there would be no such thing
as gender."
According to Okin. women's work in the domestic
sphere largely made men's accomplishments in the

public sphere possible. She was interested in how po
litical thought was relevant to issues of the home and
family, especially ideas of law and justice. She made
the case that historical philosophy needs to be revisit
ed to reflect the large influence women had on the evo
lution of society.
"Most philosophers treated the family as a black
box and paid little attention to the relationships be
tween individuals within the family," said Debra
Satz, an associate professor of philosophy. "Okin
held that this perspective was incompatible with the
ideals of liberalism, which views all human beings as
free and equal individuals. She held that relations
within the family were the linchpin of gender in
equality in society."
In recent years Okin became increasingly interest
ed in applying her ideas to real-world situations, espe
cially in developing countries. In January she traveled
to India with representatives from the Global Fund for
Women, a San Francisco-based nonprofit organiza
tion that aims to improve the lives of women living in
poverty, Reich said.
"She resolved to make even more effort to champi
on very simple policies that would have dramatic ef
fects on women and children in developing countries,
to ensure that girls received an education, to drastical
ly reduce the number of families who live on less than
$2 a day and so on," Reich said.
At the time of her death Okin was working as a

visiting professor at Harvard University on a one
year fellowship. She had become interested in
looking at evolutionary biology through a femi
nist lens.
Okin received many academic awards during her
life, including the Allan V. Cox Medal for Faculty Ex
cellence in Fostering Undergraduate Research.
"In the projects she pursued these last years at
Stanford, 1 think one point which stands out is how
much she wanted her work in political theory to en
gage with the plight of real people," Satz said. "She
was especially concerned with how policies at the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
wrought unintended damages on women and chil
dren and worsened not only their plight, but also
the more long-term prospects for economic and so
cial development."
Born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1946, Okin
earned her bachelor's degree from the University of
Auckland, a master's in philosophy from Oxford and a
doctorate from Harvard. She served as the director of
the Ethics in Society program from 1993 to 1996.
"1 think that she was personally courageous both
in her work and in her outspokenness whenever she
believed someone had been done an injustice," Satz
said. "At the same time, she was an accomplished
cook, a gardener, knitter, skier and friend to many
people. I think she lived her life very fully."
Okin is survived by her daughter, son and two sisters.
