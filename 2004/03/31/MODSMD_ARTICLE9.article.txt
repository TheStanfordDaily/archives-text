## Sisterly love New Asian-American sorority makes debut 
### KATIE BEARMAN 
After extensive meetings
with University administra
tors, the Sigma Psi Zeta
sorority (SYZ), has official
ly emerged this year as an
un-housed, Asian-Ameri
can sorority at Stanford. If
the high attendance at
SYZ's first party a few
weekends ago is any indica
tion, many people are excit
ed about the establishment
of a Sigma Psi Zeta chapter
on the Farm.
Talk of the new sorority,
however, has been surround
ed by substantial confusion
and criticism because Alpha
Kappa Delta Phi (KDPhi),
another Asian-American
sorority, already has a chap
ter on campus. Indeed, some
students see SYZ as a super
fluous addition to Stanford's
Greek community.
Excited about their up
coming events and deter
mined to enhance life at Stan
ford for all students, the sis
ters of SYZ regard the estab
lishment of their sorority as
anything but unnecessary.
Stanford has a large Asian
population, and the SYZ sis
ters do not think that one
Asian-American sorority can
satisfy the needs of all Asian
women who are interested in
participating in Greek life.
As junior Jenny Truong, a
member of SYZ said, "There
is a large Asian American
population here but a dispro
portionately small number of
Greek organizations for
Asian Americans."
Senior Yvonne Hung,
one of the founders of Stan
ford's SYZ chapter, said
that the sorority is working
on "establishing themselves
as an important organiza
tion since there is already
an Asian American sorority
at Stanford.
"Sigma Psi Zeta is hoping
to work in cooperation rather

than in competition with
KDPhi to build a stronger
Asian American community
as a whole," she continued.
SYZ wants to create
unity rather than division
within the Asian American
population on campus, ac
cording to Hung.
Although Stanford's
chapter of SYZ does not cur
rently have any non-Asian
members, the sorority is 10
percent non-Asian on a na
tional scale. Stanford's SYZ
chapter anticipates being
able match this figure in the
future. Indeed, the SYZ sis
ters believe that their sorority
is different from many Greek
organizations on campus be
cause one of their top priori
ties is promoting interaction
between ethnic and non eth
nic Greek groups.
Additionally, SYZ wants
to create connections with
the student body in general.
"SYZ wants to fight the
stereotypes of 'Asian cliques'
by forming an Asian-Ameri
can sorority that cohesively
and enthusiastically reaches
out to the Stanford commu
nity," Hung said.
SYZ is also working to
expose and promote the di
versity within the Asian
community at Stanford.
This quarter, they are plan
ning to participate in the
Taiwanese Cultural Society
Market Night, the Asian
American Student Associa
tion Extravaganza and the
Asian Pacific Islander Her
itage Week. They have also
organized mixers and com
munity service projects
with other non-ethnic fra
ternities and sororities.
Currently, the sorority is
putting much effort into plan
ning "Take Back the Night"
— an annual walk that ac
knowledges victims of date
rape. The sorority highly val
ues community service and
has chosen to focus the ma

jority of their attention on is
sues of domestic violence.
"Domestic violence is a
very pertinent problem both
in the Asian community, with
its roots in traditional Asian
culture, and at Stanford,"
Hung said. "All Asian-
American sororities aim to
unite women and to fight the
problems that Asian Ameri
can women face in society.
Likewise, SYZ also aims to
project a strong image of
Asian American women
both on and off campus."
Because women are
often victimized dispropor
tionately by domestic vio
lence and because issues
such as date rape under
mine women's power and
success, the sorority is
working to raise awareness
about these topics at Stan
ford, says Hung.
"Dating 101: Pick-up
Lines, Parties and Picking the
Right One" is another SYZ
event that will provide infor
mation and facilitate discus
sions about domestic vio
lence, date rape and sexual
assault. In addition to ad
dressing these issues, the
workshop will talk about dat
ing in general at Stanford.
Along with the SYZ sis
ters, there will be a panel of
representatives from the
Stanford Police Department,
the Women's Center and var
ious upperclassmen at the
event. Although the work
shop is geared toward fresh
men, all are welcome to at
tend. Dating 101, complete
with lunch and prizes, will
take place on Saturday, April
3 from noon to 2 p.m. in
FloMo Lounge.
Stanford Rush is rapidly
approaching. Because SYZ
is new on campus and
wants to attract as many

potential members as pos
sible, it is holding two
Rushes and selecting two
pledge classes this year in
both winter and spring.
"SYZ's selection process
tries to view each girl who
Rushes as an individual,"
Hung said. "Quality over
quantity is the sorority's
overall goal. Of course, not
all who Rush accept our
bids, but we understand
that it is both our selection
process and theirs. The
Rush process aims to find
the best mutual fit."
SYZ tried to plan Rush
events every day of the week
to avoid overlapping with
other sororities' Rush events,
and the upperclassmen are
going to do their best to get to
know each of the girls who
Rush as well as possible dur
ing the week. Besides the im
portant general information
meeting, the SYZ sisters are
especially excited about
Rush events that promote
mingling and bonding among
actives and "Rushees" such
as their facial night.
Combining community
service, support for women
and creative events to unite
the Stanford community, the
SYZ sisters are beginning to
contribute significantly to
Greek life on campus. Hung
and her friends have enjoyed
the process of starting a new
sorority because it has given
them "the power to choose
what they want to do and
what they believe in."
"The sorority aims to do
great things and to provide
support for their sisters and
the community," Truong
said. "They would like to
work, along with other or
ganizations, to create a bet
ter picture for the whole
student body."

both on and off campus."
Because women are
often victimized dispropor
tionately by domestic vio
lence and because issues
such as date rape under
mine women's power and
success, the sorority is
working to raise awareness
about these topics at Stan
ford, says Hung.
"Dating 101: Pick-up
Lines, Parties and Picking the
Right One" is another SYZ
event that will provide infor
mation and facilitate discus
sions about domestic vio
lence, date rape and sexual
assault. In addition to ad
dressing these issues, the
workshop will talk about dat
ing in general at Stanford.
Along with the SYZ sis
ters, there will be a panel of
representatives from the
Stanford Police Department,
the Women's Center and var
ious upperclassmen at the
event. Although the work
shop is geared toward fresh
men, all are welcome to at
tend. Dating 101, complete
with lunch and prizes, will
take place on Saturday, April
3 from noon to 2 p.m. in
FloMo Lounge.
Stanford Rush is rapidly
approaching. Because SYZ
is new on campus and
wants to attract as many

potential members as pos
sible, it is holding two
Rushes and selecting two
pledge classes this year in
both winter and spring.
"SYZ's selection process
tries to view each girl who
Rushes as an individual,"
Hung said. "Quality over
quantity is the sorority's
overall goal. Of course, not
all who Rush accept our
bids, but we understand
that it is both our selection
process and theirs. The
Rush process aims to find
the best mutual fit."
SYZ tried to plan Rush
events every day of the week
to avoid overlapping with
other sororities' Rush events,
and the upperclassmen are
going to do their best to get to
know each of the girls who
Rush as well as possible dur
ing the week. Besides the im
portant general information
meeting, the SYZ sisters are
especially excited about
Rush events that promote
mingling and bonding among
actives and "Rushees" such
as their facial night.
Combining community
service, support for women
and creative events to unite
the Stanford community, the
SYZ sisters are beginning to
contribute significantly to
Greek life on campus. Hung
and her friends have enjoyed
the process of starting a new
sorority because it has given
them "the power to choose
what they want to do and
what they believe in."
"The sorority aims to do
great things and to provide
support for their sisters and
the community," Truong
said. "They would like to
work, along with other or
ganizations, to create a bet
ter picture for the whole
student body."

Newly-formed Asian-American sorority Sigma Psi Zeta is cur

period was held in the winter.

junction with Stanford Vietnamese Student Association for
Vietnamese high school students.
After extensive meetings
with University administra
tors, the Sigma Psi Zeta
sorority (SYZ), has official
ly emerged this year as an
un-housed, Asian-Ameri
can sorority at Stanford. If
the high attendance at
SYZ's first party a few
weekends ago is any indica
tion, many people are excit
ed about the establishment
of a Sigma Psi Zeta chapter
on the Farm.
Talk of the new sorority,
however, has been surround
ed by substantial confusion
and criticism because Alpha
Kappa Delta Phi (KDPhi),
another Asian-American
sorority, already has a chap
ter on campus. Indeed, some
students see SYZ as a super
fluous addition to Stanford's
Greek community.
Excited about their up
coming events and deter
mined to enhance life at Stan
ford for all students, the sis
ters of SYZ regard the estab
lishment of their sorority as
anything but unnecessary.
Stanford has a large Asian
population, and the SYZ sis
ters do not think that one
Asian-American sorority can
satisfy the needs of all Asian
women who are interested in
participating in Greek life.
As junior Jenny Truong, a
member of SYZ said, "There
is a large Asian American
population here but a dispro
portionately small number of
Greek organizations for
Asian Americans."
Senior Yvonne Hung,
one of the founders of Stan
ford's SYZ chapter, said
that the sorority is working
on "establishing themselves
as an important organiza
tion since there is already
an Asian American sorority
at Stanford.
"Sigma Psi Zeta is hoping
to work in cooperation rather

than in competition with
KDPhi to build a stronger
Asian American community
as a whole," she continued.
SYZ wants to create
unity rather than division
within the Asian American
population on campus, ac
cording to Hung.
Although Stanford's
chapter of SYZ does not cur
rently have any non-Asian
members, the sorority is 10
percent non-Asian on a na
tional scale. Stanford's SYZ
chapter anticipates being
able match this figure in the
future. Indeed, the SYZ sis
ters believe that their sorority
is different from many Greek
organizations on campus be
cause one of their top priori
ties is promoting interaction
between ethnic and non eth
nic Greek groups.
Additionally, SYZ wants
to create connections with
the student body in general.
"SYZ wants to fight the
stereotypes of 'Asian cliques'
by forming an Asian-Ameri
can sorority that cohesively
and enthusiastically reaches
out to the Stanford commu
nity," Hung said.
SYZ is also working to
expose and promote the di
versity within the Asian
community at Stanford.
This quarter, they are plan
ning to participate in the
Taiwanese Cultural Society
Market Night, the Asian
American Student Associa
tion Extravaganza and the
Asian Pacific Islander Her
itage Week. They have also
organized mixers and com
munity service projects
with other non-ethnic fra
ternities and sororities.
Currently, the sorority is
putting much effort into plan
ning "Take Back the Night"
— an annual walk that ac
knowledges victims of date
rape. The sorority highly val
ues community service and
has chosen to focus the ma

jority of their attention on is
sues of domestic violence.
"Domestic violence is a
very pertinent problem both
in the Asian community, with
its roots in traditional Asian
culture, and at Stanford,"
Hung said. "All Asian-
American sororities aim to
unite women and to fight the
problems that Asian Ameri
can women face in society.
Likewise, SYZ also aims to
project a strong image of
Asian American women
both on and off campus."
