The mix of energy sources that power society is firmly rooted in fossil energy.
Nevertheless, the natural flow of energy from the core of the earth and the sun
present energy sources that are large and almost inexhaustible. While these sources
may be inexhaustible, the rate at which energy can be drawn from them may be lim
ited. This course examines alternative energy schemes and focuses on processes
that have the potential for impact in the near and mid term. We discuss geothermal,
hydroelectricity, solar, and biomass energies, as well as resource extraction and the
consequences of resource exploitation.
