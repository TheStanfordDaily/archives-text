## Potter College's potential 
### 
Over the past decade, Stanford has in
vested an immense amount of re
sources in promoting undergraduate
research. Undergraduate Research
Opportunities grants, Chappell-Lougee scholar
ships, departmental honors programs and Sum

centives the University offers to encourage and
underwrite research by undergrade
Stanford's commitment to undergraduate re
search is laudable. It is one of many ways in which
the University is on the leading edge of higher ed
ucation practices. Stanford's burgeoning reputa
tion for generous funding and support can lure re
search-minded prospective students and perhaps
inspire other students who might not have
thought to pursue such projects. The creation of
Potter College, a residence in Governor's Corner
devoted to students working on research projects,
will further burnish the University's image as a
bastion of original undergraduate scholarship.
Of course, burnishing the University's image
should not be the only goal. What other benefits
will the college offer? Vice President for Under
graduate Education John Bravman, who will
oversee the college, contends that it will provide
a community of shared interests in the same way
that other campus focus houses supposedly do. In
theory, residents of Potter College will be en
couraged to interact with one another socially
and intellectually because they are undergoing
common experiences.
A major drawback of this idea is that those ex
periences are, by nature, intensive and isolating.
Writing a thesis or conducting a research project
typically requires hundreds of hours of solitary
work and a thorough submersion in one's subject
matter. A large group of students who share only
the common trait of a single-minded devotion to
their respective individual projects does not
sound like the basis fora vibrant community.
Some students have speculated that Potter
College will be a success, because it will provide
a quiet atmosphere fora group of people who
are wrapped up in their studies. However, there
already exist several dormitories on campus
where doors stay closed and social interaction is
kept to a minimum, and the Draw provides evi
dence that most students find such environ

ments undesirable.
Bravman, in contrast, argued that Potter Col
lege should be more social than the average up
perclass house, because of the aforementioned
commonality of experience between its resi
dence. He envisions a dormitory whose students
are especially excited to learn about each other's
unique pursuits.
But it's not as though the endeavors of the av
erage Stanford student are any less compelling
than those of students who choose not to im
merse themselves in research. Potter's neighbor
and conceptual kin. Freshman and Sophomore
College, is not exactly a social mecca. Still, the
nature of the freshman experience ensures that
its residents leave their rooms and interact so
cially and intellectually on a regular basis. Un
fortunately, Potter College seems likely to at
tract upperclass students who are content to pur
sue their own goals behind closed doors. If this
happens, the initiative will be unlikely to meet its
stated goals.
Research need not be an inherently anti-social
activity. Unfortunately, most of Stanford's sup
port of undergraduate research is geared toward
individual work. This represents an outmoded
conception of how learning should take place. An
overwhelming body of modern educational and
psychological research indicates that learning is
facilitated by group-based interaction. And real
world projects, both in and outside of academia,
tend to require cooperation, delegation and other
skills associated with group work. In this regard,
Stanford is behind the times.
Some aspects of Potter College — such as in
college colloquia and resident-sponsored events
designed to share student research with the com
munity at large — sound promising. Although
plans for affiliated "faculty fellows" seem vague
"at this point, the College also has the right idea in
recognizing the value of mentor relationships
with faculty.
But as it has been conceived, the dormitory
seems destined to be socially dead and its resi
dents intellectually sequestered. On the other
hand, if the University initiates forward-thinking
new programs that foster collaborative research,
Potter College could hold significantly more po
tential as a bastion of such interactive scholarship.

and conceptual kin. Freshman and Sophomore
College, is not exactly a social mecca. Still, the
nature of the freshman experience ensures that
its residents leave their rooms and interact so
cially and intellectually on a regular basis. Un
fortunately, Potter College seems likely to at
tract upperclass students who are content to pur
sue their own goals behind closed doors. If this
happens, the initiative will be unlikely to meet its
stated goals.
Research need not be an inherently anti-social
activity. Unfortunately, most of Stanford's sup
port of undergraduate research is geared toward
individual work. This represents an outmoded
conception of how learning should take place. An
overwhelming body of modern educational and
psychological research indicates that learning is
facilitated by group-based interaction. And real
world projects, both in and outside of academia,
tend to require cooperation, delegation and other
skills associated with group work. In this regard,
Stanford is behind the times.
Some aspects of Potter College — such as in
college colloquia and resident-sponsored events
designed to share student research with the com
munity at large — sound promising. Although
plans for affiliated "faculty fellows" seem vague
"at this point, the College also has the right idea in
recognizing the value of mentor relationships
with faculty.
But as it has been conceived, the dormitory
seems destined to be socially dead and its resi
dents intellectually sequestered. On the other
hand, if the University initiates forward-thinking
new programs that foster collaborative research,
Potter College could hold significantly more po
tential as a bastion of such interactive scholarship.
