# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Beating the book-buying blues 
### 
If you're taking classes this
quarter, it is probably impossi
ble to get by without buying
books. However, there are
still ways to avoid having to go to
the campus bookstore. For in
stance, last quarter a friend of mine
decided to drive to the Barnes and
Noble in Hillsdale to buy books
every week.
Since I don't drive, I personally
like to check out amazon.com for my
quarterly book-buying needs — that
way I can include an extra CD or
DVD in the book bill that I later
send home to my parents. But who
really has the time to check the post
office every day fora book shipment
or drive 10 miles to a bookstore
when we are practically expected to
finish our first reading assignments
before the first day of classes?
There is, of course, another op
tion for buying books that seems to
be more popular than even the
bookstore and online book-buying.
Judging by my inbox overload this
past week, it looks like everyone on
campus is either buying or selling
books for PWR, 1 HUM or Math 51.
E-mail lists have turned into cy
berspace flea markets for everyone's
used books, and so now every time I
check my mail hoping for summer
job offers, dirty e-mail jokes and
send-or-die chain letters, all I get are
other people's class lists and their
pleas for cheap or free books.
Difficult as it would seem to take

classes without purchasing the
books, every quarter I run into some
one who amazes me and does just

that. Sure, there
are some who opt
to use the library,
but even with its
myriad of books,
the library is not
really equipped to
accommodate a
quarter's worth of
books for every
one who doesn't

want to buy them.
Others, knowing the limitations
of their work habits, opt out of buy
ing any books they know they won't
read anyway. While mulling over the
eight required books for my history
course, I was told by a wise senior to
leave behind the ones that had ugly
covers or too-fine print — reducing
the eight books to two or three.
Since I can't really excuse seniori
tis in my junior year, I decided
against his advice and bought all of
my history books, convincing myself
that I got a good deal because, as the
bright orange tags on the books
read, "used saves."
I suppose that in the midst of all
of my whining about book costs, I
should acknowledge that we do have
the option of shopping around. Or, if
you get to the bookstore early
enough, it's even possible to pick up
a used copy that belonged to a per
son who not only refrained from

writing in her book, but also man
aged to leave a copy of last year's
midterm buried in the pages.
But where are those like-new
books with their bright orange stick
ers in the course reader section?
Even though professors can go
years without changing the content
of their course readers (and even if
one section is changed or missing,
who really cares?), the bookstore
never reuses them. My guess is that
it's some sort of copyright issue, but
thanks to the e-mail book cartel (and
the student body's apparent disre
gard for copyright law) course read
ers are also recycled.
So by the end of this week, once I
have gone to all of my classes and
picked up all of my syllabi and read
ing lists, I will probably have bought
about 20 books: some from ama
zon.com, some from random e-mail
vendors and the remainder from the
Bookstore, fora grand total nearing
the $400 mark.
Sure, it's less than I spent last
quarter, but it's still more than the
$69 that a friend of mine has spent. It
looks like she will be taking trips to
the Stanford mall this quarter with
out me.

Are you part of the campus wide
textbook black market. . . and
have any extra history books?
