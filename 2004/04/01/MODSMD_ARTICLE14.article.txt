## Delusions of superiority 
### 
There are certain questions
that define every age, and if
historians could only answer
them, they would possess a
deep and subtle understanding of
their subject.
For instance, the Romans might be
characterized by, "Why the hell are all
you guys wearing dresses?", while
Japan at the time of the Shogun might
be encapsulated by, "Aren't there any
forks around this joint?"
What then, you might ask, will fu
ture historians be asking about our
generation? Quite frankly, 1 think
nothing sums us up better than, "Why
on earth would anyone watch that?"
Now I don't pretend to be the first
person to point out that, with the ex
ception of about four brave and lone
ly souls, everyone on the planet is
completely and utterly insane. How
ever, I think that by and large we set
tle into some kind of familiarity with
the ridiculousness around us and
move on. Well, I am fairly certain it is
no exaggeration to say that any illu
sions of normalcy can be irrevocably
shattered by a half hour of modern
television programming.
I suppose if I were mature or re
sponsible, I would watch Crossfire and
Nightline, have a glass of warm milk
and go to bed. I am neither mature nor
responsible. Instead, I stay up to wee
hours of the morning to catch the third
daily episode of "Elimidate" and en
gage in fevered discussions over which
girl I 'd pick. (These idiots NEVER get

it right! Never! C'mon, it's obvious
that Peaches is only pretending to be a
slut so you pick her! Check out that set

of "contestants"
on Suzy!)
My tendency
to humiliate my
self at the altar of
television reality
dating is not
something I'm
proud of, but nev
ertheless, I can't
pull myself away.

During my formative years, dating
shows consisted of nonsense like "The
Dating Game," where the most outra
geous thing that might happen would
be a question containing a double en
tendre (God forbid!).
However, at some particularly sin
gular point in history someone must
have said, "Hey! Why don't we just
abandon any sense of propriety what
soever and show floozies and morons
prancing around like oxygen-de
prived primates!" Shortly thereafter,
of course. Fox News Channel came
into existence.
A few years later, however, some
one must have come up with the idea
of a whole new generation of dating
shows, and boy, are they great. As I
probably betrayed above, I'm first and
foremost an "Elimidate" man myself;
there's just some kind of magic when
you put four ridiculous women into a
fevered competition over a guy they
probably wouldn't give a second

glance under normal circumstances.
Throughout the entire show my at
titude is precariously perched be
tween, "Yes, I do think it would be a
good idea for all of you to go into the
vat of whipped cream," and "What on
earth can your parents be thinking
about your salacious national televi
sion debut?" Friends, let me tell you,
that perch is a great place to be.
There is, however, an ugly down
side to the entire scene. No, no, I'm not
talking about objectification of
women or any other genuine societal
concern, but a darker, more personal
problem. Every once in a while, the re
alization hits you that it's 3 a.m., you're
sitting in a dark dorm room in your
boxers giving feverish suggestions to
idiots on the television, and perhaps
your superiority over these folks isn't
exactly what you'd imagine it to be.
It's exactly that moment that the
force of the question, "Why on Earth
would anyone watch that?" hits you,
and I'll be the first to admit I don't
have an answer.
If you do, type it up. I'm almost cer
tain fame and renown will await. And
if you end up with a grant, don't forget
the charming young columnist who
put you on your path.

self at the altar of
television reality
dating is not
something I'm
proud of, but nev
ertheless, I can't
pull myself away.

During my formative years, dating
shows consisted of nonsense like "The
Dating Game," where the most outra
geous thing that might happen would
be a question containing a double en
tendre (God forbid!).
However, at some particularly sin
gular point in history someone must
have said, "Hey! Why don't we just
abandon any sense of propriety what
soever and show floozies and morons
prancing around like oxygen-de
prived primates!" Shortly thereafter,
of course. Fox News Channel came
into existence.
A few years later, however, some
one must have come up with the idea
of a whole new generation of dating
shows, and boy, are they great. As I
probably betrayed above, I'm first and
foremost an "Elimidate" man myself;
there's just some kind of magic when
you put four ridiculous women into a
fevered competition over a guy they
probably wouldn't give a second

glance under normal circumstances.
Throughout the entire show my at
titude is precariously perched be
tween, "Yes, I do think it would be a
good idea for all of you to go into the
vat of whipped cream," and "What on
earth can your parents be thinking
about your salacious national televi
sion debut?" Friends, let me tell you,
that perch is a great place to be.
There is, however, an ugly down
side to the entire scene. No, no, I'm not
talking about objectification of
women or any other genuine societal
concern, but a darker, more personal
problem. Every once in a while, the re
alization hits you that it's 3 a.m., you're
sitting in a dark dorm room in your
boxers giving feverish suggestions to
idiots on the television, and perhaps
your superiority over these folks isn't
exactly what you'd imagine it to be.
It's exactly that moment that the
force of the question, "Why on Earth
would anyone watch that?" hits you,
and I'll be the first to admit I don't
have an answer.
If you do, type it up. I'm almost cer
tain fame and renown will await. And
if you end up with a grant, don't forget
the charming young columnist who
put you on your path.
