Rice's refusal to testify
was justified
I am writing in response to Kiran
Soma's letter ("Former provost
brings shame to Stanford," 3/31) in
dicating that she is ashamed to have
Condoleezza Rice associated with
Stanford because of Rice's refusal to
testify publicly before the 9/11
Commission. Soma seems to neglect
several relevant facts.
First, the Constitution of the
United States' separation of the ex
ecutive and legislative branches
prohibits Congress from requiring
exactly this type of testimony. Sec
ond, no national security adviser in
this country's history has ever testi
fied in public before a congression
al committee.
Finally, the very same Demo

cratic senators and members of
Congress who are now howling
about her refusal were staunehly
defending this right in 1999. At that
time, Republicans were seeking to
have President Clinton's national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, tes
tify about the cruise missile bomb
ings of an alleged chemical
weapons plant in Sudan that turned
out to be nothing more than an as
pirin factory.
Oh yeah, and yesterday the White
House gave in to these ridiculous de
mands. Rice will testify, despite the
complete hypocrisy of those de
manding it, the complete lack of
precedence for it and the president's
constitutional right to withhold it.

Tourney loss shows Stanford's
lack of killer instinct
The Alabama-Stanford game in
the 2004 NCAA Tournament: It
took 22 years, but we now have the
men's basketball equivalent of
Stanford's 1982 Big Game loss on
The Play.
It would be to the team's benefit
to gain something it has rarely, if
ever, shown: a killer instinct, which
teams like Duke or Kentucky have.
Those teams throughout the year
pummel weak opponents into sub
mission by never letting up, running
up huge scoring margins by the end
of the game.
Stanford, on the other hand, often
lets up on the accelerator and shows
mercy on weaklings by either slow
ing down the game or putting in nu

merous players off the bench, which
keeps the score of the game closer
than it could be.
Just getting by — making sure
that Stanford is ahead of the other
team by at least one point when the
final buzzer goes off — is the wrong
attitude. The team's consistent
method over recent years of playing
sluggish in the first half, against any
caliber of opponent, and then having
to play harder in the second half to
eke out a win is evidence of the
team's wrong attitude.
The team needs to develop a ha
bitual, unconscious attitude that
winning basketball means going out
on the floor with the intent to crush
the opponent, strong or weak, and
playing its hardest from the start of
the game to the finish.
As a beneficial result of the Al

abama loss, perhaps Stanford will
learn how to play with a big lead and
continue to turn the screws on the
opponent, rather than relaxing —
intentionally or not — and letting
the lead and the game slip away.
In the NCAA tournament espe
cially, where it's one-and-done, the
teams that attack their opponents
throughout the game — the teams
that don't slack off at any point — are
typically the ones that win to live an
other day.

The team needs to develop a ha
bitual, unconscious attitude that
winning basketball means going out
on the floor with the intent to crush
the opponent, strong or weak, and
playing its hardest from the start of
the game to the finish.
As a beneficial result of the Al

abama loss, perhaps Stanford will
learn how to play with a big lead and
continue to turn the screws on the
opponent, rather than relaxing —
intentionally or not — and letting
the lead and the game slip away.
In the NCAA tournament espe
cially, where it's one-and-done, the
teams that attack their opponents
throughout the game — the teams
that don't slack off at any point — are
typically the ones that win to live an
other day.

congratulates Levine
Please give my condolences and
also congratulations to Aaron

Levine. I did a search on
http://www.google.com, and that's
where I found the connection be
tween him and your paper.
1 voted to cut Mike Hall, and 1 be
lieve that America made a mistake in
not going with Aaron. Hopefully,
with all of his training and experi
ence, Aaron will have the chance to
get the job of his choice, just not his
"dream job."
