## Without a star, you'll just lose 
### 
You've got your superstars in
every sport. Michael Vick and
Donovan McNabb in football.
Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter
in baseball. But more than in any other
sport, the basketball superstar matters.
Why? Because you can't win with
out one.
Before the Marlins won a World Series
or Patriots won a Super Bowl most Ameri
cans couldn't name a player on either
team.
The Marlins did it behind Josh Beckett
and Miguel Cabrera — and while Cabrera
may be a somebody someday, he certainly
wasn't before the Fish made their run —
while the Pats were led by a rock solid de
fensive unit and a quarterback who doesn't
get press because of his skills on the field,

but because he looks like
Matt Damon.
Basketball is an en
tirely different animal.
The most recent NBA
Champs? Spurs, Lakers,
Lakers, Lakers.
Tim Duncan. Kobe.
My friend, the Diesel.
Now, Tim Duncan
may not be your typical
superstar. His game is
built around the funda
mentals of basketball and

his personality is, quite frankly, boring. But
you can't question his superstar stats. He
has the ability to dominate every game he
plays in and he makes his teammates better
while doing it.
Kobe and Shaq? Now you've got the
superstar attitude to go with the super
star game. They're prima donnas on and
off the court — and with the addition of
the Glove and the Mailman, this team
has absolutely no excuse for not rolling
over the rest of the NBA.
College ball, on the other hand, is start
ing to become a different game thanks to
the watering down of talent due to your Le-
Brons, Amares, Kobes and KGs skipping
out so they can cash in early. And those are
just your success stories.
For every Leßron or Amare, there's a
Ndudi Ebi or Kendrick Perkins, who no
doubt would have made a splash in the
NCAA, but wound up warming the bench
because they really didn't have the talent
to make the jump.
College superstars have become few
and far between.
Jameer Nelson won't be an NBA leg
end. He'll probably hang around fora year
or two and then fade into oblivion. But at
least he'll have a college degree — and you
can't say he wasn't a star at St. Joe's.
He's the sole reason St. Joe's was able
to pull out an undefeated regular season.
Nelson's star power. The sharpshooting
of Pat Carroll and Delonte West was
nice, but let's be real. That team is noth
ing without Nelson.
Star power is the reason the reason why
the Duke-UConn game is the real Nation
al Championship game.
Emeka Okafor is a beast. There's no
single person in college basketball who can
stop him. He absolutely takes away all
semblance of the opposing team's inside
game — and he's not bad on the offensive
end as well.
If he can play through that damn
stinger, the one-two punch of him and Ben
Gordon should catapult the Huskies into
to the national championship.
And while I'm picking the Huskies,
Duke is the one team that has a chance of
knocking them out.
Why? Luol Deng. Deng is totally inex
perienced and doesn't quite have the talent
of Carmelo Anthony, but when he shows
up, he can do it all.
He can post up. he can knock down the
mid-range jumper and he's got smooth-as
silk handle.
Even with frosh phenom Deng, Duke
still doesn't have the Huskies' talent. J.J.
Redick is a nice player with deadly accura
cy, but come on, when it comes down to it,
he's just another white guy who can't cre
ate his own shot.
Other side of the bracket? As much as I
love Georgia Tech for pulling through
without leading scorer B.J. Elder, you're
not gonna see those guys cutting down the
nets in San Antonio.
Oklahoma State and John Lucas are a
good story as well. The team plays good D,
which is about as common as Kobe giving
up the ball, but again, who's gonna take the
last shot? There's no way Lucas has anoth
er buzzer-beater left in him.
So, hopefully everyone will enjoy the
real National Championship game, be
cause when Duke and Connecticut square
off on Saturday evening, you won't have to
suffer through watching a bunch of scrubs
who struggle to hit a jumper.

messed up that she had Stanford losing to
