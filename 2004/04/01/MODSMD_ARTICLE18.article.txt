# Men's tennis downs Harvard
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was Cardinal vs. Crimson on Tuesday at the Taube
Family Tennis Center, a duel between the West Coast and
East Coast, and only one could come out on top. Would it
be No. 15 Harvard? No, but the Crimson put up a good Ivy
League effort against the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team,
which came up with its fourth straight win to close out its
five-game homestand on the Farm.
Stanford went into the match with an 8-0 overall record
against the Crimson, the most recent match being a 6-1 win
over Harvard last year. The Crimson now has a 9-4 record
for the season, while the Cardinal improved to 12-3.
"We continue to keep building match by match, each
one seems to be getting a little tougher," said associate head
coach John Whitlinger. "The guys have been doing a great
job since finals are over. We've been very pleased with how
they competed against Harvard."
The Cardinal began the dual match on a high note as it
grabbed the doubles point by winning the first two matches.
"Any time you can win a doubles point it's impor
tant," Whitlinger said. "[Harvard] swept Cal the day be
fore, so it was a good thing we got that point, especially
against a good team."
At the No. 1 spot, the duo of sophomore K.C. Corkery
and junior Sam Warburg had a strong day together, show
ing aggressiveness on the court and good communication
between the two of them.
The tandem was up 7-3 in the match, and Harvard's No.
37 Jonathon Chu and David Lingman seemed to lack con
fidence as their serves were slammed right back at them and
Stanford volleys went unanswered. Chu / Lingman made a
late comeback eventually, but were unable to hold off the
Cardinal duo, who held on for an 8-6 win.
Senior team captain Carter Morris and junior Phil Sheng
had a back-and-forth battle with Harvard's Brandon Chiu
and Mark Riddell but came out on top with an 8-6 victory.
At the No. 3 doubles spot, Stanford's Chris Rasmussen
and James Wan struggled at the beginning of the match
against Chris Chiou and Cliff Nguyen and seemed to lack
communication as a team. The freshman duo couldn't find
a rhythm on the court and frustration grew after a ques
tionable call. Rasmussen / Wan managed to get back into
the game, but were unable to overcome the Crimson team,
losing, 8-5.
In singles. No. 23 Warburg quickly dispatched No. 27
Lingman, 6-3, 6-2, in the match between the only
ranked singles players on the two teams. Stanford's
Sheng defeated Riddell, 7-6, 6-3. and Wan extended his
dual match win streak to 16-0 after taking an easy 6-1,
6-1 victory over Nguyen, the player he faced in doubles
earlier that day.
"I think playing doubles first helps you to warm up
so you're ready to play in singles," Warburg said. "I'm
pretty familiar with David Lingman, I've seen him play
before so I knew what I needed to do."
Morris rounded out the Stanford wins by taking a three
set victory over Jack Li, 4-6.6-3.6-4.
In the losses, Corkery was defeated in a close 7-5, 7-6
match by Harvard's Chu while Stanford's Rasmussen took
a 6-3,6-2 loss dealt by Chiou.
The team will travel to southern California this upcom
ing weekend to face two ranked teams with solid dual
match records.
First up for the Cardinal will be a showdown with
No. 4 Southern California. The Trojans carry a 14-2 sea
son record into Friday's match but are 52-44 against
Stanford overall. The Cardinal players will be looking
to continue their win streak over USC after wiping
them out, 7-0, both times they met last year.
The Trojans should give Stanford players a run for

their money this year, though, bringing in five ranked
singles players and one ranked doubles team. Their top
players include No. 26 Adriano Biasella, No. 42 Jamil Al-
Agba, No. 47 Ruben Torres, No. 71 Johan Berg and No.
92 Drew Hoskins.
"USC is a night and day difference with their team this
year," Whitlinger said. "They're one of the top teams in the
country. This is an excellent team that deserves the ranking

that they have. It's going to be a good test for us. "
On Saturday, the team will move on to play No. 5
UCLA, which owns a 12-5 record and a close 46-53
record against the Cardinal. UCLA also has five ranked
players and a ranked doubles team. Players to look out
for are No. 5 Tobias Clemens, No. 60 Alberto Francis,
No. 62 Chris Lam, No. 78 Kris Kwinta and No. 98
Philipp Gruendler.

The Cardinal began the dual match on a high note as it
grabbed the doubles point by winning the first two matches.
"Any time you can win a doubles point it's impor
tant," Whitlinger said. "[Harvard] swept Cal the day be
fore, so it was a good thing we got that point, especially
against a good team."
At the No. 1 spot, the duo of sophomore K.C. Corkery
and junior Sam Warburg had a strong day together, show
ing aggressiveness on the court and good communication
between the two of them.
The tandem was up 7-3 in the match, and Harvard's No.
37 Jonathon Chu and David Lingman seemed to lack con
fidence as their serves were slammed right back at them and
Stanford volleys went unanswered. Chu / Lingman made a
late comeback eventually, but were unable to hold off the
Cardinal duo, who held on for an 8-6 win.
Senior team captain Carter Morris and junior Phil Sheng
had a back-and-forth battle with Harvard's Brandon Chiu
and Mark Riddell but came out on top with an 8-6 victory.
At the No. 3 doubles spot, Stanford's Chris Rasmussen
and James Wan struggled at the beginning of the match
against Chris Chiou and Cliff Nguyen and seemed to lack
communication as a team. The freshman duo couldn't find
a rhythm on the court and frustration grew after a ques
tionable call. Rasmussen / Wan managed to get back into
the game, but were unable to overcome the Crimson team,
losing, 8-5.
In singles. No. 23 Warburg quickly dispatched No. 27
Lingman, 6-3, 6-2, in the match between the only
ranked singles players on the two teams. Stanford's
Sheng defeated Riddell, 7-6, 6-3. and Wan extended his
dual match win streak to 16-0 after taking an easy 6-1,
6-1 victory over Nguyen, the player he faced in doubles
earlier that day.
"I think playing doubles first helps you to warm up
so you're ready to play in singles," Warburg said. "I'm
pretty familiar with David Lingman, I've seen him play
before so I knew what I needed to do."
Morris rounded out the Stanford wins by taking a three
set victory over Jack Li, 4-6.6-3.6-4.
In the losses, Corkery was defeated in a close 7-5, 7-6
match by Harvard's Chu while Stanford's Rasmussen took
a 6-3,6-2 loss dealt by Chiou.
The team will travel to southern California this upcom
ing weekend to face two ranked teams with solid dual
match records.
First up for the Cardinal will be a showdown with
No. 4 Southern California. The Trojans carry a 14-2 sea
son record into Friday's match but are 52-44 against
Stanford overall. The Cardinal players will be looking
to continue their win streak over USC after wiping
them out, 7-0, both times they met last year.
The Trojans should give Stanford players a run for

their money this year, though, bringing in five ranked
singles players and one ranked doubles team. Their top
players include No. 26 Adriano Biasella, No. 42 Jamil Al-
Agba, No. 47 Ruben Torres, No. 71 Johan Berg and No.
92 Drew Hoskins.
"USC is a night and day difference with their team this
year," Whitlinger said. "They're one of the top teams in the
country. This is an excellent team that deserves the ranking

that they have. It's going to be a good test for us. "
On Saturday, the team will move on to play No. 5
UCLA, which owns a 12-5 record and a close 46-53
record against the Cardinal. UCLA also has five ranked
players and a ranked doubles team. Players to look out
for are No. 5 Tobias Clemens, No. 60 Alberto Francis,
No. 62 Chris Lam, No. 78 Kris Kwinta and No. 98
Philipp Gruendler.

Junior Phil Sheng and the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team defeated No. 15 Harvard at Taube Tennis Stadium, extend
ing its record to 12-3.
It was Cardinal vs. Crimson on Tuesday at the Taube
Family Tennis Center, a duel between the West Coast and
East Coast, and only one could come out on top. Would it
be No. 15 Harvard? No, but the Crimson put up a good Ivy
League effort against the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team,
which came up with its fourth straight win to close out its
five-game homestand on the Farm.
Stanford went into the match with an 8-0 overall record
against the Crimson, the most recent match being a 6-1 win
over Harvard last year. The Crimson now has a 9-4 record
for the season, while the Cardinal improved to 12-3.
"We continue to keep building match by match, each
one seems to be getting a little tougher," said associate head
coach John Whitlinger. "The guys have been doing a great
job since finals are over. We've been very pleased with how
they competed against Harvard."
