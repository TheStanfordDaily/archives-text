# Coursework not dead yet

### HELEN CHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Course Work pro
gram, an in-house online course
management system that lost fund
ing last year, will continue with the
support of Academic Computing
and individual departments.
Course Work was originally spon
sored by a grant from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation, which ex
pired in June 2003. This fact, togeth
er with increasing escalation and
support needs, led the provost, the
deans of the schools and the Univer
sity librarian to seek alternative solu
tions and keep the system online.
Their solution is for Course Work
to operate under a community
based support model, which is divid
ed into two parts.
Academic Computing will host
the hardware aspect by maintaining
the application itself and the servers.
Individual faculty, staff, students,
and departmental staff who use

Course Work will be supported by
the computing support staff in those
schools and departments, who are
turn given limited support by Acad
emic Computing.
Other suggestions would have cut
roughly $100,000 out of the Univer
sity's general funds, eliminated the
usage of Coursework altogether, or
asked users to pay a fee to access the site.
Junior Whalen Rozelle objects to
the idea of paying for any kind of
Coursework system.
"This is something Stanford has
to pay for to better the educational
experience they provide, not some
thing that we students should bear
the cost of," he said.
However, he and many other stu
dents generally find the Course-
Work system to be a valuable tool.
"It's nice to have all your lecture
notes be in one place," said sopho
more Robert Walker. "Or if you
need to know a professor's office
hours or location. It's a resource
open 24 hours a day, so it can help

you study on your own time."
Sophomore Daxia Ge said, "I
think it's necessary for courses to op
erate smoothly, kind of a forum for
professors and students to interact
and meet."
Although Course Work will con
tinue operation, the amount of tech
nical support may vary.
"We are going to provide the sys
tem, and it will be up and running for
use by any expert users," Provost
John Etchemendy said. "We are
going to provide as much support as
is possible to faculty who need sup
port in getting their courses up. But
it will be on a first-come, first-served
basis, and will not be as extensive as
it has been in the past."
According to Lois Brooks, direc
tor of academic computing, "It's the
best model for the community. It
keeps costs low, builds on existing
resources in the Stanford communi
ty and allows flexibility over time."
Academic Computing has esti
mated the costs of maintaining

Course Work to be about $730,000
per year.
Brooks said, "There are staff
salaries and benefits, the cost of the
servers and the cost of the ITSS sup
port. It adds up. One of the issues is
the sheer volume of use on Course-
Work —we have to keep enough
computers running to handle the
peak usage at the start of each quar
ter, and respond to the many hun
dreds of requests for information
and assistance each quarter."
According to Brooks, the current
Course Work staff consists of three
programmers and system adminis
trators, two user support staff and
nearly 20 servers for production and
system maintenance. In addition to
these direct costs are the indirect
costs of user authentication systems
and data feeds from Axess.
Approximately 2,000 classes are
registered on Course Work this acad
emic year, which means roughly 40
percent of faculty are using the system.
Brooks also estimates about 12,000
unique users.
Students suggest several alternatives
to improve the Course Work system.
"If there were no Course Work, I would
want the University to come up with an
appropriate substitute that would offer
me the same features," said sophomore
Yuanxin Zhou. "Perhaps something that
is less expensive to maintain."
Ge said, "The Electrical Engineering
Department has its own version of

Course Work which is called EEClass.
And its better, I think."
EEClass, or CCNet, is a very similar
program developed by Stanford graduate
student Keyvan Mohajer during his un
dergraduate years at the University of
Toronto. Mohajer licenses his product to
the EE Department for free, although
this type of software reasonably costs
$100,000 to $400,000 a year. He has previ
ously said that he would be willing to
make CCNet available to all campus de
partments if it could help reduce costs for
the University.
At the same time, improvements
to Course Work are being made for
next year. One is the inclusion of the
Sakai Project, an open-source course
work software system for higher-edu
cation institutions.

"For the future, Stanford has joined in
a consortium with the University of Michi
gan, Indiana University, MIT, the Univer
sity of Delaware and the Mellon Founda
tion to develop an enhanced course man
agement system that will then be support
ed and maintained by this consortium,
spreading the cost," Etchemendy said.
"This should be up and running in a
few years."
These tools are already beginning im
plementation here at Stanford.
"Academic Computing is the home of
the Sakai project at Stanford and will pro
vide us with the next generation of
Course Work," Brooks said. "We are
planning pilot tests next academic year,
and will roll out the Sakai tools, which in
cludes course management and group col
laboration tools, in Fall 2005."

and data feeds from Axess.
Approximately 2,000 classes are
registered on Course Work this acad
emic year, which means roughly 40
percent of faculty are using the system.
Brooks also estimates about 12,000
unique users.
Students suggest several alternatives
to improve the Course Work system.
"If there were no Course Work, I would
want the University to come up with an
appropriate substitute that would offer
me the same features," said sophomore
Yuanxin Zhou. "Perhaps something that
is less expensive to maintain."
Ge said, "The Electrical Engineering
Department has its own version of

Course Work which is called EEClass.
And its better, I think."
EEClass, or CCNet, is a very similar
program developed by Stanford graduate
student Keyvan Mohajer during his un
dergraduate years at the University of
Toronto. Mohajer licenses his product to
the EE Department for free, although
this type of software reasonably costs
$100,000 to $400,000 a year. He has previ
ously said that he would be willing to
make CCNet available to all campus de
partments if it could help reduce costs for
the University.
At the same time, improvements
to Course Work are being made for
next year. One is the inclusion of the
Sakai Project, an open-source course
work software system for higher-edu
cation institutions.

"For the future, Stanford has joined in
a consortium with the University of Michi
gan, Indiana University, MIT, the Univer
sity of Delaware and the Mellon Founda
tion to develop an enhanced course man
agement system that will then be support
ed and maintained by this consortium,
spreading the cost," Etchemendy said.
"This should be up and running in a
few years."
These tools are already beginning im
plementation here at Stanford.
"Academic Computing is the home of
the Sakai project at Stanford and will pro
vide us with the next generation of
Course Work," Brooks said. "We are
planning pilot tests next academic year,
and will roll out the Sakai tools, which in
cludes course management and group col
laboration tools, in Fall 2005."
Stanford's Course Work pro
gram, an in-house online course
management system that lost fund
ing last year, will continue with the
support of Academic Computing
and individual departments.
Course Work was originally spon
sored by a grant from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation, which ex
pired in June 2003. This fact, togeth
er with increasing escalation and
support needs, led the provost, the
deans of the schools and the Univer
sity librarian to seek alternative solu
tions and keep the system online.
Their solution is for Course Work
to operate under a community
based support model, which is divid
ed into two parts.
Academic Computing will host
the hardware aspect by maintaining
the application itself and the servers.
Individual faculty, staff, students,
and departmental staff who use

Course Work will be supported by
the computing support staff in those
schools and departments, who are
turn given limited support by Acad
emic Computing.
Other suggestions would have cut
roughly $100,000 out of the Univer
sity's general funds, eliminated the
usage of Coursework altogether, or
asked users to pay a fee to access the site.
Junior Whalen Rozelle objects to
the idea of paying for any kind of
Coursework system.
"This is something Stanford has
to pay for to better the educational
experience they provide, not some
thing that we students should bear
the cost of," he said.
However, he and many other stu
dents generally find the Course-
Work system to be a valuable tool.
"It's nice to have all your lecture
notes be in one place," said sopho
more Robert Walker. "Or if you
need to know a professor's office
hours or location. It's a resource
open 24 hours a day, so it can help

you study on your own time."
Sophomore Daxia Ge said, "I
think it's necessary for courses to op
erate smoothly, kind of a forum for
professors and students to interact
and meet."
Although Course Work will con
tinue operation, the amount of tech
nical support may vary.
"We are going to provide the sys
tem, and it will be up and running for
use by any expert users," Provost
John Etchemendy said. "We are
going to provide as much support as
is possible to faculty who need sup
port in getting their courses up. But
it will be on a first-come, first-served
basis, and will not be as extensive as
it has been in the past."
According to Lois Brooks, direc
tor of academic computing, "It's the
best model for the community. It
keeps costs low, builds on existing
resources in the Stanford communi
ty and allows flexibility over time."
Academic Computing has esti
mated the costs of maintaining

Course Work to be about $730,000
per year.
Brooks said, "There are staff
salaries and benefits, the cost of the
servers and the cost of the ITSS sup
port. It adds up. One of the issues is
the sheer volume of use on Course-
Work —we have to keep enough
computers running to handle the
peak usage at the start of each quar
ter, and respond to the many hun
dreds of requests for information
and assistance each quarter."
According to Brooks, the current
Course Work staff consists of three
programmers and system adminis
trators, two user support staff and
nearly 20 servers for production and
system maintenance. In addition to
these direct costs are the indirect
costs of user authentication systems
and data feeds from Axess.
Approximately 2,000 classes are
registered on Course Work this acad
emic year, which means roughly 40
