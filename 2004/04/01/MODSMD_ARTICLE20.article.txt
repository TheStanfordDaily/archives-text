After a disappointing weekend at the Warrior Invitational tournament, the
Stanford men's lacrosse team knew that it needed to rebound in order to keep its
play-off hopes alive — find a way to win.
The Cardinal did just that in the past two weeks, defeating rivals Southern Cal
ifornia and Southern Methodist before losing to Texas.
The Cardinal (3-4, 2-1 West Coast Lacrosse League North) hosted USC at
home March 13th and routed the Trojans, 10-7.
Junior attacker Brooks Kinkaid led all scorers with five goals while fellow se
nior attacker Beau Lewis contributed four assists. Senior midfielders David Simp
son and Charlie Stockman each added goals as well.
It was the defense, however, that made the difference for the Cardinal. Led by
senior defensemen Ben Spohn, K.C. Lukens and Matt Twomey, the Cardinal held
the Trojans to one goal in each of the first three quarters. Sophomore goaltender
Michael Zell also played one of his best games all season, posting a .558 save per
centage with 10 saves.
"This was the first time that our three senior defensemen — Matt Twom
ey. Ben Spohn, and KC Lukens — played together," Zell said of the trio,
which has battled injuries. "[USC] scored a few goals at the end, but it really
wasn't a close game."
After two weeks off, the team returned to action with a pair of games in
Texas. On Saturday, the Cardinal took on Southern Methodist, defeating the
Mustangs easily, 13-3. The team was led on offense by junior attacker Brooks
Kinkaid and sophomore midfielder Tyler Guttierez. With everyone healthy, it
was the defense that again stole the show, holding the Mustangs to their low
est scoring total all season.
Monday's game against Texas proved to be a more challenging matchup for the
Cardinal, as the Longhorns ended Stanford's two-game win streak, handing the
squad a 13-7 loss. The Cardinal struggled to find the net in the first half and found
itself down 9-3 at halftime.
Despite out-shooting the Longhorns, the Cardinal was unable to erase its six
goal deficit in the second half.
As it has been all season long, the team was again plagued by injuries. Fresh
man midfielder Ben Stillman went down early in the game with a concussion and
senior defensemen Ben Spohn followed with a knee injury in the second quarter.
"Injuries really hurt us in this game and we had to play a lot of inexperienced
people," Zell said. "We need to get healthy."
Despite the loss, the Cardinal is still in third place in the WCLL North, behind
first-place Sonoma State and second-place Cal Poly. The team has its sights set on
making the WCLL play-offs as at least a three seed and playing well enough there
to earn an invitation to St. Louis for the national tournament.
The team's road to St. Louis continues this weekend as the Cardinal hosts UC-
Davis on Saturday at Ipm.
