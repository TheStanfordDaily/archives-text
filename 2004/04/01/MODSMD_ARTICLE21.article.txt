# Card tennis defeats Bears
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team (17-0)
continued its winning streak yesterday with a
stunning shut-out of No. 11 California.
The match at Taube Family Tennis Sta
dium, set against a backdrop of clear skies
and gentle winds, was a contrast of brutal
showing of Cardinal power and muted play
ing conditions.
Defending NCAA singles champion
Amber Liu avenged a loss last month to top
ranked Raquel Kops-Jones with a sweeping
defeat on the home courts, 6-1,6-1.
"I've really been working on my transi
tion game," Liu, a sophomore, said. "Dou
bles has really helped me out, because it
forces you to move forward and work on
your volleys."
Liu added, "It's great for me that I have
such a good doubles partner, Alice Barnes.
I didn't play a lot of doubles in the junior
[circuit], and she's really helped me im
prove in the past two years."
Against the title-winning Golden Bears
senior. No. 33 Liu appeared on top of her
game from everywhere on the court.
In tandem with her net-game work, Liu's
solid forehand toyed consistently with base
line and kept Kops-Jones on the defensive.
Part of the Bears' problem was Kops-
Jones's recent bout of lower back problems.
"She hasn't played the past couple of
matches for [California]," Liu said tenta
tively before Wednesday's match.
Barnes, a sophomore, and senior
Emilia Anderson both fueled Stanford's
fire with decisive 6-2,6-2 wins in the No. 2
and No. 6 singles positions, respectively.
Barnes, who is currently ranked No. 15 in
the nation, has yet to drop a dual match in her
collegiate career.

She and her teammates grow increasingly
determined in their bid for Pacific-10 Confer
ence domination.
"We have to defend 16 Pac-10 titles in a
row, and everyone else is trying to destroy
that," Barnes said. "We can't ease off fora
second. That's all it takes, someone has a
bad day and suddenly you're in trouble."
The Cardinal treaded on tentative
ground as senior Lauren Barnikow, junior
Erin Burdette and freshman Theresa Logar
all needed three rounds to clinch success.
No. 36 Barnikow dropped Catherine
Lynch in the first set, 6-3, but let the second
set slip away, 5-7.
"I feel strongly about not letting them
thing we're vulnerable," Barnikow said be
fore going into the match. "We need to
focus and concentrate on beating them just
as badly as last time."
Saving face, Barnikow pulled out the win
in a third-set tiebreak, 1-0.
No. 19 Burdette and No. 24 Logar both
broke back from first set slip-ups.
Pitted against Nicole Havlicek, Logar
kept her undefeated record intact by
blanking Havlicek and cruising through
the tiebreak.
In doubles action, the Cardinal breezed
past California in all three spots.
The top-ranked tandem of Barnikow and
Burdette made up fora nail-biting 9-8 loss to
Washington last week, posting an 8-4 victory
over No. 42 Jody Scheldt and Havlicek.
Based on today's performance, it's hard
to envision the duo giving up six match
points against the Huskies' Claire Carter
and Dea Sumantri.
"I don't think our confidence took much
of a hit from last week," Barnikow said.
"We'd rather save our best tennis for when
we play NCAAs."
Of course, when your team's tightest

win of the season is a 5-2 trouncing of
No. 6 Washington, the prospects can
only brighten for the second half of sea
son play.
This lime around, Pac-10 match scores
count towards the final standings.

"The honeymoon's over," Logar said
in reference to the string of less-competi
tive matches preceding the Cal show
down yesterday. "We have to buckle
down. We have seven weeks left and the
task at hand is to raise our level of play at

each match."
Stanford will remain in high gear and
on home court this weekend, taking on
No. 8 Southern California Friday at
1:30 p.m. and No. 9 UCLA on Saturday
at noon.
