# Track to compete in Texas
## 
### EMIL MARTENSEK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the outdoor season well
under way, the Stanford track and
field teams will travel to the 77th
running of the Texas Relays in
Austin, Texas.
Last year in Austin, the women's
1,600-meter relay team broke the
long-standing school record in a time
of 3:34.82. Meanwhile, the men
claimed first in their respective 1,600-
meter relay race.
Both the men's and women's
squads should again send strong
1,600-meter relay teams. The women
will also send a 3,200-meter relay and
a distance medley team. The men
will be running a 400-meter relay
team as well.
The Cardinal will also be sending
several athletes to compete as indi
viduals. In the shot put, senior Jillian
Camarena will face off against Ne
braska's Becky Breisch who took sec
ond by just two inches over Camare
na's third-place throw during the In
door National Championships.
Freshmen Janice Davis and Ash
ley Purnell will both run the 100-
meter dash while senior Lindsey
Johnson will look to eclipse the

school record in the 100-meter hur
dles as she did in Austin last year.
Sophomore Solomon Welch will
be competing individually for the
men in both the long and triple jumps.
Because some athletes on the
squads are still recovering from in
juries or from last weekend's Stan
ford Invitational the group this week
end is only a limited group from the
team, which has over 100 athletes.
"We've had some tough
breaks," said head women's coach
Edrick Floreal. "We've had some
health problems.
"But most of the health issues
have begun to go away already. We
just can't race them too fast too soon.
We want to see how people recov
ered from competing at the Stanford
Invitational before we decide who to
race in Texas."
And many of Stanford's top track
and field athletes may need a break
after their performances last Friday
and Saturday at Cobb Track and An
gell Field.
Twenty Stanford athletes hit Re
gional qualifying marks during the
two day competition.
Initiated last year to increase the
field sizes of the NCAA Track and
Field Championships, athletes

must first qualify to a Regional
Championship from which the top
five athletes from each region and
six at-large athletes across the na
tion earn automatic bids to the Na
tional Championships.
Leading the Cardinal towards
these regional showdowns at the end
of the year was Camarena who tied
her own school record of 57 feet, 3.75
inches in the shot put and currently
leads the NCAA in the event.
Following in fine form was fresh
man Arianna Lambie who returned
to competition in the 1,500 meters
after battling injury for four months.
Lambie ran the fastest time in the
NCAA so far this year while placing
fourth against professional runners in
a time of 4:17.01.
Also in the 1,500 was senior Katie
Hotchkiss who ran a personal best
4:20.34, earning her the sixth best
time in the nation.
Sophomore Chinny Offor has
continued her transition up to 800
meters, running the sixth best time in
school history and sixth best of the
year in the NCAA.
On the men's side, senior Jay Goff
threw a personal best of 210-3 in the
Javelin to earn a trip to the West Re
gional Chainpionhips.

Sophomore Jacob Gomez earned
a trip to regionals by posting a quick
early-season 13:56.77 over 5,000 me
ters. Four other Stanford runners
also dipped under the regional qual
ifying time.
Senior Andy Powell also showed
grit, returning after nearly three
years away from competitive racing
due to injury, Powell posted a solid
3:47.24 in the 1,500 to earn a spot in
the regional meet.
In the triple jump, sophomore
Solomon Welch also punched his
ticket to the regional meet with a sea
son best jump of 50-4 3/4.
"We have a much better oppor
tunity to be a much better team
outdoors than during indoors,"
Floreal said. "We should have a lot
more people at the NCAA Out
door Championships than at the
Indoor Championships.
"There are many opportunities
for better performances, and that
should carry on to the Pacific-10
Conference Championships as well
as regionals and nationals. One
performance makes a huge differ
ence fora team's confidence; the
athletes feed off each other. I think
that gives us a great opportunity to
be a better team."
