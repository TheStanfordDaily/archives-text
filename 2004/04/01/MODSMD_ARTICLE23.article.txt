# Baylor's season shortchanged
## 
### DAVID WEICHMAN UNIVERSITY DAILY 
(U-WIRE) LUBBOCK, Texas
— What would Baylor coach Kim
Mulkey-Robertson and her Lady
Bears do if they were not sur
rounded by controversy? They
could stop asking the question.

why? They could stop talking
about controversy, and most im
portantly, they might be going to
the Elite Eight.
The Baylor program has seen its
fair share of questionable calls and
controversy since Mulkey-Robert
son took over the team four years
ago. She has risen the program
from the bowels of the Big 12 Con
ference and turned it into a force to
be reckoned with, reaching the
NCAA tournament in three of her
four years.
Sunday night the Lady Bears
had a chance to do something that
has been unheard of. They were
seconds away from sending power
house Tennessee Lady Volunteers
home before the Elite Eight. Ten
nessee has gone that deep now nine
of the last 10 years. Ten years!
That's a decade's worth of domi
nance that was almost sent crash
ing to the floor of the Lloyd Noble
Center in Norman, Okla., but Old
Man Controversy came back to
bite Baylor.
The game was knotted at 69
when Baylor guard Jessika Stratton
drove to the hoop with nine seconds
left. She lost the ball, and Tennessee
ran down the floor. Shyra Ely
missed the fastbreak layup, and
Stratton fought for the rebound with
Tennessee's Tasha Butts. Butts

missed a tip in.and Stratton was
called fora foul. Referees reviewed
the play to see if the foul was called
with time remaining.
Remember, it is 69-69 at this
point. It has been a tightly contested
game most of the way, and this
could be the biggest upset of the
tournament in the makings if we go
to overtime.
However, there were 0.2 seconds
left when the whistle blew. Baylor is
a private Baptist institution; you
would think the heavens would at
least be on the Lady Bears' side.
Wrong — Butts goes to the free
throw line and makes both shots to
seal the deal at 71-69 with 0.2 sec
onds remaining.
What is wrong with college bas
ketball? How on earth can a call
like this be allowed to happen?
Mulkey-Robertson has had to deal
with things like this her entire ca
reer at Baylor.
Just this year at Tech. a contro
versial call that involved Stratton
stepping on the baseline with less
than seven seconds left gave the
Lady Raiders the ball and an oppor
tunity to get to the foul line and pull
away, 64-63.
Last season, one of her players
was called fora technical foul with
three minutes left in the game,
something Mulkey-Robertson

would later say changed the mo
mentum of the game.
What does she have to do to get a
call go her way, especially in the
Sweet 16 against a No. 1 seed?
This question is being asked all
over the place. Writers wanted to
speak with the refs after the game,
hut according to NCAA rules that is
only allowed to explain a fight or if a
committee deems it necessary to
benefit the game. Media personnel
did not get their wish to speak with
the officiating crew.
ESPN women's basketball ana
lyst Nell Fortner said the call was an
outrage. She, along with countless
others, I am sure, wanted to see the
game go to overtime.
"This is unfortunate for all the
players." she said. "In a situation
like this, you have to let them dictate
the outcome of the game."
That sounds eerily like Mulkey-
Robertson's rant in Lubbock in
January. So we know Baylor has a
few supporters. Try 18,005. That's
how many people had voted on an
ESPN.com poll (77.6 percent) that
the foul should not have been
called, and the game should have
gone to overtime.
Hopefully, the NCAA will take
that into consideration, and we can
see the players begin to determine
the outcome of games again.

speak with the refs after the game,
hut according to NCAA rules that is
only allowed to explain a fight or if a
committee deems it necessary to
benefit the game. Media personnel
did not get their wish to speak with
the officiating crew.
ESPN women's basketball ana
lyst Nell Fortner said the call was an
outrage. She, along with countless
others, I am sure, wanted to see the
game go to overtime.
"This is unfortunate for all the
players." she said. "In a situation
like this, you have to let them dictate
the outcome of the game."
That sounds eerily like Mulkey-
Robertson's rant in Lubbock in
January. So we know Baylor has a
few supporters. Try 18,005. That's
how many people had voted on an
ESPN.com poll (77.6 percent) that
the foul should not have been
called, and the game should have
gone to overtime.
Hopefully, the NCAA will take
that into consideration, and we can
see the players begin to determine
the outcome of games again.
