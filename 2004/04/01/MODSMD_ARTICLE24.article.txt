# Northern Illinois finds no violations

### LIBBY JOHN NORTHERN STAR 
(U-WIRE) DEKALB, 111. â€” The committee appointed by Northern
Illinois President John Peters to investigate an alleged NIU football re
cruitment party met with Peters on Monday to report its findings.
George Shur, chairman of the committee and former general coun
sel, said the committee concluded it was an isolated incident.
The committee was formed in mid-February to investigate the al
leged party held on Dec. 5 at Amnesia because it was reported to be a
university-sponsored party.
Athletic officials said it was not NIU-related.
At that party, former manager James Sanfilippo allegedly told the
party organizer to have people over 21 years of age pass their IDs to un
derage patrons. The bar also is charged with charging a flat fee for an un
limited amount of draft beer.
The club received a fine and a suspension of its liquor license because
of that party and other incidents that occurred that weekend.
The committee also determined the party, or any other incidents, did
not violate any NCAA regulations.
Shur said the committee has met six or seven times since its forma
tion.
During the investigation, the committee interviewed current ath
letes, athletic administrators, NCAA compliance officers and head
coaches and recruiting coordinators for football, volleyball and men's
and women's basketball.
It also talked to DeKalb, 111., police and city officials to determine if
this type of incident had occurred before.
"They indicated that this was isolated, and there was no pattern,"
Shur said.
Shur said this was not the beginning of any major changes for the ath
letics department or recruiting practices at NIU.
He said the committee wanted to make sure the university had good
control over the athletics programs, and the answer is yes.
The president's office and intercollegiate athletics are looking over
the report.
The committee has been dismantled for now.
"Our work is done," Shur said.
