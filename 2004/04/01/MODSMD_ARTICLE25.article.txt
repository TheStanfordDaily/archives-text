## 
### DANDAN WU 
To honor the partnerships that exist between
Stanford and its neighbors, the Office of Public
Affairs presented Community Partnership
Awards to three local organizations at a luncheon
yesterday. This is the awards' inaugural year
The winners are East Palo Alto Tennis and Tu
toring (EPATT), Partners in Caring (PIC) and the
Stanford Community Law Clinic (SCLC). They
were selected based on initiative, leadership and
involvement, and they embody the spirit of gen
uine partnership and benefit the overall community.
"The reason to give this award is to raise aware
ness ol the hundreds of programs going on between
Stanford and local communities," said Gordon
Earle, vice president for Public Affairs. "It is not
only to honor programs that won, but also to cele
brate all programs that do good work and deserve to
be recognized."
The Office of Public Affairs sent 150 letters to
local organizations asking for nominations and re
ceived 75 responses.

"The candidates were many in number and
varied," Earle said. "There were a broad scope of
individuals and groups ranging from social to ath
letic, science and medical programs."
EPATT matches approximately 100 East Palo
Alto students with more than 140 volunteer tu
tors, most of whom are Stanford students. Using a
unique blend of one-on-one academic tutoring
and tennis instruction, EPATT strives to enrich
the academic, athletic and social skills of its participants.
According to Kesha Weekes, the academic direc
tor of EPATT, the program has made a significant
impact on the East Palo Alto community over the
past 16 years, with 600 children benefiting. EPATT
has become a vehicle through which the entire com
munity has been given the opportunity to play tennis.
"We are honored to not only be on the Stanford
campus, but to be recognized by the Stanford
community," Weekes said. "Our location of the
past six years has helped us tremendously in mak
ing us close to our volunteer base, but more than
that, it has exposed our students to the reality of
college on a daily basis."

Partners in Caring is a community partnership
between Stanford Hospital and Clinics and
Avenidas. It matches more than 1(X) volunteers
with approximately 100 homebound residents in
communities from Los Altos to Redwood City,
and provides them with practical and emotional
support to help them maintain independence.
Still in its first year, the Stanford Community
Law Clinic was created though a partnership be
tween Stanford University, Stanford Law School,
the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo and many
local law firms. It offers free legal advice and ser
vices to low-income residents in East Palo Alto,
Menlo Park and Redwood City.
Earle said, "My impression is that there has al
ways been a strong civic sense of volunteerism in
the Stanford community."
Earle also noted that the awards partnership is
part of the same celebration as Stanford's Com
munity Day on April 4. He said that the Office of
Public affairs had every expectation that the
awards will continue next year.
"It is always important to raise awareness," he said.
