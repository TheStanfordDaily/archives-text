# Conference to celebrate Taiwanese culture
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
This Friday and Saturday, a new
campus association of Taiwanese
American students will see the cul
mination of its yearlong effort to
bring the ITASA West Coast 2004
culture conference to Stanford.
The conference, sponsored by
Stanford's chapter of the Intercolle
giate Taiwanese American Student
Association (ITASA), features a va
riety of speakers and workshops that
address the theme of "seeking the
new Taiwan spirit." Speaking events
include journalist Bill Wong on the
development of Asian America and

actor Roger Fan's personal account
of the Asian-American acting expe
rience. Workshops range in content
from the history of Taiwan to tradi
tional Taiwanese folk dance.
11 ASA co-chair junior Dennis
Chang said that although Taiwan is
commonly known for its political re
lations with China, Taiwanese cul
ture will he a main focus of this
weekend's conference.
"There's a good mix of cultural,
historical and political events," he
said. "What's important is that we've
all come together to celebrate the
culture and history. We think that it
will he one of the most successful of
the ITASA West Coast conferences."

Underscoring the importance of
the event, the Taiwanese Cultural
Society (TCS) has decided to
reschedule Night Market — its an
nual celebration of Asian American
culture — to coincide with the
ITASA conference.
The national ITASA organiza
tion oversees three conferences each
year — one on the East Coast, one in
the Midwest and one on the West
Coast — and a group of Stanford
students won the bid to host the 2004
conference at last year's event,
Chang said. Since then, he and
ITASA co-chair James Lu have
been laboring continuously with ap
proximately thirty people from the

Stanford community to plan the events.
"We've been working on it pretty
much nonstop," Chang said. "It's
been pretty consuming this past cou
ple of weeks, but I'm really, really
excited. We're obviously a bit appre
hensive about certain challenges, but
we think that everything will run
smoothly, given the pi;inning that we did"
Chang credited the strength and
unity of the University's Taiwanese
community for bringing the large
conference to Stanford.
"We are really proud that the Tai
wanese student body is one of the
most active cultural organizations on
campus," he said. "We are also
proud of their identification to Tai

wanese origins and culture and history."
Until last April, the Taiwanese
Cultural Society (TCS) was the only
student organization on campus that
represented Taiwanese culture. But
when a group of TCS members and
other Stanford students joined to
gether to host the ITASA confer
ence, Stanford developed a second
Taiwanese American student association.
In addition to the organizational
help from within the University
community, Stanford's ITASA
chapter also received a great deal of
financial support from the Universi
ty and from the surrounding Bay
Area community.
"We've been doing fundraising

from Taiwanese parents, at Chinese
schools and at Taiwanese American
businesses," Chang said. "We've also
received funding from The Stanford
Fund, ASSU and the Taipei Econom
ic and Cultural Office in San Francis
co, which is the de facto Taiwanese
embassy in the United States."
The conference, that the Univer
sity previously hosted in 2000, has
led participants and organizers to
anticipate the conference's second
run with enthusiasm.
"They've been talking about
bringing ITASA back to Stanford
fora while, so it's pretty exciting to
see it come to fruition," said publici
ty contact Crystal Tsai, a senior.
