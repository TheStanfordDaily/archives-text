# 'Potter College' to foster research
## 
### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Aiming to encourage a broad approach to undergraduate student re
search and counter the isolation that often accompanies such an endeavor,
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education John Bravman has announced
the creation of Potter College, a residential community to be located in Ster
ling Quadrangle. Some students have welcomed this project, predicting that
it will create a supportive academic community for those engaged in re
search, while others have criticized it for its potential to isolate the dorm's
residents in an antisocial environment.
"Independent scholarship, creative explorations, thesis-writing â€”
these can all be lonely enterprises," Bravman explained. "Our goal is to
provide the most supportive environment possible for students engaged in
these endeavors."
Potter College residents will benefit from staff support through a Fac
ulty Fellows Program and will take part in the planning of in-college col
loquia. Students do not need to be part of a particular discipline to join
Potter College, but should have a desire to extend the academic experience to
their residences.
Assistant Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Carol Porter, who
previously worked in a freshman-sophomore residential college at Prince
ton, will act as College Director for Potter College.
"One of the things I learned at Princeton, where juniors and seniors were
all required to do independent work their junior year, and theses their senior
year, was the extent to which a shared experience could create great cama
raderie among students," Porter said.
The College is described as a "programmatic cousin" of Freshman Sopho
more College, as the two will share certain staff and programs. Bravman will
also act as dean for both residences.
"Since the Potter dorm staff will be a separate entity from the FroSoCo
staff, and the house will have its own separate programs, it'll be something
new," said Andrew Dimock, a FroSoCo college director. "What the two col
leges will share is the same goal of bringing intellectual exploration into the
residences, through voluntary programs rather than required seminars, and
of helping undergraduates make connections with faculty."
According to Tracy Williams, a former college assistant in FroSoCo, "It
may be very nice for FroSoCo to have a sort of sister community in Sterling
Quad. As much as we tried to encourage interaction with Robinson and Pot
ter last year, it was a very difficult bridge to gap since the two environments
were so different."
Part of the difference between the two colleges will be Potter Col
lege's focus on individual research. The impetus for the college's cre
ation was, according to Bravman, the expansion of undergraduate opportuni
ties for research.
"Over the past five years Stanford has very significantly increased the re
sources available for undergraduate research and scholarship," he said. "We
thought it was time to try a residential component of this effort, to offer a
small group of students who share a deep passion for intellectual exploration
a chance to develop their ideas in the context of a common living group."
Junior Jordi Mata-Fink, a former resident of FroSoCo, said he anticipates
a vibrant community in the new Potter College.
"I think it's really exciting," he said. "It's a great opportunity to move in
tellectual inspiration to a dorm setting outside of the classroom."
Not everyone shares this enthusiasm, however. Students outside the
FroSoCo community have expressed serious doubts about the desirability of
Potter College in the draw and the quality of life within the College next year.
"It could get intense," said junior Victoria Fayer. "It will just be fostering
an anti-social atmosphere."
Some students feared that the location of Sterling Quad would render
Potter College undesirable.
"FroSoCo is isolated enough," said junior Mary Stone. "To continue that
among upperclassmen would be a blight on the undergraduate experience."
Others feared that the theme of the college would create an environment
with little social activity.
"If research is isolating, then putting a group of students involved in re
search together seems counterproductive," said junior Alicia Dantzker.
"You will be putting kids together that don't have time for each other. I don't
think that sounds vibrant."
Junior Miya Woolfalk agreed that the college might be antisocial, but said
that this might not be a problem.
"It's going to isolate students, hut that's prob
ably what they want," she said. "It's good if re
search is what you want to do."
Mata-Fink predicted that Potter College, like
FroSoCo, might gain a reputation for lacking so
cial life, but that this reputation may very well be
misleading.
"Since GovCo is far away. Potter may be
known as antisocial, but in my experience what
determines the social situation is a caring resi
dence community which I definitely found in
FroSoCo," he said.
Most in the FroSoCo community are not dis
couraged by the low number of students that

draw into FroSoCo each year.
"The residence will he composed of all new
people drawing in who will he ahle to start their
own community," Williams said. "I think this
makes the draw situation very different from
Frosoco. With the residence-hased program
ming as well as the common shared interest in re
search and scholarship, I think it could he a very
social place."
Dimock noted that the number of students
drawing into FroSoCo may he misleading, he
cause most residents enter FroSoCo as freshmen
or second-year residents, who are guaranteed
housing and do not enter the Draw.
"The degree of sociability within a dorm is
a reflection of the students there, not the
programmatic goals of a particular house,"
Bravman said. "The community will benefit
from having one more choice in their living
arrangements."
