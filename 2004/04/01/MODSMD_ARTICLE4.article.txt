### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ JR. CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an all-day celebration of Stan
ford's diverse art community, the
Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts (SOCA) plans to bring art,
music and food to White Plaza this
Friday in its sth annual An Art Affair.
As the largest Stanford arts event
of the year. An Art Affair 2004 will
exhibit 500 types of visual art and
over 100 performances, including
painting, sculpture, photography,
poetry, film, juggling, mariachi, the
ater, martial arts, creative writing
and live rock music.
"This event will give people a
chance to share their talents that
might otherwise go unnoticed," said
SOCA President Joan MacMillan, a
senior. "We hope that An Art Affair
will increase an appreciation and an
awareness of the arts and talents of
members of the Stanford community."

Visual arts will be on display in
tents and performance stages will
provide a platform for spoken word
artists and musicians to display their
talents. An interactive art section
will also be included, giving students
a chance to participate in the cre
ative process.
Unique to this year's event will be
media coverage provided by KZSU
90.1 FM. Also new to An Art Affair
will be a third tent housing additional
visual art and a third performance stage.
"We are hoping that the addition
of a third tent will create a more inti
mate setting for some of the spoken
word and acoustic performances,"
MacMillan said.
Later in the evening, attendees
may enjoy free gourmet meals pro
vided by the Stanford Cooking
Club, as well as live musical enter
tainment from some of the groups
featured on the Stanford Sound
track Volume 3. The eighteen bands
featured on this musical compila

tion were selected from a pool of
nearly 50 applicants. Some of these
musicians will be distributing free
copies of the Stanford Soundtrack ata
special CD release party.
An Art Affair was originally
conceived when SOCA members
recognized an under-representa
tion of the arts at Stanford in com
parison with athletics and acade
mics. This realization led to the cre
ation of An Art Affair, MacMillan
said. Today, the idea of uniting the
Stanford art community through
An Art Affair continues to inspire
SOCA members.
"An Art Affair is my dream
come-true event — a place where 1
can share my artwork and music and
engage with hundreds of other cre
ative members of the Stanford com
munity," said SOCA member
Megan Miller, a sophomore. "1 am
hoping that An Art Affair will bring
together the majority of the creative

community we have here at Stanford
in a constructive and fun way, giving
the arts more of the attention that
they deserve."
SOCA members anticipate the
event's creative atmosphere and
hope to draw a large audience of
Stanford faculty, students
and staff.
"I look forward to seeing the
Stanford community have a truly en
joyable day full of all the diversity

that art allows," Miller said. "I espe
cially look forward to mingling with
the people in the visual arts tents and
getting to know the musicians and
performers that are usually hiding in
the Stanford woodwork."
According to MacMillan, both
the attendees and artists make the
event worthwhile.
"What makes me excited is
when I see all the people at the
event and hearing their positive re
actions," she said. "I just really
love seeing so much creativity all in
one location all at the same time
the quality and quantity can be
overwhelming. And the dinner is
always amazing."
