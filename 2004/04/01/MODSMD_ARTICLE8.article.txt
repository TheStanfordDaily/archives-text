## Energy bars: Power foods or sugary snacks? 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
It's 8:50 a.m. on a weekday and you just rolled out of
bed. Three minutes to throw on some clothes, two min
utes to rush to the bathroom and five minutes to get to
class. Breakfast? Forget it, you say, I just don't have
time to eat — or you could grab an "energy bar" that is
easy to carry and can be eaten surreptitiously in class.
Although they were originally designed for athletes
looking for an on-the-go snack, nutrition bars, market
ed as "energy bars," "meal replacement bars," "sports
bars" and a long list of other names aren't just popular
among elite athletes — many people consume them as
snacks or in lieu of a meal. According to Consumer Re
ports, Americans spend nearly $1.4 billion per year on
brands like Powerßar, Clif, Clif Luna, Carb Solutions,
Atkins Advantage and Ultra-Slim Fast.
And each month, it appears that there are more op
tions to choose from. You could go for the popular
"Zone" plan — each bar has the ostensibly hormone
regulating magical balance of 40 percent calories from
carbohydrate and 30 percent each from protein and fat
— or you could try one of the new low-carbohydrate
bars, which promise to deliver a protein-packed snack
with few carbs.
Nutritional powerhouses or fortified candy bars?
Experts — from nutritionists to top athletes to train
ers — are divided on the place that energy bars should
occupy in the diet, but all agree that energy bars should
not replace whole foods on a regular basis. Elizabeth
Applegate, a nutritionist and exercise expert at UC-
Davis advises people "not to replace wholesome foods
with energy bars," but recognizes that they can be a bet
ter option than junk food snacks.
"If you're going to grab a candy bar or a box of cook
ies" as a snack, she wrote in the Center for Science in the
Public Interest's Nutrition Action Health Letter, "it's
better to have an energy bar."
Vivian Crisman, the nutritionist at the Vaden Stu
dent Health Center echoed Applegate's thoughts — so
long as energy bars were eaten every once in a while.
"You have to look at your motivations for eating an
energy bar," Crisman said. If you are eating it as a meal
replacement every single day, you may be short-chang
ing yourself on nutrients. If you are eating it as a snack
and you are a sedentary female, it may not be the best
choice; a piece of fruit or a smaller granola bar may be a
better option."
"That being said," she added, "if you are a person
who is constantly on the go, it doesn't hurt to have an
energy bar in your backpack for those days that you are
very busy and don't have time to go back to the dining
hall to get some food. They can be a real lifesaver for
those days when you are very hungry and don't much
time to spare."
Just for athletes?
Many athletes use energy bars as a way to gain quick
energy during a long exercise period or for muscle recov
ery after exercise. Runner Todd Williams, who once held
the world record for the 10,000-meter track race and
competed in the 1992 Olympics told Runner's World
magazine that he thought energy bars were indispens
able for the serious athlete.
"Treat them as part of your training equipment,"
Williams said. "Take them to practice, have one after a
workout, or maybe before."
Although energy bars are efficiently packed and
ready to go, other foods already in your diet may do the
trick. One study conducted at Ball State University in In
diana found that cyclists who ate bagels had the same
aerobic performance as those who ate energy bars.
"There's no magic to the bars," David Pearson, the
primary investigator of the study, commented in a press
release after completing the story. "As long as you're get
ting the same number of calories and carbs in each food,
there's no advantage to eating energy bars, and they're
much more expensive."
For the non-athlete student, energy bars are not nec
essary pre- or post-workout if the exercise period is of

moderate intensity and lasts less than an hour. More
over, researchers theorize that consuming something
sugary immediately before a competitive event may
trigger insulin — a blood-glucose regulating hormone
— that may lead to lowered blood glucose levels and
fatigue. Within an hour of a competition, the best
thing for your body may be plain water.
When you can't trust the labels
When you chomp down on an energy bar, you may
glance at the nutrition label to determine exactly what
you are eating, but most of us would never think twice
about whether the nutrition label is telling the whole
truth. Sometimes, much to the horror of those who
watch their calories, manufacturers have not been
completely trustworthy. In April and May 2001, Con
sumer Lab.com, an independent lab that evaluates
health and wellness products and grants a seal of ap
proval for those meeting the lab's criteria, tested 30
different nutrition bars.
Of the 30 energy bars tested — ranging from "Low-
Carb" bars to meal replacement bars — a full 60 per
cent failed to meet their labeling claims. The most
common deception was in the number of carbohy
drates: Fifty percent of the nutrition bars "exceeded
their claimed levels of carbohydrates," according the
Consumer Labs.com Web site. The Food and Drug
Administration sent warning letters to manufacturers,
but consumers should be wary that the labels are no
guarantee of the product inside.
Choosing the best bar for your buck
If you're still set on eating energy bars, you can
choose from a medley of nutritional options and
dozens of flavors: double-chocolate, chocolate
peanut crunch, cranberry-apple-cherry, just to name
a few. And the prices vary enormously as well — a
week's worth of Carb Solutions at Tresidder Express
could set you back almost $20, while the same quan
tify of Tiger's Milk bars would only be around $7.
Given all of these choices — nutritionally, economi
cally and taste-wise — we've decided to narrow
down your choices, letting you choose the best bar
your money can buy.
The Daily has analyzed these bars for taste, nutri
tion and price. A test panel composed of 10 students
tasted each bar and rated it on texture, taste and af
tertaste on a one-to-five scale, with five as the best
possible score. The nutritional analysis included
comparing the bars in terms of the number of calo
ries; grams of fat, protein, carbohydrates (including
sugars and fiber); and vitamin and mineral content.
Prices are all from Tresidder Express.
The bottom line
After tasting 10 energy bars, the taste panel agreed
that while some bars could be good fora quick snack,
there is really no substitute for real, wholesome, nutri
tious food —on a price, taste and nutrition level.
Some bars rated so poorly, such as the high-protein
bars like Carb Solutions in the "Creamy Chocolate
Peanut Butter" flavor and Power Bar Protein Plus in
"Chocolate Peanut Butter" (see box) that tasters had
to spit out the samples. The high protein count in these
energy bars could also make them more difficult to di
gest, something to think about if you're thinking of
eating them before or during training sessions. A bar
higher in carbohydrates would provide instant ener
gy and may save you the stomachache.
Others could make fora good quick breakfast or
a snack, such as the Clif Bar in the "Cranberry Apple
Cherry" flavor, the Luna Bar in "Nutz over Choco
late," Tiger's Milk Bar in "Peanut Butter" or the
Odwalla Bar in the "Chocolate" flavor. Yet due to
their differing caloric content, some would make a
good meal replacement and some are better as a
light snack — check the labels carefully.
Finally, most energy bars are high in sugar and pro
cessed products, so keep in mind that while they are
healthier than your average Snickers bar, there's noth
ing like actually sitting down and having a real meal.
