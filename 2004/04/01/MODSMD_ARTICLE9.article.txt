## The perils of perfectionism
### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Right before spring break, to cele
brate my friend's acceptance into the
University of Massachusetts Medical
School, my friend and I made a pilgrim
age over to the Korea House restaurant
in Santa Clara. With the help of a little
warm sake, we gorged ourselves silly
until we found ourselves in a state of
gluttonous contentment.
In our food-induced stupor, my friend
let me in on a secret. While he was happy
that he got into Massachusetts — his
first choice — he told me that lurking in
the back of his mind, he was hoping for
something more, acceptance into Yale
Medical School.
But Massachusetts had been the
school of his dreams since we set foot on
the Stanford campus, the reason he had
tirelessly toiled in his studies the last few
years. I thought he was nuts. I thought he
was greedy — after all, he had achieved
his dream. And then I thought, damn, I
would've had the exact same thought:
second-guessing a dream due to name

brand value.
You see, I've spent a large chunk of my
life as a Type A perfectionist, a person
who takes over when necessary, competes
to the bitter end and, above all, hates fail
ure. Certainly the fine line between confi
dence and blind arrogance is blurred. After
all, I'm self-absorbed enough to pen this ar
ticle about my own neurotic tendencies.
At Stanford, however, it gets worse. We
don't just aim to be perfect; we strive for
effortless perfectionism. People like to use
the duck analogy — everything's calm on
the surface, but we're paddling furiously
underneath. But if we continue the cha
rade, then, when we least expect it, we'll be
shot and flam Wed for dinner. A lucky sub
set, blessed with unswerving ambition, ar
rive at Stanford and keep plugging away
successfully, their life goals already clean
ly mapped out. Others, upon discovering
that tneir best is no longer good enough,
either modify their personal standards or,
worse, give up altogether, resigned to their
fate as ones who barely scrape by (at least
according to Stanford ideals.)
Psychiatrists, as they are inclined to do,
have labeled perfectionism as a clinical

malady that should be treated. As defined
in the literature, perfectionism is the prac
tice of demanding of oneself or others a
higher quality of performance than is re
quired by the situation. Naturally, perfec
tionists set unrealistically high standards
and rigidly adhere to them. A small dose
of motivation is good, because it allows
you to keep pushing the boundaries of
your own capabilities and instills a strong
sense of purpose. However, taken to an
extreme, perfectionism is detrimental.
When you define your self-worth in terms
of achieving your high standards, then
you become mercilessly self-critical. This
can lead to depression, social phobias, ob
sessive-compulsive disorders, even sui
cide, ideation.
So how does a perfectionist cope? Sur
prisingly, like a wounded puppy, he scam
pers away before the problem can be dealt
with in full. Procrastination, for example, is
common, because the desire to complete a
task perfectly will make it difficult or un
pleasant to wade through. Even before the
task is completed, moreover, it might be
dropped if tne standards are unlikely to be
met — better to abandon something alto

gether than turn in a half-hearted effort.
Demanding parents, it is generally ac
cepted, are the culprits for cursing us
with perfectionist tendencies. Parents
can either hold excessively high stan
dards and expectations or, being perfec
tionists themselves, act as models for
unerring attitudes and behaviors. Never
theless, while parents may be the cata
lysts growing up, we, as young adults, are
ultimately responsible for how far we
will allow perfectionism to take us. Yes,
perfectionism is initially rewarding —
after all, it is partly responsible for our
acceptance to Stanford — but the posi
tive feedback eventually stops as our
stratospheric goals become unattain
able. This, in turn, can cause fatigue and
stress and eventually shackle our own
physical health.
To remedy the problem, psychiatrists
suggest two methods of attack. The first
involves thought experiments: taking
the perspective of the other person who
may be affected by your excessively high
standards; paying attention to the big
picture rather than small details and
considering the repercussions of your

actions. The second strategy involves
graded exposure, where you consciously
initiate messy behavior (not folding your
laundry, for example) before working
your way up to larger issues (editing
your paper only once or twice before
handing it in).
Sometimes I think if a person had it all
— the mansion, the trophy spouse, the
chairmanship of a monopolizing conglom
erate — he would eventually reach a state
of blissful contentment. And then I read an
article about how members of the Forbes
Fortune 500 list make it their life goal to
jockey fora higher ranking, and become
disillusioned. Perhaps it would be easier if
we could just look around, happy that, atop
our perch in the intelligence hierarchy,
we're already more successful than the vast
majority of the populace.
But we can't. And so we keep pushing,
higher and higher, until we finally grasp
the stars. Or fall flat on our faces trying, re
alizing that perfectionism isn't the best
way to go.
