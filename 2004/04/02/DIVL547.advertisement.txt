The ultimate triumph
March 18, 2004
When a nation comes to adulthood, to maturity, it relates to
other nations in a completely different way than hitherto. It begins
to respect the Rule of Law, which binds all nations together in mutu
al responsibility and need. The sign of a growing maturity is pre
cisely this respect for the laws which men have found necessary to
living together in peace.
From time to time, a nation may feel powerful enough to
ignore the law which irks its ambition to dominate, ;uid to make
war despite the warnings of restraint from its friends.
Thus it is today that the United States, now, alone, a 'superpow
er,' vexes and worries the people of more mature nations who have
grown to see the folly of unilateral action outside the Rule of Law.
The young and over-confident 'superpower,' flexing its mus
cles, will overreach itself, and the sooner this happens the safer for
the world. Already a steadily growing chaos exacts due cost in loss
of life, both American and Iraqi. The seal of Pandora's Box has been
broken and from it has stepped a monster, out of control. To be
sure, the US administration wear as brave a face as they can muster,
but behind the scenes, they are worried indeed, and seek desper
ately a less than ignominious method of withdrawal.
Meanwhile, the defeated Iraqi army fights a guerrilla war with
some success, while religious groups, seizing their opportunity,
increase the tension with calls for civil war. Thus, the paramount
adventure of the American President, designed to demonstrate the
invincibility of the United States, has little to show for its efforts and
very much still to lose.
When, at last, the US Government sees for itself the folly of this
reckless and unnecessary war, it will not, of course, admit this to
the world. Rather, it will seek to gain the support of the United
Nations to extricate itself from this embarrassing blunder, and, if
possible, to lay the blame elsewhere.
When, among nations, the Rule of Law is ignored, the whole
world suffers. Thus, today, the tension which has accompanied this
futile demonstration of military strength affects millions, innocent
of all terrorist action or mayhem. The world is struggling now with
epidemics of all kinds as the human immune system breaks down
under the stress. Did the warmongers but realize the karmic effects
of their ill-considered actions, they might well make amends and
take sightings for another course.
Maitreya, meanwhile, watches carefully this inharmonious sit
uation, ready to intervene if necessary, ready to emerge when pos
sible. Remember that Maitreya is in no doubt about the ultimate tri
umph of those who stand behind Him, who value peace and justice,
freedom and love. He knows that these are the mainsprings of
human existence and comes to see them enthroned in all.

"How I Write" Spring Quarter 2004
Conversations
Co-Sponsored by Undergraduate Research Programs and the Stanford Writing Center
"How 1 Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts and holts,
pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the conversation will primarily
focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idio
syncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer generates
ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition, overcomes various impediments and
blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that
all writers can learn and grow, and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights. Join
Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors Writing, Undergraduate Research Programs, in a conversa
tion on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers producing work in all fields and genres.

The ultimate triumph
March 18, 2004
When a nation comes to adulthood, to maturity, it relates to
other nations in a completely different way than hitherto. It begins
to respect the Rule of Law, which binds all nations together in mutu
al responsibility and need. The sign of a growing maturity is pre
cisely this respect for the laws which men have found necessary to
living together in peace.
From time to time, a nation may feel powerful enough to
ignore the law which irks its ambition to dominate, ;uid to make
war despite the warnings of restraint from its friends.
Thus it is today that the United States, now, alone, a 'superpow
er,' vexes and worries the people of more mature nations who have
grown to see the folly of unilateral action outside the Rule of Law.
The young and over-confident 'superpower,' flexing its mus
cles, will overreach itself, and the sooner this happens the safer for
the world. Already a steadily growing chaos exacts due cost in loss
of life, both American and Iraqi. The seal of Pandora's Box has been
broken and from it has stepped a monster, out of control. To be
sure, the US administration wear as brave a face as they can muster,
but behind the scenes, they are worried indeed, and seek desper
ately a less than ignominious method of withdrawal.
Meanwhile, the defeated Iraqi army fights a guerrilla war with
some success, while religious groups, seizing their opportunity,
increase the tension with calls for civil war. Thus, the paramount
adventure of the American President, designed to demonstrate the
invincibility of the United States, has little to show for its efforts and
very much still to lose.
When, at last, the US Government sees for itself the folly of this
reckless and unnecessary war, it will not, of course, admit this to
the world. Rather, it will seek to gain the support of the United
Nations to extricate itself from this embarrassing blunder, and, if
possible, to lay the blame elsewhere.
When, among nations, the Rule of Law is ignored, the whole
world suffers. Thus, today, the tension which has accompanied this
futile demonstration of military strength affects millions, innocent
of all terrorist action or mayhem. The world is struggling now with
epidemics of all kinds as the human immune system breaks down
under the stress. Did the warmongers but realize the karmic effects
of their ill-considered actions, they might well make amends and
take sightings for another course.
Maitreya, meanwhile, watches carefully this inharmonious sit
uation, ready to intervene if necessary, ready to emerge when pos
sible. Remember that Maitreya is in no doubt about the ultimate tri
umph of those who stand behind Him, who value peace and justice,
freedom and love. He knows that these are the mainsprings of
human existence and comes to see them enthroned in all.

"How I Write" Spring Quarter 2004
Conversations
Co-Sponsored by Undergraduate Research Programs and the Stanford Writing Center
"How 1 Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts and holts,
pleasures and pains, of all types of writing. While content is always an issue, the conversation will primarily
focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes, allowing us to examine habits, idio
syncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer generates
ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition, overcomes various impediments and
blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations. Writing communities share experiences (even bad ones), so that
all writers can learn and grow, and Stanford is an exceptionally rich community for gaining such insights. Join
Hilton Obenzinger, Associate Director for Honors Writing, Undergraduate Research Programs, in a conversa
tion on the techniques, quirks, and joys of advanced writers producing work in all fields and genres.

Computer), and he has played a key role in taking this technology to industry, serving on several boards of
