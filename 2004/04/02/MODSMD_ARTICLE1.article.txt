# Recording industry sues Stanford user
## 
### ALBERT CHIOU STAFF WRITER 
For the first time, the recording
industry has targeted an individual
at Stanford for illegally sharing
music through the University's com
puter network. The copyright in
fringement lawsuit came as part of a
new round of lawsuits that specifi
cally targeted file-sharers at univer
sities across the country.
The March 22 complaint filed by
the Recording Industry Association
of America (RIAA) against a user
on the Stanford network is known
as a "John Doe" suit because the
user is known only by IP address.
Before the RIAA can force Stan
ford to determine and reveal the in
dividual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though no
subpoena has been issued, the John
Doe suit is the first step in seeking a
court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA pres
ident Gary Sherman stated, "Obvi
ously, college students are a big part
of the [online piracy] problem, and
therefore it was only a question of
time before university users would
be named as defendants. That's
what happened yesterday. And we
hope that it will send a message to
students across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engaging it
can have consequences."
When asked why college students
are considered "a big part of the
problem," Sherman said that stu
dents' access to free and unlimited
bandwidth made college the ideal
setting for file-sharing. He cited sta
tistics posted by schools pointing to
heavy file-sharing by students and
complaints by record stores located
near universities.

According to Sherman, users at
Stanford and the other universities
were targeted because the RIAA is
"filing cases in different jurisdictions
around the country in a way that
maximizes the efficiency of the liti
gation process. The individuals tar
geted in this round happen to be in
the jurisdictions where we are filing
at this time."
Sherman also claimed that this
first round of suits against college
students is part of "an ongoing pro
gram" that will not end with the set
tlement of these cases.
This approach differs dramati
cally from the recording industry's
previous efforts to stop students
from illegally sharing music. Ac
cording to Debra Zumwalt, Stan
ford's general counsel, the normal
pattern is that the University re
ceives a complaint "if someone be
lieves that a Stanford network user
is infringing on copyrights.
"We quickly investigate and re
quest that any copyrighted materi
al is taken down," she continued.
"Stanford warns the user that any
additional violation of copyright
law can result in further action
being taken, which can include loss
of Stanford computer network
privileges, and employment or stu
dent discipline."
Zumwalt emphasized that illegal
file-sharing is both a violation of
copyright law and University policy.
According to an Aug. 1, 2003 letter
from Provost John Etchemendy to
the Stanford community, Stanford
will terminate computer access to re
peat offenders regardless of whether
or not they are subject to civil or
criminal prosecution.
While the lawsuit has been filed
against a Stanford network user, the
complaint does not target Stantord it
self, treating the University solely as
an Internet service provider. When
asked how the University would re
spond to the RIAA suit, Zumwalt
stated, "Stanford is not a party to the
lawsuit and therefore does not have
an official position on the lawsuit."
The recent lawsuit has caught the
attention of students around campus.
"It's a tough issue," said fresh
man Joe Larkin. "I don't think peo
ple should be downloading music
illegally, but at the same time I
don't think the RIAA is going
about it the right way. People

should respect the artists more, but
it seems like the RIAA is suing
people
For at least one student, who
wished to remain anonymous, the law
suit will make him think twice about
downloading and sharing music.
"I really don't want to get sued,"
the student said.
However, senior Anthony Berry
hill claims that the lawsuit doesn't
faze him at all.
"It wouldn't stop me because the
chances of getting caught are so low,
and I don't download the type of
music the RIAA is looking for,"
Berryhill said.
According to RIAA spokesman
Amanda Collins, the RIAA chooses
targets for lawsuits based on the
number of files they make available
through file-sharing. In this round of
lawsuits, the individuals being sued
shared an average of 837 files.

the Recording Industry Association
of America (RIAA) against a user
on the Stanford network is known
as a "John Doe" suit because the
user is known only by IP address.
Before the RIAA can force Stan
ford to determine and reveal the in
dividual's identity, it must obtain a
subpoena for the action. Though no
subpoena has been issued, the John
Doe suit is the first step in seeking a
court order.
In a March 24 press conference
with college journalists, RIAA pres
ident Gary Sherman stated, "Obvi
ously, college students are a big part
of the [online piracy] problem, and
therefore it was only a question of
time before university users would
be named as defendants. That's
what happened yesterday. And we
hope that it will send a message to
students across the country that this
activity is illegal and that engaging it
can have consequences."
When asked why college students
are considered "a big part of the
problem," Sherman said that stu
dents' access to free and unlimited
bandwidth made college the ideal
setting for file-sharing. He cited sta
tistics posted by schools pointing to
heavy file-sharing by students and
complaints by record stores located
near universities.

According to Sherman, users at
Stanford and the other universities
were targeted because the RIAA is
"filing cases in different jurisdictions
around the country in a way that
maximizes the efficiency of the liti
gation process. The individuals tar
geted in this round happen to be in
the jurisdictions where we are filing
at this time."
Sherman also claimed that this
first round of suits against college
students is part of "an ongoing pro
gram" that will not end with the set
tlement of these cases.
This approach differs dramati
cally from the recording industry's
previous efforts to stop students
from illegally sharing music. Ac
cording to Debra Zumwalt, Stan
ford's general counsel, the normal
pattern is that the University re
ceives a complaint "if someone be
lieves that a Stanford network user
is infringing on copyrights.
"We quickly investigate and re
quest that any copyrighted materi
al is taken down," she continued.
"Stanford warns the user that any
additional violation of copyright
law can result in further action
being taken, which can include loss
of Stanford computer network
privileges, and employment or stu
dent discipline."
Zumwalt emphasized that illegal
file-sharing is both a violation of
copyright law and University policy.
According to an Aug. 1, 2003 letter
from Provost John Etchemendy to
the Stanford community, Stanford
will terminate computer access to re
peat offenders regardless of whether
or not they are subject to civil or
criminal prosecution.
While the lawsuit has been filed
against a Stanford network user, the
complaint does not target Stantord it
self, treating the University solely as
an Internet service provider. When
asked how the University would re
spond to the RIAA suit, Zumwalt
stated, "Stanford is not a party to the
lawsuit and therefore does not have
an official position on the lawsuit."
The recent lawsuit has caught the
attention of students around campus.
"It's a tough issue," said fresh
man Joe Larkin. "I don't think peo
ple should be downloading music
illegally, but at the same time I
don't think the RIAA is going
about it the right way. People

should respect the artists more, but
it seems like the RIAA is suing
people
For at least one student, who
wished to remain anonymous, the law
suit will make him think twice about
downloading and sharing music.
"I really don't want to get sued,"
the student said.
However, senior Anthony Berry
hill claims that the lawsuit doesn't
faze him at all.
"It wouldn't stop me because the
chances of getting caught are so low,
and I don't download the type of
music the RIAA is looking for,"
Berryhill said.
According to RIAA spokesman
Amanda Collins, the RIAA chooses
targets for lawsuits based on the
number of files they make available
through file-sharing. In this round of
lawsuits, the individuals being sued
shared an average of 837 files.
