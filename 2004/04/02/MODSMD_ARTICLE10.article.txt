## Deep Thoughts 
### 
For most of us, spring quarter is a time to let loose, feel the sun on
our faces, forget where we went and what we did every weekend
and wonder where the hell we are when we wake up in a drunk
en haze. But for those few individuals running for ASSU presi
dent, it's a time to straighten up and look respectable and hard-working,
perhaps try to demonstrate to the student body that they really do care
about what's happening on campus despite their usual bullshit.
We don't care about what's happening, and we're not going to hide it.
Here are the pressing issues that are on our minds. We'll try to keep it

under 2,000 words.
1. Welcome back to our esteemed Se
nior Class president! It's great to have you
back. We're excited to see the year really
finish with a bang now that the Fab Four is
back together.
2. Why does spring quarter always start
with rain when during winter quarter fi
nals it's beautiful? Perhaps the ASSU
presidential candidates could address this
issue in their campaigns.
3. Most of us have figured out by now
that we don't have to buy all of the text
books "required" for our classes. But the

Stanford Bookstore — those business tycoons — have produced a
flawless advertising campaign: dressing Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie
in Stanford gear and surrounding them with cut-out farm animals and
cheap boxes that are supposed to be hay barrels, with a sign spelling out
"Stanford: The Simple Life." Maybe our textbook prices are so jacked
up because the Bookstore has to pay for the labor to create brilliant dis
plays like that, but in the end it's worth it because it totally makes us
want to buy ALL our books, even the optional ones.
4. Beer before liquor, get sick quicker.
5. Red light, red light, GREEN LIGHT! (Branner freshmen —
don't get any ideas.)
6. We knew that thefacebook.com was an incredible invention, but
now there's an exciting new feature that will change all of our lives: you
can now specify your significant other. This highlights that ancient ques
tion of relationship status — are you ready to align yourself with that
person for all of the Stanford community to see? And even though gay
marriage might be questioned in this country, thefacebook.com does
not discriminate against same-sex pairings. But beware, you may run
into problems with this feature in the end-breaking up with someone is
not as easy as clicking "cancel relationship."
7. We all feel a little empty without the enthusiasm for our outstand
ing basketball teams, but there are plenty of springtime sports to fill
those big shoes: crew, softball. golf, lacrosse, and sailing, to name a few.
But seriously, that lemonade that they sell at baseball games rocks, so
we know that's what people are going to go watch.
8. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.
9. Is it just us, or has Stanford started giving out complimentary sub
scriptions for YM Magazine? Either that, or the asshole that donated
money in our names to the Senior Gift has also signed us up fora year
of this fine piece of journalism. Too bad we stopped reading it when
we were 12. Don't get us wrong: we're young, and we're modern, but
we're ready for more sophisticated reading material, like The Stan
ford Review.
10. Only you can prevent wildfires.
11. All that screwing around that we did freshman year didn't seem
like a big deal. But now that we are taking full schedules this quarter
while other seniors are class-free, we're thinking twice. So. a message to
all you freshmen: Twenty units now might seem like a burden, but
it's a small price to pay to have an entire quarter of sleeping 'til 2 p.m.
and denying that you're an alcoholic despite the fact that you drink
every night.
12. J'adore Fireside Chats.
13. Study up on the lyrics to the Star Spangled Banner. You never
know who might ask you to sing it, and you don't want to be that asshole
that screws it up.
14. Keep track of how many parking tickets you have gotten. You
may to be surprised to know that it only takes five unpaid tickets before
they put a boot on your car, and it's not as fun as the boot in Super Mario
Brothers 3. In fact, the boot has been a source of intense pain and hu
miliation fora co-columnist who shall remain nameless. Don't let this
happen to you.
We're not running for ASSU president. But considering our concern
for important student issues, perhaps we should be. Feel free to write us
in on the ballot.

cone@stanford.edu and cbrigham@stanford.edu.

it's a small price to pay to have an entire quarter of sleeping 'til 2 p.m.
and denying that you're an alcoholic despite the fact that you drink
every night.
12. J'adore Fireside Chats.
13. Study up on the lyrics to the Star Spangled Banner. You never
know who might ask you to sing it, and you don't want to be that asshole
that screws it up.
14. Keep track of how many parking tickets you have gotten. You
may to be surprised to know that it only takes five unpaid tickets before
they put a boot on your car, and it's not as fun as the boot in Super Mario
Brothers 3. In fact, the boot has been a source of intense pain and hu
miliation fora co-columnist who shall remain nameless. Don't let this
happen to you.
We're not running for ASSU president. But considering our concern
for important student issues, perhaps we should be. Feel free to write us
in on the ballot.

For most of us, spring quarter is a time to let loose, feel the sun on
our faces, forget where we went and what we did every weekend
and wonder where the hell we are when we wake up in a drunk
en haze. But for those few individuals running for ASSU presi
dent, it's a time to straighten up and look respectable and hard-working,
perhaps try to demonstrate to the student body that they really do care
about what's happening on campus despite their usual bullshit.
We don't care about what's happening, and we're not going to hide it.
Here are the pressing issues that are on our minds. We'll try to keep it

under 2,000 words.
1. Welcome back to our esteemed Se
nior Class president! It's great to have you
back. We're excited to see the year really
finish with a bang now that the Fab Four is
back together.
2. Why does spring quarter always start
with rain when during winter quarter fi
nals it's beautiful? Perhaps the ASSU
presidential candidates could address this
issue in their campaigns.
3. Most of us have figured out by now
that we don't have to buy all of the text
books "required" for our classes. But the

Stanford Bookstore — those business tycoons — have produced a
flawless advertising campaign: dressing Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie
in Stanford gear and surrounding them with cut-out farm animals and
cheap boxes that are supposed to be hay barrels, with a sign spelling out
"Stanford: The Simple Life." Maybe our textbook prices are so jacked
up because the Bookstore has to pay for the labor to create brilliant dis
plays like that, but in the end it's worth it because it totally makes us
want to buy ALL our books, even the optional ones.
4. Beer before liquor, get sick quicker.
5. Red light, red light, GREEN LIGHT! (Branner freshmen —
don't get any ideas.)
6. We knew that thefacebook.com was an incredible invention, but
now there's an exciting new feature that will change all of our lives: you
can now specify your significant other. This highlights that ancient ques
tion of relationship status — are you ready to align yourself with that
person for all of the Stanford community to see? And even though gay
marriage might be questioned in this country, thefacebook.com does
not discriminate against same-sex pairings. But beware, you may run
into problems with this feature in the end-breaking up with someone is
not as easy as clicking "cancel relationship."
7. We all feel a little empty without the enthusiasm for our outstand
ing basketball teams, but there are plenty of springtime sports to fill
those big shoes: crew, softball. golf, lacrosse, and sailing, to name a few.
But seriously, that lemonade that they sell at baseball games rocks, so
we know that's what people are going to go watch.
8. Liquor before beer, you're in the clear.
9. Is it just us, or has Stanford started giving out complimentary sub
scriptions for YM Magazine? Either that, or the asshole that donated
money in our names to the Senior Gift has also signed us up fora year
of this fine piece of journalism. Too bad we stopped reading it when
we were 12. Don't get us wrong: we're young, and we're modern, but
we're ready for more sophisticated reading material, like The Stan
ford Review.
10. Only you can prevent wildfires.
11. All that screwing around that we did freshman year didn't seem
like a big deal. But now that we are taking full schedules this quarter
while other seniors are class-free, we're thinking twice. So. a message to
all you freshmen: Twenty units now might seem like a burden, but
it's a small price to pay to have an entire quarter of sleeping 'til 2 p.m.
and denying that you're an alcoholic despite the fact that you drink
every night.
12. J'adore Fireside Chats.
