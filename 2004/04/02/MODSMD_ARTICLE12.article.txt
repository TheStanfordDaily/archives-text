## Check out Community Day 
### 
This Sunday, thousands of community
members will converge upon campus to
celebrate the third annual Community
Day. We applaud the University for
continuing this new tradition that is an extension
of Founders Celebration —an event in place
since 1891.
Community Day is an opportunity for the cam
pus' neighbors to get a taste of what life on the
Farm is like. The event is an all-day campus open
house featuring a children's carnival, a health fair
and valet bicycle parking. All activities will be
free and open to the public. Campus groups and
organizations can showcase themselves by host
ing booths or running activities. Stanford athlet
ics. for example, will host interactive games for
children and workshops on sports rules and skills;
the Gamma Zeta Alpha fraternity will teach visi
tors how to make an Aztec sundial; and the Stan
ford African Students Association will provide
giant puzzles of Africa for children to piece to
gether while learning about African culture and
geography. Community Day will also offer plenty
of opportunities for adults to sample University
life through faculty lectures and docent-led tours
of the Cantor Arts Center.
Community Day does what it sets out to do in
fostering community, educating and being inclu
sive. These were the goals of the University, as
envisioned by the Stanfords. Vice President of
Public Affairs Gordon Earle said in an op-ed last
year ("Community day celebrates cooperation,
partnership," April 4, 2003) that "Shortly before
his death. Leland Stanford wrote in a letter to

David Starr Jordan, the University's first presi
dent, that 'one of the most important things to be
taught in the institution is co-operation.' It is this
spirit that drives Community Day, as well as the
University's desire to be inclusive, encourage
partnership, stress education and learning and
promote engagement with others."
It makes sense, therefore, that Community
Day is held in tandem with Founders Celebra
tion. It embodies the ideals of the Stanfords and
celebrates their vision. We think the Stanfords
would have been proud of the University's annu
al efforts to include the wider community, but the
administration could do even more towards
achieving this goal. Community outreach should
be a continual endeavor, but this event only takes
place once a year. Further, overall campus in
volvement in Community Day is weak. Few stu
dents participate in Community Day; after all, it
is by its very nature primarily for non-Stanford
students. Yet if we are truly to foster community,
more students should take an active role in Com
munity Day. Over 6,000 people have attended
each of the past two Community Days, making it
one of the largest annual events on campus —
students should help both to continue and to
build this tradition by volunteering their groups
to man booths and organize activities.
The forecast for Sunday predicts sun and tem
peratures in the upper 70s. Being the first week
end of the quarter, students have little homework
to do — we encourage them to wander down to
the Main Quad on Sunday to check out Commu
nity Day.
