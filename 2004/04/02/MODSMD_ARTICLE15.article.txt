# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Getting the most out of the Farm 
### 
At the turn of the millenni
um, I entered my fresh
man year of college wide
eyed and awestruck. The
campus was overwhelming in its
beauty, and the concept of college
was intimidating even fora high
school hero like me. I was clueless
hut optimistic.
Neither of my parents went to
college. My father was orphaned
around the age of eighteen and hit
the work force immediately out of
high school. My mother attended ju
nior college fora year and studied
what women were supposed to
study: secretarial science. She left
school to help raise her brothers and
sisters. Their lack of college experi
ence facilitated my lack of purpose
upon arrival.
I thought of university as a place
you go after high school to learn
stuff. So, I utilized my well-honed
problem solving skills and broke col
lege down into manageable goals:
1) Go there.
2) Learn stuff.
I hopped on a flight from Logan
Airport to SFO. I sat with a guy who
was so obese he took up both the
aisle and the window seats. I sat in
the middle. When we landed, they
surgically removed me from the
plane and 1 hastily hopped on a Su
pershuttle and zoomed off to cam
pus. After I passed a couple of
squawking crazies in front of Flo
rence Moore Hall who turned out to
be the house staff (Doty, Jacobs,
Tsui — I love you guys), 1 checked
off the first mission on my college
task list: I had gotten there.
I then shifted all my attention to
"learning stuff." After about fifteen
hours of finger twiddling and
knuckle cracking, I realized that
this subgoal was a bit unspecific. I
had already acquired some knowl
edge that I didn't feel comfortable
applying to my college goal. It is
true that imbibing a mixture of
bourbon, scotch and baking soda
leads to disrobing and hurling
brown bananas at tube-topped
party girls, but how crucial was col
lege to all this? I resolved to reeval
uate my role as an undergraduate.
Thanks to many of my ambitious
peers, I have learned that under
graduate education is not about life
experience. To gain that, work the
railroad. It's not an academic pur
suit. Get a library card. It's not about
making friends. Check out bars, bus
stops, bordellos. College is for gain
ing an advantage over less intelligent
people in the job market. Think of it
as a vocational school on steroids.
To all you freshman who are as
naive and idealistic as I used to be,
here is some insight into how to
maximize the utility of your time on
the Farm.
First, learn to view the world in
terms of your resume. That girl in
line next to you just dropped her car
ton of milk. What do you do?

Well, she's a klutz and so qualifies
as handicapped. You ought to bend
down and retrieve it for her while the

opportunity is
still there. This is
an unrewarded
act of benevo
lence and so qual
ifies as "volun
teering." Thus,
you "donated a
large portion of
your time volun
teering to help
the handicapped."
Remember, words

like "large" are subjective and can
be strewn about frivolously.
Did you initiate a weekly poker
game in your dorm? That constitutes
a"club" or even a "successful en
trepreneurialship" if you made a few
bucks in the process.
Another approach to ensuring a
good resume requires some research
on your part. Go out and identify all
the campus clubs that require mini
mal effort for membership. Join
every single one and then sit back
and let your name sit on the rosters.
If anybody questions your commit
ment, tell them your grandmother
died. (Note: you have an upper limit
of three dead grandmothers.)
Here's another ingenious approach.
Simply say you held some prestigious
position like editor of the"The Stan
ford Review" or the "Serial Groper."
When potential employers can't find
your name anywhere connected with
said position, roll your eyes, sigh, and
say as arrogantly as possible, "I operat
ed under a pseudonym."
If you want to engineer anything,
engineer your GPA. Take a bunch of
easy classes and get straight A's. All
the college how-to books make it
very clear that A's in easy classes
look better than B's in classes where
you like or learn the material. If at
any point your calculations tell you
that you can't graduate with any
thing higher than a 3.9, take the ele
vator to the top of Hoover Tower.
Step out onto the ledge. Take a deep
breath. Jump out as far as you possi
bly can and freefall. You'll either hit
the ground hard and avoid a miser
able life of mediocre accolades or
you'll be able to fly, which would
make up for it. I like to call this plan
the "Win-Win Situation".
Junior year is the time to attend
job fairs and networking events. You
will inevitably see lines of students
waiting to talk to representatives of
big-money companies. Don't let a
queue deter you from approaching
potential employers and selling
yourself like a waffle iron on QVC.
But, obviously, don't wait in the
lines. That's just absurd.
Here's an effective approach to
circumventing lines. Make an effort
to flank the front person on a side
that he or she is not guarding. When
this overly-patient imbecile turns
and gives you that look of "What the

hell do you think you're doing?",
glare back with an angry demeanor
and mouth the words, '"I will stab you
in the face." This will usually work. If
not. whip out a tazer and electrify his
/ her ass. Whatever employer you're
looking to work for will appreciate
your competitive spirit while that
other dude is convulsing on the
ground like hickory-smoked bacon.
When it conies to accepting job
offers, don't be picky about the
ethics of the companies. Ethics
should be the last thing on your
mind. If it comes down to choosing
between two employers, accept the
offer from whichever company has
the worst ethical record. It's a good
heuristic for identifying companies
with the highest profit potentials.
You can also prepare for your fu
ture by beginning to vote Republi
can in all elections. Democrats
rarely fight for the needs of the
wealthy, and this just won't suit you
as your portfolio grows almost as
healthily as the Botox culture in your
mistress' face. Do your part in help
ing to tip the political scales in favor
of the wealthy. It will pay off down
the line. Some of you might be un
comfortable with this. You're still
young and a tad foolish (no offense),
so you might have lingering liberal
beliefs, at least socially. Here's a lit
tle trick to avoid any cognitive disso
nance and shuck your social aware
ness like a monkey on your back.
Every morning after you wake up,
recite the following four sentences
aloud 14 times:
1) I will be dead before the envi
ronment matters.
2) Poor people are lazy (and prob
ably stupid, which is also their fault).
3) The only thing better than lots
of money is lots more money.
4) If I don't screw people over,
then somebody else will, and. know
ing my luck, he'll end up being my
next-door neighbor who boasts a
fancier nuclear-powered H2 in his
driveway, sneering at me like the
dirty rotten son of a bigger dirty rot
ten son of a dad.
This should adequately prepare
you '07's to get some usefulness out
of an otherwise useless education.
When graduation rolls around and
you've got your six-figure salary job
in the bag, interrogate your peers
about their future plans, and then
give your head a quarter tilt, raise
your eyebrows and nod condescend
ingly at their replies. Your glory will
consume you.

At the turn of the millenni

campus was overwhelming in its
beauty, and the concept of college
was intimidating even fora high
school hero like me. I was clueless

Neither of my parents went to

around the age of eighteen and hit

school to help raise her brothers and

ence facilitated my lack of purpose

I thought of university as a place
you go after high school to learn
stuff. So, I utilized my well-honed
problem solving skills and broke col
lege down into manageable goals:
1) Go there.
2) Learn stuff.
I hopped on a flight from Logan
Airport to SFO. I sat with a guy who
was so obese he took up both the
aisle and the window seats. I sat in
the middle. When we landed, they
surgically removed me from the
plane and 1 hastily hopped on a Su
pershuttle and zoomed off to cam
pus. After I passed a couple of
squawking crazies in front of Flo
rence Moore Hall who turned out to
be the house staff (Doty, Jacobs,
Tsui — I love you guys), 1 checked
off the first mission on my college
task list: I had gotten there.
I then shifted all my attention to
"learning stuff." After about fifteen
hours of finger twiddling and
knuckle cracking, I realized that
this subgoal was a bit unspecific. I
had already acquired some knowl
edge that I didn't feel comfortable
applying to my college goal. It is
true that imbibing a mixture of
bourbon, scotch and baking soda
leads to disrobing and hurling
brown bananas at tube-topped
party girls, but how crucial was col
lege to all this? I resolved to reeval
uate my role as an undergraduate.
Thanks to many of my ambitious
peers, I have learned that under
graduate education is not about life
experience. To gain that, work the
railroad. It's not an academic pur
suit. Get a library card. It's not about
making friends. Check out bars, bus
stops, bordellos. College is for gain
ing an advantage over less intelligent
people in the job market. Think of it
as a vocational school on steroids.
To all you freshman who are as
naive and idealistic as I used to be,
here is some insight into how to
maximize the utility of your time on
the Farm.
First, learn to view the world in
terms of your resume. That girl in
line next to you just dropped her car
ton of milk. What do you do?

Well, she's a klutz and so qualifies
as handicapped. You ought to bend
down and retrieve it for her while the

opportunity is
still there. This is
an unrewarded
act of benevo
lence and so qual
ifies as "volun
teering." Thus,
you "donated a
large portion of
your time volun
teering to help
the handicapped."
Remember, words

like "large" are subjective and can
be strewn about frivolously.
Did you initiate a weekly poker
game in your dorm? That constitutes
a"club" or even a "successful en
trepreneurialship" if you made a few
bucks in the process.
Another approach to ensuring a
good resume requires some research
on your part. Go out and identify all
the campus clubs that require mini
mal effort for membership. Join
every single one and then sit back
and let your name sit on the rosters.
If anybody questions your commit
ment, tell them your grandmother
died. (Note: you have an upper limit
of three dead grandmothers.)
Here's another ingenious approach.
Simply say you held some prestigious
position like editor of the"The Stan
ford Review" or the "Serial Groper."
When potential employers can't find
your name anywhere connected with
said position, roll your eyes, sigh, and
say as arrogantly as possible, "I operat
ed under a pseudonym."
If you want to engineer anything,
engineer your GPA. Take a bunch of
easy classes and get straight A's. All
the college how-to books make it
very clear that A's in easy classes
look better than B's in classes where
you like or learn the material. If at
any point your calculations tell you
that you can't graduate with any
thing higher than a 3.9, take the ele
vator to the top of Hoover Tower.
Step out onto the ledge. Take a deep
breath. Jump out as far as you possi
bly can and freefall. You'll either hit
the ground hard and avoid a miser
able life of mediocre accolades or
you'll be able to fly, which would
make up for it. I like to call this plan
the "Win-Win Situation".
Junior year is the time to attend
job fairs and networking events. You
will inevitably see lines of students
waiting to talk to representatives of
big-money companies. Don't let a
queue deter you from approaching
potential employers and selling
yourself like a waffle iron on QVC.
But, obviously, don't wait in the
lines. That's just absurd.
Here's an effective approach to
circumventing lines. Make an effort
to flank the front person on a side
that he or she is not guarding. When
this overly-patient imbecile turns
and gives you that look of "What the

hell do you think you're doing?",
glare back with an angry demeanor
and mouth the words, '"I will stab you
in the face." This will usually work. If
not. whip out a tazer and electrify his
/ her ass. Whatever employer you're
looking to work for will appreciate
your competitive spirit while that
other dude is convulsing on the
ground like hickory-smoked bacon.
When it conies to accepting job
offers, don't be picky about the
ethics of the companies. Ethics
should be the last thing on your
mind. If it comes down to choosing
between two employers, accept the
offer from whichever company has
the worst ethical record. It's a good
heuristic for identifying companies
with the highest profit potentials.
You can also prepare for your fu
ture by beginning to vote Republi
can in all elections. Democrats
rarely fight for the needs of the
wealthy, and this just won't suit you
as your portfolio grows almost as
healthily as the Botox culture in your
mistress' face. Do your part in help
ing to tip the political scales in favor
of the wealthy. It will pay off down
the line. Some of you might be un
comfortable with this. You're still
young and a tad foolish (no offense),
so you might have lingering liberal

ford Review" or the "Serial Groper."
When potential employers can't find
your name anywhere connected with
said position, roll your eyes, sigh, and
say as arrogantly as possible, "I operat
ed under a pseudonym."
If you want to engineer anything,
engineer your GPA. Take a bunch of
easy classes and get straight A's. All
the college how-to books make it
very clear that A's in easy classes
look better than B's in classes where
you like or learn the material. If at
any point your calculations tell you
that you can't graduate with any
thing higher than a 3.9, take the ele
vator to the top of Hoover Tower.
Step out onto the ledge. Take a deep
breath. Jump out as far as you possi
bly can and freefall. You'll either hit
the ground hard and avoid a miser
able life of mediocre accolades or
you'll be able to fly, which would
make up for it. I like to call this plan
the "Win-Win Situation".
Junior year is the time to attend
job fairs and networking events. You
will inevitably see lines of students
waiting to talk to representatives of
big-money companies. Don't let a
queue deter you from approaching
potential employers and selling
yourself like a waffle iron on QVC.
But, obviously, don't wait in the
lines. That's just absurd.
Here's an effective approach to
circumventing lines. Make an effort
to flank the front person on a side
that he or she is not guarding. When
this overly-patient imbecile turns
and gives you that look of "What the

hell do you think you're doing?",
glare back with an angry demeanor
and mouth the words, '"I will stab you
in the face." This will usually work. If
not. whip out a tazer and electrify his
/ her ass. Whatever employer you're
looking to work for will appreciate
your competitive spirit while that
other dude is convulsing on the
ground like hickory-smoked bacon.
When it conies to accepting job
offers, don't be picky about the
ethics of the companies. Ethics
should be the last thing on your
mind. If it comes down to choosing
between two employers, accept the
offer from whichever company has
the worst ethical record. It's a good
heuristic for identifying companies
with the highest profit potentials.
You can also prepare for your fu
ture by beginning to vote Republi
can in all elections. Democrats
rarely fight for the needs of the
wealthy, and this just won't suit you
as your portfolio grows almost as
healthily as the Botox culture in your
mistress' face. Do your part in help
ing to tip the political scales in favor
of the wealthy. It will pay off down
the line. Some of you might be un
comfortable with this. You're still
young and a tad foolish (no offense),
so you might have lingering liberal
beliefs, at least socially. Here's a lit
tle trick to avoid any cognitive disso
nance and shuck your social aware
ness like a monkey on your back.
Every morning after you wake up,
recite the following four sentences
aloud 14 times:
1) I will be dead before the envi
ronment matters.
2) Poor people are lazy (and prob
ably stupid, which is also their fault).
3) The only thing better than lots
of money is lots more money.
4) If I don't screw people over,
then somebody else will, and. know
ing my luck, he'll end up being my
next-door neighbor who boasts a
fancier nuclear-powered H2 in his
driveway, sneering at me like the
dirty rotten son of a bigger dirty rot
ten son of a dad.
This should adequately prepare
you '07's to get some usefulness out
of an otherwise useless education.
When graduation rolls around and
you've got your six-figure salary job
in the bag, interrogate your peers
about their future plans, and then
give your head a quarter tilt, raise
your eyebrows and nod condescend
ingly at their replies. Your glory will
consume you.

AJ Magnuson probably didn't
write the title to this column and
definitely didn't write his last one,
'Econ majors beware: your kind are
stingy, self-centered pigs.' He never
called econ majors pigs, stingy or
self-centered and was disappointed
that The Daily decided to insult a
substantial percentage of the school
in his name. E-mail comments to aj
