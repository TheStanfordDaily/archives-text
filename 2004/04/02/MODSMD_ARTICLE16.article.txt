## Lessons from the terror in Spain 
### 
The shock of the March 11
terrorist attack in Spain
seems impossibly foreign in
these first days of spring
quarter in the Stanford bubble.
Imagine someone leaving a bomb in
a backpack in the Lane Reading
Room. Couldn't happen. But as we
think about everyday people com
muting on a Madrid train or — clos
er to home — going to work in the
Twin Towers of New York City, the
reality of our vulnerability begins to
set in. You can start to feel how the
shock of such an event creeps toward
fear and how that fear quickly be
comes anger.
That anger changed an election.
In the days leading up to the attacks,
the People's Party of Spain, lead by
Prime Minister Jose Aznar, held a
narrow lead in the polls. Three days
after the attacks, the Spanish people
elected socialist Jose Luis Ro
driguez Zapatero. The formula ap
peared scarily simple: Terrorism
swings elections.
However, Prime Minister Aznar's
biggest mistake wasn't allowing the
bombings, but instead blaming the
wrong terrorists. Aznar immediately
accused the Basque separatist group
ETA and appeared to use the event
to his political advantage. That im
pression enraged the Spanish public,
which stood in the rain by the thou
sands outside his residence in
protest. More than the attacks them
selves. it was this mishandling of the
crisis that cost the People's Party the

elections. Unfortunately, that subtle
difference seems lost on any would-

be terrorists.
In times of cri
sis, an event is
often defined
more by our reac
tion to it than by
what actually
happened. The
same rule holds
true for both the
outgoing Aznar
and the incoming
Zapatero, who

wasted no time in declaring the po
tential withdrawal of Spanish troops
from Iraq and the development of a
more "pro-European" foreign poli
cy. This message threatens to sup
port the claim that terrorism against
U.S. allies will throw their alliance
into question. This is a truly danger
ous precedent, and Zapatero must
realize the stakes.
He would do well to learn from
the mistakes of President George W.
Bush and the United States. The ter
ror of Sept. 11, 2001, yielded con
crete changes in U.S. foreign policy,
most notably the doctrine of preven
tive war that eventually justified a
war in Iraq. While the White House
tried to make it clear that its un
orthodox actions did not constitute a
war against Islam, the increasingly
vicious and widespread attacks in
Iraq and Afghanistan could convert
that promise into an empty slogan.
For both Spain and the United

States, it is the response that cements
the legacy of the attack. In a war of
ideas such as the war on terrorism,
these legacies are the battlegrounds.
Any Spanish reaction to the
Madrid attacks must not seek to vil
ify the United States. While policies
may change, the incoming Prime
Minister Zapatero must actively
convey that he has not joined the
"War on America"in any way.
Whether or not the United States
has been wrong, the biggest danger
is sending the message that terror
ism pays, and pays well. If the new
government requires a United Na
tions mandate to keep troops in
Iraq, it should focus on the UN, not
on the removing of troops from
what some see as "America's War."
A new Spanish government might
make the difference in the Euro
pean Union's constitution negotia
tions. Similarly, this positive devel
opment should not be framed as a
challenge to America.
For Zapatero and the grieving na
tion of Spain, timing is everything.
The memory of Madrid cannot be hi
jacked by terrorists. Instead, it must
be harnessed by the progressive
voices in Spain that understand that
in some ways, the bombing in
Madrid hasn't even happened yet.
The world awaits its reaction.

Madrid hasn't even happened yet.
The world awaits its reaction.
