## Former college binge-drinker offers his pearls of wisdom to students 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Perhaps you are reading this as
you shake the cobwebs off a morn
ing hangover. Or perhaps a friend
has thrust this column into your
hands and urged you to read it.
Maybe you are laughing it off with
a group of your buds but not find
ing it all that funny. Or maybe you
are still trying to put together the
pieces of last night that you can't
remember. Whatever. Hopefully,
regardless of the source, the light
ning will strike those of you for
whom it's intended.
Steve Saucedo did not wake up
last Friday morning. One of his
friends found Saucedo's lifeless
body around 9 a.m. The coroner has

not yet completed his toxicology
tests, but police say it appears the
U.C.-Berkeley student drank him
self to death.
Saucedo was 21. According to
one newspaper account, he and a
group of friends decided to have a
drinking contest last Thursday
night. Saucedo was the bartender
and, according to his roommate,
was doling out shots of tequila,
vodka and whiskey. His roommate
also said that Steve was a competi
tive guy and liked to win at every
thing he did. This time the game
turned deadly.
Thirty-five years ago a fellow a
lot like Saucedo began drinking. He
was a competitive guy too and loved
playing beer pong at one or another
of the Ivy League college fraternity

houses that he attended. You know
the game. Set up cups of beer at the
ends of a ping-pong table and try to
hit your opponent's cup. If you suc
ceed, your opponent has to take a
drink, and if you succeed big-time
and knock the cup over, he / she has
to chug another full cup.
That fellow was me. My friends
and I would play nightly for many
hours and would all get shit-faced.
Sometimes we would go out for
food late and I would usually drive.
That's when I started to get picked
up for drunk driving.
During my senior year of college,
while I was home visiting my par
ents, I crashed my car when I was
drunk and ended up in the hospital
fora week with a broken rib and fa
cial lacerations. No, now that I re

member it, the hospital stay was
earlier. The crash my senior year
was just a garden-variety drunk
driving incident where 1 ended up
totaling my car and spending the
night in jail.
After college, I held a variety of
jobs for the next eight years and
moved in with my girlfriend. She
left after about three years. Some
thing to do with my drinking, I sup
pose. After another drunk-driving
arrest in 1979, the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts ordered that I
enter an alcohol program. At the
same time, I began attending some
meetings of an anonymous group
for people who drink too much. It
has now been nearly 25 years since
my last drink.
David Leydecker was a friend of

mine. Leybecker and I attended
U.C.-Hastings' College of the Law
together in the early 1980s — after
I had stopped drinking. 1 visited
Leybecker one time in the hospital
after he had drunkenly fallen sever
al stories out of a high-rise building
in San Francisco's Tenderloin Dis
trict. Leybecker was recovering
nicely and wondered where he
could get his next drink. He was
found dead in his car in Marin
County shortly after we graduated
from law school. Leybecker died
from acute alcohol poisoning.
When I was teaching an alcohol
education class in the late 1980s and
early 1990s in the San Mateo Coun
ty public schools, I could recite for
you various statistics about the
number of drinkers who went on to

become alcoholics. I could have
told you how alcoholism was a pro
gressive disease and alerted you to
many of the symptoms, including
things like alcoholic blackouts, ra
tionalizing behaviors, denial and in
creasing remorse. It's strange how
much of that information I've for
gotten. What I haven't forgotten is
that if I ever pick up a drink again,
chances are that I will end up like
Saucedo or Leybecker.

pieces of last night that you can't
remember. Whatever. Hopefully,
regardless of the source, the light
ning will strike those of you for
whom it's intended.
Steve Saucedo did not wake up
last Friday morning. One of his
friends found Saucedo's lifeless
body around 9 a.m. The coroner has

not yet completed his toxicology
tests, but police say it appears the
U.C.-Berkeley student drank him
self to death.
Saucedo was 21. According to
one newspaper account, he and a
group of friends decided to have a
drinking contest last Thursday
night. Saucedo was the bartender
and, according to his roommate,
was doling out shots of tequila,
vodka and whiskey. His roommate
also said that Steve was a competi
tive guy and liked to win at every
thing he did. This time the game
turned deadly.
Thirty-five years ago a fellow a
lot like Saucedo began drinking. He
was a competitive guy too and loved
playing beer pong at one or another
of the Ivy League college fraternity

houses that he attended. You know
the game. Set up cups of beer at the
ends of a ping-pong table and try to
hit your opponent's cup. If you suc
ceed, your opponent has to take a
drink, and if you succeed big-time
and knock the cup over, he / she has
to chug another full cup.
That fellow was me. My friends
and I would play nightly for many
hours and would all get shit-faced.
Sometimes we would go out for
food late and I would usually drive.
That's when I started to get picked
up for drunk driving.
During my senior year of college,
while I was home visiting my par
ents, I crashed my car when I was
drunk and ended up in the hospital
fora week with a broken rib and fa
cial lacerations. No, now that I re

member it, the hospital stay was
earlier. The crash my senior year
was just a garden-variety drunk
driving incident where 1 ended up
totaling my car and spending the
night in jail.
After college, I held a variety of
jobs for the next eight years and
moved in with my girlfriend. She
left after about three years. Some
thing to do with my drinking, I sup
pose. After another drunk-driving
arrest in 1979, the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts ordered that I
enter an alcohol program. At the
same time, I began attending some
meetings of an anonymous group
for people who drink too much. It
has now been nearly 25 years since
my last drink.
David Leydecker was a friend of

mine. Leybecker and I attended
U.C.-Hastings' College of the Law
together in the early 1980s — after
I had stopped drinking. 1 visited
Leybecker one time in the hospital
after he had drunkenly fallen sever
al stories out of a high-rise building
in San Francisco's Tenderloin Dis
trict. Leybecker was recovering
nicely and wondered where he
could get his next drink. He was
found dead in his car in Marin
County shortly after we graduated
from law school. Leybecker died
from acute alcohol poisoning.
When I was teaching an alcohol
education class in the late 1980s and
early 1990s in the San Mateo Coun
ty public schools, I could recite for
you various statistics about the
number of drinkers who went on to

become alcoholics. I could have
told you how alcoholism was a pro
gressive disease and alerted you to
many of the symptoms, including
things like alcoholic blackouts, ra
tionalizing behaviors, denial and in
creasing remorse. It's strange how
much of that information I've for
gotten. What I haven't forgotten is
that if I ever pick up a drink again,
chances are that I will end up like
Saucedo or Leybecker.
