## Sports and sex are one of a kind 
### 
The Chappie wants it. The fresh-cut
grass and blooming (lowers want it.
My copy editor wants it. Okay, me too,
me t(X). It's springtime, and sex is in the
air. The birds and hees are in full effect and even
the insects are hooking up.
This is the part where 1 hope my parents tor
get to read The Daily online this week. And my
30-something cousins and friends to whom
mom forwards my column.
Spring rolls around, and suddenly everyone
remembers they have real human bodies, and
that human bodies like sex. We wake up from
the cruel pseudo-winter of Palo Alto, pull our
warped eyeballs away from the dim library
lighting and online Coursework articles and
suddenly it's spring. Sigma Chis start snicker
ing that the sun comes out and the clothes
come off, as Stanford girls show they really do
own fashionable —or at least skimpy —

clothes. Then again,
Sigma Chi's also blast
Eminem when they're
sunbathing. Hahaha.
Please don't even ask
me to expound the
sports-sex connection.
It's too obvious.
Okay, you asked for it
— athletes like sex too.
Column No. 1 on
September 26,2(X)3: High
er-end athletes get more
offers for sex.

Anna Kournikova. Sports Illustrated Swim
suit Edition. The real reason women's gymnas
tics is popular.
There is no dearth of sex-infused sports lingo.
Let's regress to our childhood measures for get
ling lucky, rounding the bases, scoring home
runs. And of course arguing over whether cop
ping a feel is still second base if her shirt is on.
Team player, pinch hitter, marathon runner,
speaks softly but carries a big stick.
Athletes have sex, students have sex, even
professors have sex.
Is sex a sport? No. Not in our generation. By
the time we're old biddies and think the world is
going to hell in a heathen, new-wave techno
basket, perhaps. There's already a sex industry,
there's already a porn industry, why not sex
competitions?
What would you judge that on, anyway?
Quality? Quantity? Interpersonal connection?
Team coordination?
We long for the days of rhythmic gymnas
tics, Starbucks world domination and The
Gold Club. A time where people at least had
some sense of morality, whether they followed
it or not. A time when the President was pun
ished (kind of) for lying about fooling around
with his intern.
It could happen. Sex Olympics. The porn in
dustry already has its stars and legends. John
Holmes, a.k.a. Johnny Wadd, had reportedly
the longest schlong in porno history — 13 inch
es "inflated" — and a story tragic enough to
rival Elvis's. Tens of thousands of girls, tot)
much coke and eventually death by AIDS.
In the meantime, we have an intermediate
version of competitive sex sports. It's called sex
ercise, and it's completely bogus. Who really
knows how many calories you burn when
you're having sex? The Internet with its simplis
tic "30 minutes intercourse = 120 calories" lies,
because we all know that any accurate calorie
burning figure accounts for sex, weight, level of
active lifestyle and whether you're doing it to
Kenny Rogers in the prime of candlelit saxo
phone cheesiness or rocking out to a speed-in
duced metal death core marathon in a sauna.
One urban legend quotes some Italian dieti
cian as saying that taking off a bra with one's
teeth consumes 87 calories. Are you fucking
kidding me? Sewing a bra together in a sweat
shop doesn't even take that many.
But sex does burn calories; it's just a matter
of how many. You've got to factor in lost sleep
from pre-bed and morning romps, the sweat
factor if you have no AC and it's hot out,
whether you consumed too many beer calories
for the "exercise" to even count, and so forth.
Sexercise has gone to the professionals.
Eric Rimni, an associate professor at the Har
vard School of Public Health, went so far as to
relate penile arteries to other arteries (noth
ing too profound, right?): "What happens to
the penis may be an early warning of what
could happen to the heart, such as a heart at
tack". Ouch. And this is why Big Macs are not
good for you or your sex life.
In Sex Olympics, would Viagra be consid
ered an illegal enhancement drug? Could
competitors receive payment, or does that
qualify as prostitution?
In 2001, the controversy was hot. The owner
of The Gold Club, Atlanta's premiere strip spot
for the likes of all sorts of celebrity athletes, plus
Madonna (big surprise), allegedly had his girls
give special athletes sexual favors on the house.
Patrick Ewing wasn't prosecuted, because, as
he testified, he didn't even tip the girls. The
owner footed the bill. Low, Patrick, low.
Prostitutes across Nevada are unionizing,
and next thing you know, people will be won
dering if Sex Olympics "athletes" should have
salary caps, or whether it's okay to slap exorbi
tant fines on college students for illegally down
loading the 2052 Olympic Trials.
In the meantime, go get yours, remember
that "no" means "no," and practice, train and
compete like the Team Player, Sprinter, or Big
Hitter you are.
