# No. 1 Card opens Pac-10 play
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Good pitching heats good
hitting, as the story goes, hut
this weekend in Los Angeles,
it's going to he even more
crucial for the Stanford
hurlers to maintain control
— UCLA's Jackie Robinson
Stadium, much like its name
sake, has the potential to he a
pitcher's nightmare.
"Anything can happen in
that ballpark ... The ball just
carries," said Stanford junior
leftfielder Danny Putnam.
"Good pitching is going to be
important in keeping hitters
at bay."
If the season so far is any in
dication, the top-ranked Car
dinal (21-3) should be primed
for the challenge of facing the
Bruins (14-11) in its Pacific-10
Conference opener. Stanford
head coach Mark Marquess
made sure that his team
played the best competitors
that the NCAA has to offer
during its nonconference
schedule, including Texas and
Cal State-Fullerton.
The Cardinal's starting ro
tation has benefited from the
tough competition up to this
point. According to Sunday's
starter, sophomore Jeff
Gilmore, the team's top three
pitchers should keep UCLA
hitters guessing.
"[Our pitching] has a differ
ent look each day," Gilmore
said. "[Sophomore Mark Ro
manczukj is a lefty who hides
the ball well and throws hard,
while [freshman Blake Holler)

is a little more crafty, with an
excellent curve and an excel
lent changeup.
"Then, on Sunday, it's com
pletely different because I'm
righthanded," Gilmore contin
ued. "I'm not a power pitcher,
[but[ I have four pitches I mix
up a lot."
The expectations placed on
the entire Cardinal pitching
staff will change slightly begin
ning with the start of confer
ence play, as Marquess said
that his hurlers will be allowed
to throw more innings per
game if they are able. Relievers
could also be used more than
once in a weekend if the situa
tion requires.
"(Our pitching] was a ques
tion mark before the season
started," Marquess said. "But
(our pitchers] have progressed.
Our guys are pitching well and
that provides competition ...
now that there's a little bit
more urgency."
Though the Stanford
hurlers are proven threats on
the mound — the starting trio
has a combined 13-3 record —
the Bruins have a couple of
solid arms to match them.
UCLA has been an up-and
down team this season, but Fri
day's starter, righthander
Casey Janssen, has been shut
ting down opposing batters
since January, striking out 52
batters in 46 innings on the way
to a 5-1 record.
The Bruins' Saturday
starter, righthander Bryan
Beck, has just a 2-2 record, but
maintains the lowest ERA on
the staff at 2.12. Lefty Wes

Whisler — who starts at first
base when he's not on the
mound and is currently batting
.268 — is slated to pitch Sun
day afternoon.
Putnam said that the biggest
problem that the Cardinal of
fense will have to overcome in
order to take advantage of such
a hitter's ballpark will be over
thinking at the plate. Stanford
has gotten itself into a couple of
short hitting slumps in the past
couple of weeks that have
forced the Cardinal to rely
heavily on strong pitching.
"It's important fora lot of
guys to know they can do some
damage but not try to do too
much," Putnam said. "If you
start trying too hard to carry the
load, you start forcing things,
swinging at bad pitches."
Marquess also said that
finding a consistent designated
hitter could help offensively in
Los Angeles. Junior Chris
Carter, freshman Ryan Seawell
and sophomore Ben Summer
hays are among the players that
have filled the role this season.
"The DH spot is really in
flux," Marquess said. "But
maybe we'll just get the hot guy
and put him in there."
The Bruin lineup hasn't
been quite as dominating as the
Cardinal order has been this
season, with only two regular
starters hitting above .300.
(Stanford has five above .300.
including sophomore Jed
Lowrie, who continues to pace
the team at .405.)

Senior Brian Hall and top-ranked Stanford hopes to prey on UCLA pitching this week
end. The Cardinal opens defense of its 2003 Pac-10 title with a three-game series
