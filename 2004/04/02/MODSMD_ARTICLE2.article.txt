### NANCY WANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford will open its doors this Sunday for
its third annual Community Day, a day of activi
ties that includes a carnival, lectures and a book
drive. The Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) will also be holding a celebration of
campus workers.
Events at Stanford's Community Day are
held throughout the day and are free and open to
the public. Featured activities include music,
arts, athletic events, science exhibits, faculty lec
tures, a children's community carnival and a
health fair.
"Community Day is a day for Stanford to
open its gates to the surrounding community
and encourage more interaction between the
University and its neighbors," said senior
Katie Buchanan, who will be present at the
face-painting booth for Cap and Gown
Honor Society.
Around 6,500 visitors attended the event in
2002 — its inaugural year — and an estimated
8,000 were present last year.
The Stanford Community Carnival, held
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., is the largest draw for
Community Day and includes a variety of activ
ities for people of all ages.
Highlights of the carnival include music per
formances, cultural exhibits and student art ex
hibits staged in and around Building 460. A chil
dren's community carnival will also be held on
Lomita Mall, and athletic events will take place
on the Oval.
Other activities offered throughout the day
include faculty lectures in Building 200, a learn
ing area in Memorial Court, a book drive, sci
ence and research programs at the Science and
Engineering Quadrangle and Stone Pine Plaza
and a health fair on Serra Mall. There will also
be lectures by Pamela Matson, dean of the
School of Earth Sciences, and Nobel laureate
Douglas Osheroff, the J. G. Jackson and C. J.
Wood Professor of Physics.
In addition to the Stanford Community Car
nival, other events on Community Day include
Shakespeare in Asia exhibits and the Universi
ty's annual Founders' Celebration. In commem-

oration of the lives of Stanford's
founders Leland and Jane Stanford
and their son, the Stanford Mau
soleum will be opened to the public.
The Cantor Arts Center will also
host events for the public from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.
Junior Connie Chen, an organizer
of the children's carnival, noted that
in addition to bringing the surround
ing communities together. Commu
nity Day also unifies the Stanford
community.
"What 1 find particularly won
derful about Community Day is that
in reinforcing ties with its neighbors,
Stanford also strengthens its ties
within its own community," Chen
said. "For example, the carnival
brings together many aspects of stu
dent life. Dorms, fraternities, dance
and a cappella groups and commu
nity service groups all mobilize to
bring a day of free games, booths
and prizes for children from the
local community."
SLAC and the Student Labor
Alliance, a new group that seeks to
represent a unified voice for labor
on campus, will host a gathering ti
tled"Workers, Students and Fami
lies: Celebrating Unity in
Our Community."
The SLAC gathering will also
feature a barbeque and games to
help promote unity within the Stan
ford community.
The group has actively participat
ed in past years to raise issues of
wages and benefits, educational op
portunities, subcontracting and the
right to unionize.
The event is one of many actions
staged across campuses nationwide

as part of the Student Labor Action Project's
National Student Labor Week of Action.
"We want to acknowledge the contributions
workers make to our campus and remember the
role that we as students play in fostering a com

munity at Stanford that values and respects all of
its members," said SLAC coordinator and se
nior Sofia Lee.
