The No. 9 Stanford Softball team (27-7)
begins Pacific-10 Conference play this
weekend against Oregon State and Ore
gon at Boyd and Jill Family Stadium. The
Cardinal's three home games this weekend
wrap up a three-week, 14-game homes
tand. the team's longest of the season.
Thus far, this homestand has been a
very successful one, with the Cardinal
going 9-2, including wins over nationally
ranked Long Beach State. However, this
weekend, the Cardinal faces its toughest
opposition in over a month.
The Cardinal takes on No. 14 Oregon
State (30-9, 0-1 Pac-10) tonight in its first
game of the weekend. The Cardinal holds
a slight edge, 22-20, in the all-time series
versus the Beavers, but Stanford has the
momentum after winning all three
matchups between the two teams last year.
The Beaver offense is led by juniors
Vanessa lapala (.371 batting average, 33
RBI) and Kelly Peterson (.336, 30 runs
scored) and has been out-hitting oppo
nents by nearly a hundred points, posting a
team batting average of .277 against a .184
batting average allowed. This microscopic
opponents' batting average is a credit to the
stellar Beaver pitching staff, especially ace
pitcher Monica Hoffman. Hoffman's 14-6
won-lost record, 0.83 ERA and 158 strike
outs compare favorably to the statistics of
the Cardinal's own ace, senior Dana
Sorensen (15-4,1.11 ERA. 164 strikeouts).
It is likely that tonight's game will fea
ture a pitching matchup between these two
aces, but the Cardinal must be confident
that Sorensen can carry the day based on
her performance over spring break.
Sorensen was named both Pac-10 Play
er of the Week and USA Softball / NFC A
National Player of the Week last week
after going 4-0 with four complete-game
wins, three of them shutouts — including a

no-hitter in the final game of the Stanford
Classic against Hawaii.
Sorensen was a revelation in the circle
last week, striking out nearly two hitters
per inning with 56 punchouts and just 11
hits allowed in 31 innings of work. After the
Hawaii game, Sorensen said she was
"ready for conference play", but she must
remain on top of her game this weekend
for the Cardinal to win out.
The Cardinal's final two games of the
weekend are both against No. 17 Oregon
(25-8,1-0), Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.
and 1 p.m., respectively. Oregon features a
potent offense led by Kayleen Hudson
(.377) and Jenn Poore (.374), the top hitters
in a dangerous lineup sporting a .300 team
batting average.
The Cardinal will hope to stymie the
Duck hitters behind the pitching of
Sorensen and sophomore Laura Severson.
who was more than proficient in picking up
several wins of her own last week. Al
though Sorensen deservedly got much of
the credit for last week's victories, the Car
dinal offense proved a force to lie reckoned
with, scoring 27 runs in its last seven games.
Indeed, the top of the Cardinal batting
order — freshman Jackie Rinehart, junior
Katharine Hoffman, sophomores Lauren
Lappin and Catalina Morris and senior Jes
sica Allister — features some of the best
hitters in the conference. Lauren Lappin,
an Olympian, hit .478 over the Cardinal's
last seven games with a team-leading seven
RBI in that span, and leadoff hitter Jackie
Rinehart continued to set the table for the
rest of the lineup with 11 hits and a .440 bat
ting average last weekend.
The Cardinal needs to make a strong
showing this weekend against the Oregon
teams if they hope to contend in the unbe
lievably tough Pac-10 Conference, in
which all eight teams are nationally ranked
and five of the eight are in the top 10 in the

tand. the team's longest of the season.
Thus far, this homestand has been a
very successful one, with the Cardinal
going 9-2, including wins over nationally
ranked Long Beach State. However, this
weekend, the Cardinal faces its toughest
opposition in over a month.
The Cardinal takes on No. 14 Oregon
State (30-9, 0-1 Pac-10) tonight in its first
game of the weekend. The Cardinal holds
a slight edge, 22-20, in the all-time series
versus the Beavers, but Stanford has the
momentum after winning all three
matchups between the two teams last year.
The Beaver offense is led by juniors
Vanessa lapala (.371 batting average, 33
RBI) and Kelly Peterson (.336, 30 runs
scored) and has been out-hitting oppo
nents by nearly a hundred points, posting a
team batting average of .277 against a .184
batting average allowed. This microscopic
opponents' batting average is a credit to the
stellar Beaver pitching staff, especially ace
pitcher Monica Hoffman. Hoffman's 14-6
won-lost record, 0.83 ERA and 158 strike
outs compare favorably to the statistics of
the Cardinal's own ace, senior Dana
Sorensen (15-4,1.11 ERA. 164 strikeouts).
It is likely that tonight's game will fea
ture a pitching matchup between these two
aces, but the Cardinal must be confident
that Sorensen can carry the day based on
her performance over spring break.
Sorensen was named both Pac-10 Play
er of the Week and USA Softball / NFC A
National Player of the Week last week
after going 4-0 with four complete-game
wins, three of them shutouts — including a

no-hitter in the final game of the Stanford
Classic against Hawaii.
Sorensen was a revelation in the circle
last week, striking out nearly two hitters
per inning with 56 punchouts and just 11
hits allowed in 31 innings of work. After the
Hawaii game, Sorensen said she was
"ready for conference play", but she must
remain on top of her game this weekend
for the Cardinal to win out.
The Cardinal's final two games of the
weekend are both against No. 17 Oregon
(25-8,1-0), Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.
and 1 p.m., respectively. Oregon features a
potent offense led by Kayleen Hudson
(.377) and Jenn Poore (.374), the top hitters
in a dangerous lineup sporting a .300 team
batting average.
The Cardinal will hope to stymie the
Duck hitters behind the pitching of
Sorensen and sophomore Laura Severson.
who was more than proficient in picking up
several wins of her own last week. Al
though Sorensen deservedly got much of
the credit for last week's victories, the Car
dinal offense proved a force to lie reckoned
with, scoring 27 runs in its last seven games.
Indeed, the top of the Cardinal batting
order — freshman Jackie Rinehart, junior
Katharine Hoffman, sophomores Lauren
Lappin and Catalina Morris and senior Jes
sica Allister — features some of the best
hitters in the conference. Lauren Lappin,
an Olympian, hit .478 over the Cardinal's
last seven games with a team-leading seven
RBI in that span, and leadoff hitter Jackie
Rinehart continued to set the table for the
rest of the lineup with 11 hits and a .440 bat
ting average last weekend.
The Cardinal needs to make a strong
showing this weekend against the Oregon
teams if they hope to contend in the unbe
lievably tough Pac-10 Conference, in
which all eight teams are nationally ranked
and five of the eight are in the top 10 in the
