Josh Childress may be leaving
the Stanford men's basketball
team this spring, depending on
how his stock fares after the ju
nior participates in this spring's
pre-NBA Draft works.
"I plan on putting my name
in and testing it out. testing the
waters," Childress told the As
sociated Press Wednesday
night. "I do not plan on hiring
an agent right now, just from
the standpoint of coming back
if I need to."
The NCAA allows college
underclassmen to declare for
the NBA Draft and later with
draw themselves and return to
school, as long as they do not
sign an agent or otherwise for
feit their amateur status.
The NBA Pre-Draft Camp
takes place June 8-11 at Chica
go's Moody Bible Institute,
and the early entrant with
drawal deadline is June 17, one
week before the Draft is held in
New York City.
Prior to Childress, former

Stanford standouts Jason
Collins, Curtis Borchardt and
Casey Jacobsen also went this
route. All three stayed in the
Draft, and all three were first
round selections.
Childress, the Pac-10 Player
of the Year, averaged 15.7
points and 7.5 rebounds this
season, leading the Cardinal to
a 30-2 record an a No. 1 nation
al ranking.
In the past days and weeks,
Cardinal head coach Mike
Montgomery has avoided com
menting on the issue, other
than to say that he expected
Childress to return.
An article in Wednesday's
San Jose Mercury News citing
anonymous sources close to
Childress first reported that the
Los Angeles native would de
clare for the Draft, and the AP
later reported that Childress
told Montgomery of his deci
sion on Tuesday.
"I don't know that Josh
ever said he was going to look
at the Draft," Montgomery
said on March 23. "Did he?
No. As far as we're concerned.
Josh's intent has always been

on returning to school, getting
his degree and finishing his ca
reer with his teammates."
When questioned about
Childress's status by the Mer
cury News on Tuesday, Mont
gomery said only, "Ask
Josh." Childress reportedly
had not intended to disclose
his declaration for the Draft
until next week.
Childress told the AP he
would complete his sociology
degree in the future regardless
of whether he left for the pros
or not. He also stressed that his
college career isn't necessarily
a closed book just yet.
"I don't want to make it
seem like I'm gone for sure,"
he told the AF. "I really cher
ished my years here at Stan
ford. But I owe it to myself... I
want to see how I stack up
against other players."
The loss of Childress would
be a particularly brutal blow to
the Cardinal program, which is
already losing three seniors in
starting power forward Justin
Davis, starting shooting guard
Matt Lottich and backup big
man Joe Kirchofer.
