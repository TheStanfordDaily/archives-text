# Volleyball eyes playoffs, road win
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Vengeance will he the name of the game
on Friday when the No. 8 Stanford men's
volleyball team (8-13,5-11 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) takes on No. 5 Cal State-
Northridge (16-7. 10-6).
"Cal State-Northridge is a huge game for
us because of the way they embarrassed us
on our own court [in January]," said junior
middle blocker Craig Buell, who, like most
of his teammates, was held to single-digit
kills in the 3-0 loss to the Matadors. Junior
outside hitter David Vogel led the Cardinal
attack that night with 11.
And on Saturday, when Stanford travels
to face No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara (12-11, 7-9),
there will be similar pressure. The Cardinal
defeated the Gauchos in January in a close
contest that included ties on seven consecu
tive points in the decisive fifth game. For the
Gauchos, the loss was one of a slew of de
feats on opponents' courts. Like the Cardi
nal, UCSB has notched only one win on the
road.
In addition to the challenge of a victory
outside of Burnham Pavilion, the Cardinal
faces the question of future play.
"UC-Santa Barbara is the team directly
in front of us in seventh place," Buell said.
"If we beat them again, we could position
ourselves to move higher in the seedings or
solidify our spot for playoffs."

But against two solid MPSF teams, wins
this weekend will take a lot of work. Though
a loss to top-ranked Pepperdine ended the
Matadors' six-game winning streak, the
Northridge attack boasts three players with
200 kills or more, as well as senior setter Ty
Tramblie. Tramblie, the shortest player on
the team at 6-foot-0, has already notched
921 assists this season.
"They are a good team," Buell said. "But
if we play as well as we are capable of, we
have a good shot at beating them."
UCSB is led by the outstanding play of
freshman outside hitter Evan Patak, who
has registered 311 kills this season by hitting
at a .329 clip. On average, Patak chips in
over five kills per game, a show that's
earned him second in the MPSF for that cat
egory.
According to Stanford head coach Don
Shaw, the primary focus right now is on his
team's intensity.
"My concern right now is that we've had
a couple of real lethargic practices this
week," Shaw said yesterday, going on to
mention that two road trips tend to drain
players' energy anyway.
"You always kind of worry about being a
little lethargic after riding on a bus," he said.
"Hopefully we can get in a good practice
[before the game]."
In terms of skills, Shaw said the basics —
serving and passing — would be key.
"I'm always worried about our
passing," he said. "That's what
you have to do in order to win:
serve and pass."
But the Cardinal's lack of hard
servers makes it difficult to pre
pare for the kind of swings Stan
ford has to return in MPSF play.
"Since we're not a very good
serving team, we don't see the
kind of serves [we see] in games in
practice," Shaw said.
Hopefully, Stanford can match
the passing performance it put on
last Friday against UC-San Diego,
a show that impressed Shaw.
Offensively, it's likely that
Stanford will seek out junior out
side hitter Pat Bomhack, who led
the Cardinal attack with a total of
20 kills last weekend.
"Pat Bomhack is our new star,"
Buell said.
