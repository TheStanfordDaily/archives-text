# Water polo looks to revamp at undefeated USC
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Fifteen-plus games and counting. It's the
middle of the season and that can be reason
enough to lag.
But even with the Stanford women's
water polo team (12-2, 5-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) being a little tired — an
exhausted "'Yes!" was the athletes' reply to
whether or not they were worn out — the
squad is still showing signs of intensity and
passion as they approach this weekend's
game against top-ranked Southern Califor
nia (15-0,6-0).
"We want to peak at the end of our sea
son," senior Lauren Faust explained. "It's
more important to peak at the MPSF tourna
ment and the NCAA Championships."
Things look bright for Stanford as it heads
toward the postseason, but it will have to deal
with the undefeated Women of Troy first.
"USC's been the thorn in our side,"
sophomore Amanda Matuk said.
There is much truth in that statement, as
both times Stanford played USC in tourna

ments earlier this season, the Cardinal fell in
close games. In fact, the Trojans have been
the only ones to hand Stanford official losses.
As it hopes to extend its winning streak to
five games, the Cardinal may be thinking
about those two defeats.
Stanford head coach John Tanner offers a
different view.
"I don't think it's a matter of what [previ
ous games) meant," Tanner said, "But this is
an MPSF match that matters, and it will be a
reflection of us playing better as the season
goes along."
Stanford has improved steadily over the
course of the season and while its improve
ment may not be visible in its won-lost
record, the weekend's matchup could show
how far the relatively young team has come
this year.
"Since our games in Hawaii, we've im
proved, but we've been practicing and work
ing hard," Faust said. "We still definitely
need to step it up."
Stanford will face a USC team with a
strong 6-on-5 offense and defense, similar to
its own, which is what Tanner credits for both

team's success.
The Women of Troy had the small scare
of possibly receiving their first loss this sea
son last Saturday. USC wrangled with No. 5
Long Beach State (12-5, 3-3) in a double
overtime game. Nevertheless, USC contin
ued its perfect season as it escaped Long
Beach, 12-10.
The Trojans carry that record into tomor
row's match against the Cardinal, as the ri
vals face each other at noon in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal hopes to halt high-scoring
sophomore Moriah Van Norman — she
leads her team in goals — and ruin USC's
perfect record in the important MPSF match.
"We just want to beat [USC]," Faust said.
"Although we lost against USC in tourna
ments, this is a more important game."
Saturday's game, unlike the past two
matches, actually counts toward the confer
ence standings. A Stanford win on Saturday
would not only give the Women of Troy their
first loss but it would also push the Cardinal
up to first place in MPSF standings. While
that certainly plays a role in the match. Tan
ner would rather see good results than just a

win or loss.
"I just want to put in effort physically and
mentally," Tanner said. "We |should| play
cohesively and with a lot of energy."
Stanford will counterattack USC's strong
game with senior Wendy Watkins, the squad's
highest scorer, and goalkeeper Meridith Mc-
Coll, who has been essential to the Cardinal's
success in the pool.
Stanford continues the small road trip
against No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara (11-9. 2-3)
on Sunday. Stanford can hope to catch a tired
Santa Barbara team. The Gauchos are com
ing back from a trip to Hawaii, where they
lost the Rainbow Classic title to No. 3 UCLA
(13-3,3-1).
Alter its southern California road trip, the
Cardinal's last regular home stand is against
Pacific on April 10.
So while the Cardinal is a little worn out as
it approaches the beginning of the end of its
regular season, it is excited to have the
chance to show how it has prepared for the
upcoming game.
"We get pumped up knowing what we
work for will pay off soon." Matuk said.

reflection of us playing better as the season
goes along."
Stanford has improved steadily over the
course of the season and while its improve
ment may not be visible in its won-lost
record, the weekend's matchup could show
how far the relatively young team has come
this year.
"Since our games in Hawaii, we've im
proved, but we've been practicing and work
ing hard," Faust said. "We still definitely
need to step it up."
Stanford will face a USC team with a
strong 6-on-5 offense and defense, similar to
its own, which is what Tanner credits for both

team's success.
The Women of Troy had the small scare
of possibly receiving their first loss this sea
son last Saturday. USC wrangled with No. 5
Long Beach State (12-5, 3-3) in a double
overtime game. Nevertheless, USC contin
ued its perfect season as it escaped Long
Beach, 12-10.
The Trojans carry that record into tomor
row's match against the Cardinal, as the ri
vals face each other at noon in Los Angeles.
The Cardinal hopes to halt high-scoring
sophomore Moriah Van Norman — she
leads her team in goals — and ruin USC's
perfect record in the important MPSF match.
"We just want to beat [USC]," Faust said.
"Although we lost against USC in tourna
ments, this is a more important game."
Saturday's game, unlike the past two
matches, actually counts toward the confer
ence standings. A Stanford win on Saturday
would not only give the Women of Troy their
first loss but it would also push the Cardinal
up to first place in MPSF standings. While
that certainly plays a role in the match. Tan
ner would rather see good results than just a

win or loss.
"I just want to put in effort physically and
mentally," Tanner said. "We |should| play
cohesively and with a lot of energy."
Stanford will counterattack USC's strong
game with senior Wendy Watkins, the squad's
highest scorer, and goalkeeper Meridith Mc-
Coll, who has been essential to the Cardinal's
success in the pool.
Stanford continues the small road trip
against No. 10 UC-Santa Barbara (11-9. 2-3)
on Sunday. Stanford can hope to catch a tired
Santa Barbara team. The Gauchos are com
ing back from a trip to Hawaii, where they
lost the Rainbow Classic title to No. 3 UCLA
(13-3,3-1).
Alter its southern California road trip, the
Cardinal's last regular home stand is against
Pacific on April 10.
So while the Cardinal is a little worn out as
it approaches the beginning of the end of its
regular season, it is excited to have the
chance to show how it has prepared for the
upcoming game.
"We get pumped up knowing what we
work for will pay off soon." Matuk said.
