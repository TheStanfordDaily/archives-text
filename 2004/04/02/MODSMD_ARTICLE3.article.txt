Undergraduate Research Programs
will present a Pre-Field Preparation Con
ference this Saturday in an attempt to
teach students how to use their field-re
search grants.
The conference, which was held for the
first time last year, will stress the impor
tance of field studies and the many process
es involved, including strategies for design
ing surveys and questionnaires, archival
and public service work and how to make
use of on-campus resources before and
after a trip.
"Our questions influence what we per
ceive as answers and how we collect data
[for research]," explained Renee Courey,
associate director of student services for
Undergraduate Research Programs.

"Since questions evolve over time, it's im
portant to return to the field or archive or lab
to look again at material or conditions, even
those that have already been studied, so that
we can ask new questions and gain the in
sights we need," she said.
David Abernethy, professor emeritus of
political science, will open the conference
with a keynote address, entitled "Pre-Field
Preparation: What it Involves and Why it's
Important."
The address will be followed by a panel
on field experiences, featuring faculty from
the deparments of Anthropological Sci
ences, Cultural and Social Anthropology
and History.
The conference will also host work
shops on methods and issues involved in
fieldwork, data collection, designing in
terviews and transporting samples. The
afternoon session will feature breakout
panels with experts on research in differ

ent areas of the world, including Latin
America, Eastern Europe, Africa and the
Middle East.
The conference will close with advice
from a panel of students.
Courey stressed the contributions of
conference alumni and other students who
have previously used grant funding for
field research.
"Last year, over 100 students attended
and responded very favorably to our exit
survey. Their suggestions helped us to
plan for this year's event," she said. "As
much as we each prepare for our re
search, there's nothing like an experi
enced guide to save you time, money and
much anxiety. Hindsight is 20 / 20, but the
next best thing is learning from someone
else's experience and expertise."
The conference begins at 8:45 a.m., with
registration and breakfast in the lobby
ofTCSeq.
