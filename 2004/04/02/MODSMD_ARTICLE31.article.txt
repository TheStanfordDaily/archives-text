## Jennie's spring music guide The
						best CDs of March 9 and frat party playlists 
### JENNIE KIM CRITIC AT LARGE 
Tuesday, March 9 was a great,
great day — the sun was shining,
flowers blooming, butterflies
were a'flutter and all the birds
were dead and gone. Hate birds.
The world was an oyster made
safe for democracy.

But more importantly, Franz Ferdinand and TV
On The Radio released their first full-length albums
— "Franz Ferdinand" and "Desperate Youth,
Bloodthirsty Babes," respectively — that day.
Clearly, March 9 is long gone, so this column may
seem a bit stale, but sometimes it takes a while to
discern if the music is truly hype-worthy, and as any
respectable indie on the Insound and Pitchfork,
mailing lists can attest to, these bands got hyped.
Not Leßron-sized hype — subtler — more like
Carmelo Anthony-sized hype. Now the regular sea
son's almost over, and the Nuggets (the Nuggets!)
might sneak into the play-offs. The verdict is in:
Guilty as charged.
Similarly, when new music comes out, especially
when it's the weird kind, you need time to deter
mine whether or not it's good or innovative or
painful or just weeeird, but when you've got a dead
line to meet, you're often rushed to judgment. After
spending a month with Franz Ferdinand and TV On
The Radio, I'm convinced that they're well worth
the $11.99 sticker price.

CD releases, weather, class
schedules — everything is
better Spring Quarter — it
just is. Best of all, the social
scene starts to get better as the
days get longer. (But then
again, after Winter quarter,
how could it get any worse?)
Greek life picks up cour
tesy of rush week, which
means that frats throw better
parties. So. in honor of Stan
ford's fine tradition of party
hopping, here are some sug
gested playlists for the housed
frats on campus.
