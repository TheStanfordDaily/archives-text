# The 						mouse is back in the house with 'Good News'
## 
### ERIC FREEMAN INTERMISSION WRITER 
I consider Modest Mouse to be the best band working today. I
apologize for the blunt opening sentence, but singer / guitarist /
genius Isaac Brock, bassist Eric Judy and drummer Jeremiah
Green (replaced by Ben Wiekel in April, 2003) are without a
doubt the best artists ever to come out of a trailer park. I revere
Brock as one would a deity. I know the Modest Mouse gang sign.
All hipster posturing aside, I have never anticipated an album as
much as "Good News for People Who Love Bad News." I await
ed the release with an eagerness rivaled only by my yearning for

high school to end. Then, "Good News" (RIAA

ALERT!) leaked onto the internet on Valentine's

Day. Yes, some of you may have been having sex

that night, but I assure you that I was in the greatei
state of ecstasy.
Initially, I really liked the album. "The World
at Large" is a nice, delicate track featuring lazy
strings, a solid guitar melody and typical Brock

lyrics about isolation and wandering. The first sin-

gle, "Float On," is the first Modest Mouse song that

people can actually dance to. "The View" is an excellent

disco-punk song from a band that you wouldn't even think to as
sociate with the genre. The first listen made it quite obvious that
this album is their most accessible to date. I expected it only to get
better with more listens, as this phenomenon has been felt the
world over by Modest Mouse fans of all ages and ethnicities.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen. For the first time, 1 found my
self disliking Modest Mouse songs. "Black Cadillacs" marks the
first time that they have not sounded like Modest Mouse; they

could be anybody. Brock has long been known for his unique
lyrics, but on this record he seems to be doing a pale imitation of
himself, with lesser lines like "Well sure as planets come I know
that they end," he sings in"Bury Me With It," replacing his usual
offbeat musings such as "The universe is shaped exactly like the
earth if you go straight long enough you end up where you were."
There are also some downright horrible lyrics, as Brock mines
Dashboard Confessional territory with "My friends, my habits,
my family / They mean so much to me" (from "One Chance").
The worst aspect of the album, however, rests in the songwrit
ing. Brock is a slave to the pop song structure on Good News. This
does not mean that the songs are bad; indeed, "Bukowski," "The

View" and "Bury Me With It" are all very good songs. Brock,

however, has never been a pop songwriter. It should be

clear to all familiar with his work that he was born to
write sweeping six-minute tales of frustration and isola
tion with many styles and various shifts in volume and
tempo. Here, however, the only song over five minutes
is "Blame it on the Tetons," the most monotonous
song Modest Mouse has ever produced.
If Good News had been made by an up and

coming band, I would have given this the highest possible

rating and championed them as the next big thing. The prob-

lem is that this is Modest Mouse; we all know they're capable of
much more. It's not fair to call it a regression, because this album
is much worse than anything else the band has ever done. It's sim
ply a bad decision. Cries of "sell out" do not seem applicable, but
something is definitely wrong about this record. Modest Mouse
simply has nothing to prove to the Phantom Planets of the world,
so why are they even trying? Good News is a very good album.
Just not for Modest Mouse.



Mddest Mouse frontnian Isaac Brock is angrv. He shouts a lot.
