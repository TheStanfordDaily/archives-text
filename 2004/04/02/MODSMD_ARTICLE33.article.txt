# Being Charlie Kaufman
## Picking the minds of Kaufman and Michel Gondry 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN INTERMISSION EDITOR 
Charlie Kaufman and
Michel Gondry are tired. The
creative minds behind Eter-

nal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind {Kaufman wrote it,

Gondry shot it) have been
ushered across the country
' —from one swank Ritz
esque hotel to another —
for the past three days by
publicists hoping to garner
good press for the latest

'Kaufman mindfuck (he
previously penned Being

John Malkovich and

Adaptation,/.
' /, on the other
hand, ant bright
ly ed. I've been
[ psyched ud for

"r J 1 "
the interview by a
grande caramel
macchiato and a
refreshing tour

oftheßitz Carlton's lobby bathroom (all marble and glass, with
rolled handtowels on the sink and a whiff ofjasmine in the air).
By that, and by the chance to meet the two men who are by far
the most interesting and visionary creators in Hollywood today.
Kaufman, in person, looks like exactly what you'd expect of
a writer who explores themes of unconfidence, failure and re
gret: small, pale, with scraggly facial hair and a mop of reddish
curls. When I introduce myself, he responds with a diffident
"Hi." He can barely look me in the eyes. In front of him are the
half-eaten remains of a chocolate chip cookie.
Gondry is as French as the Seine. No — he's more French
than the Seine. He pronounces "written" as "REE ten," "little"
as "LEE tell" and "dramatic" as "draw ma TEEK." He comes
dangerously close to saying "SHER lee" instead of "Charlie,"
and his voice is confident but pre-pubescent in pitch.
Kaufman and Gondry met years ago through Spike Jonze,
director of two previous Kaufman scripts and a wacky Fatboy

Slim video with Christopher Walken. To
gether, the three form a unique vanguard
challenging the studio blockbuster for
mula with creative, honest, indie-style
servings of cinematic beauty.
But Gondry and Kaufman are here
to talk about their movie, Eternal Sun
shine of the Spotless Mind, not about
breathing new life into the now-staid
Hollywood formula. Watching Eternal
Sunshine is about as close to achieving
orgasm in a public theater as legally
permissible. The story chronicles the
tumultuous love of Joel Barish (Jim
Carrey) and his dark, rebellious inama
rata, Clementine (a gorgeous Kate
Winslet). After a painful fight, the im
pulsive Clem uses a little-known proce
dure to erase Joel from her mind. When
Joel discovers his erasure, he sets out to
do the same to her, and most of the rest
of the movie takes place in his mind, as
his memories of Clem are being erased
in reverse
Since much of the narrative is re
vealed in Joel's memories, as they're
being destroyed, Gondry is given some
breathing room to use his innovative vi
sual style. As Joel walks out of the book
store where Clem works, for instance,
the overhead lights turn off as he passes

beneath them and the store disappears - a
simple hut effective trick. In another
memory, Joel and Clem are at a train sta
tion and fellow passengers disappear, one
by-one. with a loud "plop." In less capable
hands, such chicanery might be distrac
tion. but in Eternal Sunshine it's a stun
ningly effective way to explore the dynam
ics of love.
"I think we were just trying to tell a story
that felt true," Kaufman says. "It's certainly
daunting [to tell a story admist disorienting
imagery], but I don't care if people are inter
ested, 1 guess. I have to be interested and
then hopefully someone else will be inter
ested. If you start thinking [about how the
film will be received] when you're working
then you're second-guessing and it's non
sense and you'll come up with something
that's insincere."

Gondry, in agreement, says thai he doesn't do things just to
be "visually cool." He tells a story from his childhood: His two
favorite drinks were orange juice and milk, so, in an attempt to
create the perfect drink, he mixed the two.
"It was a disaster," he says. Then, moving back to the
movie: "I'm not trying to do something that's 'cool,' I'm trying
to go where my curiosity pushes me."
To the publicist's chagrin, Kaufman and Gondry don't
want to just hype the movie — after three days with journalists
they've been asked every Eternal Sunshine-related question
possible. Kaufman, whose conversational vigor up until now
seems to reveal a serious vitamin deficiency, becomes visibly
excited when he's asked about his storytelling philosophy:
Charlie Kaufman: I think you can be as outlandish as you
want, or surreal as you want, as long as the characters are
based in something real. You can put them in any situation
or any reality as long as their reactions have something to
do with human beings and you're focused on that element
of it. I'm not interested in necessarily doing realistic things,
obviously. I like fanciful stuff. But it can't just be fanciful
without people in it. Then it's of no interest. If you decide
that people are turning into carrots or something as your
story idea then I think that I would have to figure out why
that's important to me as a person and why that story res

onates in some way. Otherwise there's no story. It's just
kind of a gimmick.
Michel (iondry: But don't you think — you would not be in
terested to write a story without people?
CK: Without people?
MG: Well, like the story of life, or whatever. It could be an ab
stract story.
CK: You're not one of these journalists! What are vou asking
this for?
MG: I'm curious! It's something that —
CK: I don't know. No, I think if I were to write a story without
people — and I've never considered it before, but I'm trying to
now — it would still have to do with people in some way, be
cause that's what I am, and that's what I know. So even if it
didn't have people in it, it would still be about people.
MG: Well, but, like — okay, I don't want to put you on the
spot —
CK: You can put me on the spot, I'm fine.
MG: But, like, don't you think it could be a story about a suc
cession of color, for instance? Music is narrative. It evolves
some way and it's dramatic but it doesn't say a story about
somebody. Don't you think it would be possible to write a
story which is not connected with a human person?
CK: 1 m not saying anything wouldn't be possible.
MG: Would you try — for me?
CK: For you ? Okay, I'll try for you.

There are five eollege-age reporters in the
room, each burning to get his or her questions
answered in the meager 25-minute time slot
we've been given. Yet at this moment we want
nothing more than to listen to Kaufman and
Gondry continue arguing aesthetics, just be
tween the two of them.
Mid-memory wipe, after his mind has
rewinded past his painful breakup with Clem
and started to recall the poignant and beautiful
early moments of their relationship, Joel
changes his mind about the procedure. He
struggles to hold onto wisps of his memories of
Clem. If I didn't know that Kaufman is abhors
the idea of morality creeping into his scripts, I
would swear that he is. trying to make a point
about the sanctity of memories as the key defin
ition of who we are.
He admits this much about the procedure: "I
would never do it."
Gondry, in his wily French way, comes to the
same conclusion.
"Maybe the small things," he says, "like if I
walk out and there's a big hole in my pants and
everybody laugh, maybe these I would want to
erase." But he almost immediately he recants.
"It's a good thing to tell funny stories, so I would
keep it."
