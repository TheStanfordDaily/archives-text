# Q&A with Kevin Smith
## The' Clerks' director moves past poop jokes 
### BEATRICE KIM INTERMISSION WRITER 
When you think of Kevin Smith, you usually
think of lesbians, poop monsters, maybe even
snoogins. Dirty humor and fart jokes seem to be
Smith's forte with movies like "Mall Rats,'
"Dogma" and ihe one that started it all, "Clerks.'
At the time, bathroom humor was perfect for his
teenaged fan base, but they've grown up these past
ten years and, apparently, so has he.
"Jersey Girl" is Smith's latest movie and stars
one of his regulars, Ben Affleck, as publicist Ollie
Trinke whose life dramatically changes when his
wife (Jennifer Lopez) dies and leaves him with a
baby daughter (Raquel Castro). Stripped from his
previous city life of celebrities and glamour, Ollie
moves to his hometown and learns to be a father
while finding himself.
INT: "Jersey Girl" is very different from your other
movies. Are you afraid you'll lose your hardcore
fans?
KEVIN SMITH: When I was writing the script, 1
definitely thought about losing my hardcore 13-14-
year-old boys audience, but those who enjoyed
"Chasing Amy" or even those who grew up with
"Clerks" and expect "cock-smoking snoogins" in
my movies will. I'm sure, like this movie. They've
grown up.
INT: What inspired you to write this?
KS: I didn't feel like writing for kids but about
kids. I married and had a kid, that definitely
played a big role.
INT: Why did you end the Jay and Silent Bob saga?
KS: It was two-fold. I really wanted to make a
movie that didn't lean on movies that came before
them. "Clerks" was the only movie that had done
that, so I wanted to make a movie that could stand
on its own. Also. Jason Mewes was so knee-deep
in heroin use. It came to a point that 1 told him that
he had to clean up; 1 couldn't use him. I wanted
him to have a small part in "Jersey Girl" but he
couldn't even travel to New Jersey because he had
a bench warrant. Good news is that Mews has
cleaned up.
INT: How did the movie get an R-rating?
KS: Yeah, that was insane. The sequence of Ben
and Liv in the diner did it. Look, I know every guy
in the planet would want to go into a diner and hear
Liv talk about masturbation. One of the guys from
the MP A A says he had a 16-year-old daughter and
didn't want her to see a scene like that. I don't know
what you're thinking, but you- 16-year-old is mas
turbating, 111 tell you that. We appealed though
and we got the PG-13. Thankfully, we didn't have

to make any cuts.
INT: How was it working with Will Smith?
KS: Will Smith was a real sweetheart, didn't come
with an entourage, didn't charge us up the ass for
his appearance, really nice. I thought Ben Affleck
was the sweetheart of Hollywood but it might have
to be Will Smith.
INT: How do you feel about "Jersey Girl" hav
ing your name as the filling block? I know you
hate that.
KS: Yeah, I saw that and I called up Harvey [We
instein] and was like "you can't do that, I don't feel
comfortable doing that, I've never done that. For
me, it was a collective effort." And he told me,
"You need to grow up, you're now a marketing
sell." I guess I was more upset that they said it was
a comedy cause it's more of a dramedy.
INT: Was there some stuff you couldn't do with a
seven-year-old girl on the set?
KS: Yeah, I couldn't smoke as much. I couldn't
swear as much either, even if I do in front of my
own kid. There was an interesting roadblock be
cause I would tell Raquel [the actress who plays the
seven-year-old], "Ok, now give him a hug and a
kiss," and she would be, like, "Eww, I don't want to
kiss a boy!"
INT: What drew you to Liv Tyler?
KS: The same day that Chasing Amy came out her
movie "Inventing the Abbots" came out and I fell
in love with her in that movie. When I was writing
"Jersey Girl" I wrote Maya with Liv in my mind
and was hoping she'd jump on and she did. She was
just coming off of "Lord of the Rings" and she
wanted to do some dialogue. I mean she's walking
and she's got cute ears but she didn't really get to
have real dialogue in "Rings."
INT: Do you see yourself doing another movie on
religion after seeing the success of "The Passion of
the Christ?"
KS: 1 was pretty done after Dogma. But now that I
see the popularity of "The Passion," I'm thinking 1
should've put a bloody Christ. I was more about
the living Christ, the one who walked around and
talked to people, healed them.
INT: What was your favorite moment on the set?
KS: The scene when Ben was working with one of
the infants. We have a whole bunch on the set, and
he was apologizing for being a shitty father. He's
talking to the kid and the baby totally projectile
vomits on him. He almost drop-kicked the baby but
you know, you can't drop the baby, so he just had
to take it. But I've never seen a guy move so fast.
INT: If you could be any comic book character,
who would you want to be?
KS: Mr. Fantastic cause he can stretch really big.
I'm thinking in terms of sex mainly.


Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. No, Jersey Girl is not a horror movie. We swear.
