# Kevin Smith's 'Jersey Girl'
## Don't worry —J. Lo dies 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
It's common knowledge: Jersey
sucks. I mean, honestly! Any state
that calls its traffic circles "jug han
dles" should be avoided at all costs.
Getting out of the Garbage State is
the central issue for high-powered
Manhattan publicist Ollie Trinke (Ben
Affleck) in Jersey Girl, a cliched ac
count of father-

hood kept alive
only because writer
/ director Kevin
Smith owns a set of
defibrillators.
Ollie kicks off
the movie in a fit of
emotions that Af-

fleck's talent cer
tainly isn't designed for: courting and
marrying Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez)
and then watching her die tragically in
childbirth. Ollie subsequently has a
well-justified breakdown due to the
birth of his daughter (also named
Gertrude) and the untimely death of
his wife (I mean untimely for them; if
Big-Booty were on the screen any
longer I suppose the audience would
partake in a collective barf-o-rama).
In his hysterics, Ollie makes a spuri
ous comment about an up-and-com
ing celebrity client of his, is ostracized
from the greater publicist community,
and is relegated to live with his dad
(George Carlin, playing the straight
man) as a garbage collector in New
Jersey.
Fast-forward seven years to see
Affleck as a dedicated father for
young Gertie (the saccharine-sweet
and amazingly talented seven-year
old Raquel Castro). Affleck looks
hopelessly out-of-place as a trash
collector, but brings warmth to the
down-on-his-luck Ollie as he hasn't
done to a character since the last
time he worked for Smith. Ollie still
hopes to make it back to the big
time, exchanging America's armpit
back for the City, but his kid's at
tachment to both Jersey and her
grandfather house leads Ollie on a

race against time in a sequence that
seems pasted on the end of the film
by a first-grader. What will he do?
Remain a family man, or pursue his
career ambitions?
Yeah, it's hokey and predictable.
The silly love story between Ollie and
graduate student / video clerk Maya
(monotonic yet effervescent Liv
Tyler) produces no additional emo
tional connection between the audi
ence and the

characters,
though it cer
tainly does
have its mo
ments of hilari
ty.
Kevin
Smith uses the

aforementioned electrodes.
Through all of the cornball elements
of the major plot lines. Smith sets the
little things right. Smith's characters
talk more or less like real human be
ings in this, his first "grown-up"
script (what the hell are "snootchie
bootchies" anyway?), but thankfully
he can't stop himself from writing in
great lowbrow humor. He's still got
the needless Star Wars references
("Punch it, Chewie!"), the lewd sex
jokes (Maya refers to one's regaining
a sex-life "getting back on the
horse"), and other such Smithisms.
He even lets little Gertie act out the
throat-cutting scene of "Sweeny
Todd" in a school talent show.
However one-liners and cute
running gags do not a great movie
make. Jersey Girl is too dopey, too
cliched, and just too lame for Kevin
Smith to salvage it. Though his most
personal film. Smith fails to make us
connect with his creation in a true
emotional level. The moral of the
story, delivered in a well-placed
cameo form an unexpected source,
is trite and corny.
The moral of this story is that
while Kevin Smith can make a lot
from not much (see: Ben Affleck),
not even the great Silent Bob him
self could have turned this one
around completely.

Top ten
reasons
why it
[Jersey
Girl]
didn't suck
as hard
as your
mom

1) J. Lo died within the first 15
minutes, after uttering memo
rable quotes such as "All those
skinny girls at the premiere will
make me look like a whale,
Ollie!" to which Ben Affleck
replies, "But honey, all those
skinny girls are crack addicts!"
Art imitates life. Yep.
2) The movie draws on every
stereotype of Jersey possible -
greasy diners (example:The New
Berlin Diner), heavy "Joisey" ac
cents, shitty roads with potholes,
anything to convince you that a
place that would be home to Ben
nifer truly would be Hell on Earth.
3) The little girl who plays the
spawn of Bennifer is adorable,
with quotes like "What are your
intentions for dating my father?
Do you plan on marrying him?"
— hopefully she doesn't end up
like Macauley Culkin or Ben
Savage. My biological clock is
ticking, and she makes me want
to have kids.
4) The idea of performing the
barber scene from "Sweeney
Todd" when all the other par
ent/kid duos perform "Memory"
from "Cats" is hilarious.
5) The acting gets exponentially
better after J. Lo dies. Go figure.
6) George Carlin is a badass co
median. 1 wish he were my
grandpa.
7) Kevin Smith is a genius for sav
ing this near-car wreck of a
movie, which was based on his
life/experiences as a father.
8) As of August of last year,
with the failure of "Gigli," the
studio removed all images of
Jennifer Lopez from this film's
commercials, trailers, and pro
mos, out of fear that people
would think it was another Ben
Affleck / J. Lo movie.
9) Liv Tyler uses the phrase
"mercy jump" and plays a non
sketchy grad student who's writ
ing her thesis on porn. Woo! Col
lege! Higher education!
10) J. Lo died within the first
15 minutes.

young Gertie (the saccharine-sweet
and amazingly talented seven-year
old Raquel Castro). Affleck looks
hopelessly out-of-place as a trash
collector, but brings warmth to the
down-on-his-luck Ollie as he hasn't
done to a character since the last
time he worked for Smith. Ollie still
hopes to make it back to the big
time, exchanging America's armpit
back for the City, but his kid's at
tachment to both Jersey and her
grandfather house leads Ollie on a

race against time in a sequence that
seems pasted on the end of the film
by a first-grader. What will he do?
Remain a family man, or pursue his
career ambitions?
Yeah, it's hokey and predictable.
The silly love story between Ollie and
graduate student / video clerk Maya
(monotonic yet effervescent Liv
Tyler) produces no additional emo
tional connection between the audi
ence and the

characters,
though it cer
tainly does
have its mo
ments of hilari
ty.
Kevin
Smith uses the

aforementioned electrodes.
Through all of the cornball elements
of the major plot lines. Smith sets the
little things right. Smith's characters
talk more or less like real human be
ings in this, his first "grown-up"
script (what the hell are "snootchie
bootchies" anyway?), but thankfully
he can't stop himself from writing in
great lowbrow humor. He's still got
the needless Star Wars references
("Punch it, Chewie!"), the lewd sex
jokes (Maya refers to one's regaining
a sex-life "getting back on the
horse"), and other such Smithisms.
He even lets little Gertie act out the
throat-cutting scene of "Sweeny
Todd" in a school talent show.
However one-liners and cute
running gags do not a great movie
make. Jersey Girl is too dopey, too
cliched, and just too lame for Kevin
Smith to salvage it. Though his most
personal film. Smith fails to make us
connect with his creation in a true
emotional level. The moral of the
story, delivered in a well-placed
cameo form an unexpected source,
is trite and corny.
The moral of this story is that
while Kevin Smith can make a lot
from not much (see: Ben Affleck),
not even the great Silent Bob him
self could have turned this one
around completely.

Top ten
reasons
why it
[Jersey
Girl]
didn't suck
as hard
as your
mom

1) J. Lo died within the first 15
minutes, after uttering memo
rable quotes such as "All those
skinny girls at the premiere will
make me look like a whale,
Ollie!" to which Ben Affleck
replies, "But honey, all those
skinny girls are crack addicts!"
Art imitates life. Yep.
2) The movie draws on every
stereotype of Jersey possible -
greasy diners (example:The New
Berlin Diner), heavy "Joisey" ac
cents, shitty roads with potholes,
anything to convince you that a
place that would be home to Ben
nifer truly would be Hell on Earth.
3) The little girl who plays the
spawn of Bennifer is adorable,
with quotes like "What are your
intentions for dating my father?
Do you plan on marrying him?"
— hopefully she doesn't end up
like Macauley Culkin or Ben
Savage. My biological clock is
ticking, and she makes me want
to have kids.
4) The idea of performing the
barber scene from "Sweeney
Todd" when all the other par
ent/kid duos perform "Memory"
from "Cats" is hilarious.
5) The acting gets exponentially
better after J. Lo dies. Go figure.
6) George Carlin is a badass co
median. 1 wish he were my
grandpa.
7) Kevin Smith is a genius for sav
ing this near-car wreck of a
movie, which was based on his
life/experiences as a father.
8) As of August of last year,
with the failure of "Gigli," the
studio removed all images of
Jennifer Lopez from this film's
commercials, trailers, and pro
mos, out of fear that people
would think it was another Ben
Affleck / J. Lo movie.
9) Liv Tyler uses the phrase
"mercy jump" and plays a non
sketchy grad student who's writ
ing her thesis on porn. Woo! Col
lege! Higher education!
10) J. Lo died within the first
15 minutes.

Ken Affleck, reeling from his loss of Jennifer Lopez, starts getting hack into the
game. From the childish grin on her face, it looks as if he'll he successful.

It's common knowledge: Jersey
sucks. I mean, honestly! Any state
that calls its traffic circles "jug han
dles" should be avoided at all costs.
Getting out of the Garbage State is
the central issue for high-powered
Manhattan publicist Ollie Trinke (Ben
Affleck) in Jersey Girl, a cliched ac
count of father-

hood kept alive
only because writer
/ director Kevin
Smith owns a set of
defibrillators.
Ollie kicks off
the movie in a fit of
emotions that Af-

fleck's talent cer
tainly isn't designed for: courting and
marrying Gertrude (Jennifer Lopez)
and then watching her die tragically in
childbirth. Ollie subsequently has a
well-justified breakdown due to the
birth of his daughter (also named
Gertrude) and the untimely death of
his wife (I mean untimely for them; if
Big-Booty were on the screen any
longer I suppose the audience would
partake in a collective barf-o-rama).
In his hysterics, Ollie makes a spuri
ous comment about an up-and-com
ing celebrity client of his, is ostracized
from the greater publicist community,
and is relegated to live with his dad
(George Carlin, playing the straight
man) as a garbage collector in New
Jersey.
