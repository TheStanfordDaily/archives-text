# Seeking acceptance in cruel, harsh social worlds: Part I

Why do you have to be a nonconformist like
ewrybody eke? — James Thurber
Everybody comes to Stanford with high hopes and
expectations about college. life will be different from
the concrete jungle known as high school. People will

actually be able to tell the dif
ference between "your" and
"you're." No one will call
you a nerd, because they're
just as big of nerds if not big
ger ones (see also: SLE).
Some of these über-nerds

might even find you attractive, as you realize that a per
son CAN balance brains and looks as well as have
more personality than corrugated cardboard. No one
will ask in amazement, "We have two kidneys? What
for? So we can donate one?" as you bang your head
against the desk out of frustration. You will find ac
ceptance - you will feel at home for the very first time.
And then harsh reality blasts that dream to
smithereens.
Let's face it — as secure in your intelligence as
you were in high school, being the cream of the
crop and all, you were still blown away by the
blinding brilliance of everyone else on The Farm.
People react differently when they can no
longer reassure themselves with the thought that
got them through high school, "Well, at least I'm
smart." We may feel as though we've lost part of
our identity. It happens to all of us, whether it be at
the beginning, middle, or end of our college ca
reers. So we try to find ourselves again. We exper
iment with new looks, or we stubbornly refuse to
change. We may even remain apathetic through
out it all. However, one thing is clear: Stanford is
sort of a big, incredibly smart high school, the high
school that we never had. We've got the jocks, the
nerds, the sorority girls, the frat boys, the indie kids,
the preps, the "whatever" college kids — if it's one
thing that Stanford stresses over and over and over
again, it's our "extreme diversity!"
As hard as you can try to convince yourself that
you don't really care what others think, that whole "I
don't give a fuck" attitude isn't completely convinc
ing. But don't worry. The rest of the world is looking
for validation and acceptance, too. Some resort to
the Internet for this, as I did when I put my ego and
self-esteem aside to apply for membership to multi
ple ljvejoumal.com rating communities. Instead of
playing a character, I took myself as the Stanford av
erage in looks / brains / personality, to maintain a de
gree of objective accuracy and integrity.
What are these "rating communities," exactly?
1 found two main types — the "elite as fuck" ones
and the "shallow as fuck" ones. You have to apply
to them, much like applying to college, only they
don't give a damn what you got on the SATs or
what APs you took. Instead, the members vote
"yes" or "no" on you depending on how much
they liked your application. Get enough "yes'es"
and you'll get a stamp accepting you; vice versa,
they'll tell you if they don't like you and they won't
be nice about it. No sugarcoating here.
The former type (with names like TheCool
("lub and ThelnCrowd) usually require text-based
applications, with questions such as "What are
your thoughts on body modifications / tattoos?"
and "Finish this sentence:' Arr matey, these land
lubbers-.' " Pretty fun fora fuzzy who likes to pro
crastinate; definitely more fun than writing papers.
Hiey usually ask you to include a photograph at
the end, as some of them still prefer that you're not
hideously ugly, as it would detract from the elite
nature of such a community.
Type 2 rating communities, the "shallow as

fuck" ones, have
names such as
"NewNonUglies"
and "Fucklnner-
Beauty." Pretty
straight to the

point, hull? Yeah. For the most part, they don't
give a shit about what your personality is like, as
long as you're hot in their eyes. The hotter the pic
tures, the more "yes" votes you'll elicit. If you're
even remotely insecure about your less-than-per
fect face and body, don't bother applying. They'll
rip you to shreds and have no mercy.
Type l:The EKte-as-Fuck Rating Community
Community: 73h_3137 ("The Elite")
Description: ARR U TEH KEWL? WTF?
Unlike many of the elitist-too-cool-for-school
rating communities, this one is made up of serious
badasses who know sarcasm, satire and dead baby
jokes like no other.
Most memorable application question: "Describe
yourself in the form of a haiku." If you don't know
that a haiku is composed of three lines, 5 syllables,
7 syllables, 5 syllables, say goodbye, because The
Elite don't tolerate idiots.
My haiku:
I'm a pastry chef
Nobody fucks with the Tam
Now please spoon with me.
Rate of activity: Extremely active, as most mem
bers are internet junkies who enjoy reading The
Onion and starting flamewars and arguments with
virtual strangers.
Extra info: They are grammar/spelling Nazis, bal
anced out by their love of pirates and ninjas.
Memorable comments from members regarding
my application:" I will give you a yes only if you give
me a pastry, a back-walk, and sex. At the same time
(You're flexible enough)." — Captainhaddock
Member status: ACCEPTED
Community: theincrowd_ (The In Crowd)

Description: We're basically your typical snobby
"in" crowd, but better. Why are we better, you ask.
Because we are. Simple as that. Don't question us.
And don't bitch if you don't get in, its not our fault
you're a loser.
Rate of activity: Pretty active, receives regular ap
plications, approximately 3-5 daily.
Most memorable application question: "How did
you find out that Santa wasn't real?"
My answer "My kindergarten teacher sent our
Giristmas lists to our parents, so when I received
the much-coveted paddleball and book (Good
night, Moon) I asked for on Christmas morning, I
was convinced he was real. At least until I tore the
wrapping off. My five year old mind quickly de
duced that if elves really were making my present
in Santa's workshop that they wouldn't have done
free advertising for Kmart, (in the pre-Martha
Stewart era, anyway)."
Memorable comments: "Anything by Kevin
Smith, EVEN "Jersey Girl" which 1 just screened
in SF last night, I mean, J. Lo died early on in it. In
a perfect world...
1 CANNOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE!!
TI lATS WHY 1 NEED TO SAY IT IN CAPS!"
Member status: ACCEPTED

Community: the_cool_club (The Qx>l Qub)
Description: "I wouldn't touch you with a tampon.
What's cooler than being cool?
It's certainly not quoting overused Outkast lyrics,
that's for sure. Join this shit. No fat chicks."
Activity rate: "We're fucking dead because the ma
jority of you dumbfucks can't fill out a simple appli
cation that actually inspires some sort of creativity
and shows intelligence instead of how sc3n3 u r."
Most memorable application question: It doesn't
matter anymore, this community is dead.
Memorable comments: "I'd do you. ASIANS
ARE HOnTTTT. And you like Piebald!"
Member status: PERMANENT LIMBO, as the
community died shortly after I applied. Yeah, I
suck the fun out of everything, the way the Daily
and Intermission suck my life away.

Type 2:
The Shallow-As-Fuck
Rating Community
(no text required /
desired, just pictures)

Community: newnonuglies (New Nonuglies, NNU
for short), http://newnonuglies.livejournal.com..
Description: "This is a rating community. Our stan
dards are not low. We are not some petty ratings
community. So if you don't think you got what it
takes, you probably don't If you're not up for being
ridiculed and insulted then don't apply. We are dif
ferent though: We allow everyone to post com
ments (just don't vote unless you are accepted). We
allow you to say WHATEVER you want and we
allow you to re-apply after 24 hours if rejected.
Sound too good to be true? It isn't. We're new and
improved and always willing to change rules for the
benefit of the community. Keep in mind thus isn't a
refuge for ugly people just because you can com
ment without a stamp."
Activity rate: Extremely active, since anyone and
everyone can comment. The harshest rating commu
nity 1 have ever encountered, with comments like, "I
don't know how Jillemo is still here, she must've
made a deal with the make a wish foundation for her
face cancer, 'cause 1 still can't explain that."
Memorable application pictures:
Memorable comments: "OH MY GOD You look
just like WILLIAM HUNG from American Idol
in the first picture! I'd love you forever if you made
a video of you doing "She Bangs!" — Save_me
"Yes. I like your central asian sex slave look. It re
minds me of my favorite vaction spot of a train sta
tion full of children in Indonesia." — Characterflaw
"We have five of you." — Gav
My reply: "Wc l.ave plenty of pale scrawny white
guys too. Now to go www.alllooksame.com, bitch.
At least my eyes aren't squinty."
Member status: ACCEPTED, then kicked out
during vote-outs (I wasn't hot enough, just "cute
and little"). After reapplying, a fight broke out be
tween me and a girl who doesn't understand sar
casm very well (the transcript can be found at:
http://www.livejournal.com/community/newnonu
glies/647626.html
Then I was rejectedby the anime-loving-freak mod
erator, still receiving "yes" votes after the fact. Final
status: REJECTED (those filthy slutbuckets!).
Favorite members: Original_Copy, one of NNU's
moderators (http://original_copy.livejournal
.com): "Tell them I am a genius and plan on world
domination. And that I will accept nude pictures.

But not from guys! Be like, 'Travis is also a photog
rapher for Playboy and is looking for models. Big
boobs are a plus. And if they are pretty enough but
without big boobs. Playboy will buy their implants."'
Community: nonuglyemos (NonUglyEmos)
Description: "Shakin' hips and bustin' lips - the hot
emo kid community."
Activity rate: Sporadic activity, members perk up
when fresh meat applies. Otherwise, expect mem
ber's stamped posts to go uncommented on. Emo
kids are too busy crying about being unloved.
Application: Submit at least three photos and list
10 favorite emo bands. These days, I have no idea
what emo means anymore.
Memorable comments: "No, because you have a
boyfriend and are too sassy (like, you read your
older sister's issues of sassy) and you listen to okay
indie rock."—boyrobots (www.armcircles.com)
"I like the way you responded to people not to
mention you're one of maybe 3 cute asians I've
seen. That may sound super racist, but it shouldn't
and if it does, pardon me. But I'll give you a yes, you
may not have bands that I'm huge into but you list
ed death cab who I love and you had solid witty re
marks. Not to mention the cute factor.
So yep." — diedinhereyes
Member status: ACCEPTED, albeit reluctantly
by the asshole moderator, user name hardine, who
likes shitty hardcore bands, wears highwater jeans,
and needs a haircut like whoa.
Community: fuckinnerbeauty (Fuck Inner Beauty)
Description: "Time for you to stare. MUSIC,
BANDS, MOVIES, ETC. WERE PURPOSE

moderators and maintainers come up with month
ly themes for the stamped members to stay active
and have fun with. Averages 1 -2 applications every
two days.
Application: Submit a minimum of 3 pictures, a
maximum of 10 of face and body. A text-based ap
plication supplements the photos, allowing mem
bers to gauge your intelligence/personality.
Memorable comments: None, they're not that sar
castic/witty here, mostly nice kids ranging in age
from 15-22.
Member status: ACCEPTED
In conclusion, I felt like my mediocre IQdropped 10
points for every additional minute I spent on these Live
journal rating communities. I am very afraid for the fu
ture of America, as a ridiculous amount of high school
ers apply to these groups hoping to be accepted and
loved immediately by strangers on the Internet—but
they can't do algebra It frightens me that Paris Hilton's
vapid comments like "I don't know wliat 'generic'
means" began to make sense in the laiger context of the
world, relative to how many idiots are bom every day.
Fortunately, a few and sarcastic
people kept me amused, so it wasn't a complete loss.
Sometimes referred to as trolls, some intelligent inter
net junkies like to point out the obvious and wreak
havoc on shallow rating communities. I also have sev
eral long-distance stalkers who send me really good

mix cds through the mail.
Internet celebrity status
is fickle, but I'll take my fif
teen minutes of fame any
way I can get it - except by
posting nudes or scandalous
photographs like this:
