# Roxy: I just want sex!
## Is anyone really surprised?? 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
Anyone? ANYMF.N?
In the past few years, Roxy has ob
served a troubling phenomenon
prevalent on our dear campus, a hor
rific problem that threatens to disrupt
the basic rules and stereotypical no
tions upon which our sexual society
operates. What is this disturbing
trend, you wonder? There are a lot of
very horny women out there with no
one to satisfy them. Shocking but true,
I tell vou.

Take a friend of mine. No, really
TAKE HER, boys. She's horny. Ha.
But really, take my friend, we'll call
her Lilly. During finals week just last
•quarter, I-illy was a 5'2" ball of sexual
frustration who needed a little satis
faction, a small stress relief in the
midst of the library. So, she went to
her ex-something I friend / guy she
makes out with occasionally and tried
to jump him in the infamous stacks.
And what did he say?
"No, my sexy little ex-something
whom I occasionally make out with! I
will not do vou. I will not do vou in the

stacks. I will not do you on our backs.
I will not do you on the stair. I will not
do you anywhere. No, we should talk
about us."
Roxy says, "WTF, mate???" Are
the gender roles switching? Have
men become more sensitive than
women? And what's up with all of
the low libidos?
You might think that I am only re
ferring to the simpering singletons
out there, those of us who did not
enter into a glorified marriage fresh
man year. But no. Many of those gals
in happy, at least somewhat stable
twosomes are having trouble getting
some. Guys, is it something in the
water? I always thought that girls
were supposed to get sex whenever

we wanted it. Aren't we
supposed to be chased,
hunted down by muscu
lar, loin cloth wearing
hotties who grab us
from behind and throw
us down on the ground
and oh baby, oh baby,
oh baby, right there,
yeah, oh?!?!
Phew, sorry. Rox got
ahead of herself there.
Back to my point. When
did men start wanting to
"talk" and "define the
relationship" before
taking things to the mat
tress (or, in this case,
the bookshelf)?
It is sad to say, but

Roxy herself has expe
rienced this travesty firsthand in a re
lationship with a man who never
wanted morning sex. And who
doesn't want morning sex? Hot sex
that starts off when you're in a state
between sleep and wakefulness —
curled up in bed, eyes half-closed, you
reach over and start stroking your
partner's thigh — very slowly, one
thing leads to another. But no, time
after time, Roxy tried to incite a little
morning action and found herself bru
tally rebuffed.
Sadly, women have had to resort to
laughter to hide their pain. Last year,
Roxy wrote a comic strip. The Ad
ventures of Dildo Man and His In
trepid Partner, Cunnilingus Boy,
just to cheer her roommate up.
When the giant dildo signal ap
peared in the sky, Dildo Man would
take off in his vibrating dildo-mobile
in search of unsatisfied women. But
short of resorting to the frat party
scene, a real life Dildo Man can be
hard to find. My roommate's stuffed
kangaroo was receiving more sexual
satisfaction from Pooh Bear than she
was from her man.
As women feel the need to deem

phasize their sexuality, to act less fem
inine in order to be taken seriously
and play with the big boys, have men
gone the opposite route, becoming
more sensitive and picking up the
feminine slack? Has this just been a
natural male reaction to the evening
out of gender roles?
Now, to the guys reading this,
don't feel beaten down. I know I've
asked a lot of questions here, and
even Roxy doesn't know the an
swers. But she does know this. Ob
viously, women want equality and
opportunity. We want men to ac
knowledge our power and intelli
gence, especially at a place like
Stanford. However, at least a little
part of all of us needs to be chased
once and awhile, to be thrown down
by that loincloth-clad Trojan (espe
cially if that Trojan is Brad Pitt —
have you SEEN those new pre
views?). Women want to be wanted.
Women want sex just as much if not
more than men. It shouldn't be that
hard to come bv.

reach over and start stroking your
partner's thigh — very slowly, one
thing leads to another. But no, time
after time, Roxy tried to incite a little
morning action and found herself bru
tally rebuffed.
Sadly, women have had to resort to
laughter to hide their pain. Last year,
Roxy wrote a comic strip. The Ad
ventures of Dildo Man and His In
trepid Partner, Cunnilingus Boy,
just to cheer her roommate up.
When the giant dildo signal ap
peared in the sky, Dildo Man would
take off in his vibrating dildo-mobile
in search of unsatisfied women. But
short of resorting to the frat party
scene, a real life Dildo Man can be
hard to find. My roommate's stuffed
kangaroo was receiving more sexual
satisfaction from Pooh Bear than she
was from her man.
As women feel the need to deem

phasize their sexuality, to act less fem
inine in order to be taken seriously
and play with the big boys, have men
gone the opposite route, becoming
more sensitive and picking up the
feminine slack? Has this just been a
natural male reaction to the evening
out of gender roles?
Now, to the guys reading this,
don't feel beaten down. I know I've
asked a lot of questions here, and
even Roxy doesn't know the an
swers. But she does know this. Ob
viously, women want equality and
opportunity. We want men to ac
knowledge our power and intelli
gence, especially at a place like
Stanford. However, at least a little
part of all of us needs to be chased
once and awhile, to be thrown down
by that loincloth-clad Trojan (espe
cially if that Trojan is Brad Pitt —
have you SEEN those new pre
views?). Women want to be wanted.
Women want sex just as much if not
more than men. It shouldn't be that
hard to come bv.

Anyone? ANYMF.N?
In the past few years, Roxy has ob
served a troubling phenomenon
prevalent on our dear campus, a hor
rific problem that threatens to disrupt
the basic rules and stereotypical no
tions upon which our sexual society
operates. What is this disturbing
trend, you wonder? There are a lot of
very horny women out there with no
one to satisfy them. Shocking but true,
I tell vou.

Take a friend of mine. No, really
TAKE HER, boys. She's horny. Ha.
But really, take my friend, we'll call
her Lilly. During finals week just last
•quarter, I-illy was a 5'2" ball of sexual
frustration who needed a little satis
faction, a small stress relief in the
midst of the library. So, she went to
her ex-something I friend / guy she
makes out with occasionally and tried
to jump him in the infamous stacks.
And what did he say?
"No, my sexy little ex-something
whom I occasionally make out with! I
will not do vou. I will not do vou in the

stacks. I will not do you on our backs.
I will not do you on the stair. I will not
do you anywhere. No, we should talk
about us."
Roxy says, "WTF, mate???" Are
the gender roles switching? Have
men become more sensitive than
women? And what's up with all of
the low libidos?
You might think that I am only re
ferring to the simpering singletons
out there, those of us who did not
enter into a glorified marriage fresh
man year. But no. Many of those gals
in happy, at least somewhat stable
twosomes are having trouble getting
some. Guys, is it something in the
water? I always thought that girls
were supposed to get sex whenever

we wanted it. Aren't we
supposed to be chased,
hunted down by muscu
lar, loin cloth wearing
hotties who grab us
from behind and throw
us down on the ground
and oh baby, oh baby,
oh baby, right there,
yeah, oh?!?!
Phew, sorry. Rox got
ahead of herself there.
Back to my point. When
did men start wanting to
"talk" and "define the
relationship" before
taking things to the mat
tress (or, in this case,
the bookshelf)?
It is sad to say, but

Roxy herself has expe
rienced this travesty firsthand in a re
lationship with a man who never
wanted morning sex. And who
doesn't want morning sex? Hot sex
that starts off when you're in a state
between sleep and wakefulness —
curled up in bed, eyes half-closed, you
reach over and start stroking your
partner's thigh — very slowly, one
thing leads to another. But no, time
after time, Roxy tried to incite a little
morning action and found herself bru
tally rebuffed.
