Phi Kappa Psi will present the 15th annual
Battle of the Bands this Saturday at 9 p.m. in
Toyon Hall. This year, six groups — all of them
campus-based — will be competing for air time
on KZSU as well as prizes totaling over $ 1 ,(KK).
Organizers said expect 6(X) to 80() people are to
attend, so they are encouraging students to arrive
on time, promising free Jamba Juice toearly birds.
Battle organizer John Stockdale, a sopho
more, explained that the popularity of the event
stems from its size, since it is one of the largest par
ties on campus throughout the year.
"Most of the excitement has rolled over from
word of mouth over the past years," he said. "It's
all about the music."
The Battle of the Bands aims to support the
campus community in what is advertised as a
"showcase [for] the musical talent on campus in a
constructive, competitive forum."
Bands interested in participating auditioned
on Feb. 28, playing half-hour sets for organizers
Stockdale and junior James Huffman.
The event started in 1989 and was listed in the
2003-2004 Unofficial Guide to Stanford's top 10
events that should not be missed.
"The bands get to play for free, [so] it's a great
place for them to come," Stockdale said. "[We]
want to create a forum where everyone can kick
back and enjoy themselves."
This year's competitors include last year's Bat
tle winner — The Element — returning band
2ME9, and four new groups. Dopamine, MC

Lars, Redline and Mister Rockstar.
"The great thing about Battle is that it can
make a name for groups that haven't had much
exposure around campus," Stockdale said.
"[Some of the groups] have been around for
awhile and have fans around campus [who are|
excited to hear them play."
One such band. The Element, is also eager for
a chance to hear the other groups. They described
the Battle as "the best gig we'd ever played — it
was a hell of a party and a great opportunity to see
what Stanford has to offer."
The group consists of three sophomores —
David Baron, Ben Grant and Gabe Davis —
whose varying musical backgrounds brought
them together during their freshman year.
"After a certain amount of time, everyone re
alizes rock 'n' roll is the way to go" said Grant.
While most of the bands play some flavor of
rock. MC Lars is the only hip hop contestant. MC
Lars. Redline and The Element have all been in
cluded on the Stanford Soundtrack this year.
"[The groups] are not just the standard rock
band," said Stockdale. "They all have their
own sound."
With KZSU, the ASSU, Gordon Biersch and
other sponsors contributing to this year's Battle of
the Bands, over $5,000 of goods and services have
been provided, including door prizes, T-shirts and
prizes for the participating bands.
The bands will be rotating roughly every half
hour. At 12:35 a.m., the winner — selected by a
panel of KZSU staff and Phi — will take the stage
fora final performance.
