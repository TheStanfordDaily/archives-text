# Cal student dies in drinking game
## 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
A drinking game turned fatal
on the UC-Berkeley campus
last Friday for Steve Saucedo, a
21-year-old student who was
found dead in his apartment the
morning following the game.
Saucedo had been engaged in a
competitive drinking contest
with a few close friends and fell
asleep after consuming large
quantities of alcohol. A friend
phoned the authorities Friday
morning when he was unable to
wake Saucedo.
Drinking games are preva
lent on college campuses:
Beirut, quarters, chugging con
tests as well as the "power
hour," in which players drink a
shot of beer each minute. These
recreational drinking activities
are more common at smaller
parties, where the alcohol is
plentiful and the atmosphere is
more intimate.
According to a 1993 study
published by the journal "Psy
chological Reports," moderate

drinkers are at highest risk for
consuming too much alcohol
during these drinking contests
or games, as they are more like
ly to join in the competitive spir
it and quickly surpass their lim
its. People who drink on a more
constant basis, on the other
hand, are more likely to con
sume the same amount of alco
hol whether or not they partici
pate in the games.
At Stanford, University
health officials are well aware
that these types of games and
contests exist and have imple
mented strategies to curb binge
drinking. Ralph Castro, the al
cohol and drug prevention man
ager at Vaden Student Health
Center, described the many pre
vention programs designed to
educate students about the dan
gers of binge drinking.
"We have a targeted out
reach education program that
runs primarily in freshman res
idences, including a dorm
event called 'Catching the per
fect social zone buzz without
puking,' " Castro said. "We try

to dissect the drinking culture
at Stanford and challenge basic
assumptions about drinking,
such as the idea that the more
alcohol one consumes, the bet
ter the night will be."
The excessive consumption
of hard liquor is seen as one of
the more significant health
problems, Castro said, due to
the high percentage of pure al
cohol that can quickly make its
way into the bloodstream and
lead to fatal complications.
According to Castro, about
one-third of the Stanford popu
lation completely abstains from
alcohol and only about five to
seven percent of students would
be considered heavy drinkers.
In the recent past, there have
been no alcohol-related deaths
on campus, although a few stu
dents have come close. In 1998,
an intoxicated student fell from
the second floor of the now
nonexistent fraternity Phi Delta
Theta, and the fraternity's hous
ing was quickly revoked.
"I've definitely seen drinking
games taking place at Stanford,

with people having the intent of
drinking just to drink, as op
posed to socially drinking at a
party," said junior Emily
Lehrman. "But then again, I
don't really think there is a pres
sure to drink at Stanford. I guess
it depends on who your friends
are, but I've never been around
people who have pressured me
to consume alcohol."
The ASSU has also been
working to offer alcohol-free so
cial events through the program
"Absolute Fun," which has so
far hosted the White Plaza block
party during fall quarter and a
hypnotist event in the winter.
While drinking games are
ingrained in college culture,
Castro explained, "it is impor
tant to look at the motivations
behind the games. Often, they
are simply an excuse for peo
ple to interact with each other
in a structured way, but there
are other ways to do that.
After all, does anyone really
win in a drinking game, or is
the winner usually the one
who gets the sickest?"
