## Saving the children Student Campaign for Child Survival goes to D.C. 
### JENNIFER NUCKOLS 
While Stanford students
enjoy the fine weather and excit
ing classes of spring quarter,
they probably don't think about
the fact that seven million chil
dren die annually from entirely
preventable diseases. However,
for the 15 students who are
members of the Student Cam
paign for Child Survival (SCCS),
these issues of childhood health
and wellbeing are first and fore
most on their minds. The Stan
ford chapter of SCCS was found
ed in the fall of last year by
sophomores Regan Johnson and
Brain Bergmark.
"We are the only student advo
cacy group for international chil
dren's health," Johnson said.
Johnson began interested in the
group as a freshman at Yale Uni
versity, where the group was
founded in November of 2002. The
group's purpose is to raise aware
ness of child mortality issues and
to lobby Washington to give more
funding to groups such as
UNICEF and USAID.
"Hopefully all people care that
11 million children between the
ages of 0 and 5 die each year and

that at least 7 million of those
deaths are immediately pre
ventable with treatments and the
current infrastructure of develop
ing nations, if these programs were
fully funded," Johnson said.
Junior Alex Mainiero, a mem
ber of SCCS, expanded on the ob
jectives of the group.
"SCCS is the only student voice
in the country advocating for the
issues of child survival, so our
main goal is to reach out to stu
dents to educate and raise aware
ness about the issues. Many peo
ple are surprised when they find
out that only O.lpercent of the
U.S. budget goes to humanitarian
aid abroad, less than any other de
veloped country. As the wealthi
est nation in the world, I think that
this is unacceptable, especially in
light of the amount the United
States spends on defense. By help
ing children across the globe to
grow up healthy, we can ensure
not only better lives for them, but
a more stable world overall,"
Mainiero said.
"It's such a fundamental issue
to the future of the world. Morally
it's hard not to do something
about," Bergmark said.
College students across the

country with like-minded ideas
have founded chapters in 30 uni
versities in 25 states. But these
groups do not always have much
publicity or campus support.
"We want to become a better
known name on campus and want
more people to know about these
issues so that it spreads to other
campuses," Bergmark said.
SCCS participates in activism
for children both on and off cam
pus. Bergmark, Johnson and se
nior Rachael Dallin attended a na
tion-wide annual SCCS confer
ence at Georgetown University
from Feb. 27 to March 1. The trip
to the conference, funded partially
by grants from Global Justice, the
parent umbrella organization for
SCCS, and partially from personal
funds, gathered about 120 student
representatives from all the coun
try's chapters.
"Our annual conference is our
only real chance to gather as a
campaign and talk and think about
international children's health is
sues," Johnson said.
The conference consisted of
workshops, case studies, discus
sions, presentations and culminat
ed in an entire day of lobbying.
One of the driving forces behind

the lobbying is the fact that many
children could saved or cured rela
tively easily.
"Currently we have the tools
to prevent child deaths, but a lack
of political will has stopped us
from delivering those interven
tions to children who need them,"
Johnson said.
However, other political and
social issues complicate govern
ment and non-government ac
tion. Some of these complicating
factors include trade issues, IMF
and World Bank debt and access
to treatments.
The conference was such a pos
itive experience that Stanford
hopes to host a regional confer
ence next year with schools from
the Bay Area.
Prior to the conference, SCCS
representatives at their respective
campuses collected student-writ
ten postcards to their representa
tives and senators that expressed
their support for the funding of
child survival issues. The Stanford
chapter set up a table in White
Plaza and asked students to write
postcards, sign petitions and wear
armbands to show support for
SCCN activism. Stanford students
contributed approximately 200

postcards and
these were hand
delivered on the
lobbying day.
Lobbying day at
the conference, the
students met with
63 offices of sena
tors and represen
tatives, including
the offices of Ted
Stevens, Barbara
Boxer. Diane Fe
instein and Mitch
McConnell.
"Taking action at
the Capitol was by
far the most re
warding and excit
ing part of the con
ference for all of us.
We felt a sense of
accomplishment,
but also the feeling
that this is just
one more small
step toward ensur
ing that every child
can be healthy,"
Johnson said.
Though the group
had a positive expe
rience in Washing
ton, their struggle
to improve chil
dren's health glob
ally is far from over.
"I can't quantify
what impact we
had," Bergmark
said, "but the con
ference inspired
people who are
part of a group to
keep going."

"Taking action at
the Capitol was by

We felt a sense of
accomplishment,
but also the feeling
that this is just
one more small
step toward ensur
ing that every child
can be healthy,"
Johnson said.
Though the group
had a positive expe

"I can't quantify
what impact we

people who are
part of a group to
keep going."

While Stanford students
enjoy the fine weather and excit
ing classes of spring quarter,
they probably don't think about
the fact that seven million chil
dren die annually from entirely
preventable diseases. However,
for the 15 students who are
members of the Student Cam
paign for Child Survival (SCCS),
these issues of childhood health
and wellbeing are first and fore
most on their minds. The Stan
ford chapter of SCCS was found
ed in the fall of last year by
sophomores Regan Johnson and
Brain Bergmark.
"We are the only student advo
cacy group for international chil
dren's health," Johnson said.
Johnson began interested in the
group as a freshman at Yale Uni
versity, where the group was
founded in November of 2002. The
group's purpose is to raise aware
ness of child mortality issues and
to lobby Washington to give more
funding to groups such as
UNICEF and USAID.
"Hopefully all people care that
11 million children between the
ages of 0 and 5 die each year and

that at least 7 million of those
deaths are immediately pre
ventable with treatments and the
current infrastructure of develop
ing nations, if these programs were
fully funded," Johnson said.
Junior Alex Mainiero, a mem
ber of SCCS, expanded on the ob
jectives of the group.
"SCCS is the only student voice
in the country advocating for the
issues of child survival, so our
main goal is to reach out to stu
dents to educate and raise aware
ness about the issues. Many peo
ple are surprised when they find
out that only O.lpercent of the
U.S. budget goes to humanitarian
aid abroad, less than any other de
veloped country. As the wealthi
est nation in the world, I think that
this is unacceptable, especially in
light of the amount the United
States spends on defense. By help
ing children across the globe to
grow up healthy, we can ensure
not only better lives for them, but
a more stable world overall,"
Mainiero said.
"It's such a fundamental issue
to the future of the world. Morally
it's hard not to do something
about," Bergmark said.
College students across the

country with like-minded ideas
have founded chapters in 30 uni
versities in 25 states. But these
groups do not always have much
publicity or campus support.
"We want to become a better
known name on campus and want
more people to know about these
issues so that it spreads to other
campuses," Bergmark said.
SCCS participates in activism
for children both on and off cam
pus. Bergmark, Johnson and se
nior Rachael Dallin attended a na
tion-wide annual SCCS confer
ence at Georgetown University
from Feb. 27 to March 1. The trip
to the conference, funded partially
by grants from Global Justice, the
parent umbrella organization for
SCCS, and partially from personal
funds, gathered about 120 student
representatives from all the coun
try's chapters.
"Our annual conference is our
only real chance to gather as a
campaign and talk and think about
international children's health is
sues," Johnson said.
The conference consisted of
workshops, case studies, discus
sions, presentations and culminat
ed in an entire day of lobbying.
One of the driving forces behind

the lobbying is the fact that many
children could saved or cured rela
tively easily.
"Currently we have the tools
to prevent child deaths, but a lack
of political will has stopped us
from delivering those interven
tions to children who need them,"
Johnson said.
However, other political and
social issues complicate govern
ment and non-government ac
tion. Some of these complicating
factors include trade issues, IMF
and World Bank debt and access
to treatments.
The conference was such a pos
itive experience that Stanford
hopes to host a regional confer
ence next year with schools from
the Bay Area.
Prior to the conference, SCCS
representatives at their respective
campuses collected student-writ
ten postcards to their representa
tives and senators that expressed
their support for the funding of
child survival issues. The Stanford
chapter set up a table in White
Plaza and asked students to write
postcards, sign petitions and wear
armbands to show support for
SCCN activism. Stanford students
contributed approximately 200

postcards and
these were hand
delivered on the
lobbying day.
