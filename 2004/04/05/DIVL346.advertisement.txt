Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and
Must Help Run the World by Marie C. Wilson
Marie C. Wilson is cofounder and president of The White House Project and president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, for which she also co-created Take Our Daughters to Work Day.
She started the Collaborative Fund for Women's Economic Development and was a U.S. government delegate to the U.N.'s Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. Insightful
and inspiring, Closing the Leadership Gap is a call to action for the increased presence of women in powerful leadership positions in our country. A leading women's advocate and
cofounder of the White House Project, Marie C. Wilson argues that while our nation sits on a world spinning with crises from terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to a fragile
economy and corporate greed, half of its natural resources - women - have not been tapped for their uniquely valuable contribution to solving these problems that only they can provide.
Rich with historical context and supported by a wealth of current data and innovative research, this book explains chapter by chapter the leadership gap between women and men and
the deeply ingrained cultural factors that continue to create resistance to women at the top. It also explores the new insights and strategies women are using to leverage their power of
authority, ambition, ability, and authenticity - have been denied women and how they are claiming these vital qualities for themselves. Written with passion and documented with
lively behind-the-scenes stories from the trenches, Closing the Leadership Gap argues for women's leadership in all spheres and offers steps to get us there.

The Success of Open Source by Steven Weber
Much of the innovative programming thar powers the Internet, creates operating systems, and produces software is the result of "open source" code, that is, code that is freely
distributed - as opposed to being kept secret - by those who write it. Leaving source code open has generated some of the most sophisticated developments in computer
technology, including, most notably, Linux and Apache, which pose a significant challenge to Microsoft in the market place. As Steven Weber discusses, open source's success
in a highly competitive industry has subverted many assumptions about how businesses are run, and how intellectual products are created and protected. Weber argues that
the success of open source is nor a freakish exception to economic principles. The open source community is guided by standards, rules, decision making procedures,
and sanctioning mechanisms. Weber explains the political and economic dynamics of this mysterious but important market development.
