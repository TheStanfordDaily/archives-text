Creative Computing in the Humanities
http://traumwerk.stanfora.edu:34ss/CreativeComputing/Home
Mondays and Wednesdays 11.00 - 11.50 Building 1 (>O-127
with Michael Shanks and Joseph Adler
A graduate seminar open to undergraduates
How can digital technologies enable creative work in the humanities? This
course will focus on case studies in Anthropology, Classics, History,
Archaeology and the Arts, examine the processes of creativity they embody,
and then the relation of these to digital design and authorship. We will look at
hypertext and hypermedia, collaborative authoring, the use of databases, nar
rative, and rhetoric. Tools and techniques (hardware options and software
packages) will be introduced where appropriate. Support will be provided for
all skill levels, from beginner to geek - the emphasis is on creativity. The
course assignment will be to plan and implement your own individual or
group project.

Things - an introduction to material culture studies
http://traumwerk.stanford.edu:34ss/Design/Home
Mondays 1.15 to 3 - Building 160-127
First class 5 April
Join Barry Katz (Stanford Mechanical Engineering, California College of the
Arts, IDEO Design, Palo Alto) and Michael Shanks (Classics and Cultural and
Social Anthropology, and Stanford Archaeology Center) in a sustained inquiry
into the nature of things:
Where do things come from?
Why do humans have such an extraordinary reliance upon
artifacts of their own creation?
What do things mean, and How do things mean?
Drawing from a wide range of disciplines-from archaeology to information
theory and from economics to engineering, we will examine a diverse selec
tion of modern and ancient artifacts (from prehistoric flint tool to superson
ic aircraft) with a view to how they function in defining our individual and col
lective lives. In the end we will find that things may not be what they seem.
