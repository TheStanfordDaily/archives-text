# Husbands-Schwartz vie for ASSU
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ajani Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz are familiar with
the inner workings of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
Husbands, a junior, served on the Senate last year, and
helped develop the ASSU arts grant. Schwartz, a sopho
more, is currently the chair of the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee. Both candidates are also involved in a variety of stu
dent groups on campus. On their Web site (http://withy
ou.stanlbrd.edu/), they have outlined a program of reform
in areas such as diversity, student life and communications.
The Daily: Looking over your Web site, it looks like
you have a lot of issues that you would like to address.
If elected, how likely is it that we'll see serious changes
in all of these areas?

Ajani Husbands: ITie thing that
Alyssa and 1 worked hardest on
was finding real solutions to real
problems. I don't think that
there's anything in our platform
that couldn't be done if elected.
We've taken the things we have
already accomplished as stu
dent leaders, and used them to
put together new goals.
Alyssa Schwartz: Also, what

is unique about our campaign is that we're combining
both long-term goals and short-terms goals. Fora lot of
the issues, work has already started. We hope to touch on
everything we said we would do. And I think it's defi
nitely possible to make real progress on all of these issues.
TD: Are there any issues that you would put as a
top priority?
AS: For me, bringing in populations that have previously
been underrepresented, both in the larger Stanford commu
nity and in the ASSU, is really important. Freshmen, queer
students, students with disabilities, international students â€”
their voices aren't always as loud as other student popula
tions, and I think it's important to make an effort to bring
them into the ASSU and to work on issues important to them.
AH: Two of my bigger priorities are the publications com
munity and the arts community... For the arts commu
nity, I'd like to see a rotating gallery on campus. It would
be similar to the Art Affair on campus last week. With
publications, we should have common spaces to place
publications so we don't have to deal with door-to-door
distribution. Additionally, I have always been a big advo
cate for students of color.
TD: Can vou tell us about your motto, "With you. for you"?
