# Husbands-Schwartz vie for ASSU
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ajani Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz are familiar with
the inner workings of the ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
Husbands, a junior, served on the Senate last year, and
helped develop the ASSU arts grant. Schwartz, a sopho
more, is currently the chair of the Senate Advocacy Com
mittee. Both candidates are also involved in a variety of stu
dent groups on campus. On their Web site (http://withy
ou.stanlbrd.edu/), they have outlined a program of reform
in areas such as diversity, student life and communications.
The Daily: Looking over your Web site, it looks like
you have a lot of issues that you would like to address.
If elected, how likely is it that we'll see serious changes
in all of these areas?

Ajani Husbands: ITie thing that
Alyssa and 1 worked hardest on
was finding real solutions to real
problems. I don't think that
there's anything in our platform
that couldn't be done if elected.
We've taken the things we have
already accomplished as stu
dent leaders, and used them to
put together new goals.
Alyssa Schwartz: Also, what

is unique about our campaign is that we're combining
both long-term goals and short-terms goals. Fora lot of
the issues, work has already started. We hope to touch on
everything we said we would do. And I think it's defi
nitely possible to make real progress on all of these issues.
TD: Are there any issues that you would put as a
top priority?
AS: For me, bringing in populations that have previously
been underrepresented, both in the larger Stanford commu
nity and in the ASSU, is really important. Freshmen, queer
students, students with disabilities, international students —
their voices aren't always as loud as other student popula
tions, and I think it's important to make an effort to bring
them into the ASSU and to work on issues important to them.
AH: Two of my bigger priorities are the publications com
munity and the arts community... For the arts commu
nity, I'd like to see a rotating gallery on campus. It would
be similar to the Art Affair on campus last week. With
publications, we should have common spaces to place
publications so we don't have to deal with door-to-door
distribution. Additionally, I have always been a big advo
cate for students of color.
TD: Can vou tell us about your motto, "With you. for you"?


Ajani Husbands
How does that summarize your campaign?
AS: Over the past two years for me and three years
for Ajani. we have tried to work very closely with
students in the things that they are most concerned
about and for students as advocates. We've both
been on the Senate — I was the Senate Advocacy
Committee ("hair this year—so working for stu
dents is a priority. In the last month or so, we've
met with probably every major student group on
campus to find out what their interests are.

11): What about special fees? One of the solutions
you are proposing is lowering facilities costs to
groups, flow do you plan to go about doing this?
AS: In the ASSU constitution, if you receive stu
dent money, you ain't go iihead and charge for
events. A lot of groups are faced with costs of $ IXXX)
to $2,(XX) to rent a space like MemAud or Dinkel
spiel fora three hour concert. One of the things we
hope to do is lower the amount of money student
groups need to get by lowering the money they
need to pay. 'ITiis will be done by encouraging the
University to subsidize the cost of those buildings.
TD: Do you think the University would be
willing to do this?
AS: I think what the University is going to

find next year is that groups are not going to
be able to put on the kind of events that at
tract a lot of attention because they can't af
ford it.
TI): What are your tactics for winning
this election?
AH: One thing we have been doing is meet
ing with various student groups. We were at
the [Graduate Student Council's) last meet
ing and the (Asian American Students As
sociation] extravaganza, and we have plans
to meet at the next Black Student Union
meeting and the list goes on and on. We're
trying to get a feel of what students want,
what student centers want. In addition, one
of the more hard tactics is to flyer every
where and get the word out to individuals.

AS: We've been talking to students. We've
been toa number of dorms on campus. We have
pretty large grassroots organizing going on.
TI): What have your past leadership experi
ences brought to the campaign?
AH: I think the past leadership positions I have
held in many different student groups or cen
ters on campus have taught me how to utilize
resources and taught me that there are many
different avenues to follow other than the con
ventional. Sometimes it's best not to go through
the conventional routes. If you have connec
tions to other people then you can get things
done much faster, and people respect you be
cause you have worked with them in the past.
AS: Being deeply involved in the ASSU, there's

no better preparation. We've both been on Sen
ate, and I was an executive aid my freshman
year, so having worked with two consecutive ex
ecutive offices, we don't have to have such a long
preparation period. We've seen how it works.
TI): Does your campaign have a particularly
strong appeal with some groups?
AS: We are endorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition, so definitely students of color have the
feeling that we would be the best candidates. And
I think, unlike our opponents, we have made an ef
fort to reach out to the international students, the
queer students, the students with disabilities as well
as the Greek community, the arts community and
publications. We've talked to all of these groups
and we know where their issues tire and we know
where we Gin help them.
