### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Junior Joey Natoli is the current ASSU vice president
and the financial manager at Bob. A natural-horn politi
cian, Mr. Natoli enjoys studying economics, listening to
cheesy punk music and trying to be smooth with women.
1. In a recent 10 Random Questions interview I asked
Provost Greg Boardman whether he thought you were
responsible for the special-fees crisis. He seemed non-

committal. Have you been embezzling
from the ASSU?
No one's been able to prove it yet. As
long as that's the case, I'm happy.
2. If you could be any kind of animal,
which would it be?
Ummm, any kind of animal? A giraffe.
Because they emit a low moo. Accord
ing to the Singaporean zoo, at least.
3. Is ASSU vice president the end of

your career in public service, or are you just biding your
time fora surprise comeback?
When I'm a sixth-year senior I'll run again.
4. Who are you going to vote for in the ASSU elections?
Husbands / Schwartz.
5. They seem to have the best publicity.
That's good to hear.
6. You're the financial manager at Bob. Between that
and the ASSU, you control a lot of money. Do you ever
feel like Alan Greenspan?
Too often, just too often. You want to know a random
fact about Alan Greenspan? Did you know he went to
Juilliard in New York? He's a musician, apparently. But
anyway, the amount of money I have, it's absolute
power almost.
7. Have you ever been in a boy band? Joey Natoli sounds
kind of similar to Joey Fatone.
In high school I was experimenting, it was a short-term
thing... 1 have no musical talent whatsoever. I can't
keep rhythm. If you ever see me dance you'll realize that.
8. As the creator of the ASSU Book Service, you serve as
a mediator, facilitating the exchange of textbooks
amongst students. Does that make you a librarian?
Yeah, only one step better, 'cause the librarian al
ways charges you. I just hand out cash. I'm a librari
an, plus money.
9. If you were the president of the United States, what
would be your first act in office?
The first thing I would do would build a new student
union on Stanford campus.
10. That's it? Come on, you could bomb somebody.
I don't really care enough about anybody to bomb them.
I don't think I care about anything anymore.
11. But you've been so involved in the past. What arc you
going to do next year if you don't care about anything
anymore?
Last year at Bob there were these two guys who I never
saw do anything except drinking or watching TV. If next
year I could either be drinking or watching TV the entire
year, I'd be a happy, happy man.
12. Are you going to go to Exotic Erotic this year? If so,
what will you be wearing?
If Barrett Sheridan invites me, absolutely nothing.
