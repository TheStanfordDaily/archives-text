Vote no on Great Donation
ASSU elections are less than a
week away, and I still have mixed
feelings about the Great Donation.
While I am inspired by the thought of
such a display of unity and by the pos
sibility of substantially helping to for
ward a cause monetarily, I just don't
see how this is aiding the growth of
any Stanford students or even sub
stantially easing anyone's guilt as to
the bubble of luxury and stimulation
in which we live.
On one hand. I can imagine in a

couple of years voting with pride for
the charity I'd like to see the money
going to, feeling the weight of such a
symbolic gesture — what a wonderful
statement Stanford students are mak
ing to the world! But on the other hand,
what if the Great Donation is only sym
bolic for me? I won't see or hear or feel
the difference that our money is mak
ing. Perhaps we'll get to see a video or
read a report on what our money is
doing for others.
But simply giving money away to a
charity will never replace the amazing
difference that we Stanford students

can really see and feel for ourselves,
through the volunteer work and advo
cacy we do ourselves in any one of our
6(X) student groups.
And 1 think any extra money raised
by Stanford students should go to the
work that we do for our community,
our nation, and our planet. And so 1
urge everyone to vote No on the Great
Donation, and Yes to campus groups
that give students a direct role in mak
ing a difference.
