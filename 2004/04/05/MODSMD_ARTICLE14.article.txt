## Why every frosh should rush 
### KURT SCHWARZ 
I'm a senior now, hut I first entered
Stanford in the fall of 1 WO. That's not a
typo — I stopped out fora quick
decade after winter quarter my sopho
more year, then came back in Septem
ber 2002 for my junior year.
The reason I'm writing this is to tell
you how I went from being adamantly
anti-fraternity my freshman year to
adamantly pro-fraternity now, and
why I now believe that every single
freshman should go through the rush
process this spring. If I haven't com
pletely convinced you by the end of this
article, e-mail me and I'll give you your
six minutes back.
During my ten years off, I was a cop
in one of America's worst inner cities, I
was on the SWAT team, and I also
joined an Army Special Forces unit in
the Guard. As you might imagine, the
jobs that I held inspired a lot of cama
raderie. Working the 'hood, where po
lice officers were regularly shot at or
shot, and rarely a night went by without
us chasing or fighting someone, we re
lied on our fellow officers to keep us
alive — and that inspires strong bonds
beyond those of just passing friends.
On SWAT, we would execute
search warrants on suspects with as
sault rifles, suspects who had tried to
kill police officers, or other people with
violent backgrounds. When I entered a
room during a dynamic entry, I relied
on my wingman to take care of threats
in the uncovered zone. That sort of
trust is a bit more deeply seated in the
soul than the old fall-back-and-catch
me trust-building game.
In the Army, I spent 14 weeks in the
same room with the same 36 guys, and
we endured a lot of tough training that
makes my life now seem like life in a
luxury resort. My best friends from the
Army are now in training or in Iraq.
One just got back from being a scout
sniper with a recon platoon in the 82nd
Airborne. I just got a call from another
who's in Tikrit. working as a public af
fairs officer. If you think finals are
tough, try being an Army public affairs
officer in Saddam's hometown.
I can assure you, my priorities have
changed over the years, and I now feel
like my relationships with others — my
true friendships — are what are most
important to me. Being surrounded by
so much violence made me deeply ex
amine my core values. I would imagine
that, if you look at what really is most
rewarding in life, you might find that
valuing other human beings supersedes
whatever career milestones, accolades

or possessions you might accrue.
So, what does this have to do with
Stanford? Well, first, I love Stanford
like few others: There's a good chance
that I'm the happiest guy to be here.
That being said, the biggest criticism 1
hear about Stanford is its social life.
What do you feel the most important
thing is that you can take from your
time here? Your GPA? Membership
in an honors society?
I would submit to you that the most
valuable resource here is our fellow
students. If you come out of school
with several real, lasting friendships,
then I would count you as truly suc
cessful. I am continually in awe of all
the amazing things that Stanford stu
dents do; you might never again have
such a rich resource of really cool peo
ple from whom to learn.
I have no doubt that everyone here
is super intelligent, but I'm not quite as
certain that some are wise enough to
contemplate what they want to gain
from their Stanford experience. Get
good grades, but for Pete's sake don't
spend so much time working on stuff to
enhance your resume that you don't
spend time developing meaningful re
lationships with the people around
you. The "deathbed perspective"
means picturing yourself lying on your
deathbed, looking back and taking
stock. What will be most important to
you? I 'm guessing it will be your family
first, your close friends second and ev
erything else a distant third.
Now. if you buy my perspective that
your bonds with others are what is
most important in life, maybe you'll
understand why I'm so pro-fraternity.
As a freshman, I was firmly against fra
ternities because of all the stereotypes:
I didn't want to join a group of people
that engaged in silly hazing, disrespect
ed women, drank beer, partied a lot
and just generally lived shallower lives.
Also, I am very anti-elitist, and I
didn't like the idea that a group of
strangers would judge my social worth
and how "coo!" I was and that I would
get accepted or rejected based upon
how I acted in a couple of interactions
with fraternity members. Coming back
to school 10 years later, I knew from
the start that I wanted to join a frater
nity: I was already missing the cama
raderie from SWAT, the police and the
Army. When I joined my fraternity at
the end of the rush process last spring,
I instantly gained 50 new friends —
and what a group we have.
We have athletes and intellectuals,
class presidents, present leaders of stu
dent groups and future leaders in soci

ety, beer drinkers and teetotalers, busi
ness types and artist types, musicians
and philosophers, future lawyers and
future doctors. We have men from all
over the world; we have men who are
black, Asian. Latino, Indian and white.
We have Christians, agnostics, Bud
dhists, Sikhs and Jewish men; and we
even have a guy who was vice-mayor of
his town when he was 18.
The men are respectful toward
women, take care of their academics
before partying, have plenty of friends
outside the fraternity and, in my opin
ion, tend to lead deeper — not shallow
er — lives. 1 know that there are lots of
great guys in other fraternities who are
equally proud of their own groups.
In the sort of hectic, resume-build
ing, activity-laden, pre-professional
schedules most Stanford students keep.
I have a lot of concern that it becomes
difficult for people to build many mean
ingful relationships (see "The Organi
zation Kid" from the Atlantic April
2001 fora great discussion of this).
Hitting a loud frat party fora couple
of hours on Saturday night doesn't
count as a social life to me. It can be fun,
but it's not the same as making real
friends. People tend to make some
close friendships freshman year and
then get caught up in being liber-stu
dents. Being in a fraternity enforces
balance in students' lives. It ensures
that you're nurturing what's most im
portant while you're nurturing your fu
ture career.
Even if (shudder) your career is
what's most important to you, I still
think joining a fraternity is the best
move you can make. I just got my
dream job in management consulting
next year largely because my participa
tion in a fraternity event opened my
eyes to the possibility. After I graduate,
I'll have a strong network of talented
men who will be both friends and pro
fessional contacts.
Now, please don't see this as an at
tack on all those of you who are not in a
fraternity or feel like I'm telling you that
you don't have friends or balanced lives.
I just believe that all freshmen should at
least go through the rush process to see if
they're interested in what fraternity (or
sorority) life has to offer. If they decide at
the end of the process they're not inter
ested, that's great — I respect them for
making an educated decision.

you how I went from being adamantly
anti-fraternity my freshman year to
adamantly pro-fraternity now, and
why I now believe that every single
freshman should go through the rush
process this spring. If I haven't com
pletely convinced you by the end of this
article, e-mail me and I'll give you your
six minutes back.
During my ten years off, I was a cop
in one of America's worst inner cities, I
was on the SWAT team, and I also
joined an Army Special Forces unit in
the Guard. As you might imagine, the
jobs that I held inspired a lot of cama
raderie. Working the 'hood, where po
lice officers were regularly shot at or
shot, and rarely a night went by without
us chasing or fighting someone, we re
lied on our fellow officers to keep us
alive — and that inspires strong bonds
beyond those of just passing friends.
On SWAT, we would execute
search warrants on suspects with as
sault rifles, suspects who had tried to
kill police officers, or other people with
violent backgrounds. When I entered a
room during a dynamic entry, I relied
on my wingman to take care of threats
in the uncovered zone. That sort of
trust is a bit more deeply seated in the
soul than the old fall-back-and-catch
me trust-building game.
In the Army, I spent 14 weeks in the
same room with the same 36 guys, and
we endured a lot of tough training that
makes my life now seem like life in a
luxury resort. My best friends from the
Army are now in training or in Iraq.
One just got back from being a scout
sniper with a recon platoon in the 82nd
Airborne. I just got a call from another
who's in Tikrit. working as a public af
fairs officer. If you think finals are
tough, try being an Army public affairs
officer in Saddam's hometown.
I can assure you, my priorities have
changed over the years, and I now feel
like my relationships with others — my
true friendships — are what are most
important to me. Being surrounded by
so much violence made me deeply ex
amine my core values. I would imagine
that, if you look at what really is most
rewarding in life, you might find that
valuing other human beings supersedes
whatever career milestones, accolades

or possessions you might accrue.
So, what does this have to do with
Stanford? Well, first, I love Stanford
like few others: There's a good chance
that I'm the happiest guy to be here.
That being said, the biggest criticism 1
hear about Stanford is its social life.
What do you feel the most important
thing is that you can take from your
time here? Your GPA? Membership
in an honors society?
I would submit to you that the most
valuable resource here is our fellow
students. If you come out of school
with several real, lasting friendships,
then I would count you as truly suc
cessful. I am continually in awe of all
the amazing things that Stanford stu
dents do; you might never again have
such a rich resource of really cool peo
ple from whom to learn.
I have no doubt that everyone here
is super intelligent, but I'm not quite as
certain that some are wise enough to
contemplate what they want to gain
from their Stanford experience. Get
good grades, but for Pete's sake don't
spend so much time working on stuff to
enhance your resume that you don't
spend time developing meaningful re
lationships with the people around
you. The "deathbed perspective"
means picturing yourself lying on your
deathbed, looking back and taking
stock. What will be most important to
you? I 'm guessing it will be your family
first, your close friends second and ev
erything else a distant third.
Now. if you buy my perspective that
your bonds with others are what is
most important in life, maybe you'll
understand why I'm so pro-fraternity.
As a freshman, I was firmly against fra
ternities because of all the stereotypes:
I didn't want to join a group of people
that engaged in silly hazing, disrespect
ed women, drank beer, partied a lot
and just generally lived shallower lives.
Also, I am very anti-elitist, and I
didn't like the idea that a group of
strangers would judge my social worth
and how "coo!" I was and that I would
get accepted or rejected based upon
how I acted in a couple of interactions
with fraternity members. Coming back
to school 10 years later, I knew from
the start that I wanted to join a frater
nity: I was already missing the cama
raderie from SWAT, the police and the
Army. When I joined my fraternity at
the end of the rush process last spring,
I instantly gained 50 new friends —
and what a group we have.
We have athletes and intellectuals,
class presidents, present leaders of stu
dent groups and future leaders in soci

ety, beer drinkers and teetotalers, busi
ness types and artist types, musicians
and philosophers, future lawyers and
future doctors. We have men from all
over the world; we have men who are
black, Asian. Latino, Indian and white.
We have Christians, agnostics, Bud
dhists, Sikhs and Jewish men; and we
even have a guy who was vice-mayor of
his town when he was 18.
The men are respectful toward
women, take care of their academics
before partying, have plenty of friends
outside the fraternity and, in my opin
ion, tend to lead deeper — not shallow
er — lives. 1 know that there are lots of
great guys in other fraternities who are
equally proud of their own groups.
In the sort of hectic, resume-build
ing, activity-laden, pre-professional
schedules most Stanford students keep.
I have a lot of concern that it becomes
difficult for people to build many mean
ingful relationships (see "The Organi
zation Kid" from the Atlantic April
2001 fora great discussion of this).
Hitting a loud frat party fora couple
of hours on Saturday night doesn't
count as a social life to me. It can be fun,
but it's not the same as making real
friends. People tend to make some
close friendships freshman year and
then get caught up in being liber-stu
dents. Being in a fraternity enforces
balance in students' lives. It ensures
that you're nurturing what's most im
portant while you're nurturing your fu
ture career.
Even if (shudder) your career is
what's most important to you, I still
think joining a fraternity is the best
move you can make. I just got my
dream job in management consulting
next year largely because my participa
tion in a fraternity event opened my
eyes to the possibility. After I graduate,
I'll have a strong network of talented
men who will be both friends and pro
fessional contacts.
Now, please don't see this as an at
tack on all those of you who are not in a
fraternity or feel like I'm telling you that
you don't have friends or balanced lives.
I just believe that all freshmen should at
least go through the rush process to see if
they're interested in what fraternity (or
sorority) life has to offer. If they decide at
the end of the process they're not inter
ested, that's great — I respect them for
making an educated decision.
