## First FroSoCo, now 'PoCo' 
### 
Can I tell you a secret? I see
dead people. OK, that's a
lie. But I did live in FroSo-
Co my freshman year.
And as such, I have had special rea
son to pay attention to the response
to the new Potter College — the
"programmatic cousin" of the
Freshman / Sophomore College —
coming soon to a Sterling Quad not
so-near you.
The Daily solicited both sides of stu
dent reaction to last week's announce
ment, which were basically either:
1) Potter College is God. Let us
praise the creation of what is sure to
be a mecca of community and social
vibrancy; or
2) Potter College is an insidious
evil force, and once it comes into
being I am going to build a fence
around Sterling Quad to make sure
the evil cooties don't escape.
1 would boldly posit that neither
of these positions is entirely accurate
or fair. The interesting commonali
ty, however, is that both sides of the
debate focus on the hypothetical so
cial life of what is meant to be an aca
demic theme dorm, of sorts.
The same is true in discussions of
FroSoCo. Those who have enjoyed
living in the 'Fro generally emphasize
its community, while those outside
cringe at what they perceive as a bas
tion of social ineptitude. The much
touted faculty talks, research hook
ups and academic programming are
absent from campus discussions.
Strange coincidence? I think not.
Here's why:
FroSoCo's endowed purpose is to
foster the "broad intellectual explo
ration of the liberal arts and sci
ences" through optional academic,
social and other programming that is
absent in other dorms. It is this as
pect of the 'Fro — along with its em
phasis on community — that is mar
keted to incoming freshmen when
they are choosing their housing.
Weary of the anti-intellectual chains
of high school, eager froshies-to-be
see FroSoCo as an enchanted won
derland where neither work nor play
are taboo.
Fast-forward to those oh-so-fun
couple of weeks before the Draw.
Now the criteria for housing deci
sion-making have changed from ide
alist visions of intellectual Utopia to
concerns about the appropriate so
cial fit. As 'Fro freshmen debate the
pros and cons of spending a second
year on the West Side, what hangs
heavy on their minds are not the

benefits of being able to attend
Dean's Dinners, but whether the so-

cial environment
in FroSoCo is
something they
want to relive.
Understand
ing this distinc
tion is important
for evaluating
how successful
FroSoCo, cur
rently in its fifth
year, has been.

Many FroSoCo alums will describe
the College as a nearly unqualified
success — and such claims aren't en
tirely groundless, despite the skepti
cism of outsiders. At least half of
FroSoCo's freshmen choose to stay
on fora second term: my year, fewer
than 20 of the approximately 1 (K)
freshmen chose to draw out.
But it's also necessary to under
stand in what ways FroSoCo has been
successful, and in what ways it has
been less so. Here's where our "intel
lectual Utopia" versus "social fit" di
chotomy comes in. FroSoCo has cer
tainly been successful at creating a
stable social community for students
who aren't looking to dabble in every
corner of campus before they gradu
ate. This is another one of FroSoCo's
marketing points, and descriptions of
the College note that FroSoCo "may
be attractive to entering students who
prefer more long-term stability in
their living arrangements."
The consequence of this is that
FroSoCo ultimately creates an eso
teric social community that is fulfill
ing for many students, but certainly is
not for everyone (though in fairness
the same could be said of raucous all
freshmen environments like Bran
ner). Those who en joy it stay — some
through staff positions for even three
or four years — and those who want
to try something else leave.
The flip side, however, is that the
particular social nature of FroSoCo
runs the risk of undermining its the
matic mission, or at least relegating it
to secondary importance. This is not
to say that those who choose to stay
in FroSoCo don't take advantage of
its extra programming and funding.
But in the long run. what FroSo-
Co fosters is not a community of dif
ferent students who share an interest
in pursuing "the life of the mind" in
a residential setting, but rather a sta
ble, unique social community. This
social bond becomes the dorm's
dominant feature.

Some who may have liked the
dorm's intellectual mission may
choose to leave because they were
looking for different social pastures
or found the intellectual character of
the dorm underwhelming. Some in
different to the dorm's thematic
goals may stay because they particu
larly enjoy the social environment.
This doesn't mean FroSoCo has
not been a success — it just may not
be a success in the way it was origi
nally intended to be. As FroSoCo
Dean John Bravman told The Daily
in ah interview on Potter College,
"The degree of sociability within a
dorm is a reflection of the students
there, not the programmatic goals of
a particular house."
With FroSoCo, though, for what
ever reason — location, lack of
turnover, the alignment of the stars
— people answer the enduring ques
tion "should I stay or should I go?"
based on the sociability variable
rather than the mission of the dorm.
Any way you cut it, this can be prob
lematic fora dorm that is supposed
to be defined by its thematic aims.
Considering the experience of
FroSoCo is useful in thinking about
making Potter College work next
fall. Concerns from those for whom
the 'Fro is foreign say they think Pot
ter will just turn into a shelter for ex-
FroSoCoans and will embody Social
Death. This fixation on how the
dorm will function socially may spell
trouble for its goals. Will kids draw
in because they are interested in
sharing their research with others, or
will they draw in because they are
looking fora particular social envi
ronment?
Admittedly, the goals of Potter
College — or shall we say PoCo —
and FroSoCo are fundamentally dif
ferent in many ways, so maybe this
comparison is misleading. But as
Sterling Quad gradually becomes
College-icized, moving beyond the
basic "FroSoCo rocks" and "FroSo-
Co sucks" dialogue would go a long
way toward honestly assessing how
these young programs are meeting
their academic goals, and how the
social character they take on affects
their ability to do so.
Hell, if they're taking even more
two-room doubles out of the Draw,
it seems worth the time.
