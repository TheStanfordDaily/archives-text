# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## Spring break with Sting 
### 
Tijuana: the only place 1 know
that has fewer laws than
Nevada. According to leg
end, you can buy anything
there, do anything you want and are
surrounded by millions of beautiful
college students, all wearing som
breros. These are the myths at least,
and 1 felt it was my duty to go there and
expose the truth.
My friends and I chose to visit this
"hot" locale during our spring break.
These are our stories ...
First of all, we were not there to get
smashed. That perhaps was our first
mistake. We foolishly wanted to in
dulge in the culture, remember the
food and try to take in all that Mexico
had to offer.
For most college students, that
sounds like lunacy. After all, most
get their impressions of Mexico from
MTV's "Spring Break" or that cine
matic gem "The Real Cancun." By
these depictions, for two weeks in
spring. Mexico is completely taken
over by beautiful, drunk girls named
"Sandy." In order to enter Mexico,
you seemingly must have a blood al
cohol level of .9 and must be willing
to take your clothes off fot
Monopoly money.
What's worse, the government ex
periences a two-week hiatus in which
Carson Daly and Pauly Shore are ele
vated to the ranks of gods. For most,
this is paradise. For intellectual snobs
like me. this is hell.
Despite what one might expect, my
friends and I had a great time, avoided
the evil reign of Carson and had fun
stories along the way. Part of our suc

cess was due to the fact that we visited
not only TJ. but also several surround
ing towns.
One of the towns we stumbled on is
called Rosarito. We stopped there be
cause we heard there was a good

beach, and a friend
wanted to see the
local mission.
An order of
Franciscan
monks founded a
mission in Rosar
ito in 1767 with a
single holy pur
pose in mind: "To
make sure Ameri-

can college students have one hell
of a good time!" We could see the
Franciscan passion and culture in
every nook of the town, from the
Papas and Beer to the Boom Boom
Night Club. Sure, the place might
resemble a decrepit theme park,
but that was all part of the
mission's charter.
The modern-day preachers —
clad in traditional Hawaiian shirts
and divine "Corona Extra" hats —
use the clubs' PA systems to give
such inspiring sermons as: "OK, you
over there, yeah, you dance with
those girls, ok, everyone having good
time now?!" So endowed with the
holy spirit, they sometimes pass out
half way through.
Well, Rosarito may have been as
subtle as "The Passion of the Christ," but
it had its upside: It didn't have Carson.
It is unfortunate that Rosarito and
Tijuana are pretty much American
ized. They cater to an American tourist

crowd, and it permeates the entire city.
Just look at some of the actual English
language signs we saw there:
"If surprised drinking alcohol can
be prosecuted." (Officer, I swear, I saw
you sneaking up on me.)
Or how about: "Only children
under 6 can ride bikes or skate
boards." (They're trying to discourage
grandpa from pedaling around on his
training-wheeled Huffy.)
And my favorite: "Seals or sea lions
may just be sting laying on the beach."
I know the former Police singer has re
ally let himself go, but you wouldn't
think people would need a public no
tice in order to tell him apart from a
marine mammal.
The fact that they are mention
ing old, fat British musical artists
in their signs just demonstrates
how thoroughly Mexican tradi
tions have been trampled in the
border towns. I saw Mexican peo
ple push aside, or at least distort,
their traditions for American
tourists, and as an American col
lege student, I guess I feel partial
ly responsible. Sure, tourism pro
vides jobs, but it seems like the in
habitants of these towns are selling
out their culture.
I guess you don't really appreciate
things like that until you visit a place,
and see how much a drunk girl named
"Sandy" and an obese ex-Police singer
have hurt a nation.
