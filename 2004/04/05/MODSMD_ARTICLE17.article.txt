## Where did Georgia Tech come from? 
### 
Georgia Tech-UConn. Wait, Georgia Tech-
UConn? Only in the NCAA Tournament,
which left the cream of the crop strewn
along the Road to the Final Four — a one
lane road with plenty of blind corners, unlit tunnels
and other manmade disasters, one of which has to he
human wrecking ball Emeka Okafor.
Everyone and their uncle picked UConn to make
it at least as far as the Elite Eight, so they're not a
surprise. Heck, 1 would've picked them to win it all if
I hadn't decided to give Stanford a chance to take
care of business in my bracket this year.
But Georgia Tech? 1 know multiple people who
had them in the championship, and all i can say is,
I'm impressed. I had them bowing out in the Elite
Eight to — yikes — Kentucky.
So, clearly you're not here to listen to Mark talk
about his busted bracket. I'm sure you have one of
your own (who on this Cardinal campus doesn't.

other than the Benedict Arnold
who's about to win your pool?).
We are here to talk about,
though, the ingredients for Final
Four success.
Namely, explosive guard play
and a big, inexplicably effective
big man.
Enter UConn, of course, with
Ben Gordon and Rashad Ander
son in the backcourt and all-ev
erything Emeka Okafor dominat
ing the paint.

But, even more so, enter Georgia Tech, because
their success was more unexpected. They've got B.J.
Elder. Jarrett Jack. Marvin Lewis and Saturday hero
Will Bynum in the backcourt. In other words: more
game-breaking guards than should be legal. But
who's the big man? Oh, who is that big man?
He's 7-foot-1, he has a curly, blazing red mop
top that probably makes Pacific-Northwest hob
bits Luke Ridnour, Dan Dickau and Luke Jack
son jealous.
He has an easy-to-remember, hard-to-spell
last name, and he went to a high school called
Lake Ginninderra — which is in Australia, just
for good measure.
His name, as you might have guessed, is Luke
Schenscher (does anyone know a basketball-playing
Luke without a hobbit haircut? Get back to me on
this), and he dropped 19 points and 12 boards —
both game-highs — against Oklahoma State on Sat
urday, while shooting 9-of-13 from the floor.
As you learned last week, the Cowboys were my
sentimental pick to win it all, and as you have
learned this week, I found a way to write about them
even after they lost, even if it took me 300 words to
set it up.
You see, Georgia Tech out-Cowboyed Okla
homa State on Saturday. They were the team that
more resembled Stillwater's famed 1995 Final Four
outfit. That team had a big man perhaps even more
unusual than Schenscher — none other than
Bryant Reeves, the 1995 Big Eight Player of the
Year (21.5 points per game, 9.5 rebounds per
game). When a guy named Byron Houston nick
names you Big Country, it can only be a recipe for
success. Especially when your sidekick is the allit
erative Randy Rutherford.
Of course, the Cowboys fell in the national semi
finals then just as they did now, but not because of R
and-R, who scored 40 of Oklahoma State's 61 points
and had the game tied at halftime. Reeves in partic
ular was dominant, shooting 8-of-16 from the floor
and 9-of-9 from the line for 25 points.
This year's Cowboys had the guard, John Lucas,
who did his part by hitting a game-tying three in the
last minute. But they lacked a goofy big man on the
court. Ivan McFarlin is 6-foot-8 and an incredible
athlete; you can't win Final Four games with a guy
like that! The Cowboys should've thrown 7-foot-2,
300-pound South African oak tree Frans Steyn out
there just for good karma; Bynum never could've
driven all the way around such a large man.
Rutherford never made it to the NBA, and
Bynum probably won't fare much better, but the
world treats you better when you're seven feet tall,
as Schenscher will find out. I absolutely cannot wait
to see this guy come up big for 10 points and six re
bounds in 22 NBA minutes per game. He is abso
lutely going to kick Dan Gadzuric's ass.
At this juncture, it might be appropriate to re
member the pro career of Big Country, who man
aged to play six pro seasons before succumbing to a
variety of size-related ailments. Selected sixth over
all. his best season was his third one. in which he av
eraged 16.3 points, 7.9 points, 2.1 assists and 1.1
blocks, while shooting 52.3 percent from the field
and 70.6 percent from the line.
More than that, though, his game was a thing of
beauty. Watching a 7-foot, 300-plus-pound man
with a patchy flat-top and pasty white skin execute
the world's slowest turnaround jumper — and hit
nothing but net with an impossibly soft touch — is
what basketball is all about. That and scrappy little
guys like Bynum, who refuse to succumb to the cult
of height.
In other words. Georgia Tech has the Final Four
formula down pat. Crazy big guy who's better than
he looks and scrappy little guys who take turns over
performing despite size limitations.
Of course, this doesn't mean the more-talented
Huskies won't blow them out by 20 tonight. It just
means I'm going to remember them and applaud
them for embodying what March is all about. Guys
like Okafor were born to win, and who can deny that
they deserve it? But guys like Bynum, Lewis and
Schenscher make for much better stories.
Let's hope that they make for an even better story
after tonight.
