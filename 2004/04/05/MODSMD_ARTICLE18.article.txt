# Card loses heartbreaker to UCLA
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Somebody finally figured out a way to win
a game against Stanford: tire out the bullpen
and force coach Mark Marquess to reach
deep into his young pitching staff for another
arm.
The Cardinal took two of three games
over the weekend from LJCLA but lost 6-5
Sunday when freshman reliever Jeff Stimp
son gave up his first career earned run on a
walk-off homer in the bottom of the ninth.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess probably
didn't have his best option out of the bullpen,
David O'Hagan, available Sunday because
O'Hagan pitched four innings the previous
day and picked up the win Stanford's 15-13
victory.
In the big picture, however, the Cardinal
(23-4,2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) are off to a
blazing start. Had they won yesterday, Stan
ford would have been only three games away
from tying the best 30-game start in school
history, set by the 1982 team (26-3-1).
"This shows us we aren't invincible," se
nior third baseman Jonny Ash said. "Teams
can come back on us and make it a game. We
need to be more aggressive."
Added sophomore first baseman John
Mayberry, Jr.: "We've been getting used to
winning around here, but we haven't become

complacent."
Stanford had stretched its lead to 5-3 when
Mayberiy, Jr. doubled home Sam Fuld in the
seventh. The score remained the same until
the bottom of the eighth, when the Bruins
tied the score on a Brandon Averill two-run
home-run off starter Jeff Gilmore. Gilmore,
who had allowed only five UCLA hits the en
tire game until the eighth, was removed after
allowing a third consecutive hit in the inning.
Stimpson came on to eventually retire the
side, including striking out Bruins catcher
Chris Denove with the go-ahead run on third.
Stanford had a chance to go ahead in the
ninth when Ash advanced to second after
Mayberry, Jr. drew a one-out walk. But
Danny Putnam struck out and Ash was
thrown out when Marquess sent him on a 3-
and-2 pitch.
Stimpson had been effective in the eighth,
so that's presumably why Marquess elected
to stay with his young right-hander.
Stimpson threw only one pitch to ninth
place hitter Preston Griffin, and just like that
his 12 and two-thirds career innings scoreless
streak was history. So was Stanford's season
high eight-game winning streak.
Senior outfielder Brian Hall extended his
hit streak to a career-high 12 games with two
singles and Ash's two hits gave him 10-ganie

The UCLA bench empties after Bruin third baseman Preston Griffin connected on a walkoff homer over the left field fence in the bottom of the ninth inning. Griffin's home
run lifted UCLA to a o-5 victory over No. 1 Stanford, snapping the team's eight-game winning streak.
