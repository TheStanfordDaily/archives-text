# Card loses heartbreaker to UCLA
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Somebody finally figured out a way to win
a game against Stanford: tire out the bullpen
and force coach Mark Marquess to reach
deep into his young pitching staff for another
arm.
The Cardinal took two of three games
over the weekend from LJCLA but lost 6-5
Sunday when freshman reliever Jeff Stimp
son gave up his first career earned run on a
walk-off homer in the bottom of the ninth.
Stanford coach Mark Marquess probably
didn't have his best option out of the bullpen,
David O'Hagan, available Sunday because
O'Hagan pitched four innings the previous
day and picked up the win Stanford's 15-13
victory.
In the big picture, however, the Cardinal
(23-4,2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) are off to a
blazing start. Had they won yesterday, Stan
ford would have been only three games away
from tying the best 30-game start in school
history, set by the 1982 team (26-3-1).
"This shows us we aren't invincible," se
nior third baseman Jonny Ash said. "Teams
can come back on us and make it a game. We
need to be more aggressive."
Added sophomore first baseman John
Mayberry, Jr.: "We've been getting used to
winning around here, but we haven't become

complacent."
Stanford had stretched its lead to 5-3 when
Mayberiy, Jr. doubled home Sam Fuld in the
seventh. The score remained the same until
the bottom of the eighth, when the Bruins
tied the score on a Brandon Averill two-run
home-run off starter Jeff Gilmore. Gilmore,
who had allowed only five UCLA hits the en
tire game until the eighth, was removed after
allowing a third consecutive hit in the inning.
Stimpson came on to eventually retire the
side, including striking out Bruins catcher
Chris Denove with the go-ahead run on third.
Stanford had a chance to go ahead in the
ninth when Ash advanced to second after
Mayberry, Jr. drew a one-out walk. But
Danny Putnam struck out and Ash was
thrown out when Marquess sent him on a 3-
and-2 pitch.
Stimpson had been effective in the eighth,
so that's presumably why Marquess elected
to stay with his young right-hander.
Stimpson threw only one pitch to ninth
place hitter Preston Griffin, and just like that
his 12 and two-thirds career innings scoreless
streak was history. So was Stanford's season
high eight-game winning streak.
Senior outfielder Brian Hall extended his
hit streak to a career-high 12 games with two
singles and Ash's two hits gave him 10-ganie

The UCLA bench empties after Bruin third baseman Preston Griffin connected on a walkoff homer over the left field fence in the bottom of the ninth inning. Griffin's home
run lifted UCLA to a o-5 victory over No. 1 Stanford, snapping the team's eight-game winning streak.
hitting streak of his own. Donny Lucy
also homered for the Cardinal.
Saturday's game had plenty of
dingers, too. The two teams combined
for 28 runs and eight home-runs and
provided a game full of drama.
Stanford jumped ahead to a 11-2
lead after an eight-run fourth keyed by
a two-run triple by Ryan Seawell, a
two-run triple by Fuld and a three-run
homer to center by Putnam.
But the Bruins chipped away at the
lead over the next few innings and
eventually pulled even when Jarrad

Page hit a towering three-run home
run in the eighth.
Stanford could have lost all mo
mentum and folded after blowing the
nine-run lead, but instead looked to
one of its most clutch hitters fora little
redemption.
Ash had already hit one homer in
the seventh, and stepped up to the plate
in the ninth with pinch-runner Jim
Rapoport on third with one-out.
The Bruins brought in hard
throwing reliever Adam Simon,
and Ash knew exactly what to look
for-a fastball.
He guessed right on the first pitch
and belted it over the fence for the go
ahead and what turned out to be the
game-winning hit. It was a fitting way

to cap the first four-hit day of his career.
"It seems every time I've hit a home
run I've been concentrating," he said.
"I just tried to drive it somewhere."
O'Hagan, who had the worst outing
of his season in giving up five hits and
five runs in four innings, still managed
to pitch a flawless ninth for the victory.
On Friday, Stanford got pitching
from a familiar source and hitting
from a less likely area in an 11-4 win
over the Bruins. Ace Mark Ro
manczuk (6-1) scattered ten hits over
a season-high eight innings with a sea
son-high 10 strikeouts.
But the more unlikely production
came off the bat of sophomore short
stop Chris Minaker, who had his first
career home-nan in the Cardinal's six

run second inning and a knocked in a
career-high four runs.
Minaker seems for the moment to
have established himself as the starting
shortstop ahead of Chris Lewis and
Adam Sorgi since he has started Stan
ford's last five games.
"I just wanted to be ready for my
opportunities," he said.
Stanford has scored twice as many
runs as its opponents this season (240 to
117) and has scored in double figures in
12 of 27 games.
Stanford travels to Corvallis fora
three-game series with Oregon State
beginning Thursday. The Cardinal will
next return home April 13th when
they host Santa Clara in a non-confer
ence game.
