# Fuld finds his stroke
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
It's always only a matter of time
before Stanford senior centerfielder
Sam Fuld finds his stroke and gets into
a groove at the plate. Unfortunately
for UCLA and the rest of the Pacific
-10 Conference, Fuld's career num
bers would indicate that that time is
often when the conference season
rolls around.
A .450 lifetime hitter against
UCLA heading into this weekend's
Pac-10 opening series in Los Angeles,
Fuld went 5-for-13 with a homerun,
three RBI and four runs scored, to
bring his season average to .282, as
the Cardinal took two of three from
the Bruins.
Opting to return to Stanford in
stead of signing a professional contract
with the Cubs, which drafted Fuld in
the 24th round of the 2003 MLB First-
Year Player Draft, the All-American
candidate got off to a slow start by his
standards this season. A career .343
hitter, Fuld was hitting .260 after going

O-for-5 in a 7-3 win over Saint Mary's
on March 23.
But the three-time All-Pac-10 se
lection has hit safely in seven of eight
games since then, including all three
games against the Bruins.
Fuld was a quiet 2-for-4 with a run
scored in the Cardinal's 11-4 series
opening victory on Friday, but made
some early noise on Saturday when he
drilled a pitch over the right-center
field fence in the first inning for his first
homerun of the season.
Fuld added a two-run triple-his first
of the season after hitting a team-high
nine last year-as part of Stanford's
eight-run fourth inning at Jackie
Robinson Stadium.
With no out in the ninth inning,
freshman outfielder Jim Rapoport on
second base and the game tied 13-13,
Fuld laid down a perfect sacrifice bunt
to move Rapoport to third base. Se
nior third baseman Jonny Ash, who
had his own breakout series, followed
with his second homerun of the game
