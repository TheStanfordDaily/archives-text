# Fuld finds his stroke
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
It's always only a matter of time
before Stanford senior centerfielder
Sam Fuld finds his stroke and gets into
a groove at the plate. Unfortunately
for UCLA and the rest of the Pacific
-10 Conference, Fuld's career num
bers would indicate that that time is
often when the conference season
rolls around.
A .450 lifetime hitter against
UCLA heading into this weekend's
Pac-10 opening series in Los Angeles,
Fuld went 5-for-13 with a homerun,
three RBI and four runs scored, to
bring his season average to .282, as
the Cardinal took two of three from
the Bruins.
Opting to return to Stanford in
stead of signing a professional contract
with the Cubs, which drafted Fuld in
the 24th round of the 2003 MLB First-
Year Player Draft, the All-American
candidate got off to a slow start by his
standards this season. A career .343
hitter, Fuld was hitting .260 after going

O-for-5 in a 7-3 win over Saint Mary's
on March 23.
But the three-time All-Pac-10 se
lection has hit safely in seven of eight
games since then, including all three
games against the Bruins.
Fuld was a quiet 2-for-4 with a run
scored in the Cardinal's 11-4 series
opening victory on Friday, but made
some early noise on Saturday when he
drilled a pitch over the right-center
field fence in the first inning for his first
homerun of the season.
Fuld added a two-run triple-his first
of the season after hitting a team-high
nine last year-as part of Stanford's
eight-run fourth inning at Jackie
Robinson Stadium.
With no out in the ninth inning,
freshman outfielder Jim Rapoport on
second base and the game tied 13-13,
Fuld laid down a perfect sacrifice bunt
to move Rapoport to third base. Se
nior third baseman Jonny Ash, who
had his own breakout series, followed
with his second homerun of the game
for the decisive runs in a 15-13 Cardi
nal victory.
Fuld's last at-bat. while less appar
ent in the box score, is indicative of
what makes him so valuable to the
top-ranked Cardinal.
As the leadoff hitter, the Cardi
nal offense depends heavily on
Fuld. whet her it's getting the big hit
or setting the table for the heart of
the order. While he doesn't steal a
lot of bases — three in four at
tempts this season — he is fourth
on the team with 32 runs scored
and his on-base percentage is

above .400.
Fuld, who collected his 300 th ca
reer hit against Texas earlier this
season, has feasted on conference
pitching throughout his Stanford ca
reer, including a .378 clip as a fresh
man in 2001. Last year, he hit more
than 60 points higher against Pac-10
pitching (.362) than in non-confer
ence tilts (.295).
"It's a coincidence." Fuld said.
But it's a welcome coincidence as
Stanford looks to defend its Pac-10
title with 21 of its final 29 regular sea
son games coming against conference
opponents. In addition to his mastery
of UCLA hurlers, Fuld has swung the
bat especially well in his career against
conference foes Arizona State (.462),
Washington (.462) and Washington
State (.463).
Fuld has started 217 of 227 ca

reer games while at Stanford and in
the past has shown no signs of
wearing down as the season wears
on. By contrast, as the weather
heats up, so too does Fuld. He had
a career-high 17-game hit over a
one-month span at the end of last
season, finished with a .321 average
and tied a team single-season
record with 83 runs scored.
The only season Fuld seems to
enjoy more than the conference sea
son is the postseason. He is a .358 life
time hitter in Omaha and his 24 hits in
three trips to the College World Se
ries rank first all-time. If the Cardinal
is to extend its school record with a
sixth consecutive trip to Rosenblatt
Stadium this June, Fuld will once
again be leading the way. And once
again, he appears to be heating up
right on schedule.
