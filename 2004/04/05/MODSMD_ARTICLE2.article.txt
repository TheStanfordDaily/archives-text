# Lee-Mefford highlight experience

### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bringing the perspective of an ASSU outsider and an
experienced senator to the election, senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford say they are ready to fully devote
themselves to executive office. Lee, the presidential candi
date. is a current Senior Class president. He wants to use his
fifth year at Stanford to address important issues like spe
cial fees, cost of living and ASSU accountability. He is also
a former editor at The Daily. Mefford, an ASSU senator
and the former president of the Stanford Democrats, says
he is committed to helping his running mate enact serious
changes at the Undergraduate Senate. A detailed descrip
tion of their proposals can be found online at

The Daily: With so much leadership experience in the
ASSU and elsewhere, are you worried that students might
perceive you too much as being insiders?
Mikey Lee: Definitely not. Dylan and 1 bring both sides to
the table. This is my fourth election, I ran for sophomore
class president, and we lost. As a sophomore I ran for ju
nior class president and we won. And last year 1 ran as se
nior class president and won.
For the last three years 1 have not been serving in the
ASSU Senate or the executive, I've only been doing class
president stuff. Obviously there are ties between the two
organizations, but I come as an outsider. My real experi

ence with the ASSU is as a student. If you look at another
slate that is running, the only experience they have is with
in the ASSU. They say, "We will work to do something,"
and we say, "We are already working to do something."
Dylan Meflord: I think we fit the model that has been elect
ed to the ASSU executive the last couple of years, where
you have an outsider at the top of the ticket, being Mikey,
who certainly does have leadership experience but not
within the ASSU. and then you have an insider, someone
on the ASSU Senate, and that would be me.
TI): At least in the last couple of years, what do you think
are the things that the ASSU has done well and the things
it has done poorly?
ML:The ASSU does a lot of things well — they're tackling
advising, they started the book buy-back program, they
opened the Blender to increase student space, they made
huge headway with special fees — but I met with Nadiya
Figueroa last week and her quote was that "a lot of the
things we do are behind the scenes." My argument to her
was. "How are you, as the leaders of the association, doing
things behind the scenes?"
How does the ASSU expect to have a good reputation
with students when in a lot of ways it has no reputation with
students? Accessibility is the first step to a solution fora lot
of the problems we're perceived to have.
