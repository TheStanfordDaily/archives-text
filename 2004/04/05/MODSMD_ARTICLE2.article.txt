# Lee-Mefford highlight experience

### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Bringing the perspective of an ASSU outsider and an
experienced senator to the election, senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford say they are ready to fully devote
themselves to executive office. Lee, the presidential candi
date. is a current Senior Class president. He wants to use his
fifth year at Stanford to address important issues like spe
cial fees, cost of living and ASSU accountability. He is also
a former editor at The Daily. Mefford, an ASSU senator
and the former president of the Stanford Democrats, says
he is committed to helping his running mate enact serious
changes at the Undergraduate Senate. A detailed descrip
tion of their proposals can be found online at
http://www.leemefford.com.
The Daily: With so much leadership experience in the
ASSU and elsewhere, are you worried that students might
perceive you too much as being insiders?
Mikey Lee: Definitely not. Dylan and 1 bring both sides to
the table. This is my fourth election, I ran for sophomore
class president, and we lost. As a sophomore I ran for ju
nior class president and we won. And last year 1 ran as se
nior class president and won.
For the last three years 1 have not been serving in the
ASSU Senate or the executive, I've only been doing class
president stuff. Obviously there are ties between the two
organizations, but I come as an outsider. My real experi

ence with the ASSU is as a student. If you look at another
slate that is running, the only experience they have is with
in the ASSU. They say, "We will work to do something,"
and we say, "We are already working to do something."
Dylan Meflord: I think we fit the model that has been elect
ed to the ASSU executive the last couple of years, where
you have an outsider at the top of the ticket, being Mikey,
who certainly does have leadership experience but not
within the ASSU. and then you have an insider, someone
on the ASSU Senate, and that would be me.
TI): At least in the last couple of years, what do you think
are the things that the ASSU has done well and the things
it has done poorly?
ML:The ASSU does a lot of things well — they're tackling
advising, they started the book buy-back program, they
opened the Blender to increase student space, they made
huge headway with special fees — but I met with Nadiya
Figueroa last week and her quote was that "a lot of the
things we do are behind the scenes." My argument to her
was. "How are you, as the leaders of the association, doing
things behind the scenes?"
How does the ASSU expect to have a good reputation
with students when in a lot of ways it has no reputation with
students? Accessibility is the first step to a solution fora lot
of the problems we're perceived to have.
DIM: One of the things that can defi
nitely be improved in the ASSU is the
functioning of the Senate and the
committee system and just the
amount of stuff that actually gets done
there. One of my fellow senators,
Jason Sinocruz, resigned last quarter,
and he said, "I've been here over two
quarters and I still don't know what
the Undergraduate Senate does."
Then he asked a rhetorical question,
"If it were to disappear what would be
lost to the student body?"
TD: What has been your strategy in
approaching this campaign?
ML: We have our flyers up, we have

our banner up and we're trying to get
out issues out there, but we need peo
ple to go to the Web site and look at
our content. It's a place where you
can sit down alone and look at what
we're doing. 11 you compare our Web
site with our opponents' Web sites,
their proposals pale in comparison to
ours in both quality and actual realis
tic proposals.
DIM: One other thing about our cam
paign that distinguishes it from others
is the grassroots nature of what we're
doing. Mikey and I have already per
sonally contacted over 500 students
and we already have a list of over 1 (X)
volunteers who believe in our vision
for improving Stanford.
TD: So what about your campaign
slogan, "Getting Stuff Done"? Can
you explain how that originated
and how it exemplifies your cur
rent campaign?

ML: Another campaign slogan after
looking at our opponents could be
"realistic and effective leadership."
Our drive is very product-driven.
We want results. It's not about how
we're going to work with you and for
you, it's about how to get stuff done.
I come as an outsider. Class-presi
dency has no legislation. If I have an
idea, we implement it.it gets done.
TD: What are your ideas for solving
the special-fees problem?
ML: There are two main ways to solve
special fees. First, we hope to use Ab
solute Fun as matching grants —
seven $ 1 ,(XX) matching grants and 15
$S(X) matching grants per quarter —
through an application process.
As far as the actual solution to special
fees, we think it's satisfaction with the
ASSU. What we hope to bring is finan
cial responsibility on the pail of the
ASSU so that we will tell you where you

money is going. People will not take their
special-fees money hack if they know
that it is going towards something good.
If people don't know what we
know as leaders, how can they under
stand the decisions we make?
Tl): Do you think your candidacy
has particular appeal to any groups
on campus?
DIM: We are the only candidates who
have made a financial commitment to
communities of color. We've set aside
$ 10.(XX) in matching grants to ethnic
and cultural groups that promote di
versity at Stanford. It's easy to talk
about diversity, hut until you're willing
to make a financial commitment,
you're not truly caring about diversity.
We're trying to reach out to every
single student. That said, if you look
at our opponents, what they're doing
basically is mentioning every group in
a very superficial way.

slate that is running, the only experience they have is with
in the ASSU. They say, "We will work to do something,"
and we say, "We are already working to do something."
Dylan Meflord: I think we fit the model that has been elect
ed to the ASSU executive the last couple of years, where
you have an outsider at the top of the ticket, being Mikey,
who certainly does have leadership experience but not
within the ASSU. and then you have an insider, someone
on the ASSU Senate, and that would be me.
TI): At least in the last couple of years, what do you think
are the things that the ASSU has done well and the things
it has done poorly?
ML:The ASSU does a lot of things well — they're tackling
advising, they started the book buy-back program, they
opened the Blender to increase student space, they made
huge headway with special fees — but I met with Nadiya
Figueroa last week and her quote was that "a lot of the
things we do are behind the scenes." My argument to her
was. "How are you, as the leaders of the association, doing
things behind the scenes?"
How does the ASSU expect to have a good reputation
with students when in a lot of ways it has no reputation with
students? Accessibility is the first step to a solution fora lot
of the problems we're perceived to have.
DIM: One of the things that can defi
nitely be improved in the ASSU is the
functioning of the Senate and the
committee system and just the
amount of stuff that actually gets done
there. One of my fellow senators,
Jason Sinocruz, resigned last quarter,
and he said, "I've been here over two
quarters and I still don't know what
the Undergraduate Senate does."
Then he asked a rhetorical question,
"If it were to disappear what would be
lost to the student body?"
TD: What has been your strategy in
approaching this campaign?
ML: We have our flyers up, we have

our banner up and we're trying to get
out issues out there, but we need peo
ple to go to the Web site and look at
our content. It's a place where you
can sit down alone and look at what
we're doing. 11 you compare our Web
site with our opponents' Web sites,
their proposals pale in comparison to
ours in both quality and actual realis
tic proposals.
DIM: One other thing about our cam
paign that distinguishes it from others
is the grassroots nature of what we're
doing. Mikey and I have already per
sonally contacted over 500 students
and we already have a list of over 1 (X)
volunteers who believe in our vision
for improving Stanford.
TD: So what about your campaign
slogan, "Getting Stuff Done"? Can
you explain how that originated
and how it exemplifies your cur
rent campaign?

ML: Another campaign slogan after
looking at our opponents could be
"realistic and effective leadership."
Our drive is very product-driven.
We want results. It's not about how
we're going to work with you and for
you, it's about how to get stuff done.
I come as an outsider. Class-presi
dency has no legislation. If I have an
idea, we implement it.it gets done.
TD: What are your ideas for solving
the special-fees problem?
ML: There are two main ways to solve
special fees. First, we hope to use Ab
solute Fun as matching grants —
seven $ 1 ,(XX) matching grants and 15
$S(X) matching grants per quarter —
through an application process.
As far as the actual solution to special
fees, we think it's satisfaction with the
ASSU. What we hope to bring is finan
cial responsibility on the pail of the
ASSU so that we will tell you where you

money is going. People will not take their
special-fees money hack if they know
that it is going towards something good.
If people don't know what we
know as leaders, how can they under
stand the decisions we make?
Tl): Do you think your candidacy
has particular appeal to any groups
on campus?
DIM: We are the only candidates who
have made a financial commitment to
communities of color. We've set aside
$ 10.(XX) in matching grants to ethnic
and cultural groups that promote di
versity at Stanford. It's easy to talk
about diversity, hut until you're willing
to make a financial commitment,
you're not truly caring about diversity.
We're trying to reach out to every
single student. That said, if you look
at our opponents, what they're doing
basically is mentioning every group in
a very superficial way.

Running mates Mikey Lee and Dylan Mefford.
Bringing the perspective of an ASSU outsider and an
experienced senator to the election, senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford say they are ready to fully devote
themselves to executive office. Lee, the presidential candi
date. is a current Senior Class president. He wants to use his
fifth year at Stanford to address important issues like spe
cial fees, cost of living and ASSU accountability. He is also
a former editor at The Daily. Mefford, an ASSU senator
and the former president of the Stanford Democrats, says
he is committed to helping his running mate enact serious
changes at the Undergraduate Senate. A detailed descrip
tion of their proposals can be found online at
http://www.leemefford.com.
The Daily: With so much leadership experience in the
ASSU and elsewhere, are you worried that students might
perceive you too much as being insiders?
Mikey Lee: Definitely not. Dylan and 1 bring both sides to
the table. This is my fourth election, I ran for sophomore
class president, and we lost. As a sophomore I ran for ju
nior class president and we won. And last year 1 ran as se
nior class president and won.
For the last three years 1 have not been serving in the
ASSU Senate or the executive, I've only been doing class
president stuff. Obviously there are ties between the two
organizations, but I come as an outsider. My real experi

ence with the ASSU is as a student. If you look at another
slate that is running, the only experience they have is with
in the ASSU. They say, "We will work to do something,"
