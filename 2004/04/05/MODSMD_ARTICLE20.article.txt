# Women's lacrosse beats California in overtime, 15-12
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
A young man who rushed the field naked
wasn't the only thing that was streaky about Friday
night's women's lacrosse match at Maloney Field.
No. 20 Stanford blitzed visiting California for
four goals in just 3:21 early in the second half to
take an 8-7 lead — and then watched the Golden
Bears miraculously score twice in the last 30 sec
onds to tie the game at 11 to force overtime.
The Cardinal (7-4,5-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) scored three times in the first over
time and then held off Cal (6-6,1-2) in the second
overtime to win the match 15-12.
"We have to give a lot of credit to Cal for com
ing back," said sophomore midfielder Kelsey
Twist, who scored a game-high four goals. "But we
just decided that we'd end it at that... I'm proud
of the way we took the momentum back and fin
ished in overtime."
Due to Stanford's hosting of the 53-team
Western States Tournament over the weekend,
there were several hundred spectators in atten
dance — Stanford's largest crowd of the season.
The audience, comprised largely of high school
lacrosse teams and rowdies from across the Bay,
produced a spirited atmosphere that may have
contributed to what was an increasingly physical
contest on the field.
"When it's such a tight game, people will play
with a lot of passion," Twist said. "Sometimes it
gets pretty physical."
TTie game got off to a mild start as Stanford
controlled the ball but had trouble putting it into
the net. Stanford would get first-half goals from
Abbi Hills, Kim Cahill, Kelsey Twist, Cassie Har
vey and Claire Calzonetti — a distribution that

reflects just how many chances the Cardinal had to run its
attack and get good shots.
But freshman Cal goalkeeper Hilary Lynch was
staunch in the net. notching save after save. Stanford took
a 17 shots in the first half — usually a very sufficient total
— but when Freya Lund's soft shot slipped past Cardinal
keeper Christina Saikus with 0:17 left in the half, the Bears

took a 6-5 lead, despite having attempted six fewer shots
than Stanford.
"I think the first half we didn't really convert on the
turnovers that we created, and their goalie stepped up,"
said Cardinal head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
Entering the half, Cal was in a strong position, having
outplayed the Cardinal over the last 10 minutes by control

ling possession and using its quickness to get good, close
looks at the goal.
And 2:50 into the second half, Elizabeth Reifsnyder
slipped a close shot past Saikus, giving the Bears a two
goal lead. But the tide turned there, as Hills regained the
ball off the faceoff and ran upfield fora breakaway score
with 26:19 left. The Cardinal would once again control the
faceoff, and just 33 seconds after its last goal, Stanford tied
the game, 7-7, on Twist s quick strike. 26 seconds after
that. Hills came around the back of the net and tossed a
short pass to Nina Pantano, who finished in heavy traffic
for the go-ahead goal.
During the ensuing stoppage of play, the streaker briefly
rushed the field before disappearing into the night, incit
ing the crowd and adding to a rowdy atmosphere that led
to a warning and, later, forced dispersal of hecklers stand
ing behind Cal's goal.
All this didn't appear to faze the Cardinal, which
seemed to be trying to set a record for shortest time be
tween goals. Just 21 seconds after her last score, Pantano
executed a nifty spin move and found the back of the net,
giving Stanford a 9-7 lead with 23:58 left to play.
Cal called timeout and regained control for the next few
minutes. But an aggressive check by senior Stanford de
fender Katie Grube regained possession for Stanford,
which pushed the ball upfield. After several minutes of a
stalling offense. Twist got the ball and drove in for her
third goal, with 16:03 remaining.
Stanford continued to control possession throughout
the remainder of the half, and Sarah Bach scored with
8:25 left, but a pair of Leanne Zilioli goals, with 11:22 and
4:41 remaining, respectively, pulled Cal within two, 11-9,
despite a 29-17 shot disadvantage.
With 3:19 left, star Cal senior Colleen O'Mara received
a yellow card, and it looked like Stanford would hold the
ensuing possession for the remainder of the game, as Cal
looked remarkably patient on defense. But with 0:50 to
play, a Cal check finally got the Bears the ball back, and

Laura Cavallo pushed the hall upfield in a hurry for the
quick-strike goal with 0:30 remaining.
Cal managed to control the faceoff, hut couldn't get a
clean look at the goal. Even so, Julianne Woo drew a free
position foul on the Cardinal with just two seconds left to

play — and whipped the game-tying
shot past Saikus as time expired.
"I think [the Bears] are a good
quick-strike team and that they did
an excellent job scripting the tie,"
Uhlfelder said. "They were just
maximizing their strengths. They'll
get quick cuts on you and quick
feeds on you."
Fortunately for Stanford, Cal

couldn't sustain this pace during
overtime, and 47 seconds into the
first extra period, Cahill found
Megan Burker for the go-ahead goal.
With 0:43 left, Lynch would muff
Bach's roller, and with just 0:05 left,
Twist fed a cutting Calzonetti, whose
bounced shot skipped past Lynch for
a 14-11 advantage.
In the second overtime, Zilioli
scored on an assist from Wu, who was
cutting around behind the net — a
tactic that worked well for the speedy
Bears all night long. That was all Cal
could muster, though, and Twist's
fourth goal, with 0:10 remaining, iced

the game for Stanford, 15-12.
It was just another close game for
the Cardinal women, who have al
ready played in five games this season
that were decided by just one goal.
"I think our team is learning a lot,"
Uhlfelder said. "The close games are
a reflection of how strongly we can
fight. Our team has had to learn the
value of having the ball and taking
care of it."'
The Cardinal, which has never lost
in MPSF play during Uhlfelder's four
years as head coach, will take on non
conference foe No. 13 Northwestern
on Friday night.

play — and whipped the game-tying
shot past Saikus as time expired.
"I think [the Bears] are a good
quick-strike team and that they did
an excellent job scripting the tie,"
Uhlfelder said. "They were just
maximizing their strengths. They'll
get quick cuts on you and quick
feeds on you."
Fortunately for Stanford, Cal

couldn't sustain this pace during
overtime, and 47 seconds into the
first extra period, Cahill found
Megan Burker for the go-ahead goal.
With 0:43 left, Lynch would muff
Bach's roller, and with just 0:05 left,
Twist fed a cutting Calzonetti, whose
bounced shot skipped past Lynch for
a 14-11 advantage.
In the second overtime, Zilioli
scored on an assist from Wu, who was
cutting around behind the net — a
tactic that worked well for the speedy
Bears all night long. That was all Cal
could muster, though, and Twist's
fourth goal, with 0:10 remaining, iced

the game for Stanford, 15-12.
It was just another close game for
the Cardinal women, who have al
ready played in five games this season
that were decided by just one goal.
"I think our team is learning a lot,"
Uhlfelder said. "The close games are
a reflection of how strongly we can
fight. Our team has had to learn the
value of having the ball and taking
care of it."'
The Cardinal, which has never lost
in MPSF play during Uhlfelder's four
years as head coach, will take on non
conference foe No. 13 Northwestern
on Friday night.
A young man who rushed the field naked
wasn't the only thing that was streaky about Friday
night's women's lacrosse match at Maloney Field.
No. 20 Stanford blitzed visiting California for
four goals in just 3:21 early in the second half to
take an 8-7 lead — and then watched the Golden
Bears miraculously score twice in the last 30 sec
onds to tie the game at 11 to force overtime.
The Cardinal (7-4,5-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) scored three times in the first over
time and then held off Cal (6-6,1-2) in the second
overtime to win the match 15-12.
"We have to give a lot of credit to Cal for com
ing back," said sophomore midfielder Kelsey
Twist, who scored a game-high four goals. "But we
just decided that we'd end it at that... I'm proud
of the way we took the momentum back and fin
ished in overtime."
Due to Stanford's hosting of the 53-team
Western States Tournament over the weekend,
there were several hundred spectators in atten
dance — Stanford's largest crowd of the season.
The audience, comprised largely of high school
lacrosse teams and rowdies from across the Bay,
produced a spirited atmosphere that may have
contributed to what was an increasingly physical
contest on the field.
"When it's such a tight game, people will play
with a lot of passion," Twist said. "Sometimes it
gets pretty physical."
TTie game got off to a mild start as Stanford
controlled the ball but had trouble putting it into
the net. Stanford would get first-half goals from
Abbi Hills, Kim Cahill, Kelsey Twist, Cassie Har
vey and Claire Calzonetti — a distribution that

reflects just how many chances the Cardinal had to run its
attack and get good shots.
But freshman Cal goalkeeper Hilary Lynch was
staunch in the net. notching save after save. Stanford took
a 17 shots in the first half — usually a very sufficient total
— but when Freya Lund's soft shot slipped past Cardinal
keeper Christina Saikus with 0:17 left in the half, the Bears

took a 6-5 lead, despite having attempted six fewer shots
than Stanford.
"I think the first half we didn't really convert on the
turnovers that we created, and their goalie stepped up,"
said Cardinal head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
Entering the half, Cal was in a strong position, having
outplayed the Cardinal over the last 10 minutes by control

ling possession and using its quickness to get good, close
looks at the goal.
And 2:50 into the second half, Elizabeth Reifsnyder
slipped a close shot past Saikus, giving the Bears a two
goal lead. But the tide turned there, as Hills regained the
ball off the faceoff and ran upfield fora breakaway score
with 26:19 left. The Cardinal would once again control the
faceoff, and just 33 seconds after its last goal, Stanford tied
the game, 7-7, on Twist s quick strike. 26 seconds after
that. Hills came around the back of the net and tossed a
short pass to Nina Pantano, who finished in heavy traffic
for the go-ahead goal.
During the ensuing stoppage of play, the streaker briefly
rushed the field before disappearing into the night, incit
ing the crowd and adding to a rowdy atmosphere that led
to a warning and, later, forced dispersal of hecklers stand
ing behind Cal's goal.
All this didn't appear to faze the Cardinal, which
seemed to be trying to set a record for shortest time be
tween goals. Just 21 seconds after her last score, Pantano
executed a nifty spin move and found the back of the net,
giving Stanford a 9-7 lead with 23:58 left to play.
Cal called timeout and regained control for the next few
minutes. But an aggressive check by senior Stanford de
fender Katie Grube regained possession for Stanford,
which pushed the ball upfield. After several minutes of a
stalling offense. Twist got the ball and drove in for her
third goal, with 16:03 remaining.
Stanford continued to control possession throughout
the remainder of the half, and Sarah Bach scored with
8:25 left, but a pair of Leanne Zilioli goals, with 11:22 and
4:41 remaining, respectively, pulled Cal within two, 11-9,
despite a 29-17 shot disadvantage.
With 3:19 left, star Cal senior Colleen O'Mara received
a yellow card, and it looked like Stanford would hold the
ensuing possession for the remainder of the game, as Cal
looked remarkably patient on defense. But with 0:50 to
play, a Cal check finally got the Bears the ball back, and
