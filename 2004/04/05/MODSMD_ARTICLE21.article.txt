# No. 9 women's softball opens Pac-10 play 2-1
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's No. 9 softball team
(29-8, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
began conference play this weekend
with an impressive showing against
the Oregon schools, defeating No.
14 Oregon State on Friday and split
ting a two-game series with No. 15
Oregon Saturday and yesterday.
The weekend's action began with
Friday night's matchup against the
Beavers (31-10) and their ace pitch
er, Monica Hoffman. Although
Hoffman pitched well, allowing only
two runs and three hits over six in
nings, the Cardinal's own ace, Dana
Sorensen, was even better, hurling a
complete game shutout two-hitter
for the win, her 16th of the year.
Keying the Cardinal offense in
the 2-0 win was sophomore center
fielder Catalina Morris, who had a
hand in both of the Cardinal's
runs, driving in freshman Jackie
Rinehart with a third-inning triple
and scoring later that inning on a
single by sophomore shortstop
Lauren Lappin.
Saturday's game against the
Ducks (29-9) was less encouraging
for the Cardinal, especially from an
offensive standpoint. The Cardinal
was unable to get any type of of
fense going in a 1-0 loss to the
Ducks, as Oregon pitcher Ani
Nyhus (14-4) pitched a complete
game one-hitter. The Cardinal's
only hit, a single by junior Kather
ine Hoffman, came in the bottom of
the first inning, and the team did not
have another baserunner for the re
mainder of the game as Nyhus
rolled through the Cardinal batters
one by one.
Cardinal pitcher Laura Severson

pitched well despite taking the loss,
allowing only one run over seven in
nings. Severson did struggle with
her control at times, walking four
Ducks and allowing six hits, but she
managed to work her way out of
jams most of the time. Overall, Sev
erson's performance was a bright
spot in an otherwise dismal game for
the Cardinal.
The Cardinal fared much better
against the Ducks yesterday after
noon, once again riding a strong per
formance by Sorensen to an impor
tant conference victory. Sorensen
gave up just one run in a complete
game victory to improve to 17-4 on
the season.
Sunday's game featured an offen
sive resurgence by the Cardinal, and
its first victim was Nyhus. This time
around, the Cardinal knocked
Nyhus out of the game in the third
inning after a 2-run double by junior
third baseman Meghan Sickler gave
Stanford a 3-0 lead.
The Cardinal would not look
back, getting three more runs in the
fifth inning to push the score to its
final margin of 6-1. Sickler had
three RBIs in the game and junior
designated player Leah Nelson
went two-for-two with two RBIs for
the Cardinal.
The Cardinal hopes to build on
this weekend's performance next
week in three games against No. 3
California (31-3). Cal is a national
powerhouse and the Cardinal will
have to execute very well on both of
fense and defense if it hopes to de
feat the Golden Bears.
The Cardinal plays in Berkeley
on Friday but comes back home to
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium
to host the Golden Bears in a dou
bleheader on Saturday.
