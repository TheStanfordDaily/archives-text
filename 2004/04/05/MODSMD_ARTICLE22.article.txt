### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Add one ltiss to No. 4 Southern Cal
ifornia on Friday and one loss to No. 5
UCLA on Saturday and the sum is one
disappointing weekend for the No. 9
Stanford men's tennis team.
The Cardinal team went into Fri
day's match with four straight wins
under its belt, but Stanford was edged
by the Trojans, 4-3. USC is now 15-2
this season.
The Cardinal's problems started
right away when the Trojans swept the
doubles points. At the No. 1 spot,
sophomore K.C. Corkery and junior
Sam Warburg put up a good fight
against No. 9 Drew Hoskins and
Daniel Langre but were unable to
grasp a win, taking a 8-6 loss.
"The team we played were really
good," Warburg said. "This is one of
the first away matches that we've
played, so we're still getting used to
playing away from home. It's definitely
a factor. We didn't play our best."
Playing No. 2 doubles, sophomore
James Pade and freshman James Wan
pitted their strength against USC's
Johan Berg and Parker Collins. It was a
close match, but the Cardinal duo was
ousted, 9-7.
Wrapping up doubles play was se
nior team captain Carter Morris and ju
nior Phil Sheng, who went up against
Adriano Biasella and Ruben Torres in
No. 3 doubles action. Morris /Sheng
took an 8-5 defeat from the Trojan pair.
Stanford split the singles matches
with USC, which brought in five
ranked players (Stanford has just one
ranked player). At the No. 1 spot. No.
23 Warburg went up against USC's No.
26 Adriano Biasella. Warburg took a
rare 6-1,6-4 loss, dropping him to a 13-
2 in dual matches this year.
Corkery, playing No. 2 singles, gave
up the first set of his match in six
straight games against USC's No. 71
Johan Berg, but made a swift
turnaround and defeated Berg in three
sets with a score of 0-6,6-3,6-1.
Sheng did not fair so well against his
opponent, losing 6-4,6-3 to the Trojans'
No. 42 Jamil Al-Agba.
It didn't come as a surprise to any
one when Wan grabbed hold of anoth
er victory, bringing his season dual

match record to 17-0. The freshman
downed No. 47 Ruben Torres, 6-1,6-4.
Morris had a good start to his match
when he took the first set, 6-3, but was
unable to hold onto the lead. USC's
Daniel Langre slid past Morris to take
a 3-6,6-2,6-1 victory.
Freshman Chris Rasmussen also
played to three sets in his match, leav
ing the courts last with a 7-6, 1-6,11-9
win over No. 92 Drew Hoskins.
Things didn't go much better for the
Cardinal team on Saturday, when it
was dealt another loss by the Bruins.
Stanford is now 12-5 for the season
after the 5-2 defeat.
Once again, the Cardinal was un
able to take the doubles point, allowing
UCLA to sweep all three matches.
Corkery / Warburg dropped to a 7-
3 season record together, losing 9-7 to
No. 20 Alberto Francis and Kris Kwin
ta. Following suit, Pade / Wan lost 8-3
to Philipp Gruendler and Luben Pam
poulov, while Morris/Sheng were
overcome 8-5 by Tobias Clemens and
Chris Surapol.
Stanford was only able to take two
singles wins for the day as it went up
against five ranked players.
Warburg made an impressive
showing, surprising No. 5 Tobias
Clemens by taking an easy 6-1, 6-2
victory, while Wan went three sets
to defeat No. 78 Kris Kwinta, 6-1,2-
6,6-1.
Even though Warburg isn't ranked
as high as Clemens, that doesn't mean
that a lower level of play from the No.
23 player should be anticipated.
"I've playing pretty well lately and
I've improved a lot," Warburg said. "I
don't think that it's something people
wouldn't expect. I've definitely been
playing well. I think he didn't play his
best, but I also played much better the
day before against USC."
In the losses, UCLA's Pampoulov
defeated Corkery 6-1, 7-6 (5) and
Sheng took a 1 -6,6-2,6-1 loss from No.
62 Chris Lam. Both Morris and Ras
mussen lost in three sets, with No. 60
Alberto Francis taking his match
against Morris, 6-4,5-7,6-4, while No.
98 Philipp Gruendler won against Ras
mussen, 6-2,6-2.
The team will travel back to the
Bay Area to play at Cal tomorrow at
1:30 p.m.
