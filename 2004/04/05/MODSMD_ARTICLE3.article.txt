# Stockman-Henick say Chappie slate gives voice to the underrepresented
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Charlie Stockman and ju
nior Matthew Henick are not merely
writers for Stanford's humor maga
zine, The Chaparral, but they are
also self-described "lifetime politi
cians." Their irreverent campaign is
aimed at undermining the stuffy in
sider atmosphere often associated
with the Undergraduate Senate.
However, when they spoke to The
Daily, it was clear that their foray
into politics had not caused them to
lose their sense of humor. Stockman
is running for president and Henick
for vice president. Some of their
ideas — plus a videogame involving
shooting pizzas at current ASSU
Vice President Joey Natoli — can be
found on the Web at
http://www.stanford.edu/~stock
man/election/everyman.html.
The Daily: First of all, why are
you running?
Charlie Stockman: We think we rep
resent students that aren't being
represented by other slates. It's
tough to have to go through this
every year because people say we're
on a "Chappie Slate," but Chappie
people are politically minded, and
we care about the school. We actual
ly consider ourselves the grad stu
dent slate because we're both co
term students.
Matthew Henick: We've also men
tioned before vaguely that it's in our
blood. Our great-grandfathers actual
ly founded the ASSU. Over the past
70years it's been dragged through the
mud and we think it's about time it

was restored to its rightful owners.
TD: Charlie, you ran last year for
ASSU vice president and lost. What
is going to be different this year?
MH: He's going to win this year.
CS: Yeah, you don't run twice and
lose, 1 said that before. As seriously
as 1 took it last year, I'm going to take
it that much more seriously this year.
MH: You can't see it on the tape
recorder, but his sleeves are rolled
up. I think that's important to note.
TD: What do you think of the job the
ASSU has done this year and in
past years?
MH: They've done a job, everyone
does a job, but nothing ever really
gets done. My great-grandfather set
the system in place and it was pretty
self-sufficient. You can put some
sprinkles on top like Absolute Fun
and the book exchange, which have
been pretty good, but nothing ever
really changes.
CS: We were going to say that we
think Absolute Fun, it's pretty dan
gerous. I don't think people can take
fun in its absolute form. It was a pret
ty serious high, that Cold Stone ice
cream night, but the down after
wards; people just plummeted.
MH: I almost went into insulin
shock.
TD: What about experience? What
past leadership experience has given

you the confidence to be ASSU lead
ers? Vou mentioned that maybe it is in
the blood. Do you have any other,
non-genetic examples?
CS: A lot of people don't know,
but 1 was the real Senior Class
President, I designed all the Pub
Night schedules. I also play on the
lacrosse team, and that will help
me represent the Club Sports

group. And Henick, he's actually
the provisional president of the
Stanford Democrats.
Mil: It is true. It's very hard to lead
the Democrats, especially provision
ally. I am a lifetime politician, I was
forced to go into it in elementary
school. I promised my second-grade
class a carnival, and 1 won. That car
ried on into junior high where I
promised my class a soda machine,
with grape soda.
TD: What issues are you guys going
to focus on? For example, every
one always says that they are going
to be the ones to bring student
groups together.

MH: Everyone always says that. We
actually have a list of things to go over,
like student groups and cost of living.
CS: 1 think that no one has ever
thought that it costs money to live
here as students, so I think we're
going to blow the campaign open
right there. Also, student space is
an issue.
MH: And accountability, responsibil
ity, communications, transparency,
diversity and minority.
CS: We're going to have splinter
branches for all these things, like
Bush's Department of Homeland Se

curity. What else, how about resumes?
MH: Resumes, yes, this is a very impor
tant issue for the campaign. We are very
insistent that by winning, it will not only
help our resumes but all the resumes of
the students who vote for us.
CS: We're going to make each and every
student a co-president in the ASSU.
Tl): You said earlier that you did not
like to be referred to as the "Chappie
Slate." How do you plan on avoiding
that association?
MH: 1 don't like that insinuation, per
sonally. We're here to represent the
graduate student interests and the

club sports interests, so if it happens to
help the humor magazine along the
way, so be it.
CS: We can't escape it. We're funny
and we're charming — that's why
we're on The Chappie. That's all
going to come out, but it's not the only
thing we represent.
TD: Is there anything else you would
like to say to voters?
CS: Oh yeah, we forgot, like, the num
ber one issue of this campaign. Don't
miss this. We are going to
guarantee the capture of the "Serial
Groper." We are going to search for
him through every cat house, dog

house and whore house on this cam
pus. And anyone who is caught har
boring the Serial Groper or any of his
minions of inappropriateness, then
they will bear the full brunt
of punishment.
MH: We might give him an honorary
degree. We'll smoke him out with an
honorary' degree.
CS: And when he shows up to get it.
we'll nab him.
