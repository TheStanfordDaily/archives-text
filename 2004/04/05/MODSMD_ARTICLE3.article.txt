# Stockman-Henick say Chappie slate gives voice to the underrepresented
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Charlie Stockman and ju
nior Matthew Henick are not merely
writers for Stanford's humor maga
zine, The Chaparral, but they are
also self-described "lifetime politi
cians." Their irreverent campaign is
aimed at undermining the stuffy in
sider atmosphere often associated
with the Undergraduate Senate.
However, when they spoke to The
Daily, it was clear that their foray
into politics had not caused them to
lose their sense of humor. Stockman
is running for president and Henick
for vice president. Some of their
ideas — plus a videogame involving
shooting pizzas at current ASSU
Vice President Joey Natoli — can be
found on the Web at

man/election/everyman.html.
The Daily: First of all, why are
you running?
Charlie Stockman: We think we rep
resent students that aren't being
represented by other slates. It's
tough to have to go through this
every year because people say we're
on a "Chappie Slate," but Chappie
people are politically minded, and
we care about the school. We actual
ly consider ourselves the grad stu
dent slate because we're both co
term students.
Matthew Henick: We've also men
tioned before vaguely that it's in our
blood. Our great-grandfathers actual
ly founded the ASSU. Over the past
70years it's been dragged through the
mud and we think it's about time it

was restored to its rightful owners.
TD: Charlie, you ran last year for
ASSU vice president and lost. What
is going to be different this year?
MH: He's going to win this year.
CS: Yeah, you don't run twice and
lose, 1 said that before. As seriously
as 1 took it last year, I'm going to take
it that much more seriously this year.
MH: You can't see it on the tape
recorder, but his sleeves are rolled
up. I think that's important to note.
TD: What do you think of the job the
ASSU has done this year and in
past years?
MH: They've done a job, everyone
does a job, but nothing ever really
gets done. My great-grandfather set
the system in place and it was pretty
self-sufficient. You can put some
sprinkles on top like Absolute Fun
and the book exchange, which have
been pretty good, but nothing ever
really changes.
CS: We were going to say that we
think Absolute Fun, it's pretty dan
gerous. I don't think people can take
fun in its absolute form. It was a pret
ty serious high, that Cold Stone ice
cream night, but the down after
wards; people just plummeted.
MH: I almost went into insulin
shock.
TD: What about experience? What
past leadership experience has given
