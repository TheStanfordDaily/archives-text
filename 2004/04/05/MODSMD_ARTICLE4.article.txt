## 
### SHAMALA GALLAGHER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While thousands of members of the public
converged on campus yesterday for Commu
nity Day, a small group of campus workers,
their families and students came together to
honor the campus labor force in the third an
nual gathering sponsored by the Stanford
Labor Action Coalition (SLAC).
This year's gathering'only attracted a few
dozen people and started late because there
are no major contracts up for negotiation in
the near future. In contrast, last year's protest
attracted around 250 protesters.
"This program is more to celebrate and
thank the workers for everything," said fresh
man Francisco Preciado. "We've got a small
program. We've got hamburgers and hot dogs,
and we're just going to eat and relax."
According to junior Anna Mumford, a
SLAC representative, the event's purpose this
year was "to create a sense of community be
tween workers and students and to create a
space for low-wage workers."
Senior Sofia Lee, the current SLAC co-co
ordinator, added that the event's purpose is
also to raise awareness of issues regarding
workers' rights.

As well as a free barbeque, the event con
sisted of a presentation in both English and
Spanish led by SLAC members. In the pre
sentation. sophomore Joseles De La Cruz ex
plained the background of one of SLAC's
most pressing issues, a code of conduct
at Stanford.
"A code of conduct would apply to all
workers on campus but focuses on low-wage
workers to ensure basic labor standards at
Stanford," De La Cruz said.
De La Cruz said that a code of conduct
would have four tenets.
"First and foremost, a code of conduct de
mands living wages and affordable health
care benefits for everyone who works at Stan
ford," Delacruz said. "Second, as an institu
tion of higher learning, Stanford must extend
its academic resources to all community
members by providing educational opportu
nities for its workforce.
"Third, a code of conduct demands equal
wages for equal work to ensure no person's
job is threatened by the exploitation of cheap
er labor, and lastly, a code of conduct de
mands that Stanford respect working peo
ples' rights to form a union," De La Cruz said.
De La Cruz explained that in May 2003,
students fasted for seven days to make the

University adopt a code of conduct. After
seven days of fasting. President John Hen
nessy agreed to create a committee to review
Stanford's labor practices and make recom
mendations for change in Spring 2004.
At the close of the presentation, Susan
Englander, assistant editor of the Martin
Luther King, Jr. Papers Project, spoke about
the importance of the American labor move
ment to Dr. King's work.
Englander played an audio recording of
a speech delivered by Dr. King in 1962,
which called fora "greater social conscious
ness" and for concern about "the gulf be
tween superfluous wealth and abject, dead
ening poverty.''
Zev Kvitky, president of United Stan
ford Workers, explained that Stanford
workers, who hold a variety of jobs and fall
into a variety of categories, have been
unionized for 31 years.
"Community Day is a time when everyone
turns out to show that the workers are defi
nitely part of the community," said Mitch
Bousson, chief steward for the United Stan
ford Workers.
"Stanford is a world-class institution," he
said. "We want to get Stanford to the place
where it's a world-class employer."
