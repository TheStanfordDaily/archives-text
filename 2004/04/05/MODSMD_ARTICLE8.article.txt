### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two top provincial officials from the Re
public of South Africa's Free State Province
visited Stanford last Thursday. Speakers Dr.
Muzamani Charles Nwaila, superintendent
of general education, and Khotso De Wee,
director general, planned to meet with vari
ous Stanford student groups while in town
for The Woodside Village Forum and said
they hope to build a relationship with the
local community.
Nwaila and De Wee participated in a
forum on "Ten Years of Democracy in South

Africa: Implications for Development"
Thursday night at the Woodside Village
Church. The forum provided attendees a
broad overview of South Africa's democratic
history from the beginnings of struggle in
1652, to the height of the student rebellion in
1976 and finally into the present democracy.
"I don't want to give the impression that
things are perfect in South Africa, they are not
they are far from perfect," De Wee said.
"According to statistics of Africa our unem
ployment rate is approximately 30 percent —
that's huge by world standards."
The Woodside Forum was founded by
local pastor Robert Hamerton-Kelly, a for

mer dean of Stanford's Memorial Church
and a member of the academic staff in In
ternational Studies. For eight years the
forum has presented a variety of speakers
from around the world on topics like
bioethics and the military.
" I wanted to bring the local community —
in which some very remarkable people live
— some of the outstanding speakers a uni
versity like Stanford makes available," said
Hamerton-Kelly.
For these two speakers, the forum is their
final stop before returning to South Africa.
Nwaila and De Wee's itinerary for the
West Coast also included the international de

velopment conference held in Portland, Ore.
"If you want to empower a country, you
have to let the people speak and do things
themselves," Nwaila said of a key concept he
took away from the conference. "What we're
looking for is for other countries of the world
— strong countries like the U.S. — to have
confidence in us. It's not an issue of the past
where Africa would come [just] asking for
money — we have human capital."
They also visited Virginia schools to see
how secondary education in the United
States is using technology in classrooms.
Nwaila said that as he looks towards the fu
ture, he envisions technology and education

as a vital part of the Free State Province's ed
ucation system. In the VISION2()14 plan, all
schools will be connected to the Internet by
2014. Nwaila added that even though the
province was the most improved education
system in South Africa for the 2003-2004
year, it still has a long way to go. Currently,
only 10 percent of K-12 schools in the
province are connected to the Internet.
When asked about the exchange of
knowledge between Stanford and the Free
State Province, Woodside Village Church
Missions Director Wayne Larocque said,
"It's certainly a beginning —there's a lot
here to encompass."
