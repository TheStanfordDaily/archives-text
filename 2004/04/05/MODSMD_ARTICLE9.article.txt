## TV... Stanford style "Iron Chef" and "Random Hookups" come to campus 
### JULIE LEIN SHIRIN SHARIF STAFF WRITERS 
Stanford has a reputation for having
hard-working students spending count
less hours programming in the LAIR,
studying at Sweet Hall and cramming at
the library. As realistic of an interpreta
tion of Stanford life as that may seem, it
is clear that Stanford students find
countless ways of amusing themselves
outside of playing chess and memoriz
ing encyclopedias.
While students are able to join in the
television, sport and movie craze, Stan
ford also provides the unique opportu
nity for these talented minds to initiate
their own projects. Pop culture is mak
ing its way into many facets of student
life beyond watching it behind a screen
as students are emulating some of their
favorite television programs. Hence,
the replication of television-like events
is coming forth in real life on the Stan
ford campus.
"Iron Chef'
The show "Iron Chef' on the Food
Network created quite the stir nation
wide as incomprehensible foreigners
battled for supremacy on the cooking
stage. Stanford has decided to take this
competition and make it our own
through the Stanford Dining and Stan
ford Cooking Club co-sponsored stu
dent Iron Chef competition. After see
ing the pros go at it on TV, Stanford stu
dents are given the opportunity to prove
their cooking prowess before a Univer

sity-wide audience at Wilbur Dining.
The judging team will consist of facul
ty members — possibilities include Uni
versity President John Hennessy, possi
bly a local chef from Spago in Palo Alto,
Stanford Dining chefs and students.
The student version of the competi
tion began last year when current
sophomore Aron Hegyi approached
Associate Director of Residential Din
ing Rafi Taherian and Wilbur Dining's
executive chef from last year, Bruce
Biron. Although there had traditionally
been Iron Chef competitions between
Stanford Dining chefs, student partici
pation had been strangely absent.
Hegyi worked with Stanford Dining
and the competition was held at the end of
May, with three teams of students partici
pating. Hegyi and his teammate sopho
more Emi Adachi won the competition —
which was measured by student votes —
with their recipe and preparation of prof
iteroles (cream puffs filled with ice cream)
and bananas foster (bananas flamed with
butter, brown sugar and rum).
This year, the competition is set to
make its second annual debut at the
end of April. Hegyi and the Stanford
Dining officials, Terry Nahavandi and
Jeff Rosen, are trying to come up with
a new name for the event, since they
think that the Iron Chef idea is too
played out and they want something
more interesting.
Hegyi is expecting four to five teams,
comprised of two people per team, for
the event. Each team will submit its own
recipe, which will be given to the Wilbur
line cooks. They will be turning out hun

dreds of portions of the given dish dur
ing the night, while the team must focus
on creating approximately six quality
plates for the judges.
A new feature of the competition is
that each team will have its own station
— grill, saute, wok, ovens or carving
board — and the teams have to tailor
their recipes to the station. The teams
will also have official uniforms and there
will be prizes for winners, like cookware
and knife sets.
From "Iron Cher' to the Stanford
Cooking Club
Also a prominent member of the
Stanford Cooking Club, Hegyi is hoping
that his involvement with the Iron Chef
competition will raise awareness of his
campus group. The majority of past and
present competitors have come from the
Cooking Club.
Recently, the club cooked dinner
for 700 people at Friday's An Art Af
fair. The menu included grilled lamb
and vegetables, kebabs with cumin
and cinnamon, mixed greens with
grapes, goat cheese and tarragon in
vinaigrette, asparagi con proscuitto
(proscuitto-wrapped asparagus), cool
roasted shitakes with barbequed
onions & basil oil, poulet fafa (chicken
with taro leaves and coconut milk),
braciole, grilled salmon in white wine
sauce, risotto milanese with zucchini,
mashed potatoes with smoked Ched
dar and grainy mustard, orecchiette
with pesto, assorted fruit clafoutis,
honey walnut chocolate tart and peach

frangipane tart.
There were a core of 10 members
who started cooking just one day in ad
vance for the annual event. The part
nership between the Cooking Club and
An Art Affair has existed since An Aft
Affair began three years ago.
"It went really well," Hegyi said.
"The food was really good. We faced a
lot of challenges in that five hour block
right before serving time, but we man
aged to get everything done."
The most recent addition to
Hegyi's cooking repertoire is "Los
Tacos" —a post party eatery that
made its debut on Saturday at mid
night. Hegyi hopes to fill the void of
eating options for students after they
come back from parties.
Hegyi and senior Vaman Kamath got
the idea from a taco stand in Acapulco
that they frequented at 5 a.m. after their
spring break clubbing adventures. On
Saturday, Hegyi and Kamath served
fresh handmade tortillas, chicken, salsa
verde and salsa roja to students from
midnight to 2 a.m. They plan to hold
"Los Tacos" events semi-regularly at
the Sigma Nu house.
TV show-assisted dating
Some say, if a Stanford student can
see it on TV, there is no reason he or
she should not be able to do it. After
all, if they can spend countless hours
reading and programming, there's no
reason they shouldn't create some
outside diversion.
Speaking of distractions, one of the
problems that Stanford students often
grapple with in their social life is the lack
of dating on campus. Why is it so hard
for students if couples are finding love,
or at least getting some booty, on shows
like "Blind Date," "Extreme Dating"
and the "Fifth Wheel"?
While students complain about the
lack of a middle ground between ran
dom hook-ups and serious, marriage
like relationships, some vibrant minds
have opted to do something about it —
or, at least facilitate a structured medi
um for potential hook-ups that don't in
volve a frat party.
The new show, "Random Hookups",
has already had its first taping. Produc
ers boast that they will enhance student
life with this newly established dating
show that sets up paired Stanford stu
dents with a paid date. Cameras watch
the sparks fly or Cupid's arrow miss, ei
ther way, bringing people together for
the entertainment of an audience.
"I think it's going to reflect on the
poor social skills of Stanford students
and just televise them," said sophomore
Gillian Reynolds. "Then again, that's a
lot like the dating shows out there al
ready that pin two incompatible and
often weird people together. Basically
this is going to have a lot of humor value.
And just don't like all those 'Blind Date'
TV shows 1 think you'll find more com
edy than actual love potential."
Producers hope that if "Random
Hookups" proves to be anything like its
national television counterparts, Stan
ford could face a healthy revival in the
dating scene.
Maybe if they work hard enough,
they can bring Survivor to campus.

a new name for the event, since they
think that the Iron Chef idea is too
played out and they want something
more interesting.
Hegyi is expecting four to five teams,
comprised of two people per team, for
the event. Each team will submit its own
recipe, which will be given to the Wilbur
line cooks. They will be turning out hun

dreds of portions of the given dish dur
ing the night, while the team must focus
on creating approximately six quality
plates for the judges.
A new feature of the competition is
that each team will have its own station
— grill, saute, wok, ovens or carving
board — and the teams have to tailor
their recipes to the station. The teams
will also have official uniforms and there
will be prizes for winners, like cookware
and knife sets.
From "Iron Cher' to the Stanford
Cooking Club
Also a prominent member of the
Stanford Cooking Club, Hegyi is hoping
that his involvement with the Iron Chef
competition will raise awareness of his
campus group. The majority of past and
present competitors have come from the
Cooking Club.
Recently, the club cooked dinner
for 700 people at Friday's An Art Af
fair. The menu included grilled lamb
and vegetables, kebabs with cumin
and cinnamon, mixed greens with
grapes, goat cheese and tarragon in
vinaigrette, asparagi con proscuitto
(proscuitto-wrapped asparagus), cool
roasted shitakes with barbequed
onions & basil oil, poulet fafa (chicken
with taro leaves and coconut milk),
braciole, grilled salmon in white wine
sauce, risotto milanese with zucchini,
mashed potatoes with smoked Ched
dar and grainy mustard, orecchiette
with pesto, assorted fruit clafoutis,
honey walnut chocolate tart and peach

frangipane tart.
There were a core of 10 members
who started cooking just one day in ad
vance for the annual event. The part
nership between the Cooking Club and
An Art Affair has existed since An Aft
Affair began three years ago.
"It went really well," Hegyi said.
"The food was really good. We faced a
lot of challenges in that five hour block
right before serving time, but we man
aged to get everything done."
The most recent addition to
Hegyi's cooking repertoire is "Los
Tacos" —a post party eatery that
made its debut on Saturday at mid
night. Hegyi hopes to fill the void of
eating options for students after they
come back from parties.
Hegyi and senior Vaman Kamath got
the idea from a taco stand in Acapulco
that they frequented at 5 a.m. after their
spring break clubbing adventures. On
Saturday, Hegyi and Kamath served
fresh handmade tortillas, chicken, salsa
verde and salsa roja to students from
midnight to 2 a.m. They plan to hold
"Los Tacos" events semi-regularly at
the Sigma Nu house.
TV show-assisted dating
Some say, if a Stanford student can
see it on TV, there is no reason he or
she should not be able to do it. After
all, if they can spend countless hours
reading and programming, there's no
reason they shouldn't create some
outside diversion.
Speaking of distractions, one of the
problems that Stanford students often
grapple with in their social life is the lack
of dating on campus. Why is it so hard
for students if couples are finding love,
or at least getting some booty, on shows
like "Blind Date," "Extreme Dating"
and the "Fifth Wheel"?
While students complain about the
lack of a middle ground between ran
dom hook-ups and serious, marriage
like relationships, some vibrant minds
have opted to do something about it —
or, at least facilitate a structured medi
um for potential hook-ups that don't in
volve a frat party.
The new show, "Random Hookups",
has already had its first taping. Produc
ers boast that they will enhance student
life with this newly established dating
show that sets up paired Stanford stu
dents with a paid date. Cameras watch
the sparks fly or Cupid's arrow miss, ei
ther way, bringing people together for
the entertainment of an audience.
"I think it's going to reflect on the
poor social skills of Stanford students
and just televise them," said sophomore
Gillian Reynolds. "Then again, that's a
lot like the dating shows out there al
ready that pin two incompatible and
often weird people together. Basically
this is going to have a lot of humor value.
And just don't like all those 'Blind Date'
TV shows 1 think you'll find more com
edy than actual love potential."
Producers hope that if "Random
Hookups" proves to be anything like its
national television counterparts, Stan
ford could face a healthy revival in the
dating scene.
Maybe if they work hard enough,
they can bring Survivor to campus.

Gabe Loeb and Allison Paine compete in the Iron Chef competition in Wilbur's dining hall last year — the first time students
were allowed to participate. The second annual competition will be held in late April.
Stanford has a reputation for having
hard-working students spending count
less hours programming in the LAIR,
studying at Sweet Hall and cramming at
the library. As realistic of an interpreta
tion of Stanford life as that may seem, it
is clear that Stanford students find
countless ways of amusing themselves
outside of playing chess and memoriz
ing encyclopedias.
While students are able to join in the
television, sport and movie craze, Stan
ford also provides the unique opportu
nity for these talented minds to initiate
their own projects. Pop culture is mak
ing its way into many facets of student
life beyond watching it behind a screen
as students are emulating some of their
favorite television programs. Hence,
the replication of television-like events
is coming forth in real life on the Stan
ford campus.
"Iron Chef'
The show "Iron Chef' on the Food
Network created quite the stir nation
wide as incomprehensible foreigners
battled for supremacy on the cooking
stage. Stanford has decided to take this
competition and make it our own
through the Stanford Dining and Stan
ford Cooking Club co-sponsored stu
dent Iron Chef competition. After see
ing the pros go at it on TV, Stanford stu
dents are given the opportunity to prove
their cooking prowess before a Univer

sity-wide audience at Wilbur Dining.
The judging team will consist of facul
ty members — possibilities include Uni
versity President John Hennessy, possi
bly a local chef from Spago in Palo Alto,
Stanford Dining chefs and students.
The student version of the competi
tion began last year when current
sophomore Aron Hegyi approached
Associate Director of Residential Din
ing Rafi Taherian and Wilbur Dining's
executive chef from last year, Bruce
Biron. Although there had traditionally
been Iron Chef competitions between
Stanford Dining chefs, student partici
pation had been strangely absent.
Hegyi worked with Stanford Dining
and the competition was held at the end of
May, with three teams of students partici
pating. Hegyi and his teammate sopho
more Emi Adachi won the competition —
which was measured by student votes —
with their recipe and preparation of prof
iteroles (cream puffs filled with ice cream)
and bananas foster (bananas flamed with
butter, brown sugar and rum).
This year, the competition is set to
make its second annual debut at the
end of April. Hegyi and the Stanford
