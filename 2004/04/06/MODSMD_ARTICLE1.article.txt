# ASSU candidates canvass for student votes
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
With student apathy and ignorance about
campus elections a major challenge facing
those campaigning to be ASSU president, can
didates have described their strategy as reach
ing out to as many students as possible.
The three slates on the ballot are junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore Alyssa
Schwartz, senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan
Mefford, and senior Charlie Stockman and ju
nior Matthew Henick.
Both the Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-
Mefford slates are relying on past involve
ment with student groups and personal con
nections to students as well as talking to as
many new students as they can. They char
acterized their campaigns as grassroots ef
forts, employing the help of friends
and supporters.
Lee Mefford has been trying to connect
with as many students as possible through fly
ering, banners, T-shirts and its Web site. The
candidates are supported by nearly 100 volun
teers and have also e-mailed over 500 stu
dents who they know personally.
"It's very grassroots," Lee said. "People
tell their friends, wear a shirt, put a flyer on
their door."
Husbands described his campaign strate
gy as being "personal" with students, meet
ing with various student groups, student
leaders and dorms.
"Our whole platform is based on repre
senting students, so we needed to know what
they wanted, so we needed to meet with
them," Husbands said. "Flyers can only do so

much. It's about getting yourself out there."
Some students said that Husbands-
Schwartz has been more successful at getting
heard around campus and having a presence
through their flyers.
Freshman Raylene Young said that she has
heard Husbands and Schwartz speak in her
dorm and at Freshman Council and has read
their flyers, although her vote is still undecided.

However, sophomore Nicole Nicholas
said that the Husbands-Schwartz slogan and
platform of reaching out to students has con
vinced her to vote for them.
"I've only noticed the Husbands-Schwartz
flyers," she said. "His campaign convinced
me because it is very visual and he has been
out there to get students."
Lee said that while he is confident that his
platform is stronger than his competition's
platform, communicating it is a major chal
lenge of the campaign.
"Campaigning is a fine balance of visibili
ty and content," Lee said. "We have a lot of
content, and we're trying to get the visibility
out there."
While most students have noticed the
campaign posters around campus, some say
they have not learned much about candi
dates' platforms from those posters.
"Most campaign posters just say 'Vote
for blank,"' sophomore Alex Pang said. He
said that the candidates have not done a
good job of exposing students to their cam
paign issues.
Husbands said student ignorance about
the election process was the most challenging
part of the campaign.
"There is a gray area about what are we
running for," Husbands said, particularly the
difference between the class president, ASSU
senator and ASSU executive elections.
Even for students who do know the candi
dates' platforms, many said they found the
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford plat
forms very similar.
"I wish candidates would find issues
where they have opposing viewpoints, and
