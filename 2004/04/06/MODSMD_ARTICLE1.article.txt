# ASSU candidates canvass for student votes
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
With student apathy and ignorance about
campus elections a major challenge facing
those campaigning to be ASSU president, can
didates have described their strategy as reach
ing out to as many students as possible.
The three slates on the ballot are junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore Alyssa
Schwartz, senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan
Mefford, and senior Charlie Stockman and ju
nior Matthew Henick.
Both the Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-
Mefford slates are relying on past involve
ment with student groups and personal con
nections to students as well as talking to as
many new students as they can. They char
acterized their campaigns as grassroots ef
forts, employing the help of friends
and supporters.
Lee Mefford has been trying to connect
with as many students as possible through fly
ering, banners, T-shirts and its Web site. The
candidates are supported by nearly 100 volun
teers and have also e-mailed over 500 stu
dents who they know personally.
"It's very grassroots," Lee said. "People
tell their friends, wear a shirt, put a flyer on
their door."
Husbands described his campaign strate
gy as being "personal" with students, meet
ing with various student groups, student
leaders and dorms.
"Our whole platform is based on repre
senting students, so we needed to know what
they wanted, so we needed to meet with
them," Husbands said. "Flyers can only do so

much. It's about getting yourself out there."
Some students said that Husbands-
Schwartz has been more successful at getting
heard around campus and having a presence
through their flyers.
Freshman Raylene Young said that she has
heard Husbands and Schwartz speak in her
dorm and at Freshman Council and has read
their flyers, although her vote is still undecided.

However, sophomore Nicole Nicholas
said that the Husbands-Schwartz slogan and
platform of reaching out to students has con
vinced her to vote for them.
"I've only noticed the Husbands-Schwartz
flyers," she said. "His campaign convinced
me because it is very visual and he has been
out there to get students."
Lee said that while he is confident that his
platform is stronger than his competition's
platform, communicating it is a major chal
lenge of the campaign.
"Campaigning is a fine balance of visibili
ty and content," Lee said. "We have a lot of
content, and we're trying to get the visibility
out there."
While most students have noticed the
campaign posters around campus, some say
they have not learned much about candi
dates' platforms from those posters.
"Most campaign posters just say 'Vote
for blank,"' sophomore Alex Pang said. He
said that the candidates have not done a
good job of exposing students to their cam
paign issues.
Husbands said student ignorance about
the election process was the most challenging
part of the campaign.
"There is a gray area about what are we
running for," Husbands said, particularly the
difference between the class president, ASSU
senator and ASSU executive elections.
Even for students who do know the candi
dates' platforms, many said they found the
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford plat
forms very similar.
"I wish candidates would find issues
where they have opposing viewpoints, and

distinguish themselves accord
ingly," Pang said. "That way,
voters might make more educat
ed decisions."
For some students, however,
the presidential election is not so
much about the candidates' plat
forms as it is which candidates
they know personally.
"I know Husbands, so I am bi
ased," said junior Randy DeVaul,
who is supporting Husbands-
Schwartz. "Some people do care,
but other people are just voting
for their friends. Do you really pay
attention to the campaign?"
DeVaul said that he gets
caught up his day-to-day life, so is
unaware of details like who candi
dates are meeting with and what is
going on.
Pang said he is supporting
Lee-Mefford because he knows
Lee personally, and he is im
pressed by his experience as Se
nior Class president.
Lee expressed his concern that
voters will vote without taking the
time to understand the candi
dates' platforms.
"We need to find that balance
of reaching as many people as
possible without selling votes,"
Lee said.
Students who have taken the
time to look at the various cam
paign Web sites said they have
found them informative.
Junior Huey Kwik said he has
learned about the candidates
from their respective Web sites.

He said the Lee-Mefford site
seemed more credible and was
more informative.
While the tactics of the Hus
bands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford
campaigns are fairly similar.
Stockman and Henick — both
staff writers for the Stanford
Chapparal — have been taking a
more unconventional approach.
Stockman said their campaign
strategy is kissing babies, recent
ly modified to kissing old people
as well.
Though he admitted that they
have printed a few flyers, Stock
man emphasized that they were
merely academic exercises.
"We have printed a few flyers
with recycled paper that people
thought were both insightful and
funny," Stockman said. "We have
no banner, but we are telling peo
ple what it would have said."
Stockman also ran for ASSU
vice president last year and is em
ploying some of the same tactics.
This year, he said he is taking a
healthier approach of distributing
snacks by handing out produce
from his own garden rather than
cigarette donuts as he did last
year. The two are also staging
reenactments, possibly of the war
on poverty, have been organizing
"flash mobs" and had a rally
where they tried to tip over
Hoover Tower.
Stockman and Henick com
mented they feel a lack of enthusi
asm in this year's campaign.
Stockman cited that there were no
fistfights in White Plaza when the
clock struck midnight on the day
campaigning officially began.
Typically, candidates compete for
the most visible flyer positions.

"I almost had to put up posters
because there were empty spaces
where nobody else had put theirs
up," he said.
Stockman said the most chal
lenging part of the campaign has
been "dealing with the other can
didates' bullshit."
He said, "It's hard to break
out of the web of lies and catch
words people have set up. If we
played that game, we would win,
but we wouldn't be able to live
with ourselves."
With the election starting to
morrow, the candidates said they
are going to continue using the
same strategies that they have
been employing, which for Lee-
Mefford and Husbands-Schwartz
means to continue trying to talk to
as many students as they can.
"We are stepping up and being
out there even more, if that is pos
sible," Husbands said.
"We need to get our content
out to students, and we need to
get them to vote," Lee said.
"Students should elect who they
think is going to best represent
what they want, and we think we
best represent what students
want and can have. If we don't
gel the word out there, that's
our fault."
However, the question seems to
be whether the candidates' efforts
will be persuasive enough to get
students to care enough to vote.
"It'd be great if there could be
some way to get people to care
more about ASSU elections, but
quite frankly, I don't see that hap
pening in the near future," Kwik
said. "I can't really say I care a
whole lot, either."

quite frankly, I don't see that hap

said. "I can't really say I care a
whole lot, either."
With student apathy and ignorance about
campus elections a major challenge facing
those campaigning to be ASSU president, can
didates have described their strategy as reach
ing out to as many students as possible.
The three slates on the ballot are junior
Ajani Husbands and sophomore Alyssa
Schwartz, senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan
Mefford, and senior Charlie Stockman and ju
nior Matthew Henick.
Both the Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-
Mefford slates are relying on past involve
ment with student groups and personal con
nections to students as well as talking to as
many new students as they can. They char
acterized their campaigns as grassroots ef
forts, employing the help of friends
and supporters.
Lee Mefford has been trying to connect
with as many students as possible through fly
ering, banners, T-shirts and its Web site. The
candidates are supported by nearly 100 volun
teers and have also e-mailed over 500 stu
dents who they know personally.
"It's very grassroots," Lee said. "People
tell their friends, wear a shirt, put a flyer on
their door."
Husbands described his campaign strate
gy as being "personal" with students, meet
ing with various student groups, student
leaders and dorms.
"Our whole platform is based on repre
senting students, so we needed to know what
they wanted, so we needed to meet with
them," Husbands said. "Flyers can only do so

much. It's about getting yourself out there."
Some students said that Husbands-
Schwartz has been more successful at getting
heard around campus and having a presence
through their flyers.
Freshman Raylene Young said that she has
heard Husbands and Schwartz speak in her
dorm and at Freshman Council and has read
their flyers, although her vote is still undecided.

However, sophomore Nicole Nicholas
said that the Husbands-Schwartz slogan and
platform of reaching out to students has con
vinced her to vote for them.
"I've only noticed the Husbands-Schwartz
flyers," she said. "His campaign convinced
me because it is very visual and he has been
out there to get students."
Lee said that while he is confident that his
platform is stronger than his competition's
platform, communicating it is a major chal
lenge of the campaign.
"Campaigning is a fine balance of visibili
ty and content," Lee said. "We have a lot of
content, and we're trying to get the visibility
out there."
While most students have noticed the
campaign posters around campus, some say
they have not learned much about candi
dates' platforms from those posters.
"Most campaign posters just say 'Vote
for blank,"' sophomore Alex Pang said. He
said that the candidates have not done a
good job of exposing students to their cam
paign issues.
Husbands said student ignorance about
the election process was the most challenging
part of the campaign.
"There is a gray area about what are we
running for," Husbands said, particularly the
difference between the class president, ASSU
senator and ASSU executive elections.
Even for students who do know the candi
dates' platforms, many said they found the
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford plat
forms very similar.
"I wish candidates would find issues
where they have opposing viewpoints, and

distinguish themselves accord
ingly," Pang said. "That way,
voters might make more educat
ed decisions."
For some students, however,
the presidential election is not so
much about the candidates' plat
forms as it is which candidates
they know personally.
"I know Husbands, so I am bi
ased," said junior Randy DeVaul,
who is supporting Husbands-
Schwartz. "Some people do care,
but other people are just voting
for their friends. Do you really pay
attention to the campaign?"
DeVaul said that he gets
caught up his day-to-day life, so is
unaware of details like who candi
dates are meeting with and what is
going on.
Pang said he is supporting
Lee-Mefford because he knows
Lee personally, and he is im
pressed by his experience as Se
nior Class president.
Lee expressed his concern that
voters will vote without taking the
time to understand the candi
dates' platforms.
"We need to find that balance
of reaching as many people as
possible without selling votes,"
Lee said.
Students who have taken the
time to look at the various cam
paign Web sites said they have
found them informative.
Junior Huey Kwik said he has
learned about the candidates
from their respective Web sites.

He said the Lee-Mefford site
seemed more credible and was
more informative.
While the tactics of the Hus
bands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford
campaigns are fairly similar.
Stockman and Henick — both
staff writers for the Stanford
Chapparal — have been taking a
more unconventional approach.
Stockman said their campaign
strategy is kissing babies, recent
ly modified to kissing old people
as well.
Though he admitted that they
have printed a few flyers, Stock
man emphasized that they were
merely academic exercises.
"We have printed a few flyers
with recycled paper that people
thought were both insightful and
funny," Stockman said. "We have
no banner, but we are telling peo
ple what it would have said."
Stockman also ran for ASSU
vice president last year and is em
ploying some of the same tactics.
This year, he said he is taking a
healthier approach of distributing
snacks by handing out produce
from his own garden rather than
cigarette donuts as he did last
year. The two are also staging
reenactments, possibly of the war
on poverty, have been organizing
"flash mobs" and had a rally
where they tried to tip over
Hoover Tower.
Stockman and Henick com
mented they feel a lack of enthusi
asm in this year's campaign.
Stockman cited that there were no
fistfights in White Plaza when the
clock struck midnight on the day
campaigning officially began.
Typically, candidates compete for
the most visible flyer positions.

"I almost had to put up posters
because there were empty spaces
where nobody else had put theirs
up," he said.
Stockman said the most chal
lenging part of the campaign has
been "dealing with the other can
didates' bullshit."
He said, "It's hard to break
out of the web of lies and catch
words people have set up. If we
played that game, we would win,
but we wouldn't be able to live
with ourselves."
With the election starting to
morrow, the candidates said they
are going to continue using the
same strategies that they have
been employing, which for Lee-
Mefford and Husbands-Schwartz
means to continue trying to talk to
as many students as they can.
"We are stepping up and being
out there even more, if that is pos
sible," Husbands said.
"We need to get our content
out to students, and we need to
get them to vote," Lee said.
"Students should elect who they
think is going to best represent
what they want, and we think we
best represent what students
want and can have. If we don't
gel the word out there, that's
our fault."
However, the question seems to
be whether the candidates' efforts
will be persuasive enough to get
students to care enough to vote.
"It'd be great if there could be
some way to get people to care
