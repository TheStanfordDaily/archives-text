# Innovation
## Interns with ideas IBM's Extreme Blue encourages entrepreneurship 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The tagline, "Start something
BIG!" gives an accurate description
of the IBM Extreme Blue intern
ship program. Last summer, there
were 74 patents filed by some 100
college student interns. The pro
gram culminates with a trip to IBM
headquarters to pitch to CEO Sam
Palmisano and senior executives.
"Extreme Blue is a combina
tion of great talent, great technolo
gy and great innovation," said Paul
Baffes, projects manager for IBM
Extreme Blue. "You really can't
separate one from the other. The

program is designed to give great
innovation to IBM at the time as
bringing great talent to IBM."
The Stanford chapter of the
Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronics Engineers (lEEE), brought
a presentation about Extreme
Blue to campus last quarter.
"I think that Stanford's lEEE
members and other Stanford stu
dents loved the presentation and the
passion of IBM's Extreme Blue re
cruiters," said Dmitry Belogolovsky,
a junior majoring in computer sci
ence, who helped put on the event.
According to Baffes, students
are able to tackle problems from a dif
ferent point of view, which is valuable

to IBM.
"It's interesting that it's the
fresh young talent that makes a big
difference in great innovation," he
said. "When we first started the
program. I don't know if that was
obvious. But once you think about
it, you think about how people can
get stuck in a rut when they're in an
industry fora lot of years, no mat
ter how smart they are. It's amaz
ing how important it is to get a
fresh perspective. We found that
having the fresh talent come in
leads to far better innovation."
Projects that are chosen for Ex
treme Blue must pass several tests
before they are selected. This is to

ensure that interns
are both challenged
and able to accom
plish significant
progress on a project.
"We look for pro
jects that are asking a
key strategic question
fora market that is
emerging," Baffes
said. "Twelve weeks is
not a lot of time, and
you can't build Rome
in a day. What you can
do is [answer] the
questions that are
keeping [you] up at
night. Usually it's a
feasibility test. 'Will a
customer buy this?'
'Can I actually build
this thing?' 'What
business model will re
ally resonate with the
marketplace?'"
Each team con
sists of three engi
neering interns and
one MBA. The team
operates as a small
startup, looking at a
technical problem in
a business context.
"The other key
criteria for us is that a
project has to have
both a business and
technical flavor,"
Baffes said. "Histori
cally, a lot of mistakes
have been made be
cause projects get lop
sided. They either
focus on just the tech
nology and no one
wants [the product] or
on the business and [it
relies on something]
we can't build. The
projects that are the
best for us are not
fully defined. They're
looking for the team

to come in and be creative."
Being selected for Extreme
Blue is challenging. For 12 labs
worldwide, four of which are in
the United States, over 2,000
students applied for 288 intern
ships. The hiring rate is similar
to Stanford's acceptance rate of
12 percent.
Working on real projects in a
real business environment draws
people to apply for the program.
"The thing that impresses [the
interns] is that they're working on
something that really matters,"
Baffes said. "These are really impor
tant projects that matter for IBM.
We treat interns as colleagues. At the
end of 12 weeks, we go to headquar
ters, and [the interns] pitch why what
[they] did is going to have an impact
to IBM to as many high level execu
tives as we can find. Most people
want to make a difference, and this
internship is designed for [interns] to
make a difference for IBM."
Belogolovsky, who is an
Extreme Blue intern this sum
mer, agreed.
"I learned about Extreme Blue
from alumni of the program and
immediately fell in love with it,"he
said. "In school, you work on prob
lem sets and write programs fora
class, programs that no one really
cares about; at Extreme Blue, you
start something big, something real.
That's the difference."
Extreme Blue also brings ben
efits to IBM employees.
"Every project has interns, who
are external people that come to work
for the summer, and mentors, who are
IBMers who come and work on the
project," Baffes said. "For the men
tors that participate, it allows them to
get away from their day-to-day activi
ties and back into the think-tank envi
ronment and get rejuvenated."
It can be difficult to see the full
impact IBM has on the market be
cause they rarely develop con
sumer applications.
"IBM tends to build the 'mid
dle-ware' kinds of products," Baffes
said. "Every time you go to an ATM
anywhere in the world, you're using
IBM software. IBM doesn't build
the end-user applications; we build
what supports everything that hap
pens. You see the tip of the iceberg,
we're the iceberg."
Before joining IBM in
2001, Baffes was a college profes
sor, founder and CEO of his own
company and an award-winning in
ventor (NASA's 1995 Inventor of
the Year). Baffes has a bachelor's
degree from Harvard and a doctor
ate from the University of Texas
at Austin.

not a lot of time, and
you can't build Rome
in a day. What you can
do is [answer] the
questions that are
keeping [you] up at
night. Usually it's a
feasibility test. 'Will a
customer buy this?'
'Can I actually build
this thing?' 'What
business model will re
ally resonate with the

Each team con
sists of three engi
neering interns and
one MBA. The team
operates as a small

technical problem in
a business context.
"The other key
criteria for us is that a
project has to have
both a business and
technical flavor,"
Baffes said. "Histori
cally, a lot of mistakes
have been made be
cause projects get lop
sided. They either
focus on just the tech
nology and no one
wants [the product] or
on the business and [it
relies on something]
we can't build. The
projects that are the
best for us are not
fully defined. They're
looking for the team

to come in and be creative."
Being selected for Extreme
Blue is challenging. For 12 labs
worldwide, four of which are in
the United States, over 2,000
students applied for 288 intern
ships. The hiring rate is similar
to Stanford's acceptance rate of
12 percent.
Working on real projects in a
real business environment draws
people to apply for the program.
"The thing that impresses [the
interns] is that they're working on
something that really matters,"
Baffes said. "These are really impor
tant projects that matter for IBM.
We treat interns as colleagues. At the
end of 12 weeks, we go to headquar
ters, and [the interns] pitch why what
[they] did is going to have an impact
to IBM to as many high level execu
tives as we can find. Most people
want to make a difference, and this
internship is designed for [interns] to
make a difference for IBM."
Belogolovsky, who is an
Extreme Blue intern this sum
mer, agreed.
"I learned about Extreme Blue
from alumni of the program and
immediately fell in love with it,"he
said. "In school, you work on prob
lem sets and write programs fora
class, programs that no one really
cares about; at Extreme Blue, you
start something big, something real.
That's the difference."
Extreme Blue also brings ben
efits to IBM employees.
"Every project has interns, who
are external people that come to work
for the summer, and mentors, who are
IBMers who come and work on the
project," Baffes said. "For the men
tors that participate, it allows them to
get away from their day-to-day activi
ties and back into the think-tank envi
ronment and get rejuvenated."
It can be difficult to see the full
impact IBM has on the market be
cause they rarely develop con
sumer applications.
"IBM tends to build the 'mid
dle-ware' kinds of products," Baffes
said. "Every time you go to an ATM
anywhere in the world, you're using
IBM software. IBM doesn't build
the end-user applications; we build
what supports everything that hap
pens. You see the tip of the iceberg,
we're the iceberg."
Before joining IBM in
2001, Baffes was a college profes
sor, founder and CEO of his own
company and an award-winning in
ventor (NASA's 1995 Inventor of
the Year). Baffes has a bachelor's
degree from Harvard and a doctor

The tagline, "Start something
BIG!" gives an accurate description
of the IBM Extreme Blue intern
ship program. Last summer, there
were 74 patents filed by some 100
college student interns. The pro
gram culminates with a trip to IBM
headquarters to pitch to CEO Sam
Palmisano and senior executives.
"Extreme Blue is a combina
tion of great talent, great technolo
gy and great innovation," said Paul
Baffes, projects manager for IBM
Extreme Blue. "You really can't
separate one from the other. The

program is designed to give great
innovation to IBM at the time as
bringing great talent to IBM."
The Stanford chapter of the
Institute of Electrical and Elec
tronics Engineers (lEEE), brought
a presentation about Extreme
Blue to campus last quarter.
"I think that Stanford's lEEE
members and other Stanford stu
dents loved the presentation and the
passion of IBM's Extreme Blue re
cruiters," said Dmitry Belogolovsky,
a junior majoring in computer sci
ence, who helped put on the event.
According to Baffes, students
are able to tackle problems from a dif
ferent point of view, which is valuable

to IBM.
"It's interesting that it's the
fresh young talent that makes a big
difference in great innovation," he
said. "When we first started the
program. I don't know if that was
obvious. But once you think about
it, you think about how people can
get stuck in a rut when they're in an
industry fora lot of years, no mat
ter how smart they are. It's amaz
ing how important it is to get a
fresh perspective. We found that
having the fresh talent come in
leads to far better innovation."
Projects that are chosen for Ex
treme Blue must pass several tests
before they are selected. This is to

ensure that interns
are both challenged
and able to accom
plish significant
progress on a project.
"We look for pro
jects that are asking a
key strategic question
fora market that is
emerging," Baffes
said. "Twelve weeks is
not a lot of time, and
you can't build Rome
in a day. What you can
do is [answer] the
questions that are
keeping [you] up at
night. Usually it's a
feasibility test. 'Will a
