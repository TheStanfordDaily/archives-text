## Malaria Decoded, Data Reloaded 
### 
Turbulent black hole
New observations of the supermassive black hole at the cen
ter of the Milky Way reveal a very turbulent region. Previously
astronomers thought matter disappeared into this black hole in
an orderly flow. However, the region seems to be erratically
emitting copious amount of x-ray radiation, which suggests not
everything is going smoothly. These results are surprising. Typi
cally, younger black holes are more turbulent than older ones
and the Milky Way's black hole is thought to be

pretty mature.
Malaria genome decoded
An international consortium of scientists has
finished decoding the malaria genome. The pro
ject took six years and $15 million to complete.
The results, published in last month's Nature,
showed that the malaria parasite genome en
codes about 5,000 proteins. Currently, we know
the function of only a fraction. Scientists hope
that decoding the genome will lead to develop-

ing better drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Malaria afflicts over
500 million humans every year.
Australian biotech
Three Australian biotech companies recently announced a
partnership to accelerate Australia's booming biotech industry.
Specifically these companies agreed to unite their forces in com
mercializing ddRNAi, a breakthrough gene silencing technology.
This technique induces RNA interference, which negates the ef
fects of targeted genes within cells. Potential applications of this
technology include treating diseases such as cancer, auto-immune
disorders and viral infections by shutting down or suppressing the
genes that cause them. There are already similar applications
helping plants and animals defend against diseases.
Ocean pollution may not be human-induced
According to a report in Environmental Science & Technolo
gy, humans may not be solely responsible for mercury pollution in
the oceans. The study tracked yellowish tuna caught off the coast
of Hawaii during the last 27 years and found their mercury levels
have not changed despite the considerable increase of mercury in
the atmosphere. The findings imply that mercury in the fishes may
be coming from natural sources. The ideal future study would be
to measure mercury levels in water directly but there is no ade
quate technique for that as yet.
Easy data storage
Researchers in the United States have invented a new. better
type of electronic memory device combining a common plastic
with silicon. The team discovered that a substance used for coat
ing photographic film and video displays conducts electricity at
low voltages but becomes permanently non-conducting at higher
voltages. Thus, it can be used as a fuse or circuit breaker. In their
memory devices data is written as 0s and Is but channeling voltage
through the fuses allows the writing process to be quicker. The
team hopes to make the product commercially viable within the
next five years.
Stopping light
Physicists in the United States and Russia have developed a
new technique for stopping light. Light travels at 300 million me
ters per second in vacuum but can be slowed or even stopped down
in gases using lasers. For this experiment, the team fired a short
"signal" pulse into a hot gas of rubidium ions being illuminated by
a strong control "beam." What is novel is that this technique re
lies on beams traveling in opposite directions. In the words of team
member Michal Bajcsy, the technique "makes the atoms in the gas
behave like tiny mirrors."
