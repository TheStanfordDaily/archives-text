# iPod brings new tunes to Stanford
## 
### MOHAMMED ABDOOLCARIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There is a new tune in town. Walking down
White Plaza, you might notice a few people wearing
sleek white earplugs connected to a cable that disap
pears mysteriously into their pocket. Another MP3
player with trendy earplugs? Not quite; it's the new
iPod from Apple.
The iPod has become the hottest music device to
listen to. It comes in several models including a 15, 20
and 40 gigabytes, each enough to store your entire col
lection of MP3s.
"The iPod has an even bigger hard-drive than my
computer," said Krista Niles, a junior majoring in En
glish. Niles is "an avid Apple fan - ' and bought both an
Apple powerbook and an iPod.
Compared to other MP3 players, students have
noted unique differences with the iPod. Tory Stewart, a
junior majoring in Interdisciplinary Studies in Humani
ties, found her new iPod to be very portable.
"It fits in everything and I can take it anywhere."
she said.
Niles also said that she could take her iPod every
where. including the gym and the Dish.
"I listen to music in-between classes and even up to
the point when the professor starts talking and I am
forced to turn it off." she added.

Niles emphasized that the iPod has special fea
tures. One of these is the random play feature, which

picks "the right song at the
right time."
"It seems to know ex
actly what I want to hear,"
Niles said.
Actually, this happens
partly because the iPod
software has an algorithm
that remembers the num
ber of times a user plays
a song.
Niles mentioned the
iPod could be useful for her
studies. She used it to play
back audio books from
class. The player can do
much more than play
music. It can play all kinds
of audio files and even dis
play photographs.
Stewart said she
takes her iPod every
where, including biking
and studying, though
claimed that she keeps
the volume down so she

can hear the traffic when biking. She said that
bringing music into Green was very inconvenient

before, but now it
is much better. Stew
art also said that the
iPod was durable. She
once spilled water
on it without causing
any damage.
Students said the
iPod was also worth
while on long drives.
Both Stewart and Niles
have used their iPods
on several occasions
during road trips.
Apple advertises
the iPod as having many
other functions.
David Fedor, an un
declared sophomore,
used his iPod when
doing his weekly house
chores at Ham
marskjold. He plugged
his player into the radio
to play his favorite
music as he was cleaning

the dishes.
The downsides of iPod? For Victor Wong, a fifth
year senior double-majoring in Computer Science and
Economics, it is the price. "At $300 a pop, it simply
isn't worth it." He said he will not buy one until find
ing more functionality and the possibility of combining
the iPod with his phone and camera.
Ashni Mohnot, a junior majoring in an English,
said she would also not buy the iPod. Despite finding
the iPod "sleek and sexy" she said she "[didn't] really
care too much."
Marika Knowles, a senior majoring in English, also
said she would not buy the iPod because she did not
have enough music to make the purchase worth it.
She said nevertheless she found the iPod "very aes
thetically pleasing."
"The iPod is a cool way to organize music packed
into a cute white box and can make my music more
savvy," Knowles said. She added that integrating the
iPod with cars was "like bringing the 21st century to
non-techie cars."
iPod also integrates with Apple's iTunes. iTunes is
a software that allows users to download any music for
99 cents. Niles said she used this feature to see "what
others are listening to nowadays."
What do those people with sleek white plugs walk
ing on White Plaza want in the next iPod? "More cool
colors like the iMac," Stewart said.

She said nevertheless she found the iPod "very aes
thetically pleasing."
"The iPod is a cool way to organize music packed
into a cute white box and can make my music more
savvy," Knowles said. She added that integrating the
iPod with cars was "like bringing the 21st century to
non-techie cars."
iPod also integrates with Apple's iTunes. iTunes is
a software that allows users to download any music for
99 cents. Niles said she used this feature to see "what
others are listening to nowadays."
What do those people with sleek white plugs walk
ing on White Plaza want in the next iPod? "More cool
colors like the iMac," Stewart said.
