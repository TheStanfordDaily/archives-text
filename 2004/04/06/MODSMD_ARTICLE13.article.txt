## ASSU executive election: Choose action over advocacy 
### 
There is a gtxni reason why this year's ASSU
presidential race has not stirred much contro
versy: Either of the two front-running slates
would probably do an adequate job if elected.
Ajani Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz are knowledge
able, personable and very much in touch with the inter
ests and concerns of the student body. Mikey Lee and
Dylan Mefford have extensive political experience and
know how to work with the administration. Unlike the
Chaparral slate — which, to its credit, brings a refreshing
sense of humor to a race that would otherwise be unusu
ally dull — both Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford
have taken the campaign seriously and have done an ad
mirable job putting together coherent platforms.
That's not to say that the two slates are the same, how
ever. Their respective slogans, silly as they might sound,
accurately capture the main difference between the can
didates. Husbands-Schwartz — "With you, for you" —
focus on inclusiveness and process, while Lee / Mefford
— "Getting stuff done" — are oriented toward achieving
tangible results. While neither viewpoint is particularly
groundbreaking, we endorse Lee-Meflord because their
approach is more likely to bring a spark of action and ex
citement to an organization that has historically suffered
from stagnation.
There is a basic philosophical difference between
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford. Lee and Mefford
see the ASSU as an organization with the explicit power
toaccomplish certain concrete goals, while Husbands and
Schwartz view it primarily as a forum for student advoca
cy on long-term issues. Schwartz was chair of the Senate
Advocacy Committee, and many of the goals she and
Husbands have articulated are advocacy projects like
pushing for student space, improving advising and in
creasing faculty diversity. These are all admirable goals,
and they retlect the wishes of many in the community. But
wishes, even the wishes of the ASSU president and vice
president, are not easily converted into results.
Asked what they would accomplish in the first two
months of their term, the slate listed two or three projects
that are already underway thanks to the current
Figueroa-Natoli administration. Their Web site contains
a large list of other issues they plan to work on, many of
them perennial buzzwords like transparency and cost of
living. We believe that Husbands and Schwartz have a
genuine concern about these issues, but so have plenty of
previous administrations that have failed to effect signifi
cant change. It is not clear that Husbands and Schwartz
have an understanding of how to translate noble aims into
real progress, or the tenacity toovercome the University's
powerful bureaucratic inertia.

Daily '.v editor in chief, two opinions editors and six community members at-large. Signed columns and
contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

Nor have Husbands and Schwartz fully articulated the
ramifications of all their promises. For instance, one of
their stated goals is to increase diversity by "mak| ing] sure
the Board of Trustees realize that tuition hikes negative
ly affect students." Surely the Board realizes this, but they
continue to raise tuition in order to offset the rising costs
of financial aid to families who are unable to pay. Even if
Husbands and Schwartz were right that increases in tu
ition limit diversity, the ASSU executive lacks the au
thority to influence the Board's decisions.
The main problem with the ASSU is not that it fails to
represent student opinion on long-term issues like diver
sity and student space, but that it fails to pursue goals that
are within its power. Lee and Mefford seem to recognize
this. Their proposals are specific, and in most cases they
have already met with University administrators to figure
out how to implement them. When they proposed to cre
ate a matching-grants program to sponsor ASSU Abso
lute Fun programs by dormitories, ethnic organizations
and other campus groups, they also met with key admin
istrators to ensure that the policy was feasible and could
quickly be put into effect. Their ability and willingness to
do such legwork indicates that they will likely be better
equipped to fulfill their campaign promises than many
past ASSU leaders.
Even when there is a particularly skilled and effective
executive slate, such as Figueroa-Natoli this year, it typi
cally struggles to communicate its accomplishments to
the student body at large. We believe Lee and Mefford
would not only set and meet worthwhile goals, but also
convey them well to their constituents and receive feed
back in return. Lee's current position as a Senior Class
president is quite different from the role of ASSU presi
dent, but his work on the Senior Class Web site and e-mail
list is evidence of a talent for communication — possibly
the most important skill a student leader can possess.
In contrast to Husbands' easygoing campaign style,
Lee's feistiness makes him less likely to simply uphold the
status quo. It can also be a flaw, but too much passion and
conviction is the kind of Haw that the ASSU could stand
to have more of. For his part, Mefford may turn off some
voters with his glad-handing, always-political demeanor,
but his knowledge of the ASSU and familiarity with a
broad range of campus groups make him a valuable run
ning mate for Lee. In a way, we wish that Lee had run with
Schwartz, who possesses the same sort of insider under
standing as Mefford but comes across as more genuine.
But second-guessing the composition of the slates is use
less. Of the available options, all have merits and flaws,
but Lee and Mefford are best positioned to make a posi
tive impact on Stanford students.

the most important skill a student leader can possess.
In contrast to Husbands' easygoing campaign style,
Lee's feistiness makes him less likely to simply uphold the
status quo. It can also be a flaw, but too much passion and
conviction is the kind of Haw that the ASSU could stand
to have more of. For his part, Mefford may turn off some
voters with his glad-handing, always-political demeanor,
but his knowledge of the ASSU and familiarity with a
broad range of campus groups make him a valuable run
ning mate for Lee. In a way, we wish that Lee had run with
Schwartz, who possesses the same sort of insider under
standing as Mefford but comes across as more genuine.
But second-guessing the composition of the slates is use
less. Of the available options, all have merits and flaws,
but Lee and Mefford are best positioned to make a posi
tive impact on Stanford students.
There is a gtxni reason why this year's ASSU
presidential race has not stirred much contro
versy: Either of the two front-running slates
would probably do an adequate job if elected.
Ajani Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz are knowledge
able, personable and very much in touch with the inter
ests and concerns of the student body. Mikey Lee and
Dylan Mefford have extensive political experience and
know how to work with the administration. Unlike the
Chaparral slate — which, to its credit, brings a refreshing
sense of humor to a race that would otherwise be unusu
ally dull — both Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford
have taken the campaign seriously and have done an ad
mirable job putting together coherent platforms.
That's not to say that the two slates are the same, how
ever. Their respective slogans, silly as they might sound,
accurately capture the main difference between the can
didates. Husbands-Schwartz — "With you, for you" —
focus on inclusiveness and process, while Lee / Mefford
— "Getting stuff done" — are oriented toward achieving
tangible results. While neither viewpoint is particularly
groundbreaking, we endorse Lee-Meflord because their
approach is more likely to bring a spark of action and ex
citement to an organization that has historically suffered
from stagnation.
There is a basic philosophical difference between
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford. Lee and Mefford
see the ASSU as an organization with the explicit power
toaccomplish certain concrete goals, while Husbands and
Schwartz view it primarily as a forum for student advoca
cy on long-term issues. Schwartz was chair of the Senate
Advocacy Committee, and many of the goals she and
Husbands have articulated are advocacy projects like
pushing for student space, improving advising and in
creasing faculty diversity. These are all admirable goals,
and they retlect the wishes of many in the community. But
wishes, even the wishes of the ASSU president and vice
president, are not easily converted into results.
Asked what they would accomplish in the first two
months of their term, the slate listed two or three projects
that are already underway thanks to the current
Figueroa-Natoli administration. Their Web site contains
a large list of other issues they plan to work on, many of
them perennial buzzwords like transparency and cost of
living. We believe that Husbands and Schwartz have a
genuine concern about these issues, but so have plenty of
previous administrations that have failed to effect signifi
cant change. It is not clear that Husbands and Schwartz
have an understanding of how to translate noble aims into
real progress, or the tenacity toovercome the University's
powerful bureaucratic inertia.

Nor have Husbands and Schwartz fully articulated the
ramifications of all their promises. For instance, one of
their stated goals is to increase diversity by "mak| ing] sure
the Board of Trustees realize that tuition hikes negative
ly affect students." Surely the Board realizes this, but they
continue to raise tuition in order to offset the rising costs
of financial aid to families who are unable to pay. Even if
Husbands and Schwartz were right that increases in tu
ition limit diversity, the ASSU executive lacks the au
thority to influence the Board's decisions.
The main problem with the ASSU is not that it fails to
represent student opinion on long-term issues like diver
sity and student space, but that it fails to pursue goals that
are within its power. Lee and Mefford seem to recognize
this. Their proposals are specific, and in most cases they
have already met with University administrators to figure
out how to implement them. When they proposed to cre
ate a matching-grants program to sponsor ASSU Abso
lute Fun programs by dormitories, ethnic organizations
and other campus groups, they also met with key admin
istrators to ensure that the policy was feasible and could
quickly be put into effect. Their ability and willingness to
do such legwork indicates that they will likely be better
equipped to fulfill their campaign promises than many
past ASSU leaders.
Even when there is a particularly skilled and effective
executive slate, such as Figueroa-Natoli this year, it typi
cally struggles to communicate its accomplishments to
the student body at large. We believe Lee and Mefford
would not only set and meet worthwhile goals, but also
convey them well to their constituents and receive feed
back in return. Lee's current position as a Senior Class
president is quite different from the role of ASSU presi
dent, but his work on the Senior Class Web site and e-mail
list is evidence of a talent for communication — possibly
the most important skill a student leader can possess.
