## RIAA lawsuits help terrorists 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
It's a cliche these days: The Bush
drug czar says smoking pot helps
terrorists; John Ashcroft says Sen
ate oversight of the Justice Depart
ment helps terrorists and Arianna
Huffington says driving SUVs helps
terrorists. Why shouldn't file-swap
ping college students jump on the
bandwagon and accuse the recent
crackdown on file-sharing as help
ing the terrorists?
It's a fact. Though deterring on
line music piracy is a worthy goal,
the new lawsuits launched by the
Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA) against alleged
music sharers will have little effect
on piracy and will significantly hin
der U.S. antiterrorism efforts.
To explain why, a quick look at
the history of file-swapping is in
order. The first major peer-to
peer network, Napster, featured
centralized servers that processed
users' searches. When the RIAA
sued them for aiding copyright in
fringement, the servers were
quickly shut down. Two types of
successors jumped in to fill the
gap. First were overseas servers,
who hoped (mostly in vain) to
stay beyond the reach of the long
arm of U.S. law enforcement. Sec
ond, architectures such as Gnutel
la and Kazaa avoided law en
forcement by decentralizing
search functions, making users re
sponsible for searching as well as
transfer, sharing and storage.
Within just a few months, millions
of users had adopted the new
technology to sidestep to the
RIAA's legal assault.
Lacking central search servers
to attack, the RIAA's new tactic is
to sue individual users who allow
others to copy their music illegally.
For the moment, this may scare a
handful of users away from music

sharing. But inevitably the market
will adjust to this legal attack.
With approximately a hundred
million users out there, there is a
large incentive to provide a file
swapping technology with which
users feel comfortable.
Time and again, the authors of
music-sharing programs have man
aged to stay one step ahead of the
law. If the RIAA lawsuits continue,
the outcome will likely be a switch
to something like Freenet, a tech
nology promoted by cyber-libertar
ians that makes it impossible to
trace the author, origin, destination
and content of documents. Individ
ual Freenet users have no way of
even knowing what files they are
storing, effectively blocking any as
signment of responsibility for con
tent. Two million users have al
ready downloaded the software.
Even if Freenet itself is not the next
big file-swapping technology, what
ever replaces Kazaa and Gnutella
will surely rival Freenet in encryp
tion and anonymity.
Currently, the bulk of encrypted
traffic on the Internet is within the
government or between known
companies. The National Security
Agency is able to monitor or selec
tively decrypt much of the rest. If
the RIAA lawsuits continue, mil
lions of college students are going
to start using strong encryption to
pass terabytes of MP3s across the
Internet. The computers at the
NSA will be completely over
whelmed. Not only will they be un
able to determine who is copying il
legal MP3s, they will also not pick
up conversations among terrorists
planning new bombings, hijackings
or other attacks.
Freenet's proponents argue that
it makes censorship almost impossi
ble and point to its growing use in
China and the Middle East, where it
addresses a real need. Yet secure,

anonymous communication tech
nology is not an unmitigated good.
There are tradeoffs in limiting gov
ernments' capacity to monitor com
munication, and these tradeoffs
must be acknowledged.
Hard-core libertarians have ad
vocated that everyone switch to
encrypted e-mail to overwhelm
government computers. A more
balanced perspective might recog
nize that while we don't want the
government spying on what books
we check out of the library, there
are good reasons for the NSA to
monitor some communications. A
smart policy would restrict activi
ties likely to tempt political abuse
and allow those useful in fighting
terrorism. It's difficult to choose
between preventing repeats of the
FBI smear campaign against Mar
tin Luther King, Jr. and other civil
rights leaders and preventing
events like Sept. 11. These trade
offs can only be resolved through
democratic political debate.
But our democratic decision
making process is in danger of
being undermined. If the RIAA
lawsuits continue to intimidate mil
lions of music-swappers, more and
more of them will choose anony
mous, encrypted technology that
allows them to swap music even
more confidently. The only effect
will be that other encrypted traffic,
such as communication among ter
rorists, will also become impossible
for the U.S. government to trace. If
we are going to blindfold the NSA
at the cost of our national security,
it should be a deliberate decision
rather than an unintended conse
quence of an RIAA "sue your
fans" policy that is already doomed
to failure.
