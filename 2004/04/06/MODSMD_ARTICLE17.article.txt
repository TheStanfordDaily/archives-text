## NLCB: no unfunded mandate 
### PAUL E. PETERSON 
It has been said, more than
once, that the No Child Left Be
hind (NCLB) Act is a mandate
that the federal government has
failed to fund. Not true. The law is
neither unfunded nor, with one ex
ception, is it much of a mandate.
On the funding side, it costs
about twenty dollars to test a stu
dent, and administering the test is
the only thing NCLB requires all
schools to do. Meanwhile, federal
dollars have risen steadily since the
law's passage; the average district
now receives three hundred dollars
more per pupil from Washington
than it did in 2000.
Other than this test require
ment, schools are asked only to
show adequate yearly progress to
ward state- (not federally) deter
mined goals.
What are the consequences of
failing to make this progress?
Not much. If a school fails for
two years running, the only re
quirement is to let its students
transfer to one of the district's
non-failing schools.
In most cases, inner-city chil
dren are not given access to a sub
urban school, a private school or a

charter school outside the dis
trict's boundaries.
Roughly 20 percent of students
in big cities currently attend "fail
ing" schools, a percentage certain
to rise as the "adequate yearly
progress" rule becomes increasing
ly stringent. Unless schools im
prove quickly — or states ease
their academic standards — most
big-city schools are in danger of
being defined as failing. With every
school so designated, the choice
mandate vanishes.
The parental demand for
choice remains high. Surveys show
that over a fifth of the parents in
failing schools would like to con
sider an alternative. But in prac
tice, less than one percent of all
students in failing schools are
switching schools. Some hurdles,
such as transportation costs, are
practical. But many school dis
tricts are actively discouraging
parents when they apply. As one
Worcester, Mass., official put it,
"The feds told us we had to offer a
choice, not the parents' choice,
but a choice."
After three years, failing
schools must also give students tu
toring or other extra services. For
this, the federal government is pro

viding more than enough funds to
pay current costs — and still more
money is on its way. The original
idea was to bring new providers
into education to supplement the
work of failed schools, but in many
districts the majority of these ser
vices are being provided by the dis
trict itself.
If schools fail five years in a row,
they are to be "reconstituted." Will
this mandate, at least, have a bite?
Perhaps, but early returns suggest
that it has more the teeth of a min
now than of a shark.
Still, there remains one potent
mandate. Because of the NCLB
testing requirement, parents and
taxpayers are being told, more
clearly than ever, how much stu
dents are learning at school. The
feds are making school officials
and union leaders squirm under
the bright light of continuously
available information about
school performance. What's so
bad about that?
