Research is inherently social
From the comments of students in the ar
ticle '"Potter College' to foster research"
(Mar. 31), I think it's clear that most under
graduate students have an inaccurate per
ception of what doing research is really like.
The idea that research is a very individu
al activity and that Potter College might just
draw people who are anti-social and want to
be left alone to pursue their individual pro
jects is just wrong. As a member of a re
search lab with many people — from high
school students to undergrads to graduate
students to post-docs — I would like every
one to know and be reassured that research
can be extremely team-oriented and very so
cial. Every one of the projects we work on in
our lab involves multiple people working to
gether and discussing ideas on a daily basis.
In addition, we get together with other re
searchers outside of our lab and outside
Stanford on a regular basis to discuss what
we're doing, the issues we're dealing with
and how we might be able to collaborate to
gether. Last but not least, since we're a
bunch of people who have gotten to know
each other, we spend time together socially
as well, whether it's discussing what hap
pened on the latest reality shows or going to
watch one of our members who's a Stanford
athlete compete.

1 believe that all of the undergrads who
have worked in our research group have
come away happy, not only for the actual
work they accomplished, but for the intel
lectual discussions they have had with the
other members of the lab.
Research is about an exchange of ideas
that stimulates deeper thought and a deeper
understanding for everyone. Because of
this, it is naturally a social endeavor. I think
that Potter College is a wonderful idea, and
a great extension of the Summer Research
College that has been doing so well over the
past three years. 1 hope it is a success.

New special-fee refund
process raises questions
I went online to request my ASSU spe
cial-fee refunds today, only to discover that
a system that is already based on the im
moral exploitation of unwitting and / or
lazy students has chosen to amplify its
crime. My guess is that in the wake of high
er refund requests last quarter, the ASSU
decided to increase the obstacles to re
questing a refund, thereby discouraging stu
dents who would not like to fund certain

groups from withdrawing their funding.
These obstacles include forcing a refund-re
questor to check a box explaining why he /
she is requesting the refund from each
group, and also to open up a separate page
and read a description of the soon-to-be im
poverished group. One cannot proceed
through the process without completing
these two steps for every group from which
one wishes to receive a refund.
The special-fee system is ingenious —
cloaked behind the indisputably glorious
nouns and adjectives like "student activi
ties," "campus life" and "service groups,"
who could wish for such things not to be
supported? But the actual structure of the
system is designed expressly and primarily
to take money from students who don't re
ally want to fund all these groups. Why is
the system opt-out, instead of opt-in? Why
is advertising notifying students of fee-re
fund procedures and fee-refund deadlines
almost non-existent? And why these added
obstacles — transparently imposed after a
period in which students finally began to re
alize their exploitation and, albeit only in
crementally, refused to be so taken advan
tage of?
I hope that such a system lives only
shortly in its present form. Barring such a
happy end, I hope to see my objections an
swered intelligently and thoroughly by

those responsible.

Students should reconsider voting
for special-fees groups
I went on-line today to get my ASSU re
fund only to find that "the man" has stuck it
to us. Instead of the old, one-step easy way,
we now have to waste 15 minutes checking
all these boxes and visit sites for each group
we want a refund from.
Now, I have no problem with people
knowing I do not give money to the over
whelming majority of student groups. I feel
that these organizations, for the most part,
are voluntary groups ... like a fraternity.
Fraternity members pay dues, and so
should every other voluntary student orga
nization. Why should we students get stuck
with the bill to support these things we
never partake of?
So attention students, I know elections are
coming up because of the unnecessary paper
all over White Plaza. Well, it is time to let
your voices be heard, do not give special fees
to anything you do not use. Make a statement
that you think that this feel-good, happy
happy joy-joy, bogus situation where any
group that feels like freeloading gets a chance

t0... let them know you are sick of them tak
ing your parents hard-earned money.
But wait, isn't it my moral responsibility
to see that everyone has a chance to do
something productive with their spare time?
No, it isn't. You only need to look out for
yourself. Try a little bit more selfishness and
this campus will be much better. I say, if they
want their New Kids on the Block Fan Club,
they can foot the bill themselves. As for me,
I will keep giving my money to the Sexual
Health Peer Resource Center because con
doms are important. Always use condoms.

Column misrepresents Sting
I don't know who you are, Chris Holt,
and I really don't wish to. How can you be so
rude about Sting ("Spring break with Sting,"
April 5), when it's obvious you haven't seen
him for years? How could someone who is
"obese" according to you be able to do
about one and a half hours of yoga daily?
Don't project your insecurities on others. I
bet you won't look so good at 53, especially
the way your country is going.
