## How Spencer picked his candidates 
### 
I know what you want. I know what you're
searching for, what you're asking for and what
you're voting for. I know you want your presi
dent to host T-ball, your governor to be a body
builder and your favorite Late Night hosts to have
anchored Sports Center.
You want to convince yourself that sports super
stars can hold down an elected position. Knicks fans
want Bill Bradley in the Oval Office. Suns freaks
want Charles Barkley as the Arizona governor.
And. I mean, if Joe Montana ran for anything, I'd
jump on that bandwagon faster than Josh Childress
will leave Stanford for the NBA Draft (*tear).
So what's my point? People, you and me includ
ed, want to think that their favorite sports stars
know a bit more than the pick and roll, the halfback

option or how to sneak a "special
fan" into the locker room fora
post-game "massage." Oh, quote
marks, what can't you insinuate?
Conversely, you want your rep
resentatives to be somewhat athlet
ic. You want John Kerry to be a
weekend warrior, you want George
W. to go on those jogs, and you
WANT ME ON THAT WALL!
(Sorry, couldn't resist.)
But mostly, you want me as
your Senior Class president.
Oh Jesus.

That's right kids. Spencer Porter, along with
Whoserick?, Paola "Bear" Worsley, and Jen "not
Billy" Graham, is running unopposed for Senior
Class president.
And barring a last-second massive write-in cam
paign, we have the election locked up. riding a cam
paign strategy of making senior year of Stanford like
that of high school: antagonizing freshmen, looking
cool, not really caring about classes and Prom. Oh,
and awkward dates highlighted by you spilling apple
cider all over your girl's dress. Especially those.
But enough about me. What I was really doing on
yesterday during lunch, while ostensibly campaign
ing for "Senior High School", was scoping out the
other candidates for any athletic ability.
With a Nerf football in tow, I set out to find which
candidates could really hold a candle in the athletic
department. My vote was dependent on their per
formance. Here are my findings.
11:15 a.m. — I arrive at White Plaza for the can
didate meet-and-greet that is going on between 11
a.m. and 1 p.m. Approximately seven people are
there. Six of them are there for "Kiss Me Kate" —
a show that is hard-pressed to find an audience.
More to follow.
11:18 a.m. — Obviously, the most important
piece of propaganda fora campaign is a white T
shirt with Sharpie written on it. The front of my shirt
now reads "Super Cool Senior", and the back reads,
"Uncool? More like Unopposed!" I am cooler than
water polo.
11:19 a.m. — 1 love this shirt. I cannot stress this
enough. My shirt rocks.
11:27 a.m. —Senate candidate "OShak" has
made it very clear that he "has my back." I'm
slightly disturbed, but tingling with excitement.
No, wait, that's not excitement, that's OShak
fondling me. Yeesh.
11:30 a.m. — Current senior class president and
ASSU presidential candidate Mikey Lee has ar
rived. Upon seeing the football, he immediately
runs an out-and-up route as I deliver a strike.
Touchdown. Vote, Lee.
Let me just take a moment to discuss this "Mikey
Lee" character. As we were playing catch, presiden
tial candidate Charlie Stockman was critiquing his
opponent on a wide array of issues via a megaphone,
ranging from his football skills to his fifth-year status
in the upcoming year.
Of course, just like his proposal to smoke out the
"Serial Groper" so the police can nab him while
high, this is a bag of hot air. While Mikey Lee was
enthusiastic about football, he was no Joe Montana
or even Ryan Leaf.
However, while on the topic, let's just say one
thing about thefacebook.com. Type in Mikey Lee,
and check out how many friends that kid has. Un
believable! 625 at midday on Monday! 625! I think
I'm such hot stuff with 126 (counting Paris Hilton
and Kofi Annan), and this kid comes around and
busts me up with a cool six-hundo!
11:35 a.m. — Mikey Lee gets back to campaign
ing and thanks me for playing catch. I expect a friend
request in eight minutes.
11:45 a.m. — The damn "Kiss Me Kate" kids are
really getting annoying. A dude, obviously in need
of puberty, is shrieking two octaves too high to get
people to buy tickets. Ears hurt.
12:15 p.m. — A whole slew of candidates come
up to me to try and catch a pass to swing my vote.
Ajani Husbands misses his first 10-yarder, but nails
the next two. Feranmi Okanlami from the sopho
more class president slate SOLV jumps over three
of his running mates, catching the football while in
the air to show up his opponents in the "Unity"
slate. Unity's only response is that their opponents
spelled "solve" incorrectly. Touche.
12:17 p.m. — I throw the ball to a "Unity" mem
ber. He bats the ball away in an effort to catch it.
Sad. Sad. Vote, SOLV.
12:35 p.m. — I don't understand why, or how, but
I just bought "Kiss Me Kate" tickets.
12:38 p.m. — OShak is still fondling my back. I'm
sufficiently disturbed.
12:47 p.m. — "Mikey Lee has requested to be
your friend ..Confirm.

Spencer Porter, a junior, will never have 625
friends. He doesn 't even have three. If you want to
meet the other two, Paris and Kofi, e-mail him at
porters@stanford, edu

Whoserick?, Paola "Bear" Worsley, and Jen "not
Billy" Graham, is running unopposed for Senior
Class president.
And barring a last-second massive write-in cam
paign, we have the election locked up. riding a cam
paign strategy of making senior year of Stanford like
that of high school: antagonizing freshmen, looking
cool, not really caring about classes and Prom. Oh,
and awkward dates highlighted by you spilling apple
cider all over your girl's dress. Especially those.
But enough about me. What I was really doing on
yesterday during lunch, while ostensibly campaign
ing for "Senior High School", was scoping out the
other candidates for any athletic ability.
With a Nerf football in tow, I set out to find which
candidates could really hold a candle in the athletic
department. My vote was dependent on their per
formance. Here are my findings.
11:15 a.m. — I arrive at White Plaza for the can
didate meet-and-greet that is going on between 11
a.m. and 1 p.m. Approximately seven people are
there. Six of them are there for "Kiss Me Kate" —
a show that is hard-pressed to find an audience.
More to follow.
11:18 a.m. — Obviously, the most important
piece of propaganda fora campaign is a white T
shirt with Sharpie written on it. The front of my shirt
now reads "Super Cool Senior", and the back reads,
"Uncool? More like Unopposed!" I am cooler than
water polo.
11:19 a.m. — 1 love this shirt. I cannot stress this
enough. My shirt rocks.
11:27 a.m. —Senate candidate "OShak" has
made it very clear that he "has my back." I'm
slightly disturbed, but tingling with excitement.
No, wait, that's not excitement, that's OShak
fondling me. Yeesh.
11:30 a.m. — Current senior class president and
ASSU presidential candidate Mikey Lee has ar
rived. Upon seeing the football, he immediately
runs an out-and-up route as I deliver a strike.
Touchdown. Vote, Lee.
Let me just take a moment to discuss this "Mikey
Lee" character. As we were playing catch, presiden
tial candidate Charlie Stockman was critiquing his
opponent on a wide array of issues via a megaphone,
ranging from his football skills to his fifth-year status
in the upcoming year.
Of course, just like his proposal to smoke out the
"Serial Groper" so the police can nab him while
high, this is a bag of hot air. While Mikey Lee was
enthusiastic about football, he was no Joe Montana
or even Ryan Leaf.
However, while on the topic, let's just say one
thing about thefacebook.com. Type in Mikey Lee,
and check out how many friends that kid has. Un
believable! 625 at midday on Monday! 625! I think
I'm such hot stuff with 126 (counting Paris Hilton
and Kofi Annan), and this kid comes around and
busts me up with a cool six-hundo!
11:35 a.m. — Mikey Lee gets back to campaign
ing and thanks me for playing catch. I expect a friend
request in eight minutes.
11:45 a.m. — The damn "Kiss Me Kate" kids are
really getting annoying. A dude, obviously in need
of puberty, is shrieking two octaves too high to get
people to buy tickets. Ears hurt.
12:15 p.m. — A whole slew of candidates come
up to me to try and catch a pass to swing my vote.
Ajani Husbands misses his first 10-yarder, but nails
the next two. Feranmi Okanlami from the sopho
more class president slate SOLV jumps over three
of his running mates, catching the football while in
the air to show up his opponents in the "Unity"
slate. Unity's only response is that their opponents
spelled "solve" incorrectly. Touche.
12:17 p.m. — I throw the ball to a "Unity" mem
ber. He bats the ball away in an effort to catch it.
Sad. Sad. Vote, SOLV.
12:35 p.m. — I don't understand why, or how, but
I just bought "Kiss Me Kate" tickets.
12:38 p.m. — OShak is still fondling my back. I'm
sufficiently disturbed.
12:47 p.m. — "Mikey Lee has requested to be
your friend ..Confirm.

Spencer Porter, a junior, will never have 625
friends. He doesn 't even have three. If you want to
meet the other two, Paris and Kofi, e-mail him at
porters@stanford, edu

I know what you want. I know what you're
searching for, what you're asking for and what
you're voting for. I know you want your presi
dent to host T-ball, your governor to be a body
builder and your favorite Late Night hosts to have
anchored Sports Center.
You want to convince yourself that sports super
stars can hold down an elected position. Knicks fans
want Bill Bradley in the Oval Office. Suns freaks
want Charles Barkley as the Arizona governor.
And. I mean, if Joe Montana ran for anything, I'd
jump on that bandwagon faster than Josh Childress
will leave Stanford for the NBA Draft (*tear).
So what's my point? People, you and me includ
ed, want to think that their favorite sports stars
know a bit more than the pick and roll, the halfback

option or how to sneak a "special
fan" into the locker room fora
post-game "massage." Oh, quote
marks, what can't you insinuate?
Conversely, you want your rep
resentatives to be somewhat athlet
ic. You want John Kerry to be a
weekend warrior, you want George
W. to go on those jogs, and you
WANT ME ON THAT WALL!
(Sorry, couldn't resist.)
But mostly, you want me as
your Senior Class president.
Oh Jesus.
