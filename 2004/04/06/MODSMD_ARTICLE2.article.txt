# Record number run for GSC Senate
## 
### JASON FLANNICK 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) elections this week will fea
ture a record number of candidates, with 35 students vying for 15 elect
ed seats on the GSC. The winners will confront issues ranging from
poor housing options to insufficient student finances.
"As far as I know, this is the most candidates the GSC has ever had,"
said head of the Elections Commission Ellie Martin, a junior. "The
turnout was even greater than it was for the ASSU [Undergraduate]
Senate, which was surely unprecedented."
According to GSC Secretary Carrie Whitehall, a doctoral student
in earth sciences, "Our current council, especially our Chair Steve Al
lison, has made a concerted effort to increase election awareness and
bring in candidates. In the spirit if democracy, it'd be better if there
were even more."
Current members of the GSC said they hope that the high number
of candidates will also lead to a higher voter turnout. The number of
candidates nearly doubles last year's total of 19.
"Having over 30 candidates running for the GSC means high voter
turnout and strong interest in the election," said Allison, a doctoral stu
dent in biological sciences. "A large pool of candidates implies wide
spread support for the GSC mission to improve the lives of graduate
students, and a very democratic election with lots of choices for voters."
The election will begin at midnight on Wednesday. April 7. Stu
dents can vote online at http://ballot.stanford.edu. Until then, candi
dates will spend their remaining time campaigning; candidate state
ments are available online at the election Web site.
According to Whitehall, voting in the GSC elections is just as im
portant as voting in municipal, state and national elections.
"Grad students are a huge body at this university and yet have been
under-represented in yearly elections; voter turn out has been very
low," Whitehall said. "Grad student quality of life is the main concern
of the GSC and yet very few grad students vote to elect GSC members
to represent student interests."
Martin added, "While [students]
can of course attend later GSC meet
ings and can get involved in any num
ber of student groups on campus,
through voting, they are directly influ
encing which issues are brought up
with the University."

According to Allison, current GSC
goals include an overhaul of the hous
ing lottery and improved child-care op
tions for student parents. In addition,
the organization hopes to broker a deal
to provide free Caltrain access to stu
dent commuters and take action to re
lieve the federal tax burden on gradu
ate students.
"The incoming group of GSC
members will have to carry on many
advocacy efforts," Allison said.
"There's plenty for the incoming GSC
to do."
The GSC encompasses seven
major districts, one for each of Stan
ford's academic schools. Students vote
on district and at-large candidates sep
arately. Ten candidates will be elected
to district seats, and the five students
with the most at-large votes who are
not elected to district seats will be elect
ed to at-large seats.
After the certification of the elec
tion results, the GSC will undergo a

transition period during which the new
members will participate in training ac
tivities. The GSC will elect new officers
internally on April 28.
AlUson said he hopes that the large
number of candidates this year indi
cates a positive trend for the future.
"I think interest in the GSC has
been intensifying over time as students
see the progress that we make," he said.
"The GSC is earning name recognition
among the student body for events like
the annual Thanksgiving Dinner, and
for our ongoing advocacy efforts to im
prove graduate-student life."
Students who do not win a GSC
seat can still participate in the GSC as
non-elected members.
"Every student is actually consid
ered to be a member of the GSC,"
Allison said. "Whether you win or
lose, whether you run or not, you are
welcome to participate in the GSC.
Many of our most active members
are non-elected."
