# Record number run for GSC Senate
## 
### JASON FLANNICK 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC) elections this week will fea
ture a record number of candidates, with 35 students vying for 15 elect
ed seats on the GSC. The winners will confront issues ranging from
poor housing options to insufficient student finances.
"As far as I know, this is the most candidates the GSC has ever had,"
said head of the Elections Commission Ellie Martin, a junior. "The
turnout was even greater than it was for the ASSU [Undergraduate]
Senate, which was surely unprecedented."
According to GSC Secretary Carrie Whitehall, a doctoral student
in earth sciences, "Our current council, especially our Chair Steve Al
lison, has made a concerted effort to increase election awareness and
bring in candidates. In the spirit if democracy, it'd be better if there
were even more."
Current members of the GSC said they hope that the high number
of candidates will also lead to a higher voter turnout. The number of
candidates nearly doubles last year's total of 19.
"Having over 30 candidates running for the GSC means high voter
turnout and strong interest in the election," said Allison, a doctoral stu
dent in biological sciences. "A large pool of candidates implies wide
spread support for the GSC mission to improve the lives of graduate
students, and a very democratic election with lots of choices for voters."
The election will begin at midnight on Wednesday. April 7. Stu
dents can vote online at http://ballot.stanford.edu. Until then, candi
dates will spend their remaining time campaigning; candidate state
ments are available online at the election Web site.
According to Whitehall, voting in the GSC elections is just as im
portant as voting in municipal, state and national elections.
"Grad students are a huge body at this university and yet have been
under-represented in yearly elections; voter turn out has been very
low," Whitehall said. "Grad student quality of life is the main concern
of the GSC and yet very few grad students vote to elect GSC members
to represent student interests."
