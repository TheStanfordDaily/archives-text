# Men fall to UCSB, Cal State
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball team
(8-15, 5-12 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has struggled away from home this sea
son, and last weekend was no exception.
Adding its seventh and eighth road losses,
the Cardinal fell to No. 2 Cal State-
Northridge (18-7, 12-6) on Friday and No. 7
UC-Santa Barbara (14-11,9-9) on Saturday.
Stanford did, however, improve its num
bers. According to Stanford head coach Don
Shaw, the Cardinal put on a good show this
weekend, often committing fewer errors
than its opponents.
"They were both very competitive
[matches]," he said. "After two games in
each of those matches, not only was the
match score tied, we were actually leading
statistically in both."
But in both cases, tough serving made the
difference in the outcome of the matches.
"We got stuck in a couple of rotations
when the other team had a server who got
hot and we couldn't handle the serve," Shaw
said. "We couldn't get our offense going."
The fight on Friday certainly outdid the
previous match against Northridge. This
time, Stanford took the first game from the
Matadors before losing the next three. But
when the teams last met in January,
Northridge swept the Cardinal in three
games, 30-23, 30-26, 30-20. Junior outside
hitter David Vogel was the only Stanford
player to post double-digit kills, tallying 11.
"They embarrassed us on our own
court," said junior middle hitter Craig Buell
of the January match.
Friday, Vogel led the Cardinal attack
once again, notching 13 kills in the 3-1 loss.
But this time. Stanford battled fora game
one win against the top-ranked Matadors, in
a contest that featured 18 ties and 12 lead

changes. Down 27-26, the Cardinal closed
out the game on a 4-0 run punctuated by an
ace from sophomore outside hitter William
Clayton, winning 30-27.
After that, the scene changed.
Northridge coach Jeff Campbell changed his
lineup, sending in his star, junior outside hit
ter Nils Nielsen. Nielsen started game two
with three consecutive aces. And that was
only the beginning for Northridge.
"The serving in games two through four
picked up dramatically and passing became
more of an issue as the match progressed,"
Buell said.
The Matadors posted an early 9-5 lead
and went on to win, 30-25.
Northridge continued to gain momentum
as the night went on, jumping out to an 11-3
lead in game three. Though Stanford would
pull within three at 26-23, it would get no
closer, and the Matadors won again at 30-25.
Stanford's charge in game three was in
dicative of a series of point exchanges that
happened throughout the match, what Buell
said was a pattern of inconsistency Stanford
couldn't seem to break. The up-and-down
nature of its game has plagued the team
throughout the season, but Friday night
stood out.
"It was the most streaky match of the
year for us," he said. "They would run off
a streak of five, then we'd run off a streak
of five."
The streaks continued into game four,
when Stanford pulled within two at 22-20,
only to lose when the Matadors pulled out
an 8-2 run to end the game and match, 30-22.
"We never seemed to get back into [game
four]," Shaw said.
Buell, who posted seven kills on Fri
day, was not surprised by Northridge's
stellar play.
"They did everything we expected them
