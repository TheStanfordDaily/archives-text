# Men fall to UCSB, Cal State
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball team
(8-15, 5-12 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has struggled away from home this sea
son, and last weekend was no exception.
Adding its seventh and eighth road losses,
the Cardinal fell to No. 2 Cal State-
Northridge (18-7, 12-6) on Friday and No. 7
UC-Santa Barbara (14-11,9-9) on Saturday.
Stanford did, however, improve its num
bers. According to Stanford head coach Don
Shaw, the Cardinal put on a good show this
weekend, often committing fewer errors
than its opponents.
"They were both very competitive
[matches]," he said. "After two games in
each of those matches, not only was the
match score tied, we were actually leading
statistically in both."
But in both cases, tough serving made the
difference in the outcome of the matches.
"We got stuck in a couple of rotations
when the other team had a server who got
hot and we couldn't handle the serve," Shaw
said. "We couldn't get our offense going."
The fight on Friday certainly outdid the
previous match against Northridge. This
time, Stanford took the first game from the
Matadors before losing the next three. But
when the teams last met in January,
Northridge swept the Cardinal in three
games, 30-23, 30-26, 30-20. Junior outside
hitter David Vogel was the only Stanford
player to post double-digit kills, tallying 11.
"They embarrassed us on our own
court," said junior middle hitter Craig Buell
of the January match.
Friday, Vogel led the Cardinal attack
once again, notching 13 kills in the 3-1 loss.
But this time. Stanford battled fora game
one win against the top-ranked Matadors, in
a contest that featured 18 ties and 12 lead

changes. Down 27-26, the Cardinal closed
out the game on a 4-0 run punctuated by an
ace from sophomore outside hitter William
Clayton, winning 30-27.
After that, the scene changed.
Northridge coach Jeff Campbell changed his
lineup, sending in his star, junior outside hit
ter Nils Nielsen. Nielsen started game two
with three consecutive aces. And that was
only the beginning for Northridge.
"The serving in games two through four
picked up dramatically and passing became
more of an issue as the match progressed,"
Buell said.
The Matadors posted an early 9-5 lead
and went on to win, 30-25.
Northridge continued to gain momentum
as the night went on, jumping out to an 11-3
lead in game three. Though Stanford would
pull within three at 26-23, it would get no
closer, and the Matadors won again at 30-25.
Stanford's charge in game three was in
dicative of a series of point exchanges that
happened throughout the match, what Buell
said was a pattern of inconsistency Stanford
couldn't seem to break. The up-and-down
nature of its game has plagued the team
throughout the season, but Friday night
stood out.
"It was the most streaky match of the
year for us," he said. "They would run off
a streak of five, then we'd run off a streak
of five."
The streaks continued into game four,
when Stanford pulled within two at 22-20,
only to lose when the Matadors pulled out
an 8-2 run to end the game and match, 30-22.
"We never seemed to get back into [game
four]," Shaw said.
Buell, who posted seven kills on Fri
day, was not surprised by Northridge's
stellar play.
"They did everything we expected them

to do," he said.
The Cardinal tried some new ap
proaches with UCSB on Saturday
night, replacing junior outside hit
ter Pat Bomhack with sophomore
outside hitter Nick Manov and
sophomore outside hitter William
Clayton with sophomore outside
hitter Ben Reddy.
According to Buell, Stanford had
an attitude adjustment as well.
"It was a much more emotional
game," he said. "Against Cal State-
Northridge, we lacked that intensity."
The Gauchos took game one, 30-
25, hitting at a .405 clip to Stanford's
.310. But Stanford came back to
take game two, 30-28.
"Games one and two we played
pretty well," Buell said. "But in
the third game, we gave up one of
those streaks."
Stanford lost game three by the
greatest margin of the night, 30-21.
But game four was the most no
table of the weekend in many ways.
Unlike the final game against
Northridge on Friday, Stanford

came out swinging against the Gau
chos, repeatedly exchanging leads.
"The fourth game was toe-to-toe,
never much of a lead by either
team," Shaw said.
That pattern continued until late
in the match, when Stanford and
UCSB were tied at 27, junior setter
Kevin Hansen set Buell fora slide
and Buell's attack went out of
bounds. In a highly-contested deci
sion, referees failed to call a touch,
giving the Gauchos the point.
"That close to the end of the
game, 1 think that kind of a call was
a really huge break for them," Shaw
said. "It hurt, but the guys played
very hard."
"The end of game four was just a
circus," Buell said.
Even so, Shaw was pleased with
his team's showing.
"I can't fault our effort," he said.
"I thought we played better Satur
day night than we did Friday night.
And I thought we played well Fri
day night."
Stanford will return to the Farm
to take on Pepperdine on Friday be
fore facing Southern California on
Saturday. Both matches will be at 7
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.

hot and we couldn't handle the serve," Shaw
said. "We couldn't get our offense going."
The fight on Friday certainly outdid the
previous match against Northridge. This
time, Stanford took the first game from the
Matadors before losing the next three. But
when the teams last met in January,
Northridge swept the Cardinal in three
games, 30-23, 30-26, 30-20. Junior outside
hitter David Vogel was the only Stanford
player to post double-digit kills, tallying 11.
"They embarrassed us on our own
court," said junior middle hitter Craig Buell
of the January match.
Friday, Vogel led the Cardinal attack
once again, notching 13 kills in the 3-1 loss.
But this time. Stanford battled fora game
one win against the top-ranked Matadors, in
a contest that featured 18 ties and 12 lead

changes. Down 27-26, the Cardinal closed
out the game on a 4-0 run punctuated by an
ace from sophomore outside hitter William
Clayton, winning 30-27.
After that, the scene changed.
Northridge coach Jeff Campbell changed his
lineup, sending in his star, junior outside hit
ter Nils Nielsen. Nielsen started game two
with three consecutive aces. And that was
only the beginning for Northridge.
"The serving in games two through four
picked up dramatically and passing became
more of an issue as the match progressed,"
Buell said.
The Matadors posted an early 9-5 lead
and went on to win, 30-25.
Northridge continued to gain momentum
as the night went on, jumping out to an 11-3
lead in game three. Though Stanford would
pull within three at 26-23, it would get no
closer, and the Matadors won again at 30-25.
Stanford's charge in game three was in
dicative of a series of point exchanges that
happened throughout the match, what Buell
said was a pattern of inconsistency Stanford
couldn't seem to break. The up-and-down
nature of its game has plagued the team
throughout the season, but Friday night
stood out.
"It was the most streaky match of the
year for us," he said. "They would run off
a streak of five, then we'd run off a streak
of five."
The streaks continued into game four,
when Stanford pulled within two at 22-20,
only to lose when the Matadors pulled out
an 8-2 run to end the game and match, 30-22.
"We never seemed to get back into [game
four]," Shaw said.
Buell, who posted seven kills on Fri
day, was not surprised by Northridge's
stellar play.
"They did everything we expected them

and Cal State-North ridge.
to do," he said.
The Cardinal tried some new ap
proaches with UCSB on Saturday
night, replacing junior outside hit
ter Pat Bomhack with sophomore
outside hitter Nick Manov and
sophomore outside hitter William
Clayton with sophomore outside
hitter Ben Reddy.
According to Buell, Stanford had
an attitude adjustment as well.
"It was a much more emotional
game," he said. "Against Cal State-
Northridge, we lacked that intensity."
The Gauchos took game one, 30-
25, hitting at a .405 clip to Stanford's
.310. But Stanford came back to
take game two, 30-28.
"Games one and two we played
pretty well," Buell said. "But in
the third game, we gave up one of
those streaks."
Stanford lost game three by the
greatest margin of the night, 30-21.
But game four was the most no
table of the weekend in many ways.
Unlike the final game against
Northridge on Friday, Stanford

came out swinging against the Gau
chos, repeatedly exchanging leads.
"The fourth game was toe-to-toe,
never much of a lead by either
team," Shaw said.
That pattern continued until late
in the match, when Stanford and
UCSB were tied at 27, junior setter
Kevin Hansen set Buell fora slide
and Buell's attack went out of
bounds. In a highly-contested deci
sion, referees failed to call a touch,
giving the Gauchos the point.
"That close to the end of the
game, 1 think that kind of a call was
a really huge break for them," Shaw
said. "It hurt, but the guys played
very hard."
"The end of game four was just a
circus," Buell said.
Even so, Shaw was pleased with
his team's showing.
"I can't fault our effort," he said.
"I thought we played better Satur
day night than we did Friday night.
And I thought we played well Fri
day night."
Stanford will return to the Farm
to take on Pepperdine on Friday be
fore facing Southern California on
Saturday. Both matches will be at 7
p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
The No. 8 Stanford men's volleyball team
(8-15, 5-12 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) has struggled away from home this sea
son, and last weekend was no exception.
Adding its seventh and eighth road losses,
the Cardinal fell to No. 2 Cal State-
Northridge (18-7, 12-6) on Friday and No. 7
UC-Santa Barbara (14-11,9-9) on Saturday.
Stanford did, however, improve its num
bers. According to Stanford head coach Don
Shaw, the Cardinal put on a good show this
weekend, often committing fewer errors
than its opponents.
"They were both very competitive
[matches]," he said. "After two games in
each of those matches, not only was the
match score tied, we were actually leading
statistically in both."
But in both cases, tough serving made the
difference in the outcome of the matches.
"We got stuck in a couple of rotations
when the other team had a server who got
hot and we couldn't handle the serve," Shaw
said. "We couldn't get our offense going."
