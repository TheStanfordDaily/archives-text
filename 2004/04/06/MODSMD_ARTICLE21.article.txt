# Women's track sets school record in 1,600-meter relay
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For the second year in a row,
the Stanford women's 1,600-
meter relay team returned from
the Texas Relays with a new
school record.
The team of freshmen
Keisha Gaines, Ashley Free
man and Janice Davis and
sophomore Nashonme Johnson
finished in three minutes, 33.98
seconds, eclipsing the old record
set at last year's Texas Relays by
nearly a second. The time also
qualifies the squad for the Re
gional Championships.
"Overall, I was pleased with
their effort," said women's head
coach Edrick Floreal. "We have
a young group, three freshmen
and one sophomore, running on
the team."
Texas won the race in an
NCAA-record 3:23.75. For com
parison. that time would have
been fast enough to place fourth
at the 2000 Olympic Games.
"As our runners race more,
they will become a better team
and will produce better times,"
Floreal said. "Teams like
Texas have experience. They
have juniors and seniors on
their team. We just don't have
that experience."
Individually, senior Jillian
Camarena placed second to Ne
braska's Becky Breisch in the
shot put. Camarena managed a
throw of 54 feet, 8.75 inches to
Breisch's 57-4.25.
After false-starting in the 100-
meter hurdles, senior Lindsey
Johnson ran the 400-meter hur
dles in 62.15 seconds to place sec
ond in her heat.
On the men's side, sopho
more Solomon Welch, the
squad's lone competitor in
Texas, jumped 48-7.50 in the
triple jump to place sixth.
Back in California at the Cal-
Nevada meet, sophomore

Samantha Shepard vaulted 12-
11.50 to claim fifth in the
women's pole vault, while senior
Leila Ben-Youssef cleared 12-
3.50 for eighth.
Senior Jason Goff set a new
personal best by almost seven
feet in the javelin to finish second
with a throw of 217-5. His throw
ranks him third on Stanford's all
time list.
Currently, the senior is
throwing almost 20 feet farther
than last year as he looks to qual
ify for the NCAA Champi
onships in June.
"We want to get more ath
letes competing on the elite level
in the Pacific-10 Conference and
the NCAA," Floreal said. "Get
ting our athletes in meets like
this past weekend help them re
alize exactly what it takes to be at
that level."
This year, the women's team
has one of the most balanced and
talented squads ever, and their
goals reflect that strength.
"I think we have a really well
rounded team, and as long as ev
eryone performs like they can,
we will be really strong in the
Pac-10," said junior Sara Bei.
After finishing a close second
to UCLA at last year's Pac-10
Championships, the women are
back for revenge.
"We definitely want to be in
position to win the Pac-lOs and
place in the top five at the
NCAA Championships," Flore
al said.
And they have the guns to
back it up.
For the distance corps. Bei and
redshirt sophomore Alicia Craig
make up one of the strongest dis
tance duos in the nation.
Bei is a returning 5,000-meter
All-American and recently
placed second in the 3.000 at the
Indoor Championships. Mean
while, Craig is the reigning
10,000-meter champion and last
year ran the sixth-best all-time

NCAA 5,000-meter. Both
should contend for spots on the
U.S. Olympic team this summer.
After finishing 1-2 and 2-3 in
the 10,000 and 5,000-meters, re
spectively, at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships last year, the Cardinal
will rely on Bei and Craig to lead
the team to the women's first
ever Pac-10 title in track.
"We always try to take inter
national competition into con
sideration," Floreal said. "When
they go and compete at that
level, they bring back those ex
periences and really enhance the
team. We just need to be sure the
athletes have some life left in
their training after NCAA Na
tionals for the Olympic Trials so
they have that opportunity."
The distance team also fea
tures middle-distance specialist
Ari Lambie, a freshman who has
already run the fastest 1,500 time
in the NCAA so far this year.
Lambie will undoubtedly chal
lenge for both Pac-10 and
NCAA titles in the 1,500 and 800
this year.
Senior Katie Hotchkiss,
sophomore Chinny Offor and
freshman Ashley Freeman
should also bolster the Cardinal
in the middle distances.
Freeman and Offor are also
apart of one of the deepest 400
groups in the nation. This year,
the Cardinal added two more top
preps, Keisha Gaines and Janice
Davis, to the already deep and
talented sprint pool. After their
showing at Texas, the Cardinal
women have a legitimate shot at
making the NCAA final in the
1,600-meter relay.
Sophomore Nashonme John
son is the leading returning
sprinter, having qualified to the
NC'AA Championships in the
200 last year. She was Stanford's
first individual representative in
the sprints since Chrystie Gaines
in 1992.
After a freak, season-ending

injury at the Big Meet last year,
senior Lindsey Johnson is re
turning to good form in the hur
dles and looks to be Stanford's
first hurdler to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
Juniors Christine Moschella
and Undine Becker, sophomore
Chauntae Bayne and redshirt
freshmen Jakki Bailey and Ash

ley Furnell should also add qual
ity to the Cardinal's depth.
In the jumps, Becker returns
after qualifying for the NCAA
Championships last year in the
long jump, while freshman Lind
say Gannaway has already estab
lished herself as a growing threat

Sophomore Samantha Shepard
looks to impact both the Pac-10 and
national scene in pole vault after
finishing seventh at the Pac-10
Championships last year.
Camarena returns for her final
season on the Farm, having
placed no lower than third in the
shot put at any NCAA Champi
onship since 2002. Camarena is
also an All-American in the dis
cus and should contribute points
on the Pac-10 and national level
in both events.
Juniors Jessica Pluth, Danielle
Colich and Sarah Hopping should
add depth for the Cardinal in the

hammer throw at the Pac-lOs and
NCAA Championships.
This will also mark the first year
of the women's team under the
guidance of Coach Floreal. After
Vin Lananna left for Oberlin Col
lege to assume the position of Ath
letic Director, Floreal was promot
ed from assistant coach to his cur
rent post.
"It is such a phenomenal experi
ence," Floreal said. "We are really
lucky to have such bright and intel
ligent athletes here at Stanford. It
makes my job so much easier.
"This is really a collaborative ef
fort. We don't force our athletes
into competition, but it is our mis
sion to give them as many opportu
nities as possible to compete at the
top level. When they compete, they
learn and get better. That's how you
make a team successful."

letic Director, Floreal was promot
ed from assistant coach to his cur

"It is such a phenomenal experi
ence," Floreal said. "We are really
lucky to have such bright and intel
ligent athletes here at Stanford. It
makes my job so much easier.
"This is really a collaborative ef
fort. We don't force our athletes
into competition, but it is our mis
sion to give them as many opportu
nities as possible to compete at the
top level. When they compete, they
learn and get better. That's how you
make a team successful."
For the second year in a row,
the Stanford women's 1,600-
meter relay team returned from
the Texas Relays with a new
school record.
The team of freshmen
Keisha Gaines, Ashley Free
man and Janice Davis and
sophomore Nashonme Johnson
finished in three minutes, 33.98
seconds, eclipsing the old record
set at last year's Texas Relays by
nearly a second. The time also
qualifies the squad for the Re
gional Championships.
"Overall, I was pleased with
their effort," said women's head
coach Edrick Floreal. "We have
a young group, three freshmen
and one sophomore, running on
the team."
Texas won the race in an
NCAA-record 3:23.75. For com
parison. that time would have
been fast enough to place fourth
at the 2000 Olympic Games.
"As our runners race more,
they will become a better team
and will produce better times,"
Floreal said. "Teams like
Texas have experience. They
have juniors and seniors on
their team. We just don't have
that experience."
Individually, senior Jillian
Camarena placed second to Ne
braska's Becky Breisch in the
shot put. Camarena managed a
throw of 54 feet, 8.75 inches to
Breisch's 57-4.25.
After false-starting in the 100-
meter hurdles, senior Lindsey
Johnson ran the 400-meter hur
dles in 62.15 seconds to place sec
ond in her heat.
On the men's side, sopho
more Solomon Welch, the
squad's lone competitor in
Texas, jumped 48-7.50 in the
triple jump to place sixth.
Back in California at the Cal-
Nevada meet, sophomore

Samantha Shepard vaulted 12-
11.50 to claim fifth in the
women's pole vault, while senior
Leila Ben-Youssef cleared 12-
3.50 for eighth.
Senior Jason Goff set a new
personal best by almost seven
feet in the javelin to finish second
with a throw of 217-5. His throw
ranks him third on Stanford's all
time list.
Currently, the senior is
throwing almost 20 feet farther
than last year as he looks to qual
ify for the NCAA Champi
onships in June.
"We want to get more ath
letes competing on the elite level
in the Pacific-10 Conference and
the NCAA," Floreal said. "Get
ting our athletes in meets like
this past weekend help them re
alize exactly what it takes to be at
that level."
This year, the women's team
has one of the most balanced and
talented squads ever, and their
goals reflect that strength.
"I think we have a really well
rounded team, and as long as ev
eryone performs like they can,
we will be really strong in the
Pac-10," said junior Sara Bei.
After finishing a close second
to UCLA at last year's Pac-10
Championships, the women are
back for revenge.
"We definitely want to be in
position to win the Pac-lOs and
place in the top five at the
NCAA Championships," Flore
al said.
And they have the guns to
back it up.
For the distance corps. Bei and
redshirt sophomore Alicia Craig
make up one of the strongest dis
tance duos in the nation.
Bei is a returning 5,000-meter
All-American and recently
placed second in the 3.000 at the
Indoor Championships. Mean
while, Craig is the reigning
10,000-meter champion and last
year ran the sixth-best all-time

NCAA 5,000-meter. Both
should contend for spots on the
U.S. Olympic team this summer.
After finishing 1-2 and 2-3 in
the 10,000 and 5,000-meters, re
spectively, at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships last year, the Cardinal
will rely on Bei and Craig to lead
the team to the women's first
ever Pac-10 title in track.
"We always try to take inter
national competition into con
sideration," Floreal said. "When
they go and compete at that
level, they bring back those ex
periences and really enhance the
team. We just need to be sure the
athletes have some life left in
their training after NCAA Na
tionals for the Olympic Trials so
they have that opportunity."
The distance team also fea
tures middle-distance specialist
Ari Lambie, a freshman who has
already run the fastest 1,500 time
in the NCAA so far this year.
Lambie will undoubtedly chal
lenge for both Pac-10 and
NCAA titles in the 1,500 and 800
this year.
Senior Katie Hotchkiss,
sophomore Chinny Offor and
freshman Ashley Freeman
should also bolster the Cardinal
in the middle distances.
Freeman and Offor are also
apart of one of the deepest 400
groups in the nation. This year,
the Cardinal added two more top
preps, Keisha Gaines and Janice
Davis, to the already deep and
talented sprint pool. After their
showing at Texas, the Cardinal
women have a legitimate shot at
making the NCAA final in the
1,600-meter relay.
Sophomore Nashonme John
son is the leading returning
sprinter, having qualified to the
NC'AA Championships in the
200 last year. She was Stanford's
first individual representative in
the sprints since Chrystie Gaines
in 1992.
After a freak, season-ending

injury at the Big Meet last year,
senior Lindsey Johnson is re
turning to good form in the hur
dles and looks to be Stanford's
first hurdler to qualify for the
NCAA Championships.
Juniors Christine Moschella
and Undine Becker, sophomore
Chauntae Bayne and redshirt
freshmen Jakki Bailey and Ash

ley Furnell should also add qual
ity to the Cardinal's depth.
In the jumps, Becker returns
after qualifying for the NCAA
Championships last year in the
long jump, while freshman Lind

finishing seventh at the Pac-10

Camarena returns for her final

placed no lower than third in the
shot put at any NCAA Champi
onship since 2002. Camarena is
also an All-American in the dis
cus and should contribute points
on the Pac-10 and national level
in both events.
Juniors Jessica Pluth, Danielle
Colich and Sarah Hopping should
add depth for the Cardinal in the

hammer throw at the Pac-lOs and
NCAA Championships.
This will also mark the first year

onship since 2002. Camarena is
also an All-American in the dis
cus and should contribute points
on the Pac-10 and national level
in both events.
Juniors Jessica Pluth, Danielle
Colich and Sarah Hopping should
add depth for the Cardinal in the

hammer throw at the Pac-lOs and
NCAA Championships.
This will also mark the first year
of the women's team under the
guidance of Coach Floreal. After
Vin Lananna left for Oberlin Col
lege to assume the position of Ath
letic Director, Floreal was promot
ed from assistant coach to his cur
rent post.
"It is such a phenomenal experi
ence," Floreal said. "We are really
lucky to have such bright and intel
ligent athletes here at Stanford. It
makes my job so much easier.
"This is really a collaborative ef
fort. We don't force our athletes
into competition, but it is our mis
sion to give them as many opportu
nities as possible to compete at the
top level. When they compete, they
learn and get better. That's how you
make a team successful."
