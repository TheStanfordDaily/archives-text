# No. 2 women's gymnastics wins Regionals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
It has been a record-breaking year for
the Stanford women's gymnastics team —
kicking off with the highest preseason
ranking ever, posting the highest team
scores in program history, climbing to a
No. 2 ranking and, now, winning the Pacif
ic-10 Championships and the NCAA
North Central Regional in the same year
for the first time.
The women won the North Central
Regional this past Saturday in Denver,
Colo., with a score of 1%.575, beating out
No. 11 Washington, No. 14 Denver, No.

20 lowa, Minnesota and Southern Utah.
The win qualifies the team to compete at
NCAA Nationals on April 15-17 and
gives the team a shot at one more first: a
national championship.
Senior Lise Leveille led the team at re
gionals, winning the all-around with a
score of 49.425. Her fellow seniors, co
captains Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer, rounded out a sweep in the all
around by respectively posting a 49.35 and
a 49.25 to take second and third place.
Leveille's performance was particular
ly remarkable because she had to go to
work under pressure. She competed her
beam routine right after sophomore Na

talie Foley had fallen on her beam routine
and similarly competed her bar routine
right after freshman Stacey Sprando had
fallen on bars.
Since five out of six scores on every
event count towards the team score, a
missed routine means more pressure for
the gymnasts who follow. Not only does
she have to hit her routine, but it is up to
her to put the momentum of the event
back on track. Leveille did just that —
scoring a 9.9 on beam and a 9.825 on bars.
Wing took the reigns from there and post
ed a 9.925 on beam and a 9.9 on bars to win
those two events.
"Lise closed the gap and stopped the

bleeding right away," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "She was as tough as nails
and showed amazing leadership."
The team's score at regionais ranks the
team at No. 9 going into nationals. The
seeding puts Stanford up against No. 2
Georgia, No. 5 Oklahoma, No. 6 Florida,
No. 11 Nebraska and No. 16 lowa on the
first day of national competition. The first
three of these teams will face the top three
teams from another bracket at the second
day of competition — the famed Super
Six meet.
