# No. 2 women's gymnastics wins Regionals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
It has been a record-breaking year for
the Stanford women's gymnastics team —
kicking off with the highest preseason
ranking ever, posting the highest team
scores in program history, climbing to a
No. 2 ranking and, now, winning the Pacif
ic-10 Championships and the NCAA
North Central Regional in the same year
for the first time.
The women won the North Central
Regional this past Saturday in Denver,
Colo., with a score of 1%.575, beating out
No. 11 Washington, No. 14 Denver, No.

20 lowa, Minnesota and Southern Utah.
The win qualifies the team to compete at
NCAA Nationals on April 15-17 and
gives the team a shot at one more first: a
national championship.
Senior Lise Leveille led the team at re
gionals, winning the all-around with a
score of 49.425. Her fellow seniors, co
captains Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer, rounded out a sweep in the all
around by respectively posting a 49.35 and
a 49.25 to take second and third place.
Leveille's performance was particular
ly remarkable because she had to go to
work under pressure. She competed her
beam routine right after sophomore Na

talie Foley had fallen on her beam routine
and similarly competed her bar routine
right after freshman Stacey Sprando had
fallen on bars.
Since five out of six scores on every
event count towards the team score, a
missed routine means more pressure for
the gymnasts who follow. Not only does
she have to hit her routine, but it is up to
her to put the momentum of the event
back on track. Leveille did just that —
scoring a 9.9 on beam and a 9.825 on bars.
Wing took the reigns from there and post
ed a 9.925 on beam and a 9.9 on bars to win
those two events.
"Lise closed the gap and stopped the

bleeding right away," said head coach
Kristen Smyth. "She was as tough as nails
and showed amazing leadership."
The team's score at regionais ranks the
team at No. 9 going into nationals. The
seeding puts Stanford up against No. 2
Georgia, No. 5 Oklahoma, No. 6 Florida,
No. 11 Nebraska and No. 16 lowa on the
first day of national competition. The first
three of these teams will face the top three
teams from another bracket at the second
day of competition — the famed Super
Six meet.
The Cardinal qualified to the Super Six
meet for the first time two years ago,
but narrowly missed qualifying last
year. After the disappointment, the
women are hungry for another ap
pearance. Their strong regular sea
son performance this year has land
ed them in a less competitive prelim
inary bracket than last year, so they
are in good position to break into the
Super Six.
Stanford has qualified to na
tionals only seven times in school
history, but this year will be the
team's fourth consecutive appear
ance. Their continued success is
due in large part to the team's five
seniors and the coaching efforts of
Smyth, who came to Stanford three
years ago.
Smyth was recently voted Pac-10
Coach of the Year as well as West

Regional Coach of the Year. She as
sisted by Larissa Fontaine, a former
Stanford gymnast who coaches vault
and beam, and Chris Swircek, who
coaches bars and tumbling.
"This award is really for my team
and my staff," Smyth said. "It's a
team effort. That award goes to ev
eryone in the program."
"Whether it be sticking our land
ings or performing our dance,
[Smyth's) passion for gymnastics
spreads over this team in everything
that we do," said sophomore Mandy
Delgado, who is injured this year.
"Not to mention the fact that she re
ally cares about us inside of the gym
and out."
Leveille said she appreciates
Smyth's open-door policy, which al
lows the gymnasts to talk through
problems or just say hello whenever
they like.
"Kristen has created a strong
family atmosphere and cares about
each girl as an individual," Leveille
said. "She understands the demands

of being a collegiate athlete and
tends to know when to push us and
when we really just need support
from a friend."
Smyth was a collegiate gymnast at
California, where she was voted
Golden Bears Gymnast of the
Decade. She also danced profession
ally in the Bay Area for three years
— an experience which has served
her well in choreographing all of
Stanford's floor routines, which
showcase dance styles varying from
Leveille's tango number to Fluhrer's
Madonna moves.
"Kristen is incredibly commit
ted to our team and her belief in
our potential allows us to believe
in our ability to reach our goals,"
said senior Shelly Goldberg. "She
has really helped us to have confi
dence in our ability to perform our
routines in competition, while re
minding us to enjoy the unique ex
perience we have every time we
step out on the floor to compete
for Stanford."
