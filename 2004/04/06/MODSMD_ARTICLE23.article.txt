## 
### CARLING NGUYEN 
The senior backbone of the No. 8 Stanford
men's gymnastics team (3-5, 2-3 Pacific-10
Conference) is graduating in the spring and
the young guns are on their way to filling his
shoes. The Cardinal traveled to Champaign.
111., this past weekend to compete in the
NCAA Championships, held last Friday
through Sunday.
While the Cardinal did not advance to
Saturday's team finals, Stanford was well
represented in the individual events. The
Cardinal saw strong individual performances
from senior captain Dan Gill as well as fresh
man Peter Derman, both of whom received
Ail-American honors.
At a banquet on Thursday night, the day
before competition began. Gill was an
nounced as the winner of the Nissen-Emery
Award, the gymnastics equivalent of the
Heisman Trophy.
As he was reading a pamphlet with all of
the award nominees listed. Gill was sur
prised that he was on the list and shocked
that he won.
"It was a great honor to win, looking at
the group that was nominated," he said.
On the following day, the NCAA Champi
onships were divided into two brackets, with
six teams in each bracket. After two sessions
of competition on Friday, the top three
teams from each bracket advanced to the
team finals. Stanford was up against tough
competitors, including top-ranked Illinois,
two-time defending champion Oklahoma
and Penn State, which was searching for its
11th national title.
Eventual champion No. 3 Penn State,
No. 7 Michigan and No. 2 Oklahoma were
the highest scorers, respectively, in the
first bracket, and proceeded to Satur
day's finals.
In the second bracket, No. 4 California, No.
5 Ohio State, and No. 1 Illinois scored higher
than Stanford and advanced to Saturday.
Although the squad missed third place in the
second bracket by almost four points, there were
some exceptional individual performances.
During the first rotation on the vault. Gill
was the top scorer of the night in this event
with a 9.550, and sophomore Sean Doolan
tied for 15th with a 9.200. Those scores qual
ified both for Saturday night's events.
After the vault, the team moved on to the
parallel bars, where Gill again qualified for

Saturday by scoring an 8.825, finishing in
eighth place.
Sophomore Nate Downs and Doolan also
advanced on parallel bars with scores of
8.700 and 8.600, respectively.
On the horizontal bar, Downs and Gill
turned in two more outstanding performances.
In addition to Downs, who scored an 8.975
that placed him 13th, Gill also earned a spot
in Saturday's competition by scoring a 9.575
, which was good for third place.
The fourth rotation consisted of the floor
exercise, where Doolan and Gill both quali
fied for the next round. Doolan scored a
9.425, and Gill scored a 9.500. placing them
in ninth and eighth, respectively.
During the fifth rotation on the pommel
horse, Gill finished fifth with a score of
9.525, advancing him to Saturday's competi
tion in this event as well.
The final event of the evening was the
rings, where the freshmen had their opportu
nity to shine.
Freshman Peter Derman earned a 9.5, the
second-best score for the rings on Friday
night, and freshman Alex Schorsh scored a
9.325, the fifth-best score.
Unfortunately, Gill fell during this last ro
tation on his dismount, causing some people
to think he was not going to be a contender in
Saturday's competition.
Despite his fall on the rings. Gill, a mem
ber of the U.S. national team, finished sec
ond in Friday's all-around with a score of
54.850, which advanced him to Saturday's
all-around finals.
Saturday consisted of the team and indi
vidual all-around championships. Qualifying
events also took place for individual events
to be held on Sunday. The top eight from
each qualifying event advanced to Sunday's
individual event finals.
Gill did not let Friday night's fall faze him.
He scored well enough to qualify for Sunday's
finals in four events with a 9.450 on the floor,
9.750 on the pommel horse, 9.500 on the vault
and 9.875 on the high bar.
He also scored the second-highest score for
the individual all-around competition with a
56.125, which was a career-high. Penn State's
Luis Vargas edged out Gill for first place by
0.35 points.
"After my crash the first day, to come
back and put up my highest all-around score
was amazing," Gill said. "Vargas managed to
hit six-for-six and really put together his best

meet. It was good enough to take me down."
Unlike Gill, teammates Doolan, Downs
and Schorsch did not qualify for Sunday al
though they scored well in their events. On
the rings, Derman scored higher than
Schorsch by a tenth of a point, tying him for
fifth and qualifying him for Sunday's individ
ual event finals.
On the third and final day of competi
tion, Gill ended his Stanford career with a
bang. Receiving sixth place in floor exer
cise, fifth in the vault and tying for second in
the pommel horse and high bar. Gill became
a four-time Ail-American Sunday night in
addition to his All-American status from
sophomore year.
"People thought I wouldn't be able to
contend with the top guys because they
thought I was hurt," Gill said. "Having peo
ple tell me that I can't do something is the
easiest way for me to achieve it."
Commenting on the following days' per
formances after Friday night's fall, Gill said,
"It took a lot of pressure off because there
wasn't so much expectation. It allowed me to
be really aggressive."
Also receiving All-American honors was
Derman, in fourth place with a score of a
9.562 on the rings.
Performing this well at NCAAs is rare for
a freshman â€” the more experienced juniors
and seniors tend to score higher.
"It has always been a goal of mine," Der
man said. "But, this weekend, I went in and
did better than I had expected to."
After Gill graduates this year, the young
team will have to work hard to fill his shoes.
Although this was Gill's last meet to com
pete for Stanford, he is going to stay and
train next year as a part of the Stanford pro
gram and will surely continue to be a role
model for the team.
His influence is already evident in the
freshmen phenoms.
"Whenever we go to meets, Dan always
goes over and talks to the other teams and
coaches. We always joke that he's com
peting for the 'best person in the world'
award," Derman said. "He's nice to ev
eryone and helps everyone out. During fi
nals, he was cheering for everyone, not
just his teammates. He's just a great all
around guy."
It looks like the young guns are well on
their way to filling the shoes of this "all
around" athlete, teammate, and friend.
