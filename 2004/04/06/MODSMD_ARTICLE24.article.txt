# No. 1 women's tennis knocks off USC, UCLA to remain undefeated
## 
### MIA LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There's nothing quite like raining on a
sunny. Southern California parade.
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (19-0) stayed on top of its game this
weekend with victories over No. 8 Southern
California and No. 9 UCLA.
The matches, held at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium, were a perfect testimony to the
Cardinal's well-honed form and ability to
pull out wins in trying times.
On Saturday, sophomore Alice Barnes
rallied back from being blanked in the first
set by the Bruins' Daniela Bercek.
"Overall, my game was going poorly,"
Barnes said. "My slice backhand was suffer
ing, as was my serve, and for me that tends to
throw off the entire game."
"Alice had been having a tough weekend,
after her loss to the Trojans on Saturday,"
teammate and junior Kara Guzman said.
"She showed a lot of heart in being able to
just stop and say, 'That's enough,' and save
her game."
Guzman, who has been sidelined with a
shoulder injury, watched Barnes outlast the
No. 44 freshman in the next two sets, 6-4,6-4.
"What really saved me was when I started
serving better," Barnes said. "If 1 couldn't
win her service games, at least I could hold
my own."
Bercek's loss to the Cardinal marked only
her third loss of the season. In previous ac
tion. Bercek (14-3) has posted intimidating

wins, including a three-set triumph in Pacific
-10 Conference competition over Washing
ton's seasoned No. 28 Claire Carter.
"It's safe to say that Bercek has made
quite a name for herself in tennis," Guz
man said.
For No. 15 and second singles player
Barnes (25-5), Saturday's comeback carried
extra weight after she dropped the first dual
match in her collegiate career on Friday.
The Women of Troy's Carmine Vermeulen
defeated Barnes handily in two sets, 6-4,6-4.
"It had to happen sometime," Barnes
said. "You know, I wasn't waiting for it to
happen, but I wasn't banking on going unde
feated for the entire season."
Barnes added, "I wasn't used to losing,
but I was so glad my teammates were en
couraging and pulled out the match for us."
As expected, moving up from No. 4 sin
gles as a freshman to No. 2 this year raised the
stakes for Barnes.
"At No. 2, you're definitely going to lose if
you have an off day," Barnes said. "Before
[at No. 4], I felt like I could rely on running
the ball down to clinch the points."
Heading the singles lineup, sophomore
Amber Liu downed the Bruins' Jackie
Carleton, 6-1, 6-3, and got the best of
Southern California's No. 13 Luana Mag
ani, 6-7, 7-6, 1-0.
No. 33 Liu (11-4) has had her share of ups
and downs since her debut on, and return
from, the professional circuit this fall. Her
most recent loss was a disappointing conces
sion to Carter over spring break, 4-6,6-2,6-4.

Just the same, Liu felled California's
top-ranked Raquel Kops-Jones, 6-1, 6-1,
for the first time in five meetings
last Wednesday.
"It's always tough playing the top spot,"
Guzman commented. "The pressure is in
credible, and as with everyone else, it's been
a long two weeks since spring break."
Over the past two weeks, the Cardinal has
beaten back an intense, fast-paced host of
Pac-10 foes. If it wasn't back-to-back match
es against No. 6 Washington and No. 54
Washington State, it was the No. 11 Golden
Bears on Wednesday.
Toss in the Los Angeles rivals last
weekend, and were it not for Stanford's
veteran prowess and need to defend its 16
consecutive Pac-10 titles, the Cardinal
could risk overheating.
"We're working on having more intense
practices," Liu said. "Also, we're really en
couraging team unity this time of year."
Guzman added, "It's always nice to be
ranked No. 1, and at the risk of sounding
cocky, I can say that our team knows how to
handle it."
Handling the pressure especially well are
the doubles teams, which plowed through the
competition this weekend.
The top-ranked doubles team of senior
Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin Bur
dette (23-4) posted solid 8-5 wins in both
of their showings.
And with no rest in sight, Stanford looks
ahead to its matches against Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend.

Barnes (25-5), Saturday's comeback carried
extra weight after she dropped the first dual
match in her collegiate career on Friday.
The Women of Troy's Carmine Vermeulen
defeated Barnes handily in two sets, 6-4,6-4.
"It had to happen sometime," Barnes
said. "You know, I wasn't waiting for it to
happen, but I wasn't banking on going unde
feated for the entire season."
Barnes added, "I wasn't used to losing,
but I was so glad my teammates were en
couraging and pulled out the match for us."
As expected, moving up from No. 4 sin
gles as a freshman to No. 2 this year raised the
stakes for Barnes.
"At No. 2, you're definitely going to lose if
you have an off day," Barnes said. "Before
[at No. 4], I felt like I could rely on running
the ball down to clinch the points."
Heading the singles lineup, sophomore
Amber Liu downed the Bruins' Jackie
Carleton, 6-1, 6-3, and got the best of
Southern California's No. 13 Luana Mag
ani, 6-7, 7-6, 1-0.
No. 33 Liu (11-4) has had her share of ups
and downs since her debut on, and return
from, the professional circuit this fall. Her
most recent loss was a disappointing conces
sion to Carter over spring break, 4-6,6-2,6-4.

Just the same, Liu felled California's
top-ranked Raquel Kops-Jones, 6-1, 6-1,
for the first time in five meetings
last Wednesday.
"It's always tough playing the top spot,"
Guzman commented. "The pressure is in
credible, and as with everyone else, it's been
a long two weeks since spring break."
Over the past two weeks, the Cardinal has
beaten back an intense, fast-paced host of
Pac-10 foes. If it wasn't back-to-back match
es against No. 6 Washington and No. 54
Washington State, it was the No. 11 Golden
Bears on Wednesday.
Toss in the Los Angeles rivals last
weekend, and were it not for Stanford's
veteran prowess and need to defend its 16
consecutive Pac-10 titles, the Cardinal
could risk overheating.
"We're working on having more intense
practices," Liu said. "Also, we're really en
couraging team unity this time of year."
Guzman added, "It's always nice to be
ranked No. 1, and at the risk of sounding
cocky, I can say that our team knows how to
handle it."
Handling the pressure especially well are
the doubles teams, which plowed through the
competition this weekend.
The top-ranked doubles team of senior
Lauren Barnikow and junior Erin Bur
dette (23-4) posted solid 8-5 wins in both
of their showings.
And with no rest in sight, Stanford looks
ahead to its matches against Arizona and
Arizona State this weekend.

There's nothing quite like raining on a
sunny. Southern California parade.
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (19-0) stayed on top of its game this
weekend with victories over No. 8 Southern
California and No. 9 UCLA.
The matches, held at Taube Family Ten
nis Stadium, were a perfect testimony to the
Cardinal's well-honed form and ability to
pull out wins in trying times.
On Saturday, sophomore Alice Barnes
rallied back from being blanked in the first
set by the Bruins' Daniela Bercek.
"Overall, my game was going poorly,"
Barnes said. "My slice backhand was suffer
ing, as was my serve, and for me that tends to
throw off the entire game."
"Alice had been having a tough weekend,
after her loss to the Trojans on Saturday,"
teammate and junior Kara Guzman said.
"She showed a lot of heart in being able to
just stop and say, 'That's enough,' and save
her game."
Guzman, who has been sidelined with a
shoulder injury, watched Barnes outlast the
No. 44 freshman in the next two sets, 6-4,6-4.
"What really saved me was when I started
serving better," Barnes said. "If 1 couldn't
win her service games, at least I could hold
my own."
Bercek's loss to the Cardinal marked only
her third loss of the season. In previous ac
tion. Bercek (14-3) has posted intimidating

wins, including a three-set triumph in Pacific
-10 Conference competition over Washing
ton's seasoned No. 28 Claire Carter.
"It's safe to say that Bercek has made
quite a name for herself in tennis," Guz
man said.
For No. 15 and second singles player
Barnes (25-5), Saturday's comeback carried
extra weight after she dropped the first dual
match in her collegiate career on Friday.
The Women of Troy's Carmine Vermeulen
defeated Barnes handily in two sets, 6-4,6-4.
