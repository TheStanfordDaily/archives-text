# Women's polo defeated by top-ranked USC
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Unless they meet in the postseason,
as Stanford would like. Southern Cali
fornia women's water polo (17-0, 8-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation)
can claim superiority over Stanford
(14-3. 6-1) this year.
No. 2 Stanford headed south to play
USC and UC-Santa Barbara where it
split the weekend games, falling 8-4 to
the Women of Troy and defeating the
Gauchos, 6-1.
Stanford fell for the third and final
time in regular season play to the No. 1
Women of Troy. Adding to the pain of
Stanford's loss is that unlike previous
matches between the teams this year,
this game actually counted in the con
ference standings.
A victory over USC could have pro
pelled Stanford to the top of the stand
ings and finally have given the Trojans
a blemish on their perfect record.
Instead USC remains on a season
long tear through its schedule and the
Cardinal must look back at a season
marred only by losses to the Women
of Troy.

The energy the Cardinal had com
ing into the much anticipated match
between the nation's top-ranked
teams showed as things got underway
at McDonald's Swim Stadium.
The Trojans scored first, but Stan
ford's Alison Gregorka tied the score
less than a minute later. After Eszter
Gyori put the Women of Troy up by one,
senior Kelty Luber tied it up yet again.
But the Trojans were able to score
once more in the first period and
from then on, Stanford's game plan
fell to pieces.
Stanford's usual hard-hitting of
fense and solid defense disappeared
for the remainder of the match.
After the first period, the Trojans
never looked back, as Stanford al
lowed them to score five more unan
swered goals, including three by fresh
man Erika Figge.
Finding some good among the bad,
goalkeeper Meridith McColl ex
plained, "We did a good job shutting
(USC] down in the hole" but was quick
to add on that "USC put away some
stellar bar-in outside shots."
The Cardinal was held scoreless
until the fourth. Sophomore Laurel

Champion and Luber scored Stan
ford's final goals.
"We just need to put the ball away
for good," McColl said.
The squad was able to do that
against Santa Barbara.
"The game against UCSB was a
mental victory," said McColl, who
backed by an improved defense. "It
showed that we could move forward
after the loss to USC, rather than dwell
on it."
With minds refreshed, the Cardinal
came out strong. The offense that had
disappeared for periods in Saturday's
match came back with a strong effort.
The Cardinal was up three by the
time the Gauchos were able to get on
the scoreboard in the third period. Se
nior co-captain Wendy Watkins net
ted two goals.
Four of her teammates, Scotti
Shafer, Hannah Luber, Christine
Hewko and Katie Hansen also scored
for the Cardinal.
Stanford's defense shut out Santa
Barbara until sophomore Jenifer
D'Anna scored the Gauchos' only goal.
The Cardinal will face California and
Pacific at home this weekend.
