## Cal Web site on evolution draws criticism from creationists 
### DMITRI PIKMAN DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES â€” High school and mid
dle school teachers teaching evolution in their classrooms
may find their jobs somewhat easier with the creation of a
new Web site by scientists at University of California at
Berkeley aimed at aiding teachers in conducting evolu
tion-related studies.
But the site, created by the University of California
Museum of Paleontology at Berkeley, has already drawn
its share of criticism from creationism-oriented groups.
John Rajca, museum director at the Institute for Cre
ation Research, said the Web site is used to promote a par
ticular point of view instead of showing the entire picture.
"It's useful in order to perpetuate some of the myths
(about evolution), and the whole picture is not being put
out there," Rajca said.
Creationist organizations, such as the ICR. advocate a

creation theory based on religion, stating that a higher
power was responsible for the creation of life on earth.
Evolution-related organizations believe life on earth
came about as a result of the scientific evolution of partic
ular biological species.
Ellen Simms, UC Berkeley professor of integrative biol
ogy and evolutionary ecologist, said it makes sense for the
paleontology museum to advocate evolution on its Website.
"The UCMP is a scientific institution, and the fact of
evolution and the theories associated with it are scientific,
while creationism it not. So it was entirely appropriate for
UCMP to focus solely on evolution," Simms said.
Rajca, though, said it is such an attitude that creates a
negative view of creationism.
"We at the ICR are research scientists, and we put out
useful information. We would basically like all the evi
dence that is out there to be taught, and we believe that if
that were the case, creationism would have risen to the
top," Rajca said.

"Currently it would he unthinkable for any university
to have a Web site that supports creationism. A belief in
anything that might entail a designer is thought to be a no
no," he added.
The Supreme Court has ruled in the past that a re
quirement that creation science be taught in public schools
violates the Establishment Clause, which in effect vali
dates the teaching of evolution in classrooms nationwide.
The Establishment Clause, known to many as the "sep
aration of church and state," forbids the government from
taking any part in the promotion of religion.
But certain school districts still have broad discretion in
choosing topics to be covered in their schools, which keeps
the debate over evolution versus creationism alive.
Judy Scotchmoor, director of education and public
programs at the UCMP. said the purpose of the Web site
is not to further ignite the debate.
"We were not focusing on the controversy. We strong
ly feel that if people knew what science is and what it isn't,

there will not be any controversy," Scotchmoor said.
Some sections of the site deal with the pitfalls teachers
might face in trying to teach evolution and ways in which
educators might combat those roadblocks.
Some of the suggestions include not using the terms
"design" or "creature," since both of these suggest a cre
ator and might confuse students learning about evolution.
Scotchmoor said the roadblocks portion of the Web
site is a minor part of the information provided, with the
majority of the site dedicated to resources to help educa
tors improve the study of evolution in their classrooms.
"We've noticed that evolution is often treated as a unit
instead of as a backbone to biology, and often it is located
at the end of the book, which means it might not be taught,
or not taught well," Scotchmoor said.
"I myself was a teacher fora very long time, and stu
dents can be very curious asking questions. We simply
give strategies and try to provide teachers with sufficient
content to answer them," she added.
