# CD sales not affected by music downloading

### JARON GANDELMAN THE DAILY FREE PRESS 
(U-WIRE) BOSTON â€”The Record
ing Industry Association of America's war
on file-sharing had a setback last week
when a joint study between the Harvard
University Business School and the Univer
sity of North Carolina-Chapel Hill conclud
ed that downloading music over the Inter
net has had little impact on CD sales and
could even increase sales.
"It takes 5,000 downloads to reduce the
sales of an album by just one copy," said
Harvard Business School associate profes
sor Felix Oberholzer-Gee, who co-au
thored the study with UNC-Chapel Hill
professor Koleman Strumpf. He said he
considers the ratio to be almost negligible.
With popular artists, CD sales actually
increased when the number of downloads
did, according to the study released March
29. According to the report, "150 down
loads [of popular songs] increases sales by
one copy." The research team said the re
sults surprised them at first, but after re
viewing the data, there was no doubt it
was correct.
The study also includes data on which
music genres were most likely to be down
loaded, with music from the top current bill
board charts leading the list. Alternative
and hard rock were also downloaded fre
quently, while jazz, Latin and new artists
were least likely to be downloaded.
Downloaders in the United States repre
sent 31 percent of worldwide users, and
they download 36 percent qf all files, ac
cording to the study. Germany is second
with 13 percent of all users, followed by
Italy, Japan and France. Oberholzer-Gee
indicated that with a strong foreign partici
pation in file sharing, any law focusing on
the United States is not likely to significant
ly alter the supply of music online.
Oberholzer-Gee said the study is unique
and more accurate than previous studies
that have relied only on surveys, because
their study compiled download data direct
ly from KaZaA, a popular file-sharing pro

gram. The data included direct computer
oversight of 1.75 million downloads and CD
sales statistics from the second half of 2002.
He added that surveys do not always pro
vide accurate data because it is impossible
to know if participants respond truthfully.
Due to the study's recent release, it has
not yet been endorsed by additional re
searchers, but the RIAA, a strong oppo
nent of the study, released a response point
ing out the lack of support for the study, and
highlighting weaknesses.
"The results are inconsistent with virtu
ally every other study done by academics
and research analysts about the impact of il
legal file-sharing," RIAA Senior Vice Pres
ident of Communications Amy Weiss said
in an email. "The study does not appear ca
pable of indicating whether downloading
has caused a decline in sales overall."
Weiss also criticized the authors of the
study for devoting only 17 weeks to data
collection. The 17-week period included
the Christmas season, which is the heaviest
selling period of the year.
"It is like noticing the sky is clear and
concluding that this has been the sunniest
decade in history," she said. Weiss also said
the study based its conclusions on only 2.7
percent of the data collected, and that the
sample size was smaller than any other
study that has been conducted.
University of Texas at Dallas Economics
professor Stan Liebowitz, who has led sev
eral studies on the effects of technology on
copyrighted material since the late 19705,
outlined several fallbacks of the recent
study by Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf. He
criticized the study's conclusion that with
popular albums, record sales increase when
downloads increase.
"Would this demonstrate that overall
sales increase when downloads increase?
Of course not," Liebowitz said in a letter
to Oberholzer-Gee and Strumpf posted
on his website. "Similarly, political adver
tising clearly increases the market share
of individual candidates, but it need not,
and probably does not, increase the total
voter turnout."
