# Anti-Arab ad sparks controversy
## 
### JORGE ARAUZ THE MIAMI HURRICANE 
(U-WIRE) CORAL GABLES, Fla. â€” David
Horowitz, head of the Center for the Study of Pop
ular Culture, recently submitted an ad to The Hur
ricane that presented his view of the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict, opening the floodgates for Univer
sity of Miami student groups to unite and discuss
the issue.
This is not the first time Horowitz has done this.
Most recently, in 2001, he submitted an anti-slav
ery reparation ad to 72 universities, sparking im
mense debate and controversy. It led to theft of
newspapers that chose to run the ad as well as in
tense protests.
During the past week, representatives from
OASIS, the Jewish Student Organization [JSO], Is
lamic Society of UM [ISUM] and Hillel met with
administration. Student Government [SG] Presi
dent Vance Aloupis and The Hurricane s Editor in
Chief Leigha Taber to express their thoughts on the
contents of the ad and whether it should run in the
paper. The outcome: a resounding "No.
"The past few weeks has shown unity among
many of the different cultural, religious and minor
ity groups on campus, and this seems to be continu
ing that trend," said Minal Ahson, president of the
Council of International Student Organizations.
Dr. Pat Whitely, vice president for student affairs,
made the final decision not to run the ad because it
violated the newspaper's advertising policies.
Lourdes La Paz, deputy general council for l)M.
attended most of the meetings regarding the ad and
gave Whitely legal advice regarding the issue.
La Paz agrees with the final decision.
"I respect and understand her decision it was
consistent with the Student Publications Board
Policies and Procedures Manual and done in the ut
most good faith." La Paz said.
Gilbert Arias, assistant vice president for stu

dent affairs directly responsible for student media,
says he is in full support of UM s advertising policies
and Whitely's decision.
"The purpose of the advertising standards is to
maintain advertising integrity and quality and to
prevent false and misleading advertising that is un
acceptably repugnant and adversely affects the in
tegrity and credibility of student publications as
sources of truthful and accurate information or that
is in conflict with the basic educational mission of
the University," Arias said.
Vance Aloupis, new SG president, agrees with
Arias.
"Anything that would upset or put down stu
dents at UM is unacceptable," Aloupis said.
In 1994, The Hurricane published an ad that de
nied that the Holocaust actually occurred, which
proved to have immense consequences for the Uni
versity. A donor withheld a $2 million donation to
UM, while thousands of students rallied against the
ad. As a result, the UM Board of Trustees ordered
the newspaper to prohibit all ads deemed "hateful
or misleading."
Dr. Pete Moore, assistant professor for the po
litical science department, distributed copies of the
ad to his students after receiving a copy from a con
cerned student leader who wanted his reaction to
the situation.
Moore says his students generally found the ad
to be offensive.
"I think these types of issues are healthy because
it encourages academic debate on campus," Moore
said. "By handing out the ad, I publicized what was
going on far beyond the discussions at the meetings
with administrators and student leaders."
According to the Student Press Law Center,
political ads receive more First Amendment
protection than commcrcial ads because they
sell an idea rather than a product or service.
However, a student newspaper staff has the right
to reject any ad.
