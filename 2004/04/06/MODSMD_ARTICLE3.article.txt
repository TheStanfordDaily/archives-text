### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
Three Stanford students were
awarded Luce and Churchill scholar
ships this year. Michael Osofsky,
Class of '03, and senior Martha
Roberts are two of 18 students cho
sen for the Luce Scholarship and
Alex Greninger, Class of '03, is one
of 10 students chosen for the
Churchill Scholarship.
The Luce scholarship places stu
dents with one-year internships in
an Asian country, and the Churchill
scholarship pays for one year of
graduate education in engineering,
math and sciences at Winston
Churchill College in Cambridge,
England. Stanford is allowed to
nominate two people for each
scholarship every year. According
to John Pearson, director of the
Bechtel International Center, last
year there was one Luce scholar
and no Churchill scholars.
Greninger graduated from
Stanford with an master's in bio
logical sciences and honors bache
lor's in international relations. He
completed three honors theses in
international security studies, in
ternational relations and biologi
cal sciences, and was a Rhodes
Scholar finalist in 2003.
Over the course of his undergrad
uate career he did lab research at
Stanford. London, and Spain, and
advised the government of West
Bengal. At Stanford, Greninger was
a Daily columnist and an IFC repre
sentative of Sigma Nu. He was also
an Academic Advisor and house
host for Admit Weekend at Branner.
Greninger said that he plans on
completing an M.Phil, in Epidemi
ology, the study of disease ill popu
lations. Greninger added that he
wants to ultimately get a doctorate
and an medical degree and pursue a
career in public health with the
World Health Organization.
"The WHO has very strong credi
bility," Greninger said. "When given
funding they do a very good job, and
I think they are going to be real im
portant in terms of controlling infec
tious diseases in the future."
According to Stanford's Scholar
ship Biography Web site, Martha
Roberts majored in Earth Science
and graduated with distinction and
honors through the Goldman Pro
gram in Environmental Science,
Technology and Policy. She won a

Goldman Thesis Prize for her analy
sis of West Africa, focusing on how
the region's cotton industry is at risk
to commodity price fluctuations and
how agriculture in general is threat
ened by climate change.
Roberts is a coterminal Earth
Systems student who will graduate
this June, and she will use the schol
arship to study agriculture and sus
tainability issues in Asia.
Osofsky who graduated in 2003
with an honors bachelor's and an
master's in psychology, said that his
undergraduate research examined
the death penalty and included
more than 300 interviews with cor
rectional officers directly involved
in conducting executions in three
southern states. He was selected by
USA-Today to their all-USA first
academic team, an honor recogniz
ing the top 20 college students na
tionwide for overall excellence in
academics, leadership, and ex
tracurricular pursuits.
Osofsky was a two-time ASSU
senator and former president of the
Stanford Undergraduate Psycholo
gy Association. He is currently
studying human rights and criminal
justice in Belfast under a Mitchell
scholarship which is awarded to 12
Americans every year.
Osofsky said that he will use the
Luce scholarship to go to Hong
Kong, where he will work with a
hotel or restauranteur in manage
ment and cooking. In addition, Os
ofsky plans on studying psychology,
government, and the Chinese crimi
nal justice system.
Osofsky added that he plans on
eventually pursuing a doctorate in
organizational behavior and going
on to work for the government as
an advisor on the national level.
Osofsky said that his interests in
the criminal justice system stem
* from his upbringing in New Or
leans, a city he called "plagued by
poverty, crime and a degree of un
derlying racism."
"I authored a proposal, raised
funding and helped get off the
ground an alternative school for
first-time juvenile offenders, enti
tled the Youth Leadership Pro
gram, and hope to develop other
diversionary programs to help
those born into very difficult envi
ronments from falling into a life of
crime and ending up in a maxi
mum-security penitentiaries," Os
ofsky said.
