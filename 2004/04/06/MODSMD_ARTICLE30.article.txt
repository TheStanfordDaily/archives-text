# Abducted girl's story inconsistent according to Madison police
## 
### MATTHEW DOLBEY BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. — Madison Police say they
have found inconsistencies in University of Wisconsin
sophomore Audrey Seiler's story after she admitted she was
not abducted from her apartment. Madison Police are not
pursuing an armed suspect that could have abducted Seiler
four days before her finding.
At a press conference Friday afternoon, police chief
Noble Wray said the Madison police department obtained
additional information leading investigators to believe
Seiler's story was bogus.
"[We believe] Audrey Seiler was not abducted at knife
point," Wray said at the press conference. "We do not be
lieve that there is a suspect at large, period."
Wray pointed out several "inconsistencies" in Seiler's
statement about her abduction from her Regent apartment
Saturday morning, and then her added testimony saying
she was not abducted from her apartment but at the marsh
in southern Madison where she was found.
"We are committed and compelled to investigate all
leads," Wray said, adding it is the police department's duty
to do so for Seiler herself, her family and the community.
Wray said it was worth noting Seiler left from a video
surveillanced door at the Regent, where there are at least
two other doors at the residence hall that do not have
video cameras.
Police also said items found at the marsh — a knife, a
roll of duct tape, rope and some cold medicine, could easi
ly be purchased at a local convenient store. Police added
they have obtained store surveillance tapes dated prior to
Seiler's disappearance where she reportedly purchased
these items.
A clerk at the Your Open Pantry at 1401 Regent Street
and across the street from the Regent, wished not to be
identified, but said police did seize their security tapes.
"Everything on that list [of items found at the scene], we
have here," the clerk told the Badger Herald, adding it is
quite possible they were bought at the convenience store.
Seiler said these objects were used against her and a
doctor at St. Mary's Hospital said she did not sustain
any noticeable injuries but said she was recovering

from being constrained. Wray countered this by saying
the doctor's statements were not part of Madison's on
going investigation.
Wray also said there are two witnesses who've seen
Audrey walking around Madison, where she told police
she was held against her will. Wray also said that Seiler's
computer's history showed a user looked up a five-day
weather forecast, and searched the Internet for
"marshy" and "wooded" areas around Madison before
her disappearance.
The police have also found that her computer's log
indicates someone or some persons used Seiler's com
puter in her room since Saturday. Though Wray did not
say the police have obtained any evidence Seiler re
turned to her Regent apartment, he did says they did
not rule it out. Wray admitted police were not stationed
at her personal apartment during the citywide search
for Seiler; and due to the fact some entrances do not
have security cameras, one could slip into the Regent
relatively undetected.
Wray said police are still investigating the incident, and
did not rule out filing charges against Seiler in the future.
Seiler, though police have debunked her story, has not
"admitted to" lying about an abduction at this time.
"It's still too early," Wray said. "We have been in con
tact with the district attorney."
Wray did not draw a direct connection to Seiler's ap
parently false story with a February incident where she re
ported she was struck in the back of the head, knocked un
conscious and regained composure at a different location.
UW Dean of Students Luoluo Hong released a state
ment, stating her commitment and support to Seiler, her
family and friends through this "trying time."
However, she added students take responsibility
for themselves.
"While we do not condone the behavior attributed to
Audrey by the Madison Police Department, we fully un
derstand that people communicate their need for help in
many different ways," Hong said in her statement.
Hong said all or any students having problems or feel the
need of counseling can use the numerous resources UW has
to offer, including staff in the dean's office, academic staff,
advisors and house fellows in the residence halls.

advisors and house fellows in the residence halls.
