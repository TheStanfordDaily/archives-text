### STACY WAITE BADGER HERALD 
(U-WIRE) MADISON, Wis. â€” A Southern University
registrar employee accepted bribes to change grades from
more than 500 students, Chancellor Edward Jackson said
in a press conference April 1.
Jackson said 541 undergraduate and graduate students
at Southern University, the nation's largest historically
black university in the nation, paid to have up to 20 grades
changed in past and present records.
The university uncovered the operation by discovering
false computer records, including a case in which the uni
versity awarded the student a degree that she did not earn,
Jackson said in the conference.
East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Douglas
Moreau has adopted the case from the university and told
the Associated Press he intends to prosecute students and

university employees involved in the scandal aggressively.
Moreau also said possible charges filed in the case
could include forgery, bribery and filing untrue
records. The investigation spans more than 2,000 po
tential grade switches.
The university's investigation began in March 2003 con
cerning admissions to a university graduate program. A
student claimed she had earned a bachelor's degree from
the university but the school had no record of the woman's
graduation.
The woman's claim alerted university officials, who
then discovered a multitude of other errors in the univer
sity's academic records.
Jackson said in the conference that the university has
begun to contact the 541 past and current students who
allegedly bribed the registrar employee. Each student is
entitled to a hearing before an administrative and facul
ty panel.
