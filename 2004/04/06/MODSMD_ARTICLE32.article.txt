(U-WIRE) AUSTIN, Texas — Professors will be able
to get feedback from their students throughout the semes
ter with an online evaluation system the University of
Texas is currently testing before making it available for all
courses next fall.
Six types of course surveys will be available through
the UT Direct system for professors to distribute dur
ing the semester to find out what students think about
their classes.
"It allows the students to directly communicate with
their professor about concerns and things they like going
on in the class, so [professors] can make changes prior to
the end of the year," said Rusty Ince, chairman of the Sen
ate of College Councils.
The Senate and the Division of Instructional Innovation
and Assessment have been working together for four years
to implement the program. They based it on a similar sys
tem at the University of Wisconsin.
"All good relationships are based on good communica
tion. The more ways we have for students and faculty to

communicate, the better," said Judy Ashcroft, director of
the division. "We also wanted to build something that
wouldn't cost students anything."
Four professors from different colleges within the Uni
versity are involved in the pilot program, which began
March 22. Staff plan on enhancing the system over the sum
mer based on the success of the pilot program, said Shan
Evans, associate director of the Measurement and Evalua
tion Center.
"We're waiting on feedback from the faculty and stu
dents," she said. "In the fall, we will open this up for cam
pus-wide use."
The survey responses will be anonymous, so students
cannot be punished for their responses. Likewise, depart
ments will not receive the results, so they will not affect a
professor's job status.
Professors can use them as much or as little as they
want. They can also customize the surveys to ask ques
tions about specific lectures or guest speakers, Ince
said.
"We're expecting broad use this fall," Ince said. "We
should focus on improving teaching effectiveness as much
as we talk about research and grades."
