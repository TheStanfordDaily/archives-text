# Student groups voice support for preferred ASSU candidates
## 
### CORINA YEN STAFF WRITER 
In this year's competitive election for ASSU presi
dent and vice president, many student groups have come
out in support of the various slates. Most groups have
cited firsthand knowledge of the candidates, demon
strated leadership skills and confidence in the candi
dates' commitment to issues important to them as rea
sons for supporting the groups.
The candidates' personal involvement and demon
strated commitment with student groups has influenced
many of the endorsements.
"I've worked with [Ajani Husbands and Alyssa
Schwartz] in the past, and 1 don't have any doubts about
their sincerity or capacity to lead and represent stu
dents." said sophomore Joseles De La Cruz, a member
of MEChA. "1 think many other students who have in
teracted with them would feel the same way."
Student Organizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
President Joan MacMillan, a senior, said, "Both Mikey
Lee and Dylan Mefford have shown a commitment to
finding reasonable and feasible solutions to the chal
lenges facing the arts and arts groups on campus. They
aren't just making big promises, but rather are concen
trating on what can really be accomplished."
The Students of Color Coalition, a conglomerate of
major ethnic groups on campus including the Asian
American Student Association, Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, is endorsing Husbands-Schwartz.
SOCC's endorsement is a pledge to encourage its
membership and members of associated organizations to
vote Husbands-Schwartz, explained Francisco Cende
jas. president of MEChA and a junior.
"SOCC endorsed Husbands-Schwartz because

they had a very complete understanding of what the
specific needs of the major ethnic communities and
what their specific umbrella organizations were,"
Cendejas said.
"They have already demonstrated their commitment
through their involvement with various SOCC-related
interests, and their platform shows clearly that they want
to work to address a variety of student concerns from
Stanford's diverse community," De La Cruz said.
Freshman Katherine Roubos, president of LGBT ac
tivist group Querillas, said that Querillas supports Hus
bands-Schwartz because of the candidates' commitment
to the group's issues and to advocacy of minority groups.
"They will help the LGBT community continue to
put pressure on the administration to increase support
from the administration," Roubos said.
Roubos has met with Husbands and Schwartz to ex
plain the needs of the LGBT community and the
Querillas group has also worked with them on other
policy issues.
Student groups endorsing Lee-Mefford cited the
slate's realistic platform and demonstrated ability to ac
complish goals of important student issues.
The current Senior Class presidents support Lee-
Mefford — although Lee himself is one of the presidents
— because of the candidates' extensive experience and
their strong platform, according to Senior Class Presi
dent Ryan Taylor.
"We have worked with Lee extensively throughout
the year and know his abilities and commitment inside
out; they are the ideal traits for success as ASSU pres
ident," Taylor said. "He is extremely dedicated to the
University, to his role and to contributing to the stu
dent body."
The current Junior Class presidents are endorsing
Lee-Mefford because the slate exemplifies what they see

as effective leadership with a realistic goal, said Junior
Class Presidents Alex Bradford, Valerie Rozycki, Subha
Srinivas and Ebony Nyenya in a statement.
"Together, they have more collective experience and
also just more years of being students at Stanford — this
gives them an edge when it comes to understanding what
best serves the student body and what kinds of goals are
realistic and which are simply empty campaign promis
es," the statement said.
The Stanford Chaparral is endorsing Charlie Stock
man and Matthew Henick.
"As an intimately trusted society of cultural commen
tators, it would be irresponsible to base endorsements on
what we perceive candidates could do for us if elected,"
said senior Steve Yelderman, co-editor of The Stanford
Chaparral. "Rather, the Chaparral endorsement is al
ways linked with an interest in advancing the cause of the
common Stanford student."
Yelderman said that the decision to endorse
Stockman-Henick ultimately came down to the re
sults of extensive statistical polling, which showed
that they were incontrovertibly going to be the next
ASSU presidents.
"The Chappie picks winners," Yelderman said. "You
ask Nadiya Figureoa, Monica Henestroza or Brent Bar
ton who put them in office, and they'll give you the name

of the second-oldest humor magazine in the country.
"When it comes down to it, democracy is a fickle lover.
We can't change her attitude, so the best we can do is pull
her strings."
Other groups, when asked by The Daily, said that
they were not officially supporting any slate. These
groups include the inter-fraternity council, the inter
sorority council, the Stanford Republicans and the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition.

best serves the student body and what kinds of goals are
realistic and which are simply empty campaign promis
es," the statement said.
The Stanford Chaparral is endorsing Charlie Stock
man and Matthew Henick.
"As an intimately trusted society of cultural commen
tators, it would be irresponsible to base endorsements on
what we perceive candidates could do for us if elected,"
said senior Steve Yelderman, co-editor of The Stanford
Chaparral. "Rather, the Chaparral endorsement is al
ways linked with an interest in advancing the cause of the
common Stanford student."
Yelderman said that the decision to endorse
Stockman-Henick ultimately came down to the re
sults of extensive statistical polling, which showed
that they were incontrovertibly going to be the next
ASSU presidents.
"The Chappie picks winners," Yelderman said. "You
ask Nadiya Figureoa, Monica Henestroza or Brent Bar
ton who put them in office, and they'll give you the name

of the second-oldest humor magazine in the country.
"When it comes down to it, democracy is a fickle lover.
We can't change her attitude, so the best we can do is pull
her strings."
Other groups, when asked by The Daily, said that
they were not officially supporting any slate. These
groups include the inter-fraternity council, the inter
sorority council, the Stanford Republicans and the Stan
ford Labor Action Coalition.
In this year's competitive election for ASSU presi
dent and vice president, many student groups have come
out in support of the various slates. Most groups have
cited firsthand knowledge of the candidates, demon
strated leadership skills and confidence in the candi
dates' commitment to issues important to them as rea
sons for supporting the groups.
The candidates' personal involvement and demon
strated commitment with student groups has influenced
many of the endorsements.
"I've worked with [Ajani Husbands and Alyssa
Schwartz] in the past, and 1 don't have any doubts about
their sincerity or capacity to lead and represent stu
dents." said sophomore Joseles De La Cruz, a member
of MEChA. "1 think many other students who have in
teracted with them would feel the same way."
Student Organizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA)
President Joan MacMillan, a senior, said, "Both Mikey
Lee and Dylan Mefford have shown a commitment to
finding reasonable and feasible solutions to the chal
lenges facing the arts and arts groups on campus. They
aren't just making big promises, but rather are concen
trating on what can really be accomplished."
The Students of Color Coalition, a conglomerate of
major ethnic groups on campus including the Asian
American Student Association, Black Student Union,
MEChA and the Stanford American Indian Organiza
tion, is endorsing Husbands-Schwartz.
SOCC's endorsement is a pledge to encourage its
membership and members of associated organizations to
vote Husbands-Schwartz, explained Francisco Cende
jas. president of MEChA and a junior.
"SOCC endorsed Husbands-Schwartz because

they had a very complete understanding of what the
specific needs of the major ethnic communities and
what their specific umbrella organizations were,"
Cendejas said.
"They have already demonstrated their commitment
through their involvement with various SOCC-related
interests, and their platform shows clearly that they want
to work to address a variety of student concerns from
Stanford's diverse community," De La Cruz said.
Freshman Katherine Roubos, president of LGBT ac
tivist group Querillas, said that Querillas supports Hus
bands-Schwartz because of the candidates' commitment
to the group's issues and to advocacy of minority groups.
"They will help the LGBT community continue to
put pressure on the administration to increase support
from the administration," Roubos said.
Roubos has met with Husbands and Schwartz to ex
plain the needs of the LGBT community and the
Querillas group has also worked with them on other
policy issues.
Student groups endorsing Lee-Mefford cited the
slate's realistic platform and demonstrated ability to ac
complish goals of important student issues.
The current Senior Class presidents support Lee-
Mefford — although Lee himself is one of the presidents
— because of the candidates' extensive experience and
their strong platform, according to Senior Class Presi
dent Ryan Taylor.
"We have worked with Lee extensively throughout
the year and know his abilities and commitment inside
out; they are the ideal traits for success as ASSU pres
ident," Taylor said. "He is extremely dedicated to the
University, to his role and to contributing to the stu
dent body."
The current Junior Class presidents are endorsing
Lee-Mefford because the slate exemplifies what they see

as effective leadership with a realistic goal, said Junior
Class Presidents Alex Bradford, Valerie Rozycki, Subha
Srinivas and Ebony Nyenya in a statement.
"Together, they have more collective experience and
also just more years of being students at Stanford — this
gives them an edge when it comes to understanding what
best serves the student body and what kinds of goals are
realistic and which are simply empty campaign promis
es," the statement said.
