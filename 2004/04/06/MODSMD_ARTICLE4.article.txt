from her position as assistant dean of students and judicial offi
cer on April 16. She has accepted the appointment of assistant
vice president for student affairs at New York University and
will begin her new duties on May 10.
Rick Yuen will serve as interim judicial officer in addition to
his role as assistant dean and director of the Asian American
Activities Center beginning April 19 and ending Aug. 31.
Yuen's past experience in judicial affairs includes serving as
a hearing dean, a judicial counselor and a previous appointment
as interim judicial officer. He has worked closely with Morrison
as colleagues under the dean of students.
"I have utmost respect for Nancy Morrison's work and she
will be missed by many colleagues on campus," Yuen said. "She
has created many efficiencies in our Judicial Affairs process that
will continue to serve us well for many years."
Dean of Students Greg Boardman echoed Yuen's admiration
for Morrison's accomplishments.
"In the short time I have been at Stanford, I have come to
respect and admire her capabilities, and. as a result, to rely
upon her for advice and counsel," he said. "Nancy has
earned the respect and admiration of students, faculty and
staff in carrying out myriad responsibilities, including Stan
ford's judicial system, partnering with Stanford's schools in
educating programming and coordinating various student
life initiatives."
"I believe we have demonstrated that a judicial process can
be implemented with fairness, compassion and kindness," Mor
rison said. "Finally, we have made significant progress to build
good working relationships with the student governments, the
Faculty and our governing Board on Judicial Affairs."
Morrison expressed sadness at leaving the people at Stanford
but excitement for the opportunities her position at NYU has in
store for her.
"I am looking forward to having a broader scope of re
sponsibilities," she said. "While I am excited about moving to
NYU and this new professional opportunity, I am very sad to
leave Stanford because I have enjoyed being part of such an
amazing team. I have worked with so many brilliant, thought
ful and compassionate people."
