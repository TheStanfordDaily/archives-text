Businesses must be willing to
experiment with new ideas in
order to survive, said Brandon
Burgess, the keynote speaker at
this year's Future of Entertain
ment Conference.
Burgess spoke last Saturday
about his work at NBC, where
he is an executive vice president
of business development, and
said the major challenge for the
company was the shift to digital
media, which raised the threat
of piracy. He noted he found
the collapse of the music indus
try "frightening."
A less business-oriented per
spective came from Gideon
Yago, a popular MTV video
jockey. Yago discussed how
America's obsession with what
is cool had been supplanted by
what he called a "reality eye," as

shown by the popularity of real
ity television shows. He argued
that politicians will eventually
have to embrace the reality eye
to satisfy the public's desire for
a real person.
"Bill Clinton was the first cool
president," Yago said, referring
to the former U.S. president's ap
pearances on late night talk
shows and MTV.
The entertainment conference
started five years ago while the
industry was in flux due to the In
ternet revolution. Now the con
ference addresses a wide range of
issues, from sports business to
media in China. The conference
sought to instruct participants
about positioning organizations
for the future in a rapidly chang
ing world.
Participants attended panel
sessions throughout the day on
topics from electronic gaming to

investing in media.
One of the panel sessions fo
cused on the future of the rela
tionship between artists and
corporate music companies.
Cosma Panzacchi, a first year
MBA, said he found the pan
elist's views refreshing.
"In business, too often we for
get about people," he said.
The conference was not just
limited to Stanford students.
Christopher Cary, a student at
UCLA, attended the conference
while on spring break. Accord
ing to Cary, "technology needs
to change" to prevent catastro
phes such as the music indus
try's collapse.
The conference emphasized
the role that students and busi
ness innovators play in shaping
the future of entertainment. As
Burgess put it,"The future of
media is you."
