### MARI SUZUKI 
Taking advantage of Stanford's
proximity to Silicon Valley and
Asia, a weeklong student-initiated
summit that began yesterday brings
together leaders in business, mem
bers of the international community
and students to promote global en
trepreneurship.
The summit's purpose is to expose
students to business practicality and
technology with a global perspective,
said junior Evan Tana, vice president
of Asia-Pacific Student Entrepre
neurship Society (ASES), which is
running the conference. He also
noted that it will serve as a place for
young entrepreneurs to globally net
work, given the international diversi
ty of the attendees. Forty-five partici
pants are attending from Asia.
"It's really cool because when we
go to their conferences in Asia, they
know us already," he said, referring
to a similar conference run each
summer in Asia.
The series of workshops and lec
tures titled "Think Global! Innova
tion and Entrepreneurship in a
Global Economy," will include
among many lectures, a talk by for

mer CEO of Handspring, Donna
Dubinsky on entrepreneurship in the
high tech industry. In addition to
workshops ranging from a crash
course in venture capital to team
building exercises, there will be com
pany visits from Nummi, a joint ven
ture between Toyota and GM, and
Atheros, a leading security company.
The conference runs all week in the
Center for Integrated Systems Audi
torium and is open to the public.
"The summit is not only a great
opportunity to build a business net
work with people from the Asia-Pa
cific — it's also a great time to build
life-long friendships," said ASES
president Elain Szu, a senior.
ASES is a global student organiza
tion that began at Stanford and now
has chapters in five countries. They
hold two conferences each year —
one at Stanford in April and one dur
ing the summer in Asia. This year the
summer conference will be in China.
ASES summit director Janice
Pai, a coterminal student, said that
despite some problems bringing
students in from abroad to the
summit arising from the Post-Sept.
11 political climate, the summit
nonetheless has a strong showing

from overseas.
"We have 45 delegates from abroad;
the most we've ever had," she said.
Summit organizers said that they
had put together a diverse crowd of
leaders in global entrepreneurship
to speak at the conference.
"We've been well received be
cause many of the speakers see this
as an opportunity to reach out to a
new generation of future entrepre
neurs," Szu said.
The international delegates
shared Szu's enthusiasm for this
dual opportunity to hear from lead
ers in business and to network
among their peers.
A first-time summit participant
from Hong Kong, Zheng "Eko" Yin
said she was already excited to be
here upon on campus and enjoyed
meeting her peers.
A returning student delegate
from Japan, Toipoyuki Omura said
the main reasons for his participa
tion this year were the positive ex
periences he had from talking with
one of the business executives last
year. He added that he valued the
opportunity "to contemplate over
fresh economic possibilities with my
friends here."
