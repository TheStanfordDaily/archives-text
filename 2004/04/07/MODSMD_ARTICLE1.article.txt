# ASSU candidates debate the issues

### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ASSU presidential candidates vied for student votes during last
night's debate at the CoHo.
The three slates — including junior Ajani Husbands and sopho
more Alyssa Schwartz, senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan Mefford
and senior Charlie Stockman and junior Matthew Henick — an
swered a series of predetermined questions on topics ranging from
cost of living concerns to representing graduate students.
While Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford both presented
similar platforms based on dialogue and accountability, key differ
ences emerged.
Husbands and Schwartz appeared more interested in being advo
cates for student-diversity issues, whereas Lee and Mefford ex
pressed greater interest in working with the administration.
Husbands and Schwartz said that their priorities included restruc
turing the ASSU, increasing visibility and greater accountability. Lee
and Mefford cited a variety of ideas including an ASSU report card,
attending a minority conference and improving the ASSU Web site.
The Stockman-Henick slate guaranteed to capture and convict the
"Serial Groper."
"This is the most important event because the candidates are able
to address the issues at length," said Assistant Elections Commis
sioner Alida Garcia, a junior. "KZSU broadcasts the event so every
one can listen to it even if they're not here."
Many students came to the debate to support a particular candi
date. The Chappie slate came to entertain — even sporting head-wraps
and band outfits. Some did not appreciate The Chappie's answers.
"I was disappointed to find out that staff members of the Chappie
are as annoying in person as they are in their publication," said John
Cadena, a freshman.
Audience members submitted questions for candidates on the ad
ministration's controversial Alcohol Policy, slate formation and per
sonal convictions.
"The candidates responses to the audience initiated questions
were the most revealing portion of the debates," said freshman
Chavanne Lamb. "The pre-submitted questions merely gave the
candidates another chance to spit out their pre-constructed politi
cal rhetoric."
Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin, a junior, said she hoped the
event gave attendees a broader
picture of candidates. However,
some students questioned the de
bate's usefulness.
"If the questions weren't
scripted, I think we would have
had a far better picture of how
the candidates really feel, and we
have seen more clash," said
sophomore John Schiavone.
This is just one of a series of
events presented by the elections
commission to introduce students
to the candidates and encourage
the student body to vote.
"I would recommend students
to look at Web sites [for
specifics], but I think [the de
bate] is good for people who
wanted to see who the candi
dates were in person," said Kai
Stinchcombe, a first-year gradu
ate student.
