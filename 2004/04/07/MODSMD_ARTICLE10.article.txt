# Class Shopper
## Oh, to be a Simp 
### BONITA SONG STAFF COLUMNIST 
To begin, I showed up to the class late and gasping
because I had been thrashing all through Memorial
Auditorium trying to find the classroom. The thing is,
the time schedule says it meets in "MemAud 204." But
in fact the entire Drama Department building is con
sidered part of "Mem Aud," even though it's behind the
auditorium and not, as far as I could tell, in any way
connected to it. So if you want to take Improv, don't
end up a silly, gasping fool like me: Enter the Drama
Department from the side facing the Graduate School
of Business, go up the stairs, and you'll find the class
room just ahead and off to the left.
Drama 103, otherwise known as Improvising, meets
every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and is offered
at two different times this quarter — 10 a.m. and 1:15
p.m. The class is usually offered every winter and
spring. If you're dying to take the class but didn't make
the first required session last week, or if you're double
majoring in earth systems and petroleum engineering
and can't seem to fit it into your schedule, there's hope
for next year.
After I finally arrived and blurted out something
about a Daily column, I settled into the little room. Ev
eryone, including the instructor —15 or 20 people in all
— was seated story-time style, in a relaxed circle on the
floor or on tables and chairs along the wall. That partic
ular day, for whatever reason, one guy and every female
except myself and the instructor was perched squarely
on a piece of furniture rather than the floor, their legs
daintily crossed. (It couldn't have been intentional, but
that's why I thought it was interesting. But I digress.)
The topic for that day was story-telling. The lecturer,
Ms. Ryan, explained to us how even spontaneous sto
ries tend to exhibit a certain form, and that this is how
we recognize stories as stories — rather than just as a
history or collection of related statements. Making up
good stories, she said, therefore depends on following
certain strategies and planning. For example, many sto
ries begin by setting up a background situation or norm
("Once upon a time ... "), and then develop by intro
ducing some kind of interruption into the scene ("And
then one day ... "). A good background layout usually
incorporates details, although these details may be in
troduced by the storyteller without a specific purpose.
Later, the storyteller can refer to these details to draw
the story along a path and into a plotline.
So went the instruction component. But, Improv is
an activity class, so most of the time was spend making
up stories with nuggets of instruction and lecture stuck
in between. For instance, as a group we made up a story
by going around in a circle, each person adding one
word to the string before it. In the end, our story was
about a dog named Harry, I think, who boarded a bus
full of other dogs who were all lost and crying.
We also made up stories in partners: One person
would name three things, and the other person would
have to mention and incorporate them into a story.
Then partners would switch responsibilities. In my case,
my partner took it easy on me: I ended up telling a story
about the color red, a notebook and roses. I, on the
other hand, challenged my partner for whatever ran
dom reason to make up a story about emphysema, a
pocketknife and a water pipe. (He did quite well.)
Overall, I had an awesome time. Sure, I was expect
ing it to be fun, but I didn't realize how much I would
end up learning. I ended up staying later than I should
have, and once again arrived late and gasping to my next
class (this was one I was actually enrolled in), but it was
still worth it. I'd say it was a happy ending. Final verdict:
I highly recommend Improv.
People who arrived late: Just me, as far as I know
People asleep or looking bored by the middle: No one
How much I wished I were enrolled in the class, on a
scale of 1-10 (10 being the best): 10
