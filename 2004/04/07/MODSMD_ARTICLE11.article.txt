# Ice skating in the Golden State
## Stanford ice skaters bring a cold-weather sport to California 
### CAROLINE CICCONE DESK EDITOR 
At the 2004 Intercollegiate Team
Nationals held in Amherst, Mass.,
on March 27, the Stanford Figure
Skating team won sixth place. This
was quite an achievement fora team
that has been in existence for only
four years and has grown to
ten skaters.
"While the Pacific Coast teams are
only one-third of the size of most East
Coast teams, we seek to up our tech
nical skill to compensate. This in ad
dition to increased recruitment to the
level of East Coast teams will ensure
that we will continue to move up the

ranks at Intercollegiate Team Nation
als," said freshman Christine Wu in a
press release.
Unlike their East Coast counter
parts, the self-run Stanford team mem
bers coach each other, choreograph
their routines and drive to Belmont to
practice. Other schools, however, bene
fit from rincs on campus.
Mostly an individual sport, the
Stanford Figure Skating Team tries
to create a team atmosphere that
makes the experience more fun for
team members.
"Being on the team has opened up
many new doors for me. I have become
friends with many upperclassmen, met
a tight-knit group of interesting people

and really gotten involved at Stan
ford," said freshman Elena Greigo in a
press release.
Senior co-captain Jenny Chen said
she pushes for team-building.
"Being a part of a team is really
great because you have others sup
porting you. We're all working to
wards one goal. It's been really ful
filling, because I'm able to share
my passion with other people as op
posed to training individually. We
do a ton of others things as a team,
we're going to do an exhibition in
May, to get the Stanford communi
ty excited about skating too,"
Chen said.
The Figure Skating Team brings

the sport to regular students as well.
They have performed and skated at
numerous dorms' Screw Your
Roommates on ice that took place
this winter. This quarter, the team
plans to reach out to the Stanford
community and give them an oppor
tunity to skate.
"Every other Friday, we rent out
the ice just for Stanford students.
We bring the competitive and recre
ational skaters together and we
teach the recreational skaters how to
skate. It's a good bonding experi
ence because it's only Stanford stu
dents on the ice. We're really into
getting people interested in the
sport," Chen said.
