# Eat, drink and be merry
## Matzo ball soup for the soul 
### JENNIE BRODER FOOD COLUMNIST 
The sun is out. the birds are chirping and suddenly all
the M&M's have turned pastel. Since we all know the
chocolate and candy industry is intrinsically tied to an
nual holidays, it doesn't take long to realize that Easter
is only a week away. We see the Cadbury Eggs come out
in force (I was always a fan of the caramel ones over the
creme ones). Dove chocolates are making Truffle Eggs
and the Mounds Bar package is now pink with polka
dots with pictures of tulips.
It got me thinking, though. In my life I have seen the
entire candy industry change its packaging, shapes and
flavors during this time period around Easter, but I have
yet to see a single chocolate-shaped matzo ball.
What's a matzo ball? you might ask. I have heard this
question asked more times than 1 thought was possible
during my time at Stanford. I didn't realize that most of
the country has never heard what matzo ball soup was.
And with the lack of delicatessens around Palo Alto, I
guess I can see why. So as food connoisseur extraordi
naire. I feel that it is my culinary duty to inform you of
this Passover-centered (yet available year-round) treat

in all its glory.
Yes, it's Passover. Who knew that another holiday
lay tucked in the week right before Easter Sunday? But
Passover exists, although unfortunately the candy in
dustry has failed to take notice. 1 guess because it's not a
very thrilling holiday — it's more about the memory of

j - J
our enslaved ancestors in Egypt and
celebrating our freedom from bondage
with loved ones.
But I won't bore you with the details
I learned in 10 years in Hebrew school.
I'll bore you only with the food details.
Here goes: Because we can't eat leav
ened bread for the eight days of
Passover, matzo kind of takes over our
lives. And it's so versatile too — make
chocolate-covered matzo and freeze it
fora delish midnight snack, or melt
cheese and tomato sauce on it and.

voila, matzo pizza. But my absolute favorite concoction
of matzo is when it is mushed into that'palm-sized ball of
goodness (yes. mushed is a technical term).
Probably the only restaurant in Palo Alto where you
can try matzo ball soup (this is usually the only dish in

which you will see the matzo ball appear) is at Max's
Opera Cafe, located in the Stanford Shopping Center.
I'm sure many of you have been there to try their focca
cia sandwiches or grilled salmon salads, but not their
true deli fare. While they don't make the best matzo ball
soup I have had in my life, it's only because that's be-

cause my grandma isn't cooking behind
the counter.
Last year I remember going to Max's
with a group of friends, sitting on those
massive shiny-red booths, practically
force-feeding this soup into initially du
bious mouths and watching the smiles
appear. My friends had no clue what
matzo ball soup was and were too
scared to try it. And for all of you out
there that feel the same way, let me ease
your fears. To make matzo balls, folks,
all you have to do is squish a bread ball

in the palm of your hand. Instead of bread, the matzo
ball is squished matzo meal (the "dough" of matzo).
Matzo ball soup is one of my favorite soups in the
world. The broth is warm, soothing and smells like it was
cooked with love. The best feeling is slicing into that

matzo ball and feeling the spoon pass through the thick
ball and hit all the tiny air pockets (a good matzo ball is
light and airy, because when it is rolled it's not packed so
tightly that it is completely dense all the way through).
Make sure each spoonful has a bit of the matzo ball
steeped in broth, and some carrots or celery bits. And
when you're feeling down or just downright cold, this
soup of wonders will warm your soul.
Please, take my word on this one and just try the matzo
ball soup next time you are at Max's. Maybe if enough
people do, Hershey's and Stouffer's will take notice.

If you know of a tried-and-true deli around here, let
Jennie know at jbroder@stanford.edu. Or if you're
grandma's in town and she just happens to make a
hatch of matzo hall soup, feel free to set some aside for
her. If you really haven no clue what she was just talk
ing about and want to know a little more about
Passover, she is down to answer any questions.
