## Vote in ASSU elections 
### 
ASSU elections began at midnight today and
will continue through tomorrow. We
strongly urge Stanford students to vote at
some point in the next two days. Voting is
done online from the comfort of students' dorm rooms
and takes no more than five minutes, so students have
no excuse not to participate. Particularly this year, with
the potential fora special-fees crisis, students have a
vested interest in voting and showing that they care
about the future of the system.
Ultimately, however, students should vote in this
year's elections because they care about student lead
ership and the direction the University will take next

year. The ASSU is behind numerous initiatives life
that most students find useful: the online course and
draw guides, the Stanford Concert Network, Student
Initiated Courses. Speaker's Bureau, Absolute Fun
and legal counseling.
Additionally, the ASSU plays an important role
in student life as an advocate for cost-of-living and
student-space issues, as well as diversity, community
centers and many other salient topics. The ASSU
wields significant power over student life, and it is up
to students to vote to ensure that this influence is
used wisely.
