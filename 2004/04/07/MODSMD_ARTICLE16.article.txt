# OP-ED
## Voters must take responsibility 
### KYLE ALISHARAN 
As an active member of the cam
pus community for many years and as
someone who has detailed knowledge
of the special fees situation, I would
like to make a personal appeal for all
students to make their voices heard
during this election. The current spe
cial-fee system gives students direct
control over which groups get funded
using two mechanisms: the spring elec
tion and quarterly refunds.
Our special-fee system has prob
lems. The system was designed by
those who wrote the original constitu
tion thirty-five years ago, and since
then scores of students have added
amendments and bylaws to make the
constitution more representative of
student concerns.
Last spring, 62 percent of under
graduates voted. An average of 28 per
cent voted for special fees and 15 per
cent voted against special fees. Why
don't the "yes" and "no" votes total the
number of students voting? Because
19 percent of undergraduate students
skipped the special fee section on the
ballot. This is concerning, considering
that 28 percent of undergraduates
asked fora refund winter quarter, and
based on current projections 35 per
cent will ask fora refund this quarter.
Who are the 35 percent requesting
refunds? They either voted "yes,"
"no," or not at all in the spring election.
If we assume everyone who voted "no"
got a refund, we are left with 20 percent
that either voted for special fees in the
spring and changed their mind, or
didn't vote and now want a refund.

Did the majority of students vote
on special fees? No, only 43 percent
voted. Were people consistent in their
voting and refund requests? No, 20
percent requested refunds without
voting "no" in the elections.
These individuals are not taking re
sponsibility for their actions. So where
does this leave us? Either we all try to
be more consistent, vote for what we
believe in and follow it through with
action, or we change the system to one
that is not dependent on voter turnout,
voter consistency and voter ethics.
I would be happy to discuss a third
option if anyone has one. Unfortu
nately, this year's refunds are already
completely inconsistent with last
spring's vote, and every additional
spring refund is another reason to
change the system. If you value the
faith placed in you by your predeces
sors and appreciate the responsibility
of having direct control over student
group funding, only request a refund
for groups that you voted "no" on last
spring. Please take responsibility for
your (in)actions.
Looking at next year, we must ad
dress the voter consistency problem.
How we do this ultimately comes
down to how we behave as individuals.
Please notice that I have not men
tioned forgoing refunds. As Brendon
Fox said in a letter in yesterday's Daily
("Students should reconsider voting
for special-fees groups") if you don't
want to give money to the "New Kids
on the Block Fan Club," simply vote
them down in the spring election.
If they pass, by all means, get your re
fund, but don't skip voting and ask fora

refund next year. Similar to the honor
code, our system trusts students to hold
themselves accountable. This year. 20
percent of the undergraduate popula
tion did not fulfill this responsibility.
Student governance can only effect
real change if the community makes its
voice heard and requires all members
to act responsibly.
First, the majority needs to vote in
order to ensure the special-fee mea
sures passed are in line with popular
sentiment. If the measures were not in
line with popular sentiment, refunds
could be unpredictable leading to a
lack of funding.
Second, individuals need to be con
sistent between their votes and their
refund requests. For example, if a
number of people voted "yes" on all
special fee measures and then request
ed a complete refund, student groups
would be forced to give back money
originally budgeted by the voters,
leading to a lack of funding.
Finally, individuals must take re
sponsibility for their actions. The sys
tem is ripe for abuse by those who wish
to be seen as supporting something
without actually paying for it. For ex
ample an individual could vote "yes"
on an initiative, such as KZSU, and
then request a refund despite listening
throughout the quarter.
Please, make your voice heard this
week. Vote on special fees.
