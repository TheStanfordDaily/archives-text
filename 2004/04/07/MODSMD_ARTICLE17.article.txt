# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## Addicted to (being on) TV 
### 
During Dead Week last
quarter, I wrote a column
about the wonder that is
Spring Break ("An ode to
Spring Break — or how to get laid
without really trying," March 10). For
those of you who didn't read it, it was
basically a tribute to the virtues of
boozing on the beach and watching
wet t-shirt contests.
Little did 1 know what I was in for.
Within a couple of days, that seeming
ly vapid ode to a week of debauchery
put my writing on the home page of
one of the biggest Spring Break web
sites and eventually landed me on na
tional television.
Let me explain.
About 24 hours after the paper
came out, I received an e-mail from
some random guy who identified him
self as a representative fora Web site
called springbreak.com and said that
he was putting a link to my column on
the main page of his site.
This was certainly not the first time
I had received a random e-mail after
writing a column. But this was differ
ent. The Web site was a popular page,
which, among other things, marketed
spring break trips fora variety of well
known travel agencies. This meant
that my column received a ton of hits.
Next thing I know, I'm getting tons
of e-mails from random people across
the country. Fan mail from kids at
University of Cincinnati. Hate mail
from some doctor in Oklahoma: "1
hope you only have daughters, if
there's a woman stupid enough to be
'laid' by you."
Needless to say, 1 was a little bit sur
prised at all of the attention. I go on
obnoxious rants approximately every
II minutes, and the vast majority sim
ply evaporate into thin air.
Already confused by all of this, my
astonishment was soon elevated to a
whole new level. Five days after The
Daily came out, I received an e-mail
from a senior booking producer at
MSNBC. The producer explained

that some people at MSNBC had read
my column and loved it. They wanted
to know if 1 would be available to be
interviewed live on-air on MSNBC

later in the week.
Like Lil' Jon
would so elo
quently proclaim,
I conveyed a one
word response:
"YEAH."
To make a
long story short,
just two days later
I ended up doing a
five-minute inter-

view with Contessa Brewer on
MSNBC. 1 sat in the CNBC studios
on Page Mill Road with an earpiece
in my ear, and waxed poetic via satel
lite about moronic college kids ruin
ing their livers and contracting dis
eases in such beautiful locales as
Panama City. Fla.
It was surreal. As one of my friends
asked, what expertise did I bring to
this venerable 24-hour news source?
My answer was, who cares? I was
going to be on TV, and you can't be
lieve how impressed my girlfriend's
mother was.
My interview initially got bumped
because of breaking news about
Ayman al-Zawahri. Apparently, news
of coalition forces cornering an upper
level al-Oaeda operative is more im
portant than my opinions about triple
kisses in Cancun. I've thought long
and hard about this, and I'm not exact
ly sure whether it was their intention,
but al-Oaeda threw some serious salt
in my game that day.
Nevertheless, my interview was
eventually aired, and I was happy with
my performance. I went on national
television and held my own against a
crazy reporter who —unlike in my
pre-interview — seemed to be deter
mined to have me crack and take the
blame for every crime ever committed
on Spring Break by anyone under the
age of 25.

1 swear it's not going to my head,
but I'd just like to add that I dropped
some serious gems.
With my tongue so firmly en
sconced in my cheek that it hurt, 1
managed to say with a straight face
that Spring Breakers were on a "pil
grimage to party." And somewhere 50
Cent got misty-eyed with pride when 1
became the first white guy to ever
utter the words "party like it's your
birthday" on a 24-hour news channel.
However, the following (equally
sarcastic) exchange was my personal
favorite. Brewer: "Why don't college
kids go to museums to look at ancient
relics when they're on Spring Break?"
Levine: "Well, if ancient relics looked
anything like wet t-shirt contests,
maybe they would, but last time I
checked, that's not the case."
Brewer didn't know what hit her.
She had met her match.
In those five short minutes, I
caught the television bug. From what I
hear, it's more contagious than SARS.
So, I've got a message for all of you
reading this. 1 am ready to go on TV
and talk about anything you want. It
doesn't matter whether the subject is
the monetary policy of inflation-tar
geting central banks or the cultural sig
nificance of Menudo.
Whatever you want me to endorse,
I'm game. Ad agencies, take notice.
I'll gladly pop two pills of Viagra and
passionately promote the benefits of a
four-hour erection.
Whatever it takes to get my face
beamed on television sets across the
country. I will even sit across from Bill
O'Reilly and be his whipping boy
eight days a week if he so desires.
As the esteemed 20th-century
philosopher Steve Stifler once said, it's
on like Donkey Kong.
