## Outgoing ASSU execs weigh in 
### NADIYA FIGUEROA JOEY NATOLI 
For the past 367 days, we have been
working our hardest to improve all as
pects of student life. As we now look
forward to leaving office, we want to
offer our two cents as to whom we
would choose as our successors.
First, yesterday's Daily endorse
ment of Lee-Mefford made the state
ment, "choose action over advocacy."
We prefer the statement, "choose pos
itive action and long-term advocacy,"
as it better embodies how the executive
can best serve students. As always, nei
ther of the executive slates is ideal, but
we believe one offers more promise
than the other.
Lee and Mefford have certainly put
a lot of work into their campaign. Lee
and Mefford deserve credit for the
most politically savvy campaign, but
we question some of their means. They
have made promises they cannot fulfill
and have neglected current duties
while running their campaign. Further
more, receiving The Daily endorse
ment is suspect, as it came from an edi
torial board that includes Lees co
workers and campaign manager.
In regards to their platform, com
munication seems to take top priority.
As current ASSU executives, we be
lieve it is not much of an action item to
send unsolicited e-mails to all Stanford
students. We appreciate good commu
nications, but students do not want to
know every detail of the ASSU. It is
more important to lower cost of living,
strengthen advising or support diversi
ty than to cheer small victories.

Despite significant research prior to
campaigning, the proposed action items
lack depth and true understanding.
For instance: Cost of living — SSE
does not want to adopt the book pro
gram. It is a non-profit service for stu
dents, not a business. Diversity —
there is a reason why they did not re
ceive endorsement from the communi
ties of color, as these communities
need more than promises of funds to
address long-term issues of representa
tion. support and advocacy. Student
space — they want to carve up the
brand-new Tresidder eating facility to
provide smaller meeting rooms, which
are already available in the recently
renovated Nitery. Specialized perfor
mance. rehearsal and large meeting
space are far more needed.
Overall, the slate and their promis
es are too one-dimensional. We have
two men. who do not have much per
sonal experience or great insight into
diversity, arts and graduate life, or the
ability to empower these communities.
Husbands-Schwartz have not been
as smart with their politicking. And
whereas The Daily has found them
weak in action items, they have consis
tently proposed a plan of involving stu
dents and groups to create their own
programs to best service their needs.
Moreover, while Husbands-
Schwartz have fewer action items, their
items are more positive and plausible,
such as: increasing visual arts display
space, improving athletic event afford
ability and making international New
Student Orientation affordable for the
international community. In compar
ing these ideas with Lee-Mefford, the

experience and expertise of each slate
shines through.
While on paper these slates have
similar experiences, in fact, their dedi
cation and exhibited leadership are far
different. Lee, as a Junior and Senior
Class president, gained much worth
while experience in planning programs
and maintaining contact with his class.
The ASSU executive is less about pro
gramming and visibility, and more
about accomplishing gains for stu
dents. Mefford has exhibited poor par
ticipation in the Senate this year. For
example, he failed to attend any spe
cial-fee meetings with student groups.
On the other hand, Schwartz has
been an extremely hardworking sena
tor, attending ASSU events, planning
student leadership dinners and work
ing closely with communities through
out campus. Husbands has been an in
tegral member of the arts community,
publications community and black
community. We feel that Husbands
and Schwartz will well complement
one another and provide a balanced,
multi-dimensional team.
No ASSU executive team is ideal,
as we have personally experienced.
However, we implore voters to make
an educated decision and carefully
choose which slate would do the best
job based on past experiences, exhibit
ed leadership skills and articulated vi
sion for the student body.

more, receiving The Daily endorse
ment is suspect, as it came from an edi
torial board that includes Lees co
workers and campaign manager.
In regards to their platform, com
munication seems to take top priority.
As current ASSU executives, we be
lieve it is not much of an action item to
send unsolicited e-mails to all Stanford
students. We appreciate good commu
nications, but students do not want to
know every detail of the ASSU. It is
more important to lower cost of living,
strengthen advising or support diversi
ty than to cheer small victories.

Despite significant research prior to
campaigning, the proposed action items
lack depth and true understanding.
For instance: Cost of living — SSE
does not want to adopt the book pro
gram. It is a non-profit service for stu
dents, not a business. Diversity —
there is a reason why they did not re
ceive endorsement from the communi
ties of color, as these communities
need more than promises of funds to
address long-term issues of representa
tion. support and advocacy. Student
space — they want to carve up the
brand-new Tresidder eating facility to
provide smaller meeting rooms, which
are already available in the recently
renovated Nitery. Specialized perfor
mance. rehearsal and large meeting
space are far more needed.
Overall, the slate and their promis
es are too one-dimensional. We have
two men. who do not have much per
sonal experience or great insight into
diversity, arts and graduate life, or the
ability to empower these communities.
Husbands-Schwartz have not been
as smart with their politicking. And
whereas The Daily has found them
weak in action items, they have consis
tently proposed a plan of involving stu
dents and groups to create their own
programs to best service their needs.
Moreover, while Husbands-
Schwartz have fewer action items, their
items are more positive and plausible,
such as: increasing visual arts display
space, improving athletic event afford
ability and making international New
Student Orientation affordable for the
international community. In compar
ing these ideas with Lee-Mefford, the

experience and expertise of each slate
shines through.
While on paper these slates have
similar experiences, in fact, their dedi
cation and exhibited leadership are far
different. Lee, as a Junior and Senior
Class president, gained much worth
while experience in planning programs
and maintaining contact with his class.
The ASSU executive is less about pro
gramming and visibility, and more
about accomplishing gains for stu
dents. Mefford has exhibited poor par
ticipation in the Senate this year. For
example, he failed to attend any spe
cial-fee meetings with student groups.
On the other hand, Schwartz has
been an extremely hardworking sena
tor, attending ASSU events, planning
student leadership dinners and work
ing closely with communities through
out campus. Husbands has been an in
tegral member of the arts community,
publications community and black
community. We feel that Husbands
and Schwartz will well complement
one another and provide a balanced,
multi-dimensional team.
No ASSU executive team is ideal,
as we have personally experienced.
However, we implore voters to make
an educated decision and carefully
choose which slate would do the best
job based on past experiences, exhibit
ed leadership skills and articulated vi
sion for the student body.
