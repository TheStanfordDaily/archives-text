# LETTER TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
Candidate responds to
Daily's endorsement
I would first like to thank The
Daily's editorial board for their kind
words about me in Tuesday's editorial
("ASSU executive election: Choose
action over advocacy." April 6). How
ever, given their assertion that "either
of the two front-running slates would
probably do an adequate job if elect
ed," I can't help but wonder if the edi
torial board needed to endorse any
slate for this week's ASSU election.
I am concerned by The Daily's de
cision to endorse a slate considering

the conflict of interest inherently em
bedded in the editorial staff this vol
ume. Mikey Lee is a writer for the
Opinions section of The Daily and a
former editor. It is safe to assume, 1
think, that he is thus friendly with the
Opinions editors, two of whom sit on
the editorial board.
Furthermore, I was surprised to
find the campaign manager for Lee-
Mefford on the editorial board as well.
While The Daily has every right to en
dorse a slate, and I do not question the
ability of the editorial board to remove
their personal biases from the endorse
ment decision, there is a demonstrable

conflict of interest for the board's
members. I am not questioning the en
dorsement of Lee-Mefford, but rather
the integrity of the Daily in its decision
to do so.
