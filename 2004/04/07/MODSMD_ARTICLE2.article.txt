# CS enrollment plunges in bad economy

### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Amid concerns over the outsourcing of tech
nical jobs and the end of the dot-com boom, the
number of Stanford students majoring in com
puter science has significantly declined over
the past two years, mirroring a national trend.
The number of students declaring computer
science or computer systems engineering as
their major decreased eight percent between
the 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 academic years
and by 20 percent between the 2001-2002 and
2002-2003 years, according to Claire Stager, a
student services officer in the Computer Sci
ence Department.
Universities and colleges nationwide have
experienced similar drops, according to a
new study by the Computing Research Asso
ciation. The last year saw a sudden 23 per
cent drop in newly declared computer sci
ence majors.
The most significant reason for this decline,
according to Maggie Johnson, a senior lecturer
in the department, is the shrinking number of
jobs in the industry, due in part to the end of the
dot-com boom.
"Many students [prior to the dot-com bub
ble bursting] were majoring in computer sci
ence to take advantage of financial opportuni
ties," she said. "Such opportunities still exist,
but are not as available as they were four or five
years ago."
Also of concern to potential majors, she
added, was the threat of offshore outsourcing,
a business trend that has gained the media's at
tention in recent months.
"With a substantial percentage of program
ming positions going offshore, students are
recognizing that the field is in a transition,"
Johnson said.
Chetan Puttagunta, a freshman who is con
sidering majoring in computer science, voiced
concerns about the shipping of programming
jobs overseas.
"At the rate outsourcing is going at, you
wonder how many computer science jobs will
be left in America," Puttagunta said.

Despite the sharp drop in computer science
majors. Prof. David Dill does not see the prob
lem as long-term.
"I think there is a good chance that this will
all blow over, and it will be seen in retrospect to
be a short-term problem for careers in technol
ogy," he said.
"It may well be that once we recover from
the collapse of the dot-com bubble there will be
plenty of jobs. I also believe that off-shoring is
a bit of a fad, and once companies find out that
it doesn't work well in some cases, those jobs
will come back to the U.S."
Johnson argued that many types of com
puter science jobs are not currently at risk to
be outsourced.
"Programming positions may be going over
seas for economic reasons, but design, product

management and cutting-edge technology is
still here, and will remain here for the near fu
ture," she said.
She also contended that the current dip in
the number of computer science majors may be
turning around.
"Even though the enrollments declined last
year, we have some indication of possible in
creases this year in some of our courses," John
son said.
Regardless of the future of the computer sci
ence industry. Dill had some parting advice for
students worried about the marketability of
their majors.
"Overall, I would advise students to do what
they love to do," he said. "Maybe you won't
make a fortune, but the resulting satisfaction
will be worth a fortune."
