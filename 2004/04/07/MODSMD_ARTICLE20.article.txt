## Solve special fees by publicizing refund requests and denying services 
### JOSH SHIPP 
Stanford has the largest number of student
organizations of any school in the nation, with
more than 600. It is these groups of talented
and motivated students that make Stanford
such a vital, diverse and enjoyable place to live
and study.
About 10 percent of these groups are fund
ed through special fees, which constitutes the

majority of the ASSU fee found on your Uni
versity Bill each quarter. This fee is optional in
that it is refundable in full each quarter.
Refunds are guaranteed by the ASSU Con
stitution, which specifies that any student shall
be able to receive a refund of all or part of their
ASSU fee. The logic behind this is that students
should not have to pay fora group they person
ally do not wish to fund.
Interestingly, Stanford's quarterly student

fee is both the third-lowest per term with regard
to peer institutions, and one of only two that are
refundable (Harvard University is the other, but
it is currently entertaining proposals to make the
fee mandatory). It is crucial to have refunds as
part of future student fees at Stanford.
Almost 30 percent of undergraduates re
quested refunds from the vast majority of groups
during winter quarter. Do one-third of students
really feel that these student groups don't serve

them in any way? Why are we becoming less will
ing to fund student organizations?
Students are more willing to fund student ac
tivities than the numbers indicate. They simply
don't see the problem if they personally choose
not to. With the fee approaching $100 a quarter,
the refund seems like a sizable amount of "free
money," especially when parents or financial
aid foot the bill initially. Coupled with the lack
of financial impact refunds have had upon

groups in the past, many students see no reason
not to get a refund.
It has become increasingly common for
group members and leaders to request refunds
from their own groups. That is just plain dis
honest. This goes for programming, communi
ty service and publications groups as well, which
are lumped under the three major Undergrad
uate General Fees.
Even more prevalent are refund requests by

students who attend events and partici
pate in programs put on by these
groups. This includes virtually all stu
dents at one point or another, meaning
that a vast majority of students should
not be obtaining refunds at the level
they are. It is simple: If these groups are
valuable to you as a Stanford student on
any level, don't get a refund.
There are a few ways to counter these
problems. First, the refund lists for all
groups should be publicly available to
all students. Getting a refund from a
group is not a stigma; it is something
one should be willing to disclose. Not fi
nancially supporting a group because
of an ideological stance is a noble posi
tion. It is those who believe refunds are
private and somehow embarrassing
who are perpetuating the free-rider
problems of the system.
Second, student groups, given the
new direct financial impact of refunds,
should use their refunder list to deny
services to those who obtain a refund of
their fee. This will cause students to
think twice when getting a refund.
Until the self-interested actions of
some students are met with conse
quences, the refund problem will only
escalate to the point of serious deterio
ration of student life.
As you vote in this election, you
should consider which groups you
might obtain a refund from come fall
quarter. Vote "no" on those groups, as a
"yes" vote indicates a good-faith
promise to fund those groups. Your
vote is an allocation of funds to groups
that truly serve the broader campus
community. It is up to you to determine
what your money will be going towards
next year. Be educated and be content
with your decision.
