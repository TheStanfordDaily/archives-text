# Special-fees groups should have broad impact on campus
## 
### 
This year. The Stanford Daily decided not to
offer endorsements for special-fees groups as it
has in the past. But we do hope that voters will
carefully consider their options before deter
mining which special-fees groups to support.
ASSU officials claim, based on historical figures, that
there is a positive correlation between between the overall
refund rate and the total amount of money granted to spe
cial-fees groups. Based on this, some have made the argu
ment that when the quarterly fee grows larger, students are
driven to request more refunds. If this is the case, this is one
reason why it is important to Ux)k over the groups on the
ballot with a particularly critical eye.
Now that the ASSU has instituted the policy that re
funds have "real" consequences for groups — if a group
has refunds in excess of a certain percentage, it is respon
sible for making up the difference — by voting for groups
one does not particularly care for. one is risking that

groups one truly does care about will experience higher re
fund rates. This is, of course, provided that there is indeed
a causal relationship between the total amount of special
fees money requested and the refund rate.
I n terms of criteria for determining which groups to sup
port, special-fees recipients should serve the University
community. Groups, especially those with a concentrated
or core set of members, that do not benefit the greater com
munity have plenty of other options for funding, such as
Stanford Fund event shifts and letter writing. Special fees
should be just that — special. Each voter should sit down
and carefully consider which groups have meaningfully im
proved the campus community. And remember, if one
isn't sure about a specific group, one always has the option
of abstaining rather than voting "yes." If everyone adopts
this approach, the special-fees system will not balloon out
of proportion, and groups truly worthy of special fees will
be able to enjoy their funding in full via lower refund rates.
