# Special report: Behind the special-fees system, part 1
## 
### ERIC ELDON GOHAR GALYAN 
Editor's note: As the campus elections approach, the following two
part series is an effort to clearly explain the special-fees system to the
student body. The jirst article below focuses on the phenomenon of
the skyrocketing refund rate, and the ASSU's response. The second
article will examine the development of the special-fees system over
the years, and the role that special-fees funding plays in supporting
student groups.
During last spring s ASSU elections, the special-fees sys
tem continued the trend from the previous year of growing in size,
with both the number ol groups approved to receive special fees
and the costs to students skyrocketing. This year, however, the sys
tem has been threatened with insolvency as record numbers of stu
dents refunded their money allocated to special-fees groups. As re
tund rates continued to increase during this past winter quarter, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council al
tered both the constitutional by-laws governing the system and the
manner in which they enforced those by-laws to try to ensure the fu
ture of the system.

The impending implo
sion may have been averted by
the Senate's action to try to re
strict the number of special-fees
groups on the ballot and to regu
late how much money those
groups ask of students. However,
many groups seeking fees that
were rejected outright or had
their budgets slashed by the Sen
ate have successfully petitioned
the student body — as per their
ASSU constitutional right —to
be returned to the ballot. Ulti
mately, after the ASSU and the
student body votes on which spe
cial-fees groups to approve each
year, the system will be sustained
or broken based on how much
money is taken back by students
through refunds.
The special-fees contro
versy that has unfolded since last
spring's elections has been a
practical lesson for many stu
dents in a topic taught in classes
in the economics and political
science departments — the "pub
lic goods problem," where any in
dividual can take advantage of a
certain good without paying his
or her share, but if too many peo
ple do so then not enough of the
good will be produced.
Political Science Prof.
James Fearon, who has taught
and published extensively on the
oretical aspects of human behav
ior in political systems, said that
as it has been organized, the spe
cial-fees system has incorporated
"free riders."
"All might be better off
if forced — by a collectively
voted policy — to contribute X
dollars to fund student activi
ties," he said "But if you have the
option of not contributing —
here, demanding a refund —
then you can 'free ride' on the
contributions of others. But then
if too many people do this, there
will be no or very few student ac
tivities and everyone will be
worse off than if you had a policy
of 'no refunds.' "
Fearon added that the
special-fees system is complicat
ed by the fact that students have
different preferences for which
groups should be funded, and for
how much. Thus, he said that
"students with low demand for
these activities are subsidizing
those with higher demands, and
students who object to funding
activity A are providing funds for
activity A — the same is true, of
course, with tax payments to the
U.S. government."
Since 2000, the annual
amount of special-fees funding
has increased by nearly $1 mil
lion, from $1,486,538.24 to
$2,407,668.05 — which comes to
an increase of $99 per year in the
special fee paid by each under
graduate. During that same time
period, the total refund rate has
nearly tripled, from 7.52 percent
to 22 percent.
Last winter, as the re
fund spike continued and the ad
hoc special-fees committee

made up of members from the Undergraduate Senate and GSC ex
amined how to stabilize the system, they isolated three factors that
had combined to cause the problem, said ASSU Financial Manager
Kyle Alisharan.
The first factor they found was a large increase in the number
of groups receiving special-fees funding; this caused an increase in the
size of the total undergraduate fee. The second factor was that there
was a "lack of feedback between groups and students — meaning stu
dents were not feeling the impact of groups and groups were not feel
ing the impact of special-fee refunds." The third factor was a change
in voter philosophy.
"From talking to alumni and current students it seems as
though current students ask for refunds based on their participation
in a given group [that they belong toj," Alisharan said. "According to
alumni, students used to ask for refunds as a way to voice ideological
opposition [to a group], and were willing to fund groups they did not
participate in order to support student life.
He also said that the ASSU has anecdotal evidence of a few
groups last year asking students to approve their special-fees mea
sures, while telling the same students that they should get their refund
back from the same group after that group s approval.
Junior Josh Shipp, the senate chair and a member of the spe
cial-fees committee, said that the committee found that the main
problem with the refund system has been that students are choosing
request refunds from groups that they still benefit from.
"[S]tudents aren't living up to their end of the special fees

bargain," he said. "With the fee approaching a 'round' $100, stu
dents are much more likely to refund the majority of groups, de
spite continuing to benefit from those groups' services. The higher
the fee, the higher the refund rate — $88 in your pocket (that you
often didn't even pay yourself), feels good to Stanford students. It
is this mentality that the reforms sought to challenge through voter
education and through introducing real consequences for receiving
a refund."
The difference in the refund rate between the most high
ly refunded student group and the 10th most highly refunded stu
dent group is 0.54 percent. The difference between the most
highly refunded group and the 40th most highly refunded group
is 3.94 percent.
Alisharan said that all types of special-fees groups — from
community service to performance to publication to ethnic groups —
are among the 40 who have experienced the highest refunds.
He said that in previous years, the graduate refund rate was
significantly higher than the undergraduate refund rate.
"Now it's just the opposite," he said.
In the spring quarter of 1999, graduate refund rates ranged
between 12.19 percent and 18.47 percent per group whereas in that

same quarter undergraduate refund rates ranged between 4.3 percent
to 7.31 percent per group.
During this past winter quarter, the undergraduate re
fund rate was 27.47 percent and the graduate refund rate was
10.72 percent.
Alisharan added that the committee also discussed the man
ner in which articles in student newspapers and general word-of
mouth about refunds could have clued more students in to the possi
bility of getting their money back, but he said that the committee
couldn't find a way to quantify these variables. He noted, however,
these factors could have been as important as the quantitative in
crease in the cost per student.
"In the interest of coming up with a practical solution we
focused on drivers we could affect." he said. "There is nothing we
can do to affect word of mouth and even if we could, doing so
would not be an ethical or practical solution. We can't and won't
pin the future hopes of the special-fee system to students not
knowing about refunds. A lasting solution must include better
voter education and clear feedback to student groups.which the
new system provides."
The system, reformed
Both general and special fees are collected from students by
the University registrar on behalf of the ASSU. but these fees differ
in how they are distributed. Special fees are distributed once a year

according to budgets approved by the student population in the
ASSU election each spring. General fees are distributed throughout
the year to student groups by the senate and the GSC, based on an
amount charged to students and approved by them during each
spring election.
The general-fee amount is the amount from the previous year
adjusted for inflation, and students have the option of increasing or
decreasing the set amount for the following year by up to 20 percent
in either direction. Student groups can apply for and receive general
fee funding throughout the year, whereas special fees can only be ap
plied for once a year.
Policies governing how funds can be used also differ between
general and special fees. Most significantly, general-fee disburse
ments are limited to $6,000 per group — although the ASSU recently
raised the amount that community service groups could receive to
$8,000 per group — whereas special-fee requests can be any amount
if the group can get on the ballot, and if the student body supports
them in the spring election.
Last February, the special-fees committee authored four bills
to stabilize the special-fees system, which were approved by both the
Senate and the GSC. To solve this year's potential shortage, one bill

requires the legislation to use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover ac
tual special-fees refunds for up to
16 percent of groups' quarterly
operating budgets. After that
point for this year only, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end
of this fiscal year, money left in
groups' operating budgets will go
back into the buffer fund in the
amount of any outstanding re
fund charge above 16 percent.
"An upwards of 90 percent
of the student body would have
to ask for refunds this quarter to
overrun group reserves and the
buffer," Alisharan said. "If this
were to happen, paying refunds
would be inconsequential com
pared to the impact on student
life. All special-fee groups
would lose their reserves and
without a buffer the ASSU could
not continue the special fee pro
gram, causing all special fee
groups to lose their funding for
several years until a buffer could
be rebuilt."
The other bills in the new
legislation included provisions
that the senators said would
hopefully ensure the long-term
viability of special fees, including
one bill dealing specifically with
student refunds.
Under this bill, students will
no longer receive refunds in the
form of a mailed check. Instead,
the money will be credited to
ward their University bill. The
senators said this change should
prevent students from viewing
refund money as "free cash" —
especially as the money will go to
covers such common outstanding
debts to the University as unpaid
telephone bills.
Students will also be asked
to complete a confidential survey
when they request a refund so
that the ASSU can better under
stand why refund rates have in
creased so much recently.
Shipp said that students
who choose to get a refund
from a group can be denied ser
vices from that group as anoth
er means of removing the re
fund incentive.
"This has been the case with
a few groups in the past, but we
hope that more groups will adopt
this practice," he said.
Other legislation dealt
more directly with the student
groups. In future years, the
groups will be required to cover
any refund amounts in excess of a
predetermined Refund Cost Sur
charge set by the ASSU. In the
event of such an excess, money
will be collected from reserve ac
counts, operating budgets and, in
extreme cases, through the re
possession of other, previously
agreed-upon assets.
The Senate also refocused
the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the
special-fees ballot. Some of the

new provisions resulted in closer scrutiny of special-fees groups by
the ASSU as well as additional steps to the application process.
"In this year's special-fees process, we asked groups to 'de
fine their services' in keeping with the ASSU constitution's restric
tions on charging for events," Shipp said.
Fearon pointed out that with the pre-reform special-fees sys
tem, "It seems that when you ask fora refund on the grounds that you
don't want your money going to group A, it comes out of a general
buffer fund that derives from excess funds overall. But then the rest
of your money is still going to group X just the same as if you hadn't
asked for the refund — I guess you are just lowering the total amount
available for all groups, including ones that you like. If this refund op
tion is supposed to work as a purely symbolic gesture, it seems to me
hard to interpret."
Shipp said that the reforms have reinstated the symbolic
nature of refunds, as funds for refunds now come from groups di
rectly, which he said would hold them individually accountable to
individuals who disagree with them for ideological or administra
tive reasons.
"This will force groups to be active in informing the students
where their money is going, [while encouraging them to deny] their
services to those who obtain refunds," Shipp said. "While this is not
as open and free of an atmosphere [as what] should ideally surround
student activities at Stanford, it confronts the reality of students' ac
tions and attitudes and imposes upon each of us the duty to be re
sponsible and informed in voting and refunding."

often didn't even pay yourself), feels good to Stanford students. It
is this mentality that the reforms sought to challenge through voter
education and through introducing real consequences for receiving
a refund."
The difference in the refund rate between the most high
ly refunded student group and the 10th most highly refunded stu
dent group is 0.54 percent. The difference between the most
highly refunded group and the 40th most highly refunded group
is 3.94 percent.
Alisharan said that all types of special-fees groups — from
community service to performance to publication to ethnic groups —
are among the 40 who have experienced the highest refunds.
He said that in previous years, the graduate refund rate was
significantly higher than the undergraduate refund rate.
"Now it's just the opposite," he said.
In the spring quarter of 1999, graduate refund rates ranged
between 12.19 percent and 18.47 percent per group whereas in that

same quarter undergraduate refund rates ranged between 4.3 percent
to 7.31 percent per group.
During this past winter quarter, the undergraduate re
fund rate was 27.47 percent and the graduate refund rate was
10.72 percent.
Alisharan added that the committee also discussed the man
ner in which articles in student newspapers and general word-of
mouth about refunds could have clued more students in to the possi
bility of getting their money back, but he said that the committee
couldn't find a way to quantify these variables. He noted, however,
these factors could have been as important as the quantitative in
crease in the cost per student.
"In the interest of coming up with a practical solution we
focused on drivers we could affect." he said. "There is nothing we
can do to affect word of mouth and even if we could, doing so
would not be an ethical or practical solution. We can't and won't
pin the future hopes of the special-fee system to students not
knowing about refunds. A lasting solution must include better
voter education and clear feedback to student groups.which the
new system provides."
The system, reformed
Both general and special fees are collected from students by
the University registrar on behalf of the ASSU. but these fees differ
in how they are distributed. Special fees are distributed once a year

according to budgets approved by the student population in the
ASSU election each spring. General fees are distributed throughout
the year to student groups by the senate and the GSC, based on an
amount charged to students and approved by them during each
spring election.
The general-fee amount is the amount from the previous year
adjusted for inflation, and students have the option of increasing or
decreasing the set amount for the following year by up to 20 percent
in either direction. Student groups can apply for and receive general
fee funding throughout the year, whereas special fees can only be ap
plied for once a year.
Policies governing how funds can be used also differ between
general and special fees. Most significantly, general-fee disburse
ments are limited to $6,000 per group — although the ASSU recently
raised the amount that community service groups could receive to
$8,000 per group — whereas special-fee requests can be any amount
if the group can get on the ballot, and if the student body supports
them in the spring election.
Last February, the special-fees committee authored four bills
to stabilize the special-fees system, which were approved by both the
Senate and the GSC. To solve this year's potential shortage, one bill

requires the legislation to use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover ac
tual special-fees refunds for up to
16 percent of groups' quarterly
operating budgets. After that
point for this year only, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end
of this fiscal year, money left in
groups' operating budgets will go
back into the buffer fund in the
amount of any outstanding re
fund charge above 16 percent.
"An upwards of 90 percent
of the student body would have
to ask for refunds this quarter to
overrun group reserves and the
buffer," Alisharan said. "If this
were to happen, paying refunds
would be inconsequential com
pared to the impact on student
life. All special-fee groups
would lose their reserves and
without a buffer the ASSU could
not continue the special fee pro
gram, causing all special fee
groups to lose their funding for
several years until a buffer could
be rebuilt."
The other bills in the new
legislation included provisions
that the senators said would
hopefully ensure the long-term
viability of special fees, including
one bill dealing specifically with
student refunds.
Under this bill, students will
no longer receive refunds in the
form of a mailed check. Instead,
the money will be credited to
ward their University bill. The
senators said this change should
prevent students from viewing
refund money as "free cash" —
especially as the money will go to
covers such common outstanding
debts to the University as unpaid
telephone bills.
Students will also be asked
to complete a confidential survey
when they request a refund so
that the ASSU can better under
stand why refund rates have in
creased so much recently.
Shipp said that students
who choose to get a refund
from a group can be denied ser
vices from that group as anoth
er means of removing the re
fund incentive.
"This has been the case with
a few groups in the past, but we
hope that more groups will adopt
this practice," he said.
Other legislation dealt
more directly with the student
groups. In future years, the
groups will be required to cover
any refund amounts in excess of a
predetermined Refund Cost Sur
charge set by the ASSU. In the
event of such an excess, money
will be collected from reserve ac
counts, operating budgets and, in
extreme cases, through the re
possession of other, previously
agreed-upon assets.
The Senate also refocused
the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the
special-fees ballot. Some of the

new provisions resulted in closer scrutiny of special-fees groups by
the ASSU as well as additional steps to the application process.
"In this year's special-fees process, we asked groups to 'de
fine their services' in keeping with the ASSU constitution's restric
tions on charging for events," Shipp said.
Fearon pointed out that with the pre-reform special-fees sys
tem, "It seems that when you ask fora refund on the grounds that you
don't want your money going to group A, it comes out of a general
buffer fund that derives from excess funds overall. But then the rest
of your money is still going to group X just the same as if you hadn't
asked for the refund — I guess you are just lowering the total amount
available for all groups, including ones that you like. If this refund op
tion is supposed to work as a purely symbolic gesture, it seems to me
hard to interpret."
Shipp said that the reforms have reinstated the symbolic
nature of refunds, as funds for refunds now come from groups di
rectly, which he said would hold them individually accountable to
individuals who disagree with them for ideological or administra
tive reasons.
"This will force groups to be active in informing the students
where their money is going, [while encouraging them to deny] their
services to those who obtain refunds," Shipp said. "While this is not
as open and free of an atmosphere [as what] should ideally surround
student activities at Stanford, it confronts the reality of students' ac
tions and attitudes and imposes upon each of us the duty to be re
sponsible and informed in voting and refunding."

Editor's note: As the campus elections approach, the following two
part series is an effort to clearly explain the special-fees system to the
student body. The jirst article below focuses on the phenomenon of
the skyrocketing refund rate, and the ASSU's response. The second
article will examine the development of the special-fees system over
the years, and the role that special-fees funding plays in supporting
student groups.
During last spring s ASSU elections, the special-fees sys
tem continued the trend from the previous year of growing in size,
with both the number ol groups approved to receive special fees
and the costs to students skyrocketing. This year, however, the sys
tem has been threatened with insolvency as record numbers of stu
dents refunded their money allocated to special-fees groups. As re
tund rates continued to increase during this past winter quarter, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council al
tered both the constitutional by-laws governing the system and the
manner in which they enforced those by-laws to try to ensure the fu
ture of the system.

The impending implo
sion may have been averted by
the Senate's action to try to re
strict the number of special-fees
groups on the ballot and to regu
late how much money those
groups ask of students. However,
many groups seeking fees that
were rejected outright or had
their budgets slashed by the Sen
ate have successfully petitioned
the student body — as per their
ASSU constitutional right —to
be returned to the ballot. Ulti
mately, after the ASSU and the
student body votes on which spe
cial-fees groups to approve each
year, the system will be sustained
or broken based on how much
money is taken back by students
through refunds.
The special-fees contro
versy that has unfolded since last
spring's elections has been a
practical lesson for many stu
dents in a topic taught in classes
in the economics and political
science departments — the "pub
lic goods problem," where any in
dividual can take advantage of a
certain good without paying his
or her share, but if too many peo
ple do so then not enough of the
good will be produced.
Political Science Prof.
James Fearon, who has taught
and published extensively on the
oretical aspects of human behav
ior in political systems, said that
as it has been organized, the spe
cial-fees system has incorporated
"free riders."
"All might be better off
if forced — by a collectively
voted policy — to contribute X
dollars to fund student activi
ties," he said "But if you have the
option of not contributing —
here, demanding a refund —
then you can 'free ride' on the
contributions of others. But then
if too many people do this, there
will be no or very few student ac
tivities and everyone will be
worse off than if you had a policy
of 'no refunds.' "
Fearon added that the
special-fees system is complicat
ed by the fact that students have
different preferences for which
groups should be funded, and for
how much. Thus, he said that
"students with low demand for
these activities are subsidizing
those with higher demands, and
students who object to funding
activity A are providing funds for
activity A — the same is true, of
course, with tax payments to the
U.S. government."
Since 2000, the annual
amount of special-fees funding
has increased by nearly $1 mil
lion, from $1,486,538.24 to
$2,407,668.05 — which comes to
an increase of $99 per year in the
special fee paid by each under
graduate. During that same time
period, the total refund rate has
nearly tripled, from 7.52 percent
to 22 percent.
Last winter, as the re
fund spike continued and the ad
hoc special-fees committee

made up of members from the Undergraduate Senate and GSC ex
amined how to stabilize the system, they isolated three factors that
had combined to cause the problem, said ASSU Financial Manager
Kyle Alisharan.
The first factor they found was a large increase in the number
of groups receiving special-fees funding; this caused an increase in the
size of the total undergraduate fee. The second factor was that there
was a "lack of feedback between groups and students — meaning stu
dents were not feeling the impact of groups and groups were not feel
ing the impact of special-fee refunds." The third factor was a change
in voter philosophy.
"From talking to alumni and current students it seems as
though current students ask for refunds based on their participation
in a given group [that they belong toj," Alisharan said. "According to
alumni, students used to ask for refunds as a way to voice ideological
opposition [to a group], and were willing to fund groups they did not
participate in order to support student life.
He also said that the ASSU has anecdotal evidence of a few
groups last year asking students to approve their special-fees mea
sures, while telling the same students that they should get their refund
back from the same group after that group s approval.
Junior Josh Shipp, the senate chair and a member of the spe
cial-fees committee, said that the committee found that the main
problem with the refund system has been that students are choosing
request refunds from groups that they still benefit from.
"[S]tudents aren't living up to their end of the special fees

bargain," he said. "With the fee approaching a 'round' $100, stu
dents are much more likely to refund the majority of groups, de
spite continuing to benefit from those groups' services. The higher
the fee, the higher the refund rate — $88 in your pocket (that you
often didn't even pay yourself), feels good to Stanford students. It
is this mentality that the reforms sought to challenge through voter
education and through introducing real consequences for receiving
a refund."
The difference in the refund rate between the most high
ly refunded student group and the 10th most highly refunded stu
dent group is 0.54 percent. The difference between the most
highly refunded group and the 40th most highly refunded group
is 3.94 percent.
Alisharan said that all types of special-fees groups — from
community service to performance to publication to ethnic groups —
are among the 40 who have experienced the highest refunds.
He said that in previous years, the graduate refund rate was
significantly higher than the undergraduate refund rate.

between 12.19 percent and 18.47 percent per group whereas in that

same quarter undergraduate refund rates ranged between 4.3 percent
to 7.31 percent per group.
During this past winter quarter, the undergraduate re
fund rate was 27.47 percent and the graduate refund rate was
10.72 percent.

any refund amounts in excess of a
predetermined Refund Cost Sur
charge set by the ASSU. In the
event of such an excess, money
will be collected from reserve ac
counts, operating budgets and, in
extreme cases, through the re
possession of other, previously
agreed-upon assets.
The Senate also refocused
the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the
special-fees ballot. Some of the

new provisions resulted in closer scrutiny of special-fees groups by
the ASSU as well as additional steps to the application process.
"In this year's special-fees process, we asked groups to 'de
fine their services' in keeping with the ASSU constitution's restric
tions on charging for events," Shipp said.
Fearon pointed out that with the pre-reform special-fees sys
tem, "It seems that when you ask fora refund on the grounds that you
don't want your money going to group A, it comes out of a general
buffer fund that derives from excess funds overall. But then the rest
of your money is still going to group X just the same as if you hadn't
asked for the refund — I guess you are just lowering the total amount
available for all groups, including ones that you like. If this refund op
tion is supposed to work as a purely symbolic gesture, it seems to me
hard to interpret."
Shipp said that the reforms have reinstated the symbolic
nature of refunds, as funds for refunds now come from groups di
rectly, which he said would hold them individually accountable to
individuals who disagree with them for ideological or administra
tive reasons.
"This will force groups to be active in informing the students
where their money is going, [while encouraging them to deny] their
services to those who obtain refunds," Shipp said. "While this is not
as open and free of an atmosphere [as what] should ideally surround
student activities at Stanford, it confronts the reality of students' ac
tions and attitudes and imposes upon each of us the duty to be re
sponsible and informed in voting and refunding."

Editor's note: As the campus elections approach, the following two
part series is an effort to clearly explain the special-fees system to the
student body. The jirst article below focuses on the phenomenon of
the skyrocketing refund rate, and the ASSU's response. The second
article will examine the development of the special-fees system over
the years, and the role that special-fees funding plays in supporting
student groups.
During last spring s ASSU elections, the special-fees sys
tem continued the trend from the previous year of growing in size,
with both the number ol groups approved to receive special fees
and the costs to students skyrocketing. This year, however, the sys
tem has been threatened with insolvency as record numbers of stu
dents refunded their money allocated to special-fees groups. As re
tund rates continued to increase during this past winter quarter, the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student Council al
tered both the constitutional by-laws governing the system and the
manner in which they enforced those by-laws to try to ensure the fu
ture of the system.

The impending implo
sion may have been averted by
the Senate's action to try to re
strict the number of special-fees
groups on the ballot and to regu
late how much money those
groups ask of students. However,
many groups seeking fees that
were rejected outright or had
their budgets slashed by the Sen
ate have successfully petitioned
the student body — as per their
ASSU constitutional right —to
be returned to the ballot. Ulti
mately, after the ASSU and the
student body votes on which spe
cial-fees groups to approve each
year, the system will be sustained
or broken based on how much
money is taken back by students
through refunds.
The special-fees contro
versy that has unfolded since last
spring's elections has been a
practical lesson for many stu
dents in a topic taught in classes
in the economics and political
science departments — the "pub
lic goods problem," where any in
dividual can take advantage of a
certain good without paying his
or her share, but if too many peo
ple do so then not enough of the
good will be produced.
Political Science Prof.
James Fearon, who has taught
and published extensively on the
oretical aspects of human behav
ior in political systems, said that
as it has been organized, the spe
cial-fees system has incorporated
"free riders."
"All might be better off
if forced — by a collectively
voted policy — to contribute X
dollars to fund student activi
ties," he said "But if you have the
option of not contributing —
here, demanding a refund —
then you can 'free ride' on the
contributions of others. But then
if too many people do this, there
will be no or very few student ac
tivities and everyone will be
worse off than if you had a policy
of 'no refunds.' "
Fearon added that the
special-fees system is complicat
ed by the fact that students have
different preferences for which
groups should be funded, and for
how much. Thus, he said that
"students with low demand for
these activities are subsidizing
those with higher demands, and
students who object to funding
activity A are providing funds for
activity A — the same is true, of
course, with tax payments to the
U.S. government."
Since 2000, the annual
amount of special-fees funding
has increased by nearly $1 mil
lion, from $1,486,538.24 to
$2,407,668.05 — which comes to
an increase of $99 per year in the
special fee paid by each under
graduate. During that same time
period, the total refund rate has
nearly tripled, from 7.52 percent
to 22 percent.
Last winter, as the re
fund spike continued and the ad
hoc special-fees committee

made up of members from the Undergraduate Senate and GSC ex
amined how to stabilize the system, they isolated three factors that
had combined to cause the problem, said ASSU Financial Manager
Kyle Alisharan.
The first factor they found was a large increase in the number
of groups receiving special-fees funding; this caused an increase in the
size of the total undergraduate fee. The second factor was that there
was a "lack of feedback between groups and students — meaning stu
dents were not feeling the impact of groups and groups were not feel
ing the impact of special-fee refunds." The third factor was a change
in voter philosophy.
"From talking to alumni and current students it seems as
though current students ask for refunds based on their participation
in a given group [that they belong toj," Alisharan said. "According to
alumni, students used to ask for refunds as a way to voice ideological
opposition [to a group], and were willing to fund groups they did not
participate in order to support student life.
He also said that the ASSU has anecdotal evidence of a few
groups last year asking students to approve their special-fees mea
sures, while telling the same students that they should get their refund
back from the same group after that group s approval.
Junior Josh Shipp, the senate chair and a member of the spe
cial-fees committee, said that the committee found that the main
problem with the refund system has been that students are choosing
request refunds from groups that they still benefit from.
"[S]tudents aren't living up to their end of the special fees

bargain," he said. "With the fee approaching a 'round' $100, stu
dents are much more likely to refund the majority of groups, de
spite continuing to benefit from those groups' services. The higher
the fee, the higher the refund rate — $88 in your pocket (that you
often didn't even pay yourself), feels good to Stanford students. It
is this mentality that the reforms sought to challenge through voter
education and through introducing real consequences for receiving
a refund."
The difference in the refund rate between the most high
ly refunded student group and the 10th most highly refunded stu
dent group is 0.54 percent. The difference between the most
highly refunded group and the 40th most highly refunded group
is 3.94 percent.
Alisharan said that all types of special-fees groups — from
community service to performance to publication to ethnic groups —
are among the 40 who have experienced the highest refunds.
He said that in previous years, the graduate refund rate was
significantly higher than the undergraduate refund rate.
"Now it's just the opposite," he said.
In the spring quarter of 1999, graduate refund rates ranged
between 12.19 percent and 18.47 percent per group whereas in that

same quarter undergraduate refund rates ranged between 4.3 percent
to 7.31 percent per group.
During this past winter quarter, the undergraduate re
fund rate was 27.47 percent and the graduate refund rate was
10.72 percent.
Alisharan added that the committee also discussed the man
ner in which articles in student newspapers and general word-of
mouth about refunds could have clued more students in to the possi
bility of getting their money back, but he said that the committee
couldn't find a way to quantify these variables. He noted, however,
these factors could have been as important as the quantitative in
crease in the cost per student.
"In the interest of coming up with a practical solution we
focused on drivers we could affect." he said. "There is nothing we
can do to affect word of mouth and even if we could, doing so
would not be an ethical or practical solution. We can't and won't
pin the future hopes of the special-fee system to students not
knowing about refunds. A lasting solution must include better
voter education and clear feedback to student groups.which the
new system provides."
The system, reformed
Both general and special fees are collected from students by
the University registrar on behalf of the ASSU. but these fees differ
in how they are distributed. Special fees are distributed once a year

according to budgets approved by the student population in the
ASSU election each spring. General fees are distributed throughout
the year to student groups by the senate and the GSC, based on an
amount charged to students and approved by them during each
spring election.
The general-fee amount is the amount from the previous year
adjusted for inflation, and students have the option of increasing or
decreasing the set amount for the following year by up to 20 percent
in either direction. Student groups can apply for and receive general
fee funding throughout the year, whereas special fees can only be ap
plied for once a year.
Policies governing how funds can be used also differ between
general and special fees. Most significantly, general-fee disburse
ments are limited to $6,000 per group — although the ASSU recently
raised the amount that community service groups could receive to
$8,000 per group — whereas special-fee requests can be any amount
if the group can get on the ballot, and if the student body supports
them in the spring election.
Last February, the special-fees committee authored four bills
to stabilize the special-fees system, which were approved by both the
Senate and the GSC. To solve this year's potential shortage, one bill

requires the legislation to use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover ac
tual special-fees refunds for up to
16 percent of groups' quarterly
operating budgets. After that
point for this year only, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end
of this fiscal year, money left in
groups' operating budgets will go
back into the buffer fund in the
amount of any outstanding re
fund charge above 16 percent.
"An upwards of 90 percent
of the student body would have
to ask for refunds this quarter to
overrun group reserves and the
buffer," Alisharan said. "If this
were to happen, paying refunds
would be inconsequential com
pared to the impact on student
life. All special-fee groups
would lose their reserves and
without a buffer the ASSU could
not continue the special fee pro
gram, causing all special fee
groups to lose their funding for
several years until a buffer could
be rebuilt."
The other bills in the new
legislation included provisions
that the senators said would
hopefully ensure the long-term
viability of special fees, including
one bill dealing specifically with
student refunds.
Under this bill, students will
no longer receive refunds in the
form of a mailed check. Instead,
the money will be credited to
ward their University bill. The
senators said this change should
prevent students from viewing
refund money as "free cash" —
especially as the money will go to
covers such common outstanding
debts to the University as unpaid
telephone bills.
Students will also be asked
to complete a confidential survey
when they request a refund so
that the ASSU can better under
stand why refund rates have in
creased so much recently.
Shipp said that students
who choose to get a refund
from a group can be denied ser
vices from that group as anoth
er means of removing the re
fund incentive.
"This has been the case with
a few groups in the past, but we
hope that more groups will adopt
this practice," he said.
Other legislation dealt
more directly with the student
groups. In future years, the
groups will be required to cover
any refund amounts in excess of a
predetermined Refund Cost Sur
charge set by the ASSU. In the
event of such an excess, money
will be collected from reserve ac
counts, operating budgets and, in
extreme cases, through the re
possession of other, previously
agreed-upon assets.
The Senate also refocused
the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the
special-fees ballot. Some of the

new provisions resulted in closer scrutiny of special-fees groups by
the ASSU as well as additional steps to the application process.
"In this year's special-fees process, we asked groups to 'de
fine their services' in keeping with the ASSU constitution's restric
tions on charging for events," Shipp said.
Fearon pointed out that with the pre-reform special-fees sys
tem, "It seems that when you ask fora refund on the grounds that you
don't want your money going to group A, it comes out of a general

nearly tripled, from 7.52 percent
to 22 percent.
Last winter, as the re
fund spike continued and the ad
hoc special-fees committee

made up of members from the Undergraduate Senate and GSC ex
amined how to stabilize the system, they isolated three factors that
had combined to cause the problem, said ASSU Financial Manager
Kyle Alisharan.
The first factor they found was a large increase in the number
of groups receiving special-fees funding; this caused an increase in the
size of the total undergraduate fee. The second factor was that there
was a "lack of feedback between groups and students — meaning stu
dents were not feeling the impact of groups and groups were not feel
ing the impact of special-fee refunds." The third factor was a change
in voter philosophy.
"From talking to alumni and current students it seems as
though current students ask for refunds based on their participation
in a given group [that they belong toj," Alisharan said. "According to
alumni, students used to ask for refunds as a way to voice ideological
opposition [to a group], and were willing to fund groups they did not
participate in order to support student life.
He also said that the ASSU has anecdotal evidence of a few
groups last year asking students to approve their special-fees mea
sures, while telling the same students that they should get their refund
back from the same group after that group s approval.
Junior Josh Shipp, the senate chair and a member of the spe
cial-fees committee, said that the committee found that the main
problem with the refund system has been that students are choosing
request refunds from groups that they still benefit from.
"[S]tudents aren't living up to their end of the special fees

bargain," he said. "With the fee approaching a 'round' $100, stu
dents are much more likely to refund the majority of groups, de
spite continuing to benefit from those groups' services. The higher
the fee, the higher the refund rate — $88 in your pocket (that you
often didn't even pay yourself), feels good to Stanford students. It
is this mentality that the reforms sought to challenge through voter
education and through introducing real consequences for receiving
a refund."
The difference in the refund rate between the most high
ly refunded student group and the 10th most highly refunded stu
dent group is 0.54 percent. The difference between the most
highly refunded group and the 40th most highly refunded group
is 3.94 percent.
Alisharan said that all types of special-fees groups — from
community service to performance to publication to ethnic groups —
are among the 40 who have experienced the highest refunds.
He said that in previous years, the graduate refund rate was
significantly higher than the undergraduate refund rate.
"Now it's just the opposite," he said.
In the spring quarter of 1999, graduate refund rates ranged
between 12.19 percent and 18.47 percent per group whereas in that

same quarter undergraduate refund rates ranged between 4.3 percent
to 7.31 percent per group.
During this past winter quarter, the undergraduate re
fund rate was 27.47 percent and the graduate refund rate was
10.72 percent.
Alisharan added that the committee also discussed the man
ner in which articles in student newspapers and general word-of
mouth about refunds could have clued more students in to the possi
bility of getting their money back, but he said that the committee
couldn't find a way to quantify these variables. He noted, however,
these factors could have been as important as the quantitative in
crease in the cost per student.
"In the interest of coming up with a practical solution we
focused on drivers we could affect." he said. "There is nothing we
can do to affect word of mouth and even if we could, doing so
would not be an ethical or practical solution. We can't and won't
pin the future hopes of the special-fee system to students not
knowing about refunds. A lasting solution must include better
voter education and clear feedback to student groups.which the
new system provides."
The system, reformed
Both general and special fees are collected from students by
the University registrar on behalf of the ASSU. but these fees differ
in how they are distributed. Special fees are distributed once a year

according to budgets approved by the student population in the
ASSU election each spring. General fees are distributed throughout
the year to student groups by the senate and the GSC, based on an
amount charged to students and approved by them during each
spring election.
The general-fee amount is the amount from the previous year
adjusted for inflation, and students have the option of increasing or
decreasing the set amount for the following year by up to 20 percent
in either direction. Student groups can apply for and receive general
fee funding throughout the year, whereas special fees can only be ap
plied for once a year.
Policies governing how funds can be used also differ between
general and special fees. Most significantly, general-fee disburse
ments are limited to $6,000 per group — although the ASSU recently
raised the amount that community service groups could receive to
$8,000 per group — whereas special-fee requests can be any amount
if the group can get on the ballot, and if the student body supports
them in the spring election.
Last February, the special-fees committee authored four bills
to stabilize the special-fees system, which were approved by both the
Senate and the GSC. To solve this year's potential shortage, one bill

requires the legislation to use the
ASSU's buffer fund to cover ac
tual special-fees refunds for up to
16 percent of groups' quarterly
operating budgets. After that
point for this year only, the
ASSU will take the money from
groups' reserve accounts, but the
buffer fund will cover refund-in
curred charges once groups' re
serves are exhausted. At the end
of this fiscal year, money left in
groups' operating budgets will go
back into the buffer fund in the
amount of any outstanding re
fund charge above 16 percent.
"An upwards of 90 percent
of the student body would have
to ask for refunds this quarter to
overrun group reserves and the
buffer," Alisharan said. "If this
were to happen, paying refunds
would be inconsequential com
pared to the impact on student
life. All special-fee groups
would lose their reserves and
without a buffer the ASSU could
not continue the special fee pro
gram, causing all special fee
groups to lose their funding for
several years until a buffer could
be rebuilt."
The other bills in the new
legislation included provisions
that the senators said would
hopefully ensure the long-term
viability of special fees, including
one bill dealing specifically with
student refunds.
Under this bill, students will
no longer receive refunds in the
form of a mailed check. Instead,
the money will be credited to
ward their University bill. The
senators said this change should
prevent students from viewing
refund money as "free cash" —
especially as the money will go to
covers such common outstanding
debts to the University as unpaid
telephone bills.
Students will also be asked
to complete a confidential survey
when they request a refund so
that the ASSU can better under
stand why refund rates have in
creased so much recently.
Shipp said that students
who choose to get a refund
from a group can be denied ser
vices from that group as anoth
er means of removing the re
fund incentive.
"This has been the case with
a few groups in the past, but we
hope that more groups will adopt
this practice," he said.
Other legislation dealt
more directly with the student
groups. In future years, the
groups will be required to cover
any refund amounts in excess of a
predetermined Refund Cost Sur
charge set by the ASSU. In the
event of such an excess, money
will be collected from reserve ac
counts, operating budgets and, in
extreme cases, through the re
possession of other, previously
agreed-upon assets.
The Senate also refocused
the process by which a student
group applies to be put on the
special-fees ballot. Some of the

new provisions resulted in closer scrutiny of special-fees groups by
the ASSU as well as additional steps to the application process.
"In this year's special-fees process, we asked groups to 'de
fine their services' in keeping with the ASSU constitution's restric
tions on charging for events," Shipp said.
Fearon pointed out that with the pre-reform special-fees sys
tem, "It seems that when you ask fora refund on the grounds that you
don't want your money going to group A, it comes out of a general
buffer fund that derives from excess funds overall. But then the rest
of your money is still going to group X just the same as if you hadn't
asked for the refund — I guess you are just lowering the total amount
available for all groups, including ones that you like. If this refund op
tion is supposed to work as a purely symbolic gesture, it seems to me
hard to interpret."
Shipp said that the reforms have reinstated the symbolic
nature of refunds, as funds for refunds now come from groups di
rectly, which he said would hold them individually accountable to
individuals who disagree with them for ideological or administra
tive reasons.
"This will force groups to be active in informing the students
where their money is going, [while encouraging them to deny] their
services to those who obtain refunds," Shipp said. "While this is not
as open and free of an atmosphere [as what] should ideally surround
student activities at Stanford, it confronts the reality of students' ac
tions and attitudes and imposes upon each of us the duty to be re
sponsible and informed in voting and refunding."
