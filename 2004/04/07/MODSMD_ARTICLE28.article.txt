## McCarthy on the merits of being svelte and sporty 
### 
Two o'clock on Tuesday was the
best part of my week in middle
school. It meant an hour of playing
basketball instead of diagramming
sentences or learning about the American
Revolution or whatever it was that seventh
graders did in class.
From P.E., I'd go directly to baseball prac
tice and at night I'd come back to school for
basketball. Riding in my dad's '87 Accord
meant finding a seat among the bat bags and
soccer cleats, all of which were covered with
a fine layer of brick dust. All of this cost my
parents a lot of time on the road and
heartache, and absorbed hundreds of hours
of my childhood, but it was all worth it for one

important reason:
I was never fat.
The American obesity
epidemic is worse than
ever. The average Ameri
can child is getting fatter
by the second. His BMI is
higher than that of his
peer in virtually any
other developed country,
and he is at high risk for
heart disease and high
blood pressure.

Furthermore, he's almost certain to be
come an object of ridicule. But the solution to
this problem, according to educators and cul
tural knowledge, is not to get the child off his
fat ass, but to force other children to under
stand his plight.
There's an easy response to this dilemma
though: Stop being fat, primarily via youth
sports. Anything that keeps a kid outside and
active is bound to prevent him from develop
ing arm rolls.
Listen, Chunk, not only are you slowly
killing yourself from the inside out, you're
making me watch you do it, and that sickens
me. What's worse is the deluge of feel-good
messages proclaiming that it's OK to be fat,
even if it's unhealthy.
I feel like the most obvious solution to the
problem of being fat would be to get outside
and play some volleyball, as opposed to say
ing, "I'm comfortable with my body, and you
should be too!" (Note: This applies to both
men AND women; it's just that instead of
being called "comfortable with their bodies,"
men are given comical nicknames like
"Chubs McSloth" or "Blumpkin" or "Fat
Steve." God bless fraternities.)
Ninety-nine percent of the time, being
overweight is a choice, and in a child's case,
it's usually a choice made by the parents. Ge
netically predisposed or not, it is impossible
to engage in an active lifestyle and eat even
relatively healthy foods and not stay in shape.
Even one hour of basketball can burn
around 300 calories in a kid — calories
that might otherwise turn into the reason
little Johnny gets made fun of at school
and has a heart attack at 38. There are a
thousand different ways for kids to get in
volved in any kind of activity that would
keep them fit. There's no excuse for allow
ing your child to turn into a dead ringer for
the Man Show Boy.
Despite all this, there's been a recent
backlash against forcing kids into sports, to
the point where it's dangerous to suggest that
you should actually tell your child to do any
thing. It would be okay with me for my kid
not to play sports. If he chooses not to partic
ipate, he'll find some other aerobic activity to
get involved in post haste, or he will be run
ning laps around the back yard.
Parents, do your part and support an ac
tive lifestyle for your kid. rather than waiting
until he's laboring to breathe when climbing
stairs and then hiring a personal trainer.
It's become de rigueur to blame McDon
ald's and Play Station for the vast waistlines of
America, but that's not the problem. The al
ternative of a sedentary, unhealthy lifestyle
will always be out there, and it's up to parents
to keep their children from becoming depen
dent on Tony Hawk for entertainment and
deriving all their nutrition from McGriddles.
Prevent your kid from becoming another
desk-ridden orca. Enroll him in Little League
and AYSO. Buy him a bike and encourage
him to use it. Make time to throw the ball
around the yard with your son or daughter
and make sure they know the value of sports,
before they turn into little John Goodmans
and Roseanne Barrs.
So. to wrap up, when your child has a navel
he could lose a baseball in. that's unhealthy
for him and revolting to me. Please, ingrain
the value of sports in your child and don't
make me shoulder the burden of society by
ridiculing him into a trip to the gym. My time
is constrained enough as it is.

Two o'clock on Tuesday was the
best part of my week in middle
school. It meant an hour of playing
basketball instead of diagramming
sentences or learning about the American
Revolution or whatever it was that seventh
graders did in class.
From P.E., I'd go directly to baseball prac
tice and at night I'd come back to school for
basketball. Riding in my dad's '87 Accord
meant finding a seat among the bat bags and
soccer cleats, all of which were covered with
a fine layer of brick dust. All of this cost my
parents a lot of time on the road and
heartache, and absorbed hundreds of hours
of my childhood, but it was all worth it for one

important reason:
I was never fat.
The American obesity
epidemic is worse than
ever. The average Ameri
can child is getting fatter
by the second. His BMI is
higher than that of his
peer in virtually any
other developed country,
and he is at high risk for
heart disease and high
blood pressure.

Furthermore, he's almost certain to be
come an object of ridicule. But the solution to
this problem, according to educators and cul
tural knowledge, is not to get the child off his
fat ass, but to force other children to under
stand his plight.
There's an easy response to this dilemma
though: Stop being fat, primarily via youth
sports. Anything that keeps a kid outside and
active is bound to prevent him from develop
ing arm rolls.
Listen, Chunk, not only are you slowly
killing yourself from the inside out, you're
making me watch you do it, and that sickens
me. What's worse is the deluge of feel-good
messages proclaiming that it's OK to be fat,
even if it's unhealthy.
I feel like the most obvious solution to the
problem of being fat would be to get outside
and play some volleyball, as opposed to say
ing, "I'm comfortable with my body, and you
should be too!" (Note: This applies to both
men AND women; it's just that instead of
being called "comfortable with their bodies,"
men are given comical nicknames like
"Chubs McSloth" or "Blumpkin" or "Fat
Steve." God bless fraternities.)
Ninety-nine percent of the time, being
overweight is a choice, and in a child's case,
it's usually a choice made by the parents. Ge
netically predisposed or not, it is impossible
to engage in an active lifestyle and eat even
relatively healthy foods and not stay in shape.
Even one hour of basketball can burn
around 300 calories in a kid — calories
that might otherwise turn into the reason
little Johnny gets made fun of at school
and has a heart attack at 38. There are a
thousand different ways for kids to get in
volved in any kind of activity that would
keep them fit. There's no excuse for allow
ing your child to turn into a dead ringer for
the Man Show Boy.
Despite all this, there's been a recent
backlash against forcing kids into sports, to
the point where it's dangerous to suggest that
you should actually tell your child to do any
thing. It would be okay with me for my kid
not to play sports. If he chooses not to partic
ipate, he'll find some other aerobic activity to
get involved in post haste, or he will be run
ning laps around the back yard.
Parents, do your part and support an ac
tive lifestyle for your kid. rather than waiting
until he's laboring to breathe when climbing
stairs and then hiring a personal trainer.
