# LOWRIE LOCKS AND LOADS
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Sophomore Jed Lowrie posted 62 hits in 60 games during his rook
ie campaign — but not a single home run.
After just 27 games this year, the Stanford infielder has eight.
Fora baseball powerhouse that loses valuable hitters to the MLB
Draft and graduation every season, it has become essential for players
to step into new roles in the lineup to fill up the gaps left behind. Ev
eryone knew that someone would come forward to lead the offense for
the 2004 season, but few predicted that the explosion in the lineup
would come from Lowrie.
"I expected [sophomore first baseman John Mayberry Jr.] to have a
better year," Stanford head coach Mark Marquess said. "1 expected
[junior leftfielder Danny Putnam] to improve.
"But would I have guessed [Lowrie] would have no homers [last
season] and eight now? Probably not."
Regardless of the expectations, Lowrie has become a pleasant
power-hitting surprise for the Cardinal. As the squad's number three
batter, he paces the team in most offensive categories, including runs
scored (36), RBls (37), slugging percentage (.765), on-base percentage
(.500), homers (8) and triples (4).
"There's a distinct difference in throwing to |Lowrie] this year
as compared to last year," sophomore pitcher Jeff Gilmore said.
"He was a tough out last year, he was one of the hardest hitters to
strike out on the team. But you didn't have to worry about him as
a power threat. Now if you make a mistake, he's going to get an
extra-base hit."
There are many different factors to which Lowrie's new-found po
tency could be attributed, but the most obvious are physical.
In addition to working hard to build strength in the offseason,
Lowrie worked with his hitting coach — he's been taking private hit
ting lessons in his hometown of Salem, Ore. since the age of eight — to
make his swing more effective.
"[My stance has] opened up a little, so I can move my hips faster
to get the inside pitch," Lowrie explained. "And I've added a leg
kick when I get ahead in the count so that I can take risks and go for
[a big hit]."
Lowrie's swing isn't only recognizable because of the motions —
he's the only Cardinal player that switch-hits, an unmistakable advan
tage for the .388 slugger.
Though Lowrie is equally effective from both sides of the plate —
he claims to be more confident left-handed, as the team faces more
right-handed pitchers during games — he has only been switch-hitting
since high school. The idea started when Lowrie's father suggested one
day at the batting cages that he try hitting left-handed.
"I didn't jump in there and hit right away," Lowrie said. "But there
was something there."
Aside from the altered physical aspects of his game, Lowrie
says that his mentality has transformed as well. While hitting near
the bottom of the order last season, his role was to try to spark ral
lies and get key two-outs hits. Now that he occupies the three
hole for Stanford, Lowrie gets looked to as what he dubs the
"RBI Guy."
"My mental approach changed ... [Now] I'm really trying to drive
with people on base," he said. "But my goals change depending on how
the team is doing ... game by game, week by week. [Sometimes my
goal is] to hit a home run, but if I need to sac bunt or move a guy over,
then that's my [new] goal."
Though Lowrie's bat stats get most of the attention, his defensive
skills are just as impressive. He emerged last season as a solid second
baseman and started 53 games at the position — despite being a short
stop throughout his high school career.
"Jed Lowrie is our best shortstop and he is also our best second
baseman," Marquess said — before adding with a smile, "I tried to
cut him in half and have him play both places, but it didn't work out."
Lowrie admits that last season his switch from short to second was a
little bit shaky, but now he is comfortable playing either position.

This year, Lowrie has about as many starts at shortstop as at second, as freshman
Adam Sorgi. sophomore Chris Lewis and sophomore Chris Minaker are all vying for one
of the two spots.
"It's really about adjustment," Lowrie said of his leadership role in the infield. "You
have to adjust to having a new guy out there, his personality and style of play."
Putnam said that the adjustments Lowrie has made defensively since his arrival at
Stanford embody the kind of attitude that he brings to the game.
"He's just so unselfish," Putnam said. "He's willing to do anything that's best for
the team."

True to Putnam's description of him, Lowrie said that primary concern is that the team
"win it all" when the College World Series comes in June.
Of course, personal recognition has already began rolling in for Lowrie. He is on the
National Player of the Year watch, was NCWBA National Co-Hitter of the Week last
month, and tied the NCAA single-game record for triples (three, on Feb. 27).
But in case you were beginning to get the impression that Lowrie is good at everything,
he assures you it isn't true.
"1 am really, really bad at anything where my feet aren't on the ground," he said,
laughing. "Skateboarding, rollerblading ... snowboarding, skiing, anything with wheels.
It's terrible."
