### BEN WHALEY 
While some copyright owners are suing students and
users who download their music, movies and books. Law
Prof. Lawrence Lessig has made his most recent book
available for free over the Internet.
Practicing the method he promotes in his new book — "Free
Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock
Down Culture and Control Creativity" — Lessig is searching for
both a larger audience and a new approach to copyrighted work.
In his book, Lessig criticizes media companies using their
monopolies and lawsuits to stifle creativity. Earlier this
month the Recording Industry Association of America
sued a Stanford student for the first time for copyright in
fringement for downloading songs.
Lessig debuted his new work in the traditional way, with a
$24.95 price tag and a spot on the shelves of major bookstores
across the nation. "Free Culture" was also released in its en
tirety in a free downloadable format, available via Web sites
such Amazon.com and Lessig's own free-culture.org.
Lessig said that convincing his publisher to allow the free
release of the book was difficult at first.
Lessig presented two numbers to the publishing company.
Penguin Press. The first was the estimated number of people
who would decide not to buy the book due to its availability
on the Internet. The second number, what Lessig called the
"commercial interest," was the number of people who would

have had no interest in the book under regular circumstances,
but due to the fact that a free copy was available online, would
begin reading it and eventually buy a hard copy.
"Needless to say, the second number is larger than the
first," Lessig said.
In the end, Lessig said, he thinks most people will end up
with a physical purchase.
"People don't really like reading whole books online," he
said. "Amazon.com has a link on the site to download the
book, and they're a business — in it only for selling books."
Lessig stated, however, that there was definitely anxiety
on the part of the publisher to offer the book for free.
"It's to their great credit that they're willing to experi
ment," he said. "If it works, more publishers will push to re
lease books free online."
Lessig is not the first author to release his book in an online for
mat. Othere have released their works online, and science fiction
author Cory Doctorow was one of the firet to use the "creative
commons" license that Lessig champions. Doctorow's "Down
and Out in the Magic Kingdom" — published by Tor Publishing
— was received as a mainstream book, despite its novel licease.
Under the "creative commons" copyright license (the
same license that "Free Culture" is released under), not only
could people download this book in its entirety online, they
could make as many copies as they wanted and distribute
them, as long as they credited the work to Doctorow. "Down
and Out in the Magic Kingdom" shows the potential success

es that book experiments such as this can have. Doctorow's
book, despite being available for free on the web, sold well
and garnered great reviews from mainstream outlets such as
The New York Times and Entertainment Weekly.
While Lessig used Doctorow's case and his own projec
tions to sell his experimental idea to the publisher, the real
motive behind the free online version of the book was to be
true to the work's title.
"I want to put the information out there," said Lessig.
Within the first launch day there were nine different for
mats of Free Culture available on the Internet. There are ver
sions of the book that act as an editable PDF file, with readers
being able to modify whatever they would like in the text.
"The work is spreading," Lessig said. "These are creative
reuses of the book, some of them I didn't expect."
"Free Culture" is Lessig's third book, following his other suc
cessful works "Code" and"The Future of Ideas." The new book
discusses the consequences of a war against creativity on the In
ternet, being waged through litigation and legislation. According
to Lessig's Web site, this is an argument about our "freedom to
create, freedom to build, and ultimately, freedom to imagine."
The content and context of this debate includes, but is not limited
to, issues of file sharing music remixes and original written content
According to Lessig, "The copyright wars are causing harm
to the opportunity of creativity in the Internet and we need to
find a way to peace for the Internet that supports decentralized
creativity. That's not what Washington understands."
