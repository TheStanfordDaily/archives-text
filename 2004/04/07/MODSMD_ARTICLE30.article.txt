# Bret's guide to the madness of spring sports
## 
### 
It's time to do it big. Smell the flowers, pick a clean pair
of aviators off the rack at Longs Drugs and grab some
new D-cell batteries for pumping Naughty by Nature
on the old 30-watt boom box. Sign up for golf, tennis,

yoga, swimming and EDGE twice.
Rock the aloha boardshorts to class,
strap a life preserver to the back of the
old mountaineering pack and take a dip
in the White Plaza fountain between
classes. Break out the lawn darts your ma
swore you'd take your brother's eye out
with when you were little. Bust out the
shell-toe boots for the KA Kickball clas
sic. Designate that "21 and sporting
guns'' tank top your long-lost cousin sent
you by Priority Mail lor your birthday as
the spring sloshball jersey.

Head to Haight Ashbury for some miniature raver
glowsticks; drill a hole through a dozen old Top Flite XLs;
grab some crazy glue, a Jamba Juice and get to the nearest
links for the first full moon of the quarter. Duct tape to
gether as many trash bags possible and grab the hose fora
college-budget Slip-n-Slide. Find a BBQ and a wiffle-ball
bat somewhere, anywhere. And if nothing else, find a plas
ma screen with Tivo and watch some of last month's sport
ing action.
Yeah, it's been March Madness — in a lot of sports.
Of course, there's been great basketball. March has
been the stage for all the basketball predictions, all the
newspaper and magazine articles, all the analyses since Oc
tober, to finally take shape. Time for teams to make names
for themselves; time for teams to live up to the hype. Time
for seniors to get it all out their systems, for fans to cheer in
desperation through high-definition screens.
There's no better drama going. ER, CSI? You can have
'em all. Buzzer beaters, OT, upsets, adrenalaine, dunks and
blocks permanently etched into memory.

Championships. Preseason No. l's can't kiss a trophy,
meet the president, or end the season smiling with Dick
Vitale until they win one. Sure, it's easy to get mixed up
watching Digger Phelps hate on your school's program all
season and all tournament long — unless your program is
Phelps's beloved Notre Dame — but the NC AA Tourna
ment is a refreshing, month-long reminder of why the
game is played.
And yeah, it's been March Madness on the PGA. The
unstoppable, unbeatable Tiger Woods failed to make a
cut, and failed to repeat for the fifth straight time at Bay
Hill. John Daly has crept to fourth on the tour in putting,
shot a bogey-free opening round at The Players Champi
onship and in so doing received at least double the airtime
that Woods did. In his Trim Spa logo polo, ESPN focused
in on Daly admiring the placement of his 289-yard, two
iron tee shot on the 18th while sucking down a smooth
Marlboro Unfiltered.
Fresh off a Buick Open win that marked Daly's first
PGA victory in nine years, Daly's career is seeming to take
a turn. He has risen to ninth on the tour earnings list, and
has shot below 70 in the opening round of every event this
spring. And while tour officials may have been influential
in shaping Daly's mullet, which rivaled that of the 1993 Na
tional League Champion Philadelphia Phillies, most no
tably Pete Incivilia, into a more conservative golden trim,
they can't control the comeback this athlete is poised to
make. Woods losing? Daly surging on something other
than a cflse of Miller High Life? C'mon. But, hey, that's
why they play the game.
Don't tell me that baseball hasn't been madness in the
offseason, with the Angels flipping switches and making
moves big enough to land them atop the American League
once again this season under the radar of the Boston and
New York blitzkrieg. First there was Schilling to the Sox,
then Brown to the Yanks. Then there was Foulke to the
Sox, then Vazquez, Sheffield and Lofton to the Yanks.
Then there was Pokey Reese pulled in to thug it in Boston.
And of course, the A-Rod saga that left Boston and New

York fans paralyzed.
But then, the Sox made the ultimate move, Theo Ep
stein brought in the ultimate ringer: Jesus Damon. Don't
fora minute think this is the same man patrolling center
field as last year. No. The Sox have systematically replaced
Johnny Damon, with the Jesus version: flowing, untamed,
shoulder-length Savior Supercut, wild, weathered beard
and all. Pulled outta the sandals and stuffed into a pair of
Zoom Air spikes, name a better player to patrol the awk
wardly angular Fenway outfield. I haven't seen Kenny
Lofton walk on water the past few seasons.
And we've heard the news stories, the reviews, the pre
dictions, the critiques and comparisons of both teams,
which will be there when it all ends next October. But
March, ah March, and spring, the season to get after it. To
pit the dream lineups and pitching rotations against one an
other and let the diamond gladiators duke it out for the
next seven months. To write off the journalists for the ulti
mate prize in winning Game 7 of the ALCS: pure, unadul
terated joy.
There's something to be learned here from sports, a
message that threads these March Madness stories togeth
er, Stanfordians. We've seen the application catalogs full of
sunny pictures, fountains and blossoming trees, and we've
read about the weather and the laidback California
lifestyle since Pro Fro weekend. Well, now it's time to let it
all play out in the real world. It's time to get out of that li
brary. that computer cluster, quit that campus job and hit
the driving range. It's time to experience, but not through
some jpeg of Wilbur Field from an iMac in Meyer Library.
The computer's not going to float the pollen into your eyes,
lay the sun rays down on your back, crunch the grass under
your toes, raise the spirits in your chest or widen the grin on
your face. It's spring and it's time to do it big.
