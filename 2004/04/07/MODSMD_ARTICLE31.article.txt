Cycling
During the last weekend of spring break, the Stanford
cycling team took second place in the notoriously chal
lenging UC-Santa Cruz Road Race. For its efforts, the
team secured a total of seven top-10 finishes in the event, squeez
ing out powerhouse teams from California and UCLA and coming
in second only to the host school, UC-Santa Cruz.
Graduate student Ashley Fouts showed her hill-course domi
nance, finishing a close second in the women's A road race and won
the hill-climb time trial by almost a minute and a half. New team
member Sheela Singla leaped ahead in the last lap of her race to
win the women's B road race.
The Cardinal finished second in both the team time trial
and the road race events in its most recent competition,
which took place last weekend in Berkeley. This time, the top
performances came from Mary Haw and Amber Rais (first
and fourth, respectively, in the women's B road race), Ueyn
Block (second in the men's B road race and first in the men's
B criterium), Chris Montague-Breakwell (fourth in the
men's A road race) and Tyler Hester (fourth in the men's A
criterium).
In the coming weeks, the road team will compete in Reno,
Stanford and at Cal Poly in hopes of securing a team invita
tion to the National Collegiate Cycling Championships in
Madison, Wise,, in May.

The mountain bike team, which races in the fall, is cur
rently recruiting new members. Interested students — grad
uate and undergraduate — should contact mountain bike
captain Rafer Willenberg at raferw@stanford.edu.
Women's Rugby
Last weekend Stanford hosted the Pacific Coast Regional
Playoffs on campus. After last year's unbeaten season, the
Cardinal women were firm favorites heading into the event.
Their first challenge was Reed College on Saturday, and
after a slow start in the first half, the women stayed true to
form with an aggressive second half that secured a solid 33-
0 win. Then on Sunday, against No. 2 Chico State, Stanford
hit hard early with a try in the first few minutes of play and
dominated the whole game to win, 66-3.
The victories put the Cardinal at No. 1 on the Pacific
Coast and No. 5 in the country heading into the Sweet 16 Na
tional Tournament at Penn State on April 17th.
Running
Medical student Megan Daly competed in the U.S.
Olympic Trials Marathon in St. Louis last weekend, being
seeded 137 th out of the registered athletes. After starting off
faster than expected — running the first 13.1 mil6s in 1:22:14
— Daly experienced some trouble in the last six miles. How
ever, she managed to finish the course with a time of 2:48:19
— 26 seconds short of her personal record from last Octo
ber. She placed 53rd out of the 107 finishers (128 starters),
much higher than her original seedinggym. My time is con
strained enough as it is.
