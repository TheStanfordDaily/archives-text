### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's lacrosse team took a heating on its own turf last Thurs
day, falling to Notre Dame de Namur. 25-4. The lopsided loss drops the un
ranked Cardinal to 4-6 overall.
As it has been all season, the team was plagued by injuries to its veteran de
fensive line. Seniors Matt Twomey (back), Ben Spohn (knee) and sophomore
Brian Goodman (foot) were all forced to the sideline on Thursday because of
their injuries.
With senior K.C. Lukens as the only regular defenseman left to play, the
team was forced to dress several inexperienced players to take over on defense.
The Argonauts took advantage of the Cardinal's inexperience, lighting up
the first period with five early goals on fourteen shots. Senior midfielder David
Simpson finally put the Cardinal on the board with six seconds remaining in the
first period.
The second period went much like the first, with Notre Dame scoring eight
goals and taking a 13-2 lead into halftime. The Argonauts were led by standout
Marc Mackrides, who scored four of his six goals in the second period. More re
markably, Notre Dame scored five of its eight second-period goals in the last
1:35 of the period.
"Having Spohn and Goodman injured took two of our best players out of
the game," said senior attacker Beau Lewis. "Notre Dame's potent offense was

able to capitalize off of this for most of the game, despite the solid play of Zell
in goal."
The Cardinal was held to just one shot during the entire third period as the
Argonauts added six goals of their own to bring the score to 19-2. Despite two
early fourth-period goals by sophomore midfielder Tyler Gutierrez, the Cardi
nal never could slow the Notre Dame attack.
Sophomore goalie Michael Zell accumulated 10 saves, but the Cardinal de
fense was unable to stop the Argonauts scoring attack. Notre Dame took 50
shots in the game against the Cardinal's dismal 17. The Argonauts also domi
nated faceoffs, taking 20 of 30 from the Cardinal.
The Cardinal has now been outscored 94-79 by its opponents this season,
and it is clear that injuries to the defense have been and continue to be the
team's sore point.
With two games remaining in the regular season before the WCLL playoffs,
the squad has plenty of work ahead. The Cardinal's next game comes in Sono
ma against No. 4 Sonoma State, which leads the WCLL North with a 10-2 over
all record. A win over Sonoma State would give the Cardinal just the boost it
needs heading into the end of the season.
"Our game against Sonoma State is important because we'll likely face them
again in the playoffs," Gutierrez said. "We are in need of a strong showing to
really turn things around and head into the playoffs with some intensity."
After its game against Sonoma, the Cardinal will wrap up the regular sea
son, facing off against rival California.
