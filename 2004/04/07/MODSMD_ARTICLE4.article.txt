### CHRIS NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford Overseas Studies Program's center in
Beijing continues to take shape, with the announcement
of the appointment of Jason D. Patent as the inaugural
director of Stanford-in-Beijing.
In November of last year, the OSP announced the
opening of the Stanford center at Peking University,
after results of a survey showed that students wanted an
OSP center in China. Students will be able to attend
Stanford's Beijing program beginning in fall of this year.
Patent will move his family to Beijing on Aug. 1.
"He absolutely stood out [from the applicant pool
of 30 to 40 people]. The things that I found especial
ly attractive were that he went to Harvard Universi
ty, Stanford and UC-Berkeley; his areas of interest in
academia are right on the money: he is fluent in Chi
nese and lived in China," said Geophysics Prof. Amos
Nur, director of the Overseas Studies Program. "He
was by far. the best candidate."
Patent earned his bachelor's at Harvard in East
Asian studies, his master's at Stanford in East Asian
studies and his doctorate at UC-Berkeley in linguistics.
Raised in Missoula, Mont.. Patent said he became
fascinated with the Chinese language during childhood

trips to San Francisco. He also said his "odd family back
ground" also contributed to his interest in China.
Despite a lack of Chinese ancestry, his father was
born in Hong Kong and raised in Shanghai from 1939 to
1950. Patent's paternal grandparents were two stateless
Jews, his grandfather from Russia and his grandmother
from Iraq.
Patent lived in Qiqihar in the northeastern province
of Heilongjiang from 1991 to 1992. From 1992 to 1993,
he resided in Guangdong province's capital.
Guangzhou, located 80 miles northwest of Hong Kong.
Patent was in Beijing from 1997 to 1998. He spent the
first ten months of 2002 in Chengdu, the capital of
Sichuan province.
Patent said he thought one of the most rewarding
things about living in China was "making human con
nections, and finding the common human thread, de
spite vast cultural differences; and learning about myself
and my culture and country through the experience of
something so different."
In 1998. 1999 and 2000, Patent took groups of
high school students on what he described as "study
trips on backroad adventures" in rural China during
the summer.
"The company [sponsoring the study trips] had
contacted the Center for East Asian Studies here at

Stanford, where my wife, Colette Plum, and I had
been master's students," he said. "We led our first
trip in 1998, and were hooked. It's amazing to watch
the kids grow before your eyes. They show up in L. A.
excited, but a bit pampered and self-doubting, and
they leave, six weeks later, ready to take on the
world. And it was also rewarding to share my love of
China with them, and to see some amazing places, es
pecially peripheral Tibet."
In addition to leading high school students through
China. Patent also taught linguistics and Chinese lan
guage classes at UC-Berkeley. Although his first en
counter was a Chinese language class was during his
sophomore year at Harvard, he said he did not really
achieve fluency until he lived in China and solidified his
skill with the language while pursuing his master's at
Stanford in 1993-1994.
Patent said that although he looked forward to re
turning to China in August, he had mixed feelings be
cause he and his family have lived in San Francisco for
ten years.
"It's agonizing to uproot ourselves like this. At the
same time, it's a fantastic opportunity for my family," he
said. "Colette is a 'China hand' like me, plus we adopt
ed our daughter from China, so it will be wonderful for
her to be bilingual and bicultural in this way. We plan to

find an apartment with nice guest quarters so friends
and family can visit and stay for awhile."
During the search fora director of the Beijing center,
Nur said that the OSP sought "somebody who is acade
mically-qualified. has academically-relevant experience
with China, some experience that's relevant to being the
director, energy to work hard with students, the kind of
personality that is open and positive as students are con
cerned and innovate enough to think of things like field
work, internships and bringing interesting faculty, lining
up interesting speakers."
Nur added that overseas center directors should en
sure that every student has a life-changing experience
when studying abroad. Patent echoed these sentiments.
"I want to build a program that students walk away
from with their minds blown. 1 want students to emerge
with a deepened love of and respect for China â€” the so
ciety. the culture, the language," Patent said. "I hope
students will be motivated to come back to China again
and again and make careers out of understanding China
and passing on this understanding to others."
He has already begun visiting Stanford classes to en
courage students to study in Beijing.
"Any of you reading this and considering signing up,
sign up!" he said. "What an opportunity, to be one of the
first group of students to study at OSP Beijing."
