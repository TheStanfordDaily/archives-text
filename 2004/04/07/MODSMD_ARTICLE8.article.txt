Today around 40 companies and 1,000 members of
the Stanford community will gather at the Arrillaga
Alumni Center for an exhibition of innovative prod
ucts and technology at the Cool Products Expo.
The event, held from 3 to 7 p.m., is intended to ex
pose attendees to unique products and companies in
the area of manufacturing and design. Presenters will
include a range of companies from emerging start-ups
to eminent manufacturers such as Toyota, Ford, Intel,
Boeing and Logitech. In addition, Stanford will fea
ture some of its University lab projects.
"The Expo has a dual purpose â€” to celebrate great
design in the area, and things happening on campus
and also to foster relationships between students and
the companies," said Jeremy Porter, president of the

Graduate School of Business' Manufacturing and De
sign Club and organizer of the expo.
Porter explained that the event started three or
four years ago when a student from the School of
Business came up with the idea to get business stu
dents in contact with area companies and products.
Porter said that the event now serves as a way for stu
dents to become familiarized with and recruited by
start-up companies and also by established companies.
In fact, students from the School of Business are re
sponsible for going out and inviting many of the com
panies that will be part of the expo.
"Anytime we can bring leaders of industry to Stan
ford, it provides a great opportunity to motivate and
'turn on' our student body to the challenges of tomor
row," said Bryan Gregory, a business student and vice
president of the Manufacturing and Design Club.
"The event is an incredible opportunity for the top

creative minds in industry to mingle with and show off
their creations to tomorrow's talent. Not to mention,
it's just plain fun."
One of the expo's main objectives is to try to dis
play a very diverse number of groups and products.
Last year the expo included a Stanford research
project that featured robotic cockroaches, a product
that Porter said was exciting and which he thought
highlighted the event. A technology that Porter said
he looks forward to in this year's event is artificial
limb technology, which will be brought in by a mem
ber of the local area Veteran Hospital.
"We hope to not only get the creative juices of our
business and engineering students flowing, but to show
all attendees the power of a great idea," Gregory said.
"With the Walmarts of the world dominating the
business landscape by beating everyone on costs, it
seems pretty clear that product differentiation and in

novation is a key way for entrepreneurs to show their
value to customers," Gregory said. "The expo hits at
the heart of that idea."
The event is sponsored by the School of Business'
Alliance for Innovative Manufacturing and the Man
ufacturing and Design Club.
