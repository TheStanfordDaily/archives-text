# Campus rocked by election misconduct
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
The ASSU presidential election has
stirred up controversy, as the ASSU Elections
Commission now claims that numerous peo
ple have violated campaign rules since voting
began at midnight on April 6. Although the
campaign practice code stipulates that cam
paigning must end at the start of voting, sev
eral mass e-mails have been sent endorsing
certain candidates and disparaging others.
At 1 a.m. on April 7, the Senior Class
presidents sent an e-mail to the entire senior
class endorsing the Lee-Mefford slate. At
1:18 a.m. on the same day, the Junior Class
presidents sent an e-mail to the entire junior
class also endorsing the Lee-Mefford slate.
Shortly after these e-mails were sent,
the ASSU Elections Commission re
quested that the Junior and Senior Class
presidents send another statement to
their class lists instructing them to disre
gard their previous endorsement e-mails.
The commission's e-mail reads, in part,
"No students or student groups can send
e-mails out to lists with endorsements of
specific candidates because such students
as the Class presidents who have access to
such a large e-mail list could sway the elec
tion and create an unfair bias."
Less than an hour after their initial e
mail, the Junior Class presidents forward
ed the commission's statement to the ju
nior class along with an apology that
claimed they were unaware that their e
mail violated the campaign practice code.
However, ASSU Assistant Elections
Commissioner Alida Garcia, a junior,
claimed that the Senior Class presidents
were more reluctant to send out an e-mail
retracting their statement because they
felt it did not violate the election rules.
They finally sent a retraction at 5:37 p.m.
Although e-mails asking people to

vote are allowed, endorsements for spe
cific candidates are banned after voting
begins, according to Garcia.
"The ASSU Elections Commission
has the right to interpret violations," Gar
cia said. "Our role is to make this a fair
process All candidates should feel they
are on a fair playing field and there are no
problems after the election with candi
dates contesting results."
Garcia expressed concern that both e
mails had already done too much damage,
especially in the case of the senior class
because the presidents waited so long to
issue a retraction.
Junior Class President Valerie Rozyc
ki said that some of the class presidents
were unaware of the initial endorsement
e-mail and were not unanimous in their
support of the Lee-Mefford slate. She
also predicted that the e-mail would not
seriously impact election results.
"I believe the slates are just as strong
as they were before," Rozycki said. "My
speculation is that any students upset by
e-mails sent from any of the slates now
have stronger conviction in their former
voting preferences. 1 don't think this has
much influence over undecided voters."
In addition to the endorsements sent
by the Junior and Senior Class presi
dents, Lee sent individual campaign e
mails to hundreds of recipients midday
yesterday.
"It was a violation, but you can under
stand how there would be room for mis
understanding," said ASSU Elections
Commissioner Ellie Martin, a junior.
In reaction to the Lee-Mefford en
dorsements, an anonymous e-mail was
sent to the Diaspora list yesterday, pro
moting the Husbands-Schwartz slate.
Martin and Garcia agree that this letter was
in clear violation of campaign conduct code.
Vice-presidential candidate Alyssa

Schwartz, a sophomore, said that the e-mails
have already caused irreparable damage.
"I don't know whom it will affect, but I
don't see how this can't affect the election
results," she said.
Schwartz also expressed personal disap
pointment over what she felt was a smear
campaign on the part of her opponents.
"We tried as hard as we could to run a
clean campaign," Schwartz said. "We told
those campaigning for us not to violate the
election policies. These were direct violations
of something we all signed when we chose to
run ... I am hurt by [the Lee-Mefford slate's]
decision to be negative in their campaign ma
terial toward other candidates."
Presidential candidate Mikey Lee, a se
nior, acknowledged that the e-mails would
probably have an effect on the final results.
"I severely regret all of these e-mails,"
Lee said. "This is in no way what I wanted for
the student body. It's frustrating because this
goes against the main reason why we are run
ning which is to improve the image of the
ASSU and to create a stronger community."
He also apologized for the repercus
sions of the endorsement e-mails.
"While I unfortunately assume this will
affect the outcome of the election, after
speaking to Alyssa, we made it clear to each
other that as candidates, we simply have the
best interest of the ASSU in mind, and hope
that whatever happens, both slates will be
willing to improve the reputation of the
ASSU, represent all communities' concerns
and try to work to improve our own weak
nesses. I think both of us believe that this
can happen."
Presidential candidate Matthew Henick, a
junior, although not mentioned in any of the
e-mails in either a positive or negative light,
said, "Charlie [Stockman] and I will be hold
ing a hunger strike in White Plaza for the rest
of the week, and we invite all those affected by
this tragedy to join us and light a candle."
