# Attention DeficitHype Hyperactive Disorder
## 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Ritalin has become a common word
tossed around in schools. Used to treat
Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disor
der, ADHD, its widespread use is evi
dence of the large number of American
children presently diagnosed with
ADHD. Yet some question whether
there exists an over-diagnosis of ADHD
— and subsequent over-prescription of
drugs to treat the disorder. As a result,
ADHD has become one of the more
well-known and controversial topics in
the psychiatric field today. Yet even with
the increased amount of scrutiny devoted
to ADHD in schools and in the media,
misunderstandings about the mental dis
order abound.
Clinicians once used the term "Atten
tion Deficit Disorder," or ADD, to de
scribe the behavior of inattentiveness, hy
peractivity and impulsivity that charac
terizes the condition, and the name re
mains in popular use. However, the term
that is currently accepted by the Ameri
can Psychiatric Association is "ADHD,"
which serves as a blanket term to describe
the four different types of the disorder —
the predominantly inattentive type, the
predominantly hyperactive / impulsive
type, the combined type and the not oth
erwise specified, or NOS, type.
Laurel Weeks, a learning strategies
coordinator at the Office of Accessi
ble Education, explained that just as
hyperactivity does not denote having
ADHD, having ADHD does not in
clude being hyperactive.
"Unfortunately. 1 suspect that the peo
ple who are not hyperactive tend not to be
identified as [quickly] because they're less
noticeable," she said. "If you have an ele
mentary school classroom where one
child is daydreaming and the other one is
perpetually active, which one do you
think the teacher is going to notice first?"

Dr. Shashank Joshi, director of the
ADHD / Disruptive Behaviors Clinic
confirmed that some people with the inat
tentive type of ADHD often to go undi
agnosed for years.
"One of the tragedies... is that girls
who are usually diagnosed with the inat
tentive type [later on in life] often go un
detected until middle school," he said.
Abuse of medical system for an
educational edge?
While some groups, such as young
girls, may not be receiving the proper
diagnoses, there is controversy over the
fact that others may be diagnosed as
having ADHD without meeting the
sufficient criteria. The fact that approx
imately five percent of school-aged
children, or about one child per class
room, is diagnosed with ADHD in the

United States is sometimes cited as
evidence for the possible over-di
agnosis of ADHD in this country.
Many believe that this compar
atively high number of cases com
pared to other countries is due to
students seeking out the diagnosis
themselves. One of the incentives to
do so is that The College Board gives
students with certain learning dis
abilities the option to take tests such
as the SAT with an extended
amount of time. Yet, contrary to
popular belief, having ADHD is not
sufficient in and of itself to claim
extra time on tests.
"Although ADHD is often re
ferred to in the popular press as a
learning disability, these are actually
two separate diagnoses," Weeks
said. "They can occur together, but
not always."
Still, the Herald (Monterey,
Calif.) has reported that there con
tinues to be a dramatic rise in stu
dents who are using ADHD and
related disabilities to claim extra
time on standardized tests.
Freshman Natasha Dar said
that she knew a student in high
school who convinced his doctor
that he had ADHD so that he could
have extended time on the SATs.
"He might have had [ADHD]
before, but he and his parents didn't
think that it was a big issue until the
SATs," she said. "A few of my
friends were kind of frustrated and
outraged by that. Being diagnosed
with [ADHD] — and not even nec-

essarily using the medication — seems to
be one of those things that people could
abuse if they wanted to."
Influence of pharmaceutical giants
The greater number of diagnoses of
ADHD in recent years may not only be
a factor of increased awareness and de
mand on the part of patients.
"It's very much a complex issue,"
Joshi said. "I think that primary care
doctors are trained to look for [ADHD]
more in the United States The trend in
American psychiatry has been that as
knowledge increases and better treat
ments become available, medical
providers are more likely to diagnose
the disorders."
Part of this tendency to diagnose
what is well known also comes from

pharmaceutical companies, who spend
approximately $13,000 per U.S. physi
cian to advertise and promote their
product, according to Joshi.
"We as physicians, along with the
general public, are bombarded with ad
vertising from pharmaceutical compa
nies about medicinal products. The
more familiar one is with a product, the
more one is likely to use it,"he said.
A legitimate disorder?
Related to the debate about whether
ADHD is being appropriately diagnosed
are questions about whether the disorder
has testable and solid medical founda
tions. Some believe much of the criteria
to evaluate individuals could be miscon
strued, or could be seen as subjective. Yet
there is a specific definition of ADHD in
the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV.
One Stanford student, freshman Jack
ie Bernstein, has found that many people
are relatively uniformed about the disor
der, reiterating the idea that there are
many misconceptions about ADHD.
"I have found quite a few people
who responded to my having a disabili
ty in the manner of "but you're smart
and you do well in school. You can't
have ADHD,' " Bernstein said.
"I have found many people, in partic
ular those who are a generation or
so older than me, to assume that I am ei
ther trying to game the system by having
a "disability" or that I am simply not as
intelligent as my peers. Of course, nei
ther one of these assumptions is true,"
she added.
Additionally, one of the misconcep
tions about ADHD is that it only occurs
in children or in adolescents, and that it
can be "outgrown" over time.
But according to the National In
stitute of Mental Health, "half of all
children with ADHD will still show
signs of the problem into adulthood,
[although] we also know that the
medications and therapy that help
children also work for adults."
Use and abuse of drug therapy
Further research is now discovering
that ADHD is determined by neurobio
logical and environmental conditions. It
is now commonly believed that an imbal
ance of the neurotransmitters nore
pinephrine and dopamine may have a
critical factor in contributing to the ex
pression of the disorder.
Much of the medicinal treatment of
ADHD, such as the methylphenidate
drug Ritalin and the amphetamine
drug Adderal, specifically target these
neurotransmitters. Because Ritalin is
often prescribed to children and
teenagers, and thus it is easily accessi
ble, it has become a popular recre
ational drug. In fact, the Drug Enforce
ment Administration has listed it as
one of the top 10 controlled drugs most
frequently reported as stolen. Kids sell
it at schools or on the streets, calling it
"Vitamin R" or "R-Ball."
The question then becomes, why is Ri
talin abused? According to emergency
room physician Jeffrey Bernstein, M.D.,
"In teenagers and adults, it acts more like
speed... and people who take it continu
ously fora long time have hallucinations."
The problem is nothing new, however,
as Bernstein writes in the popular Web
site http://www.webmd.com, "[Ritalin
abuse] is not a new phenomenon. This
has been going around at least since
the '605."
