# Sex, love and rock n' roll
## Sluts, prudes and finding some middle ground 
### VINNI INTERSIMONE SEX COLUMNIST 
Society divides people into "sluts" and "prudes." Ac
cording to these labels, sluts elicit sex from even the lowest
echelons of society, allowing any vermin into their beds,
while prudes reject the solicitation of even the most attrac
tive people, defending their bedroom against any and all in
truders. Sluts are deemed dirty, prudes are branded boring
and sex is a tricky topic to chat about without being ban
ished to either extreme.
But seriously, folks, people are not either sluts or prudes,
but fall somewhere between the obsession with and rejec
tion of sex. The terms "slut" and "prude" are often used to
describe an individual, but they really act more as insults.
These terms are so thickly wrapped in negative connota
tions that they are rendered useless in seriously describing
anyone. Consensual sex is both one of humanity's most sub
lime activities as well as one of its most complicated rituals.
Choosing whether or not to engage in sex is a choice where
both options are perfectly justifiable.
I went behind the stereotypes and chatted with two stu
dents who could be branded by these types of terms.
"Susie" describes herself as "sexually liberated,"' while
"Carl," describes himself as "sexually conservative." These
individuals — who chose to remain anonymous —fall
more toward the extreme levels of comfort and interest re

garding sex, offering contrasting opinions that reveal what
people really think about sex.
Susie: Sexually active and proud of it
"I like sex a 10t... 1 think that it's important," Susie said.
"I feel like being comfortable with sex is an expression of
confidence with myself because I feel comfortable with all
the parts of who I am, including my sexual actions."
For Susie,Avho has had a total of two sex partners, sex
has two distinct purposes. She views sex as both an "ex
pression between partners in a relationship, [as well as] a re
ally fun past time for consenting individuals. I treat sex as
one of my social needs. You need all sorts of friends... the
need fora sex partner is just the same," she said.
Sex to Susie is both a form of entertainment and a
form of communication, but it is a complicated action
that, even for someone as comfortable with sex as Susie,
needs to be contained. Sex isn't something that she takes
lightly — she enjoys it, but makes sure that she feels
comfortable in each sexual encounter.
"I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, but it's very
important that I keep it in the context of respecting myself
Susie said. "It's really important for me that it's in a situa
tion where I'm respected and feel comfortable; then I think
a lot of sex is a good thing."

Carl: Not quite ready for the act
Carl views sex differently than Susie, seeing it as part of
a "pretty serious commitment and [one that] I'm not neces
sarily wanting to make."
Carl says he is "sort of, sort of not [comfortable with sex]
"I think by upbringing, it's definitely a taboo kind of
issue [for me]... but it's not necessarily something that I'm
against and it's not necessarily something I'm seeking,"
Carl said.
"Even though I'm a virgin, sex is definitely still a part of
my life, but definitely more in the abstract," said Carl. "I
think sex is a part of everyone's life, [whether he or she is a]
virgin or not, because sexual desires play a part in the way
you relate to people. Even if you're not planning on having
sex, you're still interested in people, you're still attracted to
them, you just don't necessarily act on these desires."
Rather than viewing the absence of sex in his life as a
negative circumstance. Carl views the situation in a positive
light, noting that it gives him more time to do things he'd
rather be doing.
"I think I spend less time thinking about [and pursuing]
sexual activities," he said. "It seems there's a predominant
place for sex in college life and it's not necessarily a bad
thing, but there are other things to do with your time."

Where the two converge: Stanford's lack of dating scene
Interestingly enough, despite their differing levels of se
curity regarding sex, both Carl and Susie are insecure about
dating, a sentiment generally felt at Stanford.
"I don't feel comfortable asking a person out on a date."
Susie said. "It's pathetic, but that's the truth. It's like a self
perpetuating cycle at Stanford: The social norms include
being drunk and anonymously hooking up on the dance
floor, so it's really hard to break those norms."
Carl added that the fact that frat parties were Stanford's
primary social scene may contribute to the lack of dating.
"I'm definitely not expecting to find someone special at
a frat party [where] it's hard to meet people in a construc
tive way," he said. "You can dance with people, but not re
ally talk to them."
To both, sex is a powerful activity that must be dealt with
carefully. The main and perhaps only difference between
the two individuals is that Susie believes herself to be ready
to deal with sex, while Carl does not. Looking more closely
at individuals whose beliefs and actions might elicit the title
"prude" or "slut" shows how empty these words really are.
