## An election gone wrong 
### 
Nearly every Stanford student received one
or more illegal e-mails yesterday related
to the ASSU executive election. The
ASSU elections commission is working
today to determine the extent to which the e-mails
might have affected voters. As of press time, the com
mission seemed to be leaning toward going through
with the election despite the numerous violations of
campaign and University rules. Then, after the results
are announced, they could potentially be appealed or
overturned. More likely, they would simply be tainted
in some people's minds.
We believe that it would be a mistake to go through
with the election at this point. Many people voted yes
terday, before information was available about the ex
tent of campaign violations. These voters thought the
campaign was over, and might have voted differently
had they known that some candidates would go on to
violate the rules by continuing to campaign past the
official deadline. Many others will vote today, at a
time when rumors and accusations are flying about
who violated what rule and why. Their votes may be
affected by misinformation about who is at fault for
the violations. This inconsistency is not fair to the vot
ers or to the candidates.
Worse, if the election results are announced and
then later overturned, any re-vote will be hopelessly
compromised. We urge the elections commission not
to announce the results of the presidential race until or
unless an investigation determines that there are not
grounds to disqualify any of the candidates. But even
if the violations were largely unintentional, as seems
to be the case, we encourage the commission to inval
idate this week's executive election on the grounds
that voters have surely been swayed by last-minute
endorsements, e-mails and allegations that were never

supposed to happen. A new election should be held
after enough time has passed for voters to learn what
transpired and who was to blame.
It is not in students' interest to have an ASSU pres
ident and vice president who won election by bending
or breaking the rules of the campaing. To have ASSU
executives who won because of unfounded suspicions
about their opponents would be equally unfortunate.
ASSU elections commissioner Alida Garcia con
ceded that she had heard from voters who said they
would have voted differently had they known about
the violations. But she implied that she thought the
election could still be valid, because it was not clear
which slate had been hurt more by the e-mails. Indeed,
e-mails were sent out on behalf of both the Lee-Mef
ford campaign and the Husbands-Schwartz campaign,
and in each case an embarrassing retraction followed.
At this point, it may be the case that both slates suf
fered equally, on balance.
But that is purely speculative, and it is not a good
reason to go through with the election. What hap
pened was equivalent to a mistrial. The voters should
have a chance to make their decisions again once all
the facts are known and emotions have died down.
In case the elections commission does go through
with the election, we encourage voters today to try to
choose based on the merits of the candidates' plat
forms, not based on yesterday's controversy. At this
point, it does not appear that any of the candidates
acted dishonestly or with the intention of breaking the
rules. Thus, if the elections commission does announce
the results as planned on Friday afternoon, we hope
that the candidates and the students accept the out
come and move on. For the sake of the ASSU, the can
didates and the student body, the election needs to ei
ther be stopped now, or carried through and validated.
