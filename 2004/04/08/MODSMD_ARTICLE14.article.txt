# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Does Athalie rhyme with apathy? 
### 
I have to confess that I have not
voted in the ASSU election
since my freshman year when
the online ballot system, in
comparison to high school's pen
and-paper voting, seemed too excit
ing to pass up. Even then, I hardly
considered voting to he a serious
task. Instead, I relied on the "eeny
meeny-miny-moe" chant to make
my choices.
The truth is that student politics
just don't interest me. No one is
going to turn Tresidder Union into a
multi-level night club, the food at
Stern is not going to get any better
and the school is never going to
agree to place king-sized water beds
in all undergraduate dorm rooms.
What I really want is for the un
dergraduate senate to debate the
declining social life on campus or to
challenge the Office of Residential
Education to guarantee everyone a
single and a private bathroom.
If I were to run for president of
the student body I would bring up is
sues like making campus-wide park
ing permits or having the Mar
guerite run twenty-four hours a day.
My flyers would be different shades
of pink and instead of invasively
posting them inside bathroom stalls
where most people prefer to be left
alone, I would paste them to desks

in lecture halls so as to provide en
tertainment where it is needed the
most.
I would run MTV-style ads on

SCBN and con
tract my friends
to be my "video
hos" reminding
everyone to vote
for me. In place
of wasting ad
space bragging
about how many
facebook friends
I had, I would be

sure to tell people what they wanted
to hear, even if it meant promising
weekly Friday holidays and a ban on
morning classes. And I definitely
wouldn't have a slogan involving
some hokey wordplay on my last
name.
In my fantasy world as president,
Stanford would not only be its own
city, but its own country as well with
its very own postal service, currency
and police force. That way mail
would be delivered on time without
any mix-ups, coffee would cost the
equivalent of five cents and bikers
would not get stopped for running
stop signs or ticketed for not being
properly registered.
By the time I was done with my
term as president, Stanford would

be a very different place. Applicant
rates would skyrocket, U.S. News
and World Report would perma
nently list us at number one (leaving
Princeton and Harvard to fight over
number-two status), and of course
men's basketball would make it to
the Final Four.
Sadly, however, I will not be run
ning for president this year, and so
for now things look like they will be
staying the same around here. With
this election, it looks like the best we
can hope for are a few more "Abso
lute Fun" events, class-sponsored
nights at the Treehouse and the
CoHo, and a whole lot of special
fees for groups we still know noth
ing about.
As for me, I haven't made up my
mind about whether or not I will be
voting this time around. After all,
I'm over the novelty of the online
ballot, and with no one running
against the "Senior High School"
slate for senior class president, my
vote is hardly necessary.
Even if the end of election season
marks the end of free Krispy Kreme
donuts in White Plaza, I am more
than happy for it all to be over.
