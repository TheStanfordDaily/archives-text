## Feats of stupidity 
### 
Ahh, spring, that magical
time of year when flow
ers bloom, songbirds
return and the Detroit
Tigers are only twenty games out
of first place. Here at incompara
ble Stanford University it is even
more joyous, a time when seniors
stop caring, classes seem unimpor
tant and an entire new crop of
sorority girls has just arrived.
With these welcome changes,
however, comes great responsi
bility, a chance to make a deci
sion that will profoundly affect
you for the rest of your life, per
haps even the lives of your chil
dren, and your children's chil
dren. Dear readers, I am refer
ring, as I'm sure you all know, to
an unbelievable once-in-a-rat
ings-period opportunity to select
the new American Idol.
Also this week, of infinitely
less importance, are ASSU elec
tions. Now, when I say less im
portant, I don't mean to harp on
the fact that the candidates seem
to be running on similar plat
forms, or that much of the work
of the ASSU seems hidden to the
majority of the student body.
What I mean to say is that I have
a better chance of listing out the
vice ministers for water fluorina
tion for each country in sub-Sa
haran Africa than picking two
different ASSU candidates out of
a line-up.
Without flipping back to the
front page, can you name any
candidate that you don't know
personally? Hint: Al Sharpton
couldn't round up enough signa
tures to get on the ballot.
If you managed to pass step
one, name two policies your can
didate endorses. If you're any
thing like me, you'll be flabber
gasted to learn that neither cam

pus-wide beer pong tournaments
nor compulsory mud wrestling
training for incoming co-eds has

even been
touched upon.
No wonder the
ASSU seems out
of touch with the
student body.
"Sure," you
might be think
ing, "it's easy for
him to sit back at
his columnist's

desk and spew ridicule, but where
are his ideas for constructive
change?" Well, if you're in search of
insight and wisdom that will positive
ly advance the electoral process in
the future. 1 have no idea why you're
reading my column (I'd guess it's the
cute picture they run at the top).
However, if you're looking for
a bunch of ill-conceived attempts
at puerile humor thinly disguised
as a reform agenda, read on!
Suggestion one: Recruit hard
hitting action stars as candidates.
How can we be expected to get
excited about some silly Stanford
undergraduates, when we've al
ready tasted the sweet ambrosia
of having Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger as our governor? Listen, I un
derstand that perhaps ASSU
president isn't as prestigious as
governor of the largest state in
the union. However, I find it hard
to believe that, at the very least,
Gilbert Godfried and Slyvester
Stallone aren't pretty desperate
for some regular work. Let's
make it happen.
Suggestion two: Replace old
fashioned voting with incredible
feats of stupidity
Let's face it - when Winston
Churchill uttered the immortal
words, "Democracy is the worst
form of government except for all

those other that have been tried,"
he obviously hadn't considered
Crisco-slathered cage matches or
bikini alligator wrestling. Sure, if
we elect a candidate by a consid
erable mandate, wg expect he can
probably push his agenda
through the senate. However, if
our candidate wins out by defeat
ing an orangutan in armed com
bat, we damn well know that he's
going to get things done.
Suggestion 3: Replace current,
uninteresting human ASSU with
super-intelligent Chimpanzee
ASSU.
Critics of this proposal might
argue that the ASSU is responsi
ble fora wide variety of impor
tant decisions that affect large
sums of money, as well as the fu
ture of many cherished student
groups - all tasks that are well be
yond the cognitive abilities of
primates. Oh yeah? Well, when
was the last time one of your pre
cious homo sapiens engaged in
public masturbation and / or
feces throwing? Different
strokes for different folks, that's
what I say.
1 realize that many of these
ideas might seem outlandish, or
even very likely criminal. Well,
that may be. 1 will say this
though: If your next ASSU presi
dent was a Hollywood-trained
stunt baboon who won the office
by jousting his spider monkey op
ponent on a rocket trike, you'd
probably be a damn sight more
interested in University politics
than you are today.
