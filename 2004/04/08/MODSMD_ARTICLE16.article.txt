Senior Class Presidents'
endorsement troubling
"Transparency" has been a major
issue in ASSU campaigns for several
years now. Particularly transparent
this year, however, were the attempts
of the Lee-Mefford campaign to en
dorse themselves. Other letters have
questioned whether The Daily
should have endorsed a member of its
own staff. Far more troubling, howev
er, was the senior presidents' use of
the class e-mail list to endorse one of
their members.
I hope that Stanford students are
smart enough to realize the meaning
lessness of such a self-serving en
dorsement. The university provided
the class officers with our contact in
formation to tell us about programs
and events, not so that they could pro
mote their own political careers.
All three slates have pledged that
they will not place the presidency on
their resumes if they do win the elec
tion. Still, only Stockman and Henick
have also pledged to donate their
salaries to the student body. They
represent the least self-interested
slate and the best choice for Stan
ford's future.

Debate ploy shows
candidates' dishonesty
Tuesday night at the ASSU elec
tion debate, the Stockman-Henick
slate made an interesting move. They
signed a pledge to never put their
presidency, if won, on their resumes,
and passed the pledge down the table
for the other candidates to sign.
This should have been a non-issue.
Any serious candidate should have
taken that gesture for what it was — a
joke — and refused to sign. Of
course, any pair who goes through all
the hassle of running and winning an
ASSU campaign and spends a year of
their lives running the ASSU will put
that on their resumes. It would be an
egregious omission if they did not.
Shockingly, however, every single
candidate at the table put his or her
name to the pledge. Both candidates
for president signed with flair, vowing
aloud that they did not want or need

to add such a piddling thing as the
ASSU presidency to their creden
tials. Our cockiest candidate de
clared. "This is the last thing I need on
my resume!"
What are you. man. king of a small
country? I don't know anyone who
wouldn't want to have Stanford Uni
versity ASSU President on their re
sume, and I know for certain that
whoever wins this election will put it
on their resume some day. So what
was all that blustering show about
then? Playing to the crowd. Deceitful,
cowardly, stupid and political playing
to the crowd, in a petty game of one
upmanship gone awry.
It wouldn't have hurt the candi
dates to say, "No, thank you. I will
be proud of the hard work I do this
year, and I would like to include it
on my resume."
But honesty just did not occur to
anyone. Instead of being forthright,
our candidates chose to lie to our
faces. They publicly signed away their
honor for what they thought might
make them look good. I think they
chose poorly. That, combined with
overall mud-slinging, hedging, name
dropping character of the debate,
makes the honestly lighthearted
Chappie slate all the more appealing.
Each slate, ultimately, will do a good
job. Why not elect one that will let us
have fun along the way?

Daily 7 s endorsement unfair
Before reading The Daily's en
dorsement editorial ("ASSU execu
tive election: Choose action over ad
vocacy," March 6), my decision on
whom to vote for was completely up
in the air. Now, however, I am in
clined to support the Husbands-
Schwartz slate because it appears to
me that the editorial wasn't written
fairly and was completely one-sided.
And I don't want the next generation
of Stanford students to have an
ASSU President who goes about get
ting elected by calling on his friends at
The Daily.
Nowhere in the editorial did it
ever mention that Lee is a current
columnist and former editor of The

Daily, which I know to be true
through a little research through the
paper's Web site. Personally, I think
The Daily should stay away from en
dorsing a candidate who actually
works for the paper during a two
slate election. In this case, no en
dorsement would have been a better
strategy from an integrity perspective
in my opinion.
Moreover, if The Daily chooses
to endorse said candidate, the
paper itself should go the extra
length to make sure that all readers
know that Lee does work for the
paper so that we as readers are able
to make a judgment about potential
biases. But there was no mention of
that at all.
I don't know either one of the
candidates personally. They don't
know me, regardless of Lee-Mef
ford's assertion that they know over
500 people at Stanford, which ap
pears to me to be not only factually
incorrect but also ingenuine. 1 don't
care who you are. You can't really
know 500 people, and if you do
"know" them by name, that can't be
too genuine. I would prefer that the
next ASSU president actually cared
about the students — wanting to
know them for reasons outside of
political motivations.
Moreover, as a member of the se
nior class who receives e-mails week
ly from the class presidents, I have
often found them to be completely
unprofessional. There was one par
ticular e-mail (written by Lee) criti
cizing the former editorial's boards
concerns over a missing class presi
dent that appeared to me to be com
pletely hot-headed, overwhelmingly
mean-spirited and definitely unpro
fessional. Needless to say, I don't
think the slate should have been
praised for their communication
styles. Perhaps Lee's "feistiness" is
more of a negative then The Daily
portrays in its editorial.
Because of the editorial, this week
1 will be voting for advocacy, for
"With you, for you," because I would
rather have leaders who care about
the concerns of their constituents
rather than those who take "actions"

dorse themselves. Other letters have
questioned whether The Daily
should have endorsed a member of its
own staff. Far more troubling, howev
er, was the senior presidents' use of
the class e-mail list to endorse one of
their members.
I hope that Stanford students are
smart enough to realize the meaning
lessness of such a self-serving en
dorsement. The university provided
the class officers with our contact in
formation to tell us about programs
and events, not so that they could pro
mote their own political careers.
All three slates have pledged that
they will not place the presidency on
their resumes if they do win the elec
tion. Still, only Stockman and Henick
have also pledged to donate their
salaries to the student body. They
represent the least self-interested
slate and the best choice for Stan
ford's future.

Debate ploy shows
candidates' dishonesty
Tuesday night at the ASSU elec
tion debate, the Stockman-Henick
slate made an interesting move. They
signed a pledge to never put their
presidency, if won, on their resumes,
and passed the pledge down the table
for the other candidates to sign.
This should have been a non-issue.
Any serious candidate should have
taken that gesture for what it was — a
joke — and refused to sign. Of
course, any pair who goes through all
the hassle of running and winning an
ASSU campaign and spends a year of
their lives running the ASSU will put
that on their resumes. It would be an
egregious omission if they did not.
Shockingly, however, every single
candidate at the table put his or her
name to the pledge. Both candidates
for president signed with flair, vowing
aloud that they did not want or need

to add such a piddling thing as the
ASSU presidency to their creden
tials. Our cockiest candidate de
clared. "This is the last thing I need on
my resume!"
What are you. man. king of a small
country? I don't know anyone who
wouldn't want to have Stanford Uni
versity ASSU President on their re
sume, and I know for certain that
whoever wins this election will put it
on their resume some day. So what
was all that blustering show about
then? Playing to the crowd. Deceitful,
cowardly, stupid and political playing
to the crowd, in a petty game of one
upmanship gone awry.
It wouldn't have hurt the candi
dates to say, "No, thank you. I will
be proud of the hard work I do this
year, and I would like to include it
on my resume."
But honesty just did not occur to
anyone. Instead of being forthright,
our candidates chose to lie to our
faces. They publicly signed away their
honor for what they thought might
make them look good. I think they
chose poorly. That, combined with
overall mud-slinging, hedging, name
dropping character of the debate,
makes the honestly lighthearted
Chappie slate all the more appealing.
Each slate, ultimately, will do a good
job. Why not elect one that will let us
have fun along the way?

Daily 7 s endorsement unfair
Before reading The Daily's en
dorsement editorial ("ASSU execu
tive election: Choose action over ad
vocacy," March 6), my decision on
whom to vote for was completely up
in the air. Now, however, I am in
clined to support the Husbands-
Schwartz slate because it appears to
me that the editorial wasn't written
fairly and was completely one-sided.
And I don't want the next generation
of Stanford students to have an
ASSU President who goes about get
ting elected by calling on his friends at
The Daily.
Nowhere in the editorial did it
ever mention that Lee is a current
columnist and former editor of The

Daily, which I know to be true
through a little research through the
paper's Web site. Personally, I think
The Daily should stay away from en
dorsing a candidate who actually
works for the paper during a two
slate election. In this case, no en
dorsement would have been a better
strategy from an integrity perspective
in my opinion.
Moreover, if The Daily chooses
to endorse said candidate, the
paper itself should go the extra
length to make sure that all readers
know that Lee does work for the
paper so that we as readers are able
to make a judgment about potential
biases. But there was no mention of
that at all.
I don't know either one of the
candidates personally. They don't
know me, regardless of Lee-Mef
ford's assertion that they know over
500 people at Stanford, which ap
pears to me to be not only factually
incorrect but also ingenuine. 1 don't
care who you are. You can't really
know 500 people, and if you do
"know" them by name, that can't be
too genuine. I would prefer that the
next ASSU president actually cared
about the students — wanting to
know them for reasons outside of
political motivations.
Moreover, as a member of the se
nior class who receives e-mails week
ly from the class presidents, I have
often found them to be completely
unprofessional. There was one par
ticular e-mail (written by Lee) criti
cizing the former editorial's boards
concerns over a missing class presi
dent that appeared to me to be com
pletely hot-headed, overwhelmingly
mean-spirited and definitely unpro
fessional. Needless to say, I don't
think the slate should have been
praised for their communication
styles. Perhaps Lee's "feistiness" is
more of a negative then The Daily
portrays in its editorial.
Because of the editorial, this week
1 will be voting for advocacy, for
"With you, for you," because I would
rather have leaders who care about
the concerns of their constituents
rather than those who take "actions"
to simply get elected.
