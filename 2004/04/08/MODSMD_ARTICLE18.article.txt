## Reparations to Mormons? 
### 
Imagine that your parents were
tortured, their property and
livelihood stripped from them,
your father shot and your
mother forced to bundle you and
your siblings up in the dead of winter
and flee 1300 miles on foot to safety.
The only food and water for your trip
is what you carry with you or find
along the way.
Your mother eventually finds
safety in a desert after burying half of
her children who didn't survive the
long journey and losing toes and fin
gers to frostbite. She labors all the
rest of her life to squeeze enough to
eat from the desert and to find a slim
fraction of the comfort that she en
joyed in her old life.
If you could have a measure of
justice for these things, what would
you require of your parent's tormen
tors? Would you still want justice if
the wronged persons were not your
parents but grandparents six genera
tions removed and the persecutors
long dead?
In the current climate of righting
past wrongs, where the idea of slavery
reparations — requiring a monetary
penalty from either those who inherit
ed a company or the taxpayers — has
gained traction, the recent apology
and then retraction from the state of
Illinois to the Mormons makes for an
interesting case.
The story begins in 1846, when
20,000 Mormons (or members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, of which I am a member) were
forced by mob violence and complicit
government order from their homes
in Nauvoo, Illinois. Actually, the story
begins somewhat earlier, when the
Mormons settled on this piece of Illi
nois swampland no one else wanted
after another forced migration from
Missouri. The group drained the
swamp, killed the mosquitoes, plant
ed crops and made an enterprising
home for themselves. Nauvoo quickly

grew to be the largest city in Illinois
and the tenth largest city in the coun
try at the time.
Some of their neighbors didn't cot
ton to their religious practices, which
might have been different but were in

no way danger
ous. Maybe more
significantly, the
Mormons voted in
block, and were
therefore a politi
cal force not to be
ignored. When an
ant i -Mormon
newspaper in
Nauvoo was de-

stroyed, Mormon
leader Joseph Smith was jailed with
out a trial and then murdered by a
mob that marched on the prison.
From that point, it was open sea
son on Mormons. Crops and homes
were burned, businesses looted, men
and even children killed. The Mor
mons fled for their lives in the dead of
winter, walking all the way to the
Utah territory. And the rest is distant
history, right?
It was churned up again last week
when an Illinois state Representative
drafted an apology to the Mormons
for the violence. He learned of the vi
olence in Illinois on a recent vacation
to Utah and resolved to do something.
When word spread across the state
of the official apology, Rep. Jack
Franks experienced more resistance
than he bargained for, given this al
most 170 year-old trouble. In the face
of this controversy, Franks retracted
his House resolution that initially
asked for"the pardon and forgive
ness" of Mormons, and redrafted it as
simply a statement of regret. He
amended his resolution, he told re
porters, so as not to offend any of his
fellow Illinois citizens.
Aside from the rich irony of
amending an overdue apology for
murder and theft to avoid giving of

fense, the case begs the question of
the need for way-too-long-after-the
fact apologies and rectification. Does
the apology change any of the past?
Should Illinois go beyond an apology
and offer financial reparations?
Would it be fair for the descendants of
the people who murdered and stole
from the Mormons to pay an adjusted
fraction of damages to the descen
dants of the Mormon victims? Do
these measures heal?
If apologies serve as an official
record of what makes for correct and
incorrect behavior, I'm all for them. A
nation founded on freedom of reli
gion, for instance, should have provid
ed better protections against this kind
of brutal religious discrimination.
But while I think good things stem
from the feeling Franks had after his
trip to Utah — the feeling that one
would like to do something so this
doesn't happen again — I believe his
statement of regret is a misguided
channeling of this feeling. What is
done is done. This statement is just a
gesture and has no real impact on
past suffering.
A better use of Franks' contrition
would be to find and heal victims of
modern-day injustice. Illinois, I'm
sure, has enough victims and suffering
to keep the state legislature busy with
out the ballyhoo surrounding the "of
ficial" apology. Gestures are nice and
plentiful, but real crusaders and pro
tectors are in shortsupply.
The crappy fact of it all is that our
history as a free nation is really messy,
maybe as much as nations that aren't
founded on such high-minded ideolo
gy as you find in our constitution. But
looking back and trying to correct yes
terday's books won't save anyone.
History is a teacher, not grounds for
blackmail.

Imagine that your parents were
tortured, their property and
livelihood stripped from them,
your father shot and your
mother forced to bundle you and
your siblings up in the dead of winter
and flee 1300 miles on foot to safety.
The only food and water for your trip
is what you carry with you or find
along the way.
Your mother eventually finds
safety in a desert after burying half of
her children who didn't survive the
long journey and losing toes and fin
gers to frostbite. She labors all the
rest of her life to squeeze enough to
eat from the desert and to find a slim
fraction of the comfort that she en
joyed in her old life.
If you could have a measure of
justice for these things, what would
you require of your parent's tormen
tors? Would you still want justice if
the wronged persons were not your
parents but grandparents six genera
tions removed and the persecutors
long dead?
In the current climate of righting
past wrongs, where the idea of slavery
reparations — requiring a monetary
penalty from either those who inherit
ed a company or the taxpayers — has
gained traction, the recent apology
and then retraction from the state of
Illinois to the Mormons makes for an
interesting case.
The story begins in 1846, when
20,000 Mormons (or members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints, of which I am a member) were
forced by mob violence and complicit
government order from their homes
in Nauvoo, Illinois. Actually, the story
begins somewhat earlier, when the
Mormons settled on this piece of Illi
nois swampland no one else wanted
after another forced migration from
Missouri. The group drained the
swamp, killed the mosquitoes, plant
ed crops and made an enterprising
home for themselves. Nauvoo quickly

grew to be the largest city in Illinois
and the tenth largest city in the coun
try at the time.
Some of their neighbors didn't cot
ton to their religious practices, which
might have been different but were in

no way danger
ous. Maybe more
significantly, the
Mormons voted in
block, and were
therefore a politi
cal force not to be
ignored. When an
ant i -Mormon
newspaper in
Nauvoo was de-

stroyed, Mormon
leader Joseph Smith was jailed with
out a trial and then murdered by a
mob that marched on the prison.
From that point, it was open sea
son on Mormons. Crops and homes
were burned, businesses looted, men
and even children killed. The Mor
mons fled for their lives in the dead of
winter, walking all the way to the
Utah territory. And the rest is distant
history, right?
It was churned up again last week
when an Illinois state Representative
drafted an apology to the Mormons
for the violence. He learned of the vi
olence in Illinois on a recent vacation
to Utah and resolved to do something.
When word spread across the state
of the official apology, Rep. Jack
Franks experienced more resistance
than he bargained for, given this al
most 170 year-old trouble. In the face
of this controversy, Franks retracted
his House resolution that initially
asked for"the pardon and forgive
ness" of Mormons, and redrafted it as
simply a statement of regret. He
amended his resolution, he told re
porters, so as not to offend any of his
fellow Illinois citizens.
Aside from the rich irony of
amending an overdue apology for
murder and theft to avoid giving of

fense, the case begs the question of
the need for way-too-long-after-the
fact apologies and rectification. Does
the apology change any of the past?
Should Illinois go beyond an apology
and offer financial reparations?
Would it be fair for the descendants of
the people who murdered and stole
from the Mormons to pay an adjusted
fraction of damages to the descen
dants of the Mormon victims? Do
these measures heal?
If apologies serve as an official
record of what makes for correct and
incorrect behavior, I'm all for them. A
nation founded on freedom of reli
gion, for instance, should have provid
ed better protections against this kind
of brutal religious discrimination.
But while I think good things stem
from the feeling Franks had after his
trip to Utah — the feeling that one
would like to do something so this
doesn't happen again — I believe his
statement of regret is a misguided
channeling of this feeling. What is
done is done. This statement is just a
gesture and has no real impact on
past suffering.
A better use of Franks' contrition
would be to find and heal victims of
modern-day injustice. Illinois, I'm
sure, has enough victims and suffering
to keep the state legislature busy with
out the ballyhoo surrounding the "of
ficial" apology. Gestures are nice and
plentiful, but real crusaders and pro
tectors are in shortsupply.
The crappy fact of it all is that our
history as a free nation is really messy,
maybe as much as nations that aren't
founded on such high-minded ideolo
gy as you find in our constitution. But
looking back and trying to correct yes
terday's books won't save anyone.
