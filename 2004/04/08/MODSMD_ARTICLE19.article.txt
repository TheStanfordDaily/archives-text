# ASSU ELECTIONS
## DAILY ENDORSEMENTS ASSU executive election: Choose action over advocacy 
### 
There is a good reason why this year's ASSU
presidential race has not stirred much con
troversy: Either of the two front-running
slates would probably do an adequate job
if elected.
Ajani Husbands and Alyssa Schwartz are knowl
edgeable, personable and very much in touch with the
interests and concerns of the student body. Mikey Lee
and Dylan Mefford have extensive political experi
ence and know how to work with the administration.
Unlike the Chaparral slate — which, to its credit,
brings a refreshing sense of humor to a race that would
otherwise be unusually dull — both Husbands-
Schwartz and Lee-Mefford have taken the campaign
seriously and have done an admirable job putting to
gether coherent platforms.
That's not to say that the two slates are the same,
however. Their respective slogans, silly as they might
sound, accurately capture the main difference between
the candidates. Husbands-Schwartz — "With you, for
you" — focus on inclusiveness and process, while Lee-
Mefford — "Getting stuff done" — are oriented toward
achieving tangible results. While neither viewpoint is
particularly groundbreaking, we endorse Lee-Mefford
because their approach is more likely to bring a spark of
action and excitement to an organization that has histor
ically suffered from stagnation.
There is a basic philosophical difference between
Husbands-Schwartz and Lee-Mefford. Lee and Mef
ford see the ASSU as an organization with the explicit
power to accomplish certain concrete goals, while Hus
bands and Schwartz view it primarily as a forum for
student advocacy on long-term issues. Schwartz was
chair of the Senate Advocacy Committee, and many of
the goals she and Husbands have articulated are advo
cacy projects like pushing for student space, improving
advising and increasing faculty diversity. These are all
admirable goals, and they reflect the wishes of many in
the community. But wishes, even the wishes of the
ASSU president and vice president, are not easily con
verted into results.
Asked what they would accomplish in the first two
months of their term, the slate listed two or three projects
that are already underway thanks to the current
Figueroa-Natoli administration. Their Web site contains
a large list of other issues they plan to work on, many of
them perennial buzzwords like transparency and cost of
living. We believe that Husbands and Schwartz have a
genuine concern about these issues, but so have plenty of
previous administrations that have failed to effect signif
icant change. It is not clear that Husbands and Schwartz
have an understanding of how to translate noble aims
into real progress, or the tenacity to overcome the Uni

versity's powerful bureaucratic inertia.
Nor have Husbands and Schwartz fully articulated
the ramifications of all their promises. For instance, one
of their stated goals is to increase diversity by "mak[ing]
sure the Board of Trustees realize that tuition hikes neg
atively affect students." Surely the Board realizes this,
but they continue to raise tuition in order to offset the ris
ing costs of financial aid to families who are unable to
pay. Even if Husbands and Schwartz were right that in
creases in tuition limit diversity, the ASSU executive
lacks the authority to influence the Board's decisions.
The main problem with the ASSU is not that it fails to
represent student opinion on long-term issues like diver
sity and student space, but that it fails to pursue goals that
are within its power. Lee and Mefford seem to recognize
this. Their proposals are specific, and in most cases they
have already met with University administrators to fig
ure out how to implement them. When they proposed to
create a matching-grants program to sponsor ASSU Ab
solute Fun programs by dormitories, ethnic organiza
tions and other campus groups, they also met with key
administrators to ensure that the policy was feasible and
could quickly be put into effect. Their ability and will
ingness to do such legwork indicates that they will likely
be better equipped to fulfill their campaign promises
than many past ASSU leaders.
Even when there is a particularly skilled and effec
tive executive slate, such as Figueroa-Natoli this year, it
typically struggles to communicate its accomplishments
to the student body at large. We believe Lee and Mef
ford would not only set and meet worthwhile goals, but
also convey them well to their constituents and receive
feedback in return. Lee's current position as a Senior
Class president is quite different from the role of ASSU
president, but his work on the Senior Class Web site
and e-mail list is evidence of a talent for communication
— possibly the most important skill a student leader
can possess.
In contrast to Husbands* easygoing campaign style,
Lee's feistiness makes him less likely to simply uphold
the status quo. It can also be a flaw, but too much pas
sion and conviction is the kind of flaw that the ASSU
could stand to have more of. For his part, Mefford may
turn off some voters with his glad-handing, always-po
litical demeanor, but his knowledge of the ASSU and fa
miliarity with a broad range of campus groups make him
a valuable running mate for Lee. In a way, we wish that
Lee had run with Schwartz, who possesses the same sort
of insider understanding as Mefford but comes across as
more genuine. But second-guessing the composition of
the slates is useless. Of the available options, all have
merits and flaws, but Lee and Mefford are best posi
tioned to make a positive impact on Stanford students.
