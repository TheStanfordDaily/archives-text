### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Early last evening, 11,746 Stan
ford e-mail addresses received an
anonymous e-mail entitled "The
Ugly Side of the ASSU Election."
Sent from a Yahoo! account with
the name "Stanford TRULY edu
cated voter," the e-mail criticized
another e-mail sent to the Diaspora
list in support of the Husbands-
Schwartz slate.
An excerpt from the e-mail
reads, "What we have in this elec
tion are two slates that are both
qualified and committed to simi
lar objectives, but have different
ideas about how to achieve those
objectives. One slate, for exam
ple, decided that negative cam
paigning was a good way to
achieve its own ends . . . don't be
taken in by false campaign ads and
smear tactics."
Editors in chief of The Chapar
ral. Lan Spiro and Steven Yelder
man, both seniors, and current vice
presidential candidate Matthew
Henick, a junior, uncovered the
identity of the sender of the e-mail.
"The reason why we started in
vestigating the origins of the e-mail
was because we were offended that
the Chappie slate was not men
tioned at all," Henick said.
Although some thought that the
e-mail was affiliated with the candi

dates running for the presidential
election, the actual sender was for
mer ASSU Vice President Nick
Rodriguez, a senior.
Henick. Spiro and Yelderman
traced the IP address to a computer

on the second floor
of Meyer and found
the text file with a list
of over 11,000 email
addresses. Though it
appeared the person
who had used the
computer had at
tempted to hide his
actions, the three
were able to find an
electronic trail lead
ing to Nick Ro
driguez's dorm room
computer.
They immediately
informed the ASSU
Elections Commis
sion and Director of
Student Activities

Nanci Howe of their findings.
Several hours later, around 11
p.m., Henick, Spiro and Yelderman
— along with 6 fellow Chaparral
staffers — confronted Rodriguez
in his room.
"We kept hinting at the fact
that we knew he was involved,
hoping that he would either con
fess or otherwise convince us he
had no knowledge of the wrong
doing," Yelderman said. "When

we left his room, there was no
doubt in our mind that he was in
fact guilty."
Although Rodriguez did not
confess in person immediately,
he called The Daily and then

Howe to confess his
sole responsibility
for the e-mail.
Rodriguez empha
sized that the e-mail
was not affiliated with
any of the candidates
and that it was written
of his own volition.
"First I should
make it clear I'm not
affiliated with any
slate," Rodriguez
said. "I know the
ASSU has a mailing
list of every Stanford
student and I saw an
e-mail this morning
favoring the Hus
bands-Schwartz slate in

the same manner that the ASSU
used to send e-mails."
The e-mail Rodriguez received
was actually sent out to the Diaspo
ra list and was in response to earli
er e-mails sent out by the Junior
and Senior Class presidents.
"I jumped to a conclusion and I
thought that the ASSU list had
been used and very, very stupidly I
took it upon myself to respond not
on anyone's behalf, but because I

thought it was somehow unfair,"
Rodriguez said.
He said he felt compelled to
confess after he was confronted by
the Chaparral staff.
"When the Chappie came and
told me that they knew and told me
what was happening as a result of it,
I knew I had to end it,"he said.
"Bad things are happening on cam
pus because of what I did. Looking
back it was a very stupid idea, and I
just wanted to say sorry to every
one I caused trouble to."
Rodriguez said that when he con
fessed to Howe, she said that disci
plinary action may be taken, as
sending the e-mail could have been
a Fundamental Standard violation.
"We've known each other fora
while and she was disappointed in
me and understandably so,"
he said.
Junior Ellie Martin, ASSU
Elections Commissioner, said that
this e-mail may have serious effects
on the election because the it
reached both undergraduate and
graduate students.
"Grad students are going to get
this e-mail and not hear anything
from the other side, and it has taint
ed the ASSU," Martin said.
She said that Rodriguez would
send out an apology to as many
students in the student body as he
could, in an effort to minimize
the damage.
