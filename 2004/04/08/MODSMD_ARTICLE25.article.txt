# Special report: Behind the special-fees system, part 2
## 
### ERIC ELDON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Editor s note: As elections approach, the following two-part series is an
effort to clearly explain the special-fees system to the student bodv. The
first artic ' e fo c used on the phenomenon of the skyrocketing refund rate
and the ASSU s response. This second article examines the develop
ment of the special-fees system over the years.
The ASSU special-fees system began through a loophole in
the constitution at the end of the 19605, shortly after the ASSU sepa
rated from the University; it has since evolved through a series of re
forms to become a main source of funding for student life on campus.
The ASSU itself became independent from the University
several years belore the first special-fee measure was passed under
the new ASSU constitution.
In 1966, anti-war activist David Harris was elected as ASSU
president for the following year. A self-avowed "radical" and "artis-

tic socialist," Harris "perceived a 'pater
nal attitude' in most administrators that
makes them unsympathetic to student de
mands to be treated as equals," according
to an April 29, 1966 Daily article about his
election victory.
Harris and subsequent activist
student leaders pressed for greater stu
dent decision-making power within the
University while they protested against
such major national issues as the war
in Vietnam.
John Hall, the ASSU financial
manager as well as the founding CEO of
Stanford Student Enterprises in 1996-
1997, has extensively researched the histo
ry of the special-fee system and the cir
cumstances in which it arose.
"It's my sense," he said, "that this
was related to prolonged student activism,
in which the student leadership was advo
cating for reforms on a number of differ
ent issues with the goal of getting them
selves a more active voice. And the Uni
versity administration wanted the student
voice to be more independent — to dis
tance themselves from it. It was a period in
which both sides agreed to disagree on a
range of issues."
During these years. Hall said, stu
dents were first allowed to serve on Uni
versity committees, the judicial charter
was reformed to better protect students
and the ASSU financial and political bod
ies were made constitutionally indepen
dent from the University's Dean of Stu
dents Office.
In the late 19605. The Debate
Club had successfully packed the legisla
ture of the ASSU such that they were
able to allocate general-fees money for
its members to take a trip to Los Ange
les. As a result, Hall said, in the spring of
1969, the ASSU general fee was rejected
by the student body who were fed up
with what they viewed as the misuse of
the fund.
Up to that point, general fees had
been given to support such groups as The
Daily, KZSU, the Axe Committee, the
Stanford Band and other groups that were
understood to provide services to the en
tire student body.
The following year, in the 1970
spring elections, with no general fees to
obtain money from, these groups sought
funding via a previously unused section of
the constitution where — by gathering
sufficient signatures — they were able to
place initiatives on the ballot to receive
"special assessment" fees from the stu
dent body.
For the next election, more
groups began to do the same even though
the general fee had been reapproved.
Groups realized, Hall said, that while

money from general fees was capped at $6,000, they could get as much
funding as they wanted if approved by the student body through the
uncapped special assessment constitutional initiatives — which came
to be known as "special fees."
That year. Hall said, the refund option was introduced by the
Child Care Center, a child-care service in Escondido Village: Recog
nizing that some students felt that child care was not appropriate to
fund as a student activity, the group campaigned with the promise
that any student who did not want to support the group if it passed
could get a refund.
Every year from that point on, he said, more groups figured
out that they could get on the special fees ballot. The fee grew from
$3 to $30 over the 20-year period between 1970 and the early 1990s
and the number of groups requesting special fees went from two to
over 20.
"Generally, the special fees expanded because it was so much
easier to get special-fees money than general-fees money," Hall said.
"But as fees climbed, so did refunds, although sometimes refunds
climbed because of particular political issues at the times — the re
funds provide a way fora student to express his or her disapproval of
a group or all student groups in between the elections.

"The effect over the 20 year period was that fees went up by
10 times, but students seemed generally willing to pay them — until
the early 19905. First, the grad students became disaffected with the
amount of the fees and they found a way to limit them. Today, it's the
undergraduates' turn to face the same question."
Hall feels that the special-fees system provides a valuable ed
ucational experience for students.
"This is real life," he said. "It's exactly like dealing with state
bond measures and federal taxes. I'm a big fan of democratic deci
sion making for the student body. I think it trains people to look at
these issues from all sides and teaches them to make an informed cit
izen's choice."
Special fees and the creation of the Graduate Student Council
In 1993, controversy between undergraduate and graduate
student leaders grew after the Graduate Student's Association
(GSA) — a group that organized largely social events for graduate

students — narrowly lost its special-fee measure. It was one of five
special-fees groups to be rejected for funding that year, and one of
only a couple of special-fees groups that catered directly to graduate
student interests.
During the same election, an amendment passed that allowed
students who had not voted in the election to refund their money from
special-fees groups.
In a post-election Daily article from April 16,1993, a grad
uate student leader criticized the vote against the GSA, saying
"over one-half of the student body is made up of graduate students
who are taxed to fund undergraduate programs. The thanks we get
is that undergraduates won't even fund one program for us —
screw them."
Following that article, a Daily editorial ran which stated that
graduate students were "apathetic" and their ASSU representatives
"whining." At that time, the ASSU Senate was a joint body made up
of both undergraduates and graduates, but the graduate senatorial
positions were rarely fully filled, and the focus of the ASSU — as well
as the programs funded through the general fee — was directed to
wards undergraduates, and by them.
Numerous letters to the editor by graduate students angered

by both the GSA rejection and the Daily editorial poured in, and cul
minated in a campaign that was self-titled the "graduate student tea
party," complete with the slogan of "taxation without representation"
and encouraged graduate students to collect their refunds from spe
cial-fees groups.
As a result of the debate, an amendment was unanimously ap
proved by the ASSU that May for placement on the following spring's
ballot that called for the separation of special fees groups into specif
ically undergraduate, graduate or joint categories.
The next fall. Daily editorials continued to criticize the spe
cial-fees-split amendment and the "tea party" for selfishly destroying
student life at Stanford by taking away funds.
One graduate student replied in a letter to the editor, "The
undergraduates denied us our money, so we're going to make them
pay for everything. Claiming fee refunds doesn't mean that a group
gets less money, it just means undergraduates have to pay more next
year. It's like when you were little; your older brother would come
take your football and not let you play. Life is hard, we're older and

wiser, and we're taking away your toys again."
That fall quarter, refunds rose to 32 percent, and that winter,
to 39 percent. In previous years, refunds had averaged around 25 per
cent per year for an average of 35 groups.
That spring of 1994, nearly half of the 36 groups on the ballot
for special fees did not gain funding, but this was largely because
voter apathy disqualified many groups based on a requirement that at
least 15 percent of voters to approve any special fees measure. The
amendment to split special fees between undergraduates and gradu
ates did not pass, but this was partly because it also called for an end
to refunds.
In the spring of 1995, however, the split amendment — which
did not try to end refunds — passed by 75 percent.
The controversy also brought about a larger discussion on
splitting the ASSU into undergraduate and graduate governing bodies.
An amendment to do so was proposed in February 1999 and
was passed by an overwhelming majority that spring, with 87.6 per
cent of students voting in favor. The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
and Graduate School Council were formed.
