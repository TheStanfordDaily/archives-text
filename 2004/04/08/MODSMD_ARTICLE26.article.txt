## Emily hates on love-fest surrounding Coach K 
### 
Before Duke blew an 11-point second
half lead to UConn in one of the best
Final Four matchups in recent memo
ry, the entire nation's media was
wrapped up in a Mike Krzyzewski love-fest —
which we unfortunately have to sit through
every March — as the Blue Devils' coach was
closing in on Dean Smith's all-time NCAA
Tournament win record.
And it's almost understandable. Coach K
has built the closest thing to a dynasty in pre
sent day men's college basketball.
There's no doubt he's doing something
right. But for me, the love-fest went too far
when ESPN.com featured a poll asking readers
who they would choose if they could pick one

coach to coach one game.
The choices? Mike
Krzyzewski and John Wooden.
Give me a fucking break.
I've already conceded
that Coach K is doing some
thing right, but that's as far as
it's gonna go.
Comparisons with Wood
en? Absolutely unacceptable.
And that particular compari
son is even more unacceptable.

Kryzyzewski is a great college coach, but
there's a reason why he's not an NBA coach.
Kryzyzewski is great at scouting talent and con
vincing that talent to put their John Hancock on
a letter of intent to play at Duke.
Year in and year out. Coach K has as much,
if not more, talented players than any team in
the country. Not only is he good at signing re
cruits, he has an amazing ability to keep them
around. The fact that Luol Deng is even con
sidering a return to campus is ridiculous.
Kryzyzewski is a recruiting machine. No
questions asked. He gets all the players he
wants and the only time he runs into trouble
is when one of his 8,000 McDonald's All-
Americans runs off to the NBA or transfers
because he's afraid he's not going to get
enough playing time.
But to even suggest that he's the best in
game coach of all time is ludicrous. Case in
point was this year's Final Four collapse.
And sorry. Coach K. it was absolutely a col
lapse. The biggest gift of the NCAA season fell
into your lap when Emeka Okafor played only
four minutes in the first half —and you still
couldn't fully capitalize.
Duke fans out there might be saying, "Hey,
they still had hairless Villanueva and Josh
Boone out there," but really, Shelden Williams
and Shavlik Randolph should have been able
to get more done. And with no shot-blocking
presence to fear, Deng should have been able
to drive the lane every time down the floor.
But no, the genius, Mike Kryzyzewski, had
him taking mid-range jumpers and treys.
And then when things didn't go his way.
Coach K resorted to the Bobby Knight school
of coaching — picking on the refs.
As good as the games were, one of the
high points of Saturday's action was
Kryzyzewski flipping out and screaming
"You cheated us!" and "You killed us!" at
one of the refs.
Instead of bitching like a little girl. Coach
K should be sending those refs a box of
muffins. Thanks to them, he was actually in a
position to win the game after the two quick
ies on Okafor.
After a first half with no Okafor, Duke has
no excuse for losing that game. And the loss has
to be put squarely on Coach Ks shoulders. He
simply can't be considered one of the best-ever
in-game coaches.
Yeah, maybe I'm a little biased, but I
would take Mike Montgomery fora single
game over Kryzyzewski any day. He does so
much more with so much less talent. The Car
dinal had one late collapse this year — unfor
tunately it had to happen in the tourney —
but that's still damn impressive coaching. I'd
take Jim Calhoun. I'd take Paul Hewitt. I'd
take Mike Anderson. I'd take Gary Williams.
I might even take Phil Martelli... Okay, I
won't go that far.
Even before the game, Kryzyzewski and the
rest of his team managed to come across as a group
of whiny little girls when responding to a perfectly
understandable wave of anti-Duke sentiment.
J.J. Redick, the sharp-shooter who lacks any
ability whatsoever to create his own shot,
showed that he did have an uncanny ability to
sound like a prick.
"It's jealousy," Redick said. "When people
are jealous, they try to bring you down."
I wonder if he still thinks people are jealous*
after his open look from three that would have
tied the game with six seconds left barely
grazed the rim.
I wonder if he still thinks people are jealous
after his absolutely amazing 4-for-12 shooting
performance. Looks like he didn't need other
people to bring him down after all.
He and Coach K did a pretty good job of that
on their own.

And don t bother sending anything that says
she's jealous because Stan ford lost in the second
round. At this point she's over it.
