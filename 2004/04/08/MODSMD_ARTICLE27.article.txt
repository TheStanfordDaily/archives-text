# No. 1 Card battles Beavers
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Freshman left-hander Blake Holler loves pitching at
Stanford for countless reasons, but one of them has been
critically important to the Cardinal's success this season.
"My high school team didn't score a lot of runs, but here
you know you have the offense to back you up," he said.
"It helps because you know you don't have to strike ev
erybody out and you can just let the game go."
Holler and the rest of the young Cardinal pitching staff
will hope for that same kind of run support this weekend
as Stanford (23-4, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) travels to
Corvallis, Ore., fora three-game series against Oregon
State starting today at 5 p.m.
Stanford has been prolific offensively, but more impor
tantly for the regular rotation — which features sopho
mores Mark Romanczuk and Jeff Gilmore along with
Holler — that offense has appeared early and in bunches.
The Cardinal has outscored its opponents by a more
than two-to-one margin in the first five innings (153-61),
while scoring three or more runs a whopping 21 times in
those early innings.
"If we can go out there and put runs on the board in the
first few innings, it can really take the pressure off [the
younger pitchers]," senior centerfielder Sam Fuld said.
So how does this powerful offense work?
That's easy.
Balance.
Stanford has six batters hitting over .330, three of them
in the Pac-10's top 10: Jonny Ash (.391), Jed Lowrie (.388)
and John Mayberry Jr. (.373). The Cardinal also has six
players with at least 21 RBIs.
For an example of the balance, look to last weekend,
when the Cardinal scored a total of 31 runs in 3 games.
Light-hitting shortstop Chris Minaker had five hits, in
cluding a home run and four RBI in the first game. Ash,
who had only three career home runs before the weekend,
had his first multi-homer game on Saturday, including a
game-winning two-run blast in the ninth.
"Putnam and I didn't swing the bats real well last week
end, and we still scored," Lowrie said. "Who do you pitch
to in our lineup?"
(Putnam and Lowrie, by the way, combined to go a de
cent 7-for-28; so Lowrie's being a little hard on himself.)
Recently, a major league scout said that if this lineup
faced major-league pitching 30 times a year, they'd give
them a run for their money.
"They've just got so much balance one through nine,"
he said.
That is saying a lot, given that Stanford lost its two top
hitters from a year ago to the pros. Both Ryan Garko and
Carlos Quentin were major forces in the lineup last year
and are now toiling away in the minor league system.
In fact, many people outside of the program are prob
ably pretty surprised to see Stanford off to its best start in
22 years.
Inside the program, however, is a different story.
"It might be a surprise to a lot of people looking in from
the outside, but I can tell you that we expected to be this
good in the fall," Lowrie said. "And we expect to be this
good the rest of the year."
With so many questions seemingly being answered so
quickly, the Stanford lineup appears to be rounding into a
more consistent form. Coach Mark Marquess said the ro
tation of Romanczuk, Gilmore and Holler is "almost set in
stone" and, of course, he would never think about tinker
ing with the middle of his order.
With Ash (12-game hitting streak) and Brian Hall (10-
game hitting streak) hot right now. Marquess has the luxu
ry of having his fleet-footed hitters getting consistently on
base from both the top and bottom of the lineup.
Only a few areas require a bit more work.
Marquess said Minaker has impressed him at shortstop
and will continue to play as long as he continues to per
form. Given his work with the bat over the weekend and
the glove in the long haul (one error in 54 chances), Mi

naker has seemingly taken the job for good.
The Cardinal also has freshman Adam Sorgi and
sophomore Chris Lewis ready to step in if Marquess
sees fit.
The other position in flux will be designated hitter, ac
cording to Marquess. Right now, the Stanford manager is
riding freshman Ryan Seawell, who is hitting .364 in the
DH spot. But watch for Chris Carter, who has struggled
early in the season and is hitting .170, to work his way back
into the lineup.

Finally, Stanford could always use more pitching. The
one player that probably has Marquess scratching his head
the most is sophomore Matt Manship, who a year ago was
an especially impressive contributor out of the bullpen, es
pecially in the College World Series. This spring, however,
Manship has been much less effective and has pitched in
only 12 1/3 innings this season.
"Hopefully we can get him back in there," Marquess
said. "At least his arm is feeling good. It's just a confi
dence thing."

critically important to the Cardinal's success this season.
"My high school team didn't score a lot of runs, but here
you know you have the offense to back you up," he said.
"It helps because you know you don't have to strike ev
erybody out and you can just let the game go."
Holler and the rest of the young Cardinal pitching staff
will hope for that same kind of run support this weekend
as Stanford (23-4, 2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) travels to
Corvallis, Ore., fora three-game series against Oregon
State starting today at 5 p.m.
Stanford has been prolific offensively, but more impor
tantly for the regular rotation — which features sopho
mores Mark Romanczuk and Jeff Gilmore along with
Holler — that offense has appeared early and in bunches.
The Cardinal has outscored its opponents by a more
than two-to-one margin in the first five innings (153-61),
while scoring three or more runs a whopping 21 times in
those early innings.
"If we can go out there and put runs on the board in the
first few innings, it can really take the pressure off [the
younger pitchers]," senior centerfielder Sam Fuld said.
So how does this powerful offense work?
That's easy.
Balance.
Stanford has six batters hitting over .330, three of them
in the Pac-10's top 10: Jonny Ash (.391), Jed Lowrie (.388)
and John Mayberry Jr. (.373). The Cardinal also has six
players with at least 21 RBIs.
For an example of the balance, look to last weekend,
when the Cardinal scored a total of 31 runs in 3 games.
Light-hitting shortstop Chris Minaker had five hits, in
cluding a home run and four RBI in the first game. Ash,
who had only three career home runs before the weekend,
had his first multi-homer game on Saturday, including a
game-winning two-run blast in the ninth.
"Putnam and I didn't swing the bats real well last week
end, and we still scored," Lowrie said. "Who do you pitch
to in our lineup?"
(Putnam and Lowrie, by the way, combined to go a de
cent 7-for-28; so Lowrie's being a little hard on himself.)
Recently, a major league scout said that if this lineup
faced major-league pitching 30 times a year, they'd give
them a run for their money.
"They've just got so much balance one through nine,"
he said.
That is saying a lot, given that Stanford lost its two top
hitters from a year ago to the pros. Both Ryan Garko and
Carlos Quentin were major forces in the lineup last year
and are now toiling away in the minor league system.
In fact, many people outside of the program are prob
ably pretty surprised to see Stanford off to its best start in
22 years.
Inside the program, however, is a different story.
"It might be a surprise to a lot of people looking in from
the outside, but I can tell you that we expected to be this
good in the fall," Lowrie said. "And we expect to be this
good the rest of the year."
With so many questions seemingly being answered so
quickly, the Stanford lineup appears to be rounding into a
more consistent form. Coach Mark Marquess said the ro
tation of Romanczuk, Gilmore and Holler is "almost set in
stone" and, of course, he would never think about tinker
ing with the middle of his order.
With Ash (12-game hitting streak) and Brian Hall (10-
game hitting streak) hot right now. Marquess has the luxu
ry of having his fleet-footed hitters getting consistently on
base from both the top and bottom of the lineup.
Only a few areas require a bit more work.
Marquess said Minaker has impressed him at shortstop
and will continue to play as long as he continues to per
form. Given his work with the bat over the weekend and
the glove in the long haul (one error in 54 chances), Mi

naker has seemingly taken the job for good.
The Cardinal also has freshman Adam Sorgi and
sophomore Chris Lewis ready to step in if Marquess
sees fit.
The other position in flux will be designated hitter, ac
cording to Marquess. Right now, the Stanford manager is
riding freshman Ryan Seawell, who is hitting .364 in the
DH spot. But watch for Chris Carter, who has struggled
early in the season and is hitting .170, to work his way back
into the lineup.

Finally, Stanford could always use more pitching. The
one player that probably has Marquess scratching his head
the most is sophomore Matt Manship, who a year ago was
an especially impressive contributor out of the bullpen, es
pecially in the College World Series. This spring, however,
Manship has been much less effective and has pitched in
only 12 1/3 innings this season.
"Hopefully we can get him back in there," Marquess
said. "At least his arm is feeling good. It's just a confi
dence thing."
