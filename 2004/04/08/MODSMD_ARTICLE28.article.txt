After the dust settled at last year's Pacific-10 Conference Championships, the Stan
ford women's track and field team had its two-year win streak snapped by Southern Cal
ifornia, and the men settled for second as well.
As in years past, Stanford will rely heavily on its distance squad to propel them back
to the top of the Pac-10 this season. The Cardinal returns all of its individual champions
at events 800 meters and above.
Leading the returnees is senior Louis Luchini who claimed both the Pac-10 5.000-
and 10,000-meter titles last year and went on to finish second at the NCAA Champi
onships in the 5,000.
Redshirt junior lan Dobson should also be a threat at the distance events, with the
top returning 10,000-meter time in the NCAA, as well as some big race success with his
second-place showing in the 5,000 at the Indoor NCAA Championships. Both Dobson
and Luchini will be looking to qualify for the Olympic Trials with a shot at traveling to
Athens for the 2004 Games.
Ail-Americans Chris Emme and Neil Davis, as well as freshmen Brett Gotcher and
Peter Meindl, will boost the Cardinal's distance squad.
The men also return the reigning Pac-10 and NCAA 1.500-meter champion, senior
Grant Robison. After the regular NCAA season. Robison spent the summer compet
ing on the European track circuit, lowering his personal record to 3:35.75, the third
fastest time in school history and No. 2 in the U.S. last year.
Joining Robison at the middle distances is the 2002 NCAA 1,500-meter champion,
junior Don Sage, and sophomore Ryan Hall, the runner-up at the 2003 NCAA Cross
Country Championships.
All three of these athletes have a legitimate chance to qualify for the U.S. Olympic
team this year in the 1,500.
Sophomore Justin Romaniuk, the 2003 Pac-10 800-meter champion, sophomore
Jacob Gomez, senior Seth Hejny and senior Andy Powell should help boost the Cardi
nal's middle-distance depth even more at both the Pac-10 and NCAA level.
Despite the dominance of Stanford's program, the sprinting and field teams will still
be needed to capture the men's third Pac-10 title in four years.
Juniors Nick Sebes and Curt Goehring return as Stanford's top 400 runners. Both
opened in fine fashion at the Stanford Invitational and look to not only help qualify for
