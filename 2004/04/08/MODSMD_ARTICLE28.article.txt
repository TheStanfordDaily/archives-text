# Track poised to return to the head of the Pac

After the dust settled at last year's Pacific-10 Conference Championships, the Stan
ford women's track and field team had its two-year win streak snapped by Southern Cal
ifornia, and the men settled for second as well.
As in years past, Stanford will rely heavily on its distance squad to propel them back
to the top of the Pac-10 this season. The Cardinal returns all of its individual champions
at events 800 meters and above.
Leading the returnees is senior Louis Luchini who claimed both the Pac-10 5.000-
and 10,000-meter titles last year and went on to finish second at the NCAA Champi
onships in the 5,000.
Redshirt junior lan Dobson should also be a threat at the distance events, with the
top returning 10,000-meter time in the NCAA, as well as some big race success with his
second-place showing in the 5,000 at the Indoor NCAA Championships. Both Dobson
and Luchini will be looking to qualify for the Olympic Trials with a shot at traveling to
Athens for the 2004 Games.
Ail-Americans Chris Emme and Neil Davis, as well as freshmen Brett Gotcher and
Peter Meindl, will boost the Cardinal's distance squad.
The men also return the reigning Pac-10 and NCAA 1.500-meter champion, senior
Grant Robison. After the regular NCAA season. Robison spent the summer compet
ing on the European track circuit, lowering his personal record to 3:35.75, the third
fastest time in school history and No. 2 in the U.S. last year.
Joining Robison at the middle distances is the 2002 NCAA 1,500-meter champion,
junior Don Sage, and sophomore Ryan Hall, the runner-up at the 2003 NCAA Cross
Country Championships.
All three of these athletes have a legitimate chance to qualify for the U.S. Olympic
team this year in the 1,500.
Sophomore Justin Romaniuk, the 2003 Pac-10 800-meter champion, sophomore
Jacob Gomez, senior Seth Hejny and senior Andy Powell should help boost the Cardi
nal's middle-distance depth even more at both the Pac-10 and NCAA level.
Despite the dominance of Stanford's program, the sprinting and field teams will still
be needed to capture the men's third Pac-10 title in four years.

the 1,600-meter relay team for the
NCAA Championships again, but
help the Cardinal by scoring points
at Pac-lOs.
Joining them will be juniors
Gerren Crochet and Jeff Conkey.
Romaniuk, junior Evan Fox and
freshman Russell Brown may also
contribute to the 1,600-relay team
this season.
The jumps are headlined by
sophomore Solomon Welch, the
reigning Junior National champion
in the event. Welch placed fourth at
last year's championships with a
freshman-record jump of 50 feet.

score at the long jump this year.

pears to be on a mission to qualify
for the NCAA Championships.
After working through last season
with nagging injuries, Goff looks
poised to be one of Stanford's best
javelin throwers ever and make
some noise at the national level.
Despite the returning talent, it
will not be an easy road to the title.
USC returns one of the best

jumpers in the nation in Allen Sims,
while UCLA's Dan Ames is consid
ered one of the top shot putters in
the country.
Oregon will bring one of its
strongest, most balanced squads
ever, complimented by NCAA In
door pole vault runner-up and se
nior All-American Jason Hart
mann, who could do the most harm
to the Cardinal by upsetting Stan
ford's distance runners, taking away
valuable points. The Ducks and the
Trojans are the favorites for the
Pac-10 title.
The distance squad will also face
strong challenges from Arizona's
Robert Cheseret, one of the
NCAA's top distance runners, and
Washington's Eric Garner.
For the sprinters, there is no easy
road. USC, UCLA, and Arizona
State all boast nationally-recog
nized sprint squads and most of the
Pac-10 schools have one or more
sprinters ranked nationally.
Despite these challenges, the
Cardinal will compete at the top
level as it always has both at the con
ference and national level and, in
the meantime, will focus on trying to
qualify for both the Pac-10 and Re
gional Championships in May.
Many of the athletes will have

that chance this weekend as the
men's and women's squads will split
between the Brutus Hamilton Invi
tational at Berkeley and the Rater
Johnson Invitational at UCLA.
Most of the throwers will be trav
eling south to face UCLA, one of
the nation's top throwing powers, as
well as some elite competition in the
throwing events.
The rest of the athletes will trav
el across the Bay to face rival Cali
fornia on its home track. They will
also meet competitors from Ohio
State, Brigham Young and Wash
ington State, as well as some Divi
sion II programs, open runners and
members of the Nike Farm Team,
which is a professional running club
based here at Stanford.
The Brutus Hamilton Invitation
al will be an opportunity for most of
the sprinters to open up and start
posting the needed qualifying
marks, while the mid-distance
squad will use the meet as a chance
to run off-events in which they nor
mally do not compete. The distance
squad will use this primarily as a
tune-up for the Mt. San Antonio
College Relays, one of the nation's
top collegiate invitationals, which
will be held next weekend in Los
Angeles, Calif.
