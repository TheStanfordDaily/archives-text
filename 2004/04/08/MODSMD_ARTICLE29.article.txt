## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
One week after a wild overtime win against rival Califor
nia, the No. 19 Stanford women's lacrosse team (7-4, 4-0
Mountain Pacitic Sports Federation) faces a tough test to
morrow night when No. 13 Northwestern visits the Farm.
Ihe C ardinal enters the match well-armed, though with
the last two MPSF Players of the Week on its roster. Junior
midfielder Kelsey Twist won the honor for March 29-April 4
by virtue of her four goals against Cal last Friday. Senior mid
fielder Abbi Hills won for March 22-29 by scoring 11 goals
(including six in one game) as the Cardinal went 3-0 during
that week.
Stanford now won its last four games and remains
atop the M PSF. This weekend s game won't have any impact
on the Cardinal's conference record, but the team needs a
win to make certain it will remain ranked in the top 20.
Hills (with a team-leading 23 goals) and Twist (with a
school-record 50 career assists) will lead the attack. Hills has
taken a team-high 61 shots, while Twist has a team-high 10
assists and is third in goals with 16. Sophomore Megan Burk
er has 19 goals and eight assists and is another key compo
nent this season.
I n addition to strong play from its standouts, balance was the name
of the game against Cal, as seven different players found the net.
Stanford ranks 17th nationally on defense, allowing just
8.45 goals per game. Senior defender Katie Grube has forced
21 turnovers this season — including one that led to a key
goal in the Cal game — and her 99 career turnovers forced is
the highest total in program history.
Senior goalkeeper Christina Saikus will need to bring her best
against the Wildcats, something she has done against a lot of
teams this year. Her .579 save percentage ranks eighth nationally.
The Wildcats are an impressive 7-1 overall and are com
ing off an 18-4 romp over Connecticut. Freshman Kristen
Kjellman leads the team with 25 goals, helping Northwestern
to a 5-1 road record.
The action gets underway tomorrow at Maloney Field
at 7 p.m.
