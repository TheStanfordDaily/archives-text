U.S. News & World Report re
cently published its rankings of
America's Best Graduate Schools
2005, and Stanford once again occu
pied a top position in most of the
major categories.
Stanford's School of Education
was listed as number one together
with Harvard. Both Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
and School of Engineering were

ranked number two following Har
vard and MIT. Stanford Law School
has rated number three after Yale
and Harvard, and the School of
Medicine placed eighht nationwide.
According to U.S. News & World
Report, these rankings are based on
two types of data: expert opinion
about program quality and statistical
indicators that measure the quality
of a school's faculty, research, and
students.
"Our ranking methodology dif

Richard Folkers, director of media
relations at U.S. News & World Re
port. "Basically we combine subjec

rate, students' starting salaries and
so forth."

data, U.S. News & World Report
said they come from surveys of more
than 1,000 programs and nearly
9,100 academics and other profes

sionals conducted in fall 2003.
Dean of the School of Education
Deborah Stipek said she was very
pleased with this year's rank of the

rated by other scholars in the field as
the top school in the country.

means, and they did not capture
