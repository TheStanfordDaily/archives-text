# Stanford tops education rankings
## 
### DANDAN WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
U.S. News & World Report re
cently published its rankings of
America's Best Graduate Schools
2005, and Stanford once again occu
pied a top position in most of the
major categories.
Stanford's School of Education
was listed as number one together
with Harvard. Both Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
and School of Engineering were

ranked number two following Har
vard and MIT. Stanford Law School
has rated number three after Yale
and Harvard, and the School of
Medicine placed eighht nationwide.
According to U.S. News & World
Report, these rankings are based on
two types of data: expert opinion
about program quality and statistical
indicators that measure the quality
of a school's faculty, research, and
students.
"Our ranking methodology dif
fers from category to category," said

Richard Folkers, director of media
relations at U.S. News & World Re
port. "Basically we combine subjec
tive data — mostly surveys with aca
demics and recruiters etc. — togeth
er with objective data, which fre
quently are test scores, acceptance
rate, students' starting salaries and
so forth."
As for the indicator and opinion
data, U.S. News & World Report
said they come from surveys of more
than 1,000 programs and nearly
9,100 academics and other profes

sionals conducted in fall 2003.
Dean of the School of Education
Deborah Stipek said she was very
pleased with this year's rank of the
school and was particularly happy
because the school is consistently
rated by other scholars in the field as
the top school in the country.
Stipek also mentioned that the
rankings were not perfect by any
means, and they did not capture
many important qualities of educa


ARON HEGYI/The Stanford Daily
tion programs, such as individual
ized attention.
Stipek's response was echoed by
Jim Plummer, dean of the school of
engineering, which has been ranked
number two for the past few years.
"I am delighted as the school's
excellence is being recognized,"
Plummer said. "This ranking is one
datum that gets a lot of national at
tention and we certainly pay atten
tion to it."
He added, "I am not surprised
that we are number two, as the size
of the school is counted as an impor
tant factor. However, we don't want
to be as big as MIT, which is twice as
big as us, and we do not want to be a
technical institution. We are glad to
be within Stanford — a great liberal

arts university."
Nevertheless, some of the deans
question the ranking's quality and
accuracy.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school directly pointed out in his
newsletter on April 5 that "the
methodology employed by U.S.
News & World Report is skewed to
evaluate size over quality."
Pizzo suggested in his letter that if
funding per investigator had been
employed in their ranking of med
ical schools as is done in engineering
schools, Stanford would almost cer
tainly be in the top five — more ac
curately reflecting its overall quality.
As for the GSB, Stanford has in
the recent years competed for the
top spot with Harvard.
"We have mixed feelings about
the rankings," said Robert Joss,
dean of the GSB. "We don't think
rankings are the best way to charac
terize or evaluate the relative ap
proaches of different schools."
The measures the U.S. News &
World Report use do not always

capture the individual character of
each institution, he added, and what
is most important is the fit between
students and schools, not the rank
order.
Stanford's GSB remains the most
selective of all the business schools,
with the lowest acceptance rate of
9.2 percent. Entering students have
the highest student scores of any
ranked business school and the high
est average annual salary ($107,000)
upon graduation.
"The rankings are certainly not
perfect," Folkers said. "However we
try to be as accurate and transparent
as possible, specifying out our
methodology."
He added, "The rankings are im
portant but far from the only tool to
choose schools. The most important
thing is to find the best fit for stu
dents."
Folkers emphasized that maga
zine ranked schools for the benefits
of students and they were not trying
"As the events progress, the field
tends to narrow and we concentrate
on learning more about the rushees
as well as offering them a more in
depth look at our house," Tyree
said.
To combat underage drinking,
the university and IFC impose limits
on rush events.
"Serving alcohol to rushees at
any point in the rush process is
against university policy and the pol
icy of each fraternity's national char
ter," Hennings said. "However, we
have never had a problem with alco
hol consumption during rush."
Fraternity members and IFC leaders
alike emphasize the many advan
tages of membership.

"Fraternities are an active part of
the university," Lu said. "They give
men the opportunity to participate
in community service activities, pro
vide academic support and are a
great social outlet."
Rush events end on Bid Day,
Monday, April 19, when the frater
nities extend invitations for rushees
to join. It is up to each fraternity to
decide how many bids they will give
out based on university housing re
quirements and their own internal
assessments. The recruits have until
noon the following Wednesday to
inform the fraternities of their final
decision.
"In the past, many freshmen who
never considered joining a fraternity
came out for rush and ended up in a
chapter that suited them," Hennings
said. "Stanford fraternities are
much different from stereotypical
fraternities, and the benefits of join
ing are far greater than members ini
tially expect."

big as us, and we do not want to be a
technical institution. We are glad to
be within Stanford — a great liberal

Nevertheless, some of the deans
question the ranking's quality and
accuracy.
Philip Pizzo, dean of the medical
school directly pointed out in his
newsletter on April 5 that "the
methodology employed by U.S.
News & World Report is skewed to
evaluate size over quality."
Pizzo suggested in his letter that if
funding per investigator had been
employed in their ranking of med
ical schools as is done in engineering
schools, Stanford would almost cer
tainly be in the top five — more ac
curately reflecting its overall quality.
As for the GSB, Stanford has in
the recent years competed for the
top spot with Harvard.
"We have mixed feelings about
the rankings," said Robert Joss,
dean of the GSB. "We don't think
rankings are the best way to charac
terize or evaluate the relative ap
proaches of different schools."
The measures the U.S. News &
World Report use do not always

capture the individual character of
each institution, he added, and what
is most important is the fit between
students and schools, not the rank
order.
Stanford's GSB remains the most
selective of all the business schools,
with the lowest acceptance rate of
9.2 percent. Entering students have
the highest student scores of any
ranked business school and the high
est average annual salary ($107,000)
upon graduation.
"The rankings are certainly not
perfect," Folkers said. "However we
try to be as accurate and transparent
as possible, specifying out our
methodology."
He added, "The rankings are im

choose schools. The most important
thing is to find the best fit for stu
dents."
Folkers emphasized that maga

tends to narrow and we concentrate
on learning more about the rushees
as well as offering them a more in

To combat underage drinking,
the university and IFC impose limits
on rush events.
"Serving alcohol to rushees at
any point in the rush process is
against university policy and the pol

have never had a problem with alco

Fraternity members and IFC leaders
alike emphasize the many advan

"Fraternities are an active part of
the university," Lu said. "They give

Rush events end on Bid Day,
Monday, April 19, when the frater
nities extend invitations for rushees
to join. It is up to each fraternity to
decide how many bids they will give
out based on university housing re
quirements and their own internal
assessments. The recruits have until
noon the following Wednesday to
inform the fraternities of their final
decision.
"In the past, many freshmen who
never considered joining a fraternity
came out for rush and ended up in a
chapter that suited them," Hennings
said. "Stanford fraternities are
much different from stereotypical
fraternities, and the benefits of join
ing are far greater than members ini
tially expect."
U.S. News & World Report re
cently published its rankings of
America's Best Graduate Schools
2005, and Stanford once again occu
pied a top position in most of the
major categories.
Stanford's School of Education
was listed as number one together
with Harvard. Both Stanford's
Graduate School of Business (GSB)
and School of Engineering were

ranked number two following Har
vard and MIT. Stanford Law School
has rated number three after Yale
and Harvard, and the School of
Medicine placed eighht nationwide.
According to U.S. News & World
Report, these rankings are based on
two types of data: expert opinion
about program quality and statistical
indicators that measure the quality
of a school's faculty, research, and
students.
"Our ranking methodology dif
fers from category to category," said

Richard Folkers, director of media
relations at U.S. News & World Re
port. "Basically we combine subjec
tive data — mostly surveys with aca
demics and recruiters etc. — togeth
er with objective data, which fre
quently are test scores, acceptance
rate, students' starting salaries and
so forth."
As for the indicator and opinion
data, U.S. News & World Report
said they come from surveys of more
than 1,000 programs and nearly
9,100 academics and other profes

sionals conducted in fall 2003.
Dean of the School of Education
Deborah Stipek said she was very
pleased with this year's rank of the
school and was particularly happy
because the school is consistently
rated by other scholars in the field as
the top school in the country.
Stipek also mentioned that the
rankings were not perfect by any
means, and they did not capture
many important qualities of educa


ARON HEGYI/The Stanford Daily
tion programs, such as individual
ized attention.
Stipek's response was echoed by
Jim Plummer, dean of the school of
engineering, which has been ranked
number two for the past few years.
"I am delighted as the school's
excellence is being recognized,"
Plummer said. "This ranking is one
datum that gets a lot of national at
tention and we certainly pay atten
tion to it."
He added, "I am not surprised
that we are number two, as the size
of the school is counted as an impor
tant factor. However, we don't want
to be as big as MIT, which is twice as
big as us, and we do not want to be a
technical institution. We are glad to
