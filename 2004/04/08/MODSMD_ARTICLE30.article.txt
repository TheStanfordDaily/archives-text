# Bears upset No. 10 Cardinal in Berkeley
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Maybe it was Cal's home-court
advantage. Perhaps it was the after
effect of two tough losses last week
end. Whatever the reason, the No. 10
Stanford men's tennis team was un
able to produce a win over its Bay
Area rival on Tuesday, as the Bears
slipped past the Cardinal, 4-3,
in Berkeley.
The two teams had previously met
in February, a matchup that ended
much more favorably for Stanford (12-
6, 4-1 Pacific-10 Conference). Playing
at home at Taube Tennis Center, the
Cardinal defeated the Bears, 5-2. But
the Bears returned the favor this week
and handed Stanford its first confer
ence loss of the season.

"Cal played much better against us
this time," Stanford head coach Dick
Gould said. "We beat them pretty easi
ly in singles last time. We killed them in
doubles, but this time their doubles
were a little stronger."
Cal (7-12, 3-5) grabbed the cru
cial doubles point at the start of the
dual match to lay the foundation for
the upset. At the No. 2 spot, Cal's
Tyler Browne and Wayne Wong de
feated Stanford sophomore James
Pade and freshman James Wan, 8-6,
dropping their dual match record
to 4-4.
"James [Pade] is still trying to get
back into shape and No. 2 doubles
wasn't too good," Gould said. "We
ended up losing a tiebreak. which lost
us the doubles point."
It was a close match between the

duo of Stanford senior Carter Morris
and junior Phil Sheng and Cal's Kuni
Minato and John Pettit. but the Golden
Bears eventually prevailed on the last
point due to an unforced error by Stan
ford, winning 9-8.
Stanford did manage to win one dou
bles match. The freshly-ranked duo of
No. 23 sophomore K.C. Corkery and ju
nior Sam Warburg outplayed Cal's only
ranked doubles team. No. 21 Patrick Bri
aud and Balazs Veress, snapping up an 8-
2 victory.
But the Cardinal could muster only
two singles wins, which sealed Cal's vic
tory.
At the No. 3 spot, No. 85 Wan
brought his spotless dual match win
streak to a team-high 19-0 after defeat
ing Browne, 6-1,6-1.
"I saw him play beforehand earlier

this year when my teammate James Pade
played him," Wan said. "He had a big
forehand, so 1 tried to keep the ball away
from him. He got a little frantic fin our
match], though, and he didn't win many
points after that."
Pade garnered Stanford's only other
singles win, defeating Patrick Briaud,
6-4,7-5.
No. 11 Warburg lost to Cal's No. 118
Wayne Wong, 6-3, 6-4, while No. 110
Corkery followed suit, losing by the
same score to No. 57 Veress.
Morris lost to Jake Leivent, 6-1,6-2,
and freshman Chris Rasmussen was
unable to capture the third set of his
match, losing 6-4,5-7,6-4.
