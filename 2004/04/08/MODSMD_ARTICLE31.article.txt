## Golf heads to T-bird 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's golf team tees off tomorrow at
the ASU Thunderbird Intercollegiate in Tempe, Ariz.,
hoping to improve on last year's seventh-place finish.
First-round action begins tomorrow morning at
the par-72, 7,037-yard Karsten Golf Course and the
tournament will wrap Lip with an 18-hole final round
on Saturday.
Senior Blake Mastalir, who shot a season-low 68 in
the final round of the Thunderbird last season, leads five
Cardinal competitors in this year's field.
Junior Kevin Blue, sophomore Kyle Gentry and
freshmen Zack Miller and Brandon Lawson will also
compete for the Cardinal, while freshman Matt Savage,
an Arizona native, will compete as an individual.
Miller tied for fourth with a one-under-par 215 at the
Oregon Duck Invitational on March 23, at which Stan
ford placed third as a team with a 15-over-par 879.
Gentry tied for 24th at the Thunderbird as a fresh
man and shot a season-low 68 in the second round, while
Blue tied for 48th.
Host Arizona State won the tournament last year
with a three-round score of 824, eight shots ahead of sec
ond-place Southern California. Fifteen schools make up
this year's field, including non-conference teams from
Pepperdine, Texas Tech and San Diego State. The
Aztecs' Jeff Hansen fired a five-under par 211 to win the
Oregon Duck Invitational.
The Cardinal plays host to the U.S. Intercollegiate
next weekend before returning to Arizona for the Pacif
ic-10 Conference Championships to be held April 26-27.
