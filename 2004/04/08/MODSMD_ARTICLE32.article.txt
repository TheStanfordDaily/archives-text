# One more 'Big Splash' for three Stanford seniors
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's Senior Day and Big Splash this Friday at Avery
Aquatic Center as the No. 2 Stanford women's water polo
team (14-3,6-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) honors
three seniors set to depart at the end of the year.
Driver Shannon Averett, driver Lauren Faust and two
meter defender Wendy Watkins are all preparing for the last
regular season homestand of their Stanford careers, as the
Cardinal squares off against two MPSF opponents, No. 6
California (12-10,3-5) and Pacific (3-19,0-8).
So how does the team hope to send off its seniors as the
season winds down?
The first goal is a couple more wins and, if history is any
indication, that goal is well within reach. Stanford has had a
lot of recent success against both California and Pacific.
The Cardinal carries a streak of 12 consecutive wins
against the Bears into Friday night's game, including two
earlier this season. Stanford defeated Cal 3-1 in the season
opening Stanford Invitational and won 9-7 when the teams
faced off at the Gaucho tournament in February.
At Big Splash, however, history is put aside.
"When it comes to Big Splash, people just show up and
are excited to play," Watkins said. "It's not a game that any
one can overlook. We hope to keep the record up of no loss
es to them over the last four years. 1 think it's awesome that
[in all the time] I've been here we've never lost to Cal."
Unranked Pacific has struggled defensively this year, al
lowing its opponents to score 268 times. The last-place
Tigers are still seeking their first conference win.
Saturday afternoon's game will be the first matchup be
tween Stanford and Pacific this year. While the Tigers may
be looking fora little revenge after the schools' last meet
ing, the Cardinal looks forward to a repetition of last year's
17-6 romp.
Stanford is well aware of the potential pitfalls of playing
a weaker opponent, that it requires a certain mindset to stay
focused and not get cocky heading into the game.
"When we play weaker teams it's easy to let them in the
game in the beginning by letting them get in a couple cheap
goals," Watkins said. "Our goal against weaker teams is to
get up to a lead so we dominate the game and so that [our
opponent] knows we are going to win."
Freshman two-meter defender Alison Gregorka offers
another solution: Don't change the game plan.
"You've got to go into every game with the same attitude
and get ready for the game in the same way," Gregorka said.
"You've just got to play your best. You don't prepare any
differently with a weaker team."
While California and Pacific look like easy matches on
paper, each team boasts players capable of spoiling the Car
dinal's plans this weekend.
Junior All-American Jodie Needles has scored 31
times for the Bears and teammate Elsie Windes has made
an impact in her first season by tallying 23 goals. The
Bears come into Stanford fresh off a win against UC-
Irvine last weekend.
One of the few bright spots for the Tigers throughout
their difficult season has been newcomer Morgan Diehl,
who has posted 22 goals on the season. Other Pacific nota
bles include senior Jessica Melcher, who leads the team with
27 goals, and sophomore Julie Snyder, who follows closely
behind with 24 scores. Pacific will play San Jose State (11-12,
2-4) before facing Stanford on Saturday.
While this weekend will mark the final Big Splash for
Stanford's seniors, the team hopes their season is far
from over.
"[We want to] qualify for the NCAA" freshman two
meter defender Christine Hewko said.
Watkins hopes to make her experience even more mem
orable with another shot at the NCAA championship, an at
tainable goal fora squad whose three losses have all come at
the hands of the nation's top-ranked team, USC.
"I just hope that I can help lead my team to an NCAA
championship like past teams have done," Watkins said.
"I feel an added pressure because I'm a senior. I want to
do well because I won't have another chance to take a
stab at it."
With two regular season road games after this week
end before the MPSF tournament, Stanford would like
nothing more than to get its three seniors another couple
of wins. The Cardinal is looking for something else this
weekend, too.
Fans.
"We need lots of support," said Hewko, expressing dis
appointment at the low turnout the Cardinal women have
had at games this season.
"It's really fun having a crowd and being able to show
case what you've been working on," Watkins said. "It's nice
to see all the local people in local Palo Alto that are inter
ested in water polo, but it's cool to see your fellow students."
Friday's game against Cal begins at 7 p.m. and Saturday's
matchup against Pacific begins at 12 p.m.
