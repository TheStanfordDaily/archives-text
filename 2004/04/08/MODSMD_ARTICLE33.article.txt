## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
In an effort to strengthen its pro
gram in Internet and intellectual prop
erty law, the Stanford School of Law
has lured Prof. Mark Lemley away
from UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall
School of Law where he currently
serves as co-director of the Berkeley
Center for Law and Technology.
Stanford Law School Dean Kath
leen Sullivan offered Lemley a full
time faculty position in January fol
lowing his fall-quarter term as a visit
ing professor. While on campus, he
taught two classes, "Intellectual Prop
erty: Patents and Intellectual Proper
ty" and "Antitrust Law." He accepted

Sullivan's offer in February and will as
sume his new position as the director
of the Stanford Program in Law, Sci
ence and Technology in June.
There are a number of things dri
ving my decision — the opportunity to
work with some wonderful colleagues
and students at Stanford and geogra
phy are prominent among them,"
Lemley said. His wife, Rose Hagan,
works as trademark counsel for
Mountain View-based Google Inc. He
was also offered visiting professorship
positions at Harvard and Yale but
turned them down.
"As a Stanford graduate, it's nice to
be coming home," he added. "It was a
hard decision because I've been very
happy at Berkeley, but my colleagues

there have been very understanding
and I will continue to work closely with
them."
At Stanford, Lemley said he hopes
to strengthen the University's pro
gram in patent, intellectual property
and Internet law. In this endeavor he
will join law professors Paul Goldberg
and Lawrence Lessig, who was left
Harvard in 2000 to strengthen Stan
ford's scholarship in cyberlaw.
"Stanford's focus has been more on
Internet and electronic commerce
than intellectual property per se,"
Lemley said. "I hope to change that by
emphasizing patent law."
He will replace Law Prof. Mar
garet Jane Radin as the director of
the Stanford Program in Law, Sci

ence and Technology, which serves
as an umbrella organization linking
several programs, including the
Center for Internet and Society,
the Center for Electronic Com
merce and the new Center for Law
and the Biosciences.
"Stanford's program is already
great, but I hope that we can build on
that strength, in part my hiring young
faculty who work in law and technolo
gy and in part by emphasizing our ties
to the surrounding community," Lem
ley said. "Stanford is ideally situated at
the heart of Silicon Valley and there is
no reason we shouldn't be able to build
the preeminent program in this field in
the world."
Although some question has

been raised as to whether Stanford
stole Lemley away from Boalt, his
Berkeley colleagues appear to hold
no animosity.
"We expect that Boalt Hall will
continue to look for talented young
and senior scholars in the law and tech
nology field to join the faculty, as it has
always done," said Peter Menell, exec
utive director of the Berkeley Center
for Law and Technology. "We fully
expect to continue to work with Mark
and others in the Bay Area and na
tionally on this salient area of law and
public policy."
Lemley graduated from Stanford
in 1988 with a bachelor's in economics
and political science. He went on to at
tend law school at Boalt, receiving his

degree in 1991. After working in the
field for three years, he turned to acad
emia, earning his professorship at the
University of Texas School of Law. He
started working at Boalt in 2000 and
signed on as an intellectual property
and antitrust counsel for San Francisco
law firm Kreker and Van Nest, where
he will continue to spend 15 to 20 per
cent of his time.
"We have great respect for
Berkeley's work in this area...so we
are especially pleased to have lured
Lemley to our side of the Bay," Sul
livan said in the Law School press re
lease. "He no doubt will continue his
scholarly interchange with col
leagues throughout the Valley and
the Bay Area."
