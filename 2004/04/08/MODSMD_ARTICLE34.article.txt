# University computer programmers tie for 13th

### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford programmers recently
took advantage of their opportunity
to shine on the global stage. On
March 31, a steam of Stanford stu
dents tied for 13th place at the 28th
Annual ACM International Colle
giate Programming Contest World
Finals, sponsored by IBM.
The contest ran from March 28 to
April 1 in Prague. It featured a selec
tion of some of the top undergradu
ate institutions across the world.
There were a total of 3,150 teams se
lected from 1,411 universities in 75
countries competing at 127 sites.
From that pool, 73 teams from 31
countries earned spots on the World
Finals roster.
"One of the major highlights of
the competition is that students get

to come together from all over the
world to meet up and show their
passion for problem-solving," said
Gabby Silberman, program direc
tor of IBM Centers for Advanced
Studies. "The event is a multi-cul
tural experience."
The competition, which actual
ly took place on March 30, gave
students five hours to solve 10
computer programming problems,
forcing them to rely on strategy,
intuition and endurance. The
problems forced students to devel
op efficient algorithms on a diffi
culty level similar to that of a typi
cal computer science course. All
73 teams were timed and were
ranked on their ability to finish the
most problems with the least
amount of errors.
The top team was the St. Peters
burg Institute of Fine Mechanics and

Optics followed by the KTH Royal
Institute of Technology located in
Stockholm, Sweden. Third place
went to Belarusian State University
located in Perm, Russia. MIT placed
the highest of all U.S. schools, finish
ing fifth overall. Two other Ameri
can schools — Cal Tech and Har
vard — placed ahead of Stanford,
finishing in seventh and ninth place,
respectively.
The Stanford team actually com
pleted five of the 10 problems, the
same amount of problems as the
sixth place team, but was penalized
for submitting erroneous answers.
The Stanford team consisted of
senior Chuong (Tom) Do, junior
Gary Huang and sophomore Andy
Lutomirski. Do had previous experi
ence in the competition — he was
part of the team that placed fifth
2002 contest.

The trio of programmers attrib
uted their success to cooperation.
"Indeed, teamwork was critical to
our success — while one person was
busy typing at the terminal, another
person would be busy preparing so
lutions to contest problems on
paper," Do said.
The contest has grown consider
ably over the last few years, especial
ly since IBM started sponsoring it
four years ago. It is now considered
one of — if not the — top contest for
engineering and science students in
the world.
"The contest has quadrupled its
participation in the last seven years,"
Silberman said.
The team qualified for the world
contest by finishing in second at the
regional competition. The top two
teams from the regional competition
earned the trip to Prague.
