### ANNY LIN 
The beginning of spring quarter
not only means flowers blooming
around campus and spontaneous
Frisbee games in FloMo field, but
it also conjures thoughts of smash
ing cars and barbeques held by fra
ternities as they recruit the new
pledge class.
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
Rush was kicked off this past Sunday
with a meeting at the Elliot Pro
gramming Center. There, prospec
tive rushees were informed of the
Rush process and were introduced
to the seven housed and eight un
housed fraternities on campus.
"The goal of fraternities during
Rush is to find a pledge class con
sisting of men that are a good fit for
the chapter," said IFC President
Nate Hennings.
Rush continues with a series of

Open Houses over a period of two
weeks where, not only do fraternities
get to know prospective members,
but rushees are also able to get a feel
for the different fraternities and de
cide if they want to pledge and where
they would be comfortable.
"I want to check it all out and see
that I'm not missing out on any
thing," freshman Cliff Gray said.
"So far, it's been a great opportuni
ty to meet the guys and get to know
the frats."
Often these Open Houses carry a
theme, such as Kappa Alpha's Casi
no Night and Delta Kappa Epsilon's
Smashy Smashy, a unique event
where rushees smash an old car on
Wilbur basketball courts.
"The goal is to create an environ
ment where people can hang out and
get to meet each other," said Jerry
Lu. IFC Recruitment Co-Chair.
â€¢ Rush is a really informal, low pres
sure event."

The fraternities also find that this
informal format for Rush is ideal in
meeting their prospective recruits.
"We have found in the past that
our strongest members have come
from the most unexpected places,"
said Brandon Tyree, SAE Rush Co-
Chair. "We feel that an all-encom
passing rush ensures that we will
find the most suitable members for
our house."
According to Lu, each fraternity
is allowed to conduct two Open
Houses each week and the IFC over
sees and coordinates Rush to ensure
that the number of events on each
night of a week is balanced and that
the entire Rush process goes
smoothly.
During the weekends, fraterni
ties also have the opportunity to
hold open day events and invite
only trips off-campus where they
further acquaint themselves with
prospective recruits.
