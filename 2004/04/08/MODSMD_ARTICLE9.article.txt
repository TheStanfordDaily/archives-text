# New label for fat
## Unsaturated, saturated and trans-what? 
### LAUREN GONG GUEST COLUMNIST 
Walking through the snack aisle at any supermar
ket, you'd be quickly convinced that fat is the nation's
ultimate enemy: "Low-fat," "reduced-fat" and "fat
free" labels stand out brightly from the packaging of
cookies, chips, ice-cream — even foods you always
knew were fat-free have these labels in order to hook
unsuspecting customers.
Recently, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has set a new regulation on food producers re
quiring that by the year 2006, all food packaging must
be labeled with a new fat label, listing the percentage
of trans-fats in a product.
Trans-fats are formed through a process known as
hydrogenation, which reconfigures the hydrogen
bonds (in a "trans" formation, hence the name) in a
fatty acid to make the fat more stable and solid at
room temperature. Liquid oils can be turned into
shortening and hard margarine. Trans-fats can be
found in many processed products: cookies, crackers,
fried foods, baked items and many other types of
snack foods.
Trans-fats are not easy to recognize — you cannot
distinguish their taste in foods — and they are in thou
sands of processed products. The FDA estimates that
people in the United States consume about 5.8 grams
of trans-fats every day.
Studies show that not only does trans-fat clog and
harden arteries, acting in a similar way as saturated
fat, but that it also neutralizes the effect of good fats,
such as the omega-3 fatty acids. The consumption of
trans-fats increases the levels of LDL cholesterol (the
bad kind), increasing a person's risk of heart attack.
Given that heart disease kills someone every 34 sec
onds, having trans-fat in our food is a major public
health concern.
Not only is this an issue of mortality, but it is also
one of the factors leading to an unnecessary increase
in healthcare expenditures. In 2003, California in
curred three billion dollars in healthcare costs due to
obesity and heart disease.
The FDA's labeling campaign is aimed to inform
consumers who will make smart choices: The agency
hopes that if trans-fats are conspicuously labeled,
people will adjust their buying habits and force cor
porations to change. Consumer pressure can indeed
be a strong market-driving force, but the government
cannot rely on corporations to be the nation's nutri
tionists. Reliance on consumers to change their pref
erences may fail to work when the average American
has no idea of the dangers of trans-fats. Warning la
bels may help, but with foods already containing
plenty of flashy "low-cholesterol," "low-carb," "high
in vitamins" and other labels, another sticker will
only add to the confusion consumers face when doing
their daily grocery runs.
Ideally, foods would contain no trans-fats. While
large food companies balk at the idea of having to re
formulate thousands of recipes, some have already
begun to take this important step: Frito-Lays, one of
America's largest food distributors, is an example of a
successful company that has cut trans-fat out of the
majority of its products. Their new "Edge" brand,
boasting three billion dollars in projected revenue,
has zero trans-fat. While Frito-Lay demonstrates it is
definitely feasible to produce trans-fat free products,
they are not the norm in the food industry.
While content labeling is definitely necessary, it is
not in any way sufficient. The FDA needs to take
more responsibility for the nation's health. Trans-fats
are a serious health concern, and it is the responsibili
ty of the FDA to not just point this fact out, but to get
it out of our diets.
