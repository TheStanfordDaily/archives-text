CALL FOR NOMINATIONS
for the
PHI BETA KAPPA
TEACHING PRIZE
The Stanford Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa is currently soliciting nominations for this year's Phi Beta Kappa Teaching
Prize. The prize recognizes not only excellence in teaching but also the ability to inspire personal and intellectual
development beyond the classroom. This may include, but is not limited to, the five criteria listed below, which dis
tinguish teachers who challenge student perspectives of the world.
* Interdisdplinarity *
A teacher should approach the material from a variety of theories and perspectives and establish
connections across and between disciplines.
* Accessibility *
A teacher should endeavor to know students as people, with interests, ideas, and plans for the future by
encouraging individual exchanges through office hours and open-door policies.
* Innovation *
A teacher should challenge students with original projects, creative assignments, and outside resources.
* Brood World Vision *
A teacher should encourage students to think about how course material applies to and affects the real
world, inspiring students to keep thinking about the material when they walk out of the classroom.
* Teaching as a Learning Experience *
A teacher should view teaching as a two-way exchange and a mutually engaging active learning process.
