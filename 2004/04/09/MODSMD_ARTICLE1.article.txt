### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Touching on issues ranging from the
current ASSU election tocheerleading,
humorist Mo Rocca spoke to a crowd
ed Kresge Auditorium last night in a
special ASSU Speakers Bureau event.
He also addressed topics of diversity in
television comedy, his hobby of visiting
the graves of obscure presidents and
contemporary politics.

Rocca kicked off his talk with a
PowerPoint presentation and several
video clips.
"It all started when I was 11," he
began, calling up a photograph of Al
catraz. "I said to myself, people in
prison are different. I wanted to be dif
ferent too."
Rocca described his journey
through college and beyond, including

Comedian Mo Rocca, former correspondent for 'The Doily Shaw" with John Stewart
cracked up a crowd at Kresge last night and signed autographs for fans.
his study of kabuki theatre in
Japan, experiences as a roller
skating waiter, participation
in a production of "Grease" in
Jakarta and work at an adult
magazine. He also showed
photographs of democratic
presidential candidates, in
cluding Dick Gephardt, "the
first albino candidate," and
John Edwards, "the first four
teen-year-old candidate," pic
tured with his mother.
"I think too much of poli
tics is superficial," Rocca
opined, flipping between two
similar shots of John Kerry
and a bulldog.
Speaking about "The Daily
Show," where he worked as a
correspondent, Rocca said
that the most fruitful source of
news-comedy was the "unctu
ous nodding" and "Dateline
like gravitas" of many news
magazines that "create danger
out of mundane events."
Rocca highlighted this
point with a short clip from the
show, which featured him
going undercover at a cheer
leading camp and investigat
ing "the grueling, ultra-com
petitive bloodsport that is
cheerleading today."
In the clip, Rocca visited
a slumber party, uncovered
the abuse of Mountain Dew
for cheerleader "pep" and
traced the illicit use of "a
performance-enhancing
substance known on the
street as 'glitter.""

"Performing in a piece like
this is the most carefree and
fun. At "The Daily Show,"
when we make fun of the news
media, we're really making
fun of ourselves too," he said.
Rocca also recalled the
presidential election of 2000,
which he labeled a "turning
point" for"The Daily Show."
"Suddenly we were cover
ing a story that everyone else
was covering. The mission
was flipped: We had to find
another way to cover it,"he
said. "Catching big-name
politicians off-guard was par
ticularly delicious."
After the talk, Rocca also
took comments from the au
dience, which included an
invitation to a Passover
Party, and questions about
rivalry between his "Daily
Show" colleagues.
One student asked if Rocca
had any siblings, another
asked if he was married.
"Depends on who's ask
ing," Rocca replied.
Rocca also commented
about the diversity among his
colleagues at "The Daily
Show," and on television com
edy shows in general.
"I don't know what it is,"
Rocca said. "I think that un
fortunately, comedy is still a
boy's club. The writing staffs
are totally male."
Rocca also brought up
the issue of lampooning cor
porations and corporate
sponsors.
"There would be so many
sponsors not to offend," he
said, when asked about the
possibility of moving "The

Daily Show" to another net
work. "You really are urged to
stay away from them."
Another student asked
Rocca how he fights the urge
to laugh during filming.
"An inner darkness,"
Rocca quipped. "The less in
teresting answer is that fora
three-minute piece, you're
usually shooting for about
three hours. You're not real
ly in the moment that much."
Speaking about Al
Franken's newly-launched
liberal talk-radio program,
Rocca said, "If he is saying,
'I'm going to be funny for
three hours a day,' I think it's
going to be really hard."
Rocca's popularity was
made apparent after the event
by the students lined up for
autographs — especially his
female fans.
"Mo Rocca was even hot
ter than he is on 'The Daily
Show'," said sophomore Nina
Acuna. "Thank God I was sit
ting in the front row. His pants
were tight, literally tight, in all
the right places."
Vinita Kailasanath, di
rector of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, praised Rocca's
ability to appeal to many
students.
"We look fora balance:
men and women, tech speak
ers, world leaders, people
from arts and entertainment,"
she said. "We had a very suc
cessful comedian [Saturday
Night Live's Darryl Ham
mond) last year, and we though
it would be great to have some
one who could really connect
tp college audiences."

opined, flipping between two

Speaking about "The Daily
Show," where he worked as a
correspondent, Rocca said
that the most fruitful source of
news-comedy was the "unctu
ous nodding" and "Dateline
like gravitas" of many news
magazines that "create danger
out of mundane events."
Rocca highlighted this
point with a short clip from the
show, which featured him
going undercover at a cheer
leading camp and investigat
ing "the grueling, ultra-com
petitive bloodsport that is
cheerleading today."
In the clip, Rocca visited
a slumber party, uncovered
the abuse of Mountain Dew
for cheerleader "pep" and
traced the illicit use of "a
performance-enhancing
substance known on the
street as 'glitter.""

"Performing in a piece like
this is the most carefree and
fun. At "The Daily Show,"
when we make fun of the news
media, we're really making
fun of ourselves too," he said.
Rocca also recalled the
presidential election of 2000,
which he labeled a "turning
point" for"The Daily Show."
"Suddenly we were cover
ing a story that everyone else
was covering. The mission
was flipped: We had to find
another way to cover it,"he
said. "Catching big-name
politicians off-guard was par
ticularly delicious."
After the talk, Rocca also
took comments from the au
dience, which included an
invitation to a Passover
Party, and questions about
rivalry between his "Daily
Show" colleagues.
One student asked if Rocca
had any siblings, another
asked if he was married.
"Depends on who's ask
ing," Rocca replied.
Rocca also commented
about the diversity among his
colleagues at "The Daily
Show," and on television com
edy shows in general.
"I don't know what it is,"
Rocca said. "I think that un
fortunately, comedy is still a
boy's club. The writing staffs
are totally male."
Rocca also brought up
the issue of lampooning cor
porations and corporate
sponsors.
"There would be so many
sponsors not to offend," he
said, when asked about the
possibility of moving "The

Daily Show" to another net
work. "You really are urged to
stay away from them."
Another student asked
Rocca how he fights the urge
to laugh during filming.
"An inner darkness,"
Rocca quipped. "The less in
teresting answer is that fora
three-minute piece, you're
usually shooting for about
three hours. You're not real
ly in the moment that much."
Speaking about Al
Franken's newly-launched
liberal talk-radio program,
Rocca said, "If he is saying,
'I'm going to be funny for
three hours a day,' I think it's
going to be really hard."
Rocca's popularity was
made apparent after the event
by the students lined up for
autographs — especially his
female fans.
"Mo Rocca was even hot
ter than he is on 'The Daily
Show'," said sophomore Nina
Acuna. "Thank God I was sit
ting in the front row. His pants
were tight, literally tight, in all
the right places."
Vinita Kailasanath, di
rector of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, praised Rocca's
ability to appeal to many
students.
"We look fora balance:
men and women, tech speak
ers, world leaders, people
from arts and entertainment,"
she said. "We had a very suc
cessful comedian [Saturday
Night Live's Darryl Ham
mond) last year, and we though
it would be great to have some
one who could really connect
tp college audiences."
Touching on issues ranging from the
current ASSU election tocheerleading,

ed Kresge Auditorium last night in a
special ASSU Speakers Bureau event.
He also addressed topics of diversity in

Rocca kicked off his talk with a
PowerPoint presentation and several
video clips.
"It all started when I was 11," he
