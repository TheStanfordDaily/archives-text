## Not your ordinary frat girls 
### 
For years we've had scores of brilliant and insightful thoughts
and ideas that we felt we needed to share with the student body.
When we finally decided to make them public, we debated be
tween two options: We could either send a mass e-mail to 11,746
students, or we could write a column in The Daily with a reader
ship of many more.
As tempting as the e-mail idea was, we decided to go with the
column in order to reach a broader audience. We knew that in
the end those Chappie guys would find us out anyway. If only
they had been on the case of the "Serial Groper" — it would
have bettered the lives of dozens of young women across the
Stanford community.

Which brings us to our topic:
Girls Gone Wild — Sorority Re
cruitment 2004. Non-sorority girls,
that is. We were definitely enjoy
ing the benefits of the completely
off-balance male to female ratio at
P*b Night and frat parties this past
weekend. In fact, we think Recruit
ment should take place every week.
It's every non-sorority girl's dream.
Despite the fun we had last
weekend, the complete lack of girls
out on campus got us thinking

about the specifics of Sorority Recruitment. When you compare
the sorority and fraternity rushing processes, it's obvious that
there are some inequalities in terms of time, formality and inten
sity, and the hardships fall on sororities.
This is not a Stanford-specific problem —sororities across the
country must abide by Inter-Sorority Council and national regu
lations for the "intensive four-day series of structured events that
[Prospective Members] will attend in order to meet and converse
with sorority members," according to Stanford's ISC Web site.
Compare this intense, rigidly structured program to fraternity
Rush. Jerry Lu, Inter-Fraternity Council Recruitment co-chair,
told The Daily on Thursday that "Rush is a really informal, low
pressure event." Fraternities hold bi-weekly Open Houses in
their residences, or elsewhere for un-housed groups, and only
those interested in rushing that particular fraternity are required
to show up to the event. Sorority Recruitment demands that all
prospective members go to every sorority's Open House, or risk
being dropped from Recruitment altogether.
In addition, sororities have strict rules surrounding the Re
cruitment process, such as regulations on what the ISC calls
"Dirty Recruiting": "In the effort to make Recruitment fair,
sorority members are prohibited to speak with Prospective Mem
bers outside of Recruitment during the Formal Recruitment peri
od." Stanford's ISC warns Prospective Members that because of
this rule, it shouldn't come as a surprise when sorority members com
pletely ignore them around campus before and during Recruitment.
What we don't understand is: why the strict regulations for
girls, but not for guys? Girls as well as guys would be equally en
tertained by watching computer monitors and exercise equip
ment be thrown off a balcony (as the Nu Kids on the Block did
earlier this week, proving that they fully deserve their housed sta
tus). We wouldn't mind taking a bat to a piece-of-shit car, either,
a DKE tradition at Stanford. In fact, there's not a single aspect of
Rush that we wouldn't prefer to the excruciation of sorority Re
cruitment, and we don't think we're alone.
We've heard, "I'd love to be in a frat," come out of more
than one girl's mouth. What us "frat girls" mean by this is not sit
ting around with a bunch of guys, drinking beer and watching
porn. (Don't get us wrong, we enjoy a good dark beer and an oc
casional skin flick). Rather, we mean that many girls would like
to be involved in that kind of fun, loose camaraderie, live in a
house where you can actually serve alcohol and throw parties
with your "sisters" and break expensive electronic equipment
every now and then.
It could just be that Greek life isn't for everyone; frats cer
tainly are not perfect either. While it's great to be able to host par
ties in one's house, it comes with great responsibility and high risk
of being put on probation. All of the housed fraternities at Stan
ford have been on probation at one time or another, and frats are
routinely (though less frequently) kicked out of housing.
This is no attack on Stanford's sorority girls, because it's cer
tainly not their fault. Sororities nationwide are forced to abide by
stringent, antiquated, sexist rules, and until something happens
on a large scale. Pi Phizzle is still going to have to throw its parties
at ZAP. Perhaps Third Wave Feminism should target reform of
these archaic restrictions on sororities and give women the option
of being the frat girls they are deep inside.

We've heard, "I'd love to be in a frat," come out of more
than one girl's mouth. What us "frat girls" mean by this is not sit
ting around with a bunch of guys, drinking beer and watching
porn. (Don't get us wrong, we enjoy a good dark beer and an oc
casional skin flick). Rather, we mean that many girls would like
to be involved in that kind of fun, loose camaraderie, live in a
house where you can actually serve alcohol and throw parties
with your "sisters" and break expensive electronic equipment
every now and then.
It could just be that Greek life isn't for everyone; frats cer
tainly are not perfect either. While it's great to be able to host par
ties in one's house, it comes with great responsibility and high risk
of being put on probation. All of the housed fraternities at Stan
ford have been on probation at one time or another, and frats are
routinely (though less frequently) kicked out of housing.
This is no attack on Stanford's sorority girls, because it's cer
tainly not their fault. Sororities nationwide are forced to abide by
stringent, antiquated, sexist rules, and until something happens
on a large scale. Pi Phizzle is still going to have to throw its parties
at ZAP. Perhaps Third Wave Feminism should target reform of
these archaic restrictions on sororities and give women the option
of being the frat girls they are deep inside.

For years we've had scores of brilliant and insightful thoughts
and ideas that we felt we needed to share with the student body.
When we finally decided to make them public, we debated be
tween two options: We could either send a mass e-mail to 11,746
students, or we could write a column in The Daily with a reader
ship of many more.
As tempting as the e-mail idea was, we decided to go with the
column in order to reach a broader audience. We knew that in
the end those Chappie guys would find us out anyway. If only
they had been on the case of the "Serial Groper" — it would
have bettered the lives of dozens of young women across the
Stanford community.

Which brings us to our topic:
Girls Gone Wild — Sorority Re
cruitment 2004. Non-sorority girls,
that is. We were definitely enjoy
ing the benefits of the completely
off-balance male to female ratio at
P*b Night and frat parties this past
weekend. In fact, we think Recruit
ment should take place every week.
It's every non-sorority girl's dream.
Despite the fun we had last
weekend, the complete lack of girls
out on campus got us thinking

about the specifics of Sorority Recruitment. When you compare
the sorority and fraternity rushing processes, it's obvious that
there are some inequalities in terms of time, formality and inten
sity, and the hardships fall on sororities.
This is not a Stanford-specific problem —sororities across the
country must abide by Inter-Sorority Council and national regu
lations for the "intensive four-day series of structured events that
[Prospective Members] will attend in order to meet and converse
with sorority members," according to Stanford's ISC Web site.
Compare this intense, rigidly structured program to fraternity
Rush. Jerry Lu, Inter-Fraternity Council Recruitment co-chair,
told The Daily on Thursday that "Rush is a really informal, low
pressure event." Fraternities hold bi-weekly Open Houses in
their residences, or elsewhere for un-housed groups, and only
those interested in rushing that particular fraternity are required
to show up to the event. Sorority Recruitment demands that all
prospective members go to every sorority's Open House, or risk
being dropped from Recruitment altogether.
In addition, sororities have strict rules surrounding the Re
cruitment process, such as regulations on what the ISC calls
"Dirty Recruiting": "In the effort to make Recruitment fair,
sorority members are prohibited to speak with Prospective Mem
bers outside of Recruitment during the Formal Recruitment peri
od." Stanford's ISC warns Prospective Members that because of
this rule, it shouldn't come as a surprise when sorority members com
pletely ignore them around campus before and during Recruitment.
What we don't understand is: why the strict regulations for
girls, but not for guys? Girls as well as guys would be equally en
tertained by watching computer monitors and exercise equip
ment be thrown off a balcony (as the Nu Kids on the Block did
earlier this week, proving that they fully deserve their housed sta
tus). We wouldn't mind taking a bat to a piece-of-shit car, either,
a DKE tradition at Stanford. In fact, there's not a single aspect of
Rush that we wouldn't prefer to the excruciation of sorority Re
cruitment, and we don't think we're alone.
