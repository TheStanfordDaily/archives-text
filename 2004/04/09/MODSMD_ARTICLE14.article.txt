## Delay of election results is good 
### 
The ASSU elections results in previous
years were announced as soon as they
had been tabulated — usually around
one or two in the morning, a couple of
hours after voting ended. This year, however,
both the candidates and the general Stanford
community must wait until 5 p.m. this after
noon for the announcement of winners. This
extra wait, though understandably unnerving
for candidates, is ultimately beneficial for an
elections process plagued with troubles in the
recent past.
Last year, technical errors permitted some
students who were not rising seniors to vote in
the election for Senior Class president. The
subsequent results were very close and the en
tire election was thrown into question. Some
voters felt disenfranchised, according to Elec
tions Commissioner Ellie Martin. The win
ners, though announced two hours after voting
ended, were not confirmed for several days.
Following this controversy, ASSU senators
met and agreed upon an informal suggestion that
the Elections Commission impose a 48-hour an
nouncement delay in the future. This would give
votes time to be called into question if it ap
peared that technical glitches impeded Stan
ford's democratic processes. This year, no tech
nical errors had been discovered as of press time,
and the Elections Commission did not foresee
any Internet problems like those of last year.

contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

The Commission made greater efforts to ensure
that the ballot's Web site coding was accurate.
Still, the time buffer seems a wise move, as
glitches tend to be unforeseeable and the drawn
out drama and continuing doubts regarding last
year's results are both highly undesirable.
Indeed, this year's controversy surrounding
campaign misconduct is further proof that
ASSU elections are far from perfect and that
the hasty announcement of results immediate
ly following the close of voting could result in
numerous headaches for the Elections Com
mission and further disillusionment among stu
dents. Though waiting a mere 17 hours after
the balloting ends will likely not provide time
to thoroughly investigate campaign miscon
duct, it will give commissioners time to decide
if the results are fair and what to do about them
if they are not. After all, the announcement can
always be pushed back, but once an announce
ment is made, heated debates will ensue and
the commission must be adequately prepared
to defend its decision.
We sincerely hope that everything will go
smoothly and that the results will be success
fully and accurately announced today at 5
p.m. We are relieved that they were not an
nounced last night, a move that hopefully will
allow the student body to at least avoid the se
vere problems that plagued last year's elec
tions process.
