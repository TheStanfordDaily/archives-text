## Is gay marriage a civil rights issue? 
### 
As the national debate over
gay marriage continues, it is
clear that the issue will be a
divisive one in the upcoming
presidential election. African-Ameri
cans, historical supporters of the Demo
cratic Party, are being courted by Repub
liains and the religious right. These groups
are trying to capitalize on the outrage felt
by many blacks over compansons of gays'
fight for the right to marry with the Civil
Rights movement of the 1 %()s.
Arguments given against the legaliza
tion of gay marriage share the same tone,
bias and ignorance of arguments against
miscegenation and desegregation given in
the 1950s and 19605. The same social and
legal tabu* prevailed then against interra
cial marriage as do now against gay mar
riage. The taboos in both cases are moral
istic at their core and based on deeply-held
beliefs about inferiority and abnormality.
It frustrates me to read arguments against
gay marriage that parallel so closely old ar
guments against interracial marriage.
These arguments leave me to wonder how
many cloaks of a different color such dis
crimination can wear before it is unveiled.
The civil rights movement of the 1960s
certainly has its differences from the light
today for gay rights. The experience of gay
Americans and black Americans across
the centuries has been patently different
Gays in America never experienced slav
ery or segregation. Blacks could not keep
their identity hidden. The images invoked
when speaking of gay rights do not typical
ly include those we associate with the 1960s
civil rights movement: police bearing
down cxi peaceful marcher* and protesters
with sticks, water hoses and dogs; large
scale sit-ins; young black students jeered
and harassed as they attempt to navigate
large white crowds just barely held back by
federal police... Many black Americans
object to gays paralleling Hack civil rights

struggles precisely because they do not
think gays have undergone or are under
going half of the oppression, violence or
struggle that they or their parents experi
enced. But is anything gained by creating a
hierarchy of oppression? It is true, after all,
that gay Americans have been jailed, phys
ically attacked, killed, blackmailed, psy
chologically intimidated, fired and perse
cuted for their sexual orientation.
At the heart of the controversy is the
question. Is gay marriage a civil rights
issue? I agree with former Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who wrote in the landmark
1967 Loving vs. Virginia case in which the
Supreme Court struck down anti-misce
genation laws: "The freedom to marry has
long been recognized as one of the vital
personal rights essential to the orderly pur
suit of happiness by free men. Marriage is
one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' funda
mental to our very existence and survival."
At the time of the controversial rul
ing, many Americans felt that marriage
and procreation between members of
different races was unnatural and un
godly. The Virginiajudge who presided
over the Lovings' 1959 trial in which
they were charged with violating the
state's ban on interracial marriage said:
"Almighty God created the races
white, black, yellow, malay and red,
and he placed them on separate conti
nents. And but for the interference with
his arrangement there would be no
cause for such marriages. The fact that
he separated the races shows that he
did not intend for the races to mix."
Today, many Americans feel simikuly
about gay relationships —that they are
unnatural and decried by God And de
spite evidence that sexiuil orientation is
largely genetically determined, and that
homosexual behavior exists in other pri
mate and non-primate species, many still
chixise to believe that sexual orientation is

a choice. Boston bishop Gilbert Thomp
son said in March, "I was born black...
Homosexuals are not bom, they're made."
Still, many argue that civil rights pro
tection is meant for people, not behavior,
regardless of whether the tendency for
that behavior is genetic or not. Aggres
sion may be largely genetic. Should we
give special rights to perpetrators of vio
lent crimes? Such a question illustrates
the absurdity of the "behavior" argu
ment given by many gay marriage dissi
dents. Sure, sexual preference can be
kept hidden. But should it have to be?
Saying that equal rights are for peo
ple. not behavior, suggests that this be
havior needn't be practiced, implying its
immorality. It is akin to suggesting that
heterosexuals needn't have sex. Sure,
they don't have to. But is it fair to ask
them not to, or is it likely to happen?
Some dissenters say they support civil
unions between gays, which provide all the
same rights and privileges as marriage. This
argument reeksof the "separate but equal"
doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson, which up
held segregation — which we long ago de
termined could never really be equal.
When it comes to marriage, the
same applies: Even if gays are given the
same legal rights and privileges through
civil unions, a civil union is still not
equal to marriage.
Marriage implicitly provides a cer
tain validation of love and self that no
other institution can, and until that right
is provided to gays, they will remain
second-class citizens.
