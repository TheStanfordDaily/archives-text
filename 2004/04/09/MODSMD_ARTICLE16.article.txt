# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Can you find the 'ass' in ASSU? 
### 
The ASSU elections never fail
to amuse me. The Chappie's
decision to run is an exercise
of comedic brilliance. I consis
tently vote for them in the top two —
and certainly not because they repre
sent the only all-white slate with ashot at
winning. Why do I want them to win?
It's like asking a fourth grader why he
decapitated a chicken (by accident) in
his grandmother's barn when no one
was looking. I want to see what hap
pens. There is security in knowing that
The Chappie will secede in the case that
the majority of students think the same
way I do — but wouldn't the initial cel
ebration be fantastic?
This year, 1 only cast two votes. My
first choice went to Stockman / Henick
of the Chappie's slate, of course. My
second choice was a write-in for Stock
man / Henick, fora goof, 1 guess. The
difference between this year and others
is that I actually want them to keep the
job if they win. As odd as it may sound,
the joke ticket (no offense, guys) ran the
most tactful campaign in the whole elec
tion. Not only did they resist stooping to
smear tactics or endorsing themselves
in mass e-mails, but they also got to the
bottom of that mysterious @yahoo.com
campaign vigilante. Thank you, boys,
you've done well. I appreciate any effort
to take the "ass" out of ASSU. At the
time of writing this, I don't know what
the outcome of the election will be, but
please, if you win. take the job. I mean,
how hard can the ASSU president / vice
president job be?
I remember when 1 began regarding
the ASSU presidential election as tom
foolery. In my sophomore year, I was in

terested enough to attend the debates
and listen to the candidates. That was the
year Michael Osofsky and Meghan Root

ran together. There
was another slate
that 1 was planning
on voting for, but I
wanted to hear
what all candidates
had to say. I gritted
my teeth through a
debate full of irrele
vant questions like
one directed at Os
ofsky — "What
work have you done
for minorities?"

I couldn't ignore the disapproving
murmur among the audience after he
gave an account of volunteering for
soup kitchens in New Orleans. I felt I
was the only audience member willing
to accept that as a sufficient response.
Call me ignorant, but 1 don't see why
diversity is always at the forefront of
the ASSU presidential debate. Unlike
campus livelihood, diversity is some
thing the administration does well. 1
think ASSU elections needlessly spike
the campus racial tension-o-meter
each year. I just don't know why.
Anyway. I left the CoHo that day as
disappointed in the conduct of my fel
low students for jeering Osofsky with
no apparent basis in anything he'd ac
tually done or said as I was when "Po
litically Incorrect with Bill Maher"
came to Dinkelspiel and somebody
mocked a gentleman from the Hoover
Institute for the size of his eyebrows.
The eyebrows were humongous and it
was a hilarious comment, but come on.

There's even more ridiculousness in
the special-fees controversy. 1 have
asked for partial refunds every quarter
that I've known how to do so, and I
don't appreciate the ASSU demoniz
ing me for it. Am I unpatriotic for tak
ing a few bucks back from a handful of
campus groups? I think in some situa
tions it is reasonable to ask them to do
their own fundraising, or at least expect
them to do more than just sit back and
passively make withdrawals from my
bank account. Most of the groups that I
belong do not get special fees.
For example, I have been in a rock
band for almost two years. We receive
little in terms of logistical support.
Should I feel guilty for taking $4 from
an a capella group — which charges me
to attend shows and has a significant ad
vantage over my band in scoring re
hearsal space — to offset the costs of
buying guitars, strings, amplifiers, ca
bles, PA systems, flyers, microphones,
etc. so that my band can play gigs that
are usually unpaid and that students are
never charged to attend?
If your group wants to rock the spe
cial-fees vote, then that's cool with me.
Just don't whine when 1 take my
money back to offset the thousands of
dollars I've poured into my own activi
ties that wouldn't see a dime of special
fees if we asked for them.
On the other hand, shame on you if you
vote for special fees and then refund them
all. That's like being a deadbeat dad.
