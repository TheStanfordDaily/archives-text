# THE
						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## Unclashing the civilizations

Who do you think you are?
At Stanford, we spend
the first two weeks of
each quarter shopping
classes, choosing from nearly a hun
dred majors. But before approaching
those decisions, we each seek to an
swer the age-old question as we identi
fy the balance of our Stanford careers
— fuzzy or techie?
A similar conflict is underway today
in the Middle East with Iraq as its pri
mary battlefield. While it arrived with
the momentum, the United States has
since ignored the centrality of ideas in
this war and has failed to acknowledge
the necessity of innovative methods
beyond military action.
The hesitancy on the part of the
United States stems from confusion
about what Iraq really represents. As
the body count of U.S. soldiers rises, in
creasing references to Vietnam are
made. But Iraq is not Vietnam. In Viet
nam, the United States intervened in a
national civil war; in Iraq, the United
States brought the fight.
The difference is best described by
Samuel Huntington in his famous arti
cle, "The Clash of Civilizations." Viet
nam was an "ideological conflict, [and]
the key question was which side are you
on?" But Iraq has the potential tospiral
into a "conflict between civilizations,
[where] the question is 'what are you?'"
The mutilation of American civil
ians in Falluja and the recent deaths of
12 Marines in a militia attack orches
trated by Shiite cleric Muktada Al-
Sadr demonstrate that Iraqis may have
an answer to that question. While
American administrators struggle to
cast the attacks as the "evil-doings" of
an extreme minority, the traditionally
more hostile Sunni Muslims have been

joined by growing numbers of Shiites.
Moderate Iraqis are being convinced
that the US is little more than the for-

eign conqueror,
as groups like al-
Qaeda have ac
cused.
For its part, the
United States has
responded with a
stubborn belief in
a back-loaded suc
cess model: We
continue to im-

prove infrastructure and write consti
tutions in the hopes that when all is said
and done, the Iraqi people will thank
us for it. But this strategy only does half
the job — it rebuilds Iraq without re
building its people.
While the United States will most
likely stick to the June 30 deadline to
hand sovereignty over to Iraq, it needs
to ready itself and Iraq for the next
step. Preparing itself for the aftermath
has proved a chronic weakness of
American policy makers in Iraq, the in
famous example being President
Bush's declaration of a 'mission ac
complished" after only the initial phase
of the war was won.
While Iraqis will be officially
"sovereign" on June 30, the U.S. pres
ence in Iraq won't just disappear. The
United States must realize that the fu
ture of Iraq will hang in the balance in
the months following June 30. If the
United States hopes to leave Iraq free
and democratic, it will need to com
plement its military efforts with an all
out culture campaign that starts now.
In order to change the burgeoning
mistrust of the United States, Paul
Bremer 111, ambassador to Iraq,
needs to put soldiers in mosques —

not to desecrate the mosques by wear
ing boots in them during raids, but to
pray side by side with everyday Iraqis.
Bremer needs to make a show of
meeting with moderate Muslim cler
ics from both Shiite and Sunni sects
and make it clear he seeks to learn
more about Islam. He needs to bring
his generals to Iraqi professors to
learn of Iraqi history. And in doing so,
he must bring the worlds photogra
phers to get it all on film.
The message of interest and accep
tance will breed tolerance in Iraq as
well as a reciprocal interest in the
American ideals of democracy and
freedom that we hope to leave behind
when we exit the country of our own
volition — not when fleeing as we did
in Vietnam. Iraqis, like any people, do
not want to be imposed upon. The in
ability of the current administration to
realize this marks the single greatest
failure of the war in Iraq.
What makes America great is not just
military might. U.S. military efforts in
Iraq must be dwarfed by a cultural diplo
macy that seeks to disprove Hunting
ton's prediction of a clash of civilizations.
I know a girl who did it. She is com
pleting her double major in mechani
cal engineering and political science
— not too much overlap there. Twen
ty units a quarter is the kind of work
load that the United States must em
brace between now and June 30 in
order to accomplish its goals in Iraq.
We need realize that it's not only
Iraq's civilization that is in question,
but our own as well.
