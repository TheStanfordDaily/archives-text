## ASSU Elections Commission explains policy for this year's election 
### ELLIE MARTIN 
The Elections Commission would
like to clarify our position on alleged
misconduct related to the ASSU exec
utive slates. Between the time elec
tions began on Wednesday and ended
Thursday at midnight, a number of
campaign violations occurred and
questionable actions were taken by
numerous individuals of varying in
volvement in the elections. Many stu
dents have heard about or received
the flurry of unsolicited, campaign-re
lated e-mails that were sent by a num
ber of different people and groups.
The Elections Commission respond
ed immediately and took the actions
that were within our power under the
ASSU Constitution.

On Thursday, we met with Univer
sity administrators, the current ASSU
/ Graduate Student Council (GSC)
leadership and representatives from
each of the three executive slates.
After discussing the student reaction
to what has transpired in the last two
days, the allegations of campaign vio
lations, and our duties as the Elections
Commission, we decided to recom
mend that the governing bodies certify
the results of the elections.
Some students and The Daily sug
gested that we withhold the election
results until an investigation could be
conducted. Over the past two days,
we thoroughly investigated the alle
gations of misconduct and deter
mined that we have enough informa
tion to make a ruling on the validity of

the election
After completing our investigation,
we determined that the violations
were not sufficiently clear-cut accord
ing to the Campaign Practice Code so
as to merit an action as extreme as dis
qualification. Doing so during the vot
ing period would disenfranchise voters
who already cast votes for the slates
who would be taken off the ballot. We
decided that the risk of disenfranchis
ing large numbers of voters on the
basis of issues that fall within a grey
area outweighed the negative effect of
the violations on the election process.
Some students suggested that the
Elections Commission should nullify
the executive election. However, our
powers under the ASSU Constitution
only allow us to provide a recommen

dation to the Senate and GSC as to
whether or not we feel that they should
certify the election results. The chairs
of both the Senate and GSC have as
sured us that their bodies will carefully
deliberate over the decision to certify
or reject the elections results we will
present to them next week. They will
discuss the certification in public meet
ings, and they invite any students to
share their opinions and make their
voice heard. We as an Elections Com
mission trust the governing bodies
with the decision to certify the elec
tion, and we urge students to share
their concerns with their elected repre
sentatives. Moreover, we contacted
the Office of Judicial Affairs about po
tential violations of the Fundamental
Standard. Other students who feel

they have been negatively impacted by
the campaign violations are encour
aged to file formal Fundamental Stan
dard violation reports with the Office
of Judicial Affairs.
We wish to inform the student body
that all three slates agreed we have
reached an appropriate conclusion.
We take seriously every violation that
has occurred and that we have docu
mented every complaint that we have
received. Along with many concerned
students, the Elections Commission is
disappointed with the conduct of
members of and campaign supporters
of the Lee- Mefford slate in particular.
To a much lesser degree, Husbands-
Schwartz also committed campaign vi
olations. However, we would like to
commend the Stockman-Henick slate,

along with members of the Stanford
Chaparral, who complied with the
Campaign Practices Code and con
tributed positively (and humorously)
to the entire elections process.
The Elections Commission hopes
that despite the controversies that
emerged this week, students will not
allow what has transpired to disillusion
them about the important responsibil
ities of the ASSU executive office. In
stead, we hope that this will encourage
students to become more active partic
ipants in the ASSU. We still welcome
concerns and comments at elec
tions@assu.stanford.edu.

Commissioner. She is a junior majoring
