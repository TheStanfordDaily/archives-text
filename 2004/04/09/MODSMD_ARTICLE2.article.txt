# Commission OKs election
## Preliminary results to be announced tomorrow at CoHo 
### MICHAEL MILLER CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITORS 
After what ASSU Elections Commis
sioner Ellie Martin called one of the most
controversial elections in recent years, the
Commission announced last night that the
results of the election should be certified
despite questionable rule violations. The
tabulated results will be announced at 5
p.m. today at the Coffee House, but will re
main preliminary until they are certified by
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and
Graduate Student Council during their reg
ular meetings.
In the past, election results have been an
nounced at midnight after the polls are
closed. Last year, technical errors spurred
controversy when it was discovered that
some voters had been disenfranchised in the
Senior Class presidential election. Senators
subsequently recommended that future
election results be withheld for 48 hours to
iron out any similar glitches. As a compro
mise, Elections Commission members de

cided to announce the outcome at 5 p.m. the
following day.
An investigation headed by Martin, a ju
nior, took place yesterday, looking into
claims of election misconduct. At the end of
the day, the Commission decided to recom
mend to the Senate and GSC that the elec
tion results should stand.
Vice-presidential candidate Alyssa
Schwartz, a sophomore, said that while she
and junior Ajani Husbands agreed with the
Commission when it reached its decision,
she was less certain in retrospect.
"Looking ahead, I feel that Lee-Mefford
have been unfairly advantaged," she said.
"The results have been tampered with."
Presidential candidate Mikey Lee was
more supportive of the Commission.
"1 think they made the best possible deci
sion they could have," said Lee, a senior.
E-mails in support of the Lee-Mefford
campaign sparked most of the allegations.
"There's no way to make this fair again,"
Lee said. "We can't go back on these e-mails."
Both the Lee-Mefford and Husbands-
Schwartz slates agreed that they would
support the other slate if they lost, but nei
ther would fully commit to not challenging
the results.
"If the Senate chooses not to certify the
results, I'm not saying I wouldn't be in sup
port of that," Schwartz said.
Charlie Stockman and Matthew
Henick could not be reached for comment
late last night.
"We went into the investigation with

three different options," Martin said.
"One option would have been for the com
mission to recommend that they not certi
fy the election results. The commission
can't overturn anything. We just run the
elections and turn the results over to the
governing bodies."
The second option considered was to dis
qualify one to three of the presidential slates
depending on how egregious any rule viola
tions were judged to be.
"We were willing to entertain that option
but after talking to everyone involved, we
weren't comfortable with disqualifying any
one without policies being more black and
white," Martin said.
Elections Commission members eventu
ally chose the third option, which was to
allow the election to stand.
The Office of Judicial Affairs will further
investigate any possible Fundamental Stan
dard violations relating to the election.
Both slates noted that this election will
have repercussions for the reputation of fu
ture elections and for the ASSU itself.
"I will support Mikey and Dylan if they
win and 1 hope they will support us likewise,
but I don't think anyone will be happy with
how it ends up," Schwartz said.
In reaching a decision, commissioners re
viewed e-mails received by students from
presidential slates, e-mails from students
recommending potential courses of action
and the campaign practice bylaws.
"We discussed everything we had found
and what we perceived our own rules and
University policy to he," Martin said.
"The culminating event was to meet
around a table with the slates, the current
president and vice president, the Elec
tions Commission and chairs of govern
ing bodies to talk about the repercussions
of our possible decisions."
After the tabulated results are verified,
the Elections Commission will write a bill
to the GSC and Senate recommending
that the results be certified. At that point
the chairs of these governing bodies will
decide how to proceed.

The earliest time the GSC and Senate
will be able to vote to certify the results is
a week from Tuesday at their regular
meetings. The ASSU Joint Bylaws dictate
that a decision must be made within five
weeks of the election.
According to Senate Chair Josh Shipp,
a junior, any decision will depend on inter
pretation of the ASSU Constitution and
bylaws, although he admitted that these
documents are relatively vague on what is
needed for certification.
"We're going to be talking to the
Elections Commission and concerned
students and candidates and the commu
nity at large about what impact the vio
lations did have on the election and
whether it's an accurate representation
of the student sentiment," Shipp said.
"We want to make sure the integrity of

the election will be maintained. Ulti
mately, it's up to each of the individual
senators to make their decision."
Shipp added that the decision whether
or not to certify the election results is high
ly subjective and that the Senate will be in
close communication with the GSC during
the voting process. According to the by
laws, certification cannot be rescinded or
reconsidered once it is granted.
Last night, the candidates expressed re
lief that the campaigning had finally ended.
"I didn't know it could possibly get
worse than last year," Lee said, referring
to the disputed election in which his slate
for Senior Class president won by a hand
ful of votes. "I'm sick of the campaign part
of this."
