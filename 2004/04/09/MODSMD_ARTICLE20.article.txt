## Old-timers have some game, too 
### 
You can see as many of them as
you want and still not believe
it. Their skin gets all Happy
and wrinkly, their muscle
mass deteriorates, they start wearing
pants up above their belly buttons and
hair starts growing out of their ears.
We are all going to get old. You, me,
your younger sister, your grandkids, if we
don't die a tragic young death first. Come
Botox, silicon, and suction devices, it's
going to happen.
But life doesn't quite end when you
get old.
I'd never considered my dad a se
nior. but he decided to join an over-50
softball league in southern California.
Granted, the smell of Flex All perme
ates the early spring morning, but these
guys play doubleheaders every Sunday
in the hot sun.
The pitcher is 80 years old. Swear to

God, he's 80. Occa
sionally he hits a line
drive far enough such
that, "running" quite
slowly, he beats the
outfielder fora base
hit. He strikes guys
out three decades
younger than him.
The catcher was a
POW in World War

11. These guys are
unbelievable.
Then again, senior league is one
thing, but high-profile athletes are
quite another.
What is it we have against old ath
letes? Granted, I'm anti-old too, in denial
and disbelief. But who the hell cares if
Karl Malone still plays? Or VLADE?
The guys are old and they're still good
enough to play.
I think we don't like seeing people
come off their primes. As if the best
case scenario would be to finish at your
best and disappear. It's uncomfortable
seeing people run a little slower, get
tired a little quicker, grow some grey
hairs. It's like the same person, but not.
Somehow sadder.
If I ever really get old, which I still
can't conceptualize, I'd rather be one of
those annoying super-grandmas with a
frosted army haircut who power walks
marathons in leopard spandex with a
leathery perma-smile and bleached teeth.
Sure beats hobbling around on a walker
and sucking Cream of Wheat through a
straw. We should all be so lucky to be able
to move our limbs in a few decades and
remember who we are.
Famous athletes at least have good op
tions when they get old. They can still do
endorsements, buy or manage teams,
coach... Hell, Arnold Palmer gets to de
sign golf courses. Rough life. Then again,
we won't all be so fortunate:
My uncle and old college football leg
end has finally blown out his knee be
yond all repair. We're watching the Lak
ers the other night, and, diehard Lakers
fan that he is, my uncle switches channels
to watch American Idol. I kid you not. It
was tragic. Some girl got kicked off after
50 commercial breaks and she cried, but
I was more shocked by my uncle's move
to the Dark Side. Granted, they were
playing the Clippers.
Hey, why not more Laker Girls and less
sports announcers? They're more fun to
watch, anyway. If you really wanted both,
you could have the commentator's voice in
rhythm over the Laker Girls' dancing.
Alas, Laker Girls too get old, and they
wind up judging American Idol, Paula.
What is this show? What kind of world do
we live in where lame kind-of celeb Clay
Aiken and the gremlin Olsen twins are
both worthy of a Rolling Stone cover?
Picture this: Even the Olsen twins are
going to get wrinkly, but the Hilton sisters
will be even older. Will they still be as tan?
Will their grandkids watch Paris's video
for sleepover party entertainment?
We'll be driving soccer-mom vans,
they'll be playing Sean Paul on the oldies
station, and McDonald's will still be
around with that freaky clown. How
come the clown doesn't get any older?
Check this out: I was a faster runner a
decade ago than I am now. Seriously, I
was running five-and-a-half minute miles
as a pre-teen, and now it's an accomplish
ment to finish the Dish run without walk
ing. And here I am snickering at the late
20s new moms glaring at me as they push
their baby strollers along.
I laugh now, but what will I be
doing with my body a few decades
from now? I should hope to wind up
on a seniors Softball team. You suck
up and accept that you're old, and you
still dive for the ball like you're 18.
And hope nothing shatters.

opinion: Will Teyo Johnson still he hot
when he's 65, or does everyone fall off
when they get old?
