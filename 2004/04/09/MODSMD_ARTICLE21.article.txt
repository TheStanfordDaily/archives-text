# Mayberry, Hall blast Beavers
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
For seven innings last night, the
top-ranked Stanford baseball
team appeared headed for its first
back-to-back losses of the season.
The Pacific-10 Conference's lead
ing offense, which had picked up
the slack when the pitching had
faltered so often this season, could
not break through.
Better late than never.
Stanford (24-4, 3-1 Pac-10)
got a pair of home runs from
sophomore first baseman John
Mayberry Jr. and a clutch home
run from senior right fielder
Brian Hall to erase a 7-4 deficit
with seven runs in the last two in
nings and defeat Oregon State
11-8 in Corvallis, Ore.
"We just had to stay patient and
we were going to come through of
fensively," Mayberry Jr. said.
The win was the Cardinal's 12th
of the come-from-behind variety
this season, and a bit of sweet re
demption after UCLA turned a
similar trick on Stanford with a
comeback win in the sour final
game of a three-game series in Los
Angeles last Sunday.
With one out and the bases
loaded in the ninth, Stanford ju
nior catcher Donny Lucy dumped
a single into left field to score se
nior third baseman Jonny Ash and
junior leftfielder Danny Putnam to
cap the comeback and give the
Cardinal the lead for good, 9-7.
Freshman Jim Rapoport and
sophomore Chris Minaker added
RBI singles for good measure and
senior relief pitcher David
O'Hagan — after surrendering a
leadoff home run in the ninth —
retired the next three Beavers to
secure the win.
The Stanford bullpen, shaky

against the Bruins, was near
ly lights-out last night in re
lief of Stanford sophomore
starter Mark Romanczuk,
who left after giving up 10
hits and six earned runs in 5
1/3 innings. Freshman Jeff
Stimpson, making his first
appearance since giving up
the walk-off homer to
UCLA on Sunday, walked
one in 1 1 / 3 innings of score
less relief, junior Mark Jec
men retired the only batter
he faced on a strikeout and
O'Hagan, who picked up the
win, struck out three in two
innings of work.
While Stanford trailed by
as many as four runs in the
game, the Cardinal drew first
blood in the top of the first
— literally and figuratively
— when Ash hit a long drive
to right field. Oregon State's
Jacoby Ellsbury gave chase
and appeared to make the
shoestring catch, but crashed
headfirst into the wall with
out the ball. While Ellsbury,
who would not return, re
mained shaken on the warn
ing track. Ash raced around
the bases fora rare inside
the-park home run.
Even without Ellsbury —
a .407 hitter — to deal with,
Romanczuk could not avoid
the big inning.
Oregon State (18-10,3-4)

put together a five-run second in
ning, with a little help from Stan
ford's normally stellar defense.
Designated hitter Andy Jenkins
reached on an error by Ash to
lead off the inning and center
fielder Aaron Matthews followed
with a single up the middle. That
set the table for red-hot catcher
Paul Richie.

Richie, hitting .345 over his last
11 games, promptly deposited a
Romanczuk pitch over the leftfield
wall to give the Beavers a 3-1 lead,
much to the delight of the crowd at
Goss Stadium at Coleman Field.
Romanczuk, who this season
has shown a penchant for giving up
a few runs early before settling
down, then walked light-hitting
second baseman Chris Kunda on

five pitches. The Beavers' No. 9
hitter, Tyler Graham, lashed a sin
gle to right, sending Kunda to
third, and rightfielder Chris Cam
pos plated both runs with a double
to right before the inning was over.
Stanford answered right back in
the top half of the third against
Oregon State starter Andy Bald
win when sophomore second base
man Jed Lowrie doubled and Put

nam walked to lead off the inning.
Mayberry Jr. then drilled his first
home run of the game to straight
away center, cutting the Beavers'
lead to 5-3.
"I was looking fastball, stayed
right up the middle with it and it
happened to float over the fence,"
Mayberry Jr.said.

Late home runs by John Mayberry, Jr. and Brian Hall sealed the baseball team's 1 2th come-from-behind victory this
season, this one over the Oregon State Beavers, to give senior hurler David O'Hagan the win.
