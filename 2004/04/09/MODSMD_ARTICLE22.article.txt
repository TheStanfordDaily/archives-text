# Softball faces archrival Berkeley this weekend
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Cardinal softball team (29-8,
2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) will play for
more than just bragging rights this weekend
against No. 5 California (33-5, 1-2). The
Cardinal is looking for revenge against the
Golden Bears after being swept in three
games in last season's series — all of which
were decided by one run.
Stanford first travels to Berkeley fora
matchup today at 2 p.m., then returns to
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium to
host Cal in a doubleheader tomorrow.
Saturday's first game is scheduled for 2
p.m., with the second game coming im
mediately afterward.
Despite Cal's superior record and rank
ing, the Cardinal's chances against the pow
erful Golden Bears are looking up after the
first weekend of Pac-10 play. The Golden
Bears, ranked in the top three for most of
the season, looked vulnerable last weekend
in dropping two of three games at home
against the Oregon schools. At the same
time, the Cardinal won two of three against
the same teams, defeating No. 14 Oregon
State, 2-0, and then splitting two games with
No. 15 Oregon.
The Golden Bears feature a dangerous
balance of good hitting and pitching, which
has been evident in their 33 wins this year.
Cal's pitching staff features a 1-2 punch un
matched by any other school in the country;
their top two starters both have stats worthy
of a staff ace. Kristina Thorson is a perfect
15-0 in the circle with a minuscule 0.84 ERA
to go with 124 strikeouts, while "number
two" starter Kelly Anderson has 18 wins,
102 strikeouts and a 1.20 ERA.
Cal's offense relies on speed at the top of

its batting order, as its lop two hitters have
already combined for 34 stolen bases, al
most as many as the entire Stanford team
has stolen thus far (36). The top of the order
is made up of speedsters Vicky Galindo
(.389 batting average, 17 SB) and Lindsay
James (.370, 17 SB), and with these two
perennially on base and in scoring position,
Cal is able to manufacture plenty of runs.
Leading the Bears in run production is
sophomore catcher Haley Woods, who has
11 home runs and a team-leading 42 RBlsto
go with her sparkling .347 batting average.
In fact. Woods is one of 25 finalists for the
U.S.A. Softball Collegiate Player of the
Year award.
Woods will not be the only Player of the
Year finalist on the diamond this weekend,
though, as the Cardinal boasts two finalists
of its own in senior ace hurler Dana
Sorensen and sophomore shortstop Lauren
Lappin. The Cardinal will rely heavily on
Sorensen's pitching against Cal.
The former All-American has shown
herself in peak form in the last few weeks.
Last weekend against Oregon and Oregon
State, Sorensen allowed just one run and
five hits in 14 innings of work, striking out
17 en route to winning both of her starts.
Sorensen, nicknamed "Lightning D,"
now sports a 17-4 record and a 1.08 ERA to
go with 184 strikeouts, second in the Pac-10.
Sorensen will probably start two of the
weekend's three games against Cal, so
sophomore Laura Severson, the Cardinal's
number two starter, will be called upon start
one game. Severson has been a reliable
number two thus far this season but has
lacked Sorensen's consistent brilliance.
The Cardinal offense will have its hands

If the Cardinal can get some re

two of the games, it has a real chance

time ever. Either way, winning

Year award.
Woods will not be the only Player of the
Year finalist on the diamond this weekend,
though, as the Cardinal boasts two finalists
of its own in senior ace hurler Dana
Sorensen and sophomore shortstop Lauren
Lappin. The Cardinal will rely heavily on
Sorensen's pitching against Cal.
The former All-American has shown
herself in peak form in the last few weeks.
Last weekend against Oregon and Oregon
State, Sorensen allowed just one run and
five hits in 14 innings of work, striking out
17 en route to winning both of her starts.
Sorensen, nicknamed "Lightning D,"
now sports a 17-4 record and a 1.08 ERA to
go with 184 strikeouts, second in the Pac-10.
Sorensen will probably start two of the
weekend's three games against Cal, so
sophomore Laura Severson, the Cardinal's
number two starter, will be called upon start
one game. Severson has been a reliable
number two thus far this season but has
lacked Sorensen's consistent brilliance.

The softball team (29-8) travels to Berkeley this weekend, hoping to close in on the Pac
-10 Championship by winning a series against Cal.
full with the excellent Cal pitching
staff but shouldn't be overwhelmed,
thanks to the all-star sophomore
trio of center fielder Jackie Rine
hart (a team-leading .429 batting av
erage), left fielder Catalina Morris
(.333 batting average, 3 runs, 2 RBIs
in three games last weekend) and
Lappin (a team-leading 30 RBIs).
The Cardinal will also count on con
tributions from seniors Katherine
Hoffman and Jessica Allister and

hot-hitting junior Leah Nelson, who
hit .429 against the Oregon schools
last weekend.
If the Cardinal can get some re
venge this weekend and take at least
two of the games, it has a real chance
of winning the Pac-10 for the first
time ever. Either way, winning
against the Golden Bears would
help rally team morale fora brutal
upcoming schedule that features the
top two teams in the country in Ari
zona and UCLA.
The Cardinal's fate may lie in the
able hands of Dana Sorensen. The
Cardinal needs "Lightning" to
strike twice against the Golden
Bears this weekend.
The No. 9 Cardinal softball team (29-8,
2-1 Pacific-10 Conference) will play for
more than just bragging rights this weekend
against No. 5 California (33-5, 1-2). The
Cardinal is looking for revenge against the
Golden Bears after being swept in three
games in last season's series — all of which
were decided by one run.
Stanford first travels to Berkeley fora
matchup today at 2 p.m., then returns to
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadium to
host Cal in a doubleheader tomorrow.
Saturday's first game is scheduled for 2
p.m., with the second game coming im
mediately afterward.
Despite Cal's superior record and rank
ing, the Cardinal's chances against the pow
erful Golden Bears are looking up after the
first weekend of Pac-10 play. The Golden
Bears, ranked in the top three for most of
the season, looked vulnerable last weekend
in dropping two of three games at home
against the Oregon schools. At the same
time, the Cardinal won two of three against
the same teams, defeating No. 14 Oregon
State, 2-0, and then splitting two games with
No. 15 Oregon.
The Golden Bears feature a dangerous
balance of good hitting and pitching, which
has been evident in their 33 wins this year.
Cal's pitching staff features a 1-2 punch un
matched by any other school in the country;
their top two starters both have stats worthy
of a staff ace. Kristina Thorson is a perfect
15-0 in the circle with a minuscule 0.84 ERA
to go with 124 strikeouts, while "number
two" starter Kelly Anderson has 18 wins,
102 strikeouts and a 1.20 ERA.
Cal's offense relies on speed at the top of

its batting order, as its lop two hitters have
already combined for 34 stolen bases, al
most as many as the entire Stanford team
has stolen thus far (36). The top of the order
is made up of speedsters Vicky Galindo
(.389 batting average, 17 SB) and Lindsay
James (.370, 17 SB), and with these two
perennially on base and in scoring position,
Cal is able to manufacture plenty of runs.
Leading the Bears in run production is
sophomore catcher Haley Woods, who has
11 home runs and a team-leading 42 RBlsto
go with her sparkling .347 batting average.
In fact. Woods is one of 25 finalists for the
U.S.A. Softball Collegiate Player of the
Year award.
Woods will not be the only Player of the

though, as the Cardinal boasts two finalists
of its own in senior ace hurler Dana
Sorensen and sophomore shortstop Lauren
Lappin. The Cardinal will rely heavily on
