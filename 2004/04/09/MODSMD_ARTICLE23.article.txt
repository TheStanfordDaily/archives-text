With only four matches left in Pacific-10
Conference competition, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (19-0) has the coveted
title of league champion served up in its line
of fire.
No less can be expected of a team with a
sweet sixteen set of league titles already on
the books.
So what happens when you pit the unde
feated Cardinal against two competitors with
less-than-stellar season records?

That remains to be seen, as Stanford
faces off against No. 37 Arizona (5-10) and
No. 41 Arizona State (6-11) in back-to-back
matches starting today at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
"This will be a good weekend, based on the
fact that it's our last home weekend, and we're
sending off two great seniors, Emilia Ander
son and Lauren Barnikow, " said Stanford as
sistant soach Frankie Brennan. "I think the en
ergy's going to be high."
No. 43 Barnikow (27-4) noted, "It's exciting
and bittersweet to play my last matches at
home. I can't believe it's been four years. I'm

definitely looking back on it fondly."
Meanwhile, times in Tucson have been dis
mal for the opponent Wildcats. Starting with a
6-1 deferral to No. 11 California, Arizona
dropped six straight matches in the last month,
five of them at home.
It wasn't until Tuesday that Arizona
snapped its losing skid with its first Pac-10 win
of the season, a 6-1 success over No. 61 Wash
ington State.
"Personally, I would say that they're under
achieving a little bit," Brennan said. "They're
definitely better players as individuals than
what they tend to be [showing] as a team."

Adding to Arizona's March sadness, Stan
ford clinched all but the No. 5 singles match in
its first meeting of the season.
Anderson was forced to retire from the
match against unranked Jessie Rochefort after
undergoing two stringent, injury-provoking
matches earlier in that week.
"[The scores were] 7-6 and 7-5 in the third
set of [the earlier] matches," Anderson said.
"Plus, I have some recurring tendonitis in my
arm, and it had been flaring up pretty badly in
those last two weeks."
Anderson owns a 19-5 record and
is ranked No. 75 nationally. With
good health and practice on her side,
Anderson's hopes are higher this
time around.
"It will be competitive, and I feel
that in a tough match we're going to
pull out [the win]," Anderson said.
"But [now] it's more about the way
we play. We really want to make a
statement that we're in top tourna
ment form."

Turning to Tempe, the Sun Devils
have suffered a fate similar to Ari
zona, having been shut out by Stan
ford, 7-0.
Freshman Theresa Logar recalls
needing a 10-point tiebreak to secure a
No. 5 singles win over Sabrina Capan
nolo, 5-7,6-4,1-0(5).
"It will be great to redeem myself
on home turf," Logar said.
When not recovering from a gru
eling practice in the Francis C. Arril
laga weight center. No. 35 Logar (26-
2) can reflect on the fact that she's
gone undefeated since individual
competition in October, and only
five of her 28 matches have lulled her
into third-set action.
Heading the singles lineup and

ranked at No. 10 in the nation, sopho
more Amber Liu (11-4) is also poised
for success.
"Things have picked up a lot for
me," Liu said. "Earlier, my mindset
was just about maintaining my
game, but [Stanford head coach
Lele Forood] pointed out to me that
I'm really trying to get it up to the
next level, and I've been working re
ally hard."
Liu added, "In addition to team
practice, I've been out for an extra
hour and a half in the mornings hitting
with Lele."
Most recently, Liu claimed a swift 6-
1. 6-3 decision from UCLA's No. 16
Laura Gordon.
But for all of Stanford's accolades

and proven power, Brennan highlights
the importance of not taking the Ari
zona lineups in stride.
"We don't want the team just look
ing past this weekend to [UCLA and
Southern California] next weekend,"
Brennan said. "I think it's important
that we keep our focus. Arizona is a
very good, solid team and Arizona
State has good team unity."
Brennan continued, "[The Sun
Devils] come together with a little bit of
an 'us versus the world' mentality.
They're not as good as they have been
in years past, but they're still looking to
upset somebody."
Stanford plays Arizona at 1:30
p.m. today and Arizona State at
noon tomorrow.

sistant soach Frankie Brennan. "I think the en
ergy's going to be high."
No. 43 Barnikow (27-4) noted, "It's exciting
and bittersweet to play my last matches at
home. I can't believe it's been four years. I'm

definitely looking back on it fondly."
Meanwhile, times in Tucson have been dis
mal for the opponent Wildcats. Starting with a
6-1 deferral to No. 11 California, Arizona
dropped six straight matches in the last month,
five of them at home.
It wasn't until Tuesday that Arizona
snapped its losing skid with its first Pac-10 win
of the season, a 6-1 success over No. 61 Wash
ington State.
"Personally, I would say that they're under
achieving a little bit," Brennan said. "They're
definitely better players as individuals than
what they tend to be [showing] as a team."

Adding to Arizona's March sadness, Stan
ford clinched all but the No. 5 singles match in
its first meeting of the season.
Anderson was forced to retire from the
match against unranked Jessie Rochefort after
undergoing two stringent, injury-provoking
matches earlier in that week.
"[The scores were] 7-6 and 7-5 in the third
set of [the earlier] matches," Anderson said.
"Plus, I have some recurring tendonitis in my
arm, and it had been flaring up pretty badly in
those last two weeks."
Anderson owns a 19-5 record and
is ranked No. 75 nationally. With
good health and practice on her side,
Anderson's hopes are higher this
time around.
"It will be competitive, and I feel
that in a tough match we're going to
pull out [the win]," Anderson said.
"But [now] it's more about the way
we play. We really want to make a
statement that we're in top tourna
ment form."

Turning to Tempe, the Sun Devils
have suffered a fate similar to Ari
zona, having been shut out by Stan
ford, 7-0.
Freshman Theresa Logar recalls
needing a 10-point tiebreak to secure a
No. 5 singles win over Sabrina Capan
nolo, 5-7,6-4,1-0(5).
"It will be great to redeem myself
on home turf," Logar said.
When not recovering from a gru
eling practice in the Francis C. Arril

gone undefeated since individual
competition in October, and only
five of her 28 matches have lulled her
into third-set action.
Heading the singles lineup and

ranked at No. 10 in the nation, sopho
more Amber Liu (11-4) is also poised
for success.
"Things have picked up a lot for
me," Liu said. "Earlier, my mindset
was just about maintaining my
game, but [Stanford head coach
Lele Forood] pointed out to me that
I'm really trying to get it up to the
next level, and I've been working re
ally hard."
Liu added, "In addition to team
practice, I've been out for an extra
hour and a half in the mornings hitting
with Lele."
Most recently, Liu claimed a swift 6-

Laura Gordon.
But for all of Stanford's accolades

and proven power, Brennan highlights
the importance of not taking the Ari
zona lineups in stride.
"We don't want the team just look
ing past this weekend to [UCLA and
Southern California] next weekend,"
Brennan said. "I think it's important
that we keep our focus. Arizona is a
very good, solid team and Arizona
State has good team unity."
Brennan continued, "[The Sun

They're not as good as they have been
in years past, but they're still looking to
upset somebody."

With only four matches left in Pacific-10
Conference competition, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (19-0) has the coveted
title of league champion served up in its line
of fire.
No less can be expected of a team with a
sweet sixteen set of league titles already on
the books.
So what happens when you pit the unde
feated Cardinal against two competitors with
less-than-stellar season records?

That remains to be seen, as Stanford
faces off against No. 37 Arizona (5-10) and
No. 41 Arizona State (6-11) in back-to-back
matches starting today at Taube Family
Tennis Stadium.
"This will be a good weekend, based on the
fact that it's our last home weekend, and we're
sending off two great seniors, Emilia Ander
son and Lauren Barnikow, " said Stanford as
sistant soach Frankie Brennan. "I think the en
ergy's going to be high."
No. 43 Barnikow (27-4) noted, "It's exciting
