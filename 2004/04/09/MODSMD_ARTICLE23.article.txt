With only four matches left in Pacific-10
Conference competition, the No. 1 Stanford
women's tennis team (19-0) has the coveted
title of league champion served up in its line
of fire.
No less can be expected of a team with a
sweet sixteen set of league titles already on
the books.
So what happens when you pit the unde

Tennis Stadium.

home. I can't believe it's been four years. I'm

definitely looking back on it fondly."
Meanwhile, times in Tucson have been dis

6-1 deferral to No. 11 California, Arizona
dropped six straight matches in the last month,
five of them at home.
It wasn't until Tuesday that Arizona
snapped its losing skid with its first Pac-10 win
of the season, a 6-1 success over No. 61 Wash
ington State.
"Personally, I would say that they're under
achieving a little bit," Brennan said. "They're
definitely better players as individuals than
what they tend to be [showing] as a team."

Adding to Arizona's March sadness, Stan
ford clinched all but the No. 5 singles match in
its first meeting of the season.
Anderson was forced to retire from the
match against unranked Jessie Rochefort after
undergoing two stringent, injury-provoking
matches earlier in that week.
"[The scores were] 7-6 and 7-5 in the third
set of [the earlier] matches," Anderson said.
"Plus, I have some recurring tendonitis in my
arm, and it had been flaring up pretty badly in
