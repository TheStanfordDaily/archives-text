# Men's volleyball has an eye on the playoffs
## 
### MIA ASHTON CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford men's volley
ball team (8-15, 5-13 Mountain Pa
cific Sports Federation) will face two
very different opponents this week
end when it takes on No. 4 Pepper
dine (15-7, 11-7) at 7 p.m. tonight
and No. 15 Southern California (6-9,
4-14) at 7 p.m. Sunday.
But Stanford, which has struggled
through what head coach Don Shaw
called some "lethargic" practices last
week and a frustrating loss to UC-
Santa Barbara, is approaching both
matches similarly.
"Our team is focused on playing
with heart and character," said ju
nior outside hitter David Vogel, who
leads Stanford so far this season with
an average of 3.10 kills per game.
"[That means] giving it your all, no
matter how things are going, a 100-
percent effort in all you do."
Effort will be essential against the
Waves, yet another team in Stan
ford's conference that figures promi
nently in the national scene.
"They are one of the top teams,"
Shaw said. "They've got a chance to
win the national championships."
The Waves started the season
ranked first, and have remained in

the top five since then, thanks to the
stellar play of All-American outside
hitters Fred Winters, a senior, and
Sean Rooney, a junior.
"The goal is to contain what they
can do offensively," Vogel said of
Winters and Rooney, who have com
bined for 687 kills so far this season.
Shaw agreed by referencing the 3-
0 loss Stanford suffered against the
Waves in Malibu.
"(Winters and Rooney] really
gave us problems down there,"
he said.
At 6-foot-5 and 6-foot-9, respec
tively, Winters and Rooney are part
of an exceptionally large squad, with
impressive attack numbers to boot.
Thirty-seven percent of the balls that
Pepperdine hits go for points.
"They're much bigger than we
are size-wise and much bigger along
the net," Shaw said. "So we're going
to have to have good ball control and
hit smart."
USC, like Stanford, has struggled
in the MPSF, only winning four con
ference games to Stanford's five.
One of the Trojan's wins came
against Stanford earlier this season,
when USC posted a 3-1 victory on its
home court.
"We didn't hit that well and we
didn't serve that well either," Vogel

said of their last meeting.
Since then, Stanford has seen
USC as one of the teams to beat in
order to secure a playoff berth. The
target on USC's back only got big
ger when Stanford lost last Satur
day's match to UCSB, another team
in the running for the coveted
eighth spot.
"It's a huge game," Shaw said.
The Trojans do boast some key
players, like junior outside hitter
Blake Tippet, who has recorded 328
kills on the season at a rate of 3.77
kills per game. While no one seems
comparable to the powerful duo of
Winters and Rooney, the Trojans
pose a different kind of threat.
"They're smaller, very quick and
very explosive," Shaw said.
Like most MPSF teams, USC
and Pepperdine will pose tough
matchups for the Cardinal. The
difference this time is that Stan
ford will take on its opponents in
Burnham Pavilion, where the Car
dinal usually fares better. Stanford
has only posted two wins away
from home this season.
"It's always easier to play at
home," Vogel said. "You have
your fans, you feel more comfort
able, and nobody is heckling you
from the sidelines."
