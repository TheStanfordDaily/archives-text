After a string of three losses to
ranked teams this week, the outlook
looks good for Stanford against No.
47 Arizona State and No. 23 Ari
zona, teams the Cardinal has al
ready beaten this season. The team
will try to bounce back when it hits
the courts today and tomorrow in
Tempe and Tucson, Ariz.
"It's definitely more difficult [to
play in Arizona] because Arizona
has more altitude, so the ball will be
flying around a little bit more," said
Stanford freshman Chris Ras
mussen. "But I'm totally confident
that we'll come out with two victo
ries."
Added head coach Dick Gould:
"We've had a tough stretch but the
kids are responding well and overall
we're doing OK."
First up for the Cardinal is a dual
match at Whiteman Tennis Center
against Arizona State, which comes
in with a 7-10 record. Earlier in
February, Stanford came out victo

rious against the Sun Devils, claim
ing a 7-0 win. The Cardinal has a 47-
1 all-time record against Arizona
State, but Gould gives the Sun Dev
ils some credit.
"ASU is hot coal," he said.
"They beat UCLA, and they're al
ways good at home. We're expect
ing a tough match from them'
The Sun Devils have recently
dropped from No. 37 to No. 47, and
they have no ranked players. The
team does, however, have an all
time 55-21 home dual-match
record.
Arizona State will enter the
match coming off of two losses to
No. 18 Washington and No. 46 Ore
gon, and the team owns a dismal 0-
4 Pac-10 record. Stanford has de
feated both Washington and Ore
gon this season.
On Saturday, the Cardinal's
next challenger will be Arizona,
which owns a 12-7 season record,
but is only 1 -3 in the Pac-10 confer
ence. Arizona has climbed from No.
47 to No. 23 since the last time the
two teams met, but the numbers are

against the Wildcats, who have only
won one of 52 all-time matchups
against the Cardinal.
Stanford soundly defeated Ari
zona in February, 5-2. The Wildcats
were unable to win any of the dou
bles matches and relied on singles
play to claw out two points.
Arizona has only has one ranked
player. No. 96 Roger Matalonga,
who defeated Stanford sophomore
James Pade, 6-1, 6-2, the last time
the teams met. Matalonga is now
20-8 on the season. Another player
to watch is Colin O'Grady, who
combines with Matalonga and has a
No. 48 doubles ranking. The Ari
zona duo holds a 15-5 overall season
record and is 7-4 in the No. 1 dou
bles spot and 7-0 in the No. 2 spot.
"Arizona is having a great sea
son and they played very compet
itively against Stanford earlier
this year," Gould said. "I'd be re
ally pleased to rebound after Cal.
If we could do that, we'd get
more momentum against Pep
perdine," referring to Stanford's
next match.
