# Women's golf hosts Invite
## 
### SEAN HOWELL DESK EDITOR 
The women's golf team will host a group of 14 teams at the Peg
Barnard Invitational Tournament at the Stanford Golf Course this
weekend. The action on both Saturday and Sunday will start with
what is known as a shotgun start, in which each team begins at the
same time, only on different holes, in order to complete the course
in one day.
Stanford junior Wendra Liang won top overall honors last year,
shooting a 148 over the two-day tournament on the par-72 course.
She will try to defend her title this year.
The University of Denver will also try to defend the team portion
of the tournament that it won last year, shooting a total of 621.
The tournament will be the final tune-up for the team before Pa
cific-10 Conference Championships, which will be held from April
19-21 in Los Angeles.
The NCAA Regional Championships will also be held at Stan
ford, in early May.
The team has struggled this season, never finishing higher than
fifth in any tournament. Its hopes this weekend will rest squarely on
the shoulders of Liang and freshman Lauren Todd, who leads the
team with three top-25 finishes.
The team will also rely on sophomore Stephanie Lue, who tied
for 18th last weekend at the PING / ASU Invitational, at which the
Cardinal finished seventh, and senior Kim Kouwabunpat, who was
one stroke back of Lue in 22nd.
Though that tournament was a step back for the Cardinal, the
team has been improving all year long. After an early-season 13th
place finish at the Stanford Pepsi Intercollegiate, the team improved
to 11th at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, sixth at the
Arizona Wildcat Invitational and fifth at the Spartan Invitational in
Salinas, Calif.
