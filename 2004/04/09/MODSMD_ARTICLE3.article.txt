# Chavez celebrated with music

### MARI SUZUKI 
To highlight both the accom
plishments of Cesar Chavez and
the challenges faced by Mexican
workers, El Centro Chicano will
be hosting its 11th annual Cesar
Chavez Commemoration cele
bration on Saturday, April 10 at
4 p.m. on Wilbur Field.
Entitled 'Viva Cesar
Chavez!" the event is a tribute
to Cesar Chavez's fight for im
migrant farm workers' rights
and his contributions to culture
and art. Four main events are
scheduled, including a perfor
mance by musical trio Agustin
Lira and Alma, who are known
for their musical expression of
immigrant experiences.
Teatro Immigrante will pre
sent "Cruz Miracle at Labor
Camp 12," a production written
and directed by Augustin Lira
with music by Lado Oriente.
The program coordinators

have decided to hold this event
outdoors to increase the par
ticipation of people outside of
El Centro and cultural groups.
"Usually this event is held in
auditoriums but we felt that
holding it outdoors would make
it more inviting to the greater
Stanford community," said pro
gram co-coordinator Gaby
Arvizu, a junior. "We hope the
open environment will encour
age more people to stop by."
Celebration coordinators said
they hope the event will increase
awareness of the discrimination
and hardships that continue to
plague many immigrant and mi
grant workers.
"We want to expose Stanford
students to the issues going on
now and work to better things,"
Arvizu said.
According to event coordina
tors, "Viva Cesar Chavez!" is in
tended to fuse politics and reali
ty, especially in light of the grow

ing Mexican immigrant popula
tion in the state of California.
"Last year they brought in
workers from a ranch close by,"
said sophomore Sonna Monte
jano. "We were able to see how
the politics brought up in the
event actually related to peo
ple's lives. I think it's important
that we know."
Treatment of immigrant
workers has been a contentious
issue in recent years with in
creased attention focused on the
Mexican workers at Webb
Ranch, a farm located on Stan
ford land near the 280 Junction on
Alpine Road.
Students have long criticized
the University for the poor liv
ing and work conditions at the
ranch. This situation has been
highlighted in previous Cesar
Chavez activities.
While Cesar Chavez is well
known for his political activism,
his involvement in the union

movement will not necessarily
be the main focus of Saturday's
events. Nativo Lopez, president
of the Mexican American Politi
cal Association, will deliver the
keynote address on a variety of
related topics.
While Lopez is expected to
touch on immigrant workers'
rights. El Centro Chicano Facul
ty Director Chris Clarke said,
"Saturday's event is also about
recognizing Cesar Chavez as a
humanitarian and the art he
helped give birth to."
The Saturday event will fea
ture San Jose-based band,
Lado Oriente, which will be
perform both traditional fiesta
music and eclectic original
pieces. Elementary, middle and
high school student winners of
the Cesar Chavez Art and
Essay Contest will be recog
nized as well.
The event is free and open to
the public.
