# Shakespeare faces the music

### MEGAN GREEN INTERMISSION WRITER 
If you are a Billy Shakespeare, Cole Porter, Julia Stiles
or Heath ledger fan, you will want to catch "Kiss Me,
Kate," this year's Ram's Head Spring Musical which
opens tonight and plays April 9, 10, 15, 16, 17 at 8 p.m.
"Kiss Me, Kate" is a professional effort, and the energy
and pizzazz of the 50 students involved shines in this clas
sic production.
"Kiss Me, Kate" is the story of a theater company at-

tempting to put on a produc
tion of "Taming of the
Shrew." Its two stars, Fred
and Lilli (ex-lovers), play
Fetruchio and Katharine;
however, the production is
overshadowed by the two
stars' battling egos. Their off
stage personalities bleed
through onstage, as the show
slowly begins to unravel. The
show takes some crazy twists
when two humorous gang
sters arrive, followed by Lilli's
militaristic fiancee. All of the
characters find themselves

torn between the past and the present as they attempt to
finish the show.
The production is led by Merritt Forrest Baer and
Cindy Prieto playing Fred and Lilli, respectively. Both turn
in compelling performances as strong actors and singers.
Something should certainly be said here on behalf of
Ram's Head for scouting out new talent on campus, as
both are freshmen. Other roles include Bianca (a sassy and
sexy Sasha Cox), Lucentio (a sweet and mellow Kyle
Duarte), Baptista (a comic Mike McCunniff-Reid), the
General (a witty Eric Lowe), Hattie (a strong-voiced
Mamie Rheingold), the two Gangsters (an absolutely hi
larious Robbie Evans and Jay Nancarrow), as well as a
wonderful ensemble. Each is successful at breathing life
into their varied roles.
A great adaptation of "The Shrew" (another recent
adaptation was "10 Things 1 Hate About You"), this pro
duction is filled with show-stopping numbers. Starting with
"Another Op'nin, Another Show," "Kiss Me, Kate" brims
with classic Broadway tunes. Highlights included Kather
ine's "I Hate Men," Petruchio's "Life That Late I Led,"

and the ever-comic "Brush Up Your Shakespeare." Other
memorable songs include "Always True To You" and the
spectacular, energized dance number "Too Darn Hot." (I
was left panting, it was so hot.)
The choreography throughout this production was
well-conceived by Kari Doyle and Meg Kale and excep
tionally well performed (especially by "Too Darn Hot's"
Brian Eggleston). The brassy score was illuminated by ex
cellent Broadway-style belting, and an orchestra pit (con
ducted by Michael Deeringer) that was truly first-rate.
However, the true gem of this production is the in-

credible set designed by Liz
Seibert. Built by the cast and
crew, this set can be summed
up in two words: truly profes
sional. Massive in scale, this
mobile set frames each scene
exquisitely.
However, when all is
said and done, "Kiss Me,
Kate" is a traditional piece of
musical theatre from the
Golden Age, which is not ex
actly my cup of tea. Rani's
Head should strive to produce
more current works, whereas

at times, this script seems
slightly antiquated. The cast, however, does more than its
share to outweigh this inherent flaw, in my eyes.
As a student production, which receives no funding
from the ASSU or Stanford University, this show must
be praised for its resourcefulness. In a time when
protests for special fees are as numerous as the number
of freshmen looking fora "cool" party on a Friday night,
Ram's Head should be lauded for its ability to produce
first rate student theatre by financing its productions
completely on its own. Not only is the show an artistic
success, but a standard to which all student groups
should hold themselves. So, this Friday night, don't be
that lost freshman searching fora kiss at a party, instead
support on-campus student theatre and go see a great
production — "Kiss Me, Kate."
Tickets are available in White Plaza, or by emailing joli
va@stanford. edu.

wonderful ensemble. Each is successful at breathing life
into their varied roles.
A great adaptation of "The Shrew" (another recent
adaptation was "10 Things 1 Hate About You"), this pro
duction is filled with show-stopping numbers. Starting with
"Another Op'nin, Another Show," "Kiss Me, Kate" brims
with classic Broadway tunes. Highlights included Kather
ine's "I Hate Men," Petruchio's "Life That Late I Led,"

and the ever-comic "Brush Up Your Shakespeare." Other
memorable songs include "Always True To You" and the
spectacular, energized dance number "Too Darn Hot." (I
was left panting, it was so hot.)
The choreography throughout this production was
well-conceived by Kari Doyle and Meg Kale and excep
tionally well performed (especially by "Too Darn Hot's"
Brian Eggleston). The brassy score was illuminated by ex
cellent Broadway-style belting, and an orchestra pit (con
ducted by Michael Deeringer) that was truly first-rate.
However, the true gem of this production is the in-

credible set designed by Liz
Seibert. Built by the cast and
crew, this set can be summed
up in two words: truly profes
sional. Massive in scale, this
mobile set frames each scene
exquisitely.
However, when all is
said and done, "Kiss Me,
Kate" is a traditional piece of
musical theatre from the
Golden Age, which is not ex
actly my cup of tea. Rani's
Head should strive to produce
more current works, whereas

at times, this script seems
slightly antiquated. The cast, however, does more than its
share to outweigh this inherent flaw, in my eyes.
As a student production, which receives no funding
from the ASSU or Stanford University, this show must
be praised for its resourcefulness. In a time when
protests for special fees are as numerous as the number
of freshmen looking fora "cool" party on a Friday night,
Ram's Head should be lauded for its ability to produce
first rate student theatre by financing its productions
completely on its own. Not only is the show an artistic
success, but a standard to which all student groups
should hold themselves. So, this Friday night, don't be
that lost freshman searching fora kiss at a party, instead
support on-campus student theatre and go see a great
production — "Kiss Me, Kate."
