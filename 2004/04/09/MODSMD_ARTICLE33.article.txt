## The 						Whole Ten Yards: Nine was more than enough 
### FARIS ALIMOHIUDDIN INTERMISSION WRITER 
The Whole Ten

As a rule of thumb, plot-twist and double-cross
movies have the potential to be either masterfully
exhilarating. . .or just random crap. When films
border on the latter, they tend to cover their bases
by inteijecting diversions like gratuitous nudity
(e.g. "Wild Things"). Hey, I'm not complaining.
Sometimes, some genitals here and there can do
wonders to distract audiences from an incoherent
plot. Unfortunately when I found out "The Whole
Ten Yards," unlike its R-rated predecessor, was
rated PG-13,1 realized that wonderful consolation of
impending nakedness was suddenly gone and now

I'd have to, you know, pay attention. And that's when the
trouble started.
To be fair, "The Whole Ten Yards" does avoid the folly of
many sequels in that it is not a regurgitation of the original. We
pick up with the main characters from the first film, all in new lo
cations with new spouses yet still as quirky as ever. Jimmy "the
Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis), presumed dead, has traded in his
AK-47 for 409 cleaner while his new wife, Jill (Amanda Peet), at
tempts to learn the trade of a contract killing. Adorned in an apron

and sporting long blonde hair, Willis resembles what Martha Stew
art may look like after coming out of prison. Meanwhile, in sunny
California, the ever-neurotic Oz Oseransky (Matthew Perry) and
his new bride (Natasha Henstridge) attempt to live a normal life
free of the mob. But when Hungarian mob boss Lazlo Gogolak
leaves prison to hunt Jimmy — who he blames for the
murder of his son, Yanni — things start to get messy.
Where "The Whole Nine Yards" had a plot, albeit a convolut
ed one, the"The Whole Ten Yards" is devoid of any direction.
We see things happen, we know there is probably going to be

some half-assed explanation later on and then some
other inane event occurs. It's really just a progression of
sight gags, crotch kicks, gay innuendo, fart jokes and
face slaps that somewhat revolve around a kidnapping
plot. Regardless, amusing characters can always com
pensate fora lackluster script — too bad that doesn't
happen here.
A study found that the Jerry Bruckheimer
movies have an explosion around every 30 seconds, per
haps in lieu of a plot. In this movie, Matthew Perry walks
into, falls off of, bumps or crashes into all things inani
mate every five seconds. In a particularly (un)inspired
scene, he manages to crash into the same door three
times in less than 10 seconds. Other than getting hurt,
Matthew Perry does very little throughout the film. As
Jimmy the maniacal yet sensitive killer, Bruce Willis also
manages to come off surprisingly flat. In the original, his
infrequent bipolarity was entertaining; however, his
threats-to-tears routine wears thin quickly here. Both
Henstridge and Peet are given little to do and, despite
what their past work might have you believe, they keep

their clothes on. In essence, the characters in the
"Whole Ten Yards" come off as bad impersonations of them
selves in the first movie. Even the jokes are too laborious and de
rivative to divert my intention away from the chaotic chain of
events. What am I left with?
The movie has its moments, but for every decent joke, 15 peo
ple have been slapped, Matthew Perry has collided with some
thing at least 80 times, and one hour of your life has elapsed.
There's really not enough that goes right to counteract everything
that goes wrong in this movie. Regardless of where you look, "The
Whole Ten Yards" still falls well short of a good movie.
