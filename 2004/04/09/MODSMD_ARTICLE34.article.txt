# Hellboy: Selma Blair doesn't kiss chicks here
## 
### ERIC FORD INTERMISSION WRITER 
Let's get one thing straight: "Hellboy" is not the best comic
book movie out there, and it's nowhere close to being a par
ticularly great movie to begin with. However, one thing that
the movie manages to do particularly well is not take itself too
seriously. Yes, "Hellboy" is cliched, the action scenes are over
the top and some of the humor is lame, but the movie knows
this and tries to make the best of it. I can appreciate this down
to-earth mindset, which makes it adecent flick in my book.
Like any predictable comic book flick, "Hellboy" starts off
with the background story of its mutant hero, a half-man, half
demon. During World War 11, the Nazis attempted to sum
mon demon gods in order to gain the power to rule the world
(like I've never heard this plot before). While this ritual is
being performed, a group of U.S. soldiers, led by the eccentric
Prof. Bruttenholm, manages to stop the Nazis and shut down
the portal that was opened to the netherworld. However, one
thing had escaped through to Earth: baby Hellboy. The pro
fessor takes him in and raises him as a son. Fast forward to cur
rent times: The remnants of the Nazi group that initiated the
first ceremony, now rejoined with their resurrected leader
Rasputin (Karel Roden), attempt to gain access once more to
a portal that would start the destruction of the world. It's up to
Hell Boy (Ron Perlman), the aged professor (John Hurt) and
his superhero sidekicks Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and Liz
Sherman (Selma Blair) to save the world.
"Hellboy" is an odd moviein that it attempts to focus a lit
tle bit on every character, not just the title figure. The narra
tive sheds light on the life of the Professor first, then switches
to rookie FBI agent John Myers (Rupert Evans), who is hired
to help take care of the demonic half-breed. Later, it centers
on the relationship between Hellboy and Sherman, including

Sherman's tragic
past dealing with
her supernatural
powers (which are

begin with). This method of filming is ideal for focusing on
each character, but it has the undesirable side effect of diffus
ing the film's energy.
My biggest gripe with the movie is its abysmal action se
quences. 1 understand that it's a comic movie and it's sup
posed to have crazy special effects and stunts, but these were
so ridiculous that they just didn't work. You get pretty damn
tired watching Hellboy fly 30 feet and smash through several
windows and walls whenever he is hit. One scene presents the
audience with a view of the post-apocalypse world: it's a bla
tant rip-off of "The Matrix."
Another minor complaint I have is the lack of any sem
blance of development in the supporting cast. Myers is com
pletely shallow, and the other superheroes only actually pop
into play whenever they are needed, otherwise blending too
well in the background. It's almost as if they overextended
their abilities, and failed miserably.
What does work is the overall attitude of the film. The di
alogue in some places is downright horrible, but Perlman's
acting (among others) manages to make it funny. Every scene,
even the dramatic ones, are treated with an air of joking that
reminds the viewer that this is a comic book flick and as such
should not be taken too seriously. Combine this with the fact
that when the movie does need to get seriously, it succeeds,
and you get a movie that's just fun to watch.
If you don't like comic book flicks, this ain't no Spiderman,
and you won't turn into a believer. However, if you're looking
fora light adventure with over-the-top scenes and (sort of) de
cent acting, then give it chance.
