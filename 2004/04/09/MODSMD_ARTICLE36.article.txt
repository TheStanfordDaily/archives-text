# Julia Stiles: Making it big without big boobs
## 
### BEATRICE KIM INTERMISSION WRITER 
What do Heath Ledger. Mekhi Phifer and Freddie Prinze Jr. have in common?
Okay, besides the obvious hotness factor. (I'm such a girl.) Answer: They've all had on
screen kisses with Julia Stiles. And with her latest movie, "The Prince and Me," Luke

Mably can now be added to that list.

Known for her teen flicks / romantic comedies / Shakespeare fetish.
Stiles stays in her comfort realm with this lighthearted romance. She stars as

Paige, an ambitious farm girl from Wisconsin who meets a regular guy

named Eddie (Luke Mably) who turns out to be — surprise, surprise

the Crown Prince of Denmark. I'm sure you can guess what happens af

terwards. Do they fall in love? Do they end up together? You'll have to

watch the movie to discover the shocking conclusion.

Sarcasm aside. Stiles was kind enough to give Intermission an
interview to let us in on the life of a teen flick star.

INTERMISSION: How is your experience at Columbia different
from that of other college students?

JULIA STILES: I don't think my experience is necessarily dif
ferent because of my celebrity. If it is different, it's because I al

ready have a career and I'm working outside of school.

INT: Do you feel that you are typecast as a romantic comedy, girl

next-door type of actress? And if so, is this by your own volition?

JS: I see all of my own roles as different. I can see how hard it is to be pi

geonholed but I make my own choices. I choose movies by what excites me

about going into work everyday. Also, movies will, a lot of the times, end up dif-

ferently than what I'm expecting them to end up as.
INT: What was your favorite part of filming this movie?
JS: Definitely Prague. Oh, and horseback riding.
INT: And your least favorite part?
JS: Hmm ... the raining scene [in which her character runs out in
the rain with paparazzi chasing her]. It was a really cold scene, and
I was really wet.
INT: What makes this movie special?

JS: It's just a love story.
INT: In "Mona Lisa Smile," you play a woman who foregoes higher ed
ucation in order to marry her beau. How did you feel about that role?

JS: At first, 1 didn't understand why my character would have done that but

1 thought about it and she chose to marry a man that she loved and wanted to
spend her life with. I don't see anything wrong with that.

INT: Do you consider yourself a feminist?

JS: Yeah, but 1 think I have a different definition of what that word means than most
people probably do. My definition of a feminist means someone who is respectful
of women and someone who respects differences.

INT: Do you feel like you are a role model for younger girls? Do you want to be?
JS: I don't really feel like I am a role model, not in the sense that I'm perfect. But
I feel that being a role model is being someone who is honest and not a perfect per

son.
INT: If you could date a real-life prince now, who would it be?
JS: [Laughs] I can't imagine what we'd talk about. Who would I date? I'd date I

the rock star prince. Because it'd be more fun, and you wouldn't have
to worry about someone ironing your newspaper before you
drink your tea.



Personally, we think Julia Stiles is way hotter than Kirsten
Dunst (who looks like a boy with her short hair). Yeah, baby.
