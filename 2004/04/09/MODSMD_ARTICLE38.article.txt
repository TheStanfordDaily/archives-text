more prominent collections:

collection spent a half-century in Alexandria before landing here. It includes many volumes
from the 17th and 18th centuries.
* Early physician Borelli published his two-volume set, "De Motv Animalivm," in 1680 and
1699. It's now housed at Bell's, but can be yours for $10,000. These volumes are filled with
groundbreaking ideas in human anatomy, including an early treatise on how tendons and mus
cles leverage bones to create movement. The books, filled with illustrations, also document
early understandings of the heart's role in blood movement.
