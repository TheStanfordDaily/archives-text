# Stand up for your independents: The shop around the comer

1 walked in and gasped. I didn't even know they made these any
more. I just had to make sure so I stood still and listened. Smoky jazz
tunes or elevator music? Negative. There was just a quiet murmur of
voices, the ping-pinging of an old cash register, and those private whis
pers from the wares on the wall that were meant only for me.
Then 1 looked around: a floor-to-ceiling collection of books — new
ones, but also old ones, with the pretty, embroidered 'tome-ish' covers
that were a precursor to the marketing gloss of today (18-point font,
Fabio on the cover, one or two-word reviews — "thrilling!"). I then gin
gerly picked one up and flipped through the pages, feeling only the stiff,
enticing parchment that spells o-l-d. I went back to the first page: print
ed, 1906. A wary glance to the price that was penciled in on the top right
hand corner and I think my jaw dropped: ten dollars.
Not one to be distracted so easily, 1 stood firm and went for that ul
timate test: I took a deep breath and smelled. A cloying aroma of caf
feine and espresso beans? Nope. All 1 could smell was... musty. It was
true then — it was my favorite childhood cliche come alive.
Bell's Book Store at 536 Emerson St.in downtown Palo Alto, just off
University, is a real bookstore. It's filled with small creaking leather
chairs, the musky smell of old volumes, and a history. In 1935, Herbert
Bell, David Lawyer and a station wagon full of books gave birth to the
first bookstore that catered to Stanford students. Their slogan: "Buy
your books cheap at The College Book Company." Yes, that's right —
there was no ridiculously overpriced monolith perched atop White
Plaza back then.
Today Herbert Bell's wife Valeria Bell owns this independent
bookstore, an open, two-storied expanse that houses a massive se
lection of new, used and out-of-print books for both collectors and
readers. Some of its sources include yard sales, scouts, private li
braries and collections of Stanford professors. And with over 500
subject categories, it has some of the most expansive collections
(from history and horticulture to literature and children's books) on
the West Coast and beyond.
Independent bookstores — the ones that are left — have an entire
ly different approach to the buying and selling of books than your typi
cal neighborhood conglomerate. I warn you: Bell's isn't about elec
tronic books or price-slashing sales or any of the other gimmicks typical
of a Barnes and Nobles. (Although, I must admit, 1 know quite a few

people who have found brand new books here much cheaper than at
Borders.) Bell's is about the joy of reading.
Authors love such bookstores — word of mouth, it seems is still
the best P.R. Stephen King and Barbara Kingsolver attribute their
success to "hand-selling" and individual booksellers who recom
mended then-unknown books to their customers. I spoke to two in
telligent and articulate women who have spent their lives at the store,
and it was an interview, nay, a teatime chat about the passions of
reading that warmed my soul.
For Faith Bell (Herbert Bell's daughter and an active Palo Alto
resident) and Barbara Worl (a Stanford alum and noted Rosarian
who has worked at Bell's for over 50 years), Bell's Book Store is
about finding the perfect match between a book and a reader. The
women's faces lit up as they talked about the customer who bought
450 books for his newborn twins, or the families that have shopped
there for three generations, or the two friends in their twenties who
had decided to quit their jobs and go to Europe, entrusting the itin
erary entirely to Bell and Worl.
For readers it is about hunting down that elusive edition of "The
Count of Monte Cristo" or "Charlotte's Web" that changed their life 20
years ago. There are even those writing their dissertations on some un
known tail-end of a historical drama who come here and find an entire
library on obscurity awaiting them. It is about great-aunts who want
their nieces and nephews to grow up with the same magic that enrap
tured them. It is about something that the Internet can never fulfill for
you, something called "serendipitous browsing." Because who always
knows what they want?
There are numerous reasons to go to Bell's. You, in that Che Gue
vara shirt, here's a classic theme from the not-so-classic "You've got
Mail" for you: the big, bad, commercialized and predatory global book
store versus the small, authentic underdog. In 1980 there were 27 book
stores between California Avenue and Menlo Park — things have
changed a lot since then. Today one-fourth of all America's bookstores
have been driven out of business because of "politically problematic"
chains like Borders and because of the Internet, where you can find
books on Amazon.com or people selling books right out of their homes.
Of course, you could be that reader who wears the Maddox version of
Che's shirt. Or you could be like me, who takes her political fence-sit
ting seriously. After all, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; and a bookstore
is just that — a bookstore. Sometimes, what you can find fifteen min
utes away from you is a perfect little dream.
