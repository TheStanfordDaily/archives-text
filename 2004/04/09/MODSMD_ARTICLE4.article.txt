# Talk ties health, human rights

### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Arguing that global
health needs to be given
the same priority as
human-rights violations,
anthropologist and physi
cian Paul Farmer spoke last
night at Stanford's Bechtel
Conference Center.
"I feel like he's begin
ning a revolution of how
people see international
health and people are see
ing it in a more positive
light as something we can
change," said sophomore
Regan Johnson.
Attendees at the lec
ture included students,
human rights activists and
doctors, but Farmer's
message also reached a
national audience through
C-SPAN.
The event, titled "Not
My Specialty: The Nexus
of Health and Human
Rights," was the first an
nual S. T. Lee Lecture, a

series designed to raise
public understanding of
complex policy issues fac
ing the global community
in hopes of increasing
support for informed in
ternational cooperation
on a variety of issues.
"[There is a] huge cost
to inaction or mediocre
action," Farmer said of
the fight against infec
tious diseases.
As a seasoned worker
in some of the world's
poorest communities,
Farmer brought knowl
edge of what it takes to
provide health care in
underdeveloped areas of
the world. He starting by
asking the audience what
role research universi
ties like Stanford should
play in the infectious dis
ease arena.
"Funding would be the
major issue and secondly
programs like Stanford in Government
and Peace Corps — we have the ability
and the manpower to supply." said sopho
more Jessica Steinberg concerning Stan
ford's involvement in global health and
human rights.
Farmer's work produced effective
treatment for multi-drug resistant tuber
culosis in countries like Haiti. Farmer said
tuberculosis is seen as a public-health
problem because it's an airborne disease.
He added that policymakers often object
that treatment is too expensive, difficult to

implement and not cost-effective.
According to Farmer, one way to over
come this opposition is to start a conversa
tion — using objections as a springboard
for dialogue and getting straight to the
"heart of human rights debate."
"[There are] social inequalities that
haven't worked their way into health and
human rights literature," Farmer said.
Farmer discussed how his DOT-Plus
treatment model, a community-based
strategy to manage infectious diseases like
HIV/AIDS and multi-drug resistant tu
berculosis, has expanded to 30 different
operations worldwide.
Farmer also suggested the use of a
human-rights model for the "social cata
strophe" of HIV. If this model is applied,
more medications would be accessible to

people who would not be able to afford
healthcare under current conditions. The
human rights model is often used to ad
dress problems including water contami
nation and food shortage.
The main problem [in HIV treatment
in Haiti) was that the drugs were to expen
sive," Farmer said.
However, prices have recently dropped.
In one instance, the Clinton Foundation
negotiated costs for HIV treatment down
to a 50 cents a day.
The problem is simple from the per
spective of the one Haiti patient, whom
Farmer's presentation cited.
"Everyone with AIDS should be
able to get treatment, since we're all
God's children," he said. "Science is
for everyone."
