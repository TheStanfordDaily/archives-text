# Don't touch that egg: Eating vegan at Stanford
## 
### ANNA NORTH INTERMISSION FEATURES WRITER 
Sophomore Will Bishop likes a dollop of sour
cream on his black beans. He's been known to enjoy
ice cream, and his apple pies have won praise from
his fellow residents at co-op Chi Theta Chi. But Will
hasn't made a trip to the dairy aisle in more than a
year. He makes his ice cream from soy milk, his sour
cream from a mixture of soft tofu, rice vinegar, and
lemon juice. The secret to his flaky pie crust isn't
butter or margarine — it's coconut oil.
As a member of Stanford's small but significant

vegan population, Will eats a diet free of animal products. That means no
hardboiled Easter eggs this weekend, but it also rules out the Cadbury vari
ety. Vegans give up not just omelets and cheeseburgers, but also milk choco
late, many baked goods, and, if they're truly hardcore, even honey.
Why, the average eater might wonder, do they bother? After all, in
dulging in a milk chocolate bunny seems a far cry from butchering the furred
variety. Will would disagree. For him, as for many vegans, what matters is
how animals are treated.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), perhaps the most
famous organization to advocate the vegan lifestyle, ascribes to this view.
On her Web site, AskCarla.com, PETA columnist Carla Bennett says tiny
cages and the stress of constant laying destroy the lives of egg-producing
hens. With a precision that suggests religious as well as farming experience,
she writes, "Each egg from today's egg factory farms represents 22-hours of
hell fora hen."
According to Bennett, their bovine brethren don't fare much better.
Dairy cows, she writes, develop udder infections from unsanitary conditions,
and are typically slaughtered after living only a quarter of their natural lifes
pan. Since their milk is meant for sale, the calves they bear receive milk sub
stitutes, which can include the blood of their fellow cows.
Not all vegans bring up bovine vampirism in discussions of their diet. Ju
nior Emmett Hopkins, who describes his vegan fare as "everything you can't
eat on the Atkins diet," is vegan for health reasons. He says getting his pro
tein from vegetables instead of meat will help him avoid such ailments as kid
ney stones.
Whatever the reason for adopting it, sticking with veganism can be tough.
Animal products aren't always as obvious as a fresh egg or a side of beef.
Carla says certain wineries use blood and bone marrow to filter their wine.
And the sugar production process can involve ground cow bone. The princi
ples of veganism are tricky to follow — unless you're a regular visitor to the
PETA Web site, you might not know when you're cheating.
Then of course there's the issue of convenience. Late night Jack-in-the-
Box runs are out for Will and Emmett — they've cut out fast food entirely.
While California dining has been kind to Will, eating out in his home state of
North Carolina requires "a lot of shifting of menus." When he goes home, he
has to do most of his own cooking to meet his dietary needs.
Here at Stanford, the Office of Residential Dining does its best to accom
modate those needs. I spoke with Rafi Taherian, Associate Director of Res
idential Dining and once a vegan himself. He told me vegans make up be
tween 1.5 and 2 percent of Stanford meal plan holders, according to twice
yearly dining surveys. Though they are a small minority, it's Stanford's job to
make sure vegans never feel "left out of any offering."
This means a policy of one vegan entree at every station. Taherian took
me to Wilbur Dining, where I found Boca Burgers at the grill, avocado on the
sushi bar, and an entire vegan saute station serving Provencal vegetables.
One station, though, served baked salmon, risotto, and zucchini spaghetti -
all made with butter. "I will follow up," he assured me, "regarding that par
ticular platform."
Despite this slip-up, Taherian told me he doesn't get many complaints
from vegans. He can remember one e-mail this year — it cited lack of vari
ety, always a concern when there are carnivores to feed as well. But Taher
ian said the variety issue is largely a merchandising problem. The one-entree
per-station rule means a vegan dish may be sandwiched between two meat
dishes, causing vegans to ignore it.
Over a vegan lunch at Ricker Dining, which included Boston baked
beans, vegan pizza, sauteed zucchini and fresh fruit, Taherian explained the
need to keep vegan options integrated with other foods. "We don't want to
make a vegan different from every other student," he told me. Stanford Din
ing tries to build community, and"the more students are segregated, the less
we are successful."
Of course, many vegan students tend to congregate in co-ops, where they

can get their fill of soy cream and coconut oil pie crust. Will, for instance, en
joys being part of the preparation of his food. He'd even eat meat if he could
kill it in the wild, free from the cruel practices of factory farms. In fact, Will
and a friend once butchered a wild boar that had been struck by a passing car.
The authorities stopped them — apparently the state of California would
rather its citizens not eat roadkill.
Despite his decidedly hands-on tactics, Will might approve of the com
munity dining halls foster. He finds that most people respond with interest to
his vegan lifestyle, and may eat more vegan meals as a result. Emmett agrees;
he says his choice "engages debates," and that vegan offerings can help car
nivores appreciate the tastiness of plant-based diets.
Encouraging such appreciation is enough for Will and Emmett; they're no
vegan evangelists. Will doesn't think butchering your own boar is the only
way to go, or that ham and cheese sandwiches are evil. If he has a message for
lovers of meat and dairy, it's simply, "be honest to yourself... It's easy to eat
this formless meat because it tastes really good," he says, "but it's hard to
think about the process behind it."
Stanford won't be going vegan anytime soon. Meat consumption is way
up this year, a fact Taherian attributes to the popularity of the Atkins diet.
However, he's now planning the first campus-wide Vegan Night, in which all
dining halls will feature a variety of tasty vegetable dishes. Will's presence at
Chi Theta Chi has turned fried eggplant and tofu-peanut-butter stirfry from
curiosities into popular favorites. And vegan awareness at Stanford is
spreading to other schools — Taherian says Ivy League dining programs
look to him for advice. His presence at Stanford might bring hummus and
tempeh to dining halls nationwide. So even if plenty of chocolate bunnies still
meet their doom this Easter, he's got something to be proud of.
Editors note: The above opinions expressed are not necessarily shared by nor
endorsed by the editorial staff of Intermission, but we support Will Bishop
and fellow Vegans in their beliefs. Barrett Winston Sheridan enjoys dining at
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles House in Hollywood, and prefers for his
women to enjoy the finer nuances of Italian and French cuisine. Tam Vo will
be attacking her annual stash of marshmallow Peeps (both bunnies and
chickens, to be an equal opportunity sugar fiend) with relish this Easter, and
refuses to date boys who don't enjoy a filling meal of good ol' meat and pota
toes —plus, shed wouldn't be hired anywhere as a pastry chef if she didn't
use butter. Do you think that eating honey supports the oppression of bees,
who basically upchuck the nectar they've suck from plants all day into neat lit
tle wax hexagons? Do you think bbeling lipgloss as vegan is excessive? Were
you truly moved by "Charlotte's Web" and "Babe?" E-mail us at intermis

Look at these Veggie Talcs characters and tell me you don't feel bad
about being vegan now. You never see a piece of steak personfied.

Dairy cows, she writes, develop udder infections from unsanitary conditions,
and are typically slaughtered after living only a quarter of their natural lifes
pan. Since their milk is meant for sale, the calves they bear receive milk sub
stitutes, which can include the blood of their fellow cows.
Not all vegans bring up bovine vampirism in discussions of their diet. Ju
nior Emmett Hopkins, who describes his vegan fare as "everything you can't
eat on the Atkins diet," is vegan for health reasons. He says getting his pro
tein from vegetables instead of meat will help him avoid such ailments as kid
ney stones.
Whatever the reason for adopting it, sticking with veganism can be tough.
Animal products aren't always as obvious as a fresh egg or a side of beef.
Carla says certain wineries use blood and bone marrow to filter their wine.
And the sugar production process can involve ground cow bone. The princi
ples of veganism are tricky to follow — unless you're a regular visitor to the
PETA Web site, you might not know when you're cheating.
Then of course there's the issue of convenience. Late night Jack-in-the-
Box runs are out for Will and Emmett — they've cut out fast food entirely.
While California dining has been kind to Will, eating out in his home state of
North Carolina requires "a lot of shifting of menus." When he goes home, he
has to do most of his own cooking to meet his dietary needs.
Here at Stanford, the Office of Residential Dining does its best to accom
modate those needs. I spoke with Rafi Taherian, Associate Director of Res
idential Dining and once a vegan himself. He told me vegans make up be
tween 1.5 and 2 percent of Stanford meal plan holders, according to twice
yearly dining surveys. Though they are a small minority, it's Stanford's job to
make sure vegans never feel "left out of any offering."
This means a policy of one vegan entree at every station. Taherian took
me to Wilbur Dining, where I found Boca Burgers at the grill, avocado on the
sushi bar, and an entire vegan saute station serving Provencal vegetables.
One station, though, served baked salmon, risotto, and zucchini spaghetti -
all made with butter. "I will follow up," he assured me, "regarding that par
ticular platform."
Despite this slip-up, Taherian told me he doesn't get many complaints
from vegans. He can remember one e-mail this year — it cited lack of vari
ety, always a concern when there are carnivores to feed as well. But Taher
ian said the variety issue is largely a merchandising problem. The one-entree
per-station rule means a vegan dish may be sandwiched between two meat
dishes, causing vegans to ignore it.
Over a vegan lunch at Ricker Dining, which included Boston baked
beans, vegan pizza, sauteed zucchini and fresh fruit, Taherian explained the
need to keep vegan options integrated with other foods. "We don't want to
make a vegan different from every other student," he told me. Stanford Din
ing tries to build community, and"the more students are segregated, the less
we are successful."
Of course, many vegan students tend to congregate in co-ops, where they

can get their fill of soy cream and coconut oil pie crust. Will, for instance, en
joys being part of the preparation of his food. He'd even eat meat if he could
kill it in the wild, free from the cruel practices of factory farms. In fact, Will
and a friend once butchered a wild boar that had been struck by a passing car.
The authorities stopped them — apparently the state of California would
rather its citizens not eat roadkill.
Despite his decidedly hands-on tactics, Will might approve of the com
munity dining halls foster. He finds that most people respond with interest to
his vegan lifestyle, and may eat more vegan meals as a result. Emmett agrees;
he says his choice "engages debates," and that vegan offerings can help car
nivores appreciate the tastiness of plant-based diets.
Encouraging such appreciation is enough for Will and Emmett; they're no
vegan evangelists. Will doesn't think butchering your own boar is the only
way to go, or that ham and cheese sandwiches are evil. If he has a message for
lovers of meat and dairy, it's simply, "be honest to yourself... It's easy to eat
this formless meat because it tastes really good," he says, "but it's hard to
think about the process behind it."
Stanford won't be going vegan anytime soon. Meat consumption is way
up this year, a fact Taherian attributes to the popularity of the Atkins diet.
However, he's now planning the first campus-wide Vegan Night, in which all
dining halls will feature a variety of tasty vegetable dishes. Will's presence at
Chi Theta Chi has turned fried eggplant and tofu-peanut-butter stirfry from
curiosities into popular favorites. And vegan awareness at Stanford is
spreading to other schools — Taherian says Ivy League dining programs
look to him for advice. His presence at Stanford might bring hummus and
tempeh to dining halls nationwide. So even if plenty of chocolate bunnies still
meet their doom this Easter, he's got something to be proud of.

Sophomore Will Bishop likes a dollop of sour
cream on his black beans. He's been known to enjoy
ice cream, and his apple pies have won praise from
his fellow residents at co-op Chi Theta Chi. But Will
hasn't made a trip to the dairy aisle in more than a
year. He makes his ice cream from soy milk, his sour
cream from a mixture of soft tofu, rice vinegar, and
lemon juice. The secret to his flaky pie crust isn't
butter or margarine — it's coconut oil.
As a member of Stanford's small but significant

vegan population, Will eats a diet free of animal products. That means no
hardboiled Easter eggs this weekend, but it also rules out the Cadbury vari
ety. Vegans give up not just omelets and cheeseburgers, but also milk choco
late, many baked goods, and, if they're truly hardcore, even honey.
Why, the average eater might wonder, do they bother? After all, in
dulging in a milk chocolate bunny seems a far cry from butchering the furred
variety. Will would disagree. For him, as for many vegans, what matters is
how animals are treated.
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), perhaps the most
famous organization to advocate the vegan lifestyle, ascribes to this view.
On her Web site, AskCarla.com, PETA columnist Carla Bennett says tiny
cages and the stress of constant laying destroy the lives of egg-producing
hens. With a precision that suggests religious as well as farming experience,
she writes, "Each egg from today's egg factory farms represents 22-hours of
hell fora hen."
