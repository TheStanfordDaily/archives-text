### HART GILULA CLASSICAL MUSIC CONNOISSEUR 
Are you afraid of classical music? Do you like listen
ing to it but feel that you need a doctorate in musicology
to truly appreciate it? If so, discard all of your prejudices
and give some professional classical music a chance. You
need nothing more than a willing ear. San Francisco is
one of the best cities for classical music in the United
States; it's a shame to miss such an opportunity, especial
ly if you're a senior ready to move out of the Bay Area —

make sure you get
to see the San
Francisco Sym
phony at least
once before you
graduate.
Classical music
has long been too
expensive to fit
into a college stu
dent's budget but
with the current
wide range of stu
dent subscription
and rush pro
grams, it has
never been more
affordable to ex
perience live clas
sical music by
some of the
world's great
est musicians.
The following
are but a few of
the highlights of
this spring's clas
sical offerings.
I've included the
Websites for the
various organiza-

tions presenting these performances. Also be sure to
check out San Francisco Classical Voice at

music in the Bay area with news, reviews and calendars.

• May 27 and 29 at 8 p.m. — San Francisco Symphony
Music Director Michael Tilson Thomas conducts a
staged concert production of Beethoven's only opera,
"Fidelio". Last year's staged concert version of Wagner's
"The Flying Dutchman" was amazing and it will be inter
esting to see how director Stephen Pickover utilizes the
Davies Hall space to stage the piece.
