Fran/ Ferdinand: "Fran/ Ferdinand"
More fanciful critics might compare the talk cen
tered around Glasgow quartet Franz Ferdinand to
the hooplah surrounding the band's namesake, the
Austro-Hungarian archduke Ferdinand whose as
sassination sparked the first World War. But the mu
sical Franz's prove better than the spoiled aristocrat
who fell into fame after getting shot by a Serbian na
tional. In short, "Franz Ferdinand" earns every word
of the band's tremendous hype.
With their distinctly art-punk sound and look, it's
easy to group Franz Ferdinand with their similarly
hyped New York contemporaries the Strokes. But
"Franz Ferdinand" has a British tinge which sets it
apart from the New York scene. "Take Me Out," the
album's first single, starts as driving art-punk, but
morphs into a mid-tempo disco romp, as if Blur
staged a sudden coup on Julian Casablancas' garage
rock hegemony. Songs like "In the Dark of the Mati
nee" favor high hats and Hot Hot Heat, but offer
melodies that sound more like Suede than anything
out of New York.
Franz Ferdinand may recall groups like Interpol
or The Rapture, but like the Brit-rock greats, they
temper art with anthem. Perhaps the most impres
sive thing about this record is that it doesn't signal a
bold new movement like The Rapture, The Strokes
or that unfortunate Austro-Hungarian archduke, but
that it might have actually saved the flagging behe
moth of the floundering art-punk revival.
Sondrc Lerche: "Two Way Monologue"
Sondre Lerche was signed to Virgin Records at
the tender age of 16 and released a chart-topping EP
before his 18th birthday. At the ripe old age of 21.
Lerche has released a sophomore full-length "Two
Way Monologue" that finally establishes him as a
mature, talented songwriter. It's about time.
"Monologue" owes a lot to Lerche's vocal muse
Nick Drake, as well as '60's orchestral pop. Lerche
cops Drake's aching croon in songs like "Track You
Down," but his melodies and lush string arrange-

ments recall
Paul McCart
ney or the
swinging Bosto
nians Orpheus.
The endearing
awkwardness of
"Monologue" is
its best selling
point. On the title
track, Ixrche be
gins with a simple
strummed pas
sage, almost
ukelele-like, and
sings like a shy
folk troubadour.

The track then builds into a full-band piece and offers an
exuberant chorus reminiscent of "Tigermilk"-era Belle
and Sebastian.
"Two Way Monologue" is an album of more
indie-pop comforts than risks, but it appeals to
a wide variety of listeners. At 21, Lerche has
already covered great territory, and if he con
tinues his pace he could become this decade's

Beck. That is, if Beck was only the bookish so
cial introvert Dr. Jekyll and not the sex-crazed
extrovert Mr. Hyde.
Now It's Overhead: "Fall Back Open"
On MTV's dating show "Room Raiders," a
savvy investigator breaks into a college resi
dence, rummages through three rooms and picks
the inhabitant of the room he/she likes best to ask
out on a date. This show has been all over the
country; no dorm room is safe. To prepare against
this kind of scrutiny, you're going to need help
that only Now It's Overhead's "Fall Back Open"
can provide.
Picture this: hip. hot music critic Jennifer, bored
with the guys she meets in her profession, appears on
"Room Raiders" to find a date. She enters the first
room; his beer is boring and his books are low-brow.
This should be quick.
On his desk, she finds "Fall Back Open." She
dumps it into the stereo, intrigued. She's impressed
by the driving beat and R.E.M.-inspired chorus of the
opener "Wait in a Line." The room's occupant
watches from MTV's studios, thrilled that a girl is in
his room at all.
She continues through the new-wave "Surren
der" and "Profile," remarking on how the record
effortlessly channels Depeche Mode. By the time
she reaches the marvelous shoegaze of closers
"Reverse," "Antidote," and"A Little Consola
tion," she's made her decision. "1 must meet this
guy," she announces.
The scenario may be unlikely, but remember this:
in this year's spring break edition of "Room
Raiders," a music critic much like Jennifer rejected a
contestant solely on the basis of a Lou Bega album in
his collection. Don't make the same mistake; buy this
album. It'll win hearts, and it's got some great rock
and roll to boot.




I bet he knitted his own scarf and
mittens — every good hipster does.

Oh wait, we're not British."

The track then builds into a full-band piece and offers an
exuberant chorus reminiscent of "Tigermilk"-era Belle
and Sebastian.
"Two Way Monologue" is an album of more
indie-pop comforts than risks, but it appeals to
a wide variety of listeners. At 21, Lerche has
already covered great territory, and if he con
tinues his pace he could become this decade's

Beck. That is, if Beck was only the bookish so
cial introvert Dr. Jekyll and not the sex-crazed
extrovert Mr. Hyde.
Now It's Overhead: "Fall Back Open"
On MTV's dating show "Room Raiders," a
savvy investigator breaks into a college resi
dence, rummages through three rooms and picks
the inhabitant of the room he/she likes best to ask
out on a date. This show has been all over the
country; no dorm room is safe. To prepare against
this kind of scrutiny, you're going to need help
that only Now It's Overhead's "Fall Back Open"
can provide.
Picture this: hip. hot music critic Jennifer, bored
with the guys she meets in her profession, appears on
"Room Raiders" to find a date. She enters the first
room; his beer is boring and his books are low-brow.
This should be quick.
On his desk, she finds "Fall Back Open." She
dumps it into the stereo, intrigued. She's impressed
by the driving beat and R.E.M.-inspired chorus of the
opener "Wait in a Line." The room's occupant
watches from MTV's studios, thrilled that a girl is in
his room at all.
She continues through the new-wave "Surren
der" and "Profile," remarking on how the record
effortlessly channels Depeche Mode. By the time
she reaches the marvelous shoegaze of closers
"Reverse," "Antidote," and"A Little Consola
tion," she's made her decision. "1 must meet this
guy," she announces.
The scenario may be unlikely, but remember this:
in this year's spring break edition of "Room
Raiders," a music critic much like Jennifer rejected a
contestant solely on the basis of a Lou Bega album in
his collection. Don't make the same mistake; buy this
album. It'll win hearts, and it's got some great rock
and roll to boot.




I bet he knitted his own scarf and
mittens — every good hipster does.


"Lovely day fora picnic in the woods, I daresay
Oh wait, we're not British."

Fran/ Ferdinand: "Fran/ Ferdinand"
More fanciful critics might compare the talk cen
tered around Glasgow quartet Franz Ferdinand to
the hooplah surrounding the band's namesake, the
Austro-Hungarian archduke Ferdinand whose as
sassination sparked the first World War. But the mu
sical Franz's prove better than the spoiled aristocrat
who fell into fame after getting shot by a Serbian na
tional. In short, "Franz Ferdinand" earns every word
of the band's tremendous hype.
With their distinctly art-punk sound and look, it's
easy to group Franz Ferdinand with their similarly
hyped New York contemporaries the Strokes. But
"Franz Ferdinand" has a British tinge which sets it
apart from the New York scene. "Take Me Out," the
album's first single, starts as driving art-punk, but
morphs into a mid-tempo disco romp, as if Blur
staged a sudden coup on Julian Casablancas' garage
rock hegemony. Songs like "In the Dark of the Mati
nee" favor high hats and Hot Hot Heat, but offer
melodies that sound more like Suede than anything
out of New York.
Franz Ferdinand may recall groups like Interpol
or The Rapture, but like the Brit-rock greats, they
temper art with anthem. Perhaps the most impres
sive thing about this record is that it doesn't signal a
bold new movement like The Rapture, The Strokes
or that unfortunate Austro-Hungarian archduke, but
that it might have actually saved the flagging behe
moth of the floundering art-punk revival.
Sondrc Lerche: "Two Way Monologue"
Sondre Lerche was signed to Virgin Records at
the tender age of 16 and released a chart-topping EP
before his 18th birthday. At the ripe old age of 21.
Lerche has released a sophomore full-length "Two
Way Monologue" that finally establishes him as a
mature, talented songwriter. It's about time.
"Monologue" owes a lot to Lerche's vocal muse
Nick Drake, as well as '60's orchestral pop. Lerche
cops Drake's aching croon in songs like "Track You
Down," but his melodies and lush string arrange-

ments recall
Paul McCart
ney or the
swinging Bosto
nians Orpheus.
The endearing
awkwardness of
"Monologue" is
its best selling
point. On the title
track, Ixrche be
gins with a simple
strummed pas
sage, almost
ukelele-like, and
sings like a shy
folk troubadour.

The track then builds into a full-band piece and offers an
exuberant chorus reminiscent of "Tigermilk"-era Belle
and Sebastian.
"Two Way Monologue" is an album of more
indie-pop comforts than risks, but it appeals to

tinues his pace he could become this decade's
