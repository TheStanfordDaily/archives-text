# The
						Vines: a friend to Darwin

Sometimes you just wanna say "Fuck the world."
Over and over again, until the words become com-

pletely meaningless. The Vines promise that exact sort of

jubilant freedom on their new album, "Winning Days," and at

first glance their amped-up grunge rock antics seem to fit the

stereotype to a T — who can deny the cool crudeness of a band that
ends their new album with a track discreetly titled, "F.T.W.?"

Yet those who are looking for an unabashed, yell-your-lungs-out catharsis will be
caught off guard. Winning Days is far from your standard rock album — The Strokes
might be able to get away with unfailing consistency across two entire (albeit brief)
records, but lead singer / songwriter Craig Nicholls demonstrate an admirable willi
ingness to mix up both tempo and sound.
The album opens with "Ride," clearly the most radio-friendly of the tracks, com
plete with dirt simple guitar hooks, a cavalier yowl and hand claps — I'm such a suck
er for hand claps. "Animal Machine" is a serviceable homage (or rip-off) to the inde
structible Nirvana aesthetic, and "F.T.W." delivers exactly what it advertises: a crazed
anthem dedicated to blowing out our stereos.
But then the floor drops out from under us. What greets us after the first two songs
is a multi-track jaunt through weird territory, where '60s psychedelia mashes occa
sionally with the rock we expect. For the most part, though, it's languid, droopy flower
power anthems for quite a while — the ghostly vocals on "TV Pro" may be punctured
by glorious bursts of meaningless jabber, but "Autumn Shade II" confirms Nicholls's
desire to slow the world down fora while and just stare into the sun (preferably in a
drug-induced haze).
By the time the slow and morose "Evil Town" rolls around, many may want to
leave, but the title track "Winning Days" easily re-establishes interest. Beginning with
just Nicholls's vocals over a sparse acoustic line, it's the most effortless winner on the
disc; a clear window into the promise and potential of the man. It's even got a fake end
ing — how wicked is that?
Of course, it shouldn't be a complete surprise that The Vines turn out to be consis
tently sunnier and more melodic than their "The" moniker suggests. Their 2002 debut,
"Highly Evolved," contained its own unexpected dreamy center. Sandwiched in be
tween the feral screams and the crunchy, buzzing guitars that made it seem like The
Vines were coming to GET YOU, "Highly Evolved" also contained more lackadaisi
cal numbers like "Country Yard," "Mary Jane" and the "Autumn Shade." Not quite
the rock-out we were expecting, but the perfect soundtrack to summer.
Winning Days has its share of mid-tempo cuts as well — "She's Got Something to
Say" and "Rainfall" have a nice, comfortable drive to them — and the only real knock
against the music is that most of the lyrics are simply incoherent. Nicholls receives both
critical flack and rock-star idolatry for his known affinity for hitting the hash, and while
it may allow for more artistic freedom the lyrics do feel a tad lazy. Take this relatively
meaningful snippet from "Evil Town": "Evil is what you are I As well as being sharp /
I fell right to it / She sells and I don't. Like it feels." It's this kind of near-meaning —
kinda like Japanese pseudo-Engrish — that bars the music from achieving a higher
level of resonance.
And yet, this flaw will be easily forgiven in the summer sun of days to come. For all
its unexpected languor, "Winning Days" has actually redeemed The Vines in my mind
— its unique mixture of laid-back tempos and rediscovered grunge make for quite a
pleasurable experience. Even without the weed.
