# Roxy Sass: Q&A (tastes like burning)
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
This week Roxy opened her inbox, and let me just
say, you all have MAJOR issues. Not that I don't mind
answering your sexual queries, but arc there that many
people on this campus that get themselves into awk
ward sex situations? Here are a few of the highlights:
Dear Roxy,
A few nights ago my boyfriend and 1 were having in
tense foreplay. Head was exchanged, and we had even
managed to slip into a delightful 69 position, a rare treat
for me. However, moments into the 69, my boyfriend
went a little too far — and started to "toss my salad," if
you know what I mean.
While I enjoyed the sensation, it came as quite a sur
prise, enough to the point where I nearly lost my horny
mood. What do I do? How can I prepare myself for
something like this? Is this a sign that he wants me to re
turn the favor?
Sincerely,
Desperately Seeking Sneeze-Guard
Dear D.D.S.G.,
While I have consistently been a fan of an old-fash
ioned quality rim job, it's normally a taboo sex act on
this campus, sad to say. And from your description, I'd
say that you're a lucky person to have a boyfriend will
ing to give it a try. That said, if any sex partner begins to
show an interest in the anal region-extra caressing, nim
ble finger work-make sure that it's comfortable for you.
But for the sake of your own health, excuse yourself
and clean up that area in the nearest restroom; diseases
like hepatitis and intestinal parasites can be contracted
from an unclean booty. As for the question of reciproc
ity, while you are not under any obligation to toss any
salad of your own, you might want to think about ex
panding your own sexual boundaries and give it a try.
For many women who find anal sex uncomfortable and
painful, a well-executed ass-licking can be an eye-open
ing warmup to opening up other orifices.

Dear Rox,
Last quarter my partner and I decided to start experimenting with various sa
vory food items during sex. Having mastered whipped cream, chocolate sauce
and honey, a couple of weeks ago we tried peanut butter, and the results were or
gasmic ally fan tas tic.
Hut two days ago I got my period, and when I pulled the tampon out the other
day there were black spots on the tampon. I went to the gynecologist at Vaden and
she told me that there were maggots living in my vagina! Having been humiliat
ed and absolutely revolted from this experience, how do I tell my partner about
this and how can I prevent this from happening in the future?
— "Clark, we need you!"
Dear Clark,
EWWWWWWWWWW. While I am no stranger to some of the more un
pleasant details of sexual activity, dear readers, reading this makes me com
pletely sickened. It should be plainly obvious to any individual or couple ex
perimenting with food that basic rules of safety and caution should be applied:
wash any fruits or vegetables before sticking them ANYWHERE, and after
playing with liquids or otherwise non-solid substances thoroughly wash and
douche all involved areas.

Roxy,
lam in a very committed relationship — my girlfriend and I have been going
out for almost two years. While Hove her very much and have never desired to
cheat on her, / constantly fantasize about having a threesome with her and her
best friend. I jack off to this mental image all the time, and really would like to see
it happen. How can I bring it up to my girlfriend without making her feel inade
quate or having her dump me?
Thanks,
Wanting to Trilogize
DearTrilogize,
It's nice to know that you're used to whacking off to this mental image, be
cause chances are that given your attitude, those mental images are the closest
you'll ever come to the delicious excitement of a menage-a-trois. Put yourself
in the opposite situation: say your girlfriend asked you to have a threeway with
another guy, would you do it? This isn't to say that in a relationship each part
ner has the same sexual boundaries, but if you're comfortable with having your
partner broach the subject of a threesome and then comfortable with it actual
ly happening, that says a lot about your relationship with your partner.
As for implementing your own sexy strategy, I would suggest incorporating
the subject of fantasies into your normal sex life, especially by talking dirty.
While it's not a guarantee that yelling "Oh man, I want to fuck you in half' will
make the idea of a threesome more attractive, it will incite a degree of sexual
adventure and flirty fun into the sack.
Just remember, do not invite anyone to join you and your partner in an ex
citing threesome as a "gift" for the other person, they aren't the equivalent of
a jacket from Macy's. Threesomes should be formed on mutual grounds, be
cause all three people want to messy up the sheets with each other. Just re
member: fucking two halves doesn't necessarily equal a whole, and you needn't
press the issue with your girlfriend if she rejects your fantasy.

this campus, sad to say. And from your description, I'd
say that you're a lucky person to have a boyfriend will
ing to give it a try. That said, if any sex partner begins to
show an interest in the anal region-extra caressing, nim
ble finger work-make sure that it's comfortable for you.
But for the sake of your own health, excuse yourself
and clean up that area in the nearest restroom; diseases
like hepatitis and intestinal parasites can be contracted
from an unclean booty. As for the question of reciproc
ity, while you are not under any obligation to toss any
salad of your own, you might want to think about ex
panding your own sexual boundaries and give it a try.
For many women who find anal sex uncomfortable and
painful, a well-executed ass-licking can be an eye-open
ing warmup to opening up other orifices.

Dear Rox,
Last quarter my partner and I decided to start experimenting with various sa
vory food items during sex. Having mastered whipped cream, chocolate sauce
and honey, a couple of weeks ago we tried peanut butter, and the results were or
gasmic ally fan tas tic.
Hut two days ago I got my period, and when I pulled the tampon out the other
day there were black spots on the tampon. I went to the gynecologist at Vaden and
she told me that there were maggots living in my vagina! Having been humiliat
ed and absolutely revolted from this experience, how do I tell my partner about
this and how can I prevent this from happening in the future?
— "Clark, we need you!"
Dear Clark,
EWWWWWWWWWW. While I am no stranger to some of the more un
pleasant details of sexual activity, dear readers, reading this makes me com
pletely sickened. It should be plainly obvious to any individual or couple ex
perimenting with food that basic rules of safety and caution should be applied:
wash any fruits or vegetables before sticking them ANYWHERE, and after
playing with liquids or otherwise non-solid substances thoroughly wash and
douche all involved areas.

Roxy,
lam in a very committed relationship — my girlfriend and I have been going
out for almost two years. While Hove her very much and have never desired to
cheat on her, / constantly fantasize about having a threesome with her and her
best friend. I jack off to this mental image all the time, and really would like to see
it happen. How can I bring it up to my girlfriend without making her feel inade
quate or having her dump me?
Thanks,

DearTrilogize,
It's nice to know that you're used to whacking off to this mental image, be
cause chances are that given your attitude, those mental images are the closest
you'll ever come to the delicious excitement of a menage-a-trois. Put yourself
in the opposite situation: say your girlfriend asked you to have a threeway with
another guy, would you do it? This isn't to say that in a relationship each part
ner has the same sexual boundaries, but if you're comfortable with having your
partner broach the subject of a threesome and then comfortable with it actual
ly happening, that says a lot about your relationship with your partner.
As for implementing your own sexy strategy, I would suggest incorporating
the subject of fantasies into your normal sex life, especially by talking dirty.
While it's not a guarantee that yelling "Oh man, I want to fuck you in half' will
make the idea of a threesome more attractive, it will incite a degree of sexual
adventure and flirty fun into the sack.
Just remember, do not invite anyone to join you and your partner in an ex
citing threesome as a "gift" for the other person, they aren't the equivalent of
a jacket from Macy's. Threesomes should be formed on mutual grounds, be
cause all three people want to messy up the sheets with each other. Just re
member: fucking two halves doesn't necessarily equal a whole, and you needn't
press the issue with your girlfriend if she rejects your fantasy.

This week Roxy opened her inbox, and let me just
say, you all have MAJOR issues. Not that I don't mind
answering your sexual queries, but arc there that many
people on this campus that get themselves into awk
ward sex situations? Here are a few of the highlights:
Dear Roxy,
A few nights ago my boyfriend and 1 were having in
tense foreplay. Head was exchanged, and we had even
managed to slip into a delightful 69 position, a rare treat
for me. However, moments into the 69, my boyfriend
went a little too far — and started to "toss my salad," if
you know what I mean.
While I enjoyed the sensation, it came as quite a sur
prise, enough to the point where I nearly lost my horny
mood. What do I do? How can I prepare myself for
something like this? Is this a sign that he wants me to re
turn the favor?
Sincerely,
Desperately Seeking Sneeze-Guard
