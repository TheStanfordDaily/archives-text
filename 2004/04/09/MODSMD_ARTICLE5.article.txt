# Barber becomes Stanford institution

### EVA DEHLINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Barber Newell Whitford has
been at Stanford for over 50 years
and is still going strong. With the
help of his business partner of about
40 years, Carmello Cogliandro,
Whitford runs "Stanford Hair," the
campus' barber shop and hair salon.
Originally from Oklahoma,
Whitford has been a resident of Red
wood City for the majority of his life
and at Stanford for almost as long.
"I started at Stanford in 1951,"
Whitford said. "It was my uncle's
shop back then."
At that time, there were two
barber shops on campus — the first
in what is now Old Union and an
other in the basement of Encina.
Both were run by Whitford's fami
ly. The Encina shop closed in 1956
following the decision to stop hous
ing freshmen there in 1954, Whit
ford explained.
In 1962, the shop in Old Union
moved to where Jamba Juice is
now. Eight years ago, it moved
again to its current location nestled
between the Fitness Center and
The Stanford Store on the first floor
of Tresidder Union.
"It was called the Stanford Bar
ber Shop back then," Whitford said,
speaking of the earlier incarnations
of the current shop. "But it's evolved

now into a full service salon — it's a
shop for men, women, ethnic hair,
cuts, perm and color."
Whitman himself remains pri
marily a barber.
The location and name of the
shop is not the only change Whit
ford witnessed in his time at Stan
ford, as passing decades brought dif
ferent hairstyles.
"We went from real short in the
'50s to real long when the protest years
came along," Whitford explained.
"We went from 10 chairs down to
three chairs with the long hair."
The effects of the Vietnam War
on the campus barber shop were
not permanent — when politics
and styles changed, hair started
getting shorter, and business
picked up again.
"Now we do a lot of short men's
cuts again," said Whitford, who
currently has seven other cutters
working with him, most of whom
are stylists.
Although Whitford found that
students were "particularity in
tense" during the protest genera
tion, the student body remains
one of the reasons Whitford has
kept at his work.
"I like working with students,"
he said. "It's the kids really. It keeps
you young."
Students in turn are initially at
tracted to the shop by the location

and the reasonable prices.
"It's convenient," said junior
Todd Fojo.
Many students after graduation
find reasons to keep coming back.
Alumnus Alfred Dell Kirkland,
Class of '53, a Menlo Park resi
dent, has gone to Whitford for
haircuts since 1951.
"Newell gives good haircuts,
and is one of my favorite guys,"
Kirkland said.
Whitford's service was so reli
able and Kirkland was so continual
a customer that when Kirkland
once went on a three-month vaca
tion, he had to ask Whitford how to
instruct another barber.
A handful of alumni have re
turned over the years to have Whit
ford cut their hair. As his cus
tomers have aged, Whitford has
seen some pass away. He has also
had the pleasure of meeting the
children of others.
In addition to the ever-renewing
student body and faithful alumni,
dizzying amounts and types of heads
have passed through Stanford Hair.
"We've done all the presi
dents' hair since we opened,"
Whitford said. "We see some re
ally neat people."
He continued, "We're here to
serve the Stanford Community.
We try to do the best we can, at de
cent prices."
