# Lee-Mefford win
## Senate and GSC to discuss certification of vote in light of campaign conduct 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Though the computer-tallied results of last week's ASSU elections were
announced on Friday evening at the Coffee House, it could take several
weeks to sort out a messy executive race.
The tally showed a clear victory for the slate of senior Mikey Lee and
junior Dylan Mefford, who bested junior Ajani Husbands and sopho
more Alyssa Schwartz by over 300 votes. However, the results still need
to be certified by the Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC), where they could meet substantial resistance. In partic
ular, ASSU officers will be looking into whether a series of illegal e
mails sent to students on behalf of the Lee-Mefford campaign influ
enced the outcome.
Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin, a junior, said that certain individu
als on the commission might bring several cases before the University to de
termine whether any related actions violated Stanford Fundamental Stan
dard. Martin said she was especially concerned about the e-mail sent anony
mously by former ASSU Vice President Nick Rodriguez, a senior. Rodriguez
sent the message — titled "The Ugly Side of the ASSU" — to 11,746 Stan

ford e-mail addresses.
"If individuals on campus bring cases, the roots of these e-mails will be in
vestigated by the Office of Judicial Affairs," Martin said.
On Friday evening, Martin emphasized University investigation was only
one possible course of action, and that the opinions of many people within the
ASSU would influence any final decisions.
"We're not sure we're going to do it," she said. "We'll make the decision
when the dust settles."
For Lee and Mefford, the victory brought little relief from the controver
sy that has engulfed their campaign.
"It's definitely bittersweet to know that people are upset by some of our
past actions," Lee said. "As far as the certification of the elections goes, we
have to leave it to the Senate to vote and decide on that. I'm not going to push,
one way or the other. The priority for us right now is to assume that the re
sults will stand because there's so much to do as far as orienting ourselves to
these new positions."
Schwartz said she felt that the elections violations unfairly influenced vot
ers in favor of Lee and Mefford, but added that she trusts the Senate and GSC
to make the right decision when they decide whether to certify the election.
Meetings will be open to the public.
"Given the e-mails, I'm not surprised by the election results," Schwartz
said. "I will not contest the election if the Senate certifies it, but I will give
them my opinion at the meeting, which is that these results are not accurate."
She said she spoke with Lee immediately before the election results were
disclosed at 5 p.m. at the Co Ho.
