## Taking time to listen 
### PROF. ANDREA LUNSFORD DEPT. OF ENGLISH 
One of my maternal grandmother's maxims was
"Sister, if you want to hear, you have got to lis
ten." She reminded me of this and other enig
matic rules of behavior often, and while I've for
gotten many of them, this one has stuck.
Maybe that's why one of my favorite ways to occupy
myself as I walk from one side of our campus to the other
is to listen. Sometimes, I even close my eyes as the rhythms

of speech flow around me, and what I
like best is listening for different accents
and different languages.
On just one recent day of campus me
andering. I heard four different lan
guages — and, by my count, nine differ
ent accents. Listening tells me that our
campus fairly hums with the beat of
speech patterns from across the country
and around the globe.
My grandmother, Rosa May lowa
Brewer Cunningham, would have been

amazed and, I think, fascinated. She never traveled far from
her east Tennessee mountain home, where folks pretty
much sounded alike.
Proud of "graduating" from the ninth grade in her Quak
er school, she considered herself a well educated woman and
a storyteller, writing a poem for each new grandchild and
spinning tales "of an evening" from her front-porch rocker.
I can remember how much emphasis she put in certain
places ("you better get up here right now, young lady") —
and her very definite way with words.
"Honey," she'd say if I was especially dressed up, "you
look as pretty as red shoes." Prices at the store were always
"high as a cat's back" to my grandmother, and a hard rain
was always a "gully washer and a frog-strangler." She kept
her best dishes in the kitchen cupboard that she called "the
upper division," and she did not suffer fools gladly: "Once
that man's told you howdy," she'd say with disdain, "he's
told you all he knows."
No doubt listening to my grandmother helped cultivate
my love of words and my penchant for listening carefully to
patterns of speech. Little wonder, then, that I was a voracious
reader from the time I could string together a few words, or
that 1 was an English major in college.
When 1 left the South to attend graduate school, again in
English, I took these habits with me — along with my own
way of speaking, my southern accent.
In my second term in graduate school, one of the other
students said, "Hey, I owe you an apology. When we start
ed, 1 didn't pay attention to anything you said in class; I
guess I thought you weren't too bright."
When I seemed puzzled (not to say insulted), he thought
a moment and then said, "Well, you know, it's your South
ern accent." Now I'd been listening to his accent (Long Is
land) with delight, so in subsequent terms, we kept up a
spirited conversation about the different assumptions —
and values — we brought to issues of language variety.
That was a long time ago. And since then, I've lived in
many different places, from Vancouver, British
Columbia to Ripton, VT, so that, inevitably, my own ac
cent has changed. Nevertheless, I still cling tb the east
Tennessee rhythms I have left, and you can visit my "red
shoe" collection in honor of my grandmother and her way
with words any time.
But I also challenge others to keep a sharp eye out for
making judgments based on language differences, and since
I'm a professor, I often consider these issues in classes like
"The Language Wars," which I'll get a chance to teach
again next year. So watch out for me on campus; I'll be the
one listening hard — and loving every minute of it.
