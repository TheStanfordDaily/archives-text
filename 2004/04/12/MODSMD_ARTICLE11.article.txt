# Campus dining halls duke it out for culinary supremacy
## 
### KIRSTEN MORITZ STAFF WRITER 
It's easy to complain about the
dining halls around campus;
the food is monotonous, the
quality isn't great or the din
ing hall near your dorm doesn't
serve the type of food you like. On
recent visits to several of the dining
halls, I found that you definitely are
not going to get gourmet restaurant
food at every meal, but for the most
part, the people I spoke with were
quite happy with their dining hall
experiences.
I visited Stern dining hall for din
ner on April 4. To be honest, as a
Twain resident last year, I could not
wait to get away from Stern's food
at the end of spring quarter. It must
have had something to do with
Stern-overload and my readiness to
return home for the summer and to
prepare my own food.
On this particular night, I sam
pled a salad and an eggplant dish
from the vegan bar. Stern is known
around campus for its wide selec
tion and variety of offerings. Daily
specials included: a carving station
with rotisserie chicken, a "South of
the Border" burrito bar and an
Alaskan cod filet sandwich.
The eggplant was just okay — a
bit bitter and not well-cooked. The
selection at the salad bar was fresh
and abundant and even included
blue cheese crumbles to top off sal
ads. According to freshman Adri
enne Chung, the people who com
plain about the food at Stern are

often too harsh.
"The food isn't as bad as people
say it is. I really appreciate how
they have a lot of different types of
soy milk to choose from. The
workers are really nice here and
they play good music during lunch
and dinner."
The large variety at Stern is nice
and is in part made possible by the
enormous size of the serving area. It
is easy to move from one station to
the other, but I think that often, in
striving to provide such variety, the
quality of the food suffers. Com
pared with Lakeside dining, where
the small serving facility limits the
number of offerings, the quality at
Stern just doesn't stack up.
On my second foray away from
home I dined at Ricker in Gover
nor's Corner with Nadeem Sid
diqui, the executive director of
Stanford Dining. Last Thursday,
Ricker served up a Thanksgiving
style meal, complete with turkey,
mashed potatoes, vegetables and
rolls. Ricker, like Lakeside, is also
limited by its size — it has basically
only one serving line — but the fa
cility makes up for it with a large
salad bar in the main dining area
that features many of the options
you would normally pick up in the
serving area. Though Ricker might
not have the same selection as ot her
dining halls on campus, the menu
there and at the other facilities
changes daily.
"We run a five-week cycle with
menus so that the meals you eat
today you won't see again for an

other five weeks," Siddiqui said.
"Each dining hall doesn't have a
strict menu, because it changes
based on student feedback and
their requests."
Ricker is a peanut-sensitive fa
cility and does not serve foods
which contain peanut products. It is
closed on Friday and Saturday, so
students must go to Lakeside for
their meals.
Finally, 1 was able to eat at home
(Lakeside) but was unimpressed by
the offerings on Saturday. Maybe I
just wasn't all that hungry, so I set
tled on a bowl of good old matzo
ball soup. I know that this is not a
regular menu item, but it was the
only thing I felt like eating. Other
selections included a pasta bar with
the noodles so watered down that it
looked like they hadn't been
drained after they were cooked, a
grill line with hamburgers, veggie
burgers and the like, a tofu dish,
meatloaf, roasted tomatoes, rice
pilaf and chicken wings.
Despite my feelings over Satur
day's dinner, ever since 1 started
eating at Lakeside last fall, I've no
ticed higher-quality food than that
served at some of the other facilities
around campus. The selection at
lunch is outstanding, with hand
tossed salads, a build-your-own
sandwich bar, pizza, tostadas and
paninis. Lakeside also serves fresh
ly-baked cookies once or twice a
week at lunch. I have noticed a lack
of fresh, lean meat such as grilled
chicken breasts at Lakeside. It
would be nice if grilled chicken, like

hamburgers and veggie burgers,
was a daily selection at Lakeside
and at the other dining facilities.
Despite the varieties of each din
ing hall, I would have to agree with
Siddiqui that students' perceptions
of which facilities are "good" and
which are "bad" all depends on
where they live.
"For Ricker students, it's the
best dining hall on campus. Same
thing goes for Branner and all the
other places," Siddiqui said. "The
dining halls foster a community liv
ing spirit, and people really take
charge of their residential areas.
People live in different places and
become attached to them, and
therefore it is the best in their eyes."
Unfortunately, I did not have
time to dine at Wilbur, FloMo,
Manzanita or Branner. A few high
lights of each include:
Wilbur: A la carte options, in
cluding "just in time" (JIT)-made
sushi and Chinese food, and an ex
tensive grab-n-go area.
FloMo: The home of the famous
scoop ice cream.
Manzanita: Also a la carte, Man
zanita features a variety of grab-n
-go options.
Branner: Newly remodeled,
Branner's specialties include a
Euro-saute station and Chicago
style pizza.

enormous size of the serving area. It
is easy to move from one station to
the other, but I think that often, in
striving to provide such variety, the
quality of the food suffers. Com
pared with Lakeside dining, where
the small serving facility limits the
number of offerings, the quality at
Stern just doesn't stack up.
On my second foray away from
home I dined at Ricker in Gover
nor's Corner with Nadeem Sid
diqui, the executive director of
Stanford Dining. Last Thursday,
Ricker served up a Thanksgiving
style meal, complete with turkey,
mashed potatoes, vegetables and
rolls. Ricker, like Lakeside, is also
limited by its size — it has basically
only one serving line — but the fa
cility makes up for it with a large
salad bar in the main dining area
that features many of the options
you would normally pick up in the
serving area. Though Ricker might
not have the same selection as ot her
dining halls on campus, the menu
there and at the other facilities
changes daily.
"We run a five-week cycle with
menus so that the meals you eat
today you won't see again for an

other five weeks," Siddiqui said.
"Each dining hall doesn't have a
strict menu, because it changes
based on student feedback and
their requests."
Ricker is a peanut-sensitive fa
cility and does not serve foods
which contain peanut products. It is
closed on Friday and Saturday, so
students must go to Lakeside for
their meals.
Finally, 1 was able to eat at home
(Lakeside) but was unimpressed by
the offerings on Saturday. Maybe I
just wasn't all that hungry, so I set
tled on a bowl of good old matzo
ball soup. I know that this is not a
regular menu item, but it was the
only thing I felt like eating. Other
selections included a pasta bar with
the noodles so watered down that it
looked like they hadn't been
drained after they were cooked, a
grill line with hamburgers, veggie
burgers and the like, a tofu dish,
meatloaf, roasted tomatoes, rice
pilaf and chicken wings.
Despite my feelings over Satur
day's dinner, ever since 1 started
eating at Lakeside last fall, I've no
ticed higher-quality food than that
served at some of the other facilities
around campus. The selection at
lunch is outstanding, with hand
tossed salads, a build-your-own
sandwich bar, pizza, tostadas and
paninis. Lakeside also serves fresh
ly-baked cookies once or twice a
week at lunch. I have noticed a lack
of fresh, lean meat such as grilled
chicken breasts at Lakeside. It
would be nice if grilled chicken, like

hamburgers and veggie burgers,
was a daily selection at Lakeside
and at the other dining facilities.
Despite the varieties of each din
ing hall, I would have to agree with
Siddiqui that students' perceptions
of which facilities are "good" and
which are "bad" all depends on
where they live.
"For Ricker students, it's the
best dining hall on campus. Same
thing goes for Branner and all the
other places," Siddiqui said. "The
dining halls foster a community liv
ing spirit, and people really take
charge of their residential areas.
People live in different places and
become attached to them, and
therefore it is the best in their eyes."
Unfortunately, I did not have
time to dine at Wilbur, FloMo,
Manzanita or Branner. A few high
lights of each include:
Wilbur: A la carte options, in
cluding "just in time" (JIT)-made
sushi and Chinese food, and an ex
tensive grab-n-go area.
FloMo: The home of the famous
scoop ice cream.
Manzanita: Also a la carte, Man
zanita features a variety of grab-n
-go options.
Branner: Newly remodeled,
Branner's specialties include a
Euro-saute station and Chicago
style pizza.

Stern residents feel that others are unduly harsh toward their dining
hall, which has a large variety of offerings.

It's easy to complain about the
dining halls around campus;
the food is monotonous, the
quality isn't great or the din
ing hall near your dorm doesn't
serve the type of food you like. On
recent visits to several of the dining
halls, I found that you definitely are
not going to get gourmet restaurant
food at every meal, but for the most
part, the people I spoke with were
quite happy with their dining hall
experiences.
I visited Stern dining hall for din
ner on April 4. To be honest, as a
Twain resident last year, I could not
wait to get away from Stern's food
at the end of spring quarter. It must
have had something to do with
Stern-overload and my readiness to
return home for the summer and to
prepare my own food.
On this particular night, I sam
pled a salad and an eggplant dish
from the vegan bar. Stern is known
around campus for its wide selec
tion and variety of offerings. Daily
specials included: a carving station
with rotisserie chicken, a "South of
the Border" burrito bar and an
Alaskan cod filet sandwich.
The eggplant was just okay — a
bit bitter and not well-cooked. The
selection at the salad bar was fresh
and abundant and even included
blue cheese crumbles to top off sal
ads. According to freshman Adri
enne Chung, the people who com
plain about the food at Stern are

often too harsh.
"The food isn't as bad as people
say it is. I really appreciate how
they have a lot of different types of
soy milk to choose from. The
workers are really nice here and
they play good music during lunch
and dinner."
The large variety at Stern is nice
and is in part made possible by the
enormous size of the serving area. It
