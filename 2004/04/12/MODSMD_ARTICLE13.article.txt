## ASSU should certify election 
### 
Last Thursday, we recommended that the
election for the new ASSU executive slate
he invalidated in the wake of the campaign
controversies ("An election gone wrong,"
April 8). We also stipulated that should the election
he allowed to continue, the results should not he an
nounced to the ASSU or the student body until of
ficials had conducted a thorough investigation and
were absolutely certain that the election process
had been fair. Additionally, we advised that once
the results were released, the ASSU should accept
them — any debate over election validity should
have occurred before the winners were revealed.
Now that the election results have been announced,
therefore, we urge the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate and the Graduate Student Council (GSC) to ac
cept the election and allow the campus to move for
ward from this unfortunate election season.
The ASSU Elections Commission said on Thurs
day night that the results of the election should be
certified, despite questionable rule violations.
These rule violations threaten the legitimacy of the
announced winners — senior Mikey Lee and junior
Dylan Mefford — and Lee and Mefford must await
certification from the Senate and the GSC. Though
the Elections Commission recommended that the
Lee-Mefford slate be approved, some are clamor
ing to overturn the results due to illegal campaign
ing after voting had already begun.
The fact that rules were broken is incontestable.
Also incontestable, however, is the fact that to
drag out the election process further at this point
would hurt the sense of community among stu
dents. To call the election results into question be
fore they were announced would be one thing; it is
quite another to call them into question now that

the winners are known. To insist upon a re-vote at
this time will embitter many and polarize the cam
pus. We can envision this only leading to even
more open hostilities. Though we would hope that
the campaigning during this re-vote process would
proceed without the smear tactics used last week,
such mud-slinging seems inevitable with emotions
running high during a dramatic re-vote process.
Additionally, knowledge of the original election's
results would alter the re-vote and inevitably af
fect the way at least some students would vote.
And more importantly, the decision of whether or
not to carry out a re-vote on the part of student of
ficers should be made indepedent of the voting re
sults, which is now impossible.
Finally, the Elections Commission itself approved
the election last Thursday night and deemed it
worthwhile to proceed with the announcement of re
sults as scheduled at 5 p.m. last Friday. We do not
think it likely that the Senate or GSC will unearth
new evidence that implicates either slate any further;
therefore, the Senate and GSC will not have grounds
with which to contest the results that have not al
ready been cleared by the Elections Commission.
Thus, we urge the Senate and GSC to certify the
2004 ASSU executive elections so that Lee and
Mefford can begin preparing for their duties with
out an antagonizing wait similar to that of the 2000
U.S. presidential election which threw the nation
into turmoil. This will also allow student activists
to move on from the election and to focus their en
ergies on productively assisting the new ASSU ex
ecutives in their new role. Finally, it will permit the
rest of the student body to get past this year's scan
dal and work on rebuilding its trust in the ASSU
elections process.
