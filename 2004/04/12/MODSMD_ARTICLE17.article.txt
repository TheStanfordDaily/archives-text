## Condi needs to get funkified 
### 
Lay down the boogie and
play that funky music.
That's my one piece of ad
vice for National Security
Adviser and former Stanford
Provost Condoleezza Rice. She
needs to follow the example of the
one-hit-wonder Wild Cherry, real
ize that she is out of touch with the
times and get funkified.
Work with me here. Condi is also
a boogie singer playing in a rock 'n'
roll band — a rock 'n roll band that
sings about China and Russia,
rogue nations and other such enti
ties paradigmatic of the Cold War.
Her songs didn't include the Middle
East in their chorus, and some par
ticularly bitter critics might go as far
as to say that rural and poor issues
were similarly absent from her mu
sical vocabulary.
This deficiency has become strik
ingly apparent over the past week.
In anticipation of and subsequent to
her testimony to the commission in
vestigating intelligence failures in
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, every
body and their mom have been
quick to point out that Condi was
never really on point with the issues
that are confronting the Bush ad
ministration today.
As Stanfordites, though, we can't
honestly say we didn't see it coming.
An anecdotal — and 20/20 hind
sight — look at some of Rice's ac
tions at Stanford would presumably
lead her to reach the same conclu
sion as Wild Cherry: "How could 1
be so foolish / to not see I was the
one behind?"
Under Rice, Stanford's scholar
ship in the Middle East or Islam re
mained static, leaving the University
without any professors specializing
in the religion of Islam at the end of
her tenure. So few worked on the
Middle East or other areas of the
Muslim world that they could be
counted on my fingers. The buzz is
that Rice, a Russia specialist, didn't
deem that area of the world pressing.
While Rice was provost, the Uni
versity also closed the Food Re
search Institute, a degree-granting
program that was one of only a

handful in the country to focus on is
sues related to agriculture in the

third world. Any
student doing re
search on these
issues will quickly
learn that Stan
ford-trained
scholars domi
nated the field, so
the implications
of its closing —
which was pro
tested by alumni

and its director at the time — were
non-trivial.
"It essentially means that the
two-thirds of humanity who have
not yet shared in the fruits of pros
perity have lost their voice on cam
pus," said Marcel Fafchamps, an as
sistant professor at the institute, as
reported by the Stanford News Ser
vice in December 1995.
For some former institute facul
ty, the closing represented Rice's
inattention to issues unrelated to
the billiard-ball players of the Cold
War. This past summer, a former as
sistant professor who now works at
a think tank asked me, "How can
someone who doesn't think rural
and third world issues are important
expect to run the foreign policy of
this country?"
So it shouldn't have been shock
ing to anyone on the Farm when, be
fore Rice's Thursday testimony.
The New York Times ran a story
headlined "New to the job. Rice fo
cused on more traditional fears."
The article goes on to cite how
Rice's pre-Sept. 11 policy state
ments failed to mention al-Qaeda
and terrorism; the only mentions of
the Middle East included Iran and
Iraq as rogue states.
"[S|he suffers in that she doesn't
have a really broad background, es
pecially in the history of different
areas," it quotes a former adminis
tration official as saying. "So she's
good on Russia, pretty good on Eu
rope, but it drops off pretty sharply
from there."
In fairness, at least in relation
to Sept. 11, Rice was not the only

person in politics to give seeming
ly little attention to terrorism as
well as broader issues related to
the Muslim world. News reports
have claimed that during the 2000
presidential campaign, neither
George Bush nor A1 Gore made
any references to terrorism, and
The New York Times quotes Stan
ford Institute for International
Studies Director Coit Blacker as
noting that Rice came from a gen
eration of scholars trained on
power politics.
Nevertheless, the legacy of this
mindset can be seen both in the
Bush administration, with its disas
trous policy in the Middle East, and
in the University, which still lags be
hind peer institutions in Islamic and
Middle Eastern studies.
Although institutions like uni
versities are arguably harder to
change than the government, which
turns over every four years, Stan
ford is recognizing some of its defi
ciencies and taking steps to change
them. Last year the University an
nounced the creation of an Islamic
Studies Program, in the works be
fore Sept. 11, and is planning to bol
ster its interdisciplinary work in in
ternational studies in general.
What's unclear is whether the ad
ministration is going to take the
hint, truly realize that the Middle
East and the third world do matter,
and bring people in to focus on them
in responsible and informed ways
(i.e not "Iraq is the devil and if we
invade it, it will fix everything").
Hopefully, Condi will learn the
same lesson Wild Cherry did: realize
that rock n' roll is out, funk is in and
before she knows it she'll be funking
out in every way.
If she does, maybe we can stop
groaning each time we pick up the
paper and instead start singing and
dancing and moving to the groovin'.
