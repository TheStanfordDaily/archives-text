# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## I am not a marine mammal 
### 
After filing a lawsuit
against Chris Holt, my
lawyers negotiated this
column to rectify the
gross accusations Mr. Holt as levied
against me. I am not, and have
never been, a marine animal. De
spite what he said in his trashy, in
accurate column last week, 1 have
never hurt the Mexican tourist in
dustry by lying around a harbor. I
have not "let myself go," and could
never be mistaken fora seal, seal
lion or manatee.
It is obvious Mr. Holt did not do
any research for his column last
week. Or if he did, it was in no way
funny comparing me to a sea lion. I
am a very well-respected musical
artist, having won many musical
awards, and recently having done a
duet with Mary J. Blige. That's right,
I touched Mary J. Blige. 1 am very
sexy. Mr. Holt, have you ever met
Mary J. Blige? I think not.
Furthermore, as my millions of al
bums sales worldwide will tell you,
my voice could never be mistaken for
the harsh bark of a seal. Let's see a
seal sing my classic songs like "Mes
sage in a Bottle" or "Fill Her Up!"
And I do a lot of yoga. It helps me
get a great start on the day and keeps
me looking my gorgeous self. Every
day I look in the mirror, at my beau
tiful face, and sing "If I Ever Lose
Faith in You" to affirm myself. From
what my sources tell me, Mr. Holt,
you don't get up before noon most
days. You do not sing to yourself,
and beautiful women do not throw
themselves at you. So sad. You are
just a Big Lie in this Small World.
I really have to thank my fans for
bringing Mr. Holt's horrendous
column to my attention. They sent
several angry letters to Mr. Holt,
and notified yours truly of his slan
der. So I must thank Debi Bradford
and Helen Bryant for their letters.
Ladies — every little thing you do
is magic.
Ms. Bradford told Mr. Holt,
"Being a fan of Sting I must correct
you on one point — he isn't fat."
True, I'm sexy. "Never could he be
mistaken fora tubby marine mam
mal. Trust me. I must say that he's
in the fittest condition ever." So
true. "Sting is gorgeous." Ms. Brad
ford, you flatter me. But it's true.
And that's a very nice picture of me

and Mary J. Blige that you sent to
Mr. Holt. "You know ... all that
yoga and tantric sex stuff." See?
Proof I do yoga. As for the tantric
stuff, I don't know about that, Ms.
Bradford ... unless, are you single?

Ms. Helen Bryant, from the IJK,
similarly defended me against Mr.
Holt's attempts at humor. She wrote
in The Daily last Tuesday, "I don't
know who you are, Chris Holt, and I
really don't wish to. How can you be
so rude about Sting, when it's obvi
ous you haven't seen him for years?
How could someone who is 'obese'
according to you be able to do about
one and a half hours of yoga daily?
Don't project your insecurities on
others. I bet you won't look so good
at 53, especially the way your coun
try is going."
Isn't that the truth? Again, see
how she points out I do yoga! The
entire world does yoga these days,
why doesn't Mr. Holt? Without the
handsome Sting in the United States
to spread joy and love, there is a dis
tinct lack of attractive 53-year-olds.

I'm sure Ms. Bradford is disappoint
ed about that (wink). Mr. Holt will
undoubtedly look like crap when he
hits 53, but his country will be in any
even worse state. After all, bad
satirists like him (who obviously do

no research before printing their
thoughts) are responsible for the
current sad state of America. With
out Sting there to enchant the place,
how can it survive?
So Mr. Holt, here is my promise
to you: Every breath you take,
every move you make, will be clos
er to your last. I am coming after
you. My vengeance will be as beau
tiful and deadly as a Desert Rose.
Tomorrow is a Brand New Day, Mr.
Holt. Start running, because it may
be your last.

Sting did not write this column. He is
in no way affiliated with The Stan
ford Daily, Chris Holt or Stanford
University. This is a joke. But Chris
did receive several angry letters from
Sting fans at cholt@stanford.edu. He
thanks them for being good sports.

Ms. Helen Bryant, from the IJK,
similarly defended me against Mr.
Holt's attempts at humor. She wrote
in The Daily last Tuesday, "I don't
know who you are, Chris Holt, and I
really don't wish to. How can you be
so rude about Sting, when it's obvi
ous you haven't seen him for years?
How could someone who is 'obese'
according to you be able to do about
one and a half hours of yoga daily?
Don't project your insecurities on
others. I bet you won't look so good
at 53, especially the way your coun
try is going."
Isn't that the truth? Again, see
how she points out I do yoga! The
entire world does yoga these days,
why doesn't Mr. Holt? Without the
handsome Sting in the United States
to spread joy and love, there is a dis
tinct lack of attractive 53-year-olds.

I'm sure Ms. Bradford is disappoint
ed about that (wink). Mr. Holt will
undoubtedly look like crap when he
hits 53, but his country will be in any
even worse state. After all, bad
satirists like him (who obviously do

no research before printing their
thoughts) are responsible for the
current sad state of America. With
out Sting there to enchant the place,
how can it survive?
So Mr. Holt, here is my promise
to you: Every breath you take,
every move you make, will be clos
er to your last. I am coming after
you. My vengeance will be as beau
tiful and deadly as a Desert Rose.
Tomorrow is a Brand New Day, Mr.
Holt. Start running, because it may
be your last.

Sting did not write this column. He is
in no way affiliated with The Stan
ford Daily, Chris Holt or Stanford
University. This is a joke. But Chris
did receive several angry letters from
Sting fans at cholt@stanford.edu. He
thanks them for being good sports.

After filing a lawsuit
against Chris Holt, my
lawyers negotiated this
column to rectify the
gross accusations Mr. Holt as levied
against me. I am not, and have
never been, a marine animal. De
spite what he said in his trashy, in
accurate column last week, 1 have
never hurt the Mexican tourist in
dustry by lying around a harbor. I
have not "let myself go," and could
never be mistaken fora seal, seal
lion or manatee.
It is obvious Mr. Holt did not do
any research for his column last
week. Or if he did, it was in no way
funny comparing me to a sea lion. I
am a very well-respected musical
artist, having won many musical
awards, and recently having done a
duet with Mary J. Blige. That's right,
I touched Mary J. Blige. 1 am very
sexy. Mr. Holt, have you ever met
Mary J. Blige? I think not.
Furthermore, as my millions of al
bums sales worldwide will tell you,
my voice could never be mistaken for
the harsh bark of a seal. Let's see a
seal sing my classic songs like "Mes
sage in a Bottle" or "Fill Her Up!"
And I do a lot of yoga. It helps me
get a great start on the day and keeps
me looking my gorgeous self. Every
day I look in the mirror, at my beau
tiful face, and sing "If I Ever Lose
Faith in You" to affirm myself. From
what my sources tell me, Mr. Holt,
you don't get up before noon most
days. You do not sing to yourself,
and beautiful women do not throw
themselves at you. So sad. You are
just a Big Lie in this Small World.
I really have to thank my fans for
bringing Mr. Holt's horrendous
column to my attention. They sent
several angry letters to Mr. Holt,
and notified yours truly of his slan
der. So I must thank Debi Bradford
and Helen Bryant for their letters.
Ladies — every little thing you do
is magic.
Ms. Bradford told Mr. Holt,
"Being a fan of Sting I must correct
you on one point — he isn't fat."
True, I'm sexy. "Never could he be
mistaken fora tubby marine mam
mal. Trust me. I must say that he's
in the fittest condition ever." So
true. "Sting is gorgeous." Ms. Brad
ford, you flatter me. But it's true.
And that's a very nice picture of me

and Mary J. Blige that you sent to
Mr. Holt. "You know ... all that
yoga and tantric sex stuff." See?
Proof I do yoga. As for the tantric
stuff, I don't know about that, Ms.
Bradford ... unless, are you single?
