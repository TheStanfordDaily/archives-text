## A 						new elections code: a recommendation for the ASSU 
### KAI STINCHCOMBE 
The recent ASSU election was,
frankly, nauseating. Campaigning was
so intense as to be counterproductive:
Amid contests over who had more, big
ger and better flyers up in White Plaza,
people lost sight of the real issues. With
ASSU Undergraduate Senate slogans
like "advocating for your issues, not all
those other people's issues," "your sav
ior in the senate," and "Husen, not
Hussein," the candidates might as well
have played foosball or Hungry Hun
gry Hippos, or counted their friends on
thefacebook.com, to decide the elec
tion. This was student government at
its most crass.
Meanwhile, the rights of ordinary
students were systematically violated.
The campus was trashed, posters were

everywhere and we all got more e-mail
than we would have liked. None of this
bombardment was substantive; we
were just urged over and over again to
vote for people.
Nobody thinks that hundreds of
identical flyers in White Plaza indicate
that a candidate or slate will perform
well in student government. The peo
ple and candidates that I've talked to
have all said the same thing — they do
it because they have to, and they have
to because everybody else is doing it.
Campaigns are expensive, stressful
and acrimonious — and unnecessarily
so. The solution is collective restraint
in the form of a tough new elections
code that will encourage substantive
debate, protect the rights of ordinary
students and hold candidates back
from the existing race to the bottom.

Here is my proposal:
1) Campaign shall refer to any effort
on behalf of an executive slate, Senate
or GSC candidate, initiative, special
fees group or any other thing present on
the ASSU ballot. It does not include
collecting signatures for special-fees
groups not yet on the ballot.
2) No person may affix any thing to
any other tiling as a part of a campaign.
This explicitly includes banners, flyers
or chalk in public places on campus. Ex
ception: An individual student may
place up to three 8.5"xll" flyers, print
ed in black ink on white paper, on the
door of their own dorm room.
3) From two days before the start of
campaigning to the day after voting
ends, at noon or at another time of their
choosing, each ASSU executive slate or
a member thereof will meet together

for no less than half an hour to talk
about campaign and election issues.
4) Any endorsement decision of a
candidate or ballot issue by a group
will be made by a transparent process.
The group shall offer each slate or can
didate an equal chance to present their
views. When endorsement votes are
taken, the group shall record and give
to the elections commission and each
candidate or slate in question a list of
who was eligible and present to vote
on the endorsement, what the proce
dure for endorsement is (e.g. simple
majority), and how many votes each
candidate received.
5) Nobody shall send any e-mail
whose recipients are not evident (i.e. if
it is to an e-mail list the name of that list
shall be clear; if it is to a group of indi
viduals, those individuals e-mail ad

dresses shall be listed).
6) No special-fees group shall use
any resources provided by the ASSU
through the special-fees system for
their special-fees campaigns or for
other campaigns. This explicitly in
cludes announcing special-fees cam
paigns at events funded in part by spe
cial fees. Exception: Newspapers, radio
stations and other campus media out
lets may use media resources paid for
by special fees to host equal-opportuni
ty fora to cover elections issues.
7) Only candidates or two designat
ed student group officers may wear
campaign apparel.
8) Each campaign group may sub
mit a Web site or statement URL to the
Elections Commission, which will
make them publicly available and will
include them on the ballot.

9) Each campaign shall give the
Elections Commission a list of cam
paign volunteers. The elections com
mission will inform these volunteers of
all of these rules.
10) Campaigns and volunteers are
both individually and collectively re
sponsible for violations of these rules.
11) Campaigns shall track all cam
paign expenses and how they were cov
ered, and shall submit a financial disclo
sure to the Elections Commission. The
Elections Commission shall make this
publicly available.
12) The Elections Commission shall
maintain a current and publicly avail
able list of all violations of these rules.
