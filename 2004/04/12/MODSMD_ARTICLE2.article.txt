### DANDAN WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"On Common Ground 2004," the annual event sponsored by The
Forum for American / Chinese Exchange at Stanford (FACES), be
gins today, bringing 16 students from China and 16 from the United
States to campus fora weeklong conference on U.S.-China relations.
In the next five days, the student delegates will work on different di
mensions of U.S.-China interactions involving economics, culture and
foreign policy. A wide range of panel discussions will be led by promi
nent scholars and government officials.
Jessica Chen Weiss, a Stanford student, initiated this student organi
zation in the fall of 2001 after a U.S. plane collided with a Chinese fighter
jet. She hoped to increase mutual understanding between the two nations.
In its second year, the conference is designed to allow students from
both sides to strengthen their ability to sort fact from fiction and to see
the world through one another's eyes.
"Our purpose is to bring together Chinese and American students
so that they can learn U.S.-China relations from experts and each
other," said FACES president Zachary Levine, a junior. "This kind of
grassroots diplomacy is very important because people need to have
understanding at all levels to form a robust and stable relationship."
Levine also noted that although there are only a small number of
participants, the event could still significantly contribute to U.S.-
China relations, as these young students might be future leaders in
both the United States and China in the future.
At the end of the conference, participants will participate in a sim
ulated negotiation in which U.S. students will play the role of Chinese
officials and Chinese students will play U.S. policymakers.
Over the ensuing four months, the same participants will work in
cross-cultural teams of four to research a particular subject of interest
before reconvening at Peking University in late August to present

their findings and recommendations.
"It is a fabulous program that brings together truly outstanding
Chinese and American young people who are committed to building
the understanding between the two countries," said John Holder,
president of the National Committee on U.S.-China relations.
Speaking at the conference's welcome banquet, Holden described
his own experience with China and emphasized the importance of in
ternational understanding and exchanging dialogue.
Other prominent speakers include Ambassador Chas Freeman,
chair of the United States-China Policy Council and president of the
Middle East Policy Council; as well as Robert A. Kapp, president of
the U.S.-China Business Council.
In addition, attendees hail from universities across the nation in
cluding Harvard University, Cornell University and the University of
Pennsylvania. The Chinese students present are mainly from Peking,
Fudan and Tsinghua Universities. 4
The 12 attending students were selected from hundreds of applicants.
"This is a good opportunity to broaden your vision by exposing
yourself to many talented people," said Sun Zheng, a first-year gradu
ate student in English language and literature from Peking University.
"The students here impress me as very motivated. I am looking for
ward to the intellectual exposure in the coming week."
Daniel Englander, a junior in Reed College's interdisciplinary De
partment of International and Comparative Policy Studies, said this
conference was a great chance for him to get a different perspective on
various issues and to meet Chinese people.
FACES is run entirely by Stanford students, most of whom are in
terested in U.S.-China relations. For this-conference, the organizers
raised $112,000.
Levine noted that FACES is the only program in the country in
which students plan a conference for their peers focused on U.S.-
China relations, although Harvard is initiating a similar program.
