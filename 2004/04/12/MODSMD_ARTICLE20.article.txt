Readers respond to column on
reparations for Mormons
I am a member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I
just wanted to respond quickly to
Thursdays column written by Kathryn
Wallace ("Reparations to Mormons,"
April 8). I feel that her article greatly
underestimated the value of this partic
ular (or any) apology, and undermined
the progress that was made by the re
cent letter of regret issued by the State
of Illinois. Gordon B. Hinckley, the
president of our church, stated just after
this apology was released by Illinois
state officials, "We are pleased to note
that... the Illinois House of Represen
tatives unanimously passed a resolu
tion of regret for the forced expulsion of
our people from Nauvoo, 111. in 1846.
This magnanimous gesture may be cou
pled with action taken by then-gover
nor Christopher S. Bond of Missouri,
who in 1976 revoked the cruel and un
constitutional extermination order is
sued against our people by Governor
Lilburn W. Boggs in 1838. These and
other developments represent a most
significant change of attitude toward
the Latter-day Saints."
He. as well as most other LDS lead

ers and members, see this acknowl
edgement of error as a step in the right
direction — as a recognition not only of
the humanity of members of the LDS
church, but a recognition of the good
works and integrity of this people. Ulti
mately, this is all that members of the
church were looking for in Nauvoo: to
be seen and represented as the kind,
stalwart, God-loving people that they
were and are. 1 think that the letter of
apology by Illinois was not only pro
ductive, but necessary. While it may not
have changed the events of the past, it
most certainly has the potential to
change the events of the future, and
that is all one can hope for.

Kathryn Wallace's column ("Repa
rations to Mormons," April 8) was rid
dled with half-truths representing the
Mormon version of their history, which
leaves out some important facts. For ex
ample, the Mormon Church in Nau
voo, 111. was not out of favor only be
cause they had a voting block and de
stroyed the anti-Mormon newspaper.
There were also well-documented,
church-sanctioned raids, and some

times murders committed against their
neighbors. The anger of the communi
ty was reasonable. As for Mormon
founder Joseph Smith beingin jail with
out a trial, most people arrested are put
in jail. The trial comes later.
I agree with Wallace that repara
tions are not appropriate for descen
dants of the Mormon community driv
en out of Illinois. If they were, repara
tions would also be owed to descen
dants of the over 100 wagon train mem
bers massacred by Mormons at Moun
tain Meadows, Utah. This action, it is
now clear from the publication of two
recent books, was committed with the
knowledge of the leadership in Salt
Lake City. Such reparations would be
difficult to pay since so many of the chil
dren were also murdered. However,
Wallace should familiarize herself with
all the facts before presuming to ex
press opinions in the future.

Rodriguez 7 actions in ASSU election
were merely an exercise in free speech
Thursday morning I got out of bed
and watched National Security Advisor

Condoleezza Rice testify before a spe
cial Sept. 11 committee. Then I flipped
through about ten different news pro
grams of people analyzing her testimo
ny. Some were defending her, others
negatively scrutinized every word and
some actually tried to deliver an unbi
ased message.
However, it is each news anchor's
right to express his opinion and support
a candidate. This is what brings me to
the real purpose of this letter. Nick Ro
driguez was perfectly justified in send
ing out the mass e-mail regardless of
whom it might have influenced (inten
tionally or not), whom it might have ag
gravated or whom it might have
smeared. My only displeasure at this e
mail was that he did not fully stand be
hind a candidate and cry foul.
Everyone is entitled to his opinion.
Spam is not illegal (yet). Rodriguez
may have unfairly used access to a cer
tain e-mail list, but this is certainly no
crime. Rodriguez is in no way involved
in the election and is therefore entitled
to his "freedom of speech." I believe
the only crime of which he is guilty is
being heard. Yes, you read that correct
ly. Everyone is entitled to speak, but for
some reason we feel it necessary to
make it illegal for them to be heard. I

find this to be much more of a pressing
issue than his mass e-mail.
The Daily article ("Campus rocked
by election misconduct," April 8) stated
that "disciplinary action may be taken"
against Rodriguez for this heinous and
egregious crime. I would personally en
courage Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe to refrain from penalizing
Rodriguez for his actions.
Feel free to disagree with me, it is
your right, and I encourage you to do so.

Junior Class president clarifies position
on Lee / Mefford endorsement
The Daily's front-page article
Thursday ("Campus rocked by election
misconduct." April 8) chronicled the
rampant elections violations of this
year's ASSU elections. Along with
those accused of misconduct, the Junior
Class presidents were implicated. I am
writing this letter because I am one of
the four Junior Class presidents, and I
resent that the blame for the e-mail to
the Junior Class list has fallen on my
shoulders when I had nothing to do

with it. Not only was I unaware of the e
mail being sent, but I specifically op
posed the endorsement of either slate
when two of the other presidents men
tioned declaring our support for Lee /
Mefford in an article for The Daily.
In an e-mail to the other three pres
idents 1 wrote, "I hate to be the one to
rain on the parade, but I kinda don't
think it's fair if we endorse / support
one slate over the other. I am friends
with Ajani, and I wouldn't want any
thing said on our behalf that would
lessen his chance or the other slate's
chances of winning. If one of us could
come up with a response that fairly
evaluates each slate's abilities without
favoring one over the other, then I
think that would be best. I'm sure that
each slate can run on the competence of
their own merits and qualifications."
Basically, I just wanted to make clear
that two of the Junior Class presidents
were in favor of endorsing Lee / Mef
ford and composed and sent the e-mail
to the Junior Class, and the other two of
us were not. This should be clarified so
that our entire slate is not blamed for the
careless mistake of only two members.

ing out the mass e-mail regardless of
whom it might have influenced (inten
tionally or not), whom it might have ag
gravated or whom it might have
smeared. My only displeasure at this e
mail was that he did not fully stand be
hind a candidate and cry foul.
Everyone is entitled to his opinion.
Spam is not illegal (yet). Rodriguez
may have unfairly used access to a cer
tain e-mail list, but this is certainly no
crime. Rodriguez is in no way involved
in the election and is therefore entitled
to his "freedom of speech." I believe
the only crime of which he is guilty is
being heard. Yes, you read that correct
ly. Everyone is entitled to speak, but for
some reason we feel it necessary to
make it illegal for them to be heard. I

find this to be much more of a pressing
issue than his mass e-mail.
The Daily article ("Campus rocked
by election misconduct," April 8) stated
that "disciplinary action may be taken"
against Rodriguez for this heinous and
egregious crime. I would personally en
courage Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe to refrain from penalizing
Rodriguez for his actions.
Feel free to disagree with me, it is
your right, and I encourage you to do so.

Junior Class president clarifies position
on Lee / Mefford endorsement
The Daily's front-page article
Thursday ("Campus rocked by election
misconduct." April 8) chronicled the
rampant elections violations of this
year's ASSU elections. Along with
those accused of misconduct, the Junior
Class presidents were implicated. I am
writing this letter because I am one of
the four Junior Class presidents, and I
resent that the blame for the e-mail to
the Junior Class list has fallen on my
shoulders when I had nothing to do

with it. Not only was I unaware of the e
mail being sent, but I specifically op
posed the endorsement of either slate
when two of the other presidents men
tioned declaring our support for Lee /
Mefford in an article for The Daily.
In an e-mail to the other three pres
idents 1 wrote, "I hate to be the one to
rain on the parade, but I kinda don't
think it's fair if we endorse / support
one slate over the other. I am friends
with Ajani, and I wouldn't want any
thing said on our behalf that would
lessen his chance or the other slate's
chances of winning. If one of us could
come up with a response that fairly
evaluates each slate's abilities without
favoring one over the other, then I
think that would be best. I'm sure that
each slate can run on the competence of
their own merits and qualifications."
Basically, I just wanted to make clear
that two of the Junior Class presidents
were in favor of endorsing Lee / Mef
ford and composed and sent the e-mail
to the Junior Class, and the other two of
us were not. This should be clarified so
that our entire slate is not blamed for the
careless mistake of only two members.

Readers respond to column on
reparations for Mormons
I am a member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I
just wanted to respond quickly to
Thursdays column written by Kathryn
Wallace ("Reparations to Mormons,"
April 8). I feel that her article greatly
underestimated the value of this partic
ular (or any) apology, and undermined
the progress that was made by the re
cent letter of regret issued by the State
of Illinois. Gordon B. Hinckley, the
president of our church, stated just after
this apology was released by Illinois
state officials, "We are pleased to note
that... the Illinois House of Represen
tatives unanimously passed a resolu
tion of regret for the forced expulsion of
our people from Nauvoo, 111. in 1846.
This magnanimous gesture may be cou
pled with action taken by then-gover
nor Christopher S. Bond of Missouri,
who in 1976 revoked the cruel and un
constitutional extermination order is
sued against our people by Governor
Lilburn W. Boggs in 1838. These and
other developments represent a most
significant change of attitude toward
the Latter-day Saints."
He. as well as most other LDS lead

ers and members, see this acknowl
edgement of error as a step in the right
direction — as a recognition not only of
the humanity of members of the LDS
church, but a recognition of the good
works and integrity of this people. Ulti
mately, this is all that members of the
church were looking for in Nauvoo: to
be seen and represented as the kind,
stalwart, God-loving people that they
were and are. 1 think that the letter of
apology by Illinois was not only pro
ductive, but necessary. While it may not
have changed the events of the past, it
most certainly has the potential to
change the events of the future, and
that is all one can hope for.

Kathryn Wallace's column ("Repa
rations to Mormons," April 8) was rid
dled with half-truths representing the
Mormon version of their history, which
leaves out some important facts. For ex
ample, the Mormon Church in Nau
voo, 111. was not out of favor only be
cause they had a voting block and de
stroyed the anti-Mormon newspaper.
There were also well-documented,
church-sanctioned raids, and some

times murders committed against their
neighbors. The anger of the communi
ty was reasonable. As for Mormon
founder Joseph Smith beingin jail with
out a trial, most people arrested are put
in jail. The trial comes later.
I agree with Wallace that repara
tions are not appropriate for descen
dants of the Mormon community driv
en out of Illinois. If they were, repara
tions would also be owed to descen
dants of the over 100 wagon train mem
bers massacred by Mormons at Moun
tain Meadows, Utah. This action, it is
now clear from the publication of two
recent books, was committed with the
knowledge of the leadership in Salt
Lake City. Such reparations would be
difficult to pay since so many of the chil
dren were also murdered. However,
Wallace should familiarize herself with
all the facts before presuming to ex
press opinions in the future.

Rodriguez 7 actions in ASSU election
were merely an exercise in free speech
Thursday morning I got out of bed
and watched National Security Advisor

Condoleezza Rice testify before a spe

through about ten different news pro
