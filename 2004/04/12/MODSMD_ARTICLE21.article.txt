## A's ought to be Giant-killers; what gives? 
### 
Baseball season is entering its second week, and
guess who's in first place in the American
League West? None other than your home
town Oakland A's while my beloved Detroit
Tigers have the best record in the league.
I could write for days about Rondell White and the
new-look Tigers, but there are approximately three
people on campus who are A) actually from the Mid
west and B) like the Tigers. I can't say I've met all three,
but I know they're out there.
But the Tigers are 2,CKK) miles away; I want to talk
about local baseball, the games that Stanford students
can and should be going to see occasionally because,
well, it's good baseball.
The Bay Area has not one but two teams that play ex
cellent baseball, year in and year out. Yet one team per
petually dominates the market.
The thing that I dislike most about Bay Area baseball
is how Giant-centric it is. The Athletics are often the bet
ter team, and it seems like no one cares. I've forever sworn
off the Caltrain because of the overpopulation of corpo
rate dads in white fitted Giants caps that clearly get worn
about twice a year and soccer moms wearing mesh visors.

Well, that and the fact that I could
drive to SF and back in less time than
it takes the train to get there.
The last time I rode the Caltrain
was May 2nd of last year. My friend
Bob was visiting from back home, so
I thought it would be fun to take him
to a Giants game without paying 20
bucks for parking (1 know, cost-con
sciousness and the Giants don't mix .
.. it was definitely my bad). We de
cided it would be fun to wear all red

in honor of the visiting Cincinnati club, since neither of
us like the Giants.
So after leaving my place in Mirriclees at 5 p.m. (in the
time it took you to read this, another couch has been
thrown off the balcony and 17 new e-mails have been
sent to the dorm list asking where the vacuum is), we ar
rive at the park around 6:30 p.m. Calculated average
train speed: 20 mph. I can ride a bicycle that fast!
Once at the park, we pay 20-something dollars for ex
treme upper-deck seats and are forced to choose between
garlie fries for about seven bucks or any other concessions
item for, well, about seven bucks. Thank goodness I was
not 21 at the time, because 7.75 is not a fun multiplier.
To top this all off. it had been raining fora while —
could this trip have been any more of a waste of time to this
point? — so the game started late. Thanks, San Francisco.
The game was definitely the highlight of the evening
(Well, that and discovering that root beer and Bacardi
Limon are a great mix — seriously, try it. You'll thank
me later.). Danny Graves threw seven shutout innings
and Ryan Freel dropped a suicide squeeze that really
pissed off all the Giants fans.
St) we chant, yell and clap our way through a 5-1 Reds
win, and as a result we got to take some disappointingly
weak trash-talk from some actively-troubled youths
wearing snow hats. The adults in attendance didn't even
bother to say anything to us. We execute this entire ex
ercise of making a demonstration against the Giants and
casual-fan culture, and no one cared but the 17-year-old
with a link of chain hanging from his neck.JNCOs hang
ing off his ass and a white poly-blend Giants snow hat on
his head? Come on, SF, you need to raise up.
Contrast this to the any number of the games to which
I've gone in Oakland. First off, even for the playoffs, 1
could buy a walkup ticket. Yeah, yeah, sellout crowds are
nice, but it's also nice to actually be able to attend the
games to which you want to go. It's also nice to pay one
fifth as much as I would pay in SF and get a better seat for
it. And, lastly, it's worth noting that I could drive to Oak
land and back in the time it would take me to ride the Cal
train to San Francisco.
Oakland fans, even though they are outnumbered in
the attendance figures, know how to watch baseball.
The A's don't sell out, they don't bring in the corporate
dad / soccer mom crowd, but they bring the intensity,
every game. The banners in the outfield, the sometimes
frightening antagonism toward the other team and its
fans — what an atmosphere.
The Giants have a lot of knowledgeable fans — I
would know, because I must have heard seven differnet
people explain what the suicide squeeze is to their kid or
significant other during the aforementioned Reds game.
Now, I won't hold the uninformed see-and-be-seen
crowd against the real fans, but the atmosphere is still so
reserved. Even when Bonds hits one out and it gets loud
and excited, it does so in a controlled, safe manner.
Whereas Oakland, well, it just has an edge to it. It's sim
ply more vibrant.
Which is why I find it so curious that most of the Bay
Area — particularly, it seems, the more casual segment of
the fan population — is so firmly behind the Giants. Oak
land has fielded multiple World Series winners out of the
East Bay, has always been spectacularly colorful on and off
the field, from Charlie O. Finley and his mule to the Bash
Brothers to Billy Beane, and yet the patrician Giants just
soak up the Bay Area fans like a sponge.
I'm not saying the Giants aren't a good franchise and
a fun team to watch in a very nice (if very pricy) ballpark.
But I am saying that there's no reason they should be this
much more popular than the Athletics.
I guess there are some unanswerable questions in life
— why does anyone like h<xkey? — but this one contin
ues to puzzle me. The A's are cheaper, more colorful,
more accessible and often better (particularly this year).
If you're a Giants fan, that's fine, I'm not trying to
convert you. But if you're just a person who wants to go
see a fun baseball game or, like me. you're an out-of
towner just looking to watch the best available baseball
in the best all-around atmosphere, grab a mere 20 bucks
for parking and a ticket, cross the San Mateo bridge and
go catch an A's game. You won't regret it.

— why does anyone like h<xkey? — but this one contin
ues to puzzle me. The A's are cheaper, more colorful,
more accessible and often better (particularly this year).
If you're a Giants fan, that's fine, I'm not trying to
convert you. But if you're just a person who wants to go
see a fun baseball game or, like me. you're an out-of
towner just looking to watch the best available baseball
in the best all-around atmosphere, grab a mere 20 bucks
for parking and a ticket, cross the San Mateo bridge and
go catch an A's game. You won't regret it.

Baseball season is entering its second week, and
guess who's in first place in the American
League West? None other than your home
town Oakland A's while my beloved Detroit
Tigers have the best record in the league.
I could write for days about Rondell White and the
new-look Tigers, but there are approximately three
people on campus who are A) actually from the Mid
west and B) like the Tigers. I can't say I've met all three,
but I know they're out there.
But the Tigers are 2,CKK) miles away; I want to talk
about local baseball, the games that Stanford students
can and should be going to see occasionally because,
well, it's good baseball.
The Bay Area has not one but two teams that play ex
cellent baseball, year in and year out. Yet one team per
petually dominates the market.
The thing that I dislike most about Bay Area baseball
is how Giant-centric it is. The Athletics are often the bet
ter team, and it seems like no one cares. I've forever sworn
off the Caltrain because of the overpopulation of corpo
rate dads in white fitted Giants caps that clearly get worn
about twice a year and soccer moms wearing mesh visors.

Well, that and the fact that I could
drive to SF and back in less time than
it takes the train to get there.
The last time I rode the Caltrain
was May 2nd of last year. My friend
Bob was visiting from back home, so
I thought it would be fun to take him
to a Giants game without paying 20
bucks for parking (1 know, cost-con
sciousness and the Giants don't mix .
.. it was definitely my bad). We de
cided it would be fun to wear all red

in honor of the visiting Cincinnati club, since neither of
us like the Giants.
So after leaving my place in Mirriclees at 5 p.m. (in the
time it took you to read this, another couch has been
thrown off the balcony and 17 new e-mails have been
sent to the dorm list asking where the vacuum is), we ar
rive at the park around 6:30 p.m. Calculated average
train speed: 20 mph. I can ride a bicycle that fast!
Once at the park, we pay 20-something dollars for ex
treme upper-deck seats and are forced to choose between
garlie fries for about seven bucks or any other concessions
item for, well, about seven bucks. Thank goodness I was
not 21 at the time, because 7.75 is not a fun multiplier.
To top this all off. it had been raining fora while —
could this trip have been any more of a waste of time to this
point? — so the game started late. Thanks, San Francisco.
The game was definitely the highlight of the evening
(Well, that and discovering that root beer and Bacardi
Limon are a great mix — seriously, try it. You'll thank
me later.). Danny Graves threw seven shutout innings
and Ryan Freel dropped a suicide squeeze that really
pissed off all the Giants fans.
St) we chant, yell and clap our way through a 5-1 Reds
win, and as a result we got to take some disappointingly
weak trash-talk from some actively-troubled youths
wearing snow hats. The adults in attendance didn't even
bother to say anything to us. We execute this entire ex
ercise of making a demonstration against the Giants and
casual-fan culture, and no one cared but the 17-year-old
with a link of chain hanging from his neck.JNCOs hang
ing off his ass and a white poly-blend Giants snow hat on
his head? Come on, SF, you need to raise up.
Contrast this to the any number of the games to which
I've gone in Oakland. First off, even for the playoffs, 1
could buy a walkup ticket. Yeah, yeah, sellout crowds are
nice, but it's also nice to actually be able to attend the
games to which you want to go. It's also nice to pay one
fifth as much as I would pay in SF and get a better seat for
it. And, lastly, it's worth noting that I could drive to Oak
land and back in the time it would take me to ride the Cal
train to San Francisco.
Oakland fans, even though they are outnumbered in
the attendance figures, know how to watch baseball.
The A's don't sell out, they don't bring in the corporate
dad / soccer mom crowd, but they bring the intensity,
every game. The banners in the outfield, the sometimes
frightening antagonism toward the other team and its
fans — what an atmosphere.
The Giants have a lot of knowledgeable fans — I
would know, because I must have heard seven differnet
people explain what the suicide squeeze is to their kid or
significant other during the aforementioned Reds game.
Now, I won't hold the uninformed see-and-be-seen
crowd against the real fans, but the atmosphere is still so
reserved. Even when Bonds hits one out and it gets loud
and excited, it does so in a controlled, safe manner.
Whereas Oakland, well, it just has an edge to it. It's sim
ply more vibrant.
Which is why I find it so curious that most of the Bay
Area — particularly, it seems, the more casual segment of
the fan population — is so firmly behind the Giants. Oak
land has fielded multiple World Series winners out of the
East Bay, has always been spectacularly colorful on and off
the field, from Charlie O. Finley and his mule to the Bash
Brothers to Billy Beane, and yet the patrician Giants just
soak up the Bay Area fans like a sponge.
I'm not saying the Giants aren't a good franchise and
a fun team to watch in a very nice (if very pricy) ballpark.
But I am saying that there's no reason they should be this
much more popular than the Athletics.
