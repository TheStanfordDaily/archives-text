# Relievers push Stanford past OSU
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess can thank
the core of his relief corps — David O'Hagan, Jeff
Stimpson and Matt Manship — for making this past
weekend's series at Oregon State a success.
The three Cardinal starters only lasted a com
bined 13 1/3 innings in Corvallis, and yet the Cardi
nal still took two of three from the Beavers — a tes
tament to the extraordinary relief pitching the Car
dinal received.
"We have a really deep staff and that's going to
help us in the long run," Manship said. "It takes some
of the pressure off the starters. I'm sure they like
knowing they have consistent guys behind them."
Stanford blasted Oregon State on Saturday, 16-4,
lost a close game on Friday, 5-4, and came from be
hind to win on Thursday, 11 -8.
Coupled with series losses over the weekend by
Washington and Arizona, Stanford (25-5,4-2 Pacif
ic* 10 Conference) took sole possession of first
place in league.
The Cardinal is finding all sorts of ways to win
these days, and its latest efforts relied heavily on a
pair of relievers who've been consistent all year
and on another reliever who might just be finding
his groove.
O'Hagan has been entrenched in the closer's role
since the College World Series last year, and has
seemingly relished the opportunity thus far this sea
son. He's second in the Pac-10 in saves with four and
has allowed only 10 runs in 34 2 / 3 innings.
O'Hagan. a senior, pitched a scoreless eighth
Thursday, allowing Stanford to score seven runs in
the last two innings and finish off a come-from-be
hind victory. He gave up a meaningless lead-off
home-run in the ninth but subsequently retired all
three batters to get his fourth win of the year.
A bigger surprise for the Cardinal staff this year
has been the pitching of freshman right-hander
Stimpson, who didn't allow a run in his first 12 1/3
innings before giving up a game-winning homer two
weekends ago.
It didn't seem like his confidence was at all shak
en against the Beavers, though, as he pitched a cru
cial 11/3 innings Thursday before giving way to
O'Hagan. Stimpson also threw 2 2/3 scoreless in
nings Saturday, striking out six and bailing out
starter Jeff Gilmore while the Stanford offense put
up crooked numbers on the scoreboard.
For his efforts, Stimpson picked up his first colle
giate win.
"I didn't have a very good fall and it didn't look
like I was going to get a lot of chances," Stimpson
said. "But I've been on a big roll since we got back to
school in January."
Stimpson should only continue to get better. He's

refined his fastball-changeup combination and has
been working on a curveball to add to his repertoire.
He said he used the curveball more extensively than
usual Saturday and used it to strike out two batters.
"I'm just trying to develop a pitch to put away hit
ters," Stimpson said.
As important as O'Hagan and Stimpson were to
the Cardinal's success this weekend, the perfor
mance of Manship on Friday was probably the most
important thrown by any Stanford pitcher the en
tire weekend.
The 6-foot-4 Manship, a freshman All-American
closer last season, was arguably the linchpin in the
Stanford bullpen in 2003. He was second in the con
ference in saves (nine) and posted a respectable 3.98
ERA while striking out 50 batters in 63 1 / 3 innings.
This year has been a completely different story.
Slated to be a starting pitcher, Manship got only
one ineffective start early in the season against Cal
State-Fullerton and was moved to the bullpen,
from where he'd only thrown 10 innings total com-

ing into the weekend. Mar
quess had said earlier in
the week that Manship had
been plainly ineffective
and needed a way to regain
his confidence.
So with Blake Holler
struggling and Stanford trail
ing 4-1 in the fourth Friday,
Marquess inserted Manship.
The sophomore responded
with 4 1/3 scoreless innings,
giving up only two hits while
striking out four.
"It was as good as he's
looked all season," Mar
quess said. "That was the
highlight of our pitching
staff this weekend."
Manship's relief efforts
were nearly enough to save
the game for Stanford, as
second baseman Jed Lowrie
pulled the Cardinal within
one with a two-run home
run in the eighth. But first
baseman John Mayberry Jr.
struck out with the tying run
on third in the ninth.
Nonetheless, Manship's
strong outing was a wel
come sign fora pitching
staff that hopes to get deep
er as the season progresses.
Manship said he was able
to locate his fastball well and
got most of his outs on inside

fastballs down in the strike zone. He also said he
threw only a few off-speed pitches — something
Manship hopes to refine in the coming weeks.
"More than anything, it just takes logging in
nings," he said.
Saturday, Stanford really didn't need all that
much relief pitching as the Cardinal jumped out to a
10-3 lead after three innings, highlighted by a seven
run first inning.
Stanford racked up 17 hits and pounded out five
home runs, including Mayberry Jr's ninth ot the sea
son — more than double his freshman year total.
The most important offensive development of the
weekend, however, came with Chris Carter's perfor
mance at the plate. He had two hits, including a home
run and three RBIs in Saturday's win, after starting
at designated hitter Thursday for the first time since
March 30 against San Jose State.
Stanford returns home for the first time in two
weeks tomorrow when it hosts Santa Clara in a non
conference game at 6 p.m.
