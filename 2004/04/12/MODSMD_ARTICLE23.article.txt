# Men end losing streaky beating ASU and Arizona

### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
The losing streak has been snapped.
After gaining two decisive victories against No.
47 Arizona State and No. 23 Arizona this weekend,
the No. 10 Stanford men's tennis team is back on a
winning track.
The team's confidence seemed to be lagging
after losses to Southern California, UCLA and Cal
last week, but these two wins will help to propel the
team into the approaching NCAA Championships.
"We're not a great team, but we're competitive
and we're going to be great near the end of the

year," said head coach Dick Gould earlier this week
when predicting the outcome of the two matches.
"These guys will rebound."
And rebound they did.
The score was 7-0 after Friday's match against
Arizona State, held at the Sun Devil's Whiteman
Tennis Center. The Cardinal swept all singles
matches and won two doubles matches.
Coach Gould decided to switch up the doubles
teams for the two matches after the previous
matchups failed to bring in wins.
Sophomore Ail-American K.C. Corkery and ju
nior Phil Sheng played for the first time together in
their collegiate tennis careers, bringing in an 8-5 win

over Arizona State's Andy Colombo and Christo
pher Biro.
"We actually played together a little growing up,
so it felt fairly comfortable," said Corkery about
playing with Sheng. 'it's obviously weird with how
much we've switched up the doubles lineup this
year. We played pretty well together considering it
was one of our first times in college play."
At the No. 3 spot, sophomore James Pade and
freshman James Wan were paired together as usual,
proving their status as a successful doubles team by
trouncing Daniel Davies and Clinton Letcher.
The only loss of the day came from the
duo of senior Carter Morris and junior Sam
Warburg, who had a previous dual-match
record of 5-1 together. They gave up a 8-5
decision to Arizona State's Jonathan Kin
sella and Chris Stewart.
However, it was nothing hut win after
win once singles play started.
Stanford's No. 11 Warburg took on
Chris Stewart at the No. 1 spot, trampling
him, 6-4, 6-2, while No. 110 Corkery
downed the Sun Devils' Christopher Biro,
6-4, 6-3. No. 85 Wan walked off the court
victorious, as usual, with a 7-6 (4), 6-3 win
over Jonathan Kinsella.
Pade grabbed a 6-4, 6-1 win over Nick
Hegarty while freshman Chris Rasmussen
defeated Daniel Davies, 6-3, 6-4.
At the No. 4 spot, Sheng fought long and
hard for his win, but eventually overcame
Arizona State's Ryan Mc√üride, 6-4,6-7 (2),
1-0 (7), to close out the dual match.
The Cardinal was looking just as sharp
on Saturday when it swept the doubles
matches and five out of six singles points
against Arizona, winning by a score of 6-1.
Morris / Warburg took on Colin
O'Grady and Roger Matalonga at the
No. 1 spot, downing them 9-8 (5), while

Corkery / Sheng defeated Daniel Andrus
and Whi Kim, 8-4, and Pade / Wan
grabbed an 8-2 victory over Tim Mullane
and Paul Warkentin.
In singles. Warburg took a three-set vic
tory over No. 96 Roger Matalonga, 4-6,6-2,
6-3, while Corkery nabbed a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3
win over Whi Kim. At the No. 3 spot. Wan
collected his 21st straight win, downing
Colin O'Grady, 6-3, 6-4.
Stanford's Pade had no problems dis
patching Tom Lloyd, 6-3, 6-2, and Morris
won a hard fought battle over Daniel An
drus, 7-5,1-6, 7-5.
The only loss of the day was given up to
Arizona's Paul Warkentin, who defeated
Rasmussen, 7-5, 6-3.
The Cardinal will return to the Farm to host
No. 20 Pepperdine on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m.
The Waves have a 15-7 overall record after de
feating No. 39 Fresno State on Saturday.
Stanford holds a 24-3 all-time record
against Pepperdine. The last time the two
teams met, Stanford broke the Waves, 7-0.
"They were really new last year because
they lost their coach and some of their good
players, but this year they're back into it,"
Warburg said. "They're a dangerous team."
This time around, Pepperdine will bring
two ranked singles players and two ranked
doubles teams into the lineup.
No. 22 Pedro Rico and No. 45 Calle
Hansen may prove to be a threat to the Car
dinal, as singles players and as the No. 22
doubles team. No. 42 Scott Doerner and
Alex Herrera are also ranked as a tandem
for the Waves.
