# Men end losing streaky beating ASU and Arizona

### KAIYA REEVE STAFF WRITER 
The losing streak has been snapped.
After gaining two decisive victories against No.
47 Arizona State and No. 23 Arizona this weekend,
the No. 10 Stanford men's tennis team is back on a
winning track.
The team's confidence seemed to be lagging
after losses to Southern California, UCLA and Cal
last week, but these two wins will help to propel the
team into the approaching NCAA Championships.
"We're not a great team, but we're competitive
and we're going to be great near the end of the

year," said head coach Dick Gould earlier this week
when predicting the outcome of the two matches.
"These guys will rebound."
And rebound they did.
The score was 7-0 after Friday's match against
Arizona State, held at the Sun Devil's Whiteman
Tennis Center. The Cardinal swept all singles
matches and won two doubles matches.
Coach Gould decided to switch up the doubles
teams for the two matches after the previous
matchups failed to bring in wins.
Sophomore Ail-American K.C. Corkery and ju
nior Phil Sheng played for the first time together in
their collegiate tennis careers, bringing in an 8-5 win

over Arizona State's Andy Colombo and Christo
pher Biro.
"We actually played together a little growing up,
so it felt fairly comfortable," said Corkery about
playing with Sheng. 'it's obviously weird with how
much we've switched up the doubles lineup this
year. We played pretty well together considering it
was one of our first times in college play."
At the No. 3 spot, sophomore James Pade and
freshman James Wan were paired together as usual,
proving their status as a successful doubles team by
trouncing Daniel Davies and Clinton Letcher.
