# Softball drops two of three in close series with Cal
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Cardinal softball team (30-10,
3-3 Pacific-10 Conference) endured an epic
three-game series against No. 5 California
(35-6, 3-3) this weekend, going 1-2 against
the Golden Bears despite outplaying Cal in
each of the first two games of the series.
After winning, 5-3, in Berkeley on Fri
day, the Cardinal came into Saturday's
doubleheader at Boyd and Jill Smith Fam
ily Stadium brimming with confidence.
However, a 1-0 loss on a wild pitch in Sat
urday's first game seemed to suck the fight
out of the Cardinal, as the poise and tenac
ity which had marked Stanford's play in
the first two games of the weekend seemed
to disappear in Saturday's second game, a
6-0 drubbing by the Bears.
The weekend began well for the Cardi
nal. With ace pitcher Dana "Lightning D"
Sorensen in the circle, the Cardinal hitters
knew they would be in a position to win if
they could manufacture some runs. The
offense came through for the Cardinal on
Friday to the tune of five runs, despite fac
ing one of the top pitchers in the country
in the Golden Bears' Kalina Thorson.
Indeed, Thorson came into Friday's
matchup undefeated on the season with a
perfect 15-0 record. Thanks to the offen
sive efforts of senior catcher Jessica Allis
ter, sophomore outfielder Catalina Morris
and junior designated player Leah Nelson
and the stellar pitching of Sorensen, Thor
son left Friday's game 15-1 and the Cardi
nal returned to Stanford victorious.

Friday's 5-3 Cardinal victory featured a
home run by Nelson, an Oakland native
with a large cheering section at the Berke
ley game. Sorensen struck out 10 Bears en
route to her 18th victory, and Morris had
two RBIs in Friday's game. Allister went
3-for-3 to begin a consecutive-hits streak,
which would extend to six straight at-bats
in Saturday's early game.
On Saturday afternoon the Cardinal re
turned home to face the Golden Bears in a
doubleheader at Smith Family Stadium.
The first game of the afternoon was a
hard-fought pitchers' duel as Sorensen
took the circle again for the Cardinal, this
time against California's Kelly Anderson,
who came into the game with a sub-1.00
ERA. Sorensen matched Anderson pitch
for-pitch throughout the game, striking
out six Bears and allowing only three
baserunners in seven masterful innings.
In fact, Sorensen allowed fewer hits
(two, versus four for Cal's Anderson) and
walks (one against Anderson's four), but a
fifth-inning wild pitch by Sorensen scored
Golden Bear Jessica Parmanian and pro
vided all the offense Anderson would
need, as she shut out the Cardinal despite
allowing eight baserunners over seven in
nings. Allister again went 3-for-3 but was
stranded all three times, and the Cardinal
went down 1-0 in a game which seemed to
hang over the Stanford's psyche during
Saturday's second game.

thing going offensively in Saturday's

nightcap as Cal's Karlina Thorson
bounced back from Friday's loss to
hold the Cardinal to just two hits in
seven scoreless innings.
Sophomore pitcher Laura Severson
didn't even make it out of the first inning
for the Cardinal, allowing five baserun
ners and two runs before being pulled
for freshman Danika Dukes in relief.
Dukes proved to be no more adept
at stopping the Golden Bear offense,
as she was touched up for four runs in
the third before being relieved by
Severson, the pitcher Dukes had ini
tially replaced.
The Cardinal defense was no better,
as Stanford committed three fielding er
rors in a 6-0 debacle in which seemingly
no Cardinal player came out unscathed.
Stanford head coach John Rittman
exhibited a tempered optimism after
Saturday's games, despite the difficult
end to the weekend.

"We played very well the first two
games," Rittman said. "[Saturday,] in
the first game we gave ourselves some
opportunities, but they got the breaks.
We just couldn't get the timely hit.
Then in the second game, we just didn't
show up. Laura [Severson] got hit real
hard in the first inning, and then we just
didn't step up the rest of the game."
Rittman pointed out the lights-out
pitching of Sorensen and the consistent
hitting of Allister as bright spots from
the weekend's games, but wouldn't
make any predictions regarding next
Friday's game at home versus top
ranked Arizona (38-1, 2-0).
"We can't look past Tuesday," said
Rittman regarding the Cardinal's im
pending doubleheader at home against
Sacramento State. "Sac State is very
good this year. They've got some good
pitchers. We just can't look ahead."
The softball team plays five home
games this week: the doubleheader ver
sus Sacramento State on Tuesday, Fri
day's game versus Arizona and a Satur
day doubleheader versus No. 27 Ari
zona State. Tuesday's doubleheader
begins at 5 p.m.
