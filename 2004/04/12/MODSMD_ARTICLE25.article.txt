# Water polo downs No. 6 Cal, beats up on Pacific
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR STAFF WRITER 
Even though Friday's game against California (12-11,3-
6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was the Stanford
water polo team's official Big Splash, the Cardinal (16-3,8-
1) carried the theme throughout the weekend, going from
Friday's solid win to making its biggest splash against Pa
cific (3-22, 0-10).
No. 2 Stanford gave its fans a good show in both matches
this weekend, beating N0.6 Cal, 9-5, and Pacific, 18-5.
Friday's match with Cal was also Stanford's Senior Day.
Pre-game ceremonies for the departing seniors — drivers
Laurel Champion and Lauren Faust and 2-meter defender
Wendy Watkins — began as the hot day gave way to a warm
night. And because of heightened advertising for the
matchup, many student fans showed up, clad in Cardinal cos
tume for Stanford's final regular-season game.
However, almost as soon as the seniors finished receiving
flowers and applause, the Bears netted a goal. After Katie
Card scored first on a 6-on-5, the Bears strengthened their
lead with Allison Gold's seven-meter shot into the corner.
Even though it was down 2-0, Stanford maintained its
composure — a characteristic that has led the team to many
wins this season.
"As long as we just stayed composed, we knew we could
just play our game and beat them," said sophomore driver
Scotti Shafer. "We knew that we just had to stay with it."
Stanford came back on the counterattack with a goal from
Shafer to cut Cal's lead in half. With goalkeeper Meridith Mc-
Coll blocking shots — finishing the game with a total of eight
saves — the Cardinal was able to get back into the game.
"I think in the beginning when [Cal] scored those first two
goals we might have been a little tentative on defense, but we
decided that they couldn't score anymore and that we had to
be more aggressive," said freshman driver Katie Hansen,
who scored two goals in the game. "We started playing more
[like we] should have been [playing] the whole time, which
was just being more aggressive and not letting them get the
ball to set."
Stanford stepped up its defense toward the end of the first
period and started out the second with a steal by McColl that
led to Katie Hansen's first goal on a 3-on-2 to tie the game for
the Cardinal.

"We had a 3-on-2 and I got the ball coming down the left
side of the goal," Hansen said. "I was open, went cross-cage
and it went in."
Stanford began to slowly extend its lead, making it harder
for Cal too attempt a comeback. Chirstine Hewko's pass to
Val Riss was lobbed in for the Cardinal lead. Kelty Luber's
hard shot over the head of California goalkeeper Lauren
Dennis and Hansen's second goal followed.
Stanford held the Golden Bears scoreless in the second
period with smart, quick defense — much of which was sup
plied by the goalkeeper.
"Meredith played really good this game and one of the
things that helped us out was that she stole the ball from two
meters," Shafer said. "Her being able to come out make a lot
of big saves helped us get out on the counterattack and score
some goals the other way."
Stanford pulled ahead of California, 5-2, by the end of the
first half ,but the Bears pressured the Cardinal with a goal to
begin the second half. A nice backhand shot by sophomore
2-meter Nancy El-Sakkary gave the Cardinal a three-goal
lead again. Stanford continued to extend its lead with goals
from Hewko, who co-led the team with two goals in the
game, and freshman 2-meter defender Alison Gregorka.
"Cal, they are an emotional team, and once they get on a
run they can keep it going fora while," Hansen said. "We
knew that we would have to keep them [at bay] and not let
them get on that run. There were a few times when we backed
off a little bit and let them kind of get back in the game a little
bit. But that just tells us we need to be consistent."
The Cardinal felt it did a good job at keeping the Bears at
a safe distance, so as not to let the momentum of the game
turn around.
Stanford sealed its victory with a final goal in the
fourth to extend its winning streak against California to
14 straight.
The Cardinal simply thrashed Pacific Saturday afternoon.
El-Sakkary and Shafer each pushed three across the line
as the Stanford defense held Pacific scoreless throughout
much of the first half. Thanks to the help of five other Cardi
nal goal-scorers, Stanford led 10-1 at the half.
A struggling Tiger defense was led by Amanda Tucker
and Morgan Diehl. Unfortunately for the Tigers, five goals
would not prove to be enough as Stanford held a shooting
clinic to close its home schedule.

ball to set."
Stanford stepped up its defense toward the end of the first
period and started out the second with a steal by McColl that
led to Katie Hansen's first goal on a 3-on-2 to tie the game for
the Cardinal.

"We had a 3-on-2 and I got the ball coming down the left
side of the goal," Hansen said. "I was open, went cross-cage
and it went in."
Stanford began to slowly extend its lead, making it harder
for Cal too attempt a comeback. Chirstine Hewko's pass to
Val Riss was lobbed in for the Cardinal lead. Kelty Luber's
hard shot over the head of California goalkeeper Lauren
Dennis and Hansen's second goal followed.
Stanford held the Golden Bears scoreless in the second
period with smart, quick defense — much of which was sup
plied by the goalkeeper.
"Meredith played really good this game and one of the
things that helped us out was that she stole the ball from two
meters," Shafer said. "Her being able to come out make a lot
of big saves helped us get out on the counterattack and score
some goals the other way."
Stanford pulled ahead of California, 5-2, by the end of the
first half ,but the Bears pressured the Cardinal with a goal to
begin the second half. A nice backhand shot by sophomore
2-meter Nancy El-Sakkary gave the Cardinal a three-goal
lead again. Stanford continued to extend its lead with goals
from Hewko, who co-led the team with two goals in the
game, and freshman 2-meter defender Alison Gregorka.
"Cal, they are an emotional team, and once they get on a
run they can keep it going fora while," Hansen said. "We
knew that we would have to keep them [at bay] and not let
them get on that run. There were a few times when we backed
off a little bit and let them kind of get back in the game a little
bit. But that just tells us we need to be consistent."
The Cardinal felt it did a good job at keeping the Bears at
a safe distance, so as not to let the momentum of the game
turn around.
Stanford sealed its victory with a final goal in the
fourth to extend its winning streak against California to
14 straight.
The Cardinal simply thrashed Pacific Saturday afternoon.
El-Sakkary and Shafer each pushed three across the line
as the Stanford defense held Pacific scoreless throughout
much of the first half. Thanks to the help of five other Cardi
nal goal-scorers, Stanford led 10-1 at the half.
A struggling Tiger defense was led by Amanda Tucker
and Morgan Diehl. Unfortunately for the Tigers, five goals
would not prove to be enough as Stanford held a shooting
clinic to close its home schedule.

The No. 2 Cardinal made big waves this weekend in The Big Splash on Friday, beating No. 6 California
9-5 before dominating an overmatched Pacific team 18-5 on Saturday.
Even though Friday's game against California (12-11,3-
6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was the Stanford
water polo team's official Big Splash, the Cardinal (16-3,8-
1) carried the theme throughout the weekend, going from
Friday's solid win to making its biggest splash against Pa
cific (3-22, 0-10).
No. 2 Stanford gave its fans a good show in both matches
this weekend, beating N0.6 Cal, 9-5, and Pacific, 18-5.
Friday's match with Cal was also Stanford's Senior Day.
Pre-game ceremonies for the departing seniors — drivers
Laurel Champion and Lauren Faust and 2-meter defender
Wendy Watkins — began as the hot day gave way to a warm
night. And because of heightened advertising for the
matchup, many student fans showed up, clad in Cardinal cos
tume for Stanford's final regular-season game.
However, almost as soon as the seniors finished receiving
flowers and applause, the Bears netted a goal. After Katie
Card scored first on a 6-on-5, the Bears strengthened their
lead with Allison Gold's seven-meter shot into the corner.
Even though it was down 2-0, Stanford maintained its
composure — a characteristic that has led the team to many
wins this season.
"As long as we just stayed composed, we knew we could
just play our game and beat them," said sophomore driver
Scotti Shafer. "We knew that we just had to stay with it."
Stanford came back on the counterattack with a goal from
Shafer to cut Cal's lead in half. With goalkeeper Meridith Mc-
Coll blocking shots — finishing the game with a total of eight
saves — the Cardinal was able to get back into the game.
"I think in the beginning when [Cal] scored those first two
goals we might have been a little tentative on defense, but we
decided that they couldn't score anymore and that we had to
be more aggressive," said freshman driver Katie Hansen,
who scored two goals in the game. "We started playing more
[like we] should have been [playing] the whole time, which
was just being more aggressive and not letting them get the
ball to set."
