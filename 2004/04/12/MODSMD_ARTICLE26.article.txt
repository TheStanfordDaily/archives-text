The No. 19 Stanford women's lacrosse team (7-5, 4-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was stopped at home
by No. 13 Northwestern on Friday night, 11-5, ending its
four-game winning streak.
Stanford will continue to be the top seed next month in
the MPSF Championship because the Cardinal's MPSF
record was not affected by the loss to the Wildcats, the de
feat may cause Stanford to drop out of the top 20 in the na
tional rankings.
The Wildcats, who are 6-1 on the road this season, re
turned 19 letter-winners from last year, including 12
starters. Their defeat of the Cardinal marks their seventh
straight win. Still confident after its 18-4 defeat over Con
necticut last Sunday, Northwestern wasted no time on Fri
day night, supported by bleachers filled with fans dressed

in purple.
Only three minutes into the game. Northwestern fresh
man Lindsay Finnochiaro scored unassisted, her first of
three goals on Friday night.
Five minutes later. Northwestern netted another goal.
About a minute later, with 20:51 remaining, Stanford
replied with its first goal, scored by sophomore Megan
Burker, who has tallied twenty goals and eight assists this
season.
After another Northwestern goal, Stanford quick
ly responded, as senior Abbi Hills netted a goal with
15:40 remaining. Hills leads the team with 23 goals
scored this season.
The Wildcats struck again with 10:28 remaining in the
first, and a timeout was called with the Wildcats leading, 4-
2. Despite its chance to regroup during the break, Stanford
was not able to stop Northwestern from scoring again

shortly after the timeout.
Hills scored another goal for Stanford with 5:55 left,
narrowing Northwestern's lead to 5-3. However, the Wild
cats pulled ahead again to 6-3 with under five minutes re
maining in the first half as a goal was netted by sophomore
Laura Glassanos.
Two minutes into the second half. Northwestern quick
ly scored, increasing the lead to 7-3, with Northwestern
having made seven out of eleven shots taken and Stanford
having madejust three of 11. Following the goal early in the
second half. Northwestern scored three more to improve
its lead to 10-3.
With 11:56 remaining in the game, Stanford sopho
more Nyerr Parham scored the Cardinal's first goal of the
second half, making the score 10-4. After another North
western goal, Burker scored her second and the game's
final goal of the night with a little over two minutes left,

making the final score 11-5.
Burker's goal contributed to Stanford's five goals out of
20 shots as opposed to the Wildcats' impressive 11 for 21.
"Shooting was the difference," senior midfielder Kim
Cahill said. Cahill also thought the Cardinal's loss was par
tially due to the fact that the team "gave them too much re
spect in the midfield."
Added head coach Michele Uhlfelder: "Northwestern
did a great job of pushing the pace. We needed the same
intensity that we had during the last 10 minutes. They
played a nice game, and our shooting percentage wasn't
what we needed."
The team travels to Durham, N.C., next weekend to
play No. 4 Duke on Friday and unranked Davidson on
Sunday. Uhlfelder said that the team will "have a couple
days off and will think about today's game" in preparation
for next weekend.
