# Women add to winning streak, complete home season
## 
### MIA R. LEE STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, the top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (21-0) polished its spotless record by shutting out No.
37 Arizona (5-12) and No. 41 Arizona State (6-13) in the
Cardinal's last home matches of the season.
That makes an unlucky 13 shutouts this season fora
very lucky Cardinal.
But luck has little to do with the success of Stan
ford's seven ranked singles players and three ranked
doubles teams.
Seniors Lauren Barnikow and Emilia Anderson were
honored as they played their final matches at Taube Fam
ily Tennis Stadium, emerging victorious in both singles and
doubles action.
Barnikow, who is currently ranked No. 43 nationally,
clinched a two-set victory over the Wildcats' Sabrina Ca
pannolo, 7-5,7-5. The No. 4 singles player picked up the
pace of her game against Arizona after heading into a 10-

point tiebreak against the Sun Devils' Kelly Perry on the
previous day, 3-6,6-2,1-0 (9)
Perry, a junior, was the only member of her team to
steal a set from the Cardinal on Friday.
Capannolo (21-13) is a tenacious freshman who already
has lots of experience despite only having played three of
her matches against ranked players.
No. 75 Anderson's performance over the weekend was
very similar to Barnikow's. Competing in the No. 6 singles
position, Anderson posted a decisive victory over Ari
zona's Iza Ferreira, 6-4,6-1.
But Anderson struggled against Rebecca Rankin on
Saturday, dropping the first set, 3-6. She regained momen
tum in the second, blanking Rankin, 6-0, and finally win
ning the match in the third, 6-3.
Boasting a substantial 21-5 record, Anderson is on a
seven-match winning streak.
Success is no stranger to the Cardinal, with Barnikow
(29-4) and Logar (28-2) both going undefeated in the dual
season of competitive match play.

No. 35 Logar has stormed past her competition, not
dropping a match since the round of 16 at the Stanford
hosted ITA Northwest Championships, where she fell to
Oregon's title-winning No. 7 Daria Panova, 2-6,6-2,1-6 in
late October.
Logar claimed a collegiate title of her own this season,
defeating No. 28 Aniela Mojzis of North Carolina at the
Freeman Memorial Championships in Las Vegas, 6-2,6-1.
Logar is currently the sixth-highest-ranked freshman in
the nation. Leading the pack is No. 12 Jelena Pandzic of
Fresno State.
Pandzic has been a previous source of trouble for
reigning NCAA singles champion, sophomore Amber
Liu (13-4). When the two met in non-league play last
month, Liu notched only four game wins in her
straight-set loss.
But this weekend. No. 10 Liu pulled no punches as she
breezed by No. 17 Dianne Hollands of Arizona, 7-6 (5),
6-2, and crushed Arizona State's No. 88 Joslynn Burkett,
6-1,6-0.

No. 13 sophomore and second singles player Alice
Barnes (27-5) also compiled a pair of straight-set wins
over the weekend. Barnes got the best of Arizona
State's Wendy Pilecka, 6-3, 6-4, and swept Arizona's
No. Ill Maja Mlakar, 7-6 (2), 6-2.
Barnes has relinquished a single dual match this year,
falling to No. 52 Daniela Bercek of UCLA.
In the doubles arena, the top-ranked duo of
Barnikow and junior Erin Burdette improved its
record to 25-2 after downing the Wildcats' Lauren Co
lalillo and Kady Pooler, 8-3.
Barnes and Liu had a tougher time at No. 2 doubles
against Pilecka and Cindy Sureephong, pulling out a hard
fought win, 8-6.
Stanford will close out the regular season this weekend
when it heads south to face No. 7 UCLA and No. 8 South
ern California.
The games begin Friday at 1:30 p.m. at the Los Angeles
Tennis Center. The team will play again on Saturday at
noon at Marks Tennis Stadium.
