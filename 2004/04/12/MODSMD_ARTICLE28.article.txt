# Stanford Exchange Store encourages students to recycle
## 
### ANDREW GAY 
The Stanford Exchange Store — a place where
students, faculty, staff and members of the commu
nity can drop off items they no longer use and also
pick up items for free — will open its doors for the
first time today from noon to 2 p.m.
Nicknamed the SEx Store, the Stanford Exchange
will be open regularly Monday through Thursday,
from noon to 2 p.m. in the Blender's Green Room.
The Stanford Exchange Store is aimed at promoting
reuse and recycling of a variety of items from com
puter speakers to clothing.
"Many students have junk in their rooms that
would normally end up in the trash," said junior
( hristine Chiu, one of the SEx store's founders. "Stu
dents also tend to not have that much money so we
wanted to provide a forum to provide for these needs
of getting rid of clutter and getting useful stuff."
Chiu said that she first realized the need for some
sort of Stanford Exchange last vear, when she was an

intern at the Stanford Recycling Center and learned
that there was no permanent space available for the
program. She said the need fora Stanford Exchange
was further demonstrated when the Stanford Recy
cling Center set up tables in White Plaza where com
munity members could exchange items during
America Recycles Day and Earth Day. Members of
the community, faculty and students traded every
thing from electronics to clothes to futons, but a
year-round program was not possible without a per
manent space.
While the idea for an exchange store is not new, a
permanent store was not possible until the creation
of the ASSU Blender program which provides group
space for innovative student organizations. Last
week, the Stanford Exchange founders Chiu and
Kate Stanford have set up tables in White Plaza to
field donations for the SEx store. They have amassed
a collection including shoes, clothes, hangers, games
and even a vacuum. The store wilt not store larger
items like couches or desks, but it will have a bulletin

board so that those items can still be exchanged.
Similar programs, such as the Stanford Bazaar
Auction Web site, an online forum to auction and
sell items to other members of the Stanford Commu
nity have not been successful but Chiu said she is op
timistic about the programs future.
"The SEx store will be a success as long as we can
get enough publicity and inform people of this ser
vice," she said.
Another difference between the Bazaar and the
SEx store is that students do not have to pay or even
donate items in order to take advantage of the ser
vice provided.
Other student reactions were more mixed, but
most agreed the store could serve a valuable func
tion if successful.
"It sounds like a great idea because I have a ton of
stuff I need to get rid of that other people might be
able to use," said freshman Jenny Hernandez. "I just
hope that there will be enough donations so that I
can get stuff I'm looking for too."

When asked if the exchange program would be
useful, freshman John Oster said, "The SEx Store
definitely has a great nickname and I might check it
out, but 1 don't really have anything to donate."
While the SEx store already has an impressive in
ventory for those interested in picking up items, its
success will depend upon an active community to do
nate items that might otherwise wind up in the trash.
If the store proves popular this year, it will still have
to reapply for space each quarter in the Blender.
Stanford and Chiu said they plan on eventually
getting a Web site that would feature an "Items of
the Week" section and have an online inventory.
They also plan on expanding their services during
the end of the academic year to target students mov
ing out.
"Eventually, we would like this to be a sustain
able thing and move into a more permanent location
than the Blender." Stanford said. "This service is
valuable and should be available on a regular basis to
the community."
