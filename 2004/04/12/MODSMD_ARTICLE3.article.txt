# Special fees winners announced; results spark controversy

### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Coffee House was crammed so tightly on Friday evening be
fore the results of the ASSU election were announced that man
agement had to request that people move from the doorway to
make room for entering customers. Candidates, members of stu
dent groups and other interested parties chatted with each other or
nervously gnawed on burritos until Elections Commissioner Ellie
Martin stepped forward with a megaphone and asked, "Are you
ready to hear who the next ASSU President is?"
Martin and Assistant Commissioner Alida Garcia, both juniors,
read the results shortly after 5 p.m. There were several surprises,
particularly in the special-fees category.
Among those groups that did not receive special-fees funding
were MEChA, the Axe Committee, the Mind's Eye and the Stan
ford Progressive. The announcement of MEChA as the only mem
ber of the Students of Color Coalition to be rejected for special fees
seemed to dismay many in the room, including Garcia, who did not
veil her displeasure.
"Ya'll suck for that, personally," she said.
In an e-mail sent out to the MEChA list after the announce
ment, Garcia said she had spoken to the Lee-Mefford campaign
about her concerns.
"I am heavily involved in the ASSU and please believe 1 will be
regulating on Lee-Mefford to make sure they do what they need to
be doing," she said.
During fall quarter, MEChA had been targeted by the
Stanford Review, the University's conservative newspaper,
which alleged that MEChA's founding documents contained
racist statements.
"Not getting special fees this year won't affect MEChA directly
as much as it will effect the Chicano / Latino community at Stan
ford as a whole," said the group's co-chair, sophomore Francisco
Cendejas. "The MEChA special fee is the largest single contributor
to nearly every major event for the community, including events
that are planned by or for students who aren't regular members."
In the Undegraduate Senate race, freshman Omar Shakir gar
nered the most votes at 1,499. Shakir ran an intense, inventive fly
ering campaign that raised his visibility on campus.
"I'm really excited," Shakir said. "It's been a crazy, busy week."
Sophomore Chris Lin, an incumbent, was reelected with
1,096 votes. He expressed an eagerness to get to work with his
new associates.
"I read the election handbook and they seem like solid people,"
he said. "I look forward to getting to know them better over the
next couple of weeks."
In the class-president races, Senior High School won the senior
class presidential race, the O.C. won the junior class race and the
S.O.L.V. slate won the sophomore class race, as the only team that
ran opposed.
In the executive race, the Lee-Mefford slate came out on the top
with 2,072 votes, while Husbands-Schwartz took second at 1,749
votes. The Chappie slate of senior Charlie Stockman and junior
Matthew Henick was eliminated in the first run-off after receiving
638 votes. After the results were announced, Henick did the best he
could to recover from the loss.
"All Chappie members, we're going to Chili's now, meet in the
office," he told his supporters, who filed solemnly out of the Coffee
House carrying signs that advertised a gun show.
The Elections Commission also announced results pertaining to
the ASSU general-fee rate and the Great Donation. The general
fee next year will not change. The Great Donation passed and its
funds will go to the organization Doctors Without Borders.
