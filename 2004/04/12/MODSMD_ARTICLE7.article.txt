# Oxygen Collective meets to refute Bush's logging policy

### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
A group of entertainers and activists known
as the Oxygen Collective held an information
session on Saturday night to discuss their oppo
sition to President George W. Bush's initiative
to cut down trees to prevent forest fires. The
presentation, which included musical numbers
and a documentary screening, focused on the
Siskiyou Wild Rivers region that spans north
ern California and southern Oregon.
The region has been slated for the largest
timber sale in a national wilderness area in
United States history.
The Siskiyou area is the site of the 2002 Bis
cuit Fire that burned through 500,000 acres of
forest. The collective said they believe Bush is
using fire hysteria to launch an attack on west
ern forests and reap the profits from corporate
logging interests.
Home to botanical species found nowhere
else in the world, the Siskiyou is considered the
last wild place in the continental United States.
Through music, spoken word poetry and an
elaborate slide show, the Oxygen Collective ar
gued that the region should be protected and
emphasized the importance actually traveling
to the Siskiyou to protest when timber compa
ny trucks arrive this summer.
According to the collective, sporadic forest
fires are natural and healthy processes, renew
ing wilderness areas and spurring re-growth.
"Fires have contributed to the diversity of
this land for 10,(XK) years," said Oxygen Collec
tive member Lesley Adams during the slide
show. "Land needs fire like fish need water."
Although a variety of measures were taken

to fight the Biscuit Fire, it eventually burned
out on its own. The collective said that more fire
damage could actually be attributed to fires
started intentionally to create a fire line. The
areas where dead trees were hauled away have
failed to grow back as quickly due to the lack of
nutrients from burnt material. Areas that had
been logged and replanted were completely
wiped out because the trees had been placed
too close together.
"When Bush came to announce his healthy
forests policy, it was like a dark force spreading
over the land," said Oxygen Collective member
Rolf Skar. "And they are coming in a big way."
Skar said that most people assume the
Siskiyou is a protected area, in other regions
that have fallen under healthy forest policies,
forestry services have claimed they will pluck
out small trees and then have proceeded to
saw down trees that have stood for hundreds
of years. Thinning out small trees proved to be
too expensive, and as a result the forestry ser
vice removed the most fire-resistant ones,
Skar said.
"Logging opens up the canopy to sunlight
that dries out the land," he added. "This makes
the area only more vulnerable to fire."
Logging operations also require the con
struction of roads, which means more bull
dozers and more erosion, he added. Runoff
water is often contaminated and washes into
larger rivers that provide spawning habitat
for salmon.
The goals of the impending Biscuit Fire Re
covery Project — termed the Texas Chainsaw
Massacre by collective members due to the in
volvement of the Bush administration — in
clude logging 20,000 acres of old-growth re

serves and 12,179 acres of inventoried roadless
forest; as well as creating 50,200 acres of artifi
cial flammable tree plantations.
According to Oxygen Collective represen
tatives, the project will violate the Clean Water
Act, further endanger dwindling salmon popu
lations and actually increase the risk of fire for
surrounding communities.
"No one has ever seen anything like this
before," Skar said. "This is more logging than
has ever been proposed in a national forest.
Fire is just their smoke screen to log. It flies in
the face of science, public opinion and com
mon sense."
Scenes of trees being sawed down from the
documentary "Pick Axe" by Oxygen Collec
tive member Tim Ream were screened, in ad
dition to interviews with protesters who formed
a human blockade to keep loggers out of Warn
er Creek forest. Collective members said they
hope to convince people to come to the Siskiy
ou to join a similar effort.
Stanford was only one destination of on a
24-stop tour that will cover ground throughout
the state in an environmentally friendly bio
diesel bus.
"We stand at a special moment," Skar said.
"The future is truly at risk, and we are either
going to decide to lose or protect these forests
once and for all."
The collective members emphasized the
political forces that will shape the fate of the
Siskiyou, especially the upcoming presiden
tial election.
"This president is already on shaky ground
with the economy and terrorism and is a known
enemy to the environment," Ream said. "This
is a big opportunity."

President George W. Bush's proposal to thin forests in Southern Oregon and Northern Cali
fornia to prevent fire has been decried a hoax by environmentalists.
