Tan is best known for her novels, which include

composed entirely of writers. Other members of the
group include Stephen King and Dave Barry.
"Amy Tan has a compelling voice which has moved
and enchanted so many people," said Creative Writing
Program Director Eavan Boland, who first invited
Tan to speak at Stanford. "We are honored to have her
here at Stanford."
According to Boland, the Creative Writing
Program actively seeks to bring distinguished

contemporary writers such as Tan to Stanford
through the Jean and Bill Lane Lecture Series.
Toni Morrison, Larry McMurtry, Seamus Heaney
and Robert Hass are among the many writers who
have participated in the program. The events
often attract a large number of residents from
Stanford's neighboring communities, and are al
ways free to the public.
Tan was originally set to read at Stanford in Febru
ary, but an injury sustained during a ski trip forced her
to reschedule.
