# Panel addresses 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'
## Advocacy group questions policy's effectiveness 
### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The backlash against the mili
tary's failed "Don't Ask, Don't
Tell, Don't Pursue, Don't Harass"
policy has increased and will contin
ue to do so in the near future, said
C. Dixon Osburn, the executive di

rector of Servicemembers Legal
Defense Network (SLDN), in a
panel at the Stanford Law School
last night.
President Bill Clinton signed the
law, which is more commonly
known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"
in 1993, as a way of fulfilling his
promise to lift the ban on gays, les

bians and bisexuals in the military.
Yet Osburn cited cases such as
that of Private First Class Barry
Winchell — who was murdered in
1999 by soldiers who believed he
was gay — as evidence that the pol
icy was not working. He also men
tioned the case of Cadet Nicole Gal
van who was dismissed from West

Point because of information found
in her private diary that revealed
her sexual orientation.
According to Osburn, despite
the claims of the success of the
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, ap
proximately 10,000 servicemembers
were discharged from the military
for being gay since the law's incep
tion 10 years ago.
The conventional argument
against gays serving in the military
is that it will negatively affect "unit
cohesion." Yet Osburn contested
that idea, saying that the military
always decreases the amount of
gay discharges in times of war,
when the need for unit cohesion is
most paramount.
SLDN is a nonprofit organiza
tion that works to bring litigation
to courts and legislation to Con
gress to defend members of the
military who have suffered dis
crimination under "Don't Ask,
Don't Tell." Osburn told his audi
ence that SLDN is also trying to
change the popular conception
that "Don't Ask. Don't Tell" is an
adequate and effective policy.
"How do you begin to open a de
bate on equality when we've lost big,
and when public perception is that
("Don't Ask, Don't Tell] is a [posi
tive] step further?" he asked. "This is
about cultural transformation."
Fortunately for those who are
fighting on the side of the SLDN, this
may be the right moment to continue
their attempts to end the ban on gays
in the militarv, Osburn said. He

added that 79 percent of Americans
today support the rights of the gay
community to serve openly in the
military, as opposed to 57 percent in
1993, showing a large shift in societal
beliefs on this topic.
"I am enormously optimistic
about the prospect of getting rid of
'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,'" he said.
"There's ... this traditional federal
court deference to military policy.
But we do have a fighting chance,
and we will fight."
In addition to this transforma
tion of popular belief, the Pentagon
has also changed its position, saying
that anti-gay harassment is actually
detrimental to unit cohesion, Os
burn said.
In the end, Osburn expressed his
conviction of the importance of law
organizations in these issues and en
couraged his audience to think about
their future roles in such cases.
"These are the clients that you
are going to represent in your lives,"
he said. "Their lives are at stake,
their physical safety is at stake, their
livelihood is at stake. At stake is full
citizenship in our country."
Justin Johnson, a first year law
student, said that he agreed with Os
burn's statement's.
"I'm interested in gay rights is
sues in general, and [Osburn] does
great work," he said. "I think he's
very optimistic about making strides
in the political process which I hope
actually come about."
