Gather around the bonfire. This tale involves one of the
meanest, wildest beast man's ever handled. It's got four legs,
hooves, and a tough hide. Folks down in Texas A&M Uni
versity say they've found some rowdy cattle that are not only
difficult to handle, but are harder to eat.
Dr. Ron Randel, researcher with the Texas Agricultural
Experiment Station, found a correlation between the cat
tle's temperament and meat toughness.
First, he and Dr. Rhonda Vann of the Mississippi Agri
cultural and Forestry Experiment Station recorded the exit
speeds of each cattle from their chute with a motion detec-

tion device. Then, they determined the cat
tle's temperament by evaluating their in
teractions with other animals and their be
havior in a handling chute from a scale of 1
(non-aggressive, calm) to 5 (aggressive,
jumping).
The experiment yielded surprising results.
Using the standard scientific measurement
of meat tenderness, the Warner-Bratlzer
Shear force data (WBS), researchers were
able to determine the toughness of their
steerhorns. The method involved taking

snippets of steak less than two inches long and inserting
them into a shearing WBS machine.
Those steers with higher temperament scores and exit
speeds on average of 9 feet per second, had "moderately
tough" WBS scores, according to Vann.
There's an implication here, literally, at steak. If we can
measure the correlation between an animal's behaviors, or
to stretch this further, its "personality," with other physical
factors, this means there's something inherently biological
that reinforces those traits.
Here's where our vaqueros come into the picture. You
may have heard of them before. Nowadays, they go by the
name of "Nature" and "Nurture," and increasing evidence
shows that they're more like a horse and cowboy duo than
dueling desperadoes. One can't work without the other.
The environment —the "nurture" side of behavior —
often serves as a guiding track for certain behavioral traits.
The neurons in your brain —the "nature" side of behavior —
are wired in specific configurations, but synapses (connec
tions between neurons) may form in response to environ
mental cues. Over time, these neural responses can strength
en or weaken, eliciting specific behaviors.
The subtle pact between nature and nurture is so strong,
its linked to the production of emotion. Last February, sci
entists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that
when a mother gazes at her newborn child, the positive emo
tions she feels take root at the orbitalfrontal cortex, an emo
tion-processing region in the brain. Other examples include
the current anti-depressant prescription trend. In the U.S.
today, more than 20 million people are taking anti-depres
sants, which promote the reuptake of neurotransmitters
(chemicals in the brain), such as serotonin, that generally
work to make you feel good.
However, there is something else influencing behavior
than the aforementioned "biological embedding." Clinical
studies show there is a marginal difference between the
moods of people taking anti-depressants and those who
aren't. Most importantly, as of yet, no association has been
found between biology and the concept of free will. The
mother watching her son may be programmed to feel posi
tively, but there's nothing that dictates whether she will then
pick up the child, feed him, or simply continuing gazing. Ex
plaining behavior through the lens of nurture via nature may
give you a widespread scope, but it's still limited. The mind
is underrepresented in its capacity to wield behavior.
True, the consciousness could be a product of both nature
and nurture. But it still exerts its own agency. For instance,
in a placebo surgery trial studied by researchers at the Uni
versity of Denver last February, Parkinson's patients who
had received a placebo showed no difference in their per
ceived quality of life than those who had received a trans
plant of dopamine neurons. Both groups responded that
their quality of life actually improved.
Nature, nurture, self. The individual mind has as much
say in the nature/ nurture paradigm. It's like the reigns that
keep the cowboy and his horse riding full speed. Somehow
we have to begin to understand the connection between con
sciousness, our bodies, and the environment we live in. And
that's an area of science brimming with twisted trails, de
serted lands, and dead-end cliffs.
