# Tech conference with big names
## CEOs of Cisco, Qualcomm keynote speakers 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
The first annual Technology Industry
Conference held at the business school
last Wednesday featured keynotes by
two legendary CEOs and dozens of pan
elist on topics ranging from globalization
to networking to technology investment.
In addition to other events, such as the
annual Cool Products Expo, the Confer
ence brings industry professionals to
campus, allowing students to interact
with venture capitalists, entrepreneurs
and executives.
The keynote speeches were given by
John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, and
Irvin Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm. They
discussed their companies and the cur
rent economic environment as well as
sharing personal advice and experi
ence.
Jacobs told a brief history of Qual
comm, presenting critical events as deci
sions that needed to be made, such as
whether to schedule a product demon
stration before the technology was com
plete and whether to sell Qualcomm's
handset manufacturing divisions. In
both cases, they decided to proceed.

"Every one of these decisions is
somewhat different and one has to look
at both upsides and downsides to the de
cision, and what it is that's really impor
tant to you," Jacobs said. "On many of
these, you're dealing with another com
pany. I'm a great believer in trying to
work out an approach dealing with con
tracts that's fair on both sides. If it isn't,
it's not going to last very long."
Though making such decisions is dif
ficult, Jacobs advocates placing oneself
in a situation where both outcomes of
any choice are favorable. He feels that
students need to obtain broad skills that
will grant them flexibility in the future.
He believes that it is important to dis
cover what you are passionate about
and then pursue that area.
"The main thing is to find a job or
start a business where [you] can work in
the areas that are the most fun to [you]
because that encourages you to put the
time in and get something done," Jacobs
said.
Jacobs also shared some advice for
would-be entrepreneurs:
"A key aspect of anyone starting
their own business is having lots of pa
tience," he said. "No matter how good

the idea, nothing happens as quickly as
you expect, so it's important to keep
your determination."
Chambers spoke about leadership
and strategy.
"Leadership is all about the quality
of the team you put together around you
and your ability to motivate them," he
said, 'it is really important to take a step
back and realize that it takes you 3-5
years to drive key goals and strategy.
And yet the average life expectancy of a
CEO today in the valley is 4 years.
That's one of the problems we face. It's
important to have a strategy beyond an
individual."
Chambers has been CEO of Cisco
for 19 years. He credits his successful
leadership to taking risks and talking to
customers.
"If you're not making mistakes,
you're not taking enough risks," Cham
bers said. "If you don't take risks, you
get left behind."
Roger McNamee, a co-founder Sil
ver Lake Partners — a pioneer of tech
nology private equity — and Integral
Capital Partners — a visionary of
crossover investing, which combines
public market investing in technology

with later stage venture
capital—spoke about in
vesting in technology.
McNamee was one of
few people who foresaw
the burst of the dot com
bubble. A herd mentali
ty on the parts of in
vestors and en
trepreneurs leads to
over inflated economies.
"Everyone always
wants to do the thing
that has worked most re
cently," he said. "They
never want to do what's
going to work next.
Look at what everyone
else wants to do, and do
what they don't want to
do."
He described the re
quirements fora tech
nology to make a market
impact.
McNamee expressed
optimistism about the
future.
"I think that this is a
great time to be coming
out of college or business
school with a career
focus on technology," he
said. "The technology in
dustry is between major
waves right now."
Monitoring the glob
al economy is also criti
cal.
"You should consider
that countries like all of
Eastern Europe, Russia,
China, India, big chunks
of Latin America as
places that, fora variety
of historical reasons,
spent 50 to 75 years dis
connected from the
world economy," said
Claude Leglise, vice
president of Intel Capi-

tal.
"What has happened [recently] is
that they have in fact joined the world
economy and the people who live there
are just like you and I. These people are
very smart. While a lot of the political
debate is focused on outsourcing, I be
lieve that's not the issue. The issue is
that these smart engineers, these smart
businesspeople will develop products
and services that will compete head on
with what we do in the United States
and Western Europe," Leglise added.
Mike Orsak, a general partner at
Worldview Technology Partners,
agrees.
"[People are) trying to figure out
how to sell into China, how to manufac
ture in China, and how to do develop
ment in China," he said. "The biggest
gold rush in the world right now is in
China. Some people will get rich, some
people won't."
He also dismisses current backlash
against globalization.
"Offshoring has been going on for
some 15 years," Orsak said. "The
change is because the number of jobs in
the US has been shrinking in the last
years, then it becomes a very politically
sensitive subject."
Carl Showalter, a general partner at
Lightspeed Venture Partners, discussed
what his firm looks for when investing in
a start-up.
"We think of it in three categories:
the team, the market, and the technolo
gy," he said. "You have to have a bright
team, a market that you can get into
without getting squashed by larger com
petitors, and technology that is sustain
able. If you have those things, we get
very interested."
Janice Roberts, managing director at
Mayfield, also felt that venture capital
ists are more visible than last year.
"I think VCs are much more active
than they have been in the past and
much more confident, assertive, aggres
sive, and thoughtful about what they
want to invest in," she said. "So, people
are very open and feeling very good.
Good VCs see this as a long-term busi
ness, which it is. We're being more
proactive [about investing]."
It is also crucial to target a proposal
for funding to the correct people.
"I would certainly suggest that you
find a way into a venture firm that's not
blasting an e-mail with a business plan,"
Roberts said. "We are all very closely
linked to Stanford and feel very strong
ly about supporting our community."
Will Snow, CEO of start-up mem
sAudio and Stanford Class of 1977, came
to the conference to get a sense of the
current business climate in the area.
Mark Martel, a MBA student at the
Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley
and Stanford Class of 1996, came to see
how a technology conference is run at
Stanford, having been to several at
Berkeley.
"I thought today was really valuable
in terms of the quality of the speakers
and the topics that were presented,"
Snow said. "There was really something
for everyone, from students to en
trepreneurs to seasoned businesspeo
ple. I thought it was a great day."

Though making such decisions is dif
ficult, Jacobs advocates placing oneself
in a situation where both outcomes of
any choice are favorable. He feels that
students need to obtain broad skills that
will grant them flexibility in the future.
He believes that it is important to dis
cover what you are passionate about
and then pursue that area.
"The main thing is to find a job or
start a business where [you] can work in
the areas that are the most fun to [you]
because that encourages you to put the
time in and get something done," Jacobs
said.
Jacobs also shared some advice for
would-be entrepreneurs:
"A key aspect of anyone starting
their own business is having lots of pa
tience," he said. "No matter how good

the idea, nothing happens as quickly as
you expect, so it's important to keep
your determination."
Chambers spoke about leadership
and strategy.
"Leadership is all about the quality
of the team you put together around you
and your ability to motivate them," he
said, 'it is really important to take a step
back and realize that it takes you 3-5
years to drive key goals and strategy.
And yet the average life expectancy of a
CEO today in the valley is 4 years.
That's one of the problems we face. It's
important to have a strategy beyond an
individual."
Chambers has been CEO of Cisco
for 19 years. He credits his successful
leadership to taking risks and talking to
customers.
"If you're not making mistakes,
you're not taking enough risks," Cham
bers said. "If you don't take risks, you
get left behind."
Roger McNamee, a co-founder Sil
ver Lake Partners — a pioneer of tech
nology private equity — and Integral
Capital Partners — a visionary of
crossover investing, which combines
public market investing in technology

with later stage venture
capital—spoke about in
vesting in technology.
McNamee was one of
few people who foresaw
the burst of the dot com
bubble. A herd mentali
ty on the parts of in
vestors and en
trepreneurs leads to
over inflated economies.
"Everyone always
wants to do the thing
that has worked most re
cently," he said. "They
never want to do what's
going to work next.
Look at what everyone
else wants to do, and do
what they don't want to
do."
He described the re
quirements fora tech
nology to make a market
impact.
McNamee expressed
optimistism about the
future.
"I think that this is a
great time to be coming
out of college or business
school with a career
focus on technology," he
said. "The technology in
dustry is between major
waves right now."
Monitoring the glob
al economy is also criti
cal.
"You should consider
that countries like all of
Eastern Europe, Russia,
China, India, big chunks
of Latin America as
places that, fora variety
of historical reasons,
spent 50 to 75 years dis
connected from the
world economy," said
Claude Leglise, vice
president of Intel Capi-

tal.
"What has happened [recently] is
that they have in fact joined the world
economy and the people who live there
are just like you and I. These people are
very smart. While a lot of the political
debate is focused on outsourcing, I be
lieve that's not the issue. The issue is
that these smart engineers, these smart
businesspeople will develop products
and services that will compete head on
with what we do in the United States
and Western Europe," Leglise added.
Mike Orsak, a general partner at
Worldview Technology Partners,
agrees.
"[People are) trying to figure out
how to sell into China, how to manufac
ture in China, and how to do develop
ment in China," he said. "The biggest
gold rush in the world right now is in
China. Some people will get rich, some
people won't."
He also dismisses current backlash
against globalization.
"Offshoring has been going on for
some 15 years," Orsak said. "The
change is because the number of jobs in
the US has been shrinking in the last
years, then it becomes a very politically
sensitive subject."
Carl Showalter, a general partner at
Lightspeed Venture Partners, discussed
what his firm looks for when investing in
a start-up.
"We think of it in three categories:
the team, the market, and the technolo
gy," he said. "You have to have a bright
team, a market that you can get into
without getting squashed by larger com
petitors, and technology that is sustain
able. If you have those things, we get
very interested."
Janice Roberts, managing director at
Mayfield, also felt that venture capital
ists are more visible than last year.
"I think VCs are much more active
than they have been in the past and
much more confident, assertive, aggres
sive, and thoughtful about what they
want to invest in," she said. "So, people
are very open and feeling very good.
Good VCs see this as a long-term busi
ness, which it is. We're being more
proactive [about investing]."
It is also crucial to target a proposal
for funding to the correct people.
"I would certainly suggest that you
find a way into a venture firm that's not
blasting an e-mail with a business plan,"
Roberts said. "We are all very closely
linked to Stanford and feel very strong
ly about supporting our community."
Will Snow, CEO of start-up mem
sAudio and Stanford Class of 1977, came
to the conference to get a sense of the
current business climate in the area.
Mark Martel, a MBA student at the
Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley
and Stanford Class of 1996, came to see
how a technology conference is run at
Stanford, having been to several at
Berkeley.
"I thought today was really valuable
in terms of the quality of the speakers
and the topics that were presented,"
Snow said. "There was really something
for everyone, from students to en
trepreneurs to seasoned businesspeo
ple. I thought it was a great day."

The first annual Technology Industry
Conference held at the business school
last Wednesday featured keynotes by
two legendary CEOs and dozens of pan
elist on topics ranging from globalization
to networking to technology investment.
In addition to other events, such as the
annual Cool Products Expo, the Confer
ence brings industry professionals to
campus, allowing students to interact
with venture capitalists, entrepreneurs
and executives.
The keynote speeches were given by
John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, and
Irvin Jacobs, CEO of Qualcomm. They
discussed their companies and the cur
rent economic environment as well as
sharing personal advice and experi
ence.
Jacobs told a brief history of Qual
comm, presenting critical events as deci
sions that needed to be made, such as
whether to schedule a product demon
stration before the technology was com
plete and whether to sell Qualcomm's
handset manufacturing divisions. In
both cases, they decided to proceed.

"Every one of these decisions is
somewhat different and one has to look
at both upsides and downsides to the de
cision, and what it is that's really impor
tant to you," Jacobs said. "On many of
these, you're dealing with another com
pany. I'm a great believer in trying to
work out an approach dealing with con
tracts that's fair on both sides. If it isn't,
it's not going to last very long."
