# New engineering research journal offers grants
## 
### SU FEN LEE 
Come late May, Stanford will
have a technical journal that not only
publishes student research, hut also
offers scholarships up to $750 for the
best papers.
The Stanford Electrical Engi
neering and Computer Science Re
search Journal (ECJ) is inviting sub
missions from now till April 18. It
will showcase the top and latest re
search being done at Stanford in the
electrical engineering and computer
science disciplines by both gradu
ates and undergraduates.
"There is an unmet need for
something like the ECJ. When you
talk to both undergrads and grads in
EE and CS, one common concern
most of them share is that they're un
aware of what research opportuni
ties are out there and what sort of re
search is currently being done in the
labs," said Albert Hsu. Hsu is a ju
nior in Electrical Engineering who is
leading the journal effort and is an
officer for the Stanford chapter of
the Institute for for Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (lEEE).
ECJ will also expose undergradu
ate and graduate students to the var

ious EE and CS research labs on
campus. This is especially useful to
those who are searching for research
positions. It also offers the Stanford
community an opportunity to learn
more about EE and CS research that
is currently being conducted on cam
pus.
Stanford lEEE is Stanford's stu
dent chapter of the Institute of Elec
trical and Electronics Engineers.
President Clara Shih. noticed a gap
between our current undergraduate
research journals and highly special
ized technical journals dominated by
graduate students, post-doctoral stu
dents and professors.
"Through my experience as a CS
undergraduate and now graduate
student, I know a number of individ
uals whose work falls in this gap, not
quite suitable for either realm."
"I began investigating what other
schools were doing and found that
many of our peer institutions, name
ly Berkeley and MIT, had successful
ly launched EE / CS research jour
nals in recent years," said Shih. "I
felt it was only appropriate that Stan
ford. with such a strong tradition and
emphasis on research particularly in
technical fields, should consider

doing the same."
According to Hsu, the ECJ is "an
alternative to the traditional jour
nal" because of its unique purpose
and target audience.
"The ECJ is a publication that
serves the engineering community
while avoiding the "elitist" connota
tions a journal sometimes carries,"
Hsu said. "We've made a strong ef
fort to create a context in which both
undergrads and grads can con
tribute."
"For example, we accept two
types of papers: long papers and
short papers. Long papers are 8-12
pages and can include excerpts from
longer papers submitted for other
journals. Short papers are 2-4 pages
and can be for research done by un
dergrads in programs such as
CURIS and REU and for describing
early-stage research from a broader
perspective," Hsu added.
The ECJ provides an alternative,
quicker and easier medium for un
dergraduate and graduate students
to publish their work. ECJ has a
rapid review process of about two
three weeks, unlike typical technical
journals which may range from
months to years.

Short papers, which are meant as
surveys of a particular topic for an au
dience of technical laypersons, will
be reviewed by three members of the
ECJ steering committee. Long pa
pers, such as those in more tradition
al journals, undergo more rigorous
review. After an initial screening by
the steering committee, papers are
categorized and sent off anonymous
ly to professors, local lEEE profes
sionals and post-doctorates in their
respective fields for comments and
feedback. The steering committee
will make the final publication and
scholarship selections.
Established in autumn quarter
last year, the ECJ steering commit
tee comprises undergraduates, grad
uate students and faculty. The com
mittee met almost every week to
work on the structure and content of
the publication. During winter quar
ter, the focus shifted to rallying sup
port from university faculty and ad
ministration. It also worked on
fundraising and graphic design.
One of the major challenges at the
start was the lack of overwhelming
faculty interest. "It is often said that
many Stanford professors are very
focused on their research group and

area, and have only limited interest in
peripheral student activity," Shih
said.
After persistently approaching
professors, the committee has
turned the situation around. "On
the university level, we have re
ceived tremendous support from the
EE Department Chair Bruce Woo
ley and CS Department Chair Hec
tor Garcia-Molina, invaluable publi
cation development advice from EE
Professor Butrus Khuri-Yakub, CS
Professor Terry Winograd and
EE/CS Professor Edward Mc-
Cluskey," Shih said. "We have also
had a huge show of endorsement
from Jim Plummer, the Dean of the
School of Engineering."
Dealing with fundraising was a
"relatively easier task, because Stan
ford's name carries so much weight,"
Hsu said. "Funding a large project
such as the ECJ requires tremendous
amount of money. For example, be
cause we want to create a profession
al magazine quality publication,
printing costs are well over 2.5k."
"We've had tremendous success
securing sponsors such as HP. Lock
heed Martin, as well as the local
lEEE chapter," Hsu added.

ECJ is free of charge. It will be
available both online and in print.
Physical copies of the inaugural edi
tion will be available in late May in
special racks in the Packard, Gates
and Terman buildings. They will
also be on display and kept in the col
lections of the Terman Engineering
Library.
"The inaugural edition is our ex
periment with what papers students
wish to publish and/or read. We are
trying our hardest to prepare the
best possible publication, but we ex
pect inevitably to make mistakes.
We will learn from these mistakes,
and continue to improve ECJ in the
coming years. We hope that starting
next year, ECJ will be published
twice or thrice annually," said Shih.
For Hsu, his dream is to have ECJ
debut with a bang. "When people
think of the ECJ, I want them to as
sociate the journal with prestige,
quality, and value. I think the ECJ
can eventually fill a niche at Stanford
and become a staple of the engineer
ing community."
"The ECJ has been one of the
most innovative and entrepreneurial
projects I've worked on at Stan
ford," Hsu said.

and continue to improve ECJ in the
coming years. We hope that starting
next year, ECJ will be published
twice or thrice annually," said Shih.
For Hsu, his dream is to have ECJ
debut with a bang. "When people
think of the ECJ, I want them to as
sociate the journal with prestige,
quality, and value. I think the ECJ
can eventually fill a niche at Stanford
and become a staple of the engineer
ing community."
"The ECJ has been one of the
most innovative and entrepreneurial
projects I've worked on at Stan
ford," Hsu said.
Come late May, Stanford will
have a technical journal that not only
publishes student research, hut also
offers scholarships up to $750 for the
best papers.
The Stanford Electrical Engi
neering and Computer Science Re
search Journal (ECJ) is inviting sub
missions from now till April 18. It
will showcase the top and latest re
search being done at Stanford in the
electrical engineering and computer
science disciplines by both gradu
ates and undergraduates.
"There is an unmet need for
something like the ECJ. When you
talk to both undergrads and grads in
EE and CS, one common concern
most of them share is that they're un
aware of what research opportuni
ties are out there and what sort of re
search is currently being done in the
labs," said Albert Hsu. Hsu is a ju
nior in Electrical Engineering who is
leading the journal effort and is an
officer for the Stanford chapter of
the Institute for for Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (lEEE).
ECJ will also expose undergradu
ate and graduate students to the var

ious EE and CS research labs on
campus. This is especially useful to
those who are searching for research
positions. It also offers the Stanford
community an opportunity to learn
more about EE and CS research that
is currently being conducted on cam
pus.

President Clara Shih. noticed a gap
between our current undergraduate
research journals and highly special
ized technical journals dominated by
graduate students, post-doctoral stu
dents and professors.
"Through my experience as a CS
undergraduate and now graduate
student, I know a number of individ
uals whose work falls in this gap, not
quite suitable for either realm."
"I began investigating what other
schools were doing and found that
many of our peer institutions, name
ly Berkeley and MIT, had successful
ly launched EE / CS research jour
nals in recent years," said Shih. "I
felt it was only appropriate that Stan
ford. with such a strong tradition and
emphasis on research particularly in
technical fields, should consider

doing the same."
According to Hsu, the ECJ is "an
alternative to the traditional jour
nal" because of its unique purpose
and target audience.
"The ECJ is a publication that
serves the engineering community
while avoiding the "elitist" connota
tions a journal sometimes carries,"
Hsu said. "We've made a strong ef
fort to create a context in which both
undergrads and grads can con
tribute."
"For example, we accept two
types of papers: long papers and
short papers. Long papers are 8-12
pages and can include excerpts from
longer papers submitted for other
journals. Short papers are 2-4 pages
and can be for research done by un
dergrads in programs such as
CURIS and REU and for describing
early-stage research from a broader
perspective," Hsu added.
The ECJ provides an alternative,
quicker and easier medium for un
dergraduate and graduate students
to publish their work. ECJ has a
rapid review process of about two
three weeks, unlike typical technical
journals which may range from
months to years.

Short papers, which are meant as
surveys of a particular topic for an au
dience of technical laypersons, will
be reviewed by three members of the
ECJ steering committee. Long pa
pers, such as those in more tradition
al journals, undergo more rigorous
review. After an initial screening by
the steering committee, papers are
categorized and sent off anonymous
ly to professors, local lEEE profes
sionals and post-doctorates in their
respective fields for comments and
feedback. The steering committee
will make the final publication and
scholarship selections.
Established in autumn quarter
last year, the ECJ steering commit
tee comprises undergraduates, grad
uate students and faculty. The com
mittee met almost every week to
work on the structure and content of
the publication. During winter quar
ter, the focus shifted to rallying sup
port from university faculty and ad
ministration. It also worked on
fundraising and graphic design.
One of the major challenges at the
start was the lack of overwhelming
faculty interest. "It is often said that
many Stanford professors are very
focused on their research group and

area, and have only limited interest in
peripheral student activity," Shih
said.
After persistently approaching
professors, the committee has
turned the situation around. "On
the university level, we have re
ceived tremendous support from the
EE Department Chair Bruce Woo
ley and CS Department Chair Hec
tor Garcia-Molina, invaluable publi
cation development advice from EE
Professor Butrus Khuri-Yakub, CS
Professor Terry Winograd and
EE/CS Professor Edward Mc-
Cluskey," Shih said. "We have also
had a huge show of endorsement
from Jim Plummer, the Dean of the
School of Engineering."
Dealing with fundraising was a
"relatively easier task, because Stan
ford's name carries so much weight,"
Hsu said. "Funding a large project
such as the ECJ requires tremendous
amount of money. For example, be
cause we want to create a profession
al magazine quality publication,
printing costs are well over 2.5k."
"We've had tremendous success
securing sponsors such as HP. Lock
heed Martin, as well as the local
lEEE chapter," Hsu added.

ECJ is free of charge. It will be
available both online and in print.
Physical copies of the inaugural edi
tion will be available in late May in
special racks in the Packard, Gates
and Terman buildings. They will
also be on display and kept in the col
lections of the Terman Engineering
Library.
"The inaugural edition is our ex
periment with what papers students
wish to publish and/or read. We are
trying our hardest to prepare the
best possible publication, but we ex
pect inevitably to make mistakes.
We will learn from these mistakes,
and continue to improve ECJ in the
coming years. We hope that starting
next year, ECJ will be published
twice or thrice annually," said Shih.
