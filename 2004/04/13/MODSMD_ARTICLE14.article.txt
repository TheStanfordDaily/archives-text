## University needs MEChA 
### 
The loss of MEChA's special fees repre
sents more than a loss to the organiza
tional capacity of the Movimiento Estu
diantil Chicano de Aztldn or even the
cultural vibrancy generated through MEChA's
subgroups. Unless the University community
maintains the funding of critical community
events, the loss of MEChA's special fees could
impede Stanford's fulfillment of its responsibil
ity to support and educate leaders for our di
verse society.
MEChA's special fees this year funded eight
voluntary student subgroup organizations (46
percent of the budget), seven flagship Latino
sponsored community events (41 percent) and the
operations of MEChA itself (13 percent).
MEChA subgroups rely on these funds to produce
publications and programming that are free and
available to the entire Stanford community. Also
compromised by this new lack of funds are larger
flagship events, such as the Cesar Chavez Com
memoration and Dia de los Muertos, which are
coordinated through El Centro Chicano and help
fulfill Stanford's commitment to community cele
bration and extracurricular education.
While it remains unclear to what extent the
University administration should be financially
responsible for the activities of voluntary student
organizations, the flagship Latino-sponsored
community events funded through MEChA and
other umbrella organizations present a unique
and compelling case for receiving full University
funding. The University cannot simply admit a di
verse class; it should also provide support so that
the community can experience that diversity
through the programming and everyday life at
Stanford. And these events, besides being critical
to helping Latino students make a successful
transition into Stanford, provide educational op-

portunities for all students by making racial di
versity more than just a statistical phenomenon
on paper.
Further, these flagship events are particularly
institutionalized as part of the Stanford commu
nity identity. Stanford regularly claims them in
recruitment and development materials. There is
no reason for the University to shirk financial re
sponsibility for these major and vital annual
events. Indeed, the University administration his
torically has lived up to its responsibility in those
years when these events did not receive special
fees funding. When the Latino community lost
MEChA's special fees and the Asian American
community lost the Asian American Students'
Association special fees in 1997, the University
administration agreed to provide the community
centers of those respective communities with sup
plemental funds to mitigate the debacle.
This commitment to fully funding significant
institutional events should become permanent.
As the University community moves forward to
address the blow delivered in this year's elec
tions, the administration should commit to pro
viding additional annual funding to El Centro in
the amount needed (approximately $15,000) so
that it can fully fund institutional community
events without relying on the volatile co-sponsor
ship of MEChA's special fees. As this year makes
clear, the Stanford community cannot afford for
events coordinated through El Centro to be
under-funded.
While the loss of MEChA's special fees is un
fortunate, there may be a silver lining: the impetus
for the University community to reform the fund
ing structure of institutional community events
that also include Powwow and Black Liberation
Month to ensure the continuing vitality and excel
lence of our diverse University community.
