## "Kiss Me Kate" is sexist 
### GINA BATESON 
This year, production of the Ram's
Head Theatrical Society spring musi
cal is superb. The only problem is the
show that Ram's Head has chosen.
"Kiss Me Kate" is rife with sexism, to
a degree that seriously mars an other
wise excellent production.
I saw "Kiss Me Kate" last Friday
night, and nearly every time I
laughed or applauded, I also felt my
self cringing because of the show's
demeaning treatment of women.
The decision to produce "Kiss Me
Kate" reflects poorly on Ram's
Head, in my opinion.
There are not sexist undertones
in "Kiss Me Kate;" rather, sexism is
central to the script. Female charac
ters explain how they engage in sex
ual relationships for material gain.
They exhibit hysteria. They learn
that they must submit to men in re
lationships. And most tasteless of all
are the jokes about domestic vio
lence that crop up with astounding
frequency throughout the play.
Just laugh it off, people say. It's

exaggeration; it's intended to be
over the top; it's meant to be funny.
But why should we laugh about de
meaning portrayals of women when
similar racial stereotyping and jokes
are clearly unacceptable?
Imagine if Stanford produced a
play that dealt with race the way
"Kiss Me Kate" deals with gender.
In it, a main character would sing,
"Us blacks, we're just here to serve
and obey." Slavery would be trivial
ized, physical abuse of people of
color applauded and racism con
doned. The play would conclude
with a person of color realizing that
it was his / her duty to obey whites.
Such a performance would never be
tolerated at Stanford, with good rea
son. Why is it, then, that we tolerate
sexist productions?
The best way to address this im
balance is not to become just as
racist as we are sexist. Instead, no
type of discrimination should be tol
erated, regardless of whether it is
racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-
Semitism or xenophobia.
Certainly, "Kiss Me Kate" is a

product of its time. It was written in
a sexist era, and sexism is such an
essential part of its plot that it can
not be edited out. That is precisely
why Ram's Head should not have
chosen to produce it.
There is a reason that Ram's
Head does not produce blackface
minstrel shows: They would be
hugely offensive. Are they a
product of a time? Of course. But
their time has passed. Ram's
Head's production of "Kiss Me
Kate" shows that, unfortunately,
sexism's time has not passed. It is
still alive today, even on the Stan
ford campus.
As we were leaving the theater
after "Kiss Me Kate," I raised some
of these issues with my friends. After
agreeing that a racist play would not
be accepted at Stanford, one of them
turned to me and said, "But Gina,
sexism never gets old." Clearly he
was kidding â€” or was he?
