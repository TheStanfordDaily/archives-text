Obesity should be remedied,
not ridiculed
I am writing in response to Dan
McCarthy's column ("McCarthy on
the merits of being svelte and
sporty," April 7). I was disappointed
that the article was more about Mc-
Carthy's prejudice than about com
ing up with some helpful ways to ap
proach the problem of inactivity and
poor nutrition.
If McCarthy was really concerned
about fat people's health, I think he
would have written a much different
article. Instead of filling it with his
obviously personal disgust and
ridicule of fat people, he might have
talked about constructive ways that
we could all become more active. I do
not think he is really concerned
about health, but rather is worried
about looks alone. Does McCarthy
stop and question thin people to
make sure they are adequately ac
tive? Many thin people are sedentary
as well, but happen to be "blessed"
with a faster metabolism. I know
some fat and fit people, and I know
some fat and unhealthy people. I
must say I also know some thin and
fit people and some thin and un
healthy people.
The point here is that he seemed
to reserve his column for ridiculing
fat children and fat adults, and I'm
not sure how that is supposed to help
them. I am glad that his parents were
able to offer him so many opportuni
ties to engage in sports as a child, but
what about families in poorer neigh
borhoods who can't afford AYSO
and whose local "grocery store" is
the liquor store on the corner?
I will agree with McCarthy that
we, as a culture, do need to eat less

junk food and make sure we move
our bodies. But I believe the way to
make this happen is to ensure that
nutritional food is available and af
fordable, to get the soda machines
out of schools, to make schools ac
countable for adequate P.E. periods
(many schools have significantly cut
P.E. programs, so it is not exactly
the child's choice that he / she is not
moving around much during the
school day), to give parents afford
able sports options, to encourage
less time in front of TV / video
games, etc. This plan does not in
clude ridiculing people or spreading
hate and disgust. McCarthy is an in
telligent Stanford student, so he
must know that shame is not the best
way to motivate people.
Our culture does hate and fear fat,
so it makes sense that McCarthy has
learned this. It is important, however,
to work on educating ourselves so
that we do not spread erroneous be
liefs (as well as hatred and prejudice).

Some thoughts on MEChA's failure
to receive special fees
MEChA's special fee request did
not pass, and now I worry. As a cur
rent co-chair of El Ballet Folklorico
de Stanford, I am now forced to con
front the fact that our group will be
under-funded next year. Our group
performs traditional Mexican dance
for any group that asks, both on
campus and off. We try to teach peo
ple a little bit about our culture.
Now our dance concerts are under
threat. We can't afford to rent any
auditoriums for next year. We've

lost our costume maintenance bud
get. We've lost most of our budget,
period. Unfortunately, El Ballet
Folklorico shares this fate, as well as
the accompanying disappointment
and frustration, with several other
Latino organizations that fall under
the umbrella of MEChA.
Aside from the daunting financial
situation, my greatest concern is
over how such a thing could happen.
After listening to the dismay of the
Latino community, I feel that the
student body here at Stanford sim
ply does not know that MEChA
provides funding to a multitude of
programs and organizations. I can't
even name them all, but I can say
that next year's Di'a de los Muertos,
Floricanto and Posadas are now
under fiscal strain. These are pro
grams open to the entire Stanford
community: Everyone is welcome to
come to them, everyone is welcome
to enjoy them.
Has the Latino community here at
Stanford failed to campaign suffi
ciently for itself? Or is our loss of
funding the result of the student
body's apathy toward the Latino
community and culture? I hope that
it is the former and not the latter.
We cannot change the results of
the special fees election. The Latino
community will not receive the
money it needs, but I do not blame
anyone for it. I hope, however, that
the student body and University ad
ministration will show their support
for the Latino community here on
campus as we try to face the tremen
dous challenge of losing our special
fee funding. That's all I ask.

de Stanford, I am now forced to con
front the fact that our group will be
under-funded next year. Our group
performs traditional Mexican dance
for any group that asks, both on
campus and off. We try to teach peo
ple a little bit about our culture.
Now our dance concerts are under
threat. We can't afford to rent any
auditoriums for next year. We've

lost our costume maintenance bud
get. We've lost most of our budget,
period. Unfortunately, El Ballet
Folklorico shares this fate, as well as
the accompanying disappointment
and frustration, with several other
Latino organizations that fall under
the umbrella of MEChA.
Aside from the daunting financial
situation, my greatest concern is
over how such a thing could happen.
After listening to the dismay of the
Latino community, I feel that the
student body here at Stanford sim
ply does not know that MEChA
provides funding to a multitude of
programs and organizations. I can't
even name them all, but I can say
that next year's Di'a de los Muertos,
Floricanto and Posadas are now
under fiscal strain. These are pro
grams open to the entire Stanford
community: Everyone is welcome to
come to them, everyone is welcome
to enjoy them.
Has the Latino community here at
Stanford failed to campaign suffi
ciently for itself? Or is our loss of
funding the result of the student
body's apathy toward the Latino
community and culture? I hope that
it is the former and not the latter.
We cannot change the results of
the special fees election. The Latino
community will not receive the
money it needs, but I do not blame
anyone for it. I hope, however, that
the student body and University ad
ministration will show their support
for the Latino community here on
campus as we try to face the tremen
dous challenge of losing our special
fee funding. That's all I ask.

Obesity should be remedied,
not ridiculed
I am writing in response to Dan
McCarthy's column ("McCarthy on
the merits of being svelte and
sporty," April 7). I was disappointed
that the article was more about Mc-
Carthy's prejudice than about com
ing up with some helpful ways to ap
proach the problem of inactivity and
poor nutrition.
If McCarthy was really concerned
about fat people's health, I think he
would have written a much different
article. Instead of filling it with his
obviously personal disgust and
ridicule of fat people, he might have
talked about constructive ways that
we could all become more active. I do
not think he is really concerned
about health, but rather is worried
about looks alone. Does McCarthy
stop and question thin people to
make sure they are adequately ac
tive? Many thin people are sedentary
as well, but happen to be "blessed"
with a faster metabolism. I know
some fat and fit people, and I know
some fat and unhealthy people. I
must say I also know some thin and
fit people and some thin and un
healthy people.
The point here is that he seemed
to reserve his column for ridiculing
fat children and fat adults, and I'm
not sure how that is supposed to help
them. I am glad that his parents were
able to offer him so many opportuni
ties to engage in sports as a child, but
what about families in poorer neigh
borhoods who can't afford AYSO
and whose local "grocery store" is
the liquor store on the corner?
I will agree with McCarthy that
we, as a culture, do need to eat less

junk food and make sure we move
our bodies. But I believe the way to
make this happen is to ensure that
nutritional food is available and af
fordable, to get the soda machines
out of schools, to make schools ac
countable for adequate P.E. periods
(many schools have significantly cut
P.E. programs, so it is not exactly
the child's choice that he / she is not
moving around much during the
school day), to give parents afford
able sports options, to encourage
less time in front of TV / video
games, etc. This plan does not in
clude ridiculing people or spreading
hate and disgust. McCarthy is an in
telligent Stanford student, so he
must know that shame is not the best
way to motivate people.
Our culture does hate and fear fat,
so it makes sense that McCarthy has
learned this. It is important, however,
to work on educating ourselves so
that we do not spread erroneous be
liefs (as well as hatred and prejudice).

Some thoughts on MEChA's failure
to receive special fees
MEChA's special fee request did
not pass, and now I worry. As a cur
rent co-chair of El Ballet Folklorico
de Stanford, I am now forced to con
front the fact that our group will be
under-funded next year. Our group
