## IM soccer season offers plenty of drama 
### 
And they called him El Gato. As we
stumbled out of our caravan of Volvos
early one autumn morning, we were
first drawn to the opposing team's
goalkeeper. An obscenely overweight Hispanic
man with a handlebar mustache. El Gato sym
bolized everything beautiful about Men's
League Soccer.
Now some may say that El Gato wasn't
"athletic," didn't "possess skills" and "began
drinking at halftime," but that is all tangential
to the point.
The point is — absent all this special fees
nonsense, absent any connections to Arrilla
ga and absent any fans — the students on the
Stanford club soccer team grind out victories
each week against El Gato y sus amigos for
the dual satisfaction of hanging onto their
soccer careers for one more Sunday and
preparing for the greatest season of their
lives: the Division I intramural soccer season.

Just ask Ben Huston.
A junior who transferred into
Toyon Hall (Toyacht Club —
"Good Times on Boats!" . . .
worst . . . theme . . . ever) last
year from Arizona, Ben Huston
is a born goal-scorer who could
have played Division I soccer
had the opportunity presented
itself. He is a powerful central
midfielder, able to distribute,

hold the hall and strike it as well. And watch out,
he just bought new cleats. Ask him and he'll he
sure to point out that, "They're Hummels!"
He rides a "Scoo-bug" (a motorized scooter),
says "chall" instead of "chill" and is a sucker for
sappy romantic comedies. (Aren't we all? I mean
... I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, ask
ing him to love her! ... I love that movie.) But
man, the kid can kick a ball.
It's tough to find a defining moment for IM
soccer. It's more of a random assortment of
stupid stories — the constant swearing on the
field, 10-0 blowouts against freshman dorms
and lights with Argentinean grad students.
But perhaps that defining moment came last
Sunday, as I passed by the Sand Hill IM fields.
The two teams that account for most of the
non-varsity soccer talent on this campus — the
club team and Andrew So's intramural team —
were playing. So's team, also known as "Tor
nado-ology" and "Fools from different
dorms," won the Division I intramural champi
onship last year and is vying for the title again
this year.
They have to be considered the odds-on fa
vorites, accounting for most of the upperclass
talent on campus. The club team, while it
boasts a deep roster, is inexperienced, relying
on underclassmen to get revenge for its first
round defeat last year to my Kappa Sig team.
The other contenders are Kappa Alpha, which
will have the services of Huston, and a myste
rious Argentinean grad-school team, which ab
solutely nobody likes.
In fact, it's the infighting among this
crowd that makes for the best stories. For in
stance, Ben is reneging on both the club team
and Andrew So's team to play for KA, main
taining his allegiance to his fraternity. Ben,
who IM Coordinator Ellen Crishalm claims
is the best center midfielder not playing var
sity, is a highly sought-after commodity, and
many are mad, nay, pissed, that he is not
playing for them.
But as Ben would say in response to this con
troversy, "Don't worry about it. It's chall."
The one drawback about IM soccer, if there
is one (read: there are many), is that the ski 11-
to-physicality ratio is wayyy out of whack. To
be honest, most of the teams are just not very
good, and find that their only recourse is trash
talking, fouling and fighting. We have all been
guilty of this.
Ben once went up to a 40-year old in a club
soccer game and after 90 minutes of trash talk
ing concluded (very loudly), "You are the
worst soccer player I've ever seen in my life!"
A fight ensued.
Senior Jonas Roddenberry, 30 seconds after
substituting into a quarterfinal IM game, was
fouled and proceeded to kick the Argentinean
fouler, who was still lying on the ground. A
fight ensued.
Are we noticing a trend?
In their desperate quest for one more title
before they hang up the Zoom Airs, Copas and
Hummels, Ben, Jonas, Andrew and a whole
slew of other weekend warriors battle on the
Sand Hill IM fields.
Who will Ben ultimately play for? Who will
Jonas fight next? Who can't score on a drunk,
overweight, mustachioed goalkeeper? Who
will win the title?
These are all good questions. And they will
all be answered in eight short weeks. Only time
— and El Gato — will tell.

Spencer Porter remains a walk-on goalkeeper
on the men's varsity soccer team. But can he
really compete with El Gato? Send him correo
electronico at porters@stanford.edu to ask
him yourself.

It's tough to find a defining moment for IM
soccer. It's more of a random assortment of
stupid stories — the constant swearing on the
field, 10-0 blowouts against freshman dorms
and lights with Argentinean grad students.
But perhaps that defining moment came last
Sunday, as I passed by the Sand Hill IM fields.
The two teams that account for most of the
non-varsity soccer talent on this campus — the
club team and Andrew So's intramural team —
were playing. So's team, also known as "Tor
nado-ology" and "Fools from different
dorms," won the Division I intramural champi
onship last year and is vying for the title again
this year.
They have to be considered the odds-on fa
vorites, accounting for most of the upperclass
talent on campus. The club team, while it
boasts a deep roster, is inexperienced, relying
on underclassmen to get revenge for its first
round defeat last year to my Kappa Sig team.
The other contenders are Kappa Alpha, which
will have the services of Huston, and a myste
rious Argentinean grad-school team, which ab
solutely nobody likes.
In fact, it's the infighting among this
crowd that makes for the best stories. For in
stance, Ben is reneging on both the club team
and Andrew So's team to play for KA, main
taining his allegiance to his fraternity. Ben,
who IM Coordinator Ellen Crishalm claims
is the best center midfielder not playing var
sity, is a highly sought-after commodity, and
many are mad, nay, pissed, that he is not
playing for them.
But as Ben would say in response to this con
troversy, "Don't worry about it. It's chall."
The one drawback about IM soccer, if there
is one (read: there are many), is that the ski 11-
to-physicality ratio is wayyy out of whack. To
be honest, most of the teams are just not very
good, and find that their only recourse is trash
talking, fouling and fighting. We have all been
guilty of this.
Ben once went up to a 40-year old in a club
soccer game and after 90 minutes of trash talk
ing concluded (very loudly), "You are the
worst soccer player I've ever seen in my life!"
A fight ensued.
Senior Jonas Roddenberry, 30 seconds after
substituting into a quarterfinal IM game, was
fouled and proceeded to kick the Argentinean
fouler, who was still lying on the ground. A
fight ensued.
Are we noticing a trend?
In their desperate quest for one more title
before they hang up the Zoom Airs, Copas and
Hummels, Ben, Jonas, Andrew and a whole
slew of other weekend warriors battle on the
Sand Hill IM fields.
Who will Ben ultimately play for? Who will
Jonas fight next? Who can't score on a drunk,
overweight, mustachioed goalkeeper? Who
will win the title?
These are all good questions. And they will
all be answered in eight short weeks. Only time
— and El Gato — will tell.

Spencer Porter remains a walk-on goalkeeper
on the men's varsity soccer team. But can he
really compete with El Gato? Send him correo
electronico at porters@stanford.edu to ask
him yourself.


Spencer Porter
And they called him El Gato. As we
stumbled out of our caravan of Volvos
early one autumn morning, we were
first drawn to the opposing team's
goalkeeper. An obscenely overweight Hispanic
man with a handlebar mustache. El Gato sym
bolized everything beautiful about Men's
League Soccer.
Now some may say that El Gato wasn't
"athletic," didn't "possess skills" and "began
drinking at halftime," but that is all tangential
to the point.
The point is — absent all this special fees
nonsense, absent any connections to Arrilla
ga and absent any fans — the students on the
Stanford club soccer team grind out victories
each week against El Gato y sus amigos for
the dual satisfaction of hanging onto their
soccer careers for one more Sunday and
preparing for the greatest season of their
lives: the Division I intramural soccer season.

Just ask Ben Huston.
A junior who transferred into
Toyon Hall (Toyacht Club —
"Good Times on Boats!" . . .
worst . . . theme . . . ever) last
year from Arizona, Ben Huston
is a born goal-scorer who could
have played Division I soccer
had the opportunity presented
itself. He is a powerful central
midfielder, able to distribute,

hold the hall and strike it as well. And watch out,
he just bought new cleats. Ask him and he'll he
sure to point out that, "They're Hummels!"
He rides a "Scoo-bug" (a motorized scooter),
says "chall" instead of "chill" and is a sucker for
sappy romantic comedies. (Aren't we all? I mean
... I'm just a girl, standing in front of a boy, ask
ing him to love her! ... I love that movie.) But
man, the kid can kick a ball.
