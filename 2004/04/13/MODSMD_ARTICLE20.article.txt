# Card returns home to face Broncos
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Off to its fourth-best start in school history, outscoring
opponents 271 -134 and winning 13 straight series, the sec
ond-ranked Stanford baseball team hasn't much cared
whom, when or where it has played this season.
Still, it's good to be home.
After wrapping up a seven-game road swing by taking
two of three from Oregon State in Corvallis last weekend,
the Cardinal (25-4, 4-2 Pacific-10 Conference) opens a
seven-game homestand tonight against Santa Clara (16-
19,5-7 West Coast Conference) at Sunken Diamond.
Stanford will play 10 of its next 12 games under the
Palo Alto sun, including a three-game series against Cal
ifornia this weekend, coming off a similar stretch that saw
the Cardinal play 14 of 17 games on the road.
"I was pleased with [the road swing)," said head coach
Mark Marquess. "It was a tough spot the way the sched
ule broke. We didn't play so well in some areas, but we
found a way to win in those games we didn't play ex
tremely well."
The early Pac-10 leader has also found a way to win at
home, which has been extra sweet to Stanford this year.
The Cardinal is 11-1 at Sunken Diamond, with its only
I6ss coming to then-No. 6 Texas on March 29, and has
won 20 of its last 21 games at home overall dating back to
last year.
Despite its recent winning ways, the team knows that
white jerseys and familiar faces in the stands do not put
runs on the scoreboard or wins in the book.
"It's always better to play at home, but the thing is,
you still have to play well," Marquess said. "That's the mis
conception, and I don't think we'll fall into it, that just be
cause you come home you're going to play great and win."
Stanford need only look back to last year for proof of
that, when Marquess's squad surprisingly had a better
record on the road (17-5) than at home (29-10). The Car
dinal's penultimate home loss of the 2003 campaign was
a particularly tough one to swallow, as Santa Clara
blanked Stanford 2-0 on a chilly Tuesday night before a
sparse crowd.
Stanford managed just four hits in that game — all
after the sixth inning — and squandered several scoring
chances as a result of eight free passes. It was the only
time the Cardinal was shut out all season.
"It just points out that, even if you're playing at
home, there's so much parity in college baseball [that]
anybody is capable of beating another team depending
on how you play," said Marquess, who called the loss
"an embarrassment."
But it has been Stanford leaving opponents red in the
face more often than not since then, including a little pay
back against Santa Clara earlier this season.
Stanford roughed up the Broncos for 18 runs — in

eluding nine in the third inning — in an 18-4 blowout at
Buck Shaw Stadium on March 24.
Sophomore shortstop Jed Lowrie scored four runs and
hit two of his team-high tying nine home runs in that game
and junior designated hitter Chris Carter, who had a big
weekend at Oregon State, added a three-run homer for
the Cardinal.
"That was just one of those games when everything
went well our way," Marquess said. "(Santa Clara is] very
good and they play very well against us here."
Indeed, while the Cardinal has won 25 of the last 27
meetings against its South Bay neighbors, three of the last
four games at Sunken Diamond have been decided by
two runs or less.
Santa Clara, led by third-year head coach and for

mer Stanford assistant Mark O'Brien, has hovered
around .500 all season after challenging for the confer
ence crown last year. The Broncos have struggled to fill
some of the gaps left by eight departed seniors and
enter tonight's game losers of four straight after a three
game sweep at the hands of conference foe San Diego
last weekend.
The Broncos' pitching staff, minus two regular starters
from last year's team, comes into tonight's game with a
5.97 ERA. O'Brien used seven pitchers against Stanford
in the last meeting, six of whom gave up at least one run.
Whoever takes the mound tonight must contend with a
potent and balanced Stanford lineup that seems to have
