## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's sprint squad
continued to show signs that it is one of the
emerging powerhouses in the nation at the
Brutus Hamilton Invitational at Berkeley
last weekend.
Six Stanford sprinters filled the starting
blocks in lanes two through seven to start
the first and fastest heat of the 400-meter
dash. The group of Cardinal sprinters
opened strong and finished hard, as sopho
more Nashonme Johnson led a top-five
sweep of the heat and the event at Cal's Ed
wards Stadium.
Johnson's time of 53.59 seconds is the
second-fastest in school history, less than
0.4 seconds off the school record.
Freshman Ashley Freeman, who fin
ished second in 54.36, broke her own fresh
man record â€” set two weeks ago at the
Stanford Invitational.
Both women, along with sophomore
Chinny Offor, who finished third in 54.43,
qualified for the Regional Championships
in May. Freshman Keisha Gaines and ju
nior Christine Moschella finished fourth
and fifth, respectively.
"The women's 400 was probably the
highlight of the weekend," said women's
head coach Edrick Floreal. "It's difficult
[to pick one highlight] because there were
so many great performances, but that was
definitely a great event for us."
The sprint squad also found success in
several other events as well, including a
win by freshman Ashley Purnell in the 100
and runner-up finishes by freshman Janice
Davis in the 200 and senior Lindsey John
son in the 100-meter hurdles. Purnell also
finished fifth in the 200 with a season-best
time of 24.99.
The Cardinal's success at the event was
not confined to the sprinting events, however.
Senior Leila Ben-Youssef cleared a
season-best 12 feet, 8.75 inches to win the
pole vault competition, while freshman
Ari Lambie ran the 800 in 2:08.06 to finish
as the top collegian and third overall in
the event.
In the second heat of the women's
1,500, freshman Julie Allen used a strong
kick in the last lap to overtake Diljeet Men
doza of the Nike Farm Team, running a
strong 4:39.85 to win the race.
For the Cardinal men, junior Nick
Sebes provided the two best showings. His

21.44 in the 200 was not only good enough
for second but qualified him for the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference Championships as well.
In the 400, Sebes pushed Cal freshman
Darren Woods to the line but fell just short
of first, running 47.03 to Woods' winning
time of 46.99. Sebes' time qualifies him for
the Regional Championships in May. Ju
nior Curtis Goehring finished fourth in the
event in a season-best 47.55, qualifying him
for the Pac-10 Championships.
In the triple jump, freshman Feranmi
Okanlami jumped 47-1.50 to finish a strong
third, while sophomore Solomon Welch
claimed sixth in the long jump with a leap
of 22-0.25.
Freshman Joaquin Chapa ran a solid
1:51.13 in the 800 to post a Pac-10 qualify
ing time and finish seventh in the event. In
the mile, sophomore Ryan Hall ran strong
for three laps but faded late to finish sev
enth in 4:09.37.
"Overall, I was very pleased with the
weekend,"' said Floreal, who coaches the
jumpers and sprinters. "We didn't taper
for this weekend, and a lot of people were
working on off-events. So, the results, I
think, are very good overall."
The Cardinal also sent athletes to the
Rafer Johnson/Jackie Joyner-Kersee In
vitational at UCLA.
Senior Jillian Camarena finished as the
top collegian in the women's shot put with
a throw of 55-10.50, edging out UCLA
rival Jessica Crosby, who threw 55-8.25.
Junior Erin Merriman threw the
javelin a season-best 150-2 to claim first in
the competition.
In the women's hammer, sophomore
Sarah Hopping got off a throw of 186-6 to
take fourth in a very talented field that in
cluded UCLA's Cari Soong, one of the
NCAA's top hammer throwers.
On the men's side, sophomore Will
O'Neill finished fifth in the discus with a
throw of 155-9, while sophomore Bryan
Kelley finished sixth in the javelin with a
toss of 172-6.
The Cardinal will now prepare to face
its toughest test of the year at the Mt. San
Antonio College Relays from April 16-18.
The event should serve as the debut for
many of Stanford's top distance runners.
The entire team will be seeking even more
qualifying times for the Pac-10 and NCAA
Regionals, as well as greater national
recognition with the track season begin
ning to really heat up.
