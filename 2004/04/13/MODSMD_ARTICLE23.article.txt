# Volleyball holds off USC for crucial MPSF victory
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team (9-16,5-
14 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) may
have split victories last weekend, but it certain
ly came away with the necessary win and pro
vided plenty of unusual entertainment along
the way.
In addition to the top-notch volleyball on
display in a 3-0 loss to No. 4 Pepperdine (16-7,
12-7) and a thrilling five-game victory over No.
15 Southern California (6-21, 4-15), the week
end featured kicked balls, yellow cards and
ejected ball-boys.
Pepperdine's win was closer than the 3-0
sweep suggests, though the Waves did take
game one convincingly. Buoyed by the play of
senior outside hitter Fred Winters and junior
outside hitter Sean Rooney, Pepperdine over
came an early 7-4 deficit to take game one, 30-
20. The All-American duo's play in game one
was indicative of the kind of hard-hitting of
fense Stanford would have to face for the rest of
the night.
"We just didn't have an answer to Winters or
Rooney," said Stanford head coach Don Shaw.
"Whenever we took one out of the offense, the
other one carried the load for them."
By the end of the night, Rooney had record
ed a match-high 19 kills and Winters had swung
for 15.
In game two. Winters finished off a 12-4
Pepperdine run with back-to-back aces, but
was answered by a Cardinal 12-5 run that tied
the score at 25. Stanford fought for points but
again couldn't handle Winters, who posted two
consecutive kills to give the Waves a 28-27 lead.
Pepperdine would go on to win, 30-28.
Shaw was impressed with his team's play in
games two and three, despite the fact that a se
ries of ties and slim margins ultimately ended in
the Waves' favor. Fittingly, a kill by Rooney
ended the match. 30-27.
"We played fairly competitively," Shaw
said. "At least in games two and three."
But the real competition happened Saturday
night, when Stanford battled back and forth
with USC in a grueling five-game decision.
"It was a really gutsy performance, to be
cliche," Shaw said.
Stanford would ultimately take a match
that seemed open for the Trojans, who
jumped out to an 18-12 lead after exchanging
points early in game one. Sophomore outside
hitter Nick Manov added six kills and junior
outside hitter Pat Bomhack chipped in five,
but it wasn't enough to counter USC's .500
hitting percentage. The Trojans took game

one, 30-21.
But Stanford wasn't intimidated.
"We didn't give up and we just kept bat
tling," Shaw said.
Game two featured a constant exchange of
points and ties. Neither team led by more than
one point until a Cardinal hitting error gave the
Trojans a 19-17 advantage. But Stanford rallied
and, after a block by sophomore middle hitter
Chris Ahlfeldt, took a 22-19 lead. Stanford's
confidence soared after that and the Cardinal
seemed to let nothing hit the floor, going on to
win, 30-25.
But in game three, USC posted a comeback
and a 20-16 lead. In spite of sophomore outside
hitter Ben Reddy's performance off the bench
for six kills and the Trojans' three failed at
tempts on match point, USC finally closed out
the game, 33-31.
"Most teams can lose a lot of momentum
from losing a game like that," Shaw said.
Stanford did not, and went into game four
with a new set up.
"We changed a couple of things up with our
rotations in game four," Shaw explained.
"That gave us a better match-up situation
against them."
Players like Bomhack, who came off the
bench to give the Cardinal a kill, three consec
utive blocks and a 23-15 lead, were essential in
the game-four win. Specifically, Shaw men
tioned that Bomhack, Reddy and sophomore
libero Jeremy Jacobs came in to make key con
tributions in the match.
"They came off the bench and really provid
ed us with good volleyball," Shaw said.
Stanford took game four, 30-22.
The Trojans threatened to take the decisive
fifth game early on, maintaining the lead until
junior middle hitter Craig Buell posted a kill for
the first Stanford advantage at 10-9. The teams
would tie at 12, but a Trojan hitting error and
kills by Reddy and Bomhack ended the game
and match at 15-13.
Shaw was pleased with his team's tenacity
given the up-and-down nature of the match and
its importance in deciding playoff spots.
"For us to be able to come back like that was
nice to see," Shaw said. "Especially in a big
game that we needed to win."
Stanford's next target is Pacific. The Cardi
nal will travel to Stockton to take on the Tigers
on Wednesday before returning to Burnham to
face them on Saturday.
"It was a good way to finish the weekend
and now we've got to move on and focus on
UOP," Shaw said. "That's just as big. We've
got to win at least one of those matches to get
into the playoffs."
