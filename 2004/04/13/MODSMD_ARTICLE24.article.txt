# Palmer's magic will endure
## 
### 
It was on a walk over to my
friend's house just down a twist in
the road that I first met Arnold
Palmer. It was a lazy, late sum
mer afternoon, crickets were trading
chirps and warm sunrays sprayed per
fectly onto the road through vibrantly
green pines and elms in a way that so
lidifies into memory all the most spe
cial childhood experiences.
1 took the right turn into my friend's
driveway and shuffled barefoot through
crunchy grass around the house to the
backyard where the swingset and my
buddy were always supposed to be wait
ing. There stood not a boy, but a white
haired man, neatly dressed in a
turquoise polo tucked just enough into
light khaki slacks to give a glimpse of
leathery brown belt. I watched as,
hunched over a golf club, he chipped
balls into the hazy air to the tune of the
june bugs and his own faint whistle. I

stood there as he
slowly looked up at
me from under the
shade of the border
ing woods, and I
somehow recognized
this man from some
place I couldn't re
member.
Now it's funny, the
things you remember.

My gramma once told
me that we don't remember most things
about people, but we remember how
they made us feel. I don't remember why
I decided to stroll up the street, I don't
remember the address my neighbor
lived at and I don't remember what
Arnold Palmer said as he looked up at
me. But I will never forget how he
brought a shy grin to my face by shooting
me a soft, genuine smile, the way his boy
ish blue eyes, creased about the edges, lit
up as though he'd been waiting an hour
for me to show up to play.
Despite rainy conditions at Augusta
far from that sun filled, twilight day now
thirteen years ago, that same warm feel
ing filled my chest, that same shy grin
spread across my face this past weekend
watching Arnold Palmer play in his 50th
and final Masters.
At age 74, Palmer was still teeing it up
out there and turning in a first round 84
I could only hope to shoot on the local
rec course before I reach his age. And
Arnie could not have belonged more.
The character and class that radiates
from the shade-strewn fairways, bubbly
greens and fine-combed bunkers at Au
gust identifies with the Palmer charisma
that has drawn and maintained a dedi
cated and growing following over the
past half-century.
During Palmer's career, golf has
witnessed two women qualify for and
play in PGA events and a 13-year old
amateur girl nearly make the cut in an
other. Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus
have both won over 30 events apiece.
A 17-year old earned his tour card.
One-woods have become metal
drivers, metal drivers have become
oversized mallets and oversized mal
lets have become space-age metal war
clubs. Putters have changed shape and
length too many times to count. The
number of golf ball brands has more
than quadrupled.
Palmer's teed it up with the likes of
Ben Hogan, Nicklaus, Chi Chi Ro
driguez, Lee Trevino, Tom Kite, Lee
Janzen, Curtis Strange and Woods.
Even though he hasn't won a Masters in
over 30 years and hasn't won a major
since 1964, Palmer still walks up each
fairway with that same magically soft
smile and those same eyes, curious, cap
tivating and appreciative of his talents
and those who follow him.
But that's exactly what has drawn
people generations apart to him, from
fans who've been with him from the
beginning to eight-year olds who
bumped into him on the way to a game
of hide and seek. Arnold could have
gone a career without winning a single
tournament and still maintained his
fan base, and that's what has made him
even more special than any tourna
ment winner or champion in any sport.
But he won anyway. That kind of pro
fessional athlete doesn't come around
too often.
The leaves change, the seasons
change, time passes, legends grow, icons
are replaced; the guard must change. My
neighbor, whose dad happened to be
Arnold Palmer's financial manager,
moved away and the house was sold.
When 1 last went home over break, a
new house had been built over the lawn
on which I had a brief meeting with one
of the greatest golfers of all time. People
will always talk about the Skins and
Masters that Palmer won, the epic
matchups he played in.the enormity and
duration of his career. But what has
withstood time, despite all the fame and
success on Palmer's final walk up the
18th fairway last Friday, is the passion
glowing in every smile, the undying spir
it in his eyes and the man's simple ability
to make people happy.

Despite rainy conditions at Augusta
far from that sun filled, twilight day now
thirteen years ago, that same warm feel
ing filled my chest, that same shy grin
spread across my face this past weekend
watching Arnold Palmer play in his 50th
and final Masters.
At age 74, Palmer was still teeing it up
out there and turning in a first round 84
I could only hope to shoot on the local
rec course before I reach his age. And
Arnie could not have belonged more.
The character and class that radiates
from the shade-strewn fairways, bubbly
greens and fine-combed bunkers at Au
gust identifies with the Palmer charisma
that has drawn and maintained a dedi
cated and growing following over the
past half-century.
During Palmer's career, golf has
witnessed two women qualify for and
play in PGA events and a 13-year old
amateur girl nearly make the cut in an
other. Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus
have both won over 30 events apiece.
A 17-year old earned his tour card.
One-woods have become metal
drivers, metal drivers have become
oversized mallets and oversized mal
lets have become space-age metal war
clubs. Putters have changed shape and
length too many times to count. The
number of golf ball brands has more
than quadrupled.
Palmer's teed it up with the likes of
Ben Hogan, Nicklaus, Chi Chi Ro
driguez, Lee Trevino, Tom Kite, Lee
Janzen, Curtis Strange and Woods.
Even though he hasn't won a Masters in
over 30 years and hasn't won a major
since 1964, Palmer still walks up each
fairway with that same magically soft
smile and those same eyes, curious, cap
tivating and appreciative of his talents
and those who follow him.
But that's exactly what has drawn
people generations apart to him, from
fans who've been with him from the
beginning to eight-year olds who
bumped into him on the way to a game
of hide and seek. Arnold could have
gone a career without winning a single
tournament and still maintained his
fan base, and that's what has made him
even more special than any tourna
ment winner or champion in any sport.
But he won anyway. That kind of pro
fessional athlete doesn't come around
too often.
The leaves change, the seasons
change, time passes, legends grow, icons
are replaced; the guard must change. My
neighbor, whose dad happened to be
Arnold Palmer's financial manager,
moved away and the house was sold.
When 1 last went home over break, a
new house had been built over the lawn
on which I had a brief meeting with one
of the greatest golfers of all time. People
will always talk about the Skins and
Masters that Palmer won, the epic
matchups he played in.the enormity and
duration of his career. But what has
withstood time, despite all the fame and
success on Palmer's final walk up the
18th fairway last Friday, is the passion
glowing in every smile, the undying spir
it in his eyes and the man's simple ability
to make people happy.

It was on a walk over to my
friend's house just down a twist in
the road that I first met Arnold
Palmer. It was a lazy, late sum
mer afternoon, crickets were trading
chirps and warm sunrays sprayed per
fectly onto the road through vibrantly
green pines and elms in a way that so
lidifies into memory all the most spe
cial childhood experiences.
1 took the right turn into my friend's
driveway and shuffled barefoot through
crunchy grass around the house to the
backyard where the swingset and my
buddy were always supposed to be wait
ing. There stood not a boy, but a white
haired man, neatly dressed in a
turquoise polo tucked just enough into
light khaki slacks to give a glimpse of
leathery brown belt. I watched as,
hunched over a golf club, he chipped
balls into the hazy air to the tune of the
june bugs and his own faint whistle. I

stood there as he
slowly looked up at
me from under the
shade of the border
ing woods, and I
somehow recognized
this man from some
place I couldn't re
member.
Now it's funny, the
things you remember.

My gramma once told
me that we don't remember most things
about people, but we remember how
they made us feel. I don't remember why
I decided to stroll up the street, I don't
remember the address my neighbor
lived at and I don't remember what
Arnold Palmer said as he looked up at
me. But I will never forget how he
brought a shy grin to my face by shooting
me a soft, genuine smile, the way his boy
ish blue eyes, creased about the edges, lit
up as though he'd been waiting an hour
for me to show up to play.
