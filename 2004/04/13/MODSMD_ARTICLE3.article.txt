### RAGHAV THAPAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Carol Moseley Braun — the
United States' first female
African-American senator and a
former candidate for the 2004 De
mocratic presidential nomination
— will discuss her experiences in
government and public service
tonight in Kresge Auditorium as
Stanford's 2004 Big Speaker event.
Braun's talk is sponsored by
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and
Stanford in Government (SIG).
ASSU Speaker's Bureau Di
rector Vinita Kailasanath said
that as someone with name recog
nition who had never been to
campus before Moseley Braun
was an ideal selection for their
speaker series.
"She has a unique perspec
tive on the upcoming presiden
tial election having been a can
didate," Kailasanath said.
"She's blazed trails as the first
African-American female in the
Senate, and she is a remarkable
voice for democracy."
Generally, SIG tries to
cosponsor at least one event with
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau
each year.
"We chose Carol Moseley
Braun because of her experience
and commitment to public ser
vice throughout her very impres
sive career," said Stanford in
Government Chair Nina Bilimo
ria, a senior.
Moseley Braun is also the first
female senator from Illinois and
the first Democratic African-
American Senator. During her
time in Senate, she has served on
the Judiciary, Finance and Bank
ing Committees.
She built her political agenda
around improving America's edu
cation system, preventing discrim
ination based on race, gender or
sexual orientation, promoting re
productive rights and providing
social and economic justice.
Although narrowly defeated

in her re-election campaign for
Senate in 1998, that same year
Moseley Braun was appointed by
President Bill Clinton as a con
sultant to the Department of Ed
ucation on school construction.
She was then appointed and ap
proved as the US ambassador to
New Zealand.
After her stint as an ambas
sador, she returned to the United
States to start her own consulting
business and to teach law and po
litical science at Morris Brown
College and DePaul University in

Chicago.
Moseley
Braun re
ceived her
bachelor of
arts degree
from the
University
of Chicago-
Illinois and
her law de
gree from
the Uni
versity of
Chicago.

The format of Moseley
Braun's speech will be similar to
that of Janet Reno, last year's Big
Speaker. She will first deliver a
30-45 minute speech, followed by
a 30-40 minute question and an
swer session.
Although Moseley Braun's
agenda for the night is not
known, Bilimoria speculated that
the former senator will address
issues that are pertinent and fa
miliar to her.
"I suspect that she will have
much -to say regarding the 2004
presidential election. She will
have profound insight, since she
was in the running for the Demor
atic nomination," Bilimoria said.
"I also suspect that education pol
icy will be touched upon, as she
has been committed her entire life
to improving schools."
The event tonight is also
cosponsored by the Black Com
munity Service Center and Delta
Sigma Theta Sorority.
