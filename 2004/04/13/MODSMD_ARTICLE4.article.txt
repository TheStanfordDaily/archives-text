## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
The family of T.V. Soong, foreign min
ister of China during World War 11, has
decided to fully open its historical papers
for research in the Hoover Archives on
April 26. Two thousand additional docu
ments will be added to the already exist
ing 58 boxes of Soong research material.
According to Director of Hoover Li
brary and Archives Elena Danielson,
Soong was listed by Forbes as one of the
richest people of the last 2,000 years, but
many believed that his wealth came
through illegal government connections.
She said that his family is now releas
ing private financial information in order
to dispel exaggerations of his wealth and
accusations of corruption. Research ma
terials rarely contain financial informa
tion, but the Soong family is choosing

transparency in order to clear T.V.
Soong's name.
"T.V. Soong had a reputation for being
very honest during the war but afterwards
people exaggerated his wealth and accused
him of being corrupt, but the new docu
ments prove the money is his own and not
the Bank of China's," Danielson said.
According to Danielson, Soong was
only a millionaire, not a billionaire, and
that he got his money through legitimate
businesses.
Aside from personal finances, the
Soong collection has important informa
tion about the Chinese war effort during
World War 11.
"The documents will release highly
classified information on the inner work
ings of the Sino-American relations to de
feat the Japanese in World War II,"
Danielson said.
Soong was born on December 4, 1894

and died on April 25, 1971. Under Sun
Yat-sen's Republic in the early 20th centu
ry, Soong simplified the tax system and cre
ated the National Economic Council in
1931. In 1934 he established the China De
velopment Finance Corporation which be
came the main sources of attracting foreign
capital to industrialize China's economy.
During World War 11, Soong negotiat
ed substantial loans from the United
States to sustain China in its war effort. In
December 1941, Chiang Kai-shek ap
pointed him foreign minister and in De
cember 1944, he became premier of Na
tionalist China.
After the war, Soong struggled to con
tain hyperinflation and save China's war
ravaged economy before the Chinese
Communist Party came to power.
Soong's research material is located
in the Hoover Archives and is open to
the public.
