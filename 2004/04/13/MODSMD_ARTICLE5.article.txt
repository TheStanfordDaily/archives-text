# Solar Car Project races ahead to compete in challenge in 2005

With average gas prices soaring to
$2.17 per gallon in California, many
people are turning their attention to
alternative fuel sources. The Stan
ford Solar Car Project, which was re
cently approved once again for spe
cial fees, seeks to demonstrate the
feasibility of solar energy by building
and racing solar cars.
The Stanford Solar Car Project
has been building and racing vehicles
against other colleges since 1986. In
the 2003 American Solar Challenge,
the team raced across 2,300 miles
from Chicago to Los Angeles fora

second-place finish, defeating 29
teams, including UC-Berkeley, Yale
University, MIT and Northwestern
University. The car's average speed
was 55 miles per hour.
"We take a lot of pride in the fact
that we're the only hands-on engi
neering student group on this cam
pus," said junior Brian Belmont. "As
far as academics go, there is no other
outlet for engineering."
The team is currently working on
designing a new car for the 2005
American Solar Challenge, which
will run from Houston to Calgary.
Four to five people will be working
this summer to begin construction of
the car.

"We have made an effort in our
time here to put together a com
pletely new car from the ground up
every two years'," said team leader
Eerik Hantsoo, a junior. "We feel
that that way there's a lot of great
value added in learning design work
that goes on."
Project members emphasized
that knowledge is passed on from
year to year.
"You have a knowledge base that
carries on from car to car as opposed
to getting lost with an entire team
graduating, and then the new people
have nothing to go on, as was the case
with us two years ago," said junior
Gene Berdichevsky. "We hope that

once we're gone the current fresh
men and sophomores will be able to
build a car and actually know how to
build one in their junior and senior
years."
Constructing a car costs tens of
thousands of dollars. Solar cells and
the high-efficiency motor each cost
$15,000. Operating expenses, main
taining the build-site and storing
parts also cost several thousand dol
lars.
"The batteries in the car are the
equivalent of 120 laptop batteries put
together," Berdichevsky said. "They
run us a few thousand dollars."
He added, "Sponsors and spe
cial fees are hugely important to us.

I think it's awesome that students
on this campus value what we do
and see the importance of clean en
ergy and hands-on practical engi
neering experience."
Boeing donated $50,000 in high
performance equipment to the team.
The Solar Car Project also received
some financial support from Google,
the Sunshine Foundation, hair-care
company Paul Mitchell and the Stan
ford Engineering Department. De
spite these sources of financial assis
tance, ASSU special fees are still re
sponsible for 70 percent of the Solar
Car Project's cash flow, because
most contributions are in-kind dona
tions of material.

The Solar Car Project requested
less money this year from special fees
than it did last year because the
group has cut costs. It received the
support of approximately 55 percent
of voters in this year's election.
Nearly all of the Solar Car
Project's budget goes towards
equipment.
According to sophomore Brian
Boggs, the group paid only $170 for
all of its lodging and food during the
2003 American Solar Challenge.
During that month-a-half-long
race, the team members slept in tents
behind a gas station in Texas, on a
