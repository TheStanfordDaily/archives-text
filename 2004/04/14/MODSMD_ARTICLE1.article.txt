# Election certification still far from certain

### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate yesterday evening debated whether it
should certify the executive election, which was marred last week by alleged cam
paign code violations. Many senators said the ASSU needs to send a clear state
ment to the student body that the questionable campaign tactics employed this
year will not be tolerated.
Members from all three executive slates were present, including senior Mikey
Lee, whose ticket with junior Dylan Mefford is at is the center of controversy. Also
present were Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin and Assistant Commissioner
Alida Garcia, both juniors, who delivered their recommendation to the Senate.
Martin said that after examining voting patterns before and after a controver
sial e-mail sent by senior Nick Rodriguez to the majority of the student body, it was
determined that there were no discernible changes. Moreover, Martin said that in
her official capacity she felt it was important for students to move on.
"Our consensus was that in the end the results should stand, because it would
be detrimental to campus politics and the image of the ASSU if we didn't certify,"
she said.
However, Martin and Garcia each voiced personal frustrations with this year's
campaigning, which they felt exploited a loophole in election guidelines that fails
to specifically designate e-mail endorsements as a form of campaigning. The Lee-
Mefford campaign had solicited endorsements from the Junior and Senior Class
presidents that were sent out after the official campaign deadline.
"1 think all this is getting away with a technicality, but it's frustrating because
there is nothing I can do about," Garcia said. "1 think what this turned into was a
game of endorsements and of e-mail lists."
Under questioning from senators, Lee said that although he knew e-mails
would be sent to students as a result of the endorsements, he did not consider
them to be campaigning, nor did he know that they would be sent out after the
campaign deadline.
However, senior Rahshiene Taha, the Elections Commission media director,
claimed that in a meeting last Thursday to discuss alleged infractions with mem
bers of the three slates, Lee said he had known the e-mails would be sent after the
deadline. Lee said his memory of that meeting was hazy.
