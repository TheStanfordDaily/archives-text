# Election certification still far from certain
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate yesterday evening debated whether it
should certify the executive election, which was marred last week by alleged cam
paign code violations. Many senators said the ASSU needs to send a clear state
ment to the student body that the questionable campaign tactics employed this
year will not be tolerated.
Members from all three executive slates were present, including senior Mikey
Lee, whose ticket with junior Dylan Mefford is at is the center of controversy. Also
present were Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin and Assistant Commissioner
Alida Garcia, both juniors, who delivered their recommendation to the Senate.
Martin said that after examining voting patterns before and after a controver
sial e-mail sent by senior Nick Rodriguez to the majority of the student body, it was
determined that there were no discernible changes. Moreover, Martin said that in
her official capacity she felt it was important for students to move on.
"Our consensus was that in the end the results should stand, because it would
be detrimental to campus politics and the image of the ASSU if we didn't certify,"
she said.
However, Martin and Garcia each voiced personal frustrations with this year's
campaigning, which they felt exploited a loophole in election guidelines that fails
to specifically designate e-mail endorsements as a form of campaigning. The Lee-
Mefford campaign had solicited endorsements from the Junior and Senior Class
presidents that were sent out after the official campaign deadline.
"1 think all this is getting away with a technicality, but it's frustrating because
there is nothing I can do about," Garcia said. "1 think what this turned into was a
game of endorsements and of e-mail lists."
Under questioning from senators, Lee said that although he knew e-mails
would be sent to students as a result of the endorsements, he did not consider
them to be campaigning, nor did he know that they would be sent out after the
campaign deadline.
However, senior Rahshiene Taha, the Elections Commission media director,
claimed that in a meeting last Thursday to discuss alleged infractions with mem
bers of the three slates, Lee said he had known the e-mails would be sent after the
deadline. Lee said his memory of that meeting was hazy.
Current ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli. a junior, said he thought that
candidates should have been more care
ful to stop campaigning by the deadline
of midnight on April 7.
"When I hear about e-mails not going
out by 12, if it were me, I would have got
ten on my ass to make sure that e-mail
didn't go out," he said. "People didn't pur
sue this year's campaigns in gixxl faith."
Lee also disavowed knowledge of
the content of the Junior Class president
endorsement, which contained nega
tive statements about the opposing slate
of junior Ajani Husbands and sopho
more Alyssa Schwartz.
"What was said in the e-mail I was
very much against, 1 did not expect any
thing negative to be said against Ajani
and Alyssa," he said.
In addition, the endorsement from

the Junior Class presidents was not
made with the full agreement of all the
presidents, according to Garcia. How
ever, Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior,
said that all matters relating to how en
dorsements were assigned would be ad
dressed externally to the Senate, possi
bly through an investigation by the Uni
versity's Office of Judicial Affairs.
Although the debate over certifica
tion will not conclude until the Senate and
the Graduate Student Council vote dur
ing their respective meetings next week,
many senators said they felt the results of
the election might be compromised.
"It's been something that has been
thrown around, this statement that it
would look bad if the ASSU did not cer
tify this election," said senator lan
Carmichael, a senior. "Why does it look
worse for the ASSU to not certify the
election than it does for the ASSU to
certify a Hawed election?"
"We need to send a clear message to
the student body that this kind of non
sense is not going to be tolerated in fu
ture elections," said senator Sandeep
Wasan, a sophomore.

Opposing candidate Ajani Hus
bands advocated a strong course of ac
tion from the Senate.
"I'm of the opinion that the Senate
shouldn't certify the election," he said.
"Why? Because of a series of egregious
violations that have been tied directly to
the Lee-Mefford slate."
Martin said that even if the Senate
certified the election, individual students
could file cases with the Office of Judicial
Affairs to examine whether violations of
the Fundamental Standard took place.
Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe cited the endorsement sent by
the Junior Class presidents as one po
tential University infraction.
"Some members of the staff have
raised the issue that the e-mail was a like
ly violation of the University's computer
usage policy and therefore a violation of
the Fundamental Standard," Howe said.
ITie election guidelines state that
"Campaign e-mails sent to e-mail lists or
news groups are prohibited by Univer
sity policy."
Martin said that the election guide
lines concerning endorsements and e

mail campaigning should be reformed
to ensure that the current situation is not
repeated in the future.
"It's a big mess, and it will be a bigger
mess next year now that the whole
school knows you can break rules and
not have any consequences," she said.
Over the next week the Senate's pri
mary concern will be sorting through
the process of certification. Tomorrow
night, the Administration and Rules
Committee will examine the election
guidelines and the ASSU constitution
in detail to determine whether viola
tions took place. Wasan said the Com
mittee will also attempt to formulate a
plan fora special executive election in
the event that the Senate does not certi
fy last week's results.
Speaking to senators, Lee said that
although he would support their deci
sion next week, he was unsure what a
special election would accomplish.
"Yes, all of this, it's bad," he said.
"Whatever you think is just and fair, I
support. My problem is that running a
re-election doesn't mean that things are
fair. The damage is done."

"When I hear about e-mails not going
out by 12, if it were me, I would have got
ten on my ass to make sure that e-mail
didn't go out," he said. "People didn't pur
sue this year's campaigns in gixxl faith."
Lee also disavowed knowledge of
the content of the Junior Class president
endorsement, which contained nega
tive statements about the opposing slate
of junior Ajani Husbands and sopho
more Alyssa Schwartz.
"What was said in the e-mail I was
very much against, 1 did not expect any
thing negative to be said against Ajani
and Alyssa," he said.
In addition, the endorsement from

the Junior Class presidents was not
made with the full agreement of all the
presidents, according to Garcia. How
ever, Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior,
said that all matters relating to how en
dorsements were assigned would be ad
dressed externally to the Senate, possi
bly through an investigation by the Uni
versity's Office of Judicial Affairs.
Although the debate over certifica
tion will not conclude until the Senate and
the Graduate Student Council vote dur
ing their respective meetings next week,
many senators said they felt the results of
the election might be compromised.
"It's been something that has been
thrown around, this statement that it
would look bad if the ASSU did not cer
tify this election," said senator lan
Carmichael, a senior. "Why does it look
worse for the ASSU to not certify the
election than it does for the ASSU to
certify a Hawed election?"
"We need to send a clear message to
the student body that this kind of non
sense is not going to be tolerated in fu
ture elections," said senator Sandeep
Wasan, a sophomore.

Opposing candidate Ajani Hus
bands advocated a strong course of ac
tion from the Senate.
"I'm of the opinion that the Senate
shouldn't certify the election," he said.
"Why? Because of a series of egregious
violations that have been tied directly to
the Lee-Mefford slate."
Martin said that even if the Senate
certified the election, individual students
could file cases with the Office of Judicial
Affairs to examine whether violations of
the Fundamental Standard took place.
Director of Student Activities Nanci
Howe cited the endorsement sent by
the Junior Class presidents as one po
tential University infraction.
"Some members of the staff have
raised the issue that the e-mail was a like
ly violation of the University's computer
usage policy and therefore a violation of
the Fundamental Standard," Howe said.
ITie election guidelines state that
"Campaign e-mails sent to e-mail lists or
news groups are prohibited by Univer
sity policy."
Martin said that the election guide
lines concerning endorsements and e

mail campaigning should be reformed
to ensure that the current situation is not
repeated in the future.
"It's a big mess, and it will be a bigger
mess next year now that the whole
school knows you can break rules and
not have any consequences," she said.
Over the next week the Senate's pri
mary concern will be sorting through
the process of certification. Tomorrow
night, the Administration and Rules
Committee will examine the election
guidelines and the ASSU constitution
in detail to determine whether viola
tions took place. Wasan said the Com
mittee will also attempt to formulate a
plan fora special executive election in
the event that the Senate does not certi
fy last week's results.
Speaking to senators, Lee said that
although he would support their deci
sion next week, he was unsure what a
special election would accomplish.
"Yes, all of this, it's bad," he said.
"Whatever you think is just and fair, I
support. My problem is that running a
re-election doesn't mean that things are
fair. The damage is done."
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate yesterday evening debated whether it
should certify the executive election, which was marred last week by alleged cam
paign code violations. Many senators said the ASSU needs to send a clear state
ment to the student body that the questionable campaign tactics employed this
year will not be tolerated.
Members from all three executive slates were present, including senior Mikey
Lee, whose ticket with junior Dylan Mefford is at is the center of controversy. Also
present were Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin and Assistant Commissioner
Alida Garcia, both juniors, who delivered their recommendation to the Senate.
Martin said that after examining voting patterns before and after a controver
sial e-mail sent by senior Nick Rodriguez to the majority of the student body, it was
determined that there were no discernible changes. Moreover, Martin said that in
her official capacity she felt it was important for students to move on.
"Our consensus was that in the end the results should stand, because it would
be detrimental to campus politics and the image of the ASSU if we didn't certify,"
she said.
However, Martin and Garcia each voiced personal frustrations with this year's
campaigning, which they felt exploited a loophole in election guidelines that fails
to specifically designate e-mail endorsements as a form of campaigning. The Lee-
Mefford campaign had solicited endorsements from the Junior and Senior Class
presidents that were sent out after the official campaign deadline.
"1 think all this is getting away with a technicality, but it's frustrating because
there is nothing I can do about," Garcia said. "1 think what this turned into was a
game of endorsements and of e-mail lists."
Under questioning from senators, Lee said that although he knew e-mails
would be sent to students as a result of the endorsements, he did not consider
them to be campaigning, nor did he know that they would be sent out after the
campaign deadline.
However, senior Rahshiene Taha, the Elections Commission media director,
claimed that in a meeting last Thursday to discuss alleged infractions with mem
bers of the three slates, Lee said he had known the e-mails would be sent after the
deadline. Lee said his memory of that meeting was hazy.
Current ASSU Vice President Joey
Natoli. a junior, said he thought that
candidates should have been more care
ful to stop campaigning by the deadline
of midnight on April 7.
"When I hear about e-mails not going
out by 12, if it were me, I would have got
ten on my ass to make sure that e-mail
didn't go out," he said. "People didn't pur
