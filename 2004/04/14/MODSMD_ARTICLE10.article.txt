Yesterday, The Daily ran a photograph accompa
nying a story regarding the family of T.V. Soong
("Soong family to release financial records to Hoover
Archives," April 13). The caption incorrectly stated
that T.V. Soong engaged in political corruption
around the time of World War 11. This is not the
case, and the caption should have read that he did
not engage in political corruption. The Daily regrets
the error.
