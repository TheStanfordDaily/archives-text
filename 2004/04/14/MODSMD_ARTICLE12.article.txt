## Dean of Freshman and Transfer Students Julie Lythcott-Haims 
### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Julie Lythcott-Haims graduated from Stanford in 1989 and packed her
bags for Harvard Law School. She returned to work at Stanford soon af
terward, first in the Law School, then for President John Hennessy and fi
nally in her current role as dean of freshman and transfer students. Here
"Dean Julie," as she likes to be called, shares her thoughts on Full Moon
nudity, partying at Harvard and cheating on the Sophomore Class.
1) What happened to your "Pay It Forward"-type scheme for Stanford?
Did Kevin Spacey and Haley Joel Osment threaten to sue?
Pretty much. They threatened to sue, my thing was such a huge success they
wanted some of the royalties from my efforts. Huge moneymaker. The truth
is, the thing that you paid forward — in addition to doing a good deed you
documented the good deed in a tiny journal, and we asked that once the
journal had been passed to ten people, that they return it to our office. As of
1:30 p.m. today, we haven't received any back, and we launched it a year ago.
2) You went to Harvard Law School. Who knows how to have a better time:

Stanford students or Harvard students?
Hands-down, Stanford.
3) What's your favorite lawyer joke?
I hate all lawyer jokes. The one that comes to mind is:
What's the difference between a lawyer in the road and
a dead snake in the road? There are skid marks in front
of the snake.
4) How many people did you kiss at Full Moon on the

Quad when you were an undergrad?
The great Class of "89 resurrected the Full Moon on the Quad tradition, as you may
know, and that was my senior year. I was more of an organizer than a kisser, I have
to say. I probably kissed my fellow Senior Class presidents and my boyfriend.
5) You helped resurrect the tradition?
1 did. We had heard about it, it was something people talked about, this sort
of old tradition. I think it may have been dead five, six years, something like
that. I think we were looking for cool, hip things to do as Senior Class presi
dents. We thought it was a great fall quarter event to get the freshmen to mix
it up with the seniors. It was quite different then than the way it's run now. It
was very quaint: Line up all the seniors in a row across from the freshman and
at the stroke of midnight the bell would chime and they'll step forward and
kiss one another, which is a far cry from what happens now.
6. Why do you think a change has occurred? Is it in the organization, or is it
a generational change?
It's hard to know because I was only here for that year so I don't know when
the change occurred and what the gradations were. It became a more popu
lar event, it became something more and more people went to — not just
freshmen, not just seniors. I think today's students definitely are more into
being naked and public displays of things that may have been kept behind
closed doors back in the day. [In '89, when we started] there was this myth,
this legend, that you're not truly a Stanford woman until you've been kissed
by a senior in the Quad. We decided that we're not going to limit it to women
— we want fresh/H£7i to be able to be initiated as well. It was fairly hetero
centric at the time. Obviously that's changed, and that's a good change.
7. Choose one of the following: steam tunneling, fountain hopping, or
sneaking onto the roof of the Psych Building at night.
Fountain-hopping. It's the only one of the three that I've done.
8. When was the last time you let out a big, hearty, "Ooohhh six!"?
Oh-six would have been last Wednesday night at about 10:00, 10:15 p.m.,
with a group of leaders of the sophomore class. We get together every now
and then just to shout oh-six at one another.
9. Let's be honest: You're cheating on us with oh-seven, aren't you?
I was hoping you wouldn't notice. But rest assured, I'll be cheating on you
with oh-eight in two weeks.
10. If The Stanford Daily were a freshman or transfer student, what would
you do to welcome it: give it a reception with caviar and fine cheeses, or just
give it a half-deflated balloon with an index card that says "Hi"?
Champagne and caviar — maybe it would buy me better press.
