## Stanford Archery Program ranked ninth in nation 
### KATIE BEARMAN 
At this very moment, a few tal
ented Stanford students walking
around campus have officially
achieved Porn Star status.
Sorry to disappoint you. but
these men and women are not actu
ally popular figures in the sex enter
tainment industry. Rather, they are
members of the thriving Stanford

Archery Program. Stan
ford archers refer to
their teammates as
"Porn Stars" if they
have, during the course
of a single round, man
aged to hit three arrows
in the innermost ring of
the target, thus scoring
an "X."
"Contrary to popular
opinion, this is actually

quite hard," said senior Helen
Cheng, president of the Stanford
Archery Program.
Many are unaware that an
archery program exists on campus.
Indeed, when asked what she
thought of this program, sophomore
Teresa Davis remarked. "Stanford
has archery?"
Davis' reaction is understandable.
Archery is not a varsity sport at Stan
ford and therefore receives less pub
licity and funding than teams.
Additionally, the Stanford
Archery Program is relatively new.
It was founded two years ago by ju
nior David Lu and computer sci
ence graduate student Keith Cole
man. Coleman had shot competi
tively prior to college, and. accord
ing to Cheng, Lu was interested in
starting the club because he "want
ed to shoot at things, but in a safe
and structured way, of course."
The fact that there are students
here who like to "shoot at things"
presents significant concern to ju
nior Dave Singh, who commented
that "Stanford Archery poses po
tential threats to the entire Stan
ford community."
Don't worry, Dave. Everyone
who comes to shoot on the range
must complete a safety instruction
class, because safety is one of the
team's top priorities. Additional
ly, the perimeter of the range is
roped off and follows, to a tee, the
protective guidelines enforced by
the National Archery Association,
orNAA.
So esteemed is the archery pro
gram for its safety and excellence, in
fact, that parents from all over the
Bay Area send their young children
to participate in Junior Olympic
Archery Development, or JOAD —
a course instructed every weekend by
Stanford Archery team members.
Each Stanford archer is certified
as a Level II instructor. Additional
ly, during the past two quarters, the

archery squad has helped out at a
Girl Scout camp, held an athletic
camp for kids and hosted a benefit
shoot. Stanford archers place great
importance on offering exciting ath
letic opportunities for people both
on and off campus.
"The Stanford Archery Program
is called a program and not a team
because we provide so much for the
community," Cheng said. "One of

"Don't worry... Everyone who comes to shoot on the
range must complete a safety instruction class "

our express purposes is for other
people to learn about archery,
which is why we have so many com
munity programs."
While upholding exhaustive ef
forts to plan events for non-team
members, the Stanford archers also
practice tirelessly in preparation for
their own tournaments. They com
pete at large national events against
universities in which archery is a
varsity sport.
Although they often must enter
tournaments without a full team, they
have placed very well at these events.
Currently, the Stanford Archery Pro
gram is ranked ninth in the nation
and first in the Western region.
Individual members of the
Archery Program have also ac
quired impressive honors. Cheng,
for instance, won a gold medal at the
2003 Pacific Coast Championships
in the collegiate women's recurve
division. When one considers the
Program's practice schedule, these
results are not surprising.
"Just this weekend, the team woke
up at 8 a.m. on both Saturday and
Sunday for intensive training to pre
pare for our upcoming tournament
season. I spent five hours shooting on
Saturday and nine hours on Sunday,"
Cheng said. "Normally, we train six
days per week."
Cheng and her teammates
take pride in their dedication and
accomplishments.
"The amazing thing is that all of
this is self-motivated, because we're
not a varsity sport," she said.
Self-motivated, indeed. Accord
ing to Cheng, members of the Stan
ford Archery Program include 19
men and women who "take 20 units
of classes, are incredibly involved
with other clubs and sports, hold
jobs, do research, participate in
Greek life and volunteer."
The students in the Archery Pro
gram also attribute much of their suc
cess to their coach, Sheri Rhodes, who

is the current coach of the United
States Olympic Archery team.
"Rhodes is incredible, and we
are extremely lucky to have her
helping us," Cheng said.
The Stanford Archers work very
hard to raise enough funds to pay
Rhodes as well as buy adequate
equipment, hold tournaments and
travel to competitions. Besides re
ceiving some financial aid from the

ASSU, members of the Stanford
Archery Program teach beginner and
other private lessons to earn extra
money. Their participation in the
JOAD program also brings in funds.
Still, the Stanford Archery Program
encounters many difficulties.
"We definitely face the challenge
of wanting to do more and not having

the manpower to do it," Cheng said.
As the increasingly beautiful
spring weather hits campus, Stan
ford students will have more oppor
tunities to see the Stanford Archery
Program in action. With the help of
Economics professor and avid
archer Steve Tadelis, the program
has launched a student-initiated
archery course this quarter.
Additionally, Stanford will be

hosting the West Re
gional Intercollegiate
Archery Champi
onships. The tourna
ment will take place on
Roble Field, April 23-
25, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Recognized by the
NAA, this event will
include about 50
archers representing
several universities.

The Stanford Archery Program is
always enthusiastic to take in new
members. One need not have archery
experience to participate; there are
practices for beginners, and the
Archery Program provides equip
ment for those who want to learn how
to shoot. Students who join the team
will be in good company.

"Porn Stars" if they
have, during the course
of a single round, man
aged to hit three arrows
in the innermost ring of
the target, thus scoring
an "X."
"Contrary to popular
opinion, this is actually

quite hard," said senior Helen
Cheng, president of the Stanford
Archery Program.
Many are unaware that an
archery program exists on campus.
Indeed, when asked what she
thought of this program, sophomore
Teresa Davis remarked. "Stanford
has archery?"
Davis' reaction is understandable.
Archery is not a varsity sport at Stan
ford and therefore receives less pub
licity and funding than teams.
Additionally, the Stanford
Archery Program is relatively new.
It was founded two years ago by ju
nior David Lu and computer sci
ence graduate student Keith Cole
man. Coleman had shot competi
tively prior to college, and. accord
ing to Cheng, Lu was interested in
starting the club because he "want
ed to shoot at things, but in a safe
and structured way, of course."
The fact that there are students
here who like to "shoot at things"
presents significant concern to ju
nior Dave Singh, who commented
that "Stanford Archery poses po
tential threats to the entire Stan
ford community."
Don't worry, Dave. Everyone
who comes to shoot on the range
must complete a safety instruction
class, because safety is one of the
team's top priorities. Additional
ly, the perimeter of the range is
roped off and follows, to a tee, the
protective guidelines enforced by
the National Archery Association,
orNAA.
So esteemed is the archery pro
gram for its safety and excellence, in
fact, that parents from all over the
Bay Area send their young children
to participate in Junior Olympic
Archery Development, or JOAD —
a course instructed every weekend by
Stanford Archery team members.
Each Stanford archer is certified
as a Level II instructor. Additional
ly, during the past two quarters, the

archery squad has helped out at a
Girl Scout camp, held an athletic
camp for kids and hosted a benefit
shoot. Stanford archers place great
importance on offering exciting ath
letic opportunities for people both
on and off campus.
"The Stanford Archery Program
is called a program and not a team
because we provide so much for the
community," Cheng said. "One of

"Don't worry... Everyone who comes to shoot on the
range must complete a safety instruction class "

our express purposes is for other
people to learn about archery,
which is why we have so many com
munity programs."
While upholding exhaustive ef
forts to plan events for non-team
members, the Stanford archers also
practice tirelessly in preparation for
their own tournaments. They com
pete at large national events against
universities in which archery is a
varsity sport.
Although they often must enter
tournaments without a full team, they
have placed very well at these events.
Currently, the Stanford Archery Pro
gram is ranked ninth in the nation
and first in the Western region.
Individual members of the
Archery Program have also ac
quired impressive honors. Cheng,
for instance, won a gold medal at the
2003 Pacific Coast Championships
in the collegiate women's recurve
division. When one considers the
Program's practice schedule, these
results are not surprising.
"Just this weekend, the team woke
up at 8 a.m. on both Saturday and
Sunday for intensive training to pre
pare for our upcoming tournament
season. I spent five hours shooting on
Saturday and nine hours on Sunday,"
Cheng said. "Normally, we train six
days per week."
Cheng and her teammates
take pride in their dedication and
accomplishments.
"The amazing thing is that all of
this is self-motivated, because we're
not a varsity sport," she said.
Self-motivated, indeed. Accord
ing to Cheng, members of the Stan
ford Archery Program include 19
men and women who "take 20 units
of classes, are incredibly involved
with other clubs and sports, hold
jobs, do research, participate in
Greek life and volunteer."
The students in the Archery Pro
gram also attribute much of their suc
cess to their coach, Sheri Rhodes, who

is the current coach of the United
States Olympic Archery team.
"Rhodes is incredible, and we
are extremely lucky to have her
helping us," Cheng said.
The Stanford Archers work very
hard to raise enough funds to pay
Rhodes as well as buy adequate
equipment, hold tournaments and
travel to competitions. Besides re
ceiving some financial aid from the

ASSU, members of the Stanford
Archery Program teach beginner and
other private lessons to earn extra
money. Their participation in the
JOAD program also brings in funds.
Still, the Stanford Archery Program
encounters many difficulties.
"We definitely face the challenge
of wanting to do more and not having

the manpower to do it," Cheng said.
As the increasingly beautiful
spring weather hits campus, Stan
ford students will have more oppor
tunities to see the Stanford Archery
Program in action. With the help of
Economics professor and avid
archer Steve Tadelis, the program
has launched a student-initiated
archery course this quarter.
Additionally, Stanford will be

hosting the West Re
gional Intercollegiate
Archery Champi
onships. The tourna
ment will take place on
Roble Field, April 23-
25, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Recognized by the
NAA, this event will
include about 50
archers representing
several universities.

The Stanford Archery Program is
always enthusiastic to take in new
members. One need not have archery
experience to participate; there are
practices for beginners, and the
Archery Program provides equip
ment for those who want to learn how
to shoot. Students who join the team
will be in good company.
