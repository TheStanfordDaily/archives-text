# Eat, drink and be merry
## I' got the blues' 
### JENNIE BRODER FOOD COLUMNIST 
I know you all have a burning desire to know what I
did this weekend. Don't ask me how I know this,
but I just do. So I went home to visit my family and
revel in my new title.
Are you talking about the title of your next bestseller,
you may wonder? Or perhaps the title of the property
that you just inherited?
No, my friends. This ts an even better title — one that
came a little earlier than I expected in my life. Along
with my previously held titles "Ms. , "student and
"generally fabulous person," I now have "aunt" to add
to the list. That's right, my brother and sister-in-law
have a 10-day old baby boy, so I flew home to meet little
Aidan Jack (nickname, AJ).
So now, as cool aunt Jennie, I have a whole new set of
responsibilities to attend to. Like informing him of the
cool music that his out-of-date parents think is terrible.
Or exposing him to the classic cinema experiences of
"Waiting for Guffman," "Saturday Night Live: Celebri
ty Jeopardy" and "Old School."
And most importantly, the Blue Box blues.
No childhood is complete without the warmth of a
freshly prepared batch of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese,
where the artificial cheese powder perfectly coats the in
dividual pasta elbows.
As my taste buds started reminiscing about the Blue
Box. my palate embarked on a trip down memory lane
and I recalled, after years of repression, how much I

loved the foods I ate as a kid.
Life was so much simpler then, and so was my dinner.
It was grilled cheese, no tomato. Peanut butter sandwich
es. Juice boxes. Spaghetti with butter. Mac'n'cheese. The
only part of Camembert I would have recognized was the
'Bert,' and I would have wondered why Ernie wasn't
there. I would have laughed and told you that cheese
wasn't blue. And sushi was just out of the question.

So I started thinking about all the restau
rants and dishes I completely overlook every
time I go out to eat, because I think I'm too
old for them, or I'm just too cool for them.
Now I've decided the cool thing to do is to
embrace those childhood favorites, and
serve your past that has served you so well.
What to serve it? That's where I step in.
You might wonder where to find these old
school goodies. Just look down University, and
you have arrived to kid-food heaven.
You might think that California Pizza
Kitchen, or CPK, is reserved for barbeque
chicken pizza. Thai chicken pizza, or spinach
artichoke dip. But in case you failed to no-

tice the hoards of little tykes dining at this establish
ment, you will learn that they have a fabulous kids menu
(aptly named CPKids).
Order the mini-sized cheese or pepperoni pizza.
Nothing fancy, just warm gooey cheese sitting atop a
crisp crust. Another huge item on the menu seems to be
the fusilli pasta, which for all of you noodle-challenged
folks means the corkscrew-shaped kind. They offer it

lightly buttered or coated with olive oil. in a hearty meat
sauce, creamy Alfredo sauce or the classic tomato sauce.
And since these are kids portions, you can definitely
save room for the Oreo cookie sundae dessert.
The best part of the CPKids meal, though, is the cool
plastic reusable cup for your soda that you get to keep
as a souvenir after your culinary adventure. Not to men
tion the crayons the waitresses give you in the begin-

ning so you can color the kids menu and fill
in the mazes and crossword puzzles.
If you're not in the mood for pizza or
pasta (which sounds utterly absurd to me,
by the way), you can check out the chicken
tenders at Taxi's, or the utterly wonderful
tuna melt at Joanie's Cafe on California
Ave. The toasted slices of bread perfectly
enclose the smooth filling of mild tuna
salad and melted cheese. Dipped in
ketchup, it reminds me of chilly Saturday
afternoons at home when Mom wanted to
warm me up with a satisfying lunch.
For some on-campus loving, revamp
your traditional dining-hall brunch expe-

rience by tossing some chocolate chips or sprinkles
into the Belgian waffle machine. 1 know I loved it
when my dad would whip me up a batch of these on a
Sunday morning.
And for the best part, visit the Peninsula Creamery
for utterly fabulous milkshakes. With delectably rich
flavors like Oreo cookie mint, chocolate chip cookie
dough, and peanut butter chocolate fudge, these foun

tain treats are served to you in a frosty steel tumbler,
with an extra cup on the side holding all the ice cream
that spilled over.
Of course, not all kids' favorites can be imitated and
duplicated by a restaurant's kitchen staff. Some things are
reserved for Mom only. Example: in terms of
Mac'n'cheese — nothing beats the Blue Box (unless it's
Annie's Shells and White Cheddar — which is the only
viable alternative). You can give me the overly cheesy
dish that steak houses serve, where the pieces of pasta are
buried within the mass pool of cheddar. While it might be
tasty, it's not the Mac'n'cheese that I know and love.
So bust out the Skippy and the Wonder Bread. Cut
off your crusts, smother your face and t-shirt with melt
ed chocolate from a warm cookie. Buy a Capri Sun, re
member when Oscar Meyer snack packs and Lunch
ables were the coolest thing ever, and stop feeling like
you're too cool and macho / feminine to partake in these
activities. Life isn't simple, but sometimes our food can
be. And simple tastes pretty good to me.

wasn't blue. And sushi was just out of the question.

So I started thinking about all the restau
rants and dishes I completely overlook every
time I go out to eat, because I think I'm too
old for them, or I'm just too cool for them.
Now I've decided the cool thing to do is to
embrace those childhood favorites, and
serve your past that has served you so well.
What to serve it? That's where I step in.
You might wonder where to find these old
school goodies. Just look down University, and
you have arrived to kid-food heaven.
You might think that California Pizza
Kitchen, or CPK, is reserved for barbeque
chicken pizza. Thai chicken pizza, or spinach
artichoke dip. But in case you failed to no-

tice the hoards of little tykes dining at this establish
ment, you will learn that they have a fabulous kids menu
(aptly named CPKids).
Order the mini-sized cheese or pepperoni pizza.
Nothing fancy, just warm gooey cheese sitting atop a
crisp crust. Another huge item on the menu seems to be
the fusilli pasta, which for all of you noodle-challenged
folks means the corkscrew-shaped kind. They offer it

lightly buttered or coated with olive oil. in a hearty meat
sauce, creamy Alfredo sauce or the classic tomato sauce.
And since these are kids portions, you can definitely
save room for the Oreo cookie sundae dessert.
The best part of the CPKids meal, though, is the cool
plastic reusable cup for your soda that you get to keep
as a souvenir after your culinary adventure. Not to men
tion the crayons the waitresses give you in the begin-

ning so you can color the kids menu and fill
in the mazes and crossword puzzles.
If you're not in the mood for pizza or
pasta (which sounds utterly absurd to me,
by the way), you can check out the chicken
tenders at Taxi's, or the utterly wonderful
tuna melt at Joanie's Cafe on California
Ave. The toasted slices of bread perfectly
enclose the smooth filling of mild tuna
salad and melted cheese. Dipped in
ketchup, it reminds me of chilly Saturday
afternoons at home when Mom wanted to
warm me up with a satisfying lunch.
For some on-campus loving, revamp
your traditional dining-hall brunch expe-

rience by tossing some chocolate chips or sprinkles
into the Belgian waffle machine. 1 know I loved it
when my dad would whip me up a batch of these on a
Sunday morning.
And for the best part, visit the Peninsula Creamery
for utterly fabulous milkshakes. With delectably rich
flavors like Oreo cookie mint, chocolate chip cookie
dough, and peanut butter chocolate fudge, these foun

tain treats are served to you in a frosty steel tumbler,
with an extra cup on the side holding all the ice cream
that spilled over.
Of course, not all kids' favorites can be imitated and
duplicated by a restaurant's kitchen staff. Some things are
reserved for Mom only. Example: in terms of
Mac'n'cheese — nothing beats the Blue Box (unless it's
Annie's Shells and White Cheddar — which is the only
viable alternative). You can give me the overly cheesy
dish that steak houses serve, where the pieces of pasta are
buried within the mass pool of cheddar. While it might be
tasty, it's not the Mac'n'cheese that I know and love.
So bust out the Skippy and the Wonder Bread. Cut
off your crusts, smother your face and t-shirt with melt
ed chocolate from a warm cookie. Buy a Capri Sun, re
member when Oscar Meyer snack packs and Lunch
ables were the coolest thing ever, and stop feeling like
you're too cool and macho / feminine to partake in these
activities. Life isn't simple, but sometimes our food can
be. And simple tastes pretty good to me.

I know you all have a burning desire to know what I
did this weekend. Don't ask me how I know this,
but I just do. So I went home to visit my family and
revel in my new title.
Are you talking about the title of your next bestseller,
you may wonder? Or perhaps the title of the property
that you just inherited?
No, my friends. This ts an even better title — one that
came a little earlier than I expected in my life. Along
with my previously held titles "Ms. , "student and
"generally fabulous person," I now have "aunt" to add
to the list. That's right, my brother and sister-in-law
have a 10-day old baby boy, so I flew home to meet little
Aidan Jack (nickname, AJ).
So now, as cool aunt Jennie, I have a whole new set of
responsibilities to attend to. Like informing him of the
cool music that his out-of-date parents think is terrible.
Or exposing him to the classic cinema experiences of
"Waiting for Guffman," "Saturday Night Live: Celebri
ty Jeopardy" and "Old School."
And most importantly, the Blue Box blues.
No childhood is complete without the warmth of a
freshly prepared batch of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese,
where the artificial cheese powder perfectly coats the in
dividual pasta elbows.
As my taste buds started reminiscing about the Blue
Box. my palate embarked on a trip down memory lane
and I recalled, after years of repression, how much I

loved the foods I ate as a kid.
Life was so much simpler then, and so was my dinner.
It was grilled cheese, no tomato. Peanut butter sandwich
es. Juice boxes. Spaghetti with butter. Mac'n'cheese. The
only part of Camembert I would have recognized was the
'Bert,' and I would have wondered why Ernie wasn't
there. I would have laughed and told you that cheese
wasn't blue. And sushi was just out of the question.
