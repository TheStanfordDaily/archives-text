## WALLACE WORLD Congress's porky pigs 
### 
Ahhh, tax season: The
painful time of year
when it becomes patent
ly clear how much of the
pathetically small amount of cash I
earn is taken by the government.
Now I'm not the kind of person
that doesn't believe in paying taxes
at all. I know Americans enjoy pret
ty great public services like running
water, trash pick-up and paved
roads, not to mention a representa
tional government, a kickass mili
tary and a whole host of other gov
ernment-provided amenities that
many nations don't have. Big infras
tructure stuff like we have here isn't
free or cheap, and I'm prepared to
pay my share.
But it pains me to see congres
sional waste and abuse of my hard
earned cash. Taxes are a sacrifice for
me, and I don't want to learn that our
trusted stewards of the purse strings
are ripping open the purse to fund
stupid projects like $2 million to
teach youths to play golf or half a mil
lion dollars to celebrate Johnny Ap
pleseed in Ohio (real projects funded
through the last omnibus bill).
1 would hope my elected officials
would consider tax revenue as a pay
ment for democracy and not a kind
of magical ATM stocked with end
less sums of free money. 1 expect
members of Congress to spend my
money and your money as wisely as
if they earned it themselves.
Of course, it doesn't quite work
out that way. Every finance bill
that winds its way through
Congress is loaded with "pork" —
the cute term applied to the unnec
essary spending Congressmen and
women tuck into bills to soothe
constituents back home or help out
big business contributors.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has
made a sideline career tracking all of
the pork in various bills Congress

tries to ram through committee. His
idea of unnecessary appropriations
is the unauthorized, unrequested.
low-priority extra spending tossed
into a bill circumventing normal pro
cedures. In other words, these are lit
tle perks congressmen slide into the
bill at the last second, breaking proce-

dural rules, to
help their reelec
tion bids back in
the home district.
The aforemen
tioned January
omnibus bill (to
taling an almost
unfathomable
$820 billion) was
loaded with secret
pork. Judge for
yourselves if this is

J
a good use of public monies (and I'm
not making any of this up). A few
tasty samples:
Almost $2 million was requested
for exotic pet disease research in
California, while $50 million was
requested to build an indoor rain
forest in lowa. More than $7 mil
lion went to the lucky Hawaiian Sea
Turtles, $6 million for Alaskan Sea
Lions, $1 million for Mormon
cricket suppression in Utah and
$100,000 to lowa to develop a
World Food Prize.
A couple million went for various
statehood celebrations. The Rock
n-Roll Hall of Fame got a $100,000
chunk of change, while a quarter of
a million dollars was dedicated to
building a Wheels Museum for the
good people of New Mexico. A
quarter of a million also went to the
friendly fowls of the Wild Turkey
Association, and about $1 million
fora Lewis and Clark celebration in
Idaho. Fittingly, the Missouri Pork
Producers Association also got their
piece of the action, about $ 1 million.
Altogether there was more than

$11 billion of wasteful earmarks.
Those include the aforementioned
ridiculousness, hundreds of city im
provement projects, $300 million for
NASA above their requested bud
get and 902 corporate welfare pro
jects — taxpayer-funded projects to
renovate theaters and businesses
(including a Coca Cola plant: have a
coke and a smile indeed!) — and all
manner of for-profit buildings.
Corporate welfare may make
sense for members of Congress in an
election year — you have to raise
the money to run for office, and
Coke is a pretty trusted campaign
donor. But this kind of generous
spending for business comes at the
same time those who would be our
leaders are calling for fiscal respon
sibility and belt-tightening.
Well, not everyone is asking for
fiscal restraint. President George W.
Bush somehow thinks we have the
money to wage a war far from home
while we are rebuilding another
country in the Middle East, increase
military spending, save Social Secu
rity, Leave no Child Behind, go to
Mars, balance the budget AND
throw in a tax cut? It's not possible.
Anyone familiar with budgeting
knows you have to do without in
lean times. I would say a trillion dol
lar deficit, a few years of recession, a
couple of wars and less revenue due
to outsourcing makes for lean times.
But Congress is still operating as
if the coffers are overflowing. I may
be making a sad little contribution
to the machine with my tax offer
ings, but it's my blood, sweat and
tears. 1 want to see belt-tightening in
Washington before I'm asked to
tighten mine any further. After all,
nothing gets Americans more riled
up than too many taxes.

tional government, a kickass mili
tary and a whole host of other gov
ernment-provided amenities that
many nations don't have. Big infras
tructure stuff like we have here isn't
free or cheap, and I'm prepared to
pay my share.
But it pains me to see congres
sional waste and abuse of my hard
earned cash. Taxes are a sacrifice for
me, and I don't want to learn that our
trusted stewards of the purse strings
are ripping open the purse to fund
stupid projects like $2 million to
teach youths to play golf or half a mil
lion dollars to celebrate Johnny Ap
pleseed in Ohio (real projects funded
through the last omnibus bill).
1 would hope my elected officials
would consider tax revenue as a pay
ment for democracy and not a kind
of magical ATM stocked with end
less sums of free money. 1 expect
members of Congress to spend my
money and your money as wisely as
if they earned it themselves.
Of course, it doesn't quite work
out that way. Every finance bill
that winds its way through
Congress is loaded with "pork" —
the cute term applied to the unnec
essary spending Congressmen and
women tuck into bills to soothe
constituents back home or help out
big business contributors.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has
made a sideline career tracking all of
the pork in various bills Congress

tries to ram through committee. His
idea of unnecessary appropriations
is the unauthorized, unrequested.
low-priority extra spending tossed
into a bill circumventing normal pro
cedures. In other words, these are lit
tle perks congressmen slide into the
bill at the last second, breaking proce-

dural rules, to
help their reelec
tion bids back in
the home district.
The aforemen
tioned January
omnibus bill (to
taling an almost
unfathomable
$820 billion) was
loaded with secret
pork. Judge for
yourselves if this is

J
a good use of public monies (and I'm
not making any of this up). A few
tasty samples:
Almost $2 million was requested
for exotic pet disease research in
California, while $50 million was
requested to build an indoor rain
forest in lowa. More than $7 mil
lion went to the lucky Hawaiian Sea
Turtles, $6 million for Alaskan Sea
Lions, $1 million for Mormon
cricket suppression in Utah and
$100,000 to lowa to develop a
World Food Prize.
A couple million went for various
statehood celebrations. The Rock
n-Roll Hall of Fame got a $100,000
chunk of change, while a quarter of
a million dollars was dedicated to
building a Wheels Museum for the
good people of New Mexico. A
quarter of a million also went to the
friendly fowls of the Wild Turkey
Association, and about $1 million
fora Lewis and Clark celebration in
Idaho. Fittingly, the Missouri Pork
Producers Association also got their
piece of the action, about $ 1 million.
Altogether there was more than

$11 billion of wasteful earmarks.
Those include the aforementioned
ridiculousness, hundreds of city im
provement projects, $300 million for
NASA above their requested bud
get and 902 corporate welfare pro
jects — taxpayer-funded projects to
renovate theaters and businesses
(including a Coca Cola plant: have a
coke and a smile indeed!) — and all
manner of for-profit buildings.
Corporate welfare may make
sense for members of Congress in an
election year — you have to raise
the money to run for office, and
Coke is a pretty trusted campaign
donor. But this kind of generous
spending for business comes at the
same time those who would be our
leaders are calling for fiscal respon
sibility and belt-tightening.
Well, not everyone is asking for
fiscal restraint. President George W.
Bush somehow thinks we have the
money to wage a war far from home
while we are rebuilding another
country in the Middle East, increase
military spending, save Social Secu
rity, Leave no Child Behind, go to
Mars, balance the budget AND
throw in a tax cut? It's not possible.
Anyone familiar with budgeting
knows you have to do without in
lean times. I would say a trillion dol
lar deficit, a few years of recession, a
couple of wars and less revenue due
to outsourcing makes for lean times.
But Congress is still operating as
if the coffers are overflowing. I may
be making a sad little contribution
to the machine with my tax offer
ings, but it's my blood, sweat and
tears. 1 want to see belt-tightening in
Washington before I'm asked to
tighten mine any further. After all,
nothing gets Americans more riled
up than too many taxes.

Ahhh, tax season: The
painful time of year
when it becomes patent
ly clear how much of the
pathetically small amount of cash I
earn is taken by the government.
Now I'm not the kind of person
that doesn't believe in paying taxes
at all. I know Americans enjoy pret
ty great public services like running
water, trash pick-up and paved
roads, not to mention a representa
tional government, a kickass mili
tary and a whole host of other gov
ernment-provided amenities that
many nations don't have. Big infras
tructure stuff like we have here isn't
