## The 						golden age of hangovers 
### 
There are a limited number
of subjects about which I
can speak eloquently and
passionately. As some of
you may know. I can successfully
argue for hours about why the desig
nated hitter should be abolished from
baseball, whether Sean Connery gets
more ass than any septuagenarian in
history and why my Rain Man-like
ability to guess how many jelly beans
are in a single jar is so impressive.
Well, you can add one more sub
ject to the list: hangovers.
For most college students like my
self, hangovers are a fact of life. They
are something we have gotten accus
tomed to dealing with — a part of our
normal routine, much like chores or
exercise (not like I really do either).
We go out at night, we drink copi
ous amounts of alcohol and we feel
the aftereffects the next morning. It's
as simple as that. If this were a Pow
erPoint presentation rather than a
newspaper column, I would use some
nifty How charts to supplement this
cause-and-effect analysis. But, in this
case, a verbal explanation will have
to suffice.
Truthfully, I could use this entire
page to chronicle some of my many
horrible hangover experiences. I
don't think that's necessary, though.
Most of the readers of this fine news
paper have thrown a couple drinks
down the hatch once or twice and
know what it's like. Plus, if I ever de
cide to run for office, I'd rather not
have stories about me waking up on
a bathroom floor plastered all over
the Internet.
The basic effects of a hangover are
pretty standard. Your head feeling
like it's in a clamp tighter than Kathy
Griffin's face. Your stomach feeling
like a Maytag washing machine. A
general sense of worthlessness per
meating through your body like na
palm over a Vietnamese village.
Whatever your personal hangover
idiosyncrasies, you've probably
woken up at least a couple times feel
ing like such crap that you've vowed
never to drink again. I know I have
had this feeling about as many times
as Wilt Chamberlain got laid. But,
much like a young harlot jumping on
big Wilt, I'm back on the wagon in no
time, swigging down Captain and
Cokes like it's my job.
I don't even want to think about
the number of classes I've missed at

Stanford because of bad hangovers.
I'm convinced that my father should
get a hefty chunk of the tuition bills
paid back to him by the school after

graduation.
Maybe I could re
ally even it all out
and have Shibu
subsidize the re
fund. It would
only be right.
(For all of you
whisker-free, ID
less freshmen out
there, Shibu is the
superstar propri-

etor of Ernie's on El Camino.)
And that's not even counting the
early-morning classes that I actually
attended after a night out, but got
there looking more disheveled than
Nick Nolte in his infamous mug shot.
The morning after experiencing my
first SAE Bar Night freshman year, 1
got to class more hung (over) than
Tommy Lee and actually had to
leave a Psych 1 lecture after half an
hour to puke in the bathroom in the
basement of Jordan Hall. Clearly,
this did not help my understanding of
cognitive dissonance, and I have to
think that the 15-minute dry-heaving
break was reflected in my grade on
the midterm.
As we get older, it's clear that it
just gets worse. From my extensive
research — which consisted of
walking down the hallways of SAE
and peppering my friends with
questions — I can say with some
certainty that each hangover is
worse than the last.
It's like we're feeling the effects of
every game of beer pong we've played
since birth. The body never lies, and I
guess the body— and especially the
liver — never forgets, too.
And the days are numbered when
we can simply skip lecture and stay in
bed all day nursing a hangover. Next
year, I doubt that my employers at
Credit Suisse First Boston will re
spond too positively to my explana
tion that the pitch book isn't ready
because I still can't feel my legs after
a night of boozing. And after watch
ing those anti-drug commercials hun
dreds of times over the last couple of
years, I now know that saying you got
stoned and forgot isn't such a good
excuse either.
As I found out the last couple of
summers working in serious profes

sional settings, it simply sucks being
hung over at the office. There are
only so many things you can do to al
leviate the effects while on the job.
It's obviously not such a bright idea
to fall asleep in front of your com
puter; napping under the desk a la
George Costanza can only work a
couple of times, and bosses aren't
too sympathetic if you need to cut
out early because of a bad case of
the runs.
I will disclose one small discovery
that my friends made over the sum
mer that could help you out when
you're nursing a serious hangover at
work. The bathroom is your best
friend. Find a restroom, sit on the toi
let and you can chill fora good 20
minutes without being bothered if
you play your cards right. One of my
friends nicknamed the toilet, the "cr
napper," because of this extra role it
provides in an office.
College is undoubtedly the best
environment fora hangover. Most
students avoid 9 a.m. classes like the
plague, the weekend starts on Thurs
day night and there aren't any moth
ers around nagging you to get out of
bed at noon.
Less than two months away from
graduation, I can see clearly that the
golden age of hangovers is soon going
to become a distant memory, much
like that of the Backstreet Boys' one
time platinum status.
So 1 am going to use my soap box
to once again rally the troops. 1 pro
pose that all of the seniors out there
savor their hangovers the rest of
spring quarter — make sure you real
ly enjoy the final hangovers of your
storied college careers.
Embrace the fact that you might
puke mid-sentence in your upper
level Poli Sci seminar. Love the
headache that makes you think your
temples are entrenched between Star
Jones's legs. Sleep through every bor
ing lecture possible and wake up feel
ing more carefree than ever before.
Either that or stop drinking. But
we all know that's no fun. And if we
stop drinking, our way of life has been
ruined and the terrorists have won.
By God if I'm going to let that happen
to the country I love.
