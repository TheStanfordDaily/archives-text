# OP-ED
## Debating the sexism of 'Kate' 
### LAUREN B. KRAMER 
Yesterday, The Daily ran an op-ed
by Gina Bateson called "Kiss Me
Kate is Sexist," arguing that the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
should have avoided producing the
show because of its negative stereo
typing of women. As the Ram's Head
executive producer and the director
of "Kiss Me Kate," 1 would like to
clarify the meaning of the show, as
well as Ram's Head's purpose in
putting on the production.
Bateson is right. There is sexism in
the show. In fact, there is an awful lot
of it. But it's generated by Shake
speare's famous comedy The Taming
of the Shrew. Because that's what the
subplot of Kiss Me Kate is — it's a
group of actors putting on a produc
tion of Shakespeare's play. And this
play. The Shrew, while often debated
by literary critics, can be read as sexist:
Petruchio sets out to tame a shrew and
gain her money.
This is a simplistic understanding
of the show. Petruchio never claims
that he desires to lord over his wife. In
fact, he tells Katherine's father, "I am
as peremptory as she is proud minded.
And where two raging fires meet to
gether, they do consume the thing that
feeds their fury. So I yield to her and
she yields to me." That sounds to me
like a pretty equitable relationship.
Furthermore, Katherine refuses to
be commodified. Unlike the women
of her time, she will not marry until
she finds a husband worthy of her. de
spite her father's wishes. She is not an
object to be traded: She is willful and
her opinions matter. Additionally,
Katherine is one of the most verbal
characters in The Shrew. She is witty,
easily combating Petruchio in clever
repartee about the role of men and
women. She not only understands
Petruchio's sexual allusions, but even
battles back with clever innuendo of

her own. 1 would say Katherine is
hardly submitting to Petruchio.
OK, OK. This is all well and good.
But this is all before she is married.
And definitely before she sings "I am
Ashamed." True, Katherine does sing
a song about how women are simple
and "offer war where they should
kneel for peace." It is this point in the
play that the greatest contention over
Shakespeare's intention has arisen. Is
Katherine serious or is she sarcastic?
As evidenced by her wink at the
start of the song, I chose to direct the
show with Katherine being sarcastic.
And if you didn't catch her wink, just
watch the ensemble women during
the song. They are hardly submissive
to their husbands. More importantly,
it is at this point in Kiss Me Kate that
Lilli Vanessi shines through the char
acter of Katherine. Remember, after
all, this is a play-within-a play. While
Katherine is singing the song, Lilli is
telling Fred that she has come back to
him, that she is willing to finish the
show of her own volition because she
loves him. Her love is pure; it is what
motivates the song.
So there's the sexism in The Shrew.
Is there sexism backstage, in the Kiss
Me Kate sections? Well. I would claim
that there isn't. Lilli and Fred cannot
be seen as direct parallels of Katherine
and Petruchio. It is Lilli who owned
the apartment she shared with Fred; it
is Lilli's name that allows the perfor
mance of The Shrew to have any
chance of financial success; it is Lilli
who chooses whether the show will be
completed. I would say Lilli is a pow
erful player in her relationship to Fred.
In fact, Fred is not the offstage par
allel to Petruchio at all. The General
is. General Harrison Howell goes so
far as to speak lines that correspond to
Petruchio's. While Petruchio shouts,
"What, no man at the door to hold my
stirrup nor to take my horse?" the
General screams, "What, no man at

the door to take my keys and park my
car?" a scene later. And this is the man
that Lilli chooses to leave. She is unin
terested in spending her life with such
a misogynistic man, and so she rejects
him for Fred.
All right, maybe the show isn't so
sexist. But I'm awfully glad that Gina
thought it was. Because that's the
purpose of art. Works of literature
and art can be and are great precisely
because of their provocative value.
Clearly the show managed to make
Gina and her friends talk about im
portant issues of gender power struc
tures and heterosexuality. That's
what Ram's Head wants.
We know that as a student group
on the campus of one of the nation's
top universities that we are perform
ing fora sophisticated audience. We
desire to facilitate conversation about
issues of sexism and racism; that's why
we chose West Side Story last year,
and why we decided on Kiss Me Kate
this year. And as a prominent mem
ber of Ram's Head, and a key figure in
the production of both shows, I'm
sure glad that Ram's Head is willing to
take a risk and choose shows that have
real issues at their core.
Don't buy into what I say? Come
see the show and decide for yourself.
The show runs April 15,16 and 17 at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium. Tick

play that the greatest contention over
Shakespeare's intention has arisen. Is
Katherine serious or is she sarcastic?
As evidenced by her wink at the
start of the song, I chose to direct the
show with Katherine being sarcastic.
And if you didn't catch her wink, just
watch the ensemble women during
the song. They are hardly submissive
to their husbands. More importantly,
it is at this point in Kiss Me Kate that
Lilli Vanessi shines through the char
acter of Katherine. Remember, after
all, this is a play-within-a play. While
Katherine is singing the song, Lilli is
telling Fred that she has come back to
him, that she is willing to finish the
show of her own volition because she
loves him. Her love is pure; it is what
motivates the song.
So there's the sexism in The Shrew.
Is there sexism backstage, in the Kiss
Me Kate sections? Well. I would claim
that there isn't. Lilli and Fred cannot
be seen as direct parallels of Katherine
and Petruchio. It is Lilli who owned
the apartment she shared with Fred; it
is Lilli's name that allows the perfor
mance of The Shrew to have any
chance of financial success; it is Lilli
who chooses whether the show will be
completed. I would say Lilli is a pow
erful player in her relationship to Fred.
In fact, Fred is not the offstage par
allel to Petruchio at all. The General
is. General Harrison Howell goes so
far as to speak lines that correspond to
Petruchio's. While Petruchio shouts,
"What, no man at the door to hold my
stirrup nor to take my horse?" the
General screams, "What, no man at

the door to take my keys and park my
car?" a scene later. And this is the man
that Lilli chooses to leave. She is unin
terested in spending her life with such
a misogynistic man, and so she rejects
him for Fred.
All right, maybe the show isn't so
sexist. But I'm awfully glad that Gina
thought it was. Because that's the
purpose of art. Works of literature
and art can be and are great precisely
because of their provocative value.
Clearly the show managed to make
Gina and her friends talk about im
portant issues of gender power struc
tures and heterosexuality. That's
what Ram's Head wants.

this year. And as a prominent mem

Yesterday, The Daily ran an op-ed
by Gina Bateson called "Kiss Me
Kate is Sexist," arguing that the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society
should have avoided producing the
show because of its negative stereo
typing of women. As the Ram's Head
executive producer and the director
of "Kiss Me Kate," 1 would like to
clarify the meaning of the show, as
well as Ram's Head's purpose in
putting on the production.
Bateson is right. There is sexism in
the show. In fact, there is an awful lot
of it. But it's generated by Shake
speare's famous comedy The Taming
of the Shrew. Because that's what the
subplot of Kiss Me Kate is — it's a
group of actors putting on a produc
tion of Shakespeare's play. And this
play. The Shrew, while often debated
by literary critics, can be read as sexist:
Petruchio sets out to tame a shrew and
gain her money.
This is a simplistic understanding
of the show. Petruchio never claims
that he desires to lord over his wife. In
fact, he tells Katherine's father, "I am
as peremptory as she is proud minded.
And where two raging fires meet to
gether, they do consume the thing that
feeds their fury. So I yield to her and
she yields to me." That sounds to me
like a pretty equitable relationship.
Furthermore, Katherine refuses to
be commodified. Unlike the women
of her time, she will not marry until
she finds a husband worthy of her. de
spite her father's wishes. She is not an
object to be traded: She is willful and
her opinions matter. Additionally,
Katherine is one of the most verbal
characters in The Shrew. She is witty,
easily combating Petruchio in clever
repartee about the role of men and
women. She not only understands
Petruchio's sexual allusions, but even
battles back with clever innuendo of

her own. 1 would say Katherine is
hardly submitting to Petruchio.
OK, OK. This is all well and good.
But this is all before she is married.
And definitely before she sings "I am
Ashamed." True, Katherine does sing
a song about how women are simple
and "offer war where they should
kneel for peace." It is this point in the
play that the greatest contention over
Shakespeare's intention has arisen. Is
Katherine serious or is she sarcastic?
As evidenced by her wink at the
