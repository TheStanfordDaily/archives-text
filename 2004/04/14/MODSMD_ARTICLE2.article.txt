# Moseley Braun emphasizes the importance of individual action
## Prominent politician shares her opinions on current issues 
### MELANIE CORBETT 
Carol Moseley Braun spoke to the Stanford
community last night about the importance and
power of individuals working toward political and
social justice. The personal experiences she
shared served as examples of the power of a single
person to positively impact society.
Moseley Braun is the Stanford in Government
(SIG) 2004 Big Speaker and her appearance was
organized in collaboration with the ASSU Speak
ers' Bureau.
After beginning her political career in 1978 as
a member of the Illinois state legislature, Moseley
Braun carried her success instate politics to the
national level. She was the first female senator
from Illinois, the first female African-American
senator and the first African-American Democra
tic senator. After serving as a senator for six years,
Moseley Braun became the U.S. Ambassador to
New Zealand.
Political success came to Moseley Braun in
spite of several potential setbacks.
"People told me not to run for office. They
said, 'Blacks won't vote for you because you're
not part of the machine, whites won't vote for you
because you're black and nobody will vote for you
because you're a woman," Moseley Braun said.
Moseley Braun reminded the audience of the
vast progress in race relations that Americans
have achieved. She noted the prevalence of segre
gation and other forms of inequality up until the
Civil Rights laws of the 19605.

"Only in America did the Holocaust take place
at the hands of the 'good guys,' " she said.
Moseley Braun attributes the crucial changes
toward a more just society to individuals taking
action against injustice.
"The climb of opinion was created by people of
goodwill. As long as individuals embrace the ideal
of inclusion, movement in the right direction will
be made," Moseley Braun said. "Every person, ef
fort and voice makes a difference — it is up to us to
make this generation one that transforms."
After concluding her formal speech, Moseley
Braun answered questions from members of the
audience. So many students seized this opportu
nity that the line for questioners eventually had
to be cut off. Moseley Braun's informal respons
es received very positive reactions from the ap
preciative audience.
"Where I really saw [Moseley Braun] shine as
a leader was when she answered people's ques
tions and was off the script," said freshman Jessi
ca Harris.
One topic of interest to students was Moseley
Braun's recent run for the Democratic nomina
tion for president in 2004. Although she had to
close her campaign due to insufficient fundrais
ing, Moseley Braun maintained a positive atti
tude about the experience.
"I came away encouraged about America and
the American people," Moseley Braun said.
People also asked Moseley Braun about her
opinions on specific political issues. When asked
about her views on San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsome's recent sanctioning of gay marriage,
Moseley Braun replied that it was "brilliant," and
that she sees gay marriage in the same terms as in
terracial marriage.
One student asked Moseley Braun what her
exit strategy for leaving Iraq would be if she were
elected president.
"Americans cannot just 'cut and run,' " Mose

ley Braun said. "We must do everything we can to
build an international force for nation-building
and peace-keeping."
Moseley Braun also spoke on the importance
of sparking an interest in public policy among the
impoverished, noting that voting behavior tracks
not with race but with poverty levels.
"Those who need it most understand it
least," Moseley Braun said. "People need
public goods like education and public ser
vices. . . Class plays a huge role that is not
often mentioned."
