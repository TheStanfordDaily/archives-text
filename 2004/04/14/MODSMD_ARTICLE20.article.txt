As long as ifs not hateful,
go ahead and laugh
I'd like to comment on Gina
Bateson's article "Kiss me Kate is
sexist" (April 13) because 1 see a
troubling trend to purge our society
of jokes and sarcasm if they offend
anyone's sensitive nature to even the
slightest degree.
Almost all jokes are exaggera
tions and over-the-top. That's what
makes them funny. So what's wrong
with laughing at ourselves? Would
it be better to hush up all the con
troversial issues and never put them
on display?
Comedy often provides a new
way to look at an emotional or diffi
cult situation, and it may even help
one to stop feeling like a victim all
the time. During the communist

regime in the former Soviet Union,
millions of people were persecuted,
tortured and jailed. Nothing to laugh
about, it seems. However, political
jokes and social satire permeated the
society then and helped lift the at
mosphere of fear, even if only fora
few minutes.
If you look for sexism long and
hard, you'll purge more books and
plays than you ever dreamed
about. One woman I know did not
want her little daughter watching
Disney's "Snow White" because
she felt women were shown as
weak and helpless. (I don't know
why she chose to ignore the evil
queen, who was definitely not help
less and could stand up for herself
quite well.)
The Bible, Three Musketeers and
many of Shakespeare's plays (1 don't

remember Juliet talking about a ca
reer outside of marriage) would all
make the "outlaw" list. As long as
the jokes are not hateful, and you are
in a position to laugh back, laugh —
and don't be afraid.

All plays draw on stereotypes
I am writing in response to Gina
Bateson's article about Kiss Me
Kate. As a woman, an actress, a
singer, 1 am bothered greatly by her
point of view. Let us establish two
points: First, Kiss Me Kate is a com
edy, and second. Kiss Me Kate is
based on Shakespeare's Taming Of
The Shrew.
As a classicist, I spend much

time reading and writing about
Aristophanes, the great sth-centu
ry Athenian playwright. His plays,
regarded by many to be some of
the best pieces of comedy ever,
are wrought with stereotypes. As
are all plays and pieces of litera
ture, from William Shakespeare to
Edward Albe, JRR Tolkien to
Toni Morrison.
No matter what one is writing, the
audience must be able to relate to it.
In order for something to be funny,
the audience must be able to draw on
their own stereotypes. This is what
makes a comedy a comedy or a
tragedy a tragedy. 1 guess when it
comes down to it, no matter what
anything is, it's either racist, sexist or
anti-(insert religion here).
People just need to loosen up,
have a sense of humour. Being able

to laugh, to not over-analyze every
tiny little point might actually do this
world some good.

Column good, headline bad
I applaud Gina Bateson's April
13 column for pointing out the ram
pant sexism in "Kiss Me Kate," for
pointing out how intolerable it
should be and for pointing out that
Ram's Head could have easily fixed
the problem: Don't choose such sex
ist productions.
I'm less impressed with the Opin
ions editor who came up with the
rather obvious " 'Kiss Me Kate' is sex
ist" headline. A glance at the Opin
ions page suggests "lame column

complaining about sexism," rather
than "insightful column complaining
about Ram's Head's choice." Perhaps
a simple change to " 'Kiss Me Kate'
too sexist" would better reveal the
point of Bateson's argument.

the jokes are not hateful, and you are
in a position to laugh back, laugh —
and don't be afraid.

All plays draw on stereotypes
I am writing in response to Gina
Bateson's article about Kiss Me
Kate. As a woman, an actress, a
singer, 1 am bothered greatly by her
point of view. Let us establish two
points: First, Kiss Me Kate is a com
edy, and second. Kiss Me Kate is
based on Shakespeare's Taming Of
The Shrew.
As a classicist, I spend much

time reading and writing about
Aristophanes, the great sth-centu
ry Athenian playwright. His plays,
regarded by many to be some of
the best pieces of comedy ever,
are wrought with stereotypes. As
are all plays and pieces of litera
ture, from William Shakespeare to
Edward Albe, JRR Tolkien to
Toni Morrison.
No matter what one is writing, the
audience must be able to relate to it.
In order for something to be funny,
the audience must be able to draw on
their own stereotypes. This is what
makes a comedy a comedy or a
tragedy a tragedy. 1 guess when it
comes down to it, no matter what
anything is, it's either racist, sexist or
anti-(insert religion here).
People just need to loosen up,
have a sense of humour. Being able

to laugh, to not over-analyze every
tiny little point might actually do this
world some good.

Column good, headline bad
I applaud Gina Bateson's April
13 column for pointing out the ram
pant sexism in "Kiss Me Kate," for
pointing out how intolerable it
should be and for pointing out that
Ram's Head could have easily fixed
the problem: Don't choose such sex
ist productions.
I'm less impressed with the Opin
ions editor who came up with the
rather obvious " 'Kiss Me Kate' is sex
ist" headline. A glance at the Opin
ions page suggests "lame column

complaining about sexism," rather
than "insightful column complaining
about Ram's Head's choice." Perhaps
a simple change to " 'Kiss Me Kate'
too sexist" would better reveal the
point of Bateson's argument.
