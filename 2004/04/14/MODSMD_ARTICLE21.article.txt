## Hell freezes over: Cubbies will win WS 
### 
In addition to roundly ensuring that the
Cubs will not, in fact, be crowned
World Champions come October,
Sports Illustrated kicked off another
baseball season in its own bombastic way last
weekend, giving hope to millions of faithful
Cubs fans.
Of course, their giddiness lasted right up
until ace Mark Prior injured his Achilles ten
don, two weeks before the season actually
started. At best, the Cubs will hold out until
September, when God will have to find an even
more unbelievable method than fan interfer
ence to squash their hopes — perhaps a holt of
lightning striking a runner rounding third or a
meteorite hurtling into Corey Patterson just
before he catches a fly ball.
In terms of raw probability, of course,
the Cubs' epic streak of failure is an
aberration, leading many diehards to be
lieve that the franchise is cursed. During

the 1945 World Series,
with the Cubs leading in
Game 6, a fan was thrown
out of the game for refus
ing to abandon his billy
goat. Upon leaving, he
cursed the team, proclaim
ing that they would never
again win the National
League pennant — and
they haven't since.

This curse, then, is obviously the reason
the Cubs haven't won the National League
since William Howard Taft was the presi
dent and there were 46 states. It is this sort of
reasonable thinking that pervades the minds
of many otherwise rational Chicagoans, al
lowing them some sort of solace from the
Cubs' failures.
However, there appears to be another fair
ly plausible explanation: The Cubs have been
bad — and not just comically bad, but avert
your-eyes bad. At age 12, before going to the
beach on summer afternoons, I would often sit
in the garage and watch the Cubbies lose game
after game. I got to know the names of more
National League closers than most general
managers, just by watching them repeatedly
shut down Cubs hitters in the bottom of the
ninth at Wrigley.
The games are now blurred together in
my memory; The Pirates or Phillies or
Padres would jump out to an early 5-0 lead,
and the Cubs would come battling back on
the bats of Mark Grace and Sammy Sosa,
only to have an untimely error or a pitching
collapse end their hopes late in the game,
leaving Harry Caray to blubber aimlessly
about tomorrow's possibilities. By July, the
Cubs would be hopelessly out of contention
with a .400 winning percentage and the divi
sion title would be nothing more than a
pleasant daydream.
There are certainly other teams that are
actually worse than the Cubs. The Astros,
Brewers, Padres, Rockies, Expos,
Mariners, Rangers and Devil Rays have
never won a World Series, making them
technically a more pathetic collective than
the Cubs. But even then, the oldest of these
teams, the Astros, have been in existence
for only a third of the time that the Cubs
have been around, and they still have the
same number of championship rings to
show for the last 95 years.
But America, in what seems like direct
contradiction of God's infallible will, most
definitely loves the Cubs. The Brewers and
Rangers are just losers; the Cubs are lovable
losers. This is an important distinction. Losing
without panache is dull: When the Pirates
lose, manager Lloyd McClendon talks about
taking it one game at a time and rebuilding,
despite 10 consecutive "rebuilding" (read:
sub-,500) seasons.
But the Cubs lose fantastically; their
failure is such a foregone conclusion that
the finer points of the loss itself can be ap
preciated. Who else but the Cubs could
have produced the Steve Bartman inci
dent? Watching the Cubs lose is the oppo
site of appreciating a fine wine — it's like
watching a car accident in progress. It's
horrifying, yet gruesomely riveting, and
you can't help but watch and sympathize
with the poor souls inside. And unlike the
Red Sox, they lose with such reckless aban
don that when they come close to victory it
is something to be celebrated, rather than a
cue to break out the handkerchiefs for the
inevitable pity party.
It may be that we actually need the Cubs
to lose. Regardless of whether the Cubs ever
win the Series, we draw strength from their
weakness. They are baseball's incarnation of
the phrase "hope springs eternal." constantly
waiting til next year, and constantly renew
ing optimism.
Let me spoil the ending here — the Cubs
will lose this year, and they will lose spectacu
larly. But life will go on, and the Cubs will re
turn next March with unbridled hope. It is, in
fact, whether you win or lose. But the way the
Cubs play the game makes them losers in the
best possible way.

teams, the Astros, have been in existence
for only a third of the time that the Cubs
have been around, and they still have the
same number of championship rings to
show for the last 95 years.
But America, in what seems like direct
contradiction of God's infallible will, most
definitely loves the Cubs. The Brewers and
Rangers are just losers; the Cubs are lovable
losers. This is an important distinction. Losing
without panache is dull: When the Pirates
lose, manager Lloyd McClendon talks about
taking it one game at a time and rebuilding,
despite 10 consecutive "rebuilding" (read:
sub-,500) seasons.
But the Cubs lose fantastically; their
failure is such a foregone conclusion that
the finer points of the loss itself can be ap
preciated. Who else but the Cubs could
have produced the Steve Bartman inci
dent? Watching the Cubs lose is the oppo
site of appreciating a fine wine — it's like
watching a car accident in progress. It's
horrifying, yet gruesomely riveting, and
you can't help but watch and sympathize
with the poor souls inside. And unlike the
Red Sox, they lose with such reckless aban
don that when they come close to victory it
is something to be celebrated, rather than a
cue to break out the handkerchiefs for the
inevitable pity party.
It may be that we actually need the Cubs
to lose. Regardless of whether the Cubs ever
win the Series, we draw strength from their
weakness. They are baseball's incarnation of
the phrase "hope springs eternal." constantly
waiting til next year, and constantly renew
ing optimism.
Let me spoil the ending here — the Cubs
will lose this year, and they will lose spectacu
larly. But life will go on, and the Cubs will re
turn next March with unbridled hope. It is, in
fact, whether you win or lose. But the way the
Cubs play the game makes them losers in the
best possible way.

In addition to roundly ensuring that the
Cubs will not, in fact, be crowned
World Champions come October,
Sports Illustrated kicked off another
baseball season in its own bombastic way last
weekend, giving hope to millions of faithful
Cubs fans.
Of course, their giddiness lasted right up
until ace Mark Prior injured his Achilles ten
don, two weeks before the season actually
started. At best, the Cubs will hold out until
September, when God will have to find an even
more unbelievable method than fan interfer
ence to squash their hopes — perhaps a holt of
lightning striking a runner rounding third or a
meteorite hurtling into Corey Patterson just
before he catches a fly ball.
In terms of raw probability, of course,
the Cubs' epic streak of failure is an
aberration, leading many diehards to be
lieve that the franchise is cursed. During

the 1945 World Series,
with the Cubs leading in
Game 6, a fan was thrown
out of the game for refus
ing to abandon his billy
goat. Upon leaving, he
cursed the team, proclaim
ing that they would never
again win the National
League pennant — and
they haven't since.

This curse, then, is obviously the reason
the Cubs haven't won the National League
since William Howard Taft was the presi
dent and there were 46 states. It is this sort of
reasonable thinking that pervades the minds
of many otherwise rational Chicagoans, al
lowing them some sort of solace from the
Cubs' failures.
However, there appears to be another fair
ly plausible explanation: The Cubs have been
bad — and not just comically bad, but avert
your-eyes bad. At age 12, before going to the
beach on summer afternoons, I would often sit
in the garage and watch the Cubbies lose game
after game. I got to know the names of more
National League closers than most general
managers, just by watching them repeatedly
shut down Cubs hitters in the bottom of the
ninth at Wrigley.
The games are now blurred together in
my memory; The Pirates or Phillies or
Padres would jump out to an early 5-0 lead,
and the Cubs would come battling back on
the bats of Mark Grace and Sammy Sosa,
only to have an untimely error or a pitching
collapse end their hopes late in the game,
leaving Harry Caray to blubber aimlessly
about tomorrow's possibilities. By July, the
Cubs would be hopelessly out of contention
with a .400 winning percentage and the divi
sion title would be nothing more than a
pleasant daydream.
There are certainly other teams that are
actually worse than the Cubs. The Astros,
Brewers, Padres, Rockies, Expos,
Mariners, Rangers and Devil Rays have
never won a World Series, making them
technically a more pathetic collective than
the Cubs. But even then, the oldest of these
teams, the Astros, have been in existence
for only a third of the time that the Cubs
have been around, and they still have the
same number of championship rings to
show for the last 95 years.
