# Home runs power Card over SC, 12-3
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
Last season, senior centerfielder Sam Fuld scored 83 runs, tying former Car
dinal Jeffrey Hammonds for most by a Stanford player in a single season. That
stat, coupled with the impressive numbers Fuld posted during his rookie and
sophomore campaigns, made it clear that the lefthander is the quintessential
leadoff hitter.
Last night, Fuld made a case for himself as the best leadoff hitter in Stan
ford history.
In the sixth inning of the No. 2 Cardinal's 12-3 victory over Santa Clara (16-20),
Fuld crossed the plate for the 244 th time in his career, tying him with former Stan
ford player Mark Davis (1983-86) for the school's all-time runs record.
"We've had a lot of run producers in the four years that I've been here and
most of this is because of them," Fuld said after being informed that he had tied
the runs mark.
Actually, his first response was a confused, "What [runs] mark?"
"(Fuld's] been a great player for us for four years," said Stanford head coach
Mark Marquess. "He's very consistent and he's worked hard for this."
The win was a power-hitting frenzy for the Cardinal (26-5,4-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference), which racked up seven runs in the first two frames — five of which were
knocked in by home runs.
Junior Danny Putnam hit his three-run shot over the left field wall in the bot
tom of the first-an inning in which Stanford batted through the entire order.
The Cardinal's second jack of the night belonged to sophomore Jed Lowrie,
who belted his 10th of the season with senior Jonny Ash already aboard in the sec
ond inning. The homer puts Lowrie one off the Pac-10 leader, Washington State's
Grant Richardson.
Stanford has now hit 49 home runs this season, putting the squad on pace to
break the single-season team record of 102.
The Broncos were also swinging for the fences, and designated hitter Nathan
Faulkner managed a two-run homer in the second off freshman righthander
Matt Leva.
But as Santa Clara's 18-4 loss to the Cardinal last month showed, the Broncos
just can't match Stanford's offensive sting, which produced 13 hits to the Broncos'
six. Faulkner was the only Santa Clara player to hit more than once.
Stanford had an all-around offensive effort, amassing seven hits from its first
five batters and six from its last four hitters.

Lowrie went 3-for-4 with a walk on the night, displaying the offensive dominance that
Stanford fans have learned to expect from him.
The real surprise of the night was from the only other Cardinal player with a multi-hit
game — sophomore catcher John Hester.
A highly pursued recruit that Marquess said at the season's beginning would be

starting at most other Division I programs, Hester proved his worth at the plate last
night. In just his second start of the year, Hester went 3-for-5 with three RBIs and a run.
"We're an incredibly deep team," said junior designated hitter Chris Carter, who
added a hit and two runs from the number seven spot. "You can take a lot of these guys

and put them on other teams and
they'll just be superstars. We've got a
lot of talent, guys who you can pull of
the bench and they'll produce."
The Cardinal showed the depth
of its pitching staff as well. Leva,
the first of five Stanford pitchers
to make an appearance, garnered
his third win of the year after giv
ing up two hits in two innings with

no walks and one strikeout.

David O'Hagan threw a com

while freshman Greg Reynolds

the mound, throwing two strong

first frame.
