# Gymnastics set for Nationals
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
Senior Lise Leveille, who led the No. 2 Stanford
women's gymnastics team to victory at the North Cen
tral Regional two weekends ago, was touching up her
uneven bars routine on Monday afternoon. It was the
last practice before this weekend's NCAA Nationals
and the final practice period for Leveille and her four
fellow seniors.
The former Canadian Olympian swung through all
her moves with pointed toes, straight legs and her
teammates cheering, "C'mon Levy" in the back
ground. After releasing the bar for her double layout
dismount and sticking the landing, Leveille flopped
down face first on the soft mat in front of her with a lit
tle sigh.
"Don't do that in the meet," joked sophomore Natal
ie Foley as she chalked up her grips. Leveille laughed
and did one last routine, this time throwing her arms up
for the finish with a triumphant smile.
Leveille and her teammates are looking to similarly
redeem themselves at Nationals this weekend after a dis
appointing showing last year. Tomorrow is the prelimi
nary day of competition — 12 teams compete, but only
six qualify to compete at team finals on Friday. Stanford
broke into the Super Six for the first time two years ago,
but fell short last year and had to watch the meet from
the sidelines.
"It was hard to have such a great season and then not
put it together when it really counted," said Leveille,
who had turned in disappointing performances on both
floor exercise and balance beam in the preliminaries last
year. "We had to watch teams that we were better than
compete out there while we sat on the side. We took a lot
from what we felt that day and used it to become a bet
ter team."
"It lit a little fire in them," said head coach Kristen Smyth.
Stanford has had its best season yet this year, earning

its highest-ever ranking and wining the Pacific-10 Cham
pionships and North Central Regional. The Cardinal's
strong performance has landed the team in good posi
tion to qualify for the Super Six. The team faces a less
competitive preliminary bracket this year, competing
against No. 2 seed Georgia, fifth-seeded Oklahoma, No.
6 seed Florida, No. 11 seed Nebraska and 16th-seeded
lowa at the preliminary meet.
Stanford is seeded No. 9 entering the preliminary
meet according to the scores at Regionals, but the team
was ranked No. 2 at the end of the regular season —
ahead of all the teams that it will face on Thursday.
"We've had an amazing season and we're going to go
out on Thursday night and put it all on the line," Leveille
said. "We're not going to hold anything back. We're
going to go for the win and not let the nerves get to us."
In order to snatch the first national championship in
Cardinal history, Stanford will have to vault over top
ranked UCLA. It will not be an easy task, because the
Bruins are competing at home in Pauley Pavilion, where
they posted the highest home score in the nation this
year— 198.875 — the very same score that Stanford
earned at its last home meet.
Stanford lost to UCLA by over a point at Pauley
Pavilion early in the regular season, but the two teams
were neck and neck near the season's end — Stanford's
average team score over the last three regular season
meets was 198.17 to UCLA's 198.10. The Cardinal de
feated the Bruins three weeks ago at the Pac-10 Cham
pionships by a slim margin of 0.025.
In addition to its team aspirations, the Cardinal has a
good chance at claiming some individual titles. Among
other contenders, Foley is strong in the all-around and
senior Lindsay Wing is in the running on balance beam.
Foley is this year's Pac-10 all-around champion and
Wing has been Pac-10 beam champion for all four years
of her career. Gymnasts will qualify to event finals based

on their scores on Thursday and
event finals will be held on Saturday.
Personally, Leveille wants to hit
her beam routine and her floor rou

tine during the team competition on
Thursday to make up for her perfor
mance last year.
"1 want to be more confident
personally in what I do," she said.
"My confidence was there all along,
I just lost it fora bit last year. I know
I can do it and I want to end on a
good note."
