## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday's game against No. 25 Pep
perdine was the first of three matches in
line for the No. 11 Stanford men's tennis
team (15-6) in this week's Stanford Chal
lenge. It proved to be more of a challenge
for Pepperdine (15-8), as they watched the
match slip away to the Cardinal, 5-2.
"They're a good team, [so) it was an im
portant win for seedings for the NCAAs,"
said junior Sam Warburg. "We've been on
the road for the last two weeks, so there's
nothing like playing in your own house."
Doubles action was heated, with two
close matches in the top two spots.
On the No. 1 court, the No. 34 pair of se
nior Carter Morris and junior Sam War

burg seemed to take control of its match
early against Pepperdine's No. 22 team of
senior Calle Hansen and sophomore Pedro
Rico.
Morris / Warburg lost their rhythm a
little and fell behind, 5-4. It was a close
match, with both sides making impressive
shots, but the Stanford team prevailed,
winning 9-8 with a first-rate showing of
passing shots and impressive shot place
ment.
Sophomore All-American K.C.
Corkery and junior Phil Sheng played
for the third time together, hoping fora
third straight win, but were unable to
outplay Pepperdine's No. 42 team of
sophomore Scott Doerner and senior
Alexandre Herrera.
The two teams battled back and forth.

but the Waves eventually overcame the
Cardinal, 9-8.
Pepperdine sophomore Kevin Borzen
ski and freshman Justin Montgomery put
up almost no resistance to Stanford sopho
more James Pade and freshman James
Wan. The Cardinal team was the first to
leave the courts after collecting an 8-3 win.
"I was really pleased we won the dou
bles point, it was really a battle," said Stan
ford head coach Dick Gould. "In all three
doubles matches, the teams never let up.
That was a great effort by James and
James. Phil and K.C. started very slow in
doubles, but they battled back and got into
the match. Carter and Sam lost their lead
but stuck with it and ended up winning the
doubles (point) for us."
Stanford's No. 85 Wan was once again

the first to win a match, this time in singles.
Wan sailed by the Herrera at the No. 3
spot, 6-1,6-1. His record improved to 22-0
for the 2003-2004 dual match season.
"I saw K.C.'s [21-1 j record last year,
and that was pretty much my goal this
year, to try and match that." Wan said. "I
haven't played this high in the lineup for
much of year, so we'll see how it goes. I
love playing here [at Stanford]."
At the No. 1 spot. No. 11 Warburg had
an energized match against No. 45
Hansen, with both hard hitters showing al
most equal strength on the courts. War
burg prevailed in the decisive tiebreak,
winning, 6-2,7-6(7-2).
No. 110 Corkery and Pepperdine's No.
22 Rico
had a
few dis
"agree-
ments
on the

court, but the match swung in Corkery's
favor when the Stanford sophomore
grabbed a 6-4, 4-6, 4-1 win. Rico retired in
the third set due to an injury.

Sophomore Pade overtook Richard
Johnson in two sets, downing the freshman,
6-2,7-6.
In the losses, Morris fell to junior Alexis
Rafidison, 6-4, 6-1, while teammate Sheng
took a 6-4,6-3 loss to Doerner.
This match has snapped Pepperdine's
three-game winning streak, dropping
them to a 4-24 record against Stanford
all-time.
