# Lacrosse splits weekend

### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After last week's blowout loss to Notre
Dame de Namur, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team knew that it needed to grab a
win in order to keep its West Coast Lacrosse
League playoff hopes alive.
The team kept that playoff door open
just a crack after defeating UC-Davis in a
double-overtime thriller, 9-8, on Satur
day before losing to Sonoma State, 16-3,
on Sunday.
The unranked Cardinal (5-7, 3-2 West
Coast Lacrosse League North), which sits in
fourth place in the WCLL North, will need
to beat rival California on Saturday to hold
on to the fourth and final playoff spot. With
the Golden Bears just a game behind the
Cardinal in the standings, Saturday's game
will determine which of the two will be
headed to the play-offs and which squad will
be headed home.
"Whatever the case, we have to win to
get to the playoffs," said sophomore goal
tender Michael Zell of his team's upcoming

game against Cal.
Against Davis last weekend, the Cardi
nal showed why it can be considered a le
gitimate threat if it indeed does make the
playoffs. With senior K.C. Lukens and
sophomore Brian Goodman in the lineup,
the defense looked perhaps as strong as it
has all year.
Goodman, who played the entire game
with a broken foot, led the defense in allow
ing just eight Davis goals.
Even more impressive, the Cardinal
defense held the Aggies to just three
shots on goal in the two overtime periods
combined. Before that, the Aggies had
been averaging more than 10 shots on
goal per period.
Sophomore midfielder Tyler Gutier
rez, who dominated Davis on face-offs,
scored two goals, while fellow sophomore
attacker Alex Choo added three goals for
the hat trick.
It was junior attacker Brooks Kinkaid
who stole the show, however, scoring the
game-winner in the second overtime.
"We outplayed them the whole game.

but were unable to score, allowing the game
to remain close," said Zell of the team's per
formance. "A win is a win and we will most
certainly take it."
While the Cardinal put up an impres
sive showing against Davis, it was un
able to do the same against national No.
5 Sonoma State. Despite 19 saves by
Zell, the offense was unable to find the
net, scoring only three times on fewer
than 15 shots.
The Cardinal, should it win on Saturday,
will most likely face Sonoma State again in
the first round of the WCLL playoffs.
Perhaps the Cardinal's biggest prob
lem this year has been its inability to beat
tougher competition. The Cardinal is just
1-5 against teams ranked in the top 25
this season, having lost to the likes of
Loyola-Marymount, Simon Fraser and
Cal Poly. Its only top-25 victory came
early in the season against the then-No.

The Cardinal will look to clinch its sec
ond straight WCLL playoff berth with a win
in Berkeley on Saturday at 2 p.m.
