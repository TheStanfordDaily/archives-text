### MARISA C. JU√ÅREZ 
Stanford Mock Trial recently
placed first in the American
Mock Trial Association's 2004
First Tier National Tournament
in lowa.
The team consists of three
freshmen, two sophomores, two
juniors and one senior. Each
member of the team takes on a
role, from attorney to witness,
and they often share roles since
teams cannot have more than
eight members.
Freshman John Fowler ex
plained how inexperienced the
young team was.
"Half our team had never
done |Mock Trial] before"
Fowler said.
Even as they met older, more
experienced teams from other
schools around the country, Stan
ford's team did not lose hope.
"The competition gets
your adrenaline pumping,"
Fowler added.
As it proceeded from com

petition to competition, team
members said they remained
dedicated and determined.
After receiving its case in Sep
tember from the Board of
Mock Trial, the team pre
pared year-round for the re
cent competitions. Although
it is a long process and in
volves a lot of work, students
in Mock Trial said they are
drawn to the group because of
the teamwork and chance to
make friends.
"You get really close with the
other seven people on your
team," Fowler said. "You spend
a lot of time with them."
Apart from preparing for
the national competition, the
Stanford group also hosts a
Mock Trial Symposium in the
fall for high school students
in the greater Bay Area. The
group is sponsored by a Stan
ford law professor and some
times receives help from law
students, but is mostly stu
dent run
