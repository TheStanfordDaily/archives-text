# Harvard, Princeton alter financial aid polity

### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
In an attempt to encourage low-income student enrollment, Ivy
League schools like Harvard University and Princeton University have
eliminated parental contribution requirements for low earnings house
holds. While Stanford has not changed its financial aid policy, adminis
tration officials say that most of Stanford's financial aid packages are still
stronger than those of the University's peers'.
The new Harvard and Princeton policies eliminate any parental contribu
tion expectations for families earning less than $40,000 per year and alleviate
contribution requirements for families of incomes between $40,000 and
$60,(XX). Princeton has also eliminated loans expectations as an attempt to re
duce the burden of graduating with debt.
In an announcement to the American Council of Education, Harvard
President Lawrence Summers said that this new financial aid model reem
phasizes Harvard's commitment to reaching out to a broad range of students
of different financial circumstances.
"The gap in income for going to college has risen from 31 percent in 1979
to 66 percent in 1997," Summers said. "Sharp increases in inequality and
their relation to education are a serious concern."
Stanford and the Ivy Leagues have traditionally relied upon need-blind
admissions standards, meaning that a student's acceptance is not contingent

on his or her financial situation. Stanford does acknowledge that nuances of
students' circumstances can be seen in their application and admissions offi
cers take this into consideration in their decision.
"We do give affirmative weight to students from low-income back
grounds," said Dean of Admission and Financial Aid Robin Mamlet. "We
have always considered students who have come from a less advantaged
background."
University officials stressed Stanford's commitment to diversifying the
student body, not just racially and ethnically but also economically. In order
to attract candidates from low-income households, Stanford has made a con
certed effort to develop comprehensive financial aid packages for students.
"Stanford financial aid has gone up considerably ever year," Mamlet said.
"Most of our financial aid packages are still stronger than our peers' because
we do not have as heavy summer expectations and term-time work."
While the changes in Princeton's and Harvard's financial aid policies
aim to reduce some of the barriers for low-income students, they com
pensate by adding to other aspects of the financial aid package like self
help expectations.
Mamlet said that students who must choose between Stanford and its
peers do not turn to other alternatives because of the financial aid packages.
She added that Stanford continues to seek out students from diverse back
grounds and attempts to give them the strongest financial aid possible to
meet individual needs.
