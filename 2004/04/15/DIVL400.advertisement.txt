Florance, a speech-language pathologist in
Ohio, was holding her newborn son, Whitney,
when she suspected something was wrong -
he wasn't at all responsive. As time passed, her
suspicions only worsened; loud noises didn't
startle him, he made no sounds and he seemed
detached. Believing that labeling a problem
leads to a focus on the negative, Florance
rejected the diagnosis of autism, but that
didn't make the symptoms-frequent bouts of
perseverating behavior ("persistent repetition of
a verbal or motor response"), insistence on
complicated rituals, aloofness, etc.-disappear.
Focusing on the positive did help her notice
signs of Whitney's intelligence, though. He'd
destroy a household appliance, but was
fascinated with its inner workings. He'd wander
off unpredictably, but find his way to a shop
they'd visited only once. Florance began to
theorize that Whitney's visual thought process
was so advanced, it had shut down his verbal
ability. Together with her two older children,
she developed a method of teaching Whitney
to read and to think sequentially based on
visual, rather than verbal cues. Inspired
by Helen Keller and determined not to
institutionalize Whitney, the family found
techniques to teach Whitney to read, talk,
interact with others and function successfully in
mainstream classrooms. Florance and Whitney,
now age 17, are together using their tech
niques to help other "maverick minds" (their
term for people with high visual/
associational thought processes and low
verbal/sequencing processing) to function
better in our verbally oriented world. Florance's
insights into cognitive development will
intrigue general readers, and parents of
"disturbed" children will admire the author's
perseverance.
