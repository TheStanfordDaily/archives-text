# New senators promise improved communication
## 
### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ, JR. CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week's ASSU election saw a remarkable turnover rate
for the Undergraduate Senate, with only one of 15 senators re
turning next year. The newly elected senators said they hope to
use their diverse representation to lower living expenses, tack
le the special-fees crisis and bridge the gap in student-Senate
relations.
Conscious of a rift between Senate proceedings and student
involvement, several of the new ASSU senators cited their de
sire to engage the Stanford student community in Senate issues.
Freshman Omar Shakir, who led the election with the largest
number of votes, said he ran because he felt that Senate-student
relations were weakening. Lauren Graham, also a freshman,
said that this issue is one of her primary concerns.
"This is a University hot topic," Graham said. *'My main goal
is to involve the common student and inform them of how the
Senate works. With greater student participation, 1 believe
things will run much more effectively."

Also characteristic
of next year's under
graduate senators is an
expressed desire to im
prove the quality of
student life. Their
ideas include simplify
ing the card-currency
process, lowering the
costs of laundry and In
ternet service bills, as
well as bringing new
and popular services to
Tresidder.
Some of the sena
tors cited ethnic aware
ness and minority sup
port as an integral part
of their agenda. Ac
cording to freshman
Adia Gooden, cultural
and racial misconcep
tions can be countered
through education and
group interaction.
"Though there are
programs that deal
with multiculturalism,
there is not enough ex
change of information
and education between
groups," Gooden said.
"This lack of interac
tion has caused misun
derstanding on cam
pus, which needs to be
eliminated."
Freshman Luz
Reyes said she hopes
to represent issues fac
ing Stanford's Hispanic

community, particular
ly because MEChA was the only Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) group not given special fees.
"Ultimately, I hope to bring to light Hispanic interests and to
end misunderstandings about the goals of this community,"
Reyes said.
Senators frequently took an inclusive approach when dis-
cussing special fees and group funding. Freshman
Anita Mukherjee said she wants to reduce special
fees so that Stanford can continue to fund student
groups.
"A lot of student groups are severely under
funded by the University," Mukherjee said. "To
reduce special fees, I will work with the Music De
partment to fund its own classes and the Athletics
Department to financially support some of the
special-fees groups that directly benefit athletics."
Gooden also had ideas to address the special
fees difficulties.
"Without funding these groups will be unable
to put on any events," Gooden said. "In order to
help lower the cost, one important step is to re
duce the amount of money that it costs to rent out
different facilities."
When asked about the controversy surround

ing ASSU's executive election, the new senators
expressed a variety of opinions but were mainly
concerned that it would jeopardize the integrity
and reputation of future ASSU elections.
Graham said that the election-review process
should not be viewed as an individual attack on
any of the candidates, but as a sign that the in
tegrity of ASSU elections cannot be damaged.
Other senators, such as sophomore Daniel
Stringer, believe that whatever slate wins, the
ASSU will remain in good hands.
"While I personally voted Ajani Husbands and
Alyssa Schwartz, if the Senate votes to certify the
results of the elections, then we are going to have
to accept their decision," Stringer said. "Regard
less of which slate I preferred, I think either slate
[offers] good executive leaders."
In spite of the election controversy, Shakir
said he remains optimistic about the upcoming
year.
"I hope to get to know my fellow senators well
and begin to set our goals for the year ahead,"
Shakir said. "I anticipate getting started right
away to meet these goals and creating an efficient
system that will allow us to be successful."
"If [the Undergraduate Senate] certifies the
election, I think it would be difficult for us not to
certify it considering that the Undergraduate Sen
ate is closer to the violations and many more un
dergraduates voted than graduates," said GSC fi
nancial officer Travis Hopp. a student at the
Graduate School of Business. "I think it would be
a very strange message if we didn't certify the
election."
Adding to that, Martin said that while she had
heard various thoughts from students on campus,
she had not heard anything from graduate students.
"We don't know what graduate students
think of this," she said. "I haven't received any
e-mails from graduate students at all."

Shakir said. "I anticipate getting started right
away to meet these goals and creating an efficient
system that will allow us to be successful."
"If [the Undergraduate Senate] certifies the
election, I think it would be difficult for us not to
certify it considering that the Undergraduate Sen
ate is closer to the violations and many more un
dergraduates voted than graduates," said GSC fi
nancial officer Travis Hopp. a student at the
Graduate School of Business. "I think it would be
a very strange message if we didn't certify the
election."
Adding to that, Martin said that while she had
heard various thoughts from students on campus,
she had not heard anything from graduate students.
"We don't know what graduate students
think of this," she said. "I haven't received any
e-mails from graduate students at all."
Last week's ASSU election saw a remarkable turnover rate
for the Undergraduate Senate, with only one of 15 senators re
turning next year. The newly elected senators said they hope to
use their diverse representation to lower living expenses, tack
le the special-fees crisis and bridge the gap in student-Senate
relations.
Conscious of a rift between Senate proceedings and student
involvement, several of the new ASSU senators cited their de
sire to engage the Stanford student community in Senate issues.
Freshman Omar Shakir, who led the election with the largest
number of votes, said he ran because he felt that Senate-student
relations were weakening. Lauren Graham, also a freshman,
said that this issue is one of her primary concerns.
"This is a University hot topic," Graham said. *'My main goal
is to involve the common student and inform them of how the
Senate works. With greater student participation, 1 believe
things will run much more effectively."

Also characteristic
of next year's under
graduate senators is an
expressed desire to im
prove the quality of
student life. Their
ideas include simplify
ing the card-currency
process, lowering the
costs of laundry and In
ternet service bills, as
well as bringing new
and popular services to
Tresidder.
Some of the sena
tors cited ethnic aware
ness and minority sup
port as an integral part
of their agenda. Ac
cording to freshman
Adia Gooden, cultural
and racial misconcep
tions can be countered
through education and
group interaction.
"Though there are
programs that deal
with multiculturalism,
there is not enough ex
change of information
and education between
groups," Gooden said.
"This lack of interac
tion has caused misun
derstanding on cam
pus, which needs to be
eliminated."
Freshman Luz
Reyes said she hopes
to represent issues fac
ing Stanford's Hispanic

community, particular
ly because MEChA was the only Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) group not given special fees.
"Ultimately, I hope to bring to light Hispanic interests and to
end misunderstandings about the goals of this community,"
Reyes said.
Senators frequently took an inclusive approach when dis-
cussing special fees and group funding. Freshman
Anita Mukherjee said she wants to reduce special
fees so that Stanford can continue to fund student
groups.
"A lot of student groups are severely under
funded by the University," Mukherjee said. "To
reduce special fees, I will work with the Music De
partment to fund its own classes and the Athletics
Department to financially support some of the
special-fees groups that directly benefit athletics."
Gooden also had ideas to address the special
fees difficulties.
"Without funding these groups will be unable
to put on any events," Gooden said. "In order to
help lower the cost, one important step is to re
duce the amount of money that it costs to rent out
different facilities."
When asked about the controversy surround

ing ASSU's executive election, the new senators
expressed a variety of opinions but were mainly
concerned that it would jeopardize the integrity
and reputation of future ASSU elections.
Graham said that the election-review process
should not be viewed as an individual attack on
any of the candidates, but as a sign that the in
tegrity of ASSU elections cannot be damaged.
Other senators, such as sophomore Daniel
Stringer, believe that whatever slate wins, the
ASSU will remain in good hands.
"While I personally voted Ajani Husbands and
Alyssa Schwartz, if the Senate votes to certify the
results of the elections, then we are going to have
to accept their decision," Stringer said. "Regard
less of which slate I preferred, I think either slate
[offers] good executive leaders."
In spite of the election controversy, Shakir
said he remains optimistic about the upcoming
year.
"I hope to get to know my fellow senators well
and begin to set our goals for the year ahead,"
Shakir said. "I anticipate getting started right
away to meet these goals and creating an efficient
system that will allow us to be successful."
