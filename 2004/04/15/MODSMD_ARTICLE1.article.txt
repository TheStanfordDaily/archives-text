# New senators promise improved communication

Last week's ASSU election saw a remarkable turnover rate
for the Undergraduate Senate, with only one of 15 senators re
turning next year. The newly elected senators said they hope to
use their diverse representation to lower living expenses, tack
le the special-fees crisis and bridge the gap in student-Senate
relations.
Conscious of a rift between Senate proceedings and student
involvement, several of the new ASSU senators cited their de
sire to engage the Stanford student community in Senate issues.
Freshman Omar Shakir, who led the election with the largest
number of votes, said he ran because he felt that Senate-student
relations were weakening. Lauren Graham, also a freshman,
said that this issue is one of her primary concerns.
"This is a University hot topic," Graham said. *'My main goal
is to involve the common student and inform them of how the
Senate works. With greater student participation, 1 believe
things will run much more effectively."

Also characteristic
of next year's under
graduate senators is an
expressed desire to im
prove the quality of
student life. Their
ideas include simplify
ing the card-currency
process, lowering the
costs of laundry and In
ternet service bills, as
well as bringing new
and popular services to
Tresidder.
Some of the sena
tors cited ethnic aware
ness and minority sup
port as an integral part
of their agenda. Ac
cording to freshman
Adia Gooden, cultural
and racial misconcep
tions can be countered
through education and
group interaction.
"Though there are
programs that deal
with multiculturalism,
there is not enough ex
change of information
and education between
groups," Gooden said.
"This lack of interac
tion has caused misun
derstanding on cam
pus, which needs to be
eliminated."
Freshman Luz
Reyes said she hopes
to represent issues fac

community, particular
ly because MEChA was the only Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) group not given special fees.
"Ultimately, I hope to bring to light Hispanic interests and to
end misunderstandings about the goals of this community,"
Reyes said.
Senators frequently took an inclusive approach when dis-
