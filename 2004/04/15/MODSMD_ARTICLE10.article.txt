Imagine that at the age of 15 you were
violently sexually assaulted. Ever since,
you have been unable to enter into a
close relationship, as any intimate con
tact provokes strings of vivid nightmares
and flashbacks during which you remem
ber each moment of the attack in excru
ciating detail. At some point, you would
likely visit a psychiatrist who would diag
nose you with post-traumatic stress dis
order (PTSD).
But what if you could go back to the
hours after the episode and take pills
that would make your memory of the
event cloudy?
Memory researchers have recently
begun to use medications known as
beta-blockers, traditionally used to
treat high blood pressure, in an attempt

to prevent the
onset of PTSD.
According to the
National Center
for PTSD, the
disorder is char-

What
it you

acterized by nightmares, flashbacks,
difficulty sleeping, detachment and es
trangement following the experience of
"life-threatening events such as mili
tary combat, natural disasters, terrorist
incidents, serious accidents or violent
personal assaults such as rape."
While findings of such memory manipu
lation research are still speculative, ethicists
have begun to question how dabbling with
the formation of memory might redefine
what it means to be human. This research is
particularly relevant to public concern fol
lowing the release of such films as "Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" that present
a science fiction view of memory erasure.
How could such a pill be explained?
The research of James McGaugh, director
of the Center for the Neurobiology of
Learning and Memory at the UC-Irvine,
has demonstrated that we are more likely
to remember events that are emotionally
arousing. Think about the morning of
Sept. 11. The events of that morning —
where you were, what you were doing, who
you were with — may be crystal clear in
your mind. If you could block the emotion,
could you also block out the memory?
"There is evidence that blocking the
emotional arousal also blocks this emo
tion-mediated increase in recollection,"
said David Speigel, professor of psychol
ogy and associate chair of the Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences at School of
Medicine here at Stanford.
Physicians have been "blocking the
emotional arousal" of patients with high
blood pressure for years through the use

"New drugs could be used to
manipulate emotional memory,
alleviating symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder"

of drugs called beta
blockers. According
to Speigel, one com
monly used drug,
propranolol, "blocks
activation of part of
the sympathetic
nervous system that
would normally in
crease heart rate
and blood pressure
in response to
a stressor."
Your sympa
thetic nervous sys
tem is normally re
sponsible for acti
vating the physio
logical flight-or
flight response that
prepares you for
dealing with stress
ful events — such
as running away
from a tiger or tak
ing the MCATs.
Larry Cahill, a
colleague of Mc-
Gaueh's at UC-

Irvine, applied the use of propranolol to
memory research. When he administered
doses of the drug to a group of subjects, he

could erase

found that the drug prevented the height
ened recollection associated with the
viewing of a gruesome story.
In patients suffering from PTSD, the
heightened memory associated, with emo-

tional arousal "goes too
far" according to Roger
Pitman, a professor of psy
chiatry at Harvard Medical
School. According to other
research, PTSD could last a
lifetime. Thus, medication

your

that could reduce or eliminate PTSD could
help thousands of people who are emotion
ally scarred from events.
Pitman's research suggests that if a pa
tient undergoes treatment with
propanolol within the hours following a
traumatic episode, negative memories
would not be as deeply embedded in the
brain. By extension, McGough suggests
that the drugs could also be taken in antic
ipation of a disturbing experience, such as
paramedics scraping bodies off the high
way or a mother visiting the morgue to
identify a dead son.
A recent article in The New York
Times expressed concern that if the use
of propanolol becomes routine, people
who would not have developed PTSD
will be taking the medication unneces
sarily. However, neither McGaugh nor

Pitman are con
cerned with this pos
sibility because of the
lack of serious side ef
fects associated with
the medication.
Even so, some
find the manipula
tion of memory for
mation troubling.
While not want
ing to appear insensi
tive to those suffering
from PTSD, junior

Erin Lashnits remarked, "I think that mem
ories make up an important part of a per
son's identity ... even if the memories don't

change, you're changing the in
tensity of that memory or of
the reaction to an event. [The
drug] has the potential to have
much more serious complica
tions with a person's personali-

ty than just making life a little easier."
Speigel said that he was "sympa
thetic" to such views, stating that "The
real task is to refind yourself in the
wake of the trauma, not pretend it did
not happen."

Such opinions raise questions of
the value of suffering to human
life, central to some religions, but
researchers remain unfazed.
"The view is that we need to suffer

memory?

because that is the nature of human na
ture," responded McGough to such opin
ions. "[But] does anyone really believe
that?" If we actually believe that, he con
tinued, then we should let a soldier whose
leg has been blown off "lie there and say
that it is part of the human condition."
Others make a distinction between phys
ical and emotional suffering and argue that
even if we already treat physical suffering
with pain medications, for example, that by
working through emotional pain we become
stronger individuals.
In Pitman's estimation, however, "a
mental disorder is a physical disorder."
He said that he hopes that science fic
tion scenarios will not deter future sci
entists from pursuing research that
could benefit a significant psychologi
cal condition.
McGough does not discourage ethical
reflection about the applications of re
search into memory formation, yet won
ders whether popular culture and science
fiction movies, such as "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind" have sensationalized
the actual research and benefits.
"[ln my opinion,]" he added, "the whole
thing is overblown."

the value of suffering to human
life, central to some religions, but
researchers remain unfazed.
"The view is that we need to suffer

memory?

because that is the nature of human na
ture," responded McGough to such opin

that?" If we actually believe that, he con
tinued, then we should let a soldier whose
leg has been blown off "lie there and say
that it is part of the human condition."
Others make a distinction between phys
ical and emotional suffering and argue that
even if we already treat physical suffering
with pain medications, for example, that by
working through emotional pain we become
stronger individuals.
In Pitman's estimation, however, "a
mental disorder is a physical disorder."
He said that he hopes that science fic
tion scenarios will not deter future sci
entists from pursuing research that
could benefit a significant psychologi
cal condition.
McGough does not discourage ethical
reflection about the applications of re
search into memory formation, yet won

of the Spotless Mind" have sensationalized

Some philosophers believe that human identity is defined by a per
son's memories. Erasing a person's memory could have profound
ethical implications.
Imagine that at the age of 15 you were
violently sexually assaulted. Ever since,
you have been unable to enter into a
close relationship, as any intimate con
tact provokes strings of vivid nightmares
and flashbacks during which you remem
ber each moment of the attack in excru
ciating detail. At some point, you would
likely visit a psychiatrist who would diag
nose you with post-traumatic stress dis
order (PTSD).
But what if you could go back to the
hours after the episode and take pills
that would make your memory of the
event cloudy?
Memory researchers have recently
begun to use medications known as
beta-blockers, traditionally used to
treat high blood pressure, in an attempt

to prevent the
onset of PTSD.
According to the
National Center
for PTSD, the
disorder is char-

What
it you

acterized by nightmares, flashbacks,
difficulty sleeping, detachment and es
trangement following the experience of
"life-threatening events such as mili
tary combat, natural disasters, terrorist
incidents, serious accidents or violent
personal assaults such as rape."
While findings of such memory manipu
lation research are still speculative, ethicists
have begun to question how dabbling with
the formation of memory might redefine
what it means to be human. This research is
particularly relevant to public concern fol
lowing the release of such films as "Eternal
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" that present
a science fiction view of memory erasure.
How could such a pill be explained?
The research of James McGaugh, director
of the Center for the Neurobiology of
Learning and Memory at the UC-Irvine,
has demonstrated that we are more likely
to remember events that are emotionally
arousing. Think about the morning of
Sept. 11. The events of that morning —
where you were, what you were doing, who
you were with — may be crystal clear in
your mind. If you could block the emotion,
could you also block out the memory?
"There is evidence that blocking the
emotional arousal also blocks this emo
tion-mediated increase in recollection,"
said David Speigel, professor of psychol
ogy and associate chair of the Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences at School of
Medicine here at Stanford.
Physicians have been "blocking the
emotional arousal" of patients with high
blood pressure for years through the use

"New drugs could be used to
manipulate emotional memory,
alleviating symptoms of
post-traumatic stress disorder"

of drugs called beta
blockers. According
to Speigel, one com
monly used drug,
propranolol, "blocks
activation of part of
the sympathetic
nervous system that
would normally in
crease heart rate
and blood pressure
in response to
a stressor."
Your sympa
thetic nervous sys
tem is normally re
sponsible for acti
vating the physio
logical flight-or
flight response that
prepares you for
dealing with stress
ful events — such
as running away
from a tiger or tak
ing the MCATs.
Larry Cahill, a
colleague of Mc-
Gaueh's at UC-

Irvine, applied the use of propranolol to
memory research. When he administered
doses of the drug to a group of subjects, he

could erase

found that the drug prevented the height
ened recollection associated with the
viewing of a gruesome story.
In patients suffering from PTSD, the
heightened memory associated, with emo-

tional arousal "goes too
far" according to Roger
Pitman, a professor of psy
chiatry at Harvard Medical
School. According to other
research, PTSD could last a
lifetime. Thus, medication

your

that could reduce or eliminate PTSD could
help thousands of people who are emotion
ally scarred from events.
Pitman's research suggests that if a pa
tient undergoes treatment with
propanolol within the hours following a
traumatic episode, negative memories
would not be as deeply embedded in the
brain. By extension, McGough suggests
that the drugs could also be taken in antic
ipation of a disturbing experience, such as
paramedics scraping bodies off the high
way or a mother visiting the morgue to
identify a dead son.
A recent article in The New York
Times expressed concern that if the use
of propanolol becomes routine, people
who would not have developed PTSD
will be taking the medication unneces
sarily. However, neither McGaugh nor

Pitman are con
cerned with this pos
sibility because of the
lack of serious side ef
fects associated with
the medication.
Even so, some
find the manipula
tion of memory for
mation troubling.
While not want
ing to appear insensi
tive to those suffering
from PTSD, junior

Erin Lashnits remarked, "I think that mem
ories make up an important part of a per
son's identity ... even if the memories don't

change, you're changing the in
tensity of that memory or of
the reaction to an event. [The
drug] has the potential to have
much more serious complica
tions with a person's personali-

ty than just making life a little easier."
Speigel said that he was "sympa
thetic" to such views, stating that "The
real task is to refind yourself in the
wake of the trauma, not pretend it did
not happen."

Such opinions raise questions of
the value of suffering to human
life, central to some religions, but
