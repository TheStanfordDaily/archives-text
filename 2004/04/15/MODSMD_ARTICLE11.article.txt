# Health Pulse
## Frothy, warm beer and the college drinking culture 
### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
As one who has a penchant for leeching alcohol,
I've only purchased three handles in my entire life.
Each one, like a junior high crush, elicits wisps of nos
talgia: Kahlua, for my 21st birthday: Bacardi Limon,
social lubrication for Full Moon on the Quad and Mi
dori Sour Apple, consumed in small quantities, so that
no conversation at P*b Night, no matter how con
trived. is ever awkward. Indeed, alcohol, an elixir sec
ond only to water in importance, is — as the eminent
boozehound Homer Simpson once put it — the cause
of. and solution to, all of life's problems.
When you first start tipping the bottle, everything's
temporarily kosher. With the neurotransmitters in your
brain chaotically flitting about, snapping everything out
of balance, your feeling of euphoria increases and you 're
suddenly compelled to act on even the most fleeting im
pulses. Yes, you've imbibed liquid courage. Yet although
you may think the entire dance floor is at your hedonis
tic disposal, the reality is that the sober are lucidly aware
of your gyrating presence, and maybe even deriving a
laugh or two at your expense.
At the same time, your memory goes kaput and your
judgment becomes questionable, impairing, for exam

pie, the objective attractiveness of your love interest
for the evening. As the ethanol surges through your cir
culatory system, you lose control of your bladder and
your muscles become increasingly slow to respond.
Concurrently, your liver goes into overdrive and if it is
not metabolizing at a sufficiently rapid rate to match
your drinking, you vomit (or you could slip into an al
cohol-induced coma). Binge drinking — repeated fre
quently over a number of years — leads to a slew of
diseases straight out of the dictionary of death: ulcers,
cirrhosis of the liver, cardiomyopathy, chronic hyper
tension, as well as cancers of the breast, mouth and lar
ynx. Our beloved surgeon general is certainly not toss
ing around idle warnings.
Yet I'm not here to pontificate; doing so would
make me a hypocrite. I could regale you with stories
of moments passed, such as when I've flushed a burn
ing red, until I turned green with nausea, signaling
for me to make a beeline for the john. Indeed, if I had
devoted a little more attention to my sophomore
chemistry classes. I would have learned how to distill
and brew my own moonshine.
The morning after, however, is far worse than the
blurriness of the night before. The routine: After vow
ing to never drink again for the rest of my life, 1 tumble
out the door for gulps of fresh air, stumbling my way to

the post office or through the Quad, all while averting
eye contact with the neatly dressed passersby. If you
have the gall, trying to get my cousin trashed might be
more practical: Her hangover coping methods consist
of scrubbing bathroom floors and folding laundry.
Even though hangovers are a prevalent and perhaps
morally dubious part of out culture (accounting for $148
billion in lost wages each year, according to an "Annals
of Internal Medicine" published in 2000), few studies
have systematically evaluated treatment. Tolfenamic
acid, which inhibits part of the immune system, has been
shown to mitigate hangover symptoms if taken the night
of alcohol consumption. Vitamin 86, moreover, reduces
the number of symptoms by one-half. These studies,
however, are plagued with low sample size and shoddy
methodology. Ultimately, such studies may even be ir
relevant — although a successful treatment alleviates
discomfort associated with a hangover, people might
still retain its visual-spatial, cognitive and cardiovascu
lar impairments.
So it is not surprising that little research has been per
formed on hangovers at their most extreme form —
Elpenor syndrome — in which alcoholics, as if taking
one too many hits of the bong, live in their own techni
color world, devoid of rationality.
The Stanford Band, you'd suspect, might be afflict-

Ed with Elpenor syndrome, even if they had not
touched a drop of alcohol. Though the Band, those
revelers of tomfoolery, might be scorching dry until
2006, the administration might do well to remember
that a heavy-drinking Yalie, writing off his bacchana
lian heyday as a byproduct of reckless youth, now oc
cupies the Oval Office.
Aware of all the negative consequences associated
with drinking, we make a conscientious choice to par
take in bodily abuse once in a while — experimenta
tion with illegalities is, after all, part of the college ex
perience. From frat boys washing down a beer before
hitting the parties to sophisticated socialites sipping
their cosmopolitans in a New York City bar to your
parents enjoying a glass of red wine at dinner, alcohol
is culturally entangled into our society. So. ignoring
the embedded ironies, a toast to your health: Chug
that watered-down beer from the classic red cup. Live
it up Mac Levine style. Just don't overdo it. I just
don't want to be sending flowers to the Stanford Hos
pital anytime soon.

Charles Feng is a senior majoring in human biology.
Caveat: He does regret getting trashed at the SYZ party, and
upon being driven home, losing a good friend. E-mail him

tic disposal, the reality is that the sober are lucidly aware
of your gyrating presence, and maybe even deriving a
laugh or two at your expense.
At the same time, your memory goes kaput and your
judgment becomes questionable, impairing, for exam

pie, the objective attractiveness of your love interest
for the evening. As the ethanol surges through your cir
culatory system, you lose control of your bladder and
your muscles become increasingly slow to respond.
Concurrently, your liver goes into overdrive and if it is
not metabolizing at a sufficiently rapid rate to match
your drinking, you vomit (or you could slip into an al
cohol-induced coma). Binge drinking — repeated fre
quently over a number of years — leads to a slew of
diseases straight out of the dictionary of death: ulcers,
cirrhosis of the liver, cardiomyopathy, chronic hyper
tension, as well as cancers of the breast, mouth and lar
ynx. Our beloved surgeon general is certainly not toss
ing around idle warnings.
Yet I'm not here to pontificate; doing so would
make me a hypocrite. I could regale you with stories
of moments passed, such as when I've flushed a burn
ing red, until I turned green with nausea, signaling
for me to make a beeline for the john. Indeed, if I had
devoted a little more attention to my sophomore
chemistry classes. I would have learned how to distill
and brew my own moonshine.
The morning after, however, is far worse than the
blurriness of the night before. The routine: After vow
ing to never drink again for the rest of my life, 1 tumble
out the door for gulps of fresh air, stumbling my way to

the post office or through the Quad, all while averting
eye contact with the neatly dressed passersby. If you
have the gall, trying to get my cousin trashed might be
more practical: Her hangover coping methods consist
of scrubbing bathroom floors and folding laundry.
Even though hangovers are a prevalent and perhaps
morally dubious part of out culture (accounting for $148
billion in lost wages each year, according to an "Annals
of Internal Medicine" published in 2000), few studies
have systematically evaluated treatment. Tolfenamic
acid, which inhibits part of the immune system, has been
shown to mitigate hangover symptoms if taken the night
of alcohol consumption. Vitamin 86, moreover, reduces
the number of symptoms by one-half. These studies,
however, are plagued with low sample size and shoddy
methodology. Ultimately, such studies may even be ir
relevant — although a successful treatment alleviates
discomfort associated with a hangover, people might
still retain its visual-spatial, cognitive and cardiovascu
lar impairments.
So it is not surprising that little research has been per
formed on hangovers at their most extreme form —
Elpenor syndrome — in which alcoholics, as if taking
one too many hits of the bong, live in their own techni
color world, devoid of rationality.
The Stanford Band, you'd suspect, might be afflict-

Ed with Elpenor syndrome, even if they had not
touched a drop of alcohol. Though the Band, those
revelers of tomfoolery, might be scorching dry until
2006, the administration might do well to remember
that a heavy-drinking Yalie, writing off his bacchana
lian heyday as a byproduct of reckless youth, now oc
cupies the Oval Office.
Aware of all the negative consequences associated
with drinking, we make a conscientious choice to par
take in bodily abuse once in a while — experimenta
tion with illegalities is, after all, part of the college ex
perience. From frat boys washing down a beer before
hitting the parties to sophisticated socialites sipping
their cosmopolitans in a New York City bar to your
parents enjoying a glass of red wine at dinner, alcohol
is culturally entangled into our society. So. ignoring
the embedded ironies, a toast to your health: Chug
that watered-down beer from the classic red cup. Live
it up Mac Levine style. Just don't overdo it. I just
don't want to be sending flowers to the Stanford Hos
pital anytime soon.

As one who has a penchant for leeching alcohol,
I've only purchased three handles in my entire life.
Each one, like a junior high crush, elicits wisps of nos
talgia: Kahlua, for my 21st birthday: Bacardi Limon,
social lubrication for Full Moon on the Quad and Mi
dori Sour Apple, consumed in small quantities, so that
no conversation at P*b Night, no matter how con
trived. is ever awkward. Indeed, alcohol, an elixir sec
ond only to water in importance, is — as the eminent
boozehound Homer Simpson once put it — the cause
of. and solution to, all of life's problems.
When you first start tipping the bottle, everything's
temporarily kosher. With the neurotransmitters in your
brain chaotically flitting about, snapping everything out
of balance, your feeling of euphoria increases and you 're
suddenly compelled to act on even the most fleeting im
pulses. Yes, you've imbibed liquid courage. Yet although
you may think the entire dance floor is at your hedonis
tic disposal, the reality is that the sober are lucidly aware
of your gyrating presence, and maybe even deriving a
laugh or two at your expense.
