## All TAs should be paid 
### 
Teaching assistants and course assistants play a
pivotal role in organizing and teaching many
Stanford courses. Most TAs and CAs are
graduate students, and most are compensated
modestly according to standardized departmental wage
schedules. The employment of advanced students to
help with Stanford's instruction is generally beneficial to
these employees, as well as to professors and students
who benefit from their labor.
Regrettably, some professors have challenged this
accepted equilibrium. There seems to be a growing
trend toward professors asking graduate and under
graduate students with whom they have relationships to
TA or CA their classes without any financial compensa
tion. These unpaid positions entail work similar or iden
tical to that done by paid TAs, but instead of monetary
compensation, the primary benefit of the employment
to the student is maintaining or improving the students
relationship with the faculty member.
It is unacceptable for professors at a first-class insti
tution to leverage students' desires to form relationships
with them to exploit those students for their labor. The

act of assisting with a course generates substantial value,
and withholding financial compensation deprives the
student of a fair share of the value she generates. In ad
dition. this abuse of power is contrary to the spirit of the
federal Fair Labor Standards Act.
The undercompensated TAs are not the only con
stituency that suffers from this behavior. The lack of
compensation may influence the quality of the work
TAs produce, thereby impairing the quality of instruc
tion at Stanford. In that sense, the burden to the Uni
versity of withholding pay from the TAs could exceed
the relatively small avoided costs to the professor or de
partment. In addition, exploitative treatment of stu
dents also destroys carefully built goodwill and may af
fect alumni sentiment.
More importantly, paying all TAs and CAs for their
formal instructional roles — even if it's just a fraction of
the value they add to the course — is simply the right
thing to do. The solution is clear, easy and inexpensive:
University teaching policies should be amended to re
quire that all teaching assistants and course assistants be
paid a minimum wage.
