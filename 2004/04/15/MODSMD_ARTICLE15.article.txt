# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## No cure for summer job blues 
### 
Whoever it was that said
spring quarter is a piece
of cake must have been
a graduating senior
with no classes left to take, an admis
sion letter from the top graduate
school i n the country and a guaranteed
summer job. For the rest of us, while
the sun is shinning and the tempera
ture is rising, work in all of its cruel
forms — papers, projects, presenta
tions, etc. — is still a very real thing.
Just this week 1 have over 500
pages of reading, three writing assign
ments and a group project to com
plete. Of course, there is also the pile
of internship applications that sits on
my desk and only gets larger every
time I check the announcement board
in the Comm building.
As much as 1 like to procrastinate,
1 really have to get on the ball, be
cause everyone else around me seems
to have landed the perfect summer in
ternship that not only pays $10,000 a
week, but also gives them a company
car, personal assistant and penthouse
apartment to share with their friends
for the summer.
By now 1 should have an answer
to the frequently asked question,
"What are you doing this summer?"
But with only three applications in
the mail, I can't help but feel like I'm
completely screwed.
Sure, I can always stop and talk to
the guy in White Plaza who is promot-

ing "Jobs for the Environment," but
after spending a summer canvassing
for Greenpeace in New York City

where the temper
ature never fell
below 90 degrees
and the average
passerby offered
only a middle fin
ger and a four-let
ter word, 1 would
rather try my luck
at something else.
First, there is
the question of

where I would like to work this sum
mer. While New York has all of the
comforts of home (free housing, free
food and parental cleaning service),
staying on campus would mean that
I wouldn't have to schlep all of my
stuff back home for the third sum
mer in a row. Besides, I hear that the
campus gets pretty nice and laid
back in the summer when no one is
worrying about deadlines, grades or
getting stuck with a TA who doesn't
speak English.
According to the CDC Web site
and their representatives, who also
camp out in White Plaza along with
the environment guy, there are count
less internships on and around cam
pus. While each one boasts about
being fun, exciting and"the opportu
nity of a lifetime," they all fail to men
tion the fact that they are unpaid.

While I am near desperate in my
internship search, I have not yet
reached the point where I would vol
untarily wake up at 7 a.m. just to get to
some air-conditioned hell of an office
by 9 without even the promise of a
paycheck at the end of the week.
As for the paid positions that are
offered, 1 know that I am not patient
enough to be a waitress, I lack the
peppiness of a good salesperson and
since I don't really like children,
working at a summer camp is also out
of the question. It looks like I might be
facing another summer of making cof
fee, photocopying and filing — even
though I'm almost certain that I still
have paper cuts that are healing from
last summer's job.
There is also the option of taking
advantage of my final summer as an
undergraduate and bumming off of
my parents yet again. While it is al
ways a good idea to build our resumes
and make good connections in high
places, I must admit that not even an
internship for the White House could
beat a summer of snood, soap operas
and five-hour naps.
