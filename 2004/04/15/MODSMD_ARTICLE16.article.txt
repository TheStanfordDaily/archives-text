## Monumentally bad decisions 
### 
Making the right deci
sions all the time is
hard. For instance, just
the other day 1 figured
that finishing a recently expired car
ton of milk would be fine. Two days
of projectile vomiting later, I've
come to the conclusion that perhaps
Td be better off reconsidering that
policy.
Examples of such lapses in judg
ment are not rare. There was a time
not too long ago that President Bill
Clinton thought, "Whoa, that's a
cute little intern." As far back as
2,050 years ago, we can find Julius
Caesar thinking that March 15
would be a lovely day to spend at
the forum with his good friend Bru
tus.
In light of these famous miscal
culations, you might think it unlike
ly that someone could make a deci
sion so monumentally bad, it would
put all of these to shame. Well then,
dear reader, it is my distinct plea
sure to introduce you to Mr. Ashley
Revell of London, England.
A few weeks ago, an idea hit
Revell like a freight train: What if
he were to sell all of his earthly pos
sessions, including all of his clothes,
go to Las Vegas, and bet everything
on one spin of the roulette wheel?
Now, I'm sure we've all had
thoughts like this; it's easy to get
drawn in by the lure of easy money.
However, for most of us, it's even
easier to be scared away by the
prospect of being dead broke and
naked on the streets of Las Vegas.
Not so for Ashley Revell.
Despite admonitions from his fa
ther that he was being, and I quote,
"a naughty boy," Revell liquidated

his assets to the tune of $135,000
and ventured across the pond to try
his luck. British TV station Sky
News, in an attempt to prove that
not only Americans are mesmer
ized by ridiculous feats of stupidity,
even sent a crew to cover the event.
I'm going to pause the story fora
moment here, to let the monumen
tal idiocy of this event sink in. Hell,
I have friends who probably aren't
worth $20 even if they recycled all
the beer cans in their rooms, and
even they wouldn't risk everything
if I gave them 10-to-l odds. Mean
while, our good friend Revell was
willing to bet three years of full
Stanford tuition on a worse-than
even shot.
Last Sunday, at the Plaza Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas, the stop
watch on Revell's 15 minutes of
fame began. Wearing a rented tuxe
do and being broadcast live in Eng
land, he stepped up to the table.
Now, it seems to me, if I were
going to be faced with the monu
mental decision of red or black with
$135,000 on the line, I might ago
nize about it a bit. Okay, who the
hell am I kidding? I'd be spending
hours on the phone with Miss Cleo
and trying to read signs out of ani
mal entrails. Revell, however, chose
a slightly different decision-making
process.
Though he had initially planned
to place his net worth on black, a
last minute poll on Sky News indi
cated that Revell's countrymen
back in Britain favored red. I guess
when you're crazy enough to pull a
stunt like this, "what the hell" is a
decent response to such situations.
Revell obviously thought so, and

dropped $135,000 worth of chips
down on the red felt.
I can't imagine what kind of
thoughts could have been going
through Revell's head as the ball
spun around the wheel. If I had to
hazard a guess, however, about
what he was thinking when the ball
landed on Red 7, I'd probably go
with something along the lines of
"Holy %*#&, I'm the luckiest SOB
on the planet." If you want to know
about my condition when I learned
that this lunatic walked away with
270,600 dollars, I'll just say that it
made my run-in with the rotten
milk look seem like a picnic in the
park.
That's right, folks. In addition to
living in a world filled with fear and
uncertainty, on top of coping with
the pressures of attending a top
flight research university, above
and beyond all the slings and arrows
of everyday life, we now have to
deal with a horrid revelation: Ash
ley Revell sold all of his possessions,
bet everything he owned in the
world on one spin of a roulette
wheel, and now, rather than mourn
ing his own insanity, he's zipping
around London in a new James
Bond roadster, lighting cigars with
hundred-pound notes and laughing
at all the idiots working fora living.
And the worst part is that I'd kill to
be doing the exact same thing.

Ben Daniel has been slamming his
head in his door since he learned
about Revell's victory. If you have
any words of consolation, e-mail
them to bmdaniel@stanford.edu.
