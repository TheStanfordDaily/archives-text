Sharanksy addressed
important topics
Yesterday, I was privileged to
witness one of our generation's lead
ing human rights advocates, Natan
Sharansky, speak at Kresge. Sharan
sky is one of only four non-Ameri
cans who have won the Congression
al Gold Medal, along with Nelson
Mandela, Mother Teresa and Win
ston Churchill.
One of the leading Soviet dissi
dents of his time, and an advocate
of Russian Jewry, Sharansky was
jailed on charges of treason in Rus
sian prisons for nine years before
being released in 1986. He current
ly serves in the cabinet for the State
of Israel.
Sharansky told us about the im
portance of working for democracy
and human rights in the Middle East,
and how those goals are inextricably
linked to politics and peacemaking.

Democracies that champion human
rights, he said, are accountable to
their own people, and are by exten
sion more peaceful.
Mr. Sharansky told us how Is
rael has built a free and open soci
ety, with freedom of religion, equal
rights for women and immigrants,
free speech, an independent press
and judiciary. Indeed, Israel, as the
region's only democracy (a title I
hope will soon be shared by oth
ers), should serve as a model of
how to build a real and prosperous
democracy, even in the face of in
tense hostilities.
Today, we are at a major cross
roads in the Middle East. On the one
hand, we see countries like Jordan.
Bahrain and Turkey embarking on
some serious democratic reforms for
the first time in the Islamic world.
These reforms, if carried through and
furthered, can set the tone toward a
freer, more peaceful and more pros

perous Middle East.
On the other hand, governments
like those in Iran, Syria and Egypt
continue to flout international
human rights standards in order to
further their autocratic power. In
Iraq, there is a genuine struggle that
will determine whether Iraq becomes
the trendsetter for Arab democrati
zation or a disaster zone. And
whether or not one supported the
war on Iraq, it is important to recog
nize the principles that will lead Iraq
to success and democracy.
That's why I was so impressed by
Sharansky's speech: Messages like his
are so important right now. I hope
that his visit sparks thoughtful discus
sion on the role of human rights and
democracy in the Middle East.

Critics of 'Kate' op-ed missed point
I am heartened by the responses to
my column published on Mar. 13. My
primary goals were to spark a conver
sation about gender and sexism and
to encourage people to think critical
ly about gender when they see "Kiss
Me, Kate."
However, the responses were frus
trating because people didn't respond
to the larger issues that I was trying to
raise about sexism and racism at Stan
ford and about the play's treatment of
domestic violence.
Everyone agrees that "Kiss Me,
Kate" is a satirical commentary on
"The Taming of the Shrew." Some
people think the jokes about gender
are funny; others think they reinforce
negative stereotypes. But whatever
people's opinions on that issue, the
fact remains that if a play dealt with
race in the potentially offensive, hu
morous way that "Kiss Me, Kate"

deals with gender, it would not be
produced or accepted at Stanford.
I intended to pose a rhetorical
question to the Stanford community:
Why are we more tolerant of sexism
than of racism? That point may have
been lost on some people; most re
spondents seemed to have read the
headline, rolled their eyes and fired
off a generic "you're too PC" e-mail.
Additionally, I was particularly
bothered by the plays consistent triv
ialization of domestic violence (and
remember that men as well as women
are victims of domestic abuse). To
ward the end of Act I, Lilli / Kather
ine and Fred / Petruchio hit each
other, and Fred spanks Lilli and
cracks a whip at her. They both exag
gerate the extent of their injuries, and
neither of them is taken seriously.
The play's many jokes about do
mestic violence are even more ques
tionable. For instance, in Act II the
General says, "We both know women

need a firm hand from time to time. In
fact, between you and me, they like
it!" Fred responds with a line from
Noel Coward: "Women should be
struck regularly, like gongs!"
Obviously Fred is being sarcastic
(though Fred did just strike Lilli re
peatedly). At the same time, though,
should we really be laughing about
this? Another example is the well-per
formed song, "Brush Up Your Shake
speare." The two gangsters sing, "If
she says your behavior is heinous, kick
her right in the "Coriolanus." This is
extremely clever and witty. But what
is our laughter really condoning?
Hopefully this provides some im
petus for further discussion about
sexism, racism and domestic violence,
both in the context of "Kiss Me,
Kate" and beyond.
