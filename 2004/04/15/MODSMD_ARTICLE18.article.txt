# OP-ED
## Students need an alternative to peer-to-peer networks 
### ETHAN K. CLAY 
Eight-hundred-pound gorillas are run
ning wild on every college campus in Ameri
ca. There is one in nearly every dorm room,
pouting for attention. In fact, you could have
your very own furry ape hunched upon your
desk as you read this op-ed. But we students
have chosen to ignore the growing epidemic
of peer-to-peer file sharing.
In late March, the Recording Industry
Association of America filed its latest round
of lawsuits, for the first time specifically tar
geting college students and their families.
Because the accused remain anonymous,
they appear no more human than a descend
ing green pixel in the matrix. Nevertheless,
these college students are real and
to receive subpoenas from Stanford Univer
sity and more than 20 other universities
across the country.
At present, the RIAA's solution to the en

tertainment industry's inability to keep up
with digital technology over the past decade is
a terror campaign designed to frighten stu
dents away from P2P, or peer-to-peer net
works. If the entertainment industry had en
couraged technological advances in the past,
the unsuccessful and costly effort to pervert
copyright laws in favor of the RIAA's goals
would be obsolete, and consumers' down
loading needs would be met.
Despite the number of legal ways to li
cense digital media, the RIA A focused its ef
forts elsewhere, and throughout the history
of file sharing inadvertently encouraged its
evolution from the "central hub" of the good
old Napster to the more pervasive "P2P" of
Kazaa and others. This phenomenon has not
changed, and the current RIAA efforts are
driving students underground to become
more skilled and evasive file sharers, as evi
denced by the newly created sharing soft
ware entitled "Waste."

Regardless of the current debate over
copyright laws or the effect of downloads on
record sales, it must be recognized that digi
tal entertainment has become tethered to the
college experience. Until a realistic alterna
tive to P2P has been created and implement
ed on college campuses, it is unrealistic to
expect students to meet their entertainment
needs in any other way.
Student use of illegal P2P file-sharing soft
ware is a serious issue affecting our generation,
and it deserves our attention. Efforts like those
of Penn State and the University of North
Carolina are a growing phenomenon and dis
play the forward thinking of some universities.
Clearly, students are beginning to see the need
to curb illegal media piracy by supporting a re
alistic alternative to P2P; a solution that does
not involve the RIAA's multi-million-dollar
lawsuits.
Stanford University, like all universities,
is legally bound to comply with subpoenas

because it fears prosecution from associa
tions of lawyers who represent the five
major record labels and the motion picture
companies.
Nevertheless, our universities have been
forced to foot the bill of increased Internet
bandwidth requirements to support file-shar
ing and the costs of new administrators acting
as liaisons between the RIAA and subpoe
naed students. I n addition to the risk of being
handed a $98 billion ticket for downloading,
as happened at Michigan Tech, students al
ready face viruses, adware, spyware, and
spoofed and mislabeled files.
Clearly, the dream of file sharing has been
visited by the boogieman as the user experi
ence of P2P networks has bottomed out and
the subpoenas continue. It is time we advo
cate fora realistic alternative to illegal P2P to
be placed on our college campuses to answer
the concerns of all three concerned parties
and finally end the ongoing legal battle that

places students and universities in the cross
fire. Now, before the next round of subpoe
nas reaches our campuses, we at the Get
Real Campaign ask for your support in a
growing student movement to find and sup
port a realistic solution.
Until a viable alternative exists, it is unre
alistic to expect that students will meet their
needs in any other way. The RIAA should
support realistic ways of licensing media, in
corporate students into the process of find
ing a solution and end its current round of
lawsuits.

college experience. Until a realistic alterna
tive to P2P has been created and implement
ed on college campuses, it is unrealistic to
expect students to meet their entertainment
needs in any other way.
Student use of illegal P2P file-sharing soft
ware is a serious issue affecting our generation,
and it deserves our attention. Efforts like those
of Penn State and the University of North
Carolina are a growing phenomenon and dis
play the forward thinking of some universities.
Clearly, students are beginning to see the need
to curb illegal media piracy by supporting a re
alistic alternative to P2P; a solution that does
not involve the RIAA's multi-million-dollar
lawsuits.
Stanford University, like all universities,
is legally bound to comply with subpoenas

because it fears prosecution from associa
tions of lawyers who represent the five
major record labels and the motion picture
companies.
Nevertheless, our universities have been
forced to foot the bill of increased Internet
bandwidth requirements to support file-shar
ing and the costs of new administrators acting
as liaisons between the RIAA and subpoe
naed students. I n addition to the risk of being
handed a $98 billion ticket for downloading,
as happened at Michigan Tech, students al
ready face viruses, adware, spyware, and
spoofed and mislabeled files.
Clearly, the dream of file sharing has been
visited by the boogieman as the user experi
ence of P2P networks has bottomed out and
the subpoenas continue. It is time we advo
cate fora realistic alternative to illegal P2P to
be placed on our college campuses to answer
the concerns of all three concerned parties
and finally end the ongoing legal battle that

places students and universities in the cross
fire. Now, before the next round of subpoe
nas reaches our campuses, we at the Get
Real Campaign ask for your support in a
growing student movement to find and sup
port a realistic solution.
Until a viable alternative exists, it is unre
alistic to expect that students will meet their
needs in any other way. The RIAA should
support realistic ways of licensing media, in
corporate students into the process of find
ing a solution and end its current round of
lawsuits.
