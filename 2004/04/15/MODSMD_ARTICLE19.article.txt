## Phil Mickelson ushers in Year of the Loser 
### 
Phil Mickelson: Masters champion for
2004. King of Augusta National.
Meanwhile, Tiger's more interested in
boning Elin Nordegren. It sounds
about as natural and plausible as the existence
of Martha Burk and Hootie Johnson's love
child — except that part about Tiger and the
nanny. Because, let's face it, she's way more
interesting than any round of golf I've ever
played, and I say that as a straight woman. But
still. Lefty won. It actually happened.
I like Mickelson about as much as I like
George Steinbrenner and I care for golf about
as much as I care about what happens on to
morrow's episode of "Days of Our Lives." As
unlikable as he is. Lefty did do one thing that's
more than commendable: Phil Mickelson has
paved the way for the Year of the Loser.
Maybe it didn't start soon enough. After
all, UConn did win the National Champi-

onship — which would
have been easier to swallow
if they hadn't won both the
men's and women's titles.
But hey, at least it wasn't
Duke and J.J. Redick — the
poor man's Chris Mullin —
who took it home.
Mickelson's triumph
has opened the door for
the Minnesota Timber
wolves to win the NBA

Championship, the Yankees to not win the
World Series and the Bengals to actually
make the playoffs.
Will it happen? Of course. How could
it not?
Not only did the T-Wolves pick up Latrell
Sprewell, Sam Cassell and Michael
Olowakandi, but they made one even more
important move. Mark Madsen. He might be
the only guy in the world who's whiter than I
am, but he's also the only guy in the league
who's more crucial to his team's success than
Shaquille O'Neal.
Mad Dog got two championship rings for
essentially being a cheerleader. And as amaz
ing a good luck charm he seems to be, he
might just ruin things for Minnesota during
the Year of the Loser, because Madsen is
clearly a born winner.
But every entirely losery team has some
one.
The Cubs picked up Greg Maddux, who,
along with a World Series ring, has 289 career
wins and a 2.90 career ERA. The only way the
Cubs are going to win the World Seriesin this
Year of the Loser is if Maddux embraces his
status as "lovable loser," wins less than 11
games on the season and then has a miracle
comeback in the postseason. But with Dusty
Baker managing that team, there's absolutely
no pitcher with a chance of success.
Sorry Cubs fans, but Kerry Wood will
probably throw out his elbow again. Prior's
not gonna be healthy all season long and, well.
Maddux is currently 0-2 with a 7.45 ERA.
The Cubs' inevitable ability to fail, even in
the Year of the Loser, opens the door for an
other team to slide in and slip on those Cham
pionship rings.
No, not the Boston Red Sox. With that
gaudy payroll, it doesn't matter when the last
time they won a World Series was, they just
can't be considered losers. It wouldn't be in
the spirit of the Year of the Loser if they won.
I have a different loser in mind. A less
widely accepted, but just as valid, loser. My
San Francisco Giants.
Yes, they've made the playoffs fora ridicu
lous number of years straight, but they've still
got absolutely nothing to show for it. The
Giant organization has yet to bring a champi
onship to the city of San Francisco. New York,
yes. SF, no.
I know you probably don't remember it as
vividly as I do, but you have to remember the
hell that Scott Spiezio and the Anaheim An
gels inflicted on the Bay Area in 2(X)2.
If Felix Rodriguez isn't a loser, I absolute
ly can't think of anyone who is.
I'm sure GM Brian Sabean has some
thing going. Instead of going out and signing
a big-name free agent to protect Barry
Bonds, he signed Michael Tucker and Dus
tan Mohr and traded for A.J. Pierzynski. I'm
sure that'll be effective.
Sabean's got a setup man (Rodriguez)
who can't pitch in pressure situations — and
really only has one pitch to speak of — a
closer who hasn't pitched in almost a year
and a half and an ace who is coming off the
DL God knows when. You'd think a major
league general manager widely regarded as
one of the best in the business might have ad
dressed those situations.
And when the Tigers, Cubs, Mets, Orioles
and Astros have bigger free agent signings,
there is certainly a problem.
But thanks to Phil Mickelson and his Year
of the Loser, the Giants have a chance. A real
good chance. Because if Lefty can win a
major, and not just any major, the freaking
Masters, anything can happen.

Emily Kuehler is a senior majoring in eco
nomics. She is really bitter that the Giants
didn t go after Gary Sheffield or Vlad Guer
rero. She can't imagine anything better than a
clubhouse with both Sheffield and Bonds. E

Phil Mickelson: Masters champion for
2004. King of Augusta National.
Meanwhile, Tiger's more interested in
boning Elin Nordegren. It sounds
about as natural and plausible as the existence
of Martha Burk and Hootie Johnson's love
child — except that part about Tiger and the
nanny. Because, let's face it, she's way more
interesting than any round of golf I've ever
played, and I say that as a straight woman. But
still. Lefty won. It actually happened.
I like Mickelson about as much as I like
George Steinbrenner and I care for golf about
as much as I care about what happens on to
morrow's episode of "Days of Our Lives." As
unlikable as he is. Lefty did do one thing that's
more than commendable: Phil Mickelson has
paved the way for the Year of the Loser.
Maybe it didn't start soon enough. After
all, UConn did win the National Champi-

onship — which would
have been easier to swallow
if they hadn't won both the
men's and women's titles.
But hey, at least it wasn't
Duke and J.J. Redick — the
poor man's Chris Mullin —
who took it home.
Mickelson's triumph
has opened the door for
the Minnesota Timber
wolves to win the NBA

Championship, the Yankees to not win the
World Series and the Bengals to actually
make the playoffs.
Will it happen? Of course. How could
it not?
Not only did the T-Wolves pick up Latrell
Sprewell, Sam Cassell and Michael
Olowakandi, but they made one even more
important move. Mark Madsen. He might be
the only guy in the world who's whiter than I
am, but he's also the only guy in the league
who's more crucial to his team's success than
Shaquille O'Neal.
Mad Dog got two championship rings for
essentially being a cheerleader. And as amaz
ing a good luck charm he seems to be, he
might just ruin things for Minnesota during
the Year of the Loser, because Madsen is
clearly a born winner.
But every entirely losery team has some
one.
The Cubs picked up Greg Maddux, who,
along with a World Series ring, has 289 career
wins and a 2.90 career ERA. The only way the
Cubs are going to win the World Seriesin this
Year of the Loser is if Maddux embraces his
status as "lovable loser," wins less than 11
games on the season and then has a miracle
comeback in the postseason. But with Dusty
Baker managing that team, there's absolutely
no pitcher with a chance of success.
Sorry Cubs fans, but Kerry Wood will
probably throw out his elbow again. Prior's
not gonna be healthy all season long and, well.
Maddux is currently 0-2 with a 7.45 ERA.
The Cubs' inevitable ability to fail, even in
the Year of the Loser, opens the door for an
other team to slide in and slip on those Cham
pionship rings.
No, not the Boston Red Sox. With that
gaudy payroll, it doesn't matter when the last
time they won a World Series was, they just
can't be considered losers. It wouldn't be in
the spirit of the Year of the Loser if they won.
I have a different loser in mind. A less
widely accepted, but just as valid, loser. My
San Francisco Giants.
Yes, they've made the playoffs fora ridicu
lous number of years straight, but they've still
got absolutely nothing to show for it. The
Giant organization has yet to bring a champi
onship to the city of San Francisco. New York,
yes. SF, no.
I know you probably don't remember it as
vividly as I do, but you have to remember the
hell that Scott Spiezio and the Anaheim An
gels inflicted on the Bay Area in 2(X)2.
If Felix Rodriguez isn't a loser, I absolute
ly can't think of anyone who is.
I'm sure GM Brian Sabean has some
thing going. Instead of going out and signing
a big-name free agent to protect Barry
Bonds, he signed Michael Tucker and Dus
tan Mohr and traded for A.J. Pierzynski. I'm
sure that'll be effective.
Sabean's got a setup man (Rodriguez)
who can't pitch in pressure situations — and
really only has one pitch to speak of — a
closer who hasn't pitched in almost a year
and a half and an ace who is coming off the
DL God knows when. You'd think a major
league general manager widely regarded as
one of the best in the business might have ad
dressed those situations.
And when the Tigers, Cubs, Mets, Orioles
and Astros have bigger free agent signings,
there is certainly a problem.
But thanks to Phil Mickelson and his Year
of the Loser, the Giants have a chance. A real
good chance. Because if Lefty can win a
major, and not just any major, the freaking
Masters, anything can happen.
