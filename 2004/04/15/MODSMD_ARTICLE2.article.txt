# GSC to follow Undergrad Senate's lead in certification
## 
### JASON FLANNICK 
The Graduate Student Coun
cil (GSC) discussed the contro
versy surrounding the recent
ASSU executive election last
night. The GSC and Undergrad
uate Senate are expected to vote
next week on whether to certify
the election.
Most members of the GSC did
not appear to have strong opin
ions on the certification issue,
evinced by the fact that only a
handful took sides. The main
concerns involved the issues of
free speech and prevention of
misconduct in future elections.
"How much of this endorse
ment, campaigning, mudslinging
— whatever you want to call it —
is actually just an expression of
free speech?" asked GSC chair
Steve Allison, a doctoral candi
date in biological sciences. "It's
disappointing they'd engage in
smear tactics, but if you look at
political campaigns anywhere
that sort of thing is still protected

under free speech. I find it hard to
throw out an election based on
what I think is free speech."
Elections Commissioner Ellie
Martin, a junior, presented her
recommendation to the GSC
after giving background on the
controversy, which several mem
bers were unfamiliar with.
"The Elections Committee
doesn't feel comfortable saying
we should disqualify the results,"
Martin said. "We think that the
consequences of not certifying
would be worse than certifying."
Deputy GSC chair Gayle Chris
tensen. a doctoral student in edu
cation, felt that the alleged mis
conduct was not sufficient to in
validate the election.
"Yes, it's is going to happen
again in some form," she said. "I
think it's ridiculous not to certify
the election on those grounds.
We need to think very carefully
before we don't certify an elec
tion based on free speech."
The controversy involves a se
ries of e-mails sent out during the

election in support of the slate of
Mikey Lee and Dylan Mefford.
The chief problem, according to
Martin, is that it is not clear
whether the e-mails truly violat
ed campaign policy.
"It's an issue of semantics be
tween endorsement and cam
paigning," Martin said. "If the e
mails were campaigning, then
they would be egregious."
GSC Secretary Carrie White
hill, a doctoral student in earth
sciences, supported certifying the
results due this ambiguity.
"The issue is clarity and se
mantics," she said. "Where does
this stop? We're going to keep
bringing this up year after year.
This needs to be resolved."
Not all GSC members agreed
with Whitehill, however.
"That's exactly my reason for
voting not to certify," countered
GSC ex-officio member Amit
Gangul, a graduate student in
mechanical engineering.
"There's always been some sliminess going on.
I'm just tired of it, and that's my reason for saying
throw it out."
Despite these concerns, the general consensus
of the GSC was that since graduate students com
prised only a small fraction of the total voters, it
would be difficult for members to take a strong
stand on the issue.
