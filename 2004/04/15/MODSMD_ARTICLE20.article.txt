# Track to compete at Mt. SAC
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year in the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays, former Stanford standout
Lauren Fleshman posted the second-fast
ed outdoor 5,000-meter time in NCAA
history, while Alicia Craig, then only a red
shirt freshman, posted the fourth-fastest
time ever.
In the middle of one of the most im
portant weekends of competition for the
Cardinal, Craig returns to Mt. SAC to
morrow to race the 5,000 Invitational
against some of the best professional
runners in the nation as well as the top
runners in the NCAA, as the athletes
look to qualify individually for the vari
ous post-season competitions.
This year's race may prove equally
devastating to the NCAA record books
as the current indoor 5,000 collegiate
record-holder, Kim Smith of Provi
dence, and the American Junior record
holder, Molly Huddle of Notre Dame,
are also competing.
The three collegians will be pushed by
Olympians and Olympics hopefuls like
Fleshman, North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan, who is redshirting the season to
prepare for the Olympics, and Elva Dryer,
who represented the U.S. in 2000.
Many of these athletes will be gunning
for the Olympic "A" standard of 15 min
utes, 8.70 seconds and could pull any of the
three collegians in the race under the cur
rent NCAA record of 15:23.03 set in 1985
by Kathy Hayes of Oregon.
For Craig, this race will represent an op
portunity to judge her fitness without
dwelling too much on trying to get a win.
Because the focus of many of Stanford's
top distance runners is the Olympic Trials
in July, they have not begun the speed
training necessary to run fast races. In
stead, just as she did last year, Craig will
rely solely on her endurance and strength
while attempting to improve her personal
best of 15:25.94 from last year.
"We are really gearing up for this
meet," said women's head coach Edrick
Floreal. "People are trying to hit standards.
Our athletes understand the opportunity

that this meet represents to accomplish
their goals."
Complimenting the women's invitation
al 5,000 is a stacked men's 5,000, which will
include senior Louis Luchini, who was the
NCAA runner-up at the distance last year.
He will be challenging the reigning NCAA
5,000 champion, Alistair Cragg of
Arkansas, American record holder Bob
Kennedy and the world's No. 2 all-time
1,500 runner. Bernard Lagat of Kenya.
Luchini finished fifth in the race last
year with the third-best time in school his
tory. He will look to improve upon that
time of 13:31 and aim for the Olympic "A"
standard of 13:21.50. which would also earn
him the school record at 5,000 meters.
But those are just two of the races
over three days of intense competition
among the best from around the NCAA
and the world.
Stanford runners should feature
prominently in the University division of
the men's 5,000. which will be contested
on Friday evening. Many of the nation's
top NCAA runners not qualified for the
invitational 5,000 will be entered.
Redshirt sophomore Ryan Hall head
lines the race for Stanford in his collegiate
5,000 debut. He should be one of the fa
vorites in a race that includes no fewer than
17 current and former NCAA Ail-Ameri
cans at distances from 1,500 to 10,000 â€” in
cluding Arizona's Robert Cheseret, third
at last year's NCAA 5,000, and senior Seth
Hejny, fourth behind Cheseret.
The women's University division 5,000
is set up fora showdown between junior
Sara Bei, the runner-up at 3.000 during In
door Nationals, and Wartburg's Missy But
try, the NCAA Division 111 Cross Country
champion by over a minute and 60th-place
finisher for team U.S.A. at the World Cross
Country Championships.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will continue
competition in the Middle Distance Carni
val with the women's 800, where freshman
Ashley Freeman and sophomore Chinny
Offor will look to move up in the Stanford
record books and in the national rankings.
Offor's time of 2:06.17 is currently fifth in


AAATT SAYLES/The Stanford Daily File
Evan Fox and the rest of the Stanford track and field team will compete at Mt. San Antonio Col
lege this weekend, where Alicia Craig will try to break an NCAA record and qualify for the
Olympics in the 5,000 meters.
