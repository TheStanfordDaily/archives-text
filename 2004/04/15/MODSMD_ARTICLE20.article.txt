# Track to compete at Mt. SAC
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year in the Mt. San Antonio Col
lege Relays, former Stanford standout
Lauren Fleshman posted the second-fast
ed outdoor 5,000-meter time in NCAA
history, while Alicia Craig, then only a red
shirt freshman, posted the fourth-fastest
time ever.
In the middle of one of the most im
portant weekends of competition for the
Cardinal, Craig returns to Mt. SAC to
morrow to race the 5,000 Invitational
against some of the best professional
runners in the nation as well as the top
runners in the NCAA, as the athletes
look to qualify individually for the vari
ous post-season competitions.
This year's race may prove equally
devastating to the NCAA record books
as the current indoor 5,000 collegiate
record-holder, Kim Smith of Provi
dence, and the American Junior record
holder, Molly Huddle of Notre Dame,
are also competing.
The three collegians will be pushed by
Olympians and Olympics hopefuls like
Fleshman, North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan, who is redshirting the season to
prepare for the Olympics, and Elva Dryer,
who represented the U.S. in 2000.
Many of these athletes will be gunning
for the Olympic "A" standard of 15 min
utes, 8.70 seconds and could pull any of the
three collegians in the race under the cur
rent NCAA record of 15:23.03 set in 1985
by Kathy Hayes of Oregon.
For Craig, this race will represent an op
portunity to judge her fitness without
dwelling too much on trying to get a win.
Because the focus of many of Stanford's
top distance runners is the Olympic Trials
in July, they have not begun the speed
training necessary to run fast races. In
stead, just as she did last year, Craig will
rely solely on her endurance and strength
while attempting to improve her personal
best of 15:25.94 from last year.
"We are really gearing up for this
meet," said women's head coach Edrick
Floreal. "People are trying to hit standards.
Our athletes understand the opportunity

that this meet represents to accomplish
their goals."
Complimenting the women's invitation
al 5,000 is a stacked men's 5,000, which will
include senior Louis Luchini, who was the
NCAA runner-up at the distance last year.
He will be challenging the reigning NCAA
5,000 champion, Alistair Cragg of
Arkansas, American record holder Bob
Kennedy and the world's No. 2 all-time
1,500 runner. Bernard Lagat of Kenya.
Luchini finished fifth in the race last
year with the third-best time in school his
tory. He will look to improve upon that
time of 13:31 and aim for the Olympic "A"
standard of 13:21.50. which would also earn
him the school record at 5,000 meters.
But those are just two of the races
over three days of intense competition
among the best from around the NCAA
and the world.
Stanford runners should feature
prominently in the University division of
the men's 5,000. which will be contested
on Friday evening. Many of the nation's
top NCAA runners not qualified for the
invitational 5,000 will be entered.
Redshirt sophomore Ryan Hall head
lines the race for Stanford in his collegiate
5,000 debut. He should be one of the fa
vorites in a race that includes no fewer than
17 current and former NCAA Ail-Ameri
cans at distances from 1,500 to 10,000 â€” in
cluding Arizona's Robert Cheseret, third
at last year's NCAA 5,000, and senior Seth
Hejny, fourth behind Cheseret.
The women's University division 5,000
is set up fora showdown between junior
Sara Bei, the runner-up at 3.000 during In
door Nationals, and Wartburg's Missy But
try, the NCAA Division 111 Cross Country
champion by over a minute and 60th-place
finisher for team U.S.A. at the World Cross
Country Championships.
On Saturday, the Cardinal will continue
competition in the Middle Distance Carni
val with the women's 800, where freshman
Ashley Freeman and sophomore Chinny
Offor will look to move up in the Stanford
record books and in the national rankings.
Offor's time of 2:06.17 is currently fifth in

Evan Fox and the rest of the Stanford track and field team will compete at Mt. San Antonio Col
lege this weekend, where Alicia Craig will try to break an NCAA record and qualify for the
Olympics in the 5,000 meters.
the NCAA.
The men's 1,500 will be loaded
with Cardinal athletes, including
Hall, senior Andy Powell and Pacif
ic-10 Conference 800-meter champi
on Justin Romaniuk, a sophomore.
In his heat, Powell will be up
against BYU's Nathan Robison, an
All-American in the indoor mile,
and Simon Ngata of Georgia. Hall
will be entered in the top flight,
which will square him off with sever
al current and former NCAA mile
and 1,500 champions as well as Col
orado junior Dathan Ritzenhein,
who out-kicked Hall at the 2003
NCAA Cross Country Champi
onships to claim the individual title
by a mere 1.3 seconds.

The Mt. SAC Relays conclude on
Sunday with the University Invita
tional, where Stanford's women
sprinters hope to again light up the
track with record run in the 1,600-
meter relay. The last time the team
ran, it set a school record of 3:33.98,
which, after last week's sweep of the
400 at the Brutus Hamilton Invita
tional, may be in jeopardy.
The men will also enter a 1,600-
meter relay team, looking to post a
Regional qualifying mark for the
first time this year. Both the men and
the women will also enter 400-meter
relay teams.
Senior Jillian Camarena will
compete against some of the top shot
putters in the nation for the second
week in a row. Florida's Candice
Scott, professional Stephanie Brown
and UCLA's Jessica Crosby, who
finished as the second collegian to
Camarena last week at the Rafer
Johnson Invitational, may push her

to yet another school record this
year.
To cap off an exciting weekend in
the distance events, freshman Ari
Lambie and redshirt junior Don
Sage will compete in the invitational
women's 1,500 and men's mile, re
spectively.
Lambie will be looking to im
prove upon her freshman record at
the distance as she goes up against
former Stanford standout Malindi
Elmore and one of the world's top
1,500 runners, Nicole Teter of the
Nike Farm Team.
In the men's mile. Sage will have
his hands full with NCAA Ail-
Americans Josh Spiker of Wisconsin
and David Freeman of Kentucky
and former Stanford Olympian
Michael Stember.
Mt. SAC, for the team, represents
an opportunity for some of Stan
ford's athletes to start posting fast
times, while it gives the distance run

ners a chance to compete against the
nation's best and shake off rust be
fore the Cardinal heads toward its
key meets.
"We are looking at peaking dif
ferent athletes for different season
ending meets depending on their
various goals," said head men's
coach Robert Weir. "Consequently,
different athletes are further along
or more rested.
"That having been said, we are on
the cusp of what we view to be the
championship season, starting with the
Big Meet. So, in general, we are look
ing to make progress toward champi
onship-type performances."
Events at the 46th annual Mt.
SAC Relays begin tomorrow at 4:00
pm. With almost 500 events and
thousands of competitors from the
high school to the elite level, it
should once again prove to be one of
the largest and most competitive
meets in the nation.
