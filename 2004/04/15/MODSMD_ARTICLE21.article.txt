### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 11 Stanford softball team
improved its record to 33-10 after win
ning both games of a non-conference
doubleheader against Sacramento State
on Tuesday night at Boyd and Jill Smith
Family Stadium. The unranked Hornets
fell to 29-19 on the season after being
shut out in both games by the Cardinal,
4-0 and 2-0, respectively.
Stanford relied heavily on its pitching
staff in the doubleheader; both of Stan
ford's starting pitchers hurled complete
game shutouts against the Hornets. Senior
ace Dana "Lightning D" Sorensen and
sophomore Laura Severson totaled 14
scoreless innings, allowing only nine hits

combined while striking out 11 Hornets in
the Cardinal's twin wins.
Tuesday's first game showcased the tal
ents of the team's two seniors, Sorensen
and catcher Jessica Allister. Inside the cir
cle, Sorensen allowed just five Hornet hits
while striking out seven in seven scoreless
innings to earn her 19th win of the season,
defeating Hornets ace Brianne Ferguson.
Sorensen also reached 1,000 career strike
outs in the game, becoming only the third
player in the history of the Pacific-10 Con
ference to reach that plateu.
Despite Sorensen's stellar perfor
mance, Tuesday's first game belonged to
senior Allister. last week's Pac-10 Softball
Player of the Week after a 7-for-9 week
end against California that included six
consecutive hits. Allister continued her

offensive tear with a 2-for-2 performance
and four RBls. Sophomore center fielder
Catalina Morris scored two runs and had
two hits of her own.
Tuesday's nightcap featured an even
more impressive pitching performance.
Severson bounced back from a disappoint
ing outing in her previous start against Cal
to master the Sacramento State hitters.
She allowed only four Hornet baserunners
in seven shutout innings and was in total
control, allowing no walks. The win
pushed Severson's record to 11-5 on the
year.
Stanford managed to generate just
enough offense to win in the nightcap de
spite being limited to just six hits by Hor
net pitcher Jennifer Fryou. Morris and ju
nior right fielder Katherine Hoffman each

had an RBI in the 2-0 Cardinal victory. Ju
nior outfielder-designated player Heather
Shook added a single and scored a run and
junior third baseman Liz Bending
knocked a double to left field that almost
cleared the wall in her only at-bat of the
game.
After the team wrapped up last week
end's series against Cal, Stanford head
coach John Rittman refused to look past
Sacramento State to Friday's home game
against top-ranked Arizona (40-1, 6-0 Pa
cific-10 Conference). But now that the
Cardinal has moved past the unranked
Hornets, it must focus on the Wildcats.
This Friday's home game, which Sorensen
will start, represents the Cardinal's most
realistic chance of knocking the Wildcats
off their pedestal.
