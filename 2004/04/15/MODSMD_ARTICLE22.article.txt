# Women's lacrosse takes on Duke, Davidson
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
The No. 20 Stanford women's lacrosse team (7-5) managed not to drop out of the
IWLCA top 20 poll after last Friday's loss to No. 13 Northwestern (9-1), but the Car
dinal will need to win this weekend if it wants to keep the West Coast represented in
the game's upper echelon.
It will not be an easy task, as Stanford faces No. 6 Duke (8-4) tomorrow night be
fore taking on unranked Davidson (3-10) on Sunday afternoon. Both games will be
played on Duke's campus in Durham, N.C.
Prior to its 11-5 loss to Northwestern, Stanford had won four straight. The team
still retains a perfect 4-0 mark in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play and will
not face its conference foes again until the MPSF playoffs, so this weekend's match
es are more about national recognition and personal accomplishment than immedi
ate implications.
Duke has played excellent defense this year, yielding 8.21 goals per game while
scoring 10.51 times per game. The Blue Devils have demonstrated significant superi
ority over their opponents in ground balls, draw controls and turnovers caused.
Stanford will need to execute well on offense if it wants to bring down the Blue
Devils. Leading the charge will be senior midfielder Abbi Hills, who leads the team
in goals (25) and and is third in assists (6), versatile junior Kelsey Twist, who has 16
goals and a team-leading 10 assists, and sophomore attacker Megan Burker, who
ranks second on the team in goals (21) and assists (8). Other double-digit goal scor
ers are sophomore attacker Sarah Bach (14), senior midfielder Kim Cahill (13) and
junior midfielder Nina Pantano (11).
Davidson has had a rough year, yielding 14.66 goals per game while scoring only
8.49. Statistically, the Wildcats do many things just as well as their opponents, with
their and their opponents' shot percentages (.458 for Davidson, .471 for its foes) and
number of turnovers caused (101 apiece) being very competitive.
Stanford should be able to gain an edge on draw controls (where Davidson has 128
to its foes 195) and by being able to attack the goal more effectively (Davidson has
taken 240 shots this year to its opponents' 403).
Senior defender Kate Grube, the runaway team leader with 22 turnovers caused,
and senior goalkeeper Christina Saikus (.556 save percentage) should help the Car
dinal keep Davidson at bay on Sunday.
