# Volleyball loses to Pacific, will get one more chance
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
ru''xT° n t n S r^ tor l ' le Stanford men's volleyball team,
he No. 10 Cardinal (9-17,6-15 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) was
swept, 3-0, by Pacific last night in Stockton, while No. 9 UC-Irvine (13-17 7-
14) upset No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara to pull one game ahead of Stanford for
the eighth and hnal playoff spot in the MPSF.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, it has another chance in two days. Satur
day s rematch with Pacific in Burnham Pavilion will determine the Cardi
nal s playofi late. Irvine faces No. 5 C al State-Northridge on Saturday in its
final game, and since Stanford beat Irvine both times the two met, the Car
dinal will make the playoffs it the two teams finish with the same record.
Pacific (9-19, 5-16) was eliminated from playoff contention by Irvine's
win, so the Tigers will be playing for pride on Saturday.
1 he Tigers were surprisingly dominant at home last night, winning three
straight games, 30-28,30-28 and 30-25, respectively, over Stanford.
In the fiist game, Stanford took its only lead at 16-15, but Pacific battled
back to lead 26-21 betore closing out the match. Brian Zodroe who had a
match-high 23 kills, finished off game one with a kill.
The second game was almost identical to the first — a back-and-forth
battle that saw Pacific take a 26-21 lead before closing it out. Stanford hit just
.179 in the game and never led.
Stanford did lead in game three, 12-9, but the Tigers took control by serv
ing well and capitalizing on poor hitting by the Cardinal. Mauricio Brizuela
had two solo blocks in the last four points of the game and finished the match
with 11 kills and a match-high eight digs.
David Vogel was the only double-figure hitter for the Cardinal, totaling
12 kills. Craig Buell led the away with three of Stanford's seven blocks.
But. despite the loss, Stanford is in the same position it was prior to last
night's game — it just needs to win one more match.
Buell, speaking earlier this week, could not overstate the importance of
the two games.
"Our whole season has come down to [this]," he said.
How right he was.
The confusing question of playoff spots is paralleled by the somewhat un
usual schedule. While Stanford has faced teams back-to-back in the past,
consecutive matches were confined to competitions against schools like
Brigham Young and Hawaii. Due to the increased travel time more distant
locations necessitate, Stanford takes on those teams twice in a weekend, and
is given little time to recover.
But this time, Stanford will take on Pacific four days apart.
The time off will give Stanford an opportunity to reassess their line up
against a Tiger rotation that Shaw explained was somewhat unpredictable.
"Against Pepperdine and USC, I Pacific] used a couple of different line ups,
so we don't really know what to expect from them," Shaw said.
More importantly, the interim practice will allow Stanford to address the
threat of Tiger standouts Dobbers and Rogers, a pair Shaw said would be es
sential in Pacific's attack. He even compared the duo to senior Fred Winters
and junior Sean Rooney, All-American outside hitters for Pepperdine who
combined fora total of 34 kills in the Waves's 3-0 sweep of Stanford last
weekend. The Pacific duo combined fora more ordinary 18 kills last night,
thanks to Zobroe's huge game.
With Irvine facing a tough Northridge team, Stanford's fate is likely in its
own hands this Saturday — which is right where the Cardinal wants it.
"Our team has been working hard the whole season to come to this
point," Buell said before the Pacific series began. "Now we just have to
prove we have what it takes."
