After last week's ASSU election, the good
news is that Club Sports will continue to get its
special fee next year. Club Sports had to petition
to get onto the ballot this year, so many of its ath
letes had to rush around in the last few days be
fore finals week to collect signatures.
Men's Rugby
Forget Cancun. This year's annual Stanford
rugby tour found 24 players, their coach, trainer
and her friend on a plane bound for the rainy skies
of the United Kingdom.
They stopped first in England to visit the 'old
rectory', the home of one of their players who just
happens to share his plot of land with the family
castle, and piled in fora spot of tea and cucumber
sandwiches with the crusts cut off — the likes of
which would have made Oscar Wilde proud.
Next it was on to Wales, where local school chil
dren heckled them from outside their locker rooms
before the games. In the Rhonda Valley, they ref
ereed 8-year-olds who seemed bound for the na
tional team, sported miner's hats and ventured into
salt mines, where the tour guide scared the biggest

guy on the team with promises of dynamite.
The highlight came at the Six Nations Interna
tional test match between Italy and Wales at the
famed Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Several
Guinesses before midday didn't help with under
standing the Welsh language, but the players still
managed to belt out the anthem 'Bread of Heav
en' with the best of the local fans.
« The most memorable times, however,
were when the sun peeked through the
clouds and they looked up and screamed at
the heavens "Spring Break 2004, Baby!".
Sun or none, it was a great tour.
Cycling
Following a strong showing two weekends ago
at Cal, the team headed to Reno last Saturday
and Sunday for the Nevada-Reno road race and
criterium.
On the first day, Mary Haw destroyed the
competition with a 200-meter sprint to win the
women's Bs and Katie Behroozi took third in the
As. Meanwhile the men's A criterium brought
out great performances by Tyler Hester (fourth)
and Chris Montague-Breakwell (sixth), while
Ueyn Block finished second in the Bs.
Sunday brought the road race and one of the

team's best performances all season. After a
grueling 88 miles in the desert sun, Montague-
Breakwell sprinted up the last hill to pass a Cal
rider and finish first in the men's A race. An
other fast sprint finish gave Ueyn Block first in
the men's Bs, with Rand Miller following close
behind in fourth. The men's C race continued
the trend with an exciting fourth place finish
for Carl Kloos. In the women's races, Katie
Behroozi took sixth in the women's As after 44
miles of climbing and descending and a tough
group sprint, while Amber Rais and Mary Haw
battled to second and fifth, respectively, in the
Bs
In the end, the Cardinal secured first place in
the criterium and third in the road race, meaning
that their omnium standing is now fifth.
The last race of the season will be a big test
and will be held at Stanford on April 25. The
team invites anyone interested to come out to
cheer them on. Since it is their home race they
also will need help marshaling the course. For
