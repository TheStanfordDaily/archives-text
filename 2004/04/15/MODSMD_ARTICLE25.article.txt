# Panel reviews Spain bombings
## 
### EVA DEHLINGER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night's discussion panel "What
Happened in Spain?" brought together
opinions on the March 11 bombings in
Madrid and their implications for Span
ish and European foreign policy. The
event was put on by Bursting the Bub
ble, a student group geared at informing
students about current issues.
The speakers included native
Spaniard Mario Galarreta; Prof.
Ludger Kuehnhardt, who is the director
of the Center for European Integration
Studies at the University of Bonn; and
Tonya Putnam, a doctoral candidate in
Political Science.
The panel opened with comments
by Galarreta on his country's histori
cal and political situation. He spoke of
the tumult caused by ETA, a Basque
separatist movement responsible for
some 800 deaths from smaller-scale
terrorists acts in Northern Spain in the
past 20 years.
When the train bombings responsi
ble for the deaths of 191 people oc
curred on March 11, "the whole coun
try was in shock," Galarreta ex
plained. "Everyone assumed that
ETA was responsible."
To the surprise of many, the Spanish
government soon found evidence that
the bombings were the work of a Mo

roccan Islamist extremist group possi
bly allied with al Qaeda.
Three days after the bombings,
Spanish elections replaced former
Prime Minster Jose Maria Aznar with
Socialist candidate Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero, who had promised to with
draw Spanish troops from Iraq. Many
feel that the Socialist victory was a re
sult of the bombings.
The situation has lead to Spanish un
certainty, according to Galarreta, and
difference of opinion on whether or not
the bombings were meant to be punish
ment for Aznar's support of Bush.
Putnam built on the background in
formation provided by Galarreta by dis
cussing the possible implications that
the bombings would have on Europe's
future course of action.
According to Putman, a change to
wards a more militaristic defense will
not be significant, due to Europe's
deep-seated tendencies to approach
things by "going to the roots" of prob
lems and looking to change structure.
"States use policies that display their
strength," Putnam said. According to
her, the United States' strength is in
flexing its power, and thus the country
tends to look at immediate problems,
responding to them by using "more vio
lent options."
"This gap in [European and U.S.
strengths and policies] is translated into

different preferences in response to ter
rorist threat," Putnam said.
Kuehnhardt, the final speaker for
the evening, provided a larger Euro
pean historical context, noting that the
continent was impacted by three im
portant events: the fall of the Berlin
Wall, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in
the United States and the March 11
bombings in Spain. Kuehnhardt pre
dicted that these last attacks would
have serious implications.
"I suspect that 3/11 will to most Eu
ropeans become equivalent to 9/11 to
the vast majority of Americans,"
Kuehnhardt said.
"Europeans are no longer as certain
as they used to be," Kuehnhardt added,
suggesting that this uncertainty will
translate into solidarity. "An attack on
one of us is an attack on all of us. The
question is, 'What do we do together?"'
According to sophomore Julie Lein,
who is part of Bursting the Bubble's
"Leadership Core," the Madrid bomb
ings are typical of the subjects of Burst
ing the Bubble panels.
"It was something that we feel is
particularly important that most Stan
ford students don't really know
about," Lein said. "It's our chance to
get out more information about the
issue of terrorism and how countries
other than the U.S. must cope with its
repercussions."
