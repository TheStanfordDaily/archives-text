### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Tomorrow night, a coalition of
campus groups will co-host Take
Back the Night, an annual event de
signed to raise campus awareness
about rape and sexual assault. Partic
ipants will march through campus,
then join in a vigil and watch student
presentations.
Over the course of the evening, par
ticipants will be encouraged to share
their thoughts and feelings about on
campus safety, particularly issues facing
female students.
"Many women feel unsafe walking
alone at night, at Stanford and many
other cities throughout the world," said
co-coordinator Jane Nevins.
In the past, the campus march has in
cluded symbolic visits to sites where as

saults have occurred on campus.
"Take Back the Night is held annual
ly to reclaim the space and assert
women's right to move throughout the
world with out fear," Nevins said.
Take Back the Night sponsors in
clude the Women's Community Cen
ter, the Stanford Women's Coalition,
Sigma Psi Zeta and the Inter-Fraterni
ty Council. The event was initially
sponsored by the Coalition Against
Sexual Assault, a group that is no
longer active on campus.
Katharina Kircanski, Wellness Pro
gram coordinator at the Women's
Community Center, stressed the im
portance of the co-sponsorship of this
year's event.
"Take Back the Night provides a po
tential bridge between groups and com
munities that often don't cross paths on
campus," she said. "It's my hope that it

will serve as a starting point for more
thorough discussions among diverse
student communities about violence
against women."
Nevins added, "The event features
speakers, poets and spoken word on
the topics of violence against women,
empowerment, intersections of race
and gender and other related topics."
The program also highlights contri
butions from individual student speak
ers and performers. Presentations will
touch on related topics, such as race and
individual empowerment.
"There is something about listening
to individuals' testimonies, poetry and
spoken word that really hits home for
students, and moves us to think more
deeply about these matters," Kircanski
said.
Take Back the Night begins at 9 p.m.
at the Women's Community Center.
