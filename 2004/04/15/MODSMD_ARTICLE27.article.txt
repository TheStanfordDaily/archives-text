# Religious experts talk 'Passion'
## 
### ZACH DEMBO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A group of Stanford religious ex
perts will be participating today in a
panel on the controversial film "The
Passion of the Christ." Produced, di
rected and adapted to the screen by
Mel Gibson, "The Passion" has
sparked heated debate about its por
trayal of Jesus Christ's life and
death.
Helping to moderate the discussion
will be the Reverend Scotty McLen
nan, dean of religious life at Stanford,
and Arnold Eisen, chair of the Depart
ment of Religious Studies.
McLennan said he hopes the
panel will help students and faculty
have a better understanding of the
phenomenon surrounding "The
Passion".
"This movie has been one of the top
grossing films in history," he said. "Ob
viously it's striking a chord. It also has
been surrounded by controversy from
the start. The Office for Religious Life
and the Department of Religious Stud
ies want to help shed light on this phe
nomenon."
Prof. Robert C. Gregg, a specialist
in the history of Christianity, will be
one of three panelists. Gregg said the
panel "should be provocative of good
discussion."
Gregg also said that the movie could

be examined from three perspectives.
"First, how does its presentation of
the arrest and execution of Jesus
'square' with early Christian Gospel
accounts?" Gregg explained. "Second,
how do we see the movie: as a movie,
or as advocacy? Lastly, what is the
film's place and importance in whatev
er conflicts over 'values' are unfolding
on campuses; in public squares; and in
the political, religious and secular ide
ological dynamics at stake in interna
tional relations?"
Another participant in the panel
will be the Reverend Patrick Laßelle,
chair of Stanford Associated Religions
and director of the Catholic Communi
ty at Stanford. While Laßelle acknowl
edges, "trying to represent such a
broad cross-section will not be easy,"
he said he has an idea of what should be
discussed.
"From a Catholic perspective, I
would hope to point out some of the of
ficial church teaching about the ways in
which we would want and expect the
question of Christ's Passion to be por
trayed in the media," he said. "Also,
has there been an historical prejudice
induced by Catholic-influenced move
ments which would hold the present
Jewish community accountable for the
death of Jesus?"
McLennan and Laßelle both felt it
was important to address the effect
"The Passion" had on the Evangelical

Christian community. According to
Laßelle, this is largely due to the
film's "dramatic presentation of how
much Jesus suffered out of love for his
people."
Labelle added, "This is particularly
important when we ask whether or not
the idea of the Passion has been a cen
tral issue with Evangelical Christians
generally."
At least two of the panelists de
scribed strong reactions upon viewing
the film.
"Having read much about the film
before seeing it, I suffered the usual
surprise in such cases," Gregg said. "It
was not what I was led to believe by
critics and others I had heard talk
about it."
Laßelle had a different take on the
film aesthetically.
"I don't think much of the film," he
said. "I did not think it particularly
moving nor did I think it spectacular
other than in its graphic aspects. But,
then, Catholics have always spent
time meditating on the Passion while
not all Christians have. Some have,
but not all."
Also participating in the panel will
be Assistant Professor Charlotte Fon
robert, an expert in Talmudic Judaism.
The panel, entitled "The Passion
about 'The Passion of the Christ'",
will be held in Cubberley Auditorium
at 8 p.m.
