### DANDAN WU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Speaking yesterday at the Stanford Institute of International Studies, Norwegian minister of Fore
gin Affairs Jan Peterson advocated expanding the role of the United Nations and said that people need
to stand firm to fight terrorism because using protective measures is no longer sufficient.
"Evil is evil," Peterson said. "There is no excuse for that."
Throughout his speech, Peterson emphasized that global terrorism must be tackled with broad
based international cooperation and that all nations need to get on board.
He noted that since World War 11, Norway has regarded the United States as one of its strongest al
lies and developed similar values on common issues.
Norway fully supports the U.S. initiative against global terrorism, Peterson explained, but does not
support the war in Iraq because there is no clear legal mandate from the United Nations.
"Norway is a small country," Peterson said. "We believe security can only be achieved through mul
tilateral cooperation and by remaining committed to the United Nations."
Peterson also said that the United Nations needs to adapt to the new security situation and should
play a more prominent role in global affairs.
Peterson also mentioned the significance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
forming close trans-Atlantic ties with America and said that Norway would try its best to nurture this
tie.
One example, Peterson noted, was Norway's involvement in the NATO effort at peace-keeping and
reconstruction in Afghanistan, which has shown Norway's political willingness to take responsibility.
"Partnership is about both taking and giving," Peterson explained. "And Afghanistan reconstruc
tion is a top priority for all nations and thus becomes a critical junction in international cooperation."
Peterson said that Norway had always been concerned about the nuclear proliferation in Iran, Libya
and Pakistan and regarded it as a pressing danger.
He acknowledged that in some cases the use of military force is an indispensable means of building
peace, but he cautioned that it should be used with U.N. authorization, adding that the most important
elements brought to these nations would be rule of law and transparency.
"Norway has a longstanding position on humanitarian causes, and it is our moral responsibility to re
main engaged," he said.
