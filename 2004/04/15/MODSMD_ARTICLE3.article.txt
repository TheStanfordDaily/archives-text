# Upholding human rights
## Israeli minister Sharansky defends Israel's record 
### JESSICA BOROWICK 
Natan Sharansky, Israel's minister for Jerusalem
and Diaspora Affairs, spoke yesterday at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on human rights and democracy in the
Middle East. He defended Israel's human rights
record and emphasized ihe unique power of "stu
dents and housewives" to effect social change.
Early work with Andre Sakharov led to Sharan
sky's emergence as a leading Soviet dissident. He was
arrested in 1977, and after a conviction for treason
and espionage spent nine years in labor camps and
Soviet prison, where he endured torture and solitary
confinement in a "punishing cell."
Finally released in 1986, Sharansky joined his wife
in Israel, and the couple became two of the few non-
Americans to win the Congressional Gold Medal.
Sharansky has since held a number of ministerial po
sitions in the Israeli government, and formed a new
political party dedicated to addressing Soviet Jewry
immigration issues.
Once silenced by the KGB, Sharansky stressed the
importance of freedom of expression. Arrested for
voicing his beliefs, Sharansky pointed out that even
now, "in the middle of war," Israel tolerates criticism
as a democratic necessity.
In contrast to his experience living under Soviet
oppression. Sharansky argued that Israel arrests peo

ple not for their views, but for terrorist acts. When
pressed during the question and answer session, Sha
ransky admitted that administrative arrests do take
place, but that "Israel is doing well at keeping a stan
dard."
He argued that Israel, although criticized world
wide, is the "only place in the Middle East where
human-rights principles are respected."
Senior Victoria Schwartz said that Sharansky ad
dressed accusations of what he called his own "chutz
pah," which is Yiddish for "nerve."
"I am very impressed with how he addressed the
paradox of being an Israeli minister and a human
rights advocate," Schwartz said.
To illustrate his state's commitment to human
rights, Sharansky presented the April 2002 action
in Jenin, a Palestinian refugee camp on the West
Bank. According to Sharansky, efforts to "avoid
massive killing of civilians" while raiding the
refugee camp to "'destroy the centers [of terrorist
activity]" led the Israeli government to pursue the
operation without artillery or planes. Instead, said
Sharansky, Israeli soldiers went door to door at
great personal risk, in an operation whose ultimate
legality has become a question for the Israeli
Supreme Court.
On democracy in the Middle East, Sharansky also
had much to share. Recalling times when democracy

was considered an impossibility for Russians and
Japanese, Sharansky branded the idea that "Arabs
and democracy are like oil and water" as racist, and
stated that not only are "all people created equal" but
in fact "all the peoples are created equal." Further
more. he suggested that Palestinians are the group in
the Middle East best positioned to forge a democrat
ic state.
Sharansky did not name any specific rising leaders
or potential partners in Palestine, but instead high
lighted the Palestinian middle class as an emerging
group of educated civilians with exposure to democ
racy.
In his final words, largely a message to the student
audience, Sharansky spoke of the "moral clarity and
courage" necessary to effect change. He encouraged
students to "not fight, but lead the establishment."
Clearly affected by the talk, senior Michael Butler
said he agreed with much of Sharansky's message.
"In all internal and external affairs moral clarity is
very important," Butler said. "We lose sight of things,
but it's important to keep a grip on morality."
Sharansky speech, the first in a West Coast tour,
was presented by Hillel and the Stanford Israel Al
liance. His appearance was co-sponsored by the Car
avan for Democracy, Office of the President. ASSU
Speaker's Bureau, Israel Peace Initiative and Alpha
Epsilon Pi fraternity.
