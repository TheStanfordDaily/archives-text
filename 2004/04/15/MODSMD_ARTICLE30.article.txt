# Students support gay rights

### BRIAN HOLBROOK DAILY BRUIN 
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES â€”The Unit
ed States Student Association and college stu
dents nationwide are calling their legislators
Wednesday to garner support fora bill that
would make immigration easier for the same
sex partners of U.S. citizens.
The Permanent Partners Immigration Act
would allow U.S. citizens and lawful perma
nent residents who are in a permanent same
sex partnership to sponsor their partners for
immigration purposes.
The University of California at Los Angeles
is a member campus of USSA and helps fund
the organization through a portion of its stu
dent fees.
Currently, there is no legal recognition for
same-sex couples under immigration law, and
many couples are separated when one partner
moves to the United States.
The legislation has been co-sponsored by
Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt.
Nadler said in a statement, "My bill only de
mands that those people in same-sex partner
ships receive equal treatment to those who can
get legally married."
Nadler first introduced the bill in 2000 and
has reintroduced it several times since then,
sometimes timing it with Valentine's Day.
The bill has drawn fire from conservative
groups who say it would chip away at the insti
tution of marriage.
"Homosexual activists are nibbling around
the edges, trying to validate their version of
marriage without confronting the public head
on," said Robert Knight of the Culture and
Family Institute to the Associated Press on
Nov. 23,2003.
The PPIA would add the term "or perma
nent partner" to sections of the Immigration
and Naturalization Act that apply to legally
married couples.

The bill would also apply the same restric
tions and enforcement standards to same-sex
couples as those in legal marriages, including
being subject to up to five years in prison or a
$250,000 fine for contracting a fraudulent mar
riage license.
The bill also requires bi-national couples to
provide proof they meet the definition of "per
manent partners."
"In addition to PPIA's positive effects for
college students in bi-national same-sex rela
tionships, PPIA would improve the quality of
education for all U.S. college students by al
lowing more college faculty and staff to remain
in the U.S. with their partners," USSA Presi
dent Rebecca Wasserman said in a statement.
Nicholas Sakurai, director of the Lesbian,
Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Student Em
powerment Project at USSA Foundation,
said the act would allow international stu
dents to obtain visas regardless of same-sex
partnership.
Currently, more than a dozen other coun
tries allow the sponsoring of a same-sex part
ner for immigration.
Matt Kaczmarek, external vice president of
the Undergraduate Students Association
Council, said the PPIA is just one part of a
strategy to make it easier for students regard
less of race, sexual orientation or other factors,
to access higher education.
He added that if the law were enacted, it
would make higher education institutions
more accessible to students wishing to study
abroad and to bring a partner.
Kian Boloori, chair of the UCLA Queer Al
liance, said, "The queer alliance is definitely
for the PPIA. ... Immigration is another field
that shows the discrepancy between what mar
ried couples get and what same sex-couples are
afforded. ... This act is a step toward equality
for same-sex couples."
Other supporters of the legislation include
the National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce as
well as the American Civil Liberties Union.
