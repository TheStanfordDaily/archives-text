# Battling the AIDS dragon
## An interview with public health figure Paul Farmer 
### LAUREN GONG GUEST COLUMNIST 
A conversation about HIV / AIDS public
health work is simply not complete without
mentioning Dr. Paul Farmer, best known as
co-founder of the non-profit "Partners in
Health" and for his health work in rural Haiti.
Farmer spoke on campus this last week dur
ing the Stanford for Haiti week at the medical
school. I caught this renowned public health
figure in between his power-packed schedule
to learn a little more about his work.
In an Interview with The Daily, Farmer
commented on global health, current pro
jects and provided advice for students who
are interested in pursuing careers in the
health field.
The Daily: Why did you choose to focus
on Haiti?
Paul Farmer I had worked with migrant farm
workers — well, not really worked with mi
grant farm workers — but I had been inter
ested in and writing about [farm workers] as
an undergraduate and I met quite a few
Haitians. They were living under very diffi
cult circumstances and I was curious as to why
they would leave their home country to come
and work in very poor conditions, so I asked
one of the Haitians just that question. And he
said "Well, have you ever been to Haiti?"
And I said no. So he said "Well, you should go
and [then] you can ask me again."
Then I went to Haiti and never left. I'm
still working in the same place. In fact, I
still live in the same village I went to in May
of 1983.
TD: What keeps you there?
PF: Now I'm a doctor, and there is just a huge
burden of disease there ... If I got run over by
a truck, the quality of medical care in Boston,
(where I live,] is not going to suffer... I find it
very compelling work.
TO: What do you see as a realistic approach
to solving these major global health crises?
What do you think needs the most attention
right now?
PF: Any pragmatic engagement is necessari
ly realistic. [When] you are involved in a pro
ject that takes on global health inequalities, it
will be realistic based on definition. Policy can
be unrealistic, but projects themselves tend to
be grounded in the everyday concerns of pa
tients. I just get back to these first principles of
identifying the problem ... [then] being per
sistent and humble about it.
People say it is not realistic to treat AIDS
in Haiti and Malawi, and you just show that
[way of thinking] to be faulty by doing it.
TD: Zanmi Lasante, the sister organization
of "Partners in Health" (both of which have
programs such as a full-service hospital, HIV
/ TB Treatment facilities, a women's health
center, schools and cottage industries) has
proven to be a great success in Haiti. Do you
think it is something that can be replicated to
raise the standard of living in other develop
ing countries?

PF: Sure I do. [Zanmi Lasante j required a ton
of sweat equity and a lot of resources, but if
you can do it in rural Haiti, you can do it any
where else. A lot of people who were former
ly unemployed [near my clinic] are now work

ing in the health care sector so I think that's
good, too.
TD: What are some of the obstacles you faced
when creating Zanmi Lasante?
PF: No money, no resources. If someone is a
diabetic and they don't have insulin, all of
the good will in the world will not be that im
portant if insulin isn't in the equation.
TD: Right now you have to maintain a balance
between being a professor at Harvard Univer
sity, traveling between Haiti and your other
work. How do you maintain that balance?
PF: Barely. It is very hard. The real answer is
that I work with a lot of great people who are
committed to work. You can only do this kind
of work in teams, right? In Haiti [for exam
ple], if the success of the project was depen
dent on my presence, then I couldn't be here
at Stanford.
TD: Do you have any advice for students
who are looking to get involved or who are
looking to promote awareness here on a
college campus?
PF: I would say, be persistent and be humble.
I see students who say "I can't get into this
work" or "I don't see a way." But you're not
going to have a prepackaged form of engage
ment with some of the poorest populations in
the world. Students have to make an invest
ment in shaping those experiences.
I think it's just very difficult work. There
are a lot of disappointments in it and a lot of
defeats which engenders a welcome humility.
It's better to be humble if you are in this line
of work, rather than being arrogant about
your prospects to change the world or make
everybody better.
Another thing I would say is that when
you're a student, your job is to learn and to
study, and I think students should do that...
Don't give up this great time in your life in
order to do something else.
At the same time, there's a way to be an ac
tivist and a way to be engaged in this stuff
even when you're far away from Haiti or
Africa or Oakland — even when you're in a
sanctuary like Stanford. There are all sorts of
challenges close by and far away, and finding
a little bit of time to be involved in these chal
lenges, I think, is a good thing.
