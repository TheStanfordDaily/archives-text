# Ash builds on fathers legacy
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
From the moment his father held him for the first
time, Jonny Ash was supposed to play baseball.
Wil Ash, a self-proclaimed part-time accountant and
full-time baseball coach, picked up his newborn son on
September 11, 1982, and said, "You'll be a shortstop, a
second baseman, go to law school or medical school,
and after that you can make up your own mind."
Growing up in Oakland, Calif., Stanford's soft-spo
ken senior third baseman — a converted middle infield
er — was also supposed to go to school at California.
After all, his prescient father, who used a tennis rac
quet to teach right-handed Jonny to swing left-handed
at the Castro Valley courts when he was three, and
coached him until high school, was a catcher for the
Bears from 1971-73.
"I was always at the Cal alumni games with my dad
and worked out on the field a lot when I was in high
school," Ash said. "I guess from birth I was supposed to
go to Cal. My dad says if you'd prick me I'd still bleed
Bear blue."
But Ash ultimately chose to wear Cardinal red.
Ash earned All-State honors as a shortstop and led
his team to back-to-back league championships at
Bishop O'Dowd High School, where he batted an as
tounding .598 during his senior season. In hindsight,
the impetus for his decision to cross the Bay and bypass
the familiarity of Berkeley and his father's legacy at
Cal is clear.
"I'm a competitor and I love being the best," Ash
said. "I love winning and when it's all said and done,
Stanford's better academically and it has a better base
ball program as far as I'm concerned."
Still, the choice was a difficult one.
"It was harder on Jonny [than on me]," said his
father, who batted .228 and hit four home runs dur
ing his career at Cal. "He wanted to go to Cal be
cause I went to Cal. I told him, 'That was then, this
is now.'"
"He was very supportive of my decision to go to
Stanford because he knew that it was what I wanted,"
Ash said. "He wanted me to be my own person, my own

individual and seek my own path."
While he has established himself as
one of Stanford's toughest outs and a
bona fide everyday starter in this, his final
season on the Farm, Ash's path at Stan
ford has not always been smooth.
Used primarily as a designated hitter.
Ash started 25 games and hit .327 as a
freshman, but vying for time in the field
behind senior standout Chris O'Rior
dan the following year.
Ash was used exclusively as a pinch
hitter and saw only 24 at-bats.
"It was a blessing in disguise," his fa
ther said. "It made him a man. It just
wasn't his time and it challenged him
even harder."
Ash leaned heavily on his dad that sea
son. as he has throughout his career and
life, for matters that stretch beyond the
game of baseball.
"In terms of being there for me, he's
been my coach, my spiritual advisor, my
mentor and my psychologist," said Ash of
Wil, whose own father died when he was
13. "He's really probably the only person
who can get inside my head and get me
ready to play the game. Whether I'm sit

ting on the bench waiting fora chance to
play or out there everyday, he knows how
to keep me going."
Evidencing the tough skin that comes
with being the quintessential coach's son,
and no ill effects from a season spent pre
dominantly on the bench. Ash made the
most of his opportunity to play everyday
last year.
Making the transition to third base,
he batted .314 in 47 starts and hit one of
the most memorable home runs in
Stanford history — a two-run blast off
Cal State-Fullerton's flame-throwing
closer, Chad Cordero, to propel the
Cardinal to a 7-5 comeback victory
over the Titans and a spot in the Cham
pionship Series.
Incidentally, the home run was the
first of Ash's career. His second came
two days later.
Offseason hours in the weight room
have paid off at the plate this season, as
Ash has already set new career highs for
home runs (four) and runs scored (40)
and is on pace to shatter his previous
bests in nearly every other major offen
sive category. Ash is second on the team
with a .383 average, boasts the best strike
out-to-at-bat ratio of any Cardinal regu
lar and is a large reason Stanford is off to
one of its best starts in school history.
"He's just so consistent and I know
what I'm going to get from him," said

Stanford head coach' Mark Marquess.
"1 have a lot of respect for him because
he really did have such a tough sopho
more year."
As he takes the field for the first game
of his last series against Cal tonight, it is
unlikely that any regrets about choosing
Stanford will creep into Ash's mind.
The Cardinal is 9-0 against the Bears
in games that he has started. Mere coin
cidence? Not when you consider Ash's
impressive .500 average (19-for-38) in
those games, including eight straight
multiple-hit games against the Bears.
Ash tallied seven hits to go along with six
runs in a three-game sweep at Berkeley
in late February.
"There's a little something extra inside
me when I go out and play against Cal,"
Ash said.
And a little extra special to watch
for his father, who doesn't hesitate
when asked whether he or his son is the
better player.
"No question he is," he said. "I didn't
work as hard. He has far surpassed his old
man, and I'm very proud of that. I've had
more highs coaching Jonny than I ever
had as a player."
Once upon a time, Jonny Ash was sup
posed to go to Cal. Four years after the
fact, it's clear: He is right where he is sup
posed to be, helping Stanford win games,
and no small thanks to his dad.
