# Ash builds on fathers legacy
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
From the moment his father held him for the first
time, Jonny Ash was supposed to play baseball.
Wil Ash, a self-proclaimed part-time accountant and
full-time baseball coach, picked up his newborn son on
September 11, 1982, and said, "You'll be a shortstop, a
second baseman, go to law school or medical school,
and after that you can make up your own mind."
Growing up in Oakland, Calif., Stanford's soft-spo
ken senior third baseman — a converted middle infield
er — was also supposed to go to school at California.
After all, his prescient father, who used a tennis rac
quet to teach right-handed Jonny to swing left-handed
at the Castro Valley courts when he was three, and
coached him until high school, was a catcher for the
Bears from 1971-73.
"I was always at the Cal alumni games with my dad
and worked out on the field a lot when I was in high
school," Ash said. "I guess from birth I was supposed to
go to Cal. My dad says if you'd prick me I'd still bleed
Bear blue."
But Ash ultimately chose to wear Cardinal red.
Ash earned All-State honors as a shortstop and led
his team to back-to-back league championships at
Bishop O'Dowd High School, where he batted an as
tounding .598 during his senior season. In hindsight,
the impetus for his decision to cross the Bay and bypass
the familiarity of Berkeley and his father's legacy at
Cal is clear.
"I'm a competitor and I love being the best," Ash
said. "I love winning and when it's all said and done,
Stanford's better academically and it has a better base
ball program as far as I'm concerned."
Still, the choice was a difficult one.
"It was harder on Jonny [than on me]," said his
father, who batted .228 and hit four home runs dur
ing his career at Cal. "He wanted to go to Cal be
cause I went to Cal. I told him, 'That was then, this
is now.'"
"He was very supportive of my decision to go to
Stanford because he knew that it was what I wanted,"
Ash said. "He wanted me to be my own person, my own
