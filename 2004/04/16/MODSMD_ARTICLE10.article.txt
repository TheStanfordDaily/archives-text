# Student organizations regroup after nine special-fees denials
## 
### JENNIFER MARTINEZ 
Nine student groups were dealt
blows when they failed to secure spe
cial-fees funding in last week's elec
tion. Many of these groups are look
ing at drastic cuts, including shrink
ing the Big Game bonfire and halving
the Mind's Eye's production run.
The most controversial result of
the election was the rejection of spe
cial-fees funding for MEChA, a Chi
cano / Latino student group. With
"yes" votes at 49.48 percent, the

group just missed receiving spe
cial-fee funding.
According MEChA member
Araceli Rodriguez, a freshman,
the loss wasn't just for the
group, but for the Chicano /
Latino community as a whole.
"When I heard the results, I
immediately thought of the oth
ers (groups] that were going to
he hurt," she said. "Thirteen
percent of the special fees go to
MEChA itself. People think it's
MEChA's special fee, but it's re
ally not. For example, it goes to
El Centro as well. It's like the
whole community's special fee."
Many students attributed
the organization's surprising
loss to The Stanford Review's
article released last year relat
ing MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan. Senior Sammy Stefanki
said. "I think they should have
gotten the special fees, but I
can understand why they didn't
get it because of all the contro-

versy with The Review."
Although many Stanford students
agreed with Stefanki's statement, Ro
driguez said she disagreed.
"I don't think we didn't pass be
cause people are anti-MEChA," she
said. "The campaign for special fees
wasn't organized."
In an attempt to change its image
and increase student support, MEChA
has considered changing its name and
sponsoring more events with the Stu
dents of Color Coalition.
Despite the disappointing result of

the election, MEChA members said
they will continue the group's mission
to serve the Chicano / Latino and
Stanford community.
"We're not broke," Rodriguez
said. "The financial situation isn't
what bothers us. It's that the commu
nity didn't come together to cam
paign. It shows how not united we are
right now."
