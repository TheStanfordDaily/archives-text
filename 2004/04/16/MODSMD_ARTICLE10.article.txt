# Student organizations regroup after nine special-fees denials
## 
### JENNIFER MARTINEZ 
Nine student groups were dealt
blows when they failed to secure spe
cial-fees funding in last week's elec
tion. Many of these groups are look
ing at drastic cuts, including shrink
ing the Big Game bonfire and halving
the Mind's Eye's production run.
The most controversial result of
the election was the rejection of spe
cial-fees funding for MEChA, a Chi
cano / Latino student group. With
"yes" votes at 49.48 percent, the

group just missed receiving spe
cial-fee funding.
According MEChA member
Araceli Rodriguez, a freshman,
the loss wasn't just for the
group, but for the Chicano /
Latino community as a whole.
"When I heard the results, I
immediately thought of the oth
ers (groups] that were going to
he hurt," she said. "Thirteen
percent of the special fees go to
MEChA itself. People think it's
MEChA's special fee, but it's re
ally not. For example, it goes to
El Centro as well. It's like the
whole community's special fee."
Many students attributed
the organization's surprising
loss to The Stanford Review's
article released last year relat
ing MEChA to the Ku Klux
Klan. Senior Sammy Stefanki
said. "I think they should have
gotten the special fees, but I
can understand why they didn't
get it because of all the contro-

versy with The Review."
Although many Stanford students
agreed with Stefanki's statement, Ro
driguez said she disagreed.
"I don't think we didn't pass be
cause people are anti-MEChA," she
said. "The campaign for special fees
wasn't organized."
In an attempt to change its image
and increase student support, MEChA
has considered changing its name and
sponsoring more events with the Stu
dents of Color Coalition.
Despite the disappointing result of

the election, MEChA members said
they will continue the group's mission
to serve the Chicano / Latino and
Stanford community.
"We're not broke," Rodriguez
said. "The financial situation isn't
what bothers us. It's that the commu
nity didn't come together to cam
paign. It shows how not united we are
right now."
Members of the Axe Committee,

MEChA 49.48%
ED4Youth (Educational Democracy for Youth) 49.04%
Stanford Axe Committee 48.69%
Stanford Bioscience Quarterly 48.38%
Mind's Eye 47.11%
FACES (Forum for American Chinese Exchange at Stanford) 44.79%
Stanford Progressive 44.56%
Cardinal Competitive Cheer 40.06%
ISIS (Innovative Student Information Services) * 52.29%
* ISIS did not pass because it was not supported by at least 15%^ftfTg_^sociation^
which sponsors various Big
Game-related events, also ex
pressed disappointment with the
election's outcome.
"It's disheartening that your
group doesn't get a lot of support
from the students," said sopho
more Amy Daley. "When 1
looked at the actual distribution,
we were right on the bubble. It
was really close."
As a result of the committee's fi
nancial cuts, next year's Big Game
celebration is one of the events that
will be seriously affected.
"The Big Game bonfire will be
totally different next year," Daley
said. "There probably won't be a
bonfire and fireworks; the prices
of security, fireworks and equip
ment have gone up."
Although last week's election
results were disappointing for Axe
Comm. the group has already
begun meetings to come up with so
lutions to budget cuts and is making
plans to become a more integral
part of the student community.
As for next year's plans to in
crease student support, Daley
said, "We're going to open [Axe
Comm] up and make it more visi
ble to people. Stanford has a lot of
rich traditions that go back many
years, and a lot of Stanford stu
dents don't know about them.
[They don't know] about the
pranks pulled on Cal, and the
pranks they've pulled on us. It's a
cool rivalry and opportunity for
Stanford students to support our
athletic teams."
According to Daley, the Axe
Committee's main goal for the fol
lowing year is to be "more stu
dent-involved rather than a club
at football games, which is what
people see."
Innovative Student Information
Services (ISIS) has endeavored to
keep Stanford students aware of
campus events through the use of
communication technology. With
out special fees, the group's ability
to install more video display
screens to advertise events around
campus is in jeopardy.
Junior Josh Shipp, a member of

ISIS, noted, "Specifically with this
group, people don't realize what
ISIS does." Shipp also chairs the
ASSU Undergraduate Senate.
Out of the 4,896 students who
voted in last week's election, ISIS
received 52.29 percent yes votes,
but still lacked approval from 15
percent of the total student body,
which it needed to receive the spe
cial fees.
"The events@stanford.edu sys
tem will grow a bit more slowly,"
Shipp said. "We will have to put
screens where its maximum bene
fit is to the student body."
Although there were various
factors that contributed to the
rejection of special fees for the
nine groups, student organiza
tions and voters said that the
main factor was probably a lack
of publicity.
"If I didn't know much about
the group, then I abstained from
voting for them," said freshman
Coral Taylor. "If I had known
more about the groups, I would
have voted differently."
Junior Zachary Levine, presi
dent of Forum for American /
Chinese Exchange at Stanford
(FACES), a group that also did
not receive special fees, made a
similar observation.
"It doesn't seem to me there's
any rhyme or reason, there's no pat
tern," he said. "People guess from
the name; people vote on impulse."
Levine explained that the
money requested by FACES
would have been utilized to bring
speakers to campus.
"[The voters] could have said
that's what the [ASSU] Speaker's
Bureau is for.and I can under
stand that," he said.
The Mind's Eye, a literary mag
azine, will also have to cope with
out special fees this year. The
group is debating a reduced print
run, producing thinner issues,
containing less color artwork in its
journal and printing one issue an
nually rather than two.
Beyond the initial disappoint
ment, shock and spontaneous
plans to cut back on activities,
each one of the student organiza
tions will survive for the next year.
"We will keep doing what
we're doing, we're not motivated
by special fees," Levine said.
