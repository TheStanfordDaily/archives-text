# Opinions vary about election
## 
### MARISA C. JUAREZ 
While members of the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate and Graduate Student Council ponder
whether or not to certify last week's ASSU exec
utive election, a similar debate is taking place
within dorms and hallways. Though few students
admitted that the campaign e-mails which may
have violated election rules influenced their
votes, opinions varied on whether the e-mails no
ticeably changed the election, which was decided
by just 300 votes.
Around campus this week, some students said
they were hoping fora new election while others
wanted to put the controversy behind them.
Sophomore Diego Martin, a member of
MEChA, said he feels the need fora re-election
after the alleged campaign code violations com
mitted by the slate ol senior Mikey Lee and junior
Dylan Mefford.
"1 would have serious problems with the
ASSU certifying this [presidential] election,"
Martin said. "[The ASSU] needs to send the mes
sage that this sort of campaigning will not be al
lowed in future elections."
Junior John Serna agreed.
"It's hard to tell i! this scandal actually affect
ed the election, [but] a re-election would be the
way to go," Serna said.
Controversy over the Lee-Mefford slate's
campaign strategies began when unofficial en
dorsements and e-mails started circulating
to students' inboxes after voting had already
begun. An message from senior Nick Ro

driguez. as well as both the Junior and Senior
Class presidents, were among the e-mails
brought before the Elections Commission as
possible violations.
Dave Singh, a junior who helped flyer for the
Lee-Mefford slate, followed the campaign close
ly and defended the candidates' legitimacy.
"Nick Rodriguez was external to the slate," Singh
said. "The candidates can't control everything."
Many students debated whether the e-mails
actually influenced election results, and few were
certain which way the e-mails drove voting.
Junior Jordan Husband said that he was disap
pointed by behavior of the executive slates.
"The extensive abuse of this year's election
made me rather apathetic towards the whole
process," he said. "I found I couldn't support
either of the 'major two' slates after the blatant
way they and their supporters ignored cam
paign policy."
Since Lee and Mefford won the election
by a margin of about 300 votes, others argued
that they would have won even without the
scandal. Singh said he believed that the e-mails
turned people off voting, but did not change
the outcome.
"It was like, 'what is this [e-mail]'?" Singh
said. "Even if the e-mail was wrong, the margin
was big enough that the student body showed
what they wanted."
Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin, a ju
nior, said that the Commission did not see any
changes in the voting trend after Nick Ro
driguez's e-mail — a letter titled "The Ugly Side

of the ASSU" — was sent to 11,746 Stanford e
mail addresses. Martin said that most students
tend to vote on the first day of elections, "regard
less of e-mails or endorsements."
"We cannot make any real assertions about
the impact of the campaign emails," Martin
added. "Our evidence is correlational, and we
cannot know what went on in the minds of
the voters."
Some students thought the Senate was too
harsh in its initial review of the election, and felt
the need to move on from the scandal.
"I hope they don't sacrifice practicality."
Singh said. "What the students intended was to
bring in the Lee-Mefford slate."
Overall, the scandal does not seem to have
affected students' respect for the ASSU, but
some were waiting eagerly for the results of
the certification.
"The integrity of the ASSU is on the line,"
said sophomore Mojan Movassate. "It does not
bode well that two senators simply left office in
the middle of their terms and the future execu
tive branch is mired in controversy even before
taking office."
Still, most students thought that there was lit
tle the ASSU could have done to avoid the cam
paign code violations.
"You can't hold the ASSU responsible for
what's been going on," Serna said. "But this
whole scandal does make you question why what
happened happened."

either of the 'major two' slates after the blatant
way they and their supporters ignored cam
paign policy."
Since Lee and Mefford won the election
by a margin of about 300 votes, others argued
that they would have won even without the
scandal. Singh said he believed that the e-mails
turned people off voting, but did not change
the outcome.
"It was like, 'what is this [e-mail]'?" Singh
said. "Even if the e-mail was wrong, the margin
was big enough that the student body showed
what they wanted."
Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin, a ju
nior, said that the Commission did not see any
changes in the voting trend after Nick Ro
driguez's e-mail — a letter titled "The Ugly Side

of the ASSU" — was sent to 11,746 Stanford e
mail addresses. Martin said that most students
tend to vote on the first day of elections, "regard
less of e-mails or endorsements."
"We cannot make any real assertions about
the impact of the campaign emails," Martin
added. "Our evidence is correlational, and we
cannot know what went on in the minds of
the voters."
Some students thought the Senate was too
harsh in its initial review of the election, and felt
the need to move on from the scandal.
"I hope they don't sacrifice practicality."
Singh said. "What the students intended was to
bring in the Lee-Mefford slate."
Overall, the scandal does not seem to have
affected students' respect for the ASSU, but
some were waiting eagerly for the results of
the certification.
"The integrity of the ASSU is on the line,"
said sophomore Mojan Movassate. "It does not
bode well that two senators simply left office in
the middle of their terms and the future execu
tive branch is mired in controversy even before
taking office."
Still, most students thought that there was lit
tle the ASSU could have done to avoid the cam
paign code violations.
"You can't hold the ASSU responsible for
what's been going on," Serna said. "But this
whole scandal does make you question why what
happened happened."
