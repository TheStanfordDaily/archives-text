(U-WIRE) GAINESVILLE, Fla. — Calling his
presidential candidacy "a pretty stark choice" from
that of the current administration. Sen. John Kerry
promised to help college students cope with rising
tuition costs, if he is elected.
In an effort to engage younger voters, Kerry
kicked off a tour of college campuses Tuesday and an
afternoon teleconference with more than 130 stu
dent journalists from across the country.
College tuition nationwide has increased 28 per
cent throughout the past three years, he said, noting
the figure accounts for inflation.
"That has meant that around 220,000 young peo
ple have been priced out of college this year," he said.
Kerry laid out his plan to offer four years of
paid tuition in return for two years of local com
munity service.
He said students then could use the funds at the
school of their choice, but he noted a possible need
to "scale back" the number of people hoped to par
ticipate in the program.
Kerry bashed President Bush for slashing federal
income taxes while making less money available for
states to increase Perkins loans and Pell grants for
students.
According to his Web site, 3,226 Floridians were

"priced out" of higher education this school year.
In response, Kerry intends to enact both a $50-bil
lion student tax credit, amounting to $4,000 per stu
dent. and a $25-billion state tax and relief education
fund to assist states with their growing burden.
"[Bush] cut taxes for the wealthiest of Americans
and in the process cut assistance that goes to the
states," he said.
Kerry said he opposes the privatization of Social
Security and will not cut the benefits the ailing pro
gram doles out in order to save it.
"If we roll back the tax cuts and begin to be re
sponsible fiscally, the Social Security will be just
fine." he said, later adding, "I will guarantee Social
Security will be there through this century for your
generation and the next."
Kerry has indicated he plans to bolster the num
ber of men and women in the American military with
existing Pentagon funds by creating two divisions.
Asked if his plan to add the divisions to America's
fighting forces would require conscription, Kerry
quickly replied, "No. No draft."
He said the Bush administration has moved the
country backward on issues such as air and water
quality and educational policy, and he noted the im
portance of youth in politics.
"If young people will go out and ... do some of the
political work necessary in America, we can win back
a Congress that will change the priorities," he said.
