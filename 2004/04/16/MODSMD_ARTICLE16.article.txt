## Why did you come to Stanford? 
### 
They come from every direction, one after another,
finding you where you least expect it: Walking across
the Quad, coming out of the post office or sunbathing
topless in the Oval.
Campus tours.
When you're tired, hungover or just feeling fat and gen
erally inadequate, the last thing you want to do is interact
with a group of tourists. The worst is when you're biking and
they don't get out of your way — the tourists should treat a
Stanford tour as a zoo exhibit: We are in our natural habitat,
going about our everyday lives, not to be disturbed.

When you see a fellow
student rattling off facts
about Stanford that you like
ly never knew to a group of
curious visitors while walking
backwards at the same time,
what you really want to do is
scream out something about
how sketchy the tour guide is.
But you feel the pressure of
responsibility as a dedicated
Stanford student to follow in
the Stanford way. So you pull

up your britches, stand up a little straighter, stamp out the
joint you're smoking in between classes and put a smile on
your face that says, "Yeah. I'm worth it. And you're worth it
too — if you can get in."
But the thing is, with acceptances for the Stanford Class
of 2008 having recently been sent out (ohhhhhhhhhhh 8!),
it's possible that many of these tourists are in fact future
classmates of ours. Think back to the trips you took to
prospective colleges back in the day and the insights you
gained from regular campus tours. You probably noticed
what the students looked like, how they interacted with each
other, perhaps overheard pieces of a few conversations and
were relieved to find that college students do still care about
stupid shit and aren't only concerned with important current
events. Tours can be a good way to see briefly into the "real"
life of a Stanford student, when we're not trying to impress.
Some of us may not feel the need to buck up and look pre
sentable in front of campus tour groups. Well thank God
Stanford has other things going for it — our campus really
does speak for itself. Gorgeous landscaping, those incompa
rable red roofs, a giant phallic symbol that secretly houses an
evil conservative think-tank and of course, Union Square
dining in Tresidder.
If there is anyone out there that hasn't had a chance to
sample the fine cuisine of Union Square, heed this valuable
advice — do it. We recently did, and we are much more sat
isfied with our Stanford Dining experiences as a whole be
cause of it. We really feel that Union Square is a valuable re
source for recruiting new students to campus, and with admit
weekend less than a week away, perhaps Stanford students
should familiarize themselves with this land o'plenty ahead
of time.
We all remember going to student unions on other college
trips and noting how good the food was, ignoring that 90 per
cent of the time we'd be eating in Ricker Dining. Well, the
good news is that Union Square accepts Cardinal Dollars
(not to be confused with points or regular money on your
card). You can get salads Pluto's-style, greasy-greasy pizza
(if you don't like grease you can shake it onto Caroline's
piece and she'll eat it), sushi, wraps / bowls and more.
Oh, and old-fashioned flavored sodas in glass bottles that
make you feel like a million bucks. Everyone will be jealous
of you.
Some of us used to be embarrassed of our inadequate stu
dent union, but with the recent addition of Union Square,
there is hope for the future of our school. The Coho still
needs some work, but the bustling, thriving, delicious, open
late services at Tresidder give us something to be proud of.
Perhaps all campus tours should now include a stop at Union
Square, because really, high-ranking quality education,
world-class sports, undergraduate research opportunities —
these things don't get people to pdy $40,000 a year. The way
to a student's heart is through his stomach.
