On April 3 in the San Fran
cisco Marriott, Tracy Oliver
stood slightly nervous, look
ing around at the 200 student
competitors for the Wheel of
Fortune's College Week pre
liminaries. The contest drew
students from all over Cali
fornia representing an array
of schools.
Wheel of Fortune, a tele
vision show where contes
tants compete by solving
word puzzles and spinning a
wheel to earn money, has in
trigued its audience by its
unique formula for winning.
The contestants must benefit
from a combination of pure
luck and an uncanny sense of
words. Anyone above the
age of 18 who has not previ
ously stared on any version
of Wheel of Fortune and has
not participated in any kind
of game or reality show in
the last year is eligible to be
a contestant.
Every week the show picks
up a different theme — Mom
and me, San Francisco, Back
to the Beach, to mention a few
— and relates that week's
show to its specific theme. On
the week of May 16, the
show's theme is College
Week, where the contestants
are pooled from college stu
dents all over the nation.
Oliver will be representing
Stanford on the show's Col
lege Week on nationwide tele
vision, which will be taped
this coming Monday.
Due to the large number of
turnouts, the show had to hold
preliminary rounds to select
those students who best fit the
nature of the show. A show
that mingles entertainment
value with intellectual stimu
lation, Wheel of Fortune
based its selection criteria on
mainly two points: showman
ship and the ability to solve
word puzzles.
"They based the decisions
on how clearly you could call
letters, articulation, presence
and how familiar you were
with the rules of the game,"
Oliver said.
"We were also made to take
a written test which measured
our aptitude to solve world
puzzles under a five minute
time constraint."

ning also depends largely on your
luck with the wheel — winning isn Y
entirely in your hands."

wi th apt puzzle solving abili
ties and full of enthusiasm
were eligible for the nation
wide taping.
As the source of the word
puzzles range from areas such
as pop culture and geogra
phy, Oliver said that there
was really not a specific way
to prepare for them except by
repeatedly viewing past
shows, knowing the game
regulations as if they were
second-nature, and building

common knowledge in a vari
ety of subjects.
"The trick of this game is
that winning also depends
largely on your luck with the
wheel — winning isn't entirely
in your hands," Oliver said.
Unlike purely academic
shows, Wheel of Fortune in
corporates a fun factor, where

the audience is amused by the
power of luck and how it can
either make or break a play
er's winning streak. Because
of its entertainment-oriented
dynamic, the show requires
lively and articulate players.
Oliver said that as a former
cheerleader in high school,
being enthusiastic was not a
bit of a problem.
"I just put myself in cheer
leader mode. I used to cheer in
high school, and I basically

drilled into my head the same
audition tips: Be loud, be spir
ited, be clear and be enthusi
astic," Oliver said.
Looking back at the audition
process, Oliver said that it was
very amusing. "We had to act
all crazy over fake money and
even pretend to spin a wheel
that wasn't even there," she re
called. Nevertheless, she is
glad that she took the experi
ence and ultimately qualified
for the final round.
"I think it's really cool be
cause first, it's an opportuni
ty for me to star on national
television, and second, to
represent my school I'm very
proud to attend. Also, I'm
from South Carolina, so I
know many people in my
hometown are proud and ex
cited that I was selected,"
Oliver said.
Of course, the benefits of
being in the show certainly
do not end at national fame
and pride in representing
one's school. There is still
the possibility that luck and
intellect will mingle with
just the right mixture on tap
ing day.
"I might even walk away
with some extra cash or even a
car!" Oliver said.
