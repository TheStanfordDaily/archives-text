# Ex-utilitymen lead Card against Cal
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
It seems every week you can point to anoth
er reason why the Stanford baseball team is off
to its best start in over two decades. The starting
pitching is maturing. The offense has too many
weapons. The bullpen is closing the door.
Here's another one for you: Two career utility
players are playing like starters — and one of
them is starting to make his way onto the Ail-
American level.
Both senior right fielder Brian Hall and
sophomore shortstop Chris Minaker have seen
plenty of action at several positions during their
Stanford careers, but both have taken their
games to a higher level this spring.
Hall and Minaker will be, as usual, in the
starting lineup tonight as Stanford (26-5,4-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) plays its first conference
home series against California.
The Cardinal is off to its fourth-best start in
school history after 31 games, and Hall has been
a big part of that explosion. He was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week for the first time in his ca
reer last week after hitting .538 with three home
runs and six RBIs at Oregon State.
More importantly, he carries a career-high
16-game hitting streak, in which his average has
jumped from a season-low .208 to .347, fourth
on the team.
"I knew I needed to play a bigger role this
year," he said. "In years past, I'd hit late in the
order and try to do all the little things. But, this
year, I've tried to step up my game and I've had
a much better approach at the plate."
Hall has been known more for his versatility
over the years than his hitting. He has started at
six different positions (first base, third base, all
three outfield spots and designated hitter) —
but is having quite a season.
Hall has already set a new career-high in
home runs (seven) and will probably surpass his
career highs in RBI (44, currently 31) and walks
(20, currently 13).
"I haven't been chasing as many pitches and

I've been looking for balls to drive rather than
balls to hit," he said. "Trying to hit the ball up
the middle and the other way has kept me on all
the pitches that I was pulling off before."
The model for Hall's new approach?
Look no further than his own team.
Hall says he's begun to patent his swing
after second baseman Jed Lowrie, who leads
the team in home runs (10) and batting aver
age (.388).
Specifically, Hall has tried to emulate what
Lowrie does with his hands — he gets his hands
farout in front when the bat is back so as to cre
ate a kick and a powerful swing.
"He's doing so many things right," Hall says
of his teammate. "I try to watch every single
swing of his because he's having such an amaz
ing year."
As if that's not enough. Hall's biggest asset to
this Cardinal club is probably his speed: He's
third in the Pac-10 with nine stolen bases and
provides a great option with which to hit-and
run when disciplined hitters like Sam Fuld and
Jonny Ash are at the plate.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess proba
bly put it best.
"Even if he's not hitting anything, he's al
ways valuable because of his speed," he said.
Meanwhile, Minaker, who spent the entire
2003 season backing up Tobin Swope at short
stop, is making the most of his opportunity.
After wresting the starting job from Chris Lewis
and Adam Sorgi, Minaker has shown flashes of
brilliance with the glove and the bat.
He's made only two errors in 66 chances and
helped create a dynamic double-play combina
tion with Lowrie. Also, after getting only 12 at
bats all of last year, Minaker had a big series in
Los Angeles two weeks ago when he went 5-for
-13 with a home run and four RBI.
Most importantly for Minaker, he's finally
settled on a position after being groomed for
shortstop, third base and second base in the
course of the last year and a half.
"I've just tried to go out there and play
with confidence now that I know where I'm
at," he said.
Minaker said he learned a lot being
the apprentice under Swope last season,
but it seems one piece of advice has
helped him greatly.
"Tobin, like myself, didn't have a great
arm, so he always made sure to make it
known that as soon as you get the ball,
you've got to get rid of it," Minaker said.
"He had the quickest exchange between his
glove and throwing hand."

As for the pitching end of the Cardinal's
game. Marquess said earlier this week that
he's going to take a little different approach
with his struggling starting rotation, which
has posted an awful 9.75 ERA in Stanford's
last six games.
"I'm going to have a shorter leash with
our guys, especially with the way our
bullpen has pitched recently," he said.
Look for David O'Hagan, Jeff
Stimpson — who was earlier named
Pac-10 pitcher of the week for his su
perb relief outings in Corvallis last
weekend — and Matt Manship to come
out of the pen early if the starters strug
gle this weekend.
First pitch tonight is 6 p.m. while games
Saturday and Sunday will begin at 1 p.m.

brilliance with the glove and the bat.
He's made only two errors in 66 chances and
helped create a dynamic double-play combina
tion with Lowrie. Also, after getting only 12 at
bats all of last year, Minaker had a big series in
Los Angeles two weeks ago when he went 5-for
-13 with a home run and four RBI.
Most importantly for Minaker, he's finally
settled on a position after being groomed for
shortstop, third base and second base in the
course of the last year and a half.
"I've just tried to go out there and play
with confidence now that I know where I'm
at," he said.
Minaker said he learned a lot being
the apprentice under Swope last season,
but it seems one piece of advice has
helped him greatly.
"Tobin, like myself, didn't have a great
arm, so he always made sure to make it
known that as soon as you get the ball,
you've got to get rid of it," Minaker said.
"He had the quickest exchange between his
glove and throwing hand."

As for the pitching end of the Cardinal's
game. Marquess said earlier this week that
he's going to take a little different approach
with his struggling starting rotation, which
has posted an awful 9.75 ERA in Stanford's
last six games.
"I'm going to have a shorter leash with
our guys, especially with the way our
bullpen has pitched recently," he said.
Look for David O'Hagan, Jeff
Stimpson — who was earlier named
Pac-10 pitcher of the week for his su
perb relief outings in Corvallis last
weekend — and Matt Manship to come
out of the pen early if the starters strug
gle this weekend.
First pitch tonight is 6 p.m. while games
Saturday and Sunday will begin at 1 p.m.

Freshman designated hitter Ryan Seawell and the Cardinal baseball squad take on the
Golden Bears this weekend. The team will be going for its third conference series win.
It seems every week you can point to anoth
er reason why the Stanford baseball team is off
to its best start in over two decades. The starting
pitching is maturing. The offense has too many
weapons. The bullpen is closing the door.
Here's another one for you: Two career utility
players are playing like starters — and one of
them is starting to make his way onto the Ail-
American level.
Both senior right fielder Brian Hall and
sophomore shortstop Chris Minaker have seen
plenty of action at several positions during their
Stanford careers, but both have taken their
games to a higher level this spring.
Hall and Minaker will be, as usual, in the
starting lineup tonight as Stanford (26-5,4-2 Pa
cific-10 Conference) plays its first conference
home series against California.
The Cardinal is off to its fourth-best start in
school history after 31 games, and Hall has been
a big part of that explosion. He was named Pac
-10 Player of the Week for the first time in his ca
reer last week after hitting .538 with three home
runs and six RBIs at Oregon State.
More importantly, he carries a career-high
16-game hitting streak, in which his average has
jumped from a season-low .208 to .347, fourth
on the team.
"I knew I needed to play a bigger role this
year," he said. "In years past, I'd hit late in the
order and try to do all the little things. But, this
year, I've tried to step up my game and I've had
a much better approach at the plate."
Hall has been known more for his versatility
over the years than his hitting. He has started at
six different positions (first base, third base, all
three outfield spots and designated hitter) —
but is having quite a season.
Hall has already set a new career-high in
home runs (seven) and will probably surpass his
career highs in RBI (44, currently 31) and walks
(20, currently 13).
"I haven't been chasing as many pitches and

I've been looking for balls to drive rather than
balls to hit," he said. "Trying to hit the ball up
the middle and the other way has kept me on all
the pitches that I was pulling off before."
The model for Hall's new approach?
Look no further than his own team.
Hall says he's begun to patent his swing
after second baseman Jed Lowrie, who leads
the team in home runs (10) and batting aver
age (.388).
Specifically, Hall has tried to emulate what
Lowrie does with his hands — he gets his hands
farout in front when the bat is back so as to cre
ate a kick and a powerful swing.
"He's doing so many things right," Hall says
of his teammate. "I try to watch every single
swing of his because he's having such an amaz
ing year."
As if that's not enough. Hall's biggest asset to
this Cardinal club is probably his speed: He's
third in the Pac-10 with nine stolen bases and
provides a great option with which to hit-and
run when disciplined hitters like Sam Fuld and
Jonny Ash are at the plate.
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess proba
bly put it best.
"Even if he's not hitting anything, he's al
ways valuable because of his speed," he said.
Meanwhile, Minaker, who spent the entire
2003 season backing up Tobin Swope at short
stop, is making the most of his opportunity.
After wresting the starting job from Chris Lewis
and Adam Sorgi, Minaker has shown flashes of
brilliance with the glove and the bat.
He's made only two errors in 66 chances and

tion with Lowrie. Also, after getting only 12 at
