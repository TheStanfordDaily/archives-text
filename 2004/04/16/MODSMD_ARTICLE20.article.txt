## Environmental policy promising

There are some ethical issues on which it is
reasonable to expect a respected univer
sity to be ahead of the national curve:
Fair treatment of workers, socially re
sponsible investments, a commitment to improv
ing the environment. On this last front, Stanford
has made stunningly impressive progress in re
cent months.
Though it has long been a hotbed of environ
mental research by professors working in several
different departments, Stanford had until recent
ly done little to facilitate interdisciplinary schol
arship on environmental issues. But University
President John Hennessy made the environment
the focus of his annual address yesterday, dis
cussing the potential of the recently announced
Stanford Institute for the Environment. We are
excited to see Stanford leaders both expressing a
commitment to improving the environment and
backing up their words with action.
Coming less than a year after the announce
ment of the Global Climate and Energy Project
(GCEP), the Stanford Institute for the Environ
ment is further evidence of the current Universi
ty administration's determination to make Stan
ford a world leader in the field. The new institute
will serve as a sort of umbrella for the Universi
ty's several existing environmentally focused re
search programs, including GCEP. This support
will be a boon to the many professors and re-

searchers already working here, and it may lure
new talent, as well.
In addition to these large-scale developments,
we hope to see the University continue to do the
small things necessary to demonstrate a sense of
environmental responsibility. The Carnegie Insti
tution recently dedicated a new building on cam
pus for its Global Ecology Department that ex
hibited innovations on the leading edge of sus
tainable building practices. With natural lighting
and ventilation, recycled building materials and
an energy-efficient "night sky" cooling system,
the building is a monument to forward-thinking
construction and design.
Granted, such fancy design ideas do not al
ways turn out perfectly, but if a university won't
take risks in an effort to advance the art and sci
ence of environmentally responsible architec
ture, who will?
Of course, the University doesn't need to start
building everything out of recycled redwood from
wine barrels, but it could do more to implement
sustainable building guidelines. It could explore
other creative ideas for efficiency, as well, such as
buying hybrid / electric Marguerites the next
time it needs a new fleet. That said, the Universi
ty's recent push toward environmental leadership
is truly admirable, and the Stanford community
should be proud of the steps the administration
has already taken.
