# THE

"Tjr "W" That's wrong with this pic-
/ ture? 1 got a bad grade on
%/ %/ the final fora class in my
T T major. 1 wasn't happy
with it, so I called my dad and he gave
nrie an A. Luckily, for the good of the
school, and of the education system in
general, that's not how college works.
You don't graduate with a 4.05 aver
age in philosophy without some long
mights of hard work and choosing not
to cut some corners.
Our president has failed to learn
t his simple rule. During his first year
in office, George W. Bush spoke over
occasional boos at the 2001 Yale
commencement where he told stu
dents, "Look where gentleman's Cs
can get you'." [Read: "Look what
happens when your father was presi
dent.] On Wednesday, the president
applied this oversight to his foreign
policy. Meeting with Israeli Prime
iMinister Ariel Sharon at the White
House, the two leaders agreed on a
new plan to end the now three-year
old war which has besieged the Israeli
and Palestinian people.
Yet there were no Palestinians at
i: his meeting. There were no Palestini
ans even involved with the negotia
tions surrounding this process. In a
"gentleman's C"-style innovation.
President Bush and Prime-Minister
Sharon innovated a new phenomenon
'in international relations: "Unilateral
peacemaking."
Not surprisingly, the result reeks of
lopsidedness. The new plan effectively
rules out the "right of return" for Pales
tinian refugees displaced during the

war of Israeli independence in 1948.
For the first time, it accepts that the
1967 borders are no longer "realistic
and that some settlements, due to their
size and age, will be considered perma-

nent. For its part, Is
rael agrees to remove
itself and its people
from some settle
ments in the Gaza
Strip and the West
Bank. This removal
includes 7,500 Israelis
from 21 Gaza settle
ments and 500 Israelis
from four settlements
in the West Bank

(200,000 Israelis have settled in the
West Bank alone since 1967).
The agreement departs dramatical
ly from the internationally legitimate
(and mutually accepted by both Is
raelis and Palestinians) "Road Map for
Peace" brokered by the United Na
tions, the European Union and the
United States in the summer of 2003.
That plan left the contentious issue of
the "right of return" for future negoti
ations, after the completion of trust
building measures such as halting ter
rorist attacks by the Palestinians and
the dismantling of settlements by the
Israelis. The Road Map also envi
sioned a two-state solution along the
pre-1967 borders.
The decision-making style and the
departure from the Road Map may
have derailed any chance of peace in
the near future. Yasser Arafat, chair
man of the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization, has hit the airwaves to

hammer home the "right of return"
issue. Other Palestinian leaders call the
plan a farce and wonder what would
happen if they gave Texas back to
Mexico. The whole of the Arab world
echoes their frustration.
President Bush is offering some
thing he doesn't have, and this is not
good for anyone. American analysts
point to election-year politics to ex
plain the new policy out of the White
House. Israel represents the most im
portant issue for many Jews in Ameri
ca, and with swing states like Ohio
playing home to large numbers of con
sistently-voting Jews, Karl Rove and
the White House election team is bet
ting that a new policy will pay where it
matters. It seems they've long since
given upon the Arab and Muslim vote.
To top it all off, this occurs against
the backdrop of the Sept. 11 hearings.
While a committee continues to grill a
parade of U.S. officials about the intel
ligence failure which allowed the Sept.
11 attacks, our president stirs up the
hornet's nest for the next attack right
across the street. After a year in Iraq,
the administration continues to ignore
the true nature of the Middle East it is
trying to reform. The Israeli / Palestini
an conflict remains by far the most ex
plosive issue of the region, and by
shunting aside Palestinian concerns.
Bush ensures more terrorism in Iraq
and more terrorism at home. This
time, his dad can't help him.
