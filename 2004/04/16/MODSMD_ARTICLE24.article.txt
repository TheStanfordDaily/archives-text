## The 						case for the war in Iraq 
### PETER BERKOWITZ 
A year after the elimination of
Saddam Hussein's murderous dicta
torship, a few months before the
Coalition Provisional Authority hands
over power to the Iraqi people and
with violence in Iraq on the upswing,
how do the Bush administration's ar
guments in support of Operation Iraqi
Freedom hold up?
Critics assert that those arguments
amount to two lies — Saddam's
weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
posed an imminent threat, and Iraq
cooperated with al-Qaeda in execut
ing the Sept. 11 attacks. In fact, the ad
ministration put forth five main argu
ments in favor of military action.
Those arguments were advanced by
the administration with varying inten
sity and frequency — and they hold
up, separately and together, reason
ably well.
First, in the build-up to war, the
Bush administration highlighted the
intolerable danger Saddam's WMD
posed. Its claims were consistent with
Clinton administration statements
dating back to 1998, and both were
rooted in the best available intelli
gence. Although we now know that
the intelligence was flawed, the Kay
report confirmed dozens of Iraqi
weapons programs and documented
Saddam's intention to restart pro
grams when possible. Dick Cheney's

assertion in the summer of 2002 that
the risk of inaction in Iraq was
greater than the risk of action was de
batable. But based on the evidence at
hand, and the terrifying new realities
Sept. 11 made manifest, it was a rea
sonable judgment.
Second, on September 21.2001, in
a nationally televised speech to a joint
session of Congress, President Bush
declared that the war on terror ex
tended to terrorist networks around
the world and to "any nation that con
tinues to harbor or support terrorism."
Although a link to Sept. 11 has not
been established, Saddam's trafficking
in terror is incontestable — among
other bloody ventures Iraq had been,
until the fall of Baghdad, Hamas'
biggest financial backer.
Third, the United States invoked
international law. In November 2002,
the administration persuaded the
United Nations Security Council to
unanimously pass Resolution 1441,
which warned of "serious conse
quences" if Iraq failed to provide a
thorough accounting of its weapons
and weapons programs and to com
pletely disarm. Hans Blix, a U.N.
weapons inspector, reported in De
cember 2002 that Iraq had failed to
provide the required account. In
March 2003, the United States upheld
the Security Council's integrity by im
plementing 1441 and sixteen previous
resolutions flouted by Iraq.

Fourth, humanitarian considera
tions counseled action. In addition to
the hundreds of thousands he con
signed to mass graves, and the dis
senters his henchmen fed alive into
meat grinders, Saddam exploited our
containment regime to divert oil-for
food money to his palaces and
weapons programs, leading to the
deaths, according to the United Na
tions Children's Fund estimates, of
60.000 Iraqi children a year.
Fifth, removing Saddam would
promote democracy in the Middle
East, an appealing prospect for all,
save perhaps for those in the region
who rule by fear and for those around
the world who profit from doing busi
ness with tyrants.
Reasonable people can differ.
Arguably, containment better served
U.S. national security interests, in
part because the establishment of
democracy in Iraq may yet prove be
yond our competence. The Bush ad
ministration has fallen short in edu
cating public opinion — both domes
tically and internationally regarding
Operation Iraqi Freedom. But what
cannot be denied, all things consid
ered, is the reasonableness of the case
that has been made.
