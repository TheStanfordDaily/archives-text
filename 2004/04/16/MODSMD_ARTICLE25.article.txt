An argument for the importance of the
Undergraduate General Fee
The Undergraduate General Fee
is divided into programming, commu
nity service and publications compo
nents. It makes up about $18 of the
quarterly ASSU fee. The Undergrad
uate Senate distributes this money
through the Appropriations and Pub
lications Board processes to hundreds
of student groups annually — up to
$6,000 apiece (and now $8,000 for
community service groups). The ma
jority of undergraduate student activi
ties at Stanford are funded this way,
though few people hear much about
it. As a result, students often hastily
request refunds from the program
ming, community service and publica
tions fees when requesting a fee re
fund, while they give greater consid
eration to special-fee refunds. I urge
students to educate themselves on the
organizations supported through the
general fee when requesting a refund.
To demonstrate what I perceive
to be a general lack of education sur
rounding general fees, I have com
piled a list of organizations funded
through the general fee whose finan
cial officer and / or president request
ed a refund from the corresponding
fee. Those with both officers request
ing a refund are denoted by a 112. This
does not include many group mem
bers who also requested general fee
refunds.

I write this letter to bring atten
tion to the importance of the general
fee and to encourage all students to
think hard about receiving refunds
from the general fee, especially those
involved in or benefiting from the
many programs the general fee
groups provide. The refund Web site
is open through today, and spring
quarter refunds (that have probably
carried over from previous quarters
automatically) can be retracted if so
desired.

ASSU election results should not count
In Wednesday's issue of The
Daily, I couldn't help but be disgusted
by the article discussing this years

election ("Election certification still
far from certain," April 14). The fact
that there was such egregious disre
gard for the rules of elections is baf
fling. And now. we the students have
to sit around watching what is essen
tially an illegal election go ahead and
be approved for the sake of unity.
That is utter bullshit. The fact is.
in the last few years the electoral pro
cess on campus has become a sham.
Smear campaigns have become the
norm and rules and regulations de
signed to ensure fairness have been
violated. It is baffling that Mikey Lee
can stand before the Undergraduate
Senate and say that he didn't think
that having people send supportive e
mails is "campaigning." Nice one
Slick Willy, just like violating an in
tern with a stogie isn't "sexual rela
tions."
But what can be done? What
mechanisms are in place for candi
dates to follow procedures? All 1
know is that this year's election was
disgusting, and considering how much
hell was raised over a bogus national
election in 2000,1 am shocked at the
lack of anger currently being voiced
by the student body. You all got
screwed. Now, before you think I am
bitter at having had my choice lose,
think again. I would have voted
Chappie if I could vote. Why Chap
pie ? Because the ASSU president
never does anything except get some
thing nice to put on his resume.

Smear campaigns have become the
norm and rules and regulations de
signed to ensure fairness have been
violated. It is baffling that Mikey Lee
can stand before the Undergraduate
Senate and say that he didn't think
that having people send supportive e
mails is "campaigning." Nice one
Slick Willy, just like violating an in
tern with a stogie isn't "sexual rela
tions."
But what can be done? What
mechanisms are in place for candi
dates to follow procedures? All 1
know is that this year's election was
disgusting, and considering how much
hell was raised over a bogus national
election in 2000,1 am shocked at the
lack of anger currently being voiced
by the student body. You all got
screwed. Now, before you think I am
bitter at having had my choice lose,
think again. I would have voted
Chappie if I could vote. Why Chap
pie ? Because the ASSU president
never does anything except get some
thing nice to put on his resume.
