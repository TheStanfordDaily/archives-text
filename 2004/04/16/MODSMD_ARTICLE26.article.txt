## Is exploitation funding our education? 
### DEREK KILNER KIOYOMI BURCHILL 
What would you do with $8.2 bil
lion? With that much money, you
could fund a word-class university,
providing cutting-edge research and
an elite education. However, as Stan
ford's investments continue to demon
strate, you could also support corrupt
regimes, irreparably damage the envi
ronment and profit from the exploita
tion of sweatshop workers worldwide.
Social responsibility in investing is
not a new issue, but it is one that re
mains to be taken seriously by our Uni
versity. Despite the precedent of di
vestment from apartheid South Africa
after over a decade of student pressure,
this University has not in recent years
put its money where its mouth is on the
issue of investment. That is, while we
contend to be an institution of high
moral character as an educational lead
er, we continue to invest in — and thus

financially benefit from — actions that
hurt other communities.
Recently, it was revealed that Stan
ford invests with Farallon Capital
Management, LLC, an entity headed
by a Stanford Graduate School of
Business alum and member of the
GSB advisory board, Tom Steyer.
Ranked as the fourth-largest hedge
fund in the world, Farallon boasts an
estimated $8 billion in capital from its
clients. Typically, one must have $1
million at minimum to invest with a
hedge fund, meaning that many of
their clientele are, in addition to very
wealthy businesspersons, institutional
investors like colleges and universities,
including Stanford, Yale, Princeton
and the University of Texas.
Unlike investments in publicly
traded companies, about which the
University discloses some amount of
information, hedge funds have found
their niche in an investment loophole,
allowing them to be much more secre

tive about their business practices and
to comply with fewer regulations. This
has enabled them to invest in so-called
"distressed assets," which often are
some of the worst perpetrators of
harmful business practices. The result
has been the proliferation of invest
ment in hedge funds in the last decade,
especially by universities that turn a
blind-eye to the implications of their
profits from these funds.
Farallon's investments have in
cluded a power plant in Indonesia that
supported the corrupt Suharto regime
there, an Argentinian shoe company
that failed to pay months of back
wages to sweatshop workers and Hal
liburton — immediately after it re
ceived lucrative military contracts to
rebuild Iraq. More recently, Farallon
became the largest share-holder in
Zinifex, an Australian mining compa
ny that is in contentious contract nego
tiations with its workers. A more de
tailed examination of Farallon's

record is available online at
http://www.unfarallon.info.
As members of the Stanford com
munity, we must ask: How much do we
truly care about our University and
our education benefiting financially
from the exploitation of others?
One of the products of the success
ful apartheid divestment campaign of
the 1970s and 1980s at Stanford was
the institution of the Board of Trustees
Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility, which was charged with
looking into the social impacts of the
University's investments. While the
panel includes student representatives
and can make recommendations, it
has no teeth. As so often happens in
response to student complaints, the
University pays lip service to the issue
of social responsibility without taking
concerted efforts to address these eth
ical crises.
While there is a framework, albeit
weak, for investigating public invest

ments, Stanford does not even reveal
with whom it invests privately, or any
information about such investments.
The Stanford Management Company
has not responded to repeated requests
for information — merely seeking in
vestment disclosure — about Stan
ford's investment in Farallon, though
they have acknowledged to the press
that they are aware of the concern.
If and when the Stanford Manage
ment Company does respond to the
requests, it will likely speak of the need
for secure investments in order to
maintain the University's high quality
of education and research. Stanford
should certainly make sound financial
decisions, yet we must also ask to what
extent we are willing to jeopardize our
integrity as an educational leader in
order to secure financial gains.
We do not believe that our Univer
sity should knowingly harm the lives,
environments and economies of peo
ple across the globe in order to in

crease its endowment.
Members of the Stanford commu
nity can begin to take action by signing
a petition urging Farallon to pressure
Zinifex to reach a solution with its
workers online at http://www.peti
tiononline.com/farallon/petition.html.
Only through standing up for the issue
of the social responsibility of our en
dowment and fighting for disclosure
can we as members of the Stanford
community truly claim that we are
committed to social justice and the re
sponsibility of higher education to the
greater good of society.

Today is a national day of action about
investment disclosure at over 60 college
campuses across the country. Derek
Kilner and Kiyomi Burchill are both
sophomores and members of the Stan
ford Student Coalition for Investment
Disclosure. They can be reached at

Business alum and member of the
GSB advisory board, Tom Steyer.
Ranked as the fourth-largest hedge
fund in the world, Farallon boasts an
estimated $8 billion in capital from its
clients. Typically, one must have $1
million at minimum to invest with a
hedge fund, meaning that many of
their clientele are, in addition to very
wealthy businesspersons, institutional
investors like colleges and universities,
including Stanford, Yale, Princeton
and the University of Texas.
Unlike investments in publicly
traded companies, about which the
University discloses some amount of
information, hedge funds have found
their niche in an investment loophole,
allowing them to be much more secre

tive about their business practices and
to comply with fewer regulations. This
has enabled them to invest in so-called
"distressed assets," which often are
some of the worst perpetrators of
harmful business practices. The result
has been the proliferation of invest
ment in hedge funds in the last decade,
especially by universities that turn a
blind-eye to the implications of their
profits from these funds.
Farallon's investments have in
cluded a power plant in Indonesia that
supported the corrupt Suharto regime
there, an Argentinian shoe company
that failed to pay months of back
wages to sweatshop workers and Hal
liburton — immediately after it re
ceived lucrative military contracts to
rebuild Iraq. More recently, Farallon
became the largest share-holder in
Zinifex, an Australian mining compa
ny that is in contentious contract nego
tiations with its workers. A more de
tailed examination of Farallon's

record is available online at

As members of the Stanford com
munity, we must ask: How much do we
truly care about our University and
our education benefiting financially
from the exploitation of others?
One of the products of the success
ful apartheid divestment campaign of
the 1970s and 1980s at Stanford was
the institution of the Board of Trustees
Advisory Panel on Investment Re
sponsibility, which was charged with
looking into the social impacts of the
University's investments. While the
panel includes student representatives
and can make recommendations, it
has no teeth. As so often happens in
response to student complaints, the
University pays lip service to the issue
of social responsibility without taking
concerted efforts to address these eth
ical crises.
While there is a framework, albeit
weak, for investigating public invest

ments, Stanford does not even reveal
with whom it invests privately, or any
information about such investments.
The Stanford Management Company
has not responded to repeated requests
for information — merely seeking in
vestment disclosure — about Stan
ford's investment in Farallon, though
they have acknowledged to the press
that they are aware of the concern.
If and when the Stanford Manage
ment Company does respond to the
requests, it will likely speak of the need
for secure investments in order to
maintain the University's high quality
of education and research. Stanford
should certainly make sound financial
decisions, yet we must also ask to what
extent we are willing to jeopardize our
integrity as an educational leader in
order to secure financial gains.
We do not believe that our Univer
sity should knowingly harm the lives,
environments and economies of peo
ple across the globe in order to in

crease its endowment.
Members of the Stanford commu
nity can begin to take action by signing
a petition urging Farallon to pressure
Zinifex to reach a solution with its
workers online at http://www.peti
tiononline.com/farallon/petition.html.
Only through standing up for the issue
of the social responsibility of our en
dowment and fighting for disclosure
can we as members of the Stanford
community truly claim that we are
committed to social justice and the re
sponsibility of higher education to the
greater good of society.

Today is a national day of action about
investment disclosure at over 60 college
campuses across the country. Derek
Kilner and Kiyomi Burchill are both
sophomores and members of the Stan
ford Student Coalition for Investment
Disclosure. They can be reached at

What would you do with $8.2 bil
lion? With that much money, you
could fund a word-class university,
providing cutting-edge research and
an elite education. However, as Stan
ford's investments continue to demon
strate, you could also support corrupt
regimes, irreparably damage the envi
ronment and profit from the exploita
tion of sweatshop workers worldwide.
Social responsibility in investing is
not a new issue, but it is one that re
mains to be taken seriously by our Uni
versity. Despite the precedent of di
vestment from apartheid South Africa
after over a decade of student pressure,
this University has not in recent years
put its money where its mouth is on the
issue of investment. That is, while we
contend to be an institution of high
moral character as an educational lead
er, we continue to invest in — and thus

financially benefit from — actions that
hurt other communities.
