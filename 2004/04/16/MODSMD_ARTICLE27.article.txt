## The
						conflict between the First Amendment and justice 
### PATRICK MATTIMORE 
Some of the media recently dis
played poor judgment when they re
vealed the name of a juror in the Tyco
mistrial: the inevitable fallout from
this is now upon the land. This past
Tuesday, the judge in the upcoming
Quattrone retrial ordered the media
not to reveal the names of jurors. The
New York Times, the San Jose Mer
cury News and other news sources re
sponded immediately.
The Times contacted its local
First Amendment guru, Floyd
Abrams, who allowed that the
judge's order "would be a direct
prior restraint on publication,
which is extremely unlikely to meet
First Amendment standards. Our
courts have basically all but totally
banned prior restraints on the pub
lication of information by newspa
pers, and 1 don't see any basis for
concluding that this restraint would
be held constitutional."
Abrams is a convenient New
York mouthpiece for The Times to
have around. Of course, Abrams the
dispassionate lawyer and visiting

journalism professor at Columbia is
hardly impartial. He happens to have
also been The Times co-counsel in
the Pentagon Papers case, another
First Amendment case. Somehow
that little addendum to his resume
got left off The Times news item
Wednesday. Regardless, Abrams is
no doubt correct. The courts have
traditionally allowed the media to
wave the First Amendment free
press flag with such vigor and in such
creative postures, that it is hard to see
how the press can ever behave badly
enough to be restrained.
Want to make a movie with your
point of view about the D.C. sniper at
tacks or the Scott Peterson trial and
show it repeatedly on television be
fore, during and after jury selection?
No problem. Want to set up an opin
ion billboard for your radio station
close to the courthouse where a trial is
about to take place and ask call-in lis
teners and potential jurors to vote as
to whether they believe the defendant
is a "man or monster." Sure, that's
okay too. How about publishing the
name of a juror during trial delibera
tions because she is apparently hold

ing out? Well, that might result in the
public getting mad and threatening
the juror, and cause the judge to de
clare a mistrial. What it won't result in
are any sanctions for the offending
newspapers, even though some esti
mates for the cost of the original trial
ran up to 15 million dollars.
The U.S. Supreme Court has
made a nasty habit of paying lip ser
vice to the Sixth Amendment's Con
stitutional guarantee of an impartial
jury. According to Chief Justice War
ren Burger who wrote the Court's
opinion in a 1976 case, the authors of
the Constitution must have been
aware of the potential conflicts be
tween the right to an unbiased jury
and the guarantee of freedom of the
press. He wrote that "they recognized
that there were risks to private rights
from an unfettered press." Quoting
with approval another case. Burger
continued, "the trial courts must take
strong measures to ensure that the
balance is never weighed against the
accused" (from Sheppard v. Maxwell,
384 U. S. 333 (1966)). Then Burger
and his Court cohorts weighed the
balance against the accused in favor

of the press.
Paradoxically, the Court has
weighed against the defendant and
the prosecution in the same trial. In
the Richmond Newspapers case
(1980) both the prosecuting attorney
and the defendant consented to an
order closing public access to a trial.
The order was approved by the trial
judge. Despite recognizing circum
stances under which parts of criminal
trials may be closed to the media,
thereby recognizing that press access
may be limited, the Supreme Court
concluded that the media should not
be limited in the case.
Here's more Supreme Court dou
blespeak. In Press-Enterprise Co. v.
Superior Court #1, the majority
wrote, "No right ranks higher than
the right of the accused to a fair trial."
In the next sentence however, the
opinion states, "But the primacy of
the accused's right is difficult to sepa
rate from the right of everyone in the
community to attend the voir dire
which promotes fairness." In other
words, although the judge, prosecu
tor and defense attorney might agree,
as in the Richmond Newspapers

case, that it will be difficult to get a
fair trial or impartial jury with the
public and the media present, having
the media present insures a fair trial
â€” or as in Press-Enterprise #1, fair
jury selection.
The media don't worry about
whether trials will be fair. They are
merely concerned with access. While
the media generally refrain from
publishing jurors' names during trial
and overwhelmingly criticized the of
fending newspapers after the Tyco
mistrial was declared, they bristle at
the suggestion that maybe they
should be legally restrained from
doing what nearly all of them agree
shouldn't be done.
Judge Richard Owen ordered the
media not to report the names of ju
rors in the Quattrone trial. He is
rightfully concerned that some media
might sketch and publish a picture of
a juror, as The New York Post did in
the Tyco trial, or publish that juror's
name, as the on-line Wall Street
Journal did.
Those types of privacy invasions
will make it increasingly difficult to get
the public to serve as jurors. "The de

sign of the law must be to protect
those persons with whose affairs the
community has no legitimate concern,
from being dragged into an undesir
able and undesired publicity and to
protect all persons whatsoever... It is
the unwarranted invasion of individu
al privacy which is reprehended, and
to be, so far as possible, prevented ...
There are persons who may reason
ably claim as a right, protection from
the notoriety entailed by being made
the victims of journalistic enterprise."
Those words were written over 110
years ago by Louis Brandeis and one
of his colleagues before Brandeis was
elevated to the Supreme Court.
Owen's attempts to protect the
privacy rights of his jurors and ensure
that both the prosecution and defense
can get a fair trial will probably fail.
The media will likely win again. And
once again the real losers will be the
public and the criminal justice system.
