## Julie tries to cross out tan lines, burns head instead 
### 
Although 1 definitely huy the
whole IJV ray/skin cancer
connection, 1 say with only
some shame that I am a tan
ner for life.
Tanning is here to stay. People are in
the sun. they get tan. And if you're
wearing clothes in the sun, you're going
to get tan lines. So until the entire sunny
part of the world is using sunscreen on a
regular basis and non-UV lake-tanning
for their kicks (and I do think things
like small pox vaccines and birth con
trol are higher priorities), then we're
going to have tans, and we're going to
have tan lines. Unless everyone goes
naked, which (sorry, Columbae) I am

sincerely happy will
never happen.
So. tan lines. Pesky
for some, inevitable
for certain athletes,
highly desirable for
still other people.
Pesky for most Cal
ifornians. California
chic is to untie your
bikini top while you're
tanning. Guys, on the

c? j T
other hand, are a lost cause. Board
shorts mean white thighs, for surfers
and pseudo-surfers alike.
Inevitable for others. Farmers, for
example, get farmer's tans.
But you will never see a worse
farmer's tan than you do on cyclists.
Those guys have the whitest upper arms
on the entire planet, plus they have
spiky arms and legs. You know, shaving
their limbs is supposed to make them
more aerodynamic and faster or what
ever, but since guys don't know how to
shave or even braid hair, they wind up
all spiky.
Perhaps equally as famous as the cy
clist's tan, but slightly more acceptable,
is the swimmer's tan. Specifically, the
women's Speedo back tan. It's such a
classic, it's almost acceptable.
But it's not. Really.
Guys don't have this problem when
they swim. They wear Speedos, and if
you're half of the Stanford men's water
polo team, they let their butt cracks hang
out while they're at it. Little Kim tried to
make the butt crack sexy-punky several
seasons ago and it just doesn't work.
If you want to see water polo players
with nice tans, the best view on the en
tire campus is the view from my window.
See, all water sports guys live in KA.and
my room has full view of the KA bas
ketball court. These guys are amphib
ians playing basketball, which is funny,
and they are all very well tanned. With
chlorinated hair. It's very nice. Too bad
I am not a single underclassman.
The same room on the floor above
me has a similar view, but my upstairs
neighbors just have sex all the time, so
the opportunity goes under-appreciated
on the second floor as well.
Not everyone is anti-tan lines. The
first time I stripped down to my Brazil
ian bikini in Ipanema, and untied my
straps to avoid that awful strap tan, my
friends looked at me in bewilderment,
said that tan lines are in, and told me to
buy a smaller thong while 1 was at it.
Imagine a hot Brazilian girl. She's a
beautiful tan brown, with big dangling
earrings and a hot body. The strap tan re
veals her real color, which in many cases
is so drastic that the tan lines can actually
be mistaken fora white tank top.
My second lesson at Ipanema beach,
besides the whole strap-tan fad, in
volved acid burn.
You heard me correctly.
In a daft attempt to highlight my hair
with lime juice, a la California blonde, I
wound up in the emergency room with
the skin on my face bubbling up. Appar
ently mixing citric acid with intense sun
light burns your skin off.
While I was cavorting around Costa
Rica's volcanoes, jungles and beaches
last week with my boyfriend, I saw burn
victims that put my little lime mishap to
shame. I'm talking about a few very
white, freckled Texan tourists who did
not understand the meaning of staying
indoors. The result was catastrophic:
layers of hardened, stretched pink scar
tissue, with sunken, black scabs scat
tered about. It was absolutely horrific.
And they were so nonchalant about it.
Which is worse, the severe burning or
the"I just got back from the tropics and
had some poor woman braid my hair in
rows! It's so authentic!" phenomenon?
At least if Texas had seceded, we
would be rid of part of the problem. For
the rest of us, we're going to tan, burn
and peel, we're going to get tan lines,
and swimmer's back and cyclist's tan
will continue on in hopeless, clueless
perpetuity. But I am not going to lie and
tell you it doesn't look bad.

out while they're at it. Little Kim tried to
make the butt crack sexy-punky several
seasons ago and it just doesn't work.
If you want to see water polo players
with nice tans, the best view on the en
tire campus is the view from my window.
See, all water sports guys live in KA.and
my room has full view of the KA bas
ketball court. These guys are amphib
ians playing basketball, which is funny,
and they are all very well tanned. With
chlorinated hair. It's very nice. Too bad
I am not a single underclassman.
The same room on the floor above
me has a similar view, but my upstairs
neighbors just have sex all the time, so
the opportunity goes under-appreciated
on the second floor as well.
Not everyone is anti-tan lines. The
first time I stripped down to my Brazil
ian bikini in Ipanema, and untied my
straps to avoid that awful strap tan, my
friends looked at me in bewilderment,
said that tan lines are in, and told me to
buy a smaller thong while 1 was at it.
Imagine a hot Brazilian girl. She's a
beautiful tan brown, with big dangling
earrings and a hot body. The strap tan re
veals her real color, which in many cases
is so drastic that the tan lines can actually
be mistaken fora white tank top.
My second lesson at Ipanema beach,
besides the whole strap-tan fad, in
volved acid burn.
You heard me correctly.
In a daft attempt to highlight my hair
with lime juice, a la California blonde, I
wound up in the emergency room with
the skin on my face bubbling up. Appar
ently mixing citric acid with intense sun
light burns your skin off.
While I was cavorting around Costa
Rica's volcanoes, jungles and beaches
last week with my boyfriend, I saw burn
victims that put my little lime mishap to
shame. I'm talking about a few very
white, freckled Texan tourists who did
not understand the meaning of staying
indoors. The result was catastrophic:
layers of hardened, stretched pink scar
tissue, with sunken, black scabs scat
tered about. It was absolutely horrific.
And they were so nonchalant about it.
Which is worse, the severe burning or
the"I just got back from the tropics and
had some poor woman braid my hair in
rows! It's so authentic!" phenomenon?
At least if Texas had seceded, we
would be rid of part of the problem. For
the rest of us, we're going to tan, burn
and peel, we're going to get tan lines,
and swimmer's back and cyclist's tan
will continue on in hopeless, clueless
perpetuity. But I am not going to lie and
tell you it doesn't look bad.

Although 1 definitely huy the
whole IJV ray/skin cancer
connection, 1 say with only
some shame that I am a tan
ner for life.
Tanning is here to stay. People are in
the sun. they get tan. And if you're
wearing clothes in the sun, you're going
to get tan lines. So until the entire sunny
part of the world is using sunscreen on a
regular basis and non-UV lake-tanning
for their kicks (and I do think things
like small pox vaccines and birth con
trol are higher priorities), then we're
going to have tans, and we're going to
have tan lines. Unless everyone goes
naked, which (sorry, Columbae) I am

sincerely happy will
never happen.
So. tan lines. Pesky
for some, inevitable
for certain athletes,
highly desirable for
still other people.
Pesky for most Cal
ifornians. California
chic is to untie your
bikini top while you're
tanning. Guys, on the

c? j T
other hand, are a lost cause. Board
shorts mean white thighs, for surfers
and pseudo-surfers alike.
Inevitable for others. Farmers, for
example, get farmer's tans.
But you will never see a worse
farmer's tan than you do on cyclists.
Those guys have the whitest upper arms
on the entire planet, plus they have
spiky arms and legs. You know, shaving
their limbs is supposed to make them
more aerodynamic and faster or what
ever, but since guys don't know how to
shave or even braid hair, they wind up
all spiky.
Perhaps equally as famous as the cy
clist's tan, but slightly more acceptable,
is the swimmer's tan. Specifically, the
women's Speedo back tan. It's such a
classic, it's almost acceptable.
But it's not. Really.
Guys don't have this problem when
they swim. They wear Speedos, and if
you're half of the Stanford men's water
polo team, they let their butt cracks hang
out while they're at it. Little Kim tried to
make the butt crack sexy-punky several
seasons ago and it just doesn't work.
