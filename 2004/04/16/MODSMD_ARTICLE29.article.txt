# Card closes Pac-10 play in L.A.
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (21-0) heads south to Los Angeles this
weekend to close out the regular season of Pa
cilic-10 Conference play.
With eight ranked singles players and three
ranked doubles teams, Stanford poses a con
siderable threat to No. 6 UCLA (15-6) and No.
7 Southern California (15-5).
With 16consecutive Pac-lOleague titles and
an unblemished 6-0 Pac-10 record this year.
Stanford poses a considerable threat to the
Bruins and the Women of Troy.
And with the closest match in 2004 ending
decisively in the Cardinal's favor, 5-2, Stanford
poses a considerable threat to anyone.
NCAA Championship competition is still a
month away, but it's no surprise to the Pac-10
teams and the rest of the nation that Stanford
has topped the rankings for the last nine weeks.
"It's not hard to look at the rankings and see
that we and Florida are just a little bit better
than everyone else," said Stanford assistant
coach Frankie Brennan.
No. 2 Florida (19-0). like Stanford, is unde
feated in league play this season.
Stanford, of course, is gunning for redemp
tion after a heartbreaking loss to the Gators
last year in the NCAA finals, 4-3.
This weekend stands as one final test for the
Stanford team before they enter the fray that is
NCAA tournament action.
In their previous meetings, the Cardinal
conquered the Trojans, 6-1, and slew the Bru
ins, 7-0.
Playing in the top singles position,
sophomore Amber Liu (13-4) made quick
work of UCLA's No. 16 Jackie Carleton two
weeks ago at Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
6-1,6-3.
Over the last two months, No. 10 Liu has
rocketed toward the top of the ITA charts,
quickly regaining collegiate momentum after
taking time off for the professional circuit in
the fall.
Liu's current record is reminiscent of her
freshman year, when the defending NCAA
Singles Champion went 17-6 in dual match
play. However, her added experience this
year has helped to raise her level of consisten
cy, especially against top-ranked players.
In particular, Liu clinched a break

through victory, 6-1, 6-1 over California's
formidable No. 4 Raquel Kops-Jones in
their showdown last month. Liu's success
snapped a four-match losing skid against the
Golden Bears senior.
No. 13 sophomore Alice Barnes (27-5) has
also been a recent maker of miracles, staging a
three-set comeback against UCLA's No. 52
Daniela Bercek, 0-6, 6-4,6-4.
Barnes regained her composure on the
courts that day, after dropping her first colle
giate dual match to the Trojans' No. 54 Carine
Vermeulen the day before, 6-3,6-3.
Despite boasting three straight
shutouts since the April 3 sweep of UCLA,
Stanford anticipates stiffer challenges
while on the road.
"The home court advantage is always some
thing to consider," senior Lauren Barnikow
said. "But we've gone down there before and
beaten them before. We know that we just
need to make the deal tougher for the home
crowd on their turf."
No. 43 Barnikow (21-0) has done her share
of raising the stakes for opponents, going un
defeated for the entire dual match season.
Barnikow is joined by freshmen Theresa
Logar (20-0) and Anne Yelsey (6-0), sopho
more Joanna Kao (2-0) and junior Story
Tweedie-Yates (5-0), all of whom currently
own spotless dual singles records.
In addition, the Cardinal has excelled in
doubles this year, claiming the doubles point in
every one of its dual matches.
"We've dedicated at least one day a week to
doubles this year," Barnikow said. "Having
practiced more [than] last season, we're now
[more] confident that we're going to get the
doubles [point in matches]."
Losing that doubles point deprived the Car
dinal of an NCAA final victory in 2003.
Barnikow added. "It makes a big difference,
coming onto the courts after playing doubles
and knowing that [the team] only has to win
half of its singles matches."
The top-ranked tandem of Barnikow and
junior Erin Burdette (25-2) heads the dou
bles lineup. No. 48 Barnes and Liu (16-2) and
No. 50 senior Emilia Anderson and Yelsey
(20-2) compete in the second and third posi
tions, respectively.
Match play begins today at 1:30 p.m. at Los
Angeles Tennis Center, resuming on Saturday
at noon at Marks Tennis Stadium.

has topped the rankings for the last nine weeks.
"It's not hard to look at the rankings and see
that we and Florida are just a little bit better
than everyone else," said Stanford assistant
coach Frankie Brennan.
No. 2 Florida (19-0). like Stanford, is unde
feated in league play this season.
Stanford, of course, is gunning for redemp
tion after a heartbreaking loss to the Gators
last year in the NCAA finals, 4-3.
This weekend stands as one final test for the
Stanford team before they enter the fray that is
NCAA tournament action.
In their previous meetings, the Cardinal
conquered the Trojans, 6-1, and slew the Bru
ins, 7-0.
Playing in the top singles position,
sophomore Amber Liu (13-4) made quick
work of UCLA's No. 16 Jackie Carleton two
weeks ago at Taube Family Tennis Stadium,
6-1,6-3.
Over the last two months, No. 10 Liu has
rocketed toward the top of the ITA charts,
quickly regaining collegiate momentum after
taking time off for the professional circuit in
the fall.
Liu's current record is reminiscent of her
freshman year, when the defending NCAA
Singles Champion went 17-6 in dual match
play. However, her added experience this
year has helped to raise her level of consisten
cy, especially against top-ranked players.
In particular, Liu clinched a break

through victory, 6-1, 6-1 over California's
formidable No. 4 Raquel Kops-Jones in
their showdown last month. Liu's success
snapped a four-match losing skid against the
Golden Bears senior.
No. 13 sophomore Alice Barnes (27-5) has
also been a recent maker of miracles, staging a
three-set comeback against UCLA's No. 52
Daniela Bercek, 0-6, 6-4,6-4.
Barnes regained her composure on the
courts that day, after dropping her first colle
giate dual match to the Trojans' No. 54 Carine
Vermeulen the day before, 6-3,6-3.
Despite boasting three straight
shutouts since the April 3 sweep of UCLA,
Stanford anticipates stiffer challenges
while on the road.
"The home court advantage is always some
thing to consider," senior Lauren Barnikow
said. "But we've gone down there before and
beaten them before. We know that we just
need to make the deal tougher for the home
crowd on their turf."
No. 43 Barnikow (21-0) has done her share
of raising the stakes for opponents, going un
defeated for the entire dual match season.
Barnikow is joined by freshmen Theresa
Logar (20-0) and Anne Yelsey (6-0), sopho
more Joanna Kao (2-0) and junior Story
Tweedie-Yates (5-0), all of whom currently
own spotless dual singles records.
In addition, the Cardinal has excelled in
doubles this year, claiming the doubles point in
every one of its dual matches.
"We've dedicated at least one day a week to
doubles this year," Barnikow said. "Having
practiced more [than] last season, we're now
[more] confident that we're going to get the
doubles [point in matches]."
Losing that doubles point deprived the Car
dinal of an NCAA final victory in 2003.
Barnikow added. "It makes a big difference,
coming onto the courts after playing doubles
and knowing that [the team] only has to win
half of its singles matches."
The top-ranked tandem of Barnikow and
junior Erin Burdette (25-2) heads the dou
bles lineup. No. 48 Barnes and Liu (16-2) and
No. 50 senior Emilia Anderson and Yelsey
(20-2) compete in the second and third posi
tions, respectively.
Match play begins today at 1:30 p.m. at Los
Angeles Tennis Center, resuming on Saturday
at noon at Marks Tennis Stadium.

Senior Lauren Barnikow, who is 21 -0 on the season, will play the final con
ference matches of her career this weekend at UCLA and USC. Barnikow is
one of five Stanford women with undefeated dual singles records.
The top-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team (21-0) heads south to Los Angeles this
weekend to close out the regular season of Pa
cilic-10 Conference play.
With eight ranked singles players and three
ranked doubles teams, Stanford poses a con
siderable threat to No. 6 UCLA (15-6) and No.
7 Southern California (15-5).
With 16consecutive Pac-lOleague titles and
an unblemished 6-0 Pac-10 record this year.
Stanford poses a considerable threat to the
Bruins and the Women of Troy.
And with the closest match in 2004 ending
decisively in the Cardinal's favor, 5-2, Stanford
poses a considerable threat to anyone.
NCAA Championship competition is still a
month away, but it's no surprise to the Pac-10
teams and the rest of the nation that Stanford
has topped the rankings for the last nine weeks.
