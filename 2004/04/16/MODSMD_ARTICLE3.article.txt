# Softball faces tough Pac-10 test against 40-1 Arizona
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Softball team
(33-10, 3-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
continues its arduous conference
schedule this weekend as it plays
top-ranked Arizona (40-1, 6-0) and
No. 27 Arizona State (30-18, 0-4) at
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadi
um. The Cardinal will face the
Wildcats tonight before taking on
the Sun Devils in a doubleheader
on Saturday.
Friday's game against the Ari
zona Wildcats will likely be a
matchup between two of the best
collegiate pitchers in the country, as
the Cardinal's Dana "Lightning D"
Sorensen will face off against the
Wildcats' sophomore phenomenon,
Alicia Hollowell.
Hollowell's pitching statistics for
this year are so obscene that deco
rum nearly precludes their appear
ance here. Hollowell sports a per
fect 27-0 win-loss record and a 0.80
ERA while leading the nation in
strikeouts with 345 in just 172 in
nings pitched.
For comparison, the Cardinal's
Dana Sorensen is second in the Pac
-10 in strikeouts with 207 in 165 in
nings. This 138-strikeout gap be
tween Hollowell and Sorensen
would be good enough for fourth in
the Pac-10 in punchouts.
Scarily enough, the Wildcat of
fense is on par with its pitching
staff. The Wildcat juggernaut fea
tures three of the 25 national final
ists for the National Softball Player
of the Year Award: Hollowell,
sophomore left fielder Autumn
Champion and freshman center
fielder Caitlin Lowe are all finalists.
(Stanford has two finalists, Dana
Sorensen and Lauren Lappin.)
Champion and Lowe headline a

Wildcat offense that is one of the
best in the nation. Champion, a first
team Ail-American last year as a
true freshman, leads the Pac-10 with
an unfathomable .500 batting aver
age and is second in the conference
in hits (55) and runs scored (36).
Lowe, a true freshman and the Wild
cats' leadoff hitter, leads the Pac-10
in runs scored (58), hits (57) and
stolen bases (39), and is second to
Champion in batting average (.479).
To put these numbers in perspec

tive, the entire Cardinal team has
only 43 stolen bases, and Lowe's 58
runs scored is just two behind the 60
runs scored by Stanford's top two
run scorers combined.
The Cardinal have already played
Arizona twice this year in non-con
ference tournament play and lost
both games by narrow margins (2-1
and 7-5) at the Wildcat Invitational
in Tucson in February. Stanford
