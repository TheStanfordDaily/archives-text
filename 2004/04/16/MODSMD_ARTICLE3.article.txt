# Softball faces tough Pac-10 test against 40-1 Arizona
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Softball team
(33-10, 3-3 Pacific-10 Conference)
continues its arduous conference
schedule this weekend as it plays
top-ranked Arizona (40-1, 6-0) and
No. 27 Arizona State (30-18, 0-4) at
Boyd and Jill Smith Family Stadi
um. The Cardinal will face the
Wildcats tonight before taking on
the Sun Devils in a doubleheader
on Saturday.
Friday's game against the Ari
zona Wildcats will likely be a
matchup between two of the best
collegiate pitchers in the country, as
the Cardinal's Dana "Lightning D"
Sorensen will face off against the
Wildcats' sophomore phenomenon,
Alicia Hollowell.
Hollowell's pitching statistics for
this year are so obscene that deco
rum nearly precludes their appear
ance here. Hollowell sports a per
fect 27-0 win-loss record and a 0.80
ERA while leading the nation in
strikeouts with 345 in just 172 in
nings pitched.
For comparison, the Cardinal's
Dana Sorensen is second in the Pac
-10 in strikeouts with 207 in 165 in
nings. This 138-strikeout gap be
tween Hollowell and Sorensen
would be good enough for fourth in
the Pac-10 in punchouts.
Scarily enough, the Wildcat of
fense is on par with its pitching
staff. The Wildcat juggernaut fea
tures three of the 25 national final
ists for the National Softball Player
of the Year Award: Hollowell,
sophomore left fielder Autumn
Champion and freshman center
fielder Caitlin Lowe are all finalists.
(Stanford has two finalists, Dana
Sorensen and Lauren Lappin.)
Champion and Lowe headline a

Wildcat offense that is one of the
best in the nation. Champion, a first
team Ail-American last year as a
true freshman, leads the Pac-10 with
an unfathomable .500 batting aver
age and is second in the conference
in hits (55) and runs scored (36).
Lowe, a true freshman and the Wild
cats' leadoff hitter, leads the Pac-10
in runs scored (58), hits (57) and
stolen bases (39), and is second to
Champion in batting average (.479).
To put these numbers in perspec

tive, the entire Cardinal team has
only 43 stolen bases, and Lowe's 58
runs scored is just two behind the 60
runs scored by Stanford's top two
run scorers combined.
The Cardinal have already played
Arizona twice this year in non-con
ference tournament play and lost
both games by narrow margins (2-1
and 7-5) at the Wildcat Invitational
in Tucson in February. Stanford

The Cardinal softball squad will have its hands full at the plate this weekend as
it faces undefeated Wildcats ace Alicia Hollowed.
hopes to build on these previous con
tests and will hope to take Friday's game
when the outcome really counts, now
that the teams are in the midst of confer
ence play.
The Cardinal can't afford to look past
tomorrow's doubleheader against Ari
zona State, though.
The feisty Sun Devils have managed
31 wins already this season and will pre
sent a balanced attack featuring two
time Player of the Year finalist Phelan
Wright, a senior outfielder boasting a
.378 batting average and school records
for career home runs (39) and RBIs
(158).
The Cardinal has not fared well his
torically against the Sun Devils, as Ari
zona State has won 18 of the 27 games

between the two schools in the all-time
series. The Sun Devils also took two of
three games against the Cardinal last
year.
The Cardinal will look to its two
starters, Sorensen and sophomore Laura
Severson, to shut down the Sun Devils
on Saturday, and while Sorensen has
been consistent all season, Severson has
been anything but.
Severson has showed flashes of
brilliance, including a complete-game
shutout of Sacramento State on Tues
day, but has had her share of adversi
ty as well, including being pulled from
the game in the first inning of a 6-0
loss to Cal last Saturday. She will have
to pitch well for the Cardinal to come
out of this weekend with a winning
record in the Pac-10.
The Cardinal offensive attack will be
led by the hitters at the top of its batting
order â€” freshman outfielder Jackie

Rinehart (.393 batting average), sopho
mores Catalina Morris (.303 batting av
erage and a team-leading 31 runs scored)
and Lauren Lappin (.322 batting average
and a team-leading 31 RBI) as well as se
nior catcher Jessica Allister.
Allister is coming off a monster week
in which she was voted Pac-10 Player of
the Week after going 7-for-9 against Cal,
including six consecutive hits.
The Cardinal has the offensive and
defensive tools to defeat the top-ranked
Wildcats on Friday as well as to take
both games against the Sun Devils.
The big question marks going into
the weekend will be whether Stanford
hitters can produce against unbeaten
Hollowell and whether Severson can
pitch like she did on Tuesday against
Sacramento State. If the Cardinal can
address these uncertainties and win out
this weekend, it will be well-situated for
a run at a conference title.
