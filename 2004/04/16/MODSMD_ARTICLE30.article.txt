### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's round two for Stanford and the L. A. schools.
No. 3 Southern California and No. 4
UCLA will travel to the Farm for the second
showdown against Stanford this month. The
last time the No. 11 Stanford men's tennis
team played the two schools, the Cardinal
walked away with two defeats.
Stanford and USC last met at Marks Tennis
Stadium on April 2, when their respective rank
ings were No. 9 and No. 4. The Trojans had the
home court advantage and managed to edge the
Cardinal, 4-3.
"Last time we were close, but some of our
guys were injured," junior Sam Warburg said.
"They've been playing better, though, and
they're healthier, so 1 think, considering we've
won the last three matches pretty decisively, that
we have a pretty good shot at this weekend."
Stanford will look toward its new doubles
lineup to help propel the team over the Trojans
and Bruins. Things were looking dismal after
USC and UCLA swept all doubles matches ear
lier in the month.
"We're definitely looking forward to play
ing [Southern California and UCLA],"
sophomore K.C. Corkery said. "They're ob
viously very tough on their home court. We
get down there and don't really have any time
to practice; the courts are a little different
and the crowds are pretty good for cheering
for them."
It is likely that head coach Dick Gould
will use the same doubles pairings that have
been taking the courts together for the past
three matches.
The No. 34 team of senior Carter Morris and
Warburg is playing together again after switch
ing partners near the beginning of the season.
The duo has replaced the old pairing of Corkery
and Warburg at the No. 1 spot. Morris /War
burg are 2-1 since the changeup, downing two
ranked teams.
"(Morris] is going to be playing in his last
home matches as a senior," Corkery said.
"We've really been thankful that he decided to

come back this year and he's been a big part of
our team, so we're going to try to get out of here
with a couple of wins for him."
Corkery and junior Phil Sheng are now play
ing together at the No. 2 spot and they also have
a 2-1 record. The duo of sophomore James Pade
and freshman James Wan move to playing at the
No. 3 spot.
USC brings a formidable lineup into the mix,
boasting live ranked singles players and one
ranked doubles team. No. 23 Adriano Biasello,
No. 73 Johan Berg, No. 83 Jamil Al-Agba, No.
94 Drew Hoskins and No. 95 Ruben Torres will
all be players to watch.
Last time the two teams met, Biasello and Al-
Agba both drew wins, while Berg, Torres and
Hoskings all suffered defeat at the hands of the
Cardinal players. The No. 12 doubles team of
Hoskins and Daniel Langre has an 11-5 record
for this season.
Stanford will bring three ranked players and
the ranked tandem of Morris / Warburg to the
courts. No. 11 Warburg has been steadily mov
ing up the rankings after starling at a preseason
ranking of No. 71. while All-American Corkery
will enter the matches at No. 110. No. 85 Wan
will look to continue his dual match win streak,
which is now up to 22-0.
"We've had three solid, competitive matches
back to back now and that should set the stage
fora great weekend coming up," Gould said.
"I'm really looking forward to playing these
guys at home."
UCLA will also bring five ranked players
and a ranked doubles team to the courts. No.
6 Tobias Clemens will be one of UCLA's
most important players, followed by No. 52
Alberto Francis, No. 62 Kris Kwinta, No. 82
Chris Lam and No. 106 Philipp Gruendler.
Francis and Kwinta are also the No. 8 dou
bles team together.
The Bruins will be confident coming into Sat
urday's match after defeating Oregon and No.
18 Washington last week.
The Cardinal faces UCLA this afternoon at
1:30 p.m. and goes into battle against the Trojans
at 1 p.m. on Saturday. Both matches will be
played at Taube Family Tennis Stadium.
