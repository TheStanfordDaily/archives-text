## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's golf team has one
last chance to nab a tournament title he
fore vying for the Pacific-10 Conference
crown â€” and the Cardinal has the familiar
greens of the Stanford Golf Course work
ing in its favor.
Stanford will host the U.S. Intercolle
giate tomorrow and Sunday, the squad's
first home tourney since the Nelson Invita
tional in October, at which the Cardinal fin
ished ninth.

The three-round competition will bring
in Pac-10 rivals UCLA, California, Oregon,
Washington State and Oregon State, in ad
dition to non-conference opponents Fresno
State. Long Beach State, UC-Irvine, UC-
Riverside, San Diego, San Diego State,
Santa Clara, San Jose State, San Francisco,
Texas, Portland and Pacific.
Five golfers from each team will compete
and the team score will he the sum of the
four lowest scores.
UCLA earned top honors at the tourna
ment last year, shooting a 12-under-par 840
on the 6,835-yard course. Oklahoma State

and San Diego State rounded out the top
three, while Stanford was 24 strokes off the
victorious Bruins, finishing in seventh place.
Mark Warman of San Diego State posted
the top individual score of the competition
with a seven-under-par 206.
The Cardinal, on the other hand, did not
see any of its golfers meet par. Current ju
nior Kevin Blue came the closest at one
over-par, good enough for 19th place. Se
nior Blake Mastalir and sophomore Kyle
Gentry each mustered a 219 to tie for 37th.
Junior Pat Phillips and sophomore Scott
Mac Donald swung into 46th and 83rd, re

spectively.
Stanford hopes to outdo its performance
at the Oregon Duck Invitational late last
month, where the squad placed a season
high third in the three-round contest. Fresh
man Zach Miller had the highest Cardinal
finish of the tournament, slipping into
fourth behind Warman.
Stanford will look to capitalize on its
home course advantage this weekend, as
the team tackles 36 holes tomorrow, begin
ning at 8 a.m. with a shotgun start. The
final round of 18 will begin Sunday morn
ing at 8 a.m.
