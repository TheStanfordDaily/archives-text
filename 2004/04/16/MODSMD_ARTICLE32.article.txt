# Looming MPSF tourney fuels Bruins / Card rivalry
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The last time they met, it was a
physical back-and-forth struggle
for four periods, resulting in a
one-goal game.
In the meeting previous to
that nail-biter, the teams went
head-to-head in the 2003 NCAA
women's water polo champi
onship final — another one
goal game.
And before that, they ended
the 2003 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation Tournament final in
yet another one-goal game.
No. 2 Stanford (16-3, 8-1
MPSF) and No. 3 UCLA (19-3, 8-
1) have built a rivalry these past
few seasons, as great teams usu
ally do. They can add to that ri
valry as they play in another
monumental game this Sunday in
Los Angeles.
"This game is an all-or-nothing
thing," said freshman driver Katie
Hansen, "It's not the end of our
season but it's a big factor in how
well we do the rest of the way and
if we make it to NCAAs."
The game is important in de
ciding the seedings for the MPSF
tournament coming at the end of
this month.
Stanford and UCLA are cur
rently tied for second place be
hind undefeated Southern Cali
fornia (19-0, 10-0).
With only two games left for
both the Cardinal and the Bruins,
the match plays an important
role in determining the second
and third seeds for the tourna
ment, since USC holds tightly to
the first.
"Obviously this game against
UCLA is for second place seed
in the conference tournament
and so it's a really important
game," said Stanford head coach
John Tanner.

The Cardinal can also look
at the game as a preview of
what is to come, as it appears
likely that the rivalry will con
tinue to grow.
"For MPSF, we're going to be
second or third and probably play
UCLA," Hansen explained.
"We'll probably play them in the
semifinals, so we'll have to beat
them either way."
There's no settling for second
place though, knowing that the
national tournament is just
around the corner.
"Winning MPSF would be
huge for us," said Hansen, who
scored two goals last week. "For
one thing it would guarantee a
spot in NCAAs so we're defi
nitely not going to settle for sec
ond — we're going to try to win.
When the Cardinal and the
Bruins last squared off, Stan
ford escaped with a 6-5 win at
home that did not count toward
conference standings. Last year,
UCLA beat Stanford for the na
tional title, 4-3.
Another close game appears
likely this time around.
The Bruins have been on a
tear, winning 10 consecutive
games, including many against
top-ranked conference oppo
nents. They will also be starting
the reigning MPSF Player of the
Week, freshman goalkeeper
Emily Feher. Feher has compiled
130 saves this season with a 4.85
goals-against average.
"They have been keeping
teams to really low goal outputs
and holding teams to three [or]
four goals a game the last few
weeks," Tanner said. "But they
have struggled to score goals
themselves."
With its high scoring offense,
Stanford's chances look good.
Stanford has outscored oppo
nents 154-84 this season and 33-

11 in the past three games,
thanks to an 18-5 drubbing of Pa
cific (3-21,0-10).
Newcomer Meridith McColl
has been able to hold down oppo
nents' offenses just as well as
UCLA's Feher has. McColl is sec
ond best among goalkeepers with
a 4.40 GAA.
The Cardinal depth and experi
ence is also an advantage to them.
Senior Wendy Watkins leads her
team with 25 goals, followed by
junior Hannah Luber with 23.
"I suspect it will be a pretty
low-scoring game and it will be re
ally close, but I think our experi
ence is something that will serve
us well," Tanner said. "We have a
lot of experienced players and
we've been really good in one
goal games this year."
In fact, the Cardinal has won
all of its one-goal games this year
and is 5-for-5 in two-goal games as
well, proving that when things get
tough, the Cardinal responds.
Tanner will focus on 6-on-5 of
fense, counterattack and will hope
to score on a few 6-on-6 frontcourt
offenses to build a lead.
"A lot of things that were our
weaknesses before and that
teams were using against us,
we've been working on,"
Hansen said "I feel we are real
ly solid in those areas. We're
keeping up and staying consis
tent in [every] area ... so I feel
like we should be fine if we just
play our game."
While the conference rivalry
continues and predictions can be
made as to how heated the match
up will turn out, Stanford can
only wait until Sunday to see what
is in store.
"You never know," Tanner
said. "When the game starts, it
could be 11-10. You have no
way of knowing how it will all
turn out."
