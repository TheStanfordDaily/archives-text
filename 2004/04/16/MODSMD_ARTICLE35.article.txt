# LIGHTNING D
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
It's hard to believe that in 2000, a
righthander wearing the number 12 was step
ping into the circle in Cardinal red for the first
time. A true freshman out of San Diego,
Calif., Dana Sorensen was thrown into her
role on the Stanford softball squad a bit by
chance — injuries on the pitching staff even
tually landed her 211 2/3 innings of playing
time over the course of the year.
Maybe a lesser competitor would have fal
tered under the pressure.
But for four years now. the number 12 has
become synonymous with words like
"power", "strikeout" and "victory" — hence
Sorensen's nickname: "Lightning D."
Now in her fifth year on the Farm and her
fourth on the field, Sorensen has developed
from the highly-touted high school hurler that
Stanford head coach John Rittman said he
was lucky to sign into an ace that will top the
program's record books for years to come.
"We knew we had a blue chip pitcher
[when we signed Sorensen]," Rittman said.
"She's been an integral part of the pitching
staff since the beginning."
Sorensen was throwing lightning bolts
from day one with the Cardinal, and anyone
who thought she couldn't duplicate her
shocking freshman season — which featured
a 22-9 record, 164 strikeouts and a 1.06 ERA
— was silenced by the season that followed.
As a sophomore, Sorensen led the Cardi
nal to its first-ever College World Series ap
pearance that year, starting three of the four
games in Oklahoma City. She demolished
Stanford's single-season strikeouts record —
the old record of 186 was set just two years be
fore Sorensen racked up 295. The righty also
set new records for single-season ERA (0.64)
and victories in a season (27) despite suffering
back injuries that kept her from playing for
three weeks.
Unfortunately for Sorensen, the injury
problems didn't stop after that season. She
suffered an ACL tear in her junior year that
forced her to redshirt the season.
"Everyone makes fun of me because I did
it skateboarding, not on the field." Sorensen
said good-naturedly about her freak run-in
with a longboard.
The injury, which unluckily affected
Sorensen's push-off leg, required two surg
eries and substantial rehabilitation and
caused her to wonder if she could rebound
from the setback.
"I was out for six to eight months and that
really makes you question, 'Are you going to
be the same pitcher?'" Sorensen said. "I
couldn't even walk for four weeks. [Coming
back] took a lot of patience and time."
Sorensen's determination paid off in the
end and 2003 was an even more pleasant sur

prise than 2001 had been for Stanford fans.
The single-season strikeout record than she
had set her sophomore year toppled once
again as she slapped 332 strikeouts into the
record hooks.
"She's just inspiring," said senior Jessica
Allister, who has been catching Sorensen for
four years. "She's out there every day work
ing hard."
By the end of last season, Sorensen had
rocketed into Stanford's number one spot for
career ERA (0.93), career victories (71) and
career strikeouts (7%, a good distance from
former Cardinal Becky Blevins' 595 mark.)
This season, Sorensen has put her five
pitches to work in 164 innings. 68 innings
more than any other pitcher on the Cardinal
staff. She attributes her current 19-5 record in
part to the experience that she and Allister
have as a pitcher-catcher duo.
"We know each other so well — there are
no surprises," Sorensen said. "She knows the
way I pitch and helps me set up batters, and
it's really a comfort."
Allister added that setting up batters when
Sorensen is pitching is a simple task for her:
"She has the upper-hand. [Batters] know
what to expect from her, they've seen the
scouting reports, but she can still overpower
them."
With her I,oooth career strikeout and 18
complete games already on the scorebooks
this season, Sorensen is focused on getting
the Stanford squad back to the College
World Series.
"[Sorensen | is one of the most competitive
people I know," Allister said. "There's noth
ing she wants to do more than win. and that
projects onto the team."
The kind of leadership that Sorensen has
provided will be missed next season, when the
ASA Player of the Year candidate is at the
University of North Carolina pursuing a grad
uate degree in sports administration.
"I'm going to climb the ranks of collegiate
sports on the administration side of things,"
Sorensen said.
Of course, Stanford won't be the last place
that she steps into a pitcher's circle. Sorensen
and Allister have both been drafted to the
New England Riptide, one of the six teams
gearing up for the inaugural three-month sea
son of the National Pro Fastpitch league.
Other pro Softball leagues have formed and
folded over the years, but hopes for the NPF
are high, as it is affiliated with Major League
Baseball.
As these new prospects draw nearer,
Sorensen hopes that the four years that her
number 12 graced the circle at Stanford will
remind her teammates that the game's value
will always be in the sheer joy of competing.
"This is the game, play it for what it's
worth," she said. "It's been so fun to be here
for five years, on the field or not."

Sorensen's determination paid off in the
end and 2003 was an even more pleasant sur

prise than 2001 had been for Stanford fans.
The single-season strikeout record than she
had set her sophomore year toppled once
again as she slapped 332 strikeouts into the
record hooks.
"She's just inspiring," said senior Jessica
Allister, who has been catching Sorensen for
four years. "She's out there every day work
ing hard."
By the end of last season, Sorensen had
rocketed into Stanford's number one spot for
career ERA (0.93), career victories (71) and
career strikeouts (7%, a good distance from
former Cardinal Becky Blevins' 595 mark.)
This season, Sorensen has put her five
pitches to work in 164 innings. 68 innings
more than any other pitcher on the Cardinal
staff. She attributes her current 19-5 record in
part to the experience that she and Allister
have as a pitcher-catcher duo.
"We know each other so well — there are
no surprises," Sorensen said. "She knows the
way I pitch and helps me set up batters, and
it's really a comfort."
Allister added that setting up batters when
Sorensen is pitching is a simple task for her:
"She has the upper-hand. [Batters] know
what to expect from her, they've seen the
scouting reports, but she can still overpower
them."
With her I,oooth career strikeout and 18
complete games already on the scorebooks
this season, Sorensen is focused on getting
the Stanford squad back to the College
World Series.
"[Sorensen | is one of the most competitive
people I know," Allister said. "There's noth
ing she wants to do more than win. and that
projects onto the team."
The kind of leadership that Sorensen has
provided will be missed next season, when the
ASA Player of the Year candidate is at the
University of North Carolina pursuing a grad
uate degree in sports administration.
"I'm going to climb the ranks of collegiate
sports on the administration side of things,"
Sorensen said.
Of course, Stanford won't be the last place
that she steps into a pitcher's circle. Sorensen
and Allister have both been drafted to the
New England Riptide, one of the six teams
gearing up for the inaugural three-month sea
son of the National Pro Fastpitch league.
Other pro Softball leagues have formed and
folded over the years, but hopes for the NPF
are high, as it is affiliated with Major League
Baseball.
As these new prospects draw nearer,
Sorensen hopes that the four years that her
number 12 graced the circle at Stanford will
remind her teammates that the game's value
will always be in the sheer joy of competing.
"This is the game, play it for what it's
worth," she said. "It's been so fun to be here
for five years, on the field or not."

Redshirt senior Dana Sorensen began tfie season already at the top of most pitching categories in the Stanford softball record books. The San
Diego, Calif, native has posted 19 wins and 207 strikeouts so far tnis season.
It's hard to believe that in 2000, a
righthander wearing the number 12 was step
ping into the circle in Cardinal red for the first
time. A true freshman out of San Diego,
Calif., Dana Sorensen was thrown into her
role on the Stanford softball squad a bit by
chance — injuries on the pitching staff even
tually landed her 211 2/3 innings of playing
time over the course of the year.
Maybe a lesser competitor would have fal
tered under the pressure.
But for four years now. the number 12 has
become synonymous with words like
"power", "strikeout" and "victory" — hence
Sorensen's nickname: "Lightning D."
Now in her fifth year on the Farm and her
fourth on the field, Sorensen has developed
from the highly-touted high school hurler that
Stanford head coach John Rittman said he
was lucky to sign into an ace that will top the
program's record books for years to come.
"We knew we had a blue chip pitcher
[when we signed Sorensen]," Rittman said.
"She's been an integral part of the pitching
staff since the beginning."
Sorensen was throwing lightning bolts
from day one with the Cardinal, and anyone
who thought she couldn't duplicate her
shocking freshman season — which featured
a 22-9 record, 164 strikeouts and a 1.06 ERA
— was silenced by the season that followed.
As a sophomore, Sorensen led the Cardi
nal to its first-ever College World Series ap
pearance that year, starting three of the four
games in Oklahoma City. She demolished
Stanford's single-season strikeouts record —
the old record of 186 was set just two years be
fore Sorensen racked up 295. The righty also
set new records for single-season ERA (0.64)
and victories in a season (27) despite suffering
back injuries that kept her from playing for
three weeks.
Unfortunately for Sorensen, the injury
problems didn't stop after that season. She
suffered an ACL tear in her junior year that
forced her to redshirt the season.
"Everyone makes fun of me because I did
it skateboarding, not on the field." Sorensen
said good-naturedly about her freak run-in
with a longboard.
The injury, which unluckily affected
Sorensen's push-off leg, required two surg
eries and substantial rehabilitation and
caused her to wonder if she could rebound
from the setback.
"I was out for six to eight months and that
really makes you question, 'Are you going to
be the same pitcher?'" Sorensen said. "I
couldn't even walk for four weeks. [Coming
back] took a lot of patience and time."
Sorensen's determination paid off in the
end and 2003 was an even more pleasant sur

prise than 2001 had been for Stanford fans.
