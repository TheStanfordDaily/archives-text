Yo, Roxy!
I'm not sure you're really looking for answers or just
filling space, but for what it's worth, here's one guy's take
on it: Sex is boring. Yeah, you heard me.
It's everywhere in your face. On TV. radio, in maga
zines, movies, and yes, even campus blogs. Porn is main
stream. Ron Jeremy sells penis pills on not-so-late night
TV and you've got umpteen billion advice columns.
Look, it's not even funny anymore. Too many stupid
people take it way too seriously and way too far. Like your
friend in the library. I mean, where'd she get THAT idea?
March letters to Penthouse? I'm a guy, presumably serious
about completing my education, and I'm supposed to let
some chick I've already broken up with jump me in the li
brary where we might get caught? Why? Why on earth
would 1 do that when I can have a delightful evening at
home with my new girlfriend who's NOT (presumably)
screwing her ex, or whoever else is at hand when her
panties get wet? My take? The guy finally wised up.
"I always thought that girls were supposed to get sex
whenever we wanted it."
Now that just says it all. Maybe the pretty ones can if
they're not too fussy, but most women I know have the
same problem as guys in that department. I roomed with a
girl for close to a year, good looks, great personality, but
she just could not get laid. One night she gets all drunk and

comes on to me. I was floored. Out of nowhere she plants
a sloppy wet kiss on me and I recoiled. Nothing personal,
it was just so unexpected. Well, that was it. She moved out.
Couldn't take the embarrassment I guess. Hell, if I'd
known it was that bad I'd have helped her deal with it, pro
viding we had some ground rules. She never spoke up
though. Fear of rejection I suppose, but hey... what guy
can't sympathize with that particular problem?
Frankly, by hyping the trashy side of everything sexual
in the name of selling product, mass media have actually
done some of us guys a favor. There are a lot of women out
there who are seriously turned off by this shit. Imagine
their delight when they find a guy that doesn't want to
watch Vivid while doing her up the ass, or isn't angling for
a three-way with her girlfriend. Someone who buys her
flowers, picks up the check, remembers her birthday, does
stuff SHE likes without grumbling.
Come on Roxy. Mardi Gras? I mean, what's next? A
cameo appearance on "Girls Gone Wild?" Have a little
self-respect. Play hard to get once in a while. Some of us
still like that, you know.
For what it's worth ...
