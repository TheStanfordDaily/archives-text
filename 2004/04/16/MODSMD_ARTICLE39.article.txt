## Uma's out to 'Kill Bill' 
### JOSH SMITH INTERMISSION FILM CRITIC 
For the college crowd, waiting in acute
anticipation fora sequel has become anal
ogous to an eight-year-old thirsting fora
quickly approaching Christmas morning;
although he's excited to play with his new
toys, the real fun is the ridding of the mys
tery that's been vexing him for weeks:
what the hell is under all that ugly wrap
ping paper?
Older, but really no different, we
now dutifully attend sequels not so
much to witness cinema at its finest, but
rather to oblige us to no longer concern
ourselves with how Anakin became
Darth Vader. Why else would anyone
see such crap?
Fortunately Quentin Tarantino's
epic crossbreeding of campy kung-fu
flicks and spaghetti westerns breaks the
mold set by such dribble as "The Matrix
Revolutions." "Kill Bill Vol. 2" not only
clarifies mysteries the first installment
left us, but also is more comical and
more effectively paced than "Vol. 1"
while losing none of its predecessor's
scatterbrained zaniness.
Whereas the lowbrow first half sacri
fices plot and dialogue for some ridicu
lously badass violence and overblown
back-stories for the members of the
Deadly Viper Assassination Squad,
"Vol. 2" tones down the gore and em
phasizes characters.
After a noir-ish prologue wherein The
Bride (a.k.a. Black Mamba, a.k.a Beatrix
Kiddo — her "real" name, a.k.a. Uma
Thurman) tells the audience about the
murderous spree she's about to continue,
the flick begins in earnest. "Vol. 2" starts
not where the first left off, but rather
where the first commenced (this is Taran
tino remember), in a wedding chapel
bracing fora massacre. This time
through, however, the audience is treated
to a dialogue between The Bride and Bill
(David Carradine).
While Bill was basically relegated to
the role of disembodied voice the last
time around, he has plenty of screen time
here. Carradine's calm, fatigued de
meanor gives this film the legitimate hu
manizing element that was lacking in the
first. Flashing forward. The Bride /
Black Mamba / Beatrix Kiddo resumes
seeking her revenge on the surviving
DivAS, namely Bill's trailer trash kid
brother, Budd (Michael Madsen) and
the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Han
nah, more fun here than in anything
since Splash). However, Budd quickly
gets the jump on Our Hero and tries to
do away with her in a horrifying manner
befitting Edgar Allan Poe.
Not that this deters The Bride, she
again emerges from the viselike-grip of

death with her murderous intent strength
ened even further.
Following a truly awesome catfight be
tween The Bride and Elle in the narrow
confines of Budd's trailer. The Bride be
gins to track down Bill and bring a proper
conclusion to her saga of revenge. Upon
finding Bill, The Bride also crosses paths
with a long-lost daughter. With all of the
mysteries finally revealed, will The Bride
complete her obsessive mission and Kill
Bill? (Sorry 1 had to do that.)
Kill Bill is a story of revenge on a grand
scale, told in the only manner Tarantino
knows how, ripping off any and all eso
teric genre of film. Stylistically, Kill Bill is
an amalgamation of stories of revenge
from both the Asian and American tradi
tions, and both forbearers are treated al
ternately with a sense of approbation and
one of mockery.
The best example of this is the film
stealing sequence depicting The Bride
learning martial arts in grueling sessions
from her master Pei Mai (Chinese kung-fu

hero Gordon Liu).
In addition to
knowing the "five
point exploding heart
technique," the an
cient master is in pos
session of probably
the most ridiculous fa
cial hair-eyebrows
combo ever to be seen

Kill Kill Vol. II —JB<<.

on screen. The manner in which he
swishes his beard aside with his hand in
disapproval (and the accompanying
sound effect) just screams Chinese B
movie even as Tarantino is paying such
movies tremendous respect by casting
Liu in the first place.
Kill Bill is clearly derivative of American
cinematic classics as well, with ideas taken
from such übiquitous films like "A Fistful of
Dollars" and the other spaghetti westerns
of director Sergio Leone. The casting of
Carradine as Bill is also telling. In having
played Caine, the star of 70s Apvision
show "Kung Fu." Carradine is §Piself an
Americanized version of Asian giftres.
Although being a melting pot |pf styles
is part of the appeal of "Kill Bill Vol. 2"
(especially for its director), it'lßo con
tributes to the film's weaker elements. For
instance, when The Bride seeks q>ut Bill by
visiting a Mexican brothel, it seems more
like some kind of movie-junkie inside joke
than plot advancement.
Yet overall, Quentin Tarantino does
in Kill Bill what Beck did in Odclayiiturn
a whole heap of B-level pop-culture trash
into something really, well, artistic.
Tarantino successfully embeds all of his
off-the-cusp genre hopping into a film
with an invigorating story line and fun ac
tion sequences. Not to mention it's just
damn cool four out of five.


Hey! I'm talkin* to you, you son of a bitch! That's right — you!
