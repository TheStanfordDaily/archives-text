# It's E & A Day...and Everyone Is Celebrating

### ANDREW NIELSEN A.K.A. MC LARS, LITERATE RAPPER EXTRAORDINAIRE 
When we look back, it's hard to imagine
that 35 years ago this August, Jamaican l).l
Kool Here first moved to New York city with
a crate full of records and invented the break
beat. This would lay the groundwork for hip
hop as we know it, and more than a third of a
century later, hip-hop is everywhere —al-
though the dance-friendly pop-rap that dom
inates MTV and Fuse is often safe and un
challenging in its aesthetic. This is not to den
igrate the production technical prowess of
the likes of Twista and Chingy, but in sub
scribing to this formula, it's enough to give
hip-hop a bad. um ... "rap," which leads us

to a very important question:
Is the challenging ingenuity
that was brought to hip-hop
in the 1980s by such luminar
ies as KRS-One and Run-
DMC dead? No.
The prime challenge, how
ever, is that hip-hop is a genre
that started with the simplest
of tools: two turn tables and a
microphone. Based on this, it
is conceivably difficult to real
ly be cutting edge as you're
cutting wax and spitting

rhymes. When the mainstream appreciation
of hip-hop fails to lend itself to a perspective
that encourages experiment alism in the genre,
this is a problem. But, every so often, some
thing bubbles up from the underground,
changing hip-hop with a new sound or per
spective. It happened with Public Enemy com
ing onto the scene in 1987 with a new sonic ag
gressiveness and political consciousness.
Then, with the old school intelligence of De La
Soul in 1989 and Jurassic Five in 1993, as a nec
essary antithesis to the West C oast gangsta rap
ol the era. It's 2004, and the newest group to
Hip the hip-hop paradigm is not from the East
Coast or the West Coast. They're from St.
Paul, and they just gave a stamp of credibility
to a new flava of hip-hop, "emo rap".
Meet Eyedea and Abilities. Eyedea is a
22-year old Minnesota native, who boasts in

the song "Kept," "I'm a B

Boy

/ that's the best way

to describe me / Born in eighty-one,
been rhyming since the early nineties."
Abilties, the group's DJ, cuts with the
precision of Grandmaster Flash and
occasionally the tweaked out funk of

Alrika Bambataa. throwing in samples from
Kevin Smith movies and random vocal sam
ples from Andre 3(X)l) of Outkast. Together
the duo has won many battles with their col
laborative live show, including Scribble Jam,
the HBO Rap Olympics, as well as regional
DMC Championships. They've proven them
selves from the ground up as relevant com
petitors in the hip-hop game, with skills that
we can not denigrate.

Emo rap is essential hip
hop music with "punk rock"
lyrics. Cashing in on this new
"crossover," the punk rock
label Epitaph, home to punk
gurus Bad Religion and Fenny
wise, recently purchased mid-
West hip-hop label Rhymesay
ers Entertainment. The Sep
tember release of Atmos
phere's "Seven's Travels" re
ceived much respect in both
punk rock and underground
hip-hop communities. Atmos

phere's proteges of Atmosphere, Eyedea &
Abiltics dropped their first album through
Rhymcsayers in 2001. "E&A" is the group's
second LP, recorded in St. Paul, Minnesota.
The fact that this is the first truly credible
hip-hop album on a punk label sets the stakes
higher for emo rap, and has brought some
long deserved credibility to those mocking
the crossover.
And, holy crap, this album is great." Rein
troducing" is funky introduction that high
lights Eyedea s raw vocals and D.I Abilities'
production prowess. Eyedea raps, and Abili
ties scratches Eyedea's voice on the breaks as
the lines finish. It is rare that aDJ will actual
ly scratch a sample that is the MC of the
group's voice, often relying on vintage or
movie samples, but Abilities is not
fied with that, opting to take
live sound to a higher^^^^^

level. One of the
standout mo- ~
mcnts from this track
is the interplay between

the duo, when Eyedea asks
"What? You thought our second
record wouldn't be live?" wherein
Abilities drops an intricate bar of jazz
bass and scratching, and Eyedea fin
ishes the line with "Surprise!" It's
funny and adroit; indicative of the
group's technical prowess.
"Now" is the single from the
album, where Eyedea exhibits
ridiculous breath control. He crams
16 syllables into two bars — some
thing even the last MCs have trouble doing.
He goes from double time to half time in a
second, and shows that the use of a di
aphragm in rapping can not be ignored.
"Man Vs. Ape" starts out with a gritty synth
line: the song addresses the issue of the evo
lution of mankind and Christianity, and
questions both. Eyedea raps sarcastically,
" 1 hold picket signs outside of abortion clin
ic doors/Take what 1 want with force ...
and my God could kill yours." We won't
hear Murphy Lee rapping those words any
time soon.
"Glass" is a song of existentialist de
spair that closes the album. Eyedea says,
"One day it's all going to shatter, and 1
hope you're right here." It's an interesting
finale to an album that shows that hip-hop
is still growing and evolving, regardless of
the mainstream perception and portrayal
of it. The line hints that the sub-culture
could creatively be on its way out, if it
doesn't continue to challenge. We can re
joice. however, because Eyedea and Abil
ties innovators who are going to do their
• best they can to make sure this doesn't
to hip-hop.
A On the fringes, it's still very much alive.
Eycdea and Abilities, relaxin' all cool and just
shootin' some b-ball outside of the school.

CONSERVATIONIST
Blonde Redhead
She paused,
her left hand press
ing the receiver to her ear, her
heartbeat moving the telephone cord
dangling across her chest. "Elephant
Woman," the opening track on Blonde
Redhead's newest album "Misery is a
Butterfly," swelled in the background.
Her right hand braced against the glass
of the phone booth as Jacques, the
Switzerland operative, hurriedly in
formed her that all was lost. They had
been found out and she would have to
flee for her life to Italy.
Her eyes glassed over in the win
ter moonlight. The strings trilled and
Kazu Makino's voice grew more and
more urgent, becoming lost in a wash
of reverb and upper-register vocal
stretches. The defeated double
agent drew all the breath she could
muster and brought her head up to
gaze at the Eiffel Tower, swirling in
the Parisian blizzard. As "Ele
phant Woman" reached its tortured
climax, she whispered two words
into the telephone, her last to her
doomed lover 580 kilometers away,
and hung up.
Fast forward: four years later, the
double-agent has given up the life of a
spy and has taken a quiet residence in
Rio. Her life is simple, the view from her
tiny flat of the seabound ships giving just
enough reminder of what she left across
the Atlantic. And as she slowly fades
away, the forgotten weapon of a treach
erous state, "Misery is a Butterfly," still
carries her along.
"Misery" is Blonde Redhead's
first album since 2000's "Melody of
Certain Damaged Lemons," and the
four-year absence has brought a new
sound as well as a new record label,
4AD. Whereas "Lemons" and 1998's
"In an Expression of the Inexpress
ible" flaunted the band's rough,
Sonic Youth-influenced no-wave
pop, "Misery" has plumbed for
something darker yet paradoxically
more polished.
On "Messenger," the second track,
vocalist Amadeo Pace moans his signa
ture moan over a song built not upon
dissonance or aggression, but upon
dreamy, anxious pop reminiscent of
4AD alums Pale Saints, Throwing
Muses or Love and Rockets at their
most brooding. The album's arrange
ments are more elaborate and ethereal,
with strings inhabiting many tracks, but
the songs lack focus and "Misery" strug
gles to find its identity.
The actual sound of the album suffers
less than mood. "Misery" shows Blonde
Redhead at their most intricate and del
icate sound yet. but it spends most of its
time in the same dysphoria at the ex
pense of the variation of "Lemons" or
the chaotic dissonance of "Expression."
The songs arc pretty, but the over
wrought, misguided tension of the
album dulls Blonde Redhead's rough
edges so much,
"Misery" comes
off sounding
like the
soundtrack lo
some heavy-hand
ed, melodramatic spy
movie. And so ...
J 'tff
AS
They have hired her again
and she waits at the docks for her con
tact. With the ocean breeze, her spy
instincts begin their tentative reawak
ening, goose bumps rising all over her
skin. When he finally appears behind
her, she knows before she sees him.
Before she can turn to embrace
Jacques, he puts his gloved hand on
her shoulder, draws her near, and
whispers those same two words into
her car. Jacques releases her and
walks away into the fog, and as the
psychedelia of "Misery'"s "Pink
Love" swells into its aching chorus,
she sighs the words to herself: indie
rock,indie rock.
The Hiss
By WILL OREMUS
INTERMISSION WRITER
Four reasons why the garage-rock revival is not cool any
more: Jet. The Vines. The Hives. The Von Bondics. These
guys' careers were made for Gap Jeans ads. Gap Jeans ads
never feature the same band twice. A plea to these four
groups: Break up immediately, for everyone's sake, break up
in a fit of violence and claim "artistic differences" as though
there were a difference between total artlessness and pure
commcrcialistic crap. Better to be a one-hit wonder than to
be Candlebox.
The Black Keys? The Mando Diao? The Dirtbombs? All
just quirky enough to avoid the Next Big Thing curse and
preclude mainstream success. Ever. No footnotes in the his
tory books for these guys, just a buncha loyal fans, a few years
full of transcendent, stage-stomping, beer-spewing gigs, and
a lot of good times to look back on when they're old and re
ally weird.
The Strokes? The White Stripes? You've made it. Just
don't get too comfortable. The only thing worse than a
wanna-bc is a has-been.
Now comes this band called The Hiss. They do garage
rock revival. There are four of them, and they come from At
lanta. With dreadful timing, they have just released a new
garage-rock album called "Panic Movement," which I'll
come back to in a second.
Hirst, we need to pigeonhole these dudes. What, I'm sup
posed to make up a whole new category just fora band that
sings/screams crap like "I know I can make you love me /
Down by the riverbed" over the obligatory throbbing guitars
and pounding drums? Well, I won't do it.
I hey seem like prime candidates for inclusion in the Jet /
Vines category. Like Jet, they crib shamelessly from the leg
ends. "Riverbed" is a Zeppelin song with a few modern in
novations, like reverb guitars and vocals that don't sound like
they're being sung by a acid-addled
androgyne. "Listen to Me" and
Step Aside" arc Oasis without the
soaring choral climax.
And, like The Vines, The Hiss
occasionally veer embarrassingly
close to the sound of some of the
whackest bands working. "Hard
Io Lose" would be indistinguish
able from Everclear if only the
singer were bitching about his dad
leaving him 40 years ago. Instead,
, , j" > J O '
he s delivering nonsense like 'it's hard to lose / When
you're not winning."
But, unlike either Jet or the Vines, The Hiss at least seem
sincere. You almost feel sorry for them when you think about
the fact that they probably didn't have cynical critics in mind
when they wrote some of their most hackneyed and ridicule
ready lyrics. But then, you realize that a) this lack of pretense
is cxactly what re
deems the band; and b) their ability
to rock the panties off the girls at their shows kind
of obviates their need to impress cynieal critics.
How do 1 know they're sincere?
Well, it's either that, or they're mo
rons. 11" they were a commercial <
construct calculated to capi
tali/.e on the new big trend, T II
there's no way they would have
released this kind of album in the
1 4/ oS
V X
spring of 2004. The timing couldn't be
worse. Being a garage-rock band was avant
garde four years ago, cool three years ago, trendy
two years ago and annoying last year. By this time it's like
being Ace of Base.
Clearly, The Hiss don't give a shit. And that in itself puts
them in a different category than fashion-plate poseurs like
The Hives.
But do they have the substance, the originality and the ap
peal to transcend their limited (and doomed) genre like the
Strokes or the Stripes? Not judging from this LP. Worship
them or hate them, those bands have a sound and personali
ty that are distinct, instantly recognizable and universally ac
cessible. The Hiss's sound and personality, at this point, arc
purely derivative of their rock'n'roll forefathers.
So does that leave The Hiss in the company of bands like
the Black Keys, destined to impress Pitchfork and rock hot
shows but never win mainstream success?
No. There's another option: oblivion. The band could end
up being completely ignored. (In the U.S., that is —in
Britain, they're apparently the heroes of the moment thanks
to the disgusting hype machine that is NME.) That's proba
bly what will happen if the band doesn't develop a more
unique and compelling identity on its next album.
But until then, "Panic Movement" is actually worth lis-
tcning to, and any live shows The Hiss
play are not to be missed. Because at
their best, they rock HARD. Think
"Take the Long Road and Walk It" by
The Music. Never heard of it? Damn.
Urn, try Oasis crossed with Social Dis
tortion. Can't imagine it? Then get
some imagination, fool.
"Triumph" and "Riverbed" are
two of the best rock riffs of the year, and
should be played at top volume — with
the windows UP. Because, as I said,
garage-rock is at that awful spot between mainstream and
indie culture where, if you listen to it conspicuously, it looks
like you're trying to be cool but failing miserably. Like the kid
in Offspring's "fretty Fly fora White Guy" who wanted Ice
Cube but bought Vanilla Ice.
Or like me, who just revealed that I used to listen to the
Offspring. Ahh, whatever. I like The Hiss, too.
Ode to tight jeans and long hair.
David Bowie

If you have to ask, you'll
lever get it. It's beyond you. It's
high art. Besides, it's David Fuck
ing Bowie.
You know, I can't do this any
more. I've spent a long time holding
Bowie up as an icon in the canon of
rock & roll. Ziggy Stardust in all of his
gender-bending excess laid waste in
advance to all future imitators. He
preempted glam rock because he kept
himself on the painfully sharp cutting
edge of it all — always changing. Like
the Beatles or Radiohcad. Every
album was a shock.
But Bowie hasn't shocked me in a
long time. I don't need the red mullet
or the androgyny or rumors of doing
the more-than-friends with Mick Jag
ger. No, I think that Bowie has been
great since then — I don't see his days
on Mars as a frozen prime, never to be
touched again. 1997's "I'm Afraid of
Americans" was provocative in that
good way. I'd even give "Little Won
der" off of 2002's "Heathen" a nod if 1
really had to. But the fact of the mat
ter is, I don't think Bowie has been
making progress for about three al
bums now.
Is he ahead of his time? Perhaps.
But in that inaccurate way that film
makers in the '50s thought that we'd all
be driving flying cars by now. His music
as it stands on "Hours" is from a future
that I don't think is going to happen.
I'm hoping it's not going to happen.
People say that Jimi Hendrix would
have thrived like a ilower in the sun
amongst all the audio technology avail
able today. Well, maybe — but he has
the advantage of being dead and safely
out removed from the debate. Bowie,
however, is still churning out albums,
and, perhaps not unlike the hypotheti
cal Hendrix, is just God-awfully
drowning in the guitar synths, samples,
compressors and Pro Tooled muck of
the 21st century studio.
Ziggy channeled a future that 1
wanted to be a part of. It was cosmic
but accessible. He told stories.
Bowie, today, takes us to the dark, al
ternate, but parallel decade where
Uncle Biff kingpins a gambling em
pire, Marty's existence is uncertain,
and Mrs. McFly has implants. Slight
ly appealing, but inferior to the orig
inal, nonetheless.
And I feel like it comes from a
lack of effort. Lyrics aren't every
thing, but when I hear Bowie singing
in that honeyed vibrato about
"still[ing] his trembling heart," I
think sure, it could work if he was
selling it better, but why do I need to
put in the effort to rationalize the
poor quality when it seems that he's
not willing to put in the effort to
make quality lyrical content?
Bowie used to do it right. I doru't
know what's going on now because
"Hours" is covered in a thick goo of
impossibly wet mixing, often rendering
the counterintuitive changes and odd
lyrics indecipherable. Per
haps that was a self-preservation
mechanism on Bowie's part. Regard
less, we arc still left with songs like
"Seven" that sound like open mic at a
Goth bar. On Tatooine. With C3PO
on lead vocals.
That's the thing: The songwriting
on "Hours" is unbelievably sub-parlor
someone the likes of David Fucking
Bowie. Maybe he knew this and tried
to fill in the gaps with spaccy, canned
robo-guitar and sludgy vocal effects a
la phone stalker from the first
"Scream." The prominence of his ex
tragalactic guitarist — apparently
cryo-catalogued in the '80s and fed
nothing but Orgy and Zakk Wylde
until thawed out for Bowie's latest
album — and layer upon layer of digi
tal mud might suggest an effort at cov
ering up flimsy musical craftsmanship.
I'd like not to believe that, but it's
tough to listen to the hokey chord
changes and lazy arrangement on
"Survive" without conjuring images of
a Valium-addled Brian May, bending
over a drum machine in a Martian stu
dio that's 40 degrees hotter than it
should be.
It's the sort of music that would
go great with four minutes and 11
seconds of lackadaisical sex after a
10 a.m. polisci lecture. Shame on the
synthesizer. Check that: Shame on
Bowie for using a synthesizer in lieu
of a bona fide, wood 'n' catgut string
section. I am baffled as to why film
scorers and rock artists alike insist
on committing this, the cardinal sin
of orchestral integrity. Perhaps this
is the son-ol'-L.A. studio musicians
part of me talking, but why why
WHY would Bowie take his future
vibe so far as to actually go through
with putting 16-bit Nintendo-esque
digi-strings on any of his non
tongue-in-cheek cuts, let alone a
would-be "American Beauty"
soundtrack like "Brilliant Adven
ture." God, 1 felt like I was watching
a late night Cinemax version of
Cirque du Soleil.
Believe me, this isn't easy for me.
David Bowie is one of my heroes —
the man is 99 percent watertight for
me, but it's that 1 percent that keeps
nagging at me when I listen to
"Hours." If Bowie keeps on like he
has for the past three albums, he's
going to start losing devotees like my
self, and he has neither the crossover
nor family appeal of fellow aging
rocker, Peter Gabriel, to at least his
financial butt. I can't see Bowie scor
ing Disney's next animated journey
into palatable ethnic folklore. He just
doesn't fit in anywhere else besides
right there on the razor-blade fine
line between canonical brilliance and
lazy excess.
Sock it to me, David —where's
that genius? I know you've got it.
Check under the digital effects rack
— maybe you left it there.
David Bowie as the Goblin King in "Labyrinth,"
where he falls in love with a young Jennifer Con
nelly. Seriously.
