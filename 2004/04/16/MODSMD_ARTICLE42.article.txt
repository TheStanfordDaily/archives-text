She paused,

her left hand press

ing the receiver to her ear, her

heartbeat moving the telephone cord
dangling across her chest. "Elephant
Woman," the opening track on Blonde
Redhead's newest album "Misery is a
Butterfly," swelled in the background.
Her right hand braced against the glass
of the phone booth as Jacques, the
Switzerland operative, hurriedly in
formed her that all was lost. They had
been found out and she would have to
flee for her life to Italy.
Her eyes glassed over in the win
ter moonlight. The strings trilled and
Kazu Makino's voice grew more and
more urgent, becoming lost in a wash
of reverb and upper-register vocal
stretches. The defeated double
agent drew all the breath she could
muster and brought her head up to
gaze at the Eiffel Tower, swirling in

the Parisian blizzard. As "Ele
phant Woman" reached its tortured
climax, she whispered two words
into the telephone, her last to her
doomed lover 580 kilometers away,
and hung up.
Fast forward: four years later, the
double-agent has given up the life of a
spy and has taken a quiet residence in
Rio. Her life is simple, the view from her
tiny flat of the seabound ships giving just
enough reminder of what she left across
the Atlantic. And as she slowly fades
away, the forgotten weapon of a treach
erous state, "Misery is a Butterfly," still
carries her along.
"Misery" is Blonde Redhead's
first album since 2000's "Melody of
Certain Damaged Lemons," and the
four-year absence has brought a new
sound as well as a new record label,
4AD. Whereas "Lemons" and 1998's
"In an Expression of the Inexpress
ible" flaunted the band's rough,
Sonic Youth-influenced no-wave

pop, "Misery" has plumbed for
something darker yet paradoxically
more polished.
On "Messenger," the second track,
vocalist Amadeo Pace moans his signa
ture moan over a song built not upon
dissonance or aggression, but upon
dreamy, anxious pop reminiscent of
4AD alums Pale Saints, Throwing
Muses or Love and Rockets at their
most brooding. The album's arrange
ments are more elaborate and ethereal,
with strings inhabiting many tracks, but
the songs lack focus and "Misery" strug
gles to find its identity.
The actual sound of the album suffers
less than mood. "Misery" shows Blonde
Redhead at their most intricate and del
icate sound yet. but it spends most of its
time in the same dysphoria at the ex
pense of the variation of "Lemons" or
the chaotic dissonance of "Expression."
The songs arc pretty, but the over
wrought, misguided tension of the
album dulls Blonde Redhead's rough

edges so much,
"Misery" comes
off sounding
like the
soundtrack lo
some heavy-hand

ed, melodramatic spy
movie. And so ...

They have hired her again
and she waits at the docks for her con
tact. With the ocean breeze, her spy
instincts begin their tentative reawak
ening, goose bumps rising all over her
skin. When he finally appears behind
her, she knows before she sees him.
Before she can turn to embrace
Jacques, he puts his gloved hand on
her shoulder, draws her near, and
whispers those same two words into
her car. Jacques releases her and
walks away into the fog, and as the
psychedelia of "Misery'"s "Pink
Love" swells into its aching chorus,
she sighs the words to herself: indie
rock,indie rock.
