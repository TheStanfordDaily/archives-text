# The

### WILL OREMUS INTERMISSION WRITER 
Four reasons why the garage-rock revival is not cool any
more: Jet. The Vines. The Hives. The Von Bondics. These
guys' careers were made for Gap Jeans ads. Gap Jeans ads
never feature the same band twice. A plea to these four
groups: Break up immediately, for everyone's sake, break up
in a fit of violence and claim "artistic differences" as though
there were a difference between total artlessness and pure
commcrcialistic crap. Better to be a one-hit wonder than to
be Candlebox.
The Black Keys? The Mando Diao? The Dirtbombs? All
just quirky enough to avoid the Next Big Thing curse and
preclude mainstream success. Ever. No footnotes in the his
tory books for these guys, just a buncha loyal fans, a few years
full of transcendent, stage-stomping, beer-spewing gigs, and
a lot of good times to look back on when they're old and re
ally weird.
The Strokes? The White Stripes? You've made it. Just
don't get too comfortable. The only thing worse than a
wanna-bc is a has-been.
Now comes this band called The Hiss. They do garage
rock revival. There are four of them, and they come from At
lanta. With dreadful timing, they have just released a new
garage-rock album called "Panic Movement," which I'll
come back to in a second.
Hirst, we need to pigeonhole these dudes. What, I'm sup
posed to make up a whole new category just fora band that
sings/screams crap like "I know I can make you love me /
Down by the riverbed" over the obligatory throbbing guitars
and pounding drums? Well, I won't do it.
I hey seem like prime candidates for inclusion in the Jet /
Vines category. Like Jet, they crib shamelessly from the leg
ends. "Riverbed" is a Zeppelin song with a few modern in
novations, like reverb guitars and vocals that don't sound like

they're being sung by a acid-addled
androgyne. "Listen to Me" and
Step Aside" arc Oasis without the
soaring choral climax.
And, like The Vines, The Hiss
occasionally veer embarrassingly
close to the sound of some of the
whackest bands working. "Hard
Io Lose" would be indistinguish
able from Everclear if only the
singer were bitching about his dad
leaving him 40 years ago. Instead,

, , j" > J O '
he s delivering nonsense like 'it's hard to lose / When
you're not winning."
But, unlike either Jet or the Vines, The Hiss at least seem
sincere. You almost feel sorry for them when you think about
the fact that they probably didn't have cynical critics in mind
when they wrote some of their most hackneyed and ridicule
ready lyrics. But then, you realize that a) this lack of pretense

is cxactly what re
deems the band; and b) their ability
to rock the panties off the girls at their shows kind
of obviates their need to impress cynieal critics.

How do 1 know they're sincere?
Well, it's either that, or they're mo
rons. 11" they were a commercial <

spring of 2004. The timing couldn't be
worse. Being a garage-rock band was avant

garde four years ago, cool three years ago, trendy
two years ago and annoying last year. By this time it's like
being Ace of Base.
Clearly, The Hiss don't give a shit. And that in itself puts
them in a different category than fashion-plate poseurs like
The Hives.
But do they have the substance, the originality and the ap
peal to transcend their limited (and doomed) genre like the
Strokes or the Stripes? Not judging from this LP. Worship
them or hate them, those bands have a sound and personali
ty that are distinct, instantly recognizable and universally ac
cessible. The Hiss's sound and personality, at this point, arc
purely derivative of their rock'n'roll forefathers.
So does that leave The Hiss in the company of bands like
the Black Keys, destined to impress Pitchfork and rock hot
shows but never win mainstream success?
No. There's another option: oblivion. The band could end
up being completely ignored. (In the U.S., that is —in
Britain, they're apparently the heroes of the moment thanks
to the disgusting hype machine that is NME.) That's proba
bly what will happen if the band doesn't develop a more
unique and compelling identity on its next album.
But until then, "Panic Movement" is actually worth lis-

tcning to, and any live shows The Hiss
play are not to be missed. Because at
their best, they rock HARD. Think
"Take the Long Road and Walk It" by
The Music. Never heard of it? Damn.
Urn, try Oasis crossed with Social Dis
tortion. Can't imagine it? Then get
some imagination, fool.
"Triumph" and "Riverbed" are
two of the best rock riffs of the year, and
should be played at top volume — with
the windows UP. Because, as I said,

garage-rock is at that awful spot between mainstream and
indie culture where, if you listen to it conspicuously, it looks
like you're trying to be cool but failing miserably. Like the kid
in Offspring's "fretty Fly fora White Guy" who wanted Ice
Cube but bought Vanilla Ice.
Or like me, who just revealed that I used to listen to the
Offspring. Ahh, whatever. I like The Hiss, too.
