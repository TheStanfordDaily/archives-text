If you have to ask, you'll
lever get it. It's beyond you. It's
high art. Besides, it's David Fuck
ing Bowie.
You know, I can't do this any
more. I've spent a long time holding
Bowie up as an icon in the canon of
rock & roll. Ziggy Stardust in all of his
gender-bending excess laid waste in
advance to all future imitators. He
preempted glam rock because he kept
himself on the painfully sharp cutting
edge of it all — always changing. Like
the Beatles or Radiohcad. Every
album was a shock.
But Bowie hasn't shocked me in a
long time. I don't need the red mullet
or the androgyny or rumors of doing
the more-than-friends with Mick Jag
ger. No, I think that Bowie has been
great since then — I don't see his days
on Mars as a frozen prime, never to be
touched again. 1997's "I'm Afraid of
Americans" was provocative in that
good way. I'd even give "Little Won
der" off of 2002's "Heathen" a nod if 1
really had to. But the fact of the mat
ter is, I don't think Bowie has been
making progress for about three al
bums now.
Is he ahead of his time? Perhaps.
But in that inaccurate way that film
makers in the '50s thought that we'd all
be driving flying cars by now. His music
as it stands on "Hours" is from a future
that I don't think is going to happen.
I'm hoping it's not going to happen.
People say that Jimi Hendrix would
have thrived like a ilower in the sun
amongst all the audio technology avail
able today. Well, maybe — but he has
the advantage of being dead and safely
out removed from the debate. Bowie,
however, is still churning out albums,
and, perhaps not unlike the hypotheti
cal Hendrix, is just God-awfully
drowning in the guitar synths, samples,
compressors and Pro Tooled muck of
the 21st century studio.
Ziggy channeled a future that 1
wanted to be a part of. It was cosmic
but accessible. He told stories.
Bowie, today, takes us to the dark, al
ternate, but parallel decade where
Uncle Biff kingpins a gambling em
pire, Marty's existence is uncertain,
and Mrs. McFly has implants. Slight
ly appealing, but inferior to the orig
inal, nonetheless.
And I feel like it comes from a
lack of effort. Lyrics aren't every
thing, but when I hear Bowie singing
in that honeyed vibrato about
"still[ing] his trembling heart," I
think sure, it could work if he was
selling it better, but why do I need to
put in the effort to rationalize the
poor quality when it seems that he's
not willing to put in the effort to
make quality lyrical content?
Bowie used to do it right. I doru't
know what's going on now because
"Hours" is covered in a thick goo of
impossibly wet mixing, often rendering
the counterintuitive changes and odd

lyrics indecipherable. Per
haps that was a self-preservation
mechanism on Bowie's part. Regard
less, we arc still left with songs like
"Seven" that sound like open mic at a
Goth bar. On Tatooine. With C3PO
on lead vocals.
That's the thing: The songwriting
on "Hours" is unbelievably sub-parlor
someone the likes of David Fucking
Bowie. Maybe he knew this and tried
to fill in the gaps with spaccy, canned
robo-guitar and sludgy vocal effects a
la phone stalker from the first
"Scream." The prominence of his ex
tragalactic guitarist — apparently
cryo-catalogued in the '80s and fed
nothing but Orgy and Zakk Wylde
until thawed out for Bowie's latest
album — and layer upon layer of digi
tal mud might suggest an effort at cov
ering up flimsy musical craftsmanship.
I'd like not to believe that, but it's
tough to listen to the hokey chord
changes and lazy arrangement on
"Survive" without conjuring images of
a Valium-addled Brian May, bending
over a drum machine in a Martian stu
dio that's 40 degrees hotter than it
should be.
It's the sort of music that would
go great with four minutes and 11
seconds of lackadaisical sex after a
10 a.m. polisci lecture. Shame on the
synthesizer. Check that: Shame on
Bowie for using a synthesizer in lieu
of a bona fide, wood 'n' catgut string
section. I am baffled as to why film
scorers and rock artists alike insist
on committing this, the cardinal sin
of orchestral integrity. Perhaps this
is the son-ol'-L.A. studio musicians
part of me talking, but why why
WHY would Bowie take his future
vibe so far as to actually go through
with putting 16-bit Nintendo-esque
digi-strings on any of his non
tongue-in-cheek cuts, let alone a
would-be "American Beauty"
soundtrack like "Brilliant Adven
ture." God, 1 felt like I was watching
a late night Cinemax version of
Cirque du Soleil.
Believe me, this isn't easy for me.
David Bowie is one of my heroes —
the man is 99 percent watertight for
me, but it's that 1 percent that keeps
nagging at me when I listen to
"Hours." If Bowie keeps on like he
has for the past three albums, he's
going to start losing devotees like my
self, and he has neither the crossover
nor family appeal of fellow aging
rocker, Peter Gabriel, to at least his
financial butt. I can't see Bowie scor
ing Disney's next animated journey
into palatable ethnic folklore. He just
doesn't fit in anywhere else besides
right there on the razor-blade fine
line between canonical brilliance and
lazy excess.
Sock it to me, David —where's
that genius? I know you've got it.
Check under the digital effects rack
— maybe you left it there.


David Bowie as the Goblin King in "Labyrinth,"
where he falls in love with a young Jennifer Con
nelly. Seriously.
