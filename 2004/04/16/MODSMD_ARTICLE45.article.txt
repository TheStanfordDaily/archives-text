# The 						San Francisco Int'l Film Festival

### ANTHONY HA BARRETT SHERIDAN INTERMISSION WRITERS 
Based on gross box office re
ceipts and barometers of popular
culture such as the ever-informative
"Entertainment Weekly," it's not
much of a leap to say that everyone
— young or old. male or female,
sickly or well, philandering or prude
— loves movies.
The expectant hush as the lights
dim, the pale glow on audience mem
bers' faces as the first previews roll
(or, in today's corporate-laden cine
matic culture, the first advertise
ments). Going to the movies is one of
those natural highs that high school
health teachers push in hopes of
thwarting real drug use.
But while it's a safe bet to say that
everyone is a movie-lover, modern
American society breeds very few
movie fanatics. Sure, you saw "Lost in
Translation" because critics wet
themselves over Bill and Scarlett, and

you cried at the melodrama
of "Far From Heaven," but
have you ever camped out
overnight in 10 degree
weather to score a ticket to a
film you've only read a para
graph about? Do you clip
out reviews of the releases
you're most excited about
and paste them into a weath
ered. almost-full notebook?
The 47th Annual San
Francisco International Film
Festival, or SFIFF, right in
your backyard, is your wel
come mat into the world of
film fanaticism. It is one of

the most prestigious film shebangs on
the globe, clocking in just a few sec
onds behind Sundance and the palm
and-sand debauchery of Cannes. It's
your chance to see films — not just
movies — that will be the critics' buzz
words for the next year-and-a-half.
The festival kicked off Wednesday
night with "Coffee and Cigarettes,"
Jim Jarmusch's quirky feature that

puts R7.A and GZA of Wu-Tang
Clan into a conversation on alterna
tive medicine with Bill Murray while
Meg and Jack White of The White
Stripes fool around with a Tesla coil.
This festival-opener has come and
gone, but don't worry. The festival
runs through April 29 and will feature
175 films, including three world pre
mieres, two international premieres,
three North American premieres and

two U.S. premieres.
Other SFIFF events
include the presentation of
the Film Society Award for
directing to Milos Forman
("Amadeus") and a"State of
Cinema" address by critic
and UC-Berkeley Adjunct
Prof. B. Ruby Rich.
Among the films
receiving their world pre
mieres at this year's SFIFF
are "Girl Trouble", a docu
mentary focusing on three
teenage girls and their trou
bles with the San Francisco
justice system; "Brass

Tacks," which tells the story of a
struggling jazz band; and "Mar
ronnier," a Japanese horror flick fea
turing puppets. The selection of films
is truly international, including 17
movies from Pacific Asia.
Sponsored by the San Francis
co Film Society, SFIFF will close
with a screening of the Peter
Howitt-helmed romantic comedy
"Laws of Attraction."
Let us put it this way: if you don't
attend this year's SFIFF, you're a fool.
Last year was the first time ei
ther of us had been to a film festival.
And while it was a far cry from what
we'd heard about the glitz and
glamour of Cannes and Sundance
— especially since we couldn't fina
gle a press pass to any of the parties
or awards ceremonies — it was still
ridiculously fun.
Manv of the screenings are held at

the AMC Kabuki, an Oriental
themed monstrosity with beautiful
theaters that look more like opera
houses. Crowds crammed into the
multiplex to see everything from ob
scure Iranian art films to insane Hong
Kong action extravaganzas. The walls
were lined with gorgeous posters,
generally of foreign films that didn't
even get a limited release in the Unit
ed States.
At an event like SFIFF, you get
to watch movies that you'd never
have a chance to see anywhere else
— Anthony's favorite was
"Woman of Water," a gorgeous,
haunting Japanese exercise in
melancholia — surrounded by
people who are just as excited by
film as you are, not the morons who
often surround you when you go to
see "The Punisher."
As an experience, it approaches
cinematic heaven.
But maybe you're on the fence.
Maybe you're thinking, "Sure, I enjoy
movies. But there's that Econ 50
problem set due next Friday. I should
get started on that. 1 mean, let's think
about the opportunity cost here."
Do yourself a favor and get cul
tured. If you're the type of person that
finds himself or herself condemning
modern cinema for wasting valuable
(and scarce) resources on celluloid for
"Scooby-Doo 2," you owe it to your
self to attend SFIFF.

society's Web site, http://www.sffs.org.


Among others, Tom Waits, Cate Klanchctt and Iggy Pop

Wednesday night." Yurn, coffee," says Barrett." Y uni, Iggy
Pop," says Tam.
