# Intermission's guide to the SF Int'l Film Festival
## The 						movies we're wetting ourselves to see 
### 
'Triple Agent'
Directed by Eric Rohmer
Eric Rohmer's homage to Alfred
Hitchcock is an espionage thriller
set in 1930s France. A Russian gen
eral and his beautiful Greek wife
live in exile in a Paris rife with polit
ical intrigue; the Popular Front is on
the rise, as is tension with Nazi Ger
many and infighting between rival
Russian exile communities. While
the general disappears on secretive
"errands," the wife befriends their
new neighbors, a couple almost
over-enthusiastic in their support of
the Popular Front. As her husband
grows more mysterious, everyone
begins to realize that he's a spy;
everyone, that is, except his wife,
whose questions are always quickly,
and too smoothly, answered. While
bowing to the usual spy-movie con
ventions of clandestine meetings
and political intrigues, "Triple
Agent" still possesses Rohmer's
hallmark: people lounging about
apartments having refined discus
sions about life, love and liberties.
Wed. Kabuki, 9:30 p.m.
Thur. Kabuki, 6:45 p.m.
INTERMISSION SAYS: No one
can pass up a well-done spy thriller,
especially one set during World War
11. We know that it's only playing on
weeknights, but sometimes Thurs
day can be just as good an excuse to
forget about schoolwork as Friday.

'The Park'
Directed by Andrew Lau
Everyone knows you don't go
poking around abandoned amuse
ment parks, especially ones that
closed after the death of a little girl
who mysteriously fell from the Fer
ris Wheel. But tell that to Alan,
who's feeling a strange tug toward
the park after he reads an old
newspaper article about its closing
14 years ago. So, he wanders in ...
but he doesn't wander out. "The
Park" is partially in 3-D, and that
can only mean mayhem. From An
drew Lau, the director of some of
Hong Kong's hottest films of the
last ten years, comes this roller
coaster ride of a horror movie,
packed with everything you've
ever wanted from a 3-D haunted
amusement park movie: demonic
children, crazy caretakers, scary
clowns, hopping vampires, be
headings and thrills galore.
—Carlo Mosburg
Fri. Kabuki, Midnight
Sun. Kabuki, 12:45 p.m.
INTERMISSION SAYS: No one
the Intermission staff has seen this
one yet, but the synopsis makes it
sound as scary as Michael Jackson at
your son or daughter's playground.
And it's in 3-D! Relive the glory days
of "Captain Eo" at Disneyland by
donning those red-and-blue specs for
this freak fest.

k The Saddest Music
in the World"
Directed by Guy Matldin
A wintry gloom has settled upon
Depression-era Winnipeg in Guy
Maddin's newest brew-ha-ha, a joy
ously stilted comedy wed to the vi
sual extravagance of a dizzy '30s
musical. To dig out from beneath
the snowy pall. Lady Port-Huntly
(Isabella Rossellini), a bewitching
beer baroness, announces a compe
tition to determine which nation
possesses the most sorrowful song.
Performers from every lamentable
land descend upon Port-Huntly's
brewery to challenge the world with
their doleful strains. This heady
brew floats the bubbly sorrows of
individual souls in a frothy keg of
universal misery, stirred all the
while by an intoxicating wit. Like
many of Maddin's ingenious films,
"The Saddest Music in the World"
is gussied up in the alluring aesthet
ics of vintage cinema.
—Steve Seid
Fri. Pacific Film Archive, 7:10 p.m.
Sun. Kabuki, 8:45 p.m.
INTERMISSION SAYS: Isabella
Rossellini has two beer-filled glass
legs (she lost the real ones in a car ac
cident) but is still smoking hot. "The
Saddest Music" is so melodramatic
it's lighthearted. Plus, it's Canadian.
Go see it just to support our good
friends to the North.

'Control Room'
Directed by Jchane Noujaim
Mention A1 Jazeera three years
ago and you'd likely get blank
stares from most Americans; now
the name of the Arab world's most
popular news outlet is well known
for its reporting of the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and for Ameri
can television's nearly obsessive
coverage of that reporting. Chart
ing the struggles of A1 Jazeera,
CNN and other journalists to
cover, or create, news, "Control
Room" takes audiences inside the
war in Iraq, or at least the buildings
where it was presented — like AI
Jazeera headquarters — as well as
U.S. Central Command, sight of
the war's most important battles:
the press conferences. For the
journalists of Al Jazeera, the prob
lem is twofold: getting information
from an increasingly oppositional
American military and then deal
ing with the fact that their network
is suddenly "news" itself.

depicts the war from a non-U.S. per
spective — counts as your civic duty
for the week.

DIG!'
Directed by Ondi Timoner
Being at the right place at the
right time is what makes "DIG!" im
portant, but being in the wrong place
— like in the path of a flying mike
stand — is what makes it exhilarat
ing. Seven years in the making, and
culled from 1,500 hours of footage,
Ondi Timoner's film tracks the tu
multuous rise of two talented musi
cians, Anton Newcombe, leader of
the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and
Courtney Taylor, leader of the
Dandy Warhols, and dissects their
star-crossed friendship and bitter ri
valry. Taylor puts it best: "Anton is
my friend and my enemy, the great
est inspiration and, ultimately, the
greatest regret." Both are hell-bent
on staging a self-proclaimed revolu
tion of the music industry. Timoner
keeps up with them through their
loves and obsessions, gigs and
recordings, arrests and death threats,
uppers and downers and ultimately
to their chance at a piece of the prof
it-driven music business.

'Control Room'
Directed by Jchane Noujaim
Mention A1 Jazeera three years
ago and you'd likely get blank
stares from most Americans; now
the name of the Arab world's most
popular news outlet is well known
for its reporting of the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and for Ameri
can television's nearly obsessive
coverage of that reporting. Chart
ing the struggles of A1 Jazeera,
CNN and other journalists to
cover, or create, news, "Control
Room" takes audiences inside the
war in Iraq, or at least the buildings
where it was presented — like AI
Jazeera headquarters — as well as
U.S. Central Command, sight of
the war's most important battles:
the press conferences. For the
journalists of Al Jazeera, the prob
lem is twofold: getting information
from an increasingly oppositional
American military and then deal
ing with the fact that their network
is suddenly "news" itself.

DIG!'
Directed by Ondi Timoner
Being at the right place at the
right time is what makes "DIG!" im
portant, but being in the wrong place
— like in the path of a flying mike
stand — is what makes it exhilarat
ing. Seven years in the making, and
culled from 1,500 hours of footage,
Ondi Timoner's film tracks the tu
multuous rise of two talented musi
cians, Anton Newcombe, leader of
the Brian Jonestown Massacre, and
Courtney Taylor, leader of the
Dandy Warhols, and dissects their
star-crossed friendship and bitter ri
valry. Taylor puts it best: "Anton is
my friend and my enemy, the great
est inspiration and, ultimately, the
greatest regret." Both are hell-bent
on staging a self-proclaimed revolu
tion of the music industry. Timoner
keeps up with them through their
loves and obsessions, gigs and
recordings, arrests and death threats,
uppers and downers and ultimately
to their chance at a piece of the prof
it-driven music business.

'Triple Agent'
Directed by Eric Rohmer
Eric Rohmer's homage to Alfred
Hitchcock is an espionage thriller
set in 1930s France. A Russian gen
eral and his beautiful Greek wife
live in exile in a Paris rife with polit
ical intrigue; the Popular Front is on
the rise, as is tension with Nazi Ger
many and infighting between rival
Russian exile communities. While
the general disappears on secretive
"errands," the wife befriends their
new neighbors, a couple almost
over-enthusiastic in their support of
the Popular Front. As her husband
grows more mysterious, everyone
begins to realize that he's a spy;
everyone, that is, except his wife,
whose questions are always quickly,
and too smoothly, answered. While
bowing to the usual spy-movie con
ventions of clandestine meetings
and political intrigues, "Triple
Agent" still possesses Rohmer's
hallmark: people lounging about
apartments having refined discus
sions about life, love and liberties.
Wed. Kabuki, 9:30 p.m.
Thur. Kabuki, 6:45 p.m.
INTERMISSION SAYS: No one
can pass up a well-done spy thriller,
especially one set during World War
11. We know that it's only playing on

'The Park'
Directed by Andrew Lau
Everyone knows you don't go
poking around abandoned amuse
ment parks, especially ones that
closed after the death of a little girl
who mysteriously fell from the Fer
ris Wheel. But tell that to Alan,
who's feeling a strange tug toward
the park after he reads an old
newspaper article about its closing
14 years ago. So, he wanders in ...
but he doesn't wander out. "The
Park" is partially in 3-D, and that
can only mean mayhem. From An
drew Lau, the director of some of
Hong Kong's hottest films of the
last ten years, comes this roller
coaster ride of a horror movie,
packed with everything you've
ever wanted from a 3-D haunted
amusement park movie: demonic
children, crazy caretakers, scary
clowns, hopping vampires, be
headings and thrills galore.

k The Saddest Music
in the World"
Directed by Guy Matldin
A wintry gloom has settled upon
Depression-era Winnipeg in Guy
Maddin's newest brew-ha-ha, a joy
ously stilted comedy wed to the vi
sual extravagance of a dizzy '30s
musical. To dig out from beneath
the snowy pall. Lady Port-Huntly
(Isabella Rossellini), a bewitching
beer baroness, announces a compe
tition to determine which nation
possesses the most sorrowful song.
Performers from every lamentable
land descend upon Port-Huntly's
brewery to challenge the world with
their doleful strains. This heady
brew floats the bubbly sorrows of
individual souls in a frothy keg of
universal misery, stirred all the
while by an intoxicating wit. Like
many of Maddin's ingenious films,
"The Saddest Music in the World"
is gussied up in the alluring aesthet
ics of vintage cinema.
