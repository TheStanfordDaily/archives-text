## Nobel Laureate at S'ford 
### ERIN LASHNITS INTERMISSION WRITER 
Of all the obscure facts of John M.
Coetzee's life, probably the least
known is how to correctly pronounce
his last name. For some, it rhymes with
tootsie, for others it's closer to gutsy,
and here at Stanford we've added a
third syllable for an overall effect that
approximates the second half of anes
thesia spoken like a Brit with a nasty
head cold.
Besides an unpronounceable last
name, Coetzee is also known for his lit
erary scholarship, essays and novels.
Heralded as one of the greatest living
writers, Coetzee won the 2003 Nobel
Prize in Literature and is one of only
two people to ever win the Booker
Prize, Britain's most prestigious fic
tion honor, twice. Most recently Coet
zee is appearing as Stanford's Isaac
and Madeline Stein Visiting Writer.
Coetzee was born and raised in
Cape Town, South Africa, of mixed
Boer and English descent. In the 1960s
he moved to England to take a job as a
computer programmer before coming
to the U.S. to study literature at the
University of Texas at Austin. While
he made his literary debut in 1974 with
"Dusklands," which contained two
novellas, it was not until 1980 that he
found international success with his
novel "Waiting for the Barbarians."
Coetzee has subsequently taught Eng
lish and English Literature at universi
ties around the U.S. as well as the Uni
versity of Cape Town and the Univer
sity of Adelaide, Australia, and has
published eight novels, a number of
critical essays, and two memoirs. He
last came to Stanford as a visiting pro
fessor of English in 2002, and now re
turns to teach creative writing.
In a reading from his work on

Wednesday, Coetzee treated
the standing room only audience
at Kresge. Auditorium to a never
before heard excerpt from a
work in progress, as well as a
reading of one of his lesser

known stories "A House in Spain,"
which was originally published in the
Architectural Digest in 2000.
A formidable figure in his nicely
tailored charcoal suit and tasteful
charcoal tie, glasses slipping halfway
down his long nose, Coetzee began by
reminding the crowd that while it was
enjoyable to hear a well known story
read by the author as he intended it, it
was perhaps more exciting to listen to
a new, unpublished work in progress.
The excerpt he read from included the
title character of his most recent novel,
"Elizabeth Costello," in a different
and less prominent role.
While he spoke slowly, almost re
luctantly in introduction and transi
tion between the two pieces, with the
first sentence of reading his voice
took on a deep melody, with the un
dertone of a smirk as though he was
imparting a not-quite-so-secret secret
to the audience. A hint of irony made
its way to the surface in both pieces,
drawing chuckles from the crowd
with one sentence while dropping the
last trace of a smile from each per
son's face with the next.
The excerpt from Coetzee's work
in progress revealed some of the most
common themes of his work, simulta
neously delighting in and criticizing
the absurdity of people's desires and
the lengths to which they will go to ful
fill them. With superb control of lan
guage and tone, Coetzee managed to
personify the cruelty of individual van
ity and the tension inherent in public
exhibition of private insecurities using
the almost farcical setup of two unlike
ly characters.
Coetzee's next reading will be a col
loquium open to the general public on
May 12 in the Terrace Room of Mar
garet Jacks Hall.


Ah, the poignant gaze
of a sensitive artist.
The proof is in the
white facial hair.
