## National recruiting scandals prompt examination of trips 
### ERIN LASHNITS 
Allegations of sexual assault at a party for football re
cruits at the University of Colorado have thrown college
athlete-recruiting practices into the national spotlight. In
response, many universities are reassessing existing poli
cies to ensure that recruiting practices are appropriate
and legal.
Though Stanford has not had any major incidents in
volving recruiting improprieties, the University is close
ly monitoring national developments and examining its
own policies, Athletic Director Ted Leland said.
The NCAA has taken action on a national level, Pres
ident Myles Brand formed a task force in February to re
view and change policies in time for next fall's football
recruiting season. A formal proposal from the task force
is expected by April 20.
The possible changes include eliminating paid visits
for football recruits altogether, shortening these visits
from 48 to 24 hours, reducing the number of allowed of
ficial visits from five to three and capping university
spending on travel, meals, lodging and entertainment.
Congress has also warned that if the NCAA and its
member institutions cannot clean up the recruiting
process they will face federal intervention.
Stanford's administration has not vet made any for

mal statement responding to the proposed changes, but
according to Leland, Stanford is in the process of re
viewing its recruiting policies, and deciding whether a
faculty review or internal investigation is necessary.
"There is a long-standing tradition going back 60 to 70
years of campus visits for all prospective students, not
just prospective athletes," Leland said. "The administra
tion enacted changes for the Admit Weekend a few years
ago in response to national headlines, and I think it is
time for the Athletics Department to look at recruiting in
the same way."
While the Athletics Department is waiting for the
official report of the NCAA task force before making
any policy changes, Leland said he would support the
elimination of paid visits, as well as the restriction of en
tertainment to on campus activities with adult chaper
ones present.
Policy changes that decrease the number or length of
visits, or the University's ability to pay for visits, would
not be desirable, Leland said.
"Now, we can pay for transportation and lodging,"
Leland said. "This makes the dream of becoming a Stan
ford athlete accessible to all prospective students. The
downside to these changes would be that prospective stu
dents from disadvantaged backgrounds would not be
able to pay for their own visits and never even get here to

see the school."
Student athletes are also concerned that more restric
tive regulations will hurt the recruits themselves.
"It is hard enough fora prospective student athlete to
decide whether he or she will fit in during the current 48
hours allotted for each visit," said Cassidy Krug, a fresh
man on the women's diving team who was heavily re
cruited last year. "Twenty-four hours is not enough time
to decide where you will spend the next four years,"
Krug's teammate, junior Adam Peterson agreed.
"Choosing a college is a serious issue," Peterson said.
"It isn't right to restrict someone's ability to make a de
cision that will affect the next four years of their life."
Krug also wondered if the NCAA's proposed changes
will make it harder for teams to give recruits a useful and
informative visit.
"While a team does have a responsibility to be safe
and helpful during recruiting weekends, they are also re
sponsible for giving their visitor an accurate representa
tion of typical team activities, dynamics and attitudes,"
he said.
Some athletes predicted that the recruiting process
will change drastically next year.
"With all of the scandals, regardless of whether the
NCAA actually implements any changes, we are going to
have to be extra careful with recruiting," said football

player Capp Culver, a junior.
According to Leland, Stanford has not had any spe
cific problems with recruiting practices, but he does think
it is important that Stanford continue to be careful.
"Any time you bring young people onto campus and
are responsible for them, there is a worry that something
will go wrong," said Leland. "We are in the same jeop
ardy as other schools, and I am not naive enough to think
that hosts and prospective athletes do not sometimes
make bad decisions, but we do rely on the overall good
judgment of our students and prospective students."
Some students also fear that there is potential for
problematic recruiting at Stanford.
"I've heard of some really sexist things that go on dur
ing recruiting, like using attractive girls to impress male
recruits," said junior Miya Woolfalk. "If tighter recruit
ing regulations can begin to change this attitude, then I
would support them."
But many student athletes hold the opposite opinion.
"I don't think anything too questionable goes on here
during recruiting," Peterson said.
Junior soccer player Darren Fernandez echoed this
opinion.
"Our coach does everything by the books, and is very
serious about following NCAA reg
ulations," he said.
According to Leland, there is a
simple reason that Stanford teams
are not tempted to use illegal re
cruiting practices.
"The student athletes we attract
at Stanford aren't swayed by any
wild entertainment but come for
the balance of outstanding athlet
ics and academics," he said. "Our

recruiting edge is not our parties
â€” although I do hope we have
good parties."
Krug agrees with this view.
"Stanford has so much more
to offer than your average large
state jock school," Krug said.
"We don't need crude gimmicks
like free sex and alcohol to
make up athletes minds as they
choose which high profile sports
program to commit themselves
to, and anyone who still isn't
convinced to come to Stanford
without being bribed with the
best liquor wouldn't do well
here anyway."

are not tempted to use illegal re
cruiting practices.
"The student athletes we attract
at Stanford aren't swayed by any
wild entertainment but come for
the balance of outstanding athlet
ics and academics," he said. "Our

recruiting edge is not our parties
â€” although I do hope we have
good parties."
Krug agrees with this view.
"Stanford has so much more
to offer than your average large
state jock school," Krug said.
"We don't need crude gimmicks
like free sex and alcohol to
make up athletes minds as they
choose which high profile sports
program to commit themselves
to, and anyone who still isn't
convinced to come to Stanford
without being bribed with the
best liquor wouldn't do well
here anyway."
Allegations of sexual assault at a party for football re
cruits at the University of Colorado have thrown college
athlete-recruiting practices into the national spotlight. In
response, many universities are reassessing existing poli
cies to ensure that recruiting practices are appropriate
and legal.
Though Stanford has not had any major incidents in
volving recruiting improprieties, the University is close
ly monitoring national developments and examining its
own policies, Athletic Director Ted Leland said.
The NCAA has taken action on a national level, Pres
ident Myles Brand formed a task force in February to re
view and change policies in time for next fall's football
recruiting season. A formal proposal from the task force
is expected by April 20.
The possible changes include eliminating paid visits
for football recruits altogether, shortening these visits
from 48 to 24 hours, reducing the number of allowed of
ficial visits from five to three and capping university
spending on travel, meals, lodging and entertainment.
Congress has also warned that if the NCAA and its
member institutions cannot clean up the recruiting
process they will face federal intervention.
Stanford's administration has not vet made any for

mal statement responding to the proposed changes, but
according to Leland, Stanford is in the process of re
viewing its recruiting policies, and deciding whether a
faculty review or internal investigation is necessary.
"There is a long-standing tradition going back 60 to 70
years of campus visits for all prospective students, not
just prospective athletes," Leland said. "The administra
tion enacted changes for the Admit Weekend a few years
ago in response to national headlines, and I think it is
time for the Athletics Department to look at recruiting in
the same way."
While the Athletics Department is waiting for the
official report of the NCAA task force before making
any policy changes, Leland said he would support the
elimination of paid visits, as well as the restriction of en
tertainment to on campus activities with adult chaper
ones present.
Policy changes that decrease the number or length of
visits, or the University's ability to pay for visits, would
not be desirable, Leland said.
"Now, we can pay for transportation and lodging,"
Leland said. "This makes the dream of becoming a Stan
ford athlete accessible to all prospective students. The
downside to these changes would be that prospective stu
dents from disadvantaged backgrounds would not be
able to pay for their own visits and never even get here to

see the school."
Student athletes are also concerned that more restric
tive regulations will hurt the recruits themselves.
"It is hard enough fora prospective student athlete to
decide whether he or she will fit in during the current 48
hours allotted for each visit," said Cassidy Krug, a fresh
man on the women's diving team who was heavily re
cruited last year. "Twenty-four hours is not enough time
to decide where you will spend the next four years,"
Krug's teammate, junior Adam Peterson agreed.
"Choosing a college is a serious issue," Peterson said.
"It isn't right to restrict someone's ability to make a de
cision that will affect the next four years of their life."
Krug also wondered if the NCAA's proposed changes
will make it harder for teams to give recruits a useful and
informative visit.
"While a team does have a responsibility to be safe
and helpful during recruiting weekends, they are also re
sponsible for giving their visitor an accurate representa
tion of typical team activities, dynamics and attitudes,"
he said.
Some athletes predicted that the recruiting process
will change drastically next year.
"With all of the scandals, regardless of whether the
NCAA actually implements any changes, we are going to
have to be extra careful with recruiting," said football

player Capp Culver, a junior.
According to Leland, Stanford has not had any spe
cific problems with recruiting practices, but he does think
it is important that Stanford continue to be careful.
"Any time you bring young people onto campus and
are responsible for them, there is a worry that something
will go wrong," said Leland. "We are in the same jeop
ardy as other schools, and I am not naive enough to think
that hosts and prospective athletes do not sometimes
make bad decisions, but we do rely on the overall good
judgment of our students and prospective students."
Some students also fear that there is potential for
problematic recruiting at Stanford.
"I've heard of some really sexist things that go on dur
ing recruiting, like using attractive girls to impress male
recruits," said junior Miya Woolfalk. "If tighter recruit
ing regulations can begin to change this attitude, then I
would support them."
But many student athletes hold the opposite opinion.
"I don't think anything too questionable goes on here
during recruiting," Peterson said.
Junior soccer player Darren Fernandez echoed this
opinion.
"Our coach does everything by the books, and is very
serious about following NCAA reg
ulations," he said.
