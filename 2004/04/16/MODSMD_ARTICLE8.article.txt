# Hennessy promotes environmental program
## Institute unites new University programs 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
A discussion about the creation of the Stan
ford Institute for the Environment — which
will unify and enhance various existing pro
grams in fields related to the environment —
was the highlight of University President John
Hennessy's annual address in Cubberley Audi
torium yesterday afternoon.
"In recent years we have developed a num
ber of programs that address environmental is
sues across the University such as the Interdisci
plinary Program in Environmental Resources,
the Center for Environmental Science and Pol
icy, the Global Climate and Energy Project and
the Environmental and Natural Resources Pro
gram," Hennessy said. "What we have not had
was a broad infrastructure designed to support
and encourage the growth of these programs
throughout the University."
The institute's potential importance lies in
the many environmental problems that our so
ciety faces. According to Hennessy, over one
billion people lack access to clean drinking
water and over two billion lack access to suit
able sewage systems.
"At the same time we are literally changing
the face of the planet," Hennessy said. "Human
activities are driving the extinctions of species at
faster rates than we have ever seen. The world
population is expected to grow by several billion
people over the next half century and the
world's energy demands are likely to grow even
faster. The challenges before us are critical."
Pamela Matson, dean of the School of Earth
Sciences, said that Stanford needs an interdisci

plinary approach to deal with these problems.
"These are issues that don't yield to simple
approaches," Matson said. "Unfortunately they
are not going to yield to single and disciplinary
perspectives. We need to bring disciplines to
gether to address that."
Matson said that Stanford is well prepared
given the history of interdisciplinary programs
and "low barriers to carrying out research across
departments and across fields." She added that
one-third to one-half of undergraduates finish
with a degree in an interdisciplinary program.
Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof.
Jeffrey Koseff said that Stanford has an excel
lent foundation for work in fields related to
the environment.
"Strong departments and strong schools
mean a strong institute," Koseff said.
In spite of all of the University's strengths,
Law Prof. Buzz Thompson said that Stanford
has some weaknesses that the new institute can
help address, the most noticeable one being lo
cation. Stanford is 3,000 miles from the East
Coast and Washington, D.C., which can make it
hard to analyze governmental policy, Thomp
son said. To deal with the problem, Thompson
stressed the importance of bring ing govern
ment official to the Bay Area.
"We talk about how we have a great Stan
ford at Washington program," Thompson said.
"What we want to do is to create an equally
great Washington at Stanford program."
In his closing remarks, Hennessy empha
sized the promise of the Stanford Institute for
the Environment.
"If we are to learn how to live on this planet
in an environmentally sustainable way, if we are
to leave something we can be proud of for our
children's children's children, we must begin,"
he said. "I believe that the Stanford Institute for
the Environment is uniquely positioned to lead
the way and make a difference in this worth
while effort."
