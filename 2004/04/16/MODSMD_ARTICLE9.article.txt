# Sullivan reports on successes to Fac Sen

### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Outgoing Law School Dean Kathleen Sul
livan highlighted faculty development and
student yield rates in her final presentation on
the current and future status of the Law
School during the Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday afternoon.
Sullivan outlined the Law School's accom
plishments in the last five years, including hir
ing 11 new professors, among them notable
Profs. Rob Daines from New York University
and Mark Lernley from UC-Berkeley. Sulli
van noted, however, that the Law School re
tired eight faculty members and lost five to
other schools.
"The Law School is like a small European
country with low population growth rates,"
she said.
Sullivan also presented data comparing Stan
ford Law School to its competitors in the areas
of student-to-faulty ratio, endowment by stu
dent and faculty, and expenditures by student
and faculty. In all areas, Stanford was near the
head of the pack.
Still, Sullivan admitted to continued difficul
ty in persuading admitted students to choose
Stanford over its two main competitors, Har
vard and Yale. Both schools finished ahead of
Stanford in this year's U.S. News & World Re
port rankings, where Stanford Law School
dropped one place. Among students who are
admitted to both Stanford and Yale Law
Schools, only 5 to 10 percent typically choose
Stanford over Yale. And among students who
are admitted to both Stanford and Harvard, 15

to 24 percent typically end up on the Farm.
When asked by Prof. Eric Roberts what he
should tell a student who is choosing between
Stanford and Yale why they should choose
Stanford, Sullivan facetiously replied. "Tell
them to put on their resume Stanford, J.D., as
terisk, was admitted to Yale."
She then answered the question seriously by
pointing out that Stanford has an extraordinary
public interest faculty and that it has started law
clinics that were better and more intensive than
those at Yale.
Sullivan also noted that Stanford's matricu
lation rate has improved over the past few years,
the result of rigorous recruiting that includes
profiles of current law school students and per
sonalized contact.
"I think I'm the only law school dean who
writes personally to every student who is ad
mitted," Sullivan said. "We aggressively
pursue students and I think it's paid off a
great deal."
Sullivan also highlighted the extensive ren
ovations the Law School has undergone in the
past years as well as the increased diversity of
both the student body and faculty. Thirty-six
percent of those currently enrolled in the Law
School are minorities, and out of the new
hires, 4 out of 11 are minorities while 5 out of
11 are women.
Sullivan concluded the presentation by de
scribing challenges the Law School faces in the
future: the coordination of interdisciplinary work
with other professional departments, faculty re-
cruitment and retention and the cost
of living for students.
When asked what one thing she
would change about the Law
School, Sullivan said that she would

make it "intellectually rigorous at
every level," although she felt that
they were already working towards
that goal.
"We've done an amazing job so
far â€” we've changed academic poli
cies ... and we've ramped up intel
lectual life, which compensates for
being in an area where it doesn't
come to you, like in Boston or New
York," Sullivan said.
