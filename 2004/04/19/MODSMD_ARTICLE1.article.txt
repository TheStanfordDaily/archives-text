# Fire burns on East Campus
## 
### 
Saturday's brush blaze on the east side of Crothers
Memorial Hall drew three fire trucks, an ambulance and
students from surrounding dorms. The cause of the fire
is still uncertain as the Palo Alto Fire Department could
not be reached for comment. Eyewitnesses said the fire
started at approximately 12:30 p.m. Firefighters re
sponded immediately and were able to drown out the
flames within the hour.
While the fire did burn through a sizable portion of
the shrubs directly outside several residents' windows,
it did not cause any damage on the inside of the build
ing. Many of the rooms on that side of the dorm were
evacuated and fire department officials prevented
people from entering until the area was secure.

"When I heard the fire alarm of course I thought it
was a drill," said first-year graduate student and
Crothers resident Jason Anderson. "Then I went to go
to Sweet Hall and I saw everyone standing around and
I realized there was a fire."
Many students from Wilbur, Stern and Branner said
they first smelled something burning in their rooms and
streamed out into Escondido Drive to see gray smoke
billowing into the sky, temporarily obscuring Hoover
Tower from view. After getting a good look at the situ
ation, they trooped back inside to start on their week
end homework.
