## Reflections of a middle-aged Midwesterner 
### PROF. DAVID JOHNSON DEPT. OF ECONOMICS 
I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio in the only U.S. county never
carried by FDR in any of his four victorious presidential campaigns. My
first commercial plane ride took me east to visit colleges at the age of
17, and before my 18th birthday dinner, my mother took me to the post
office to register for the draft.
If any of you know Cincinnati, you probably think Pete Rose shouldn't be
in the Hall of Fame but you fail to recognize that most of your personal hy
giene routine owes its origin to Proctor & Gamble's world headquarters on
sth Street downtown. Trv to make "Proctor & Gamble" a vanitv nlate and

""«• ** j "iwivv i iwviwi ut viainuiv a vamij piaiL auu
you have the name of their best-selling potato chip.
I arrived on the Princeton campus as a freshman in the
fall of 1981 and made my way to Alexander Hall to hear
the president's welcome address. He began by informing
us that he had just returned from Flushing Meadow where
a classmate of ours had reached the women's quarterfi
nals of the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
I raised my hand, proudly, when he asked how many of
us were valedictorians of our high school class ... so did
about 600 others. I felt gratified I hadn't peaked too early!
Four years later, 1 had to choose among seven eco-

nomics doctoral programs, opted for Harvard over
Stanford (in a weak moment) but deferred it a year so I could attend the
London School of Economics and experience a different culture from the
Midwestern ethos I had known and loved. I even heard a foreign lan
guage when I traveled to Scotland (ever seen the monument to Adam
Smith in Edinburgh?).
Early in my doctoral program I began to teach the principles course (at
Harvard it's taught mostly in section by graduate students) and, using The
Boston Globe's editorial page as my guide, came to realize just how eco
nomically illiterate the public was.
Thus was born my passion for introducing students to the wonderful
world of economics. This role has taken me from the Harvard Westlake
School in Los Angeles, to Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where I taught
both principles and intermediate economics to juniors and seniors for
three years. (It was also there that I met my wife!) From Brooklyn, I went
on to Duke for six years where my wife completed her doctoral degree in
botany and genetics and where our daughter Zoe was born. Finally, I
made it to Stanford, where Penelope came eight days late so she could
provide me an excuse to miss the Econ 1 final last spring.
In many ways, I have led a charmed life, but I thought I'd leave you with
two rather important pieces of advice. First, as all of you chose Stanford over
East Boise State or Pepperdine or UC-Davis or Cal, please take full advan
tage of the choices afforded you with this degree. For the two years follow
ing your graduation, be bold; do something radical; namely, service that pas
sion you've held ever since junior high — to join the Peace Corps, to teach
middle school, to work for the Republican National Committee (radical, in
deed!), to go undercover as a dancer in Vegas ... believe me, law school or
Wall Street can wait.
The pressure for the killer job or the killer graduate school experience
often obscures one of the main reasons you opted to come here — choices.
Pity so many students feel the need to pursue immediately that one career
that will please Uncle Henry or Dad or Grandma over those options that
meet only furrowed brows at Thanksgiving your senior fall.
I've never known anyone with a Stanford-caliber degree who's ser
viced a true passion and NOT been successful. How many of you who've
just scoffed at this fortune cookie logic are busy puckering up for your
Merrill interview?
Second, don't forget to have children. Don't find yourself at Le Cirque
celebrating that partnership wondering, divorced at 42, what's next. The
births of my two daughters trump even the '75 World Series. You will find no
more difficult or more frustrating or more gratifying or more joyous role
than that of parent. And certainly none more important in your life.
As you channel surf and reject "My Big Fat Fiancee," you're wistful for
Sesame Street with recent special guests Kofi Annan and 'N Sync. You laugh
at your daughter who refuses to accept the letter "N" — it's just a Z that's
confused! You rejoice when your younger child takes her first steps knowing
this milestone opens yet another Pandora's box of potential dangers.
You spend most of your adult life securing for them the choices you had
— among which will be the one that fuels their passion and makes you proud
of the freedom you gave them, a freedom some loved one is currently giving
all of you.

botany and genetics and where our daughter Zoe was born. Finally, I
made it to Stanford, where Penelope came eight days late so she could
provide me an excuse to miss the Econ 1 final last spring.
In many ways, I have led a charmed life, but I thought I'd leave you with
two rather important pieces of advice. First, as all of you chose Stanford over
East Boise State or Pepperdine or UC-Davis or Cal, please take full advan
tage of the choices afforded you with this degree. For the two years follow
ing your graduation, be bold; do something radical; namely, service that pas
sion you've held ever since junior high — to join the Peace Corps, to teach
middle school, to work for the Republican National Committee (radical, in
deed!), to go undercover as a dancer in Vegas ... believe me, law school or
Wall Street can wait.
The pressure for the killer job or the killer graduate school experience
often obscures one of the main reasons you opted to come here — choices.
Pity so many students feel the need to pursue immediately that one career
that will please Uncle Henry or Dad or Grandma over those options that
meet only furrowed brows at Thanksgiving your senior fall.
I've never known anyone with a Stanford-caliber degree who's ser
viced a true passion and NOT been successful. How many of you who've
just scoffed at this fortune cookie logic are busy puckering up for your
Merrill interview?
Second, don't forget to have children. Don't find yourself at Le Cirque
celebrating that partnership wondering, divorced at 42, what's next. The
births of my two daughters trump even the '75 World Series. You will find no
more difficult or more frustrating or more gratifying or more joyous role
than that of parent. And certainly none more important in your life.
As you channel surf and reject "My Big Fat Fiancee," you're wistful for
Sesame Street with recent special guests Kofi Annan and 'N Sync. You laugh
at your daughter who refuses to accept the letter "N" — it's just a Z that's
confused! You rejoice when your younger child takes her first steps knowing
this milestone opens yet another Pandora's box of potential dangers.
You spend most of your adult life securing for them the choices you had
— among which will be the one that fuels their passion and makes you proud
of the freedom you gave them, a freedom some loved one is currently giving
all of you.

I was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio in the only U.S. county never
carried by FDR in any of his four victorious presidential campaigns. My
first commercial plane ride took me east to visit colleges at the age of
17, and before my 18th birthday dinner, my mother took me to the post
office to register for the draft.
If any of you know Cincinnati, you probably think Pete Rose shouldn't be
in the Hall of Fame but you fail to recognize that most of your personal hy
giene routine owes its origin to Proctor & Gamble's world headquarters on
sth Street downtown. Trv to make "Proctor & Gamble" a vanitv nlate and

you have the name of their best-selling potato chip.
I arrived on the Princeton campus as a freshman in the
fall of 1981 and made my way to Alexander Hall to hear
the president's welcome address. He began by informing
us that he had just returned from Flushing Meadow where
a classmate of ours had reached the women's quarterfi
nals of the U.S. Open tennis tournament.
I raised my hand, proudly, when he asked how many of
us were valedictorians of our high school class ... so did
about 600 others. I felt gratified I hadn't peaked too early!
Four years later, 1 had to choose among seven eco-

nomics doctoral programs, opted for Harvard over
Stanford (in a weak moment) but deferred it a year so I could attend the
London School of Economics and experience a different culture from the
Midwestern ethos I had known and loved. I even heard a foreign lan
guage when I traveled to Scotland (ever seen the monument to Adam
Smith in Edinburgh?).
Early in my doctoral program I began to teach the principles course (at
Harvard it's taught mostly in section by graduate students) and, using The
Boston Globe's editorial page as my guide, came to realize just how eco
nomically illiterate the public was.
Thus was born my passion for introducing students to the wonderful
world of economics. This role has taken me from the Harvard Westlake
School in Los Angeles, to Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn, where I taught
both principles and intermediate economics to juniors and seniors for
three years. (It was also there that I met my wife!) From Brooklyn, I went
on to Duke for six years where my wife completed her doctoral degree in
botany and genetics and where our daughter Zoe was born. Finally, I
made it to Stanford, where Penelope came eight days late so she could
provide me an excuse to miss the Econ 1 final last spring.
