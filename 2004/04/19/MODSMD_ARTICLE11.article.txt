# The 						(racial) dating game
## Interracial dating, racial dating hierarchies and all that fun stuff 
### MELANIE CORBETT 
What accounts for physical and
romantic attraction? This has for
ever been debated and perhaps
will never have a clear answer. Of
the many possible components of
amorous appeal, one that has re
cently been the focus of interest is
that of race. Changing dating
habits, with an increasing number
of interracial couples, has led to
questions of the significance of this
aspect of identity.
There is speculation about an
racial dating hierarchy. According
to Stanford's "Communicasians"
magazine, the percentage of gen
ders of different races who inter
racially marry indicates that such
a ladder would place African-
American men at the top, whites
in the middle and Asian-Ameri
cans at the bottom. The female
pecking order would have Asian-
American women at the top,
whites in the middle and African-
Americans below.
Because of the sensitive nature
of racial dating preferences, sev
eral people commented on deeper
underlying meanings than simply
physical attraction.
"I think that the reasons for
dating preferences are more cul
tural than racial," said a fresh
man who chose to remain anony
mous. "For example, if people
take pride in their race and they
find identity in their ethnic back
ground, they might appreciate
someone else who feels the same
way or identifies him or herself
similarly. Hence, it comes down
to more of a cultural difference
than a racial preference."
The concept of culture, op
posed to race, being the main at
traction to a person is shared by
several students.
"I think personal [dating]
preferences for the same race
arise from the ability to relate to
someone," said freshman Tony
Ortega. "It is often easy to relate
to someone of one's own culture
because of the social and cultur
al climate in which one was
raised, so one can often share
similar values, experiences and
likes and dislikes with a person
of the same race.
"As for people who have per
sonal preferences for different
races, I believe that it is just a de
sire to try something different,"
he continued. "Or, it is just out of
arbitrary personal preference,
which entails almost all of our
likes or dislikes."
Freshman Mickey Sheu stated
that his preference for people of
the same race was based on the
desire to connect culturally.
"I just don't relate well
enough culturally to non-Asians,

and maybe even non-Chinese,"
he said.
For those whose races do not
define them culturally, favoring
one race over another in relation
ships may not occur.
"I think that I do not have
personal racial dating prefer
ences because I do not have a
strong sense of 'racial identity'.
Race was never really an issue
where 1 came from," said fresh
man Gabe Recchia.
Family pressure can also play a
role in who one seeks fora partner.
"I think that one's family and
background will often influence
one's personal preferences, but
how big of a role those influences
play differs from person to per
son," said freshman Jessica Li.
"My parents are pretty tolerant
of any race when it comes to my
dating, but if they were given a
choice, they'd pick Asian, prefer
ably Chinese guys, which is un
derstandable.Ultimately,
though, it's my decision, and they
respect that."
According to some, this family
pressure can result from the hope
to preserve a culture's identity.
"Some may have a desire to
marry within their race in order
to continue the purity of that
race. I have many Asian friends
who feel some pressure to
marry within their'own race in
order to maintain their own cul
ture in America," said freshman
Reid Yokoyama.
Forms of racial dating prefer
ences that include being attract
ed to members of the same race
may result from socially perpetu

ated stereotypes.
"They could exist as a result of
being inundated by images of
same race dating in the media,"
said freshman Emily Gische.
Other stereotypes affecting
preferences include those that
assume that every member of a
particular race will be of the
same culture.
"I think that preferences re
sult partially from stereotypes â€”
certain qualities that people find
attractive and associate with cer
tain ethnicities," said a freshman
who chose to remain anonymous.
"I think that some people expect
certain things in their race and
that they will behave in some sort
of manner."
Assumptions such as rigidly
sticking to one's preferences can
mislead people about those they
think they are attracted to.
"I thought I had racial prefer
ences, but those thoughts were
shattered when I met wonderful
guys outside of the type to which I
was supposedly partial," said
freshman Caroline Hunter.
Others choose not to look at
the races of people at all.
"People are individuals and
they don't need to be classified
into groups," said a freshman who
chose to remain anonymous.
"When I date someone, I look at
her as an individual and not as a
member of a larger group."
An issue arising from racial
dating preferences is that a gender
of one race may be more likely to
marry outside of the race than the
other gender. For example, more
Asian-American women marry

outside of their race than Asian-
American men. For members of
the other gender that prefer to
date members of their own race,
this can pose a problem.
"Some of my Asian guy
friends are a bit frustrated when
Caucasians 'steal their girls,'"
said a freshman who chose to re
main anonymous.
"If something like that hap
pened to me, I might feel that my
market was being intruded upon,"
said freshman Caesar Rivera.
Some would be more accepting
of these "intrusions."
"It's unfair, but so is every
thing else when it comes to dat
ing; it's just something else to
pile on the heap of reasons why
dating life sucks," said freshman
Kevin Hilke.
Explanations for the lack of
mixing races in relationships of
the past include legal restric
tions. While Native Americans
and Hispanics have seldom been
barred by law from intermar
riage, African-Americans and
Asians have faced many limita
tions. Laws against intermar
riage between blacks and whites
were not declared illegal by the
Supreme Court until 1967.
Asian-white relations were also
restricted, although to a lesser
degree. In 1963, five states pro
hibited marriage between
Asians and whites, compared to
16 states banning that of blacks
and whites.
While the legal obstacles have
been eliminated, interracial dat
ing and dating hierarchies are still
topics of debate.

"When I date someone, I look at
her as an individual and not as a
member of a larger group."
An issue arising from racial
dating preferences is that a gender
of one race may be more likely to
marry outside of the race than the
other gender. For example, more
Asian-American women marry

outside of their race than Asian-
American men. For members of
the other gender that prefer to
date members of their own race,
this can pose a problem.
"Some of my Asian guy
friends are a bit frustrated when
Caucasians 'steal their girls,'"
said a freshman who chose to re
main anonymous.
"If something like that hap
pened to me, I might feel that my
market was being intruded upon,"
said freshman Caesar Rivera.
Some would be more accepting
of these "intrusions."
"It's unfair, but so is every
thing else when it comes to dat
ing; it's just something else to
pile on the heap of reasons why
dating life sucks," said freshman
Kevin Hilke.
Explanations for the lack of
mixing races in relationships of
the past include legal restric
tions. While Native Americans
and Hispanics have seldom been
barred by law from intermar
riage, African-Americans and
Asians have faced many limita
tions. Laws against intermar
riage between blacks and whites
were not declared illegal by the
Supreme Court until 1967.
Asian-white relations were also
restricted, although to a lesser
degree. In 1963, five states pro
hibited marriage between
Asians and whites, compared to
16 states banning that of blacks
and whites.
While the legal obstacles have
been eliminated, interracial dat
ing and dating hierarchies are still
topics of debate.

What accounts for physical and
romantic attraction? This has for
ever been debated and perhaps
will never have a clear answer. Of
the many possible components of
amorous appeal, one that has re
cently been the focus of interest is
that of race. Changing dating
habits, with an increasing number
of interracial couples, has led to
questions of the significance of this
aspect of identity.
There is speculation about an
racial dating hierarchy. According
to Stanford's "Communicasians"
magazine, the percentage of gen
ders of different races who inter
racially marry indicates that such
a ladder would place African-
American men at the top, whites
in the middle and Asian-Ameri
cans at the bottom. The female
pecking order would have Asian-
American women at the top,
whites in the middle and African-
Americans below.
Because of the sensitive nature
of racial dating preferences, sev
eral people commented on deeper
underlying meanings than simply
physical attraction.
"I think that the reasons for
dating preferences are more cul
tural than racial," said a fresh
man who chose to remain anony
mous. "For example, if people
take pride in their race and they
find identity in their ethnic back
ground, they might appreciate
someone else who feels the same
way or identifies him or herself
similarly. Hence, it comes down
to more of a cultural difference
than a racial preference."
The concept of culture, op
posed to race, being the main at
traction to a person is shared by
several students.
"I think personal [dating]
preferences for the same race
arise from the ability to relate to
someone," said freshman Tony
Ortega. "It is often easy to relate
to someone of one's own culture
because of the social and cultur
al climate in which one was
raised, so one can often share
similar values, experiences and
likes and dislikes with a person
of the same race.
"As for people who have per
sonal preferences for different
races, I believe that it is just a de
sire to try something different,"
he continued. "Or, it is just out of
arbitrary personal preference,
which entails almost all of our
likes or dislikes."
Freshman Mickey Sheu stated
that his preference for people of
the same race was based on the
desire to connect culturally.
"I just don't relate well
enough culturally to non-Asians,

and maybe even non-Chinese,"
he said.
For those whose races do not
define them culturally, favoring
one race over another in relation
ships may not occur.
"I think that I do not have
personal racial dating prefer
ences because I do not have a
strong sense of 'racial identity'.
Race was never really an issue
where 1 came from," said fresh
man Gabe Recchia.
Family pressure can also play a
role in who one seeks fora partner.
"I think that one's family and
background will often influence
one's personal preferences, but
how big of a role those influences
play differs from person to per
son," said freshman Jessica Li.
"My parents are pretty tolerant
of any race when it comes to my
dating, but if they were given a
choice, they'd pick Asian, prefer
ably Chinese guys, which is un
derstandable.Ultimately,
though, it's my decision, and they
respect that."
According to some, this family
pressure can result from the hope
to preserve a culture's identity.
"Some may have a desire to
marry within their race in order
to continue the purity of that
race. I have many Asian friends
who feel some pressure to
marry within their'own race in
order to maintain their own cul
ture in America," said freshman
Reid Yokoyama.
Forms of racial dating prefer
ences that include being attract
ed to members of the same race
may result from socially perpetu

ated stereotypes.
"They could exist as a result of
being inundated by images of
same race dating in the media,"
said freshman Emily Gische.
Other stereotypes affecting
preferences include those that
assume that every member of a
particular race will be of the
same culture.
"I think that preferences re
sult partially from stereotypes â€”
certain qualities that people find
attractive and associate with cer
tain ethnicities," said a freshman
who chose to remain anonymous.
"I think that some people expect
certain things in their race and
that they will behave in some sort
of manner."
Assumptions such as rigidly
sticking to one's preferences can
mislead people about those they
think they are attracted to.
"I thought I had racial prefer
ences, but those thoughts were
shattered when I met wonderful
guys outside of the type to which I
was supposedly partial," said
freshman Caroline Hunter.
Others choose not to look at
the races of people at all.
"People are individuals and
they don't need to be classified
into groups," said a freshman who
chose to remain anonymous.
"When I date someone, I look at
her as an individual and not as a
member of a larger group."
An issue arising from racial
