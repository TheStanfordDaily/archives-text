## A 						bureaucracy in need of reform 
### 
Last quarter, at an open-format meeting with
dozens of students, Provost John
Etchemendy likened Stanford's housing and
dining administration to a "bureaucracy."
The provost is right. Residential and Dining Enter
prises is an unwieldy and opaque organization that has
lost control of costs and avoids accountability. R&DE
needs to be reformed in order to cost-effectively meet
the needs of students.
Everything in the Bay Area is expensive, and it
makes sense that our housing and dining would cost
more than elsewhere. In addition, unionized labor —
which the student body expresses a strong preference
for — probably makes these services cost somewhat
more than students would expect. Yet R&DE admin
istrators often use this as an excuse to dismiss all criti
cism of their exorbitant costs, when in fact other issues
are at play.
Union or no union, paying more than $12 per meal
is rather steep for 10 cafeteria meals per week. Still,
Dining Services has come a long way under its new ex
ecutive director. Nadeem Siddiqui, and he has sub
stantially improved efficiency and quality despite the
bureaucracy of the system he inherited. It is the hous
ing side where costs seem the most out-of-line.
A 200-square-foot Row House double costs more
than $1,300 a month between the two residents. This
is incredibly high, and it seems even more expensive
when one notes that none of this money goes toward
paying for land or tuition: All of it pays for R&DE
administration, maintenance and capital. For com
parison, a room in the off-campus Sharon Green
Apartments costs less than half as much per square
foot per month. Such a massive difference indicates
that Stanford administrators could do more to keep
costs down.
Even more concerning than the high costs are
the steps R&DE administrators have taken to de
fend them. In 2002, the Dining Committee was
formed to give students input in Stanford Dining's
decision-making process. As it has turned out,
however, the committee has been unable to have
material input on any important decisions this year.
Senior administrators have undermined the com
mittee through questionable tactics, including pre

senting misleading information and delaying the
committee's meetings.
Although this is the time of the year when the most
important decisions for next year are being made, the
committee has only been called to convene once since
Feb. 24. And in earlier meetings, the financial analysts
of R&DE's dining arm produced several misleading
"price comparisons" that aimed to demonstrate that
their prices are less outlandish than they appear. Sev
eral of these comparisons overstated "competitor"
costs or understated Stanford dining costs. They had
errors of methodology and errors of fact, and some
may have even violated California advertising law. It
is one thing for dining to be expensive, but it is truly
disturbing when administrators deceive students in
defending the high costs.
Other aspects of the dining committee render it in
effective. One student on the committee last year
noted its "circus' Mike atmosphere, complete with "an
endless parade of middle managers." This may be an
overstatement, but the bottom line is that the dining
committee is neither allowed to see relevant financial
information nor have any decision-making power.
Moreover, there may be conflicts of interest, as two of
the student members have been employed by Stan
ford Dining.
Shirley Everett, associate vice provost for Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises, is responsible for the ac
tions of R&DE's massive administrative staff. As
such, she should be taking pains to address student
concerns and ensure that RD&E is responsive to
them. Instead, she has been slow to meet with ASSU
President Nadiya Figueroa and concerned members
of the Dining Committee and has done little to allevi
ate students' worries.
A change in attitude, and possibly personnel, may
be needed to reform R&DE. While an academic de
partment central to the core mission of the University
could never drift so far from the wishes of the provost,
the reduced oversight over what the University calls
its "auxiliary units" has permitted R&DE to evolve
into a self-sustaining bureaucracy. We hope that top
Stanford administrators take steps in the coming
months to bring R&DE more in line with the interests
of students and the University as a whole.

is rather steep for 10 cafeteria meals per week. Still,
Dining Services has come a long way under its new ex
ecutive director. Nadeem Siddiqui, and he has sub
stantially improved efficiency and quality despite the
bureaucracy of the system he inherited. It is the hous
ing side where costs seem the most out-of-line.
A 200-square-foot Row House double costs more
than $1,300 a month between the two residents. This
is incredibly high, and it seems even more expensive
when one notes that none of this money goes toward
paying for land or tuition: All of it pays for R&DE
administration, maintenance and capital. For com
parison, a room in the off-campus Sharon Green
Apartments costs less than half as much per square
foot per month. Such a massive difference indicates
that Stanford administrators could do more to keep
costs down.
Even more concerning than the high costs are
the steps R&DE administrators have taken to de
fend them. In 2002, the Dining Committee was
formed to give students input in Stanford Dining's
decision-making process. As it has turned out,
however, the committee has been unable to have
material input on any important decisions this year.
Senior administrators have undermined the com
mittee through questionable tactics, including pre

senting misleading information and delaying the
committee's meetings.
Although this is the time of the year when the most
important decisions for next year are being made, the
committee has only been called to convene once since
Feb. 24. And in earlier meetings, the financial analysts
of R&DE's dining arm produced several misleading
"price comparisons" that aimed to demonstrate that
their prices are less outlandish than they appear. Sev
eral of these comparisons overstated "competitor"
costs or understated Stanford dining costs. They had
errors of methodology and errors of fact, and some
may have even violated California advertising law. It
is one thing for dining to be expensive, but it is truly
disturbing when administrators deceive students in
defending the high costs.
Other aspects of the dining committee render it in
effective. One student on the committee last year
noted its "circus' Mike atmosphere, complete with "an
endless parade of middle managers." This may be an
overstatement, but the bottom line is that the dining
committee is neither allowed to see relevant financial
information nor have any decision-making power.
Moreover, there may be conflicts of interest, as two of
the student members have been employed by Stan
ford Dining.
Shirley Everett, associate vice provost for Residen
tial and Dining Enterprises, is responsible for the ac
tions of R&DE's massive administrative staff. As
such, she should be taking pains to address student
concerns and ensure that RD&E is responsive to
them. Instead, she has been slow to meet with ASSU
President Nadiya Figueroa and concerned members
of the Dining Committee and has done little to allevi
ate students' worries.
A change in attitude, and possibly personnel, may
be needed to reform R&DE. While an academic de
partment central to the core mission of the University
could never drift so far from the wishes of the provost,
the reduced oversight over what the University calls
its "auxiliary units" has permitted R&DE to evolve
into a self-sustaining bureaucracy. We hope that top
Stanford administrators take steps in the coming
months to bring R&DE more in line with the interests
of students and the University as a whole.
