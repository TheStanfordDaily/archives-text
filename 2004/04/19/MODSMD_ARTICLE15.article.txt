## Spelling beasts 
### 
You haven't lived until
you've seen the sweaty,
quivering palms of a 10-
year old fidget back and
forth in bewilderment upon hearing
the word "unciferous."
Damn it, now there's a red squiggly
line on my screen because Microsoft
Word doesn't have "unciferous" in its
spell-check. If you Google it, it only
gets 32 hits. My dad has more Google
hits than that. I don't even know what
unciferous means, and I guess I never
will, because it's not in the online Ox
ford English Dictionary.
That's why unciferous scares me;
any supposed word that isn't in the
O.E.D. really curls my toes. But yes
terday, the 10-year-olds not only had
to face the existence of this "word,"
they had to try to spell it. That's scari
er than mom's Brussels sprouts.
Unbeknownst toyouall.Tresidder
Union was invaded yesterday at 9:30
a.m. by a horde of Indian American
amateur spellers. Ranging from ages
nine to 12, these vocabularathletes
marched into the Cypress Room with
game faces that would make Chris
Moneymaker jealous. There's noth
ing more startling than a cocky fourth
grader staring you down with a look
that says, "Sure, you go to Stanford -
but I read the dictionary every night
before I go to bed."
In part because I wanted to get in
touch with my Indian side, and in part
because I had a relentless desire to wake
up at 8 a.m. on Sunday morning, I vol
unteered to be the "pronouncer" at this
spelling bee. Though I didn't partake in
competitive oral spelling as a youth, I
cockily thought that completing high
school would qualify me to read words
to children less than half my age.
Au contraire (language of origin:
French). Although the majority of kids
were just good-natured tykes with a
knack for the English language, fora
few of these contestants (and their par
ents) the rest of life was apparently just
a day job. Let me set the scene for you:
It's 9:45 a.m. The Tresidder lounge
buzzes with a nervous milling. Mini
spellers slowly file into the competition
room, some listlessly looking at the ceil
ing while two or three are confidently

drilling themselves on a list of hot-but
ton words. The audience, comprised of
sane adults but also a nontrivial number
of psycho-parents — the kind David
Brooks loves to write about in the At
lantic Monthly — start to peer at me,

knowing that I hold
their children's fu
ture in the list of
words in my hands.
By 10:15 it's
easy to tell who
came to play hard
ball. The recre
ational spellers
were generally
good-natured and
didn't seem too

upset when I'd give them "nihilism"
and they'd give me "N-A-Y-A-L-E-I-
S-I-M." My heart bled for the wee
ones who had to spell "irascible" after
the cocky 12-year-old before them got
"understudy."
Then there were the budding stars
of tomorrow, the ones who hadn't
quite put it all together yet, but you
could tell the gears were churning.
Take "Montessorian" - "M-O-U-N-T-
E-S-A-U-R-I-A-N." Granted, the
word isn't an adjective describing di
nosaurs that live on mountains, but I
certainly wouldn't be clever enough to
come up with a spelling like that. I see
only bright prospects for their future.
But then there were the bailers (or
at least the wannabe bailers). One
rather precocious speller, under the
intensely invested eye of his father,
bounded up to the pronouncer's desk
during round one. He had the pre
pubescent swagger of the football
quarterback at a Senior High School
dance. The words were his cheerlead
ers, and he wanted to make out be
hind the gym. "Watercress W-A-T-E-
R-C-R-E-S-S Watercress." He didn't
need the definition. He didn't want
me to use it in a sentence. Those were
stall tactics used only by paeons. With
a smug grin he turned on his heel.
That's when I knew it was on.
Round two comes and his father is
staring me down. I'm beginning to
sweat, because Mr. Spellity Mc-
Spellerstein is coming up to the plate
and I have no idea how to pronounce

the word laloplegic. (Laloplegic has a
grand total of zero Google hits, but I
swear it was on this list).
Now my palms are sweaty and
quivering, because if I mess up, psy
cho-dad is going to run outside and
appeal the entire spelling bee on ac
count of the pronouncer's idiocy. The
phonetic spelling, which had an inco
herent combination of upside-down
backwards Es and umlauted As, was
of little help, but by the extraordinary
grace of God, the kid nailed it. Near
disaster was averted.
Round three was when the
gauntlets were thrown.
Our spelling prodigy returns and
receives the word "relentlessly." He
breathes a sigh of relief and curls his
face into a "that's the best you can
do?" smirk. Clearly he has not seen
American Pie, or he would have
known to follow the advice of Coach
Marshall: "I don't want any of you
boys thinking that you're gonna score.
You don't score, until you score [until
you SCORE!]."
Without a moment's thought, he
digs in: "R-E-N.. er ..R-E-L-E-N-T-L-
E-S-S-L-Y." But it was too late; after
the misplaced N, the damage was done
and his star had fallen. The father's
neck turned limp in disapproval.
After leaving the spelling bee
knowing that I had made one kid's
day and to varying degrees ruined the
days of 24 other children, I was left to
wonder, "Why, man?"
And frankly, 1 don't know. I can
think of absolutely no pedagogical
value of drilling kids with words they
can't even define. As a final example,
take the word toxophilite. I'd say half
of the elementary schoolers spelled
this word right. I have never heard
that word in my life. Apparently it has
to do with archery.
My advice to parents? Spare your
10-year olds the agony of having to
spell obscure words that the Internet
doesn't recognize, and buy them a
cookie instead.
