Stanford should not
prohibit unpaid TAs
Regarding the Daily editorial
board's opinion that "All TA's
Should be Paid," I couldn't agree
more. As an undergraduate teaching
assistant last quarter, I would love to
have been paid. Perhaps The Daily
could start a collection for me. a typi
cal "exploited" TA.
The Daily's article advances more
than a sentiment, however: It de
mands that all TAs must be paid, and
therefore that no one can be a TA who
is not paid. To this I strongly object.
The fact that professors are willing
to employ qualified but unpaid TAs
suggests that graduate TAs are actu
ally being paid above-market wages
— which should surprise no one,
given that TA salaries are one of the
largest sources of financial aid for
graduate students.
So long as unpaid TAs do not com
pete with graduate students for TA
jobs, I find it difficult to understand
what possible harm comes from allow
ing undergraduates to volunteer their
time in return for what is truly a mem

orable and rewarding experience —
unless, of course, the Daily staff be
lieves that I am incompetent to make
my own academic and career decisions.
Thus, while I appreciate the
Daily's concern, I would prefer that
they channel their moral outrage into
figuring out how extra money a de
partment has available for TAs that
they would be willing to pay us (pre
sumably, and properly, less than the
full financial aid salary of graduate
students). If they merely cause Stan
ford to prohibit professors from ex
tending opportunities to undergradu
ates, then I have to admit that I would
feel far more "exploited" by The
Daily as a political tool than by a pro
fessor and friend of mine who entrust
ed me with helping to teach his class.

Anti-evolution lecture
an affront to scholarship
I attended an on-campus presenta
tion by Ralph Muncaster on "Cre
ationism vs. Evolution" last Thursday.
As expected, the lecture used faulty

logic and leaps of faith to "prove that
evolution is flat-out impossible" — an
actual quote from the lecture — and
offered creationism, or intelligent de
sign theory, as the only alternative.
The lecture was an affront to the high
level of scholarship that exists on this
campus. 1 am appalled at the Stanford
community for allowing such an event
to take place.
Opportunities to give presenta
tions on college campuses lend unmer
ited credence to the ideas of people
like Muncaster. They of course will
readily seize such opportunities. I am
surprised that no fewer than four
groups within the Stanford Associated
Religions — Campus Crusade, Cardi
nal Life, Cornerstone and Table Talk
— put their name down as sponsors of
the lecture. I would imagine that a
large part of the religious community
at Stanford is as much opposed to un
critical lectures of this kind as I am.
We cannot prohibit anyone from
inviting the next self-professed de
fender of the truth to this campus.
However, we can make people like
Muncaster understand that we as
Stanford students will approach their

teachings very critically and that we
will defend science and rational in
quiry against these fraudulent attacks.
Next time, let us overwhelm the
lecture hall with dissenters. Let us
dominate the question-and-answer
session, let us hand out material ex
amining the real issues behind the lec
ture, let us put on a dissenters' tailgate
party outside the auditorium. Above
all, let us give the attendees a scientif
ically valid, intelligent alternative to
what they're about to hear.

MEChA should be replaced
The Stanford Review published a
series of articles earlier in the year ex
posing the racist ideology found with
in the Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan's Philosophy of
MEChA, recently revised in 1999, and
the movement's founding documents.
El Plan Espiritual de Santa Barbara
and El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan.
Despite The Review's numerous
calls for Stanford MEChA to renounce
these documents and its affiliation with

National MEChA as established
through the National Constitution,
Stanford MEChA failed to answer.
Hie Stanford student body responded
by denying the group's special fee re
quest of over $35,000, thereby sending
a clear message that Stanford would no
longer tolerate racism of any form.
The Review warned that a failure
on behalf of Stanford MEChA to re
pudiate its racist foundations might
adversely affect the non-racist cultur
al groups that depend on MEChA for
funding. Unfortunately for these
groups, of which El Ballet Folklorico
is but one example, that warning
proved valid.
Nevertheless, Stanford MEChA
still stands to receive $10,000 from
University departments and pro
grams, $5,000 from University admin
istration, $15,000 from El Centro Chi
cano, $5,000 from dormitories, $S,(XX)
from the ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
$3,000 from the ASSU Publications
Board, $3,000 from the Haas Center,
and $8,000 from the Stanford Fund, in
addition to outside donations and
other sources of funding. Stanford
MEChA will therefore still receive

over $67,(XX) this year.
We believe it is time for the Latino /
Chicano / Hispanic community at
Stanford to restructure the way funds
are distributed to its cultural groups.
The student body has sent a message
that it will no longer tolerate the racism
that continues to plague MEChA. A
new Latino / Chicano / Hispanic orga
nization should be formed, free from
any connection to MEChA, to which
the University can filter those funds
currently devoted to MEChA.
Such an organization would be
able to appeal to the student body for
special fees without the taint of being
associated with MEChA, giving stu
dents an opportunity to choose
whether or not to fund the new VSO
based solely upon the merits of its pro
grams. One thing, at least, is clear. The
student body has taken a much-need
ed step towards bringing an end to
racism at Stanford University.

have been paid. Perhaps The Daily
could start a collection for me. a typi
cal "exploited" TA.
The Daily's article advances more
than a sentiment, however: It de
mands that all TAs must be paid, and
therefore that no one can be a TA who
is not paid. To this I strongly object.
The fact that professors are willing
to employ qualified but unpaid TAs
suggests that graduate TAs are actu
ally being paid above-market wages
— which should surprise no one,
given that TA salaries are one of the
largest sources of financial aid for
graduate students.
So long as unpaid TAs do not com
pete with graduate students for TA
jobs, I find it difficult to understand
what possible harm comes from allow
ing undergraduates to volunteer their
time in return for what is truly a mem

orable and rewarding experience —
unless, of course, the Daily staff be
lieves that I am incompetent to make
my own academic and career decisions.
Thus, while I appreciate the
Daily's concern, I would prefer that
they channel their moral outrage into
figuring out how extra money a de
partment has available for TAs that
they would be willing to pay us (pre
sumably, and properly, less than the
full financial aid salary of graduate
students). If they merely cause Stan
ford to prohibit professors from ex
tending opportunities to undergradu
ates, then I have to admit that I would
feel far more "exploited" by The
Daily as a political tool than by a pro
fessor and friend of mine who entrust
ed me with helping to teach his class.

Anti-evolution lecture
an affront to scholarship
I attended an on-campus presenta
tion by Ralph Muncaster on "Cre
ationism vs. Evolution" last Thursday.
As expected, the lecture used faulty

logic and leaps of faith to "prove that
evolution is flat-out impossible" — an
actual quote from the lecture — and
offered creationism, or intelligent de
sign theory, as the only alternative.
The lecture was an affront to the high
level of scholarship that exists on this
campus. 1 am appalled at the Stanford
community for allowing such an event
to take place.
Opportunities to give presenta
tions on college campuses lend unmer
ited credence to the ideas of people
like Muncaster. They of course will
readily seize such opportunities. I am
surprised that no fewer than four
groups within the Stanford Associated
Religions — Campus Crusade, Cardi
nal Life, Cornerstone and Table Talk
— put their name down as sponsors of
the lecture. I would imagine that a
large part of the religious community
at Stanford is as much opposed to un
critical lectures of this kind as I am.
We cannot prohibit anyone from
inviting the next self-professed de
fender of the truth to this campus.
However, we can make people like
Muncaster understand that we as
Stanford students will approach their

teachings very critically and that we
will defend science and rational in
quiry against these fraudulent attacks.
Next time, let us overwhelm the
lecture hall with dissenters. Let us
dominate the question-and-answer
session, let us hand out material ex
amining the real issues behind the lec
ture, let us put on a dissenters' tailgate
party outside the auditorium. Above
all, let us give the attendees a scientif
ically valid, intelligent alternative to
what they're about to hear.

MEChA should be replaced
The Stanford Review published a
series of articles earlier in the year ex
posing the racist ideology found with
in the Movimiento Estudiantil Chi
cano de Aztlan's Philosophy of
MEChA, recently revised in 1999, and
the movement's founding documents.
El Plan Espiritual de Santa Barbara
and El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan.
Despite The Review's numerous
calls for Stanford MEChA to renounce
these documents and its affiliation with

National MEChA as established
through the National Constitution,
Stanford MEChA failed to answer.
Hie Stanford student body responded
by denying the group's special fee re
quest of over $35,000, thereby sending
a clear message that Stanford would no
longer tolerate racism of any form.
The Review warned that a failure
on behalf of Stanford MEChA to re
pudiate its racist foundations might
adversely affect the non-racist cultur
al groups that depend on MEChA for
funding. Unfortunately for these
groups, of which El Ballet Folklorico
is but one example, that warning
proved valid.
Nevertheless, Stanford MEChA
still stands to receive $10,000 from
University departments and pro
grams, $5,000 from University admin
istration, $15,000 from El Centro Chi
cano, $5,000 from dormitories, $S,(XX)
from the ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
$3,000 from the ASSU Publications
Board, $3,000 from the Haas Center,
and $8,000 from the Stanford Fund, in
addition to outside donations and
other sources of funding. Stanford
MEChA will therefore still receive

over $67,(XX) this year.
We believe it is time for the Latino /
Chicano / Hispanic community at
Stanford to restructure the way funds
are distributed to its cultural groups.
The student body has sent a message
that it will no longer tolerate the racism
that continues to plague MEChA. A
new Latino / Chicano / Hispanic orga
nization should be formed, free from
any connection to MEChA, to which
the University can filter those funds
currently devoted to MEChA.
Such an organization would be
able to appeal to the student body for
special fees without the taint of being
associated with MEChA, giving stu
dents an opportunity to choose
whether or not to fund the new VSO
based solely upon the merits of its pro
grams. One thing, at least, is clear. The
student body has taken a much-need
ed step towards bringing an end to
racism at Stanford University.
