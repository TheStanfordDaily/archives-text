# HOLT'S HARANGUE
## How to make sure the admits choose Stanford 
### 
With admit weekend looming on
the horizon, I've been thinking
of some creative ways to capture
the attention of the Class of
2008. Most would think that being nice to the
prospective freshmen and showing them all
that Stanford has to offer would be the best
plan. But those kind of sissy tactics are not
enough to really guarantee that the ProFros
will come. So, from the department of really
bad ideas, here are a few suggestions to make
"Admit Weekend" extra special.
Idea number one: Ignore them.
Groucho Marx once said: "I don't want to
belong to any club that will accept me as a
member." Likewise, perhaps admits will be
turned off if we are friendly and personable to
them. Maybe being icy, distant and aloof will
make them want to come here. If it seems like
we don't care, they'll be all the more interested.
They will think we are mysterious, above them.

It seems to work for the all women I have
crushes on, anyway.
Idea number two: Mess up the name tags.
Wouldn't it be fun to change around their

name tags, or your own, during
admit weekend? Wouldn't you,
as a Pro Fro, be more likely to
stay at a school that has a name
tag labeled as "The Exalted
One" waiting for you? Con
versely, wouldn't it be fun, as a
practical joke, to have their label
read "Mistakenly Admitted"?
I'd laugh. If they can laugh too,

they should come here. But if they cry, well,
maybe the tag is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Or, we could always replace their names
with their SAT scores. I know, that kind of so
cial hierarchy takes time to form at Stanford.
But we should prepare them now for what they
will experience later. I know all my best friends

have scores within a 30-point range of my own;
it's just the Stanford way. Names are unneces
sary. Let's just be practical and identify the
ProFros based on something that shows their
true worth. All social attachments, like every
thing in life, are based on numbers. We should
instill this in them early on.
Idea number three: Captive interrogation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological
condition in which captives fall in love with
their captors. I'm just throwing that out there
— do what you want with that information. I
mean, I'm not promoting you hold your
ProFros captive. But if your ProFros fall in love
with you, they won't leave, now will they?
Stanford won't sell itself, after all. The
beautiful campus, stellar academics, state of
the art facilities, nine Director's Cups and
friendly students aren't going to turn anyone's
heads. We have to rethink our strategy, and vi
olating the Geneva Convention may be the

only way. Locking a Pro Fro in your room and
engaging in "questionable" practices of inter
rogation may be all that's left. If you make
them sit in your room, throw a spotlight on
them, dress them like up like the Green
Lantern and force them to watch the "Wel
come to Stanford" video on repeat... I had
nothing to do with it.
Idea number four: Eliminate sleep.
Many people complain of Admit Weekend
being too action-packed. From the lectures to
the musical presentations to the dorm activi
ties, ProFros get awfully tired. Some claim it is
almost impossible for them to get a sense of
Stanford, because they never actually get any
free time to look around. Those red folders are
like chains, binding them to the arduous sched
ule of Admit Weekend.
Rather than easing their schedule, I think
we should make it more hectic. Admit Week
end barely touches on all the stuff Stanford has

to offer, and half of the events you don't see
again during your college career because you
are so busy. There is no rest here at Stanford.
So, we must prepare them. Make them pull
an all-nighter. Make them see all that Stanford
has to offer, and then give them some home
work, too. Tell them if they can't remember the
names of the hundreds of people they meet,
their admission will be revoked. This, truly, will
better prepare them for life at Stanford. After
all, admit weekend is a walk in the park com
pared to real life on The Farm.
If my ideas seem zealous and crazed, it's
only because I want to make sure we get all the
prospective freshman we can. Because, all
jokes aside, this place rocks.

mail Chris at cholt@stanford.edu to talk some
sanity into him, and e-mail the administration to
get his Pro Fro reassigned.

ule of Admit Weekend.
Rather than easing their schedule, I think
we should make it more hectic. Admit Week
end barely touches on all the stuff Stanford has

to offer, and half of the events you don't see
again during your college career because you
are so busy. There is no rest here at Stanford.
So, we must prepare them. Make them pull
an all-nighter. Make them see all that Stanford
has to offer, and then give them some home
work, too. Tell them if they can't remember the
names of the hundreds of people they meet,
their admission will be revoked. This, truly, will
better prepare them for life at Stanford. After
all, admit weekend is a walk in the park com
pared to real life on The Farm.
If my ideas seem zealous and crazed, it's
only because I want to make sure we get all the
prospective freshman we can. Because, all
jokes aside, this place rocks.

With admit weekend looming on
the horizon, I've been thinking
of some creative ways to capture
the attention of the Class of
2008. Most would think that being nice to the
prospective freshmen and showing them all
that Stanford has to offer would be the best
plan. But those kind of sissy tactics are not
enough to really guarantee that the ProFros
will come. So, from the department of really
bad ideas, here are a few suggestions to make
"Admit Weekend" extra special.
Idea number one: Ignore them.
Groucho Marx once said: "I don't want to
belong to any club that will accept me as a
member." Likewise, perhaps admits will be
turned off if we are friendly and personable to
them. Maybe being icy, distant and aloof will
make them want to come here. If it seems like
we don't care, they'll be all the more interested.
They will think we are mysterious, above them.

It seems to work for the all women I have
crushes on, anyway.
Idea number two: Mess up the name tags.
Wouldn't it be fun to change around their

name tags, or your own, during
admit weekend? Wouldn't you,
as a Pro Fro, be more likely to
stay at a school that has a name
tag labeled as "The Exalted
One" waiting for you? Con
versely, wouldn't it be fun, as a
practical joke, to have their label
read "Mistakenly Admitted"?
I'd laugh. If they can laugh too,

they should come here. But if they cry, well,
maybe the tag is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Or, we could always replace their names
with their SAT scores. I know, that kind of so
cial hierarchy takes time to form at Stanford.
But we should prepare them now for what they
will experience later. I know all my best friends

have scores within a 30-point range of my own;
it's just the Stanford way. Names are unneces
sary. Let's just be practical and identify the
ProFros based on something that shows their
true worth. All social attachments, like every
thing in life, are based on numbers. We should
instill this in them early on.
Idea number three: Captive interrogation.
Stockholm Syndrome is a psychological
condition in which captives fall in love with
their captors. I'm just throwing that out there
— do what you want with that information. I
mean, I'm not promoting you hold your
ProFros captive. But if your ProFros fall in love
with you, they won't leave, now will they?
Stanford won't sell itself, after all. The
beautiful campus, stellar academics, state of
the art facilities, nine Director's Cups and
friendly students aren't going to turn anyone's
heads. We have to rethink our strategy, and vi
olating the Geneva Convention may be the

only way. Locking a Pro Fro in your room and
engaging in "questionable" practices of inter
rogation may be all that's left. If you make
them sit in your room, throw a spotlight on
them, dress them like up like the Green
Lantern and force them to watch the "Wel
come to Stanford" video on repeat... I had
nothing to do with it.
Idea number four: Eliminate sleep.
Many people complain of Admit Weekend
being too action-packed. From the lectures to
the musical presentations to the dorm activi
ties, ProFros get awfully tired. Some claim it is
almost impossible for them to get a sense of
Stanford, because they never actually get any
free time to look around. Those red folders are
like chains, binding them to the arduous sched
ule of Admit Weekend.

we should make it more hectic. Admit Week
