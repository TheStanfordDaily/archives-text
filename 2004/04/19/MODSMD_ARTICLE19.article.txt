## The
						NBA Playoffs: a long road ahead 
### 
Playoff season is here again in the NBA. And it real
ly is a season, the league will take upward of two
months to crown its champion. When I was
younger, and the Bulls were a competitive team, I
enjoyed this, because I got to watch two months of high-cal
iber basketball. But now, in a year when it seems like a ques
tion of who will screw up the least and back into an NBA
title, these two months are going to be quite the grind.
Even my favorite current NBA rivalry, Lakers-Kings,
has fallen on hard times. Will these teams even live to see
each other in the playoffs? These are two teams that came
limping to the finish line (although both are up in their first
round series).
Still, Sacramento hasn't played winning ball in a couple
of months, and the return of Chris Webber has, once again,
somehow managed to make the Kings worse. Their ball
movement and defense have suffered, and while I suppose
a 6-foot-10 guy shooting face-up jumpers is a nice thing to
have, isn't that what Peja Stojakovic is for? Webber needs
to stay inside.
And speaking of inside, the Lakers have once again
failed to properly use the most dangerous weapon in bas
ketball. They won their first game precisely because the
stars aligned and Shaquille O'Neal got the ball when it mat
tered. Wait, no, he got the ball because Kobe Bryant missed
a long three out of a double team. Still — offensive board,
dunk, foul, ballgame.

Ah, the misunderstood big man. Is
there anything more depressing than
watching Yao Ming and Shaq face off?
They should be posting each other up,
possession after possession. Instead,
Kobe Bryant takes his 20 shots and Phil
Jackson's assortment of garbage players
all get a few shots per game as well, leav
ing Shaq with leftovers. He averaged 14
shots per game this year. Why isn't the
most dominant post player in the league

getting 20-plus shots per game? Kobe shot 21 percent in
Game One and still insisted on taking more shots than
O'Neal. What a joke.
At least Shaq plays with a real point guard (or at least the
shadow of one) in Gary Payton. Yao has to play with Steve
Francis and, as a result, averaged just 12.5 shots per game
this year. Stevie Franchise (losing franchise, anyway) aver
aged 14 shots and yet was still outscored by Yao by a point
and a half. Talk about someone who just doesn't get it; no
wonder Van Gundy feuds with the guy. How do you play
with a 7-foot-6 monster with more touch than any other cen
ter in the league and not give him the ball more often?
He's also probably the best-passing big man this side of
Vlade Divac, and the Rockets' assortment of selfish guards
refuse to run the offense through him. How does a man with
Yao's passing skills average only 1.5 assists per game?
That's fewer assists than Greg Ostertag. Heck, 1 could end
this column right there.
I realize that great guard play makes for all the highlights,
makes for most of the spectacular winning shots and sets the
tempo for the game. But watching Kobe and Payton play
their way around the triangle offense and Francis play like
he's on the And One streetball tour just saps my will to live.
That's why I'd like to see the Kings do well. They have a
real point guard in Mike Bibby, and they used to be known
fora spectacularly well-executed offense. Their bigs, Divac
and Brad Miller, are quality, and Webber, for all his inexpli
cable qualities, does remain tall and talented. It should prove
interesting to see if they can get it together in time to make a
run (hopefully leading to a Kings-Lakers showdown).
More than anything, this postseason setup is about
the failure of the Lakers. Coming into this season I heard
far too much talk about 73 wins, about a romp to the
championship. Unfortunately, Los Angeles doesn't
have Jerry Krause and Phil Jackson doesn't have his
kind of players. Malone, Payton, Bryant and O'Neal,
and that gets you fewer wins than a team that starts
Trenton Hassell? Kevin Garnett and Sam Cassell are
bailers, sure, but L. A. should be flat-out ashamed for the
way they blew this regular season. They had no business
coming in behind Minnesota.
Even should the Lakers win the title, I think basketball
in general is not well served by having its flagship team
struggle so often in the regular season. The great teams of
yore won from wire to wire; the Jackson Lakers like to pout
and pussyfoot around until April and then go on a Finals
run seemingly out of spite for the world.
There's only one reason that I'm not going to pick the
San Antonio Spurs to win the title despite being half as tal
ented as the Lakers. It's because the Lakers do have the best
offensive big man in the game, and it's not out of the realm
of possibility for them to properly use him.
I think the Spurs deserve a great deal of praise, however.
They've won two titles with a mediocre roster, all because
they do the most fundamental things that somehow escape
other teams. They throw the ball to their big man over and
over again, they play lockdown defense and their guards
know their role.
There are very few teams that could put a 40-year-old
Steve Kerr on the court and have that help their cause, but
your NBA champion Spurs, with their excellent inside-out
game, were probably the only team in last year's playoffs
running an offense capable of turning an aged one-dimen
sional player into the hero, just like he was on the NBA
champion Bulls. Kerr didn't do anything early in his career
in Orlando, and was a dead weight in Portland, which I think
underscores the fact that a team that properly uses its bigs
elevates its guard play — while a team that doesn't puts
undue pressure on its backcourt.
I realize the Eastern Conference is largely cursory, but In
diana and Detroit will both go as far as the play of Jermaine
O'Neal and Rasheed Wallace take them. The series to watch
will be the probable Nets-Pistons duel in round two, in which
Jason Kidd will try to rally New Jersey despite a huge disad
vantage in the paint. I think it will come down to 'Sheed. If he
bothers to post up some of the time, the Pistons ought to be
able to spring the upset; but if he sticks to the face-up game,
the Nets could screw up my whole big-man theory.
So maybe I spoke too soon. These playoffs will at least be
interesting, because no one has any idea who will win it all.
That, at least, makes for some excitement, even if we have
to watch some brutal basketball along the way.
