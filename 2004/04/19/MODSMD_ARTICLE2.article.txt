Designed to both celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and analyze
the decision's legacy, last week's symposium hosted at Stanford presented panel discussions and
showcased the varied opinions of legal scholars.
Considered one of the most consequential decisions ever handed down by the United States
Supreme Court, Brown v. Board was intended to prohibit segregation in public schools. Today,

Linda Darling-Hammond, associate law Prof. William Koski and Associate Vice Provost Sally
Dickson voiced their opinions on the case's long-term influence as well as what it meant for
them on a personal level.
"My love affair with Brown started at an early age," Alexander said. "Our nation is still
gripped by a romantic notion of the decision, but in many ways its influence has been under
stated and misunderstood."
Alexander added that 50 years is a very short time historically speaking, but that it can be
successfully argued that the Brown decision has failed from the perspective of educational
equity. Public school systems fail to provide adequate opportunities to 80 to 90 percent of
students of color, she said.
"If you ask whether Brown was extremely valuable for the cause of racial advancement, I
