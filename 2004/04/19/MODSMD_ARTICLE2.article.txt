# Symposium celebrates 50th anniversary of Brown case

Designed to both celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education and analyze
the decision's legacy, last week's symposium hosted at Stanford presented panel discussions and
showcased the varied opinions of legal scholars.
Considered one of the most consequential decisions ever handed down by the United States
Supreme Court, Brown v. Board was intended to prohibit segregation in public schools. Today,
legal analysts and academics continue to question the decision's success.
Organized by Stanford's Program in American Studies, the symposium opened with a keynote
lecture by legal scholar and activist Derrick Bell Jr., who played a prominent role in southern
school segregation cases in the l%os. He became the first tenured black professor at Harvard Uni
versity in 1971. He left in 1992 to demonstrate against the dearth of female faculty members of
color. He is currently a visiting professor at New York University Law School.
The first of the discussion panels, titled "Brown v. Board of Education and the Unfulfilled
Hopes for Racial Reform," featured University of Michigan law Prof. James Jackson, University
of Southern California Prof. Mary Dudziak, Stanford Vice Provost LaDoris Cordell and Daryl
Michael Scott, assistant professor of history at Columbia University.
While the first panel dissected the shortcomings and pitfalls of the landmark court decision,
the second, titled "The Promise of Brown," examined the more profound impact the case may
have had on the greater civil rights movement and even current affirmative action disputes.
During the second panel, Stanford associate law Prof. Michelle Alexander, education Prof.
Linda Darling-Hammond, associate law Prof. William Koski and Associate Vice Provost Sally
Dickson voiced their opinions on the case's long-term influence as well as what it meant for
them on a personal level.
"My love affair with Brown started at an early age," Alexander said. "Our nation is still
gripped by a romantic notion of the decision, but in many ways its influence has been under
stated and misunderstood."
Alexander added that 50 years is a very short time historically speaking, but that it can be
successfully argued that the Brown decision has failed from the perspective of educational
equity. Public school systems fail to provide adequate opportunities to 80 to 90 percent of
students of color, she said.
"If you ask whether Brown was extremely valuable for the cause of racial advancement, I
would say yes," Alexander said, adding
that many believe the civil rights move
ment might never have succeeded without
the precedent set by Brown that separate is
inherently unequal.
According to Alexander, the activisits
and students participating in protests and
sit-ins were battling for the legal principle
established by Brown.
"There would have been no legal founda
tion for any argument to sit at the front of a
bus or at the same lunch counters," she said.
"The precedent of Brown is extremely impor
tant. Without it, it's quite possible the civil
rights movement may never have occurred."
Alexander argued that contemporary
civil rights groups depend too heavily on im
pact litigation to effect social change and
that more attention needs to be devoted to
public advocacy efforts. This reliance on law
may have been an unintentional byproduct
of the Brown decision, she said.
"Rarely do lawyers think about what will

happen after a case is won," she said.
"There's a series of wins in courts only to
produce decisions that fail in the court of
public opinion. More work needs to be done
in the streets."
Alexander gave the recent affirmative
action cases as an example of the overuse of
legal strategies, claiming that only three per
cent of colored people actually benefit from
affirmative action policies, yet these court
battles have dominated the goals of many
civil rights organizations.
Following Alexander, Koski argued that
recently too much money and energy is
spent on making schools simply adequate
rather than equal. He highlighted standard
ized testing and school accountability as two
policies that distract away from the question
of educational equity.
Koski said that policy makers would ben
efit from reacquainting themselves with the
language of the Brown decisions, especially
with so many schools across the nation that
remain unofficially segregated. Throughout
the country there are schools that serve
black. Latino and Asian American students,
which don't receive the same funding and
resources as predominantly white schools.
Darling-Hammond, who referred to
these type of schools as "apartheid

schools," centered her comments on the
poor and sometimes devastating conditions
many students face navigating public
school systems, even in the most progres
sive states. She called attention to the
widening achievement gap, which has be
come even more defined since 1990. Grad
uation rates for minorities have also been
on the decline since 1995. Many schools
serving mostly students of color often don't
even offer the classes necessary to be ac
cepted to college, she said.
According to Darling-Hammond, the
class action suit Williams et al. v. State of
California — heard in the Superior Court
of San Francisco — brought many disturb
ing facts about the state of public schools
to light. The plaintiffs submitted griev
ances detailing the deplorable environ
ments provided by several schools in dif
ferent districts.
According the case, one San Francisco
high school serving minority students did
not provide students with enough books to
take home and sometimes did not have
enough paper for homework assignments.
The school owned no computers and of
fered no art classes. Two of the three bath
rooms were locked everyday and the one
that was open was not adequately stocked.

Many of the teachers were lacking sufficient
credentials. There was even a decomposing
rat in the corner of the gym.
The defendant's attorneys argued that there
was no proof that a decomposing rat had any
bearing on students' academic achievement.
Citing a local example, Darling-Ham
mond said that on average Palo Alto High
School spends twice as much on academic
and maintenance programs as Ravenswood
High School in East Palo Alto.
"Less money means less qualified
teachers," she said. "Teachers are the
most inequitably distributed of all educa
tional resources."
She pointed to the direct correlation be
tween teacher certification and students'
scores on state achievement tests to argue
that more monetary resources should be de
voted to strengthening school faculties. She
added that many schools have improved
scores by actually encouraging the lowest
achieving students to drop out or simply not
take the tests, which will be more harmful
than helpful in the long-term.
"People pretend kids start on a level
playing field," she said. "There is this pre
sumption that some kids don't work as
hard and need extra help but that's just not
the case."
