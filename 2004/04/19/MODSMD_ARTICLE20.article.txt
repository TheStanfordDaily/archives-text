# No. 2 Stanford sweeps Cal
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
A little rain was no match for the Stanford
baseball team's hit parade yesterday after
noon at Sunken Diamond, as the Cardinal
completed yet another three-game sweep of
rival California with an 8-3, come-from-be
hind victory.
With solid pitching and defense to com
plement its typically potent offense, Stanford
(29-5, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference) extended
its dominance over the Bears to 16 straight
games. Cal (20-23, 6-9) has now dropped six
consecutive series to the Cardinal.
Pitching on the heels of two strong outings
by sophomore teammates Mark Romanczuk
and Jeff Gilmore — who tossed the Cardi
nal's first complete game of the season in Sat
urday's 9-2 win — freshman Blake Holler
failed to continue the trend yesterday.
Cal leftfielder Justin Nelson singled with
one out in the second inning before designat
ed hitter James Holder drilled a 2-0 pitch
deep into the trees in left to put the Bears
ahead for the first time all weekend.
Holler retired the next batter before issu
ing back-to-back walks on nine pitches,
prompting head coach Mark Marquess to put
a premature end to his young pitcher's outing.
"I didn't think his stuff was bad," Mar
quess said. "He got behind [in the count] and
got a changeup up to Holder, who can do that
to you. He was on a real short leash, but we'll
evaluate him during this week."
Senior David O'Hagan was masterful in
long relief, settling down after walking the
first batter he faced on four pitches to throw
5 1/ 3 innings of shutout baseball, allowing
just one hit and striking out five.
"I felt like I was able to go after the hitters
pretty well today," O'Hagan said. "It's real
comforting when you have such great de
fense. I knew I just had to do my best to hold
them to a couple of runs or hits and we'd
come back and win the game."
The Cardinal offense did just that, get
ting all the runs they would need in a four
run fourth inning, with a little help from the
Cal defense.
With one run home and runners on the
corners with one out, sophomore first base
man John Mayberry Jr. stepped to the plate
and hit a sharp ground ball down the third
base line. Cal third baseman Matt Einspahr
made a diving stop, but his hurried throw
home sailed wide of the plate and all the way
to the screen, allowing senior Jonny Ash to
score to tie the game.
After junior catcher Donny Lucy walked,
senior right fielder Brian Hall gave Stanford
the lead for good at 4-2 — and extended his
hit streak to a career-high 19 games — with a
two-run double to deep center.
With O'Hagan cruising, the Cardinal
added insurance runs in the sixth and seventh
and two more in the eighth on Jed Lowrie's
team-leading 11th home run of the season.
Freshman Jeff-Stimpson, who picked up
his first career save in Friday's victory, gave
up one run in two innings of relief to com
plete the sweep. O'Hagan improved to 5-0
with the win.
"I just wanted to get into a position where
1 can help the team as much as possible and if
this is what coach Marquess wants me to do,
