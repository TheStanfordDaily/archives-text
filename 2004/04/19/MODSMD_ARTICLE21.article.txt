# In-game offensive adjustments prove golden for Card against Cal
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Donny Lucy was in the dugout Saturday preparing for an eighth-inning at-bat against California left-hander
Travis Talbott when Danny Putnam found him.
"Donny, he's going to try to throw a change-up to righties," Putnam told his teammate.
Sure enough, Talbott threw a first-pitch change-up to Lucy, who zeroed in on the off-speed offering and ham
mered it over the fence in left-center for his second home run of the day.
Then, yesterday, Brian Hall stepped up to the plate against Cal righty Kyle Crisp in the third with the bases
loaded and one out expecting to see a slider â€” because that's how the Bears got Hall out in his first at-bat.
Sure enough, Crisp's second pitch was a hanging slider that Hall slammed deep to left-center and off the glove
of Cal center fielder David Weiner fora two-run double to put Stanford ahead for good.
This kind of in-game ability to make adjustments that has contributed most to Stanford's offensive consistency.
The Cardinal leads the conference in bating average and is among the leaders in home runs and runs scored.
"We've just got so many guys swinging the bat well right now," Hall said.
Hall and Lucy have been the hallmarks of this team-wide consistency. Both players extended their respective
career-high hitting streaks this weekend.
Lucy has set a new career mark with an 11-game streak, while Hall's 19-game hit parade has been the longest
by a Stanford player this year.
Sam Fuld also extended his own hitting streak to 10 games, already giving the Cardinal six different players
with a streak of at least 10 games. Jed Lowrie, Jonny Ash and Putnum accomplished the feat earlier in the season.
(By comparison, Stanford had nine hitting streaks of comparable length all of last season.)
So much for the naysayers who claimed the Cardinal wouldn't produce after losing their two best offensive
players, Ryan Garko and Carlos Quentin, to the pros.
While Hall's hit streak has been the longest by a Cardinal player since Quentin had a 26-game streak last sea
son, Lucy's surge has been more surprising.

Junior outfielder Danny Putnam slides into home in a game this weekend against California. The No. 2 Cardinal completed a
three-game sweep of trie Golden Bears yesterday at Sunken Diamond, improving its streak to 16 consecutive wins over Cal.
