# In-game offensive adjustments prove golden for Card against Cal
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Donny Lucy was in the dugout Saturday preparing for an eighth-inning at-bat against California left-hander
Travis Talbott when Danny Putnam found him.
"Donny, he's going to try to throw a change-up to righties," Putnam told his teammate.
Sure enough, Talbott threw a first-pitch change-up to Lucy, who zeroed in on the off-speed offering and ham
mered it over the fence in left-center for his second home run of the day.
Then, yesterday, Brian Hall stepped up to the plate against Cal righty Kyle Crisp in the third with the bases
loaded and one out expecting to see a slider — because that's how the Bears got Hall out in his first at-bat.
Sure enough, Crisp's second pitch was a hanging slider that Hall slammed deep to left-center and off the glove
of Cal center fielder David Weiner fora two-run double to put Stanford ahead for good.
This kind of in-game ability to make adjustments that has contributed most to Stanford's offensive consistency.
The Cardinal leads the conference in bating average and is among the leaders in home runs and runs scored.
"We've just got so many guys swinging the bat well right now," Hall said.
Hall and Lucy have been the hallmarks of this team-wide consistency. Both players extended their respective
career-high hitting streaks this weekend.
Lucy has set a new career mark with an 11-game streak, while Hall's 19-game hit parade has been the longest
by a Stanford player this year.
Sam Fuld also extended his own hitting streak to 10 games, already giving the Cardinal six different players
with a streak of at least 10 games. Jed Lowrie, Jonny Ash and Putnum accomplished the feat earlier in the season.
(By comparison, Stanford had nine hitting streaks of comparable length all of last season.)
So much for the naysayers who claimed the Cardinal wouldn't produce after losing their two best offensive
players, Ryan Garko and Carlos Quentin, to the pros.
While Hall's hit streak has been the longest by a Cardinal player since Quentin had a 26-game streak last sea
son, Lucy's surge has been more surprising.
The junior catcher had difficulty living up to his billing out of high school his first two years in the program

Junior outfielder Danny Putnam slides into home in a game this weekend against California. The No. 2 Cardinal completed a
three-game sweep of trie Golden Bears yesterday at Sunken Diamond, improving its streak to 16 consecutive wins over Cal.
because he was stuck behind an
All-American (Garko).
Lucy was forced to play both
first base and designated hitter
— neither of which he had much
experience with before college
— and thus never got fully com
fortable with his position or
his routine.
But with Garko now out of the
way, and the starting catcher's job
in hand. Lucy's mental approach

has changed dramatically.
"It's so much easier coming out
every day knowing you're going
to be in the lineup," he said.
Now that newfound relaxation
has started to reap benefits for
Lucy at the plate.
He had the first two-homer
game of his career Saturday
against Cal and has raised his av
erage (.327) over 30 points in the
last two weeks with the hit streak.
"You're kind of nervous and
want to get off to a good start at
the beginning of the season," he
said. "1 think I've relaxed and now
I've settled into a nice flow here
midway through the season."
Lucy can partially thank his

boyhood friend, Putnam, for his
newfound success with the hat.
Lucy and Putnam grew up 20 min
utes apart in the greater San
Diego area, first met at age 12.
and competed together on travel
ing teams and against one another
in high school.
The familiarity doesn't breed
contempt in this case.
Just a little bit of mentoring.
"He knows my swing better
than anyone else on the team and
he always tells me when I'm doing
some of the little things wrong,"
Lucy said.
Meanwhile, Hall continues to
rack up the personal accolades.
Friday, he had a career-high four

hits — something he attributed to
pre-game preparation.
"I got really comfortable be
fore the game in batting practice,"
he said. "I tried to be quiet at the
plate and not have too much
movement and it just carried over
into the game. 1 saw everything
very well and was able to pick up
the ball out of the pitcher's hand
pretty quickly."
As long as the Stanford hit
ters continue to make adjust
ments like they have been, don't
be surprised if someone ap
proaches the school-record 37-
game hitting streak set by Jef
frey Hammonds in his freshman
year (Class of '93).
