# UOP overcomes two-game deficit to beat Card
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
It was one of the best comeback performances in one of the most impor
tant matches of the season â€” but the Stanford men's volleyball team (9-18,
6-26 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) wasn't the team that benefited.
On Saturday night in Burnham Pavilion, the Cardinal, up two games to
zero, dropped a 14-5 lead in the third to hand the University of Pacific (10-
19, 6-16) the game and eventually the match. The loss eliminated Stanford
from playoff contention and gave the Tigers their second consecutive victo
ry over Stanford in just four days.
That's because in an usual end to the regular season, Stanford took on Pa
cific in Stockton last Wednesday as well. The Tigers routed the Cardinal, 3-
0, in a match Stanford sophomore outside hitter Ben Rcddy said was much
different from Saturday's performance.
"On Wednesday we didn't come ready to play," he said after Saturday's
game. "Tonight, we came ready to play. We just didn't finish them off."
But the Cardinal was painfully close. Stanford came out swinging in game
one fora .516 hitting percentage against a Pacific team that didn't look like
it could have swept the Cardinal just three days earlier. Junior middle block
er Craig Buell led his team to a 30-24 victory with six kills.
It was a performance Cardinal head coach Don Shaw said was a vast im
provement from Wednesday night's matchup.
"We had a sound game plan and we made some adjustments to what they
were doing," he said.
Game two seemed even more of a breeze for Stanford, which jumped out
to a 19-13 lead after the Tigers mishandled two consecutive balls. Errors
plagued Pacific, and a frustrated junior outside hitter Nils Daubers yanked
on the net after a highly contested call in Stanford's favor. Reddy led with six
kills (he finished with 11 on the night) as Pacific struggled to pull together an
offense. The Tigers fittingly ended game two on a service error, 30-21.
The match seemed all but over. Stanford stormed into game three, taking
a 14-5 lead after a kill by junior outside hitter Pat Bomhack sailed off the top
of a Tiger block.
"We had them right where we wanted them," Shaw said. "We just need
ed to stay focused and close it out."
But Pacific refused to go home. Led by 10 kills from junior outside hitter
Brian Zodrow. the Tigers surged fora 17-8 run to tie the score at 22, and
went on to win, 30-27.
"We just relaxed and thought we could win without really trying and they

said. "We got frustrated."
After that, it was a downward
spiral for Stanford, which trailed Pa

with another run. grabbing eight
points to Stanford's one, taking
game four, 30-21.
"It turned around in a hurry,"

Shaw said. "We just could not get it
back."
Stanford had one more chance to
do just that in the definitive fifth
game. But the Tigers took an early 4-
1 lead en route to taking the game
and match at 15-10.
"We hit zero in games four and
five," Shaw said. "That's unbeliev
able. Not much explanation for
that."
Half of Pacific's hits went for
points in the final game, numbers
that only emphasized Stanford's
struggling attack.
"I think we lost our focus a little,"
Shaw said. "We got a little bit away
from the here and now and that's a
dangerous thing in volleyball."
