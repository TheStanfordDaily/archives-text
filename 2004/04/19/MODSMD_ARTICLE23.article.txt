# Card finishes season third at National Championships
## 
### KRISTEN BELL STAFF WRITER 
1 he Super Six. To those outside
the world of college gymnastics, it
might sound like some weird aver
age of the Elite Eight and the Final
Four. But to college gymnasts, the
Super Six is the be-all and end-all
— the last stop on the road to a na
tional championship.
The teams filed into UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion in six straight lines
for the competition on Friday night
— Georgia and Alabama making
their usual appearances, Utah turn
ing heads in their metallic silver
warm-up suits, defending champi
ons UCLA coming into a roar of
cheers from the hometown crowd of
4,167, Florida stepping in for its
fourth Super Six appearance and
Stanford marching in with dreams
of making history.
Stanford s mere appearance
made school history; it was only the
second time that the Cardinal has
broken into the Super Six. The last
time was in 2002 when the team qual
ified by a narrow margin and finished
sixth. This year, Stanford tied for
first in the preliminary meet on
Thursday and looked to repeat that
winning performance on Friday.
"Before the meet, I told the
team, 'This is our time,' " said head
coach Kristen Smyth. "'You've
been working hard all year, so why
not? Compete with your hearts and
have no regrets. Love the sport and
each other.'"
Stanford's total of 197.125 tied the
Cardinal with Alabama for third
place, just shy of Georgia's 197.2 and
a full point behind UCLA's near
flawless 198.125. Third place is the

best finish ever for Stanford's women's gymnastics pro
gram and a solid improvement over last year's eighth
place finish, hut is also one that leaves plenty of room
for improvement in the next few years.
The Cardinal also scooped up a school record of 15
All-American honors, almost double last year's record
of eight honors. Senior Lise Leveille and sophomore
Natalie Foley each took home five All-American
awards, while seniors Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer earned three and two, respectively. Leveille,
Foley and Wing have now received All-American hon
ors eight times each, making them some of Stanford's
most decorated student-athletes.
"What they were able to do tonight was historical.
They overachieved and I could not have asked for any

thing more," said Smyth, who was named Coach of the
Year by the National Association of Gymnastics
Coaches after the meet. "It sets the stage for future
teams to follow in their footsteps."
Led by five seniors competing for the last time, Stan
ford hit 24 out of 24 routines for the second night in a
row. The team looked as strong as it had all year, par
ticularly on balance beam, its first event of the evening.
Neither early jitters nor cheers of "UCLA, fight,
light, fight!" fazed the Cardinal, as the team stuck every
dismount on beam to post a 49.25, with senior Lindsay
Wing leading the charge with a 9.925.
Stanford built on that energy on floor exercise —
Leveille and Fluhrer earned twin 9.9s to lead the team
to a 49.325. Vault proved to be the team's highest scor

ing event of the evening with a 49.35. Senior Kendall
Beck decided to vault without a warm up for the first
time this season and the last time in her career after
struggling through several shoulder surgeries. Beck
landed short but was happy to be able to compete one
last time.
"Her performance was very motivating," Smyth said.
The Cardinal closed out the night on the uneven bars
— and every senior who stepped up to the bars (Lev
eille, Wing and Fluhrer) nailed her routine and stuck
the landing. The team racked up 49.2 points on bars,
second only to UCLA in that event.
"Caroline's routine was the last one of the night and
it was her best routine ever," said assistant coach Laris
sa Fontaine, a former Stanford gymnast and 1998

NCAA vault champion. "It signi
fies all they've done this year...
and how much the program has
built since I graduated."
Added Fluhrer: "Especially
for the seniors, it was just a magi
cal night."
Fluhrer was too excited
about the team's finish to get
much sleep before competing in
the individual finals on Satur
day night. About 10 gymnasts
advanced to event finals ac
cording to their scores at the
preliminary meet.
Fluhrer competed on the
bars and floor alongside fellow
co-captain Wing, who competed
beam, and sophomore Natalie
Foley, who competed vault, bars
and floor. Fluhrer danced and
tumbled to her Madonna music
for the last time to tie for fifth
place on floor, while Wing stuck
her last beam routine to earn
sixth place.
Foley captured third place
on vault to add to her eighth
place-finish in the all-around.
After taking a step on the landing
on her first vault, a Yerchenko
full, Foley stepped it up to stick
her second vault — the more dif
ficult Yerchenko full-and-a-half
—to earn an average score of
9.894, just behind champion Ash
ley Miles of Alabama and sec
ond-place finisher Annabeth
Eberle of Utah.
The event finals were partic
ularly challenging because the
gymnasts had to compete for the
third night in a row.
"I was running on laughing
gas [from team finals] last night,"
Foley said.

Just after finishing the meet, Foley said she is already
thinking about plans for next year.
"I want a national championship so bad," Foley
said. "Whether it's a team title or an individual all
around or event title, I just want to win stuff and I
know our team will be really talented. We'll have a
shot at it next year.
"But I will miss the seniors so much," Foley contin
ued. "They are the heart and soul and energy of our
team. Because of the five of them, our team has the
most heart out there. And they all had the meet of their
lives last night..."
"We're going to Disneyland," said Wing with a laugh
and big smile.
The team hit the Magic Kingdom yesterday.

place-finish in the all-around.
After taking a step on the landing
on her first vault, a Yerchenko
full, Foley stepped it up to stick
her second vault — the more dif
ficult Yerchenko full-and-a-half
—to earn an average score of
9.894, just behind champion Ash
ley Miles of Alabama and sec
ond-place finisher Annabeth
Eberle of Utah.
The event finals were partic
ularly challenging because the
gymnasts had to compete for the
third night in a row.
"I was running on laughing
gas [from team finals] last night,"
Foley said.

Just after finishing the meet, Foley said she is already
thinking about plans for next year.
"I want a national championship so bad," Foley
said. "Whether it's a team title or an individual all
around or event title, I just want to win stuff and I
know our team will be really talented. We'll have a
shot at it next year.
"But I will miss the seniors so much," Foley contin
ued. "They are the heart and soul and energy of our
team. Because of the five of them, our team has the
most heart out there. And they all had the meet of their
lives last night..."
"We're going to Disneyland," said Wing with a laugh
and big smile.
The team hit the Magic Kingdom yesterday.

oophomore Natalie roley competes during this weekend s National Championship meet held at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, Calif. Foley finished third on the vault
and took home nve All-American awards lor her efforts. Foley's teammates, seniors Lisa Leveille, Lindsay Wing and Caroline Fluhrer eacn took home All-American
honors, as well. Third place represent s the best finish ever tor tfie Stanford women's gymnastics program.
1 he Super Six. To those outside
the world of college gymnastics, it
might sound like some weird aver
age of the Elite Eight and the Final
Four. But to college gymnasts, the
Super Six is the be-all and end-all
— the last stop on the road to a na
tional championship.
The teams filed into UCLA's
Pauley Pavilion in six straight lines
for the competition on Friday night
— Georgia and Alabama making
their usual appearances, Utah turn
ing heads in their metallic silver
warm-up suits, defending champi
ons UCLA coming into a roar of
cheers from the hometown crowd of
4,167, Florida stepping in for its
fourth Super Six appearance and
Stanford marching in with dreams
of making history.
Stanford s mere appearance
made school history; it was only the
second time that the Cardinal has
broken into the Super Six. The last
time was in 2002 when the team qual
ified by a narrow margin and finished
sixth. This year, Stanford tied for
first in the preliminary meet on
Thursday and looked to repeat that
winning performance on Friday.
"Before the meet, I told the
team, 'This is our time,' " said head
coach Kristen Smyth. "'You've
been working hard all year, so why
not? Compete with your hearts and
have no regrets. Love the sport and
each other.'"
Stanford's total of 197.125 tied the
Cardinal with Alabama for third
place, just shy of Georgia's 197.2 and
a full point behind UCLA's near
flawless 198.125. Third place is the

best finish ever for Stanford's women's gymnastics pro
gram and a solid improvement over last year's eighth
place finish, hut is also one that leaves plenty of room
for improvement in the next few years.
The Cardinal also scooped up a school record of 15
All-American honors, almost double last year's record
of eight honors. Senior Lise Leveille and sophomore
Natalie Foley each took home five All-American
awards, while seniors Lindsay Wing and Caroline
Fluhrer earned three and two, respectively. Leveille,
Foley and Wing have now received All-American hon
ors eight times each, making them some of Stanford's
most decorated student-athletes.
"What they were able to do tonight was historical.
They overachieved and I could not have asked for any

thing more," said Smyth, who was named Coach of the
Year by the National Association of Gymnastics
Coaches after the meet. "It sets the stage for future
teams to follow in their footsteps."
Led by five seniors competing for the last time, Stan
ford hit 24 out of 24 routines for the second night in a
row. The team looked as strong as it had all year, par
ticularly on balance beam, its first event of the evening.
Neither early jitters nor cheers of "UCLA, fight,
light, fight!" fazed the Cardinal, as the team stuck every
dismount on beam to post a 49.25, with senior Lindsay
Wing leading the charge with a 9.925.
Stanford built on that energy on floor exercise —
Leveille and Fluhrer earned twin 9.9s to lead the team
to a 49.325. Vault proved to be the team's highest scor

ing event of the evening with a 49.35. Senior Kendall
Beck decided to vault without a warm up for the first
time this season and the last time in her career after
struggling through several shoulder surgeries. Beck
landed short but was happy to be able to compete one
last time.
"Her performance was very motivating," Smyth said.
The Cardinal closed out the night on the uneven bars
— and every senior who stepped up to the bars (Lev
eille, Wing and Fluhrer) nailed her routine and stuck
the landing. The team racked up 49.2 points on bars,
second only to UCLA in that event.
"Caroline's routine was the last one of the night and
it was her best routine ever," said assistant coach Laris
sa Fontaine, a former Stanford gymnast and 1998

NCAA vault champion. "It signi
fies all they've done this year...
and how much the program has
built since I graduated."
Added Fluhrer: "Especially
for the seniors, it was just a magi
cal night."
Fluhrer was too excited
about the team's finish to get
much sleep before competing in
the individual finals on Satur
day night. About 10 gymnasts
advanced to event finals ac
cording to their scores at the
preliminary meet.
Fluhrer competed on the
bars and floor alongside fellow
co-captain Wing, who competed
beam, and sophomore Natalie
Foley, who competed vault, bars
and floor. Fluhrer danced and
tumbled to her Madonna music
for the last time to tie for fifth
place on floor, while Wing stuck
her last beam routine to earn
sixth place.
Foley captured third place
on vault to add to her eighth
place-finish in the all-around.
After taking a step on the landing
on her first vault, a Yerchenko
full, Foley stepped it up to stick
