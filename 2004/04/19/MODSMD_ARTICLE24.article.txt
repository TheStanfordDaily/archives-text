# Softball loses to top-ranked Arizona, beats ASU twice

### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Cardinal softball team (35-12,5-4 Pacific-10
Conference) bounced back from a difficult Friday loss to
top-ranked Arizona (43-1, 9-0) to post two straight
shutouts against No. 27 Arizona State (30-21,0-7) on Sat
urday and yesterday in Pac-10 Conference play.
While Friday's 8-0 loss to a stacked Wildcat team
could have put a damper on the entire weekend of play,
the Cardinal and star pitcher Dana Sorensen bounced
back in a big way to dominate the Sun Devils in 7-0 and 4-
0 wins to close out the weekend.
The Cardinal got into trouble from the very beginning
of Friday night's loss against Arizona, as the starter,
Sorensen, was tagged for five runs, all earned, in the first
two innings of the game. Arizona's Autumn Champion
and Caitlin Lowe, who came into the weekend 1-2 in bat
ting average in the Pac-10, went a combined 5-for-6 on the
night and Wildcat designated player Wendy Allen
notched five RBIs.
All-American pitcher Alicia Hollowell, who started
in the circle for the Wildcats, overwhelmed the Cardi
nal batters, allowing only four baserunners in six
shutout innings to earn the win and run her win-loss
record for the season to a perfect 28-0. Sorensen took

the loss for the Cardinal.
"We ran into a very good team, and they managed to
jump on us early," said Stanford head coach John
Rittman of Friday night's loss to the Wildcats. "Still, we
never gave up â€” but it's hard to score off a pitcher like
Hollowell, especially when she's pitching with a three-run
lead going into it."
The Cardinal managed to put Friday's loss behind it
before its games against the Sun Devils, holding a good
Arizona State lineup scoreless in two straight wins to
close out a long homestand at Boyd and Jill Smith Fami
ly Stadium. Sorensen earned the win in both victories
against ihe Sun Devils to push her record on the season to
a stellar 21-7.
The Cardinal received a minor scare in Saturday's
game when, after pitching five-plus scoreless innings,
Sorensen was struck in the leg with a line drive and forced
to leave the game. However, her replacement, sopho
more pitcher Laura Severson, proved more than capable,
as she shut down the Sun Devils for the next two innings
to wrap up the 7-0 Cardinal victory. Senior catcher Jessi
ca Allister continued her recent hot streak with a home
run and a double en route to a 3-for-4 performance. Ju
nior first basemen Leah Nelson also homered in Satur
day's victory.
Stanford took an early lead in Sunday's game and

never looked back, scoring two runs in the bottom of the
first inning, the first run coming on a Catalina Morris RBI
single and the second on a Sun Devil throwing error that
scored Morris from third base later in the inning. Allister
again hit very well, going 1-for-l with an RBI and two
walks. She attributed her recent success to an increased
focus on pitch selectivity in practice.
"My problem has always been not getting good pitches
to hit," Allister said. "Lately I've been focusing on seeing
the ball better and finding the right pitches, and it's worked
out well so far," Allister said after yesterday's victory.
Sunday featured stellar offensive performances by Al
lister and sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin, who
smacked an RBI triple in the sixth inning to extend the
Cardinal lead to 3-0 and then scored on an Allister bloop
single later in the inning to provide the final margin of vic
tory. However, Sunday's game belonged to Sorensen who
mowed down Sun Devil after Sun Devil on the way to a
complete-game one-hitter. Sorensen only allowed one
baserunner and struck out 10 in seven shutout innings,
mixing in a devastating array of pitches despite some lin
gering pain from Saturday's leg injury.
Next week, the Cardinal takes its show on the road
after nearly a month of home games, playing St. Mary's in
a Tuesday doubleheader before taking on two powerful
conference rivals. No. 3 UCLA and No. 6 Washington, in

a crucial road trip.
Everyone seemed excited by the opportunity to play
on the road after such a long homestand. Sorensen and
Allister both said that road trips are fun and a nice way to
get away from the daily grind of Stanford life.
"We get to stay in a hotel and just relax and really just
think about softball fora weekend without all the distrac
tions," Allister said.
While it would be tempting after this weekend's rela
tive success to look ahead to conference foes UCLA and
Washington next weekend, Rittman refused to look past
Tuesday's matchup against St. Mary's.
"We need to be ready to play," he said. "St. Mary's
could be a stepping stone, but we can't look past them.
They're a good ballclub and we need to make sure we're
ready for Tuesday."
St. Mary's might be an important "stepping stone" for
the Cardinal, but it is next weekend's conference
matchups that are a pivotal point in the Cardinal's Pac-10
schedule. With a 5-4 conference record, the Cardinal is on
the borderline between the upper and lower echelon of
the nation's best softball conference.
To secure a good seeding in the NCAA Tournament,
Stanford must be able to win some games against the very
best competition around, and UCLA and Washington
certainly fall into this category.
