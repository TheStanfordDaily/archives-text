## Google becomes major tool for paper scavengers

(U-WIRE) BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — For college students, researching
is about to get a whole lot easier.
The popular search engine www.google.com has announced it will he
adding a new feature lor result sorting. Alongside 15 other universities, In
diana University-Purdue and the University Indianapolis will be adding its
collections of scholarly papers to the bank.
Students who often find themselves frustrated by sifting through ir
relevant results when doing a paper or project will now be able to re
search more easily.
"When I'm doing my homework, 1 get so mad when all that comes up is
personal Web pages," freshman Gretchen McKibben said. "I can't use them

in projects, and it wastes a ton of time."
Many students share this frustration, though the new system could pre
sent some problems.
"Results could be a concern unless (Google) says that the articles
are put up by professors and have not met criteria for publishing in
academic journals," said David Gonsoroski, a student reference assis
tant at the Main Library.
Another problem is the limited amount of data available for search.
lUCAT, lU's online library search system, allows students to search the
many academic journals to which IU subscribes.
"It would probably be limited unless Google pays millions of dollars to
subscribe to all of the journals we do at lU," said Gonsoroski.
Steve Lawrence, a researcher for NEC Research Institute, said online ar
ticles are far more likely to be cited than those published in scholarly jour

nals, according to an article published in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
"The mean number of citations to offline articles is 2.74, and the mean
number of citations to online articles is 7.03, or 2.6 times greater than the
number for offline articles," Lawrence said last year in Nature.
But the biggest payoff seems to be the students' work. Freshman
Renee Farina often has trouble finding what she needs on Google. She
said her biggest problem was looking up a book for class online. Her re
turned results included online stores that sold the books but no actual in
formation about the book.
"It's a good idea," Farina said, "and I think that students will take advan
tage of it. If I need to use it, I will."
Google is currently testing the addition to its search engine, but if all goes
well, it could be up for use in a few months, said Mackenzie Smith, associate
director of technology for MlT's libraries.
