# 'Date rape' label may prove more dangerous

### STEVEN ORBUCH THE DARTMOUTH 
(U-WIRE) HANOVER. N.H. — Noted researcher
David Lisak identified the dangers surrounding society's
use of the "date rapist" label in a Thursday evening lec
ture at Dartmouth College.
"The problem with the term 'date rapist' is that 'date'
serves as a qualifier for the act; it helps to show that
there is something different from their act and real
rape," Lisak said.
Lisak also said the term "date rapist" has made it par
ticularly difficult for courts to convict accused offenders
because the date rapist image is largely non-threatening.
To many, the date rapist is the "nice guy" who
drank too much, whose unpremeditated action was a
result of miscommunication and someone who
wouldn't rape again.

Lisak said, however, this image is utterly wrong.
Although the date rapist slips beneath the radar be
cause he is not a stranger who carries a knife, wears a
ski mask or jumps out of an alleyway, "rapists are
rapists," Lisak said.
Moreover, Lisak presented empirical evidence
which argued that any rapist would most likely be a re
peat offender, and that date rapists are particularly dri
ven to premeditate their crimes because they choose to
act without using weapons.
At present, the overwhelming majority of rapes go
unreported. Among those reported, there are tremen
dous attrition rates from number of rapes report to ar
rests made and from the number of rape arrests made
to actual convictions, according to Lisak.
Throughout his lecture, he said society must first ad
just and dispel its false presumptions about rape and
rapists in order to remedy these problems of attrition.

"A lot of people think that people rape because they
are sexually deprived," Lisak said. "On average, rapists
have more consensual sex than non-rapists."
Most people also consider infliction of physical in
juries to be a requisite for rape reports and convic
tions. However, the majority of rapists do not use
weapons and use instrumental, not gratuitous, vio
lence, according to Lisak.
"They are not so out of control of their impulses that
they recklessly inflict injury," he said.
Lisak also argued that society has incorrectly mea
sured the role of alcohol in rapes.
Alcohol is not backdrop against which people err into
becoming date or acquaintance rapists, he said. Rather,
it is an item that date rapists deliberately use as a way to
"cultivate their prey," Lisak said.
Lisak stressed the importance of rape prevention and
society's responsibility to break up rape cultures.

If done correctly, Lisak said, it would become appar
ent that despite discouragingly high sexual assault and
rape statistics today, rapists are in a clear minority.
"The vast majority of all criminal activities any
where is committed by a small group of serial perpe
trators," Lisak said.
Lisak is founding editor of the journal Psycholo
gy of Men and Masculinity. He serves as faculty for
the National Judicial Education Program and the
American Prosecutors Research Institute, is an ex
pert witness and consultant in sexual violence and
homicide cases across the country and is a consul
tant to judicial, prosecutor and law enforcement
education programs.
His speech, titled "The Undetected Rapist: What it
Means for the Good Guys," was part of an ongoing se
ries of campus events in conjunction with Sexual Assault
Awareness Week.
