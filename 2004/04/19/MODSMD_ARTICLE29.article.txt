### BEN WHALEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's Earth Week celebration kicks off
today with cultural groups, student environmental
groups, art. discussion panels and lectures designed
to encourage college students to pay more attention
to the environment.
"Earth Day can sound sort of cheesy to people,
and it can also distract people from real environ
mental issues that are occurring on a day-to-day
basis, but at the same time it is a gixxJ way to focus
and bring attention to environmental issues," said
junior Emmett Hopkins. Hopkins is a member of
Students fora Sustainable Stanford, the campus
group organizing this year's Earth Week events.
"It is a call to protect, learn about and celebrate
our planet," he added.
This year's campus Earth Week celebration will
feature one of the original founders of the holiday,
former U.S. Rep. Pete McCloskey, who personally
helped with much of the planning of the week's
events. He will speak as part of Wednesday's panel
discussion. "Is Green on the Agenda: Perspectives
on the Current State of U.S. Environmental Policy,"
along with Stanford professors and Environmental
Protection Agency officials.
"In planning these events, we wanted to focus on
personal empowerment, helping people learn about
the political factors that they will need to consider
during the upcoming elections," Hopkins said. "We
are asking the question: 'Where is the country going
right now when it comes to environmental policy?'"
Consistent with the theme of personal empower
ment, all the week's events are designed to encour
age audience participation, he added.
There will also be two lectures, one featuring
Management Science and Engineering Prof. Jim
Sweeney on Monday night and the other showcas

ing Civil and Environmental Engineering Prof. Len
Ortolano. Sweeney, who is active as one of Califor
nia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's energy
policy advisors, will address energy issues in the
state of California and the governor's recent energy
plan. Ortolano, the former director of Stanford's
Urban Studies Department and current interim di
rector of the Haas Center for Public Service, will
speak on how normal citizens can affect environ
mental policy.
The weeks events will culminate on Earth Day
with a fair in White Plaza, where Stanford's envi
ronmental, political and student groups will have ta
bles and resources set up so that Stanford commu
nity members can learn how to make environment
friendly practices part of their everyday life.
Student groups tabling on Thursday include
the Stanford Exchange Shop, the Stanford Solar
Car Project. Animal Rights on the Farm (ARF)
and The Redwood Club.
As the variety of participating groups suggests.
Earth Day is not simply about trees.
"Our main goal is to promote reuse and reduce
consumption at Stanford," said junior Christine
Chiu, co-founder of the SEx Shop.
"We will have a booth at thb festival educating
people about how the modern day meat and animal
product industry is one of the most devastating for
the environment," said ARF co-founder Ryan
Schwartz, a freshman. "The rainforest is being cut
down to raise cattle for American consumption. If
every American cut his or her meat consumption by
only 10 percent, enough grain would be freed up to
supply every person on the face of the Earth with a
loaf of bread every day."
The Redwood Club will also provide students
with opportunities for weekly camping excursions
throughout California.
According to the organization's leaders, Stu

dents fora Sustainable Stanford is currently pursu
ing two main goals, the first of which is to foster an
ongoing dialogue about the environment and issues
of sustainability. The club's second objective is to
promote green architecture and processes on cam
pus through direct student action.
"This includes negotiating with administra
tion to push for more sustainable building
policies, as well as working with Stanford Din
ing to reduce waste and increase organic pur
chasing," Hopkins said.
Freshman Michael Peterson, a members of Stu
dents fora Sustainable Stanford, said that the
club's goal for this week was to give students
knowledge they can carry with them beyond Earth
Day celebrations.
"1 hope people will take home with them an
idea of the complexities of environmental prob
lems, as well as of the importance of the environ
ment in our future," he said. "It is very hard to
think about long-term consequences, especially
for college students."
The existence the Earth Day can be attributed to
college students' action and advocacy. The holiday's
predecessor. Arbor Day, which was initiated by the
state of Nebraska in 1872. called for grade schools to
each plant a single tree. Earth Day, initiated in the
aftermath of the industrial development following
World War 11, had a much broader scope than its
older brother "Arbor." By 1970 student support of
Earth Day was so strong that President Richard
Nixon called in the Federal Bureau of Investigations
for surveillance.
"Get aware of the world around you," said Red
wood Club President Diederik Marius, a doctoral
student in electrical engineering. "There is more
than just your computer, your homework, your
dorm or your campus. It's a cliche but it holds — na
ture is good to you, if you are good to nature." ■
