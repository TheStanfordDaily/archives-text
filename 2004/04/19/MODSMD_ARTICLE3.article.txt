## 
### CHRIS NGUYGEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler killed 6,000,000 Jewish people in concentration camps as part of the "final
solution" to address "the Jewish problem" during World War 11. Gloria Hollander Lyon survived seven
of these camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen, and even escaped from a truck on its
way to a gas chamber. She will speak tonight about her experiences during the Holocaust at 7 p.m.
Born on January 20,1930, in then Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers seized her family from their
home in 1944. Lyon's mother survived experimentation conducted by Dr. Josef Mengele but died
three years after being liberated from Auschwitz. Lyon immigrated to the United States in 1947,
but her father and siblings were trapped under Communist rule in Eastern Europe.
Lyon went to law school in San Francisco and met her husband, Karl, in Kansas City, Missouri.
Together, they settled in the Bay Area and raised a family. From there, they were able to bring
Lyon's father to the United States in 1966 and over a period of several years, Lyon's sister and two
brothers were also able to immigrate to the United States with their families.
The 1995 documentary, "When I Was 14: A Survivor Remembers," chronicled Lyon's experi
ence in the Nazi death camps.
Lyon will be speaking at Stanford as part of the observance of Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The internationally recognized date, which is called "Yom Hashoah" in Hebrew, corresponds to
the 27th day of Nisan on the Hebrew calendar. The United States Holocaust Memorial Council was
created by Congress in 1980 and is "man
dated to lead the nation in civic com
memorations and to encourage appro
priate remembrance observances
throughout the country." Holocaust re
membrance activities can occur during
the Week of Remembrance, which be
gins the Sunday before the actual Day of
Remembrance and ends the following
Sunday.
Stanford will hold the Holocaust
Candlelit Memorial at 9 p.m. tonight
after Lyon's speech in the Citrus
Courtyard in the History Corner of the
Quad. Yesterday evening there was a
screening and discussion of the Acad
emy Award-winning film "Life is

the community, Jewish or not, to remem
ber what happened in the Holocaust."
