### CHRIS NGUYGEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler killed 6,000,000 Jewish people in concentration camps as part of the "final
solution" to address "the Jewish problem" during World War 11. Gloria Hollander Lyon survived seven
of these camps, including Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen, and even escaped from a truck on its
way to a gas chamber. She will speak tonight about her experiences during the Holocaust at 7 p.m.
Born on January 20,1930, in then Czechoslovakia, Nazi soldiers seized her family from their
home in 1944. Lyon's mother survived experimentation conducted by Dr. Josef Mengele but died
three years after being liberated from Auschwitz. Lyon immigrated to the United States in 1947,
but her father and siblings were trapped under Communist rule in Eastern Europe.
Lyon went to law school in San Francisco and met her husband, Karl, in Kansas City, Missouri.
Together, they settled in the Bay Area and raised a family. From there, they were able to bring
Lyon's father to the United States in 1966 and over a period of several years, Lyon's sister and two
brothers were also able to immigrate to the United States with their families.
The 1995 documentary, "When I Was 14: A Survivor Remembers," chronicled Lyon's experi
ence in the Nazi death camps.
Lyon will be speaking at Stanford as part of the observance of Holocaust Remembrance Day.
