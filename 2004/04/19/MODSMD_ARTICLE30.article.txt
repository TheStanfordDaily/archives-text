A week after the Class of 2008 gets its initial glimpse of life
on the Farm, minority alumni representing 47 class years will
arrive on campus toconverse, interact and examine the chang
ing role of diversity in higher education for the first time.
Currently 568 alumni are signed up to take part in "Com
munity, Diversity and Excellence: Celebrating Stanford's Mi
nority Alumni "from April 30 to May 2. The conference, host
ed by the Minority Alumni Task Force, will include panels,
workshops and feature guest speakers, all addressing diversi
ty issues and Stanford's relationship with its minority alumni.
Kellie Elliot, project manager for the task force, said she
hopes the weekend of programming will foster dialogue be
tween alumni and current University leaders.
"Our goal is to further educate and enrich conference

participants through the experience of coming together as a
community and to get alumni involved with the University
and its future," Elliot said. "We hope to show how far we
have come as an institution with regards to this issue and to
establish a better understanding of diversity."
The conference will feature a panel discussion in which
President John Hennessy and Presidents Emeriti Gerhard
Casper, Donald Kennedy and Richard Lyman will speak to
the changing role of racial diversity on campus over the past
30 years. Other featured speakers will include notable alum
ni such as Jerry Yang, the co-founder of Yahoo!, and Mae
Jemison, the first African American woman in space. Addi
tionally, alumnus Supreme Court Justice Stephen Bryer will
speak May 1 in Memorial Auditorium.
"Justice Breyer will address his personal views on his time
here at Stanford and where we stand in relation to diversity
issues," Elliot said. "He may also address diversity issues

from a national point of view and how these issues are being
addressed at different levels."
The conference will culminate the release of the Minori
ty Alumni Task Force's report on alumni relations at Stan
ford, which will make recommendations as to how to ad
dress minority issues on campus. This concludes years of
amassing input from alumni via e-mails and a series of con
ferences between administrators and alumni across the
country called the "Think Again Dialogues."
The main goals of the task force include tackling issues of
faculty and administrative diversity, ethnic demographics at
the student level, cultural programs, course offerings on cam
pus and interaction between alumni and minority students.
"The very idea for this conference stemmed from the re
port furnished by the first Task Force on Minority Alumni
Relations in 1996," Elliot said. "That first task force was es
tablished by then-Provost Condeleeza Rice to 'develop fun

damental recommendations for improving the level of en
gagement between the University and its alumni of color."
The second task force was convened in 2002 to address re
maining tasks listed in that report."
The conference will also showcase culturally oriented
student programs, the firsthand experiences of minority stu
dents, as well as Stanford's history of racial awareness. A
ceremony will be held May 1 to dedicate a plaque in Memo
rial Auditorium commemorating the two civil rights speech
es Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered there in 1964 and 1967.
"The demographics of our current student body and the
fact that last year's freshman class was made up of over 50
percent minority students indicate that Stanford is a school
that promotes and represents diversity," Elliot said. "We
hope that everyone who attends realizes that participation
wherever one lives can contribute to Stanford's growth as a
leader in this field."
