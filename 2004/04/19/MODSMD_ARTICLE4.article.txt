# New Graduate Student Council members face full docket
## Recently elected councilmembers look to opening of GCC, hope to raise graduate students' quality of life 
### BRENDAN SELBY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The newly elected members of the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) say they have a host of issues affecting the entire campus to
address in the coming term, including the opening of the Graduate
Community Center next fall and the implementation of a CalTrain
commuter plan.
The turnover was lower than in most years. Three incumbent rep
resentatives — Alice Lincoln. Moriah Thomason and Chia-da Ha —
were elected to another term.
Steve Allison, the current chair of the GSC, said he believes some
of the candidates who did not win a seat will continue to stay active
in the organization as non-voting members who can hold positions on
committees and even hold certain officer positions.
"There are many non-elected members who are dedicated to the
GSC and they will serve regardless of the election outcome," Allison
said. "Grad students stay with the GSC because the issues we address
are important, and we make strong progress."
The Graduate Community Center that is currently under construc
tion is seen by members as one of the victory's in GSC advocacy.
"In the coming year I would like to continue to support work on the
GCC and also to plan a fantastic party for when it opens next fall,"
Thomason said.
New members said that academic issues will also be a focus of con
cern. Unlike the ASSU Undergraduate Senate, the GSC membership
is divided into districts based on the different schools of study, includ
ing several members who serve the graduate student population at
large. Marcus Folch, who will be serving his first term on the GSC as

the School of Humanities and Sciences district member, said that the
current University practice of not providing teaching positions to doc
toral students in the sixth year or later is overly taxing to those in hu
manities fields.
"It is virtually impossible for anyone to complete a Ph.D. in the hu
manities in five years, particularly if we are also to publish and go onto
the job market during the same time period — or if one's field of study
requires the acquisition of several ancient or non Indo-European lan
guages," Folch said.
Folch said he is also concerned about the low number of under
graduates majoring in the humanities.
"In general, I would like to see Stanford do more to promote un
dergraduate education in fields that are not career-oriented and to
provide real incentives for the research faculty to offer courses which
would interest undergraduates," he said.
Thomason, an at-large winner in the spring election, said that in ad
dition to academic issues, she would like to see the GSC work on cre
ating CalTrain commuter passes, improving graduate student housing
and providing tax relief.
Allison agreed that cost of living was a big issue among grad
uate students.
"The biggest challenge for the GSC is convincing the University that
it needs to invest more in grad student life and services," he said. "The
GSC has to argue to the administration that grad students must be a pri
ority if Stanford is to remain a top research institution."
New members say they hope to build on the successful track record
of GSC lobbying strategies.
"The GSC has made huge strides for grad students in several areas
and I want to contribute to continuing that tradition next year," said
Donna Winston, who is next year's School of Education district member.
Allison said he is pleased with the credentials of the organization's
new members. •
"I am extremely optimistic about the future of the GSC given this
year's incoming membership," he said. "We drew a phenomenal pool
of candidates, and I expect that they will greatly enhance graduate stu
dent life at Stanford."
