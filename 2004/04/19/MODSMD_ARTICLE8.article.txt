# Madrid wins Truman Award, aims to reform foster care
## 
### MARI SUZUKI 
For his commitment to reforming the U.S. foster-care system, Stanford se
nior Johnny Madrid is one of 77 students nationwide to receive the prestigious
Harry S. Truman scholarship.
"This is most exciting to me because it's recognizing the work I've done; not the per
son I am." Madrid said.
The Truman Scholarship is a selective grant awarded to college juniors who
have displayed leadership and who plan to pursue careers in government, non
profit organizations, advocacy, education or public service. The scholarship, creat
ed in honor of former President Truman, provides students with $26,000 scholar
ships for graduate school.
"The Truman Scholarship is for people who plan on entering public service and who
can make a difference," said Laura Selznick, special assistant for diversity outreach to
the vice provost for undergraduate education.
Orphaned at the age of 11, Madrid was placed into the Los Angeles foster care sys
tem. Madrid, who lived in 19 different foster homes, said he overcame many adversi
ties to be the person he is today.
"One of the foster mothers 1 had tried to starve me fora week," Madrid recounted.
He also recalled eating cup ramen for six months, waiting to get picked up after school
for hours, being abandoned in a department store and being discouraged from partic
ipating in school extracurricular activities. " The worst part of it all was having episodes
of feeling a sharp pain in my chest — this horribly lonely feeling, because I felt like no
one cared for me. Some of the foster parents really dehumanize children."
Madrid became involved in foster-youth advocacy in response to his initial shock of
mistreatment and bureaucratic impotence in the foster care system. Although Madrid
repeatedly reported abuse, it was only after he began advising the director of Children
in Family Services in Los Angeles that these homes finally got shut down.

One of Madrid's major challenges at Stanford has been homelessness, with no
house to return to when dormitories close over University breaks. After he confided to
Cheryl Koopman's class about being a former foster care youth and the crisis he faced
when the dorms closed, Koopman — an associate professor of psychiatry and behav
ioral sciences — and her family opened their home to Madrid over the holidays.
"When someone asked him what he does during University breaks, 1 remember
him saying 'that's a problem,' " Koopman said. "So the following academic year, I in
vited Johnny over for Thanksgiving. Johnny was an enthralling public speaker. Every
one in class was so dumbfounded when he mentioned under his breath that he was a
former foster-care youth."
Despite his many obstacles, Madrid — an urban studies major — organized the
Stanford Foster Care College Project, which researches foster youth's pursuit of
secondary education. He has spoken before Congress and played a role in drafting
numerous pieces of legislation for foster kids, among the most notable being the
Foster Youth Bill of Rights and the Vouchers for Foster Youth, which helps kids
attend private schools.
Madrid said he believes improvements in the foster-care system can be achieved
through reforms in the structural organization of the bureaucracy. One desirable change
is to recruit compassionate and competent foster parents and train them to be sustainable.
"I'm optimistic about reforming the foster-care system because I have to
be," Madrid said.
Madrid said he is currently deciding whether to pursue a career in academia or fi
nance. While still firmly committed to reforming the foster-care system, this summer
he will be interning on Wall Street at Goldman, Sachs and Company.
"Right now. I'm at a crossroads in my life," Madrid said. "I thought, maybe I
need something different as a prime career because there's a lot of emotional pain
involved in the advocacy work I do. I hope to fuse my passion for foster advocacy
and social entrepreneurship."
