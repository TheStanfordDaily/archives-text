Kinda low on the 4/20 refer
ences today, huh? Sure, the
bunnies are obviously wasted,
but Classies Guy is goin' around
calling everyone names and
not spreading the love. What

What the hell is that? Better
yet, how did Classies Guy end
up with this big a space to fill,
and better still, why not just
bust out the Gray Box here? All
good questions, soldier. To

to class anyway? And, geez,
could you be any more obvious

Dude, everyone around you
