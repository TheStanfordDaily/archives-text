### ANDREW GAY 
David Rasch, former director of the Stan
ford Help Center, will take over as the new
University ombudsperson in May. His pre
decessor, Lowell Price, retired after one
year in the position who has spent over 25
years at Stanford.

the past nine years. He will continue to live
on campus and play a role in the Stanford
community, with plans to volunteer at the

According to the Ombuds Office, the om
budsperson redresses student grievances, helps re
solve student and bureaucratic disputes and rec
ommends solutions for systemic problems. The
ombudsperson is independent of the University,
working Informally with the president to solve a
variety of problems.
The position of ombudsperson is de
signed to provide different options and re
sources to help faculty, staff and students re
solve issues efficiently outside of court,
Rasch said.
"The role of ombudsperson is to pro
vide a number of channels to resolve
problems, issues and conflicts that come
up in the Stanford community," he added.
"It's a confidential, independent resource
so that people can speak freely about
their situation."
Rasch was selected by a committee head
ed by LaDoris Cordell, vice provost for the

Office of Campus Relations. The committee
decided to do an internal search for the new
ombudsperson and unanimously selected
Rasch for the position, Cordell said.
The committee included Jeff Wachtel,
special assistant to the president and
provost; Debra Zumwalt, general counsel
for the University; Laraine Zappert, direc
tor of the Sexual Harassment Policy Office;
and Chris Yam, human resource officer for
the Office of the President/Provost.
In addition to a bachelor's degree of phi
losophy from Colgate University. Rasch re
ceived a master's degree from the Naropa
Institute and a doctorate from the Califor
nia Institute of Integral Studies. Rasch, in
addition to working at the Help Center
since 1985, runs a psychotherapy practice in
Palo Alto.
Since 1992. Rasch has directed the Stan
ford Help Center, a counseling service for
faculty and staff facing conflicts or problems
related to University life. During his time at
the center, he helped people resolve issues
regarding employee treatment and work at
mosphere.
Rasch said he is enthusiastic about his fu
ture as the University ombudsperson and
that he believes his work at the Help Center
has prepared him well for the challenges of
the position.
"What I'll enjoy the most about being
ombudsperson is being able to serve in a ca
pacity that will hopefully lead to resolving
issues that might otherwise fester or go
through more formal channels, such as
grievances and lawsuits," Rasch said.
"Being ombudsperson is a way to make
people feel that they are being treated fair
ly and justly."
