# Columbia graduate student teaching assts. go on strike
## 
### REBECCA ARONAUER COLUMBIA DAILY SPECTATOR 
(U-WIRE) NEW YORK —For many Columbia University under
classmen on Monday — the first day of the graduate student strike — it
felt like a snow day. Striking graduate students teaching subjects like liter
atures and humanities, contemporary civilization, art humanities, music
humanities, university writing and languages are indefinitely canceling
their meetings.
But for administrators worried about keeping the university running
without teaching assistants, and seniors concerned about receiving this se
mester's credit in time for graduation, the coming weeks have none of the
usual relief of a day off from school.
Last Wednesday and Thursday, 80 percent of participating Graduate
Student Employees United teaching assistants and research assistants
voted to go on strike indefinitely unless Columbia recognizes GSEU as a
union. There has been no communication between the administration and
the strike organizers since GSEU claimed a majority three weeks ago,
when State Sen. David A. Paterson counted union authorization cards.
As GSEU members scramble to make signs and write chants for the
next several weeks of protests, the university has begun to prepare for life
and finals without teaching assistants.
It is unclear just how long the strike will last because University Provost
Alan Brinkley has said the university will wait through the strike for the
National Labor Relations Board ruling on their 2002 appeal, which has de
layed the counting of graduate student and undergraduate teaching assis
tants' ballots for two years.
"If the strike goes past graduation, we'll continue the campaign in the
fall. How it continues will be dependent on a lot of different factors, but it
will continue," said David Carpio, a former graduate student at Columbia
and GSEU spokesman.
Whenever they return, the graduate students have said they will not
grade the papers and exams they missed during their strike. "If we decide
to end the strike in the summer, we're not going to make up struck work,"
said Maurice Leutenger, GSEU member and physics graduate student.

Administrators expect a National Labor Relations Board decision on
Columbia's 2002 appeal. "I would hope that we have an NLRB ruling be
fore the end of the summer and that might be a basis for bringing this to an
end," Brinkley said.
This January, President Bush filled the NLRB's formerly vacant fifth
seat. David Parker, the board's deputy executive secretary, told The
New York Times this weekend that the case will be decided in a matter
of months.
Since the NLRB has yet to rule, Brinkley posted a list of guidelines for
the strike on the Columbia University homepage Friday afternoon. The
general guidelines, which were reworded over the weekend, give professors
extensions for handing in underclassmen's grades, but instruct professors to
submit grades for seniors with enough time for them to be eligible to grad
uate — about three to four days before commencement. Professors of large
lectures will be given extra time to submit underclassmen's grades.
"It is the absolute expectation of the university that all seniors will get
their grades for graduation. We will not accept a faculty member saying i
can't get these grades in before commencement,'" Brinkley said.
The university's commitment to maintaining letter grades for all stu
dents during the strike will create a heavy burden for professors of
large lectures.
In a class like U.S. Era of Reconstruction and Civil War, a 182-person
lecture with a majority of the seven TAs striking, professor Eric Foner
faces the daunting task of grading 182 papers and finals with the help of
only a few TAs. "That means that I will concentrate on the seniors and
then I will deal with the others indue course," Foner said.
Some faculty members feel that the administration's efforts to mini
mize the academic effect on students will prevent the strike from effec
tively impeding the normal functioning of the university, and will instead
place the burden on professors.
"While I support the union's aspirations, it is hard to sympathize with a
strategy that, given the administration's insistence on the submission of
grades no matter what, places all the burden of the strike on faculty inno
cent of the dispute who may have no ability to pressure either side to reach
a fair resolution," a junior faculty member wrote in an e-mail.

The administration's posting made no reference to how the university
and registrar will deal with core and language classes, many sections of
which are taught by TAs. Literature humanities and contemporary civi
lization directors, as well as music, art history, and language department
heads, have asked faculty members to take over the classes of striking TAs
on an "ad-comp" basis — faculty will be given undisclosed sums for tak
ing on the classes of striking graduate students. When or if these professors
will start teaching is unknown; the plan is still tentative.
Further complicating matters, GSEU has not released a list of striking
graduate students. "No union member needs to inform their superiors that
they're going to be on strike," said Jennifer Frank, a fifth-year graduate
student who teaches university writing.
Brinkley does not think the ad-comp policy can be implemented for uni
versity writing, the first-year writing class taught almost exclusively by TAs.
"Those [university writing] classes undoubtedly will not meet," he said.
The university is unsure how many classes need to be filled. "If we can
cover classes and keep them going, we should. If we can't, they don't
meet," Brinkley said. Directors and department heads of the core classes
will decide if classes taught by striking TAs will have finals this semester.
The provost has told department heads they can pursue any legal path to
finishing this semester, including compiling current marks to create a final
grade for an entire core class. "The only option that is not available is not
to give final grades," Brinkley said.
Striking graduate students are required to return grades collected over
the semester to the heads of their departments. Presumably, faculty heads
and Core course administrators will compute grades for students of strik
ing graduate students.
The strike may also affect small classes taught by professors. Last Fri
day, 45 professors signed a letter to President Bollinger urging him to de
termine if a majority of teaching and research assistants want a union or to
withdraw the university's appeal to the NLRB.
Some professors will show their support for the strikers by holding
class off-campus. The university will not arrange these room changes be
cause of liability issues, but will publicize alternate locations for interest
ed faculty.
