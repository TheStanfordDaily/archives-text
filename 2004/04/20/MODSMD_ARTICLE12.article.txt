(U-WIRE) NEW YORK — New York Uni
versity professor and Mexiean presidential hope
ful Jorge Castaneda established some of his cam
paign platforms in Hemmerdinger Hall Thursday,
as he discussed prominent political and scxrial is
sues with Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes.
Castaneda moderated the last of the year
long "Voices of Latin American Leaders" dis
cussion series, which featured Fuentes, who is
known for combining a social consciousness
with his literary exploits.
Castaneda, a Global Distinguished Pro
fessor of politics and Latin American and
Caribbean studies and former foreign minis
ter of Mexico, announced on March 25 he
would run as an independent candidate in
the 2006 presidential election in a two
minute video statement broadcast on Mexi
can television.
"What I think is clear is that with these insti
tutions and these parties. Mexico cannot be ef
fectively and democratically governed," Cas
taheda said during the lecture, which was highly

critical of both the current U.S. and Mexican po
litical climates. "[What Mexico needs is] not
only an independent candidate but an indepen
dent president."
Mexico needs to completely overhaul its edu
cation system at all levels, Castaneda said, arguing
that education is the election's central issue.
His most important change, he said, would
be the reorganization of Mexico's education de
partment to include a ministry of higher educa
tion, science and technology.
Castaneda had the tables turned on him sev
eral times by Fuentes, who pushed the presiden
tial candidate to weigh in on Mexico's political
arid educational state.
"Now I'm interviewing him," Fuentes joked
to the 200-person-plus audience as he ques
tioned Castaneda on the role of the independent
candidate in Mexico.
Both Castaneda and Fuentes, long-time
friends, agreed that under the existing party system,
an effective democracy in Mexico is impossible.
"I think we're going nowhere with the pre
sent party system," Fuentes said. "If you don't
have sufficient, workable political formations
you are going to have chaos."

Castaneda agreed. "We have to change the in
stitutions in order to change the parties," he said.
The current party system is paralyzed by an
authoritarian past, and by deep divisions and in
fighting within the parties, Fuentes said.
"Democracy has not been the rule in Mexi
co," he said. "If you look through the history of
Mexico you will see possible only three in
stances of democratic government."
Despite Castaneda's resignation from his
post as foreign minister only three years into his
six-year appointment, he seemed to hold no
grudges toward current president Vicente Fox,
portraying his administration as one that has
been held hostage by its party, the National Ac
tion Party (PAN).
Fox's weakness was his belief that breaking
through the more than 70-year domination of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
was enough to create change in Mexico, Cas
taneda said.
"The president believed — and this was a
major issue — that you could move Mexico
from totalitarian rule to democratic rule with
the same institutions, the same parties, the same
actors, the same players," he said.

Although he started out as a member of
Mexico's Communist party, Castaneda made
two successive attempts to remove the PRI from
power, first as an advisor to the failed presiden
tial campaign of PRI defector and Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) founder Cuauhte
moc Cardenas, and then as a supporter of the
successful Fox campaign.
Fuentes focused on the impact of a lagging
educational system to technological and indus
trial advancement, adding that Mexico, has lost
its position as second-biggest trading partner
with the United States to China because of its
lack of a technological base.
"Latin America produces only one percent
of the world's scientists," Fuentes said. "It's
ridiculous, and it's tremendous."
This situation is very precarious for the fu
ture of Mexico which risks "being left behind
forever of the kind of scientific and technologi
cal Darwinism with which we cannot catch up,"
he said.
Both Fuentes and Castaneda, however, are
members of a Mexican elite who have experi
enced an educational system worlds apart from
the one they are trying to reform.
