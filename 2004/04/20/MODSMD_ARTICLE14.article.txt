Galaxies may have formed much earlier
The discovery of very ancient galaxies had put the theory of how
the universe evolved into check. Nowadays the cosmos is populat
ed by millions of galaxies but most astronomers believe this was not
the case in the early universe. However, a study published by Povi-

las Palunas and colleagues from the University of
Texas, suggests a massive superstructure in the
universe as early as 2.8 billion years after the Big
Bang. Povilas said the structure is the largest as
tronomers have ever found and contradicts all
models for the early universe. This is the latest in
a series of findings challenging the current mod
els. "What we also have to do now is work hand
in-hand with the theorists," said Gerard Williger
of Johns Hopkins.

Brain protein affects learning, memory
Rutgers scientists announced earlier this year that cypin is criti
cal fora person's learning and memory. Cypin seems to control the
growth of neuron branches. More branches mean the neuron can
receive and relay information from additional sites, which possibly
enhances learning. In a paper published in Nature, the authors also
described how cypin works with tubulin, a major structural protein
in building dendrites (neuron structures). This research has poten
tial applications in treating Alzheimer's disease and learning dis
abilities.
Salmon causes cancer?
Last month's Science journal caused controversy when a
paper alerted that salmon can cause cancer. It suggested that the
fish had high levels of several common carcinogens, accumulated
because of water pollution. Many organizations reacted immedi
ately — the Scottish salmon industry for instance described the
findings as "deliberately misleading." Meanwhile, the re
searchers claim their study was exhaustive and unbiased. Indeed,
the American and Canadian authors sampled 700 wild and
farmed salmon — about two tons — from North America, South
America and Europe.
Sampling comets
On the morning of January 2,2004 of this year, for the first time
a spacecraft collected samples from a comet tail. Armored to with
stand impacts of debris traveling at 13,650 mph, the spacecraft Star
dust met the comet Wild 2 on the other side of the Sun. It obtained
the fast-traveling debris by using aerogel — a silicon-based solid
that is 99.8% empty space, thus over 1,000 times less dense than
glass. Scientists hope that the comet dust can offer valuable clues
about the early solar system, the origin of life and the evolution of
the universe. Stardust also took close shots of the comet, another
first in NASA history. The spacecraft is scheduled to return to
Earth on January 15,2006.
Using lasers to probe atoms
Most processes that happen within atomic nuclei are too fast to
be measured by conventional means. Physicists at Ottawa have
now developed a better method to use lasers to probe such pro
cesses. The proposal builds on techniques to ionize atoms, which
happens on the scale of attoseconds, that is, a billion billionth of a
second. They believe that using a pair of circularly polarized laser
beams traveling in opposite directions (polarized means only work
in a specific signal / frequency) can be used to focus electrons. "The
resulting electron currents are comparable with the currents
achievable at large-scale accelerators," Thomas Brabec, lead au
thor of the study, told Physics Web.
NanoTech @ Stanford
Nanotechnology is the science of miniaturization n from the
smallest possible computers chips to designed drugs that target
cancer. The National Science Foundation recently announced
the creation of a national network for nanotechnology, current
ly consisting of 13 University sites, including Stanford. Professor
Nishi Yoshi, Director of the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility,
said this was a right step in promoting the necessary infrastruc
ture for nanotechnology in the future. Sandip Tiwari, director of
a similar facility in Cornell, similarly applauded the decision to
pursue dismvei v-driven research at a time when most research
is profit-oriented.
