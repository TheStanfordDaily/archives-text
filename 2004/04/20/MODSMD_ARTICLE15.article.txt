# TeamSpace = collaboration
## Stanford's latest collaboration tool 
### SU FEN LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With Team Space, individuals
working on group projects, papers,
presentations, even software pro
grams, need no longer crowd around
a single computer, mouse and key
board. Nor will they face the frus
tration of having to deal with over
written or overlapping changes when
working concurrently but on sepa
rate machines.
"The long-term vision is to deploy
Teamspaces across campus in resi
dence hall computer clusters to offer
students a value-add beyond basic
individual computing," said Clara
Shih, a senior majoring in computer
science who has been working on the
project since fall last year.
Team Space consists of two large
flat-panel displays and a server
which acts as a "group desktop."
Students working on group pro
jects can download and install the
Team Space software onto their lap
tops for immediate connectivity to
the other laptops and to the
workspace.
Group members can concurrent
ly work on the same paper, project
or presentation on the big screen.
They can also instantaneously
share and unshare a document,
image or URL with any number of
people working in the Team Space,
including the group desktop shown
on the big screens.
One important feature of
Team Space is pointer redirection.
To gain control of the public desktop
mouse pointer, the user just needs to
push his or her own pointer up above
the top of his or her own screen and
it will reappear at the bottom of the
public desktop screen.
Another key function is fileshar
ing. Users can drag and drop docu
ments, URLs and other files to and
from all the Team Space computers,
which appear in the Team Space win
dow much like a buddy list "interac
tive filesharing. Individual users can
also send and receive files from
their computer to the public group
desktop displayed on the large
flat-panel screen.
Future enhancements include
enabling "cutting and pasting" to
and from laptops to public desk
tops. (Currently the user must save
his or her work before sending it up
to the public machine.) Participants
from the user studies this week will
also be asked for their suggestions on
further improvements.
Right now, the Team Space setup
is located in the southeast corner of
the Meyer Library lobby on the first
floor. This installation is being paid

for by Stanford Academic Comput
ing, with matching funds from a
Stanford School of Engineering
Dean's Grant. It will be officially
launched to the public on Monday,
April 26.
Throughout this week, user
studies will be conducted to test
the software and user interface.
Two types of studies will be con
ducted. In the first type, partici
pants will work in a team with
three strangers to perform an as
signed task. This involves build
ing a PowerPoint presentation
using components from each
person's laptop. The assigned
task serves as a control, while
differences in usage across dif
ferent people and backgrounds
will be observed.
Pre-established teams who are
currently working on a group pro
ject will be invited for the second
type of study. They will be observed
while using Team Space technology
to work on their current group pro
ject, paper or presentation.
Team Space is a project super
vised by Profs. Armando Fox and
Terry Winograd from the Comput
er Science Department. They be
lieve that changes in Stanford's aca
demic expectations and programs
are creating the need for collabora
tive learning spaces.
"For example, courses in Stan
ford's Program in Writing and
Rhetoric and design courses of
fered by the Center for Design Re
search both require group collabo
ration and problem solving among
student teams," Fox said. "By devel
oping interactive team workspaces,
we can nurture and support these
programmatic ideals being devel
oped in the classroom."
According to Fox, "A typical un
dergraduate student spends only 15-
18 hours a week in the classroom.
Far more time is spent in technology
spaces such as those in libraries and
residences, where learning, research,
and course project collaboration
take place."
"Reflecting national trends, 99
percent of Stanford students own
computers and more than 60 percent
own laptops, relegating computer
clusters to providing high-end ser
vices such as printing and multime
dia rather than e-mail or other tradi
tional applications." Fox said. "Sur
vey results gathered from the 11,000
residential students also reveal a
strong desire for collaborative
spaces enhanced by technology de
signed to further group interaction,"
he added.
Shih was looking fora Computer
Science research project towards the

end of last summer. She wanted to
do something that could make a di
rect impact on society.
"So much of CS research, though
exciting and useful, is very far re
moved from the average user," Shih
said. "It was difficult finding the
right professor and right team, but as
soon as I came across Armando
Fox's I knew my search had come to
a successful end."
After Shih agreed to spearhead
Team Space, Fox and Winograd
formed a new team under their su
pervision, comprising Shih, Jeph
Raymakers, a former CS doctoral
student now working at Microsoft,
and Andy Szybalski, a senior major
ing in CS.
At that time. Prof. Fox had also
forged a close partnership with
David Futey, associate director of
Stanford Academic Computing,
and Richard Holeton, head of Resi
dential Computing, to work in col
laboration with the University ad
ministration to make Team Space
available to Stanford students.

The Team Space project not
only involves Stanford faculty,
staff and students. John Barton,
formerly with Hewlett Packard
labs, helped incubate the idea and
code its early versions. Maria
Crone, a doctoral student from the
Swedish Royal Institute of Tech
nology, is currently helping with
the user studies.
Shih serves a dual technical and
management role.
"Aside from ensuring progress
along all fronts, I am also helping
to run the user studies with Maria,
managing the timeline, deadlines
and schedule, and responsible for
the human subjects protocol appli
cation process," Shih said, "and as
a CS major, I also roll up my
sleeves for some of the bug fixes
and plan to continue development
on the software."
"I definitely think of it as "my
project" and intend to continue
work on it as long as there is work to
be done and I am at Stanford."
Shih added.
