# Husband-wife team develop product that seeks to prevent theft
## 
### MOHAMMED ABDOOLCARIM 
Imagine this scenario: You've taken
your new laptop to Green Library to work
on a paper. After a bathroom break you re
turn back to your desk to notice it missing.
You look around for any sign of the thief,
but all you notice is the seemingly normal
happenings of students studying, unaware
that you have just been a victim of theft.
Such situations may become a thing of
the past with the work of a husband-wife
team. They have developed a product called
the Identifying Security Product, or ISP.
that could prevent theft. One of the inven
tors is Russell Hanabusa, who graduated
with a bachelor's degree in electrical engi
neering from San Jose State and then re
ceived his master's in Electrical Engineer
ing from Santa Clara University. His co-in
ventor, Jennie Hanabusa, received her
bachelor's degree from Stanford in Opera
tions Research, and then graduated with a
master's degree in electrical engineering
from UC-Berkeley.
So how does the product work? The ISP
identifies the attacker with Identifying Ma

terial, or IM, by marking him. A breakable
membrane allows the IM and a tissue sam
pler to spill out and mix the DNA of the vic
tim with the attacker. Police can find the
scattered tissue samplers because each one
has a radio frequency identification, or
RFID tag that can be picked up using a
wireless device.
Once analyzed, these tissue samplers can
prove that there must have been a struggle
between the victim and attacker to allow for
their DNAs to mix. Hence, police can pro
vide conclusive evidence that the attacker is
guilty.
Russell Hanabusa said that the break
through they made was creating a product
that "integrated in [people's] lives." He said
that this was possible because it could be
made "affordable and could be worn as a
daily item."
Jennie Hanabusa added that the product
could be applied to "jewelry, watches and
could be used for handicapped people." She
said that since it was a "very small patch [it
could] protect 24 hours a day."
Size and cost was an important issue for
the Hanabusas. Russell Hanabusa said that

the product's effective cost was about 10
cents, and 100 of the products could fit in
the size of a button. He said that the exact

cost and size "depends on the capabilities
you want." According to him, the product
would be "cheap, require no service fee and
no maintenance." He said the main func
tions of the product was identification and
conviction of the attacker.

Russell said that you could "use [the
product] everywhere and track it any
where." To sum the product up. he said that
it was like taking a DNA sampler and com
bining it with an RFID tag.
The inventors are pursuing patents in
seven countries including the United States,
Japan and Germany, but say that it may be
difficult to enforce their patents in some
countries. The Hanabusas are also holding a
contest for adults and students to submit a
paper describing the marketing context for
their product.
When asked about their roles in the de
velopment of the product, both inventors
said that they "talked with each other and
came up with different approaches and so
lutions." Currently the "[product] is out of
the lab and is going through productiza
tion." They described productization as the
process of combining off-the-shelf compo
nents."
Jennie said that they tried to start their
product in their garage and found that this
did not work for them. Russell now sees that
it would take a "small company to bring [the
product] to market. He also said that he was

"thinking of selling [the product] to some
one who could implement it." He wanted to
use his product to provide jobs in the Unit
ed States.
Russell Hanabusa said that "Stanford
provided the background for us." Jennie
Hanabusa said that her background in Op
erations Research taught her to "solve
problems" and it encouraged her to "look at
problems from different perspectives."
Russell Hanabusa said that behind work,
their biggest passion is invention. When
thinking about working on this product.
He found that the problem of preventing
violence was something that kept coming
back to him.
"It was a problem i could not forget about,"
he said.
The inventing process wasn't without
obstacles, however. Russell Hanabusa said
that in an invention, "you will run up against
a wall." and that inventors have to over
come the technical barriers if they really
want to accomplish their task.
According to Russell Hanabusa, where
others have given up, inventors have to
"keep pushing."
