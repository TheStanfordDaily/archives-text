## Special-fees criteria need review 
### 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate should
not support those portions of the "Pro
posal to Modify the Special Fees Pro
cess" that would undermine the legisla
tive review of special-fees groups. The proposal
argues that "it is unreasonable for the Graduate
Student Council / Undergraduate Senate to have
the power of veto over a group which has been
successful in past years."
Instead, senators should take this proposal, writ
ten by a frustrated student group leader, as a catalyst
to evaluate this year's review criteria. The Senate
needs to clarify the review process — without losing
sight of its accountability for student group place
ment on the special-fees ballot.

It is the Senate's consti
tutional responsibility to re
view groups belore endors
ing their placement on the
elections ballot. Most crite
ria that were used this year
by the Senate's Appropria
tions Committee are valu
able in considering the
placement of a student
group on the ballot. These
criteria include such impor
tant considerations as cam-

opportunity to develop criteria more sensitive to

stance, the Senate could re-evaluate its position in
relation to direct service groups: Currently, all
community service groups fall outside the "De
clared Statement of Purpose for Special Fees."
Even if ballot eligibility continues to be deter

should not in and of itself render a community
service organization ineligible. Barrio Assis

pants every year, and its additional off-campus
impact should not work against the organiza
tion's case for receiving special fees. More careful
consideration of a service group's on-campus im
pact during next year's review process could help
make for more judicious evaluations.
Both the high special-fees refund rates and
the use of groups' reserve monies to cover
shortcomings in the special-fees buffer fund
show the need for strict legislative review of
special-fees requests. But it is not enough for
the Senate to simply register an opinion on each
group that hopes to obtain special fees. It also
must make sure that its views are recognized
and considered by the student body.

For example, if the Sen
ate wishes to improve the
system, it should do so by
working with next year's
Elections Commission to
have the on-line ballot
better identify which
groups the Senate has ve
toed. This year's ambigu
ous coding system did not
clearly represent that ad
ditional information to
student voters, and the

coding may have confused some.
The Senate should draw a more clear distinc
tion between those groups that met the Senate's
endorsement to get on the ballot and those that
petitioned the student body to get on the ballot.
By doing so. the Senate could facilitate voters'
ability to discriminate between groups. This may
assuage the financial crisis of our student fund
ing system.
Special-fees issues are far from resolved. In
order to address the problems, the ASSU must
further develop the criteria it uses to review stu
dent groups and improve its administration of
funds to serve student groups while remaining at
tentive to financial realities.
