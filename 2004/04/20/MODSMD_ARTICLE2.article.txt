In recognition of academic and extracurricular achievement, five Stanford
students have recently won prestigious international scholarship awards to pro
mote international understanding and intellectual exchange, especially in the
arenas of language and communications.
Senior Jessica Savannah Lengsfelder and alumnus Brad Selby, Class of "02,
received the English Speaking Union Award, which is intended to foster friend
ly exchange using the English language and provide students with educational
opportunities in the United Kingdom.
Senior Andrea Bohlman.graduate student Jesse Kauffman and senior Kris
tine Yu won the German Academic Exchange Award, an honor given by a
German government office that encourages student exchange between Ger
many and the rest of the world.
"Both awards support a student's academic goals in either Germany or the
United Kingdom," said Bechtel International Center Director John Pearson.
"Both the German Academic Exchange Service and the English Speaking
Union also hope that the students will develop an interest in maintaining a long
term relationship with the country in which they study."
Bohlman, who is majoring in music with concentrations in music history and
violin performance, applied because she knew she wanted to return to Europe
after spending six months at the Stanford Overseas Studies Program in Berlin.
"The scholarship I received funds one year of research in Germany for grad
uating seniors," Bohlman said. "I'll spend the year in Berlin, studying at the
Humboldt University and researching the project I proposed in my application:
a study of the East German composer Hanns Eisler and his reception in Berlin
today and since the reunification of Germany."
Lengsfelder, an International Relations and Economics double major with
minors in Latin American Studies and Spanish said that she is also currently
completing honors in International Security Studies.
"After working at the United States Treasury Department last fall with
Stanford In Washington I realized that what the developing world needs is not
more economists telling them how to spend their money, rather, they need ad
vice on how to establish or improve the institutions and infrastructure that are
necessary for every level of political, social and economic functioning," she said.
Lengsfelder said she never thought
she had a chance at winning the award.
"When I was notified that I had
been selected for an interview, the let
ter warned that the award was very
competitive and they had an extreme
ly large applicant pool," she said.
Next yearÂ«,Lengsfelder will pursue
a master's degree in governance and
development at the University of Sus

sex's Institute for Development Stud
ies with the help of a $15,(XX) award to
cover tuition and living expenses.
Yu, a senior majoring in chemistry
and minoring in physics, said she ap
plied because she has always loved
German language and culture.
"Perhaps more importantly,
there's some hot research going on
there in nonlinear biochemical sys
tems I wanted to get involved in," she
said. The award provided her with the
funding for her research.
Selby graduated in 2002 with ma

jors in art history and English. He
plans to use the award money to study
fora master's degree in modern Euro
pean history at Oxford next year.
"It is always a pleasure to hear
that students have been awarded
scholarships to assist them in their
studies overseas," Pearson said. "I
think it is great news for the students
and for Stanford. It is a reflection of
the academic life students experience
at Stanford and the strong support
faculty give to students in their goals
of further study."
