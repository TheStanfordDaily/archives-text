## Election should be certified 
### STEVE ALLISON 
The right to speak freely and the
right to vote are perhaps the most
fundamental freedoms of our
democratic society. With those
freedoms, however, come some
equally fundamental responsibili
ties. Student leaders who are decid
ing how to proceed with this year's
scandal-filled ASSU executive elec
tion need to honor these basic free
doms and ask the student body to
take greater responsibility for the
electoral process.
Despite the unsavory behavior of
the ASSU slates, the Undergradu
ate Senate and Graduate Student
Council (GSC) have no compelling
reason to throw out the election.
The reason is quite simple: The
ASSU Constitution — modeled
after the U.S. Constitution — guar
antees the right to free speech. Arti
cle I, Section 3.2 states, "The Asso
ciation shall enact no legislation
abridging the freedom of speech,"
which — according to Constitution
al Council rulings from 1999 and
2003 — includes the Campaign
Practice Code.
Just as candidates for the U.S.
Senate, House of Representatives
and presidency have the right to
slander, insult and criticize their op
ponents, so do ASSU candidates
under its constitution. Just as spam
mers can (somewhat) legally fill
your in-box with unsolicited mes
sages, so can ASSU candidates and
their supporters. In short, the ASSU
Constitution protects a candidate's
right to receive endorsements and
engage in obnoxious free speech.
Imagine if the U.S. Senate tried to
overturn a presidential election for
excessive mudslinging.
I understand that students are
frustrated by the current situation.
People are sick and tired of election
scandals, and they would prefer that
candidates stick to the Campaign

Practice Code and — even better —
the issues. I couldn't agree more.
Campaign violations happen every
year, and they undermine the credi
bility of the candidates and the en
tire ASSU. It is tempting to throw
out this election and teach everyone
a lesson, once and for all.
Unfortunately, nullifying the
election does not fix the problem,
nor does it teach any useful lesson.
As long as the Constitution allows
free speech, the Campaign Practice
Code and the Elections Commission
will not have the authority to stop
campaign-related e-mails and activ
ities. Even if this election is thrown
out, violations will happen again —
maybe as soon as the special elec
tion — because the Campaign Prac
tice Code has no teeth.
I've heard the argument that the
ASSU needs to "get tough" on cam
paign violations in order to deter fu
ture misconduct and restore the
credibility of the ASSU. This argu
ment is analogous to the politician
who vows to get tough on crime
without addressing its cause. Most
psychologists agree that the threat
of punishment is a poor deterrent
for law-breakers, and in our case,
the "law" itself is unconstitutional.
So where does this leave us? The
credibility of the ASSU has already
been damaged, and cannot be easily
restored by redoing the election.
Fortunately, we have other options
available to reclaim the integrity of
the election process and the ASSU.
We can encourage students to ex
ercise the right to free speech wisely.
Just because you can doesn't mean
you should send 12,000 unsolicited
e-mails to the student body. Candi
dates in every election — from the
ASSU to the U.S. presidency —
should recognize that certain types
of speech, while free, are not always
appropriate. Anyone can get a best
buddy to e-mail an endorsement,
but wouldn't voters be more im

pressed with a slate that announced
a plan for improving student life?
As citizens of a democracy, mem
bers of the student body are also re
sponsible for the integrity of the
elections process. If campaign ethics
are important to you, then run for
office next year and promise not to
exercise your right to unlimited free
speech. As a voter, learn the issues
and make candidates focus on them,
rather than on mudslinging. Do not
reward bad behavior — if we have a
special election, you had better vote
for The Chappie's slate if you found
the first campaign disturbing.
Ideally, we can rely on individu
als to conduct themselves with in
tegrity. Failing that, we as a student
body may need to establish reason
able limitations on free speech.
Specifically, we might consider
amending the ASSU Constitution to
define where free speech ends and
invasion of privacy begins, much as
national anti-spam legislation is at
tempting to do. We might ask candi
dates voluntarily to sign an agree
ment to be disqualified if they vio
late the Campaign Practice Code.
Candidates could refuse to sign, and
thereby retain their constitutional
right to violate the Code, but voters
would know in advance which can
didates are holding themselves to a
higher standard.
Next year's election process will
only improve if candidates and vot
ers acknowledge their democratic
rights and obligations. In the mean
time, this year's election is over, and
the Undergraduate Senate and the
GSC should let it stand.
