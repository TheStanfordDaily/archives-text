## ASSU should not certify vote 
### SOHINI RAMACHANDRAN 
Having observed six ASSU elec
tions at Stanford, I can comfortably
conclude that no election takes
place perfectly. The Undergraduate
Senate and the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) are at an important
crossroads this week, with the
power to certify or nullify this year's
executive election.
The joint by-laws of the ASSU
state that "Grounds for not certify
ing an election shall include, but
need not be limited to, deviations
that were avoidable and could possi
bly have affected the outcome of
any issue in the election." Based on
the alleged campaign violations that
have taken place, and in the interest
of the future of the ASSU, the Sen
ate and the GSC should not certify
this year's executive election.
The ASSU Constitution does,
and obviously should, protect free
dom of speech, even in seedy forms
such as mudslinging while cam
paigning. Further, Stanford students
should not allow their decisions to
be clouded by poor campaign prac
tices and should instead vote in an
informed manner for the best possi
ble representatives.
These undeniably solid arguments
have been repeated to me often as
reasons the election should be certi
fied. But I believe that these points of
view are based on the fact that, de
spite the frustrations surrounding this
year's election, most students just
want to move on. Certifying the elec
tion, while citing that a special elec
tion would accomplish nothing as the
damage has already been done, is the
easy course of action.
But can we really move forward
from this year's election scandals?
Amid the current brouhaha sur

rounding the Fundamental Stan
dard, e-mail lists and the semantics
of endorsement, the importance of
these elections — and of the ASSU
— is being lost. It's time for both the
active leaders in the ASSU and the
general student body to use the
power we have been given to maxi
mize the effectiveness of our repre
sentatives to the administration.
Whenever an election scandal oc
curs, the ability for students to be
represented effectively to the rest of
the University community is com
promised, perhaps irreparably so.
The Senate and the GSC should send
a message that this cannot be tolerat
ed. Another concern is that many
students seem to feel they are unaf
fected by whomever serves as ASSU
president — or worse, that students
only want to be elected to improve
their resumes. In certifying the elec
tion, I believe the Senate and the
GSC would implicitly underscore
this idea that it ultimately doesn't
matter who is elected or how.
There will never be a perfect
presidential candidate, with whom
every student and student group
identifies and who has. by junior or
senior year, garnered the respect of
various facets of the administration.
Even the most effective ASSU lead
ers need time to acclimate them
selves to their roles.
The Senate and the GSC need to
consider if the student body can be
effectively represented by a slate
that begins its term under the cur
rent auspices. If we don't take our
elections seriously, how will the fac
ulty, staff and administration of the
University take our student repre
sentatives seriously? If large por
tions of the student body feel alien
ated from or indifferent toward the
ASSU, what strides can really be

made to improving student life and
the student voice on campus?
I urge the members of the Senate
and the GSC not to base their deci
sion on what is convenient, but on
what is right. The fear of the logistics
surrounding a special election should
not be the reason the election is cer
tified. ASSU Elections Commission
er Ellie Martin stated, "Our consen
sus was that in the end the results
should stand, because it would be
detrimental to campus politics and
the image of the ASSU if we didn't
certify 1 ' ("Election certification still
far from certain," April 14). I hope
the Senate and the GSC will also con
sider whether certifying the results
will only reinforce student dissatis
faction surrounding the election.
I further entreat students not to
throw their hands up in disgust if a
special election transpires, but in
stead to rise to the opportunity, ei
ther underscoring their previous
votes or changing their choice based
on the issues that matter to them.
Ultimately, once this issue has
been laid to rest, we need to show
the University community that
Stanford students take their repre
sentation seriously. We should chal
lenge elected students throughout
their tenure to do their respective
jobs well. The Stanford student
voice should be a force to be reck
oned with, and the nullification of
this year's election gives us the
chance to emphasize this and move
forward, not just in the short term,
but in the long run as well.

does not have a vote on the GSC until
the election is certified.
