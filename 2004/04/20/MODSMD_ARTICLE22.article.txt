Op-ed on Iraq was deceptive
Peter Berkowitz's op-ed on Iraq ("The
case for the war in Iraq," April 16) challenges
readers at Stanford on a number of fronts.
To begin with, Berkowitz signs the piece
as an associate professor of law at the
George Mason University School of Law
and a research fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. He does not disclose, however, his gov
ernment service as a consultant in the Presi
dent's Council on Bioethics. So appreciative
he is of the president, actually, that he paint
ed him a favorable portrait in The Boston
Globe ("George W. Bush isn't the fire
breathing reactionary liberals love to hate,"
The Boston Globe, Aug. 10). Reasonable
people can differ, indeed. But they usually
agree on this: to heap praise (in-between
the lines, as Berkowitz does) on the policies
of your boss from the academic pulpit is un
derstood as a conflict of interest and
amounts to dishonesty.
Second, he offers to reflect on the Iraq
war a year after the invasion. However,
most of the material derives from his Boston
Globe article of eight months ago. Assum
ing that Berkowitz is not an agenda sales
man, reasonable people might think he is
not in touch with reality. Someone with his
close ties to the Middle East should have
easily registered the alarming deterioration
in Iraq these past weeks (Shiites and Sunnis
are uniting against the Americans, Spanish
troops are being withdrawn from Iraq, for
eign civilians are being abducted and, of
course, the U.S. forces alone count 700 casu
alties). What is the purpose of writing an op
ed on Iraq if you don't even know what's
happening in Iraq?
Third, Berkowitz himself lists this edito

rial elsewhere as a "Hoover Institution
Weekly Essay, syndicated by Knight-Rid
der." Reasonable people might ask: If
Berkowitz can air his views in national out
lets like The Weekly Standard and The
Jerusalem Post, why does he have to occupy
the precious limited space of our campus
newspaper? Besides, are we short of quality
writers and solid researchers? Or do we lack
scholars who can think for themselves?

Review should accept some responsibility
for MEChA's loss of special fees
The Stanford Review needs to stop using
MEChA as a scapegoat and start acknowl
edging its own responsibility in denying the
Chicano / Latino community its ASSU spe
cial fee. Instead of blaming MEChA's name
for preventing the organization from receiv
ing special fees, it should applaud its own
anti-special-fee campaign begun last year
(running ads on its Web site and in its publi
cation urging students to take back their
special fees), through which The Review es
pecially targeted ethnic organizations be
cause of their involvement in demonstrating
against the war in Iraq.
There have been many editorials written
in response to the inflammatory anti-
MEChA propaganda The Review has been
opportunistically spreading (comparing
MEChA to the KKK. a white supremacist
terrorist organization proliferating racial vi
olence) since the California recall elections
campaign accused Cruz Bustamante of
being affiliated with MEChA. These edito
rials clarified that MEChA's motto is "La

Union Hace La Fuerza," which means
"Unity Makes Strength," and that any
ethno-centric 1960s rhetoric is now ideolog
ically outdated.
On the Stanford campus, MEChA has
historically stood for unity by forming multi
racial coalitions (such as the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition) to run campaigns for so
cial justice. MEChA has also contributed an
array of campus-wide cultural events to
Stanford. The Review does not seem to un
derstand MEChA's history and evolution.
Further, The Review does not show sensi
tivity to how the political climate in Califor
nia, on campus and throughout the nation
has affected dynamics in the Latino commu
nity and even affected the definition of
racism. Don't buy into The Review's cheap
propaganda ... With an ethnic community
having lost one third of its funding, igno
rance is too expensive to afford.

Attacks on MEChA are unwarranted, faulty
1 have been very troubled by the recent
attacks on MEChA that specifically focus
on the organization's "racist" ideology.
Whether manifested in the rants of Bill
O'Reilly, the campaign controversy sur
rounding Cruz Bustamante's college in
volvement in MEChA or the Bruin Repub
licans at UCLA running a paid advertise
ment against MEChA, the rhetoric of these
attacks is the same — MEChA should de
nounce its racist past.
The Stanford Review has also adopted
this rhetoric, and its faulty ideology was re
inforced in yesterday's letter to the editor

("MEChA should be replaced," April 19). It
concerns me that such ignorance is so preva
lent at Stanford. Gary Raichart and Michael
Hasper never illustrated how MEChA is a
racist organization in their letter. They
chose to focus exclusively on the content of
the founding documents, and they did not
even prove that these were racist. They
make critiques of MEChA while only hav
ing a general understanding of the impor
tance of the group to the Chicano / Latino
community. They simply celebrate the loss
of funding.
In addition, Raichart, Hasper and The
Review have backed themselves into a cor
ner with their attacks. Another historical
document, the U.S. Constitution, classifies
blacks as 3 / 5 of a person. Following their
aforementioned logic, I am waiting for
Raichart, Hasper and The Review to de
nounce this document as racist and move to
ward enditig the existence of the United
States as we know it... or does that sugges
tion perhaps sound a little harsh?
Instead of a triumph over racism,
Raichart, Hasper and The Review are trying
to destroy a pillar of the Chicano / Latino
community. They should direct their atten
tions more constructively.

Sexism seems implicit in questions
of interracial dating
Sentiment against interracial dating con
tains a dangerous undercurrent of sexism
that is hardly ever addressed. I was appalled
by comments in yesterday's article "The

(racial) dating game" (April 19), where re
spondents referred to women as chattel, an
item to be stolen or a market to be intruded
upon. Just because I am of Chinese descent,
no Chinese man is entitled to date me by
virtue of our similar cultural and racial her
itage. In fact, no one of any racial back
ground is entitled to date me because I am
not property to be owned, and I am not a
good to be traded in a market. Those who
have problems with interracial dating
should examine their own beliefs toward
women and take responsibility for sexist at
titudes rather than hiding behind the curtain
of cultural and racial perpetuation. Maybe
once you treat women as equals rather than
merely paying lip service to women's equal
ity, you'll get a date.

British reader takes issue with Intermission's
coverage of David Bowie
Odd article about David Bowie
("David Bowie: Lost in Space," April 16):
Why is the writer reviewing a five-year
old album? And if the writer is trying to
make a point, it's a good idea to fact
check. Lazy journalist — "Little Wonder"
is from 1997's "Earthling" album, not
2002's "Heathen." I am a journalist, inci
dentally, and articles like this irritate me
because they are so poorly written. I'm all
for living in the past — I wish I'd been
alive when Bowie was Ziggy too — but
this dull piece of writing is no way to
evoke this bygone era.

Review should accept some responsibility
for MEChA's loss of special fees
The Stanford Review needs to stop using
MEChA as a scapegoat and start acknowl
edging its own responsibility in denying the
Chicano / Latino community its ASSU spe
cial fee. Instead of blaming MEChA's name
for preventing the organization from receiv
ing special fees, it should applaud its own
anti-special-fee campaign begun last year
(running ads on its Web site and in its publi
cation urging students to take back their
special fees), through which The Review es
pecially targeted ethnic organizations be
cause of their involvement in demonstrating
against the war in Iraq.
There have been many editorials written
in response to the inflammatory anti-
MEChA propaganda The Review has been
opportunistically spreading (comparing
MEChA to the KKK. a white supremacist
terrorist organization proliferating racial vi
olence) since the California recall elections
campaign accused Cruz Bustamante of
being affiliated with MEChA. These edito
rials clarified that MEChA's motto is "La

Union Hace La Fuerza," which means
"Unity Makes Strength," and that any
ethno-centric 1960s rhetoric is now ideolog
ically outdated.
On the Stanford campus, MEChA has
historically stood for unity by forming multi
racial coalitions (such as the Stanford Labor
Action Coalition) to run campaigns for so
cial justice. MEChA has also contributed an
array of campus-wide cultural events to
Stanford. The Review does not seem to un
derstand MEChA's history and evolution.
Further, The Review does not show sensi
tivity to how the political climate in Califor
nia, on campus and throughout the nation
has affected dynamics in the Latino commu
nity and even affected the definition of
racism. Don't buy into The Review's cheap
propaganda ... With an ethnic community
having lost one third of its funding, igno
rance is too expensive to afford.

Attacks on MEChA are unwarranted, faulty
1 have been very troubled by the recent
attacks on MEChA that specifically focus
on the organization's "racist" ideology.
Whether manifested in the rants of Bill
O'Reilly, the campaign controversy sur
rounding Cruz Bustamante's college in
volvement in MEChA or the Bruin Repub
licans at UCLA running a paid advertise
ment against MEChA, the rhetoric of these
attacks is the same — MEChA should de
nounce its racist past.
The Stanford Review has also adopted
this rhetoric, and its faulty ideology was re
inforced in yesterday's letter to the editor

("MEChA should be replaced," April 19). It
concerns me that such ignorance is so preva
lent at Stanford. Gary Raichart and Michael
Hasper never illustrated how MEChA is a
racist organization in their letter. They
chose to focus exclusively on the content of
the founding documents, and they did not
even prove that these were racist. They
make critiques of MEChA while only hav
ing a general understanding of the impor
tance of the group to the Chicano / Latino
community. They simply celebrate the loss
of funding.
In addition, Raichart, Hasper and The
Review have backed themselves into a cor
ner with their attacks. Another historical
document, the U.S. Constitution, classifies
blacks as 3 / 5 of a person. Following their
aforementioned logic, I am waiting for
Raichart, Hasper and The Review to de
nounce this document as racist and move to
ward enditig the existence of the United
States as we know it... or does that sugges
tion perhaps sound a little harsh?
Instead of a triumph over racism,
Raichart, Hasper and The Review are trying

Sexism seems implicit in questions

Sentiment against interracial dating con

that is hardly ever addressed. I was appalled
by comments in yesterday's article "The

(racial) dating game" (April 19), where re
spondents referred to women as chattel, an
item to be stolen or a market to be intruded
upon. Just because I am of Chinese descent,
no Chinese man is entitled to date me by
virtue of our similar cultural and racial her
itage. In fact, no one of any racial back
ground is entitled to date me because I am
not property to be owned, and I am not a
good to be traded in a market. Those who
have problems with interracial dating
should examine their own beliefs toward
women and take responsibility for sexist at
