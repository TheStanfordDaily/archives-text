## Bonds can't hold a candle to Ruth's impact 
### 
I had waited all week for this. My family
packed into our 1985 Volvo station wagon,
headed south on 101 and turned the dial to
KNBR 680: The Sports Leader. It was one
of my favorite days of the season, a free give
away day, when all fans 12 or younger would get
a Giants hat. a plastic glove or a couple of wrist
bands. But bat day was always the best, getting
my hands on a thrilling, giant, wooden bat that I
had no business swinging until I got some
steroids of my own.
In fact, so infatuated with my new slugger,
and yet so mortified that my little brother
would steal it by the third inning, I had to resort
to measures I would not see again until years
later in a Volkswagen commercial. Before the
Giants could even come up to bat, I did the one
action that supersedes all "shotgun," "fives,"
"tap-tap," "hosey," "minutes" and "mine" calls.
Just as the young professional claims his
Jetta, 1 licked that bat. It was mine. And it was
a true testament to how much I loved the San
Francisco Giants.
I'm from the Bay Area. My childhood heroes
were Will Clark, Matt Williams

and Robby Thompson. I went
to Game Four of the World Se
ries two years ago. The damn
password for my fantasy base
ball league was "barryisgod!"
But here's the point of my
column: I'm not a fan of Barry
Bonds.
With Bonds passing Willie
Mays on the all-time home run
list, America has been bom-

barded with a plethora of columns, articles and
soundbytes praising the Giants' left fielder.
ESPN.com polls have asked readers whether he
is the greatest baseball player ever, shortsight
ed news anchors have overblown his accom
plishments and, in perhaps the most vomit-in
ducing baseball moment since Cal Ripken was
served a grapefruit in his final All-Star game,
Willie Mays actually handed his godson a torch.
There are reasons why your English teacher
told you to avoid cliches. If they are going to lit
erally "pass the torch" every time Bonds breaks
a record, all I ask is that when Bonds retires,
Mays gives him a giant fork so we can all collec
tively say, "Stick a fork in him, he's done."
I am phenomenally impressed by Barry,
don't get me wrong. Watching him hit is consis
tently spectacular. He makes opposing pitchers'
strikeout pitches look like meatballs. Any pitch,
at any location and any speed, has a chance to
be crushed. He is the toughest out in Major
League Baseball and currently the best hitter in
the game, without question.
However, don't tell me he's the greatest
player of all time. He never will be. You know
it, I know it, the American people know it.
Even if Barry hits 900 home runs, even if he
wins a World Series, hell, even if he joins my
"Tom Emanski's Defensive Drills All-Stars"
1M Softball team and carries us to Division I
supremacy, he will still not come close to being
the greatest player ever, no matter how many
MVFs he might have. George Herman Ruth
was just too good.
In fact, I didn't realize how good until I really
looked at the stats.
Babe Ruth led the American League in
home runs 12 times, ended with a career batting
average of .342 and is, of course, second on the
all-time home-run list with 714.
But wait, there's more.
What was truly remarkable about Ruth was
not just his stats, but his impact on the game as
a whole. Before Ruth appeared, home runs
were very rare, with batters primarily focused
on getting the ball in play, but not hitting for
power. Ruth changed all that. In 1920, his sec
ond season as a full-time batter, he hit 54
home runs, greater than the totals of any other
American League team except his own and the
Philadelphia Phillies. The next highest slugger
hit 19. In essence, Babe Ruth swung for the
fences every time he was at bat, and his suc
cess motivated other hitters to imitate him,
causing the amount of runs per American
League game to rise from 7.9 in Pre-Ruth
times to 10.2 in 1921.
Think I'm done yet? Hardly.
In his banner year of 1929, Ruth hit 60 home
runs, which was 14 percent of the total for the
American League in that year. To do that today
would require a hitter to belt over 300 home
runs in one season.
Finally, let's also not forget that Ruth could
have had a Hall of Fame career without even
touching a bat. In 1,220 and 1 / 3 career in
nings pitched, Ruth had an ERA of 2.28. He
really only had three years as a true starting
pitcher, and in those years he went 18-8, 23-12
and 24-13.
Ruth changed the game. He took baseball
from its all-time low after the Black Sox scandal
and made it entertaining again. He showed
dominance at the plate and on the mound and
made his Yankees team a dynasty for the ages.
He was the best. Not Jordan, not Ali, not Gret
zky and certainly not Bonds.
I love the Giants. I respect Barry. But in the
end, I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I
ever get my hands on a Babe Ruth rookie card,
you can consider it licked.
