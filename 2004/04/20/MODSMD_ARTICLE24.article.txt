# No. 2 Cardinal hosts Gaels
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
On paper, the St. Mary's baseball squad is no
match for No. 2 Stanford (29-5, 7-2 Pacific-10 Con
ference). The Gaels have a dismal 11-27 overall
record and tonight's face-off at Sunken
Diamond, the team has won only one of its 14 con
tests away from home.
The lopsided matchup seems on the surface to be a
trivial, unimportant game for the Pac-10 leading Car
dinal, which is coming off a sweep of rival California.
For some Stanford players, tonight's non-league
clash will resemble a warm-up for tougher Pac-10
competition. For the squad's relievers, however,
facing St. Mary's is a nine-inning battle for time on
the mound.
A friendly battle, that is.
Weekday games have become the most crucial
opportunity for the bullpen to show it has the poise
to pitch in a conference series.
"It's a healthy competition," said head coach
Mark Marquess. "We want you to do well [on week
days] so you can take someone's spot [on the week
end]. It's ruthless, but it's the nature of the game."
Sophomore Matt Manship was the most recent
Cardinal to shine in the competitive arena of a
weekday stint. The righthander threw two score
less innings against San Jose State three weeks
ago, which, according to Marquess, proved his
arm was ready for the Pac-10. Manship followed
up with his longest, most impressive outing of the
season at Oregon State, tossing 4 1/3 scoreless
innings in relief.
Though Stanford and St. Mary's have yet to
name starters for tonight. Marquess said that Man
ship will likely pitch, in addition to junior Mark
Jecrnen and freshmen Matt Leva and Greg
Reynolds. He mentioned that freshman Jeff Stimp
son and senior David O'Hagan may also come out
of the bullpen.
"We're not saving anybody since we're not play
ing league games this weekend," Marquess said. "So
if someone is going well, we'll let them go four or
five [innings]."
Tonight would be a prime time to mount a solid
five-inning performance, as last weekend's Califor
nia series reinforced the "work-in-progress" nature
of the Stanford pitching staff.
Freshman Blake Holler faltered in his Sunday
start, allowing three hits, three free passes and two
runs in just 12/3 innings of work. While the show
ing may not strip Holler of his starting job —
sophomore starter Jeff Gilmore experienced a sim
ilarly rough start a week before throwing the
squad's first complete game against Cal — it cer
tainly is a reminder that there are no guarantees on
this pitching staff.
"Everyone's competing harder," Leva said of the
mentality entering tonight's matchup. "Everyone
knows that there's internal competition when a
starter doesn't throw as well.
"But it's friendly," he said with a smile.
While the pitchers fight for playing time, other
players will be taking the opportunity to rest. Mar
quess said that junior catcher Donny Lucy — who

has started all but one of the season's games — may
sit out tonight while sophomore John Hester takes
over behind the plate.
Other than that, it should be business as usual
for the Cardinal, which trounced St. Mary's 7-4
in the teams' March meeting. Both teams col
lected double-digit hit totals — the Gaels actu
ally out-hit Stanford 14-13 — but St. Mary's
number of men left on base also stood in the
double digits.
Gaels starter Dane Dobrinich (0-6) took the loss
in that contest, serving up four pitches that Stan
ford hitters sent out of the park — senior Brian
Hall, junior Danny Putnam and sophomores Jed
Lowrie and John Mayberry Jr. each recorded
round-trippers.

Now, the second time around, St. Mary's will have
the challenge of harnessing the Cardinal bats, which
have combined this season to post a .326 average.
St. Mary's infielder Bryan Byrne poses the
biggest offensive threat to the Stanford defense, as
he is hitting at a .345 clip in the Gaels' number three
spot. (For the sake of comparison, Byrne would
only be ranked sixth in batting average if he played
for Stanford.)
Leadoff man Michael Harris could also prove an
asset to the Gaels if he can duplicate his previous
performance against the Cardinal. The second base
man got an early read on Stanford's pitchers last
month and went 4-for-5 on the night.
The opening pitch of the contest is scheduled for
6 p.m. tonight at Stanford's Sunken Diamond.

Senior David O'Hagan pitched 5 1/3 innings of scoreless relief in Stanford's 8-3 win over California on Sunday.
O'Hagan may see more action tonight against St. Mary's, as Stanford head coach Mark Marquess plans to give several
Cardinal relivers a look in the non-conference tilt at Sunken Diamond.
