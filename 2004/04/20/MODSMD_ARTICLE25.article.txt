# Luchini, Lambie set school records to spark Cardinal track at Mt. San Antonio relays
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
What did it take for senior Louis Luchini to
break the Stanford school record in the 5,000 meters
— a record previously held by four-time NCAA
Champion and 2000 Olympian Brad Hauser?
Thirteen minutes and 25.19 seconds of some of
the best running in school history.
Racing against some of the nation's and world's
top athletes, Luchini placed fifth in the Mt. San An
tonio College Relays invitational 5,000.
Stanford alumnus Jonathan Riley won the race,
posting the fastest time in the world this year and an
Olympic qualifying 13:21.16. Riley ran a blazing
56.4-second final lap to take the win over Arizona's
Robert Cheseret.
Luchini's time is currently No. 2 in the U.S. and
No. 5 in the world.
"Louis's performance in the 5,000 was definitely
one of the best of the meet," said head men's coach
Robert Weir. "That was a school record by two sec
onds, a great performance by him."
The women's invitational 5,000 proved even
more exciting than the men's race as Providence's
Kim Smith, the indoor collegiate record holder at
that distance, raced North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan to the wire but came up short, 15:09.69
to 15:09.72.
Both women missed the targeted Olympic qual
ifying standard by just one second.
Redshirt sophomore Alicia Craig finished sev
enthin 15:31.15afterrunningwith the third packfor
almost the entire race.
Junior Sara Bei finished 10th in 15:36.21, a per
sonal best by almost 30 seconds, moving her to
fourth all-time at Stanford in the event.
Earlier in the day. redshirt sophomore Ryan Hall
made his collegiate debut in the S,(XX), placing sec
ond in the university division race to New Mexico's
Matt Gonzalez, one of the nation's top 10,000-meter
runners. Hall's mark of 13:45.00 ranks him eighth
all-time at Stanford.
In the women's 1,500 the following night, fresh
man Ari Lambie set the pace for the Cardinal,
recording the fastest time of the night and a fresh
man school record of 4:16.89.
Lambie, the third-fastest prep miler ever, seems
to have adjusted well to collegiate racing, setting the
freshman school record and finishing as the top col
legian in both of her 1,500 races this year.
Fellow freshman Katy Trotter ran a Regional

qualifying time of 4:26.06 in the 1,500 to finish fifth
in her heat.
Two Cardinal men also posted Regional qualify
ing times in the 1,500. Sophomore Jacob Gomez ran
3:46.53 to place second in his heat while senior Andy
Powell continued his comeback, setting a season
best for the third time this year by running 3:46.90 to
finish third in his heat.
On the final day, redshirt junior Don Sage made
his season debut, coming in fourth in the elite mile
in 4:01.69, the ninth fastest time in school history.
"We have a good middle-distance and distance
squad from cross country," Weir said. "But to be
competitive, we need to have sprinters, jumpers and
throwers who can score at the Pac-10 meet."
Junior Nick Sebes took steps towards this goal,
running the third-fastest 400 in the university races
on Saturday night in a time of 47.17 seconds. Junior
Curt Goehring finished 11th in 47.66 on the cold,
rainy evening.
Redshirt sophomore Will O'Neill set two per
sonal bests on Friday night at the Pomona-Pitzer In
vitational at nearby Pomona College. His throw of
54 feet, 2.75 inches with the shot earned him seventh
place and is a Regional qualifying mark.
"This is a rebuilding year for us," Weir said. "We
lost some of our leaders like Milton Little, Omar
Inan and Nick Welihozkiy. We have athletes like
Solomon Welch, Curt Goehring and Nick Sebes
who are good at their events and wil I continue to im
prove, but we need four sprinters to make a relay."
While the men's team is still looking to find its
leaders in the sprint and field events, the
women's squad continued its successful season in
these events.
Senior Jillian Camarena threw the shotput 55-11
for the third straight time in competition to finish
sixth in the elite section at Mt. SAC.
Freshman Keisha Gaines improved her 400 time
to a Regional qualifying 54.43 seconds while fresh
man Janice Davis ran season-best times of 11.82 and
23.95 in both the 100 and 200.
Senior Jessica Pluth threw a season best 188-2
in the hammer at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational
on Friday.
After an important weekend, the Cardinal
sprinters, throwers and jumpers return to action
this weekend at UC-San Diego in pursuit of even
better marks in their events, while the distance
squad will travel to the Penn Relays to race in the
seldom run distance relays against some of the na
tion's best.

running the third-fastest 400 in the university races
on Saturday night in a time of 47.17 seconds. Junior
Curt Goehring finished 11th in 47.66 on the cold,
rainy evening.
Redshirt sophomore Will O'Neill set two per
sonal bests on Friday night at the Pomona-Pitzer In
vitational at nearby Pomona College. His throw of
54 feet, 2.75 inches with the shot earned him seventh
place and is a Regional qualifying mark.
"This is a rebuilding year for us," Weir said. "We
lost some of our leaders like Milton Little, Omar
Inan and Nick Welihozkiy. We have athletes like
Solomon Welch, Curt Goehring and Nick Sebes
who are good at their events and wil I continue to im
prove, but we need four sprinters to make a relay."
While the men's team is still looking to find its
leaders in the sprint and field events, the
women's squad continued its successful season in
these events.
Senior Jillian Camarena threw the shotput 55-11
for the third straight time in competition to finish
sixth in the elite section at Mt. SAC.
Freshman Keisha Gaines improved her 400 time
to a Regional qualifying 54.43 seconds while fresh
man Janice Davis ran season-best times of 11.82 and
23.95 in both the 100 and 200.
Senior Jessica Pluth threw a season best 188-2
in the hammer at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational
on Friday.
After an important weekend, the Cardinal
sprinters, throwers and jumpers return to action
this weekend at UC-San Diego in pursuit of even
better marks in their events, while the distance
squad will travel to the Penn Relays to race in the
seldom run distance relays against some of the na
tion's best.

Arianna Lambie broke her own freshman school record with a
time of 4:16.89 in the 1.500 meters at the Mt. SAC relays. Lam
bie's time was the seventh best in school history.
What did it take for senior Louis Luchini to
break the Stanford school record in the 5,000 meters
— a record previously held by four-time NCAA
Champion and 2000 Olympian Brad Hauser?
Thirteen minutes and 25.19 seconds of some of
the best running in school history.
Racing against some of the nation's and world's
top athletes, Luchini placed fifth in the Mt. San An
tonio College Relays invitational 5,000.
Stanford alumnus Jonathan Riley won the race,
posting the fastest time in the world this year and an
Olympic qualifying 13:21.16. Riley ran a blazing
56.4-second final lap to take the win over Arizona's
Robert Cheseret.
Luchini's time is currently No. 2 in the U.S. and
No. 5 in the world.
"Louis's performance in the 5,000 was definitely
one of the best of the meet," said head men's coach
Robert Weir. "That was a school record by two sec
onds, a great performance by him."
The women's invitational 5,000 proved even
more exciting than the men's race as Providence's
Kim Smith, the indoor collegiate record holder at
that distance, raced North Carolina's Shalane
Flanagan to the wire but came up short, 15:09.69
to 15:09.72.
Both women missed the targeted Olympic qual
ifying standard by just one second.
Redshirt sophomore Alicia Craig finished sev
enthin 15:31.15afterrunningwith the third packfor
almost the entire race.
Junior Sara Bei finished 10th in 15:36.21, a per
sonal best by almost 30 seconds, moving her to
fourth all-time at Stanford in the event.
Earlier in the day. redshirt sophomore Ryan Hall
made his collegiate debut in the S,(XX), placing sec
ond in the university division race to New Mexico's
Matt Gonzalez, one of the nation's top 10,000-meter
runners. Hall's mark of 13:45.00 ranks him eighth
all-time at Stanford.
In the women's 1,500 the following night, fresh
man Ari Lambie set the pace for the Cardinal,
recording the fastest time of the night and a fresh
man school record of 4:16.89.
Lambie, the third-fastest prep miler ever, seems
to have adjusted well to collegiate racing, setting the
freshman school record and finishing as the top col
legian in both of her 1,500 races this year.
Fellow freshman Katy Trotter ran a Regional

qualifying time of 4:26.06 in the 1,500 to finish fifth
in her heat.
Two Cardinal men also posted Regional qualify
ing times in the 1,500. Sophomore Jacob Gomez ran
3:46.53 to place second in his heat while senior Andy
Powell continued his comeback, setting a season
best for the third time this year by running 3:46.90 to
finish third in his heat.
On the final day, redshirt junior Don Sage made
his season debut, coming in fourth in the elite mile
in 4:01.69, the ninth fastest time in school history.
"We have a good middle-distance and distance
squad from cross country," Weir said. "But to be
competitive, we need to have sprinters, jumpers and
throwers who can score at the Pac-10 meet."
Junior Nick Sebes took steps towards this goal,
