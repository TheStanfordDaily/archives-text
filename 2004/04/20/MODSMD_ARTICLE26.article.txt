# Tennis victorious in Gould's final regular season match
## 
### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's tennis team closed out
the regular dual match season on Friday and
Saturday with a loss to No. 4 UCLA and an
upset win over No. 3 Southern California.
The two matches wrap up the Stanford Chal
lenge held at the Farm this past week. With the
split, the Cardinal will head to NCAAs with a
16-7 dual match record.
Saturday's win was the last regular-season
contest for head coach Dick Gould, who is re
tiring as head coach after 38 years, during
which he has guided the men's team to 773 vic
tories and 17 NCAA Championships. Gould
also holds the distinction of being the Pac-10
Coach of the Year nine times.
This was also the last time that seniors Joe
Kao and team captain Carter Morris would
play on the Stanford courts. Kao has played for
the Cardinal for four years and Morris stayed
with the team for five years.
Morris ended the year on a fairly posi
tive note, teaming up on Friday with junior
Sam Warburg as the nation's No. 34 team
to defeat UCLA's No. 8 team of Alberto
Francis and Kris Kwinta, 8-5. Morris /
Warburg managed to stay one step ahead
of the Bruins throughout the match, ap
pearing energetic while drawing enthusi
asm from the crowd.
At the No. 2 doubles spot, the Bruins'
Philipp Gruendler and Luben Pampoulov re

taliated by downing sophomore K.C. Corkery
and junior Phil Sheng, 8-5.
Sophomore James Pade and freshman
James Wan teamed up to grab the doubles
point for Stanford, though, with a nerve
wracking 9-7 win over UCLA's Tobias
Clemens and Chris Surapol. The Bruins' strat
egy of putting No. 6 Clemens in the No. 3 dou
bles spot didn't pay off, but UCLA did put up a
good fight.
With the match tied 7-7, the teams were
at deuce, and after a few ads, Pade won the
point with a forehand down the alley. The
Bruins brought the score to another deuce,
but Pade / Wan prevailed and took home
the win.
The Cardinal wasn't able to carry the mo
mentum of the doubles-point win into the sin
gles matches, losing all but two matches to
the Bruins.
No. 11 Warburg trounced No. 6 Clemens, 6-
2, 6-4, while No. 1 10 Corkery grabbed a 7-6, 6-
3 victory. Corkery's first set was a close battle,
but he managed to bring the audience to its feet
when he won the tiebreak, 7-5.
But the dual match went downhill from there.
No. 82 Chris Lam defeated Stanford's No.
85 Wan at the No. 2 spot, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2, and No.
52 Francis recorded a 6-4. 6-3 win over Pade.
No. 62 Kwinta grabbed a close 6-4, 5-7, 6-3
victory over Sheng, and Stanford freshman
Chris Rasmussen was downed, 6-1, 6-2, by No.
106 Gruendler.
The sun was shining and things were looking

much better for the Cardinal on Saturday when
it met No. 3 USC.
Doubles action began a little slow, but the
Stanford men made up for it by taking five of
the six singles matches.
Pade / Wan were too much to handle for
USC's Parker Collins and Ruben Torres as
the Stanford team continued their win
streak by taking an 8-5 victory over the
Trojans. Stanford's Morris / Warburg fell
8-5 to Adriano Biasello and Johan Berg
while Corkery / Sheng were edged, 9-8, by
the No. 12 team of Drew Hoskins and
Daniel Langre.
Warburg came back from his doubles loss to
trounce No. 23 Biasello, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, while
Corkery overcame his earlier defeat to ease by
No. 73 Berg, 6-1, 6-3. No. 85 Wan added a win
to his record, earning a 6-3, 6-1 victory over
No. 83 Jamil Al-Agba, and teammate Sheng
came back from a first set loss to win over No.
95 Torres, 3-6, 6-2, 6-3.
"1 was really pleased with Phil Sheng,"
Gould said. "He lost a tough three-setter
against UCLA and came back and won
against USC."
Morris closed out his last dual match with an
impressive 6-4, 6-3 win over No. 94 Hoskins.
Pade was unable to overcome Langre, who
claimed a 6-1, 6-2 win.
"Bouncing back from Friday was really
good," Gould said. "The guys really battled
well and 1 was really pleased with how
they responded."
