# Water polo downs UCLA, secures second place in MPSF
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Sunday's showdown between the No. 2 Stanford
and No. 3 UCLA women's water polo teams was an
"all-or-nothing" match — as the outcome would de
cide second place in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration this season.
The hype for the matchup between conference rivals
Stanford (17-3, 9-1 MPSF) and UCLA (20-4, 9-2)
equaled the intensity of the game, as the Cardinal
earned a hard-fought 5-3 victory in Los Angeles to claim
second place in the MPSF.
"It was a close game the whole way," said Stanford
head coach John Tanner. "UCLA hasn't gotten to
where it is without being resilient so we had a feeling
they would keep it close throughout."
The win was especially important for Stanford's
seeding in the upcoming MPSF tournament. The Cardi
nal will be the second seed, UCLA the third seed and
Southern California (24-0,10-0) the top seed at the tour

nament, which begins April 30 in Los Alamitos, Calif.
There is a good chance the Cardinal will meet the Bru
ins again in the postseason.
"If we get the chance to play them again. I'm sure it
will be [another] exciting game," Tanner said.
One day after beating No. 11 San Jose State, 9-4, the
Bruins' 11-game winning streak came to end in their
final regular season game.
Freshman two-meter Christina Hewko helped the
Cardinal get ahead early, scoring the game's first goal
just 11 seconds into the match. A shot into the cage by
sophomore driver Laurel Champion gave the Cardinal a
2-0 lead in the first.
But the lead did not last long, as the Bruins put things
together on offense and got back into the game. Goals
by sophomore center defender Lauren Heineck and
sophomore center forward Kristina Kunkel, who had
two goals the previous day, tied up the match as the first
period ended.
After three consecutive matches between the
squads had ended in highly competitive one-goal

games, Sunday's match appeared to be heading in the
same direction. With Stanford's prediction of a close,
low-scoring game coming true, the Cardinal had to
focus on its defense.
"After those first two minutes, we started playing
really good defense," Tanner said. "We stifled any of
their good opportunities. They had to rely on real low
percentage perimeter shots. After Meridith [McColl]
made a couple saves, they didn't look committed to
their shots."
The Cardinal succeeded in holding the Bruins' of
fense at bay for two periods, as UCLA failed to score
in the second and third. Stanford took advantage and
two freshmen found the back of the net for the Cardi
nal: two-meter defender Alison Gregorka and driver
Katie Hansen.
Goalkeepers Emily Feher and McColl are bringing
their first seasons with UCLA and Stanford, respective
ly, to a strong end. McColl garnered MPSF Player of the
Week honors one week after Feher earned the same
honor. Both defenses played solidly, but keeping the

Bruins scoreless turned out to be of high importance for
the Cardinal win.
When we start playing really good defense, it's diffi
cult for others to score on us," Tanner said. "You felt
their confidence draining and ours growing."
Junior two-meter Kelty Luber gave Stanford some
extra insurance in securing the win with a goal late in the
fourth period.
"Kelty finally got that goal to put us up 5-2 and
it was comfortable from then on because they
weren't going to be able to get the ball three
[more] times," Tanner said. "Up until then, it was
a really close game."
Sophomore driver Katherine Belden's last-minute
goal was not enough to give the Bruins a chance to win
the game, as Stanford prevailed in another close Bruin-
Cardinal matchup.
The Cardinal hopes to extend its four-game winning
streak against another conference opponent, San Jose
State (14-14,4-6 MPSF), in its final regular season game
next weekend.
