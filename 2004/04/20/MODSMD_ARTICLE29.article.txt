### SARAH LUSTBADER DESK EDITOR 
Almost exactly 60 years ago, the day
after Passover in 1944, Nazi soldiers raided
a small Czech town and deported Gloria
Lyon along with her family. As part of Yom
Hashoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day,
Lyon spoke last night about her experience
as a prisoner in seven concentration camps
during the Holocaust and her journey to
America after the war.
"I ask you to visualize Auschwitz," she
told her audience. "The electric barbed
wire, the guards with machine guns . . . We
wondered, why are we here? Only because
we're Jews."
Lyon also discussed her struggle to re
unite with the surviving members of her
family, who had stayed in the Soviet Union
after the war.
"After 17 years, I was finally able to
visit the USSR," she said. "But not my
hometown, and only for seven days.
My brother had to quit his job to come
see me."
Lyon emphasized the sources of
strength that allowed her to survive and
the importance of leaving a legacy of
remembrance.
"We must pay tribute not only to the six
million deaths, but also to the fiendish at
tempts at our annihilation." she said.
