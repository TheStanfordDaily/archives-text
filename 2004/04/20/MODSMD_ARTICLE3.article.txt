# Stanford students spin for prizes on 'College Week' Wheel of Fortune
## 
### MATT SMITH 
Stanford students continue to find
fame in areas far from the academic field.
Two University students will be broadcast
on May 18 across the nation as contes
tants on the popular game show "Wheel
of Fortune."
Yesterday, senior Ryan Bickerstaff
and freshman Tracy Oliver joined stu
dents from colleges across the nation at
San Francisco's Moscone Center. Five
episodes were filmed altogether to be
shown during the show's special College
Week starting May 16.
"I'm not really nervous just excited to
be on TV and hopefully win some
money," Bickerstaff said before the tap
ings. "A lot of my friends are going to the
taping to cheer for me, so it should be a lot
of fun."
The show, broadcast weekday
evenings, requires more than just intelli
gence or skill as contestants must choose
individual letters in hopes of revealing a
complete phrase, name, place or other
subject. Anyone over the age of 18 who
has not been on the show or another game
or reality show over the past year is eligi
ble to compete.
"I was watching 'Wheel of Fortune'

one night over spring break and saw they
were having tryouts in San Francisco,"
Bickerstaff said. "I went onto their Web
site and saw that they were doing a spe
cial College Week, and all I needed to do
fora chance to try out was enter my e
mail address."
From there, lucky students were
called in to the final round of auditions,
where for three hours hopeful contes
tants-to-be were asked to introduce
themselves and call out letters as if they
were on a real show. Those who put
on the best show passed on to the writ
ten exam, a five-minute test made up of
fill-in-the-blank Wheel of Fortune
styled puzzles.
"The following Tuesday I received a
phone call saying I had been selected for
the show," Bickerstaff said.
To prepare for the event, Bickerstaff
studied common prefixes, suffixes and
letter frequencies, in addition to playing
the online version of the game.
As for the audition, he admitted, "I
didn't really do anything to prepare for
the audition."
This also was not Bickerstaff's first
foray into the game show world. During
his freshman year he tried out — but was
not accepted — to appear on "Holly

wood Squares." From this experience, he
said he learned what producers were gen
erally looking for, which helped him this
time around.
"It depends on how busy I am," Bick
erstaff said when asked how often he
watches the show. "If I'm in my room
when it's on TV, I'll generally watch it."
Bickerstaff wound up on the first
episode filmed, which will be shown on May
17 at 7:30 p.m., competing against students
from San Jose State and UC-Berkeley.
"It was a really amazing experience
and the whole day went by really fast,"
Bickerstaff said afterwards. "The stage
was much smaller than I imagined seeing
it on TV. The wheel itself was also much
smaller than it looks on TV, although it
was pretty heavy."
Host Pat Sajak and sidekick Vanna
White did not show up until filming
began. In addition to shaking his hand
and being thanked for playing, Bicker
staff invited Sajak to come hang out at
Stanford sometime.
Before going in front of the camera,
the students were made up by the makeup
artist of soap operas "The Bold and The
Beautiful" and"The Young and the Rest
less." Results can not be released until
after each show's air date.
