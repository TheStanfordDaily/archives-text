### STEPHANIE CONDON DISK EDITOR 
The Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) launched its seven-week Islam awareness
campaign "A Taste of Islam: Stamping Out Stereo
types" last week, to celebrate the diversity of the
Muslim community as well as to dispel negative
stereotypes associated with the religion.
"We want to share who we are — we feel like
we've spent so much time saying who we're not,"
said junior Mabrookah Heneidi, treasurer of MSAN
and a coordinator of the campaign. "We have so
many rich cultures we just want to share it with peo
ple."
In coordination with Bechtel International Cen
ter and the Religious Studies program, MSAN is

hosting a weekly dinner series that focuses on a dif
ferent Muslim region of the world each week. The
dinner features food from that particular Islamic re
gion, as well as an informational display, entertain
ment and a guest speaker who will address a specif
ic theme.
"The purpose is to promote the diversity of the
Muslim community on campus," said freshman
Aliyya Haque, a coordinator of the campaign. "A
lot of times in the news the exposure people get is
about al Qaeda — we want to show that's a very
small majority — most Muslims aren't like that at
all. | Muslims at Stanford) represent everywhere
from Uganda to the Caribbean."
The guest speakers at the dinners will address a
variety of issues, including Islam in the Media and
Women in Islam.

"We're trying to bring in a lot of images that will
really open people's minds to what Islam is," Henei
di said. "By showing the diversity of what this cul
ture is we'll be showing the unity we have."
The campaign also includes an informational
booth in White Plaza each week, with games and op
portunities for students to answer questions about
Islam for prizes, including gift certificates to the
Stanford Bookstore.
Heneidi said that campaign organizers are hoping
the campaign will supplement the Islamic Studies
programs already available at Stanford.
"The University is doing a good job [addressing
Islamic issues], but there hasn't necessarily been a
full effort put forth," she said. "While we're very ex
cited by the program, we still don't see any full time
professors in Islamic studies. Whenever you have

professors they're almost never Muslim. [Our orga
nization] is trying to give the perspective of some
one who's been well acquainted with the religion all
their lives."
Many students have shown interest in the MSAN
campaign so far, which according to Heneidi, corre
sponds with students' growing interest in Islam.
"The desire to learn about Islam has increased
many folds," she said. "From what 1 understand, en
rollment in Arabic studies has multiplied ten times.
I've taken a lot of classes that have been packed that
weren't in the past."
Heneidi said she was pleased by the turnout to
the first event, describing the room as "absolutely
packed."
"We're excited, we think it's going to just get bet
ter," she said.
