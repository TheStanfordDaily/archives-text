### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford African Students Association
(SASA) is currently sponsoring its annual Africa
Week 2004, which includes sporting, cultural and
political events.
Senior Fayelle Ouane, vice president of SASA,
said that Africa Week's purpose is to educate the
Stanford community and the community at large
and make them appreciate the diversity of the
African continent.
"We really make the effort to reach other groups
by inviting them to participate in our tournament
and our Culture Night," Ouane said. "We're spon
sored by special fees so we really have to make sure
that our services will reach the entire student body
by educating and entertaining them with the money
we've been given."
Ouane said that many different groups partici
pated in the barbeque and soccer tournament on
Sunday despite the rain.
"People spent a lot of time organizing the event
and getting teams from all over the world to come,"
Ouane said. "We had a European team, an Asian
team, a Latin American team. Besides the rain it
was animated and well-attended."
Another highlight of Africa Week is Culture

Night, which will take place on Wednesday in
Toyon Hall. The event will showcase both on
campus and off-campus performances, such as
Kuumba and individual students from Stanford
who will play African instruments and sing
African songs.
On Saturday, a student forum will be held
in the History Corner, with three different de
bates taking place simultaneously. The three
topics are African business and entrepreneur
ship, education and gender, and politics
and democracy.
"This is an opportunity for students to share
their research on Africa," said Ouane, who will be
moderating one of the debates. "After the discus
sion it will turn into a debate on the issues and re
search that have been presented."
Africa Week culminates on Saturday night with
Africa Night in Manzanita Dining Hall. SASA will
provide a catered African dinner free of charge to
Stanford students. Dinner will be followed by a
party sponsored in conjunction with the Nigerian
Students Association.
SASA is composed primarily of students from
Africa or first generation African Americans.
Some members are students who are interested in
studying or working in Africa as well, according
to Ouane.
