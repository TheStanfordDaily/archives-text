# Gravity Probe B launching postponed another day
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After 43 years, what's another day? That's what
scientists and their family members asked themselves
after the launch of Gravity Probe B — a $700 million
Stanford-designed experiment to test Einstein's Gen
eral Theory of Relativity — was delayed yesterday
three minutes before blast-off. The launch has been
rescheduled for 9:57 a.m. today.
Four minutes before the launch, Cubberley Audi
torium broke out with applause, as the control center
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara Coun
ty checked in and said the rocket was ready for
launch. Less than a minute later, however, a slight
groan came up from the audience as an announcer on
the live-video feed relayed the order for the launch to
be held.
The hold was prompted by wind shear data from

the upper atmosphere that could not be verified by
the rocket's computers due to a slight weather bal
loon malfunction. With just a one-second launch win
dow, the problem could not be fixed before lift-off.
The room quickly emptied and optimistic spokes
men who had prepared fora question-and-answer
session afterwards packed up their demonstration gy
roscopes, ready to return the next day.
"One day is not that long," said Bill Bencze, the
payload electronics manager for the mission.
The mood in the control room on the second floor
of the Gravity Probe B building was also optimistic up
until the moment the launch was delayed.
The previous night, physicists and engineers
stayed up late fixing a number of minor issues, and
adrenaline remained high yesterday morning with all
systems go.
The predicted high winds failed to materialize, and
the sky was absolutely clear along the coast over the

air force base.
With four minutes to go, control was turned over
to the launch pad and the Boeing engineers who were
in charge of the final launch protocol.
When Boeing Mission Director Rich Murphy an
nounced the hold, those in the control room were
frustrated, Bencze said.
"It was disappointing but not unimaginable," he
said. "There's about a 30 percent chance that a launch
will be scrapped any given day."
Stanford has approximately 100 scientists work
ing on the probe. They have seen numerous setbacks
since the project was initiated in 1959. The probe
launch has been canceled seven times since then.
Each time research Prof. Francis Everitt. the princi
pal investigator, managed to convince lawmakers to
reinstate funding. Most recently, in December of
last year, the mission was two weeks from launch
when it had to be called back for changes to the elec

trical system.
The probe consists of four gyroscopes, ping-pong
ball-sized spheres of glass and metal designed to mea
sure the effects of the Earth's gravity. It will be posi
tioned in space in an orbit with very little disturbance
and aligned with a star to maintain its position in
orbit. It will then measure two different effects pre
dicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
called geodetic warping and frame-dragging.
The probe is quite simple in concept, but has
proven to be quite a challenge to build and update as
new technologies became available.
"In one sense, it's hard to imagine a simpler exper
iment," Everitt said in an April 2 news conference.
He explained that if you draw a circle around the
Earth, the circumference is not actually two-pi
times the radius, as one would expect. Instead, it's
an inch less, due to the bending
effects of gravity.
At the same time, the rotation
of the earth drags the space
around it in an effect called frame
dragging that has never been
specifically measured.
The experiment is intended to
measure these slight forces by
using precisely designed spinning
spheres. The precision needed for
these measurements is incredible,
as the gyroscope must be able to
detect an angle of less than two
thousandths of one degree for the
larger effect. It requires 100 times
more accuracy to measure the

other effect.
To accomplish this precision,
the spinning spheres had to be
cooled to temperatures several de
grees above absolute zero where
they are superconducting, allow
ing special magnetic measure
ments of their spins to be made
without disturbing them.
But getting spheres spinning
that precisely on top of a complex
rocket in the inhospitable environ
ment of space has posed many en
gineering challenges.
For all the work that has been
done on this project, 78 doctor
ates have been awarded at Stan
ford, even before the first actual
measurements have been taken
in space.
"When you get down to tech
nology, the details of how to do
it, I think it's a testimony to per

severance in the least," said En
gineering Prof. Emeritus Brad
ford Parkinson.
The scientists here and at Van
denberg will have to persevere for
one more day. And if the launch is
scrubbed today, the liquid helium
on the launch pad will need to be
filled yet again before another
possible launch attempt Thursday.
Still, Bencze said he did not
mind witnessing the intricacies
of National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and wait
ing one more day for the success
of the project he has worked on
11 years.
"A lot of people aren't space in
dustry veterans," Bencze said.
"Seeing it again is just fine by me."
