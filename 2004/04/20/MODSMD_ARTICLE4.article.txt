# Gravity Probe B launching postponed another day
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After 43 years, what's another day? That's what
scientists and their family members asked themselves
after the launch of Gravity Probe B — a $700 million
Stanford-designed experiment to test Einstein's Gen
eral Theory of Relativity — was delayed yesterday
three minutes before blast-off. The launch has been
rescheduled for 9:57 a.m. today.
Four minutes before the launch, Cubberley Audi
torium broke out with applause, as the control center
Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara Coun
ty checked in and said the rocket was ready for
launch. Less than a minute later, however, a slight
groan came up from the audience as an announcer on
the live-video feed relayed the order for the launch to
be held.
The hold was prompted by wind shear data from

the upper atmosphere that could not be verified by
the rocket's computers due to a slight weather bal
loon malfunction. With just a one-second launch win
dow, the problem could not be fixed before lift-off.
The room quickly emptied and optimistic spokes
men who had prepared fora question-and-answer
session afterwards packed up their demonstration gy
roscopes, ready to return the next day.
"One day is not that long," said Bill Bencze, the
payload electronics manager for the mission.
The mood in the control room on the second floor
of the Gravity Probe B building was also optimistic up
until the moment the launch was delayed.
The previous night, physicists and engineers
stayed up late fixing a number of minor issues, and
adrenaline remained high yesterday morning with all
systems go.
The predicted high winds failed to materialize, and
the sky was absolutely clear along the coast over the

air force base.
With four minutes to go, control was turned over
to the launch pad and the Boeing engineers who were
in charge of the final launch protocol.
When Boeing Mission Director Rich Murphy an
nounced the hold, those in the control room were
frustrated, Bencze said.
"It was disappointing but not unimaginable," he
said. "There's about a 30 percent chance that a launch
will be scrapped any given day."
Stanford has approximately 100 scientists work
ing on the probe. They have seen numerous setbacks
since the project was initiated in 1959. The probe
launch has been canceled seven times since then.
Each time research Prof. Francis Everitt. the princi
pal investigator, managed to convince lawmakers to
reinstate funding. Most recently, in December of
last year, the mission was two weeks from launch
when it had to be called back for changes to the elec

trical system.
The probe consists of four gyroscopes, ping-pong
ball-sized spheres of glass and metal designed to mea
sure the effects of the Earth's gravity. It will be posi
tioned in space in an orbit with very little disturbance
and aligned with a star to maintain its position in
orbit. It will then measure two different effects pre
dicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity
called geodetic warping and frame-dragging.
The probe is quite simple in concept, but has
proven to be quite a challenge to build and update as
new technologies became available.
"In one sense, it's hard to imagine a simpler exper
iment," Everitt said in an April 2 news conference.
He explained that if you draw a circle around the
Earth, the circumference is not actually two-pi
times the radius, as one would expect. Instead, it's
