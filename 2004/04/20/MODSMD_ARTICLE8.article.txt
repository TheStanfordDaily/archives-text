## Annual Iowa State party incites riot 
### P. KIM BUI IOWA STATE DAILY 
(l WIRE) AMES, lowa — The facts
were apparent in the hours after a riot
erupted early Sunday morning, hut ac
countability was less clear as the Campus
town and lowa State University communi
ties surveyed the damage.
Ames Police Chief Loras Jaeger said dur
ing a news conference Sunday afternoon
that Ames police received a citizen com
plaint at 11:56 p.m. Saturday. The complaint
was about a party on the 2b(X) block of Hunt
Street that was spilling out into the street.
Ames police estimated about 4(M) people
were at the party. The group then moved
down to Welch Avenue and two groups
began to form — one at the southern part
of Welch Avenue and the other at Lincoln
Way and Welch Avenue.
A trash can was set on fire in front of the
Campanile replica on Welch Avenue, and
altercations rose to riot intensity with hun
dreds crowding Welch Avenue and taunting
police by mooning them and shouting phras
es such as "Fuck the police" and "No dry
Veishea." Officers held out pepper spray
and tear gas in front of them. Lamp posts,
parking meters and many storefront win
dows were damaged or destroyed. Business
es closed as rioting escalated and many em
ployees were locked in. Jaeger said there
were more than 1(X) officers out by the end
of the night.
There were 32 total arrests Sunday morn
ing, with charges including assault of an offi
cer, criminal mischief, disorderly conduct
and interference with official acts. The most
serious injury reported was a broken foot
caused by a falling lamp post.
"I would characterize this as the most vi
olent experience [in my time at Veishea],"
said Jaeger, who has seen 13 Veisheas.
lowa State's image and Veishea's future are
in question with many community members.
"It's going to be embarrassing for the school
and the students that acted out," said Nic
Stockdale, a sophomore in agricultural sys
tems technology.
ISU President Gregory Geoffroy ad
dressed the community's concerns Sunday.
"I believe that we now seriously have to
address the future of Veishea, including a
consideration of whether it should contin

ue," he said.
Some business owners said they hoped
this would be the end.
"1 would like to see Veishea end," said
Jennifer Doty, former manager of the Ames
Vogue Vision Center. "The kids get drunk,
have fun, destruct, and the city and the busi
nesses have to pay for it the next day."
ISU Police, Ames Police, Story County
sheriff's officers and the lowa State Patrol
used riot control techniques — including
pepper spray and tear gas — to push back
the crowd toward the Towers residence halls
after the crowd damaged several businesses,
including Kum & Go, 203 Welch Ave., and
Welch Ave. Station, 207 Welch Ave. How
ever, the crowd regrouped on Lincoln Way,
gathering in the portion of the street in front
of Friley Hall and pushing officers back.
"We're having fun," said Derek Weber,
of Dike, as he walked away from a lamp
post he and others pulled from the ground.
"This is about us leaving the bars and them
gassing us."
Several lamp posts and street signs were
torn down and thrown across Lincoln Way.
A sign was thrown into Welch Avenue Trad
ing Post, 105 Welch Ave., and a fire hose,
which was turned on, was also dragged into
Copyworks.
The crowds of police and rioters clashed
until about 5:30 a.m. Those in the crowds
used a number of words to describe the situ
ation: "crazy," "liberal," "conservative,"
and "fun" being a few. However, one word
was prevalent.
"Whatever adjective you use [to describe
the riots], put 'f—ing' in front of it, because
it wouldn't do it justice otherwise," said
Matt Christiansen, a senior in political sci
ence. "This is mass chaos."
"I was in the bars, and I walk out, and
immediately a cop walks out and sprays me,
and tells me to get the f— out of there,"
said Tony Feldmann, a junior in computer
engineering. "After that, 1 headed to come
to Kum & Go and turned onto Chamber
lain toward Big Shots, and two cops were
standing there, and I got sprayed fora sec
ond time, and then they told us to go the
other way."
Other students agreed they were sprayed
without cause.
"The left side of my face is burning up.
We didn't do anything. We were just walk

ing away with the crowd [and were pep
per-sprayed]," said Andrea Seminara, ju
nior in dietetics.
Ames Police Cmdr. Jim Robinson said
Sunday afternoon that officers made it clear
rioters needed to leave the area.
"Once you're in a riot situation, all in
dividuals that are within the area of the
riot, they are [told] to leave," he said. "Of
ficers can't differentiate [between onlook
ers and rioters]."
Students living in Campustown also
made claims of unnecessary brutality.
"It's unreasonable; they're charging my
yard when we were all sitting here peace
fully," said Tim Rash, a junior in computer
engineering. "It's unreasonable to provoke
people who are minding their own busi
ness. To come into my yard and yell at me
and my friends who were all sitting down
and minding their own business is a viola
tion of their rights."
Several students and other attendees at
tempted to reason with the crowd and po
lice. Two men stood outside of Welch Ave.
Station as crowds threw rocks at the build
ing, breaking windows of both Welch Ave.
Station and Pizza Pit, 207 1/2 Welch Ave.
"This is not our intention," said Ezra Kel
derman, a sophomore in mechanical engi
neering. "Some people are out of control."
The men tried to talk to the rioters, but were
repeatedly taunted and pelted with objects.
"We just want peace. The cops, they're
kind of making it worse ... but people are
making it worse too," said Seth Chicas, a ju
nior in psychology.
Comparisons were made to past Veishea
riots, such as those in 1992 and 1994.
"I've been here for 10 years," said Tony
Sheperd, general manager of Sips and
Paddy's, 124 Welch Ave. "I was here for the
stabbing and the other riots, but there wasn't
anything like this."
Some blamed the past six years of an al
cohol-free Veishea as the cause of the riots.
"[Veishea] used to be a blast, just a big house
party... then that one kid got stabbed," said
Ben Holtrop, junior in political science.
"[The riots are], like, six years of frustration
coming out."
