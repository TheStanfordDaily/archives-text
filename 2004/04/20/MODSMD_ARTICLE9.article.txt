# Microsoft kicks off Mobility Tour

### RAJ HATHIRAMANI THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J. —
Showcasing some of its newest mobile
devices from Tablet PCs to Smart
phones, Microsoft started an eight
week Student Mobility Tour at the
Friend Center at Princeton Universi
ty Saturday.
Tara Hadley, Microsoft's education
productivity advisor, discussed the lat
est accessories that will enable students
to access the information they need —
from any location and at any time.
"We [Microsoft] want to get students
informed about mobility devices since
they always need to connect, communi
cate and collaborate, on or off campus,"
Hadley said.
Princeton was Microsoft's first stop
fora tour that will include almost 80
schools over the spring and fall, includ
ing Bentley College, Dartmouth Col
lege and Columbia University in the
coming weeks.
"We pick large universities where
advanced technology is embraced and
harnessed," Hadley said. "The Tablet
PC is the latest Notebook PC in pro
cessing power, speed and memory."
Through the latest technology, a user
can input handwritten text and save it
digitally or convert it to typed text. The
Tablet PC also features voice recogni
tion and wireless Internet capability.
"A stylus pen is used as the comput
er's mouse and one can write, draw,
doodle and erase with it," she said.
Hadley presented a video of a "class
room of the future," in which students
took notes on their Tablet PCs. They
also interacted with the teaching assis
tant and professor via an instant mes
saging program during a lecture.
Students could send questions directly
to the teaching assistant, who would
then inform the professor.
Impressed by the Tablet PC's various
capabilities, freshman Jessica Chong
said, "Although the graphics for games

on a Tablet seem inferior to a desktop
computer's, I wish I had a Tablet PC."
Hadley also showed off a Smart
phone, which combines the familiari
ty of Windows software with the ease
of a mobile phone. A Smartphone
user can send and receive email, in
stant messages, browse the web, run
PowerPoint presentations and even
synchronize information with a desk
top PC.
Smartphones also include a secure
digital card slot to store music, games
and other files on removable memory.
Music can play in the background while
one reads email or works in other appli
cations like the calendar or address
book.
"The tour of mobile devices was
very informative and definitely in
creased my interest in gadgets like
the Smartphone," freshman Kay
Ashaolu said.
According to Hadley, Microsoft
One Note can help students be more ef
ficient and organized with their notes,
from class to lab to the dorm. One Note
is a new addition to Microsoft Office
and works like a notebook, but with
extra features such as searching, drag
and-drop and voice recording.
In the program, students can take
notes anywhere on the page and move
the cursor to any place on the screen
and start typing. In addition, users can
record audio notes that are synchro
nized to written notes and customize as
many notebooks, folders and pages as
they need.
Since many of the latest mobile de
vices are accompanied by high prices,
Hadley noted that schools are institut
ing special educational prices and even
integrating Tablet PCs as part of univer
sity computer initiatives.
Despite the high prices, said senior
Amy Seng, Microsoft's student repre
sentative on campus, "It's important for
students to be aware of and know how to
use mobile technology that can enhance
research and classroom learning."
