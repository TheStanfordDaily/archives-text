Join us lor the inaugural
Lecture on Public Service and the University
"Going Hack to Compton: An Outsider s-Insider's Perspective
on Public Service and Research in an At-risk Community."
Given In Professor VI Camarillo,
Miriam and Peter Haas Centennial Professor in Public Service
Thirty years after leaving his hometown of Complon to pursue
higher education, Professor Camarillo returned to assess the
changes that have fundamentally altered this city. His presentation,
a partly autobiographical discussion of public service and social
research in the "infamous" city, will revolve around relations
between whites, blacks, and Mexican \mericans over a 50-year
period (1950 to present).
How does a former Compton "insider," now academic "outsider,"
re-enter a community such as Compton. a city dealing with multiple
problems? How can a professor and his students work most
effectively in at-risk communities?
Co-sponsored by the I laas Center for Public Service and the Center
for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity.
