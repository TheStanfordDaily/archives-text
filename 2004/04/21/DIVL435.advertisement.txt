Dear Bunnies,
I have searched high and low for an answer to my question, and it seems that the sages of the Glassies are the sole bear
ers of the information I seek. What I'm wondering about is how in the hell the door of the post office could possibly be
broken for two whole months. You know which one I'm talking about: the one that faces the Music Department. No
tably, the one that is closest to my PO box. Didn't we get Mike Osofsky to take care of the post office's myriad short
comings? Why isn't he there with a screwdriver fixing the door? Help me out here, Bunnies. This is ridiculous.
Sincerely,
Stella Cousins
