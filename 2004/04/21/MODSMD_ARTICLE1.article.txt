## 
### STEPHANIE CONDON DESK EDITOR 
Leonard Ortolano, the UPS Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering
in Urban and Regional Planning, will assume the role of permanent direc
tor of the Haas Center. He has been serving as the center's interim direc
tor since June.
After a 10-month nationwide search. Provost John Etchemendy an
nounced yesterday the decision to appoint Ortolano as the permanent
successor of Nadinne Cruz, the former Haas Center director who left
last June.

Etchemendy followed the rec
ommendation of a search com
mittee, co-chaired by Dean of
Freshman and Transfer Students
Julie Lythcott-Haims and Law
Prof. Buzz Thompson, to ask
Ortolano to stay on as director.
"We looked at dozens of can
didates nationwide," said
Thompson of the search process.
"We ultimately interviewed a
total of 10 different candidates
and all of them were excellent
but, during the period of time
that we were conducting the
search. Prof. Ortolano was serv
ing as the interim and a number
of us on the search committee got
to see the energy and enthusiasm
and organizational ability that he
brought to that position. We held a
number of phone conferences and
recommended to the provost that
he try to convince Len to stay in
that position, and thankfully he
was successful."
Ortolano served as director of
the Program on Urban Studies
from 1980 until July 2003. As the
director, he helped establish the
community organization track

within the major, as well as the Urban Summer Fellowship program. Or
tolano also served as a member of the Haas Center's Faculty Steering
Committee for many years. When he accepted the role as interim director,
he did not intend to ever serve as the permanent director.
"I think he was looking forward to dedicating himself to teach
ing and his research," Thompson said. "I certainly can understand
why he might have hesitated before he decided to take this on as a
permanent position. It is time consuming and a difficult job, al
though enjoyable."
The 11-member search committee drew out a set of criteria of what
they hoped to find in the new director, including attributes such as
strong organizational abilities, an understanding of service learning,
a strong ability to mentor students and the ability to work in an aca
demic setting.
"We went down the list of criteria and he was excellent in every single
one of them," said Thompson.
"He has brought a lot of exciting ideas to the center, and he's seen op
portunities for really expanding the scope of the University that the Haas
Center serves," Thompson continued, citing the possibility of bringing
more service learning to the sciences.
Ortolano is the first University faculty member to act as director of the
Haas Center, something that the search committee hopes will foster the
expansion of faculty involved in service learning.
"The health of the center will be enhanced significantly by integrat
ing its programs more closely into the teaching and research activities
of the University," Ortolano said in a press release issued yesterday.
"I've known him for about 17 years and he has done a tremendous
job in numerous positions,"said Thompson. "It's exciting to see him
dedicate himself for the next several years to bringing that magic to the
Haas Center."
