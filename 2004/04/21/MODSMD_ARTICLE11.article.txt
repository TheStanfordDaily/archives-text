## Too bad it isn't a varsity sport 
### 
Jersey chasers — we've all seen them in action. There's an ex
ceptionally active one in our neighborhood whom we refer to as
"that girl." No one wants to be "that girl," or does she? These
girls are basically athlete groupies, attracted almost exclusively
to their school's finest sporty males and overly eager to consummate
this attraction in bed.
The Urban Dictionary states that a jersey chaser (jerzee-chay
ser) is "a girl who only goes for guys on a certain sports team." Now
that we've painstakingly cited the existing research on the subject,
we'd like to delve more deeply into this peculiar phenomenon, ex
amine its existence at Stanford, and answer the age old question
posed by the great philosopher Mirroples: "If jersey chasing were a
varsity sport, would the chasers chase each other?"
Senior baseball player Dirk recalled, "I met this girl at a party,
and the first thing she said to me was, 'You're a baseball player? One
of my goals in life is to hook up with a baseball player!' "
This extreme scenario sounds unrealistic to anyone who hasn't
experienced it firsthand. We personally thought jersey chasing was a
myth until, at a recent party we hosted, an impressionable young fresh
man girl came up to us and shrieked, "This party rocks! You guys are
SO cool, you must be athletes!"

Jersey chasing comes in all shapes and
sizes. In addition to receiving typical ath
letic honors like trophies and free sex,
Stanford athletes are often bombarded
with a deluge of baked goods, good luck
cards, pre-written I-Hum papers and
more baked goods. Brave girls literally
line up (in an impressively organized fash
ion) at frat parties to dance with Johnny
Football Hero and are often forced to tag
team due to supply shortages, while less
assertive types settle for nearby ogling and

the discreet butt grab.
As much as we'd like to pass jersey chasing off as an affliction that
only affects the shallow and weak, we'll admit that we too have been
guilty of being Josh Childress' biggest fan. Maybe there's a new strain
of jersey chasing that is highly contagious, because even as old, disil
lusioned seniors, we suddenly find ourselves smitten with half the
men's basketball team, giggling like (naughty) schoolgirls when we
see them towering above all the frat boys at Sigma Chi.
So why is the chase so thrilling? We conducted extensive inter
views and even some undercover(s) research to find an explanation
for this epidemic. At the risk of perpetuating the phenomenon fur
ther, we'd like to share some findings with our readers. First and fore
most, athletes are hot. They work out regularly, they're not afraid of
physical contact, and we know they look good when they're all
sweaty. As junior co-ed Carrie put it, "I've seen what he can do with
a basketball — I figure those hands are good for lots of things!" Less
superficially, the intensity and dedication athletes pour into their
sports are attractive qualities girls look for in a mate.
Furthermore, girls definitely take pride in a fella's good perfor
mance on and off the court. We see our man make the game-winning
basket or home run or chess move, and we think "he is doing well be
cause he had SUCH good sex last night." Isn't it every girl's dream to
be Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham?
Let's turn to the other, less-explored side of jersey chasing fora
moment. Do guys chase female athletes? The verdict is that it's a far
more limited practice, occurring for different reasons. Whereas girls
tend to elevate male athletes to the status of unattainable lust ob
jects, boys actually like female athletes because they're a bit closer to
home — they share important common interests like sports and
physical activity. Since society doesn't place as high a premium on fe
male athletics, the prestige factor of pole vaulting with a female track
star just isn't on par with that of tackling a quarterback. Senior War
wick Flappins concurs, "I mean, I'm not gonna go down on her just
because she's an athlete, but it is a plus."
So how does jersey chasing affect athletes? Regardless of the rea
sons behind this phenomenon, all that attention does seem to boost
their confidence with the ladies. As a naive little freshman, I (Alia)
remember witnessing the charms of one high-profile athlete first
hand. He would wrap his bulging, muscular arm around me, and all I
could think to say was, "Wow. You're tall," to which he would reply,
"You know, we're both the same height when we're lying down."
Even though I ultimately decided to pass on participating in this
height-alteration experiment, I remember secretly being giddy that
he was hitting on me. So it seems that jersey chasing actually benefits
everyone, including innocent bystanders and the University as a
whole. Athletes and jersey chasers keep each other happy and occu
pied; meanwhile, all girls are flattered by athletes' overly confident ad
vances, this confidence boosts their athletic prowess, and Stanford
keeps raking in the Sears Cups. Everybody wins. So chase away, girls.

The W Spot appears every other Wednesday. Epstein is on the Stanford
Squash Team and Gonopolsky is one of Stanford's premier varsity
mathletes. Jersey-chase them at epstein@ and allag@stanford.edu.
