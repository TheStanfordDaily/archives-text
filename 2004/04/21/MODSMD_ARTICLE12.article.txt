# Chappie goes highbrow
## 
### ANNA GALAN MANAGING EDITOR 
Released last Monday, the most recent install
ment of Stanford's humor magazine. The Cha
parral, isn't just getting attention on campus; The
Chappie was featured in the April 19 issue of The
New Yorker. In an article entitled "A pile of paper"
run in the section Talk of the Town, the piece tells
the story of how the latest issue of The Chappie
came together, from late-night brainstorming ses
sions to collating the final product.
Different from anything that's been done before,
the issue is enclosed in a manila folder scribbled
with the note: "Very Important Files." Instead of
the annual parody of a national magazine, the issue
parodies a simple pile of papers.
According -to Evan Ratliff, who worked on the
story, his editors at The New Yorker suggested the
story idea. The magazine was looking to do a profile
on college humor and felt that the natural place to
look was at the Harvard Lampoon. Editors at the
New Yorker, however, felt that the Harvard maga
zine had been overexposed in the past.
Additionally, The Chappie recently beat out the
Lampoon for the number one spot in the rankings
of college humor magazines. After a long stint
ranked second, last February, The Chappie was
proud to learn that the National Collegiate Humor
Board Association moved its position to first.
Ratliff, who is a freelance writer based out of San
Francisco, visited Stanford for his first Chappie
meeting in early February. He made a total of five
visits over the course of a month in which he con
ducted interviews with Chappie staffers and alumni.
"I thought they were funny people in general; my
sense of humor is very similar to theirs," Ratliff said.
"The thing that surprised me most was how hard
they worked on the thing." •
He explained that for his final visit, he planned
on staying at the office until the issue was complet
ed, and ended up staying all night.
"1 thought they'd throw it together, but to them,
it's more than just making the magazine, it's like this
clubhouse of joking around. They never really stop.
It's sometimes hard to tell when they're serious or
when they're not," he said.
Ratliff also admitted that their humor wasn't
for everyone.
"I did find that reading the issues, they got much
funnier after I h ad read a whole bunch of them. At
first, there are so many weird things in there; I had no
idea what they were talking about. But, after I start
ed looking at a bunch of old issues, it just got funnier,
something about getting into the sensibility of it.
They have sort of a very absurd sense of humor."
Ratliff hoped to convey The Chappie's unique
style in his article.
"That was something I was impressed with. They
want people to like it, but they kind of do their own
thing. They push people's humor a little bit. They're
hoping to get those few people who will really ap
preciate it. If people don't think it's funny, they're
not going to change what they do."
Senior Charlie Stockman, who has been involved
with The Chappie since his freshman year, said he
wasn't surprised that The New Yorker would do a
story on them.
"I feel like us and The New Yorker kind of aim at
the same humor that only we get it, and we kind of
take pride in no one else understanding it."
Senior Steve Yelderman, who is the co-editor
in chief along with senior lan Spiro, was a little
more wary.
"We usually try to set our expectations pretty
low," Yelderman said.
Yelderman worried that having a journalist in
the office interviewing staff members would
harm productivity.
"At first, I thought it would be terrible," Yelder
man said. "We're not here to see our name in a
glossy magazine, we're here to print our names in
our own glossy magazine."
In the end, staff members enjoyed spending time
with Ratliff, though his presence was noted.
"He wore black turtlenecks, sat in the corner and

stroked his goatee," Stockman said. "It
wasn't a problem, but Steve [Yelderman] en
forced a dress code on us: We had to wear a
tie, and belts and no sneakers. Evan [Ratliff]
had the impression that we were dressed up all
the time."

"Steve [Yelderman] was cracking down,"
Junior Amanda Pettit added. "It was strict and
totally bizarre, considering the normal profes
sional atmosphere at The Chappie. I guess the
reasoning behind it was that we didn't want to
give him too much of a story based on what we

were wearing.
Pettit's restrictions included no skirts above
the knee and no shoulders exposed.
"Also, there was no direct rule against pony
tails, but it was implied," she said.
Yelderman thought it was a challenge to
hang out with Ratliff because the journalist was
so ethical.

"He couldn't accept any pizza or soda or any
thing. His complete detachment made us fear what
he'd write about us," Yelderman said.

The group's final attempt was leaving Ratliff a
jar full of $10 worth of pennies, since "he refused
larger denominations of coins."

However, the sacrifices seemed to
be worth it. Chappie staff members
were pleased with the final result.

"I thought it was really exciting
for us as a publication," Pettit said.
Pettit, who is The Chappie's

circulation manager, said that
since The New Yorker article
came out, the number of sub
scriptions has increased greatly,
and she expects more.

I hat s definitely our target
audience, and we are always hop
ing fora wider subscription
base," she said. "The article has
been nothing but a positive."

Both Yelderman and Spiro
thought the final article was

great, and felt that their maga
zine had been well represented
by The New Yorker. On ac
count of the recent press,
both have received several

internship offers, and the
magazine also got a call re-

garding a possible story in anoth
er national magazine.

They did, however, have some
doubts about the way their phys
ical appearance was described in
the article.
"I'm trying to loose weight, to
live up to the expectations of
being described as 'thin and gang
ly' in the introduction of the arti
cle," Spiro said.
Yelderman, on the other hand,
who was described as athletic look
ing, joked that he was going to have
to start to work out on account of
Ratliff's description.
"Initially, I wanted to describe
him as a guy who looked like Matt
Damon," Ratliff admitted. "But, my
editors didn't want to bring the issue
of celebrity into it."
Ratliff and his editors finally set
tled on "athletic-looking electrical
engineering major who wears hip
nerd plastic glasses."
Due to restrictions placed by
Stanford's department of Residen
tial Education this year, The Chap
pie, along with all other on-campus
publications, is unable to distribute
to every dorm room door-to-door.
Spiro and Yelderman noted that
they have made extra issues avail
able outside their office located in
Storke Publications Building.
