# Eat, drink and be merry
## The 						sandwich diaries 
### JENNIE BRODER FOOD COLUMNIST 
Lunchtime is an interesting time of day. In Europe I
imagine throngs of beautiful people lounging outside
Parisian or Italian cafes, sipping their cappuccino and
savoring some dish like melon and prosciutto.
When I think of an American lunch, several images
come to mind. One is the schoolyard lunch, where a
turkey sandwich and Oreos lay tucked inside a pink My
Little Pony lunchbox, where my Juicy Juice for some
reason sat next to my Popple that I brought to school.
(Oh yeah, you all remember Popples. I can't remember
why exactly they were cool, but they were.)
Then comes the somewhat rushed lunch that most
people in this world take, where they go drive through
McDonald's or stop by that weird cafeteria place on the
bottom floor of their office. Yummy. I always love
mediocre teriyaki bowls to bring back to my cubicle.
And for the lucky, there is the power lunch. This is
the time when the high-power players get together at
some high-power restaurant that exudes money and ne
gotiate deals over anything and everything.
So what does a Stanford student do? Usually I have a
whole hour to lounge with my meal (sometimes longer,
depending on the weather of course. Rain or 80 degree
sunshine = not walking to my 1:15 class across the Quad).
So 1 don't need eat and run, but I don't have 3 hours to
savor a Cabernet Sauvignon and a three-course display.

What I really want is a good sandwich. I think the
sandwich is the epitome of a good lunch. Think of your
self as a designer, dressing the sandwich as up or down
as you please. The toppings can range from mustard,
crisp lettuce and a juicy tomato, to soft avocado, grilled
vegetables tucked between artisan bread.
Ask my friends, and you shall receive.
My absolute favorite sandwich place in Palo, when
I'm looking fora sit-down, nice yet not overly pricey or
daunting restaurant is Cafe Brioche. Located right
across the street from Bistro Elan, this charming eatery
is decorated in the style of a French country cottage.

With umbrellas placed sporadically
inside the restaurant and with corks
filling the base of the potted plants
and trees, Cafe Brioche has funky
yet romantic charm to it. As you sit
in cute country chairs and wooden
tables, attentive servers bring you
dishes with familiar ingredients pre
pared in gourmet ways.
The roasted red pepper soup was
blended perfectly with a touch of
pepper, whose warm and delicately
thick liquid was the perfect comple
ment to the basket of crusty bread
sitting in the middle of the table. An
other star starter was the pear and
arugula salad, where the sweet pears

contrasted nicely with the Roquefort cheese, sweetly
toasted walnuts and lightly dressed greens.
It was, however, the main course sandwiches that
took my breath away (a la Jessica Simpson / Top Gun).
The roasted turkey sandwich came tucked between
warm rustic bread, and was coated by a layer of melted
brie, soft roasted red peppers, black olive tapenade, and
a sprinkling of basil. The best part was when you took a
bite into this soft, flavorful sandwich, and didn't have to
fight the bread for it.
You know what I am talking about — the tuggage
factor. You can seamlessly bite into the sandwich with-

out pulling like crazy to separate
your mouth from the crust, mak
ing fora more pleasant overall
dining experience.
The grilled chicken sand
wich also ranked high on my list.
Served on toasted foccaccia
bread with fresh mozzarella and a
basil pesto spread, this dish
doesn't have a whole lot of top
pings, and the simplicity makes
fora clean, delicious meal.
While the taste in itself
would be enough to bring me
back, the presentation is just so
beautiful that you want to stare at
this piece of art in front of you.

The sandwiches are cut perfectly without any jagged
edges or overboard ingredients, where a pile of leafy
greens billow out from the side of the plate, adding
depth and color to the plate.
Cafe Brioche maximizes its area by adding a mirror
to one of the walls, creating the illusion of vast space,
and the huge glass windows flanking the front of the
restaurant provide a great view of the cute street, and
make the cafe a great people-watching spot.
If you want to be more adventurous you can also try
their more hardcore French options, such as their Duck
Confit Salad or Croque Monsieur, but 1 would only sug
gest going there for dinner if you are the sophisticated
gourmand. Otherwise take a break from the dining hall
Chinese food and go to a place where you can experience
a leisurely, friendly, beautiful atmosphere before your
1:15 class. Who needs a power lunch when you can have
the take-a-breather-lunch. And when you breathe in. 1
hope you breath in the wonderful tastes of Cate Brioche.
• Cafe Brioche is located at 445 California Ave. in
Palo Alto.

If xou find a Popple lying around your house, shoot Jen
nie an e-mail at jbroder@stanford.edu and may he send
her a picture. She has forgotten what they looked like and
feels somewhat sad.
