# ASSU mishandled election
## 
### 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate last night sent a
message that it will not tolerate questionable cam
paign tactics in the executive elections. To allow an
election to stand despite multiple violations of cam
paign rules would have been unfair to the candidates
and might have tarnished the ASSU's reputation, the
senators decided. That is a noble sentiment. But the
way it was put into practice is disgraceful.
The campaign violations, in short, consisted of a
few groups and individuals sending unsolicited, elec
tion-related e-mails after the deadline for campaign
ing had passed. Most of these e-mails expressed sup
port for the Lee-Mefford slate, and at least two were
written with Lee and Mefford's consent.
It is unclear whether Lee and Mefford intended to
break the rules — ambiguous wording left a loophole
that the candidates thought they could exploit. But it
certainly would not have been out of line for the Elec
tions Commission to withhold the results, given all the
confusion. The Senate could then have debated
whether or not a re-election was necessary, and they
could have made their decision untainted by the
knowledge of who had won the original vote.
Instead, the Commission announced the results of
the election to the student body and recommended
that the Senate certify Lee-Mefford as the winners.
This, too, was a valid stance. Examining voter trends
before and after the offending e-mails had been sent,
the commission members found no evidence that the
e-mails affected voting patterns. They decided that
the election results represented the will of the voters,
and that given the ambiguity in the rules, none of the

candidates had committed any clearly unethical acts.
But last night, the Senate ignored the Elections
Commission's recommendation and called fora re
election. Coming after the results had already been an
nounced, this wasn't just a vote to nullify the election on
the grounds that it was unfair — it was a vote to strip
Lee and Mefford of the presidency and vice presidency.
That's a much more politically charged proposition,
and one that implies substantial misdeeds by Lee and
Mefford, personally. That seems like a harsh judgment,
given that the violations essentially amounted to free
political speech by people unaffiliated with their cam
paign. But if Lee and Mefford did indeed act unethical
ly and against the rules, why aren't they disqualified?
The student body now faces another tedious elec
tion campaign, with perhaps new slates or new combi
nations of old slates competing under the same dys
functional system of rules. Moreover, the ASSU has
sent mixed messages by implying that Lee and Mef
ford did not deserve their victory, yet allowing them to
run again. Worse still, voters have gotten the message
that their votes can be overturned by a small group of
ASSU senators. Ironically, these same senators who
are so concerned about perceived flaws in the execu
tive election were themselves elected through a pro
cess that borders on farcical: Typically, whoever has
the cleverest or most colorful flyers wins.
The ASSU election system does need reform, and
candidates need to understand that breaking the rules
is not a winning strategy. But publicly anointing a win
ner and then subsequently calling fora revote was the
wrong way to accomplish those goals.
