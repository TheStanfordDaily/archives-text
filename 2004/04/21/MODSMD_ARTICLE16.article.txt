## A
						soldier's perspective 
### 
Last week, more soldiers came
home in pine boxes (64) than
at any other time since the
Iraqi conflict began over a
year ago. One soldier — a new friend
of mine — came home unharmed.
After almost a year in Iraq, Jared
Brown, an army reservist, returns to
his old job as an accountant at Price
Waterhouse Cooper. He's watched
friends die. fielded his share of mortar
rounds and bullets and lived among
Iraqis; now safe at home he finally has
time to sort out his feelings about the
American cause in Iraq.
He comes home to a media frenzy of
all things war-related. It's been a messy
few weeks in the country he just recent
ly left. The gruesome murders and mu
tilation of American contractors in the
Shiite stronghold of Falluja a few weeks
ago sparked an American reprisal,
bloody street fighting and finally an odd
American alliance with Iran — a char
ter member of Bush's "axis of evil" —
to negotiate with Shiite Iraqi clerics.
The old saying, "the enemy of my
enemy is my friend," is never so true as
when describing American foreign pol
icy in the Middle East.
The dust-up makes a June power
transfer look like a pipe dream and
has shifted press coverage here at
home. For the first time in the Iraqi
conflict, coffins and grieving family
members appeared on the front page
of The New York Times. An entire
page inside the paper was devoted to
pictures and information of each sol
dier that died the previous week in
Iraq. And the comparisons between
Iraq and Vietnam cropped up again.
Brown tries not to read these reports.
"I saw these things happen with my
own eyes, I don't need to read about
it,"he says. In fact, he thinks the

media misses the point entirely with
the focus on body count. "It is impor
tant to understand the cost of us being
there, but that's not the story. There
are lots of good people working on

important pro
jects, like bringing
water and electric
ity and freedom to
Iraqis. Many are
living better now
than before we got
there," he says.
If it is strange to
think that some
one who was pre-

pared to sacrifice all for the Iraqi con
flict wishes not to focus on the human
cost, that's because we are on the talk
side of the equation. The big talk of
war and peace happens on this side, a
wide ocean apart from the presence of
danger or young and helpless victims.
Brown and his colleagues do the dirty
work — they walk all that talk in the
line of fire, where every soldier must
find his or her own reason for betting
their life on America. The military
credo, "Ours is not to ask why, ours is
to do or die," isn't just idle chatter.
If the sacrifice rests with the duty
bound. like Brown, the responsibility
lies with our elected officials and the
media — the two groups who are com
missioned to ask the whys. The ques
tions we didn't have time to ask before
the troops were assembled are now get
ting an audience. In fact, now is perhaps
the first moment the U.S. has taken a
breath since the terrorist attacks of2ool
to review why. how and what next.
The decision-makers — the peo
ple we depend on to protect the U.S.
— are getting a proper going-over by
the 9 /11 panel, which has become an
American sort of truth and reconcilia

tion. And the decisions building up to
the war in Iraq are also being re
viewed and vented in tell-all books.
However, the scrutiny might actually
muddle the issues.
The 9/11 panel is learning that in
telligence was bungled and the govern
ment did not act on leads that could
have prevented 9/11. For that, the gov
ernment is being sharply criticized. As
for the Iraq war. new information re
veals that intelligence was either bun
gled or manipulated, though the gov
ernment did act on leads. And again,
the government is being criticized.
Act or don't act? Spill American
blood or wait for more information?
Truth and reconciliation isn't so clean.
For the soldiers, truth and recon
ciliation is simple and automatic on
the field and slower to come once the
smoke has cleared. The shift from fo
cusing on weapons of mass destruc
tion to a democratization mission was
received in Iraq without question, al
though Brown says he found the
change in missions "disconcerting."
Now he is groping with the questions
he didn't have time to ask when he
had a job to do.
"We were told Iraq was a threat to
the U.S.. and in the end, it played out
as something else. I never heard a sin
gle soldier badmouth the president,
but certainly we talked about this. I
joined the Army to defend the U.S.
but I don't feel like America is a safer
place now. although Iraq might be.
But you just have to suck it up and be
a good soldier," Brown said. "And in
the end. I'm OK risking my life for
peace for other people."
