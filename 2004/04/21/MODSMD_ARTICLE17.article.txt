# STEP INTO MAC'S WORLD
## Why Mac hates you 
### 
It's no secret that I am inpatient
and a bit of a misanthrope. I can't
help it. Maybe it's the New York
er in me, but I immediately dis
like 90 percent of the people I meet.
Clearly, I'm a tad on the judgmen
tal side, but usually there is a method
to my madness. There are certain
qualities I like in a person and certain
qualities 1 don't like. So I thought I
would do the community a service
and disclose some of my reasons for
hating people.
Unfortunately I'm contractually
prohibited from naming names, but
here's a sneak peak into my thought
process for immediately hating some
of the random people I meet.
I hate people who say that their fa
vorite band is some new group that
has just released its first single. If I
have had milk in my fridge longer
than this band has been on MTV, your
pants might as well be on fire. I don't
care how much you like "Stacy's
Mom," Fountains of Wayne cannot
be your favorite group of all time.
I hate Yankee fans. For me, the
Yankees represent everything that's
wrong with the world: the right-wing
Republican domination of our govern
ment, the erosion of small businesses in
America and the success of boy bands
in the late '90s. If their team plane
crashed like the soccer team in "Alive,"
it would probably be okay by me.
Honestly, as I heard one Yankee
hater say, rooting for the Yankees is
like rooting for the house in black
jack. I hate the pinstripes, their $200
million payroll and the way they
poach talent from every small-mar
ket team in baseball.
As one of my friends said, though,
the A-Rod signing might backfire
when the team's chemistry is disrupt
ed by the release of grainy home
camcorder footage showing a homo
sexual rendezvous between Alex
Rodriguez and Derek Jeter. Let's see
what those fair-weather Yankee fans
say when they find out that the rela
tionship between their two stars is

more pitcher / catcher than third
baseman / shortstop.
If you are in the crowd at an athlet
ic event and you happen to get on TV,
if you smile and wave one hand while

you hold your cell
phone in the other,
I will hate you for
ever. Interestingly,
the cell phone is
the rare accessory
that accentuates
every bad quality
that an annoying
person may have.
If you haven't no-

ticed, it's always the people that you al
ready can't stand that have their ringer
set as "The Macarena" on full blast.
And, usually, these are the same
people that walk around campus
talking into one of the handless ear
pieces, confusing me into thinking
that they're schizophrenic or. worse,
trying to include me in their retard
ed conversation.
If you've ever watched "Ameri
can Idol" and sung along to a Clay
Aiken song, you're not my type of
guy. If you're not a freshman, but still
have that red Stanford lanyard with
your keys on it sticking out of your
pocket, it's probably not such a good
idea for you to talk to me.
If you clap during movies, I will
hate you from day one. And if you
never wore a hat in your life until you
started sporting a cheesy trucker hat
this past year, I think someone
should rip that fake vintage hat off
your head and defecate in it.
I hate any kid that sits in class with
his laptop, checking stocks on E-
Trade, talking on AIM and looking at
lecture slides at the same time. With 10
minutes left in class, when the teacher
is about to let everyone out early,
there's a 50-50 chance that you're the
ass-kissing nerd that will raise his hand
and ask some pointless question, en
suring that the whole class gets out
late. And I hate you for it.
I hate anyone that reeks of bad

body odor. I couldn't care less about
your politics or your belief that not
shaving a certain part of your body is
the perfect way to stick it to the man.
All I care about is not gagging when
you walk by me.
I hate anyone in college that
doesn't know the difference between
Beer Pong and Beirut. And I hate
anyone that waits in line for 10 min
utes at a fast-food restaurant, and
then can't decide what to order when
it's finally her time.
1 hate all of those people protest
ing something that they know little to
nothing about. And I hate the thou
sands of morons that respond to on
line polls during sporting events, giv
ing their completely meaningless and
uniformed opinions about such load
ed questions as whether the pitcher
should be taken out of the game.
1 hate people that love playing the
name game.
1 hate people that get more excited
about the commercials during the
Super Bowl than the game itself. And I
hate people that say that Product A is
"the new" Product B, like gin is the new
vodka or, as "The Daily Show" gleeful
ly mocked, gay is the new straight.
If you're proselytizing in White
Plaza — whether you're telling me to
vote for Laßouche rather than
Kerry, that the apocalypse is coming
next Friday or that I'm going to hell
because I'm Jewish — I hate you
more than you will ever know.
To make things easier for me, if
you're that guy using the Quad as his
pulpit, why don't you put on a mesh
Yankees hat and a Clay Aiken t
shirt smelling like B-O, talk into
your cell phone with an earpiece,
and, when I get out of class 15 min
utes late, ask me if you play Beirut
with ping-pong paddles.
We'll get along great. In fact, I hear
that we're the new Ike and Tina Turner.
