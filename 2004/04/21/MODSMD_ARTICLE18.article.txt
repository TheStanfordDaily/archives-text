Interracial dating debate targets
Asian American men
Finally, someone addressed the
issue of interracial dating ("Sexism
seems implicit in questions of racial
dating," April 20). This should be a
good read ... or so I thought. But
rather than being a proud assertion
of feminist ideals, it became rather
apparent that the letter was a not
too-subtle attack directed towards
Asian American men, especially
when it had lines like: "Just because
I am of Chinese descent, no Chinese
man is entitled to date me by virtue
of our similar cultural and racial her
itage."
The unfortunate truth is that
whenever some article comes out
about interracial dating, especially at
this university, it inevitably starts to
focus on the whole issue of statistical
dating disparities between Asian
American men and women. The
views of Clacks, Hispanics and
women in general are all but ignored.
Let's not even start to talk about Na
tive Americans or multi-racial indi

viduals. Why? Because talking about
the frustration of Asian American
men is a controversial subject that a
lot of people know about that opens
up all kinds of related issues like
racial stereotyping that people like to
talk about and get generally pissed
off about. Basically it attracts read
ers for the shock value.
What this ends up doing is fur
thering existing media portrayals of
Asian American men as chauvinist
and racist. This is especially apparent
when one looks over what quotes
have been included, and finds that
most are from unidentified, angry
Asian men complaining about white
men dating Asian women.
I think it's reasonable to believe
that every frustrated guy, no matter
his ethnic background, occasionally
starts to rant on that particular train
of thought. But since only the frus
trated ravings of some Asian Amer
ican males are presented in printed
form, guess which group ends up
being portrayed as sexist.
Which leads me back to the letter
to the editor written by May Chiang.

By the end of the letter, it's pretty
clear, at least to many I've asked, just
who she is talking to: an Asian
American man. But Ms. Chiang is
not a racist, nor does she possess any
more self-hatred than anyone else
who lives under the constant racism
and sexism in our society. However,
she is just as susceptible to the
warped thinking promoted by a
media culture that pursues ratings
and shock value over truth and so
cial awareness.
Despite what I've just said, in
case you start to think that I'm some
kind of chauvinist who'd be better
off working for the Review, I actual
ly do agree with Ms. Chiang. Men
who view women who date outside
their ethnicity as some kind of "lost
property " are simply trying to dodge
the simple truth that they them
selves have no social skills. It's al
ways easier to inherit something
than it is to work for it, and sexual
frustration is one of those things that
hurts the laziest most.
