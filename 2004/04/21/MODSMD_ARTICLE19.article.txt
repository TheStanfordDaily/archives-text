## There's nothing wrong with a little gambling 
### 
rospicience! It's I-C-I, you fetal
\M alcohol syndrome-having failed-
I abortion!" They say some people
JL can target the precise moment when
they realize they have a problem. It is 3 a.m., and I
am wagering loudly with friends on the outcome of
the National Spelling Bee on ESPN2 — and 1 am
continually asserting that I am not addicted to
gambling. Previously this evening, 1 have already
played poker for three hours and bet on miniature
golf. But what is sport (or, in this case, a contest
between the minds of fifth-graders) without a lit
tle spice?
The great "businessman" and writer Mario Puzo
once noted, "Gambling is not as destructive as war
or as boring as pornography. It is not as immoral as
business or as suicidal as watching television. And
the percentages are better than religion."
There are greater vices than gambling to be found
in this world, and at least the friendly wager encour-

ages young boys to learn mathemat
ics. Puzo's assertion runs most true
with regard to betting on sports,
which combines America's real fa
vorite pastimes.
When Daddy makes football
just a little bit more interesting,
when the office pool runs into the
final round and when a Wednes
day game between the Tigers and
Royals becomes an epic battle of

wills, gambling has done its duty.
Nowhere was this more evident than in this
year's NCAA tournament. With time winding
down in the national semifinal against Connecticut,
Duke senior Chris Duhon dribhled across midcourt
and halfheartedly launched a 38-foot prayer.
Miraculously, the shot banked home. Sports bars
across the nation exploded into unbridled, passion
ate joy — and furious gnashing of teeth. Duhon's
shot changed the fortunes of more people than he
will ever care to know, even though it didn't affect
the outcome of the game.
By shaving UConn's margin of victory from four
points to one, Duhon allowed the Blue Devils to
cover the spread, thus causing anywhere from $30
to $100 million to change hands, depending on
which estimate you believe. In a turn of events that
appeared irrelevant, those who bet on underdog
Duke to cover collected in one of the most incredi
ble swings of all time.
Sports betting, even more so than its brethren in
the gambling family tree, conjures up images of cor
ruption, mob ties and point-shaving scandals. How
ever, if anything, the odds are more in the gambler's
hands than with other games. The power of the
sports books goes to the bettor, who accrues
enough information to give himself an edge over
the lines, whereas in blackjack, the house will al
ways have the odds.
Gambling on sports becomes research; it re
duces sports to a science — albeit a science in which
luck often bursts onstage to produce the most un
likely of outcomes.
The fact that the edge goes to the informed, how
ever, creates an all-consuming desire for sports triv
ia you didn't even know existed.
Any tiny factor that can provide an advantage
against the odds is appreciated, so when you know
that Frank Thomas hits 70 points better when he
plays first base than when he DHs, or that Roger
Clemens is virtually unhittable when pitching
against lefthanders in June, it's a veritable goldmine.
Taking this to its logical extreme, however, will only
drive you insane.
Now, I'm not yet a legal gambler, but I can as
sure you that by my 21st birthday, I plan to step into
the shoes vacated by the great Arnarillo Slim, Ti
tanic Thompson. Nick the Greek and others whose
millions were lost and, more often than not, won by
the athletic prowess (and sometimes spelling skill)
of other men.
These were men who proved that you can make
a fortune from other people's stupidity, and had im
mense amounts of fun doing so.
So, what have we learned today? Addiction
to gambling isn't as bad as Mom would make it
seem. It gives you the opportunity to have
friends with nicknames like "Diamond" and
"the Hammer."
It is capable of making any contest — even
women's gymnastics — exciting. And, most impor
tantly, gambling always gives you something to do.
After all, it's only a problem if you're losing.

the National Spelling Bee on ESPN2 — and 1 am
continually asserting that I am not addicted to
gambling. Previously this evening, 1 have already
played poker for three hours and bet on miniature
golf. But what is sport (or, in this case, a contest
between the minds of fifth-graders) without a lit
tle spice?
The great "businessman" and writer Mario Puzo
once noted, "Gambling is not as destructive as war
or as boring as pornography. It is not as immoral as
business or as suicidal as watching television. And
the percentages are better than religion."
There are greater vices than gambling to be found
in this world, and at least the friendly wager encour-

ages young boys to learn mathemat
ics. Puzo's assertion runs most true
with regard to betting on sports,
which combines America's real fa
vorite pastimes.
When Daddy makes football
just a little bit more interesting,
when the office pool runs into the
final round and when a Wednes
day game between the Tigers and
Royals becomes an epic battle of

wills, gambling has done its duty.
Nowhere was this more evident than in this
year's NCAA tournament. With time winding
down in the national semifinal against Connecticut,
Duke senior Chris Duhon dribhled across midcourt
and halfheartedly launched a 38-foot prayer.
Miraculously, the shot banked home. Sports bars
across the nation exploded into unbridled, passion
ate joy — and furious gnashing of teeth. Duhon's
shot changed the fortunes of more people than he
will ever care to know, even though it didn't affect
the outcome of the game.
By shaving UConn's margin of victory from four
points to one, Duhon allowed the Blue Devils to
cover the spread, thus causing anywhere from $30
to $100 million to change hands, depending on
which estimate you believe. In a turn of events that
appeared irrelevant, those who bet on underdog
Duke to cover collected in one of the most incredi
ble swings of all time.
Sports betting, even more so than its brethren in
the gambling family tree, conjures up images of cor
ruption, mob ties and point-shaving scandals. How
ever, if anything, the odds are more in the gambler's
hands than with other games. The power of the
sports books goes to the bettor, who accrues
enough information to give himself an edge over
the lines, whereas in blackjack, the house will al
ways have the odds.
Gambling on sports becomes research; it re
duces sports to a science — albeit a science in which
luck often bursts onstage to produce the most un
likely of outcomes.
The fact that the edge goes to the informed, how
ever, creates an all-consuming desire for sports triv
ia you didn't even know existed.
Any tiny factor that can provide an advantage
against the odds is appreciated, so when you know
that Frank Thomas hits 70 points better when he
plays first base than when he DHs, or that Roger
Clemens is virtually unhittable when pitching
against lefthanders in June, it's a veritable goldmine.
Taking this to its logical extreme, however, will only
drive you insane.
Now, I'm not yet a legal gambler, but I can as
sure you that by my 21st birthday, I plan to step into
the shoes vacated by the great Arnarillo Slim, Ti
tanic Thompson. Nick the Greek and others whose
millions were lost and, more often than not, won by
the athletic prowess (and sometimes spelling skill)
of other men.
These were men who proved that you can make
a fortune from other people's stupidity, and had im
mense amounts of fun doing so.
So, what have we learned today? Addiction
to gambling isn't as bad as Mom would make it
seem. It gives you the opportunity to have
friends with nicknames like "Diamond" and
"the Hammer."
It is capable of making any contest — even
women's gymnastics — exciting. And, most impor
tantly, gambling always gives you something to do.
After all, it's only a problem if you're losing.
