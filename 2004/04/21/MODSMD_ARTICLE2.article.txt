# Executive election results rejected; Schwartz not to run with Husbands
## 
### BRENDAN SELBY STAFF WRITER 
Amid charges of campaign misconduct and unfair
ness, the ASSU Undergraduate Senate last night
voted six to two not to certify the highly contested re
sults of the ASSU executive race that took place on
April 8 and 9.
A special election will likely take place on Thurs
day and Friday of next week. This election will be open
to new candidates and new slates. Junior Ajani Hus
bands and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz have already
announced that they will not run again as a slate; this
does not preclude the possibility that either of them
will run with another candidate.
All of the results from the spring election besides the
executive race were certified unanimously.
The Senate's decision has no precedent in recent
electoral history. In 2000, there was a executive runoff
when neither of the two slates in the race obtained a
majority of students' votes, and last year, the race for
Senior Class president was challenged before the Sen
ate. But in neither case were the results of the original
election rejected.

Before the executive certification vote, senators
were instructed by Senate Chair Josh Shipp, a junior,
to base their decision on a clause in the ASSU Consti
tution that states, "Grounds for not certifying an elec
tion shall include, but need not be limited to, devia
tions that were avoidable and could possibly have af
fected the outcome of any issue in the election."
Last week, senators had discussed whether alleged
campaign violations this year, including endorsement
e-mails sent after the campaign deadline to the Junior
and Senior Class president mailing lists on behalf of
the slate of senior Mikey Lee and junior Dylan Mef
ford. At that meeting, the Elections Commission rec
ommended that the election be certified, but the issue
of alleged Campaign Practice Code violations and
their effect on the results was left unresolved.
"The Elections Commission presented the Un
dergraduate Senate with all the evidence we had com
piled about alleged campaign violations, and we left it
up to them to decide whether it was unfair within the
constraints imposed by the ASSU Constitution," said
Elections Commissioner Ellie Martin, a junior.
Senators on both sides of the vote expressed serious
concern about campaign misconduct.

"I voted not to certify because I felt the elections
were getting out of hand the past few years, and this is
the only way to get people to take the campaign seri
ously," said Senator Sandeep Wasan, a sophomore.
"This year was probably the biggest infraction we've
ever had."
He added, "It is unfortunate for Mikey and Dylan
because they were a great slate and were cooperative
during the entire process."
Senator Chris Lin, a junior, was one of the two dis
senting votes in favor of certification. Lin said that he
felt that the infractions were not egregious enough to
warrant rejecting the election results. However, he
said that he did not take the final vote count, which
went in favor of the Lee-Mefford slate, into consider
ation when voting.
Schwartz, who is also a senator, agreed that the Sen
ate's decision was based on flaws in the process and not
the results of the election.
"The decision that was made tonight was not
based on who won, but on whether it was a fair elec
tion," she said.
