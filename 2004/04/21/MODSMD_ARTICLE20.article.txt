# Reserves key in Card win
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford baseball team has won its
fair share of games with one of its most con
sistent lineups in recent memory. So some
of the reserves decided make their own
mark and put a stamp on a Stanford win.
Freshman Greg Reynolds picked up a
win in his first collegiate start while Chris
Lewis had his first hits and RBIs of the
season and catcher John Hester had a
solid game defensively in only his third
start as the No. 2 Cardinal cruised past St.
Mary's last night at Sunken Diamond. 10-
5, for its ninth consecutive win.
With the win, the 2004 Cardinal be
came only the second team in school his
tory to win 30 of its first 35 games. The
1967 Cardinal started 30-3-2.
"It's impressive, and you've got to
give this team its due," Stanford manag
er Mark Marquess said. "We've found a
way to win a lot of games. Usually when
you play a non-conference schedule like
we do, your record suffers. But not with
this team."
Stanford has beaten St. Mary's 19 con
secutive times, dating back to a 1-0 loss at
home on Feb. 1,1994.
Every Stanford starter had at least one
hit as the Cardinal tied its season best with
18 hits. Even light-hitting shortstop Chris
Minaker had three hits and two RBIs.
The most important development,
however, was the solid performance
turned in by Reynolds in his first start. Up
until Tuesday, the 6-foot-8 freshman had
seen only limited action — four appear
ances out of the bullpen — because of
early-season injury troubles.
Reynolds had tendonitis flare up
mysteriously in his right elbow, and the
coaches did everything they could to fig
ure out the cause of the injury, including
carefully examining the right-hander's
pitching motion.

But they could find nothing, and decided rest was the
best option.
So Reynolds sat out much of the year, waiting to
prove the promise he had shown as a highly-recruited
pitcher out of nearby Pacifica.
And he shined in his first extended outing, pitching a
career-high five innings while striking out a career-best

four batters and allowing only two runs on five hits.
Reynolds ran into trouble in the top of the second
when he gave up two runs on three hits — including
back-to-back doubles — but allowed only one hit during
the rest of his outing.
"I just tried to block it out of my mind," Reynolds said
of his second inning struggles. "I threw how I knew how
and tried to get batters out."

With freshman left-hander Blake Holler struggling
recently, Reynolds was perhaps auditioning for the third
starter's role.
"I knew going that long would be one of the tests I
would have to pass in order to get a starting role," he
said. "There were spots where 1 needed to keep the
