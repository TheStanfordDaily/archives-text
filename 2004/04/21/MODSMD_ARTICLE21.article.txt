## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford women's lacrosse
team (8-6, 4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) suffered a 9-5 loss to No. 6
Duke on Friday at Koskinen Stadium, but
managed to bounce back and tally a win
over unranked Davidson on Sunday on
the same field, 16-5.
The Cardinal's loss on Friday evening
at Duke's home field was Stanford's sec
ond straight loss and improved the Blue
Devils' record to 9-4.
The initial 14 minutes of the first half
proved to be uneventful, as the score
board remained blank.
However, with 15:43 remaining in the
first. Duke's Lauren Kickham scored the
game's opening goal. Just 11 seconds
later. Duke's Meghan Walters gained
possession of the ball in the draw control
and sprinted up the field to boost the lead
to 2-0.
Stanford responded with a goal by se
nior midfielder Abbi Hills with just under
12 minutes left in the first. Inspired by
Hills' goal, freshman midfielder Liz Pisel
li scored her first career goal two minutes
later to tie up the score.
With less than eight minutes remain
ing in the half, Duke netted another goal,
augmenting its lead to 3-2.
The Blue Devils charged ahead as they
scored three goals within the last 1:12 of
the half, giving them a lead that proved
insurmountable for the Cardinal.
Energized after halftime, senior Kim
Cahill scored with under 19 minutes re
maining in the game and then helped ju

nior Nina Pantano net a goal at 45:34, tal
lying her fourth assist of the season.
Determined to maintain its lead, how
ever, Duke scored two more goals to in
crease its lead to 8-4.
Fighting until the last second. Hills
scored her 27th goal of the season in the
final minute of the game. However, the
Blue Devils, determined to have the last
word, scored again in the last 20 seconds
of the game to finalize the score at 9-5.
"We matched Duke in terms of inten
sity and defense throughout the game,"
Piselli said. "The only difference was the
last minute or so of the first half."
After a couple days of rest, the team
proved to be more successful against the
Davidson Wildcats than it had been ver
sus Duke on Friday and more successful
than it had been last week against the
Wildcats from Northwestern. Deter
mined not to lose at Koskinen Stadium
twice in one weekend, Stanford trounced
Davidson on Sunday evening, improving
its record to 8-6.
Charged with intensity, Stanford
scored nine goals, three by Hills, in the
first half before Davidson finally netted
one, making the score 9-1 at halftime.
After halftime, Davidson's Ruthie Hill
reduced Stanford's lead to 9-3 by scoring
the first two goals of the second period.
After allowing those goals, Stanford
bore down, while the offensive unit took
control and boosted Stanford's lead to 14-3
with five straight goals, the last of the streak
coming with about 20 minutes left.
