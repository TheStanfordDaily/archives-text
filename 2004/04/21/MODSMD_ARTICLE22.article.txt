# Men's lacrosse secures playoff berth with win over Cal
## 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It was do or die for the Stanford men's lacrosse team
this weekend against California â€” if it won, the Cardinal
would clinch its second straight West Coast Lacrosse
League playoff berth. If it lost, its season would be over.
With everything on the line, the Cardinal was able to
hold off the Golden Bears, grabbing a 13-7 victory as well
as a spot in the WCLL playoff tournament.
With Cal Poly's win over Chico State, the Cardinal (6-
7, 4-2 WCLL North) moved into third place in the
WCLL North Conference behind nationally-ranked
Sonoma State and Cal Poly. No. 20 Chico State, which

fell from third to fourth in the standings after its loss,
rounds out the field for the WCLL playoffs.
Earning the third seed, Stanford will face second
seeded Cal Poly in the first round of the playoffs. Cal
Poly, ranked in the top 20. defeated the Cardinal at
home, 14-6, earlier in the season.
While the Mustangs will prove to be a tough match-up
for the Cardinal, the team is happy that it will not have to
face division leader Sonoma State until the second and
final round, should it beat Cal Poly next weekend.
To beat the Mustangs, the Cardinal will have to try to
get out to an earlier start than it did when the two teams
last met in February. The Cardinal was out-shot, 39-25,
and lost 12-of-20 faceoffs in that game.

The Cardinal defense will also have to control Cal Poly's
potent offense. Kenny Williams, Tim Casey and Peter Reed
have each scored over 18 goals for the Mustangs this past
season, with Casey also registering 18 assists.
The Cardinal should fare well, however, if it plays
with the same intensity that it did against Cal this past
weekend. The offense put up a balanced scoring attack
with five players contributing goals.
Sophomore attacker Alex Choo found the net two
times, while senior midfielder David Simpson and
sophomore midfielder Tyler Gutierrez each scored
three goals.
Sophomore goalie Michael Zell, who finished the reg
ular season with a solid .541 save percentage, also played

well in Saturday night's game, posting 13 saves.
Junior attacker Brooks Kinkaid finishes the season as
the team's leading scorer. Kinkaid averaged just over
two goals per game for the Cardinal this season, finishing
with 24 goals and 7 assists.
Gutierrez finished the regular season with 15 goals,
while freshman midfielder Ben Stillman tallied 12 goals
and 9 assists in his rookie campaign.
"We've had a tough season, and at times it felt like we
almost came apart," Choo said of the team's regular sea
son. "However, it has been great to see younger, inexpe
rienced players step up when we've needed them."
The Cardinal will play its first playoff game next
weekend at Cal Poly.
