# Women win twice in SoCal
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's tennis
team (23-0) ended its spectacular Pacific
10 Conference run this weekend with wins
over No. 5 Southern California (16-6) and
No. 8 UCLA (16-7).
The southern California sweep se
cured Stanford's position as Pac-10
league champions for the 17th year in a
row, a feat that will earn them a berth
into next month's NCAA Champi
onships as a high seed.
But despite a 5-2 victory over the Bru
ins and a stunning shutout of the Women
of Troy, 7-0, opening match play proved
challenging for the Cardinal.
Friday's match at the Los Angeles Ten
nis Center was the first time that Stanford
conceded the doubles point for the first
time all season.
Stanford's No. 2 and No. 3 doubles
teams of Alice Barnes / Amber Liu and
Emilia Anderson / Anne Yelsey, respec
tively, broke under the Bruins' pressure.
The No. 20 team of Jackie Carleton and
Feriel Esseghir quickly overpowered No.
58 sophomores Barnes and Liu (17-3), 8-3.
"Their team was more aggressive, and
they just played better [than we did] that
day," Liu said.
Added Barnes: "We aren't panicking
though, there is plenty of time for us to
correct the few problems we have before
NCAAs. We will be working very hard to
make sure we don't lose again."
Senior Anderson and freshman Yelsey
suffered a similar fate, falling to the un
ranked duo of Sarah Gregg and Laura
Gordon, 8-4.
Heading the doubles lineup, the veter
an top-ranked tandem of senior Lauren
Barnikow and junior Erin Burdette (27-2)
also struggled against the Bruins' No. 18
Lauren Fisher and Daniela Bercek.
"Erin [Burdette] and I came out flat and
just not ready to go," Barnikow said. "We
were down 4-0 in a matter of 15 minutes."
This marks the third season Barnikow and
Burdette have been paired together.
Improving in consistency each season,
the two cut down their dual match losses
from eight in their first season to four in
their second.
With an ITA Northwest Championship
title in the books and a mere two losses
this year, the No. 1 team looked past their
starting scoreboard deficit to their final
lofty goals.
"We weren't making them play any
balls [because] we were just missing [our
shots]," Barnikow said. "[Stanford volun
teer coach Brian Ramirez] came out and
said, 'OK girls, just stay in it.' So as soon as
we gave them a chance to make a mistake,
we regained our confidence."
The Cardinal rallied back to win that

match, 8-5, a result identical to the two
teams' first meeting in February.
The Cardinal then pried five singles
matches from the Bruins' eager paws.
Competing in the No. 4 singles spot, No. 45
Barnikow (31-4) edged out Gregg in three
sets to clinch the dual match for Stanford,
3-6, 6-1,6-3.
Undefeated in dual match play this sea
son, Barnikow, with her tentative win over
UCLA, reflected an unusual instability
among Stanford players that day.
"At one point, all of the Stanford play
ers on the backcourt were losing their
matches," Barnikow said. "None of us
could see what was going on with the
other three players, and it was definitely a
little scary."
After the demise in the doubles arena.
No. 72 Anderson (22-6) was the first to go
in singles, deferring in the No. 6 slot to
Gordon, 6-1, 6-0.
Competing in the No. 5 singles slot,
freshman Theresa Logar (30-2) brought
the Cardinal back up to speed, downing
Fisher in straight sets, 6-4, 6-1. Teammates
Barnes, Burdette, and Liu all followed suit
with victories.
No. 39 Logar, like Barnikow, boasts
an unblemished record in 2004 dual
match play.
But Barnikow, unlike Logar, reports
feeling less than satisfied with her recent
game play.
"Sometimes when you hit the ball you
can feel it really well, you just think [mo
mentarily] about where you want to meet
the ball on your racket and it just goes
there," Barnikow said. "But recently I've
felt like I had to think about hitting too
much, to the point where I've been over
correcting my shots."
Despite, or perhaps due to the rocky
start against UCLA, Stanford came out fir
ing on the courts at the Women of Troy's
Marks Tennis Stadium on Saturday.
"Winning the doubles point so deci
sively at [Southern California] gave us a
lot of confidence going into the singles,"
Barnes said. "Also, the fact that the Pac
-10 title was on the line in that match
made us more focused and determined to
[be authoritative]."
Five of the six singles players won in
straight sets, including defending NCAA
singles champion and lineup-header Liu,
who defeated No. 13 Luana Magnani, 6-
0, 6-2.
Competing in the No. 3 singles slot. No.
25 Burdette (21-3) eased by Anca Anasta
siu after being blanked in the second set, 6-
1,0-6,6-4.
"This is one of our best years in terms
of the depth of our team," Liu said. "We
are all excited that we had such a great
regular season, and we are ready to work
hard to be fully prepared for NCAAs
in May."
