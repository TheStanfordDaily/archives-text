Last weekend, Stanford's Su
perfly took advantage of some
good fortune to win the Northern
California Sectionals tourna
ment. Seven teams participated
in this giant round robin where
everyone played everyone
else one time, and then the top
two finishers played again in a
final match.
The first challenge on the Sat
urday was Stanford's traditional
enemy, California, and after
pulling out an early lead Superfly
held strong to finish 10-6. The
next tough match pitted them
against UC-Davis, and a promis
ing early display put the team up
3-1. However, windy playing con
ditions and several defensive
lapses allowed the opposition to
go on an eight-point run, leading
to a 13-6 victory for Davis.
Following this loss Superfly
then faced UC-Santa Cruz, but
kept its nerve to control the en
tire game and win 9-3.
After Cal defeated UC-Davis
late in the afternoon, it looked
like it was all over for the Cardi
nal, with Stanford, Cal and UC-
Davis all tied, but the latter two
ahead on points.
Nevertheless, Sunday morn
ing brought a surprise upset, as
UC-Santa Cruz overcame
Berkeley and set up a final be
tween Superfly and UC-Davis.
Given another chance and hun
gry to avenge for the previous
day's loss, the Cardinal played
impeccably and crushed UC-
Davis, 15-7, to take the win and
the No. 1 seed in Regionals.
Next the team heads to Corval
lis, Ore., for Regional action on
May 8-9, where it hopes to qualify
for the Nationals in Seattle. A
tough schedule looms ahead as the

Northwest region is undoubtedly
the toughest in the country, as it
includes four of the top 10 teams in
the country. The team must place
in the top two to qualify.
Women's Rugby
During the Sweet Sixteen Na
tional tournament at Penn State
last weekend, the Stanford
women's rugby team's hopes of
a perfect season were dashed. In
a hard-fought game against
Penn State on Saturday the Car
dinal finished the first half
with an 8-5 lead, but home ad
vantage helped Penn State to
come back and in the end Stan
ford lost, 29-15, and was
knocked out of the tournament.
However, on Sunday the women
rallied and showed their real
strength to beat the University
of Northern Colorado, 43-0, in a
consolation match.
This marked the end of the cur
rent season and the last match for
graduating seniors Leslie Johnson
and Sarita Ocon, and for cotermi
nal student Felicia Gilbert, all of
whom will be missed.
The Stanford players and
coaching staff would like to thank
the parents and alumni who made
the trip to Penn State and for ev
eryone else who supported them
during the season.
Running
On Monday three members of
the running team travelled to
Massachusetts to compete in the
108 th Boston Marathon. Ben
Cowan, Dan Anthony and Ashley
Carroll all finished the course,
registering times of 3:20:51,
3:31:14 and 3:48:18, respectively.
