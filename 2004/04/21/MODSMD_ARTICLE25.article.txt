# Absolutely no drama exists in twilight golf
## 
### 
And they called him El Diablo. As we
hopped out of our non-Volvo and head
ed to the practice green, we were first
drawn to the man that would no doubt
fill out our foursome. Dressed in black Tiger
Woods gear from head to toe — shoes, pants, dri
fit mock turtleneck, sweater vest, hat, golf glove.
Matrix-style sunglasses — this stout fireplug of a
man, clutching a tennis racquet of a driver as he
eyed our approach to the clubhouse, symbolized
everything beautiful about Twilight Golf.
Sure, El Diablo — better known to locals as
Darkness — swung the club like a hockey stick
and played a sleeve of Titleists a hole. But he had
an electronic distance finder and customized elk
hide club grips. He meant business, from his duff
off the first tee down into the busy street below,
to the cold-as-ice stare he maintained even on the
walk back to his non-Volvo after the round. Twi
light golf, where one can find the best gear and

the most random assortment of
foursome add-ons — guys who
would've been playing with Els if
their wives hadn't made them get
a real job. This is where the
leisure disappears from the
leisure sport, where players come
to play.
Just ask Ryan Huss.
A junior who transferred into
Toyon Hall (Toyacht Club —

"Good Times on Boats!" . . . nothing . . . relevant
. . . about this statement) last year from Florida
State, Ryan is a born golf club swinger who
played Division I golf, as the opportunity did, in
fact, present itself.
He is a powerful ball striker, able to play the
up and down game, the soft fade, the bump "n' run
from 170 yards out and the long ball off the tee.
And watch out, he just bought a new straw hat.
Ask him and he'll be sure to point out that, "It's a
great hat for golf."
He drives a Toyota Tacoma that's either a 1998
or 2000 model and a best-selling 4-x-4 vehicle
four years running, says "D-I, c'maawwoonn" in
stead of "D-I, come on" and is a fanatic for
weightlifting documentaries and the Homeward
Bound movies. But boy, can that kid stick a sand
wedge close to the jar.
Should we really be surprised, though? After all,
Ryan is roommates with Ben Huston, Stanford's
columnist-proclaimed intramural soccer king.
The great ones always end up together. Thelma
and Louise, Batman and Robin, Mia Hamm and
Nomar, Superman and He-man. It's just science.
Starsky and Hutch, the Jordan vs. Bird NES game,
the Goonies and Sloth, Mary Kate and Ashley, the
guys with the tigers, Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man,
Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch.
It's hard to find something legitimate or inter
esting to write about twilight golf. It's mostly an
array of meaningless inside jokes that aren't even
funny to those on the inside after hearing them
once or twice over. The quadruple putts from in
side four feet, hitting out of the bunker over the
green and into the other bunker, duffing balls into
squirrels and the course marshal.
OK, so there isn't anything interesting or
worthwhile in writing summaries of weekly ad
ventures besides instilling in readers the feeling
of wanting back the past 10 minutes of their
lives. But it's the easiest thing to do — a dash of
irreverent stream of consciousness, a sprinkle
of tangential jokes and a pinch of inside stories
can always fill a page. Add a heaping table
spoon of soccer, half a bottle of unfathomable
girlfriend stories, stir in three cups of narcis
sism and you've got a columnist recipe for writ
ing perfection.
But that's neither here nor there.
Ryan Huss — whose last name rhymes with
that of the starter up at the pro shop — is a high
ly sought after foursome partner among the
course locals, and many are genuinely infuriated
when they don't get to play in his group.
But Ryan is always quick to flatten turbulent
waters with a compassionate holler, "Don't
worry about it. D-I, c'maawooooooonn. 1 said
come awwwon."
The one drawback to playing twilight golf up
at the course, if there is one, which there isn't,
is that the skill-to-mental headgames ratio is
wayyy out of whack. To be honest, most of the
old birds you get paired with are just not very
good, not good enough to play in Ryan's four
some. Their only means of survival is the men
tal game. We have all been guilty of running
these shenanigans.
Even Ryan once went up behind a 65-year old
on the teebox on hole four and said, "Hey guy,
guu-uuy, I'm in your dome, guy. In the dome. You
think it's your brain ... but it's not. It's me, guy,
running in your dome." Needless to say. the man
was crushed, as he teed into the woods.
Sophomore John Mitchell had his ball marker,
a quarter, picked up and pocketed by one intim
idator in his group on the first six holes of play.
Freshman sharpshooter Andy Jones was hustled
into a bad round when his foursome colluded to
refer to him as Rick James.
Are we noticing a trend?
In their desperate quest to attain intimidator
status from inside size M polo shirts hanging from
their wiry competitive frames, these twilight war
riors battle in embarrassingly pitiful fashion. In
ways that no one will ever care about.
Yet Ryan Huss is still out there for the love of
the sport, taking on El Diablo every Wednesday
with me.
And where there's an inside joke, where
there's something that's got nothing to do with
sports, where there's a tale worth writing in the
diary, there's a sports column.

to the cold-as-ice stare he maintained even on the
walk back to his non-Volvo after the round. Twi
light golf, where one can find the best gear and

the most random assortment of
foursome add-ons — guys who
would've been playing with Els if
their wives hadn't made them get
a real job. This is where the
leisure disappears from the
leisure sport, where players come
to play.
Just ask Ryan Huss.
A junior who transferred into
Toyon Hall (Toyacht Club —

"Good Times on Boats!" . . . nothing . . . relevant
. . . about this statement) last year from Florida
State, Ryan is a born golf club swinger who
played Division I golf, as the opportunity did, in
fact, present itself.
He is a powerful ball striker, able to play the
up and down game, the soft fade, the bump "n' run
from 170 yards out and the long ball off the tee.
And watch out, he just bought a new straw hat.
Ask him and he'll be sure to point out that, "It's a
great hat for golf."
He drives a Toyota Tacoma that's either a 1998
or 2000 model and a best-selling 4-x-4 vehicle
four years running, says "D-I, c'maawwoonn" in
stead of "D-I, come on" and is a fanatic for
weightlifting documentaries and the Homeward
Bound movies. But boy, can that kid stick a sand
wedge close to the jar.
Should we really be surprised, though? After all,
Ryan is roommates with Ben Huston, Stanford's
columnist-proclaimed intramural soccer king.
The great ones always end up together. Thelma
and Louise, Batman and Robin, Mia Hamm and
Nomar, Superman and He-man. It's just science.
Starsky and Hutch, the Jordan vs. Bird NES game,
the Goonies and Sloth, Mary Kate and Ashley, the
guys with the tigers, Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man,
Derek Jeter and Chuck Knoblauch.
It's hard to find something legitimate or inter
esting to write about twilight golf. It's mostly an
array of meaningless inside jokes that aren't even
funny to those on the inside after hearing them
once or twice over. The quadruple putts from in
side four feet, hitting out of the bunker over the
green and into the other bunker, duffing balls into
squirrels and the course marshal.
OK, so there isn't anything interesting or
worthwhile in writing summaries of weekly ad
ventures besides instilling in readers the feeling
of wanting back the past 10 minutes of their
lives. But it's the easiest thing to do — a dash of
irreverent stream of consciousness, a sprinkle
of tangential jokes and a pinch of inside stories
can always fill a page. Add a heaping table
spoon of soccer, half a bottle of unfathomable
girlfriend stories, stir in three cups of narcis
sism and you've got a columnist recipe for writ
ing perfection.
But that's neither here nor there.
Ryan Huss — whose last name rhymes with
that of the starter up at the pro shop — is a high
ly sought after foursome partner among the
course locals, and many are genuinely infuriated
when they don't get to play in his group.
But Ryan is always quick to flatten turbulent
waters with a compassionate holler, "Don't
worry about it. D-I, c'maawooooooonn. 1 said
come awwwon."
The one drawback to playing twilight golf up
at the course, if there is one, which there isn't,
is that the skill-to-mental headgames ratio is
wayyy out of whack. To be honest, most of the
old birds you get paired with are just not very
good, not good enough to play in Ryan's four
some. Their only means of survival is the men
tal game. We have all been guilty of running
these shenanigans.
Even Ryan once went up behind a 65-year old
on the teebox on hole four and said, "Hey guy,
guu-uuy, I'm in your dome, guy. In the dome. You
think it's your brain ... but it's not. It's me, guy,
running in your dome." Needless to say. the man
was crushed, as he teed into the woods.
Sophomore John Mitchell had his ball marker,
a quarter, picked up and pocketed by one intim
idator in his group on the first six holes of play.
Freshman sharpshooter Andy Jones was hustled
into a bad round when his foursome colluded to
refer to him as Rick James.
Are we noticing a trend?
In their desperate quest to attain intimidator
status from inside size M polo shirts hanging from
their wiry competitive frames, these twilight war
riors battle in embarrassingly pitiful fashion. In
ways that no one will ever care about.
Yet Ryan Huss is still out there for the love of
the sport, taking on El Diablo every Wednesday
with me.
And where there's an inside joke, where
there's something that's got nothing to do with
sports, where there's a tale worth writing in the
diary, there's a sports column.

And they called him El Diablo. As we
hopped out of our non-Volvo and head
ed to the practice green, we were first
drawn to the man that would no doubt
fill out our foursome. Dressed in black Tiger
Woods gear from head to toe — shoes, pants, dri
fit mock turtleneck, sweater vest, hat, golf glove.
Matrix-style sunglasses — this stout fireplug of a
man, clutching a tennis racquet of a driver as he
eyed our approach to the clubhouse, symbolized
everything beautiful about Twilight Golf.
Sure, El Diablo — better known to locals as
Darkness — swung the club like a hockey stick
and played a sleeve of Titleists a hole. But he had
an electronic distance finder and customized elk
hide club grips. He meant business, from his duff
off the first tee down into the busy street below,
to the cold-as-ice stare he maintained even on the
walk back to his non-Volvo after the round. Twi
