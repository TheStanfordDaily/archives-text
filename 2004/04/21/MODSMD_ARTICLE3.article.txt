Stanford's Queer Awareness Days — cel
ebrating queer voluntary student organiza
tions on campus and seeking to raise aware
ness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender
and queer issues — began Monday and will
continue until April 29. Programs are spon
sored by the LGBT Community Resources
Center (LGBT-CRC) and include perfor
mances, art exhibitions, book readings and
workshops.
As part of the larger series of events, stu
dents will observe a National Day of Silence
today, a national youth movement protesting
the silence faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people and their allies. Stanford
students were encouraged to pick up free T
shirts Friday through Tuesday and wear them
in solidarity and silence for the entire day.
A silent lunch will be held at noon in White
Plaza and a "Breaking the Silence" ceremony
will begin at 8 p.m. this evening at the LGBT
CRC with spoken word and reflection.
Stanford has had Queer Awareness Days
since 1974, when the LGBT-CRC was first es
tablished. Events have aimed to make visible
the accomplishments, challenges and de
mands of the queer community.
According to LGBT-CRC Director Ben
jamin Davidson, immense improvements in
queer awareness and rights have been made
at Stanford over the past 30 years. For exam
ple, Stanford was the first university to pro
vide married-student housing for same-sex
couples and one of the first to provide do
mestic-partner benefits.
"LGBT students have consistently chal
lenged the University to do a better job sup
porting and including them, and the Universi
ty has, in most cases, responded impressive-

ly," said Davidson.
However, Davidson
added that many of these
gains have been hard won.
"LGBT students still
struggle with many of the
same issues as they did 30
years ago — social isolation,
the strain of coming out and
social and legal discrimina
tion," he said. "We can still
do a better job supporting
them at Stanford, especially
transgender students, in
both the policy and student
service arenas."
Many of the events held
during Queer Awareness
Days explore the intersec
tions between sexuality and
categories such as race and
gender. Some of the fea
tured events include a per
formance by Staceyann
Chin, a nationally
renowned poet featured on
Def Poetry Jam: a talk by
M. Jacqui Alexander titled
"The New Militarization,
The State and the Making
of the Citizen Patriot;"
and a discussion about the
intersections of race
based civil and queer
rights with attorney
Glenn D. Magpantay.

All events are open to
the entire Stanford community as well as
local communities in effort to draw audi
ences that are normally uninvolved and in
experienced in LGBT issues.
"We welcome and encourage support.

solidarity and participation campus-wide
and on any level people feel comfortable
with," said student organizer Linda Tran,
a sophomore.
