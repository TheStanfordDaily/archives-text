# Gravity Probe launches into orbit
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After 43 years and the work of thousands of hands. Gravity Probe
B successfully made its way into orbit yesterday morning, to the ap
plause of several hundred observers in Cubberley Auditorium.
The $700 million experiment, designed to test Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity, launched at 9:57 a.m. after the first launch at
tempt was scrubbed the day before.
As of press time, everything was functioning normally on the
spacecraft, which survived the launch, the riskiest stage of its 43-year
odyssey from conception to measurement.
"I'm the happiest I've been since my son was born 15 years ago,"
said Michael Simon, a software engineer with Lockheed Martin who
has been working on the project for six years.
David Hipkins, who works on the suspension system, brought his
two daughters, ages two and five, to the launch broadcast to celebrate
the project he's been working on for 11 years.
"They've been saying 5-4-3-2-1 blastoff for two weeks," he said.
Hipkins said it was hard to describe what it felt like to finally send
the rocket into orbit.
"It's emotional and a thrill," he said.
More observers came yesterday than watched the failed launch on
Monday, even though it was by then a day behind schedule.
"1 was just as nervous as yesterday, just as excited," said Jennifer
Bower, a first year mechanical engineering graduate student who is
working on the project.

The probe will not begin its measurements for another 40 to 60
days while it undergoes calibration. Then it will begin to make precise
measurements of the space around the Earth over the probe's one
year lifespan, trying to sense two effects predicted by Albert Einstein.
One effect, called the geodetic effect, has to do with how mass
bends space like a bowling ball on a bed sheet. Though this occurs
with every object, the effect can only be measured for massive objects
like the Earth. One might expect that the circumference around the
Earth would be two-pi multiplied by the radius; however, the circum
ference is actually one inch shorter due to gravity. The probe will
measure this distance, and it will examine that "missing inch 100
times more accurately than previous experiments.
The probe will also measure a process called frame-dragging
where the rotation of the Earth moves the space around it. This effect
has never been directly measured.
In order to make these measurements, the probe needs extremely
precise equipment, much of which did not exist when it was first con
ceived at Stanford in 1959.
At the heart of the probe are four ping-pong-ball-sized glass
spheres coated in the metal niobium. These spheres spin in cavities
with .001 inches between them and the walls, acting as near-perfect
gyroscopes. Once spinning, the spheres will continue spinning the
same way, allowing them to be used as accurate measures of time and
space.
To make measurements with enough precision, these gyroscopes
