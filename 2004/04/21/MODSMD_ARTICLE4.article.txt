# Gravity Probe launches into orbit
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
After 43 years and the work of thousands of hands. Gravity Probe
B successfully made its way into orbit yesterday morning, to the ap
plause of several hundred observers in Cubberley Auditorium.
The $700 million experiment, designed to test Einstein's Theory of
General Relativity, launched at 9:57 a.m. after the first launch at
tempt was scrubbed the day before.
As of press time, everything was functioning normally on the
spacecraft, which survived the launch, the riskiest stage of its 43-year
odyssey from conception to measurement.
"I'm the happiest I've been since my son was born 15 years ago,"
said Michael Simon, a software engineer with Lockheed Martin who
has been working on the project for six years.
David Hipkins, who works on the suspension system, brought his
two daughters, ages two and five, to the launch broadcast to celebrate
the project he's been working on for 11 years.
"They've been saying 5-4-3-2-1 blastoff for two weeks," he said.
Hipkins said it was hard to describe what it felt like to finally send
the rocket into orbit.
"It's emotional and a thrill," he said.
More observers came yesterday than watched the failed launch on
Monday, even though it was by then a day behind schedule.
"1 was just as nervous as yesterday, just as excited," said Jennifer
Bower, a first year mechanical engineering graduate student who is
working on the project.

The probe will not begin its measurements for another 40 to 60
days while it undergoes calibration. Then it will begin to make precise
measurements of the space around the Earth over the probe's one
year lifespan, trying to sense two effects predicted by Albert Einstein.
One effect, called the geodetic effect, has to do with how mass
bends space like a bowling ball on a bed sheet. Though this occurs
with every object, the effect can only be measured for massive objects
like the Earth. One might expect that the circumference around the
Earth would be two-pi multiplied by the radius; however, the circum
ference is actually one inch shorter due to gravity. The probe will
measure this distance, and it will examine that "missing inch 100
times more accurately than previous experiments.
The probe will also measure a process called frame-dragging
where the rotation of the Earth moves the space around it. This effect
has never been directly measured.
In order to make these measurements, the probe needs extremely
precise equipment, much of which did not exist when it was first con
ceived at Stanford in 1959.
At the heart of the probe are four ping-pong-ball-sized glass
spheres coated in the metal niobium. These spheres spin in cavities
with .001 inches between them and the walls, acting as near-perfect
gyroscopes. Once spinning, the spheres will continue spinning the
same way, allowing them to be used as accurate measures of time and
space.

had to be engineered to within 40
atoms of perfectly spherical. If
the Earth were that round, the
tallest mountain would be just
eight feet high.
In the probe, the spheres will
then be cooled down with 645
gallons of liquid helium to 1.8
degrees above absolute zero,
where they become supercon
ducting. When they are this cold,
the spheres emit tiny magnetic
forces indicating the direction
and speed of spin without chang
ing their motion.
In addition to taking precise
measurements, the probe must
minimize external noise so that
it can pick up on very subtle
gravitational effects. This
noise can come from, among
many factors, heat, gravity, vi

brations or magnetic fields.
For this reason the probe is
magnetically shielded, protect
ed in a cement-mixer-sized
thermos bottle and arranged in
an orbit, 650 kilometers from
Earth, where it will drifting
will be minimized
"There's a large difference
between the simple concept and
implementation," said Bill
Bencze, the payload electronics
manager.
Since its conception, the pro
gram has almost been canceled
seven times due to cost overruns
and test failures. Each time, re
search Prof. Francis Everitt lob
bied lawmakers to reinstate
funding for the project. Among
its setbacks, the system had to be
drastically redesigned, after the
Challenger disaster, to be
launched independent of a space
shuttle. And last December, it
was weeks from launch when an
electrical problem brought the
probe back.

So yesterday's delay was
nothing new for the team work
ing on the probe.
"It took so long that there
wasn't a big peak," Hipkins said.
"Yesterday it didn't hit me.
Everything around [Gravity
Probe B] is built around no er
rors. The fact that it was delayed
there didn't seem strange."
For many of the more than
100 scientists employed at Stan
ford to work on the mission, this
is not just a regular project.
"This is a one-of-a-kind mis
sion," Simon said. "People put
far more of their lives into this
than a communications satel
lite."
Now, with the most risky stage
complete, scientists are looking
forward to finally taking mea
surements.
"We've had a lot of delays,"
said John Mester, who is in
charge of the payload-integra
tion team. "This is a new begin
ning for us."
