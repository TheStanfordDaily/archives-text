# Residency 'match' system questioned
## 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three physicians recently filed a lawsuit against the
"Match" system through which through which thou
sands of fourth-year medical students across the country
are matched with residency training programs. The
physicians, who are represented by 15 law firms, claim
that the system violates anti-trust law and denies stu
dents the right to negotiate terms of employment with
the residency programs.
The computerized system, which processes prefer
ences provided by both the applicants and the programs,
annually matches approximately 20.(X)0 fourth-year
medical students to residency programs through a com
puterized system, which processes preferences provided
by both the applicants and the programs.
On April 14 of last week, Congress delivered a blow
to the plaintiffs' lawsuit by passing a bill with an attached
amendment that exempts teaching hospitals, several of
whom are defendants in the case, from antitrust lawsuits.
The bill, though, has yet to go into effect.
Thirty organizations — including the National Resi
dent Match Program (NRMP), which runs the comput
erized matching system, and the American Association
of Medical Colleges — were named as defendants in the
lawsuit. A court ruling last February dropped six of the
original 30 defendants, including the American Med
ical Association, Irom the lawsuit. The NRMP re
mains a defendant.
Presently, the remaining defendants are appealing
the court's decision to deny their motions to dismiss the
case. Additionally, the controversy surrounding the
match system has gained increasing national and media
attention.
In a February press release regarding the lawsuit,
NRMP representatives asserted that the organization
should not be held liable.
NRMP representatives said they are appealing the
decision made by the courts in an effort to save the
match system, which they see as setting educational stan
dards for residency programs and more importantly,
"enabling candidates to compete more effectively fora
wider range of positions and to secure a residency of
their own choosing without pressure."

According to the press release, "The NRMP does not
mandate, oversee or review any terms of residency pro
grams, including compensation. No student can be
matched to a residency program he or she did not specif
ically rank, nor can a program be matched with students
it did not rank."
Many members of the medical community have
spoken out against the lawsuit, citing the difficulties
that medical students had to undergo in finding res
idencies before the match system was implemented
in 1952.
Dr. Julie Parsonnet, Stanford's senior associate
dean for medical education, described the period be
fore the match as chaotic, with unfair agreements made
under the table.
" The chances of an applicant getting into a good res
idency were almost non-existent, unless he came from a
top institution or knew someone involved in the appli
cant selection," Parsonnet said. "Now all residency pro
grams are restricted to 80 hours per week. And though
we are not allowed to discuss salaries among hospitals,
most salaries are proportionate to cost of living where
you are. All students are aware of these facts when they
apply to residency programs."
Parsonnet said that although they are fully aware of
its problems, the majority of medical students around
the country support the match system due to its relative
success at matching students to specific residencies in
their desired fields.
"Students take the Match very seriously," said Philip
Ecker, a graduating Stanford medical student. "It repre
sents the single point in time where your specific career
is determined, so students do not apply for residency po
sitions that they would not feel comfortable taking. Most
students have a good relationship with their choice of
residencies."
Since the lawsuit was first filed, several changes
have been implemented on the Match system. Ac
cording to NRMP, starting with next year's Match
process, residency programs will need to provide med
ical student interviewees with a copy of the contract
applicants would have to adhere to if accepted and
matched to the program.
"Stanford strongly and fully supports the match sys
tem." Parsonnet said.
