# Class designs Guatemalan center
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Since last spring, architecture classes taught by Civil and
Environmental Engineering lecturers Marga Jann and David
Nieh have been working on the construction of a community
center and school in Amatitlan, Guatemala. Tomorrow,
Jann's current class leaves for the rural town on a mission — to
present and sell their designs to potential clients, architects,
Stanford alumni and the local government.
The class has been working in conjunction with the Center
for the Restoration of Women and the Socially Disregarded
(CEREM), a Christian organization, to develop a campus for
the group. The facility will include everything from dormito
ries to a church and retreat center.

"The pro
jects range from ar
chitectural, like de
signing the admin
istration building
(that is] kind of the
visitors' center for
our community
center, and artistic
like creating house
facade designs, to
engineering like
planning the path
of the road through
our community
center," said junior
Michelle Chang, a
teaching assistant
for the class.
Class mem
bers said they were
committed to en-

suring that their designs are consistent with local Guatemalan
culture and local traditions. According to Chang, students
have been doing research on architecture from sources such as
the Rural Studio and Mexican architect Luis Barragan for in
spiration in their own projects.
"There's a lot of cultural aspects we need to take into con
sideration so that it doesn't feel out of place and so that it in
corporates the aesthetics of the region of the culture down
there of colors and textiles," said sophomore Payam Cherchi
an.
Nevertheless, the designs that students present this week
end will likely be considered radical to the project's potential
funders. The designs are intended not only to provide a living
space, but an environment conducive to rehabilitating prosti
tutes, war widows, orphans, gang members and others in
poverty in Guatemala.
"Our job is to sell our designs." Cherchian said. "The prob
lem is they're used to very low design sensitivity. They live in
very poor conditions and we have to convince them to accept
these designs even though it's harder to build because it pro
vides fora better environment for living and growth."
Unique to the center are the residential units for simulated
nuclear families, which will consist of former prostitutes and
young orphans.
"One of our projects is the houses for the 'mothers', the for
mer prostitutes, to take care of kids. The number of kids is up
for debate, but we are thinking four or five to a house," Cher
chian said.
According to Cherchian, the class has been working on
other non-design related facets of the project.
"There's people working on designing a multipurpose
room that will allow for offices and community events and ac
tivities to take place there." he said. "There's people applying
for grants, there's PR people who contact the different news
papers so we can get attention for our project," he said.
Vice Provost John Bravman and the Institute for Interna
tional Studies provided funding for the upcoming trip.
