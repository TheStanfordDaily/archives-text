w Stanford has recycled, composted,
or otherwise source reduced 54% of its waste in 2003. J
The results are clear: I
cleaner air and water, less pollution, more forested land
and open space, and reduced greenhouse gases.
Everyone knows recycling means less trash going to our landfills.
But the greatest environmental benefits of recycling |
are related not to landfills, but to the conservation of energy and ]
natural resources and the prevention of pollution when a recycled
material, rather than a raw material, is used to make a new product.
