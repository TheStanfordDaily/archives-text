In this riveting account of Biggie's
remarkable life, hip hop journalist
Cheo Hodari Coker tells the story
you've never heard about the
dramatic, tension-filled world of
Biggie, Tupac, Puff Daddy, and Suge
Knight, tracing their friendships and
feuds form the beginning to the bitter
end. Despite the clash of personalities
and styles, all four were key players in
a volatile and creative era of hip hop,
a time when gangsta rap became
popular music.
Before he rocketed to fame as Biggie,
Christopher Wallace was a young
black man growing up in Brooklyn with
a loving single mother. An honors
student who dropped out of school to
sell drugs, Biggie soon discovered
that he had a gift for rocking the
mike. Coker's narrative is based on
exclusive interviews with Biggie's
family and friends, some of whom
have never spoken publicly about
Biggie before.
Compellingly written and brilliantly
illustrated, with rare color and
black-and-white photographs from
VIBE's archives and Biggie's family,
this is an in-depth look at the life and
afterlife of an icon whose music is as
powerful and prevalent as ever. A
virtuoso of flow as well as a master
storyteller, Biggie was arguably the
greatest rapper of all time. We've
heard a lot of speculation about
Biggie's death. Now it's time to
remember his life and celebrate his
work.
