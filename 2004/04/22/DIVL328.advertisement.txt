THE COURT OF
THE RED TSAR
SIMON SEHAG MONTEFIORE
Fifty years after his death, Stalin remains a
figure of powerful and dark fascination.
The almost unfathomable scale of his
crimes, as many as 20 million Soviets died
in his purges and infamous Gulag, has
given him the lasting distinction
as a personification of evil in the
twentieth century. But though the facts of
Stalin's reign are well known, this remark
able biography reveals a Stalin we have
never seen before as it illuminates the vast
foundation, human, psychological and
physical, that supported and encouraged
him, the men and women who did his bid
ding, lived in fear of him and, more often
than not, were betrayed by him. With
stunning attention to detail, Montefiore
documents the crimes, small and large, of
all the members of Stalin's court. And he
traces the intricate and shifting web of their
relationships as the relative warmth of
Stalin's rule in the early 1930s gives way to
the Great Terror of the late 19305, the
upheaval of World War II (there has never
been as acute an account of Stalin's meet
ing at Yalta with Churchill and Roosevelt)
and the horrific postwar years when he ter
rorized his closest associates as unrelent
ingly as he did the rest of his country.
