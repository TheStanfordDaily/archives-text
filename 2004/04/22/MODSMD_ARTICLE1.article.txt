# Donation boosts Islamic studies
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The University's program to ex
pand its offerings in Islamic studies
has been helped by recent donations
to the Stanford Library by Iranian
Emigres including UCLA professor
emeritus Amin Banani. Banani, a
professor of Persian and history who
received his doctorate at Stanford,
donated more than 2,000 items, in
cluding Iranian historical docu
ments and manuscripts.
Banani's donation comes after
last summer's addition of more than
7,000 documents donated by the
heirs of a Turkish emigre. These do
nations are a boost to the Universi
ty's attempt to increase its offerings
in Islamic studies. This program will
be funded by a $9 million endow
ment to increase professorship in Is
lamic Studies.
Stanford and Hoover libraries
are working together to increase
their collections and augment the
new program. Middle East Curator
at Stanford University Library
(SUL) John Eilts and the Head
Hoover Librarian Elena S. Daniel
son are collaborating in this effort.
In an effort to make Islamic ma
terials more accessible, Hoover
closed down part of its Middle East
ern department and moved many
Middle Eastern books to the Stan
ford University Library so that they
could be archived digitally in
Socrates, the SUL online searchable
database, Danielson said. In addi
tion, the Hoover and Stanford li
braries have begun to collaborate
more effectively.

"John Eilts and I are trying to co
ordinate in a more rational way with
each other so that there is no overlap
in each other's efforts," she said.
"We are working with SUL to digi
tize our materials to make docu
ments more readily accessible."
Despite these steps towards a
more viable Islamic program, the
University has a long way to go, ac
cording to Prof. Joel Beinin, an ex
pert in Middle Eastern policy.
"We need a very substantial ex
pansion in Islamic studies." Beinin
said. "The University has taken a
good first step, but we are going to
need more faculty appointments and
more in our libraries if we are going
to have any sort of serious program."
Beinin also criticized the Hoover
Institution as not showing enough
interest in the Middle East. The
Hoover Institute has closed down
some of its Middle East department
and has not had a head curator for
the Middle East since 2002. Curator
emeritus Edward Jajko agreed with
Beinin that perhaps more attention
should be paid to the Middle East by
the Hoover Institution.
"I think it is unfortunate that at
this point in history the Hoover In
stitute has chosen to close down its
Middle Eastern studies depart
ment," Jajko said.
Although there is no longer a
head curator for the Middle East at
the Hoover Institution Library,
Danielson believes that the Univer
sity is taking the right steps to in
crease its collection.
"The lack of a formal curator has
not stopped us from collecting Is
lamic documents," she said. "We are
getting materials from Afghanistan,
Pakistan, from Hamas in Southern

Lebanon and other Middle Eastern
countries through a very effective
network that has been in place for
decades to obtain these items."
The network is made up of jour
nalists, military officers and under
ground contacts, Danielson said.
The Hoover Institute collects prima
ry source documents such as posters,
pamphlets, postcards, insignia and

Hags from 1900 to the present to doc
ument social change while the Stan
ford University Libraries focus on
materials for classes such as academ
ic books.
"It is a very difficult region to col
lect in, and I would not want to send
my employees into parts of the re
gion," said Danielson. "But the
Hoover Institute recruits travelers

and journalists, many who are non-
American so they will not encounter
anti-Americanism."
In addition to increasing collec
tions from the Middle East to boost
Islamic studies, Stanford is looking
to expand its library with additions
from Islamic countries in central
Asia such as Uzbekistan and In
donesia.
