# Destined to drink?
## Looking at our evolutionary past to explain our attraction to alcohol 
### KENDALL MADDEN GUEST COLUMNIST 
A romantic dinner at a fancy French restaurant, a rau
cous party on a Friday night, the Holy Communion, a
Bat/Bar Mitzvah celebration — all of these activities in
volve alcohol. Alcohol pervades the history of the
human race. It has thousands of connotations, from the
most holy to the most degenerate. You can even take a
trip up to Napa Valley where you will witness how the
production of alcohol has evolved into an art form.
There is no doubt about it: Humans are infatuated with
alcohol. But from where does this fascination spring? This
is a question that scientists and doctors have been asking for
a long time, especially in an effort to understand and prop
erly treat the tendency toward alcoholism in many people.
Integrative biologist Prof. Robert Dudley of UC-Berkeley
"thinks he might have the answer.
While studying animal behavior in the rainforest, Dud
ley was first struck by the idea that the human penchant
for alcohol might have a genetic origin. Ethanol, the chem
ical compound in liquor, has been found to occur natural
ly in fruits as they ripen — the metabolic product of sugar
consuming yeasts. Ethanol evaporates quickly, attracting
flies, various species of birds and other insects. Dudley's
theory contends that our primate ancestors also devel
oped sensitivity to the scent of ethanol — a trait which
may have proved evolutionarily advantageous.
Dudley explained several ways in which an increased
sensitivity to ethanol could have benefited our hominid
forebearers. Primarily, sniffing out the scent of alcohol
would have served as mechanism for localization of ripe
fruit. You can liken this to the way that you can easily
smell a frat party from yards away, as the smells emanate
from the cheap, watery beer spilled on the floors.
Many of our primate relatives consume a diet primar
ily composed of fruits, and so it is highly likely that our
ancestors did as well. The enhanced ability to locate fruit
— thus increasing the efficiency in scavenging — would
have been a definite survival plus. If you can hunt out the
food before your neighbor does, your genes will be the
ones passed on to future generations.
Additionally, ethanol may act as an appetite stimulant,
maximizing the animal's ability to use the food resource.
Ethanol itself also has a high caloric value, almost twice that
of carbohydrates. Through evolution, Dudley explained,
the smell of ethanol may have been incorporated into "a
neural link [with] a nutritional reward." In other words, just
as you crave those Twinkies because sugar and fat were
once scarce in the environment, Dudley speculates that
your desire to have a drink or two may also have an evolu
tionary explanation.
If this is the case, then many health concerns associated
with alcohol may be considered maladaptations of a positive
genetic feature under conditions of "nutritional excess."
Though there is a dearth of data on the concentra
tions of ethanol in fruit, alcoholic beverages of human
production contain far more ethanol than does fruit.
And if sensitivity to ethanol is an evolutionary adapta
tion, it arose from a condition of scarcity. Today, living
in a world where alcohol is almost always available has
negated the once advantageous purpose a biological
predilection would serve. As Dudley stated: "Primates
began consuming fruit long before people started going
to college."
As with the increase in obesity, alcoholism may be in
part the result of a biological attraction to ethanol in an
area with a virtually unlimited supply of alcohol. Reach
ing a better understanding of the underlying biological
drivers for addictions, such as alcoholism, will ultimately
help in treating those individuals with substance abuse
problems and in preventing addictions in the first place.
The desire to drink may indeed be partly coded for in
our genes, but given that you're really not going to be
consuming over-ripened fruit at the next party you at
tend, you can't really use evolutionary explanations to
justify your consumption of that 20th shot of beer during
your next power hour. For that, you'll have to find an
other excuse.
