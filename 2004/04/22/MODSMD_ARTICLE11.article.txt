aren't," for example, 'things
that insurance companies
don't pay for' or 'things that
haven't been scientifically
proven to be effective."'
Gardner attributes this fact
to the lack of evidence docu
menting the results of CAM.
"You can't just call it a medi
cal treatment if it makes some
one feel better," he said. "It has
to be clinically validated."
The explosion of
alternative treatments
Public interest in CAM
treatment has mounted steadily
in American society over the
past two decades. Herbal treat
ments are sold in drug stores
and supermarkets — you can
even find Echinacea, an herb
often used to shorten the dura
tion of a cold, in gas station con
venience stores.
Trends show that the medical
industries responding actively to
the demand for CAM treatments.
Several hospitals, including Stan
ford, now offer CAM services
such as acupuncture, and many
insurance companies now pro
vide reimbursement for such
treatments.
Dr. Brenda Golianu, assis
tant professor of anesthesiology
and pain management at the
Stanford Medical School, has
taught a course on Traditional
Chinese Medicine in the Human
Biology department and has
seen enrollment progressively
increase over the past three
years. Her course teaches stu
dents about acupuncture, Tai
Chi and herbal mixtures and has
traditionally included an assign
ment where students shadow an
acupuncture practitioner.
"Initially people were peeking
their head in to see what the
class was about," Golianu said.
"Now I see people being much
more serious about it, thinking
about what they can do with the
subject after the class and start
ing research projects."

Have you ever burned a cou
ple aromatherapy candles while
lounging in a hot bath after a
stressful day? Visited the chiro
practor, gotten a massage or
taken some sort of dietary sup
plement? Did you know that
you were, in essence, employing
complementary alternative
therapies? If not, there's no
need to feel uninformed. Mil
lions of Americans use comple
mentary alternative treatments
every year, most without realiz
ing they are doing so.
Despite being an avenue of
health treatment with which
few associate themselves,
Complementary and Alterna
tive Medicine, CAM, use is
prevalent in the United States.
According to Dr. David Eisen
berg of Harvard University, an
estimated 15 million adults
paired alternative medication
with prescription medication
for treatment in 1997.
Defining CAM proves
to be tricky
CAM comprise a relatively
new frontier in the realm of med
ical research. As a result, pub
lished studies on the subject are
sparse and the results are often
perceived as incomprehensive.
Part of the reason comes from the
problem of defining "alternative"
and "complementary" therapies.
The National Center for Com
plementary and Alternative
Medicine, the government's pri
mary institute for studying com
plementary and alternative heal
ing methods, considers CAM to
be any "medical and health care
systems, practices and products
that are not presently considered
to be part of conventional
medicine." The list of therapies
covered by the center is extensive,
ranging in everything from Tradi
tional Chinese Medicine, TCM,
to using dance as a creative outlet.
"The definition of alternative
medicine is quite a moving tar
get," said Dr. Christopher Gard
ner, assistant professor of
medicine at the Stanford Preven
tion Research Center, SPRC.
"Alternative medicine keeps on

tion necessary. Currently, the
Food and Drug Administration
does not regulate CAM thera
pies. If you purchase any herbal
remedy at a health food store,
you'll notice a statement by the
FDA warning consumers about
claims made by herbal treat
ment companies saying: "These
statements have not been evalu
ated by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration. This product is not
intended to diagnose, treat, cure
or prevent any disease."
Studies that have been pub
lished on CAM have often had
small sample sizes or have pre
sented confounds. TCM treat
ments are particularly difficult
to test using the Western scien
tific medicine "golden-stan
dard medical trail," i.e. the dou
ble-blind, placebo-controlled
study, because they are often
composed of specific mixes of
herbs and minerals individual
ized for each patient. Many
people fear that the fact that
treatments remain unregulated
can lead to the consumption of
unsafe herbs, incorrect dosage
use and / or pharmaceutical /
herb interactions.
"In the past, there were little
studies done on alternative
medicine, yet lots of people
were using them," Gardner said.
He points to the large num
ber of herbal supplements con
tainingTCM treatments. "Com
panies claim that their pills have
the same effect, but when peo
ple Americanize the treatment
by offering it in a capsule instead
of a cup of tea, they may ruin the
acting agent."
At the SPRC, Gardner has
worked on a series of studies
looking at whether the con
sumption of garlic lowers
cholesterol. Initially, he saw no
results from his studies and con
sequently realized that the gar
lic in many commercially avail
able pills was inactive. His stud
ies are now looking at the active
form of allicin, the beneficial
component in garlic, to see if
total cholesterol can be lowered.
"Unless we document the
right and wrong way to use gar
lic to lower cholesterol, people
may keep taking garlic pills
without realizing that the active
ingredient may not even be pre

sent in the pill," he said.
Research rises in response to
popularity of CAM
In response to the popularity
of CAM, government funding
toward this area has grown ex
ponentially over the past few
years. Congress budgeted 20
million dollars toward CAM in
1999 and raised the amount to
66 million in 2001.
At Stanford, Gardner will re
ceive five million dollars over the
next three years for studies on
treatments pertaining to nutri
tion. including comparing vari
ous popular weight-loss diets
and studying the effectiveness of
Ginko Biloba.
Stanford Medical School has
established a CAM Program.
CAMPS, focused on investigat
ing how specific CAM therapies
can help ease the effects of aging.
Even so, certified use of CAM

treatments is still decades away.
Currently, regular pharmaceuti
cal drugs go through multiple tri
als involving animal and human
testing for safety and efficacy.
CAM treatments, if they are to be
regulated by the FDA, will have
to go through a similar process.
The entire sequence is expensive
and time-consuming.
"We need to look at each treat
ment individually and examine
their efficacy," Golianu said.
Nevertheless, the effort is
one worth pursuing. Many al
ternative treatments are milder
and less expensive. For exam
ple, patients who are able to
employ acupuncture to treat
chronic headaches can avoid
side effects often associated
with pain medications.
Added Golianu: "When we
know enough about a treat
ment. we can use it to provide a
great service."

sparse and the results are often
perceived as incomprehensive.
Part of the reason comes from the
problem of defining "alternative"
and "complementary" therapies.
The National Center for Com
plementary and Alternative
Medicine, the government's pri
mary institute for studying com
plementary and alternative heal
ing methods, considers CAM to
be any "medical and health care
systems, practices and products
that are not presently considered
to be part of conventional
medicine." The list of therapies
covered by the center is extensive,
ranging in everything from Tradi
tional Chinese Medicine, TCM,
to using dance as a creative outlet.
"The definition of alternative
medicine is quite a moving tar
get," said Dr. Christopher Gard
ner, assistant professor of
medicine at the Stanford Preven
tion Research Center, SPRC.
"Alternative medicine keeps on

tion necessary. Currently, the
Food and Drug Administration
does not regulate CAM thera
pies. If you purchase any herbal
remedy at a health food store,
you'll notice a statement by the
FDA warning consumers about
claims made by herbal treat
ment companies saying: "These
statements have not been evalu
ated by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration. This product is not
intended to diagnose, treat, cure
or prevent any disease."
Studies that have been pub
lished on CAM have often had
small sample sizes or have pre
sented confounds. TCM treat
ments are particularly difficult
to test using the Western scien
tific medicine "golden-stan
dard medical trail," i.e. the dou
ble-blind, placebo-controlled
study, because they are often
composed of specific mixes of
herbs and minerals individual
ized for each patient. Many
people fear that the fact that
treatments remain unregulated
can lead to the consumption of
unsafe herbs, incorrect dosage
use and / or pharmaceutical /
herb interactions.
"In the past, there were little
studies done on alternative
medicine, yet lots of people
were using them," Gardner said.
He points to the large num
ber of herbal supplements con
tainingTCM treatments. "Com
panies claim that their pills have
the same effect, but when peo
ple Americanize the treatment
by offering it in a capsule instead
of a cup of tea, they may ruin the
acting agent."
At the SPRC, Gardner has
worked on a series of studies
looking at whether the con
sumption of garlic lowers
cholesterol. Initially, he saw no
results from his studies and con
sequently realized that the gar
lic in many commercially avail
able pills was inactive. His stud
ies are now looking at the active
form of allicin, the beneficial
component in garlic, to see if
total cholesterol can be lowered.
"Unless we document the
right and wrong way to use gar
lic to lower cholesterol, people
may keep taking garlic pills
without realizing that the active
ingredient may not even be pre

sent in the pill," he said.
Research rises in response to
popularity of CAM
In response to the popularity
of CAM, government funding
toward this area has grown ex
ponentially over the past few
years. Congress budgeted 20
million dollars toward CAM in
1999 and raised the amount to
66 million in 2001.
At Stanford, Gardner will re
ceive five million dollars over the
next three years for studies on
treatments pertaining to nutri
tion. including comparing vari
ous popular weight-loss diets
and studying the effectiveness of
Ginko Biloba.
Stanford Medical School has
established a CAM Program.
CAMPS, focused on investigat
ing how specific CAM therapies
can help ease the effects of aging.
Even so, certified use of CAM

treatments is still decades away.
Currently, regular pharmaceuti
cal drugs go through multiple tri
als involving animal and human
testing for safety and efficacy.
CAM treatments, if they are to be
regulated by the FDA, will have
to go through a similar process.
The entire sequence is expensive
and time-consuming.
"We need to look at each treat
ment individually and examine
their efficacy," Golianu said.
Nevertheless, the effort is
one worth pursuing. Many al
ternative treatments are milder
and less expensive. For exam
ple, patients who are able to
employ acupuncture to treat
chronic headaches can avoid
side effects often associated
with pain medications.

aren't," for example, 'things
that insurance companies
don't pay for' or 'things that
haven't been scientifically
proven to be effective."'
Gardner attributes this fact
to the lack of evidence docu
menting the results of CAM.
"You can't just call it a medi
cal treatment if it makes some
one feel better," he said. "It has
to be clinically validated."
The explosion of
alternative treatments
Public interest in CAM
treatment has mounted steadily
in American society over the
past two decades. Herbal treat
ments are sold in drug stores
and supermarkets — you can
even find Echinacea, an herb
often used to shorten the dura
tion of a cold, in gas station con
venience stores.
Trends show that the medical
industries responding actively to
the demand for CAM treatments.
Several hospitals, including Stan
ford, now offer CAM services
such as acupuncture, and many
insurance companies now pro
vide reimbursement for such
treatments.
Dr. Brenda Golianu, assis
tant professor of anesthesiology
and pain management at the
Stanford Medical School, has
taught a course on Traditional
Chinese Medicine in the Human
Biology department and has
seen enrollment progressively
increase over the past three
years. Her course teaches stu
dents about acupuncture, Tai
Chi and herbal mixtures and has
traditionally included an assign
ment where students shadow an
acupuncture practitioner.
"Initially people were peeking
their head in to see what the
class was about," Golianu said.
"Now I see people being much
more serious about it, thinking
about what they can do with the
subject after the class and start
ing research projects."
