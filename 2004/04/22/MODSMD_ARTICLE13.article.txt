What hurts more than stubbing your toe, feels as good
as heaven on earth and requires more time and energy
than all your classes combined? Ah, yes. Love.
Let me share with you a letter I recently received:
Dear Mr. Intersimone,
Have you ever heard the song "torn between two lovers?"
I got caught in that "tangled relationship." I know it's
wrong. It's immoral However, I have to say it's made
my life the happiest ever this past year. I'd like to have
your opinion on this subject.
Thanks, Anh
Well Anh, my guess is you're feeling guilty about being
involved in an unconventional relationship and you re won
dering if I can offer you any relief. While it's hard to give you
specific advice without knowing more about your particular
situation, I can try to help you. my readers and myself un
derstand where you're coming from. My hope is that along
the way we'll all also discover something about love itself
(I'm crossing my fingers here).

Aristophanes described love as the desire to be re
united with the person with whom you were once a part
of a whole. He tells the story of how humans were once
the combination of two individuals until Zeus split these
united bodies in two, creating a never-ending desire in
humans to reunite with their other half.
A similar story is told in Genesis. Eve was made from
Adam's rib or, viewed in light of Aristophanes' story.
Adam and Eve were separated from each other when
Eve was made into a separate being. Love is Adam and
Eve's quest to reunite as one being, and sex is the closest
they can get to becoming one person again.
I imagine you feel guilty because you're going against
a particular cultural view of love as occurring between
two individuals. This Western cultural view is older than
the Bible and is still very much apart of the way our soci
ety views love today. Like the stories in the Bible and in
ancient Greek tradition, our love stories nowadays are
dominated by relationships involving only two individu
als. But just because two person relationships are the
norm and have been throughout human history, doesn't
mean what you're doing is wrong.
What is "normal" is perhaps the worst measure of
morality because what society practices regularly is often

flagrantly wrong. It was "normal" for blacks to be slaves
before the Civil War. It is still considered "normal" in
many places to discriminate against gays.
Just because something is not normal, doesn't make
it right. Just because something is abnormal, doesn't
make it wrong.
So Anh, if you're feeling guilty because your love is ab
normal, you're giving into societal pressure that everyone
should feel obligated to check with his or her own morality.
My guess, however, is that you're not feeling guilty because
society is telling you what you're doing is wrong, but be
cause you're telling yourself what you're doing is wrong.
Aristophanes' might have been reinforcing the "nor
mal" view of love as only between two individuals, but the
moral of his story and the moral of Adam and Eve's story
are both still applicable to your situation. Each of these sto
ries equates the strength of love to the strongest bond a per
son has: the bond between a person and their body.
If you truly love two individuals so much that you feel
like you're a part of both of them. I humbly admit I have
no advice to offer you and can only tell you that you're
not a horrible person, but an individual stuck in an im
possible situation. While perhaps unacceptable to soci
ety, a relationship where all three people love each other

equally would at least internally work because all three
people would feel equally a part of one another.
However, 1 imagine you find yourself in a situation
where everyone does not love everyone else and you
know someone is going to get hurt. From my personal ex
perience, one relationship of love takes about all the time
and energy a person has. Someone is going to get less at
tention than he or she deserves, and you're probably
going to kill yourself trying to give attention to everyone.
But maybe I'm wrong. You say you've never been
happier, so maybe it is possible to maintain two rela
tionships. The question then becomes: Is it moral to do
so? Aristophanes got it right: Loving another person is
like sharing the same body. You are cheating the other
two people in your relationship out of their equal share
if you are hiding the fact that someone else holds a part
of you. As Aristophanes' story personifies, love is
about sharing. You can't fairly share yourself with
someone else if that person doesn't know whom else
you belong to.
