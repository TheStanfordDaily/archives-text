## A 						trip to a different world 
### ELISSA TEST RUBEN KOGEL 
Final exams and papers were still
reverberating through our minds as
we headed to San Francisco Airport to
fly to Tegucigalpa. None of us had
ever visited a developing country be
fore, and we quickly recognized the
difference between speaking of the
developing world in a comfortable
classroom at Stanford and actually liv
ing in a poor village in rural Honduras.
Our six-hour bus ride to Cerro
Bonito revealed a montage of poverty:
We rode past dilapidated huts, hous
ing projects that had been hastily built
after the massive destruction caused
by Hurricane Mitch, and sweat shops
where workers are paid the equivalent
of 15 cents for each shirt they make —
shirts that sell for $40 to Abercrombie
shoppers in the U.S.
We could write pages about the
dramatic living conditions of the in
habitants of this community (they
have no electricity, no running
water, most children have no shoes),
but the most memorable part of our
experience was the warmth that the
campesinos shared with us. As we
stepped off the bus, the kids of the
village immediately surrounded us,
drawn by mixed feelings of curiosity
and kindness.
Dona Maria, the "grandmother"
of the community, told us that she felt
our presence came as a blessing to
them. They were moved by the fact
that we, a group of gringos, had trav
eled so far to visit them, learn from
them and help them build two pro
jects that would benefit their commu
nity. Dona Maria's affectionate
words allowed us to see the signifi
cance of our trip: it was more than
building facilities or learning about
their culture; it was about offering
our humanity and compassion for
these people who in return shared

their infinite kindness with us.
Our service project was organized
and funded by Proyecto Aldea Glob
al, a Honduran grassroots organiza
tion, and AJWS, the American Jew
ish World Service. These two organi
zations provide assistance to rural
Honduran villages through small
scale, sustainable projects such as
running health clinics and giving
micro loans to women. Our group
helped build a network of pipelines
to connect the scattered houses
throughout the hillside to a source of
water, and we also assisted in the
construction of an elementary school
for the children of the community.
At times, while we were shovel
ing dirt until our muscles ached,
looking out over the vast country
side, we felt somewhat helpless in
the face of the widespread poverty.
Poverty is not having clean water to
drink and getting sick because of the
unsanitary conditions that are a fact
of life. Poverty is having to travel
three hours on unpaved roads (if
they were lucky enough to borrow a
car and have enough money for gas)
to reach a doctor — something we
observed firsthand one day when a
nine-year old boy from the village
broke his arm.
And this poverty is everywhere.
Eighty percent of Honduras' 6.5 mil
lion people live in poverty, earning
less than one U.S. dollar per day. Hon
duras was hit the hardest by Hurricane
Mitch in 199Kand still has not fully re
covered. The country's vulnerability
to the volatile price fluctuations of ba
nanas and coffee has often lead to
"sweatshops in the fields," where cof
fee farmers receive prices lower than
the costs of production, continuing the
cycle of poverty and debt.
It can be so easy to be numbed by
the sheer enormity of the disparity
of wealth. But coming back to Stan
ford, we feel empowered more than

anything. We know that we must act
on our awareness and spread this
feeling of solidarity.
Our reality is not the reality of most
of the people in the world. Our ac
tions, as individual consumers and as a
country, directly impact the lives of
people thousands of miles away. One
way to help create more sustainable
conditions and improved quality of
life for the coffee farmers of Central
America is to buy fair-trade coffee.
The retail price of fair trade cof
fee reflects the actual cost of produc
ing coffee and not the price estab
lished by the the law of offer and de
mand. This alternative system has
made it possible for many coffee
farmers to have shelter, food and
hope fora brighter future. Make it a
habit to buy Fair Trade coffee dur
ing your morning stop at Peet's.
They'll sell it, you just have to ask for
it. It will inform them that people on
this campus care, which could make
its use more widespread.
In our one week in Honduras, we
knew that our effort wouldn't ulti
mately change the world. But we
must have faith in these small steps,
these small acts of kindness. Take
the extra breath every morning and
ask for fair trade coffee. Consider
traveling to a developing country
and seeing these realities for your
self. Because our individual shovel
fulls of dirt along the water pipeline
were meaningless in isolation. But
together we created a water-system
in Cerro Bonito. Our small acts of
kindness will add up.

dramatic living conditions of the in
habitants of this community (they
have no electricity, no running
water, most children have no shoes),
but the most memorable part of our
experience was the warmth that the
campesinos shared with us. As we
stepped off the bus, the kids of the
village immediately surrounded us,
drawn by mixed feelings of curiosity
and kindness.
Dona Maria, the "grandmother"
of the community, told us that she felt
our presence came as a blessing to
them. They were moved by the fact
that we, a group of gringos, had trav
eled so far to visit them, learn from
them and help them build two pro
jects that would benefit their commu
nity. Dona Maria's affectionate
words allowed us to see the signifi
cance of our trip: it was more than
building facilities or learning about
their culture; it was about offering
our humanity and compassion for
these people who in return shared

their infinite kindness with us.
Our service project was organized
and funded by Proyecto Aldea Glob
al, a Honduran grassroots organiza
tion, and AJWS, the American Jew
ish World Service. These two organi
zations provide assistance to rural
Honduran villages through small
scale, sustainable projects such as
running health clinics and giving
micro loans to women. Our group
helped build a network of pipelines
to connect the scattered houses
throughout the hillside to a source of
water, and we also assisted in the
construction of an elementary school
for the children of the community.
At times, while we were shovel
ing dirt until our muscles ached,
looking out over the vast country
side, we felt somewhat helpless in
the face of the widespread poverty.
Poverty is not having clean water to
drink and getting sick because of the
unsanitary conditions that are a fact
of life. Poverty is having to travel
three hours on unpaved roads (if
they were lucky enough to borrow a
car and have enough money for gas)
to reach a doctor — something we
observed firsthand one day when a
nine-year old boy from the village
broke his arm.
And this poverty is everywhere.
Eighty percent of Honduras' 6.5 mil
lion people live in poverty, earning
less than one U.S. dollar per day. Hon
duras was hit the hardest by Hurricane
Mitch in 199Kand still has not fully re
covered. The country's vulnerability
to the volatile price fluctuations of ba
nanas and coffee has often lead to
"sweatshops in the fields," where cof
fee farmers receive prices lower than
the costs of production, continuing the
cycle of poverty and debt.
It can be so easy to be numbed by
the sheer enormity of the disparity
of wealth. But coming back to Stan
ford, we feel empowered more than

anything. We know that we must act
on our awareness and spread this
feeling of solidarity.
Our reality is not the reality of most
of the people in the world. Our ac
tions, as individual consumers and as a
country, directly impact the lives of
people thousands of miles away. One
way to help create more sustainable
conditions and improved quality of
life for the coffee farmers of Central
America is to buy fair-trade coffee.
The retail price of fair trade cof
fee reflects the actual cost of produc
ing coffee and not the price estab
lished by the the law of offer and de
mand. This alternative system has
made it possible for many coffee
farmers to have shelter, food and
hope fora brighter future. Make it a
habit to buy Fair Trade coffee dur
ing your morning stop at Peet's.
They'll sell it, you just have to ask for
it. It will inform them that people on
this campus care, which could make
its use more widespread.
In our one week in Honduras, we
knew that our effort wouldn't ulti
mately change the world. But we
must have faith in these small steps,
these small acts of kindness. Take
the extra breath every morning and
ask for fair trade coffee. Consider
traveling to a developing country
and seeing these realities for your
self. Because our individual shovel
fulls of dirt along the water pipeline
were meaningless in isolation. But
together we created a water-system
in Cerro Bonito. Our small acts of
kindness will add up.

Final exams and papers were still
reverberating through our minds as
we headed to San Francisco Airport to
fly to Tegucigalpa. None of us had
ever visited a developing country be
fore, and we quickly recognized the
difference between speaking of the
developing world in a comfortable
classroom at Stanford and actually liv
ing in a poor village in rural Honduras.
Our six-hour bus ride to Cerro
Bonito revealed a montage of poverty:
We rode past dilapidated huts, hous
ing projects that had been hastily built
after the massive destruction caused
by Hurricane Mitch, and sweat shops
where workers are paid the equivalent
of 15 cents for each shirt they make —
shirts that sell for $40 to Abercrombie
shoppers in the U.S.
