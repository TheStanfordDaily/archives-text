# THE
						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Come back next weekend 
### 
As Greek rush is coming
to an end and the weath
er is starting to improve,
this weekend looks like
it should be an all-out Animal
House, "party like it's 1999" kind of
weekend. With the fourth week of
the quarter under our belts, we real
ly only have one week left until mid
terms start to rear their ugly heads,
and so for the sake of the student
body's social health, this weekend
needs to be raging, rowdy and down
right ridonculous.
But thanks to the impeccable tim
ing of the folks down in the admis
sions office, it looks as if we have
been slapped with another dry week
end. Surely this isn't going to stop
upperclassmen from rolling kegs
into their dorm rooms for the sake of
having a "few" people over, but on
the weekend before certain
midterm-induced death, I would like
to party in a little more style.
Unfortunately, casino night in
Branner, the a capella extravaganza
and hoho-palooza are not really my
scene — which makes me wonder if
these sanctioned activities are really
enticing to our prospective freshman.
My best friend swears, that if she
had not been bound to come here
under her early decision contract.

she would have surely changed her
mind after spending her weekend
with a less-than-pleasant RoHo and
a crowd of people who were having
the all-too-famil-

iar Stanford vs.
Harvard debate.
I personally
wasn't commit
ted to Stanford
yet when I was a
pro fro, the nov
elty of having a
makeshift tree as
a mascot and
being congratulat-

Ed on my admission every 10 min
utes really helped seal the deal. Be
sides, halfway though Admit Week
end, my mother had purchased over
$200 worth of goods from the Stan
ford Store, a not-so-subtle hint that
she thought Stanford was really the
way to go.
I guess in that respect 1 didn't
need a toga party or a progressive
(pro fros, ask an upperclassman) to
help me come to the realization that
Stanford was more fun than all of the
Ivies combined. Even the dry party
in Tresidder beat the lame pro fro
party at Brown, and it sure surpassed
my high school dances, not that
that's really saying too much.

In any case, it should be our duty
as current students to inform the pro
fros that there are better things to do
at Stanford once they choose to
come here — like going to elabo
rately themed frat parties, cutting
class to lay out in the sun and getting
refunds on special fees.
Remember that it is not their
fault that Admit Weekend does not
coincide with the debauchery of Ex
otic Erotic or even any Row House's
special dinner, or that the admis
sions office doesn't offer informa
tion sessions on such traditions as
the Band Run, Full Moon on the
Quad and optional IHUM lectures.
And as for any pro fros who may
be reading this, I know that you're
probably wondering why everyone
is a little more tame and a little less
attractive than you were expecting
after hearing so much about Stan
ford's "work hard, play hard" ethic
or seeing our student body listed in
Playboy.
All I can really say to that is that you
should just come back next weekend.
