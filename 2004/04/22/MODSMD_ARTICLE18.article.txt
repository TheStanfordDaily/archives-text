## The 						joy of grade inflation 
### 
Who doesn't like getting
things easy? I'll con
fess: I'm absolutely
addicted to drive
thrus, ordering crap off the Internet
and driving to class. If you create a
service that doesn't require me to
leave my room or car, you might as
well sign me up. I'm pretty sure I'm
not alone here — Las Vegas is our
national monument to people trying
to get rich without getting off their
padded seats.
Higher education isn't exempt
from this phenomenon. Who
wouldn't rather loaf through a class
and get an A- than bust their ass to
earn a B? Maybe I'm just friends
with a bunch of good-for-nothing
layabouts, but I can't imagine the lat
ter offer is going to be overflowing
with takers.
Always eager to please their "cus
tomers," many universities have
been happy to comply. A recent
study at Princeton showed that near
ly half of the grades handed out were
in the A range, while As at Harvard
have just reached an 18-year high.
While I'd love to raise my nose at
these east coast fops — especially
since they both, in what must have
been tremendous bureaucratic over
sights, declined to spend four years
with me — I think it's only fair to
admit that Stanford isn't completely
innocent of these charges either.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not com
plaining. I'll even make a pretty bold

admission: I've never gone to a pro
fessor and insisted that he lower my
grade. Shocking, I know. I have, on
the other hand, asked around before

enrolling to make
sure a class isn't
taught by some
kind of raving lu
natic who thinks a
B-should be aver
age. I don't need
that kind of
drama in my life.
It's pretty ob
vious that it's not

going to be the raucous protests of
students like myself that bring about
any reform here. Suspend my digital
cable service, and I'll go on a month
long hunger strike in the Main Quad.
Make me play a part in the watering
down of undergraduate education,
and I'll smile all the way to an A.
Teachers aren't exactly in the
best position to pounce on this prob
lem either. A single professor taking
a stand against this tide can probably
expect to be rewarded with empty
classrooms and an ASSU
Courseguide page that reads like a
Nuremberg profile.
What can be done? Nancy
Malkiel, dean of Princeton Universi
ty, has recently proposed a new mea
sure that would limit As to 35 per
cent of grades given out by a depart
ment. I guess when you're giving out
As to half of your students that
seems like taking a stand, but it still

places the average student squarely
at a B+. Way to crack down, Ms.
Malkiel.
As is so often the case, the best so
lution would be for everyone to sim
ply put in a bit more effort. Employ
ers shouldn't be evaluating students
solely based on their GPA anyway.
How on earth can anyone compare
an A-minus from Princeton to a B
plus from Rice to a B from MIT? An
I-Banking firm that picks a 3.9 stu
dent who majored in Sleep and
Dreams and EDGE over someone
who double-majored in CS and EE
with a 3.3 is one that I hope doesn't
handle my IPO.
Of course there is some kind of
problem here, but I don't think pro
posals like Ms. Malkiel's are the an
swer, nor do I think the problem is
as large as some would suggest. Ide
ally, prospective employers or grad
uate schools should be able find
better ways of judging among a pool
of diverse candidates than lining up
arbitrary numbers from hundreds
of sources.
On the other hand, I'm sitting in
my room waiting fora pizza, putting
off an essay and planning my next
trip to the horse track — two trifec
tas and I can quit that grader job.
Maybe I'm not the one to cast the
first stone.
