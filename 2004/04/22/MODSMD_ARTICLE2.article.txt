Redford Institute for Transplant Aware
ness (JRI), a nonprofit organization
whose goal is to educate the public about
the need for organ and tissue donation
through film, educational outreach and
the Internet.
Redford described his five-year wait
between being diagnosed with a terminal
liver disease and actually receiving a
transplant and his increasing awareness of

about it."
Redford noted the importance of rais-
