### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Yesterday evening in Annenberg Au
ditorium, students were asked to stop for
a moment and consider what they knew
about organ donation. The presentation,
sponsored by the Organ Donor Education
organization (ODE) brought experts to
campus to inform students of the impor
tance of organ donation.
The first speaker was Dr. Byer Shaw,
Chair of Surgery at the University of Ne
braska. Shaw discussed and praised a
Wisconsin bill passed earlier this year
that allowed families of organ donors to
deduct the medical expenses associated
with the donation from their taxes.
Shaw also introduced the evening's
keynote speaker and former patient,
James Redford. In 1993, Shaw performed
two liver transplants on Redford, the son
of actor Robert Redford. Two years after
his operation. Redford founded the James
Redford Institute for Transplant Aware
ness (JRI), a nonprofit organization
whose goal is to educate the public about
the need for organ and tissue donation
through film, educational outreach and
the Internet.
Redford described his five-year wait
between being diagnosed with a terminal
liver disease and actually receiving a
transplant and his increasing awareness of
how transplantation is often negatively
depicted in the media.
"I wanted to tell the story of transplan
tation as honestly as I could," Redford
said. "If you tell the story from the recipi
ent and donor point of view, some people
may be still uncomfortable, but others
will realize that they've never thought
about it."
Redford noted the importance of rais-

ing the issue of organ donation be
fore a time of crisis. He emphasized
that people should be allowed to
take the time necessary to make a
well-informed decision.
The night ended with a screening
of the 19W film "The Kindness of
Strangers," a documentary pro

duced by Redford and directed by
Maro Chermayoff about organ
transplants from the perspective of
six families on both the giving and
receiving of donations.
The event was primarily spon
sored by the ODE. According to
Afraaz Irani, president and founding
member of the group, ODE was
started just this past academic year in
order to address the national organ
shortage and the long waiting list for
people waiting for organs.
"Despite what some people

may think, we're not here to tell
everyone to give their organs
away," Contreras said. "We hope
that through our efforts we can
make this campus aware of the
choice of organ donation because
many people just don't consider it
an option or the impacts it has on
the lives it saves."
The organization is also playing a
role in the ongoing curriculum mod
ifications at the medical school to in
clude practical training on how doc
tors can broach the subject. ODE

board member Joanna Chan noted
that decisions as important as organ
donation should not occur for the
first time in the emergency room or
intensive care unit.
"Our philosophy is that it is im
portant for future physicians to be
well-informed about the national
organ shortage so that they can be
reservoirs of information for their
patients," Chan said. "They should
be there to dispel myths and to edu
cate patients about their choice so
that it can be an informed one."
