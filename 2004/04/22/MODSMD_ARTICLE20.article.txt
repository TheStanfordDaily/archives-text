Whenever sports mix with the law, chaos
abounds. You saw it with O.J. You saw it
with MikeTyson. You'reseeingit unfold
before your very eyes with Kobe Bryant,
Jayson Williams and Maurice Clarett.
Now, Clarett may not have committed a crime —
oh wait, there was that incident of falsifying police re
ports, but when you're a star collegiate athlete,
what's a little misdemeanor here and there? It really
only matters if the crime affects your eligibility status,
right? Unfortunately for Clarett, he was just stupid
enough to bring his NCAA violations straight to the
police.
For the moment, though, Clarett's dealings with
the law are not of the criminal nature, but instead
stem from his burned bridges at Ohio State, and his
fate rests in the hands of 71-year-old rabid football
fan Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And while Clarett does
have some sort of precedent on his side — a stay that
prevented Spencer Haywood from entering the NBA

straight from high school was over
turned by William O. Douglas in
1971 —the NFL is working night
and day to keep the guy out. And if
the NFL has the power to get ESPN
to cancel "Playmakers," a show
loved by millions, keeping this kid,
who is loved by no one, out of the
league should be a walk in the park.
But anything could still happen.
Old people do strange things.

Clarett may end up in the draft after all, and if he
does, that's when things will get really interesting.
Despite all the early talk of Clarett being black
listed from the draft, NFL teams can't afford to com
pletely ignore talent — which Clarett clearly has, as
evidenced by his 1,341-yard freshman campaign —
so Clarett will be drafted, even if it isn't until the late
second or third round.
According to Mel Kiper Jr., whose word is clearly
gospel when it comes to the NFL Draft, Clarett is
slated to go in the third round to the Oakland
Raiders.
And honestly, what could be better? Well, maybe
if the Raiders wasted their No. 2 overall pick on him,
which would be typical after their Sebastian
Janikowski pick in 2000.
Al Davis, the Raiders and Clarett are a match
made in heaven — or hell, depending on how you
look at it. But either way, it's gonna be great.
Davis is crazy enough to fall in love with a trou
bled youth and designate him as the feature back on
his squad of Hall of Famers who are just about to start
collecting Social Security, while alienating Norv
Turner before he even coaches a game as a Raider
and giving Tyrone Wheatley one more reason to
have a bad attitude.
It's just too bad Romo's not still around. The only
thing missing from Clarett's career — if you can call
one year of injury-ridden college ball a career — is a
BALCO steroid scandal.
Luckily for Clarett, there's still a couple Raiders
left who have the BALCO hookup, and although
he'll miss out on all the patented Romo attitude and
dirty play, he's got the next best thing in Warren
Sapp.
And by signing with Oakland, Clarett's got about
the smallest chance of getting shit from his team
mates every single day of the season. Because those
guys have absolutely no right.
Franchise player Charles Woodson is a whiny,
overrated prima donna. "Star" kicker Janikowski is
an overweight, out-of-control alcoholic. Pro Bowl
center Barret Robbins had a breakdown the night be
fore the Superbowl. And while he may not get much
playing time, on this campus we all know about Teyo
Johnson's rep.
The type of character development Clarett
would get as a member of the Raiders is exactly
what he needs. Not only will an early-entry into
the draft — and Clarett's name being called by the
Raiders — allow Ohio State to actually concen
trate on football next year, instead of the ridicu
lous media circus that will inevitably follow
Clarett's every move, it will also provide the Bay
Area with an infinite amount of entertainment.
And if Ruth Bader Ginsburg doesn't overturn the
appellate court's idiotic decision to bar Clarett from
the NFL, maybe he could transfer to Stanford. He's
good enough so that probably even Buddy Teevens
couldn't keep him from making an impact. At the
very least, people would start going to football
games. I know 1 would.
