## Softball splits with St. Mary's 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 9 Stanford Softball team
(35-12) plays nearly 70 games per
year, including 21 Pacific-10 Con
ference games against many of the
best teams in the country. Last
weekend, the Cardinal faced the
top-ranked team in the nation in
Arizona, and this coming weekend
it must face No. 4 UCLA and No. 6
Washington in away games. In the
midst of all this elite competition,
the Cardinal could be forgiven for
looking past unranked non-confer
ence opponent St. Mary's, possessor
of a woeful 9-36 record this season.
The Cardinal, with ace senior
pitcher Dana "Lightning D"
Sorensen in the circle, dropped a 2-
1 decision to the Gaels in the first
game of a doubleheader Tuesday
night in Moraga, Calif. Although
Stanford came back to post a deci
sive 7-0 victory over the Gaels in the
second game of the doubleheader,
the damage was already done —
and the Cardinal will have a lot to
think about and improve upon be
fore taking on UCLA on Friday.
Nothing seemed particularly
ominous about Tuesday's first
game at St. Mary's. Sorensen. sec
ond in the Pac-10 in strikeouts and
Stanford's career record-holder in
wins and ERA, took a 21-6 record
into the game. Sorensen's counter
part on the Gaels was sophomore
Jennifer Eaton, whose win-loss
record going into Tuesday was an
underwhelming 5-21. The Cardinal
was coming off an emotional week
end against the Arizona schools
that ended on a high note with two
straight victories over No. 27 Ari
zona State to cap off a long homes
tand.
But numbers and statistics
meant nothing in Tuesday's first
game. Twenty-one-game loser
Eaton pitched a gem. allowing only
one run in a complete game win,
and 21-game winner Sorensen is
sued four walks over six innings

while allowing two Gaels runs, both
earned, to take the loss. The vaunt
ed Cardinal offense was almost
silent, with senior catcher Jessica
Allister driving in the team's only
run with a third-inning single. The
Cardinal managed six hits, but five
were singles, and Stanford left
seven runners on base in the loss.
The team was able to put its trou
bles behind it for Tuesday's night
cap as Laura Severson dominated
the Gaels en route to a two-hit
shutout in a 7-0 Cardinal victory.
Severson, who has shown flashes
of brilliance all year long, put to
gether her best performance of the
season thus far, and the Cardinal of
fense responded to her effort. Allis
ter continued her month-long hot
streak with four RBIs and a home
run and sophomore shortstop Lau
ren Lappin drove in three runs with
two doubles in the victory. St.
Mary's pitcher Laura Albaugh took
the loss for the Gaels to drop to 5-12
on the year.
The Cardinal won't have much
time to reflect on Tuesday's split
against St. Mary's, as conference
powers UCLA and Washington
loom. While Tuesday's loss to the
Gaels does not count against Stan
ford's conference record, it raises
important questions for the Cardi
nal coming into a weekend with
such stiff competition. The team
must count on star pitcher Sorensen
to bounce back from her Tuesday
loss and dominate UCLA and
Washington in order to put the team
in a position to win.
Furthermore, Severson showed
again Tuesday that she has the stuff
to be a legitimate staff ace, but she
must maintain this level of excel
lence against some of the best hit
ters around this weekend if the Car
dinal hopes to answer the nagging
questions raised by Tuesday's per
formance. The only satisfying an
swers, of course, will be Cardinal
victories over UCLA and Washing
ton.

fense responded to her effort. Allis
ter continued her month-long hot
streak with four RBIs and a home
run and sophomore shortstop Lau
ren Lappin drove in three runs with
two doubles in the victory. St.
Mary's pitcher Laura Albaugh took
the loss for the Gaels to drop to 5-12
on the year.
The Cardinal won't have much
time to reflect on Tuesday's split
against St. Mary's, as conference
powers UCLA and Washington
loom. While Tuesday's loss to the
Gaels does not count against Stan
ford's conference record, it raises
important questions for the Cardi
nal coming into a weekend with
such stiff competition. The team
must count on star pitcher Sorensen
to bounce back from her Tuesday
loss and dominate UCLA and
Washington in order to put the team
in a position to win.
Furthermore, Severson showed
again Tuesday that she has the stuff
to be a legitimate staff ace, but she
must maintain this level of excel
lence against some of the best hit
ters around this weekend if the Car
dinal hopes to answer the nagging
questions raised by Tuesday's per
formance. The only satisfying an
swers, of course, will be Cardinal
victories over UCLA and Washing
ton.
