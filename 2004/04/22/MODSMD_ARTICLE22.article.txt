# Men's volleyball will wait until next year
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Coming into January of this year. Cardi
nal head coach Don Shaw was realistic about
the potential performance of the Stanford
men's volleyball team.
"My expectations weren't very high, to
tell you the truth."he said.
And with good reason. Stanford (9-18, 6-
16 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) lost
several key players to graduation last year,
including two-time Ail-American Curt Top
pel, who recorded 333 kills in the 2003 sea
son, and Billy Strickland, who played in all
109 games of that season. It was a change in
the roster from which Shaw was not sure the
Cardinal would immediately recover.
"Just looking at the talent level and how
much we lost — we were devastated by
graduation," Shaw said. "That really took a
lot out of the team."
Particularly out of the attack. When those
seniors graduated, over 1,000 kills on the
season graduated with them.
And in the face of this challenge, Stan
ford confronted another — the strength
of its conference. The MPSF boasts his
torical volleyball powerhouses such as
Hawaii and Pepperdine, both teams that
returned harder-hitting, more experi
enced squads to maintain top-five rank

ings throughout the season.
It was due to the skill of Stanford's oppo
nents, not a lack of skill on the Cardinal's
part, that Shaw was apprehensive about the
2004 season.
"I thought the possibility really existed
that we would have a hard time winning any
matches in the conference," he said.
But that possibility never came to be.
The Cardinal surprised everyone by post
ing wins against strong MPSF teams, includ
ing UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Irvine, as well as lower-ranked UC-San
Diego and Southern California.
"We pulled off four wins against teams
that were ranked ahead of us," Shaw said. "1
can't be real disappointed with that kind of
a finish."
Stanford started its season with two con
secutive upsets in matches against UCLA
and UC-Irvine, often championed as the
highlight reel of the season. Stanford defeat
ed then-No. 2 UCLA in a five game match
on Jan. 16 before beating then-No. 9 Irvine
the following night.
"Obviously, we had a great start," said ju
nior setter Kevin Hansen. "It was awesome
opening up the season with two key wins
against UCI and UCLA at home."

The men's volleyball team exceeded expectations, winning six games in the
nation's most dominant conference.
A win over UCLA was particularly
sweet for Shaw, since the Bruins main
tained a high ranking throughout the
regular season, finishing at the No. 3
spot. Its ongoing success suggests that
the Cardinal win was not simply the re
sult of good timing.
"UCLA's been right there at the top
of the pack," he said.
Wins like these might not seem to
match up with the Cardinal's poor sta
tistical record, particularly on the road.
Stanford posted only two wins away
from home this season. Hansen and
Shaw chalk much of it up to a tough
conference, choosing to focus on the
nature of their competitors rather than
the numbers.
"The MPSF is an extremely com
petitive conference and I am pleased
that our guys always played hard no
matter what the scoreboard said,"
Hansen said.
Hansen was the only returning play
er with much in-game experience and
his presence in the setter role was key
to this season's success.
"Hansen is really our leader,"
Shaw said.
Junior middle blocker Craig Buell
also stepped up this season. He and
sophomore Chris Ahlfeldt maintained
the position of middle blocker through
out the season, though neither of them
had much playing experience from the
previous year. It was an accomplish
ment that impressed Shaw.
"What a tremendous job those guys
did, just being able to play every night,"
he said.
Also playing every night in a new
position was junior outside hitter
David Vogel, who played defense last
season before heading up Stanford's
attack this year.
"Vogel had been a libero and he was
going to have to become our number
one outside hitter," Shaw said.
He did just that, leading the team
with 264 kills this season and maintain
ing his defensive skills as well — Vogel
tallied a total of 156 digs.
Stanford was also helped by the con
tributions of sophomore outside hitter
Ben Reddy, junior outside hitter Pat
Bomhack and sophomore libero Jere
my Jacobs. Reddy led the team in kills
per game with 3.05, while Bomhack
came out of the setter position and off
the bench mid-season to post 197 kills.
Jacobs was stellar on defense, record
ing 131 digs on the season.
In fact, no one on the squad got
much of a rest this season. The Cardi
nal team consisted of only 12 members
— just enough for six-on-six scrim
mages at practice and always leaving
the Cardinal with less bodies than the
opposing team.
"I think the lack of depth hurt us,"
Shaw said.
Next year, more recruits will fill
the gaps to allow fora deeper bench,
improved practices and competition
for spots on the traveling team. It's
part of a plan for the 2005 season in
which consistency and hard work will
be emphasized.
"We need a more consistent perfor
mance from everyone so we can count
on how we're going to play." Shaw said.
"That just comes from hard work and
learning from our mistakes and experi
ence — something we didn't have this
year. Hopefully we're going to contin
ue to get stronger, continue to improve,
and bring in some fresh faces."
