# Men's volleyball will wait until next year
## 
### MIA ASHTON STAFF WRITER 
Coming into January of this year. Cardi
nal head coach Don Shaw was realistic about
the potential performance of the Stanford
men's volleyball team.
"My expectations weren't very high, to
tell you the truth."he said.
And with good reason. Stanford (9-18, 6-
16 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) lost
several key players to graduation last year,
including two-time Ail-American Curt Top
pel, who recorded 333 kills in the 2003 sea
son, and Billy Strickland, who played in all
109 games of that season. It was a change in
the roster from which Shaw was not sure the
Cardinal would immediately recover.
"Just looking at the talent level and how
much we lost — we were devastated by
graduation," Shaw said. "That really took a
lot out of the team."
Particularly out of the attack. When those
seniors graduated, over 1,000 kills on the
season graduated with them.
And in the face of this challenge, Stan
ford confronted another — the strength
of its conference. The MPSF boasts his
torical volleyball powerhouses such as
Hawaii and Pepperdine, both teams that
returned harder-hitting, more experi
enced squads to maintain top-five rank

ings throughout the season.
It was due to the skill of Stanford's oppo
nents, not a lack of skill on the Cardinal's
part, that Shaw was apprehensive about the
2004 season.
"I thought the possibility really existed
that we would have a hard time winning any
matches in the conference," he said.
But that possibility never came to be.
The Cardinal surprised everyone by post
ing wins against strong MPSF teams, includ
ing UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara and UC-
Irvine, as well as lower-ranked UC-San
Diego and Southern California.
"We pulled off four wins against teams
that were ranked ahead of us," Shaw said. "1
can't be real disappointed with that kind of
a finish."
Stanford started its season with two con
secutive upsets in matches against UCLA
and UC-Irvine, often championed as the
highlight reel of the season. Stanford defeat
ed then-No. 2 UCLA in a five game match
on Jan. 16 before beating then-No. 9 Irvine
the following night.
"Obviously, we had a great start," said ju
nior setter Kevin Hansen. "It was awesome
opening up the season with two key wins
against UCI and UCLA at home."
