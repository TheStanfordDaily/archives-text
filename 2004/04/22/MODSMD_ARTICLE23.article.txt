### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The regular season may be over, hut
competition is just starting to heat up as
the No. 9 Stanford men's tennis team
heads into the Pacific-10 Championships
beginning today in Ojai, Calif. There will
be both a singles and a doubles bracket,
each consisting of 32 players. The tourna
ment is being held in conjunction with an
invitational tournament.
The eight men's teams in the Pac-10
will vie for the elite singles and doubles
championships, beginning today and con
tinuing through Sunday. Each team will
send four singles players and two doubles
teams, chosen by the coaches.
The tournament is not only presti
gious, it's also of historical significance.
"It's the longest tournament held in
one location ever for tennis," said head
coach Dick Gould. "It was started in the
late 1800 sand they've had it every year

except during times of war."
If all goes well, some Stanford players
may see their names inscribed on the tro
phy, which is on permanent display at
Libbey Park in Ojai.
Four Stanford singles players will be
thrown into the round of 32, where they
will play against other top Pac-10 players.
No. 11 junior Sam Warburg will begin
at the top of the draw against Oregon's
Markus Schiller at 11:00 a.m. this morn

K.C. Corkery will go up against Washing
ton's Christoph Palmanshofer at 9:30 a.m.
No. 107 freshman James Wan will start
play at 12:30 p.m. against No. 56 Alberto
Francis of UCLA, while Stanford team
mate Phil Sheng will meet Cal's No. 70
Balazs Veress at 8:00 a.m. If the players
move on to the second round, they will
play again at either 2:00 p.m. or 3:30 p.m.
In doubles, Corkery and sophomore
James Pade will team up again on Friday
to compete in the round of 16 against

Oregon's No. 40 team of Aaron Spencer
and Sven Swinnen. Stanford's No. 24 duo
of senior team captain Carter Morris and
Warburg will face off against Washing
ton's Alex Slovic and Nicholas Weiss.
Five more Stanford players will com

event. Freshman Chris Rasmussen will
begin play at 11:00 a.m. on Thursday
against Vladmir Pino of Oregon, while se

a bye in the first round. He will play the
winner of the first round match between
Arizona State's Ryan Mc√üride and
Washington's Nick Weiss.
Also in the invitational, senior Joe
Kao will play Cal's Patrick Briaud in one
of the final matches of his Stanford tennis
career. Kao enters the match with a 5-4
record this season. Freshman Eric McK

against Paul Warkentin of Arizona.
Sophomore James Pade will receive a
first-round bye and play the winner of the

In the invitational doubles round, the
