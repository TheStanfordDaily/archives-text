# Track keeps racing to qualify
## 
### EMIL MARTINSEK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend, the Stanford
track and field team traveled
to Los Angeles and set two
school records and posted
dozens of Pacific-10 Confer
ence and NCAA Regional
qualifying marks.
This weekend should be even
better, as Stanford athletes trav
el to three different events
across the nation.
In an attempt to earn qualify
ing marks for the both the Pac
-10 and Regional Champi
onships, some sprinters,
jumpers and throwers will travel
across the bay to Edwards Sta
dium at Berkeley for the Gold
en Bear Qualifier.
Senior Jay Goff, currently
ranked seventh in the West re
gion, will be looking to im
prove on his personal best of
217 feet, 5 inches in the javelin
up at Berkeley, while the
men's pole vaulters will be
looking to post the first Pac-10
qualifying marks in the event
for Stanford since 1999.
Much of the throwing
squad will make the trip to
UC-San Diego to meet
some of the top throwing
competition in the nation,
including throwers from
Auburn, UCLA and South
ern California.
For the third week in a row,
senior Jillian Camarena will
face off against her rival,
UCLA's Jessica Crosby. Ca
marena and Crosby are consid
ered two of the best shot-putters
in the nation. Last week, Crosby
bested Camarena at the shot for
the first time since the 2003 Pac
-10 Championships, in which
Crosby upended the favored
Camarena. Their rivalry at the
Pac-10 and National Champi
onships should be just as intense
this year.
The women's hammer squad
of junior Jessica Pluth, junior
Donielle Colich and sophomore
Sarah Hopping will also be com
peting for the Cardinal in San
Diego. All three are ranked na
tionally, and no team except
hammer-powerhouse Florida
has more throwers ranked in the

top 50 in the event.
"We want to try to get people
qualified for Pac-lOs and Re
gional," said head men's coach
Robert Weir. "If you get them to
good meets, good facilities, that
gives them the best possible
chance for good performances."
But the highlight of the week
end may not be the perfor
mances in California, but the
competition and performances
at the 110 th Penn Relays in
Philadelphia.
The Cardinal has enjoyed
huge success at the Penn Relays
in recent years in both the men's
and women's distance relays,
collecting eight first- or second
place finishes in 2001 and 2002
before skipping the event to
compete at the Drake Relays
last year.
This season, Stanford returns
with one of its best distance
squads in years.
The men are currently en
tered in the distance-medley
relay, the four-mile relay and the
3,200-meter relay. With one of
the most talented middle-dis
tance crews in the nation, the
Cardinal should again be among
the favorites for the win in all
three events.
Headlining the group for the
Cardinal is senior Grant Robi
son, who is making his season
debut in the four-mile relay. Ro
bison is currently the only colle
gian to have hit the 1,500-meter
Olympic A standard and is a fa
vorite to win the Olympic trials
in July.
Robison will be joined by
sophomore Ryan Hall and ju
nior Don Sage, both of whom
also have Olympic aspirations at
1,500.
The fourth leg on the team
could be any of sophomore
Jacob Gomez, senior Andy
Powell or senior Seth Hejny.
The squad may be able to chal
lenge for the collegiate record of
16 minutes, 7.96 seconds held by
Arkansas â€” or even approach
the elusive 16-minute barrier.
Any of these athletes could
also compete in the 3,200 relay
or the distance medley. Juniors
Nick Sebes and Curt Goehring
will also be at Penn to race the
400-meter leg of the distance

medley. 800-meter specialists
freshman Joaquin Chapa,
sophomore Justin Romaniuk
and junior Evan Fox will proba
bly comprise three of the four
legs of the 3,200 relay.
The women will be bringing a
400-meter relay team and a
1,600-meter relay team to Penn.
The 400-relay squad will be
looking fora Regional qualify
ing mark for the first time this
season, while the 1,600-relay
team will look to challenge the
school record of 3:33.89, which
was set earlier this year at the
Texas Relays.
But the distance events may
still be the highlight.
Last year at the Penn Relays,
current freshman Ari Lambie
broke Kim Gallagher's 24-year
old high school mile meet
record, while current freshmen
Amanda and Katy Trotter ran
on the national high school
record-setting distance medley
relay team.
With the addition of these
runners to the lineup and Stan
ford's runner-up finish in the
distance medley relay at the In
door National Championships,
the Cardinal should challenge
schools like Tennessee and
Georgetown for victories in the
6,000-meter relay, where each
woman runs 1,500 meters, and
the distance medley relay.
With junior Sara Bei, senior
Katie Hotchkiss and Stanford's
talented freshman trio, the
squad may threaten both the
school and Penn Relays records.
"The relays really bring the
team together," said head
women's coach Edrick Floreal.
"It's a good way to get us ready
for the championship races.
"We haven't had everyone
healthy yet this year, but now we
have them competing, have
them running. The relays will
just get them all together and
create some unity."
Events at the Penn Relays
will kick off for the Cardinal
today with the women's 6,000-
meter relay and end on Saturday
with the men's 3,200 relay. In be
tween, thousands of athletes will
compete at Franklin Field in
front of over 100,000 spectators.

Members of the track and field team will look to qualify for nationals and maybe even
break a few records at events around the country.
