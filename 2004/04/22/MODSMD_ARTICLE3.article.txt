# Hennessy touts Silicon Valley-Stanford connection

### JOAQUIN HERNANDEZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Speaking last night in Terman Auditori
um, University President John Hennessy
praised the interrelationship between Stan
ford academia and Silicon Valley compa
nies; he also urged contemporary entrepre
neurs to continue embracing new, innova
tive technology.
"It's a very complex and beneficial rela
tionship that cannot be easily duplicated,"
Hennessy said. "It is one that has been de
veloped over a long period of time, and

wasn't planned, but evolved."
A computer entrepreneur himself, Hen
nessy emphasized the important blend of
academic research and entrepreneurial spir
it of those envisioning the creation, develop
ment and expansion of technology within
Silicon Valley.
Although maintaining a forward-moving
perspective, Hennessy continually retraced
the evolution of Silicon Valley and Stan
ford's contributions to the computer revolu
tion. From this historical perspective, how
ever, Hennessy also highlighted important
lessons to be learned from past innovations

so that future entrepreneurs may build from
these experiences.
Hennessy's presentation recounted the
development of microprocessors, the com
pany Cisco, the Internet and online research
engines such as Yahoo. These examples
show that entrepreneurs must embrace new
technology and use it to advance innovative
development, Hennessy said.
When asked about his thoughts on the
future of information technology, Hen
nessy said that the computer industry is
on the brink of important and innovative
discoveries.

"The Internet revolution is only half
done," Hennessy said. "Wireless technology
is going to grow dramatically. We'll have in
creased mobility, and people will be able to
connect with other people anytime and any
where. We're also going to have to rethink
how we make computers and address soft
ware productivity because it takes too long
to write code."
Mingming Mao, a doctoral candidate in
electrical engineering, said that the pre
sentation was effective and well orga
nized, but added that important issues
went unaddressed.

"Hennessy's emphasis on electrical engi
neering and computer science was appropri
ate," Mao said. "But 1 would've liked to have
heard more about the future of Stanford and
Silicon Valley's role in biotechnology."
Steve Compton, a doctoral candidate
in mechanical engineering, praised Hen
nessy's discussion, calling it clear and
comprehensive.
"I was impressed with his knowledge on
the University's relationship with Silicon
Valley," Compton said. "He was also quite
articulate, and I definitely agree with his en
trepreneurial vision."
