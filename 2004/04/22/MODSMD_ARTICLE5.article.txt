# FCC may tap Internet phones
## 
### LISE MARKEN 
A coalition of 13 higher
education and library associ
ations is hoping to prevent
the Federal Communica
tions Commission (FCC)
from requiring wiretap capa
bilities to be installed on In
ternet networks. Three fed
eral agencies have petitioned
the FCC to require Internet
service providers, including
many colleges and universi
ties, to equip their networks
with wiretap capabilities that
allow law enforcement agen
cies to monitor Internet
based phone calling known
as voice-over IP.
The coalition, in com
ments filed with the FCC on
April 12, argued that the
proposed requirements
would "have a negative im
pact on research and educa
tion programs . . . inhibit
innovation, compromise
privacy and be costly at a
time when budgets are al
ready strained to the break
ing point."
Stanford's Chief Infor

mation Officer Chris Hand
ley pointed out that voice
over IP is "the wave of tech
nology that's coming."
Handley — speaking on a
phone that operates over
Stanford's Internet network
— explained that the net
work already supports voice
communication and that
voice-over IP will eventually
supplant phone lines.
"There are several hun
dred [voice-over IP phones]
on campus now and over the
next 12 to 18 months we ex
pect to get 7,000 more,"
Handley said.
The three federal agencies
— the Federal Bureau of In
vestigation, the Department
of Justice and the Drug En
forcement Agency — argued
in a brief submitted to the
FCC that without the regula
tions, "criminals, terrorists
and spies will use these broad
band services while law en
forcement lacks the tools ...
to conduct lawfully autho
rized surveillance."
