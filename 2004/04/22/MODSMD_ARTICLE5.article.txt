# FCC may tap Internet phones
## 
### LISE MARKEN 
A coalition of 13 higher
education and library associ
ations is hoping to prevent
the Federal Communica
tions Commission (FCC)
from requiring wiretap capa
bilities to be installed on In
ternet networks. Three fed
eral agencies have petitioned
the FCC to require Internet
service providers, including
many colleges and universi
ties, to equip their networks
with wiretap capabilities that
allow law enforcement agen
cies to monitor Internet
based phone calling known
as voice-over IP.
The coalition, in com
ments filed with the FCC on
April 12, argued that the
proposed requirements
would "have a negative im
pact on research and educa
tion programs . . . inhibit
innovation, compromise
privacy and be costly at a
time when budgets are al
ready strained to the break
ing point."
Stanford's Chief Infor

mation Officer Chris Hand
ley pointed out that voice
over IP is "the wave of tech
nology that's coming."
Handley — speaking on a
phone that operates over
Stanford's Internet network
— explained that the net
work already supports voice
communication and that
voice-over IP will eventually
supplant phone lines.
"There are several hun
dred [voice-over IP phones]
on campus now and over the
next 12 to 18 months we ex
pect to get 7,000 more,"
Handley said.
The three federal agencies
— the Federal Bureau of In
vestigation, the Department
of Justice and the Drug En
forcement Agency — argued
in a brief submitted to the
FCC that without the regula
tions, "criminals, terrorists
and spies will use these broad
band services while law en
forcement lacks the tools ...
to conduct lawfully autho
rized surveillance."
The dispute centers on the Com
munications Assistance for Law En
forcement Act, adopted in 1994. This
law requires phone companies to en
gineer their networks to facilitate
federal wire-tapping capabilities and
the federal agencies are claiming that
they require the same level of access
to phone conversations that take
place over the Internet. The coalition
of university and library associations,
however, disputes the claim that In
ternet networks should be included
under the law.
Without a clearer sense of what re
quirements the FCC might impose,
Handley was unsure how much
reengineering the network would cost
the University. However, he noted
the potential difficulties of monitor
ing Internet-based communications.
Handley also emphasized Stan
ford's duty to "protect the privacy of
its students, faculty and staff."
Jennifer Granick, executive di
rector of Stanford's Center for In
ternet and Society, also feels that

the issue raises grave concerns
about privacy.
The government's right to access
communication isn't at issue,
Granick pointed out, since federal
law enforcement already has a legal
right to access both phone and Inter
net communication. The question is
whether government can require in
dustry to create "back doors" that
facilitate surveillance.
Such back doors pose threats to
the privacy of users, Granick claims.
"The regulation could address
law-enforcement security concerns
by enabling easy and cheap surveil
lance of Internet communications,"
Granick said. "But the regulation
would aggravate citizens' security
concerns by increasing the risk of
unauthorized and abusive access to
Internet communications."
There is also some question
about the efficacy of back doors. In
their comments to the FCC, the
coalition members claimed that
communication over the Internet
makes increasing use of encryption,
which is "effectively un-tappable."
An unnamed FCC source said
that the committee is not likely to
take action on the issue for at least
two months.
