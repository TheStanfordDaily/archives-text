## Baseball to face Sac State 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
After sweeping California last weekend, the No. 2
Stanford baseball team will get a break from league
play with a home-and-home series against Sacramen
to State followed by a rare extra day of rest.
Stanford (30-5, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference) con
cludes a six-game homestand tonight at Sunken Dia
mond against the Hornets (22-26) before hitting the
road tomorrow fora single game in Sacramento.
The series, scheduled in order to fill the confer
ence bye week that invariably results from playing
nine teams over a 10-week conference schedule, is
two games instead of the usual three due to restric
tions on the amount of regular season games a team
may schedule.
"In some ways it's better," said head coach Mark
Marquess. "Instead of having three games, we get a
little bit of a rest. We'll get Sunday off and then after
that it's five weekends in a row [of three-game Pac
-10 series]."
The Cardinal, which sits atop the Pac-10 standings
by two full games and has won six straight since a loss
at Oregon Sate two weeks ago, has not appeared in
need of an off day. While the squad made coming from
behind to win somewhat of a habit during the first half
of the season, Stanford has been downright dominant
of late. The Cardinal has outscored its opponents 62-
21 and has trailed fora grand total of one inning dur
ing its most recent win streak.
Stanford's bats continue to lead the winning way.
Through Sunday, the Cardinal's 9.0 runs per game
ranked ninth in the nation and the team's .327 batting
average — up to .330 after Tuesday's 10-5 win over
Saint Mary's and anchored by sophomore second
baseman Jed Lowrie's .400 clip — ranked 17th.
In addition to its solid production at the plate, the
team's stellar fielding percentage (.973) — which
Marquess and the Cardinal pitchers continually point
to as a key to their success — ranks 14th in the nation.
Sophomore Mark Romanczuk (7-1,4.16) will take
the mound for Stanford tonight in the series opener.
The sophomore lefty is coming off an outing against
Cal last Friday in which he gave up four runs on five
hits in seven innings of work to pick up his team-lead
ing seventh win of the season.
Three home runs accounted for all four of the runs
Romanczuk surrendered. He also gave up a three-run
blast in his previous start — a no-decision at Oregon
State — after giving up a total of two home runs in his
previous eight starts.

"The good thing about Romanczuk is that he can
have a sub-par performance and still give you a chance
to win," Marquess said. "He's very good at that."
Sacramento State, which buzzes fnto Sunken Dia
mond losers of four straight after falling to Nevada on
Tuesday, 17-4, will counter with lefthander Marshall
Hendon (1-3,9.17).
Sophomore right hander Jeff Gilmore (6-1, 4.57)
gets the nod for the Cardinal tomorrow and will look
to build on his first career complete-game victory
against Cal — Stanford's first of the season.
Gilmore will be opposed by Sacramento State
righthander Ethan Katz(6-4,4.16),wh0 has struck out
68 in 80 innings pitched.
"[Sacramento State has] had some injuries on
their pitching staff but offensively they're good."
Marquess said. "They've got some speed and some
capable pitching, especially when they only have to
play two games."
Senior infielder John Acha leads the Hornets' of
fensive attack with eight home runs, 30 RBls and a
.336 average. Jack Arroyo, one of three Hornets to
start all 48 games this season, has had a solid senior
season for head coach John Smith, batting .332, with
four home runs and 19 RBIs in the leadoff spot.
Arroyo is one of several threats on the basepaths,
having swiped 13 bases in 17 attempts. Junior outfield
er Craig Johnson, one of 11 junior college transfers on
the Sacramento State roster, has been successful on 13
of 14 stolen base attempts this season.
While the Hornets have averaged 5.27 runs per
game this season, the offense has sputtered over the
last seven games, averaging less than three runs per
game during that stretch.
Stanford senior third baseman Jonny Ash, who left
Tuesday's game against Saint Mary's in the fourth in
ning and did not return after taking a pitch off his hand
on a successful bunt attempt, has a fracture in his fin
ger according to Marquess. Ash had the injury to his
glove hand re-examined on Thursday but the team has
not speculated as to how much time he will miss.
"He's been a catalyst for us offensively and has
played great third base," Marquess said. "Hopeful
ly we won't have him out of the lineup very long but
it's nice to have a [Chris] Lewis come in and play
well there."
Lewis, who replaced Ash at third base and home
red and doubled on Tuesday, will likely fill in yet again
this weekend. Lewis' hits were the first of the season
for the sophomore, who was 0-for-16 in limited action
heading into the game.
The first pitch tonight is scheduled for 6 p.m.
