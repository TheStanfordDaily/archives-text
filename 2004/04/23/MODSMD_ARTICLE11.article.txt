## Profrohibition

It's everyone's favorite time on campus: Admit
Weekend! The freshmen feel a sense of responsibil
ity for the first time — they all become RoHos and
HoHos (seriously, who makes up these names?), put
on dorm programming and work hard to sell their school
to a herd of high school seniors running wide-eyed and
bushy-tailed all over campus.
For the rest of Stanford, those living in Row houses,
co-ops and upper class dorms, the profro can seem like
little more than an urban legend. Who are they? Where

did they come from?
What do they do while
they are here? Upper
classmen generally keep
to themselves, and only
see profros when getting a
Jamba Juice and running
errands Friday afternoon
in White Plaza.
But there is one way
in which we are all similar
ly affected by the arrival of
the profros — Admit

Weekend is quite possibly the most boring weekend at
Stanford. Our normally lush campus suddenly becomes
as dry as the Sahara. It's not that Stanford is in any way a
party school, but it's a fact that college students drink on
every campus across America, save Brigham Young (no
relation to Courtney). We're not talking water, we're not
talking orange juice, we're talking beer. Kegs, forties,
thirty-packs. Beirut, shotgunning, beer bongs. Sam
Adams, Heineken, Natty Ice. Dark, light, backwash. It all
happens, and it happens right here just as much as any
where else. At parties, at the Treehouse, in your room by
yourself. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs
day, Friday, Saturday.
Of course, underage drinking is never encouraged,
and the University is right to keep campus parties dry
during Admit Weekend because of legal risks. We sure as
hell don't want to get in trouble because of some naive
seventeen-year-old's inability to hold his liquor. It's just
not appropriate.
But why prohibit legal drinking during Admit Week
end? Last night's Senior Pub Night was canceled and re
placed with a wholesome movie showing at the Aquarius
Theatre. But Pub Night is for those students that are 21
and over anyway, and it takes place off campus, so what's
the big deal? Last week we were bused to San Francisco,
30-plus miles away, to get drunk. We could have done
that again. Were they afraid we were going to hide
profros in our purses? We can barely fit chapstick in our
tiny Louis and Pradas, let alone a high school senior, even
though they do look smaller and smaller every year.
What's the danger in allowing legal drinking on cam
pus? Do we want to lead our prospective freshmen to be
lieve that drinking doesn't exist at Stanford, even when
you're a 33-year-old senior?
It's not that Stanford students can't have fun without
alcohol. The reason that Admit Weekend is typically bor
ing is that the restrictions on alcohol discourage students
from having parties, and alcohol is a central part of social
functions whether you're drinking or not. Being comfort
able with the presence of alcohol as a minor is part of the
college experience, and profros should know that reality.
So for all you ambitious profros out there that are
reading this fine piece of journalism, here's something
you should know: Alcohol consumption exists at Stan
ford. When you arrive on campus in late September,
you're going to have to make your own decisions about
how to deal with it, but it's here whether you like it or not.
What next? Shut down all the bars in Palo Alto dur
ing Admit Weekend? No R-rated movies allowed to be
shown in dorm rooms? No sex on campus because not all
profros are consenting adults? Wouldn t that be a shame.

Looking for some good sober fun this weekend? Well
Caroline will be out of town and Courtney will be at
bars, so talk to someone else. But e-mail us anyway at
cbrigham@stanford.edu and cciccone@stanford.edu.
