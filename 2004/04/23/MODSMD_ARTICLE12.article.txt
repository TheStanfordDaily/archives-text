10:30 p.m. at Ghirardelli Square.
A group of 12 students huddle around
a fountain, elated though exhausted.
They are searching for their next chal
lenge, which could come in any form
and at any moment. Their minds and
bodies have brought them this close to
victory in these final hours. They are
true Stanford students.
Though this description may bring to
mind the annual scavenger hunts of fall
quarter, it refers to a game that will be
taking place next month in the San Fran
cisco Bay Area. Many have not heard of
the Game, a tradition that has not re-

ceived much on-campus publicity lately.
On Stanford Magazine's list of the
"Top 101 Things to Do Before Gradu
ating," the Game enjoyed much more
popularity in the early 19905, when
Games revolved around themes like
"Mission Impossible" and "Alice in
Wonderland." They were created by
students — Game Controls — in their
spare time, according to a slightly
chaotic process. Those Games usually
stretched from 25 to 35 hours; teams of
tireless and competitive Stanford stu
dents each covered around 400 miles
in various vehicles.
Though some dorms still carry out
their own Games, the event has large
ly vanished from the Stanford lexicon.
Similar treasure hunt races currently
thrive throughout the United States.
MIT and Rice both stage large puzzle
oriented scrambles. Other scavenger
hunt type games are popular in Seat
tle, Los Angeles, Arkansas, Michigan
and New York.
Realizing the appeal of such high
paced endeavors, a Bay Area-based

company called Just Passing Through
has resurrected the Game for groups of
people who would like to tackle mental
and physical puzzles for twelve hours in
San Francisco. Just Passing Through
collectively describes these events as
Shinteki, a Japanese word that means
"mental, physical or psychological."
Linda Holman, a representative of
Just Passing Through, witnessed her
first Game as a freshman at Stanford
in 1991.
"Most Games are organized by
alumni nowadays. The ones that are
organized by students tend to be ama
teurish and not so reliable — our
Games have a far higher production

value. Trust me, the challenges have
all been tested; they're solvable and
fair, and we've put a good hint system
in place," Holman said.
Holman is excited because the
first Game derivative, dubbed
"Aquarius," will take place on May 8,
15 and 22. Each team that partici
pates in Aquarius for twelve hours
will be considered successful, al
though the first team to reach the
highest possible score will receive
special consideration.
Shinteki is "more for the recre
ational hiker or walker than for the
marathon runner. You use your car
for the most part; the maximum walk
is half a mile," Holman said.
Still, a day of constant activity will
almost certainly stimulate all the sens
es. Challenges are initially very simple
— they escalate in difficulty as the
hours pass.
If the concept of Aquarius intrigues
you, visit Just Passing Through's Web
site at http://www.shinteki.com. You
can sign up for the game there.
