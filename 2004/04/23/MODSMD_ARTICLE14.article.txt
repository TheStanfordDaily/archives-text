## Allow more campaign e-mails 
### 
Much of the recent ASSU executive
race controversy was caused by peo
ple sending mass e-mails against the
elections campaign rules determined
by the ASSU. These e-mails might have had a
large impact on the race because they spread po
tentially one-sided opinions to large numbers of
people and reminded core supporters who might
otherwise have forgotten to vote.
The main problem is one of incentives. Though
the Campaign Practices Code states that a slate is
responsible for the actions of its supporters —
and the ASSU Undergraduate Senate and Grad
uate Student Council did indeed hold candidates
responsible in this race by refusing to certify the
executive election — il is very difficult to restrain
people from actions that can have such a large
electoral impact.
The solution is to reduce the effect that one
unauthorized e-mail can have on the race, and the
way to do that is to authorize more e-mails. Cam
paign e-mail will probably get annoying, but how
annoying will it actually be? If mass e-mails prove
irritating, this will give campaigns and their sup
porters an incentive to reduce e-mail, making
sure that messages are to the point and useful to

unsubscribe or start ignoring future postings.
Some rules are still appropriate: E-mails to
opt-in lists for student groups should be treated
differently than dorm lists, for example. Harvest
ing of e-mail addresses is a violation of Universi
ty policy and should be dealt with as such. Anony
mous e-mails should not be allowed. If lies are
spread through e-mail, let it be dealt with in the
manner of a Fundamental Standard issue.
Especially in all-electronic elections such as
the ASSU elections, e-mail can be a great tool for
informing the campus of election issues and re
minding students to vote. Right now, restrictions
put a huge premium on e-mail access because
most students get only a few e-mails, and so don't
get both sides of the story. If access were loos
ened, candidates and supporters would have an
incentive to control e-mail use themselves, stu
dents would be more informed and turnout would
go up and a few stray violations of the elections
code would be less likely to have such a strong ef
fect on voting outcomes.
