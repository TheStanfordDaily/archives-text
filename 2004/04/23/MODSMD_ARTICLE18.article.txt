# DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
## Education's future is in reruns 
### 
According to an article in
yesterday's The New York
Times ("As wealthy fill top
colleges, new efforts to
level the Field," April 22), family in
come is the new diversity issue.
There is a shocking trend for elite
universities to promote elitism by
over-representing the nation's upper
crust in its academic halls (gasp).
In the name of liberalism, admis
sions officers are beginning to inno
vate ways to combat this anti-merito
cratic phenomenon. For example,
the University of Michigan has
added questions about household in
come (which prospective students
tend to downplay) to their under
graduate applications. Stanford has
modified its early admission policy to
accommodate lower-income stu
dents who need to compare financial
aid packages.
But some astute individuals have
observed that the problem may not be
the admission process at all. After all,
tuition costs increase at rates faster
than the velocity of Michael Johnson.
Like decrepit senior citizens who
illegally purchase Canadian drugs
from Google advertisers, growing
numbers of poor students opt out of
double decades of debt by lunging
for the bargain prices of generic edu
cation. Yeah, their schools teach the
same stuff, but lack the eight-figure
landscape or prestigious name. Good
for them.
Does it need to be that way? We
spend so much energy romanticizing
higher education that we often fail to
see it for what it is. It's a business, my
friends. A big-buck business.
Good businesses, however, are
designed to be as efficient as possi
ble. This is where college falls short.
For any problem I discuss (e.g.
ResEd and cops), 1 don't just rant —
I offer solutions (e.g. fire ResEd and
run away from cops). When it comes
to the egregious costs of an under
graduate education, I propose that
we lift the mandate of live professors
for college courses.

MathXXX Lecture
AJ jots his thoughts.
"I sit here idly. I am a mere
fledgling, weak and vulnerable in my
circumstance. I gaze longingly at a
sympathetic far wall which mouths to
me the remaining minutes of my
sleepy discomfort. Oh, stoic and
voluptuous clock — your time-indi
cation is like a moist batter of hen
saliva and chewed worm pieces. You
coo me to stillness and nourish my
empty brain like a cellulose sandwich
and a Diet Coke."

In the fall of my freshman year, I
resolved to ignore my Calc professor
and his phony Chinese accent after
the sixth time I asked a peer, "What
the hell did he just say?" The kid did
his best to replicate the sounds, but

neither of us
could extract any
kind of meaning
out of them. That
lecture was utter
ly useless. What
did I do? I did
what each and
every one of you
has done for class
es just like this: I
dove into my
fresh, unmarked

bookstore-bought textbook (I was
young) and worked through the as
signments on my own.
The same went for winter quarter.
My attendance in a sociology class
dropped like a pinch of the Bud mud
after a night of Beirut (or was it Beer
Pong, Mac?). Call me crazy, but fifty
minutes of a blinding white light
from a projector refracting off an old
timer's nude head, well, it didn't par
ticularly tickle my fancy — certainly
not when he adhered to his Web
posted lecture notes like the Holy
Q'uran. So I looked to the Heavens.

AJ writes to God.
"Dear Mr. God,
I'm writing this letter to ask two
questions. First, can I please have a
billion dollars and the ability to grow
out a hobbit-sized Afro? You know
— just in case.
Secondly and furthermore. Your
Highness, what is the necessity of this
silly lecture component for academic
courses? I understand that many ex
periences are better in person —
(for example, Mardi Gras and public
floggings), but why must my educa
tion be a collection of hit-or-miss live
performances? This ain't Second
City, Pops. This is college.
Sincerely,
Albert Earl Magnuson, 111
PS: The Bible says that fondling one
self is a sin. For the love of You, tell
me you were f#s%ing with us."
Our era boasts the kind of tech
nology that lets you remote grocery
shop, walkie-talkie a Chinese pen
pal or stream a clip of your pale
moon to your disagreeable high
school principal. Surely, we can
come up with a way to record lec
tures of commonly taken, unchang

ing courses. Lectures, by definition,
are uni-directional communication
— and they seem to stick to that dy
namic for the most part. So why
bother teaching the same thing
more than once? Why bother being
there in person?
Sept. 29,2001
Intro Lecture
AJ scribbles some haikus on a
shoe he mistakes for his own.
It is nine a.m.
Why am I awake right now?
I should slap someone.
I'm here in person.
They invented video.
Suffrin' Succotash.
Wait. This ain't my shoe.
Should I finish the poem?
Absolutely. Balls.
The CS and engineering depart
ments are getting the picture. They
televise courses on Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network and post
lectures on the Internet. It works.
They are the most learnable courses
that Stanford has to offer.

AJ shouts from balcony.
"Hark! Why dost thou meander to
the Quad? 1 am here aloft, in my bed
room, dressed in skivvies, viewing my
classroom on the tel-e-vision. Verily!
Dost thou yearn the scent of higher
caliber flesh? Dost thou desire 90
minutes of muffled farts? Fools!"
But, professors teach the same lec
tures once a year — sometimes more.
In my vision, the future of education
(for subjects that can handle it) in
volves pre-recorded lectures (updat
ed as needed), live workshops, well
designed assignments/exams, pro
fessional office hours and e-mail or
interactive support available for the
better part of the day.
For University credit, students
must foot mere logistical costs and
pay fair royalties to the stars of the
lecture reruns. Without the gratu
itous live performances, maybe we
can reduce a quarter's worth of class
to less than the cost of a down pay
ment on a vacht.

"Dear Mr. God,
I'm writing this letter to ask two

Secondly and furthermore. Your
Highness, what is the necessity of this
silly lecture component for academic
courses? I understand that many ex

(for example, Mardi Gras and public

Our era boasts the kind of tech

come up with a way to record lec
tures of commonly taken, unchang

ing courses. Lectures, by definition,
are uni-directional communication
— and they seem to stick to that dy

bother teaching the same thing

Intro Lecture
AJ scribbles some haikus on a
shoe he mistakes for his own.
It is nine a.m.
Why am I awake right now?
I should slap someone.
I'm here in person.
They invented video.
Suffrin' Succotash.
Wait. This ain't my shoe.
Should I finish the poem?
Absolutely. Balls.
The CS and engineering depart
ments are getting the picture. They
televise courses on Stanford Instruc
tional Television Network and post
lectures on the Internet. It works.
They are the most learnable courses
that Stanford has to offer.

"Hark! Why dost thou meander to

Dost thou yearn the scent of higher

minutes of muffled farts? Fools!"
But, professors teach the same lec

In my vision, the future of education
(for subjects that can handle it) in
volves pre-recorded lectures (updat

designed assignments/exams, pro
fessional office hours and e-mail or
interactive support available for the
better part of the day.
For University credit, students
must foot mere logistical costs and
pay fair royalties to the stars of the
lecture reruns. Without the gratu
itous live performances, maybe we
can reduce a quarter's worth of class
to less than the cost of a down pay
ment on a vacht.

According to an article in
yesterday's The New York
Times ("As wealthy fill top
colleges, new efforts to
level the Field," April 22), family in
come is the new diversity issue.
There is a shocking trend for elite
universities to promote elitism by
over-representing the nation's upper
crust in its academic halls (gasp).
In the name of liberalism, admis
sions officers are beginning to inno
vate ways to combat this anti-merito
cratic phenomenon. For example,
the University of Michigan has
added questions about household in
come (which prospective students
tend to downplay) to their under
graduate applications. Stanford has
modified its early admission policy to
accommodate lower-income stu
dents who need to compare financial
aid packages.
But some astute individuals have
observed that the problem may not be
the admission process at all. After all,
tuition costs increase at rates faster
than the velocity of Michael Johnson.
Like decrepit senior citizens who
illegally purchase Canadian drugs
from Google advertisers, growing
numbers of poor students opt out of
double decades of debt by lunging
for the bargain prices of generic edu
cation. Yeah, their schools teach the
same stuff, but lack the eight-figure
landscape or prestigious name. Good
for them.
Does it need to be that way? We
spend so much energy romanticizing
higher education that we often fail to
see it for what it is. It's a business, my
friends. A big-buck business.
Good businesses, however, are
designed to be as efficient as possi
ble. This is where college falls short.
For any problem I discuss (e.g.
ResEd and cops), 1 don't just rant —
I offer solutions (e.g. fire ResEd and
run away from cops). When it comes
to the egregious costs of an under
graduate education, I propose that
we lift the mandate of live professors
for college courses.

MathXXX Lecture
AJ jots his thoughts.
"I sit here idly. I am a mere
fledgling, weak and vulnerable in my
circumstance. I gaze longingly at a
sympathetic far wall which mouths to
me the remaining minutes of my
sleepy discomfort. Oh, stoic and
voluptuous clock — your time-indi
cation is like a moist batter of hen
saliva and chewed worm pieces. You
coo me to stillness and nourish my
empty brain like a cellulose sandwich
and a Diet Coke."

In the fall of my freshman year, I
resolved to ignore my Calc professor
and his phony Chinese accent after
the sixth time I asked a peer, "What
the hell did he just say?" The kid did
his best to replicate the sounds, but

neither of us
could extract any
kind of meaning
out of them. That
lecture was utter
ly useless. What
did I do? I did
what each and
every one of you
has done for class
es just like this: I
dove into my
fresh, unmarked

bookstore-bought textbook (I was
young) and worked through the as
signments on my own.
The same went for winter quarter.
My attendance in a sociology class
dropped like a pinch of the Bud mud
after a night of Beirut (or was it Beer
Pong, Mac?). Call me crazy, but fifty
minutes of a blinding white light
from a projector refracting off an old
timer's nude head, well, it didn't par
ticularly tickle my fancy — certainly
not when he adhered to his Web
posted lecture notes like the Holy
Q'uran. So I looked to the Heavens.
