# THE 						WORLD ACCORDING TO DAN
## God save the Queen, and Tony too 
### 
What do you look for in a
leader? The other day I
found myself discussing
this very matter with the
politically savvy coaches of the Stan
ford Rugby Team. Some, myself in
cluded, saw intelligence as the domi
nant factor swaying our vote one way
or the other. Coach Holder claimed
character as the paramount trait he
looked for. Surprisingly, all could
agree that blatant honesty, while ad
mirable, was less important and occa
sionally inappropriate in these times
of uncertain security. The question
currently has a particular relevance as
controversy surrounds the recently
non-certified ASSU elections.
For another perspective, we could
import an interesting test case from
the United Kingdom. Prime Minister
Tony Blair recently bowed to opposi
tion pressure by agreeing that once a
European constitution is finally
signed, the public will exercise the
final word through a referendum. The
decision represents a departure from
his earlier position simply to adopt the
constitution if ratified by the Euro
pean member states. The issue is all
the more pertinent these days, as a
new administration in Spain and soft
ened positions in Poland and Ger
many make the acceptance of the con
stitution a near-sure thing.
Blair is an avid supporter of British
participation and leadership in the
European Union. Yet, he finds him
self surrounded by a nation of nonbe
lievers who chose in 1997 to opt out of
the common European currency (the
Euro) and who, according to this
week's polls, would resoundingly vote
against the European constitution. In

the face of this overwhelming adversi
ty, Blair has turned into the fire and
invited the debate. Chalk one up in
the character category.
While the intelligence of such a
move may seem dubious, it is his un-

questioned intelli
gence on which
Blair is counting
to win this fight.
Thinking back to
the side-by-side
press conferences
held with Presi
dent George W.
Bush, the two ap
peared to repre
sent night and day.

Bush's character-filled promises to
"smoke 'em out of their fox holes"
contrasted wildly with the articulate
explanations of the former Rhodes
scholar, who shifted with ease from
Middle East history to plans for its
democratic future.
But "ease" is hardly the word for
Blair's next task. Armed with their is
land-philosophy, average Britons and
the popular press automatically re
spond "no" to more Europe, whatev
er the form. Blair realizes that to win a
referendum, he must expand the dia
logue beyond the constitution itself.
As such, he stressed to the British
public that "the question will be on
the [constitutional] treaty, but the im
plications go far wider." The strategy
is smart, but will he have the character
to convince his skeptical electorate?
Doubters aside, both the United
States and Europe need Blair to suc
ceed. While on one hand he vigilantly
protects the British connection to Eu
rope, his transatlantic credentials are

unquestioned. His cabinet nearly dis
banded over his loyalty to Bush and
his policy on Iraq. His unique ability
to appeal both to Europe and the
United States and, above all, to
weather the storm, distinguishes Blair
in the world.
So what makes him an admirable
leader, his intelligence or his charac
ter? Clearly, the answer demands a
synergy of both. Blair seems to pos
sess what the intelligent without char
acter and the characters without intel
ligence don't: Integrity. Political in
tegrity expands upon the dictionary
definition of "wholeness." It includes
the ability to recognize the implica
tions of your policies, the foresight to
put them into practice and the appeal
to get others to accept it all.
With that in mind, we look to the
second round of executive elections at
Stanford. Integrity seems an appro
priate criterion. Faced with the
newest hybrid slate of Lee-Schwartz,
one cannot forget the actions of their
"political ancestry." While both can
didates proved their disinterest in the
ASSU's student-created campaign
guidelines by breaking them, they
added insult to injury by ridiculously
promising that they would never put
the accomplishment of ASSU execu
tive on their resumes if elected.
Perhaps honesty should have been
higher on our list of desirable candi
date qualities, and perhaps integrity is
best found in those that can laugh at
themselves: Vote Henick-Stockman.

What do you look for in a
leader? The other day I
found myself discussing
this very matter with the
politically savvy coaches of the Stan
ford Rugby Team. Some, myself in
cluded, saw intelligence as the domi
nant factor swaying our vote one way
or the other. Coach Holder claimed
character as the paramount trait he
looked for. Surprisingly, all could
agree that blatant honesty, while ad
mirable, was less important and occa
sionally inappropriate in these times
of uncertain security. The question
currently has a particular relevance as
controversy surrounds the recently
non-certified ASSU elections.
For another perspective, we could
import an interesting test case from
the United Kingdom. Prime Minister
Tony Blair recently bowed to opposi
tion pressure by agreeing that once a
European constitution is finally
signed, the public will exercise the
final word through a referendum. The
decision represents a departure from
his earlier position simply to adopt the
constitution if ratified by the Euro
pean member states. The issue is all
the more pertinent these days, as a
new administration in Spain and soft
ened positions in Poland and Ger
many make the acceptance of the con
stitution a near-sure thing.
Blair is an avid supporter of British
participation and leadership in the
European Union. Yet, he finds him
self surrounded by a nation of nonbe
lievers who chose in 1997 to opt out of
the common European currency (the
Euro) and who, according to this
week's polls, would resoundingly vote
against the European constitution. In

the face of this overwhelming adversi
ty, Blair has turned into the fire and
invited the debate. Chalk one up in
the character category.
While the intelligence of such a
move may seem dubious, it is his un-

questioned intelli
gence on which
Blair is counting
to win this fight.
Thinking back to
the side-by-side
press conferences
held with Presi
dent George W.
Bush, the two ap
peared to repre
sent night and day.

Bush's character-filled promises to
"smoke 'em out of their fox holes"
contrasted wildly with the articulate
explanations of the former Rhodes
scholar, who shifted with ease from
Middle East history to plans for its
democratic future.
But "ease" is hardly the word for
Blair's next task. Armed with their is
land-philosophy, average Britons and
the popular press automatically re
spond "no" to more Europe, whatev
er the form. Blair realizes that to win a
referendum, he must expand the dia
logue beyond the constitution itself.
As such, he stressed to the British
public that "the question will be on
the [constitutional] treaty, but the im
plications go far wider." The strategy
is smart, but will he have the character
to convince his skeptical electorate?
Doubters aside, both the United
States and Europe need Blair to suc
ceed. While on one hand he vigilantly
protects the British connection to Eu
rope, his transatlantic credentials are

unquestioned. His cabinet nearly dis
banded over his loyalty to Bush and
his policy on Iraq. His unique ability
to appeal both to Europe and the
United States and, above all, to
weather the storm, distinguishes Blair
in the world.
So what makes him an admirable
leader, his intelligence or his charac
ter? Clearly, the answer demands a
synergy of both. Blair seems to pos
sess what the intelligent without char
acter and the characters without intel
ligence don't: Integrity. Political in
tegrity expands upon the dictionary
definition of "wholeness." It includes
the ability to recognize the implica
tions of your policies, the foresight to
put them into practice and the appeal
to get others to accept it all.
With that in mind, we look to the
second round of executive elections at
Stanford. Integrity seems an appro
priate criterion. Faced with the
newest hybrid slate of Lee-Schwartz,
one cannot forget the actions of their
"political ancestry." While both can
didates proved their disinterest in the
ASSU's student-created campaign
guidelines by breaking them, they
added insult to injury by ridiculously
promising that they would never put
the accomplishment of ASSU execu
tive on their resumes if elected.
Perhaps honesty should have been
higher on our list of desirable candi
date qualities, and perhaps integrity is
best found in those that can laugh at
themselves: Vote Henick-Stockman.
