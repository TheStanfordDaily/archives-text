# Softball travels to UCLA and UW
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford softball team (35-12,5-4 Pa
cific-10 Conference) takes its show on the road this
weekend for tough conference matchups against
No. 4 UCLA (29-6, 2-5) in Inglewood today and
No. 6 Washington (30-8, 6-1) in Seattle tomorrow
and Sunday.
The Cardinal is coming off a low point in its sea
son, as it split a doubleheader against St. Mary's —
the worst team on its schedule this season — on
Tuesday. Although Stanford shut out the Gaels 7-0
in the nightcap, the first-game loss (2-1) was a diffi
cult one to stomach fora top-10 team trying to
focus on competing in the best softball conference
in the nation.
However, this weekend's away games might
help to restore the Cardinal's spirits simply by
virtue of being on the road. Stanford head coach
John Rittman said on Sunday that the team was
looking forward to its first road trip of the confer
ence season.
"It's been a while [since we've been on the
road]," Rittman said. "I think it's a refreshing
change for the players. On the road, there's fewer
distractions than at home."
Senior catcher Jessica Allister echoed her
coach's sentiments.
"Going on the road is fun," Allister said. "We
get to stay in a hotel and relax. It's nice because the
whole trip is just softball. It's a big weekend for us."
It is indeed a big weekend for the Cardinal,
which has been plagued by inconsistency of late.
Despite splitting a pair with California in
Berkeley two weeks ago, the Cardinal seemed to
fold in the teams' third game and was crushed 7-
0 by the Bears in the weekend's rubber game.

Last weekend, the Cardinal was demolished by
top-ranked Arizona but then bounced back with
two wins against a tough Arizona State squad.
Then came Tuesday's St. Mary's debacle.
So, which team will show up this weekend
against two top-10 conference rivals: The Cardinal
squad that handed Cal its first home loss of the sea
son two weeks ago or the team that lost to a 10-37
St. Mary's team earlier this week?
The key this weekend will probably be the per
formance of senior Dana "Lightning D" Sorensen,
who got touched up by St. Mary's in Tuesday's loss
but has been relatively unflappable all season.
Being on the road should help her spirits.
"I'm excited about going on the road," Sorensen
said. "We always draw good crowds down in SoCal
at UCLA, since there's a lot of Stanford alumni
down there. Plus there's the warm L.A. weather.
Washington is a little bit colder, but it has a really
nice ballpark, which is fun to play in. Competition
wise, this is one of our toughest weekends of the
season, though."
Sorensen is right about the quality of competi
tion the Cardinal will be facing in No. 4 UCLA and
No. 6 Washington.
The Bruins are led by sophomore outfielder and
reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week Caitlin Benyi,
who batted .600 last week and leads the Bruins with
15 home runs and 25 RBIs.
The UCLA roster features two excellent start
ing pitchers in 17-game winner Keira Goerdl (17-4,
1.38 ERA) and Lisa Dodd (11-2,0.78). The Bruins
hold an overwhelming lead in the all-time series
versus the Cardinal, having won 27 of the 33
matchups between the two schools, including all of
last year's contests.
The Huskies, despite their lower ranking, might
be even better than the Bruins, as they bring a 6-1

conference record into this weekend's play.
Washington is led by junior catcher Kristen
Rivera, an All-American who leads the Huskies in
batting average (.430), home runs (14) and RBIs
(41). The Husky pitching staff is led by 20-game
winner Ashley Boek (20-5,1.54 ERA).
The Cardinal lags behind the Huskies in the all
time series, holding only a 9-24 record despite win
ning two of three against Washington last year.
The Cardinal will look to its starting pitching to
shut down the potent Bruin and Husky lineups, but
it remains to be seen whether Sorensen and sopho
more Laura Severson will be up to the task.
Both have shown flashes of brilliance this sea
son, with Sorensen pitching especially well before
suffering two tough losses last week.
Severson has come on strong lately, includ
ing pitching a two-hit shutout against St.
Mary's on Tuesday. If both Sorensen and Sev
erson can get on track at the same time, the
Cardinal has as good a pitching staff as any
team around.
As far as hitting goes, the Cardinal has seen
consistent production from the top of its order
— sophomores Lauren Lappin and Catalina
Morris and senior Jessica Allister — but it is the
bottom of the order that must get hot in order
for the Cardinal offense to really get into gear.
When one of the Cardinal's other position play
ers has gotten hot — Leah Nelson and Meghan
Sickler are recent examples — the Cardinal has
defeated elite competition. But when the bot
tom of the lineup fails to hit, the Cardinal can
run into trouble, as the team witnessed Tuesday
against St. Mary's.
It's a good thing the softball team likes going on
the road, because the outcome of the Cardinal's
Pac-10 season could hinge upon this weekend.

ing pitchers in 17-game winner Keira Goerdl (17-4,
1.38 ERA) and Lisa Dodd (11-2,0.78). The Bruins
hold an overwhelming lead in the all-time series
versus the Cardinal, having won 27 of the 33
matchups between the two schools, including all of
last year's contests.
The Huskies, despite their lower ranking, might
be even better than the Bruins, as they bring a 6-1

conference record into this weekend's play.
Washington is led by junior catcher Kristen
Rivera, an All-American who leads the Huskies in
batting average (.430), home runs (14) and RBIs
(41). The Husky pitching staff is led by 20-game
winner Ashley Boek (20-5,1.54 ERA).
The Cardinal lags behind the Huskies in the all
time series, holding only a 9-24 record despite win
ning two of three against Washington last year.
The Cardinal will look to its starting pitching to
shut down the potent Bruin and Husky lineups, but
it remains to be seen whether Sorensen and sopho
more Laura Severson will be up to the task.
Both have shown flashes of brilliance this sea
son, with Sorensen pitching especially well before
suffering two tough losses last week.
Severson has come on strong lately, includ
ing pitching a two-hit shutout against St.
Mary's on Tuesday. If both Sorensen and Sev
erson can get on track at the same time, the
Cardinal has as good a pitching staff as any
team around.
As far as hitting goes, the Cardinal has seen
consistent production from the top of its order
— sophomores Lauren Lappin and Catalina
Morris and senior Jessica Allister — but it is the
bottom of the order that must get hot in order
for the Cardinal offense to really get into gear.
When one of the Cardinal's other position play
ers has gotten hot — Leah Nelson and Meghan
Sickler are recent examples — the Cardinal has
defeated elite competition. But when the bot
tom of the lineup fails to hit, the Cardinal can
run into trouble, as the team witnessed Tuesday
against St. Mary's.
It's a good thing the softball team likes going on
the road, because the outcome of the Cardinal's
Pac-10 season could hinge upon this weekend.

Stanford will be leaning on senior hurler Dana Sorensen to put in a
solid performance in the circle in this weekend's Pac-10 contests.
The No. 8 Stanford softball team (35-12,5-4 Pa
cific-10 Conference) takes its show on the road this
weekend for tough conference matchups against
No. 4 UCLA (29-6, 2-5) in Inglewood today and
No. 6 Washington (30-8, 6-1) in Seattle tomorrow
and Sunday.
The Cardinal is coming off a low point in its sea
son, as it split a doubleheader against St. Mary's —
the worst team on its schedule this season — on
Tuesday. Although Stanford shut out the Gaels 7-0
in the nightcap, the first-game loss (2-1) was a diffi
cult one to stomach fora top-10 team trying to
focus on competing in the best softball conference
in the nation.
However, this weekend's away games might
help to restore the Cardinal's spirits simply by
virtue of being on the road. Stanford head coach
John Rittman said on Sunday that the team was
looking forward to its first road trip of the confer
ence season.
"It's been a while [since we've been on the
road]," Rittman said. "I think it's a refreshing
change for the players. On the road, there's fewer
distractions than at home."
Senior catcher Jessica Allister echoed her
coach's sentiments.
"Going on the road is fun," Allister said. "We
get to stay in a hotel and relax. It's nice because the
whole trip is just softball. It's a big weekend for us."
It is indeed a big weekend for the Cardinal,
which has been plagued by inconsistency of late.
Despite splitting a pair with California in
Berkeley two weeks ago, the Cardinal seemed to
fold in the teams' third game and was crushed 7-
0 by the Bears in the weekend's rubber game.

Last weekend, the Cardinal was demolished by
top-ranked Arizona but then bounced back with
two wins against a tough Arizona State squad.
Then came Tuesday's St. Mary's debacle.
So, which team will show up this weekend
against two top-10 conference rivals: The Cardinal
squad that handed Cal its first home loss of the sea
son two weeks ago or the team that lost to a 10-37
St. Mary's team earlier this week?
The key this weekend will probably be the per
formance of senior Dana "Lightning D" Sorensen,
who got touched up by St. Mary's in Tuesday's loss
but has been relatively unflappable all season.
Being on the road should help her spirits.
"I'm excited about going on the road," Sorensen
said. "We always draw good crowds down in SoCal
at UCLA, since there's a lot of Stanford alumni
down there. Plus there's the warm L.A. weather.
Washington is a little bit colder, but it has a really
nice ballpark, which is fun to play in. Competition
wise, this is one of our toughest weekends of the
season, though."
Sorensen is right about the quality of competi
tion the Cardinal will be facing in No. 4 UCLA and
No. 6 Washington.
The Bruins are led by sophomore outfielder and
reigning Pac-10 Player of the Week Caitlin Benyi,
who batted .600 last week and leads the Bruins with
15 home runs and 25 RBIs.
The UCLA roster features two excellent start
ing pitchers in 17-game winner Keira Goerdl (17-4,
1.38 ERA) and Lisa Dodd (11-2,0.78). The Bruins
hold an overwhelming lead in the all-time series
