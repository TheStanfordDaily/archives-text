## Turkey should own up to responsibility for Armenian genocide 
### SEEPAN PARSEGHIAN 
Adolf Hitler said it all those years ago. The
National Socialist Party was planning one of the
most horrific events of the 20th century, and
Hitler only looked back once. That moment
came when one of Hitler's generals asked if he
was afraid they would be punished for what they
were about to execute. He casually shrugged oft
the concern, asking in return: "Who today re
members the annihilation of the Armenians?"
The Jewish Holocaust ensued.
On Monday, Holocaust survivor Gloria
Lyon spoke on campus as part of Holocaust
Memorial Day. Listening to Lyon share her
painful experiences, I realized that she was not
only a symbol of enduring strength and sur
vival, but was also a product of a grossly over
looked historical event: the Armenian geno
cide of 1915.
Eighty-nine years ago, the Young Turk
party that was ruling the Ottoman Empire or
chestrated the first genocide of the 20th centu
ry. The Allied powers were preoccupied with
the supposed "war to end all wars." The Young
Turk party had ousted the last royal sovereign
of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Abdul Hamid
11. from leadership and had risen to power on a

democratic platform. After their victory, the
Young Turks decided to adopt nationalistic
ideals, presenting the idea of pan-Turkism to
the Turkish citizenry.
The Armenians, already segregated from
the Turkish population in millets (religious
communities), were an obstacle to the forma
tion of a pan-Turkish nation. They became the
victims of severe oppression and bigotry, ac
cording to American officials who were present
in Turkey at the time. Without a democracy pro
tecting them, the Armenians were left defense
less under the dictatorial swords of leaders who
wanted to rid the empire of them. Behind the
smokescreen of World War I, the Young Turk
leaders Talaat, Enver and Cemal Pasha saw an
opportunity to do so, and so carried out the ex
termination of 1.5 million Armenians under the
cloak of deportation.
There to witness the Armenian genocide un
folding were U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire Henry Morgenthau and U.S. Consul in
Harput, Turkey, Leslie Davis. Both Morgen
thau, a graduate of Columbia Law School, and
Leslie Davis, a famous American humanitarian,
observed firsthand the systematic murder of the
Armenian race in 1915.
In his memoirs that were later published as

"Ambassador Morgenthau's Story," Morgen
thau noted, "When the Turkish authorities gave
the orders for these deportations, they were
merely giving the death warrant to a whole race;
they understood this well, and, in their conver
sations with me, they made no particular at
tempt to conceal the fact." In"The Slaughter
house Province," Davis reported the disappear
ance of the prominent figures of the Armenian
community in Harput on June 23,1915. After
prodding Turkish soldiers with inquiries of the
whereabouts of these Armenian leaders, Davis
was told that they had been rounded up and
taken to a desolate location to be "done away
with." Left without leadership and manpower,
the Armenian elders, women and children of
Harput were deported three days later to the
Syrian Desert, where they were tortured. Davis'
description of these tortures is too graphic to be
included in this op-ed.
The Turkish government denies that the Ar
menian genocide ever occurred. Not only does
it deny the historical facts surrounding this sys
tematic massacre, but it has also taken extensive
steps to manipulate those facts into historical
fallacies. Discrediting the personal memoirs of
educated American foreign servicemen like
Morgenthau and Davis has been a financially

and politically strenuous task for the Turkish
government to accomplish. It has provided mil
lions of dollars to American scholars like Prince
ton Prof. Bernard Lewis, University of
Louisville Prof. Justin McCarthy and UCLA
Prof. Heath Lowry, who discredit scholarship of
the Armenian genocide.
Further, Turkey has extensively lobbied in
Washington to suppress American recognition
of the genocide. As The Washington Post report
ed in Oct. 2000, for example, when House Reso
lution 5% — a bill seeking American recognition
of the Armenian genocide — was on the Con
gressional floor, the Turkish government imme
diately threatened to pull out of a $4.5 billion deal
in which it would purchase 145 advanced Bell-
Textron attack helicopters from the United
States. House Res. 5% failed.
Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert told
The Washington Post that the resolution
"would have enjoyed support among the major
ity of the house." The U.S. government has yet
to officially recognize the Armenian genocide.
The gunsmoke of World War I hid the genocide
of the Armenians from the world, and today a
thick cloud of political and social malpractice by
the Turkish regime has reached the same effect.
The government of Turkey must take re

sponsibility for its 1915 crimes against humanity,
not only for humanity's sake, but for its own fu
ture as well. As Turkish historian Taner Akcam,
now at the University of Minnesota, states, "If
and when the government of Turkey acknowl
edges its past wrongs and recognizes the Arme
nian genocide, it well then be able to ensure a
democratic future."
Had the Turkish regime done so in 1915 and
paid the according price in reparations and com
pensation, Hitler would have taken the annihi
lation of the Armenians into account, and
would have been forced to at least reconsider
carrying out his Final Solution. Lyon could pos
sibly have spoken not of Auschwitz and Bergen-
Belsen on Monday, but of the prosperity of the
European Jews during the World War II era.
Tomorrow, on the 89th anniversary of the
Armenian genocide, it is time for Turkey to rec
ognize the wrongs of carrying out the Armenian
genocide, in order to restore the progression of
its own societal development. This will convinc
ingly allow Turkey to encourage the advance
ment of human culture and morality.

"Ambassador Morgenthau's Story," Morgen
thau noted, "When the Turkish authorities gave
the orders for these deportations, they were
merely giving the death warrant to a whole race;
they understood this well, and, in their conver
sations with me, they made no particular at
tempt to conceal the fact." In"The Slaughter
house Province," Davis reported the disappear
ance of the prominent figures of the Armenian
community in Harput on June 23,1915. After
prodding Turkish soldiers with inquiries of the
whereabouts of these Armenian leaders, Davis
was told that they had been rounded up and
taken to a desolate location to be "done away
with." Left without leadership and manpower,
the Armenian elders, women and children of
Harput were deported three days later to the
Syrian Desert, where they were tortured. Davis'
description of these tortures is too graphic to be
included in this op-ed.
The Turkish government denies that the Ar
menian genocide ever occurred. Not only does
it deny the historical facts surrounding this sys
tematic massacre, but it has also taken extensive
steps to manipulate those facts into historical
fallacies. Discrediting the personal memoirs of
educated American foreign servicemen like
Morgenthau and Davis has been a financially

and politically strenuous task for the Turkish
government to accomplish. It has provided mil
lions of dollars to American scholars like Prince
ton Prof. Bernard Lewis, University of
Louisville Prof. Justin McCarthy and UCLA
Prof. Heath Lowry, who discredit scholarship of
the Armenian genocide.
Further, Turkey has extensively lobbied in
Washington to suppress American recognition
of the genocide. As The Washington Post report
ed in Oct. 2000, for example, when House Reso
lution 5% — a bill seeking American recognition
of the Armenian genocide — was on the Con
gressional floor, the Turkish government imme
diately threatened to pull out of a $4.5 billion deal
in which it would purchase 145 advanced Bell-
Textron attack helicopters from the United
States. House Res. 5% failed.
Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert told
The Washington Post that the resolution
"would have enjoyed support among the major
ity of the house." The U.S. government has yet
to officially recognize the Armenian genocide.
The gunsmoke of World War I hid the genocide
of the Armenians from the world, and today a
thick cloud of political and social malpractice by
the Turkish regime has reached the same effect.
The government of Turkey must take re

sponsibility for its 1915 crimes against humanity,
not only for humanity's sake, but for its own fu
ture as well. As Turkish historian Taner Akcam,
now at the University of Minnesota, states, "If
and when the government of Turkey acknowl
edges its past wrongs and recognizes the Arme
nian genocide, it well then be able to ensure a
democratic future."
Had the Turkish regime done so in 1915 and
paid the according price in reparations and com
pensation, Hitler would have taken the annihi
lation of the Armenians into account, and
would have been forced to at least reconsider
carrying out his Final Solution. Lyon could pos
sibly have spoken not of Auschwitz and Bergen-
Belsen on Monday, but of the prosperity of the
European Jews during the World War II era.
Tomorrow, on the 89th anniversary of the
Armenian genocide, it is time for Turkey to rec
ognize the wrongs of carrying out the Armenian
genocide, in order to restore the progression of
its own societal development. This will convinc
ingly allow Turkey to encourage the advance
ment of human culture and morality.

Adolf Hitler said it all those years ago. The
National Socialist Party was planning one of the
most horrific events of the 20th century, and
Hitler only looked back once. That moment
came when one of Hitler's generals asked if he
was afraid they would be punished for what they
were about to execute. He casually shrugged oft
the concern, asking in return: "Who today re
members the annihilation of the Armenians?"
The Jewish Holocaust ensued.
On Monday, Holocaust survivor Gloria
Lyon spoke on campus as part of Holocaust
Memorial Day. Listening to Lyon share her
painful experiences, I realized that she was not
only a symbol of enduring strength and sur
vival, but was also a product of a grossly over
looked historical event: the Armenian geno
cide of 1915.
Eighty-nine years ago, the Young Turk
party that was ruling the Ottoman Empire or
chestrated the first genocide of the 20th centu
ry. The Allied powers were preoccupied with
the supposed "war to end all wars." The Young
Turk party had ousted the last royal sovereign
of the Ottoman Empire, Sultan Abdul Hamid
11. from leadership and had risen to power on a

democratic platform. After their victory, the
Young Turks decided to adopt nationalistic
ideals, presenting the idea of pan-Turkism to
the Turkish citizenry.
The Armenians, already segregated from
the Turkish population in millets (religious
communities), were an obstacle to the forma
tion of a pan-Turkish nation. They became the
victims of severe oppression and bigotry, ac
cording to American officials who were present
in Turkey at the time. Without a democracy pro
tecting them, the Armenians were left defense
less under the dictatorial swords of leaders who
wanted to rid the empire of them. Behind the
smokescreen of World War I, the Young Turk
leaders Talaat, Enver and Cemal Pasha saw an
opportunity to do so, and so carried out the ex
termination of 1.5 million Armenians under the
cloak of deportation.
There to witness the Armenian genocide un
folding were U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire Henry Morgenthau and U.S. Consul in
Harput, Turkey, Leslie Davis. Both Morgen
thau, a graduate of Columbia Law School, and
Leslie Davis, a famous American humanitarian,
observed firsthand the systematic murder of the
Armenian race in 1915.
In his memoirs that were later published as

"Ambassador Morgenthau's Story," Morgen
