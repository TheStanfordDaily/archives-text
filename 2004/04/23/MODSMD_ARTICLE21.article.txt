# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

R&DE staff work hard ho
provide student services
Your editorial, "A bureaucracy in
need of reform" (April 19), painted an
inaccurate picture of the Residential &
Dining Enterprises (R&DE) team. Al
though possibly not intended, this arti
cle is an insult to the men and women of
our department who work tirelessly to
meet the needs of students.
What part of the bureaucracy are
you referring to in your article? Are you
speaking of the associate vice provost
and directors, who have spent sleepless
nights planning major renovation pro
jects that would best fit students needs
as well as taking into account the needs
of the University? Could you be refer
ring to the "middle-manager" who ar
rived at five in the morning to ensure
that the Stanford Dining Spring Faire
was held without a hitch? Or perhaps
the Stanford Catering supervisor who
worked until midnight to be sure the

alumni dinner was spectacular? Or per
haps you are targeting the Student
Housing maintenance worker who an
swered a phone call in the middle of the
night and came back to campus to re
solve a maintenance emergency? The
R&DE staff members are individuals
from diverse backgrounds who know
Stanford students by name, mentor stu
dents and go out of their way to consid
er students' needs.
As a 25-year veteran of the depart
ment and the director of conference
services, I have observed employees at
all levels meet the challenge of putting
students first. Staff members in R&DE
consider it a privilege to work here, and
reflect this in their professionalism and
dedication to the student body.
Your portrayal both of Shirley Ev
erett, associate vice provost of Resi
dential & Dining Enterprises, and her
"massive administrative staff' is unjust
and does Everett and her staff mem
bers a gross disservice. Everett is a

highly effective leader, a mentor to
many and the first to fight to meet the
needs of students. Everett challenges
her staff in public and private meetings
to provide exceptional service while
being fiscally responsible so that
R&DE can increase student services.
She is a dedicated professional who de
serves credit for the remarkable and
numerous contributions she has made
in the lives of students, staff and col
leagues over her 13-year tenure at
Stanford University.
I hope that future editorial opinions
will not reflect conclusions that have
been based on a very narrow under
standing of all the factors that must be
considered in providing the highest
quality services to our student popula
tion. 1 would also hope there would be
greater consideration of the impact this
type of editorial makes on a very hard
working and dedicated staff in R&DE.

Stanford's social scene is
far from ideal
Why do criticisms of this campus'
social scene have to be sugar-coated
with equivocating asides about how
oh-so-idyllic-and-wonderful Stanford
is. In the stupendously vaguely titled,
"Come Back Next Weekend" (April
22), columnist Athalie Laguerre ob
serves that this weekend calls for
something "raging, rowdy and down
right ridonculous." She then goes on to
note what we all notice every week
end: Stanford is all but devoid of the
"ridonculous."
So, halfway through this column, I
was confused by Laguerre's assertion
that "Stanford is more fun than all of
the Ivies combined." According to La
guerre, the "dry party at Tresidder"
was more fun than "the lame profro
party at Brown." But Admit Weekend
does not represent Stanford life any
way, so how does this matter?

All that Laguerre can muster in de
fense of Stanford's social integrity is
"elaborately themed frat parties, cut
ting class to lay out in the sun and get
ting refunds on special fees." So we are
a country club with an academic op
tion? Does the possible $90-a-quarter
special-fees refund really make Stan
ford more enticing? And of the whop
ping three Stanford traditions that La
guerre notes Admit Weekend fails to
highlight, only two are social â€” the
Band Run and Full Moon on the
Quad. Also, both are over a month
into first quarter.
We might instead caution prospective
freshman to note how the administra
tion allows us these initial fiestas to let
steam off, to appease us for what will
surely be yet another year of an al
ready-abysmal and still-declining so
cial scene. Two freshmen I know got
arrested in their dorm for drinking in
the hallway.
Oooh, but look at all this sunshine.

And blonde people running. And
the gym full at one in the morning. A
nonexistent film department and a
lagging Classics Department? One
drawing class? Of course, if you are
blonde, athletic and a techie, this
doesn't matter. (Keep on truckin',
mad scientists.) As Laguerre says,
we "work hard, play hard," but that
playing usually gets wasted on intra
mural sports or other thoroughly or
ganized activities.
Profros, take heed: This school is not
much fun if you like a wide, bustling so
cial scene. This is the truth. It gets less
fun every year. Ask any of the older
students. 1 wish we could party like it
literally was 1999. Sadly, it is 2004 and
the campus police have naked pictures
of me from last year's Exotic Erotic.
But then again, I could always lie out in
the sun ...
