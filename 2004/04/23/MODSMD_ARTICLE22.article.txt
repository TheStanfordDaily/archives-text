## Julie refuses to feign interest in sports 
### 
So it's some time after 4:20 in the
early dawn after 4-20, when the
single most disconcerting sound
on Earth — and I don't mean hu
mans burning alive or even Natalie Im
bruglia — wakes me and the rest of the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest. It's the fire
alarm, because some stoner abandoned
the frozen chicken nuggets he stuck in
the toaster oven just long enough for
them to catch fire.
I stood in the freezing cold waiting for
the fire truck to arrive, and instead of
thinking inspiring half-asleep thoughts
about the war on Iraq or the world in
sports, I maintained my discombobulated
state just until the fireman arrived, said
"Did someone call fora stripper?" and let
us back into bed.

Sometimes you're
not inspired, so why
fake it? Nothing is less
interesting than having
to listen to people con
vincing themselves that
they're interested.
This is why you will
never turn to my column
and see me babbling on
about some player on
some professional sports

team in some league having its playoffs.
Why subject you to my own boredom?
So I'm not a big sports fan. I'm not
going to feign some kind of masculine in
terest and convince you that baseball sea
son really gets me fired up.
Now we can begin to unpack the
"sports fanatic's wife" phenomenon. I
have to wonder how many women decid
ed it would be good for the marriage to
create an interest in football so they could
spend more time with their husbands.
Frito-Lays, Joe Montana and a Bud
Light. Just shoot me now. At least, when
you're 20 years into a marriage, you can
check out the pro athletes, who un
doubtedly are in better form than your
couch-potato husband. But none of us
are resigned to this fate, right, because
we're ambitious, break-the-mold Stan
ford students.
Women in general aren't big sports
fans, and the enthusiasm for women'
sports is even more strained. You know,
like the WNBA. (Gymnastics being the
major exception, because of the sex ap
peal factor.) I can't claim to understand
it. because I am part of the phenomenon.
My apathy for sports extends even more
deeply for women's sports, and I'd
rather watch the O.C. than anything else
at this point.
This is horrible, right, because it goes
against everything I should stand for as an
empowered woman who works out regu
larly and has played competitive sports for
most of her life. I should be uplifting the
revolutionary women in the professional
sports world because I am a woman my
self. The problem is, I don't even know
who they are.
I can safely venture that the gender
split on sports enthusiasm has a lot to do
with how we're socialized and a lot less to
do with who has a penis and who has a
vagina. Girls grow up learning how to "be
girls." This is the basic lesson of any Stan
ford social sciences class and is sufficiently
vague to sound convincing.
But that doesn't mean that the solu
tion is to fake having penises and get excit
ed over things we don't care about. It's not
our fault we were raised this way. I say
with no apologies that the commercials are
better than the Super Bowl and the other
team's cheerleaders are more entertaining
than Big Game itself.
This isn't to say that faking interest
isn't sometimes in your best interests.
Take Pro Fro weekend, when bright-eyed
Stanford students-to-be descend upon our
no-fun and no-alcohol campus. Star male
athletes show up at Pro Fro events, con
trary to the rumors that they really only
exist in EV couple's housing and The
Daily's Sports section. They feign interest
in some hopeful high school seniors fora
few days, hook up and retreat back to their
mysterious, elite lifestyles. Feigning inter
est hooks them up.
Poor ProFros. Hasn't anyone watched
Felicity? Don't people know that some
girls actually decide where they go to col
lege based on one elusive senior athlete
that said "hi" to them? Like, you know,
Aaron Landry to the Class of '04.
So fine, drink beer and watch ESPN
.. . resign yourself to being a good male
companion. A lot of women seem to
enjoy it. But I draw the line with faking
orgasms. Really, what's the point? I
would encourage all women to stop fak
ing orgasms. Sex will get no better for
you or the rest of your partner's future
partners if you fake it. It's practically a
feminist cause.
And I am all about feminist causes.

split on sports enthusiasm has a lot to do
with how we're socialized and a lot less to
do with who has a penis and who has a
vagina. Girls grow up learning how to "be
girls." This is the basic lesson of any Stan
ford social sciences class and is sufficiently
vague to sound convincing.
But that doesn't mean that the solu
tion is to fake having penises and get excit
ed over things we don't care about. It's not
our fault we were raised this way. I say
with no apologies that the commercials are
better than the Super Bowl and the other
team's cheerleaders are more entertaining
than Big Game itself.
This isn't to say that faking interest
isn't sometimes in your best interests.
Take Pro Fro weekend, when bright-eyed
Stanford students-to-be descend upon our
no-fun and no-alcohol campus. Star male
athletes show up at Pro Fro events, con
trary to the rumors that they really only
exist in EV couple's housing and The
Daily's Sports section. They feign interest
in some hopeful high school seniors fora
few days, hook up and retreat back to their
mysterious, elite lifestyles. Feigning inter
est hooks them up.
Poor ProFros. Hasn't anyone watched
Felicity? Don't people know that some
girls actually decide where they go to col
lege based on one elusive senior athlete
that said "hi" to them? Like, you know,
Aaron Landry to the Class of '04.
So fine, drink beer and watch ESPN
.. . resign yourself to being a good male
companion. A lot of women seem to
enjoy it. But I draw the line with faking
orgasms. Really, what's the point? I
would encourage all women to stop fak
ing orgasms. Sex will get no better for
you or the rest of your partner's future
partners if you fake it. It's practically a
feminist cause.
And I am all about feminist causes.

So it's some time after 4:20 in the
early dawn after 4-20, when the
single most disconcerting sound
on Earth — and I don't mean hu
mans burning alive or even Natalie Im
bruglia — wakes me and the rest of the
Enchanted Broccoli Forest. It's the fire
alarm, because some stoner abandoned
the frozen chicken nuggets he stuck in
the toaster oven just long enough for
them to catch fire.
I stood in the freezing cold waiting for
the fire truck to arrive, and instead of
thinking inspiring half-asleep thoughts
about the war on Iraq or the world in
sports, I maintained my discombobulated
state just until the fireman arrived, said
"Did someone call fora stripper?" and let
us back into bed.

Sometimes you're
not inspired, so why
fake it? Nothing is less
interesting than having
to listen to people con
vincing themselves that
they're interested.
This is why you will
never turn to my column
and see me babbling on
about some player on
some professional sports

team in some league having its playoffs.
Why subject you to my own boredom?
So I'm not a big sports fan. I'm not
going to feign some kind of masculine in
terest and convince you that baseball sea
son really gets me fired up.
Now we can begin to unpack the
"sports fanatic's wife" phenomenon. I
have to wonder how many women decid
ed it would be good for the marriage to
create an interest in football so they could
spend more time with their husbands.
Frito-Lays, Joe Montana and a Bud
Light. Just shoot me now. At least, when
you're 20 years into a marriage, you can
check out the pro athletes, who un
doubtedly are in better form than your
couch-potato husband. But none of us
are resigned to this fate, right, because
we're ambitious, break-the-mold Stan
ford students.
Women in general aren't big sports
fans, and the enthusiasm for women'
sports is even more strained. You know,
like the WNBA. (Gymnastics being the
major exception, because of the sex ap
peal factor.) I can't claim to understand
it. because I am part of the phenomenon.
My apathy for sports extends even more
deeply for women's sports, and I'd
rather watch the O.C. than anything else
at this point.
This is horrible, right, because it goes
against everything I should stand for as an
empowered woman who works out regu
larly and has played competitive sports for
most of her life. I should be uplifting the
revolutionary women in the professional
sports world because I am a woman my
self. The problem is, I don't even know
who they are.
I can safely venture that the gender
split on sports enthusiasm has a lot to do
with how we're socialized and a lot less to
do with who has a penis and who has a
vagina. Girls grow up learning how to "be
girls." This is the basic lesson of any Stan
ford social sciences class and is sufficiently
vague to sound convincing.
