### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After beating unranked Davidson and losing to No. 6
Duke last weekend in Durham, N.C., the No. 20 Stanford
women's lacrosse team (8-6, 4-0 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) is preparing for its last home game of the season
on Saturday against No. 5 Loyola College.
The Greyhounds boast an impressive 12-2 record this
season, losing only to top-ranked Princeton and No. 7
Virginia. Prior to its loss to Virginia, Loyola won nine
straight games.
The Cardinal has a record of just 5-5 at Maloney Field this
season despite being 30-16 at home since 1997. Stanford has
only faced Loyola on one previous occasion, losing to them
last year at home, 9-5.
Besides being the home finale, Saturday's game will also
be the last home game for seniors Kim Cahill, Tiffany Chao,
Larissa Conte, Katie Grube, Abbi Hills and Christina
Saikus. These seniors have helped Stanford capture four
consecutive league titles and become the first West Coast
school to achieve a national ranking.
"We'll see a lot of intensity because we're playing Loy
ola but also because we want the seniors to see a great fin
ish to a great season," said head coach Michele Uhlfelder.
"The seniors' last home game signifies a lot of progress
that this team has made in a short amount of time. The
rest of our players really want the seniors to go out feel
ing great about their careers and about our last game and
our accomplishments."
Hills leads the team in goals with 30 this season, including
five last weekend, bringing her total to 112 goals during her
time at Stanford. She has played and started in every game
since her freshman year.
Saikus has recorded 127 saves this season and is ranked
eighth in the country in save percentage. Against Ohio State,
Saikus collected 20 saves, the ninth highest single-game total
nationally this season.
"Saikus has the ability to make a huge impact," Uhlfelder
said. "Loyola is a team that uses its speed to get down the
field quickly and challenge one-on-one. Hopefully, our de
fense can force some shots from further out, and if they do,
[Saikus] can be really successful."
In addition to its senior firepower, Stanford's roster
boasts six players who have scored at least 14 goals this sea
son, including junior Kelsey Twist, who leads the team with

11 assists. Sophomore attackers Megan Burker and Sarah
Bach have recorded 22 and 15 goals, respectively, and have
eight assists apiece.
"I think our team has done a good job of focusing on the
things that we need to improve on," Uhlfelder said. "The
team recognizes that we only have a few games left. We only

have a few chances to feel the way we want to feel when the
final whistle blows."
After tomorrow's game against Loyola, the Cardinal only
has one more game against Georgetown on May 1 before
next month's MPSF Championship, in which Stanford will
be the top seed.
