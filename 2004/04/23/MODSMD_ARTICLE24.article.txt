# Women swing into action at Pac-10s
## Cardinal women finish seventh at Pac-10 Conference 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal women's golf squad whipped
up a three-round total of 932 this week at the
2004 Pacific-10 Conference Championships
to finish in seventh place in the team compe
tition. The competition, which was held on
the par-72 course at the Saticoy Country Club
in Somis, Calif., spanned from April 19-21.
Freshman Jennifer Tangtiphaiboontana
lead the Cardinal effort with a seventh-place
individual finish, giving her two top-10 finish
es in as many tournaments.
Tangtiphaiboontana shot a 72 — her best
round of the Championships — on the final
day to give her a stroke total of 226.
No. 2 UCLA easily snatched the confer
ence crown at the event, carding a 902. The
championship was the first for the Bruins
since 1991.
California was 18 strokes behind in second
place, while Arizona came in third with a 923.

Southern California and Arizona State tied
for fourth place with a 928.
The Bruins, not surprisingly, boasted the
top two individual finishes of the competi
tion. Junior Charlotte Mayorkas — UCLA's
first individual champion in 13 years and this
year's Pac-10 Player of the Year — picked up
a two-over-par 218 to win the top honor of
the tournament.
Teammate Hannah Jun, who was recently
named the Pac-10 Newcomer of the Year, was
just behind Mayorkas with a 220.
Wildcat Erica Blasberg narrowly missed
second place with her 221 and the Sun Devils'
Alissa Kuczka carded a 224 to slip into fourth
place. Arizona's Lani Elston and ASU's
Tiffany Tavee tied for fifth with a 225 and
USC's Irene Cho tied with Tangtiphaiboon
tana for seventh.
Stanford junior Wendra Liang ended the
competition in a tie for 12th place, shooting a
232. Senior Kim Kouwabunpat -tied with
sophomore teammate Stephanie Lue for 28th
place after recording a 237 while freshman
Lauren Todd posted a 243, good for 39th
place.
The Cardinal's next big hurdle will be the
NCAA Regional Championships, to be held
early next month at the Stanford Golf
Course.
