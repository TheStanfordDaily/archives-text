### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference Individual
Women's Tennis Championships kicked off
yesterday in Ojai, Calif., reminding the No. 1
Stanford women's team (23-0) that all good
things come to an end.
Stanford sailed through Pac-10 dual match
competition, claiming its 17th consecutive
league title.
But the undefeated Cardinal fell short after
splitting up at Ojai Valley Tennis Center.
Four Cardinal players — senior Emilia An
derson, junior Erin Burdette, sophomore
Alice Barnes and freshman Theresa Logar —
were selected for the elite, 32-member cham
pionship bracket of the 2004 Pac-10 Individu
als.
But only two remain, after No. 72 Ander
son fell to Washington's No. 21 Dea Sumantri
(24-8) in the round of 16, 6-2,6-2, and No. 39
Logar quickly conceded to defending Pac-10
Individual champion Daria Panova, 6-2,6-2.
The upset marked Logar's first loss since
October, when she bowed out of the Stanford

hosted ITA Northwest Championships in the
round of 16. Incidentally, she lost then to No.
10 Panova (31-11) in an epic three-hour, three
set showdown, 6-2,2-6,6-1.
Panova is a two-time title-winner in her ju
nior year, clinching final victory at the ITA
Northwest Championships, as well as at the
Pac-10 Indoors Championships.
However, not all is lost for the Cardinal.
After her first year of collegiate tennis compe
tition, Logar, who formerly pegged herself as a
"deer in the headlights" before her first indi
vidual tournaments in October 2003, ap
proached Pac-lOs with a great deal of confi
dence and composure.
"I guess I dc have a vendetta and I'd like to
settle the score, but if I don't that will be OK
[too]," Logar said before heading into the
match. "It's a good change of pace to not worry
about my results affecting the team. I'm going
to go out and play my game as best as I can, but
if [Panova] wins, more power to her."
Since the tournament's 1987 inception,
Stanford has dominated the Pac-10 Individual
courts, boasting a record nine titles.
Most recently in 2002, then-senior Gabriela

Lastra's silky game led her to a final victory
over Southern California's powerful Jewel Pe
terson, 6-3,6-3.
Being selected for the championships is a
feat in itself. Each of the nine league schools
can send only three players, while a committee
of coaches determines the remaining five can
didates.
After an exceptional performance last
weekend in the doubleheader against UCLA
and the Women of Troy, teammate No. 12
Barnes (31-5) staved off a first-set deficit to
down Oregon's No. 69 Dominika Dieskova
(20-14) in the round of 16,5-7,6-1,6-1.
"My slice backhand came back after being
off fora couple of weeks and that helped me
settle into a good rhythm [last weekend],"
Barnes said before the tournament began. "I
felt very confident again, which is a great sign."
Barnes cruised by Washington's No. 66
Erin Hoe (27-8) in the first round, 6-1,6-1.
No. 25 Burdette (22-3) improved her record
to nine consecutive wins after defeating the
Bruins' Laura Gordon (19-11), 6-1,6-2.
Today, Burdette enters the quarterfinals
against the highest ranked player in the tour

nament, California's No. 4 Raquel Kops-Jones
(24-6). Like Logar, Burdette has past battles
on the brain, after dropping a final decision to
Kops-Jones at the ITA Women's Ail-Ameri
can Championships in October 2003.
The cross-Bay rivals have not met in dual
match play, but their collegiate match record
stands at 2-1 in Kops-Jones's favor.
In doubles action, Stanford brings two
teams to the fray. Barnes and Burdette will
form a new team against UCLA's No. 18
Daniela Bercek and Laura Fisher.
Meanwhile, Anderson and freshman Anne
Yelsey (25-4) continue their dual-match part
nership to face off against Washington's No. 9
Claire Carter and Sumantri (22-11).
Logar reflects upon the tournament experi
ence for her and her teammates with no regrets.
"It's a good chance for everybody to get
back to tennis on an individual basis," Logar
said. "It helped me mentally to be able to play
even when my teammates couldn't be around
to cheer me on."
The Cardinal resumes singles match play
today at noon, with doubles to follow imme
diately.
