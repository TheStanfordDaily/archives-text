# Off big win in SoCal, Card readies for San Jose State
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As far as the standings go, this afternoon's
match against No. 11 San Jose State (14-14,4-
6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) does
not have much significance for the No. 2 Stan
ford women's water polo team. Stanford se
cured the No. 2 seed for the MPSF post-sea
son tournament last weekend with a 9-4 win
over UCLA.
But just because it won't affect their MPSF
seeding doesn't mean the Cardinal is pre
pared to take it easy.
"It's still a must-win," said sophomore
goalkeeper Amanda Matuk.
One final regular-season win would also
keep the Cardinal's momentum going into
the postseason. That momentum could prove
to be important towards securing a berth for
the national championships.
"Playing well against San Jose would be
good," said freshman driver Katie Hansen.
"It's good going into MPSFs [coming off] a
good game and not just winning but playing
well together."
"We want to keep playing well, for sure,"
said Stanford head coach John Tanner. "This
is almost part of the postseason, so we need to
be playing very efficiently. We need to be
sharp in every phase of the game. The expec
tations are pretty high, in terms of our level of
play, fora game like this."
While the seeding for the MPSF tourna
ment has been set, the at-large berth for the
NCAA Championships is at stake. A loss
this late in the season against a lower
ranked team would lessen the Cardinal's
chances for an at-large berth if they fail to

win the MPSF title.
"We don't get anything by winning but
we get a lot by losing," said senior driver
Lauren Faust.
The game kicks off this afternoon at 4
p.m., since the Cardinal doesn't have to
travel far to meet the Spartans. Stanford
heads into the game having won four
straight against conference opponents. The
Cardinal has won nine of its last 10
matchups, with its only loss coming from
undefeated and top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia (20-0, 10-0 MPSF).
"We're playing better with each passing
week and we've had good practices," Tanner
said. "We need to have that reflected in how
we play [today]."
Much of Stanford's success is due to its de
fense, strongly backed by goalkeeper
Meridith McColl. In her first year at Stanford,
McColl already leads the conference with a
4.31 goals-against average and was recently
named MPSF Player of the Week for holding
UCLA (19-4, 9-2) scoreless for two periods
last weekend. McColl and fellow goalkeeper
Matuk have combined to take Stanford to the
top of the stats charts in saves.
Of course, the Cardinal's defense alone
has not propelled it to where the team is.
While Stanford doesn't stand above all its op
ponents in scoring, it certainly has held its
own this year. Senior 2-meter defender
Wendy Watkins leads the squad with 25 goals
followed by junior 2-meter Hannah Luber
with 23 and Hansen with 20.
In fact, every offensive player has scored
at least once this season. Playing against San
Jose gives Stanford an opportunity to show
this depth, despite having a team composed

of mostly freshmen and sophomores.
"Twelve field players can play solidly
without a changeup in our lineup." Faust
said. "That's one of our biggest points.
[Today's game] will show how many people
can really play."
With both aspects of the game combined,
the Stanford defense and offense have
worked to outscore opponents, 159-89.
San Jose State, on the other hand, is de
pendent on a win to move up in the MPSF
standings. The Spartans are currently tied in
seventh with No. 9 California (13-11, 4-6
MPSF). After splitting its games last week
end, San Jose is desperate fora final win to
avoid an eighth-place seed. A Cal loss, cou
pled with a San Jose upset over Stanford,
would push the Spartans up to sixth.
The Spartans hope to do some damage
to Stanford with junior Laura Scott and
sophomore Angela Riddle. Scott has found
the back of the cage 41 times, twice in her
most recent game. Riddle follows with 33
goals. Junior Michelle Rozzen guards the
net for the Spartans.
"The challenge with San Jose is that they
play a fast, mobile style," Tanner said.
"They require us to play great one-on-one
defense. We're playing really well in terms
of our team defense but it will be an inter
esting challenge."
After much work this season, the Cardinal
is sure of its chances against San Jose.
Stanford can take advantage of this last game
to prepare for the postseason.
"After UCLA, we cleared up a lot of the
things we needed to work on," Faust said.
"Just showing that tomorrow will give us
some momentum."

said Stanford head coach John Tanner. "This
is almost part of the postseason, so we need to
be playing very efficiently. We need to be
sharp in every phase of the game. The expec
tations are pretty high, in terms of our level of
play, fora game like this."
While the seeding for the MPSF tourna
ment has been set, the at-large berth for the
NCAA Championships is at stake. A loss
this late in the season against a lower
ranked team would lessen the Cardinal's
chances for an at-large berth if they fail to

win the MPSF title.
"We don't get anything by winning but
we get a lot by losing," said senior driver
Lauren Faust.
The game kicks off this afternoon at 4
p.m., since the Cardinal doesn't have to
travel far to meet the Spartans. Stanford
heads into the game having won four
straight against conference opponents. The
Cardinal has won nine of its last 10
matchups, with its only loss coming from
undefeated and top-ranked Southern Cali
fornia (20-0, 10-0 MPSF).
"We're playing better with each passing
week and we've had good practices," Tanner
said. "We need to have that reflected in how
we play [today]."
Much of Stanford's success is due to its de
fense, strongly backed by goalkeeper
Meridith McColl. In her first year at Stanford,
McColl already leads the conference with a
4.31 goals-against average and was recently
named MPSF Player of the Week for holding
UCLA (19-4, 9-2) scoreless for two periods
last weekend. McColl and fellow goalkeeper
Matuk have combined to take Stanford to the
top of the stats charts in saves.
Of course, the Cardinal's defense alone
has not propelled it to where the team is.
While Stanford doesn't stand above all its op
ponents in scoring, it certainly has held its
own this year. Senior 2-meter defender
Wendy Watkins leads the squad with 25 goals
followed by junior 2-meter Hannah Luber
with 23 and Hansen with 20.
In fact, every offensive player has scored
at least once this season. Playing against San
Jose gives Stanford an opportunity to show
this depth, despite having a team composed

of mostly freshmen and sophomores.
"Twelve field players can play solidly
without a changeup in our lineup." Faust
said. "That's one of our biggest points.
[Today's game] will show how many people
can really play."
With both aspects of the game combined,
the Stanford defense and offense have
worked to outscore opponents, 159-89.
San Jose State, on the other hand, is de
pendent on a win to move up in the MPSF
standings. The Spartans are currently tied in
seventh with No. 9 California (13-11, 4-6
MPSF). After splitting its games last week
end, San Jose is desperate fora final win to
avoid an eighth-place seed. A Cal loss, cou
pled with a San Jose upset over Stanford,
would push the Spartans up to sixth.
The Spartans hope to do some damage
to Stanford with junior Laura Scott and
sophomore Angela Riddle. Scott has found
the back of the cage 41 times, twice in her
most recent game. Riddle follows with 33
goals. Junior Michelle Rozzen guards the
net for the Spartans.
"The challenge with San Jose is that they
play a fast, mobile style," Tanner said.
"They require us to play great one-on-one
defense. We're playing really well in terms
of our team defense but it will be an inter
esting challenge."
After much work this season, the Cardinal
is sure of its chances against San Jose.
Stanford can take advantage of this last game
to prepare for the postseason.
"After UCLA, we cleared up a lot of the
things we needed to work on," Faust said.
"Just showing that tomorrow will give us
some momentum."

As far as the standings go, this afternoon's
match against No. 11 San Jose State (14-14,4-
6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) does
not have much significance for the No. 2 Stan
ford women's water polo team. Stanford se
cured the No. 2 seed for the MPSF post-sea
son tournament last weekend with a 9-4 win
over UCLA.
But just because it won't affect their MPSF
seeding doesn't mean the Cardinal is pre
pared to take it easy.
"It's still a must-win," said sophomore
goalkeeper Amanda Matuk.
One final regular-season win would also
keep the Cardinal's momentum going into
the postseason. That momentum could prove
to be important towards securing a berth for
the national championships.
"Playing well against San Jose would be
good," said freshman driver Katie Hansen.
"It's good going into MPSFs [coming off] a
good game and not just winning but playing
well together."
"We want to keep playing well, for sure,"
said Stanford head coach John Tanner. "This
is almost part of the postseason, so we need to
