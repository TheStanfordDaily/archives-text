# Students plan mission to Mars

### MARISA C.JUÁREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
When President George W.
Bush announced earlier this
year that NASA should focus
on going to Mars, one Stanford
gtoup had already been work
ing on it. The Stanford for
Space Campaign has been ad
vocating going to Mars for over
10 years, and last week they at
tended the President's Com
mission on Space Exploration
in San Francisco, determined to
argue for the necessity of new
space missions.
Malia Kilpinen and Jordan
Drewitt, first-year master's stu
dents in Aeronautics and Astro
nautics and members of the
public relations team for the
Stanford for Space Campaign,
hope to interest the public in a
new mission. They described
their goal as spreading the word
about a mission to Mars as much

as possible. One part of achiev
ing this goal is the plan for an
event in cooperation with
NASA to expose children,
teachers and adults to the mis
sion prospects.
"Our generation is the one
that's going to be walking on
Mars," Drewitt said. •
"I think more young people
need to be interested in going to
Mars," Kilpinen added.
Both Drewitt and Kilpinen
described the goal of their cam
paign as finding the most cost-ef
fective way to go to Mars as soon
as possible.
"A lot of people are interest
ed in going to Mars," Kilpinen
said. "}But| currently there is no
strong young campaign involved
with the project."
The campaign began as a
class, Engineering 235, which
has been going on for over 10
years. While the project is class
based, students often continue

into the summer, researching
outside of class.
"[The class) is a starting point
for taking your research where
you want to go" Drewitt said.
The campaign consists of
seven teams, focusing on issues
ranging from human factors to
mission planning and orbital me
chanics; the teams work together
to plan fora theoretical mission.
With students' backgrounds
ranging from aerospace and en
gineering to political science and
economics, the class is able to
combine different disciplines to
cover all the aspects that a mis
sion to Mars might entail.
Julie Litzenberger, a first
year graduate student in Me
chanical Engineering, described
the President's Commission as
an opportunity to promote the
"race to Mars" outside of
NASA. Although open to the
public, she estimated that only
30 to 40 people attended the

event, held at the Galileo Acad
emy of Science and Technology.
"The whole point [was] to
have panels and get enough in
formation to form a concrete
plan for the country," said
Litzenberger.
Some of the panels included
"Entertainment and Space Ex
ploration," "Educating Tomor
row's Astronauts" — aimed at
getting students back into sci
ence and technology — and
"Projects for Space Prosperity."
"The focus was: "how can we
make this project sustainable?'"
said Litzenberger, "Fora long
term, 30 to 40 year project, how
do we keep people interested?"
Overall, the campaign hopes
to find a way to Mars through in
ternational cooperation.
"The world is going to Mars
whether we [the U.S.] want to or
not," Kilpinen said. "It's either
going to be a space race, or we're
all going together."
