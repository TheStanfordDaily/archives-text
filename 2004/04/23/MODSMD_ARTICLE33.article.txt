# Stimpson silently shines

### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Jeff Stimpson is a paradox.
He's become an ace reliever for the Stanford baseball team early in his
freshman year, but he doesn't have an attitude. You know because you've
'seen it before. The cocky, self-assured reliever that thrives in ultra-stressful
situations is all too common. Stimpson, however, is soft-spoken, genuine
and maybe even a little boring.
"I don't have that athlete aura about me," he said. "I don't bring it up
in conversation and unless it comes up that I'm a baseball player, I don't
like to talk about it. People can know me fora few weeks and not know I
play baseball."
That's not just talk. It's true.
He didn't believe his teammates when they told him he was Pac-10 Play
er of the Week two weeks ago.
He downplays his excitement at getting his first career win and save in the
last fortnight.
And he looks down timidly every time his dorm friends in Otero sing his
praises after he pitches the Cardinal to victory.
All in all, Stimpson is not your normal late-inning guy.
Just ask his RA.
"He's so ridiculously humble," said Sam Stefanki, who also doubles as
the radio voice of Cardinal baseball on KZSU. "He's so reserved that he
didn't make any waves when he introduced himself early in the year."
Apparently, Stimpson forgot to mention that he was a baseball player in
his dorm application.
"He just listed that he was recruited to play baseball," Stefanki recalls,
"We only learned that he was actually playing in the first couple of days
of school."
Yet this sheepishness hasn't stopped him from shining early in the
2004 campaign.
Stimpson leads the Stanford pitching staff with a 0.87 ERA and has al
lowed only 11 hits in 20 2/ 3 innings while striking out 18 and walking only
eight. Opponents have hit a paltry .159 against him.
What's been the key to such early success for Stimpson?
There's most definitely a general consensus on that one.
"He likes to compete, and when he competes, he throws a lot of strikes,"
pitching coach Tom Kunis said. "He's got a pretty mature approach fora
young man."
Added Stimpson: "It's been important for me to have an aggressive men
tality, which means attacking hitters and throwing strikes."
He did a lot of that two weekends ago in Corvallis, when he threw four
shutout innings over two games, allowing only one hit, striking out six and
earning his first-ever collegiate victory — a performance that earned him
conference player of the week honors for the first time in his career.
"I was in complete disbelief when I found out," he said. "Brian Hall told
me in the locker room after practice and I just told him to shut up. Then I
went home, checked on the Web site, and sure enough, it was true."
Last weekend against Cal, he also picked up his first career save when he
threw two scoreless innings in relief of starter Mark Romanczuk. Stimpson
entered the game right after Romanczuk gave up a two-run home run that
put the Golden Bears back in the game.
"I was proud of myself because that was a high-pressure situation,"
Stimpson said. "They had gotten the momentum but I proved to myself that
I could handle that."
And Stimpson will only continue to get better.
He has pretty much mastered his low-90s fastball and can locate it with
deadly precision. His curveball is also coming along just fine — he's even
been striking out some guys with it recently. His changeup and slider are
next in line.
Even though he's clearly established himself as one of the top relievers
on the staff along with senior closer David O'Hagan, Stimpson is taking
nothing for granted.
"It's not a permanent role," he said. "If I don't keep being successful, I
could lose it like anyone else. Every time you go out there, you are fighting
for your job."

To even be in this situation probably seemed unfathomable to Stimpson
earlier in the year. He struggled with his mechanics in the fall and began to
lose his confidence.
"I didn't think I had a spot for myself," he said. "The coaches and
pitchers kept telling me I needed to have more confidence in myself and
be more aggressive."
Stimpson returned from winter break in good shape physically and
mentally, and that paid off early in the spring. He began his college career
with 12 2/3 scoreless innings, showing himself that he truly belonged
with the big boys.
The Stanford coaching staff has tampered very little with Stimpson's mo
tion, outside of trying to make him more consistent in coming completely
straight toward his target. Manager Mark Marquess, for one, doesn't want

to spoil a good thing.
"Relievers are like field-goal kickers. When they're going good, you just
stay away from them and don't screw them up and make them think too
much," he said. "It's such a fine line."
Speaking of lines, the Stanford baseball team has gotten to the finish line
at the College World Series three out of the last five years and has come up
short every time. One theme of the failures has been ace relief pitching dis
appearing into thin air.
Stimpson said he watched the Cardinal meltdown against Rice last June.
"It was hard to watch knowing I was going to Stanford," he said.
Stanford will surely need Stimpson at his best if they reach that round
again — and he might need to find that killer instinct to stave off the demons
of past years.

Freshman hurler Jeff Stimpson walked auietly onto the Stanford baseball scene, but his entrance aot noticed when he did not allow a run in nearly 13 innings
of relief pitching. The righthander now looks to be one of the Cardinal's most reliable men out of the bullpen.
