# Rookie Rinehart leads team into Pac-10 play
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
With batting averages ranging from
.500 to .048 and a 5-4 league record, it's
clear that Stanford's starting nine has
yet to find its swing in Pacific-10 Confer
ence play. And with daunting games
against No. 4 UCLA and No. 6 Washing
ton approaching, there is no moment
better than this one for the Cardinal
softball squad to rediscover its stroke.
No problem, freshman left fielder
Jackie Rinehart will tell you.
"The Pac-10 is basically where all the
best softball is played," she said.
"We've struggled [at some points], but
we've also played really well, and we'll
get into it."
Rinehart's confidence comes in part
from the fact that when it comes to the
Pac-10, she's seen it all before.
The Reno, Nev., native will see at
least five familiar faces this weekend —
Bruins starters Caitlin Benyi, Lisa
Dodd, Andrea Duran, Jodie Legaspi and
Emily Zaplatosch were all, along with
Rinehart, members of the 2003 Junior
Olympic squad that cruised to a silver
medal at the World Championships in
China in October 2003.
Rinehart describes the Champi
onships as the most thrilling experience
in her softball career. She had played in
ternational teams for years, but had
never done so outside of North America.

"We were there two weeks," Rinehart
said, "but it never lost its excitement."
Rinehart said that in many instances
her softball opponents did not speak En
glish, but that didn't stop the teams from
forming camaraderie around the sport,
which made the atmosphere extremely
friendly and welcoming to Rinehart and
the rest of Team U.S.A.
Even though Rinehart and her team
mates were able to match up with some
of the best in the world, NCAA compe
tition has been a challenge, especially in
conference action.
Of UCLA's five 2003 Team U.S.A.
members, four —Benyi, Dodd, Duran
and Zaplatosch — have season batting
averages that notably exceed their Pac
-10 averages.
Rinehart has experienced the same
phenomenon. The Cardinal's leadoff
hitter has only four base knocks in 11
conference games — a number that will
likely rise if the season so far has been
any indication.
Though only a rookie, Rinehart is
pacing the team with an impressive .389
season average. She also holds the team
lead in hits with 56 and on-base percent
age (.422), while ranking second in runs
scored (31).
Rinehart attributes her fairly smooth
transition to collegiate hitting to Stan
ford head coach John Rittman, who had
her making improvements to her tech
nique from the moment she arrived on

the Farm.
"I had to make a lot of adjustments
right away," Rinehart said. "It's really
helpful to have a coaching staff that's so
knowledgeable . . . [Rittman] told me
right away what I could do better [and]
how to do it."
It turns out that eliminating the stride
that Rinehart used at the plate before
coming to Stanford helped her develop
into more of a power threat.
The work that Rinehart put into fine
tuning her swing combined with the en
ergy that she exhibited in establishing
herself on a team of proven athletes
earned her a starting spot on the squad.
Rinehart has been in left field from pitch
one of all 45 of the Cardinal's matchups.
"I definitely had to work my way into
the lineup," Rinehart said. "We have
some great players in the outfield ... so
I had to work hard. I didn't expect to
start when I got here. I didn't expect
anything."
While Stanford has exceeded her ex
pectations — Rinehart's happy descrip
tions of her Stanford experience on and
off the field all illustrate that fact — the
outfielder has exceeded a few expecta
tions herself and the upcoming confer
ence schedule gives her even more op
portunities to do so.
"It's just a higher level of play," she
said of the Pac-10 games this weekend.
"But I'm working hard to meet it."
