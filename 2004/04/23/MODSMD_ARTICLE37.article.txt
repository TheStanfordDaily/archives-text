# The 						Hollywood (sex) Life
## 
### JENNY STINGLE GOSSIP COLUMNIST 
- The British press report that David
Bcckham cheated on his wife, Posh,
with a former assistant. To add insult
to injury, rumor has it they listened to
"Wannabe" as they performed the
horizontal tango.
- Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is to be
come a hyphen-less woman yet
again: She and John split. Friends say
that the former Uncle Jesse plans to
fulfill his role as leather-clad pimp
daddy and lust after the now-legal
Olson twins.
- Dios mio! Tom Cruise ended things
with his Spanish senorita, Penelope
Cruz. Our sources report that he
plans to extinguish rumors of homo
sexuality once and for all by hooking
up with the guy that plays Jack on
"Will & Grace." Wait a second ...
- A ray of hope amidst the darkness
of celebrity break-ups: Pamela An
derson and Tommy Lee are marrying
again. It's official: Pamela's head is
really just a third silicone breast.
And now, because this is the sex
issue, your humble correspondent of
fers her thoughts on film's greatest
sex scenes:

1) The menage a trios with Dcnisc
Richards, Neve Campell and Matt
Dillon in "Wild Things." I can t lie:
As horrible as this movie is, I can't
change the channel when it's on FX
(which is far too often).
2) Rebecca DeMornay and Tom
Cruise in "Risky Business." As
urine-coated and rat infested as
trains may be in real life, the fantasy
remains. Subways will never be the
same again.
3) Ana Lope/ Mercado, Diego Luna
and Gael Garcia Bernal in "Y Tu
Mama Tanibien." Unlike the objecti
fying "Wild Things" threesome (as
glorious as it is), finally here is a scene
that would make my feminist studies
professor proud: two hot Latin boys
on one woman.
4) Brad Pitt and Geena Davis in
"Thelma & Louise." It's short, but
so great. Brad Pitt really has never
been hotter.
5) Jared Leto and Claire Danes in the
boiler room on "My So-Called Life."
Okay, so they didn't actually have
sex, but this scene definitely made
every pre-pubescent, awkward girl in
junior high want to grab that hot sev
enth grade stud into some dark, des
olate corner of school and have her
way with him.
