So what all did the
1988 now-classic film
"Big" do for Ameri-

ca? Let's see... it allowed Tom Hanks to
make the acquaintance of serious acting,
made me really jealous of those spoiled
brats whose parents bought them those
ginormous pianos for Christmas, and in
spired the Broadway musical "big"
(that's right — it was pretentious enough
to go with a lower-cased title).
But wait, there's more! 16 years after we
were all grossed out by the prospect of a
30-year-old woman sleeping with a 13-
year-old boy (albeit in a man's body), we
get "13 Going on 30," a feminized version
of "Big" that pays homage to the wacky
decade when we all believed that those
get-your-fortune-for-a-quarter things ac
tually granted wishes.
Although it's the kind of adorable
flick you want to take home and pet as if
it were a two-week-old pug, "13 Going on
30" (directed by Gary Winick) simply
can't overcome its own unoriginality and
predictability to be anything more than
just cutesy.
As her thirteenth birthday party sput
ters to a crash-and-burn conclusion,
Jenna Rink finds herself sick of stuffing
her bra with Kleenex and being unrea
sonably envious of the cool girls who are
called, tellingly, the Six Chicks. Locking
herself in the board game cupboard and
wishing she were past all of that middle
school awkwardness, Jenna wakes up as a
30-year-old version of herself (Jennifer
Garner — so hot right now) in a swanky
Manhattan apartment.
Dazed, confused,and impressed with
the boobs she'd grown over the past 17
years, Jenna discovers she has become
exactly what she wanted to be: the sev
enth Six Chick, prom queen and ulti
mately a materialistic Cosmo-style maga
zine editor. Soon, after realizing that her
best friend, former First Chick Lucy
(Judy Greer), is a conniving bitch, she fig-

ures out that she's no
better, having been a
seducer of married
men and extraordinari
ly rude to her under
lings at work during
the 17 years she's
skipped.

13 Going on 30

I'm Not Seared
itiririri:

In an attempt to put herself together
again, Jenna hunts down her childhood
best friend, Matt (played by Mark Ruffa
lo), who's now engaged to be wed. Jenna
becomes embroiled in a two-front race
against time: She must turn around her
slumping mag with a redesign proposal
before a quickly approaching deadline
and win Matt over before he gets mar
ried.
"13 Going on 30" delivers on certain
levels. Jennifer Garner, whose exuber
ance keeps the movie afloat, portrays the
fish-out-of-water magnificently. The film
works best when it plays on Jenna's 80s
ness. She thinks it's cool to do the
Michael Jackson "Thriller" dance in a
nightclub. She digs pastels. And she an
swers the query "Who's your daddy?"
with an innocent "Wayne Rink." The
comedic elements of the film work ex
tremely well.
But it just seems like this movie's been
made before. The scene with Jenna in a
stretch limo screams for Tom Hanks to
be messing with the radio stations, and
the one in the boardroom begs for Hanks
to look quizzically at a Transformer that
regretfully turns only into a building. Se
quences in which Jenna mopes about her
misfortunes are also cliched. And al
though I'll suspend belief enough to buy
into the wish-yourself-ahead-17-years
plot line, the supports crumble when
nasty Lucy and the Six Chicks sink to new
depths of cruelty towards poor Jenna.
Still, this flick couldn't have kept itself
from being funny and cute even if it tried.
It's both charming and nostalgic and has
all of the makings of a good date movie. I
just wish the filmmakers could have
thought of something that hadn't been

Sure, the massive expanse of gold
en wheat stalks blanketing the
rolling hills of southern Italy may
be beautiful to look at. And in di
rector Gabriele Salvatores's Ital
ian thriller "I'm Not Scared," they

certainly are. The fields take on the appearance of
some kind of shimmering agrarian heaven, a place
Thomas Jefferson would have looked at and smiled.
But just think of how tremendously bored you'd be
living there with fields stretching out into eternity, em
phasizing a world with endless possibilities and letting
you know that there's a unique one for you, one that
involves staying in the middle of a wheat field because
you're too young to drive and your bicycle chain snaps
only minutes into the story.
Such is life for 10-year-old Michele (Giuseppe
Cristiano) and the other handful of children in this
poor farming village. To amuse themselves on endless
summer days, these kids hang out in a creepy aban
doned house and dare each other to perform cruel and
death-defying feats that mirror the unfair, twisted lives
of the adults these children know and love.
While running back towards the abandoned build
ing to retrieve his sister's forgotten spectacles,
Michele comes across a secret hole in the ground. Un
covering the clandestine cave reveals a boy, chained
and starving, who hallucinates that he's already dead.
Terrified but brave enough to return, Michele is kind
to the imprisoned Filippo (Mattia Di Pierro) and
brings him food and water, and, eventually, befriends
him.
But Michele does not do the obvious thing and tell
his father, Pino (Dino Abbrescia), about Filippo. But
then again, even if he were your only role model,
would you let your pops in on a huge secret if he were
a grease ball of a chain-smoker whose only way of

communicating with you was through arm-wrestling?
Instead, Michele (who remains the camera's focus
throughout the film) lets the mystery play out in front
of him. When he eavesdrops on a conversation and
discovers that Pino and his cronies are the kidnappers,
Michele now finds himself in a dilly of a pickle. His fil
ial love is unwavering — losing faith in his father is not
an option, but neither is maintaining his previous level
of innocence.
What makes this film genuinely amazing is it's utter
lack of superfluity. Nothing, not a ceramic bowl nor a
handful of matches, gets screen time without reason.
Niccold Ammanit's screenplay — based on his own
novel — employs foreshadowing with unsurpassed
skill. The film is so clever because, while simple and
straightforward, it manages to be sharp enough to
have even the tiniest plot elements return. You don't
want to miss a minute.
Through all of its wit, "I'm Not Scared" remains a
classic thriller. Though no monsters jump out from
crevices, the feeling that something horribly sinister
will happen to Michele and Filippo pervades the film.
The threat of gore here is much more powerful than
the actual thing.
But "I'm Not Scared" is all about the details. The
adults' defeat shines through in the scene in which a
truckload of shoes is brought to the village. These lan
guishing folk desire something better, and yearn to es
cape from their prison of golden wheat fields. Though
Michele is too young to comprehend the emotional
barrenness of his elders, the audience almost feels for
Pino and his malevolent, get-rich-quick scheme.
The characters in this picturesque Italian village
are, as Michele finds out, all too human. Just like
Michele, the audience finds itself wanting to hold onto
its innocence, clutching it as if we were Linus and in
nocence were our security blanket. "I'm Not Scared"
shows us a truth: The human condition simply won't
allow us to keep that blanket forever.
