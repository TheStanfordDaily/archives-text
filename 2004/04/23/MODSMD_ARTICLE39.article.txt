OBVIOUSLY SEXY
South stacks: Smells like learning! And feet.
Your dorm laundry room: But don't use the front
loading washers.
Moving buses (NOT Marguerite) at night. Either
hook-up or sleep like a baby, excellent choices both.
History Corner: Open all night long + an abundance
of gigantic conference tables = PIZZA PARTY.
The pews off MemChu: Lord, what is it about those
fuckin' Catholics?
LESS OBVIOUSLY SEXY
West stacks: Gnomes do it there. You can hear them
if you're really quiet.
"New" Tressidder Deathless modernity and hot, hot
molded plastic.
5-Sure limo: Relive Junior Prom night, except now
you get drunk.
Stanford Golf Course: Get on a bench, bring Dristam
Ultra if you have allergies.
ABSOLUTELY NOT
Tressidder Fitness: Stair-steppers and spirochetes as
far as the eye can see. Better to get fat than typhoid.
The computer cluster: Please stop masturbating in
the cluster. Thank you.
Lakeside (Lake Lagunita): Nature isn't always sexy.
On second thought, it's hardly ever sexy. And the
lake makes my face itch.
Office hours: Look, it's understandable, but just
DON'T DO IT.
