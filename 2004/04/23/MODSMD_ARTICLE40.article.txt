# Sex up your music, sex up your life!
## 
### JENNIE KIM INTERMISSION CRITIC 
In observance of this week's Sex Issue, I'm
devoting my column to music that will en
courage all things sexual. You see? I'm
doing my part. Now go at it.

Girls: Your Celine Dion CD will actually make his penis
shrink.
Guys: Keep your rap music light on the misogyny (un
less she's into that).
Play Led Zeppelin at your own risk, as 14-minute
long guitar solos will only accentuate tedious situations.
