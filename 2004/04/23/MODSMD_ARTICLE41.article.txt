Sex across the Bay:
A Kal Bear speaks

"Given the opportunity to talk
about sex and Berkeley, I wasn't
quite sure where to begin. Notice, 1
didn't use the words sex at Berke
ley because those are two entirely
different things. As a freshman in
the dorms, I'm put at the wonder
ful advantage of being able to meet
new people all the time.
The typical high school male
goes into his freshman year think
ing 'Oh, I'm so going to get laid,'
without any consideration for
other factors that may impede his
progress such as upperclassmen,
sleazy frat boys, jocks and the
other thousands of males walking
around campus. That's the first fal
lacy, and this is applicable to most
colleges.
The second fallacy is that we're
at Berkeley. While the campus it
self is gorgeous and there are al
ways a few beautiful girls walking
around, you might have to kiss
those big pimpin' dreams good
bye if you're a science major. The
courseload is rigorous, to say the
least, and it all depends on what
major you pursue, because if you
don't choose carefully you may
never see daylight let alone chase
after girls. This includes engi
neers, science majors, and our in
famous math majors who usually
go insane by the time they gradu
ate. If you're planning on getting
some —go into the humanities.
Go into poli sci, go into mass com
munication, but dear God don't
go into molecular cell biology.
There are exceptions to the
rule, however, and students are ex
empt from them given that they
satisfy one of three conditions. The
first is that you're a non-science /
math / engineering major. The sec
ond is that you're in a frat and the
third, is that you're William Hung.
I can't even imagine how many
times he's been approached by
girls here; they just love the guy.
Basically, sex and Berkeley
don't go together if you're a sci
ence major. While I could bitch
and moan about why I'm not even
sure why I'm in the sciences any-

more, I'm
still pretty

certain we
have it bet-

ter than the

Farm. (Hey,

I had to slip in at

least one prod). Since
the free rights move
ment, hippie love,
and a good portion 1
of the orgy that was
the 60's started here

— I propose that we start a second
sexual revolution, but this time
without the drugs, rampant STDs
and moral deviancy.
Okay, so that plan couldn't pos
sibly work, but at least I tried."

"While attending Portland State University as an undergrad, I have dated a sado
masochistic Diesel-wearing cyber-hippie with a 9-to-5 job and an entire website devoted to his
gayness (even though he is straight), a scruffy graffiti artist, and a Jesus-loving frat boy who
drove a sports car, just to name a few (oddly enough, the quasi-gay man was the hottest sex
EVER).
Needless to say, PSU offers a veritable buffet of freakery, there's something for everyone
here. If you like that bearded, Nalgene-bottle toting variety that never showers.
I finally kissed the PSU dating scene goodbye and snagged a fellow intern at the newspaper 1
work for. And thank God —it wasn't the first time an intern scored.
Oh yeah, PSU is also a huge commuter school. There's nary a drop of community here, so
anytime you pay anyone the least bit of attention, they start salivating uncontrollably at the
rare opportunity for human interaction. It's a total freak show. But hey, I got a lot of free din
ners out of it."

"Frat boys, frat boys everywhere, but not a
one to date. Here at Cornell, there are 40 frater
nities, 2000-plus brothers, and a different theme
party every weekend. In my experience, the
'best parties' are sweaty, drunken, half-dressed
grind-fests. If I was looking for someone to wine
and dine me, I definitely wouldn't find him at a
house. I have found, however, either a brother or
a random sketchball who's willing to pump the
keg and get me seven more beers, all for the small
price of my naked company later on in the night -
and you can bet your ass he thinks I'm going to
sleep with him. Not my idea of an enjoyable date,
thanks.
Sure, there are couples and people who are
'dating,' but I would argue this just means they
hook up with only one person, they are nowhere
to be found at the giant parties, and they are not
fraternity boys. Of course there are some nice,
thoughtful, goal-oriented guys who aren't in fra
ternities. These guys are either in a three year re
lationship with their girlfriends from home, are
second semester seniors, or could be classified as
social hermits.
I'd love to tell you about the dating scene at
Cornell, but I'm afraid it's non-existent from my
vantage point. Maybe as juniors, the boys will
outgrow their need to sleep with as many partial
ly dressed girls as possible, and actually stop to
ask their names and if they would like to go out
for sushi sometime."

Harvard: Still slightly less
attractive than Stanford since 1892

"At some point early on in my first semester
at Harvard, I remember asking an upperclass
man, 'So, what's the dating scene like at Harvard?'
This upperclassman told me that, with respect to
dating and relationships, the entire Harvard pop
ulation can, for the most part, be broken down
into two general categories. One category con
sists of those who are so deeply committed to their
significant others that they might as well be mar
ried. The other category consists of those inter
ested in nothing more serious than a series of ran
dom, meaningless hook-ups. Thus, according to
this upperclassman, Harvard essentially has no
'dating scene.'
I had a hard time buying into my older (and
wiser) friend's insight. After all, a great education
and lifelong friendships were not the only things
that I was looking to get out of my college experi
ence. I also wanted to find love. I wanted a col
lege sweetheart. I wanted to look back on my col
lege years and find it colored with meaningful
memories of love and heartbreak and personal
growth. I wanted to experience the college dating
scene. Yet, according to my friend, I was not going
to find anything of the sort at Harvard. Instead, I
would eventually find myself falling into one of
two categories. And, since I was single at the time
and had no potential boyfriends in mind, my
friend predicted that 1 would fall into the latter
category.
At the time, I told my friend that he was full of
shit and that I would be an exception to his claim.
I was not going to trivialize my college experience
by treating it as a hook-up marathon. Yet, a year
and a half later, I cannot help but start to wonder
if my friend had been right all along. Every stu
dent at Harvard possesses, to some extent, a type
A personality. We are all, in one way or another,
extremely driven and ambitious and blindly dedi
cated to whatever is our passion. With the desire
to deeply commit ourselves to each of our cause,
we have no time or emotional energy to truly in
vest ourselves in serious relationships. Thus, in
stead, we deal with our natural desires for com
panionship in one of two ways-we commit our
selves to one and only one person or we don't
commit at all."
