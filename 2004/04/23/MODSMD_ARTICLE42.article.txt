# Audioerotica: Your stereo never had it so good
## 
### CODY PAGE LEADER OF MEN, PURVEYOR OF JUSTICE 
It has been a very long year. Justin
got back at Britney, Britney kissed
Madonna, Ben left Jennifer. Christina

discovered assless chaps, Janet discov
ered the value of mammary celebrity,
and Creed continued to make the worst
music ever. Ludacris and Maroon 5 were
martyred by the FCC, cell phone afi
cionado Paris Hilton got martyred in the
homemade kind of way. In the end,
women still want to have sex with Carson

I )aly and no one knows why.
I know it's trendy to hate on pop cul
ture. Indy snobs often find themselves in
the paradoxical position of having to im
merse themselves in the Top-40 in order
to have the authority to trash it and then
later claim the superiority of Modest
Mouse. There is safety in touting the clas
sics over the modem day just as there is
safety in touting indy bands over main
stream ones: You sound cooler, more cul
tured, educated-er. And you know, I'm
about to do the same thing... but not
blindly. Not by definition. If you're

going to talk about music, you're even
tually going to talk about sex. And if
you're going to talk about sex in music,
don't talk to me about the "Toxic"
video, T.A.T.U. or Tommy Lee. That
is not sex. That is Viacom.
(>avin from Bush once said in one of
those middle school anthems of his:
"There's no sex in your violence." Is sex
what's missing, here? Probably not.
Good sex — now, that's a serious possi
bility. Anyone can put on Coldplay and
convulse around a dark room in Sigma
Gii fora couple minutes with a doe-eyed
blonde from Paly High. But the good
stuff, the great stuff...
Lots of bad music sells the act of sex.
The penis being inserted into the vagina.
Britney, for example, sells the mechanics
necessary to brace oneself against the
headboard, to dig nails, grind hips, bite
lips, finger-tip-touch, make moist, make
hard, make moan. It's great and will
probably keep the masses coming...
back for more, but, as is so oft remarked:
It has no soul. And what is sex without the
soul? That's right: Fucking.
Whether your own moral code leads
you to the alley or the matrimonial bed
room, everyone knows that there is a dif
ference between this — the act, the er
gonomic primal act of fucking—and
meaningful sex with someone with
whom you've found more than a mutual
enthusiasm for breathing. This latter ver
sion — this connected version — is one
of the best things that ever happened to
us humans, besides music. Where would
we be without music? Hell. Where would
we be without sex? Well, nowhere.
Ah, but more than that, without good
sex we would never find ourselves trans
ported to the intoxicating natural high
that comes with translating the beauty of
an emotion into the intensely beautiful
physical manifestation of that emotion.
We've been raised with a lot of scare
scare when it comes to sex. And scary
might be a good way to describe sex if
you're going to do it like Viacom does
it: with vacant eyes, calculated commer
cial pelvic thrusts, and with about as
much sincere feeling as OJ. giving a
televised update on his search for"the
real killer." But done right, with the
right person, in the right circumstances.

.. in circumstances that matter — that is
when it blows your mind. That is when
it hits all of your senses in shockwaves,
swirling around you in stereo.
Led Zeppelin did it right. There, I
said it. Robert Plant never gave you
the impression that he'd be gone in the
morning, leaving you with nothing but
a headache and the vague recollection
of tequila-flavored underwear. Plant
tells you to "squeeze his lemon, 'til the
juice run down [his] thigh" and you
think maybe you should, regardless of
pre-conceived notions of heterosexu
ality. Britney tells you to "hit [her]
baby one more time" and I'll be god
damned if you don't seriously consider
reaching back and giving her a solid
Ike Turner.
Or maybe you really do want to "hit
her" — in the Biblical sense. And that's
something different. Britney appeals
because she is uncommonly busty
bronzed and seems ready to get nasty at
the drop of a Von Dutch hat. But that's
it, right? That's where it stops: You
want to have sex with Britney because
she's Britney, likebeing famous for
being famous... WTF, mate?
With Plant, the appeal has less to do
with the tight pants than it does with the
freight-train disaster of emotional power
that he puts into every note he sings. Zep
wants to make sonic love to you
while you get lost in the depths of
your headphones. Most bad music
would rather rabbit-hump you in the
ear, youknowwhatlmean?
And that good, blissfully tearful sex is
not relegated to rock 'n' roll. Lord no —
take Norah Jones, for example. Ever had
a talent crush? I have. Listen to a Norah
Jones album and you will experience an
attraction that is separate from the looks
and the talk that go along with standard
bar room attraction. You breathe in
deeply from your ears and find the soft
ness and the excitement and, more than
anything, the substance — whatever it
may be-behind the audio-sexual odyssey
aiming in over your speakers.
You've fallen in love with an audible
idea. You are not attracted, you are trans
ported— you have fallen in love (and
would probably make some, too) with
this living incarnation of music so good.

you're going to do it like Viacom does
it: with vacant eyes, calculated commer
cial pelvic thrusts, and with about as
much sincere feeling as OJ. giving a
televised update on his search for"the
real killer." But done right, with the
right person, in the right circumstances.

.. in circumstances that matter — that is
when it blows your mind. That is when
it hits all of your senses in shockwaves,
swirling around you in stereo.
Led Zeppelin did it right. There, I
said it. Robert Plant never gave you
the impression that he'd be gone in the
morning, leaving you with nothing but
a headache and the vague recollection
of tequila-flavored underwear. Plant
tells you to "squeeze his lemon, 'til the
juice run down [his] thigh" and you
think maybe you should, regardless of
pre-conceived notions of heterosexu
ality. Britney tells you to "hit [her]
baby one more time" and I'll be god
damned if you don't seriously consider
reaching back and giving her a solid
Ike Turner.
Or maybe you really do want to "hit
her" — in the Biblical sense. And that's
something different. Britney appeals
because she is uncommonly busty
bronzed and seems ready to get nasty at
the drop of a Von Dutch hat. But that's
it, right? That's where it stops: You
want to have sex with Britney because
she's Britney, likebeing famous for
being famous... WTF, mate?
With Plant, the appeal has less to do
with the tight pants than it does with the
freight-train disaster of emotional power
that he puts into every note he sings. Zep
wants to make sonic love to you
while you get lost in the depths of
your headphones. Most bad music
would rather rabbit-hump you in the
ear, youknowwhatlmean?
And that good, blissfully tearful sex is
not relegated to rock 'n' roll. Lord no —
take Norah Jones, for example. Ever had
a talent crush? I have. Listen to a Norah
Jones album and you will experience an
attraction that is separate from the looks
and the talk that go along with standard
bar room attraction. You breathe in
deeply from your ears and find the soft
ness and the excitement and, more than
anything, the substance — whatever it
may be-behind the audio-sexual odyssey
aiming in over your speakers.
You've fallen in love with an audible
idea. You are not attracted, you are trans
ported— you have fallen in love (and
would probably make some, too) with
this living incarnation of music so good.

It has been a very long year. Justin
got back at Britney, Britney kissed
Madonna, Ben left Jennifer. Christina

discovered assless chaps, Janet discov
ered the value of mammary celebrity,
and Creed continued to make the worst
music ever. Ludacris and Maroon 5 were
martyred by the FCC, cell phone afi
cionado Paris Hilton got martyred in the
homemade kind of way. In the end,
women still want to have sex with Carson

I )aly and no one knows why.
I know it's trendy to hate on pop cul
ture. Indy snobs often find themselves in
the paradoxical position of having to im
merse themselves in the Top-40 in order
to have the authority to trash it and then
later claim the superiority of Modest
Mouse. There is safety in touting the clas
sics over the modem day just as there is
safety in touting indy bands over main
stream ones: You sound cooler, more cul
tured, educated-er. And you know, I'm
about to do the same thing... but not
blindly. Not by definition. If you're

going to talk about music, you're even
tually going to talk about sex. And if
you're going to talk about sex in music,
don't talk to me about the "Toxic"
video, T.A.T.U. or Tommy Lee. That
is not sex. That is Viacom.
(>avin from Bush once said in one of
those middle school anthems of his:
"There's no sex in your violence." Is sex
what's missing, here? Probably not.
Good sex — now, that's a serious possi
bility. Anyone can put on Coldplay and
convulse around a dark room in Sigma
Gii fora couple minutes with a doe-eyed
blonde from Paly High. But the good
stuff, the great stuff...
Lots of bad music sells the act of sex.
The penis being inserted into the vagina.
Britney, for example, sells the mechanics
necessary to brace oneself against the
headboard, to dig nails, grind hips, bite
lips, finger-tip-touch, make moist, make
hard, make moan. It's great and will
probably keep the masses coming...
back for more, but, as is so oft remarked:
It has no soul. And what is sex without the
soul? That's right: Fucking.
Whether your own moral code leads
you to the alley or the matrimonial bed
room, everyone knows that there is a dif
ference between this — the act, the er
gonomic primal act of fucking—and
meaningful sex with someone with
whom you've found more than a mutual
enthusiasm for breathing. This latter ver
sion — this connected version — is one
of the best things that ever happened to
us humans, besides music. Where would
we be without music? Hell. Where would
we be without sex? Well, nowhere.
Ah, but more than that, without good
sex we would never find ourselves trans
ported to the intoxicating natural high
that comes with translating the beauty of
an emotion into the intensely beautiful
physical manifestation of that emotion.
We've been raised with a lot of scare
