# Cooking for the hook-up
## 
### MATT YAZZIE CALVIN CHIN INTERMISSION CHEFS 
Forgoing all the whipped cream, chocolate, and ed
ible underwear thoughts going through your perverted
little mind, I dare you to remember the last time your
significant other cooked for you. "Dammit," you say,
"You just combined the two most precious commodi
ties at Stanford: a relationship and someone who can
cook." In fact I was told, "The last thing you want to do
is deceive the pro fros into thinking that couples cook
for each other at Stanford or that couples actually exist
at Stanford."
Fret not, barring all creepy and anti-social tenden
cies, having the ability to cook makes one hot. Not only
does it show your significant (or potential significant)
other how much you care, but it'll make others want
you even more. John Bravman does it every Thanks
giving for those FroSoCo kids and they seem to love it,
so why not do it for your date (or potential date). Invite
that special someone over fora no strings attached din
ner because "I loove to cook." Impress him I her
enough and you may get more than just a goodnight
hug.
Don't think you can do it? Executive Chef "Calvin"
and Sous Chef "Matt" took three different couples,
three different recipes and three different cooking
abilities to prove that yes, in fact, you can.
Couple 1: Miranda and Joel
Status: Serious relationship, 2 years
Chef: Joel
Experience: 2 Stars
Cooking History: Lots of pasta with different types of
sauces
Dish: Mixed green salad with citrus vinegarette, egg
plant parmesan, chocolate covered strawberries
Cost: $23.56 Time: 90 minutes
Joel chose this dish because his girlfriend wasn't a
very big fan of the cream sauces. Also, Miranda tends
to eat a lot of vinegarettes, so he decided that this salad
would be the safest option. Immediately, we pegged
Miranda as a very picky little bitch. Boy, is she lucky
to have Joel.
As our only heterosexual Caucasian couple, Joel
and Miranda performed pretty much just how we
thought, following every recipe almost exactly as writ
ten. Joel performed very well in the kitchen needing
help only with the location of several cooking utensils
and pans. He was very careful about making sure that
not one piece of food went to waste, and for that, we
applaud him. While he was cooking, we found out that
Miranda did have her redeeming qualities, "She does
cook great breakfasts! And one time, when I was
cooking fish for her at Mirrielees, I cooked and burnt
the fish in an old frying pan. The fish was sheathed in
black stuff and she still ate it. And she said it was
great."
Feeling the dressing might be too oily, Joel impro
vised by decreasing the amount of olive oil by half. He
also did not add the shortening to the chocolate when
making the chocolate covered strawberries. However,
presentation of the meal seemed rather basic and or
dinary. Sous Chef "Matt" thought the strawberries
could have been dipped a little better and perhaps a
garnish could have been used on the salad, but the
eggplant looked great. Miranda was indifferent and
seemed pleased. She was a little frustrated that her
strawberries stuck to the serving plate, saying, "It
would have been nice to detach it first." She also felt
the dressing was a bit too onion-y for her tastes. Plus,
she commented that it "would have been nice if timing
[of when I was served] was better." Pesky little bitch.

Couple 2: Natalie and Marcus
Status: Serious relationship, 1 year. 10 months
Chef. Natalie
Experience: 1 Star
Cooking History: Lamb chops, Japanese noodles, spaghetti
Dish: Caesar salad, linguini with white clam sauce, cr&me brulee
Cost: $18.45 Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
Natalie has lived in "regular" dorms for most of her time at Stanford
and has had very little time to cook. One of her goals is to hone her cook
ing skills, but she just needs some time, encouragement, and a little train
ing. She immediately won our hearts when she chose all three of the most
difficult dishes to cook for Marcus because "they are all his favorites and
I know he will like them." Go Natalie!
Natalie begins with the Caesar salad, individually hand cleaning each
leaf. We decide to give her a non-raw egg recipe for the Caesar dressing
to avoid any health concerns. Natalie manages her way around the
kitchen very easily needing very little supervision. After telling her that
measurements are entirely up to her and her boyfriend's tastes, she starts
to take creative control in the dressing recipe.
First, she decreases the number anchovies in half and, second, she adds
more mustard to taste. As she is preparing the clams for the sauce, we are
told of Marcus's cooking experience, "He actually taught a cooking class
at Stanford." impressed we were, until she said, "but he's only cooked for
me two or three times." We think we officially hate him.
For dessert, we pre-prepared the creme brulee because of the long
cooking and setting time (3 hours.). However, Natalie caramelized the
sugar creating a picture perfect crust. Both chefs applauded the excellent
presentation of the clams, salad and dessert. Perhaps less generous serv
ings would have been appropriate, but otherwise everything was perfect.
And now we wait for Marcus to arrive ... we wait... we wait... 10 min
utes ... 20 minutes. Finally, a phone call! Forty minutes later, Marcus ar
rives to a very cold plate of linguini. We now officially hate him. Natalie is
a little disappointed and disturbingly forgives him. But even more dis
turbing are Marcus's final departing words, "Dang, that cook is hot! Almost
as tasty as the food she makes!" We hope that was figuratively speaking.
Couple 3: Ryan and Jacob
Status: Serious relationship, 3 months
Chef: Ryan
Experience: 4 stars
Cooking History: Fancy appetizers, Alaska king crab, NY strip steaks
Dish: Mixed green salad with honey-mustard dressing, creamy chicken
with linguini, peach cobbler
Cost: $24.85 Time: 1 hour, 20 minutes
Ryan had such promise. Aside from any gay cooking stereotypes, his
cooking history read like that of an even fancier University Dining Ser
vices chef. However, as the last couple to join, Ryan was left with the
"leftover" recipes and unfortunately Jacob was literally left with the "left
overs" from the other meals.
Ryan began by preparing the chicken, carefully browning each side
and ensuring it was completely cooked. Poultry can be particularly diffi
cult to cook, especially with all the salmonella. He was very careful in pre
venting cross-contamination of utensils and cutting surfaces by rinsing
and washing everything. But, it's all downhill from there. The cheese
sauce unfortunately met its end due to an overcooking problem. Most of
the cheese in the sauce had not completely melted, as it was not fre
quently stirred or watched. Jacob commented during the meal that "the
chicken is cooked very well" but he didn't seem too excited about any
thing else.
The salad was in fact the best item on the menu. We must admit our
fear when Ryan discarded our recipe to create his own version of honey
mustard Dressing, but in fact it was absolutely great! We have included
his recipe as opposed to ours. Jacob ended up adding the chicken pieces
to his salad to create his own awesome dish. Unfortunately, Jacob did not

have Ryan's dessert because it was not completely cooked through
when served. The peach cobbler should be cooked until the edges
have formed a golden brown crust. Do not try to serve this dessert
while the crust is still runny and pale white. Ryan, this means it isn't
done. However, Natalie was kind enough to give Jacob one creme
brulee for his dessert.

/' All in all, everything
/' turned out great. Remember, \
/'it's not how great of a meal you can \
/ make, but the thought and effort. Try \
/ a few of these recipes and impress that \
; special someone in your life. Dispel the ;
j myths, cook and date. As your skills in- j
\ crease, throw several cocktail parties with i
\ killer appetizers and you'll have more j
\ guys / girls hitting on you than stu- /
\ dents signing up for ASSUre- /

Forgoing all the whipped cream, chocolate, and ed
ible underwear thoughts going through your perverted
little mind, I dare you to remember the last time your
significant other cooked for you. "Dammit," you say,
"You just combined the two most precious commodi
ties at Stanford: a relationship and someone who can
cook." In fact I was told, "The last thing you want to do
is deceive the pro fros into thinking that couples cook
for each other at Stanford or that couples actually exist
at Stanford."
Fret not, barring all creepy and anti-social tenden
cies, having the ability to cook makes one hot. Not only
does it show your significant (or potential significant)
other how much you care, but it'll make others want
you even more. John Bravman does it every Thanks
giving for those FroSoCo kids and they seem to love it,
so why not do it for your date (or potential date). Invite
that special someone over fora no strings attached din
ner because "I loove to cook." Impress him I her
enough and you may get more than just a goodnight
hug.
Don't think you can do it? Executive Chef "Calvin"
and Sous Chef "Matt" took three different couples,
three different recipes and three different cooking
abilities to prove that yes, in fact, you can.
Couple 1: Miranda and Joel
Status: Serious relationship, 2 years
Chef: Joel
Experience: 2 Stars
Cooking History: Lots of pasta with different types of
sauces
Dish: Mixed green salad with citrus vinegarette, egg
plant parmesan, chocolate covered strawberries
Cost: $23.56 Time: 90 minutes
Joel chose this dish because his girlfriend wasn't a
very big fan of the cream sauces. Also, Miranda tends
to eat a lot of vinegarettes, so he decided that this salad
would be the safest option. Immediately, we pegged
Miranda as a very picky little bitch. Boy, is she lucky
to have Joel.
As our only heterosexual Caucasian couple, Joel
and Miranda performed pretty much just how we
thought, following every recipe almost exactly as writ
ten. Joel performed very well in the kitchen needing
help only with the location of several cooking utensils
and pans. He was very careful about making sure that
not one piece of food went to waste, and for that, we
applaud him. While he was cooking, we found out that
Miranda did have her redeeming qualities, "She does
cook great breakfasts! And one time, when I was
cooking fish for her at Mirrielees, I cooked and burnt
the fish in an old frying pan. The fish was sheathed in
black stuff and she still ate it. And she said it was
great."
Feeling the dressing might be too oily, Joel impro
vised by decreasing the amount of olive oil by half. He
also did not add the shortening to the chocolate when
making the chocolate covered strawberries. However,
presentation of the meal seemed rather basic and or
dinary. Sous Chef "Matt" thought the strawberries
could have been dipped a little better and perhaps a
garnish could have been used on the salad, but the
eggplant looked great. Miranda was indifferent and
seemed pleased. She was a little frustrated that her
strawberries stuck to the serving plate, saying, "It
would have been nice to detach it first." She also felt
the dressing was a bit too onion-y for her tastes. Plus,
she commented that it "would have been nice if timing
[of when I was served] was better." Pesky little bitch.

Couple 2: Natalie and Marcus
Status: Serious relationship, 1 year. 10 months
Chef. Natalie
Experience: 1 Star
Cooking History: Lamb chops, Japanese noodles, spaghetti
Dish: Caesar salad, linguini with white clam sauce, cr&me brulee
Cost: $18.45 Time: 1 hour, 15 minutes
Natalie has lived in "regular" dorms for most of her time at Stanford
and has had very little time to cook. One of her goals is to hone her cook
ing skills, but she just needs some time, encouragement, and a little train
ing. She immediately won our hearts when she chose all three of the most
difficult dishes to cook for Marcus because "they are all his favorites and
I know he will like them." Go Natalie!
Natalie begins with the Caesar salad, individually hand cleaning each
leaf. We decide to give her a non-raw egg recipe for the Caesar dressing
to avoid any health concerns. Natalie manages her way around the
kitchen very easily needing very little supervision. After telling her that
measurements are entirely up to her and her boyfriend's tastes, she starts
to take creative control in the dressing recipe.
First, she decreases the number anchovies in half and, second, she adds
more mustard to taste. As she is preparing the clams for the sauce, we are
told of Marcus's cooking experience, "He actually taught a cooking class
at Stanford." impressed we were, until she said, "but he's only cooked for
me two or three times." We think we officially hate him.
For dessert, we pre-prepared the creme brulee because of the long
cooking and setting time (3 hours.). However, Natalie caramelized the
sugar creating a picture perfect crust. Both chefs applauded the excellent
presentation of the clams, salad and dessert. Perhaps less generous serv
ings would have been appropriate, but otherwise everything was perfect.
And now we wait for Marcus to arrive ... we wait... we wait... 10 min
utes ... 20 minutes. Finally, a phone call! Forty minutes later, Marcus ar
rives to a very cold plate of linguini. We now officially hate him. Natalie is
a little disappointed and disturbingly forgives him. But even more dis
turbing are Marcus's final departing words, "Dang, that cook is hot! Almost
as tasty as the food she makes!" We hope that was figuratively speaking.
Couple 3: Ryan and Jacob
Status: Serious relationship, 3 months
Chef: Ryan
Experience: 4 stars
Cooking History: Fancy appetizers, Alaska king crab, NY strip steaks
Dish: Mixed green salad with honey-mustard dressing, creamy chicken
with linguini, peach cobbler
Cost: $24.85 Time: 1 hour, 20 minutes
Ryan had such promise. Aside from any gay cooking stereotypes, his
cooking history read like that of an even fancier University Dining Ser
vices chef. However, as the last couple to join, Ryan was left with the
"leftover" recipes and unfortunately Jacob was literally left with the "left
overs" from the other meals.
Ryan began by preparing the chicken, carefully browning each side
and ensuring it was completely cooked. Poultry can be particularly diffi
cult to cook, especially with all the salmonella. He was very careful in pre
venting cross-contamination of utensils and cutting surfaces by rinsing
and washing everything. But, it's all downhill from there. The cheese
sauce unfortunately met its end due to an overcooking problem. Most of
the cheese in the sauce had not completely melted, as it was not fre
quently stirred or watched. Jacob commented during the meal that "the
chicken is cooked very well" but he didn't seem too excited about any
thing else.
The salad was in fact the best item on the menu. We must admit our
fear when Ryan discarded our recipe to create his own version of honey
mustard Dressing, but in fact it was absolutely great! We have included
his recipe as opposed to ours. Jacob ended up adding the chicken pieces
to his salad to create his own awesome dish. Unfortunately, Jacob did not

have Ryan's dessert because it was not completely cooked through
when served. The peach cobbler should be cooked until the edges
have formed a golden brown crust. Do not try to serve this dessert
while the crust is still runny and pale white. Ryan, this means it isn't
done. However, Natalie was kind enough to give Jacob one creme
brulee for his dessert.

/' All in all, everything
/' turned out great. Remember, \
/'it's not how great of a meal you can \
/ make, but the thought and effort. Try \
/ a few of these recipes and impress that \
; special someone in your life. Dispel the ;
