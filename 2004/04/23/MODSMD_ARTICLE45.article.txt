# Stanford boys' dorkiness knocks Roxy's socks off
## 
### ROXY SASS SEX GODDESS 
What would you do if a troupe of
porn stars showed up at your dorm
and asked you to perform with them
as part of their newest film? At Ari
zona State, a dozen or so frat boys
jumped at the chance, earning the ire
of campus administrators for their ap
pearance in "Shane's World #29: Frat
Row Scavenger Hunt 3."
The dean certainly won't have to
worry about a "Shane's World" crew
roving campus. However, for stu

dents, especially you freshmen, the
incident is a sore reminder of a
painful fact: At Stanford, getting laid
can be tough. Breathe easy and thank
the gods, though, because Roxy is
here with your first lesson on navigat
ing the sexual Sahara that is the Stan
ford campus.
The most important thing to real
ize right now is that neither male nor
female porn stars are showing up in
your dorm's lounge anytime soon.
Sex comes a bit more difficult
than that for Stanford students. Dur
ing the first weeks of school, some of

your new dormmates will try to re
gale you with stories about how cool
they were in high school. When this
happens, remember what Public
Enemy's Flava Flav said: "Don't be
lieve the hype!"
Let's face it. None of us here are
cool. Those "hip" kids down the
hall? They spent their weekends
taking classical piano lessons, and
you spent yours either at debate
tournaments or tutoring underprivi
leged children. Learn to embrace
your true self. Confidence in who
you are and what you have is very

sexy; insecurity is the quickest path
to four long years of swollen wrists
and a semen-soaked, short-circuited
keyboard. Understanding that you
are not cool will help you get laid
that much quicker.
How can this be, you ask? Well, if
you hope to find yourself swimming
in a beautiful ocean of tits, ass, penis
and vagina, you need to be realistic
about the world you've gotten your
self into. Despite what you've been
told, in some ways Stanford mirrors
the world you came from. That means
that if you're a lady who wants to fuck
or be fucked, you need do relatively
little; merely finding a partner is a
simple task for any enterprising
woman. An adequate partner? Well,
that's the subject of a future Roxy col
umn. Men, on the other hand, have
got some work ahead of themselves.
Men, the vast majority of you are
dorks. Am I repeating myself? Yes,
and that's because I'm trying to get
something across to you. Like in high
school, football, water polo and
basketball players will get far more
attention than you here. Stanford
athletes spend many hours each
week honing their bodies for compe
tition. You, on the other hand, go to
Tresidder Fitness on Wednesdays.
Worse yet, the athletes here are not
the blockheads you knew from high
school. Women fawn at the sight of
them in their nylon Stanford-embroi
dered get-ups.
Deep down, many Stanford
women want to relive that dream of
dating the popular school star. They
search for Stanford's own version of
A.C. Slater, if you will. Naturally,
they imagine themselves as Bayside
High's Kelly, hanging faithfully on his
arm. Or was that Jessie? Never mind.
Hell, even Roxy's got her own fanta
sy about A.C. in a chantilly lace sin
glet teaching yours truly a few
wrestling moves. Anyone game for
the corkscrew moonsault or the goril
la press?
The point is that you have an ob
stacle ahead of yourself. But do not
despair. Remember that for every
well-toned dreamboat, there is a
small platoon of men like you —
dick-in-hand, waiting in line fora few
minutes of attention.
So what's a young, bright campus

virgin to do? Leverage your assets. If
played correctly, sincere dorkiness is
a turn-on for some women. Look
around, and you'll see some of the
most beautiful women with complete
dorks. Think of yourself as Eddie
Murphy in "The Nutty Professor" or
Adam Sandler in "Billy Madison."
Alternatively, you could start
drinking and hanging out with girls
who do the same. Most of them never
did this in high school and will think
you're cool if you drink with them —
even though you're not.
And whether you're a guy or girl,
if you've got a nearby high school
sweetheart, tap that ass for all it's
worth. But don't tell your friends it's
a high school sweetheart. Tell them
he or she just lives on the other side of
campus. After all, it looks cool to be
nailing someone after just a week at
school — something that will un
doubtedly aid you in your future sex
ual quests.

Editor's note: These sexual gems
were originally published on Sept. 27,
2002. Since then, Dean Marc Wais
has left The Farm and Seth Cohen
from "The O.C." has shown that
freaks can get freaky too — at least
on TV. Everyday experience has
taught your Intermission editors that
in real life the sexual egalitarianism of
Ms. Sass is about as rare as a female
orgasm at Sigma Chi.

kept her out of Stanford.
