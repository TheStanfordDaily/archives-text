## Princeton cuts grade inflation with 'A' quota 
### JULIE LEIN STAFF WRITER 
A persisting concern about grade inflation led Princeton Univer
sity to consider placing a quota on A's in a policy announced earlier
this month. Though similar concerns persist at Stanford — which has
shown some of the same grade inflation trends — no immediate pol
icy changes are planned on the Farm.
Currently, 46 percent of grades at Princeton are A's, but the new
plan would mandate that only 35 percent of grades in an undergrad
uate course could be A- or above.
The Princeton grading quota could potentially set a precedent for
future Stanford policies — the policy was announced in light of na
tion-wide grade inflation, which Stanford has not been immune to.
"Grade inflation has been a problem at Stanford for 35 years," said
Prof. Coit Blacker, director of the Institute for International Studies.
"However, it's not a growing problem, and I do think the situation is
better today than it was 25 years ago."
According to national surveys, the mean college GPA has been
steadily increasing in the past few decades at both public and private
schools. A survey conducted by Princeton in 2003 found that A's ac
counted for 44 to 55 percent of all grades at the eight Ivy League
schools, Stanford, MIT and the University of Chicago. A Duke Uni
versity study released last year found the average GPA at Stanford to
have risen from 3.04 in 1968 to 3.44 in 1992, the last year the re
searcher could obtain data.
Like many other higher tier institutions, Princeton officials had
previously grappled with grade inflation through voluntary means,
such as having professors record the number of A's and giving records
of department and university averages for professors to compare with
their grading.
According to Prof. David Brady, director of the Public Policy pro
gram, the problem of grade inflation cannot be dealt with by individ
ual faculty.
"There's an externality," Brady said. "Unless there's a central way
to control for grade inflation and enforce a curve, no one will do it.
Otherwise, you [the professor] will pay a price for having a standard."
In a cover letter accompanying the proposed changes, Princeton
Undergraduate Dean Nancy Malkiel said that the recommendations
are a result of insistence by department chairs and students that dif
ferent departments set consistent expectations. She also relayed her
hope that Princeton could potentially serve as a leader to peer insti
tutions that have faced similar problems.
Some Stanford students and professors worry that continued
grade inflation has caused companies to focus less on GPA due to the
homogeneity of grades among college students. Others believe high
er grades are a reward for the caliber of the student body.
"I think it's a hard problem to deal with because the competition
at Stanford and similar institutions is so intense," said sophomore
Ratul Narain. "Since we have to work incredibly hard in order to do
match our classmates, it seems only natural that we should be re
warded with a higher curve."
Princeton is set to reevaluate the proposal on April 26 after dis
cussing the changes with the student body.
