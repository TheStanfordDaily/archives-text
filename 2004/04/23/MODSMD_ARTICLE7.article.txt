# Fund. Standard violations climb
## 
### MELISSA FUSCO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last quarter's report on cheating and Fundamental Stan
dard violations showed a sharp jump in alcohol-related cases,
which Judicial Affairs Program Coordinator George Wilson
credited to a stricter University stance toward alcohol.
The quarterly report, released last month noted a total of 30
cases in winter quarter, including 12 relating to Honor Code vi
olations and 18 involving the University's Fundamental Stan
dard. In all 30 cases eventually heard by judicial panels, stu
dents were found responsible for the violations.
The statistics are up from autumn quarter, when Judicial Af
fairs reported a total of 18 cases. Most striking was the rise in
Fundamental Standard violations, which spiked from one case
in the fall to 18 in the winter. Though Wilson did not note this,
these statistics could have easily been skewed by a few cases,
such as the incidents involving Delta Delta Delta, in which nine
students were involved.
During winter quarter, driving under the influence (DUI) of
alcohol accounted for seven of the 18
Fundamental Standard violations. In
the past year. 19 of the 37 Fundamen
tal Standard violations were DUIs.
Some students expressed ambiva
lence toward the new focus on alcohol.
"I'm not really current on Stanford's
policies, but I think more rules tend to be
a bad thing," said sophomore Nik Sawe.
In addition to the seven DUI cases,
last quarter's Fundamental Standard
figures include nine alcohol policy vi
olations, one case of disruptive be
havior, one case of forgery and mis
representation and four cases related
to hazing.
The rise in the number of Funda
mental Standard violations "is really
striking for our office," Wilson said.
"From years before, it's more like
two-thirds honor code and one-third
Fundamental Standard violations,"
Wilson explained, calling the in
crease in violations "a definite cause
for concern."
Recent statistics from the Judicial
Affairs Web site reflect a downward
or neutral trend in the number of
Honor Code violations, as there have
been just 32 Honor Code cases over
this year's first two quarters, while
there were % last year.
Four of winter quarter's 12 report
ed Honor Code cases came from the

Computer Science Department.
Other departments included Com
munication, with two cases, Biology,
Chemistry and I-Hum, each with one
case. In the fall, Computer Science
accounted for 12 out of 17 cases that
made it to the Judicial Panel.
"Typically, spring quarter is the
busiest quarter," Wilson noted.
Annual statistics include figures
from summer quarters as well.
"1 think that the regulations that
define [honor code] violations are
wide enough that a lot of things that
happen on campus qualify," said
sophomore Miri Hutcherson.
"Whether that's a good thing, 1
don't know."
Hutcherson added that students might
see rules against collaboration as detract
ing from the intellectual environment
they share with their fellow students.
"I'm tempted to give people more
freedom rather than less," she said.
"Considering the way classes are
set up, there's every incentive to
cheat," added Yogesh Raut, a junior.
"Your entire grade depends on
maybe two tests, which are often mul
tiple choice, so that missing even a
few hurts your grade a lot. You can
study the material for hours and still
miss the little tidbit that gets asked
about."
However, Raut expressed approval
of the University's policy regarding
collaborative work.
"A lot of collaboration occurs de
spite the rules that are in place," he said.
"It isn't cheating, and no one con
siders it as such. The system works."
