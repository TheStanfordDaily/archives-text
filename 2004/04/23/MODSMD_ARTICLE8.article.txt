# ASSU race heats up with new candidates
## Lee drops Mefford, picks up Schwartz 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Mikey Lee and Alyssa Schwartz
announced yesterday that they
would be running together in the
ASSU Special Election for the exec
utive office. They are one of several
slates that plan on running for the po
sition after the Undergraduate Sen
ate voted on Tuesday not to certify
the results of the original election.
Lee, a senior, ran with junior
Dylan Mefford in the first election,
while Schwartz, a sophomore, ran
with junior Ajani Husbands.
According to Lee and Schwartz,
the two met with Mefford yesterday
morning and came to the conclusion
that it would be "best for the ASSU"
if Lee and Schwartz ran together.
Husbands and Schwartz previ
ously announced last Tuesday that
they would not be running together
again. Schwartz said she decided to

run with Lee in order to avoid the
potential negative consequences of
repeating the last election.
"If it was the same election again,
it would be much messier," Schwartz
said. "If I were running with Ajani
again, we would use tactics that were

much more extreme."
She said that while
she is looking forward to
working with Lee, she is
not excited about cam
paigning again.
Lee said that he and
Schwartz complement
ed each other well as
running mates in terms
of their perspectives and
experience.
"We'll have the valu
able insider and outsider
perspective that the
ASSU needs," Lee said.
"I'll bring the feistiness
and energy as well as the
experience of working

extensively with the administration
to get things done. Alyssa will bring
the experience of having worked
with many different communities
and groups, and two years of ASSU
experience."
Mefford said that he would wait
and see the other slates before en

dorsing Lee and Schwartz.
"Based on my experience work
ing with Mikey, I would support
him," Mefford said. "I like Alyssa,
and I respect and admire her work
on advocacy."
He said, however, that he would
miss campaigning.

"Campaigning is one of the best ways
in which incoming ASSU leaders can
reach out," Mefford said. "I love that
process; I love meeting people."
During a Special Elections infor
mation meeting last night, ASSU
Elections Assistant Commissioner
Alida Garcia, a junior, told the can

didates that this time around, the
Commission would be stricter on the
deadlines and rules, and would not
hesitate to disqualify a slate.
"Take it very, very seriously,"
Garcia told the candidates. "If you
have any questions, ask us before
you act."
However, ASSU Elections
Commissioner Ellie Martin, a ju
nior, said that she was dismayed to
find at the meeting that some slates
seemed to be treating the election
as a joke. Martin also said during
the meeting that the shortened
elections period was intentional,
because it would be efficient and
allow just enough time for candi
dates to campaign.
"Since it's a short time period, it
shouldn't be too complicated," Mar
tin said. "Hopefully students will be
satisfied with having more choices,
and they'll get the representation
they want."
Martin and Garcia warned the
prospective candidates that the posi
tions of ASSU president and vice
president required a great deal of
work and time.
Current ASSU Vice President
Joey Natoli, a junior, was present at

New candidates and ASSU officials cast their lots in the ASSU Special Election. Many slates are planning on filing letters of intent by the deadline tomorrow at noon,
including a new slate with one candidate from each of the top two slates in the last election.
