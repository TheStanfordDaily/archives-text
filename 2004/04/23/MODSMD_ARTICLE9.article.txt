# Earth fair exhibits diverse groups

### JEFF ERFE 
Environmentalism on campus is
both waning and waxing, as this year's
lightly promoted Earth Day fair demon
strated, according to participants.
The Students fora Sustainable
Stanford organized yesterday's fair,
hoping to unify most of the campus
environmental groups in one culmi
nating Earth Week event and to make
a splash for Admit Weekend.
But many organizers and atten
dees noted that the myriad organiza
tions at the fair seemed splintered
from within. Several previously active
organizations such as Environmental
Justice and the Redwood Action
Team have become less visible to
other activists this year and did not
sponsor booths at the Earth Day fair.
Freshman Emmett Hopkins, of
Students fora Sustainable Stanford,
noted that the system of dormitories'
environmental representatives, for ex
ample, have all but dissolved this year.
Junior Jenny Tolan attended the

fair and said that although she felt
"really excited" about Earth Day, she
was upset because she felt that no one
really knew about it until today.
"[lt has received] a lot less atten
tion in the past couple of years,"
Tolan said. "(It seems as if it is] not a
big issue for students these days."
Others said they felt differently.
Dean Eyre, associate programs man
ager for Undergraduate Research
Programs, attended the fair as some
one who has long been interested
and actively involved in environmen
tal issues. He said that the environ
mentally conscious community was
in fact "getting more ingrained into
the structure of the University."
Eyre said that the next step is to
create a dormitory or academic build
ing for the express purpose of educat
ing students on the environment.
He also argued that groups are nei
ther splintered nor inefficient. In
stead, he said that he cherishes the di
versity of these organizations and
their different approaches.

"In so many ways the environment
affects people and people affect the
environment," he said. "There are
many ways to tackle the issue."
That diversity was on display at the
fair, and some organizers and atten
dees said that one advantage of envi
ronmental activism is that students
from all backgrounds and interests
can unite around a common desire —
to protect and safely enjoy the envi
ronment — and work concertedly to
ward that goal.
Engineers fora Sustainable World
(ESW), for example, brings together
engineers and other "techies" com
mitted to working for sustainable de
velopment in the third world.
Currently, the group is working on
erecting a Green Building in
Nicaragua and providing a better sci
ence curriculum in African schools.
"We don't try to impose solu
tions," said ESW member Kristof


The Page Chamberlain Bluegrass Band plays for tfie Earth Day fair yesterday at lunch. The fair was the ajlmination
of a week of environmental activities that marked Earth Week.
