PATRICK MOORE
Outlaw Representation: From the U.S. Navy's confiscation in 1934 of a painting of sailors on shore leave to the ongoing culture wars over fed
eral funding to the arts, conflicts surrounding homosexuality and creative freedom have shaped the history of modern art in America. Richard
Meyer's "Outlaw Representation" illuminates this history through its careful analysis of the works of homosexual artists and the circumstances
under which these works have been attacked, suppressed, or censored outright. Beyond Shame: A talented novelist who for many years was
director of the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS, Moore (This Every Night) offers a provocative defense of gay male sex culture in the 1970s
as well as a jeremiad on the AIDS holocaust of the 1980s. The most exciting writing here details New York's provisional "theaters of pleasure"
(sex cluhs like The Mineshaft, dance clubs such as The Saint) with novelistic atmosphere and a canny ear for interview and synthesis, while
Moore's portraits of artists lost to AIDS are also first-rate.
