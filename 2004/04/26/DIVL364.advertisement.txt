Outlaw Representation and the Abandoned History of Radical Gay Sexuality
Authors Richard Meyer and Patrick Moore will read from their books,
Outlaw Representation: Censorship and
Homosexuality in Twentieth-Century American Art &
Beyond Shame: On the Abandoned History of Radical Gay Sexuality.
Outlaw Representation-. From the U.S. Navy's confiscation in 1934 of a painting of sailors on shore leave to the ongoing culture wars over federal funding to the arts,
conflicts surrounding homosexuality and creative freedom have shaped the history of modern art in America. Richard Meyer's "Outlaw Representation" illuminates
this history through its careful analysis of the works of homosexual artists and the circumstances under which these works have been attacked, suppressed, or censored
outright. Beyond Shame-. A talented novelist who for many years was director of the Estate Project for Artists with AIDS, Moore (This Every Night) offers a provocative
defense of gay male sex culture in the 1970s as well as a jeremiad on the AJDS holocaust of the 1980s. The most exciting writing here details New York's provisional
"theaters of pleasure" (sex clubs like The Mineshaft, dance clubs such as The Saint) with novelistic atmosphere and a canny ear for interview and synthesis, while
Moore's portraits of artists lost to AIDS arc also first-rate.

Einstein Defiant: Genius versus Genius in the
Quantum Revolution by Edmond Blair Bolles
"I find the idea quite intolerable thai an electron exposed to radiation should choose of its own free will, not only its moment to jump off, but also its direction. In that
case, I would rather be a cobbler, or even an employee in a gaming house, than a physicist." -Albert Einstein. A scandal hovers over the history of 20th century physics,
Albert Einstein - the century's greatest physicist - was never able to come to terms with quantum mechanics, the.century's greatest theoretical achievement. For physicists
who routinely use both quantum laws and Einstein's ideas, this contradiction can be almost too embarrassing to dwell on. Yet Einstein was one of the founders of
quantum physics and he spent many years preaching the quantum's importance and its revolutionary nature. The Danish genius Neils Bohr was another founder of
quantum physics. He had managed to solve one of the few physics problems that Einstein ever shied away from, linking quantum mathematics with a new model of
the atom. This leap immediately yielded results that explained electron behavior and the periodic table of the elements. Despite their mutual appreciation of the
quantum's importance, these two giants of modern physics never agreed on the fundamentals of their work. In fact, they clashed repeatedly throughout the 19205,
arguing first over Einstein's theory of "light quanta" (photons), then over Niels Bohr's short-lived theory that denied the conservation of energy at the quantum level,
and climactically over the new quantum mechanics that Bohr enthusiastically embraced and Einstein stubbornly defied. This contest of visions stripped the scientific
imagination naked. Einstein was a staunch realist, demanding to know the physical reasons behind physical events. At odds with this approach was Bohr's more
pragmatic perspective that favored theories that worked, even if he might not have a corresponding explanation of the underlying reality. Powerful and illuminating,
Einstein Defiant is the first book to capture the soul and the science that inspired this dramatic duel, revealing the personalities and the passions - and, in the end, what
was at stake for the world. Edmund Blair Bolles has been hailed as "startlingly eloquent" (The Atlantic Monthly) with "a genius for explanation" (The Spectator), which
explains why he has survived for over thirty years as a freelance writer with a special interest in the meeting point between science and human imagination. Bolles grew
up in Washington, D.C. and Toledo, Ohio with a three-year detour in Paris, France. He was educated in St. Louis and Philadelphia, and spent two years in Tanzania,
East Africa, as a Peace Corps volunteer teaching science, math, and agriculture. Since then he has lived in Washington State, Los Angeles, and New York. His 15 books
include Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing (editor) and The Ice Finders: How a Poet, a Professor, and a Politician Discovered the Ice Age.

All Deliberate Speed: Reflections on the First Half Century
of Brown v. Board of Education by Charles J. Ogletree
On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the doctrine of "separate but equal" was unconstitutional. Charles J. Ogletree, Jr., was not even two
at the time, and his family, farm workers in southern California, had scant knowledge of how keenly the ruling would affect them. In All Deliberate Speed Ogletree
examines the personal ramifications of the decision for him and his family—his childhood in the wake of the Brown decision, his student days at Stanford and
Harvard Law, his immersion in the Boston busing crisis—and its meaning for all Americans. Presenting a vivid pageant of historical characters including Thurgood
Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., Earl Warren, Anita Hill, and Clarence Thomas, Ogletree discusses the ambivalence of our judicial system, the increasing legal
challenges to affirmative action, and the issue of reparations. Informed throughout by brilliant legal insight, All Deliberate Speed compellingly traces the history of
race and integration in American society, and will promote intense debate and reconsideration.
