Have you injured your ACL?
The Stanford Biomotion Laboratory is currently conducting a nationally-funded
study to investigate how knee joint mechanics are affected by ACL injury
WhO can 'Age 18 years or older
... 'No other serious injury to the knee or other conditions that could I
participate : impair your ability to walk.
•MRI of both knees
•Biomechanical evaluation of activities of daily living (i.e., walking,
What is involved jogging, stair-climbing) in the Biomotion Laboratory on campus
in the tPSt? 'Measurements of knee laxity
•Tests of quadriceps and hamstring strength
•All tests are non-invasive, painless, and at no cost to you.
