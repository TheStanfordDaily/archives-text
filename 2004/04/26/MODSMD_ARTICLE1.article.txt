# Bomhack withdraws from ASSU Senate, tie-breaker to follow
## 
### CAMILLE RICKETTS DESK EDITOR 
Two weeks after his election to the ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate, junior Patrick Bomhack declared his resignation, citing sched
uling conflicts and a shortage of time as reasons for his departure. As
one of the key spokespeople for the Great Donation, Bomhack said
he hopes to remain partially involved in the Senate's activities.
The current constitution mandates that any senator who resigns
within 28 days of the election is to be replaced with the runner-up —
the candidate to garner the 16th highest number of votes. This year,
however, freshman Ashley Matheus and sophomore George Hill
are tied at 662 votes.
In an e-mail sent to the members of the Senate, Bomhack wrote,
"During the course of the past three weeks, I have come to the con
clusion that my commitments for next year outweigh my ability to
pursue them."
He added that he is currently applying fora resident advisor po
sition in a freshman dorm and is still deciding whether to participate
in athletics or write an honors thesis. In addition, he said he hopes to
remain vocal for the Great Donation and to potentially help coor
dinate a dance-marathon fundraiser for AIDS research next winter.
"1 am sad because 1 love the ASSU," Bomhack wrote. "There
are many ideas and projects I am frustrated 1 will not be able to pur
sue and there are relationships with all of you 1 will miss out on. This
decision has not come easy."
When asked why he decided to drop the ASSU in lieu of anoth
er activity, Bomhack said. "My most important project would have
been the Great Donation, and I'll be working with the ASSU to a
lesser degree as the administrator of the Great Donation. This will
allow me to do what I care most about while pursuing what I am
most passionate about for next year."
Matheus refrained from comment and Hill could not be reached.
The Senate's vote to determine who will replace Bomhack has not
yet been scheduled. Even so, Bomhack said he had advice for who
ever fills the spot.
"The number one problem with the ASSU is communication be
tween the Senate and the student body," he said. "We need ASSU
newsletters in every bathroom stall on campus. My advice to the
new senator is to get a pair of running shoes and get ready to run
around campus posting fliers."
