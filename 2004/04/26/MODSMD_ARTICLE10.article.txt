### JULIE LYTHCOTT-HAIMS DEAN OF FRESHMAN TRANSFER STUDENTS 
With this weekend's visit of the admitted class and
April's sunshine finally piercing our pores, we know
that spring has at last arrived at Stanford. Freshman
year is a year of transition, and spring quarter arrives
to gently usher in its end. The University's cycle of
renewal and emergence continues, for all of us,
it seems.

In the final quarter of my freshman
year almost two decades ago, I chart
ed my transition by the seasons. The
fall's nervous energy gave way to the
bleak exhaustion of winter and that,
in turn, gave way to the welcome em
brace of spring.
In addition to pushing the fron
tier of my own reasoned under-

standing, what I enjoyed then and
still now about being immersed in university life is this
cyclicality. The rituals, arrivals, departures, sureties
and traditions.
Ready or not, the arrival of new freshmen the follow
ing fall would spur on our own evolution and we would
never again be the people our parents said goodbye to
the previous September.
But in the final quarter of our freshman year, we were
focused not on being sophomores but on reveling in the
gloriousness of spring.
Come spring, I was giddy with delight over a course
on civil rights, in which for the first time at college I
knew I was mastering the material to the point of being
able to teach others. It was exhilarating, and April's
warmth and cloudless sky goaded me on as I dared to
go beyond the syllabus, and daydreamed about the
role I would one day play in solving these intractable
problems.
My classmates and friends were similarly heady, al
though from different perfumes. Some had landed a
meaningful summer internship. A few had already
charted a major. Others were thrilled by the promise of
the looming Draw. Many more were windsurfing on
Lake Lag.
Freshman year, which we'd simultaneously longed to
experience and yet feared, was practically behind us, and
whether our minds were focused on social trivialities or
the weightiness of our entire futures, we did so in the
sublime comfort of finally knowing we were indeed full
fledged members of the Stanford family. We knew not
what the future held, but we knew we belonged to it.
These days, what delights me most in the work that
I do is watching the freshmen be themselves. The
sheer joy they have in being freshmen and doing what
it is that freshmen do is so evident and palpable to the
rest of us, for whom our own freshman year is a care
worn memory.
They seem to have not a care in the world, and they
delight in their own curiosity, self-discovery, play and ca
maraderie, in the purest and most innocent of ways. We
cannot help but smile as we watch.
Were I to live it again, I would do little differently,
save perhaps to urge my younger self to keep a journal.
For now, in watching freshmen make their journey, I
long to have better chronicled my own transition.
And finally, as spring quarter drew to a close, I might
urge the younger me to write a letter to my future self, to
inspire her to honor the imaginings and idealism of her
younger days and to give her the joy of reading and re
reading the voice of a freshman heady with spring.
