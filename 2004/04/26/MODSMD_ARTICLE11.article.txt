## Children of administrators and staff talk about the perks and challenges of being Stanford students 
### MELISSA CHEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Freshman Dan McLennan is just
another Stanford student — that is
until someone reminds him that his fa
ther also happens to be the dean of re
ligious life.
"My dad is teaching a sophomore
college seminar next year and I'm ap
plying for it," McLennan said. "It's
kind of strange because some people
will come and say, 'Oh, I'm applying
for your dad's seminar.' "
McLennan is just one of a handful
of students who are also the children of
faculty or staff at Stanford. Yet being
the son or daughter of faculty or staff
doesn't guarantee a spot at Stanford.
McLennan came across the coun
try — almost 3,000 miles — to at
tend Stanford leaving behind a
place he called home for 13 years of
his education. He spent his senior
year on the East coast as a boarding
school student at Milton Academy
in Massachusetts.
"Growing up in Massachusetts and
then coming to California — I feel like
I'm in a new place," McLennan said.
But first McLennan had to get in
and according Robin Mamlet, dean
of admission and financial aid,
school admission is based on the
same criterion for all students admit
ted to Stanford: demonstrated aca
demic excellence and the potential to
succeed at Stanford.
While the admissions office does
not comment on the specifics of any
sub-group within the applicant pool,
McLennan said that only a slightly
higher percentage of students of facul
ty and staff are admitted to Stanford

and estimated the number to be about
five percent higher.
For McLennan, there are a few
perks that come along with being the
son of the dean of religious life.
"Every once in a while we get invit
ed to different events on campus like
football seats in the box or [I] get to
meet administrators," he said.
"There's [also] about half a dozen pro
fessors who I know pretty well
through my parents."
Sophomore Allison Rose, daugh
ter of Assistant Dean and Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe, also
likes the advantages of having her
mom nearby.
"We're really close, so it's nice to
have her here and get to see her a lot,"
Rose said. "But we also set some
ground rules at the beginning, like
she's not allowed to come over when
ever she wants."
The financial perks for children of
Stanford staff and faculty are no differ
ent than attending any other college.
"Our tuition remains the same for
all students and need-based financial
aid is available to those who qualify,"
Mamlet said. "There's a tuition bene
fit that applies to all employees, facul
ty and staff, and that can be used at
any college the student attends."
The tuition grant program for chil
dren of faculty and staff offers em
ployees an amount that is approxi
mately half of Stanford's tuition. The
maximum benefit for full-time stu
dents for the 2004-2005 school year
will be $14,923.50 per eligible child
for undergraduate education, accord
ing to the guidelines of the tuition
grant program.
This benefit is comparable to other

institutions like Brown University
where a tuition aid program offers em
ployees up to $10,000 per year per eli
gible child for undergraduate tuition.
Some other schools like Boston Col
lege give the students of faculty a free
ride, but only if they attend their insti
tution. At the other end of the spec
trum, Harvard University offers no tu
ition benefits.
"[At Stanford] they give you the
same amount of money no matter
what school you go to," McLennan
said. "Stanford would give my par
ents the same discount if I went to
Harvard, Georgetown or a communi
ty college."
Dan and his brother, senior Will
McLennan both chose Stanford of
their own accord.
"I encouraged [my sons] to pick the
college that they thought was best for
them, whatever it was," said Scotty
McLennan, dean of religious life.
McLennan also wanted his sons to
also consider what it would be like to
attend a school where their father was
dean and who lives on campus. Ap
parently, both sons decided Stanford
was the best choice and Will trans
ferred as a sophomore from North
western, while Dan was admitted
straight out of high school.
"In Will's first quarter, we never
ran into each other by chance on cam
pus," McLennan said. "It's a big place
with plenty of room to live one's own
life. I can count on one hand the times
we've seen each other without plan
ning it over the last three years."
Rose said the close proximity of
Stanford to her home, as opposed to
her mom's position on campus,
made her hesitant about coming

here. But ultimately, she "couldn't
say no to Stanford."
Scotty McLennan said that his sons'
attendance has helped him better un
derstand a student's perspective.
"It's very helpful as the dean of re
ligious life to see the university
through their eyes," McLennan said.
"It's helped enormously in relating to
other parents on occasions like Admit
Weekend, New Student Orientation,
Parents Weekend, etc. Overall, I feel
it's substantially enhanced both my
and their experiences at Stanford."
"I don't go home very often," said
Dan McLennan. "Sometimes I go
home to do my laundry."
Perhaps the biggest feature setting
these students apart is having a parent
just around the corner.
"I think the main difference is ac
cess to my parents if I need them,"
Dan McLennan said. "It's kind of like
being on my own, but living near them
so I can visit them if I need to."
Rose noted that there are some chal
lenges that she must deal with because
her mom is a University administrator.
"Sometimes, people make com
ments if I get a job or get accepted into
something that it's because of her,"
Rose said. "It's kind of annoying, but I
think, or I hope, that it's not true."
Other children of Stanford admin
istrators include sophomore Jon Hen
nessy, son of President John Hen
nessy, sophomore Max Etchemendy,
son of Provost John Etchemendy, ju
nior Chris Bravman, son of Vice
Provost John Bravman and sopho
more Ashlea Graves, niece of Associ
ate Dean of Students Morris Graves.
They did not respond to interview re
quests from The Daily.
