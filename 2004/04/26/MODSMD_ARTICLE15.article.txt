## HOLT'S HARANGUE A 						creative environmental policy 
### 
Since last Thursday was
Earth Day, I thought it
would be appropriate to re
flect on our president's en
vironmental policy. He and Sena
tor John Kerry celebrated the holi
day the politician way: Each com
memorated the day by claiming
that the other has screwed, or will
screw, the earth.
I really don't think Kerry has a leg
to stand on here. Bush seems to have
a great environmental record. On
Thursday, for instance, he an
nounced a plan to create three mil
lion acres of wetlands in the next five
years. That's a lot of trees, frogs and
mosquitoes. If these wetlands he
hopes to create happen to be in
Florida or other swing states, it is
purely a coincidence.
Many critics have pointed to
Christine Todd Whitman's resigna
tion as administrator of the Environ
mental Protection Agency as a sign
that Bush's environmental policy
needs improvement. They could not
be more wrong. Whitman just want
ed to take time off to spend time with
her kids.
Her decision had nothing to do
with the discrepancy between her
role as an environmental protector
and Bush's policies. And to this day,
she continues to support President
Bush's environmental policy while
driving her kids to soccer practice.
Bush has also promoted his
"Clear Skies" project and several tax
credit programs designed to put a lid
on greenhouse gas emissions. Some
may argue that Bush could have
achieved these goals and more by

ratifying the Kyoto Treaty in 2001,
and at the same time set a positive
tone for relations with the 178 other

countries that en
dorsed it.
But that Kyoto
protocol, with its
annoying manda
tory regulations,
would have really
cramped our
style. The U.S. is a
free-spirited gal
who can't be held
down by interna-

tional treaties. Better that we create
our own plan than live under the
yoke of mandates from those foreign
environmental fundamentalists.
And while we're at it, why not do
away with mandatory restrictions al
together? Most of Bush's initiatives
are voluntary, relying on American
companies' long-standing commit
ment to protecting the environment.
Bush's proposal may fall short of
the Kyoto Protocol's target of a 33
percent decrease in emissions, but at
least it's completely American. No
sir, there is no foreign involvement
in our environmental policies.
America has always been a pioneer
in that way.
Bush is proudly upholding that tra
dition, and that's another reason 1 like
his environmental policy.
I also appreciate his push for
drilling in the Alaskan Arctic
Wildlife Refuge. In the 1950s Presi
dent Dwight D. Eisenhower opened
about 95 percent of the state to
drilling, but he left 5 percent as un
touched wilderness.

But that was then; this is now.
Now, we need that 5 percent. The
caribou, musk oxen, polar bears and
geese that inhabit that pristine tun
dra have been getting a free ride for
50 years. It's time they gave back!
Many people have claimed that
drilling there will adversely impact
several species, permanently. But
this is all part of our president's
plan to make the most efficient use
of the land.
The amount of oil in the ground
of the Alaskan Arctic Wildlife
Refuge is minimal. It will take years
to process, and even then it won't be
a complete solution to our nation's
energy problems. The species within
the refuge, however, are an entirely
different matter.
Did you know that a caribou has
the longest hair of any mammal? Did
you know that that hair, along with a
layer of oily fat, keeps it warm in the
cold Alaskan climate? Both the hair
and the fat are useable resources.
Same with the polar bear: It has a
layer of fat perfect for fuel, and its
fur will make a great thank-you gift
to all would-be contributors to Pres
ident Bush's re-election campaign.
Nothing says "thank you" like a nice
warm rug made out of an endan
gered species you helped kill.
As I said, I like Bush's environ
mental policy. It's creative.
