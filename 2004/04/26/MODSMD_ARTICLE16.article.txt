# YANKEES SUCK
## Who's the real liar? 
### 
I am a proud, card-carrying
member of the committee to re
elect Bush-Cheney in 2004.
Granted, in my wildest fantasies
I couldn't dream up a turn of events
that would inspire me to vote Bush-
Cheney in '04. I have no idea why I
was randomly sent a membership
card, though it is now posted in my
room. I threw away the two copies of
the photo of George and Laura.
But I have no intention of telling
the folks at the Bush campaign that
they're wasting their time. Keep it
coming, boys, because I'm proud to
do my small part by letting them
throw away some insignificant
smidgeon of their millions in cam
paign funds on useless mailings to me.
Why does this make me so
proud? Because each time they
spend 13.5 cents on a letter thanking
me for being one of their valuable
grassroots volunteers, they have 13.5
less cents going toward disseminat
ing the misleading bull poop that
makes political guru Karl Rove so
happy he has to change his briefs.
Let's be honest, he's not a boxers
kind of guy.
Case in point: The Bush cam
paign is showing a video essentially
calling John Kerry a liar for saying
he hasn't run negative TV spots.
The video, front and center on
Bush's re-election site, begins with
an unidentified clip of Kerry an
nouncing, "So I'm gonna try and
change the discussion and just tell
the truth to the American people. I
never ran one negative advertise
ment against my opponents in the
primaries. And I haven't run nega
tive advertisements yet."
The commercial then cuts to a
black screen to make its claim that
Kerry has, in fact, run negative ads
about Bush. This is followed by
ominous music and flashes of
Kerry's 21 attack ads. As the Kerry
voice-overs turn into an unintelligi

ble buzz, the commercial replays
the "Tell the truth to the American
people" clip three times and then
rounds it out with Kerry saying,
"And I haven't run negative adver
tisements yet. My advertisements in
this race are positive." Paid for by
Bush-Cheney '04.

Wow. John
Kerry. He must
be a lying scum
bag. What else is
there to say after
seeing that ad?
Clearly, run
ning negative ad
vertisements in
and of itself can't
be the issue. Sur-

rounding the video clip on the Bush
site are the "Kerry Gas Tax Calcula
tor: How much more would he cost
you?" and the "John Kerry Travel
Tracker: See why John Kerry is
wrong for your state."
If you dig around on the site, you
can even find the "Kerry flip-flop of
the day." And the Bush ad itself is a
negative ad. So that's not why you
should Kerry-hate.
You should Kerry-hate because
he's a liar.
The irony of this assertion is
enough to knock me off my chair.
And it has. Several times. Let's back
up the train a bit.
Though you probably didn't no
tice it the first time you saw the ad,
our friend Pinocchio threw a little
caveat in there — he said he didn't
run negative ads against his "oppo
nents in the primaries."
Last time I checked, John Kerry
didn't run against George Bush in
the Democratic primaries. And we
don't even know where this clip came
from; my guess would be a stump
speech during the primary campaign.
So really, based on the advertise
ment, we have no idea what John
Kerry has said about his campaign

strategy toward Bush. 1 would think
that if Kerry had run negative ads
the 25,825 times the Bush commer
cial says he did, the seasoned senator
would be on the ball enough not to
make a patently false, unequivocal
statement. But take it out of context
and yeah, that damn liberal is a
scumbag, all right.
So guess who's actually not telling
the truth to the American people? If
Bush isn't actually lying to them, he's
certainly misleading them, because
it doesn't take a Stanford degree to
pick out the deceptive nature of this
most recent Bush-speak.
What's unfortunate is that this ad
continues a three-year trend (proba
bly a 228-year trend, but we'll be par
tisan here) of shifting political de
bate away from the complexity of
meaningful issues and onto catch
phrases and catty assertions that are
almost always false or useless.
Through the vague use of terms
like "freedom" and "national inter
est" and attack ads that stray not
only from the issues but also from
the truth, the Bush administration
has circumscribed American
rhetoric to the point that nuanced
discussion of policy is impossible.
This disables the country's ability to
not only effectively challenge but
also even choose its governors.
The lesson in all of this is to
take the advice of history majors
(heaven forbid) and be critical of
the reliability of your sources.
That may be a more fruitful strate
gy than holding out until someone
actually changes the discussion
and tells the whole truth to the
American people.

tisan here) of shifting political de
bate away from the complexity of
meaningful issues and onto catch
phrases and catty assertions that are
almost always false or useless.
Through the vague use of terms
like "freedom" and "national inter

only from the issues but also from
the truth, the Bush administration
has circumscribed American
rhetoric to the point that nuanced
discussion of policy is impossible.
This disables the country's ability to
not only effectively challenge but
also even choose its governors.
The lesson in all of this is to
take the advice of history majors
(heaven forbid) and be critical of
the reliability of your sources.
That may be a more fruitful strate
gy than holding out until someone
actually changes the discussion
and tells the whole truth to the
American people.

I am a proud, card-carrying
member of the committee to re
elect Bush-Cheney in 2004.
Granted, in my wildest fantasies
I couldn't dream up a turn of events
that would inspire me to vote Bush-
Cheney in '04. I have no idea why I
was randomly sent a membership
card, though it is now posted in my
room. I threw away the two copies of
the photo of George and Laura.
But I have no intention of telling
the folks at the Bush campaign that
they're wasting their time. Keep it
coming, boys, because I'm proud to
do my small part by letting them
throw away some insignificant
smidgeon of their millions in cam
paign funds on useless mailings to me.
Why does this make me so
proud? Because each time they
spend 13.5 cents on a letter thanking
me for being one of their valuable
grassroots volunteers, they have 13.5
less cents going toward disseminat
ing the misleading bull poop that
makes political guru Karl Rove so
happy he has to change his briefs.
Let's be honest, he's not a boxers
kind of guy.
Case in point: The Bush cam
paign is showing a video essentially
calling John Kerry a liar for saying
he hasn't run negative TV spots.
The video, front and center on
Bush's re-election site, begins with
an unidentified clip of Kerry an
nouncing, "So I'm gonna try and
change the discussion and just tell
the truth to the American people. I
never ran one negative advertise
ment against my opponents in the
primaries. And I haven't run nega
tive advertisements yet."
The commercial then cuts to a
black screen to make its claim that
Kerry has, in fact, run negative ads
about Bush. This is followed by
ominous music and flashes of
Kerry's 21 attack ads. As the Kerry
voice-overs turn into an unintelligi

ble buzz, the commercial replays
the "Tell the truth to the American
people" clip three times and then
rounds it out with Kerry saying,
"And I haven't run negative adver
tisements yet. My advertisements in
this race are positive." Paid for by
Bush-Cheney '04.

Wow. John
Kerry. He must
be a lying scum
bag. What else is
there to say after
seeing that ad?
Clearly, run
ning negative ad
vertisements in
and of itself can't
be the issue. Sur-

rounding the video clip on the Bush
site are the "Kerry Gas Tax Calcula
tor: How much more would he cost
you?" and the "John Kerry Travel
Tracker: See why John Kerry is
wrong for your state."
If you dig around on the site, you
can even find the "Kerry flip-flop of
the day." And the Bush ad itself is a
negative ad. So that's not why you
should Kerry-hate.
You should Kerry-hate because
he's a liar.
The irony of this assertion is
enough to knock me off my chair.
And it has. Several times. Let's back
up the train a bit.
Though you probably didn't no
tice it the first time you saw the ad,
our friend Pinocchio threw a little
caveat in there — he said he didn't
run negative ads against his "oppo
nents in the primaries."
Last time I checked, John Kerry
didn't run against George Bush in
the Democratic primaries. And we
don't even know where this clip came
from; my guess would be a stump
speech during the primary campaign.
So really, based on the advertise
ment, we have no idea what John
Kerry has said about his campaign

strategy toward Bush. 1 would think
that if Kerry had run negative ads
the 25,825 times the Bush commer
cial says he did, the seasoned senator
would be on the ball enough not to
make a patently false, unequivocal
statement. But take it out of context
and yeah, that damn liberal is a
scumbag, all right.
So guess who's actually not telling
the truth to the American people? If
Bush isn't actually lying to them, he's
certainly misleading them, because
it doesn't take a Stanford degree to
pick out the deceptive nature of this
most recent Bush-speak.
What's unfortunate is that this ad
continues a three-year trend (proba
bly a 228-year trend, but we'll be par
tisan here) of shifting political de
bate away from the complexity of
meaningful issues and onto catch
phrases and catty assertions that are
