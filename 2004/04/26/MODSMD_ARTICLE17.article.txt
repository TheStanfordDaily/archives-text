Editorial unfair to R&DE,
misrepresented provost
Usually, when I read an opinion
piece that I don't like, I take the ap
proach that reasonable people can
disagree on important issues. But on
reading The Daily's recent editorial
on Residential and Dining Enter
prises ("A bureaucracy in need of
reform," 4/19), I felt it was necessary
to correct the record more formally
on a number of counts. Most impor
tant, 1 wanted to express my support
for the hundreds of hard-working
employees in R&DE.
I was quoted in the article in a
way that misrepresented the con
text of the conversation in which I
made the comment and distorted
my view of the job the staff of
R&DE is doing. In short, I think the
leadership and staff of R&DE de
serve our praise for the excellent
work they do — day in, day out —
in one of the most demanding and
difficult areas of University life.
The caustic and dismissive tone of
The Daily's editorial did not accu
rately reflect the quality of service
provided and was a disservice to the
staff members who work so hard to
provide those services.
Stanford provides housing and
support for 11,500 students and fam
ily members on campus. It feeds
nearly 5,000 students every day, and
many more — including faculty and
staff — on a regular basis. This is a
mammoth undertaking, and one
that is done with a tremendous sense
of pride and professionalism by its
staff. Moreover, contrary to the un
substantiated claims in the editorial,
housing costs are in the lowest quar
tile when compared to our 18 peer
institutions, according to statistics
gathered by the Consortium on Fi
nancing Higher Education.
While our foodservice costs are a
bit higher than the median for our
peer group, that results largely from
the fact that Stanford offers smaller
dining rooms in close proximity to
student residence halls as part of the
residential education experience.
This does not allow for the
economies of scale of a huge, cen
tralized, dining facility, but we be
lieve the ability to dine with mem
bers of a small living / learning corn

munity is a critical component of
Stanford's distinctive approach to
undergraduate life.
While there are no doubt ways to
improve our room and board options,
your editorial made little attempt to
constructively determine how that
might be achieved. Rather — with its
absence of balance and substantia
tion for its claims — it undermined
the work of hundreds of people who
work hard every day to provide ex
cellent service to our community.
JOHNETCHEMENDY
Provost, Stanford University
Dining Services director
responds to editorial
I am writing to clarify some per
ceptions and misinformation about
R&DE and housing and dining costs
in your April 19 editorial. While I
appreciate the support expressed to
me personally in the feature, I must
state clearly that the entire R&DE
leadership and the teams in Housing
and Dining are extremely hard
working, dedicated, cost-conscious
and service-oriented.
My achievements in Dining Ser
vices over the past two years would
not have been possible without the
strong support and leadership from
my boss Shirley Everett, the R&DE
organization, the executive director
of housing and his staff and the en
tire Dining Services team as well as
Stanford students.
The comments made in The
Daily's editorial about the Dining
Committee, our Dining manage
ment team and costs in both Hous
ing and Dining were unwarranted
and without basis in fact. All R&DE
areas work extremely hard to con
tain costs while providing the best
service possible to Stanford students
and guests. The staff across the
R&DE department are the hardest
working, most dedicated to students
and Stanford that I have encoun
tered in my many years of profes
sional experience. By most bench
mark measures and relevant cost
and staff service comparisons, Stan
ford's housing and dining programs
are to be valued and celebrated, not
berated as you have done.
The Daily also makes several

negative comments about issues that
it has with Dining Services and the
work of the Dining Advisory Com
mittee. Just as you credit my efforts,
please note that I am fully responsi
ble for addressing these kinds of
concerns and remain accountable
for doing so as the executive director
of Stanford Dining.
With the ongoing support and vi
sion set by Everett, associate vice
provost of R&DE, which has been
there since I arrived at Stanford, I
will continue to resolve any concerns
and look for ways to improve ser
vices and effect cost savings with the
Dining staff wherever possible.
Thank you.

Bush's Israel policy is outrageous
In another major foreign policy
blunder, President Bush has now gift
ed all the illegal settlements in the
West Bank to Israel to "reflect the
new realities on the ground." It is out
rageous that Israel should be reward
ed for its house demolitions, land
theft, gross violations of human rights,
ethnic cleansing, genocide and theft
of critical resources such as water.
The illegal settlements were built
in gross violation of U.N. sanctions,
and Israel has shown its contempt
for international law by refusing to
implement 28 U.N. Security Council
resolutions and several General As
sembly resolutions calling for Israel
to withdraw from Arab lands.
The brutal assassinations of two
Hamas leaders along with scores of
civilians were another clear viola
tion of International law. This bla
tant partiality and continued finan
cial support to Israel will serve as a
death sentence to hundreds of Is
raelis and Palestinians and will ex
pose all Americans to danger.
Pouring fuel onto a roaring infer
no is the grand finale of the "road
map to peace." I urge all readers who
support peace and justice to contact
their elected officials and demand
that our tax dollars not be used to
support state-sponsored terrorism.
