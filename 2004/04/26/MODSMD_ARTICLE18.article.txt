## NFL Draft still a mystery to Mark 
### 
Is there any regular event in sports that is more per
plexing than the NFL Draft? I've experienced fanta
sy baseball drafts with more coherence than your typ
ical NFL draft day.
The all-time exemplar of draft-day stupidity is Mike
Ditka's "Can you believe I'm doing this? Neither can I!" 1999
effort, in which he traded his entire set of draft picks for the
chance to move up and select Ricky Williams — who, of
course, did very little in New Orleans. Ditka didn't have to
trade his entire draft; he surely could have held on to a pick or
two and still been able to get Williams. But, no. this was the
NFL draft, so Iron Mike maxed out the bravado, trading his
entire set of draft picks and his first- and third-round picks the
following year for Washington's pick, selected Williams fifth
overall, and went golfing that afternoon.
Williams wasn't even the first running back taken (that
honor goes to Edgerrin James), and the Saints were not ex
actly a powerhouse team that could afford to sacrifice the
chance to pick up a half-dozen talented young players in the
draft. But they did it anyway.
This year's draft took place this past weekend, and its
head-scratching example (just one of a whopping 22 trades
on the first day) comes courtesy of Cleveland. The Browns
have a slew of holes to fill, so they traded their first- and sec
ond-round picks to move up just one slot to select, of all
things, a tight end?
Of course, it's Cleveland, so it happens to be an immense
ly talented tight end with what could well

prove to be a disabling attitude problem.
It's okay, I guess; new Brown Kellen
Winslow can hang out with William
Green, Dwayne Rudd and Tim Couch.
But every time a general manager
makes a stupid move, some other gener
al manager makes a smart move. And
the smart GM this year is the Chargers'
A.J. Smith, who drafted Eli Manning No.
1 overall and then traded him to the Gi
ants for Philip Rivers (the No. 5 pick).

New York's third-round pick this year and its first- and fifth
round picks next year.
Not only does the Giants' 2005 No. 1 pick figure to be a
pretty high one, but San Diego played it smart — very smart
— in this draft, allowing a maelstrom ignited by the Manning
camp to foster an undue sense of urgency in the Giants and net
a tremendous bounty for the Chargers.
It all started when Archie Manning told the Chargers that
he did not want his son to play for San Diego. The elder Man
ning, who never quarterbacked a winning team in 14 profes
sional seasons, wanted Eli to play fora winner, a la big broth
er Peyton, and suggested the Chargers send Manning to New
York. Never mind that the Giants had the fifth pick in the
draft because, well, they're not winners right now.
The first sign that San Diego knew exactly what it was
doing this time — unlike it did in 1998, when former GM
Bobby Beathard thought that Ryan Leaf was the best player
in the draft — was that, according to the Archie Manning, it
was the Chargers who leaked this information to the media.
San Diego cleverly made it publicly known that Manning
wanted out of San Diego. This put pressure on everyone but San
Diego, which made it clear all along that it was more than happy
to let Eli find out just how unhappy he would be as a Charger.
The Manning camp and agent Tom Condon were in a flus
ter. the Giants suddenly felt a sense of urgency and an "op
portunity" to move up and take the "best player in the draft,"
not to mention a player who wanted to be in New York (flat
tery can get you a long way, and football is no exception). San
Diego became the evil stepsister, the youngest Manning be
came (the world's least attractive) Cinderella and the Giants
became the fairy godmother.
The thing is, almost any news is good news when it comes
to the NFL draft. Unless you suffer from the dreaded "off-the
field problems" that NFL teams care about for precisely two
of the year's 365 days, you want buzz, as much buzz as you can
get. Manning was already the begrudging consensus top play
er available, because of his workmanlike college career,
tremendous pedigree and the resulting sense of security that
surrounds him. And by creating the controversy, the Chargers
heightened Manning's visibility, his aura, his desirability. The
Giants never really had a choice.
And when the clock struck midnight and the Chargers ac
tually selected Manning, making him act happy, hold up the
Chargers jersey for photographs, the whole bit. Made uncom
fortable by this static and uncomfortable state of affairs, the
Giants and the Manning camp made it happen. And, really, it
had to happen, because the NFL's GM S J ust l° ve making
draft-day headlines. I mean, after all this drama with Manning,
how could the Giants let him keep that Chargers jersey on? It
would just be too boring, too logical, too reasonable.
So the deal was swung, and talent-strapped San Diego got
three more draft picks — and a quarterback who could well
end up being better than Manning.
Manning is the safe pick, but watching both Rivers and Man
ning play. Rivers is absolutely the more exciting player. The guy
has a lot of the same skills, possesses the best upside since Ben
Roethlisberger and to top it all off will be both cheaper than
Manning and a more positive influence in the clubhouse.
I mean, can you imagine Eli meeting his Charger team
mates? "Well, I clearly don't want to be here, but if you go out
there and sacrifice your bodies for me, I can post a 72.4 passer
rating and lead us to five wins next year." I'm sure Drew Brees
and LaDanian Tomlinson would be thrilled.
1 should take a moment to mention that three Stanford
players were drafted on the second day. The versatility of cen
ter/tight end / defensive end Drew Caylor impressed the
Steelers, who selected him in the sixth round and will use him
at end. while the Browns took two Cardinal players of their
own: early-entrant defensive lineman Amon Gordon was
tabbed in the fifth round and offensive tackle Kirk Chambers
was selected in the sixth round. Apparently Cleveland was try
ing to mitigate the selection of Winslow by bringing in some
team players with good attitudes. Of course, the Browns then
selected Adimchinobe Echemandu from archrival Cal in the
seventh round, apparently in a symbolic gesture showing that
team chemistry was never a concern.
Cleveland's example is just one of many, though. Amidst
the storm of confusion, we can at least be certain that San
Diego turned a troubling state of affairs into a winning con
clusion. that New York looks a little sheepish and that Eli
Manning is smarter than he looks; after all, he got what he
wanted, too.

Mark Thoma is a junior history major who couldn 't find a
good spot in his column to tell you that Ohio State had 14 play
ers drafted, while (JSC and Oklahoma had just four apiece se
