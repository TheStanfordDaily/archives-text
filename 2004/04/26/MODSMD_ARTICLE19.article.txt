# Card splits series with Sac. St.
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
It was a feast-or-famine kind of weekend for the No.
2 Stanford baseball team's mighty lineup, as the Cardi
nal split a home-and-home series with Sacramento
State. Stanford (31-6, 7-2 Pacific-10 Conference)
pounded out a season-high 21 hits en route to a 15-1 vic
tory at Sunken Diamond on Friday night before being
limited to four singles in a 2-1 loss on Saturday at Hor
net Field.
Sacramento State starter Ethan Katz went the dis
tance in his finest outing of the season on Saturday,
walking four and striking out seven, while accomplish
ing something that very few opposing pitchers have
been able to of late: silencing the Cardinal bats.
"Ethan Katz threw a really good game and kept us
off balance," said Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess. "We hit a few balls hard but really didn't have
that much going."
Stanford manufactured its only run of the game and
took an early lead in the second inning after sophomore
first baseman John Mayberry Jr. laced a one-out single
to center. Mayberry promptly stole second base and ad
vanced to third on a throwing error by Hornets catcher
Matt Wilson before scoring on a sacrifice fly to center by
junior catcher Donny Lucy.
"(Katz] had three good pitches and we didn't make
an adjustment early," said Lucy, who extended his hit
streak to a career-high 13 games with a single in the
ninth. "Balls that we did hit were right at someone and
we couldn't get that big hit."
The Cardinal, which saw its seven-game winning
streak come to an end, wasted scoring opportunities in
the fourth, fifth and sixth, leaving two runners aboard in
each inning.
While the offense struggled, Stanford sophomore

starter Jeff Gilmore kept the Cardinal in the game with his
second consecutive strong outing. Coming off a complete
game victory against Cal, Gilmore picked up the tough loss
after giving up just two hits in six-plus innings of work.
"Jeff pitched great today," Lucy said. "He definitely
deserved a better result. I think the biggest key for him
has been getting ahead of hitters. He's more consistent
with his breaking ball and changeup and he's keeping
people off balance."
The Hornets (23-27) tied the game in the bottom of
third without the aid of a hit. Bret LeVier reached on a
throwing error by shortstop Chris Minaker and Jim
Strombach walked. After a sacrifice bunt. Jack Arroyo
brought LeVier home with a groundout to short.
Gilmore took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he
walked Ronnie Machado to lead off the inning and Ar
royo sacrificed him to second. Craig Johnson followed
with a seeing-eye single through the right side and
Machado came around to score ahead of the throw from
right fielder Jim Rapoport for the decisive run.
Marquess lifted Gilmore in the seventh inning after he
gave up a leadoff double to Brian Blauser and senior re
liever David O'Hagan came on to get the Cardinal out of
the jam.
"The best part for me was after Coach Marquess
brought in O'Hagan, all four of my infielders came up to
me and said I threw a hell of a game," Gilmore said.
After O'Hagan retired the Hornets in order during
the eighth, Stanford put the tying run in scoring position
in the ninth after Lucy singled and stole second base â€”
one of the Cardinal's season-high five steals in the
game. But Katz struck out Minaker looking to end the
game.
Junior Danny Putnam extended his hitting streak to 10
games with a single in the fourth inning, while senior Brian
Hall saw his 21-game hitting streak come to an end after

going 0-for-4 at the plate.
The Cardinal got a masterful
pitching performance from
sophomore ace Mark Ro
manczuk on Friday night. The

left hander struck out the side in
the first inning and gave up one
run on four hits over eight in
nings to pick up his eighth win of
the season.
"1 felt I had some of the best
stuff I've had all year," Ro
manczuk said after the win. "I
think I did two really good things
tonight by getting ahead of hit
ters and being able to put guys
away."

The Stanford offense wasted lit
tle time putting the game away,
scoring at least twice in each of the
first four innings. Sophomore sec
ond baseman Jed Lowrie and May
berry Jr. stroked back-to-back solo
home runs in the first inning.
Lucy, who went 4-for-4 with
three runs scored, hit a two-run
shot in the fourth inning to stake
the Cardinal to a 9-1 lead. Seven
Cardinal hitters had multi-hit

games, including Hall, Mayberry
and Chris Carter, who tallied
three hits apiece.
Hall, who started at third base in
stead of his usual spot in right field
with Jonny Ash nursing an injury,
handled all of his chances at the hot
corner and made a diving stop to
end the fourth inning on Saturday.
Stanford returns to action on
Tuesday with a non-conference
game at Santa Clara.
