The last reporter to interview rap star Notorious 8.1.G. before
his death, Stanford alumnus Cheo Hodari Coker, Class of "94,
spoke at the Stanford Bookstore on Friday about his new Notori
ous 8.1.G biography, his experiences in journalism and the con
temporary hip-hop scene.
"Unbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of the Notorious
8.1.G." is a look at the life and times of Christopher Wallace, an
honors student who dropped out of school to sell drugs and even
tually became the rapper known to all as the Notorious 8.1.G. In
preparation for the book, Coker spoke to family and friends of Big
gie and gathered never-before- seen photographs.
"8.1.G. was the one person, where through his life you could
explore the history of hip-hop." Coker said. "When you look at
his art, its more than just a gangsta rap record, it is about Rea
gan-omics and drug use in the '80s, and how that affected the
content of hip-hop."
As for why he wrote his book about Biggie, Coker said, "One
reason I picked Biggie is because, born 1972, he's a member of the
last generation of people who remember a time when hip-hop
didn't exist. Nowadays you take for granted how much music is
around and how easy it is to get to."
The second reason Coker chose his subject was more personal.
Coker first interviewed Biggie on Sept 27.1994 for Spin Magazine.
"It was two weeks after the release of Ready to Die,' and
even there I had a sense that he was going to be someone who
was important," Coker said.
Coker said he chose the title of the book because he found the
Notorious 8.1.G.'s life truly unbelievable. "Unbelievable" was also
one of the hit songs on Biggie's first album.
" I wanted to pick a title that would appeal to people who had no
interest in hip-hop whatsoever," Coker said. "Random House
wanted me to name it '8.1.G.,' but that's unimaginative."
Whether he is interviewing hip-hop artists or marketing his
book, Coker does feel the stretch between a Stanford education
and the streets of the Bronx.
"The first thing I learned from dealing with various gang mem
bers — and I've interviewed a lot of people — is that they spot a
fake a mile away " Coker said. "They have more respect if you
come in a suit and tie and use your proper English."
Joking about Ebonics, Coker said, "You don't want too much
slang. I don't want to read the way I talk. I wanted to write stuff that
my grandfather and college professors could read and understand,
but I also wanted the artist to say 'he got it right.'"
Coker was at the Four Seasons and interviewed Biggie fol
lowing the taping of his music video "Hypnotized." This was his
last interview with the rap star. Their next scheduled meeting
was in March of the same year following the Soul Train Awards.
Coker said he called Biggie several times on the night of his
death but to no avail.
"If he had called me back, I would have been in the car with him
when he got shot," Coker said. "Because the story was due Mon-
