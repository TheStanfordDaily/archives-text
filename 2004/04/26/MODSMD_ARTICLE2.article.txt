The last reporter to interview rap star Notorious 8.1.G. before
his death, Stanford alumnus Cheo Hodari Coker, Class of "94,
spoke at the Stanford Bookstore on Friday about his new Notori
ous 8.1.G biography, his experiences in journalism and the con
temporary hip-hop scene.
"Unbelievable: The Life, Death, and Afterlife of the Notorious
8.1.G." is a look at the life and times of Christopher Wallace, an
honors student who dropped out of school to sell drugs and even
tually became the rapper known to all as the Notorious 8.1.G. In
preparation for the book, Coker spoke to family and friends of Big
gie and gathered never-before- seen photographs.
"8.1.G. was the one person, where through his life you could
explore the history of hip-hop." Coker said. "When you look at
his art, its more than just a gangsta rap record, it is about Rea
gan-omics and drug use in the '80s, and how that affected the
content of hip-hop."
As for why he wrote his book about Biggie, Coker said, "One
reason I picked Biggie is because, born 1972, he's a member of the
last generation of people who remember a time when hip-hop
didn't exist. Nowadays you take for granted how much music is
around and how easy it is to get to."
The second reason Coker chose his subject was more personal.
Coker first interviewed Biggie on Sept 27.1994 for Spin Magazine.
"It was two weeks after the release of Ready to Die,' and
even there I had a sense that he was going to be someone who
was important," Coker said.
Coker said he chose the title of the book because he found the
Notorious 8.1.G.'s life truly unbelievable. "Unbelievable" was also
one of the hit songs on Biggie's first album.
" I wanted to pick a title that would appeal to people who had no
interest in hip-hop whatsoever," Coker said. "Random House
wanted me to name it '8.1.G.,' but that's unimaginative."
Whether he is interviewing hip-hop artists or marketing his
book, Coker does feel the stretch between a Stanford education
and the streets of the Bronx.
"The first thing I learned from dealing with various gang mem
bers — and I've interviewed a lot of people — is that they spot a
fake a mile away " Coker said. "They have more respect if you
come in a suit and tie and use your proper English."
Joking about Ebonics, Coker said, "You don't want too much
slang. I don't want to read the way I talk. I wanted to write stuff that
my grandfather and college professors could read and understand,
but I also wanted the artist to say 'he got it right.'"
Coker was at the Four Seasons and interviewed Biggie fol
lowing the taping of his music video "Hypnotized." This was his
last interview with the rap star. Their next scheduled meeting
was in March of the same year following the Soul Train Awards.
Coker said he called Biggie several times on the night of his
death but to no avail.
"If he had called me back, I would have been in the car with him
when he got shot," Coker said. "Because the story was due Mon-
day and I was doing a cover, I'd tollow
him around. The next morning my as
sociate editor called me up, and asked
me, 'Is it true?' Once I found out I
didn't sleep for 48 hours."
"Unbelievable" is not the first
book written about the Notorious
8.1.G.'s death.
"The problem I had with both
books was that neither seemed con
cerned with who Christopher Wal
lace was, a lot of people knew who
the guy in the bowler hat was,
Coker said. "Since I interviewed
Biggie so many different times, I got
to know who he was."
Coker said that he wanted to paint
an accurate portrayal of the rap star.
"I wanted to show who it is he was,
but not shy away from the Biggie who
pulled guns, smoked weed and had
more girls than any man should." he
added. "But when he got big, he was
not only able to have music change
his life, he brought in the people from
the corner and showed them that in
stead of risking your life for $20,000,
I can get you $20,(XM) a show."
Coker has his own theories on
the rap star's sudden death.
"It wasn't the drug game that got
Biggie killed" he said. "If he were
still a drug dealer, he might be alive.
It was the music industry. It was a
lot of the controversies and the
back and forth between Shug Night
and Sean "Puffy' Combs."
Coker said that his book is not fin
ished and that he could see himself re
vising it and adding to it as new details
about Biggie emerge.
"This book also represents my
tumultuous love of hip-hop," he
said. "I go through highs and lows,
but every now and then an album
will come by and I will think, "Why
would I stop writing about hip-hop?'
I want to write about this for the rest
of my life and teach about it."
Coker, told the audience,
"Everything started for me here.
It's weird to be up here at the podi
um in a suit, cause 1 was always the
guy with the baggy jeans and hood
ie, rocking out."
He added, "I used to eo to the

second floor of the Bookstore
where the magazine rack was and
read and dream about writing for
the magazines."
In 1991, Coker began writing for
The Stanford Daily.
"It was something about seeing
my stuff in print that set off an in
terest in me," he said.
Coker's first Daily article —
which ran on Oct. 3, 1991 —was a
reply to an album review in De La
Soul magazine. Apparently Coker
had ranted about the review long
enough that his editor took action.
"Finally my editor told me,
stop talking about it and just do
something about it,"he said. "So I
did. It just became this thing I
wanted to do, I started to write
more and more and more."
Writing for The Daily wasn't
enough for Coker's high ambi
tions. During his sophomore year,
Maynard Parker — then editor in
chief of Newsweek — came to The
Daily and handpicked interns, and
Coker was among them.
"With this intern job, I found that if
you wanted to talk to people like Pub
lic Enemy or Ice Cube they would do
phone interviews and press," Coker
said. "So I began as if I was already
writing for the places I wanted to write
for like Rolling Stone."
By his junior year Coker had
published pieces in local rap pages,
and by February of his senior year,
he got to do a cover on his idol Ice
Cube. Coker now writes primarily
for Vibe Magazine, though his
work has been featured in Pre
miere Magazine and The Los An
geles Times as well.
Coker asked the Stanford audience
in attendance to consider hip-hop as a
worthy topic of academic study.
"We've only touched the sur
face of studying at the college
level," Coker said. "I think it's an
important art form that touches
more than blacks and Latinos, it
touches the entire world."
Coker continued, "When we
study hip-hop culture, I think theory
is a good start, but we need to look at
other aspects such as socioeconom
ics and explore how budget cuts and
the lack of music programs in
schools gave birth to this culture.
This creativity among kids wasn't
lost. They learned how to make a
turntable an instrument."
