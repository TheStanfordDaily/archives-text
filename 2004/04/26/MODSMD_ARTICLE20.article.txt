# Card offense proves streaky
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Cardinal's 21-hit, 15-1 victory
over Sacramento State on Friday night was
precisely what one would expect from a team
that has outscored its opponents 333-154 this
season. But Saturday afternoon's 2-1 Stanford
loss had all the sting and shock of David
trouncing Goliath, with so many of the streaks
that Cardinal fans have enjoyed watching in
past weeks fell suddenly to a 23-27 Hornets
squad.
Saturday's loss ended Stanford's 12-game
streak of reaching double digits in hits and the
team's run of seven straight wins, one short of
a season-high. Before Saturday's loss, Stanford
had only one single-run game and one game in
which the team had fewer than six hits — both
lows occurring in a 3-1 loss to Fresno State in
early February.
The Cardinal also had two individual
streaks end on Saturday — seniors Sam Fuld
and Brian Hall had their hit parades shut down
at 12 games and 21 games, respectively.
After Friday's thrashing of the Hornets, ju
nior catcher Donny Lucy, who put in a 4-for-4
performance at the plate, said that hitting is
contagious, which would account for the huge
number of offensive streaks that the Cardinal
has mounted over the course of the season.
Saturday's game seemed to make a pretty
good case fora theory that not hitting is conta
gious as well.
But the reason for the hitting slump that
struck nearly every Stanford player at once can
probably be traced to the parity of college
baseball. It's the nature of the game — on any

given day, any team can catch
you off-guard and destroy any
streak you have going, no matter
how long-standing.
"It just takes one good pitch
er throwing a good game," said
Stanford head coach Mark Mar
quess.
Turns out that Sacramento
State junior Ethan Katz was just

the right hurler to impede the
Cardinal's consistency at the
bat, pitching his fourth complete
game in 13 starts this year.
"[Katz] had an above-average
fastball, a slider than was moving a
lot across the plate and a good
changeup," sophomore infielder
John Mayberry Jr. said. "He had
control of all of his pitches the whole
game."
Katz gave the Cardinal little
chance to make anything happen,
as he fanned seven in nine innings
and saw many Stanford batters
knock hard-hit shots directly at
Hornet fielders. Even the runners

that did manage to get aboard
often did so with two outs.
"We didn't have a chance to
do any situational hitting," Mar
quess said. "We were fortunate
to get that one run."
Saturday's contest may have
been one of the Cardinal's more
drastic and sudden offensive
slumps this season, but it certainly
wasn't the first. Aside from the
February loss to Fresno State,
Stanford also exhibited less than
typically dominant performances
at the plate in matchups with San
Jose State and Cal Poly late last
month — despite picking up wins

in those games.
But the Cardinal's knowl
edge that offensive streaks and
consistency can disappear
quickly has kept its slumps brief
throughout the season.
"We have a mature group of
hitters," Mayberry Jr. said.
"Usually when some people
aren't hitting, the rest of the
lineup does. We're peaking at
different times."
Now that the Cardinal has re
turned from Sacramento with a
series of streaks broken, there's
only one thing for the team to do.
Start new ones.
