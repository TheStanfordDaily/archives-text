### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Cardinal's 21-hit, 15-1 victory
over Sacramento State on Friday night was
precisely what one would expect from a team
that has outscored its opponents 333-154 this
season. But Saturday afternoon's 2-1 Stanford
loss had all the sting and shock of David

Saturday's loss ended Stanford's 12-game
streak of reaching double digits in hits and the
team's run of seven straight wins, one short of

had only one single-run game and one game in
which the team had fewer than six hits — both
lows occurring in a 3-1 loss to Fresno State in

The Cardinal also had two individual

and Brian Hall had their hit parades shut down
at 12 games and 21 games, respectively.

performance at the plate, said that hitting is

number of offensive streaks that the Cardinal
has mounted over the course of the season.
Saturday's game seemed to make a pretty
good case fora theory that not hitting is conta
gious as well.
But the reason for the hitting slump that
struck nearly every Stanford player at once can
probably be traced to the parity of college
baseball. It's the nature of the game — on any
