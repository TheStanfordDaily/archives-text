# No. 8 Card sweeps two-game series against No. 6 UW
## 
### BRIAN DUNNE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 8 Stanford softball team (37-12,8-4 Pa
cific-10 Conference) knew going into this week
end s road trip that this was a defining moment, if
not the defining moment, in its Pacific-10 Confer
ence schedule.
The Cardinal would be traveling hundreds of
miles in three days after a month-long homestand.
It would be trying to erase the bad taste in its mouth
after losing big to top-ranked Arizona and suffer
ing an upset at unranked non-conference foe St.
Mary's earlier in the week. Most importantly, the
Cardinal would be facing some of the fiercest com
petition on its difficult schedule in No. 4 UCLA
(29-7,2-6) and No. 6 Washington (32-11,6-4).
The Cardinal answered any questions the last
couple of weeks might have raised with three
thrilling victories this weekend on the road at
UCLA and Washington. The Cardinal won with
pitching on Friday, hitting on Saturday and a little
of both on Sunday in a weekend that helped ce
ment Stanford's place in the upper echelon of the
Pac-lOthis year.
Friday's game versus No. 4 UCLA (29-7, 2-6)
was a classic pitchers' duel as Cardinal ace Dana
Sorensen and the Bruins' Keira Goerl continually
mowed down opposing hitters inning after inning.
However, "Lightning D" proved too much for
Goerl and the Bruins to overcome as Sorensen
hurled a complete game shutout in a 1-0 Cardinal
victory. Sorensen allowed only four Bruin hits
while striking out eight and walking one to im
prove her record on the season to 22-7. The Bru
ins' Goerl, despite allowing only one run over
seven excellent innings, was charged with the loss
and dropped to 17-5 on the year. The Cardinal's
only run of the game came in the top of the sixth in
ning when junior designated player Heather
Shook scored from second on a single to left field

by sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin.
Saturday's win over Washington was just as nerve
racking as Friday's narrow victory at UCLA. The Cardi
nal produced an offensive onslaught against Washington
starter Tia Bollinger, smacking 13 hits and plating 12 runs
in the game. Indeed, the Stanford led the Huskies 12-3 en
tering the bottom of the seventh inning with sophomore

pitcher Laura Severson needing just three outs to seal an
other Cardinal victory.
However, two Husky hits to lead off the bottom of the
seventh followed by a fielding error by Severson loaded
the bases for Washington with no outs. The Huskies man
aged to plate five runs in the inning before Severson was
pulled from the game with one out to go in favor of Dana
Sorensen. Sorensen allowed one last Huskv run before in

ducing a game-ending pop fly by Washington's Kathy
Fiske that sealed a 12-9 Cardinal victory. Severson, who
pitched well against a very good Washington lineup for the
first six innings of Saturday's game, was credited with the
win to bring her record to 13-5 on the year, and Sorensen
earned her fifth save.
The Cardinal offensive barrage was led by sophomore
center fielder Catalina Morris, who had a home run and

two RBIs in addition to scoring a season-high
four runs in the game. Several Cardinal hit
ters besides Morris contributed to the Cardi
nal victory'. Senior catcher Jessica Allister, the
Cardinal's most dangerous hitter over the
past month, added three RBIs, and Lauren
Lappin and junior first baseman Leah Nelson
each added two RBIs in Saturday's win.
Sunday afternoon featured a rematch
between the Cardinal and the Huskies, and
once again the two teams fought to the bitter
end with the Cardinal barely edging out the
home team, this time in a 3-2 victory in extra
innings. "Lightning D" was masterful in the
Cardinal victory, striking out the first eight
Huskies she faced en route to a 14-strikeout
complete game victory in eight innings. The
win was Sorensen's 23rd on the season. How
ever, Sunday's game belonged to junior sec
ond baseman Meghan Sickler, who singled
with two outs in the top of the eighth inning to
score Jessica Allister and give the Cardinal a
3-2 victory over the Huskies.
Sickler's game-winning single over
shadowed another magnificent offensive per
formance by Allister, who drove in both of
the Cardinal's runs in regulation innings with
a 2-RBI single in the first inning in addition to
scoring the winning run in the eighth.
Overall, the weekend couldn't have
gone much better for the Cardinal, which at 8-
4 in the Pac-10 could post a winning confer
ence record for just the second time in the his
tory of the program. Stanford got what head
coach John Rittman likes to call the "timely
hit" in clutch situations this weekend, and
both Cardinal starting pitchers threw well
enough to earn victories.
The Cardinal won't be able to rest on
its laurels this weekend, however, as it will

have its hands full with two games against
top-ranked Arizona (47-1,12-0) next Saturday and Sun
day in Tucson. But this weekend is something to build
on — and after sweeping three games against the No. 4
and No. 6 teams in the country, the Cardinal has shown
itself capable of winning consistently against elite com
petition, which is exactly what it needs to do in Arizona
next weekend.

a 2-RBI single in the first inning in addition to
scoring the winning run in the eighth.
Overall, the weekend couldn't have
gone much better for the Cardinal, which at 8-
4 in the Pac-10 could post a winning confer
ence record for just the second time in the his
tory of the program. Stanford got what head
coach John Rittman likes to call the "timely
hit" in clutch situations this weekend, and
both Cardinal starting pitchers threw well
enough to earn victories.
The Cardinal won't be able to rest on
its laurels this weekend, however, as it will

have its hands full with two games against
top-ranked Arizona (47-1,12-0) next Saturday and Sun
day in Tucson. But this weekend is something to build
on — and after sweeping three games against the No. 4
and No. 6 teams in the country, the Cardinal has shown
itself capable of winning consistently against elite com
petition, which is exactly what it needs to do in Arizona
next weekend.

The women's softball team swept No. 6 Washington this weekend in Seattle. The Cardinal beat the Huskies 12-9 on Saturday
and 3-2 yesterday.
The No. 8 Stanford softball team (37-12,8-4 Pa
cific-10 Conference) knew going into this week
end s road trip that this was a defining moment, if
not the defining moment, in its Pacific-10 Confer
ence schedule.
The Cardinal would be traveling hundreds of
miles in three days after a month-long homestand.
It would be trying to erase the bad taste in its mouth
after losing big to top-ranked Arizona and suffer
ing an upset at unranked non-conference foe St.
Mary's earlier in the week. Most importantly, the
Cardinal would be facing some of the fiercest com
petition on its difficult schedule in No. 4 UCLA
(29-7,2-6) and No. 6 Washington (32-11,6-4).
The Cardinal answered any questions the last
couple of weeks might have raised with three
thrilling victories this weekend on the road at
UCLA and Washington. The Cardinal won with
pitching on Friday, hitting on Saturday and a little
of both on Sunday in a weekend that helped ce
ment Stanford's place in the upper echelon of the
Pac-lOthis year.
Friday's game versus No. 4 UCLA (29-7, 2-6)
was a classic pitchers' duel as Cardinal ace Dana
Sorensen and the Bruins' Keira Goerl continually
mowed down opposing hitters inning after inning.
However, "Lightning D" proved too much for
Goerl and the Bruins to overcome as Sorensen
hurled a complete game shutout in a 1-0 Cardinal
victory. Sorensen allowed only four Bruin hits
while striking out eight and walking one to im
prove her record on the season to 22-7. The Bru
ins' Goerl, despite allowing only one run over
seven excellent innings, was charged with the loss
and dropped to 17-5 on the year. The Cardinal's
only run of the game came in the top of the sixth in
ning when junior designated player Heather
Shook scored from second on a single to left field

by sophomore shortstop Lauren Lappin.
Saturday's win over Washington was just as nerve
racking as Friday's narrow victory at UCLA. The Cardi
nal produced an offensive onslaught against Washington
starter Tia Bollinger, smacking 13 hits and plating 12 runs
in the game. Indeed, the Stanford led the Huskies 12-3 en
tering the bottom of the seventh inning with sophomore

pitcher Laura Severson needing just three outs to seal an
other Cardinal victory.
However, two Husky hits to lead off the bottom of the
seventh followed by a fielding error by Severson loaded
the bases for Washington with no outs. The Huskies man
aged to plate five runs in the inning before Severson was
pulled from the game with one out to go in favor of Dana
Sorensen. Sorensen allowed one last Huskv run before in

ducing a game-ending pop fly by Washington's Kathy
Fiske that sealed a 12-9 Cardinal victory. Severson, who
pitched well against a very good Washington lineup for the
first six innings of Saturday's game, was credited with the
win to bring her record to 13-5 on the year, and Sorensen
earned her fifth save.
The Cardinal offensive barrage was led by sophomore
center fielder Catalina Morris, who had a home run and

two RBIs in addition to scoring a season-high
four runs in the game. Several Cardinal hit
ters besides Morris contributed to the Cardi
nal victory'. Senior catcher Jessica Allister, the
Cardinal's most dangerous hitter over the
past month, added three RBIs, and Lauren
Lappin and junior first baseman Leah Nelson
each added two RBIs in Saturday's win.
Sunday afternoon featured a rematch
between the Cardinal and the Huskies, and
once again the two teams fought to the bitter
end with the Cardinal barely edging out the
home team, this time in a 3-2 victory in extra
innings. "Lightning D" was masterful in the
Cardinal victory, striking out the first eight
Huskies she faced en route to a 14-strikeout
complete game victory in eight innings. The
win was Sorensen's 23rd on the season. How
ever, Sunday's game belonged to junior sec
ond baseman Meghan Sickler, who singled
with two outs in the top of the eighth inning to
score Jessica Allister and give the Cardinal a
3-2 victory over the Huskies.
Sickler's game-winning single over
shadowed another magnificent offensive per
formance by Allister, who drove in both of
the Cardinal's runs in regulation innings with
a 2-RBI single in the first inning in addition to
scoring the winning run in the eighth.
Overall, the weekend couldn't have
gone much better for the Cardinal, which at 8-

ence record for just the second time in the his
