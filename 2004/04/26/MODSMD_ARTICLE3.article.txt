# Virus hits campus
## New bug strikes library and residential computers 
### MATT SMITH 
A new computer virus has
struck 600 to 800 campus comput
ers over the span of several weeks.
Commonly known as Gaobot,
Agobot or Phatbot, the virus has
grown through several methods,
taking advantage of un-patched
vulnerabilities last summer, blank
or poorly chosen passwords and
open file shares.
"These viruses are a blend of
dozens of attacks," said Sandra
Senti, executive director of
technology, strategy and sup
port. "In addition to propagat
ing themselves, they sniff login
and password information from
the keyboard, harvest e-mail ad
dresses, disable antivirus soft
ware and put the machine under
the remote control of an attack
er by listening for commands
on IRC."
This means that while the
virus does not have many direct
effects, it leaves the infected
computer very susceptible to
other viruses.
According to Resident Com
puter Consultant Justy Burdick, a
sophomore, problems with the
virus also arise because the virus
writer has been releasing new ver
sions every few days — allowing it
to escape detection from anti-virus
programs such as Symantec.
"It's a race between the writer
and the Symantec workers to up
date the virus definitions fast

enough," Burdick said.
"We've been scanning for
weak passwords and notifying
users that they should set strong
ones," Senti said. She also rec
ommended that students follow
Secure Computing's recom
mended steps for protecting
desktop computers.
Students should first update
the computer's operating system
regardless of whether it is Win
dows or Mac OS, Burdick said.
Then students should update
their virus definitions through the
Norton Anti-virus program pro
vided at the beginning of the year.
Third, students should be sure to
have complex passwords, or pass
words with combinations of num
bers and letters and nothing re
sembling real words.
Users of infected computers
may notice a slowdown in
speed, inability to access anti
virus software Web sites and
problems with their anti-virus
software itself. They are also
likely receive an e-mail from
Stanford Information Technol
ogy Systems and Services about
the problem. All known infect
ed computers will also be cut
off from the Stanford network
to avoid further infection.
The only known cure is a com
plete reinstallation of the oper
ating system and software on
the computer.
"I would say it is the smartest
vims I have ever seen," Burdick said.
