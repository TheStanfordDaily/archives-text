# Admit weekend brings prospective frosh and stringent alcohol policy for students
## Admitted students get a taste of life on the Farm while current students observe dry weekend 
### MAX ETCHEMENDY 
Hoards of prospective stu
dents and parents descended on
the Stanford campus for the an
nual Admit Weekend. From
Thursday, April 22 to Sunday,
April 25, prospective freshmen
lived with student hosts and par
ticipated in a variety of events
showcasing Stanford's diverse
activities and opportunities.
"We got about a thousand
profros on the first day," said
sophomore Marie Cannizzaro,
one of Admit Weekend's student
coordinators. "I'm really happy
with the turnout."
One of the most controversial
aspects of Admit Weekend was
its strict alcohol policy, which ef
fectively mandated a dry campus
for the duration of the weekend.
Open-invitee-list parties across
campus were ordered to remain
dry, and the University required
prospective students to sign an
agreement stating that sanctions
— including revocation of admis
sion — could be enacted if the
profro violated the policy.
Despite the strict — and, in
some students' opinions, overly
harsh — alcohol policy, prospec
tive students and organizers
called the weekend a success.
Andrew Dimock, one of Fresh
men-Sophomore College's resi
dent fellows, said that the student
body handled the alcohol policy
well. He explained that "there was
some grumbling" when the policy
was first enacted, but added that
most students ultimately support
ed and abided by the rules.
"They don't want to get the
profros in trouble, and most of

them recognize that there are
some valid safety issues when
dealing with high school stu
dents," he said. "They also un
derstand that, unlike regular stu
dents, the profros don't yet know
their way around campus and
aren't yet part of a community of
students that know one another
and are able to look out for one
another if someone's drinking
goes out of control."
Dimock also said that the
weekend had gone well for the
prospective students. "Our
RoHos and staff put a lot of work
into preparations for Admit
Weekend, and it's paid off," he
said. "The profros I've talked to
seem to be enjoying themselves.
Cannizzaro echoed these sen
timents, highlighting the week
end's excellent turnout and vari
ety of activities. These included
Hohopalooza parties and the
ever-popular a capella concert,
which she said "packed" Memor
ial Auditorium.
She added that the alcohol
policy is "imposed fora good
reason," emphasizing the im
portance of establishing a safe
and friendly environment for
visiting students.
"It's really important to create
an environment in which they
feel safe," she said.
Profros also had good things
to say about the weekend.
"It was more like how college
will really be," said Diane Chang of
Lynbrook High School in San Jose,
California. "I think the lectures
were a real-life encounter with
what Stanford is like, like walking
into any class and sitting down.
Nila Bala, who attends Mis
sion San Jose High School in Fre
mont, California, also said that
she enjoyed her time on campus.
"I met a lot of cool people, and
I think the picnic lunches were
the best opportunity to do so,"
Bala said. "There wasn't any way
for groups and cliques to immedi
ately form. It was easy to break
into conversation because they
were right next to you."
