# Creative writing enrollment climbs

### BRENDAN SELBY STAFF WRITER 
Techies and fuzzies generally
don't agree on much, hut members
from each faction are lining up to
take classes through the Creative
Writing Program, causing waiting
lists to swell to unprecedented lev
els. With a faculty of globally es
teemed professors and accessible
young lecturers, students say the
program provides some of the best
undergraduate teaching on campus.
Because of their popularity, the
demand to take writing classes ex
ceeds the number of places available
in sections. According to English
Prof. Eavan Boland, who is the pro
gram s director, the number of sec
tions offered has been limited by the
programs tight budget.
"On the important issue of wait
ing lists, we obviously do not want
them at all," she said. "Putting on
extra sections is what we want to
do. It's also what we believe is right.
But we cannot, as a program, al
ways afford this, and in a perfect
world we would wish to have a
blanket assurance from the Uni
versity administration that any sec
tions we put on would be covered."
As a partial solution to the dou
ble-edged sword of popularity, next
year the program will be offering a
new course, titled "An Introduction
to the Creative Writing Minor."
Adam Johnson, who is currently

teaching intermediate fiction, will
lead the course.
Boland said that one of the
reasons the program has become
more visible and approachable
to undergraduates is the creation
of the creative writing minor five
years ago.
"The minor is particularly im
portant," Boland said. "It reassures
us that gifted, committed student
writers who choose the sciences, or
other non-humanities courses,
won't have to give up their talents
or interests if they major in a non
humanities subject."
There are currently 35 creative
writing minors, and Boland said that
number is "growing fast." In addi
tion, 4() percent of English majors opt
to pursue an emphasis in creative
writing as part of their major.
Jones lecturer Katharine Noel
said that nearly all of her begin
ning and most of her intermedi
ate students are pursuing majors
other than English.
"Some are serious writers; others
like the balance a creative class gives
their schedule," Noel said. "A few are
there because they think a creative
writing class will be easy — in fact it's
pretty hard work — intensive but
fun."
Students say the faculty in both
fiction and poetry are among the
strongest in the country. Established
writers like Tobias Wolff and Ken
Fields teach advanced classes, while

the up-and-coming Jones lecturers
teach many of the beginning and in
termediate classes. Also, each year
the program brings visiting writers
to campus to teach fora quarter.
Nobel Laureate J.M. Coetzee, au
thor of "Disgrace" and "Elizabeth
Costello," is currently teaching a
class as the Stein Visiting Writer,
and Thom Gunn was the Mohr Vis
iting Poet during fall quarter.
"I think the faculty is fabulous,"
said Karan Mahajan, a junior who
is pursuing a double-major in Eng
lish and Economics. "I have been
able to take classes with a variety of
teachers. Undergraduates usually
don't have the opportunity to study
with writers like Tobias Wolff and
J.M. Coetzee."
Jones lecturers are selected to
teach writing courses after com
pleting two years as Stegner fel
lows. The fellowship is a graduate
program for eminent young writers
named after the novelist Wallace
Stegner, who, along with poet Yvor
Winters, founded the Creative
Writing Program at Stanford in the
19405. It is the second-oldest pro
gram in the country. There are cur
rently 20 fellows, 10 poets and 10
fiction writers, who were selected
from as many as 800 applicants.
"I think it helps that we have
Stegner fellowships," said Jenny
Zhang, a junior. "I feel like they
take more care with your writing
and your workshops. They are mid

way between a friend and a mentor.
It is very motivating to see someone
who is just a couple of years older
than you working hard and being
on the cusp of making it big."
Zhang is pursuing a major in
Comparative Studies in Race and
Ethnicity and has taken six writing
courses since her arrival at Stan
ford, two in poetry and four in fic
tion. She said that the courses have
been a humbling experience for
her. She related the story of taking
her first poetry class where a friend
had e-mailed a poem to their pro
fessor before classes started.
"The teacher redid the poem
and brought it to class to bring
him down a notch," Zhang said.
"But it was a great class."
Julie Orringer, another Jones
lecturer who pursued writing dur
ing her undergraduate years at
Cornell University, said she under
stands the appeal of writing to stu
dents at a competitive university.
"Creative writing can provide a
kind of relief from the idea that
everything you study in college
must somehow benefit your pro
fessional goals," Orringer said.
"When I was an undergraduate, I
loved reading and talking about fic
tion and poetry simply because it
cast light on the mysteries of
human existence. There's some
thing inherently fascinating about
trying to understand why human
beings behave the way they do."
