# Israeli independence celebrated
## 
### JESSICA WANG DESK EDITOR 
Members of the Stanford com
munity gathered in White Plaza at
noon yesterday in a festive and en
ergetic celebration of Israeli Inde
pendence Day. The annual event
featured live music, Israeli folk
dancing, free falafels, speakers and
student performances. Also gath
ered in the plaza were a group of
silent protesters who claimed that
the event presented a one-sided
view of history and ignored Israel's
human-rights abuses.
According to Adina Danzig, the
executive director of Stanford Hil
lel, this year's celebration focuses
on the living aspect of Israeli cul
ture and Israel's accomplishments.
"Throughout the year, Hillel's
Israel programming focuses on the
political challenges facing the Mid
dle East, which is a critical focus of
the educational work we do,"
Danzig said. "But on this one day,
Israeli Independence Day, the stu
dents planning the week chose to
highlight and celebrate Israel's
many successes and strengths be
yond the political realm."
Sophomore Adi Greif, the out
going education and culture chair
of the Jewish Leadership Council,
said this year's celebration is about
spreading awareness of Israeli cul
ture, an area that is often over
looked amidst the turbulent poli
tics of the Middle East.
"[lsraeli Pride Week| helps stu
dents remember that every country
is full of culture and is multi
faceted; there's more than just the
depressing politics you see in the
paper," Greif said.
According to Hagai, an Israeli
chef from Florence Moore Dining,
he distributed over 650 free
falafels.
"That means that at least that
many students, faculty, staff and
community members participated
in the event this year â€” over 200
more than last year," said fresh
man Lyuba Wolf, chair of the Yom
HaAtzmaut Celebration and Is
raeli Pride Week committee.
Wolf was one of the speakers at
the event, addressing Israel's ac
complishments in technology, civil
liberties and medicine.
"The things that I use every day
including the cell phone, Windows
NT, AOL Instant Messenger and
Intel's centrino chip were all devel
oped in Israel," Wolf said.
The student Israeli Folk Danc
ing club performed three Israeli
folkdances dances and during the

last, called "Od Lo Ahavti Dai" (I
haven't loved enough) many peo
ple from the crowd joined in.
Israeli college students from
"Israel at Heart" who had recent
ly finished their service in the Is
raeli army from were also at the
celebration. They spoke about
their love for their country and
will be involved in events

throughout the week.
Mira Leytes and Lizzy
Heydemann ended the
celebration by leading
the crowd in song. They
sang "Oseh Shalom"
(Make Peace) and "Od
Yavo Shalom Aleinu"
(Peace will come to Us),
which features both
"Shalom," the Hebrew
word for peace and
"Salaam," the Arabic
word for peace, and the
crowd joined in singing.
Also at the celebra
tion were protesters
silently holding Palestin
ian flags and anti-Israel
posters.
"We needed to make a
statement that it's not okay
to blatantly celebrate
something that's also a dis
aster fora whole set of
people," said Ali Raz;

Awan, a master's student in biomed
ical informatics.
"There are two issues here. I think
it's all well and good to remember the
Holocaust and celebrate its end, but
as soon as you start celebrating the
birth of the state of Israel, it becomes
a problem."
He added, "It glazes over the
fact that so many people were dis
placed as a result of that event . . .

We were there as a reminder that
all is not well."
However, Greif said that the
protest was largely ignored by
those involved in the celebration.
"Everyone has the right to free
speech and assembly," Greif said.
"We do not want to get in argu
ments with them on a day when we

want to celebrate."
Danzig said the exposure to Is
raeli people and culture will allow
students on campus to know Is

rael better, even if they have
never been there in person.
"I think particularly now,
when college-aged students are
less likely to visit Israel in person
than in years past, it's essential
that we bring Israel here,"
Danzig said. "This week's activi
ties, which highlight Israeli envi

ronmental achievements, film,
music and dance, and during
which we brought several young
Israelis to mingle with Stanford
students on campus through the
"Israel at Heart' program, will
enable Jewish and non-Jewish
students here to get to know Is
rael on a deeper level."
