# Starting from scratch
## Stanford Scientific Review encourages writing on science 
### SU FEN LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
"All our writers create articles
from scratch," said Jonathan Olsen,
co-editor in chief of the Stanford
Scientific Review magazine. "Once
students come to our meeting, they
understand that the SSR does not
edit or seek theses or prewritten
academic papers. Those journals al
ready exist. We do not assume our
readers have a deep science back
ground. but we bring them up to
speed with the cutting-edge
progress and its significance by the
end of each article."
Olsen, a senior majoring in
human biology, is also the founder
and editor in chief of the inaugural
issue.
Its first issue was launched last
spring, but it was only until winter
this year that the second issue was
published. From next year onwards,
however, the Stanford Scientific
Review will be published on a quar
terly basis.
"SSR editors strive to publish all
articles that meet a minimum stan
dard of excellence. This year, the
number of writers and articles has in
creased more than 50 percent, so we
have responded by publishing more
frequently," said Olsen.
Olsen wanted inquisitive students
interested in science and technology
and its various social, ethical, and pol
icy impacts to have a forum to pursue
these questions. He also wanted a
supportive group of peers to encour
age writers to approach faculty
members in the SSR network.
"Stanford is one of the world's
most prolific centers of innovation
in science and technology, yet we
did not have a student-run maga
zine that explained the ground
breaking faculty research that is in
progress to those outside the labs,"
Olsen said.
"Students, regardless of so
called techie or fuzzy inclinations,
should know that such research ex
ists, that it has scientific and social
impact and that they can contribute
to that progress."
In spring 2002, Olsen recruited
an interdisciplinary group of stu
dents to form the editorial team.
They came from various depart
ments such as Human Biology, STS,
Chemistry, Biology, Computer Sci
ence, Physics and Electrical Engi
neering, as well as the medical
school and business school.
Professors Craig Heller, Renu
Heller and Russ Fernald also pro
vided encouragement and the initial
resources to get SSR started. "After
the first issue was published, many
professors and administrators un
derstood what our magazine was
about and were quite willing to
help," Olsen said.
Students get involved by attend
ing their weekly meetings. While
SSR occasionally fliers and sends e
mail to seek out writers, most of

them attend their weekly meetings
because they picked up a copy of
SSR or had friends working for SSR.
"Writers and editors brainstorm
topics together. We don't like hier
archy; we like ideas and execution.
Once we choose the richest article
topics, editors help writers contact
professors and define a manageable
scope for the article." Olsen said.
"Since we realize the typical Stan
ford student is overbooked, we are
very flexible about deadlines as
writers make progress over the
course of three weeks."
SSR has three different cate
gories for its articles. Science and
technology articles delve more
deeply into explaining cutting edge
science and technology and its sig
nificance. Ethics and policy articles
center on an issue and how science
and technology either exacerbate or
help solve that modern-day prob
lem. Features includes interviews,
historic pieces or visions of the fu
ture. This section is the most versa
tile. It includes any type of article or
information that does not fit neatly
in the other two sections.
According to Olsen, writers who
attend meetings for one quarter and
produce an article become staff
writers. "However, many of our
writers choose to become editors
and continue to write," he added.
"We recruit writers at the begin
ning of every issue cycle. Excep
tional staff writers are asked to
edit." Olsslen said. "Editors who
bring out the best in writers find it
rewarding and typically stay on for
the next issue."
Next year, SSR will be develop
ing awards to reward those who
exhibit a high caliber of writing
and editing or strong leadership in
the publication.
SSR's target readers are science
and engineering students, under
graduate and graduate, as well as
undeclared or humanities students
interested in developments in sci
ence, engineering, or medicine.
Its online Web site, however,
has been instrumental in drawing
an international audience.
"Content-wise, what goes on at
Stanford is very often news to the
rest of the world, especially in the
areas of science and technology
that can have real impacts on
people's daily lives," Olsen point
ed out.
"When an editor of Nature
Magazine in London saw our Web
site and requested issues of the
magazine, we knew that the mag
azine would have an audience on
campus and perhaps beyond
Stanford," Olsen said. He be
lieves the SSR may yet appear at
universities and magazine stands
across the nation in the not-so-dis
tant future.
"You don't need to be a pro
fessional writer, just an under
graduate or graduate student at
Stanford," Olsen said. "Writing

for SSR is an interactive experi
ence that gives you the boost to
explore a topic and the guidance
to create an article with high in
tegrity even if you have not writ
ten much before."
Next fall, members of the SSR
will be the first in line to begin an
international collaboration with
students at Uppsala University in
Sweden. "People come from
across the globe to attend or do
research at Stanford," Olsslen
said. "Through new technology at
Wallenberg Hall, we can inter
face with them directly, collabo
rating virtually and in real time to
create innovative content with
global significance."
At this point, all of SSR's ex
penditure is on printing costs. The
Human Biology Binham Fund for
Student Innovation provided ini
tial funding. Since then. SSR has
had contributions from a diverse
set of departments and adminis
trative offices across campus. SSR
also obtained special fees for next
year, which will be used to cover
two-thirds of its basic publishing

costs. It will be expanding into
advertising to meet the other
third of its costs.
SSR doubled circulation to
meet the high demand among un
dergraduates and graduates
when all of copies of the first issue
with "Do Not Remove" stickers
were taken from departments and
lounges we they distributed to.
"We are still finding the opti
mal amount." Olsen said. "In the
most recent issue, we kept close
track of our distribution and
found that 4,500 copies is just
enough to meet the undergradu
ate demand at the moment given
the wide breadth of our niche on
campus and our appeal to stu
dents affiliated with science and
engineering. We also printed an
additional 200 issues for faculty."
"Our primary responsibility
has been to provide enough
copies for undergrads. Our cur
rent circulation is not yet enough
to provide for graduate students
and alumni who frequently ask
for copies, so we still have some
room to grow," he added.
