# MIT and Stanford partner up for a Venture Lab
## 
### JOHN SHAPIRO STAFF WRITER 
MIT/Stanford Venture Lab monthly
events provide students an opportunity to
network with entrepreneurs, venture capi
talists and industry professions as well as
bring great speakers to campus. Last week's
program: "Auction IPO: Leveling the Play
ing Field" presented an alternative to the
typical initial public offering strategy.
While the Internet popularized stock
market investing, average investors still can
not easily purchase IPO shares. The pro
gram discussed alternatives.
"I think the conventional system is cor
rupt," said panelist Patrick Byrne, chairman
and CEO of Overstock.com. "In the late '90s
there were bankers allocating guaranteed
profits and taking kickbacks from the fund
managers. [Companies] were brought public
at artificially low prices."
Byrne used the Auction IPO process
when taking his company public. Others
were more skeptical of the process.
"I think it's unlikely [that I will participate
in an Auction IPO deal,]" said panelist John
Jarve, managing director at Menlo Ventures.
"The investment bankers we generally use to
take our companies public do not use the

Open IPO process. This is an anomaly in the
investment banking industry."
Last month's VLAB was etitled "Concept
to Company in Challenging Times." Voltage
Security, a company founded by Stanford un
dergraduates, served as a case study.
"We had some great founders who were
students of [CS professor| Dan Boneh." said
speaker Sathvik Krishnamurthy, Voltage
president and CEO. "This was a Stanford in
vention and was licensed from the Office ot
Technology and Licensing. They entered the
BASES E-Challenge and won."
Krishnamurthy commented on the cur
rent roles the founders play.
"They wear many hats, as good founders
will do," he said. "Their day jobs are very
much as architects and engineers. They are
also instrumental in setting the direction
and culture of the company. They are part of
my staff, so they actually have daily operat
ing roles."
Rishi Kacker, one of the founders, de
scribed how Voltage originated.
"So we started pursuing [the idea for the
company], talked to a lot of people and got
a lot of positive feedback," he said. "We de
cided we wanted to work on it full time, but
we had to finish up [at Stanford]. The final
investors in our company were late round
judges in the BASES competition. After we

won it, we graduated and started looking
for funding."
Moderator Ann Winblad, partner at
Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, spoke
about the current venture climate.
"There are early stage companies get

ting funding," she said. "There are a
smaller number of them, so the bar has
gotten higher. Venture capitalists are syn
dicating deals."
The amount of funding given a seed stage
company depends on its particular needs.
"Each company is different and we take
a look at what it will take to get them to a
risk reduction step," Winblad said.
Panelist Sameer Cihandi. partner at Se
quoia Capital, agreed.
"We're happy to do a couple hundred
dollars to $1 million fora seed type invest
ment," he said. "We don't have a require
ment for how much money to invest. As little
as possible is fine by us. We'd rather see
things earlier than later."
He was also optimistic about the outlook
for companies looking for funding.
"This is actually a really good time to
start a company," Ghandi said. "There is
a select number of firms out there en
gaged, active vigorously pursuing early
stage opportunities."
Ghandi graduated from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business in 1994 and is
eager to return to share his experiences.
"The GSB hugely influenced my career,
and I would not be in the venture business
had it not been for the GSB experience
here mostly through events like this,"he

said. "When 1 get the chance to come back
and talk to entrepreneurs and students, 1
like doing it and do it all the time."
John Mullaly, an IBM executive, who is
based in New York, made the event part of
his visit to California.
"I was coming out to meet with an asso
ciate who is based in Menlo Park, and we
made an evening out to the event."he
said. "We were very impressed with the
event tonight."
Chris Hadsell, general partner at Cardi
nal Venture Capital, enjoys meeting others
at the events he attends.
"I've been to a number of VLAB events
and typically I look for meeting
entrepreneurs, touching base with other
venture capitalists I know and [talking with]
people in the industry I come to see."
he said.
Hadsell remarked on the kinds of peo
ple he looks for when funding companies.
"Passionate people will find good ideas
and make things happen," he said. "Win
ners are excited about what they're doing.
It's so hard, because you want an en
trepreneur to have blinders so when they
hear all the 'no's,' they're go right down the
path and ignore the 'no's,' but then they
have to magically know when to take them
off and take advice."
