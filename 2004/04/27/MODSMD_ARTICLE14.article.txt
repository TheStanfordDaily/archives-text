## OP-ED Nothing new about outsourcing 
### ALVIN RABUSHKA 
Outsourcing — the subject of
intense controversy this election
year — is blamed for the loss of
jobs in the United States. But
outsourcing should be nothing
new to Americans. Since the
founding and development of
America was the result of En
glish outsourcing in the 17th and
18th centuries.
James I was crowned king of
England in 1603. At that time, his
fledgling nation of some 4.2 mil
lion people was beginning to
compete with its more populous,
wealthy and powerful Spanish
and French rivals. A century
later, England was able to chal
lenge its rivals for control of the
New World.
By 1764, England had defeat
ed both France and Spain in
North America and controlled
the Atlantic coast inland to the
Appalachian Mountains. A cen
tury later, England had become
the world's dominant commer
cial and military power. Its rise
from precarious island nation to
global giant followed its out
sourcing of people and produc
tion to America.
By 1682, with the founding of
Pennsylvania. England con
trolled 12 colonies along the At
lantic Coast and others in Canada
and the Caribbean. Outsourcing
of free and indentured migrants

made up the first generation and
subsequent waves of settlers, who
increased from 350 in 1610 to
more than a quarter million in
1700, passing two million in 1770.
The military contributions of the
colonists helped England elimi
nate the threats from France and
Spain in North America.
English outsourcing of several
economic activities was produc
tive both for the colonies and for
the mother country. The Crown
forbade the growing of tobacco in
England, granting a monopoly to
Virginia planters that provided
the means of livelihood in the
most populous colony, as well as
substantial customs revenue for
the English government. The
colonists supplied furs, food
stuffs and iron to English con
sumers and manufacturers.
In the late 17th century, Eng
land granted bounties for white
pine trees that produced masts
and bowsprits for English ves
sels. freeing England from de
pendence on unreliable Baltic
countries. Payments were also
granted for pitch, tar, potash,
rice, indigo and silk, which gen
erated jobs and income in many
of the colonies.
English capital helped under
write the expansion of agricul
ture and other productive colo
nial activities. English insurance
underwrote shipping ventures.
Royal Navy protection of Ameri

can shipping stimulated a large
shipbuilding industry in New
England, such that a third of all
English- owned vessels were
eventually built in the colonies.
In turn, colonial America pro
vided a market fora steadily
growing range of English manu
factured goods, helping to allevi
ate unemployment in England
and contributing to England's
overseas earnings. Colonial pur
chases of English products grew
in importance throughout the
18th century. Upon the conclu
sion of the French and Indian
War in 1763, England viewed the
American colonies more as mar
kets for its goods than as sources
of supply for its consumers. Al
though the two countries ulti
mately split over the issue of tax
ation. outsourcing was clearly
beneficial for both peoples.

Alvin Rabushka is the David and
Joan Traitel Senior Fellow at the
Hoover Institution and is current
ly writing a hook on the history of
taxation in colonial America. He
is the author or coauthor of more
than 20 hooks. His hooks and ar
ticles on the flat tax (with Robert
E. Hall) provided the intellectual
foundation for numerous flat tax
hills that were introduced in
Congress during the 1980s and
1990s and the proposals of several
presidential candidates in 1996
and 2000.
