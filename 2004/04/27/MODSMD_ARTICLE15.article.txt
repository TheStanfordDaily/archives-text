# JOEL STEIN WEIGHS IN
## Sleeping with 167 new best friends 
### 
My name is Joel Stein. I
live in Branner Hall.
And I'm not an RA. I
swear. They learned
their lesson when they gave me that
safety badge back in sixth grade.
An unguaranteed year can make
a man do crazy things. Things he'd
never think about otherwise. Things
that involve cooking spaghetti
naked. Things that involve talking
your roommate's girlfriend into
cleaning your bathroom. Things
that involve categories you'd find on
the $20,000 Pyramid.
Or, as the case may be, things
that involve 17-year-olds and the
sketchy title "writing tutor."
I was a desperate man last spring.
And when I saw a recruiting poster
to sign my soul away to Branner
Hall, one phrase crossed my mind: a
large single. And I don't mean an
overweight available woman. Al
though that wouldn't be all that bad
at this point.
So, come May of last year, while
my 167 soon-to-be-best-friends
were proudly telling their prom
dates their SAT scores, I went down
to my local recruiter at the Center
for Teaching and Learning and de
cided to sign up on the closure ride
of a lifetime.
I had lived in Branner my fresh
man year. And I had as much inten
tion of going back there as 1 did to
my mother's womb. Even less.
Then came two claustrophobic
years in Robinson talking to my
hand-shadows, if you know what I
mean. And after two years in the
gender focus house, the grating, in
cessant reminder that the word
"babe" was inappropriate when
talking to my resident fellow some
how got to me.
The next thing 1 knew 1 was sit
ting in the RF suite, telling Kennell
how much I really liked sleeping out
for football games and playing RISK
until 5 a.m. I think I even said some

thing thinking A.R. was "neat."
I guess I decided to live in Bran
ner not just for the intellectual rigor
tutoring would give me, but because
it exemplified everything I would
miss about college life after this
year. The vim. The late night discus
sions. The overwhelming sense of
community that made the seminar
rooms a sensible alternative.
I relished the thought of it like I
relished dating my ex-girlfriend's
younger sister. Maybe not.
Because I hated freshman year. I
hated the boring conversations
about regional dialects ("Say 'or
ange' again.") I hated not knowing
anyone. I hated having superficial
conversations when I didn't know

anyone. I hated having to go to frat
parties where I didn't know anyone
except that guy from my CIV sec
tion. And, to be perfectly honest, I
hated him.
But it was too late. Once you
sign a piece of paper issued by Res
Ed, there's no turning back. Ask
Lot's wife.
The next thing I knew, it was
Sept. 24 and the kids were moving
in. And before I got out of the show
er, they had unpacked, made their
beds, put their Robert Doisneau
posters up and determined who
their best friends would be for the
next four years.
1 was, at best, an observer during
those first five weeks. I came to

Branner to relive my youth and in
stead I was watching others
obliquely flirt by squirting each
other with water guns. I almost
slugged a guy for calling me Dad.
Then I almost ran him over with my
station wagon.
After a while, I stopped noticing
it all. I stepped over people wrestling
in the hall. 1 didn't look up when a
guy called a woman "hooch." And
by week six, after all the ugliness of
the desperate, initial bonding was
done, and some of the guys began to
wear shirts in the hallways, I started
talking to them. And some of them
have interesting stories. Others have
almost feminine nipples.
Hall golf may not seem much

more fulfilling than those nights at
Kepler's and Cafe Montmartre, hut
it keeps your priorities straight. Like
checking a woman's ID before hav
ing a "heart-to-heart."
The person I was four years ago is
still there. And no matter how much
1 try to be mature and look ahead,
he keeps popping up. Especially
when I go to bed.
"Everything dies, baby, that's a
fact. But maybe everything that dies
someday comes back."
But I still wouldn't sleep with any
of them.

My name is Joel Stein. I
live in Branner Hall.
And I'm not an RA. I
swear. They learned
their lesson when they gave me that
safety badge back in sixth grade.
An unguaranteed year can make
a man do crazy things. Things he'd
never think about otherwise. Things
that involve cooking spaghetti
naked. Things that involve talking
your roommate's girlfriend into
cleaning your bathroom. Things
that involve categories you'd find on
the $20,000 Pyramid.
Or, as the case may be, things
that involve 17-year-olds and the
sketchy title "writing tutor."
I was a desperate man last spring.
And when I saw a recruiting poster
to sign my soul away to Branner
Hall, one phrase crossed my mind: a
large single. And I don't mean an
overweight available woman. Al
though that wouldn't be all that bad
at this point.
So, come May of last year, while
my 167 soon-to-be-best-friends
were proudly telling their prom
dates their SAT scores, I went down
to my local recruiter at the Center
for Teaching and Learning and de
cided to sign up on the closure ride
of a lifetime.
I had lived in Branner my fresh
man year. And I had as much inten
tion of going back there as 1 did to
my mother's womb. Even less.
Then came two claustrophobic
years in Robinson talking to my
hand-shadows, if you know what I
mean. And after two years in the
gender focus house, the grating, in
cessant reminder that the word
"babe" was inappropriate when
talking to my resident fellow some
how got to me.
The next thing 1 knew 1 was sit
ting in the RF suite, telling Kennell
how much I really liked sleeping out
for football games and playing RISK
until 5 a.m. I think I even said some

thing thinking A.R. was "neat."
I guess I decided to live in Bran
ner not just for the intellectual rigor
tutoring would give me, but because
it exemplified everything I would
miss about college life after this
year. The vim. The late night discus
sions. The overwhelming sense of
community that made the seminar
rooms a sensible alternative.
I relished the thought of it like I
relished dating my ex-girlfriend's
younger sister. Maybe not.
Because I hated freshman year. I
hated the boring conversations
about regional dialects ("Say 'or
ange' again.") I hated not knowing
anyone. I hated having superficial
conversations when I didn't know

anyone. I hated having to go to frat
parties where I didn't know anyone
except that guy from my CIV sec
tion. And, to be perfectly honest, I
hated him.
But it was too late. Once you
sign a piece of paper issued by Res
Ed, there's no turning back. Ask
Lot's wife.
The next thing I knew, it was
Sept. 24 and the kids were moving
in. And before I got out of the show
er, they had unpacked, made their
beds, put their Robert Doisneau
posters up and determined who
their best friends would be for the
next four years.
1 was, at best, an observer during
those first five weeks. I came to

Branner to relive my youth and in
stead I was watching others
obliquely flirt by squirting each
other with water guns. I almost
slugged a guy for calling me Dad.
Then I almost ran him over with my
station wagon.
After a while, I stopped noticing
it all. I stepped over people wrestling
