## Blacks and the GOP 
### ROBERT ZELNICK 
Each time I see the African
American community preparing to
vote overwhelmingly for the Demo
cratic presidential candidate, I recall
the warm Washington spring forty
years ago when a craggy-faced sep
tuagenarian named Everett McKin
ley Dirksen convinced his Republi
can Senate colleagues to back clo
ture on the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
which broke the southern Demo
cratic filibuster and ensured passage
of legislation triggering the "Second
Reconstruction."
In a mellifluous voice, made
more so by his penchant for belting
down a daily mixture of Ponds cold
cream and water, the minority lead
er warned Republicans not to let
segregation do what slavery had
done to its Whig ancestor.
"The Whig Party temporized,
compromised upon the issue of free
dom for the Negro," he thundered.
"That party disappeared. It deserved
to disappear. Shall the Republican
Party receive or deserve any better
fate if it compromises upon the issue
of freedom for all men."
The list of conservative Republi
cans who heeded Dirksen was im
pressive, particularly with Senator
Barry Goldwater, the party's presi
dential candidate, opposing the bill.
Only six Republicans joined the
twenty-two Democrats against clo
ture. But this was no aberration. In
the 26 major civil rights bills to come

before the Congress between 1933
and 1964, a majority of Democrats
voted "nay" more than 80 percent of
the time while Republican majori
ties voted "aye" more than 96 per
cent of the time.
Yet following passage of the Civil
Rights Act and the following year's
Voting Rights Act, the steady march
of black voters to the Democratic
camp, which began during the Roo
sevelt years, became a stampede. In
1960, for example, Richard Nixon
won nearly a third of the black vote.
In recent presidential elections that
number has sunk to about 10 per
cent, a figure George W. Bush will
be lucky to achieve this year.
Why? Liberal suggestions that
Republicans inherited the cause of
racism, previously championed by
southern Democrats, lack empirical
support. Most segregationist
Democrats remained Democrats.
The new southern Republicans
were mainly refugees from the
North, passionate about low taxes
and non-union labor, not keeping
the races apart.
Over the next 20 to 30 years, the
civil rights legislation, coupled with
the ascendancy of sun-belt Republi
can conservatives, turned what had
effectively been a four party system
into a two party system. The parties
divided along internally homoge
nous ideological lines. Conservative
southern Democrats and liberal
northern Republicans became en
dangered species.

The African-American political
leadership opted fora Democratic
party wedded to broad welfare pro
grams, a K-12 educational system
dominated by the teachers unions,
racial entitlements in education,
public contracting and employment
and social insurance monopolized
by government. The Republican is
sues — investment-stimulating tax
policies, schools with standards, an
emphasis on domestic and national
security and social policies reflect
ing traditional "family values" —
found scant black support.
For years, my sense has been
that black political leaders have
traded nominal advantage for the
real political clout that more eclec
tic political allegiance could pro
vide, and have embraced govern
ment "solutions" that impede the
next great wave of African-Ameri
can progress.
Everett Dirksen knew the way. It
is not the Republicans who are lost.
