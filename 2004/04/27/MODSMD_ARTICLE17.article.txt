BS corrects record,
claims lack of sobriety
In last Friday's article on the
elections ("ASSU race heats up
with new candidates," April 23),
writer Jessica Wang quoted Tam
Vo as saying that her slate, BS
TV, is "sober. So we've got that on

The Chappie."
As the "BS" in the BS-TV slate,
I would like to correct the record
and say that I, for one, am not
sober. Not by any definition of the
word. I'm not even sober right now.
I am deeply saddened that The
Daily, an institution with which I
have now been involved for almost

two years, could commit such a
gross factual error.
Please print this letter in order to
correct the record and inform The
Chappie that, no, we do not even
have "that" on them.
