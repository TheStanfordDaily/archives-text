## Grams weighs in on Manning saga, San Diego's fine seafood cuisine 
### 
H. MOOG SENEI!!!!" she yells
M % into the phone, temporarily forget
m m she is the one with the
hearing problem. This translates to
"Oh, oldest mouse," a nickname that I have accept
ed as a term of endearment, and not a reflection
on my physical appearance. But you can never real
ly be sure.
You see, kids, I have a special connection with
San Diego. Thanks to annual Christmas road trips to
the land of enchiladas, beaches and wild animal
parks, I am well accustomed to the culture of the
seaside metropolis. But my family didn't pack the
Volvo just for the weather of North Tijuana. We had
a specific destination, a reason, a magnetic pull to
the South.
Arsinoe Baron, my wonderful, lovable, cheerful
Greek grandmother and longtime resident of
the southland, is the lens through which I view

San Diego.
Why dt) I bring this up? What
could a woman who says "Muchi
buchi" instead of "Mitsubishi"
possibly add to a sports column?
Well, as we all know, one of
the most intriguing stories of
the weekend has been the draft
saga of Eli Manning. He made
it patently clear to the San Diego
Chargers that he had no interest

in signing with them, was signed by them neverthe
less and was summarily traded to the New York
Football Giants.
So after our compulsory 45-second long "conver
sation" wherein Grams verifies that, yes, it is her
grandson on the other end of the phone ("Alio?
Alio? Spen. is that you? Alio? I cannot hear you!"),
I wanted to find out what the average San Diegan
felt about the Chargers' draft situation, albeit with a
heavy Greek accent.
1 started off simple. "So Grams, do you know
what sport the Chargers play?"
"You know, Spen," she responded, "I am taking a
computer class for my Sony."
Christ. In five seconds I will be troubleshooting
her Vaio from 500 miles away. Let's get the eyes on
the prize. Grams. Talk to me about the Chargers.
"What sport they play? Football."
The fact that she got this correct was mind-bog
gling to me. The lady spends most of her time faxing
me Dear Abby columns about how not to be a fail
ure, and yet nails it.
"So Grandma, your San Diego Chargers were so
bad that they got the first pick in the football draft.
Do you know what a draft is?"
"It's where you serve the country?"
"Yes, well, if you were in the army, but this
is football."
Now this is an important point to pause on. I'm
not exactly sure that at any point of this conversa
tion Grandma "understood" what the NFL draft is
in the "conventional" sense, but in order to save at
least 20 minutes of unnecessary explanation. I let
it slide.
After explaining the Eli Manning situation for
the fourth time. I asked what she thought of the kid,
and her thoughts on his hatred of San Diego.
"He is a fool! He should at least visit San Diego.
It has good weather . . . and I would take him to
Chili's! Next time he comes. I take him to the Brig
antine or D.Z. Akins. The Brigantine has good
seafood, you know."
Yes, I did know, due to the fact that she takes me
there all the time. Try the salmon.
But back to football.
"Grandma, you are now on the clock, who would
you take in the NFL Draft?"
"You!" she screamed.
What a lady. Love her.
"Great answer, Grams. But would you pick
anyone who said they didn't want to play for
your team?"
"No! But if I did pick them, whether they like it
or not, they should come; they have to come!"
"But Grams, you can t even get your grandsons
to visit San Diego," I pointed out, her constant nag
at us being that we never visit enough.
"Oh, I know! But my grandsons are too big for
their bridges!"
"Britches."
"Yes, bridges!"
"Grams, the expression is 'Too big for their britches.' 44
"Oh whatever they call, you know what I mean."
Yes Grams, yes I do.
So what's the point here? The point is, just as
Mark Thoma wrote yesterday, the NFL draft can
confuse even the most dedicated sports fan. So much
emphasis is placed on 40 times, 40-inch verts and
"character" that it becomes, like "Bring It On," a
parody of itself.
I mean, the whole Eli Manning debacle was a
total boondoggle for San Diego. Thanks to good ol'
fashioned Southern arrogance, the Chargers got the
same value at quarterback plus three picks from the
Giants. Nevermind that, with LaDanian Tomlinson,
Marty Schottenheimer should be beaten with a
lightning bolt if they throw more than 15 times a
game. Sure enough, with their third round pick from
the Giants, the Bolts selected an offensive tackle for
LaDanian to run through.
Maybe it's just me, but I smell a comeback for the
Chargers. Then again, it may just be Grandma's dolma.

Spencer Porter, a junior, loves his grandmother very
much, and will visit her as soon as possible, really.
Tell him what you think of Arsinoe at porters@stan
ford.edu. Oh, and. . . Bret who?
