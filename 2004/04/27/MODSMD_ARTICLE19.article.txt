# Stanford looks to buck Broncos
## 
### SCOTT ALLEN DESK EDITOR 
Rested and relaxed after an off day fol
lowing a two-game split with Sacramento
State, Stanford (31-6) returns to the diamond
tonight fora non-conference game at Santa
Clara (19-23).
Stanford's vaunted offense should be par
ticularly well-rested — and eager to bounce
back — after being limited to just four singles
in a 2-1 upset loss in Sacramento on Saturday.
If the Cardinal is to get back in the win col
umn tonight with a weekend conference se
ries against Washington State looming, it will
be as much due to its hurlers putting round
numbers on the scoreboard as to its heavy
hitters putting up crooked numbers as they
have all season.
"It all gets down to pitching," said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess. "You don't
have a lot of losing streaks if you have pretty
good pitching."
While the offense has received a lot of
attention during the Cardinal's record-set
ting start — which has yet to include back
to-back losses — Stanford's pitching has
been better than "pretty good" of late.
Since an 11-8 win at Oregon State on April
8, the staff has allowed less than three runs
per game.
The trend continued against the Hornets,
as sophomore Mark Romanczuk gave up
one run in eight innings of work on Friday
and sophomore Jeff Gilmore, despite pick
ing up the loss, gave up just two hits in six in
nings on Saturday.
"It doesn't matter how good you are as a
hitter, good pitching will get good hitting
out," Marquess said. "You can have the best
offensive team in the world."
Stanford found that out on Saturday
against Hornets starter Ethan Katz.
Marquess has not named a starter for
tonight's game, but one can expect the typi
cal Tuesday revolving door of relievers.
"We'll break it up," Marquess said.
"We'll use five or six guys at least, the same
as we've normally done."
Whether he decides to start freshman
Greg Reynolds after conferring with pitching
coach Tom Kunis or not. Marquess said the
freshman will see some time on the mound.
Reynolds started, went five innings and gave
up two runs on four hits last Tuesday, picking
up the win in the Cardinal's 10-5 trouncing of
Saint Mary's.
Junior Mark Jecmen and sophomore
Matt Manship worked two innings apiece

out of the bullpen last Tuesday and might
also be called upon tonight, as might fresh
men Blake Holler and Matt Leva.
Santa Clara (19-23) has swung the bats
well this season for second-year head coach
and former Stanford assistant Mark O'Brien,
but the Broncos pitching staff has struggled,
to the tune of a 6.19 ERA.
The Broncos hope the third matchup with
Stanford this season is the charm, as Santa
Clara lost the previous two games by a com
bined score of 30-7.
"Anytime you play a Stanford University,
you're playing the best in the country,"
O'Brien said. "They set the bar in college
baseball and you're going to find out a lot
about your team."
Five Cardinal pitchers combined to limit
the Broncos to three runs on six hits the last
time Stanford and Santa Clara bumped
heads, a 12-3 Cardinal victory at Sunken Di
amond on April 13.
The Broncos are 3-3 since then and took
two-of-three from Saint Mary's in a West
Coast Conference series last weekend.
Right fielder Nic Crosta, a transfer from
Texas, was named National Player of the
Week after batting .615, blasting four home
runs and scoring six times in the series. In
Sunday's 14-6 triumph, Crosta. who is hit
ting .374 with 36 RBIs this season, went 4-
for-5 with two home runs, three runs scored
and eight RBIs.
Junior first baseman Will Thompson is
tied with Crosta for the team lead in home
runs with eight and is hitting .324 with 31
RBIs. The Broncos are 5-12 away from home
but 13-9 at Buck Shaw Stadium this season.
Five of the Cardinal's six losses have come on
the road.
For Stanford, seniors Brian Hall and Sam
Fuld will look to ignite new hitting streaks
after their runs of 21 and 12 games, respec
tively, came to an end on Saturday.
Given Sunday's day of rest. Marquess
does not plan to give any Cardinal regulars
the night off. Junior catcher Donny Lucy
should be in the starting lineup after being
given the past two Tuesdays off.
Injured third baseman Jonny Ash will likely
be out for at least two weeks and then be re-ex
amined, according to Marquess. Hall moved
from his usual position in right field and started
at third in both games last weekend.
"[Hall] played well," Marquess said. "He
made some great plays on Saturday and 1 was
very pleased with that. I've got some flexibil
ity there, which is good."
The first pitch tonight is scheduled for 6 p.m.


ADRIAN GAITAN/The Stanford Daily
Senior Brian Hall had his career-high 21 -game hit streak snapped in Saturday's
2-1 loss at Sacramento State. Hall and the No. 2 Cardinal look to rebound
tonight in a non-conference game at Santa Clara.
