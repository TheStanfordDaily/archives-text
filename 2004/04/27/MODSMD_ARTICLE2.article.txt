# NYU corporate law scholar named first Pritzker Professor
## 
### ANDREW HENDEL STAFF WRITER 
Nationally renowned corporate-law scholar Robert Daines
will join the Stanford faculty as the first Pritzker Professor of
Law and Business. Daines, whose work focuses on the legal as
pects of corporate practice, will hold a professorship at Stan
ford's Law School and a courtesy appointment at the Graduate
School of Business.
"In an era when corporate governance is being closely scru
tinized by the public, it is more important than ever to have
sound empirical knowledge of how corporations really operate
and how corporate law can help them operate better," said
Stanford Law Dean Kathleen Sullivan to the Stanford Report.
"Daines has done path-breaking research that contributes
enormously to this effort, and is an ideal choice to train the next
generation of our students."
According to Daines, his most famous research analyzed the

impact or incorpora
tion in Delaware on
a firm's market valu
ation. Over 50 per
cent of corporations
are headquartered
in Delaware because
of legal advantages.
Working with
Stanford Law Prof.
Michael Klausner,
Daines also found
that a lot of firms
making initial pub
lic offerings include
strong anti-take
over measures in
their corporate
charter. According
to Klausner, this
finding ran counter
to two common as
sumptions of many
academics — that
charters were struc
tured to maximize
shareholder value
and that anti-take

over measures impair firm value.
Klausner and Daines are now completing a study of corpo
rate spin-offs.
"We find that [anti-takeover protections] are even more
prevalent in these companies," Klausner said. "It appears
that management is protecting itself, rather than enhancing
shareholder value, when it creates governance structures for
spin-offs."
Daines graduated from Brigham Young University
with a degree in economics and American studies in
1989 and from Yale Law School in 1992. Daines, a fa
ther of five children, said he is eager to see the Tree and
watch Stanford sporting events. He has had season tick
ets to Stanford basketball games for two years even
though he just now accepted Stanford's offer.
"I'm thrilled to join Stanford," Daines told the Stanford
Report. "It's is a wonderful place — preeminent law and
business schools, a distinguished university and great place
to raise a family. I'm honored to be the first Pritzker Pro
fessor and looking forward to 30 years of law and business
at Stanford.''
