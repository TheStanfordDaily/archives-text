# Top-ranked women capture three titles
## 
### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
You win some, you lose some, and you won't be
shocked that the No. 1 Stanford women's tennis team
(23-0) brought home three titles at this weekend's Pa
cific-10 Conference Individual Championships in Ojai
Valley, Calif.
This season, as in recent years, winning handily
has become the default, and winning in a pinch the
exception.
In their first time competing together all year, junior
Erin Burdette and sophomore Alice Barnes teamed up
in the main draw to clinch the doubles title over Cali
fornia's No. 13 tandem of Raquel Kops-Jones and Jieun
Jacobs, 8-6.
Meanwhile, it was a Stanford shutout in the Pac-10
invitational bracket, as freshman Anne Yelsey swept
the invitational singles title against the Golden Bears'
Jessica Shu, 6-0, 6-1. In invitational doubles, freshman
Theresa Logar and junior Story Tweedie-Yates defeat
ed Southern California's Bernadette Bayani and Melis
sa Esmero, 8-4.
There was a fourth title up for grabs, the Pac-10
Championship singles title — which Stanford has won
nine of the last 18 times — but the title proved elusive
Sunday at Libbey Park.
The 9:30 a.m. decision ended with No. 10 Barnes
falling to top-ranked Kops-Jones in straight sets, 6-3,6-4.
Despite coming up short of final victory, the old
adage holds true for the Cardinal.
Indeed, you win some and you lose some.
"Raquel has one of the very best overheads in col
lege tennis, if not the best," Barnes said. "I was having
trouble just finding ways to pass her because my normal
passing game [involves] quite a bit of lobbing and play
ing softer shots in front of people. But Raquel's really
quick around the court, and she closed in on the net
very quickly."
Kops-Jones (28-6) has had a landmark senior sea
son, capturing two individual titles and hovering in the
top four slots in the rankings all year.
Barnes (33-6), who has dropped only one dual
match decision in her collegiate career, is still feel
ing confident after her remarkably solid run in Ojai
this weekend. Barnes won handily in the semifinals
over the Women of Troy's No. 43 Anca Anastasiu,
6-1,6-4.
While Barnes had an opportunity to rest after retir
ing UCLA's No. 33 Daniela Bercek in the quarterfinals,
Anastasiu was no doubt exhausted after staging a three
set upset in the quarterfinals over the defending Pac-10
champion, Oregon's No. 11 Daria Panova, 4-6,6-0,6-3.
Barnes also rebounded from a challenging quarterfi
nal, where endurance was the name of the game as she
pushed past Oregon's No. 72 Dominika Dieskova, 5-7,6-
1,6-1.
"My defensive game can get to people," Barnes said.
"The girls I played in the first two rounds were defi
nitely big hitters who like to end the point quickly.
When I changed up my shots — adding topspin to my

forehand and slice to my backhand — and just kept re
turning theirs, it got to them mentally."
Defeat was more of a bitter pill to swallow for No. 41
Logar (31-3), who deferred to Panova (31-12) in the
second round of the tournament, 6-2,6-2.
"Inadequate would be the word of choice in describ
ing my match," Logar said. "There was a string of four
games where I was just praying that I would at least get
a ball in the court. My game did not show up for the
match. I was there mentally, but my game was off in
Tahiti just chilling."

Overwhelming would be the word of choice in de
scribing Logar's transition from the court where she
warmed up and quickly shut down first-round oppo
nent, Kelly Perry of Arizona, 6-1,6-2, to the unfamiliar,
shadowy court where she played Panova.
Panova. a junior, owns two individual titles this sea
son and made it clear early in the match that mislead
ing lighting conditions would not throw off her base
line game.
"I was setting up points very well, but in terms of ex
ecution, I messed up completely," Logar said.
After being defeated in the quarterfinals by Kops-
Jones, 6-3, 6-3, No. 28 Burdette (23-4) regained confi
dence in the doubles arena.

With neither Burdette's nor Barnes' regular-sea
son doubles partners attending Pac-lOs, their pairing
happened rather by chance. As it turned out, Bur
dette's power game and Barnes' finesse were perfect
complements.
Just four matches later, the unexpected duo earned
a No. 15 ranking in the nation.
"We meshed well together, and our communication
more than made up for our lack of previous experience
together," Burdette said.
Added Barnes: "One great thing I found out from

playing doubles this weekend was that I'm going to
start playing the advantage side of court. I have a bet
ter backhand volley and my forehand crosscourt re
turn is sometimes late, which actually works perfectly
when you're trying to get it away from the net player
on that side."
As Stanford pulls into the home stretch before
NCAA Championships, nothing stands between the
Cardinal and the Athens. Ga.,competition expect prac
tice, practice and more practice.
"I've got two weeks before NCA As to figure [every
thing] out." Logarsaid. "I probably should be setting up
a cot in the locker room, because I'm going to be out on
the courts all the time."
