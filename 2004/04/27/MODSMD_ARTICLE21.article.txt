### KAIYA REEVE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five rounds, five opponents,
five wins.
After four days of grueling matches
at the Pacific-10 Conference tennis
championships, Sam Warburg is the
Pac-10 singles champion.
The Stanford junior began the 2003-
2004 tennis season with a No. 71 presea
son ranking and has steadily worked his
way up to an impressive No. 11 status in
the latest Intercollegiate Tennis Associ
ation listings.
"I didn't expect [to win], but it was
something I hoped for," Warburg said.
Warburg is the ninth Stanford player
to earn the Pac-10 title since the tourna
ment's inception in 1987.
His title run began on Thursday when
he went up against Oregon's Markus
Schilie. Warburg grabbed the first
round match win, 6-2, 7-5. Only hours
later, he jumped into second-round
play, taking an easy 6-4, 6-2 win against
Southern California's Ruben Torres.
On Friday, Warburg took to the
courts against Patrick Briaud of Cali
fornia. Briaud took the first set of the
quarterfinal match after a close
tiebreaker, but Warburg went on to
capture the next two sets easily, winning
6-7 (4), 6-1, 6-4.
Next up for Warburg was UCLA's
Chris Lam. The Saturday morning semi
final match was over in two sets, as War
burg claimed a 6-4, 6-4 win.
In the finals, Warburg went up
against USC's No. 31 Adriano Biasella.
The two met in Stanford's last dual
match of the season last weekend, with
Warburg taking a three-set victory. It
only took two matches to capture the
win this time, as Warburg gathered a 7-
6, 6-3 championship victory.
"I've played [Biasella] three times
this year, once at USC when I lost to him

and once here [at Stanford] when it was
a close match," Warburg said. "This
time, I had a set game plan on what I was
going to do, and those two matches
helped me execute it well. [Associate
head coach] John Whitlinger and I
talked a lot about what I needed to do to
be successful against him."
In the invitational singles rounds, se
nior team captain Carter Morris climbed
his way up to the finals, where he fell to
UCLA's Chris Surapol, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
After receiving a first round-bye, the
Stanford senior defeated Nicholas Weiss
of Washington, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4. He then
moved on to take down Oregon's Aaron
Spencer, 6-0, 6-3. In the semifinals. No.
99 Philipp Gruendler of UCLA put up a
strong fight, but let go in the third set to
give Morris a 7-6, 7-6 (4), 6-0 victory.
Sophomore Ail-American K.C. Cork
ery and sophomore James Pade also
made a showing in the finals, but were
cut short of the doubles championship
title. The Stanford duo took an 8-5 win
over Oregon's No. 40 Aaron Spencer
and Sven Swinnen, and then claimed an
other 8-5 victory against Washington's
Daniel Chu and Alex Vlaski. Corkery /
Pade moved on to take yet another 8-5
win over Arizona State's Jonathon Kin
sella and Chris Stewart in the semifinals,
but lost a heartbreaking 8-3 match to
Philipp Gruendler and Luben Pam
poulov in the finals.
It was an all-Stanford final in the in
vitational doubles event. Freshmen Eric
McKean and Chris Rasmussen took on
junior Phil Sheng and freshman James
Wan.
McKean / Rasmussen advanced to
the final by knocking off Washington's
Chris Floyd and Michael Ricks, 8-5, in
the semifinals. The duo defeated Ore
gon's Eric Pickard and Vladmir Pino, 9-
8 (7-3), in the opening round before
taking the quarterfinal match over
UCLA's Lam / Surapol by way of walk

over injury.
Sheng / Wan received a first-round
bye and then moved on to take an easy
8-2 win over Kuni Minato and John Pet
tit of Cal. In the semifinals, the Cardinal
tandem claimed an 8-4 victory over
Thomas Bieri and Chris King of Oregon
to set up the all-Cardinal final.
It was a tough match, but the duo of
Sheng and Wan slid past the freshmen
team. 8-5, and claimed the invitational
doubles title.
"I didn't do too well in singles, so I
was pretty disappointed," Sheng said.
"It was great to [bounce back]. It's been
a while since I've played with James.
There were things that James and I had
no clue about fin terms of playing to
gether], but by the end of the tourna
ment we had our stuff down."
Morris / Warburg were defeated in a
close 9-8 (10) match by Washington's
Alex Slovic and Nicholas Weiss in the
first round of the doubles draw.
In singles, Stanford's Sheng wasn't as
fortunate as in doubles, taking a 6-2, 6-3
loss from Cal's Balazs Veress in the first
round. Christoph Palmanshofer of
Washington defeated No. 61 Corkery, 6-
3, 6-2, while teammate Wan was
downed, 6-3,1-6,7-5, by UCLA's Alber
to Francis.
McKean lost, 6-3, 6-2, to Paul
Warkentin of Arizona in the first
round and senior Joe Kao received a
first-round bye but was subsequently
dealt a 6-1, 7-5 defeat by UCLA's
Aaron Yovan. Rasmussen outlasted
Oregon's Pino in the first round, 6-3,
2-6, 7-6 (7-3), but was unable to pull
through in the second round, losing, 6-
3, 6-4 to Washington's Michael Ricks.
Pade received a first-round bye but
was then defeated by Arizona State's
Daniel Davies.
