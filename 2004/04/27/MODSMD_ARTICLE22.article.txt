# Water polo passes final test before MPSF Tournament
## 
### ELIZABETH AGUILAR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's water polo squad (18-3,
10-1 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) got a
step closer to reaching the NCAA Champi
onships, as it closed out its outstanding regular
season with an 8-3 win at No. 11 San Jose State
(14-15, 4-7) on Friday.
In its final game before the MPSF Tournament
and a possible trip to NCAAs, the No. 2 Cardinal,
led by senior driver Lauren Faust, exhibited its
usual domination of lower-ranked teams.
Faust got the Cardinal on the board with a goal
in the first period off a new 6-on-5 set the team has
been practicing to give Stanford the early lead.
"The passes were all there and it just came to
gether," Faust said.
But Stanford had no time to enjoy the goal. The
Spartans' leading scorer, junior Laura Scott, who

ends the season with 42 goals, tied the game 11
seconds later.
Stanford regained the lead, 2-1, when freshman
two-meter Christina Hewko put the ball into the
cage at the end of the first period.
The second period defined the game as the Car
dinal extended its lead to 5-2 and never looked
back. Junior two-meter Kelty Luber, senior two
meter defender Wendy Watkins and sophomore
driver Laurel Champion all scored and put the
game out of reach for San Jose State, despite
Katie Morgan's lone goal in the period.
The Spartans had a small window of opportuni
ty to get back into the game in the third. Stanford
was held scoreless until freshman two-meter de
fender Alison Gregorka pushed one past the Spar
tans' Michelle Rozzen.
Unfortunately for San Jose, the Stanford de
fense did not slack off in its final game. Stan
ford performed as it has throughout most of the

season, holding the lead by preventing scoring
opportunities for its opponents, and did espe
cially well against the aggressive style the Spar
tans play.
After Meridith McColl, who leads MPSF goal
keepers in goals-against-average, left in the fourth
period with seven saves, San Jose State's Faviola
Del Real managed to squeeze a goal past sopho
more Amanda Matuk.
"Playing San Jose was all about one-on-one de
fense," Faust said. "That got us one step closer to
where we needed to be, because defense is what's
going to win games for us."
San Jose State also took advantage of the final
game to give two goalkeepers a chance to play,
with Rozzen replacing the starting Megan Corco
ran early in the match.
In the end, Stanford's goalkeepers and its strat
egy prevailed. The Cardinal secured the win with
two goals in the fourth from junior Hannah Luber

and another from Faust.
"My second goal just worked out really well be
cause the passes were perfect and everybody was
where they needed to be," Faust said. "If you get
a good pass, it's your job to put the ball away."
Stanford extended its winning streak to five
games and carries some momentum into the
MPSF Tournament next week, at which it could
earn a spot in next month's NCAAs. Either way,
Friday's win may have already wrapped up the at
large berth for the Cardinal.
A loss to a lower-ranked team like San Jose
Stante would have devastated the team's chances
for the at-large berth.
"We wanted to be strong no matter who we
were playing," Faust said. "We're ready for
MPSFs."
The Spartans settle for the eighth seed at next
weekend's MPSF tournament, while the Cardinal
will be the second seed.
