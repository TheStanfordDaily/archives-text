# Women's lax honors seniors, falls to Loyola in home finale
## 
### CARLING NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 20 Stanford women's lacrosse team paid
tribute to its seniors on Saturday at Maloney Field
before falling to No. 5 Loyola College, 16-8.
While the Cardinal (8-7, 4-0 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) could not tally a win in its home
finale, Saturday's effort showcased how the newer
members of the team are beginning to step into the
spotlight in preparation for the absence of the six se
niors who are leaving after this season.
The Cardinal's young talent was on display late in
the game when freshman attacker Michelle
DeChant spotted and passed to midfielder and fel
low freshman Liz Piselli, who then found the back of
the net from the left side of the arc to cut Loyola's
lead to 15-7,
The Greyhounds were off and running at the be
ginning of the game, though, scoring six unanswered
goals before Stanford sophomore Megan Burker
was able to reply with an unassisted goal 19 minutes
into the first period.
"Loyola pushed the pace of the game early," said
Stanford head coach Michele Uhlfelder. "They were
concentrating on coming out big in the heat."
Trailing 8-1 at the half, Stanford tried to work its
way onto the scoreboard, but its efforts proved futile
as Loyola opened the second half just as it had the
first, with six straight goals.
"Our shot selection wasn't very good," Uhlfelder
said. "Their defense busted down and created a lot
of confidence."
At 14:35, senior Kim Cahill put an end to the Grey
hounds' scoring streak and netted Stanford's first
goal of the second period, making the score 14-2.
Cahill's goal triggered six more Cardinal goals
in the final 15:00. Burker, assisted by junior Julia
Calzonetti, scored her 24th goal of the season with

just under 11:00 left in the period. A couple of min
utes later, Julia's twin, junior Claire Calzonetti,
netted her 10th goal of the season to bring the
score to 14-4.
After a Loyola goal increased the gap to 11, goals
by Julia Calzonetti and junior Kelsey Twist, along
with Piselli's goal, helped decrease Loyola's lead to
15-7.
While Stanford out-shot Loyola, 29-26, the Car
dinal did not seem completely at ease until the last
20 minutes or so of the game.
"We were a little hesitant at times and didn't put
all of our heart into coming up with the draws,"
Uhlfelder said. "They attacked some of those weak
nesses. However, when we felt like we didn't have
anything to lose, we had our moments of brilliance."
As the season draws to an end, Stanford faces No.
3 Georgetown in Washington, D.C., on Saturday in
the seniors' last game of the regular season.
Among Stanford's six seniors are midfielder
Abbi Hills, who leads the team with 30 goals and has
also tallied six assists, and goalie Christina Saikus,
who has tallied 131 saves this season and is eighth in
the nation in save percentage.
Reminiscing about her time on the Farm,
Saikus said, "It's been a great four years. We've
seen so much change in the program, and it's just
going to get better and better. There's a big future
for this program."
Uhlfelder feels the same way about the team's
younger generation.
"When there are expectations on them, they are
starting to be more consistent," she said. "They're
very capable and some of them are starting to break
out. They have the ability to be sparks."
This weekend, Stanford hopes that the young
guns will be able to spark and continue their special
chemistry with the seniors en route to a victory
over Georgetown.
