## U. Colorado looks into football team misconduct allegations 
### MEAGAN BALINK COLORADO DAILY 
(U-WIRE) BOULDER, Colo.
— University of Colorado Indepen
dent Investigative Commission C'o-
Chair Peggy Lamm became frustrat
ed with CU Athletic Director
Richard Tharp Friday over his lack
of foresight concerning "aberrant"
behavior by CU football players in
the past.
The commission, charged with
investigating the University of Col
orado recruiting scandal, ques
tioned Tharp, CU Director of Sports
Medicine Steve Willard and Boul
der police officer Don Spicely last
Friday.
Lamm said she was frustrated
that Tharp simply added more "fig
leaves" in the situation.
"You have continually received
all of these suggestions that might
work and you choose not to follow
them," said Lamm. "Your response
seems to be adding more rules
more fig leaves to cover up what is
happening."
Tharp often responded to the
commissioners' questions in elo
quent and lengthy explanations of
rules and his endorsement of behav
ioral changes.
"In retrospect, that may be a fair
judgment," Tharp said. "All I can
say is that during the time (when
those decisions were made)... you
feel like there's a trust. I don't want
to disavow responsibility for some
thing I should have done."
Commissioner Jacqueline St.
Joan and others questioned Tharp
extensively about a 2001 Gender
Equity Report that showed female
staff were mostly unhappy with their
treatment as employees of the CU
Athletic Department.
"Well over half of department
says the 'good old boy' network is
very strong," said St. Joan, reading
comments from the report. "There
are few females in decision-mak
ing. (Women) feel like whenever
there is extra, money is being kept
back (from their salaries) . . .
there are complaints of women
about the football program and

lack of gender equity."
Tharp responded that the 2001
study was an interim study and the
next certification by the NCAA
would take place in 2005. "We have
a gender equity committee," he said,
noting that the department had to
discuss what changes needed to hap
pen before any could take place.
Commissioners questioned
Tharp about a 1998 meeting that
took place between CU officials and
the Boulder District Attorney's of
fice after a 17-year-old woman al
leged a CU football player raped her
during a recruiting weekend in 1997.
In depositions taken for Lisa
Simpson's Title IX lawsuit against
the university alleging CU promot
ed an environment of sexual harass
ment and discrimination, Keenan
testified that she put CU Athletic
Director Dick Tharp and CU-Boul
der Chancellor Richard Byyny "on
notice" at the meeting that the
D.A.'s office would be watching
CU's recruiting practices and athlet
ics department.
In their depositions, Tharp and
Byyny both said they didn't recall
the words "on notice" being used,
and both denied that the discussion
resulted in CU being given an offi
cial warning.
Tharp said the meeting was sim
ply to discuss concerns about "aber
rant behavior" such as binge drink
ing and allegations of sexual assault.
However, commission co-chair
Peggy Lamm said the commission
received documents from Chancel
lor's Assistant Joey White, who also
attended the 1998 meeting, that
shed more light into the actual con
tent of the discussion.
The commission later questioned
Steve Willard.
Willard said head football coach
Gary Barnett was supportive of a
woman who claimed a football play
er raped her in 2001 in a meeting be
tween the three following the al
leged event.
Barnett was suspended from the
university in part because of contro
versy surrounding his comment to
the woman that he would "support
my player 100 percent."

Willard, who was the woman's
supervisor in the athletic depart
ment, told the lIC that the woman
had called the meeting between with
Barnett to get him to make the play
er understand what he did was
wrong, and during the meeting, Bar
nett offered all the support he could.
The woman, whom commission
co-chair Peggy Lamm identified as
"Jane Doe," had a different memo
ry of the meeting, according to a let
ter she wrote to the commission. In
the letter, she said she did not press
charges against the player because
Barnett intimidated her into re
maining quiet.
"I do remember thinking
throughout the meeting I was a little
shocked that she didn't want more
in terms of punishment," Willard
told the commission. "I felt like she
would have more insistence on jus
tice — he would pay for what had
occurred."
Commissioners asked Willard if
he remembered Barnett saying, if
the situation became "he said, she
said," Barnett would support his
player 100 percent.
"He said, 'Now I need to tell you
if he doesn't 'fess up to what you are
saying, I will need to support my
player,'" said Willard. "I said, you
know, I would support her 100 per
cent for the same reasons."
Willard told Lamm that he saw
how the meeting's environment, in
the head coach's office, could have
had an intimidating tone, but "I
didn't take the conversation to have
an intimidating tone."
Lamm pressed Willard, noting
that the alleged victim said she felt
like if she did anything but "follow
along" and have the player receive
treatment, her "life would change."
"She has a strong ring of credi
bility," said Lamm. "She did
everything she said she would do .
. . she reported the same things to
police. Do you see this gives her
substantial credibility?"
Willard said his conversations
with Jane Doe did not match the let
ter she sent to the commission. "We
handled the situation exactly ac
cording to her wishes," he said.

noting that the department had to
discuss what changes needed to hap
pen before any could take place.
Commissioners questioned
Tharp about a 1998 meeting that
took place between CU officials and
the Boulder District Attorney's of
fice after a 17-year-old woman al
leged a CU football player raped her
during a recruiting weekend in 1997.
In depositions taken for Lisa
Simpson's Title IX lawsuit against
the university alleging CU promot
ed an environment of sexual harass
ment and discrimination, Keenan
testified that she put CU Athletic
Director Dick Tharp and CU-Boul
der Chancellor Richard Byyny "on
notice" at the meeting that the
D.A.'s office would be watching
CU's recruiting practices and athlet
ics department.
In their depositions, Tharp and
Byyny both said they didn't recall
the words "on notice" being used,
and both denied that the discussion
resulted in CU being given an offi
cial warning.
Tharp said the meeting was sim
ply to discuss concerns about "aber
rant behavior" such as binge drink
ing and allegations of sexual assault.
However, commission co-chair
Peggy Lamm said the commission
received documents from Chancel
lor's Assistant Joey White, who also
attended the 1998 meeting, that
shed more light into the actual con
tent of the discussion.
The commission later questioned
Steve Willard.
Willard said head football coach
Gary Barnett was supportive of a
woman who claimed a football play
er raped her in 2001 in a meeting be
tween the three following the al
leged event.
Barnett was suspended from the
university in part because of contro
versy surrounding his comment to
the woman that he would "support
my player 100 percent."

Willard, who was the woman's
supervisor in the athletic depart
ment, told the lIC that the woman
had called the meeting between with
Barnett to get him to make the play
er understand what he did was
wrong, and during the meeting, Bar
nett offered all the support he could.
The woman, whom commission
co-chair Peggy Lamm identified as
"Jane Doe," had a different memo
ry of the meeting, according to a let
ter she wrote to the commission. In
the letter, she said she did not press
charges against the player because
Barnett intimidated her into re
maining quiet.
"I do remember thinking
throughout the meeting I was a little
shocked that she didn't want more
in terms of punishment," Willard
told the commission. "I felt like she
would have more insistence on jus
tice — he would pay for what had
occurred."
Commissioners asked Willard if
he remembered Barnett saying, if
the situation became "he said, she
said," Barnett would support his
player 100 percent.
"He said, 'Now I need to tell you
if he doesn't 'fess up to what you are
saying, I will need to support my
player,'" said Willard. "I said, you
know, I would support her 100 per
cent for the same reasons."
Willard told Lamm that he saw
how the meeting's environment, in
the head coach's office, could have
had an intimidating tone, but "I
didn't take the conversation to have
an intimidating tone."
Lamm pressed Willard, noting
that the alleged victim said she felt
like if she did anything but "follow
along" and have the player receive
treatment, her "life would change."
"She has a strong ring of credi
bility," said Lamm. "She did
everything she said she would do .
. . she reported the same things to
police. Do you see this gives her
substantial credibility?"
Willard said his conversations
with Jane Doe did not match the let
ter she sent to the commission. "We
handled the situation exactly ac
cording to her wishes," he said.

— University of Colorado Indepen
dent Investigative Commission C'o-
Chair Peggy Lamm became frustrat
ed with CU Athletic Director
Richard Tharp Friday over his lack
of foresight concerning "aberrant"
behavior by CU football players in
the past.
The commission, charged with
investigating the University of Col
orado recruiting scandal, ques
tioned Tharp, CU Director of Sports
Medicine Steve Willard and Boul
der police officer Don Spicely last
Friday.
Lamm said she was frustrated
that Tharp simply added more "fig
leaves" in the situation.
"You have continually received
all of these suggestions that might
work and you choose not to follow
them," said Lamm. "Your response
seems to be adding more rules
more fig leaves to cover up what is
happening."
Tharp often responded to the
commissioners' questions in elo
quent and lengthy explanations of
rules and his endorsement of behav
ioral changes.
"In retrospect, that may be a fair
judgment," Tharp said. "All I can
say is that during the time (when
those decisions were made)... you
feel like there's a trust. I don't want
to disavow responsibility for some
thing I should have done."
Commissioner Jacqueline St.
Joan and others questioned Tharp
extensively about a 2001 Gender
Equity Report that showed female
staff were mostly unhappy with their
treatment as employees of the CU
Athletic Department.
"Well over half of department
says the 'good old boy' network is
very strong," said St. Joan, reading
comments from the report. "There
are few females in decision-mak
ing. (Women) feel like whenever
there is extra, money is being kept
back (from their salaries) . . .
there are complaints of women
about the football program and

lack of gender equity."
Tharp responded that the 2001
study was an interim study and the
next certification by the NCAA
would take place in 2005. "We have
a gender equity committee," he said,
noting that the department had to
discuss what changes needed to hap
