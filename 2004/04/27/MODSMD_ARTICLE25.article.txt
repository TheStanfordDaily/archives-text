# Michigan students and alumni keep Naked Mile run tradition alive

### DONN M. FRESARD ANDREW MCCORMACK MICHIGAN DAILY 
(U-WIRE) ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Seeking
to keep an 18-year-old tradition alive, a group
of University of Michigan students and alumni
participated in an alternative Naked Mile run
at 11:00 p.m. Sunday night.
They evaded a police campaign against the run by
scheduling it one night early and altering the route.
All Naked Mile participants reached for comment re
quested that their last names not be printed.
About four years ago, the University began a
campaign with the Ann Arbor Police Department to
end the Naked Mile due to concerns about student
safety. During the 19905, the event had grown into a
media spectacle with the run eventually being broad
cast on the Internet.
But the runners didn't have to worry about grop
ers or cameras Sunday night. Susan, who said she
rode a bicycle while clothed to scout the course and
relayed information with the runners via cellular
phone, described the event as a success.
"The only problem we encountered was at the
corner of State Street and Washington (Street),
where a cop car pulled up, but nobody was stopped,"
she said. "We all sprinted away at that point."
The group was reportedly comprised of 13 naked
runners, two clothed bicyclists and one naked bicy
clist. Three members of the group were recent Uni
versity graduates, while the rest were students.
Runners said they took extra precautions against
police intervention by setting up safe houses and
plans to scatter if they saw a patrol.
Justifications for the run varied among the partic
ipants, with some citing personal and political ex
pression as their objective.
"I think the Naked Mile has been deteriorating,
and these grassroots efforts are the only way to bring
it back," said Adrien, a University alum who partici
pated in the run.
Danielle, a senior, said she felt the participants
acted in the true spirit of the Naked Mile.
"We ran with the heart of it, with no freaky men

with cameras," she said. "I'm not an exhibitionist."
Some runners expressed defiance toward the De
partment of Public Safety and the AAPD for what
they perceived as a crackdown on the Naked Mile.
"There isn't a single person who ran here tonight
that wasn't angry at the police," Adrien said, adding
that the runners' outrage Was caused by what they felt
was a draconian suppression of the Naked Mile."I
hope people will be inspired to do similar acts in the
next 48 hours."
Danielle expressed similar concerns with the so
cial implications of the DPS and AAPD's crackdown
on public nudity.
"It's a superficial expression, but a true one, that I
can own my body," she said.
Not all of the runners, however, described their
motivations as political. Some said it was "nice" to
end their time at college with friends.
"We got to smack our asses at Starbucks,"
Danielle said. "What could be better?"
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown said she had not
heard that a naked run would be taking place tonight,
and that DPS had scheduled patrols for tomorrow
night in anticipation of nude runners.
While running naked in public is a crime with a
$500 dollar fine and punishable for up to one year in
prison, Brown said the University's concern with the
Naked Mile is the danger students expose themselves
to if they are brave enough to run in the event.
Brown said in the past the event has often been a
hotbed for illegal activities.
"It's a mixture of drunken people, illegal behav
ior, too many people, and too many people with ill in
tentions converging."
Many times the behavior results in runners being
trampled or creating traffic accidents, Brown said.
Brown also added, "We have dangers of sexual as
sault. We had a report one year of a person in the
crowd hitting naked people with a bullwhip."
In recent years, the University has also expressed
worries on how many runners in the Naked Mile are
videotaped, DPS Director Bill Bess said.
"When there are a number of persons watching
the event, these spectators are frequently taking dig
ital photos, which may end up on the Internet or TV.
We have no control over that," he said.

trampled or creating traffic accidents, Brown said.
Brown also added, "We have dangers of sexual as
sault. We had a report one year of a person in the

In recent years, the University has also expressed
worries on how many runners in the Naked Mile are
videotaped, DPS Director Bill Bess said.
"When there are a number of persons watching
the event, these spectators are frequently taking dig
ital photos, which may end up on the Internet or TV.
We have no control over that," he said.
