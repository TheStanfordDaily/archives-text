### MELISA GAO THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
— Public Safety officers entered a
Princeton University classroom on
Friday and confiscated nearly 400
Newman's Day shirts, said universi
ty officials and students who were
present.
Following the instructions of Dean
of Undergraduate Students Kathleen
Deignan, two Public Safety officers
entered the room around 3 p.m. Fri
day and brought the shirts to
Deignan's office.
The development came after a
week of national attention on the
Newman's Day tradition — held Sat
urday — in which some students try
to drink 24 beers in 24 hours. The
lawyer of actor Paul Newman, whose
son died of a drug overdose, recently
asked the university to take measures
to stop the tradition.
With media crews on campus,
many eating clubs tightened security.
The day passed relatively quietly.
Only two or three students were sent
to University Health Services —
fewer than on an average Saturday
night. Chief Medical Officer Daniel
Silverman said. Gary Nuttall, Public
Safety acting supervisor on duty Sun

day evening, said two minor alcohol
related incidents occurred Saturday.
The students whose shirts Public
Safety confiscated said they paid
$2,000 for them and planned to sell
them during the day Saturday. One
shirt had the slogan: "If found, please
return to McCosh Health Center."
Another had a picture of Newman's
face and the quote, "24 beers in a case,
24 hours in a day. Coincidence? I
think not."
The administration learned about
the plans to sell the shirts just after
noon on Friday, when Cleland Wel
ton forwarded an advertisement for
the shirts to an e-mail list that he didn't
realize included Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Students Maria Flo
res-Mills, he said.
Less than three hours later, several
students were in a four-person suite in
1901 Hall when two Public Safety offi
cers knocked on the door, students
and Public Safely said. After being
told to enter, the officers asked to
speak with a resident of the suite.
Associate Director of Public
Safety Duncan Harrison stepped
outside with resident Taylor Bright
'05 to explain why the shirts were
being confiscated.
Harrison declined to say the rea
sons in an interview, citing privacy

concerns. But Deignan said the shirts
were confiscated because "they were
advertising a very dangerous drinking
game that the University has been
clear it does not support."
University alcohol policy states
that violations occur "when serving of
alcohol encourages excessive drink
ing (e.g. drinking games)."
Deignan called it a "reasonable ex
trapolation of the rules" to extend it to
include anything that "advertises and
promotes drinking games."
Immediately after the shirts were
taken, Bright and two other students
went to see Deignan to try to recover
the property. Deignan said the stu
dents arrived as she had her coat on
and was leaving for the day.
Bright then met with Associate
Dean of Undergraduate Students Hi
lary Herbold, who explained that the
shirts were in Deignan's office and
they could meet this morning to de
cide further action.
Deignan said Sunday she stands by
her decision to take the shirts.
"They had their opportunity not
to buy the shirts long ago, and they
made their decision in spite of what
the University says," Deignan said.
"On a Friday afternoon, this was not
something I was prepared to sit down
and negotiate about."
