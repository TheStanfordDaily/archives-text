# Motley crew runs for ASSU executive slate in special election
## 
### MICHAEL MILLER DESK EDITOR 
The special election for ASSU president and vice
president is shaping up to be livelier than the first elec
tion, which was thrown out by the ASSU Undergradu
ate Senate last week. At least six slates are on their way
to qualifying for the ballot — twice as many as in the
last election — and while most candidates are employ
ing time-tested strategies, a few groups are trying to
make a different impression. •
One slate is focusing on the community center vote.
Another slate plans on stressing an outsider, grassroots
approach. And four potential slates are relying on
humor to bring in the votes.
Senior Mikey Lee and sophomore Alyssa Schwartz
will attempt to unite the two tickets that won 84 per
cent of the vote in the first election, combining
Schwartz's experience as an ASSU senator with
Mikey's perspective as an outsider to the ASSU, hav
ing been a Senior Class president.
The two candidates know they have name recog
nition, they said, but they plan on focusing on the
same strategy both slates used last election — meet
ing with groups and administrators to address stu
dent concerns. At the same time, the Lee-Schwartz
slate must deal with the controversies that led to this
new election.
In light of the unsolicited e-mails that led to the spe
cial election, few of the slates said they felt challenged
by the fact that the winners of the last election were
running again. When asked whether it would be diffi
cult to challenge the previous winners this time around,
sophomore Mark Berghausen put his opinion humor
ously: "We ask you, 'Would it be hard to challenge the

name recognition of a Gore-Cheney campaign?' "
Juniors Charlie Stockman and Matthew Henick,
the Stanford Chaparral slate, are running a campaign
similar to their previous one.
"It's apparent that this campus doesn't necessarily
need a serious campaign but someone who can sit back
and point its finger at the cowering lamb of student
government quivering in the corner," Henick said in an
e-mail.
Unlike the last election, which was mainly seen as a
competition between an "insider" slate and an "out
sider" slate — with The Chappie providing different
ideas and comic relief — this election lacks an easily
characterized dynamic.
Sophomores Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory
Vargas Caro plan on stressing student groups in
their message — especially the Black Community
Service Center and El Centro Chicano, where they
have worked.
"We both came to this campaign not as politicians,
but as students who are running because we truly care
about Stanford," Borgelt-Mose said in an e-mail.
The freshman slate of Chris Nguyen and Matt
Buchanan is approaching the campaign with an earnest
flyering strategy and a pitch to remake Absolute Fun
into parties that more students will attend. Nguyen
won a Senate seat in the regular election two weeks
ago, and he said that his previous campaign inspired
him to run another one. Nguyen is also a writer for The
Daily.

election debacle.

their campaigns while also pointing
out more serious issues.
Berghausen says he is champi

and targeting apathy by changing
his campaign a bit from the usual
flyering.
"Rather than shoving flyers in
busy students' faces, we'll be mak
ing ourselves available with a wide
variety of novelties, snacks and en
tertainment products," he said in
an e-mail.
And while Houghton, although
claiming to have collected enough

signatures to make it on the ballot,
said his slate's plan is "to promise
[the student body] many things that
we cannot deliver."
He added in his e-mail, "They
will not find out about it because
none of them read The Daily."
Sophomores Tam Vo and Bar
rett Sheridan, both Intermission
editors at The Daily, were the
farthest from completing their
petitions, just halfway through
the 500 signatures last night. Vo,
who is the only member of the
slate collecting signatures, said
she agreed with many of the
other candidates.
"The big issue is: 'Why do we
have another election?"' she said.
"The hardest issue in petitioning was
convincing people that we're really
having a special election."

In light of the unsolicited e-mails that led to the spe
cial election, few of the slates said they felt challenged
by the fact that the winners of the last election were
running again. When asked whether it would be diffi
cult to challenge the previous winners this time around,
sophomore Mark Berghausen put his opinion humor
ously: "We ask you, 'Would it be hard to challenge the

name recognition of a Gore-Cheney campaign?' "
Juniors Charlie Stockman and Matthew Henick,
the Stanford Chaparral slate, are running a campaign
similar to their previous one.
"It's apparent that this campus doesn't necessarily
need a serious campaign but someone who can sit back
and point its finger at the cowering lamb of student
government quivering in the corner," Henick said in an
e-mail.
Unlike the last election, which was mainly seen as a
competition between an "insider" slate and an "out
sider" slate — with The Chappie providing different
ideas and comic relief — this election lacks an easily
characterized dynamic.
Sophomores Chioke Borgelt-Mose and Kory
Vargas Caro plan on stressing student groups in
their message — especially the Black Community
Service Center and El Centro Chicano, where they
have worked.
"We both came to this campaign not as politicians,
but as students who are running because we truly care
about Stanford," Borgelt-Mose said in an e-mail.
The freshman slate of Chris Nguyen and Matt
Buchanan is approaching the campaign with an earnest
flyering strategy and a pitch to remake Absolute Fun
into parties that more students will attend. Nguyen
won a Senate seat in the regular election two weeks
ago, and he said that his previous campaign inspired
him to run another one. Nguyen is also a writer for The
Daily.

Chappie slate juniors Charlie Stockman and Matt Henick pose outside the ASSU office in a quandary over the recent
election debacle.
Mann in injecting a bit of humor into
their campaigns while also pointing
out more serious issues.
Berghausen says he is champi
oning a more accountable ASSU
and targeting apathy by changing
his campaign a bit from the usual
flyering.
"Rather than shoving flyers in
busy students' faces, we'll be mak
ing ourselves available with a wide
variety of novelties, snacks and en
tertainment products," he said in
an e-mail.
And while Houghton, although
claiming to have collected enough

signatures to make it on the ballot,
said his slate's plan is "to promise
[the student body] many things that
we cannot deliver."
He added in his e-mail, "They
will not find out about it because
none of them read The Daily."
Sophomores Tam Vo and Bar
rett Sheridan, both Intermission
editors at The Daily, were the
farthest from completing their
petitions, just halfway through
the 500 signatures last night. Vo,
who is the only member of the
slate collecting signatures, said
she agreed with many of the
other candidates.
"The big issue is: 'Why do we
have another election?"' she said.
"The hardest issue in petitioning was
convincing people that we're really
having a special election."
