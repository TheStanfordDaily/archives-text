(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON —Hundreds of thou
sands of abortion rights activists flooded the National Mall
Sunday, waving signs and wearing T-shirts to display their
opposition to Bush administration policies that they said
threatened women's lives.
The March lor Women's Lives, organized by seven
leading national women's rights groups, was the largest
abortion rights demonstration in 12 years. The event
served as a venue for women and men tc criticize what
they said was a Republican effort to restrict access to
abortion procedures.
"We are determined to stop this war on women," Femi
nist Majority Executive Director Ellie Smeal said. "We say
in one voice, 'Don't mess with women because this is not a

one-day march. We are changing the future of this country
because women must he at the tables.'"
Between 500,000 and 800,000 demonstrators from
across the country attended the event. The Associated
Press reported. Diana Gordon, who traveled from Oregon
with a group of more than 200 people, said there is more
"power in numbers."
"I see a backward trend in our government," she said.
"Roe v. Wade and women reproductive freedoms are in
place for good reasons."
Activists also highlighted the importance of a vacancy on
the Supreme Court, which could allow President Bush to ap
point an anti-abortion judge to the nation's highest judicial
body. In November. Bush signed the "Partial-Birth Abor
tion Act," which prevents doctors from performing a con
troversial abortion procedure in the second or third
trimester of a women's pregnancy.

Celebrity activists also emphasized the importance of
voter registration.
"We need to register people to vote," comedian
Whoopi Goldberg said. "It's OK to voice your opinion,
but you must keep choice. Even God gave us freedom of
choice. Let's make the right choice and put the right per
son in office this time."
Actress Ashley Judd said abortions could be avoided if
women had better access to contraception.
"Keep your laws off my body," Judd said to the protest
ers. "Can you hear me 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? If you
don't want us to abort our pregnancies have health care
cover our birth control."
The march had a partisan tone, as the crowd denounced
the Bush administration with signs reading, "My bush would
make a better president" and "Abort Bush now."
The two-mile march route took protesters from the

Mall down 14th Street and across the Ellipse. Counter-pro
testers lined the route with graphic illustrations of dis
membered fetuses and signs stating "Abortion = murder"
and "God hates you."
Colonials for Life, a pro-life George Washington Uni
versity student organization, participated in the counter
protest near L'Efant Plaza.
' "We believe that 112 abortion] is the ultimate exploitation of women
tind tine greatest sign that society has failed women," Colonials for
Life Chair Suanne Ednuston said. "We believe it is genocide."
U.S. Park Police arrested 16 counter-protesters from the
Christian Defense Coalition for protesting without a permit
and another demonstrator for throwing a plastic ink-filled
egg at the marchers, said Sgt. Scott Fear, of the Park Police
Public Information Office.
