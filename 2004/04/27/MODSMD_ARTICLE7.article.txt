Physical Society in 2(X)1 for his seminal contribu

"I received promotion to full professor in the au
tumn quarter which may have been a catalyst for
some colleagues nominating me for this award,"
Lele said. "I very much appreciate it and look for
ward to working with the Asian American Center."
Carmen Miraflor, programs manager for the
Center for Integrated Systems, is extremely passion
ate about raising the visibility of Filipino culture and
heritage through the Filipino American community
at Stanford. She founded a program in the Filipino
American community at Stanford and worked to
bring Filipino writers to campus.
"There is a renaissance of literary writing among
Filipino authors and I wanted to raise the visibility
of Filipino literature to the Stanford community
through literary readings," Miraflor said. "In the
last five years. I searched for authors who were will
ing to come to Stanford to read their work: short
story writers, socio-political historians, novelists,
and poets."
Although she has achieved a great deal both on
and off campus in terms of raising Filipino visibility,

Miraflor emphasized that her work in the communi
ty was not done yet.
"1 want to promote awareness of Filipino culture,
heritage and history through literary readings," she
said. "Beyond literature, I want to include Filipino
artwork in the learning field. The Filipinos have
been in America since the 18th century but we seem
to lose ourselves in the shadows and are outshone by
all other ethnic groups. However little, I want to
raise our visibility."
When asked what she did to win her award,
Sarah Chilim Ihn replied, "I honestly don't know. I
don't really feel like I deserve an award, and am re
ally honored and humbled by it, particularly be
cause I feel like I've received so much more than
I've given."
Yet Ihn has been deeply involved in the Asian
American community throughout her years at
Stanford as a staff member for the Asian American
Activities Center for the past three years, a mem
ber of North Korean Human Rights Week orga
nizing committee, intern at the Vietnamese Youth
Development Center in San Francisco, and as a
cast member in the Asian American Theater Pro
ject's most recent play. In the past, she has also
been Culture Chair of the Korean American Stu
dents' Association, a Stanford Cambodian Cultur
al Association officer and member, Project Moti
vation officer and AANSOC Big Sib / Lil Sib Co
ordinator. She was a summer intern at Youth Unit
ed for Community Action in East Palo Alto, and at
Neighborhood Legal Services in Los Angeles
County. After graduation, she plans to pursue a ca
reer in the non-profit sector.
Jordan Lee, also a senior, said there is no sin
gle event that qualifies him for receiving the
award, but rather a range of involvement with the
Stanford Hawaii Club as its current co-chair and
other Hawaiian-related organizations through
out the last few years. He has also been involved
as an head peer academic coordinator, an Over
seas Studies student, an Alternative Spring
Break Hawaii'i Trip Leader, and a member of
both the Stanford American Indian Organization
(SAIO) and the Asian American Students Asso
ciation (AASA). After graduation, Lee plans to
return to Hawaii to conduct research on cancer
prevention and diabetes in Native Hawaiian pop
ulations, volunteer at a community health clinic
and apply to medical school.
Senior Sai Patil said she was also surprised to re
ceive her award.
"I was seriously so surprised when they told me I
got it," she said. However, she also has an record of
involvement in the Asian community at Stanford.
She founded Noopur, Stanford's Bharata Naytam
Association, a group of girls who practice and per
form this form of Indian classical dance.
"My role as founder and team leader is to en

courage students of Bharata Natyam to continue
with their dance and to inform the Stanford com
munity about this beautiful art form." Patil said.
"It is a rich blend of Hindu religion and art, so
learning about it is really a getting a closer look at
Hindu culture."
Patil also founded the Stanford Hindi Film
Dance Team, which uses music from popular Bolly
wood films from India
"I founded this group with Shalin Mantri in re
sponse to there being no Stanford representation at
intercollegiate Hindi film dance competitions," Patil
said. "We really bonded as a team and won second
place in the statewide Hindi Film Dance competi
tion this March."
Patil has also served as a member of the Social
Entrepreneurship Advisory' Board, as a leader of a
2003-2004 Alternative Spring Break trip on Eco-En
trepreneurship, studied abroad fora quarter in Flo
rence, Italy through Stanford's Overseas Studies
program, and served as Sanskriti financial officer.
Patil said she plans to work for Bain & Co. in Los
Angeles for the next two years in management con
sulting, after which she hopes to attend business or
law school and either work in a or perhaps even
start her own social entrepreneurship venture. She
also plans to continue pursuing her interest in
Bharata Natyam.
"Ultimately. I want to have some positive impact
on the way social and environmental problems are
being solved, as well as the way South Asian culture
and heritage are being preserved," she declared. On
winning this award, Patil said, "This award reminds
me that the Stanford community really does want to
encourage a diversity of voices and appreciates all
cultures and traditions. I am representing a lot of
South Asians and South Asian-Americans that
work really hard to inform our community and keep
cultural traditions alive."
Herb Fong, grounds manager for Facilities Op
erations, has been a mentor to sophomore Asian
students for over 10 years and a staff advisor for
freshmen for the past 15 years and has had held
many official positions with garden clubs and pro
fessional organisations such as president of the
Saratoga Horticultural Research Foundation, vice
president of the Elizabeth F. Gamble Garden Cen
ter, chairperson for the Landscape Supervisors
Forum and president of the Northern California
Turf and Landscape Council.
Fong said he could only guess what he did to win
the award, but he offered up some possibilities.
"I have written up in the Stanford Magazine this
past year, I just finished my 30th year at Stanford
and my tree walks that I do periodically for staffers,
students and interested groups are pretty popular.
Perhaps some of these items contributed to this
award nomination"He added, "Besides just being
a nice guy."
