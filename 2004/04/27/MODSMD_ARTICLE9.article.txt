# Brain fingerprinting

### 
Three loud knocks stir you from your sleep. The door
suddenly swings open. Two policemen accuse you of a
crime you didn't commit. At court, a jury sentences you
to 25 years in prison.
Does this sound too harsh to be true? According to a recent re
port by the University of Michigan, innocent people across the nation

may be serving time for crimes they didn't do.
Michigan Law Prof. Samuel Gross conducted
what is believed to be the most comprehensive
listing of exonerations in the U.S. to date. His
report, entitled "Exonerations in the United
States, 1989 through 2003" demonstrates a dra
matic increase in the number of exonerations of
innocent defendants who were convicted for
crimes they didn't commit.
Overall, 316 men and 12 women in the past
decade were exonerated. Almost half of them,
145, were cleared by DNA identification tech-

nology and 183 by other kinds of evidence.
According to the report, most of the innocent defendants who
are found guilty are the victims of false convictions that haven't
been identified, rape convictions lacking DNA evidence, rob
beries, murder cases that are ignored because the defendants were
not sentenced to death and assault and drug convictions that are
forgotten entirely. "Any plausible guess at the total number of mis
carriages of justice in America in the last fifteen years," the report
mentions, "must be in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands."
With such high estimates, it's a crime to see innocent defen
dants being convicted. We are stripping away the rights of free
dom and liberty so hard fought for by this country and leaving cit
izens voiceless.
Reform needs to happen throughout the judicial process. But
let's be honest; it takes time to restructure an archaic and out
dated legal system. If we keep making mistaken accusations that
deprive another person of his right to basic freedoms, then we
must in turn consider using objective and impartial scientific
tools to reduce the disparity.
To ameliorate such egregious examples of judicial blunders,
advancements in forensic science must take the forefront. DNA
fingerprinting, for example, has left an indelible mark in crime
scene investigations. Certain repetitive fragments of our DNA,
about 3 million bases long (or 0.1 percent of our DNA) differ
from person to person. By comparing these variable regions, sci
entists can create unique profiles for each individual from blood,
bone, hair or body tissue samples. Tools that analyze DNA are so
thorough, that the odds of two people sharing the same DNA
profile are generally one in one billion.
In certain court cases, such as robberies, however, DNA evi
dence is rendered ineffective. But there is one scientific tool
available that could help prove whether the defendant is inno
cent or guilty: brain fingerprinting.
This technique measures involuntary brain waves in response
to a subject being shown certain images of a crime. According to
developer Dr. Larry Farwell, the fundamental difference be
tween the perpetrator and an innocent person is that the former
stored details of the crime in his brain. Only the perpetrator's
brain would respond to cues from the crime scene, while the in
nocent person's brain would not exhibit any response.
'it is highly scientific, brain fingerprinting doesn't have any
thing to do with the emotions, whether a person is sweating or
not; it simply detects scientifically if that information is stored in
the brain," Farwell told local reports. "It doesn't depend upon
the subjective interpretation of the person conducting the test.
The computer monitors the information and comes up with in
formation present or information absent."
Currently, brain fingerprinting is being used as part of the key
evidence to overturn the murder conviction of Jimmy Ray
Slaughter, an inmate awaiting execution in Oklahoma. Slaughter
was convicted for shooting, stabbing and mutilating his former
girlfriend and of shooting to death their eleven-month old
daughter. After Farwell ran his test, however. Slaughter's brain
waves revealed he did not know where the murder had taken
place or where the dead bodies were lying.
Although Farwell claims Slaughter is innocent from a scien
tific standpoint, critics consider brain fingerprinting techniques
still too green to be used as decisive evidence in court cases. Op
ponents of the technique argue that insufficient research has
been done to support Farwell's findings and that brain waves
may not always indicate memory retrieval. Legal representatives
are also wary of allowing brain fingerprinting evidence. Last
month, prosecutors overlooked Farwell's study and asked the
Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to set his execution date.
For now, with the incoming onslaught of exoneration find
ings, brain fingerprinting should be allowed to sit at the table
with other forensic evidence.
