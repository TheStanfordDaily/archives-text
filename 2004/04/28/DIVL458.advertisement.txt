Impair your ability to walk.
• MRI of both knees
•Biomechanical evaluation ot activities of daily living (i.e., walking,
jogging, stalr-cllmbing) in the Biomotion Laboratory on campus
•Measurements of knee laxity
•Tests of quadriceps and hamstring strength
•All tests are non-invasive, painless, and at no cost to you.
