r Man Boob vs. Woman Boob
The first votes are in...
' Much circumstantial evidence points to the nipple belonging
to a man. Firstly, it looks like he has a bit of chest hair between
his man-tits. Secondly, the nipple-person's role is probably the
same as the guy on the right, (they are both banging on a
'' drum and shirtless) establishing the precedent for the shirt-
Pff less gender role. Thirdly, it looks like the dude is trying to
bling-bling it with a chain around his neck, and the necklace
seems more reminiscent of male necklaces versus those of fe
-4 mals. Thus, the boob belongs to a MAN, who desperately
kji needs a "Bro".
