Rowles will be leaving Stanford at the end of the
academic year, she announced yesterday.
Rowles, who advises student groups and works
closely with sororities and student publications,
will be moving to the East Coast where her hus

"I love working with the students here at Stan
ford, so it's a bittersweet departure," Rowles
said. "The students and student programming are
just phenomenal."
Rowles worked in the Office of Student Activi
ties for three years.
"From my perspective it's a loss for Stanford,"
said Dean of Students Greg Boardman. "Judith is
a very capable professional, one that we will sure
ly miss. Her departure is a loss to students in par
ticular. She's very talented and approachable, and
it's going to be tough to replace her, but we will and
a search will take place."
According to Director of Student Activities
Nanci Howe, the search for Rowles' replacement
will be conducted by a committee comprised of
both staff and students. Although she has not yet
contacted the ASSU, Howe said she expects the
ASSU Nominations Commission to choose the
students involved.
"There will be additional opportunities for staff
and students to interview the candidates when
they come on campus and give us feedback,"
Howe said.
She added that the committee will be look
ing fora candidate with strong experience
working with students and student groups,
someone who will be able to work well in the
Stanford environment and most likely someone
with a graduate degree.
"We started conversations to figure out the
timeline and what the process should be, so I'll be
there to lay a solid groundwork for whoever comes
in after me," Rowles said.
Howe said she hopes to have a new assistant di
rector in place by September.
"I think she's done a fabulous job with stu
dent publications in particular, and she's a
strong student advocate, so we'll miss her,"
Howe said. "But at the same time I'm happy for
her personally."
