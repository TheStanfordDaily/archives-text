### BARRETT SHERIDAN DESK EDITOR 
Joey Greenwell is an aspiring vegetarian and assistant

the Interfraternity Council and is the go-to guy for all
campus party-planning. He loves foreign films.
1) Which is your favorite "Joey": Joey Lawrence from
"Blossom," Uncle Joey from "Full House" or Joey Fa
tone from 'NSYNC?
Urn, that's tough. [Laughs.] I guess Uncle Joey, from
"Full House," because he has a lot of personality. He al
ways made people laugh. He was kind of quirky. I think

humor was really important to him,
which I think is always good in peo
ples' lives. No matter what the situa
tion was, he was kind of the quirky,
weird one in that regard.
2) What if I threw Joey Natoli into the
mix? Would that change your answer?
Joey Natoli is great. I strive to be like
Joey Natoli. [Laughs.)

3) I see your name as "Joey I). Greenwell" a lot. What
does the middle initial stand for?
Defraine. D-e-f-r-a-i-n-e. That's Americanized. It
should be D-e-F-r-a-i-n-e, with an accent over the first e.
It's French. I don't know the meaning per se. It's a fam
ily name, so it was my grandfather's middle name, and
then his grandfather's, so it's been through pretty much
every generation,
4) Since you deal with campus parties so much, have you
ever been to one? I bet you could get yourself on the in
vite list.
I have. I've been to a few. I get invited every once in a
while. I don't ask to be invited, but sometimes they invite
me, so I will try to go particularly to support them and
just to see, because some of the events are really cool
and they do a lot of decoration and stuff like that. So I go
to support. For example I've been to Sun Splash, by
Sigma Nu. They invited me to come and check it out be
cause I worked with them very closely with the event. I
usually go early and try to leave early.
5) Are you coming to Exotic Erotic this year? I live in
680. You can consider this an invitation.
Actually, I probably will be at Exotic Erotic this year be
cause we're trying to give more support for that event, so
I'm gonna be there to help with the event.
6) Who are the best party-planners on campus?
I'm the best party planner on campus.
7) Are there any initiatives from the Interfraternity
Council to bring the show "Fraternity Life" to Stanford?
I don't think there's any initiative. IFC just changed
leadership, so they are trying to put a new face to IFC
on-campus. There's a lot of new energy with it. I think
the campus is going to see a lot more with the fraternity
and Greek system as far as programming and events.
8) If you could live anywhere on the Row, where would
you live?
If I had to live in a house, maybe I would live in Bob, be
cause, for nothing else, Joey Natoli is on staff at Bob.
9) What's your favorite alcoholic drink?
I enjoy wine with dinner. I particularly like red, so a nice
cabernet or merlot. I don't eat red meat, though. I eat
chicken, I eat fish. I say I'm a poultry-tarian. I'd like to
become a vegetarian, but I'm having a hard time letting
go of chicken and fish.
10) Who came up with the acronym "EANAB"? It's a
bit cumbersome.
I don't know who it was, but it wasn't me.
