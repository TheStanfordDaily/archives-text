## Stanford Cycling Team prepares for national championships 
### KATIE BEARMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you have ever decided to drop by
the post office around 3:30 p.m. on a
weekday, you may have found your
self weaving through a small crowd of
men and women clad in spandex. Al
though they are not sporting the red
Nike warm-up pants associated with
Stanford athletes, these students
wearing clingy, fluorescent outfits are
about as athletic as they come. They
are the tough, zealous members of the
Stanford Cycling Club.
Tough, perhaps, is an understatement.
"Cycling is a sport of terrible phys
ical suffering," said sophomore Tyler
Hester, the social chair and road team
leader of the club. "When you're
going all out on a hill, everyone in the
race is going into all sorts of physical
agony... It's the person who is able
to suffer the most that is going to win.
Cycling can yield incredible disap
pointment and profound joy. Either
way, cycling brings out powerful
emotions and is not for the weak of
the heart."
Apparently, there are many
strong-hearted people on campus be
cause the Stanford Cycling Club
boasts over 100 enthusiastic male and
female members. Whether novice or
experienced, uninterested in compet
ing or eager to race, anyone can par
ticipate in Stanford cycling and take it
as seriously as they desire.
Although one must be a registered
student to partake in collegiate com
petitions, Stanford faculty and staff
are welcome to join the club, go on
group rides and compete in non-colle
giate races.
So what, exactly, is competitive cy
cling? Microbiology and immunology
doctoral student Ashley Fouts said,
"Collegiate racing mainly includes
mountain and road. A typical race
weekend entails two to three races: a
criterium, a road race and time trials."
A criterium takes place on a short
loop of road normally about a kilome
ter in length. Criterium races usually
last about forty minutes to an hour,
and can involve as many as 70 laps.
"Very good for spectators, these

races often have exciting sprint finish
es," Fouts said.
Road races are usually made up of
various laps of a 10-20-mile course
which, according to Fouts, can include
rolling terrain, big hills and dirt roads.
Finally, time trials are events in which
competitors ride either individually or
as a team of four. They race as fast as
they can against the clock, usually for
distances of 10-20 miles.
Cycling takes place virtually year
round in California, where October
and November are considered autumn
months and where the most extreme
"winter" weather is comprised of a few
rain showers. Taking advantage of
California's superb climate, the Stan
ford cyclists ride seven days a week.
Medical school student John

Cahoy said that "The road bikers meet
at the post office every weekday at
3:30 p.m. and every weekend at 9 a.m.
Practice for some is simply the fun of
going out and riding around the beau
tiful Bay Area."
Stanford cyclists can choose the
amount of practices they attend.
Members of the Stanford Cycling
Club who are very serious about rac
ing, however, stick to vigorous prac
tice schedules in preparation for re
gional and national events.
The Stanford cyclists race in the
West Collegiate Cycling Conference
(WCCC) —the strongest branch of
the nationwide organization — and the
National Collegiate Cycling Associa
tion (NCCA). At most competitive

events, there are be
ginner, intermediate
and advanced races for
both men and women.
The Stanford Cy
cling Club has repeat
edly experienced suc
cess. Last year, the
club was ranked fifth
in the WCCC team
omnium standing. For
those unfamiliar with
cycling, an omnium
standing is made up of
the results from all

types of races. Additionally, both
Fouts and junior Chris Montague-
Blackwell had stupendous wins in re
cent A category races, one in Santa
Cruz, Calif, and one in Reno, Nev.

On his victory, Montague-Black
well commented. "The perfect tactics
by our Stanford team made my win
possible. John Cahoy broke away
early in the 88-mile race, forcing the
other teams to chase. Once John was
caught, I broke away with two Cal rid
ers and a rider from Davis. By the end
we had over nine minutes on the next
group. 1 easily beat the other three in
the sprint for the line."
Currently, Stanford's category A
riders are preparing for the collegiate
cycling national championships that
will take place in the end of May in
Madison, Wis.
"I know that the team really gets
behind their teammates that go to
compete on the national stage, and it

serves as an inspiration to the other
members of the club,'" Hester said.
The Stanford racers have ample
time to build supportive team rela
tionships. They are best able to bond
with one another when they road-trip
to tournaments.
"Basically, cramming into little
Mote! Six rooms with all of us, our
bikes and our bags, and hanging out
together creates a great team unity,"
Hester said.
The Stanford Cycling Club is able
to pay for team members' hotel rooms
and gas expenses during travel
through money from ASSU special
fees for club sports. Club members
also participate in fundraising activi
ties and pay dues of $50 per quarter or
$120 per year. These dues may seem
high, but the sponsorships and dis
counts that Stanford cyclists receive
compensate for the financial sacrifice.
"We get great deals from lots of
companies," Hester said. "Specialized
gives us discounts on bikes and other
equipment. Clif bar gives us food for
our races, and Smith is our glasses
sponsor among many others."
While the cyclists are on the receiv
ing end of many benefits, they also
contribute to the Stanford communi
ty. Under the leadership of their long
time coach Art Walker and their team
captains, physics grad student Ueyn
Block and junior Rafer Willenberg,
the Stanford Cycling Club teaches
bike safety programs at Palo Alto pub
lic schools. According to junior Jordy
Mont-Reynaud, the club also orga
nized a panel of cancer survivors, one
of whom was Lance Armstrong, to
speak at Stanford.



The Stanford Cycling Team is ranked fiftfi on the West coast. The Stanford team
won three national championships from 1995-1997. UC-Berkeley is ranked first.

time coach Art Walker and their team

the Stanford Cycling Club teaches

If you have ever decided to drop by
the post office around 3:30 p.m. on a
weekday, you may have found your
self weaving through a small crowd of
men and women clad in spandex. Al
though they are not sporting the red
Nike warm-up pants associated with
Stanford athletes, these students
wearing clingy, fluorescent outfits are
about as athletic as they come. They
are the tough, zealous members of the
Stanford Cycling Club.
Tough, perhaps, is an understatement.
"Cycling is a sport of terrible phys
ical suffering," said sophomore Tyler
Hester, the social chair and road team
leader of the club. "When you're
going all out on a hill, everyone in the
race is going into all sorts of physical
agony... It's the person who is able
to suffer the most that is going to win.
Cycling can yield incredible disap
pointment and profound joy. Either
way, cycling brings out powerful
emotions and is not for the weak of
the heart."
Apparently, there are many
strong-hearted people on campus be
cause the Stanford Cycling Club
boasts over 100 enthusiastic male and
female members. Whether novice or
experienced, uninterested in compet
ing or eager to race, anyone can par
ticipate in Stanford cycling and take it
as seriously as they desire.
Although one must be a registered
student to partake in collegiate com
petitions, Stanford faculty and staff
are welcome to join the club, go on
group rides and compete in non-colle
giate races.
So what, exactly, is competitive cy
cling? Microbiology and immunology
doctoral student Ashley Fouts said,
"Collegiate racing mainly includes
mountain and road. A typical race
weekend entails two to three races: a
criterium, a road race and time trials."
A criterium takes place on a short
loop of road normally about a kilome
ter in length. Criterium races usually
last about forty minutes to an hour,
and can involve as many as 70 laps.
"Very good for spectators, these

races often have exciting sprint finish
es," Fouts said.
Road races are usually made up of
various laps of a 10-20-mile course
which, according to Fouts, can include
rolling terrain, big hills and dirt roads.
Finally, time trials are events in which
competitors ride either individually or
as a team of four. They race as fast as
they can against the clock, usually for
distances of 10-20 miles.
Cycling takes place virtually year
round in California, where October
and November are considered autumn
months and where the most extreme
"winter" weather is comprised of a few
rain showers. Taking advantage of
California's superb climate, the Stan
ford cyclists ride seven days a week.
Medical school student John

Cahoy said that "The road bikers meet
at the post office every weekday at
3:30 p.m. and every weekend at 9 a.m.
Practice for some is simply the fun of
going out and riding around the beau
tiful Bay Area."
Stanford cyclists can choose the
amount of practices they attend.
Members of the Stanford Cycling
Club who are very serious about rac
ing, however, stick to vigorous prac
tice schedules in preparation for re
gional and national events.
The Stanford cyclists race in the
West Collegiate Cycling Conference
(WCCC) —the strongest branch of
the nationwide organization — and the
National Collegiate Cycling Associa
tion (NCCA). At most competitive

events, there are be
ginner, intermediate
and advanced races for
both men and women.
The Stanford Cy
cling Club has repeat
edly experienced suc
cess. Last year, the
club was ranked fifth
in the WCCC team
omnium standing. For
those unfamiliar with
cycling, an omnium
standing is made up of
the results from all

types of races. Additionally, both
Fouts and junior Chris Montague-
Blackwell had stupendous wins in re
cent A category races, one in Santa
Cruz, Calif, and one in Reno, Nev.

On his victory, Montague-Black
well commented. "The perfect tactics
by our Stanford team made my win
possible. John Cahoy broke away
early in the 88-mile race, forcing the
other teams to chase. Once John was
caught, I broke away with two Cal rid
ers and a rider from Davis. By the end
we had over nine minutes on the next
group. 1 easily beat the other three in
the sprint for the line."
Currently, Stanford's category A
riders are preparing for the collegiate
cycling national championships that
will take place in the end of May in
Madison, Wis.
"I know that the team really gets
behind their teammates that go to
compete on the national stage, and it

serves as an inspiration to the other
members of the club,'" Hester said.
The Stanford racers have ample
time to build supportive team rela
tionships. They are best able to bond
with one another when they road-trip
to tournaments.
"Basically, cramming into little
Mote! Six rooms with all of us, our
bikes and our bags, and hanging out
together creates a great team unity,"
Hester said.
The Stanford Cycling Club is able
to pay for team members' hotel rooms
and gas expenses during travel
through money from ASSU special
fees for club sports. Club members
also participate in fundraising activi
ties and pay dues of $50 per quarter or
$120 per year. These dues may seem
high, but the sponsorships and dis
counts that Stanford cyclists receive
compensate for the financial sacrifice.
"We get great deals from lots of
companies," Hester said. "Specialized
gives us discounts on bikes and other
equipment. Clif bar gives us food for
our races, and Smith is our glasses
sponsor among many others."
While the cyclists are on the receiv
ing end of many benefits, they also
