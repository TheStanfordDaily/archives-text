# Eat, drink and be merry

### JENNIE BRODER FOOD COLUMNIST 
Now that the profros are gone, heat stroke has hit
and the mosquito-eater things have flocked into
our room full-force, it feels like spring again. It
seems as if we have all experienced a collective
sigh of relief — "I can finally open my skirt drawer again
or "I can shamelessly and shirtless-ly display my Tressider
created six pack while strutting across White Plaza, or
while chilling with my boys on our lawn. Sweet."
Sometimes, when it gets this hot, all you want to do is
pass out in a industrial strength air-conditioned room (lights
turned off, guzzle your Propel water and watch a movie.)
I admit last weekend I busted out the "Dawson's
Creek" season one DVD. You all remember the Beauty
Pageant episode, when Joey (Katie Holms) pretends to
sing "On My Own," but all she does is shrug her shoul
ders constantly and dons that weird half-smile thing that
she does so much. Or the episode when Joey visits her
dad in prison and he tells her that Dawson loves her. I
may or may not have become teary at this point.
One movie that I always find so endearing is "My Big
Fat Greek Wedding," which most unfortunately had to try
to morph into a television sitcom. Anyway, many times
when 1 see a movie I start to crave whatever food is fea
tured. And if seeing Nia Vardalos is going to make you
want Greek food, well then that's what you have to do. So
once you watch it, you can try one of my favorite, favorite,
favorite restaurants, Evvia.

This place is always
packed, so I highly rec
ommend a reservation,
even for lunch. There
have been way too
many times where 1
tried to walk in and I left
10 minutes later. Those
were not happy days.
Let me just preface
by saying that if the only
foods you like are spicy,
hot, exotic flavors, then
this place might not be
your cup of tea. Or cup
of curry, whatever. But
if you enjoy smooth,
rich, delicate flavors
contrasting with hearty fillings and a beautiful atmo
sphere, then Evvia is for you.
The room itself is decorated in the style of a rustic
kitchen, with heavy wood tables and chairs, and a gor
geous hearth-like kitchen area with copper pots hanging
from the beams. Your eye immediately finds the seven
tiered bar shelves holding about 60 bottles of different
shapes, and filled bright colored liquid inside, as if to
give the impression of a glowing rainbow of bottles.
And that's just the decor. The food is so fabulous, that
it's become one of the established take-my-parents
restaurants (it is a bit pricey).

"My Big Fat Greek Lunch"

The bread they start you off with
is amazing — it has a deep flavor to
it, and the thicker crust fits perfectly
against the soft yet textured interior.
They have a Greek Spread appetizer
that is delicious. It's three dips —
roasted eggplant salad, a yogurt-cu
cumber dip and cod-roe puree
(sounds weird but so good, trust me)
— served with the best grilled pita
bread I may have ever tasted in my
life. It's both soft yet deep, mild
enough to be a clean palate for the
dip yet flavorful enough to stand on
its own.
The Greek salad is crunchy cucum
bers. crisp bell peppers and ripe toma
toes tossed with feta cheese and olives.

all lightly coated in a delicious vinaigrette dressing (sorry,
no lettuce in this salad, folks). I love this salad paired with
my favorite lunch item — a chicken pita sandwich (which
I kind creatc from different items on the menu).
The waiters get mad at me every time I ask for it, so
order at your own risk. The homemade pita slices I was
just discussing now are in their whole form, rolling up
the chicken with a creamy tzatziki sauce (the yogurt-cu
cumber spread), tomato slivers and seasonal greens. The
entire dish is so smooth and creamy, warm and comfort
ing. It's served beautifully also, with a rosemary spear
holding the wrap together, a preparation which subtly

infuses the whole dish with a hint of this herb.
Dinner is a little fancier, and the menu becomes a bit
more traditionally Greek. This is not your average-joe
dinner, mind you. They have fabulous fish and chicken
dishes, rustically cooked with earthy flavors. They are
famous for their lamb shanks and also serve pork chops
and a creamy moussaka (a Greek style lasagna with egg
plant, ragout and a light bechamel sauce).
There are myriad other traditional Greek dishes,
which 1 urge you to try if you are feeling adventurous.
And if you have a sweet tooth, save room for the Bakla
va, which is drizzled with honey syrup.
So don't expect waiters to be throwing plates in the air
in this restaurant. But do expect a lot of food, good service,
a beautiful atmosphere. More important is the feeling that
you aren't in the Stanford bubble and that you can enjoy
an amazing meal in the company of strangers, all enjoying
the same food — and enjoying it in air conditioning.
jjc Evvia is located at 420 Emerson St., Palo Alto.

If you have the Saved by the Bell DVD, let Jennie know at
jbroder@stanford.edu. And she's talking about the Zach
Morris years, not the New Class. Or the College Years. Jen
nie's favorite moment: in the words of Jessie Spano, "I'm so
excited, I'm so excited, I'm 50... scared." Lay off the caf
feine pills, Jessie. You don 7 need an A in Calculus that badly.
