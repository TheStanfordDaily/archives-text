## Resist federal wiretap plans 
### 
If three federal agencies have their way, the Fed
eral Communications Commission will soon re
quire universities such as Stanford to install
hardware that makes it easier for the govern
ment to eavesdrop on telephone conversations con
ducted on voice-over IP networks.
The government has always had the technical ca
pacity to monitor telephone lines. The introduction of
voice-over I P.services, which break a conversation up
into Internet-style data packets rather than sending it
in a continuous stream over a single line, makes tap
ping more difficult. Currently, there are a few hundred
voice-over IP phones on campus, but as many as 7,0()0
are expected to be added in the next 18 months.
To the extent that government eavesdropping was
justified in the past, it makes sense to take the techni
cal steps needed to overcome this obstacle. The Fed
eral Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Jus
tice and the Drug Enforcement Agency understand
ably do not want to have their efforts to catch ciminals
circumvented by new phone technologies. And. as in

these editorials represent the views of the members of The Daily's editorial board. The board consists of Tin
Daily's editor in chief, two opinions editors anil six community members at-large. Signed columns and
contributions are the view of the writer and do not necessarily represent the view of the editorial board.

the past, solutions that are transparent and easy to
monitor by the courts are better.
The problem is not the new technical steps, but the
way the government hopes to forcibly implement
them. In the past, eavesdropping has been the gov
ernment's responsibility. Now the government is
looking to leverage its power over institutions of
higher education toco-opt them into its information
gathering processes.
If the FCC 1 puts the new rules into effect, the Uni
versity's role as a trusted guardian of students' civil
rights may be compromised. II the government must
eavesdrop on students'conversations, let it find a way
to do so on its own rather than turning colleges and
other public institutions into its agents. The culture of
public trust in civil institutions that underpins any
democracy is much more easily eroded than rebuilt.
That is why we urge the Stanford community to
lend its support to the coalition of 13 higher-education
and library associations that is working to oppose the
enactment of these requirements.
