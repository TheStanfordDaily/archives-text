# STILL MAC, STILL DANGEROUS
## 101 things to do at Stanford 
### 
Around Admit Weekend,
mind-numbing Stanford
issued propaganda is ev
erywhere you look.
Nothing epitomizes this more than
the list of " 101 things to do before you
graduate from Stanford."
I don't know who writes this
garbage or who in John Hennessy's
name the writers are trying to attract
with it. But it's absolutely horren
dous. It oozes nerdiness through its
every consonant and lameness
through every vowel.
Don't worry, though — once
again, I have come to save the day.
President Hennessy, I know you're a
loyal reader of mine, and this is for
you. The following is my own list of
things to do before you graduate
from Stanford, and I highly recom
mend that you do whatever it takes
— break some skulls if you have to
— to ensure that this list is included
in next year's material. Without fur
ther ado:
Urinate in a fountain.
Take one Econ section that is
taught by a TA whose native lan
guage is English.
Girls, have sex with at least three
members of the basketball team —
preferably starters. Extra points if
you bag the entire frontcourt.
Boys, have sex with one girl from
each of the Big Three sororities —
Kappa, Pi Phi and Theta. Sorry, Tri
Delt, you're not on the list yet. Maybe
next year.
Riot after a national champi
onship. I don't care what anyone tells
you. The right way to celebrate a field
hockey title is to turn cars upside
down and light things on fire.
Bring a fart machine into the Bing
Wing and wreak havoc for an hour.
Participate in a "joint subcommit
tee meeting" on the 50-yard line of
Stanford Stadium. If you don't know
what I mean, rent "Dazed and Con

fused" and take notes.
Go to a career fair dressed like Rick
James with a resume outlining your
"Superfreak" qualifications. When the
recruiters from Goldman Sachs ask
you what you would bring to the firm,
simply reply: "I'm Rick James, bitches.
Celebrate."

Read one mag
azine that gets to
your P.O. box the
week it's sup
posed to.
Write a letter to
The Daily about
the Israeli-Pales
tinian conflict.
Go to Open

Mic night at the CoHo and mumble
incoherently like OP Dirty Bastard
after he's been sipping on Courvoisi
er-and-Xanax cocktails all night.
Bungee-jump off Hoover Tower.
Transform University Avenue
into Bourbon Street one week a year,
making the chants of "Show us your
tits" ring throughout the Bay Area.
Raise your hand in the middle
of a lecture and ask a Nobel Laure
ate professor: "Why are you so ar
rogant? It's not like you invented
the wheel."
Throw up on the Marguerite.
Burn "NERDS" into the grass
outside the house of the fraternity
you hate the most on campus.
Run for ASSU president with
out committing violations that
would make Gordon Liddy beam
with pride.
Call up Ted Leland, the athletics
director, and beg him to turn beer
pong into a varsity sport.
Do the "Party Boy" routine from
"Jackass" in the Bookstore. Extra
points if you get thrown out of the
store in your thong.
Go streaking through the Quad
and up to the gymnasium.
Pretend to be a freshman boy

every year at Full Moon on the Quad.
Flay 18 holes on Stanford Golf
Course dressed like Rodney Dan
gerfield's character, Al Czervik,
in "Caddyshack."
Watch a massive bike accident in
front of the Clock Tower as you post
up next to the water polo players.
Crash a "Screw Your Room
mate" at Branner and screw a ran
dom freshman.
Make up a stupid Stanford-type
abbreviation like HisCo (Flistory
Corner) and laugh when it catches on
like wildfire.
Try to spend less than three dol
lars at Jamba Juice.
Throw meat at people protesting in
White Plaza like the scene in "PCU."
Break into Avery Aquatic Center
at night and do a cannonball off the
high dive.
Get a URO grant to conduct part
two of the Stanford Prison Experi
ment — this time, Guantanamo
Bay-style. I'm talking about sleep
deprivation for months and some se
rious elect rodes-on-the-testicles
kind of torture.
And, finally, do a keg stand on
stage at MemAud as the entire stu
dent body chants. "One. two, three ..
. seventy-six." Then, once you're
done, go outside and throw up on the
Marguerite fora second time.
President Hennessy, I know this
list doesn't contain 101 items, but I
hope it's still helpful. Also, I've got a
ton of ideas for Admit Weekend in
general — cow-tipping and KY-jelly
wrestling matches, just to name a cou
ple. All you've got to do is ask me.
Hennessy, holla at your boy.
