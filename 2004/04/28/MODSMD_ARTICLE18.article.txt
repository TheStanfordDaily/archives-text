## Fog of War: Part Deux 
### 
Watching the documen
tary "Fog of War," I
wondered about the
make-up of a leader.
In the film, Robert McNamara, sec
retary of defense for first JFK and
then President Lyndon Johnson, is
allowed significant airtime to ex
plain his actions in Vietnam.
Given an open mic, McNamara
looks directly into the camera and
defends his life and the decisions
he's made. No matter what the expe
rience, he used glowing terms, spin
ning his life into a series of opportu
nities to excel and overcome despite
challenges that many of the rest of us
would not describe as "wonderful."
Experiences such as the civil service
job he took at the Pentagon, the in
tense competition of his grade
school, or his wife's cancer.
It was especially striking to hear
the contrast between the way he de
scribed the goings-on in Vietnam to
the president and what he said to
the public. To LBJ he acknowl
edged that the war was a mess and
no one really knew what was going
on. To the public, he spun the facts
to their most optimistic read, re
porting that America was helping
the good people of Vietnam by sub
verting the communists — that this
war was important and America
would prevail.
Having read my share of biogra
phies of people who accomplished
big things, there is a running theme:
in the overused words of Winston
Churchill, "Never, never, never give
up." Those who rise through the
ranks and become our leaders are
fighters who view obstacles as op
portunities to grow rather than life
stopping tragedies. And people will
follow someone who gives meaning
to troubled times and makes chal
lenges seem noble.
How inspiring to the masses is a
hand-wringing, indecisive person?
Consider the difference in the U.S.
confidence level between the presi
dencies of Jimmy Carter, who was
thoughtful but got lost in the reex
amination of details and questions.

and Ronald Reagan, who believed
he had the answers.
The bottom line is that neither
of these presidencies was perfect,
but Reagan's optimism and leader
ship had a positive effect on the
country while Carter's concern and
realistic approach to problems
spawned the thickest malaise of
our history.
So the question I was left with as
I filed out of the movie theater is
whether or not our current presi
dent (who parrots McNamara's
words — just replace "communist"
with "terrorist") should acknowl-

edge any kind of
doubt in the twin
regime-change
projects he has
undertaken in
Afghanistan and
Iraq. Should our
president, who
started this con
flict with all the
confidence and
swagger of John

Wayne in a shoot-'em-up western
flick, admit a mistake about the
weapons of mass destruction or any
part of the decision that led us to this
bloody place?
It is a political conundrum. How
do you lead with confidence but
speak openly about mistakes? In our
current political culture, any ac
knowledgment of weakness is politi
cal suicide — a sound byte for 24-
hour play by your opponent. Hum
ble politicians are weeded out far be
fore they ascend to the White
House, a sad fact given that owning
up to mistakes early can save lives.
What if McNamara told America
what he said in private to his advi
sors? What if he had said that Viet
nam was a bloody civil war and
America had no business being
there? This would have only sped up
the timetable of the inevitable. Lives
would have been saved on both
sides, but what would have been the
political fallout? Would the struc
ture and order of the military have
been compromised?

There are those who believe that
Americans can handle the truth.
That the world would be better for
seeing the scores of flagged-draped
coffins arriving from Iraq every week
and for knowing and judging every
day what has happened in Iraq. I
have a friend who fancies himself a
political analyst, who believes Amer
ica would forgive Bush if he owned
up to his mistakes, just as America
was quick to forgive Bill Clinton
when he acknowledged lying under
oath and a little sexual indiscretion.
No one died defending Clinton's
perjury, whereas an ancient civiliza
tion has been altered, thousands of
Iraqis and at least 700 Americans
killed in the pursuit of Bush's
regime change.
There are people on the ground
attempting to finish what was started
in Iraq, and unlike Vietnam, this
isn't a civil war. There is no Iraqi
power that can realistically secure
that country from enemies should
the United States pull out tomorrow.
Indeed, there is a fog surrounding
this war, separate from the battle
field. There was a foggy mandate
that is still shifting, and the reasons
for this war and the best move
America could make on the battle
field today may not be known for
dozens of years.
But the true feelings of the Bush
administration are obvious, behind
the platitudes about democracy and
leading the Iraqis to freedom. Opti
mistic spin of the rising death tolls
aside, the speedy endgame de
signed to get soldiers out of Iraq by
June is the closest thing to an ac
knowledgment of error we'll ever
get from this administration.
In the end, McNamara's careful
speeches about Vietnam didn't save
the country from the truth. Good lead
ership may involve stretching the facts,
but Americans won't long suffer a
leader who ignores reality completely.

There are those who believe that
Americans can handle the truth.
That the world would be better for
seeing the scores of flagged-draped
coffins arriving from Iraq every week
and for knowing and judging every
day what has happened in Iraq. I
have a friend who fancies himself a
political analyst, who believes Amer
ica would forgive Bush if he owned
up to his mistakes, just as America
was quick to forgive Bill Clinton
when he acknowledged lying under
oath and a little sexual indiscretion.
No one died defending Clinton's
perjury, whereas an ancient civiliza
tion has been altered, thousands of
Iraqis and at least 700 Americans
killed in the pursuit of Bush's
regime change.
There are people on the ground
attempting to finish what was started
in Iraq, and unlike Vietnam, this
isn't a civil war. There is no Iraqi
power that can realistically secure
that country from enemies should
the United States pull out tomorrow.
Indeed, there is a fog surrounding
this war, separate from the battle
field. There was a foggy mandate
that is still shifting, and the reasons
for this war and the best move
America could make on the battle
field today may not be known for
dozens of years.
But the true feelings of the Bush
administration are obvious, behind
the platitudes about democracy and
leading the Iraqis to freedom. Opti
mistic spin of the rising death tolls
aside, the speedy endgame de
signed to get soldiers out of Iraq by
June is the closest thing to an ac
knowledgment of error we'll ever
get from this administration.
In the end, McNamara's careful
speeches about Vietnam didn't save
the country from the truth. Good lead
ership may involve stretching the facts,
but Americans won't long suffer a
leader who ignores reality completely.

Watching the documen
tary "Fog of War," I
wondered about the
make-up of a leader.
In the film, Robert McNamara, sec
retary of defense for first JFK and
then President Lyndon Johnson, is
allowed significant airtime to ex
plain his actions in Vietnam.
Given an open mic, McNamara
looks directly into the camera and
defends his life and the decisions
he's made. No matter what the expe
rience, he used glowing terms, spin
ning his life into a series of opportu
nities to excel and overcome despite
challenges that many of the rest of us
would not describe as "wonderful."
Experiences such as the civil service
job he took at the Pentagon, the in
tense competition of his grade
school, or his wife's cancer.
It was especially striking to hear
the contrast between the way he de
scribed the goings-on in Vietnam to
the president and what he said to
the public. To LBJ he acknowl
edged that the war was a mess and
no one really knew what was going
on. To the public, he spun the facts
to their most optimistic read, re
porting that America was helping
the good people of Vietnam by sub
verting the communists — that this
war was important and America
would prevail.
Having read my share of biogra
phies of people who accomplished
big things, there is a running theme:
in the overused words of Winston
Churchill, "Never, never, never give
up." Those who rise through the
ranks and become our leaders are
fighters who view obstacles as op
portunities to grow rather than life
stopping tragedies. And people will
follow someone who gives meaning
to troubled times and makes chal
lenges seem noble.
How inspiring to the masses is a
hand-wringing, indecisive person?
Consider the difference in the U.S.
confidence level between the presi
dencies of Jimmy Carter, who was
thoughtful but got lost in the reex
amination of details and questions.

and Ronald Reagan, who believed
he had the answers.
The bottom line is that neither
of these presidencies was perfect,
but Reagan's optimism and leader
ship had a positive effect on the
country while Carter's concern and
realistic approach to problems
spawned the thickest malaise of
our history.
So the question I was left with as
I filed out of the movie theater is
whether or not our current presi
dent (who parrots McNamara's
words — just replace "communist"
with "terrorist") should acknowl-

edge any kind of
doubt in the twin
regime-change
projects he has
undertaken in
Afghanistan and
Iraq. Should our
president, who
started this con
flict with all the
confidence and
swagger of John

Wayne in a shoot-'em-up western
flick, admit a mistake about the
weapons of mass destruction or any
part of the decision that led us to this
bloody place?
It is a political conundrum. How
do you lead with confidence but
speak openly about mistakes? In our
current political culture, any ac
knowledgment of weakness is politi
cal suicide — a sound byte for 24-
hour play by your opponent. Hum
ble politicians are weeded out far be
fore they ascend to the White
House, a sad fact given that owning
up to mistakes early can save lives.
What if McNamara told America
what he said in private to his advi
sors? What if he had said that Viet
nam was a bloody civil war and
America had no business being
there? This would have only sped up
the timetable of the inevitable. Lives
would have been saved on both
sides, but what would have been the
political fallout? Would the struc
ture and order of the military have
been compromised?
