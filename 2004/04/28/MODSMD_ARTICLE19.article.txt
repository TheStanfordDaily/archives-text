## R&DE, ASSU work hard to lower students' cost of living 
### NADIYA FIGUEROA ASSU PRESIDENT 
On April 19, The Daily published an inap
propriate and misguided editorial on Stan
ford Residential and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE), the auxiliary branch of the Univer
sity that manages student dining and housing.
Contrary to what the editorial seems to
imply, Shirley Everett, the associate vice
provost in charge of R&DE and all of its op
erations, has always been quick and respon
sive in meeting with me. The editorial also
made unjustified claims about the quality
and pricing competitiveness of the services
offered by R&DE, and about the organiza
tion's willingness to work on student issues.
What was most frustrating about the editori
al was its failure to illuminate any concrete
issues that students have expressed they
would like to see headway made on.
In reading this editorial, two things were
evident to me: First, everything you read in
the media must be taken with a grain of salt.
Second, and more importantly, some serious

education around cost-of-living issues and
what has been accomplished as well as what is
currently being worked on needs to be done.
In a survey conducted by the previous
ASSU Executive, students responded over
whelmingly that their primary concern and
area for desired student-life improvement
was cost of living. As such, we have tried to
tackle issues in this arena, and oftentimes
we have worked closely with the staff of
R&DE to do so.
At the beginning of this year, we held
focus groups and conducted a survey with
Stanford Housing to gauge student senti
ment on the proposed new laundry program.
With greater information provided on its en
vironmental friendliness and cost efficiency,
a large majority of students voted in favor of
the program, and it will be implemented this
coming fall.
With Stanford Dining, we worked to pro
vide student input in the planning of the new
Tresidder downstairs eatery area. Union
Square, and the results have been very satis
factory. Students now have more eating op

tions, including food from all corners of the
globe, and Tresidder feels more like the stu
dent hub that Stanford students have often
felt we're missing.
This year, we collaborated for the first
time with Stanford Dining to host "Primal
Snack," where free Krispy Kreme donuts and
milk were served to students the night before
fall finals. In all these cases R&DE staff and
leadership were genuinely excited to collabo
rate with students and worked hard to ac
commodate our needs and concerns.
In other cost-of-living issues, we have
been working with ITSS, Residential Com
puting and the Bursar's office to configure a
system through which basic Internet and
phone charges will be paid for on the Uni
versity bill instead of through monthly pay
ments. Before a new payment program is
rolled out, students will be again surveyed
for their opinions and invited to attend focus
groups to help shape the initiative.
Another group has been working on
printing costs, assessing the various ways in
which printing can be charged. It will require

conversations between multiple parts of the
University to configure a printing program
that will truly be affordable and beneficial to
students, either through quarterly quotas, a
self-monitored quarterly bill or another op
tion. There will be a survey to gauge student
support for the different proposed options.
Finally, the astronomical pricing of books on
campus is being addressed through the ASSU
Books Service and greater education for facul
ty on cheaper alternatives for reading materials.
There are always improvements to be
made in the area of cost of living, and it is im
portant that students critically examine and
assess all student costs, including the services
that are provided to them by an entity such as
R&DE. However, it can be counter-produc
tive when students fail to do their research
and instead make accusations that are false.
One of the major issues that we must
work with R&DE to address is that of the
high cost of summer meal plans. Students
who would like to live on campus over the
summer sometimes find the cost and inflexi
bility of the meal plans offered prohibitive.

This is not a glamorous or sexy issue, but it is
important and will require dedication from
both R&DE staff and students in order to be
successfully addressed.
In my own experiences and the experiences
of the ASSU this year, R&DE has been very
receptive to student concerns and suggestions.
There are dining and undergraduate as well as
graduate housing committees in place to tack
le issues within these departments. We need
competent and motivated students to serve on
these committees — apply through ASSU
NomCom, applications are due this Thursday
— and we need you to voice what issues you
would like to see addressed.
In the future I hope to see The Daily do
more in-depth coverage of the issues and less
passing of inflammatory accusations. We
need to have our press working to inform us
of what is being done and what we as stu
dents need to organize to address.

ments. Before a new payment program is
rolled out, students will be again surveyed
for their opinions and invited to attend focus
groups to help shape the initiative.
Another group has been working on
printing costs, assessing the various ways in
which printing can be charged. It will require

conversations between multiple parts of the
University to configure a printing program
that will truly be affordable and beneficial to
students, either through quarterly quotas, a
self-monitored quarterly bill or another op
tion. There will be a survey to gauge student
support for the different proposed options.
Finally, the astronomical pricing of books on
campus is being addressed through the ASSU
Books Service and greater education for facul
ty on cheaper alternatives for reading materials.
There are always improvements to be
made in the area of cost of living, and it is im
portant that students critically examine and
assess all student costs, including the services
that are provided to them by an entity such as
R&DE. However, it can be counter-produc
tive when students fail to do their research
and instead make accusations that are false.
One of the major issues that we must
work with R&DE to address is that of the
high cost of summer meal plans. Students
who would like to live on campus over the
summer sometimes find the cost and inflexi
bility of the meal plans offered prohibitive.

This is not a glamorous or sexy issue, but it is
important and will require dedication from
both R&DE staff and students in order to be
successfully addressed.
In my own experiences and the experiences
of the ASSU this year, R&DE has been very
receptive to student concerns and suggestions.
There are dining and undergraduate as well as
graduate housing committees in place to tack
le issues within these departments. We need
competent and motivated students to serve on
these committees — apply through ASSU
NomCom, applications are due this Thursday
— and we need you to voice what issues you
would like to see addressed.
In the future I hope to see The Daily do
more in-depth coverage of the issues and less
passing of inflammatory accusations. We
need to have our press working to inform us
of what is being done and what we as stu
dents need to organize to address.

On April 19, The Daily published an inap
propriate and misguided editorial on Stan
ford Residential and Dining Enterprises
(R&DE), the auxiliary branch of the Univer
sity that manages student dining and housing.
Contrary to what the editorial seems to
imply, Shirley Everett, the associate vice
provost in charge of R&DE and all of its op
erations, has always been quick and respon
sive in meeting with me. The editorial also
made unjustified claims about the quality
and pricing competitiveness of the services
offered by R&DE, and about the organiza
tion's willingness to work on student issues.
What was most frustrating about the editori
al was its failure to illuminate any concrete
issues that students have expressed they
would like to see headway made on.
In reading this editorial, two things were
evident to me: First, everything you read in
the media must be taken with a grain of salt.
Second, and more importantly, some serious

education around cost-of-living issues and
what has been accomplished as well as what is
currently being worked on needs to be done.
In a survey conducted by the previous
ASSU Executive, students responded over
whelmingly that their primary concern and
area for desired student-life improvement
was cost of living. As such, we have tried to
tackle issues in this arena, and oftentimes
we have worked closely with the staff of
R&DE to do so.
At the beginning of this year, we held
focus groups and conducted a survey with
Stanford Housing to gauge student senti
ment on the proposed new laundry program.
With greater information provided on its en
vironmental friendliness and cost efficiency,
a large majority of students voted in favor of
the program, and it will be implemented this
coming fall.
With Stanford Dining, we worked to pro
vide student input in the planning of the new
Tresidder downstairs eatery area. Union
Square, and the results have been very satis
factory. Students now have more eating op

tions, including food from all corners of the
globe, and Tresidder feels more like the stu
dent hub that Stanford students have often
felt we're missing.
This year, we collaborated for the first
time with Stanford Dining to host "Primal
Snack," where free Krispy Kreme donuts and
milk were served to students the night before
fall finals. In all these cases R&DE staff and
leadership were genuinely excited to collabo
rate with students and worked hard to ac
commodate our needs and concerns.
In other cost-of-living issues, we have
been working with ITSS, Residential Com
puting and the Bursar's office to configure a
system through which basic Internet and
phone charges will be paid for on the Uni
versity bill instead of through monthly pay
ments. Before a new payment program is
rolled out, students will be again surveyed
for their opinions and invited to attend focus
groups to help shape the initiative.
