# SF official optimistic about gay marriage
## 
### ANDREW GAY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, San Francisco Assessor-Recorder Mabel
Teng and her spouse, Asian American Activities Center Di
rector Rick Yuen, discussed their experiences in marrying
same-sex couples at San Francisco City Hall. Teng ex
pressed optimism about the future of same-sex marriages,
predicting that it was only a matter of time before they were
widely accepted as legal.
From Feb. 12 to March 11, Mabel Teng and her col
leagues at City Hall helped to marry 4,037 same-sex couples
until a court-ordered injunction forced them to stop. Teng
said that she was upholding the California constitution,
which contains an equal-protection clause.
"The essence of our legal argument is that the California
constitution states very strongly that we must provide equal
services to all," Teng said. "I'm very confident that justice is
on our side."
The opponents of same-sex marriages cite California
Proposition 22, which states that marriage is defined as a
union between man and woman. In addition, religious
groups have filed lawsuits against Teng, San Francisco
mayor Gavin Newsom and the county clerk for performing
and organizing same-sex marriages.
Teng said that her inspiration for performing same
sex marriages was a woman who had come to City Hall,
year after year, to ask fora marriage license for her and
her partner.

"Year after year we had to tell her that we cannot issue a
marriage license because the California marriage license
asks fora bride and a groom's signature," Teng said. "This
year though, the Bay Area Reporter ran a story about this
woman's experience and I asked the city hall lawyer, 'Why
can't we do this?' A week after the story appeared in the Re
porter, the mayor decided to do it."
In order to allow the marriages, the marriage form had
to be revised to change bride and groom to applicant one
and applicant two. Teng said she decided to marry the first
couple, two women who had been together for 51 years, at
10 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 12 in her office. To keep the
media from interfering, Teng decided to quietly inform
members of the community that they would be offering
these services.
From then on, marrying the number of couples who
came to City Hall became a logistical nightmare, Teng
said.
"Typically we marry about 20 couples a day. The first day
we offered these services, 90 couples arrived," Teng re
marked. "At that point, we made the decision that we would
marry everyone."
The next day, there were 500 couples at 7 a.m. waiting for
City Hall to open. City Hall employees could not hire any
additional staff or work paid overtime because the oppo
nents of same-sex marriages would attack them for using
taxpayer money to perform illegal, "fringe" activities, Teng
said. With only five outdated computers able to handle mar
riage certification, Teng knew that the system was not pre

pared to handle this.
"Luckily we had many city workers and volunteers who
rose to the occasion to help us marry 585 by the end of Fri
day." Teng said.
One of those volunteers was Teng's spouse Rick Yuen,
who is also the assistant dean of students. Yuen, who has
worked at Stanford for the past 15 years, became a depu
tized marriage officer and conducted more than 100 same
sex marriages over the course of the weekend.
"It was an honor to participate in same-sex marriages in
San Francisco," Yuen said. "I wanted to be a part of this im
portant historical event."
As the weekend went on, city workers and volunteers
worked for free on Saturday, Sunday and Monday —
President's Day — to marry over 2,000 couples. Despite
the injunction on same-sex marriages, Teng said she re
mains optimistic about the future of same-sex marriage
in California, comparing the obstacles same-sex mar
riages face to those faced by interracial marriages in the
past century.
"In 1946, the California Supreme Court ruled that inter
racial marriages were legal but it took more than 20 years
later for the U.S. Supreme Court to take similar action in
1967," Teng said. "This is going to take a lot of courage and
legal action to articulate our argument, but the state and
U.S. Constitutions are on our side."
The event was sponsored by the Office for Religious
Life, the LGBT Community Resources Center and the
Women's Community Center.

these services.
From then on, marrying the number of couples who
came to City Hall became a logistical nightmare, Teng
said.
"Typically we marry about 20 couples a day. The first day
we offered these services, 90 couples arrived," Teng re
marked. "At that point, we made the decision that we would
marry everyone."
The next day, there were 500 couples at 7 a.m. waiting for
City Hall to open. City Hall employees could not hire any
additional staff or work paid overtime because the oppo
nents of same-sex marriages would attack them for using
taxpayer money to perform illegal, "fringe" activities, Teng
said. With only five outdated computers able to handle mar
riage certification, Teng knew that the system was not pre

pared to handle this.
"Luckily we had many city workers and volunteers who
rose to the occasion to help us marry 585 by the end of Fri
day." Teng said.
One of those volunteers was Teng's spouse Rick Yuen,
who is also the assistant dean of students. Yuen, who has
worked at Stanford for the past 15 years, became a depu
tized marriage officer and conducted more than 100 same
sex marriages over the course of the weekend.
"It was an honor to participate in same-sex marriages in
San Francisco," Yuen said. "I wanted to be a part of this im
portant historical event."
As the weekend went on, city workers and volunteers
worked for free on Saturday, Sunday and Monday —
President's Day — to marry over 2,000 couples. Despite
the injunction on same-sex marriages, Teng said she re
mains optimistic about the future of same-sex marriage
in California, comparing the obstacles same-sex mar
riages face to those faced by interracial marriages in the
past century.
"In 1946, the California Supreme Court ruled that inter
racial marriages were legal but it took more than 20 years
later for the U.S. Supreme Court to take similar action in
1967," Teng said. "This is going to take a lot of courage and
legal action to articulate our argument, but the state and
U.S. Constitutions are on our side."
The event was sponsored by the Office for Religious
Life, the LGBT Community Resources Center and the
Women's Community Center.
