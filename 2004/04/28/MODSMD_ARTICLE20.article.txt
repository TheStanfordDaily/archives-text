# Sports
## An open letter to Julie Ruvolo 
### 
Dearest Julie Ruvolo:
You'd come close before. You had me on the
edge, but this was the breaking point. Hating
sports is a questionable practice, albeit com
pletely understandable if you're a woman. But
when you made fun of the women that actually
enjoy spending quality time on the couch in
front of the game, you crossed the line. Such an
gels are not to be mocked and I feel compelled
by God himself to lash out at she who would be
smirch their good names.
Nobody expects you to fake an interest in
sports. In fact, please don't. This will immediately
weed you out of the desirable pool of women for
the straight males who enjoy sports. In addition to
saving your would-be lover from a self-inflicted
shotgun blast in the mouth after hours of inane
chatter, you'll free up hours of time that could be
spent in Brazilian tanning salons.
You say you're all about feminist causes. Then
how about a hand for all those empowered women
who have a legitimate passion for sports, who can
spend an afternoon on the couch with their hus
bands and watch the game, and who don't mind
beer? If anything, the modern woman should be

able to destroy the labels of
being unathletic and confused
by sports — perhaps by sharing
them with her partner.
Riddle me this, though:
Whose fault is it if a woman
marries a man knowing that his
love for sports would become an
obstacle in their relationship?
Men, as a group, like sports.
Chances are, if you don't enjoy

sports at least a little, this is a strike against you in
the male mental ehecklist. While I'm sure your fu
ture husband will he someone who is as physically
sculpted as the athletes you worship without any of
that pesky interest in sports themselves, it might be
a good idea to brush up on some other qualities
that are appealing to males ... Like shutting the
hell up.
What's worse is the fact that your column is
usually the sole female presence in the sports sec
tion. According to what seems to appear in The
Daily, the woman's opinion on Cardinal athletics
can be addressed in two phrases: 1) Athletes are
attractive and 2) Sports are boring. Thanks very
much. Peg Bundy, for summarizing the stereotyp
ical woman's view on sports. In addition to rein
forcing guys' view of girls as sports-hating
princesses, you've taught girls the lesson that lik
ing sports is somehow a concession to our patriar
chal culture.
While this approach has produced a DiMaggio
like streak of riveting pieces about tanning and
Stanford sweats, it leaves the average guy here
with an underwhelming opinion of Cardinal
women that results in an unfortunate dichotomy
between sports-loving men and women that do ...
well, whatever women do on the weekend during
the day. In fact, this may be stretching it a little, but
I would go so far as to say that all the misogyny in
the universe is a direct consequence of your col
umn. The intensity of your vocal desire to sleep
with the water polo team is matched only by the in
tensity of my wish for you to stop corrupting the fu
ture woman of my dreams — a girl who can follow
the standings and be pretty in pink.
The Stanford male looking fora partner to
share his love for sports with is left only with you,
Julie. So, in your own words, why fake it? Move
your column away from the section so ironically
entitled "Sports" and into a more appropriate part
of The Daily, like "Cliched Sexual Jokes" or "In
coherent Rambling," where you can more ade
quately embrace your hatred for all things ESPN.
We, the Stanford men who like sports, aren't
looking for much. Please don't destroy what little
resources we have left to work with. We don't
mind if you like the commercials more than the
game itself, but do us a favor and try a little bit. We
know it's a sacrifice, and we are willing to make
similar sacrifices, but sports are part of who we are.
Julie, you can be so much more — I believe in
you. You can be a herald for those girls that love
sports. Being a "good male companion" isn't
about faking interest in"the game" — it's about
being who you are, and I appreciate your honesty.
But when you abuse those who truly do share their
husbands' and boyfriends' love for sport, you in
sult men and women alike.

edge, but this was the breaking point. Hating
sports is a questionable practice, albeit com
pletely understandable if you're a woman. But
when you made fun of the women that actually
enjoy spending quality time on the couch in
front of the game, you crossed the line. Such an
gels are not to be mocked and I feel compelled
by God himself to lash out at she who would be
smirch their good names.
Nobody expects you to fake an interest in
sports. In fact, please don't. This will immediately
weed you out of the desirable pool of women for
the straight males who enjoy sports. In addition to
saving your would-be lover from a self-inflicted
shotgun blast in the mouth after hours of inane
chatter, you'll free up hours of time that could be
spent in Brazilian tanning salons.
You say you're all about feminist causes. Then
how about a hand for all those empowered women
who have a legitimate passion for sports, who can
spend an afternoon on the couch with their hus
bands and watch the game, and who don't mind
beer? If anything, the modern woman should be

able to destroy the labels of
being unathletic and confused
by sports — perhaps by sharing
them with her partner.
Riddle me this, though:
Whose fault is it if a woman
marries a man knowing that his
love for sports would become an
obstacle in their relationship?
Men, as a group, like sports.
Chances are, if you don't enjoy

sports at least a little, this is a strike against you in
the male mental ehecklist. While I'm sure your fu
ture husband will he someone who is as physically
sculpted as the athletes you worship without any of
that pesky interest in sports themselves, it might be
a good idea to brush up on some other qualities
that are appealing to males ... Like shutting the
hell up.
What's worse is the fact that your column is
usually the sole female presence in the sports sec
tion. According to what seems to appear in The
Daily, the woman's opinion on Cardinal athletics
can be addressed in two phrases: 1) Athletes are
attractive and 2) Sports are boring. Thanks very
much. Peg Bundy, for summarizing the stereotyp
ical woman's view on sports. In addition to rein
forcing guys' view of girls as sports-hating
princesses, you've taught girls the lesson that lik
ing sports is somehow a concession to our patriar
chal culture.
While this approach has produced a DiMaggio
like streak of riveting pieces about tanning and
Stanford sweats, it leaves the average guy here
with an underwhelming opinion of Cardinal
women that results in an unfortunate dichotomy
between sports-loving men and women that do ...
well, whatever women do on the weekend during
the day. In fact, this may be stretching it a little, but
I would go so far as to say that all the misogyny in
the universe is a direct consequence of your col
umn. The intensity of your vocal desire to sleep
with the water polo team is matched only by the in
tensity of my wish for you to stop corrupting the fu
ture woman of my dreams — a girl who can follow
the standings and be pretty in pink.
The Stanford male looking fora partner to
share his love for sports with is left only with you,
Julie. So, in your own words, why fake it? Move
your column away from the section so ironically
entitled "Sports" and into a more appropriate part
of The Daily, like "Cliched Sexual Jokes" or "In
coherent Rambling," where you can more ade
quately embrace your hatred for all things ESPN.
We, the Stanford men who like sports, aren't
looking for much. Please don't destroy what little
resources we have left to work with. We don't
mind if you like the commercials more than the
game itself, but do us a favor and try a little bit. We
know it's a sacrifice, and we are willing to make
similar sacrifices, but sports are part of who we are.
Julie, you can be so much more — I believe in
you. You can be a herald for those girls that love
sports. Being a "good male companion" isn't
about faking interest in"the game" — it's about
being who you are, and I appreciate your honesty.
But when you abuse those who truly do share their
husbands' and boyfriends' love for sport, you in
sult men and women alike.
