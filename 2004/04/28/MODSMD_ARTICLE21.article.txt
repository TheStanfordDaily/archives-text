# Card defeats SCU in 14
## 
### JESSICA PETERS DESK EDITOR 
The No. 2 Stanford baseball squad
(32-6) defeated Santa Clara (19-24) last
night at Buck Shaw Stadium, 12-8. But
the run totals don't even begin to tell
the story.
By the close of a total of 14 innings,
the Cardinal had been playing for five
hours, 18 minutes. The teams racked up
30 hits combined and sent a total 15
pitchers out to the mound.
When the stadium sprinklers went off
at 11 p.m., it was probably a sign that the
game needed to end.
And Stanford did end it, with a four
run, eight-batter rally in the 14th inning
to break an 8-8 tie.
"1 think the biggest thing was staying
positive and keeping focused," said
freshman right fielder Jim Rapoport,
whose base knock drove in two of the
Cardinal's four final-inning runs.
Stanford was behind for several in
nings and faced a 7-5 deficit in the fifth,
but senior David O'Hagan and sopho
more Kodiak Quick gave the Cardinal a
combined 3 2/3 scoreless innings,
which gave the team's bats a chance to
switch on.
Sophomore Jed Lowrie got his 13th
jack of the season in the seventh and
scored a run in the ninth — after boos!
ing a double into right field — to bring
about a 7-7 tie.
Enter freshman southpaw Blake Holler.
Holler, who has struggled lately in his
starting role, put together a near-perfect
performance beginning in the ninth
frame, sending the contest into extra in
nings. The lefty fanned five batters in
four scoreless innings of work to keep
the Cardinal in the game.
"It was probably the most pressure
packed situation I've faced this year,"
Holler said. "The game was tied and I
know if I give up a run, this thing's over.
But when I got out there, everything just
felt unbelievable."
Not all pitchers fared as well as
Holler. Freshman Jeff Stimpson took
the mound in the bottom of the fifth

with a 5-3 lead —
and was promptly
bucked by the
heart of the Bron
co lineup.
After sending
Santa Clara leadoff
man Ryan Chiarelli
back to the dugout,
Stimpson struggled
with the next two
batters and then
gave up a three-run
shot to Broncos
cleanup hitter Will
Thompson. Santa
Clara went back-to
back on Stimpson,
as National Player
of the Week Nic
Crosta hit his fifth
dinger in his past
five games.
Freshman Matt
Leva also hit a rough
spot in his 13th-in
ning outing and had
to be bailed out by ju
nior reliever Drew
Ehrlich, who gar
nered the win and
drew high praise
from head coach
Mark Marquess for
his control in the final
innings of the game.
The Cardinal of
fense managed to
match the resiliency
of the pitching at
Santa Clara, despite
the fact that the
hard-hitting Stan
ford bats were so re-

cently absent in the Cardinal's 2-1 week
end loss to Sacramento State. The entire
Stanford lineup was able to contribute
to last night's 12-run output.
Lowrie and junior Danny Putnam

ond career four-hit game. The duo

combined for four runs scored, three doubles,
three RBIs and a home run. Rapoport and ju
nior catcher Donny Lucy also chipped in mul
tiple-hit games, as each notched two hits on
the night.
"We were just concentrating the whole time,
and that's hard to do when you play 14 innings,"
Lowrie said.
Santa Clara head coach Mark O'Brien was
forced to pull out every resource in his bullpen,
including a weekend starter (Chad Fillinger)

and his star closer (Anthony Rea, who threw
five 1 / 3 innings).
By the end of the marathon, the crowd of
spectators had dwindled from a few hundred to
a few handfuls and the Cardinal players wore
thrilled hut exhausted expressions as they left
the stadium victorious.
Lowrie managed a smile at the game's finish
and described the mindset of the whole team all
in one sentence.
"I'm gonna go to sleep now," he said.
The Cardinal resumes conference play this
weekend when it faces Washington State at
Sunken Diamond. Game time is 6 p.m. on
Friday and 1 p.m. for the Saturday and Sun
day contests.
