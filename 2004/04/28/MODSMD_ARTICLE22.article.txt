# Santa Clara closer saves his best for No. 2 Card
## 
### NATHAN KURZ STAFF WRITER 
Anthony Rea loves playing against Stanford. And
why not? He grew up in Palo Alto, idolizing such ex-
Card pitchers like Tony Cogan, and both his parents got
their doctorates from the school. The best part is that
he's saved some of his top collegiate performances for
the Cardinal hitters.
In consecutive years, Rea has now set career highs in
strikeouts against Stanford. Last year, he struck out four
in two innings. Last night, the redshirt junior closer set a
new career mark with six strikeouts in a season-high 5 1 /
3 shutout innings.
And yes, he did blow the save in the ninth when his wild
pitch bounced high off the backstop, allowing Jed Lowrie
to score the tying run in the interim.
But he kept the Broncos in the game during his next
three innings of work, only to see them manage zilch on
the scoreboard.
The most impressive stat about the local native?
He's second in the country with 11 saves — and he's al
ready set the single-season mark for most saves by a Santa
Clara pitcher, breaking the mark tied last year by fresh
man sensation Patrick Overholt.
"It's just a product of our team winning a lot of close
ballgames," said Rea in a modest understatement.
Remember, Rea was supposed to be the set-up man
entering the season.
Overholt was named a Freshman All-American last
season when he went 4-4 with a 3.00 ERA and had the 10
saves. But the promising sophomore injured his right arm
severely in January — ending his season and thrusting
Rea into the role he held as a freshman.

Thus far, Rea has rel
ished the role.
He leads the team in
ERA (2.20), strikeout
to-walk ratio (5.2:1),
opponents' batting av
erage (.197) and, of
course, saves.
"He's a very compet
itive person and that
helps him in the save sit
uations," said Santa
Clara manager Mark
O'Brien. "He always

comes in and gives you his best effort. When he has this
much talent and can throw strikes, it makes him very hard
to hit."
O'Brien said he isn't surprised Rea has adjusted quite
nicely to the closer role.
"Anthony is very composed," he said. "He doesn't let
too many things bother him, and that's exactly the outlook
you need when you're a closer."
Rea struggled as a freshman, posting a 6.27 ERA and
allowing 51 hits in 37 1 / 3 innings while going 0-3 as a part
time closer. In the offseason, he suffered a freak injury
when he blew out his right shoulder and was forced to red
shirt the entire 2002 season.
But he came back with a new determination after the
injury and earned the team's comeback player of the
year award when he led the Broncos in appearances with
37 as the set-up man and posted a solid 3.05 ERA with
two saves.
Now he's one of the best closers in the country — but
he seems to be taking the same outlook he has for years.

"1 just try to keep the same attitude," he said. "I try to
take it one pitch at a time and handle each batter. It's nice
that I can put in the max effort, but there really isn't too
much difference."
Rea showcased his competitiveness last night with his
longest outing of the season. Rea said he had done some
spot-starting in his career, but last night must have felt like
high school — when he was solely a starter.
Speaking of high school, while Rea was at nearby
Gunn High School; he'd come out to Sunken Diamond
with his dad, Ed — who played baseball at Cal Tech in his
undergraduate years — to soak up some serious baseball.
Rea claims he hasn't changed his game too much
since high school. He's added a split-finger fastball to his
array of fastball, changeup and slider. It's important to
remember that Rea is only 5-foot-11 and possesses a fast
ball that tops out at 85 miles per hour, so his key pitch is
a deadly change-up.
Despite these not-so-impressive physical tools or stuff,

Junior catcher Donny Lucy came through on offense for the Cardinal with two base-hits on the
night in Stanford's marathon victory.
O'Brien seems to think Rea has a real future
ahead of him.
"If this kid can come back next year and do
these same things, I think there are going to be
a few teams wanting him to play professional
ly," he said.

Now the most important question for Rea:
Did he ever think about trying to come to Stan
ford for baseball?
"No, it wasn't really an option," he said.
"I considered it for academics but my
parents didn't put any pressure on me to
go there."
But wouldn't he consider this his dream school?
"Well, sure," he said. "But things have
worked out just fine at Santa Clara."
They sure have.
Just ask the Cardinal hitters.
