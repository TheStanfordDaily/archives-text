# Men's lacrosse ends season with loss to Cal Poly
## Injuries too much to overcome for Card 
### NATHANIEL MYALL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's lacrosse
team's injury-ridden season came to
an end on Saturday after a 10-4 loss
to No. 12 Cal Poly. For the second
straight year, following last year's

loss to Sonoma State, the Cardinal
(6-8, 4-2 West Coast Lacrosse
League) was handed a first-round
exit from the WCLL Tournament.
Playing at Cal Poly on a warm
Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal
came into the game looking to
avenge its earlier home loss to

the Mustangs. The team's main
focus was to stop standout at
tacker Tim Casey, who racked up
three goals and an assist during
their last meeting.
The Cardinal got on hoard
quickly when junior attacker
Brooks Kinkaid found the net
within the first minute of play.
However, the Mustangs respond
ed with three goals of their own,
two from Conor Leclair and one
from Kenny Williams.
The second quarter followed
exactly the same pattern as the
first with the Cardinal scoring one
goal and the Mustangs responding

with three to take a 6-2 lead going
into halftime.
Although the Cardinal defense
was able to limit Casey to just one
goal on very few touches throughout
the game, Cal Poly proved to have
too many offensive weapons. The
Mustangs came out firing in the sec
ond half, scoring three goals in the
third quarter, including one from
midfielder Leclair, who finished the
game with a hat trick.
Led by sophomore midfielder
Tyler Gutierrez, the Cardinal finally
found the net again, scoring two
goals in the final two minutes of play.
Sophomore goaltender Michael

Zell, despite playing behind an in
jured defense, finished the game
with an impressive 20 saves.
Coming into the season as a con
tender to take home the WCLL title,
the Cardinal was ultimately brought
down by injuries to its veteran de
fensive line.
Senior defensemen Matt Twom
ey and Ben Spohn and sophomore
defensemen Brian Goodman all saw
limited playing time throughout the
year with respective back, knee and
foot injuries. Also, sophomore mid
fielder Malcolm Brown, one of the
team's top defensive midfielders,
was out for almost the entire season

with a knee injury.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal
played well enough to earn the third
playoff spot in a stacked conference
that boasted teams such as Sonoma
State, Cal Poly and Chico State, all
ranked in the top 25.
"I thought that we were going to
limit opponents to four goals a game
and go deep in the national tourna
ment," said senior defensemen K.C.
Lukens, who played his last game in
a Stanford uniform on Saturday.
"However, I'm just as proud of the
way this season turned out as I
would have been had we won a na
tional championship."
