# Cycling takes third at home

The regular season ended last
weekend with Stanford's home
race and some spectacular final
performances by the Cardinal.
Both the men's and women's A
teams came away with third place
in the first event, the team time
trial starting from Canada Road
early on Saturday morning.
In the afternoon the competi
tors then headed across the bay
for the Criterium. As the tightly
bunched women's A pack ap
proached the final straightaway of
a 1.3-mile, 18-lap race Mary Haw
broke away on a breath-taking
sprint to storm to first place. The
fact that this was her first race in
the women's A's only served to
emphasize her great performance.
In complete contrast, freshman
Rand Miller broke early on the
second lap of the men's B race. He
managed to stay ahead and con
trol the race for the next 10 laps
before finally being caught by the
chasing pack as the end neared.
The men's A Criterium race
was the final event of the day and
included an unprecedented seven
riders for the Cardinal over the 24-
lap course. Some of the most ag
gressive racing all season followed
with attacks and breakaways on
every lap. Keeping pace with the
competition the Stanford team
members ensured they had at
least one rider in every attack and
more than once were the only
team with two riders at the front.
In the last four laps, a large group
broke away and held off the chas
ing field until the end. As the laps
counted down the size of the lead
ing group slowly dropped to four
riders, including Stanford's Tyler
Hester, but in the final sprint the
pack surged back to catch them at
the line. In the last second, Hester

lost his hold on fourth place to a
rider from Cal.
Now the team is preparing for
the West Coast Conference
Championships at Cal Poly next
weekend where they hope to qual
ify for Nationals
Rugby
This weekend Stanford will be
hosting the finals of the National
Collegiate Championships (both
Divisions I and II) at Steuber
Family Rugby Field.
On Friday the four remaining
teams in both the men's and
women's Division I Champi
onship will play in the semifinals,
hoping to progress through to the
finals on Saturday.
The women's games start at 10
a.m. with Princeton vs. Virginia
followed by Penn State vs. Naval
Academy at noon. All hail from
the mid-Atlantic and play each
other regularly, so expect plenty
of rivalry as Penn State and
Princeton hope to repeat their
past successes and the other two
teams fight to stop them.
At 2 p.m., the men's semis begin
with Cal vs. Navy and continue at 4
p.m. with Cal Poly vs. Air Force.
Air Force comes in as defending
champion while perennially strong
Cal makes its 14th consecutive ap
pearance at this level
Saturday's action will kick off
at 10 a.m. with the Division II
women's final, a matchup be
tween Temple and Providence. At
noon, the Division I title will be
decided.
The men's Division II Champi
onship will be decided at 2 p.m.
when Salisbury and Arkansas
State square off. This is Salis
bury's first appearance, while
Arkansas has equaled its success
from 2001 and hope to go one bet
ter. Finally at 4 p.m., the Division
I men will round off an intense few
days of high-level rugby.
