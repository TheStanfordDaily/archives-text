# Purity of sport found on waves
## 
### 
Hopopu. Hawaiian for high on life —
especially on the waves. Mainlanders
refer to it as stoked. Fete Cabrinha's
friend alluded to it as ' Holy crap.
Pete ... that was a bomb!" Pete referred to it as
simply a "little warm-up wave." A wave that
landed him a $70,000 paycheck and his name in
the record books.
The world record for the biggest wave ridden
was shattered at Billabong's XXL Global Big
Wave Awards. Maui's world-famous North
Shore break, Jaws, January 10, was the date and
place of a ride that thrust Cabrinha under one of
surfing's brightest spotlights. It was just another
day of cruising 40-foot breakers when Pete de
cided to have his jet-ski partner tow him out
past the break to test out the brand new board
he was riding and a monster set came in, includ
ing the 70-footer Cabrinha just so happened to
throw down in everyday fashion.
The Billabong XXL contest featured a
$60,000 grand prize plus $1,000 for each addi
tional foot over 60 the surfed wave measured.
$70,000 dollars, one wave. But don't go buying

a pair of boardshorts for every
day of the week quite yet. This
was a 70-foot tall wave. The
average life insurance policy
values life between $500,000
and $4,000,000. Michael Jor
dan made over $30,000 per
game his last season with the
Bulls. A-Rod earned $50,000
per home run last year. John
Daly earned $80,000 to sport a
Trim Spa loeo dolo.

Sure the money is still there, and the top
surfers are doing just fine with the girls and
sponsorships — the Paul Mitchell competitions
infiltrate the planet with $3,000 contests — but
this is still clearly a sport running off the sheer
joy on which its seafaring Polynesian creators
founded it.
Hopopu. From the smile of a kindergartner
catching his first wave to the wide-eyed gaze of
a surfer seeking the exit from a under a 10-foot
tube. Hangin' loose. Not in baseball. Not in
football. Not in basketball. Sure these other pro
sports get players and fans pumped up, and a
handful of athletes including the entire Red Sox
roster hang loose in their maternity outfit uni
forms and "Castaway" hairstyles, but this is a
different kind of triumph.
The mainstream pro sports can only offer
the ability to immerse their players and fans
in a fantasy world of athletic combat. At the
end, one team has always conquered the
other. Great athletes have played such sports.
But the test always remains one athlete's bat
tle against and victory over the game's man
made constraints. Sosa's 540-foot bombs in
the 2001 home run derby. Leßron's head
above the rim. Michael Vick on a OB draw.
All unbelievable. All triumphs over other
athletes and man-made limitations.
Triumph over nature, though, remains at the
roots of a surfing culture of which the ultimate
goal is hopopu. Conquering the earth on a plank
of wood hand-crafted from a tree. Testing out a
new board on 70-foot waves. The old man in a
wetsuit bobbing in Half Moon Bay at 6:30 in the
morning. The eight-year-old riding a break off a
rocky jetty in Gloucester, Mass., as his salty
black lab looks on attentively from a gravel
beach. The 23-year-old Khalil Greene look
alike who sold off school and his textbooks fora
longboard and a little pooch to ride shotgun.
They all inadvertently, instinctually seek the
same goal that is the entire underlying premise
of sport.
To get outside, choose a physical task to ac
complish. develop and mold a piece of equip
ment, practice with it, practice on it, a year, a
decade, a lifetime. A lifetime. Pete Cabrinha
has been riding waves for 40 years. Learning,
improving, crashing, recovering, growing, im
proving. Living. And why do we? All to prepare
fora date with triumph in that once in a lifetime
moment when the big one comes along.
The fact that surfing remains pure even at its
top levels, that there are 43-year-old men plac
ing themselves in tsunami waves and exiting
them with radiant grins. The fact that the prize
for performing such a feat is far less than awards
of feats of far less greatness in all other pro sport
— yet riders could care less. All push to the so
lidification that there's something more reward
ing than any shoe deal, mansion, or shattered
record at stake in sport: owning life.
Hopopu.
