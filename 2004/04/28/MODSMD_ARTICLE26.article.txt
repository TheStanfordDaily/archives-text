## Colleges offer casino-gaming classes 
### LOKA ASHWOOD DAILY NORTHWESTERN 
(U-WIRE) EVANSTON, 111. â€”
With employee payrolls at casinos
such as Caesars Palace and Harrah's
exceeding $270 million per year,
some universities now are recogniz
ing casino management as a viable
job field.
Michigan State University, Uni
versity of Massachusetts and Tulane
University are among the colleges
that recently began offering casino
gaming classes.
The specialization found in gam
ing courses is invaluable for under
graduate and graduate students, said
Prof. Kathleen Brewer, the director
of Graduate Studies at the College
of Hotel Administration at the Uni
versity of Nevada in Las Vegas. Al
though casinos currently look for
employees with general business de

grees, Brewer said that expectation
could change.
"If you're looking at current casi
nos, it's corporate America, so they
like business degrees," she said.
" The future is toward having more
specific degrees."
And that future can be found in
gaming. Brewer said. The UNLV
College of Hotel Administration
is considering expanding its cur
rent curriculum, which now in
cludes Introduction to the Casino
and Protection of Casino Table
Games, to create a degree specific
to gaming.
Harrah's Entertainment, central
to the formation of UNLV's hotel
administration college, operates 26
casinos in 13 states throughout the
country, but its spokesman, Gary
Thompson, said specialized degrees
are not needed.
"[Gaming degrees) definitely

wouldn't be a bad idea but they're
certainly not necessary," he said.
Whether or not gaming classes
are viable. Northwestern University
administrators maintain the casino
related courses won't be coming to
NU any time soon.
Weinberg Academic Dean
Daniel Linzer said gaming courses
have little to offer to an arts and sci
ences degree.
"(Gaming courses] don't fit with
a liberal arts education." Linzer said.
"I cannot see why we would offer
pre-professional courses in working
in casinos."
Linzer said gaming courses
would not be relevant to business
classes but could benefit other areas
of study. NU students cannot major
in business but can minor in busi
ness institutions.
"I think it's entirely appropriate
to think about courses on the sociol

ogy or psychology of gambling,"
Linzer said. "Those are aspects of
human behavior that may be worth
understanding."
For Kellogg School of Manage
ment Dean Dipak Jain, the question
is not if the degree fits the school but
rather if it meets the employer's
standards. Jain said if something is
lacking from employees, Kellogg lis
tens and fills the void.
"Our focus is on mutual learn
ing," he said. "We look at (busi
ness') needs."
Sandeep Aula, a junior in Alpha
Kappa Psi, NU's business fraternity,
said an addition of gaming courses to
NU's curriculum could prove valu
able in the job market.
"1 don't see anything wrong with
studying the phenomenon," Venka
ta said. "Considering the growing
impact of casinos on the market, I
think it would be relevant."
