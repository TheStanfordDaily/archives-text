### HOLLY WELLS ARIZONA DAILY WILDCAT 
(U-WIRE) TUSCON, Ariz. -
When a University of Arizona stu
dent was walking to class two weeks
ago, she got an unpleasant surprise
from a man hanging around a
l)A building.
Gina, who doesn't want her last
named used because she fears the
man might try to find her. said she
was walking to class on April 12
when a young man walked by and
spit on her.
"I saw him walking toward me,
and at first I thought he was spitting
on the ground, hut the spit hit my
foot, and he turned around and
called me a tramp," she said.
In the past few weeks, several fe
male students have reported being

spit on and verbally assaulted by an
unknown man who hangs around
the Physics and Atmospheric Sci
ences building.
According to police reports,
three weeks ago, an incident similar
to Gina's occurred when a female
student walking by the FAS building
was spit on and called a slut.
The report stated the man de
scribed by the student was also sus
pected of harassing several female
students on previous occasions.
Gina said she was too stunned
at first to say anything to the man.
but she thought about the inci
dent all day.
"No one's ever called me a
tramp before. I was just puzzled by
it," she said.
Gina said the next day, she found
out the same thing had happened to

one of her friends who had been
walking in the same area. Both Gina
and her friend had the same descrip
tion of the man.
Gina said she then decided to
report the incident to the police,
although she did not want to
press charges.
"I thought someone should know
about it since it's happened more
than once," she said. "1 just want po
lice to find him and tell him to stop;
that would be an appropriate action."
Sgt. Eugene Mejia, UAPD
spokesman, said the man's behavior
is unusual.
"It's a criminal act and is dis
ruptive to the university setting."
he said.
Mejia said none of the female stu
dents who have been harassed want
to press charges.

But Mejia said if an officer sees
the man spitting on someone, he
could be charged with disturb
ing the peace. If someone did
decide to press charges, the man
could be charged with harass
ment and assault.
"It's an assault since bodily fluid
is actually hitting the person," Mejia
said, adding that the University of
Arizona could also take disciplinary
action against the man.
Gina said she saw the man who
spit on her later that week but didn't
say anything to him.
"You never know if he could be
unstable. You don't know what he
could do," she said.
Gina said she and her friend do
not take the same route to class
anymore and avoid walking by the
PAS building.
