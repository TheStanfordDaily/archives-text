(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES
— The UCLA Immigrant
Rights Coalition and similar
groups across the nation have
joined together over the past
year to fight for the passage of a
federal bill to help undocument
ed students. Five students were
sent to represent the UCLA
group last week in Washington,
D.C., and to continue lobbying
on Capitol Hill.
The Developmental Relief
Educational Alien Minors Act,
referred to as the DREAM Act,
is a bipartisan bill in the Senate
that would help undocumented
students in the United States fi
nance their college educations
and legalize their status.
Currently, undocumented
students are unable to receive
most scholarships, financial
aid or work study because of
their status.
"This is causing many undoc
umented students to work more
than 40 hours a week during
school to pay their tuition," said
Carlos Mendoza, a fifth-year psy
chology student and a member of
the coalition who participated in
the trip to the U.S. capitol.
The UCLA Immigrant
Rights Coalition is a student-ini
tiated group which works to ad
vocate human rights. The group
started two quarters ago, but of
ficially organized during winter.
Undocumented students
who grew up in the United
States and came to the country
before age 16 and at least five
years before the date of the bill's
enactment would be eligible for
help under the act. They must
also be able to demonstrate
good moral character.
They would also qualify for
conditional lawful permanent
resident status after being ac
cepted to college, graduating
from a U.S. high school or upon
completing the General Educa
tional Developmental test.
This initial stage would last
for six years, during which stu
dents must go to college, join the
military, or complete communi
ty service. After completing one
of these options, students will be
eligible for lawful permanent
resident status.
Not only will undocumented
students be able to change their
legal status, they will also quali
fy for in-state tuition in colleges
across the country and will have
more opportunities to receive fi
nancial aid.
Two years ago. California
passed Assembly Bill 540, a law
much like the DREAM Act,
which allowed undocumented
students to enroll in colleges in
California and pay in-state tu
ition.
While in Washington, D.C.,
students made appointments
with legislatures where they
voiced their concerns and asked
for support for the act. Califor
nia Democratic Senators Di-

Anne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer have already expressed
their support.
To endorse the Dream Act,
students held a mock gradua
tion ceremony last week in
Washington, D.C. Wearing
caps and gowns with signs that
said 'What Now,' the demon
strators showed that 65,000 to
70,000 undocumented students
graduate from high school each
year but don't have access to
higher education.
The UCLA delegation
joined groups from Michigan.
New York, Massachusetts,
Tennessee and Oregon,
among others.
"It was a big crowd," said
Gustavo de Haro, a third-year
psychology student who lob
bied in Washington, D C., last
week. "Around 120 participat
ed in the actual event, and there
were also a couple hundred
supporters."
The students' goal for the
trip was to bring 65,000 letters to
President Bush requesting his
support. They succeeded in get
ting 100,(XX) letters nationwide.
The group brought these
letters with them as they
marched from Capitol Hill to
the U.S. Department of Educa
tion. Because of security rea
sons, the students weren't al
lowed inside the building and
no representative came out to
address them.
"We made an enlarged letter
and gave it to a security guard
who promised to give it to the
appropriate representative,"
said Adelina Huerta, a fourth
year Chicana/o studies student.
The letters will remain with
lobbyists in Washington, D.C.,
until the group decides on its
next course of action.
Though the act has not
passed yet, students say they will
continue to put pressure on Sen
ate Majority Leader Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., to promote the act.
Students also lobbied fora
similar act in the House of Rep
resentatives, the Student Ad
justment Act, which would
change the status of undocu
mented students. But the stu
dents say their main focus re
mained on the DREAM Act be
cause it has more support.
Along with lobbying for the
DREAM Act, the UCLA group
is planning to work on a cam
paign to support workers in Los
Angeles' Korea Town.
The group is made up of 15 to
20 active members, represent
ing student groups such as Latin
American Student Alliance.
MEChA and the Concerned
Asian Pacific Islander Students
for Action.
"There are a lot of issues in
the community that we some
times forget about," Mendoza
said. "We are privileged in a
way where we can do things
for other people. These issues
are affecting all communities,
and we are responsible to ad
vocate for them."

Educational Alien Minors Act,
referred to as the DREAM Act,
is a bipartisan bill in the Senate
that would help undocumented
students in the United States fi
nance their college educations
and legalize their status.
Currently, undocumented
students are unable to receive
most scholarships, financial
aid or work study because of
their status.
"This is causing many undoc
umented students to work more
than 40 hours a week during
school to pay their tuition," said
Carlos Mendoza, a fifth-year psy
chology student and a member of
the coalition who participated in
the trip to the U.S. capitol.
The UCLA Immigrant
Rights Coalition is a student-ini
tiated group which works to ad
vocate human rights. The group
started two quarters ago, but of
ficially organized during winter.
Undocumented students
who grew up in the United
States and came to the country
before age 16 and at least five
years before the date of the bill's
enactment would be eligible for
help under the act. They must
also be able to demonstrate
good moral character.
They would also qualify for
conditional lawful permanent
resident status after being ac
cepted to college, graduating
from a U.S. high school or upon
completing the General Educa
tional Developmental test.
This initial stage would last
for six years, during which stu
dents must go to college, join the
military, or complete communi
ty service. After completing one
of these options, students will be
eligible for lawful permanent
resident status.
Not only will undocumented
students be able to change their
legal status, they will also quali
fy for in-state tuition in colleges
across the country and will have
more opportunities to receive fi
nancial aid.
Two years ago. California
passed Assembly Bill 540, a law
much like the DREAM Act,
which allowed undocumented
students to enroll in colleges in
California and pay in-state tu
ition.
While in Washington, D.C.,
students made appointments
with legislatures where they
voiced their concerns and asked
for support for the act. Califor
nia Democratic Senators Di-

Anne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer have already expressed
their support.
To endorse the Dream Act,
students held a mock gradua
tion ceremony last week in
Washington, D.C. Wearing
caps and gowns with signs that
said 'What Now,' the demon
strators showed that 65,000 to
70,000 undocumented students
graduate from high school each
year but don't have access to
higher education.
The UCLA delegation
joined groups from Michigan.
New York, Massachusetts,
Tennessee and Oregon,
among others.
"It was a big crowd," said
Gustavo de Haro, a third-year
psychology student who lob
bied in Washington, D C., last
week. "Around 120 participat
ed in the actual event, and there
were also a couple hundred
supporters."
The students' goal for the
trip was to bring 65,000 letters to
President Bush requesting his
support. They succeeded in get
ting 100,(XX) letters nationwide.
The group brought these
letters with them as they
marched from Capitol Hill to
the U.S. Department of Educa
tion. Because of security rea
sons, the students weren't al
lowed inside the building and
no representative came out to
address them.
"We made an enlarged letter
and gave it to a security guard
who promised to give it to the
appropriate representative,"
said Adelina Huerta, a fourth
year Chicana/o studies student.
The letters will remain with
lobbyists in Washington, D.C.,
until the group decides on its
next course of action.
Though the act has not
passed yet, students say they will
continue to put pressure on Sen
ate Majority Leader Bill Frist,
R-Tenn., to promote the act.
Students also lobbied fora
similar act in the House of Rep
resentatives, the Student Ad
justment Act, which would
change the status of undocu
mented students. But the stu
dents say their main focus re
mained on the DREAM Act be
cause it has more support.
Along with lobbying for the
DREAM Act, the UCLA group
is planning to work on a cam
paign to support workers in Los
Angeles' Korea Town.
The group is made up of 15 to
20 active members, represent
ing student groups such as Latin
American Student Alliance.
MEChA and the Concerned
Asian Pacific Islander Students
for Action.
"There are a lot of issues in
the community that we some
times forget about," Mendoza
said. "We are privileged in a
way where we can do things
for other people. These issues
are affecting all communities,
and we are responsible to ad
vocate for them."
(U-WIRE) LOS ANGELES
— The UCLA Immigrant

groups across the nation have
