## 
### DAVID HERBERT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The freshly elected ASSU
Undergraduate Senate met for
the first time Tuesday night, ap
proving several funding and lo
gistical bills, electing a new Sen
ate chair and selecting freshman
Ashley Matheus to replace ju
nior Pat Bomhack's vacated
Senate seat.
The Senate meeting began
slowly, as outgoing Senate Chair
Joey Natoli, a junior, waited
nearly 10 minutes for the eight
senators required for quorum
to arrive.
When eight had arrived ar
rived, Natoli introduced the

first order of business, the con
firmation of a new publications
director and assistant director.
This bill passed unanimously,
as did five subsequent pieces of
legislation funding various
minor student groups and ini
tiatives and a bill to appoint
coterminal student Monica
Henestroza to the Constitu
tional Council.
The Senate also elected a new
chair, returning Senator Chris
Lin, a junior. Lin ran unopposed
for the position.
The selection of a 15th sena
tor to replace the seat vacated by
junior Pat Bomhack, who relin
quished his position shortly after
being elected, was Tuesday's

main action. The choice was be
tween Matheus and sophomore
George Hill, who tied for 16th
place in the general election with
662 votes each. The candidates
each gave a brief speech and an
swered questions from senators
about what their policy goals
would be if elected.
Matheus stressed the impor
tance of increasing school spirit
and starting new traditions. This
included creating a basketball
equivalent to football's Big
Game and making sporting
events more exciting and accessi
ble to students.
"I think it would be a great
thing for the Senate to work to
lower ticket prices," she said.

Hill, formerly a senator and
head of the Student Life commit
tee, emphasized his previous ex
perience and pointed to some of
his past accomplishments.
"My biggest achievements
were some of the school-spirit
events," he said.
He went on to point out that
he helped throw the first ASSU
sponsored tailgate with alcohol.
The candidates then left the
room and senators and other
ASSU functionaries debated
before voting in favor of
Matheus 12 to 1.
The evening was not without
its lighter moments. At the start
of the meeting, before a vote
could be called on the bill ap

pointing the publications direc
tor, one spectator in the crowd
who did not identify himself with
any group proposed a motion to
"raise the roof." Another ob
server then seconded the motion,
and the two exited pumping their
hands in the air.
Approximately 10 minutes
later, the two returned, donning
fake moustaches, aviator glasses
and a Montreal Expos batting
helmet and declared their intent
to make a "motion for lotion."
The prankster then raised his
shirt while his accomplice rubbed
moisturizer on his stomach. Nei
ther motion was put to a vote,
much to the consternation of the
Constitutional Committee.
