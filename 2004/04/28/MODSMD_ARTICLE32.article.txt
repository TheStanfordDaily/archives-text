## Princeton faculty approve anti-grade inflation proposal 
### ALYSON ZUREICK THE DAILY PRINCETONIAN 
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
In an almost two to one decision,
the Princeton University faculty
voted Monday to approve the anti
grade inflation proposals released
earlier this month by the Committee
on Examinations and Standing. Fac
ulty debated the proposals for about
40 minutes and then approved them,
156 to 84.
"We had a thoughtful and ex
tended discussion today and now
we need to get to work to imple
ment the proposals in the most
thoughtful and sensitive way possi
ble." Nancy Weiss Makiel, dean of
the college and one of the primary
authors of the proposals, said after
the faculty meeting.
The vote is the first step by a se
lective university in recent years to
curb a steady rise in grades — ana

tionwide trend — and is the culmina
tion of more than two weeks of con
tentious campus debate conducted
under national media scrutiny.
The approved proposals set an
"expectation" — rather than a
"limit," as originally proposed — of
35 percent A-range grades among
undergraduate courses in each de
partment and 55 percent A-range
grades in independent work, after an
amendment set out the new lan
guage.
The new guidelines will take ef
fect this fall, though Malkiel noted
that the proposals' provisions
would be phased in over a three
year period.
The faculty room of Nassau Hall
was filled to capacity a little after
4:30 Monday as Malkiel introduced
the proposals. Anticipating a num
ber of faculty concerns, Malkiel said
the proposals were "by and of the
faculty" and would not negatively af

feet academic freedom.
"These proposals do not try to tell
faculty how to teach," Malkiel said.
"No faculty member should fail to
give an A to a student who deserves
it. We are asking faculty to enter into
a social contract to bring grade infla
tion back under control, back to the
way we graded at Princeton in the
late eighties and early nineties."
Malkiel also addressed a con
cern among students that small de
partments will be aversely affected
by the proposals because they do
not have the large introductory
classes that Malkiel has said will
undergo the most significant reduc
tion in grades.
Instead, Malkiel said every small
department except one had large
enough introductory classes to offset
the impact of the proposals on
upper-level seminars.
Faculty opinion on the proposals
was mixed. Some faculty members

heralded the proposals as a sign of
Princeton's leadership within the Ivy
League while others expressed con
cern with the potential negative im
pacts on both faculty and students.
"It seems to me that if this pro
posal passes, I will no longer he on an
honor system when grading," Eng
lish professor Esther Schor said. "In
stead, I will be expected to conform
to a one-size-fits-all grading policy,
and with this policy what is to pre
vent a department chair from hold
ing things like teaching assignments
over a junior faculty's head to get
them to comply? This is a liability to
junior faculty."
Other professors argued that the
proposals would provide greater
guidance to junior faculty as well as
help students stand out from their
peers at other universities when ap
plying to jobs and graduate school.
After presentations and debate,
David Botstein, director of the
Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative
Genomics, motioned to end the de
bate and vote. John Fleming of the
English department then proposed a
closed ballot vote.
Christopher Eisgruber, who will
take over as provost next fall, argued
against a closed ballot, saying secre
cy would violate a tradition of open
ness in faculty voting.

The faculty voted in support of
the open ballot.
Despite broad support for the pro
posals, some faculty members felt
that debate had been cut off too soon
and that not enough consideration
had been given to a closed ballot vote.
"I was gratified by the richness of
the faculty discussion and dismayed
at the abrupt calling fora vote,
when the issue was just coming
clearly into focus," said Caryl
Emerson, chair of the Slavic lan
guages and literatures department.
A committee will also be formed
over the next few months to collect
data on grading within each depart
ment and examine the results of the
proposals every fall, with a major re
view scheduled at the end of a three
year phase-in period.
The committee will take into ac
count special circumstances that
may prevent departments from com
plying with the plan's provisions and
then fine-tune implementation ac
cordingly, Malkiel said.
USG President Matt Margolin, a
junior, said the USG will also work
to monitor the implementation of
the proposals this fall and ensure
that student concerns are addressed.
The focus on grade inflation at
Princeton began in 1998, when the
Committee on Examinations and

Standing first released a report
tracking grading patterns at the Uni
versity from 1973 to 1997.
The report revealed a steady rise
in undergraduate grades and set the
stage for additional reports and pro
posals attempting to stem the tide of
rising grades.
Last spring, the Committee on
Examinations and Standings re
turned to the issue only to find that,
despite its efforts to work with indi
vidual departments, grades had con
tinued to rise.
"We took these findings to the
department chairs last spring and
they told us that we had a collective
action problem," Malkiel said. "The
chairs gave us the specific mandate
to formulate a proposal with uni
form grading standards for the Uni
versity and we on the Committee
worked closely with them to refine
the proposal."
The proposals were released to
the faculty earlier this month.
Malkiel subsequently emailed them
to the student body, a day after re
leasing them to the faculty. Howev
er, the communication had been ear
lier than anticipated, she said, be
cause a faculty member gave the
proposals to a colleague in Boston
who in turn leaked them to the
Boston Globe.

"No faculty member should fail to
give an A to a student who deserves
it. We are asking faculty to enter into
a social contract to bring grade infla
tion back under control, back to the
way we graded at Princeton in the
late eighties and early nineties."
Malkiel also addressed a con
cern among students that small de
partments will be aversely affected
by the proposals because they do
not have the large introductory
classes that Malkiel has said will
undergo the most significant reduc
tion in grades.
Instead, Malkiel said every small
department except one had large
enough introductory classes to offset
the impact of the proposals on
upper-level seminars.
Faculty opinion on the proposals
was mixed. Some faculty members

heralded the proposals as a sign of
Princeton's leadership within the Ivy
League while others expressed con
cern with the potential negative im
pacts on both faculty and students.
"It seems to me that if this pro
posal passes, I will no longer he on an
honor system when grading," Eng
lish professor Esther Schor said. "In
stead, I will be expected to conform
to a one-size-fits-all grading policy,
and with this policy what is to pre
vent a department chair from hold
ing things like teaching assignments
over a junior faculty's head to get
them to comply? This is a liability to
junior faculty."
Other professors argued that the
proposals would provide greater
guidance to junior faculty as well as
help students stand out from their
peers at other universities when ap
plying to jobs and graduate school.
After presentations and debate,
David Botstein, director of the
Lewis Sigler Institute for Integrative
Genomics, motioned to end the de
bate and vote. John Fleming of the
English department then proposed a
closed ballot vote.
Christopher Eisgruber, who will
take over as provost next fall, argued
against a closed ballot, saying secre
cy would violate a tradition of open
ness in faculty voting.

The faculty voted in support of
the open ballot.
Despite broad support for the pro
posals, some faculty members felt
that debate had been cut off too soon
and that not enough consideration
had been given to a closed ballot vote.
"I was gratified by the richness of
the faculty discussion and dismayed
at the abrupt calling fora vote,
when the issue was just coming
clearly into focus," said Caryl
Emerson, chair of the Slavic lan
guages and literatures department.
A committee will also be formed
over the next few months to collect
data on grading within each depart
ment and examine the results of the
proposals every fall, with a major re
view scheduled at the end of a three
year phase-in period.
The committee will take into ac
count special circumstances that
may prevent departments from com
plying with the plan's provisions and
then fine-tune implementation ac
cordingly, Malkiel said.
USG President Matt Margolin, a
junior, said the USG will also work
to monitor the implementation of
the proposals this fall and ensure
that student concerns are addressed.
The focus on grade inflation at
Princeton began in 1998, when the
Committee on Examinations and

Standing first released a report
tracking grading patterns at the Uni
versity from 1973 to 1997.
The report revealed a steady rise
in undergraduate grades and set the
stage for additional reports and pro
posals attempting to stem the tide of
rising grades.
Last spring, the Committee on
Examinations and Standings re
turned to the issue only to find that,
despite its efforts to work with indi
vidual departments, grades had con
tinued to rise.
"We took these findings to the
department chairs last spring and
they told us that we had a collective
action problem," Malkiel said. "The
chairs gave us the specific mandate
to formulate a proposal with uni
form grading standards for the Uni
versity and we on the Committee
worked closely with them to refine
the proposal."
The proposals were released to
the faculty earlier this month.
Malkiel subsequently emailed them
to the student body, a day after re
leasing them to the faculty. Howev
er, the communication had been ear
lier than anticipated, she said, be
cause a faculty member gave the
proposals to a colleague in Boston
who in turn leaked them to the
Boston Globe.
(U-WIRE) PRINCETON, N.J.
In an almost two to one decision,
the Princeton University faculty
voted Monday to approve the anti
grade inflation proposals released
earlier this month by the Committee
on Examinations and Standing. Fac
ulty debated the proposals for about
40 minutes and then approved them,
156 to 84.
"We had a thoughtful and ex
tended discussion today and now
we need to get to work to imple
ment the proposals in the most
thoughtful and sensitive way possi
ble." Nancy Weiss Makiel, dean of
the college and one of the primary
authors of the proposals, said after
the faculty meeting.
The vote is the first step by a se
lective university in recent years to
curb a steady rise in grades — ana

tionwide trend — and is the culmina
tion of more than two weeks of con
tentious campus debate conducted
under national media scrutiny.
The approved proposals set an
"expectation" — rather than a
"limit," as originally proposed — of
35 percent A-range grades among
undergraduate courses in each de
partment and 55 percent A-range
grades in independent work, after an
amendment set out the new lan
guage.
The new guidelines will take ef
fect this fall, though Malkiel noted
that the proposals' provisions
would be phased in over a three
year period.
The faculty room of Nassau Hall
was filled to capacity a little after
4:30 Monday as Malkiel introduced
the proposals. Anticipating a num
ber of faculty concerns, Malkiel said
the proposals were "by and of the
faculty" and would not negatively af

feet academic freedom.
"These proposals do not try to tell
faculty how to teach," Malkiel said.
"No faculty member should fail to
give an A to a student who deserves
it. We are asking faculty to enter into
a social contract to bring grade infla
