# Dean's Award recognizes research
## Undergraduates honored for exceptional work 
### ALIYYA HAQUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Seven undergraduate students
were honored with the Dean's
Award for Academic Accomplish
ment at a reception on April 15. The
honorees were recognized for their
research efforts in a variety of fields
ranging from chemistry to the bio
logical sciences.
Faculty and Stanford staff
members who worked with the
students nominated the award re
cipients, with the finalists chosen
by a selection committee, repre
senting the School of Earth Sci
ences, the School of Engineering
and the School of Humanities
and Science.
In a recent press release. Linguis
tics and Philosophy Prof. Tom
Wasow, who created the Dean's
Award in 1988, explained the
award's importance.
"Students receive recognition
at Stanford for so many of their
accomplishments in areas such as
athletics and service, but, except
for Commencement awards, most
academic achievements are a pri
vate matter," Wasow said. "We
created this award to celebrate
some of the exceptional scholarly
achievements of our undergradu
ate students and to bring them cam
pus-wide recognition."
Senior James Van Deventer
was honored for his work in chem
ical engineering, specifically his
application of organic chemistry to
semiconductor surfaces with pos
sible applications in molecular
electronics, nanoscale lithography
and biosensors. Van Deventer
worked on a project to investigate
how acetic acid reacts with a spe
cific crystal face of germanium in
order to explore the idea that at
taching molecules to surfaces of

semiconductor chips may give
them new capabilities.
Having begun his foray into
undergraduate research as a
sophomore. Van Deventer came
across Chemical Engineering
Assoc. Prof. Stacey Bent's research
and soon started work in her lab
through participation in Summer
Research College.
"Getting involved with research
was pretty simple," Van Deventer
said. "When I started performing
research, 1 had to learn a lot before I
could understand precisely what
Stacey's research was all about, so I
spent a lot of time reading papers
and asking questions."
Through his participation in
Bent's lab. Van Deventer said he
also gained invaluable public speak
ing skills, as he was expected to give
talks and field questions at group
meetings in front of the entire
Bent Research Group. In fact, this
experience prepared him to give a
presentation at the AVS Science

and Technology's 50th Interna
tional Symposium on his work
with acetic acid.
Senior Nathalie De Leon was
honored as well for her work in
chemistry, having worked closely
with Chemistry Prof. Richard Zare.
Her research project focused on de
tection schemes for polycyclic aro
matic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in me
teorites, earth samples, volcanic
water and other substrates. PAHs
are also considered by the Environ
mental Protection Agency to be pri
ority pollutants.
De Leon first became involved
in undergraduate research work
ing in a biology lab as a freshman.
She joined Zare's lab at the begin
ning of her sophomore year after
having taken his Sophomore Col
lege class.
"It was fairly easy to find re
search positions," said De Leon. "I
find that the faculty here in general

is very willing to accept undergrads
in their labs."
Coterminal student Vinita
Kailasanath won the Dean's
Award for her work in the biolog
ical sciences, specifically for her
discovery of three estrogen re
ceptors in one species. Through
her research, she had explored

the understanding of the influ
ence of estrogen on brain and be
havior with implications about
the process of gene duplication
during evolution.
Like De Leon. Kailasanath first
met her mentor, Psychology and
Human Biology Prof. Russell Fer
nald, through Sophomore College
and has been working in his lab for
the past two years. In the lab,
Kailasanath has been able to inter
act with people in various stages of
their educational careers.

"Research has given me the op
portunity to follow through on
a project for an extended period
of time and actually create knowl
edge, which is a wonderful experi
ence," Kailasanath said. "The lab
is a great community to be a
part of."
Other recipients of the Dean's
Award include junior Anna Cueni
for research in linguistics, cotermi
nal student Meredith Lee for her
work in electrical engineering,
sophomore Jason Ross for re

search in the biological sciences
and junior Yue Yang for his work
also in the biological sciences and
electrophysiology.
According to De Leon, research
has been the most important part of
her undergraduate education.
"Although I've had interesting
and fun classes in the sciences, they
generally don't give you a good
picture of what science really
is," De Leon said. "That is some
thing that I could only gain from
doing research."
