As the weeks draw closer and closer to summer,
Stanford students have been scrambling to find sum
mer jobs and internships. Lance Choy, director of the
Career Development Center (CDC), said that the
CDC is prepared, offering students some sanity in the
search process.
Choy explained that the services offered range from
available career counselors, to a resource library, ref
erence file service and various job listings, to panels
and speakers.
"[Career counselors] assist students with a variety
of career development issues, from 'I don't know what
1 want to do' to 'I need some advice on how to look for
a job or internship,' " Choy said.
"The library on the second floor is excellent," said
senior Kuldip K. Ambastha.

Choy also explained that most deadlines for sum
mer internships passed in January, although listings
have increased since then and will be continuing
through June. Students interested in a summer intern
ship should keep in mind that the CDC receives in
ternship listings throughout the summer.
"It's never too late to look for internships, but the
earlier you start, the easier it is," Choy said.
Other options for students still searching are to
make an appointment with a career counselor or to
visit the Web site. Since the job search process takes
such a long time, students are encouraged to come to the
CDC for help with resumes and to learn about inter
viewing.
Ambastha described his experience with the CDC
as being very helpful with feedback in the initial stages
of his job search.
