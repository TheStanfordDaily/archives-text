## Get a Job 
### MARISA C. JUAREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the weeks draw closer and closer to summer,
Stanford students have been scrambling to find sum
mer jobs and internships. Lance Choy, director of the
Career Development Center (CDC), said that the
CDC is prepared, offering students some sanity in the
search process.
Choy explained that the services offered range from
available career counselors, to a resource library, ref
erence file service and various job listings, to panels
and speakers.
"[Career counselors] assist students with a variety
of career development issues, from 'I don't know what
1 want to do' to 'I need some advice on how to look for
a job or internship,' " Choy said.
"The library on the second floor is excellent," said
senior Kuldip K. Ambastha.

Choy also explained that most deadlines for sum
mer internships passed in January, although listings
have increased since then and will be continuing
through June. Students interested in a summer intern
ship should keep in mind that the CDC receives in
ternship listings throughout the summer.
"It's never too late to look for internships, but the
earlier you start, the easier it is," Choy said.
Other options for students still searching are to
make an appointment with a career counselor or to
visit the Web site. Since the job search process takes
such a long time, students are encouraged to come to the
CDC for help with resumes and to learn about inter
viewing.
Ambastha described his experience with the CDC
as being very helpful with feedback in the initial stages
of his job search.

The CDC library offers a multitude of resources for students searching fora summer job, such as a library, a ref
erence file service and the advice of career counselors.
"They definitely helped me out
with my resume and cover letter"
Ambastha said.
Junior Karen Law used the
CDC's Cardinal Recruiting as a part
of her job search.
"I'm a big fan of Cardinal Re
cruiting," Law said. "It allowed me
to go to companies I wouldn't other
wise be able to interview with,
places that are out of state."
Choy also commented on the
changes the CDC is using to im
prove its services, beginning with
the Internet and e-mail.
"There is so much activity at
Stanford that it is hard for students
to keep informed about events relat
ed to their career interests," Choy
said. "Part of our efforts is to make
sure that students stay in the know."
According to Choy, the CDC's
mission is to keep all students "in
the know," regardless of their
major. Despite the common per
ception that the CDC only helps
students interested in engineering

or investment banking. Choy said
the center is prepared to help all
students achieve the task of learn
ing how to effectively conduct a
job search.
"Most employers do not recruit
on college campuses," said Choy,
"Employers want to see who will
take the time to prepare, to re
search. to tailor their resume to
them. It's a screening process."
Bruce Henry, a senior at Brown
University, said that most students do
not use their Career Services Center.
"1 know it exists, but I've never felt
the need to go there because 1 don't
feel welcome there," Henry said.
Nelly Sanchez, a junior at Brown,
described her experience at Career
Services as basically consisting of an
Internet search.
"They just look at Web sites,"
said Sanchez, "They're not in touch
with the community's needs."
While some Stanford students
are also using Internet resources
such as Monster.com and
Incircle.stanfordalumni.org, the
CDC has continued to play a key
role in many students'job searches.
"[The CDC] is very organized,"
Law said. "It makes me feel on top
of things."
