# U. of Wisconsin TA's to hold strike
## 
### KEITH ZUKAS THE DAILY CARDINAL 
(U-WIRE) MADISON. Wis.—
The University of Wisconsin Teach
ing Assistants' Association voted
Monday to hold a campus-wide
walkout strike Tuesday and
Wednesday after rejecting final con
tract proposals from the State Bar
gaining Committee.
Over 500 TAs and project assis
tants packed the Lowell Center to
voice their opinions about the
State Bargaining Committee's
refusal of two contract proposals
from the TAA. The two separate
offers would have either raised TA
and PA wages or retained their
current zero-premium health-care
plans. Instead, the state returned

with a counter proposal, which
was similar to previous offers, ac
cording to Danielle LeClair.
the chief negotiator of the TAA
Bargaining Committee.
"There wasn't any movement in
the counterproposal offered by the
state. They shifted percentages and
numbers around, but in the end
more TAs would be losing out."
LeClair said.
TAA members signed up for
shifts to picket in front of several
buildings around campus starting at
7:30 a.m. Tuesday. The buildings in
clude Bascom Hall, Humanities.
Vilas Hall. Van Vteck. Van Hise.
Education. Educational Sciences,
Noland. Social Science and Helen C.
White. They will not picket Memori
al and College libraries.

"We're asking students not to
cross picket lines wherever they see
them," Strike Committee Chair
Ellen Heckman said.
Additionally, the Student Labor
Action Coalition will sponsor a
rally in support of the TAA Tues
day at noon on Bascom Hill and the
TAA will hold another post-strike
celebration at 4:30 in front of Bas
com Hall. The TAA has also
planned a post-strike march to the
Capitol Wednesday.
University of Wisconsin-Madison
Provost Peter Spear said students
should attend class and continue
their week as usual.
Despite the strike, the TAA will
attempt to bring the State Bargain
ing Committee back to the negotiat
ing table this week, according to

Heckman. However, the TAA
Strike Committee is prepared to
continue with a grade strike at the
end of the semester that would in
clude withholding final grades from
students and administrators.
"A grade strike is on the hori
zon," Heckman said.
In response to the TAA action, 22
academic departments have passed
formal resolutions in support of the
TAA and many professors have can
celled or rescheduled classes.
"I rescheduled classes because 1
wanted to give students an alterna
tive to crossing a picket line," Uni
versity of Wisconsin-Madison polit
ical science Professor Steve Stern
said. "I'm telling students I'm not
going to penalize them for having
a conscience."
