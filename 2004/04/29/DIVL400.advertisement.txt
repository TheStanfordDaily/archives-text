Man Boob vs. Woman Boob
The debate rages 0n...
I don't think people out there are giving enough credit to the
possibility that this flap of flesh may actually belong to a woman.
Look at its supple nature, its delicacy. The tenderness of the breast
really jumps off the page. And I submit that no man may boast a
bosom meriting such gentle descriptions.
Furthermore, how can you not take the size of the areolae into
account? Have you ever played the quarter game? This person
would win the half-dollar game, if anyone ever dared to conceive of
such a contest. That other guy doesn't even have a dime on him.
As for the waft of chestal hair and the fact that the woman is
topless in public...it's a new millennium, man.
