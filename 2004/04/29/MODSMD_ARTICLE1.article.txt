# Despite security concerns, abroad enrollment is up

### EUGENIE KIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite recent political events that have con
tributed to global instability and anti-American sen
timent abroad, many students feel a strong and even
renewed commitment to studying abroad, said direc
tors of the University's Overseas Studies Program (OSP).
According to OSP Associate Director Irene
Kennedy, the number of students enrolled in the pro
gram has risen in the past few years.
"Anecdotal evidence from students suggests that
they are increasingly drawn to an overseas experi
ence because they want to better understand how the
United States is perceived by other countries,"
she said.
Senior Erinn Evans, head student advisor at OSP,
said that she did not feel threatened by the increased
awareness of terrorism during her stay in Florence
last spring.
"It is assumptions that are dangerous and lead to
misunderstandings, both on our part and on the part
of members of the host country." she said. "Studying
and living abroad make you realize things that in your
own world in the United States may never cross
your mind."
Yet along with this growth in student interest in
studying abroad comes the need for greater aware
ness of the global political situation.
"At orientation we talk with students about shar
ing their political and social views in foreign coun
tries, suggesting that overt Americanism may not be
well-received in some venues," Kennedy said.
Students may find themselves faced with unobtru
sive daily reminders about security issues overseas.
For example, all garbage cans in the Paris metro have
now been sealed off as a precaution against people
leaving suspicious packages in them.
OSP directors try to take such issues into account
when facilitating students' transition to a new coun
try, according to Ermelinda Campani, the director of
the Stanford's Florence campus. The orientation in
Florence consists of a talk given by an Italian police
inspector, who alerts students to potential crimes in
the area, as well as a visit from the U.S. Consul, who
discusses safety from a broader, more internation
al perspective.
"While safety tips have always been given to stu
dents in the past, we have been devoting more atten
tion to them in the last three years," Campani said. "I
receive on a regular basis the Warden messages as
well as the public announcements issued by the U.S.
Department of State and the Department of Home
land Security. We also have an emergency phone tree."
Some students who studied abroad found that, de
spite the perceived political volatility of a particular
country, they still wanted to have the experience. Ju
nior Mattie Hutton found herself in that situation
when she decided to go to Bilbao, the capital of the
Basque Country in Spain, during the fall quarter of
this year.
Basque Country is generally known for its con
nection to the terrorist group ETA, which comprises
a small percentage of the Basque population, and
Hutton was advised against going to the region by the
University's Spanish Department. However, she
decided to go to the country through a program run
by the University of Duesto.
"I actually felt safer in Bilbao than I do in most
American cities," she said. "The Spanish culture and
schedule put more people and families outside and
on the street at any time of the day — there are few
opportunities to be in an abandoned area."
Junior Juliet Frerking, a stu
dent advisor of the Stanford Pro
gram in Moscow, had to deal with
a vastly different political and so
cial environment when she went
abroad last spring. Although she
has lived in large cities and trav
eled to 38 different countries, she
cited Moscow as being among the
less safe environments that she
has experienced.
"It was more of a feeling of having
a little less faith and feeling a little less
secure, rather than a particular inci
dent," she said.
Moscow's lack of an official taxi
system led travelers to hail and pay

any passing car for transportation.
"I had to think a little more and be
more careful than when I was in
America," Frerking said. "That being
said, anywhere can be unsafe. Stan
ford can be unsafe."
Frerking also acknowledged that
her occasional discomfort in Moscow
might have been due in part to culture
shock and the fear of difficult negotia
tions in a foreign language.
While there have been inci
dents in which individuals found
themselves in unsafe situations,
there has never been a case where
an entire group of students or a
program center was threatened.
Kennedy said.
"There seems to be a growing
awareness among students that
they will have a role to play in a
more volatile global environment,"
she added.

ing their political and social views in foreign coun
tries, suggesting that overt Americanism may not be
well-received in some venues," Kennedy said.
Students may find themselves faced with unobtru
sive daily reminders about security issues overseas.
For example, all garbage cans in the Paris metro have
now been sealed off as a precaution against people
leaving suspicious packages in them.
OSP directors try to take such issues into account
when facilitating students' transition to a new coun
try, according to Ermelinda Campani, the director of
the Stanford's Florence campus. The orientation in
Florence consists of a talk given by an Italian police
inspector, who alerts students to potential crimes in
the area, as well as a visit from the U.S. Consul, who
discusses safety from a broader, more internation
al perspective.
"While safety tips have always been given to stu
dents in the past, we have been devoting more atten
tion to them in the last three years," Campani said. "I
receive on a regular basis the Warden messages as
well as the public announcements issued by the U.S.
Department of State and the Department of Home
land Security. We also have an emergency phone tree."
Some students who studied abroad found that, de
spite the perceived political volatility of a particular
country, they still wanted to have the experience. Ju
nior Mattie Hutton found herself in that situation
when she decided to go to Bilbao, the capital of the
Basque Country in Spain, during the fall quarter of
this year.
Basque Country is generally known for its con
nection to the terrorist group ETA, which comprises
a small percentage of the Basque population, and
Hutton was advised against going to the region by the
University's Spanish Department. However, she
decided to go to the country through a program run
by the University of Duesto.
"I actually felt safer in Bilbao than I do in most
American cities," she said. "The Spanish culture and
schedule put more people and families outside and
on the street at any time of the day — there are few
opportunities to be in an abandoned area."
Junior Juliet Frerking, a stu
dent advisor of the Stanford Pro
gram in Moscow, had to deal with
a vastly different political and so
cial environment when she went
abroad last spring. Although she
has lived in large cities and trav
eled to 38 different countries, she
cited Moscow as being among the
less safe environments that she
has experienced.
"It was more of a feeling of having
a little less faith and feeling a little less
secure, rather than a particular inci
dent," she said.
Moscow's lack of an official taxi
system led travelers to hail and pay

any passing car for transportation.
"I had to think a little more and be
more careful than when I was in
America," Frerking said. "That being
said, anywhere can be unsafe. Stan
ford can be unsafe."
Frerking also acknowledged that
her occasional discomfort in Moscow
might have been due in part to culture
shock and the fear of difficult negotia
tions in a foreign language.
While there have been inci
dents in which individuals found
themselves in unsafe situations,
there has never been a case where
an entire group of students or a
program center was threatened.
Kennedy said.
"There seems to be a growing
awareness among students that
they will have a role to play in a
more volatile global environment,"
she added.
