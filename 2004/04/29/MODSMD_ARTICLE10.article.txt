# Lecture series showcases possibilities of fusing engineering and art
## 
### ANNY LIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Professionals ranging from wheel
chair designers to sex-toy retailers are
being brought to campus by a lecture
series hosted by the Joint Program in
Product Design. The David H. Liu
Memorial Lecture Series in Design,
"Rulebreakers of the 21st Century," is
held Thursday evenings at the
Clark Center.
According to series coordinator
Adam French, the lecture series aims
to give students a "vision" of how to
pursue their passions by showcasing
people from various professions who
have redefined design. To French,

rulebreakers are those who have re
jected traditional paths to success and
instead followed their passions.
This year's series was kicked off
on April 8 by Martin Fisher who
took an active approach toward fus
ing his interests in engineering and
philanthropy. In 1985, Fisher trav
eled to Kenya on a Fulbright schol
arship where he was struck by the
poverty level and was inspired to
found ApproTEC-USA. Appro-
TEC-USA, which stands for Ap
propriate Technologies for Enter
prise Creation, works to bring low
cost technologies to developing
countries in Africa, helping them
fight poverty.

"Fisher is the type of person who
was willing to put himself through fi
nancial and personal strains for other
people because he believed in what he
was doing," said James Monsees, a
graduate student in the design
program.
French emphasized the fact that
designers are always under the pres
sure to innovate, which entails chal
lenging the status quo at some times
and conforming at others.
"I think that we can all learn from
the way each speaker has addressed
their chosen field," French said. "If we
think of our life's work as a game with
rules, consequences and rewards, each
of our speakers has redefined the

game they chose to play, and in doing
so redefined what it means to be suc
cessful."
In order to choose the speakers,
French met with a variety of students
to talk about what is currently impor
tant in design and to find people who
exemplify those traits.
"The speakers come and talk
about their work and what motivates
them." French said. "We encourage
speakers to take the topic personally."
While the lectures are organized by
the Joint Program in Product Design,
the intended audience is the commu
nity at large since the speakers do not
explicitly discuss technical issues
of design.

"The best thing I've gotten out
of these lectures is inspiration,"
Monsees said. "It's very interesting
to see how these people got to
where they are."
The lecture series is supported by a
memorial fund started in 1996 by the
parents of David H. Liu. Liu was a me
chanical engineering graduate student
in the project-design program when
he was shot and killed outside his Palo
Alto apartment building during a rob
bery in late 1994.
The Joint Program in Product De
sign brings the mechanical engineer
ing and art departments together to
create products that are both practi
cal and aesthetically pleasing. French

noted that students in the program
take classes in both departments and
graduate with a Master of Fine Arts
or Master of Science, depending on
their focus.
The next lecture, held in a week on
Thursday, May 6, will feature Ralf
Hotchkiss, a designer of low-cost
wheelchairs. Hotchkiss has estab
lished a network of wheelchair
builders in developing countries.
The final two lecturers will be
Joani Blank, founder of Good Vi
brations, a mail-order and retail
store for sex toys; and a speaker
from Survival Research Laborato
ries, which develops robots for prac
tical and military use.
