## Help keep the election clean

It's time for another ASSU election campaign,
and we can only hope that it goes better than the
last one. In the absence of a new set of rules, it is
up to the entire Stanford community to scrupu
lously obey the letter and spirit of the current Cam
paign Practice Code in order to ensure that this elec
tion proceeds smoothly.
Certainly the potential exists fora repeat of the de
bacle that took place two weeks ago. The ASSU elec
tions commissioners have said that they will not hesi
tate to disqualify slates for violations. That should
send a clear enough message to the candidates that
they cannot bend the rules with impunity. But what if
another scenario arises in which it is difficult to deter
mine who was at fault?
One might think that everyone has learned the les

line will only lead to trouble. But this is a question

slate, it will be up to the elections commissioners to
quickly determine whether the candidates had any
thing to do with it.
Such an occurrence would be confusing, to say the
least. We hope the commissioners will not immedi
ately assume that the candidates are to blame. This
would make it possible for someone to frame the can
didates by committing violations on their behalf.
The bottom line is that as long as there are hard
and-fast rules restricting free campaign speech, it will
be difficult for ASSU officials to ensure a clean and
untainted election. For now, we urge all Stanford stu
dents to educate themselves on the basic tenets of the
Campaign Practice Code, and when in doubt, to err
on the side of caution. Only in this way can more
scandal and litigiousness by avoided.
As for the candidates, it should be obvious by now
that it is not in their interest to try to exploit loopholes
or circumvent the rules. In the current climate of
ASSU executive elections, perhaps the biggest state
ment any slate can make is to run a serious campaign
while upholding high standards of behavior and obey
ing all the rules.
