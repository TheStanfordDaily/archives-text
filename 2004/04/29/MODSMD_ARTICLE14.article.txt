# THE 						BROOKLYN BRAT
## Spring fashion: hot and not 
### 
Just in case you have been in
side a climate-controlled room
all week, let me remind you
that it is hot — very hot. The
weathermen are calling it a "heat
wave," but being from the notorious
ly hot, hazy and humid East Coast, to
me this is simply springtime.
According to the Registrar's of
fice, it has been spring for over a
month, and we have all been follow
ing along by taking fewer units, par
tying on Monday nights and wearing
sunglasses during class. But the truth
remains that it's never really spring
until the temperature rises above 80
degrees and people start unpacking
their skimpy clothing.
All of a sudden Uggs are being re
placed by flip-flops as the favored
footwear to accompany a mini-skirt,
and as it gets too hot for headgear, it
looks like the same Von Dutch hat
that everyone owns is finally going to
get a break. Equally nice, now that
it's hot as a crotch outside, there will
be no more skinny scarves, faux fur
or leg warmers.
I like to think of spring as more of
a time for bright colors, spaghetti
straps and cute pink t-shirts that say
"Make Me Blush," or my personal
favorite, "I Kissed Justin!" Up and
down Escondido Road girls on bikes
are flashing each other as they try to
figure out how to ride in a skirt or a
dress. And it seems as if this week

has marked the return of the classic
Stanford "butt shorts."
Taking advantage of spring fash
ion is not just a female thing. As much
as guys try to deny their own involve
ment, I see more Hawaiian shirts in
my 11 a.m. lecture than I did in

an entire week
in Hawaii. While
guys are probably
not the first ones
in line at the mall
over spring break,
they all get bitten
by the fashion bug
at some point,
even if it's just by
buying a new set of

wife beaters from Target.
Apparently spring makes no dif
ference in the lives of our professors,
who still walk around in long sleeves,
blazers and the occasional pair of
corduroys even when their students
show up half-naked to class. Maybe
it's to keep warm in their air-condi
tioned offices, but my guess is that as
the quarter progresses even our
emeritus professors will be donning
short sleeves and sock-less loafers.
But like all things in life, spring
fashion has an ugly side, which looks
something like the girl who took a
shortcut through Meyer Library this
morning wearing five-inch platform
sandals, a pleated mini-skirt too
short for even Britney Spears's taste

and a tank top just thin enough to
show off her bikini top.
Surely she was not headed to the
beach, because the last time I
checked the guidebook, there aren't
any within walking distance. Like so
many other girls on campus, she was
probably headed out to a patch of
green to sit and tan in the sun. And
while there is nothing wrong with
wanting a post-spring-break, pre
summer tanning opportunity,
Wilbur Field is not Cancun or Key
West, so the thong bikinis should re
ally stay neatly tucked away in our
drawers along with whatever we are
planning to wear to Exotic Erotic
this year.
Before anyone goes out and
burns their skimpiest spring cloth
ing, I must say that I am not advocat
ing for big brother Hoover to man
date a dress code or law of decency.
And even though 1 personally don't
like to see anyone's panties on my
way to class every morning, when it
comes to getting dressed, it is still
safe to assume that anything goes.
Besides, maybe all of this extra
exposed skin will usher in the return
of our good friend the groper.
