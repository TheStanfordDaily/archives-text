## Miami DJs get Castro-ated 
### 
I think it's fair to say that Fidel
Castro is no friend of the
United States government. I
don't mean that when the US
government goes out to play a
round of golf with other world
powers, Cuba doesn't get a call. I
mean that since Castro took
power in 1959, the CIA has tried
to kill him approximately eleven
ty-billion times.
Now, agree or disagree, I can
understand that every once in a
while covert organizations might
decide that "removing" a leader
from power is the best way to ac
complish certain strategic objec
tives. I am pretty sure, however,
that if the CIA poisons your milk
shakes, laces your cigars with bo
tulism and even considers deco
rating your favorite scuba spots
with exploding conch shells,
they're probably pretty pissed off
at you.
Hell, the CIA Inspector Gener
al's "Report on Plots to Assassi
nate Castro" even details a
scheme to put a powder in his
shoes that would make his beard
fall off. That's personal.
Given this less-than-congenial
relationship between our govern
ment and Castro, I feel pretty con
fident that if I, say, snuck into
Cuba and gave Castro a pantsing,
I wouldn't exactly be number one
on the U.S. Most Wanted List. I'm
sure a similar sentiment was run
ning through the minds of Miami
disc jockeys Enrique Santos and
Joe Ferrera last June, when they
prank-called President Castro on
their daily morning show "El Vac

ilon de la Manana" ("The Morn
ing Joker").
The two WXDJ personalities
managed to convince the Cuban
foreign relations ministry that
they were aides to President
Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, and
that Chavez had forgotten a suit
case filled with confidential docu
ments on his last visit.
Apparently, the duo was rather
convincing, and eventually, they
got Castro on the line. The two
were able to fool the president
himself, and got him to agree to
track down the suitcase. However,
instead of the "gracias" Castro
doubtlessly expected, he was
greeted with charges of being a
murderer and then informed that
he was on the air in Miami. Castro,
surprisingly, was not amused, and
let loose a string of expletives that
would make George Carlin blush.
Now, at this point, I'm sure the
two deejays were pretty happy
with themselves. Sure, Cuba prob
ably got scratched off their future
travel calendars, but the call was a
huge hit. I have to say, anytime
you can get a world-famous dicta
tor to pop off like a drunken frat
boy, you have to mark that down
as a success.
I'm certain that they didn't ex
pect the federal government —
the same federal government that
laced Fidel's scuba suit with a fun
gal toxin and put botulism in his
air regulator —to have a beef.
Given this, I bet they were more
than a little surprised last week to
learn that the FCC had levied a
$4,000 fine for their little stunt.

OK, in the grand scheme of
things, $4,000 dollars is a slap on
the wrist. Nevertheless, I think it's
pretty fair to say that on the
ridiculousness scale, this ruling
probably falls somewhere be
tween baboons on tricycles and
underwater turnip racing.
I would have loved to be in the
room with the geniuses who made
this call. "Prank calling the sworn
enemy of our nation? Outrageous.
Poisoning his cigars is one thing —
fake phone calls is quite another.
If we let this pass, what then?
Whoopee cushions in Saddam's
bed at Guantanamo? Tricking
Kim 11-Jong into pulling the fin
ger? This is the kind of slippery
slope we just can't allow."
On one level, though, I suppose
I understand the government's
sentiment. Harassing innocent
dictators isn't the kind of thing
that we, as a country, should stand
for.
If private citizens like Mr. San
tos and Mr. Ferrera are allowed to
assume responsibility for such im
portant activities, what will be left
for our highly trained government
operatives?
Real-world intelligence gather
ing? Pshaw. I'll take exploding
conch shells any day. Those are re
sults you can see.
