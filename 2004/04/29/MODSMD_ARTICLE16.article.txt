## Hooking up? Just tell it like it is 
### CHRIS WILLIAMS 
Maybe it's just a California thing, hut
until I came to Stanford, 1 had only been ac
quainted with the phrase "hooking up" from
various sundry MTV dating shows.
Episodes of "The Real World" boggled
the mind as the cast talked in private confes
sions about somebody "hooking up" with
somebody else in the hot tub. Yet through all
of this. I was still clueless as to what they ac
tually did. Did she give him a kiss on the
cheek? The neck? Lower?
To this day. I still don't know. The con
cept is a vague one at best. It seems here on
campus — and perhaps the West Coast in
general — that the term "hooking up" can

have wide-ranging connotations.
Acts can vary from just a peck on the
cheek to the real nitty-gritty between two
people. Maybe it's just the Texas in me. but
where I come from, things are kept simple.
When someone asks you what you did
with a particular person after / during / be
fore a party, if you feel so inclined, you tell
them. The amorphous phrase "hooking
up" is discarded altogether. It is replaced
with much more concrete and tangible ter
minology, such as "making out," "oral cop
ulation," etc.
The South in general tends to be a blunter
place when it comes to these types of mat
ters. Maybe it's the heat... the gin ... I
couldn't guess. But I would implore mem

bers of the Stanford community to make
their lives a lot simpler by adopting this clar
ity of speech.
No, you don't have to come out saying
"y'all" — although this also would make
speech simpler by removing the clumsy
'you all' phrase — or employ a deep south
ern drawl in daily conversation. Just say
things as they are and forego all the need
less doubletalk.
Some may be hesitant to take any ad
vice on NoCal / SoCal from this interlop
er. and I do understand. I know most peo
ple don't care for Texans. Perhaps jeal
ousy plays a part — yes, everything is
bigger in Texas, as I am a proud example
— but the advice should still be taken at

face value.
But I know the phrase hasn't just materi
alized out of nowhere.
There will always still be that one, pitiable
person who, after a night of frequenting way
to many Row parties, will relate to his
friends that he "hooked up" with multiple
members of the opposite sex — when in re
ality his "hooking up" only entailed copping
a feel on some girls passed out in the lounge
of SAE.
