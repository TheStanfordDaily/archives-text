Harvard follows in Stanford's footsteps
I am currently a graduate student at
Harvard University, so I read with interest
that Harvard is in the process of revamp
ing its undergraduate program. The plans
are to include a strong overseas studies
program, a flexible core curriculum, the
integration of new teaching technologies
and programs to stimulate a general inter
est in science.
This sounds curiously like the formula
that made me choose Stanford over Har
vard in 1984! It's nice to see that Harvard is
catching up to the Farm after 20 years.
