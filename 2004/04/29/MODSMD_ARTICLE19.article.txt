# Special focus on ... Women's Health politics, health concerns, controversies surrounding . . . abortion

### STELLA ASLIBEKYAN 
Last Sunday, abortion-rights activists from many
states and countries joined forces in an unprecedented
effort to protest the family planning policies of the
Bush administration. The March for Women's Lives is
estimated to have drawn over a million participants —
among them prominent public figures like New York
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Whoopi Goldberg
and Gloria Steinem. Coming just in time for the pres
idential election season, the march brought abortion,
one of the most divisive and controversial issues of our
time, to the forefront of the American political agen
da. Many people from Stanford attended the march,
some affiliated with Stanford Students for Choice and
some who were associated with other groups.
Unfortunately, the political and moral contention
surrounding abortion often pushes aside the most per
sonal and in some ways the most important aspect of the
debate: the health and well being of women.
We live in a world where girls and women often do
not have a choice of whether, with whom and under
what circumstances they have sex. Unwanted inter
course, combined with the lack of reliable contraceptive
information and services, often brings unwanted conse
quences: sexually transmitted diseases, psychological

trauma and unintended
pregnancy. According
to the Alan Guttmach
er Institute, the current
worldwide rate of abor
tions stands at 35 abor
tions per 1,000 women
ages 15 to 44. Given this
rate, over the course of
30 years, over 1,050
abortions will occur per
1,000 women, implying
a lifetime average of
about one abortion per
woman.
Many people would
be either shocked, ap
palled or saddened by
such statistics. Yet first
and foremost, abortion is

a critical health issue — both nationally and internationally.
As with any surgical procedure, there are health risks
inherent to abortion.
"This is a serious surgery, and a lot of things can go
wrong, resulting in bleeding, infections and even infer
tility," explained junior Natalie Lozano, president of
Stanford Students for Life, a pro-life group.
Over the past three decades, however, the ad
vancements in medical technology and increasing
concern for women's safety have transformed abor
tion into a relatively low-risk clinical procedure. An
uncomplicated surgical abortion usually lasts less
than 20 minutes and does not require overnight stay
in a hospital or clinic. Today, abortion is 11 times
safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and nearly
twice as safe as a penicillin injection.
On the other hand, clandestine abortions, common
in countries where the procedure is illegal, continue to
pose a grave threat to women's lives all over the world.
While many Stanford students think of back-alley abor
tions as an issue that exists only in movies like "Dirty
Dancing" or "Cider House Rules," 20 million women in
the developing world undergo unsafe abortions each
year. Often performed by unskilled and ill-equipped
medical personnel, unsafe abortions frequently lead to
sepsis, bleeding, infertility and maternal death. Compli

cations from unsafe abortion cause nearly 70,000 mater
nal deaths every year, accounting for 13 percent of the
global burden of maternal mortality.
Senior Rebecca Allen is convinced that the only way
to eradicate the danger of underground abortions is to
legalize the procedure.
"Women will have abortions, women will want abor
tions, and this fact will not go away as long as birth con
trol is imperfect," Allen said. "Adoption will never be
easy — physically or psychologically — and pregnancy
for nine months prior to adoption will never be as real
istic an option for most women as it may sound. There
fore, the humane and moral decision for any society is to
make abortion legal. If you truly value life, don't pro
hibit abortion — otherwise, many women will lose their
health and lives."
The tragic example of Romania illustrates the dan
gers of outlawing abortion: During the twenty years fol
lowing the ban on abortions, the country experienced a
600 percent increase in the number of women dying
from covert procedures. In the United States, the leg
islative impact has proven to be equally dramatic — the
number of abortion-related deaths plummeted by 85
percent after the landmark Supreme Court decision on
Roe v. Wade in 1973.
Although legalization of abortion may seem like a
black-and-white issue, lawmakers regulate abortion
through a number of different approaches. Only two
legal systems in the world — Chile and El Salvador —
unconditionally prohibit abortion and very few coun
tries leave the choice completely up to the woman.
Many countries, including the United States, hold the
middle ground. Some impose limits on late-term abor
tions; other countries, where abortion is not legal, grant
exemption to victims of rape or incest or to women
whose lives are endangered by a pregnancy.
The recent controversy over the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act of 2003 is one example of the issues that may arise
even in a system with well-established abortion legisla
tion. Although "partial birth abortion" is not a formal
medical term, the 2003 act defines it as the delivery of a
fetus "until, in the case of a headfirst presentation, the en
tire fetal head is outside the body of the mother... for the
purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows
will kill the partially delivered living fetus."
Two earlier versions of this law were vetoed by Pres

ident Clinton because they failed to include exceptions
to protect the life and health of the woman. The sup
porters of the current act bypassed the issue by present
ing research findings that claim that the procedure is
never necessary to protect the health of the woman.
"Situations when the choice has to be made between
the health of the mother or the child are fairly infre
quent, and even then abortion is not necessarily a
healthier option," said Lozano. "Both entail great risks,
but the morally right choice is to do everything possible
so that both the mother and the child survive the preg
nancy. All humans have dignity and the right to live, re
gardless of their size and age."
A different challenge is presented by the abuse of abor
tion rights for sex selection purposes, commonly practiced
in traditional patriarchal cultures to ensure the birth of a
male heir. While community education and women's em
powerment have proven to be the best long-term solutions
to the problem, some feminist groups in India have pro
posed legal reforms that would prohibit choosing abortion
based solely on the gender of the fetus.
"Abortion rights should not be restricted just because
someone may end up abusing them," Allen said. "This
form of sex selection is undoubtedly problematic, but it is
the lesser of two evils when compared to illegal abortions."
The controversial and sensitive nature of the com
plex issues surrounding abortion makes it an unpopular
conversation topic on campus.
Many Stanford students seem to have found the
compromise by self- identifying as "anti-abortion, yet
pro-choice." This view appeals to those who are often
uncomfortable with the idea of having an abortion
themselves, but believe that abortion should remain
legal, leaving the choice up to the conscience of indi
vidual women.
"I find this a really difficult issue to discuss at Stanford,"
explained Allen. "Even when it does come up. people tend
to get angry and defensive because it's so polarizing. There
is really not much room for compromise."

The tragic example of Romania illustrates the dan
gers of outlawing abortion: During the twenty years fol
lowing the ban on abortions, the country experienced a
600 percent increase in the number of women dying
from covert procedures. In the United States, the leg
islative impact has proven to be equally dramatic — the
number of abortion-related deaths plummeted by 85
percent after the landmark Supreme Court decision on
Roe v. Wade in 1973.
Although legalization of abortion may seem like a
black-and-white issue, lawmakers regulate abortion
through a number of different approaches. Only two
legal systems in the world — Chile and El Salvador —
unconditionally prohibit abortion and very few coun
tries leave the choice completely up to the woman.
Many countries, including the United States, hold the
middle ground. Some impose limits on late-term abor
tions; other countries, where abortion is not legal, grant
exemption to victims of rape or incest or to women
whose lives are endangered by a pregnancy.
The recent controversy over the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act of 2003 is one example of the issues that may arise
even in a system with well-established abortion legisla
tion. Although "partial birth abortion" is not a formal
medical term, the 2003 act defines it as the delivery of a
fetus "until, in the case of a headfirst presentation, the en
tire fetal head is outside the body of the mother... for the
purpose of performing an overt act that the person knows
will kill the partially delivered living fetus."
Two earlier versions of this law were vetoed by Pres

ident Clinton because they failed to include exceptions
to protect the life and health of the woman. The sup
porters of the current act bypassed the issue by present
ing research findings that claim that the procedure is
never necessary to protect the health of the woman.
"Situations when the choice has to be made between
the health of the mother or the child are fairly infre
quent, and even then abortion is not necessarily a
healthier option," said Lozano. "Both entail great risks,
but the morally right choice is to do everything possible
so that both the mother and the child survive the preg
nancy. All humans have dignity and the right to live, re
gardless of their size and age."
A different challenge is presented by the abuse of abor
tion rights for sex selection purposes, commonly practiced
in traditional patriarchal cultures to ensure the birth of a
male heir. While community education and women's em
powerment have proven to be the best long-term solutions
to the problem, some feminist groups in India have pro
posed legal reforms that would prohibit choosing abortion
based solely on the gender of the fetus.
"Abortion rights should not be restricted just because
someone may end up abusing them," Allen said. "This
form of sex selection is undoubtedly problematic, but it is
the lesser of two evils when compared to illegal abortions."
The controversial and sensitive nature of the com
plex issues surrounding abortion makes it an unpopular
conversation topic on campus.
Many Stanford students seem to have found the
compromise by self- identifying as "anti-abortion, yet
pro-choice." This view appeals to those who are often
uncomfortable with the idea of having an abortion
themselves, but believe that abortion should remain
legal, leaving the choice up to the conscience of indi
vidual women.
"I find this a really difficult issue to discuss at Stanford,"
explained Allen. "Even when it does come up. people tend
to get angry and defensive because it's so polarizing. There
is really not much room for compromise."

Last Sunday, abortion-rights activists from many
states and countries joined forces in an unprecedented
effort to protest the family planning policies of the
Bush administration. The March for Women's Lives is
estimated to have drawn over a million participants —
among them prominent public figures like New York
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Whoopi Goldberg
and Gloria Steinem. Coming just in time for the pres
idential election season, the march brought abortion,
one of the most divisive and controversial issues of our
time, to the forefront of the American political agen
da. Many people from Stanford attended the march,
some affiliated with Stanford Students for Choice and
some who were associated with other groups.
Unfortunately, the political and moral contention
surrounding abortion often pushes aside the most per
sonal and in some ways the most important aspect of the
debate: the health and well being of women.
We live in a world where girls and women often do
not have a choice of whether, with whom and under
what circumstances they have sex. Unwanted inter
course, combined with the lack of reliable contraceptive
information and services, often brings unwanted conse
quences: sexually transmitted diseases, psychological

trauma and unintended
pregnancy. According
to the Alan Guttmach
er Institute, the current
worldwide rate of abor
tions stands at 35 abor
tions per 1,000 women
ages 15 to 44. Given this
rate, over the course of
30 years, over 1,050
abortions will occur per
1,000 women, implying
a lifetime average of
about one abortion per
woman.
Many people would
be either shocked, ap
palled or saddened by
such statistics. Yet first
and foremost, abortion is

a critical health issue — both nationally and internationally.
As with any surgical procedure, there are health risks
inherent to abortion.
"This is a serious surgery, and a lot of things can go
wrong, resulting in bleeding, infections and even infer
tility," explained junior Natalie Lozano, president of
Stanford Students for Life, a pro-life group.
Over the past three decades, however, the ad
vancements in medical technology and increasing
concern for women's safety have transformed abor
tion into a relatively low-risk clinical procedure. An
uncomplicated surgical abortion usually lasts less
than 20 minutes and does not require overnight stay
in a hospital or clinic. Today, abortion is 11 times
safer than carrying a pregnancy to term and nearly
twice as safe as a penicillin injection.
On the other hand, clandestine abortions, common
in countries where the procedure is illegal, continue to
pose a grave threat to women's lives all over the world.
While many Stanford students think of back-alley abor
tions as an issue that exists only in movies like "Dirty
Dancing" or "Cider House Rules," 20 million women in
the developing world undergo unsafe abortions each
year. Often performed by unskilled and ill-equipped
medical personnel, unsafe abortions frequently lead to
sepsis, bleeding, infertility and maternal death. Compli

cations from unsafe abortion cause nearly 70,000 mater
nal deaths every year, accounting for 13 percent of the
global burden of maternal mortality.
Senior Rebecca Allen is convinced that the only way
to eradicate the danger of underground abortions is to
legalize the procedure.
"Women will have abortions, women will want abor
tions, and this fact will not go away as long as birth con
trol is imperfect," Allen said. "Adoption will never be
easy — physically or psychologically — and pregnancy
for nine months prior to adoption will never be as real
istic an option for most women as it may sound. There
fore, the humane and moral decision for any society is to
make abortion legal. If you truly value life, don't pro
hibit abortion — otherwise, many women will lose their
health and lives."
