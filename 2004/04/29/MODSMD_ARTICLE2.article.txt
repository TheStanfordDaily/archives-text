# Panel says nation is divided on upcoming presidential election
## Some profs, predict a Kerry victory, but no big change 
### ZACH DEMBO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The national presidential campaign is extremely
close but not particularly significant, according to a
group of five Stanford professors who engaged in a
panel yesterday evening. The panel, sponsored by Stan
ford in Government, focused on several election issues,
including the best campaign strategy for presumptive
Democratic nominee John Kerry and what effect the
war in Iraq would have on the outcome.
In the end. several panelists predicted victory for
Kerry, and they generally agreed that the campaign it
self would be of minimal importance to the outcome of
the election due to the polarization of American voters.
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody said that the is
sues had already decided themselves, a sentiment that
was echoed by others.
"When the country is this divided in terms of issues,
strategic politicians won't be able to overcome the exist
ing polarization," Brody said.
Communication Prof. Shanto Iyengar agreed.
"There's a debate that goes: The presidential election
is decided way before the election actually occurs," Iyen
gar said. "There are so-called "fundamental structural fac-

tors' that explain how people will cast
their vote in November. Hie two im
portant factors for this election are the
economy and the war in Iraq. Over
time, the campaign locks people into
their positions on these fundamentals."
Not all panelists were so forceful in
their emphasis on the opposing view
points. Political Science Prof. Morris
Fiorina said that the split in the Unit
ed States was nothing new.
"As we go on to this next election,
you see more and more professional
journalists talking about two nations,
about the red and blue states," he said.
"I've been looking at this for years and
I always wonder where they get this
data. At minimum it is an exaggera
tion; at worst, sheer nonsense. The
country is not really polarized any
more than 20 or 30 years ago."
The professors were also asked
who they felt would win the election.
All panelists agreed that it was an ex
tremely close election. But several
had predictions about what to expect
as November approaches, the majori
ty of which favored Kerry.
"I don't see re-election for Bush in

the cards," Iyengar said. "I don't think
any good news will be coming out of
Iraq. The state of the economy re
minds me of the IW2 election, in that
how people felt about the economy is
not reflective of actual conditions.
When I take these things together and
I see his numbers today, seven
months before the election, I think
Bush is in trouble."
Communication Prof. James
Fishkin remained skeptical of Kerry's
chances, saying that he "has a terribly
difficult challenge ahead of him."
"I think this election will be about
the war on terrorism," Fishkin said.
"Unless Kerry can dislodge Bush
from the issue ownership of who will
protect America from bad guys, he
has a real problem. The public has not
really differentiated between the war
on terror and the war in Iraq, and even
if the war goes badly, it may take a
long time before the public turns
against it."
Brody predicted that Kerry would
win, but not by a large margin.
However, some panelists felt the
election would be of little importance
in its effect on the country.
"I've been becoming more and
more discouraged about politics,"
Fiorina said. "1 think that the election
will only increase the public turnoff
to politics."
