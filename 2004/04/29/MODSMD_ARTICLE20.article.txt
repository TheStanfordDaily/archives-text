# Abstinence-only programs: Has sexual education failed our nation's young women?
## 
### DANIELLE CHAMMAS GUEST COLUMNIST 
Sexual and reproductive health is a major public health
concern for adolescent females in the United States. Ac
cording to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Preg
nancy, each year 11 percent of women ages 15 to 19 be
come pregnant before the age of 20 and nearly 80 percent
of these pregnancies are unintended.
Few women — or men — would ever dispute that hav
ing children is a wonderful part of life, but young teen
mothers often sacrifice their education for their kids. Teen
mothers are significantly less likely to complete schooling,
with only one-third earning a diploma and only less than
two percent earning a college degree by the age of 30 —
and most teen mothers (80 percent) end up on welfare.
Teenagers, busy with school, friends, sports and ex
tracurricular activities believe they have little time to worry
about protection. Yet this lack of awareness can have dras
tic consequences: Each year, teenagers contract nearly
four million STDs. Although adolescent girls have been
slightly less likely than boys to report having had sex,
teenage females, of all groups, have the highest rates of
STDs.
There is consensus among government and health offi
cials that these problems must be dealt with by health edu
cation interventions, but the type of interventions to be
used is an issue of much debate. In the world of sexual ed
ucation, there exist two competing strategies: abstinence
only-until-marriage programs and comprehensive pro
grams. Abstinence-only programs present, as their name
implies, abstinence as the only choice in the prevention of
STDs and pregnancy. No sex. they say, no problems.
Comprehensive programs, on the other hand, empha

size the benefits of abstinence as the most effective method
to protect health, but also teach about contraception and
disease-prevent ion methods.
While the federal government cannot determine school
curricula, it exerts its power through the amount of funding
it offers to state and local governments. For over 20 years,
the federal government has provided funding for absti
nence-only-until-marriage programs to deal with the prob
lem of adolescent reproductive health. The 1996 provision
to the welfare-reform is now the major source of federal
funding for abstinence-only programs.

Federal funding for abstinence-educa
tion is now over $ 1 (X) million per year.
Programs that emphasize abstinence
but also teach other forms of prevention
such as contraception are not eligible
for this money.
The desire for federal funding plays
a large role in states deciding their cur
ricula. Money, it seems, can drive what
is taught in the classroom. Since the pas
sage of the 1 996 provision to the welfare
reform act, the amount of abstinence

"There is no research
today that truly guages
the effectiveness of
abstinence-only
programs at changing
sexual behavior."

only education programs has greatly increased. A study by
Jacqueline E. Darroch found that in 1988. only two percent
of secondary sexuality education teachers taught absti
nence-only curricula; in 1999. it had risen to 23 percent.
Are current federal efforts misaimed? In my opinion,
ujing abstinence-only education will cost millions of dol
lars and, more importantly, may cost the health of count
less adolescent females. A Kaiser Family Foundation sur
vey found that the majority of American parents and
teachers actually support the idea of comprehensive sex
education. Parents are realistic — they know their teens

will have sex at some point in their lives — and they would
rather see complete sexual health programs taught in the
classroom.
Comprehensive programs acknowledge that sexuality
is natural. The framework of comprehensive programs is
that students should be given all of the information in order
to empower them to make safe and informed personal de
cisions. Keeping valuable information away from those
who intend to have sex will undoubtedly jeopardize their
health. The analogy is often made to riding a bicycle. We

cannot just teach our youth that the
best way to prevent head injuries is to
never ride a bike; we must teach them
how to ride safely.
Ironically, despite the fact that mil
lions of federal dollars have gone into
abstinence-only programs, there is no
research to date that truly gauges the
effectiveness of government-funded
abstinence-only programs at changing
behavior. These programs are yet to be
proven scientifically sound, and the

ones suffering the consequences are
not those making the laws and signing the checks; they are
the young women of this country.
Controlled research studies have shown that compre
hensive programs reduce the frequency of sexual activity,
reduce number of sexual partners and increase condom
and contraceptive use.
With such a pressing public health concern, it is of ut
most importance that science — not ideology — forms the
groundwork with which policy saves lives.
"It's very disturbing to me that we are tolerating a gov
ernment that substitutes ideology for rigorous research

findings when it comes to allocating public health and
education dollars," commented Prof. Laurie Schwab
Zabin of the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg
School of Public Health.
With no evidence that abstinence-only programs are
the best way to solve these health problems, why should
our tax money go exclusively to these programs?
In June 2001, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. David
Satcher disagreed publicly with the Bush administration
when he advocated the need for teens to receive complete
and accurate sex education, including information on con
traception usage.
"We cannot afford the consequences of continued or
selective silence, Satcher asserted. "It is necessary to find
common ground, balancing diversity of opinion with the
best available scientific evidence and best practice models
— to improve the health of our nation."
I personally met much frustration with abstinence-only
policies while working in the U.S. Office on Women's
Health in Washington D.C. last quarter. In helping create
resource Web sites for adolescent girls, I was unable to
even provide links to pages that referred to contraception.
I can think of no other public health concern that we ap
proach with the strategy of censorship. The federal gov
ernment must create evaluations that validly assess the ef
fectiveness of different types of programs to change be
havior in the long term. At a federal level, we have to be
willing to ask these questions. More importantly, we also
have to accept the answers.
