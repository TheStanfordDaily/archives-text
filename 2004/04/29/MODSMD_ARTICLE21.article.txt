## Female infanticide and sex-selective abortion: The aftermath of China's one-child policy 
### CHARLES FENG HEALTH COLUMNIST 
Deep in the heartland of Henan Province
lies the Wang village, the place where my
great-grandparents, and their parents, and
countless generations before that, came into
this world and passed away in an area con
sidered the cradle of Chinese civilization.
It is in this remote locale, some 90 years ago,
that my great-grandmother, Shu Wang gave
birth to her first child, a daughter. Understand
ably depressed, it was the males who perpetu
ated the Wang lineage, after all — my great
grandfather, Chung Wang, took the little girl,
in her fifth day of life, down to the river and qui
etly placed her body, headfirst, into the rush
ing, transparent waters until there was no more
movement. Two years later, when their second
child came out of the womb, it, too, was a
daughter and met the same fate — an un
marked grave into which a body, faceless and
nameless, was laid to rest.
With unswerving ambition, partially a
consequence of eagerness, Shu and Chung
Wang tried again. Once more they had a
daughter. Unable to cope with the psycho
logical misery of going down to the river a
third time, however, Chung decided they
would keep this baby, my grandmother.
Much to their dismay, they would go on to
have two more daughters, although my
grandmother tells me that they eventually
reached acceptance, if never contentment.
Yet I sometimes wonder what, exactly,
drove my great-grandparents to drown their

first two children? I am thankful they decid
ed to keep their third one. If they didn't I
wouldn't be here.
For all the modernization that China has
gone through in the last three decades, male

preierence remains as
dogmatically entrenched
in the Chinese psyche as
the day my grandmoth
er's sister was placed in
the river. In China, as in
many other cultures, sons,
in fulfilling their filial
obligations, carry on the
family surname. Females,
on the other hand, are re
garded with less esteem,
especially in the country
side where farming still
requires a man's hard day
of labor. According to
prevailing notions,
daughters just eat up re
sources, until they are old
enough to be married off,
so that another family
may reap the benefits and
services of a woman the
birth family spent two
decades rearing.
The one-child Dolicv,

implemented in 1979 to curtail China's pop
ulation explosion, is as bureaucratic as it is
complicated. First, a one-child certificate is
issued to all couples, promising a bounty of
benefits to parents who agree to have only

one child: old-age pension, labor insurance,
housing, children's day care and education
and commuting subsidies. In addition, the
government issues a slew of harsh penalties
for violating the policy.

Because of the overwhelming preference
for sons, families will go to great lengths to
evade the rules — especially if their first
born is female. At the same time, however,
the one-child policy discriminates against

women. When implementing methods of
birth control, the government arms its ar
mada of medical personnel with knowl
edge on performing lUD insertion, tubec
tomies, vasectomies and induced abortion

— although vasectomies,
on the whole, are per
formed with far less fre
quency. By resisting con
traception rules, women
are also putting their
bodies at risk: The more
women contest the im
plantation of lUDs, the
greater the number of ex
tractions and reinser
tions of the device they
have to undergo. Ex
ceeding the allotted
number of pregnancies,
furthermore, puts
women at risk for late
term abortions and
mandatory surgery —
should the male cadres,
upon discovering the
women's subterfuge,
deem these procedures
necessary.
I still have some distant
cousins whose children

were born under the one-child policy,
though, as they are proud to tell you, none
of their nuclear families, if their first-born
wasn't male, consists of only one child. In
deed, the luckier families, they would say,

had a daughter and a son. The not so fortu
nate ones were stuck with two daughters.
In stark contrast, when I visited family in
Beijing, also distant cousins, two couples
had one son each, and another couple only
had one daughter. They all happily accept
ed their one-child status, my mother re
layed to me, although they expressed sur
prise when she told them that I was her only
son.
The one-child policy is only one aspect of
China's grand plan towards first-world mod
ernization in the coming decades. So far,
progress has been moving at a punishing
pace. A few months ago, China launched its
first manned space flight, with plans to go to
the moon by 2020. Back in Beijing, the city is
busy prepping itself for the 2008 Summer
Olympic Games. It is all being done for the
ultimate goal of restoring China to its former
glory, alongside the United States, as one of
the world's great superpowers. The one
child policy, the Chinese government be
lieves, has already served its purpose, keep
ing the country's population at a manageable
level, despite its inherent pitfalls.
Until this policy is eliminated, female in
fanticide and selective abortions will contin
ue to exist in China. A government policy,
ostensibly a collectivist movement imple
mented for the good of the Chinese popu
lace. has now turned into a major women's
health issue.
