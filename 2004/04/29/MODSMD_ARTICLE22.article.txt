# WOMEN'S NUTRITION ISSUE
## Getting enough calcium? 
### MICHELLE KELLER DESK EDITOR 
Every phone conversation I have with my mother
pretty much starts the same way. She asks me how I'm
doing, how my classes are going — and then — the
question that never fails to follow:
"Have you had your calcium today?"
I groan in annoyance, but see her point: Women in
particular need to be vigilant about their calcium in
take throughout their teens and twenties. It is during
these critical years that you build up your bone densi
ty. A calcium-rich diet now can save you from suffer
ing from debilitating osteoporosis later on.
Even if your mother doesn't nag you endlessly
about your calcium intake, I'm sure you've seen the
Milk Mustache advertisements put out by the Nation
al Dairy Association that often tout the fact that milk
can provide you with your daily calcium requirement.
But why the fuss? Why is calcium so important? To
start, I'm sure you are aware that calcium is a major
component of your bones, but that is only the tip of the
iceberg. An essential nutrient, calcium is important in
muscle function, cell signaling, nerve function and
heart activity. Calcium exists in a delicate balance in
your body: When one part of your body needs calci
um, your body will take calcium from somewhere else
to supply that requirement. If you eat a protein-rich
meal, your body will secrete more acids to digest the
protein. You might remember from your high school
chemistry class or from Chem 31 that acids need bases
in order to neutralize a solution. How does your body
neutralize the acidic juices? You guessed it: calcium
(well, OK, calcium carbonate). A high-protein diet
(such as the Atkins Diet), thus, should always be ac
companied with an increased calcium intake in order
to maintain this balance.
During periods of low calcium intake, your body
breaks down the calcium from your bones and releas
es the mineral into your blood. While this may be a
short-term solution, prolonged calcium deficiency can
eventually lead your bones to become porous, leading

to osteoporosis. And most women do not get their ad
equate daily intake: 1,200mg per day (although some
nutritionists recommend that those who are at higher
risk take more). Approximately three out of four
women do not get enough calcium.
Although it may be years away, osteoporosis is not
something you can forget about now. According the
Mayo Clinic, nearly two million American women suf
fer from osteoporosis and an additional 18 million
have low bone density, placing them at high risk for
developing the ailment later on.
Certain groups are at higher risk for osteoporosis
and should be especially careful about including suf
ficient calcium sources in their diet. Research has
shown that women who have irregular periods or no
periods (known as amenorrhea) during the critical
bone-building years often have lower bone densi
ties. Women with disordered eating patterns (in
cluding those with eating disorders) or very athletic
women are susceptible to developing amenorrhea.
Other risk factors for osteoporosis include: having a
small frame (this is partly why women are usually
more susceptible to osteoporosis than men), leading
a sedentary lifestyle, having a Vitamin D deficiency,
being of European ancestry and having a family his
tory of osteoporosis.
What about supplements? Any nutritionist will tell
you that real food is better, but sometimes your diet
simply doesn't make the grade.
First of all, remember that your body cannot ab
sorb more than s(K)mg of calcium at any one time, so
cramming five supplements into your mouth at break
fast will do you no good. Second, if you have to take a
supplement, chewable calcium tablets are more easily
absorbed into your system. Finally, avoid supplements
made from bone meal or dolomite, as they may have
mercury and arsenic, toxic substances for your body.
And milk is certainly not the only way to get calci
um into your diet; there are many foods that can help
you reach your daily requirement (see box).
So wear that milk — or soyniilk — mustache
proudly. Your bones will thank you later.
