# But I don't drink milk!

### 
If you're lactose intolerant, vegan or just don't like dairy products, don't despair. Milk is certainly not
the only way to get your calcium. There are plenty of foods that can help you satisfy your daily calci
um requirement:
Soymilk* Check the label. Some brands have 15 to 35 percent of your daily calcium requirements,
while others have zero. Silk Soymilk and West Soy both have 30 percent of your daily requirements.
Almonds: One handful — about 24 almonds — can provide 75 mg. of calcium. You can easily pur
chase trail mix with almonds at Trader Joes or at Tresidder Express.
Broccoli kale collard greens: Next time you're at your favorite dining hall, add some of these veg
gies to your pfate. Theyliave loads of calcium, among many vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
Fortified orange juice: Read the label — only certain brands are fortified. A glass of OJ can have as
much as a glass of milk.
lofu* Some brands are processed with calcium carbonate — again, read your labels (or ask to see the pack
age'when you're at the dining hall). A great way for vegans to sneak calcium into their diet.
