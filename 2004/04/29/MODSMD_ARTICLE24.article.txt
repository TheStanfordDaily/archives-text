# Female Genital Mutilation
## The
						hidden surgery 
### ASHNI MOHNOT 
Female cutting or female genital
mutilation (FC / FGM) is being tout
ed by feminists worldwide as the lat
est human rights violation to pene
trate global consciousness. Practiced
widely in parts of Africa, including
Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and Egypt,
among other regions, it is has also
been brought to North America
through immigrant populations.
According to the World Health
Organization, the practice of FGM
encompasses a variety of different
procedures, the three most common
being clitoridectomy (excision of part
or all of the clitoris), removal of cli
toris with part or all of the labia mi
nora and infibulation (excision of
part or all of the vulva with stitching
or narrowing of the vaginal opening).
The origins of FGM lie not in reli
gious beliefs, but in local cultural
customs. The practice predates the
advent of Islam and Christianity in
Africa and has place of pride in the
rituals of Jews, Muslim, Christians
and indigenous religious groups
alike. The tradition is perpetuated
owing to the mistaken belief in cer
tain regions that a man will die on
sleeping with an uncircumcised
woman or that a member of the com
munity would come to harm on han
dling a baby born to an uncircum
cized mother.
Other areas advocate this prac
tice because it is believed to reduce
the sexual pleasure of the woman,
thereby keeping her desires under
tight control and lessening the de
mand on her husband to fulfill them.
It is also integral to coming of age rit
uals or pre-marriage initiation cere
monies in other parts.
The key feature of this practice
and one that qualifies it as a human
rights violation is the paucity of a
valid medical reason for excising fe

male external genitalia, and the hol
low and mistaken claims that feed
the procedure — none of which are
scientifically valid. An uncircum
cised woman does not kill a man
having sex with her; in fact, she en
joys it more, because her pleasure
giving clitoris is still intact.
"Stopping desire with mutilation
is like stopping dandruff with decap
itation," said junior Jeffery Trevino.
He stressed that an extreme, irre
versible solution for the perceived
"problem" of female sexuality is not
the best solution.
The difficulties experienced while
giving birth, during penetration in sex
and during a woman's period not only
make these normal activities exceed
ingly painful, but can also endanger
her life, especially during labor.
The interesting feature of FGM is
that it is invariably propagated by
older women in the community who
carry out the excisions and earn
power and respect among their peo
ple. However, the health risks posed
by this practice and the excruciating
pain experienced by women during
activities that involve the vulva are
adequate reasons for the interna
tional community to step up and at
tempt to create some change.
The movement has been spear
headed by both Western and
African feminists. The issue of cul
tural sensitivity was skirted fora
while by claims that disparaging of
FGM that translated into a condem
nation of African culture. Activists
today are more cautious about
phrasing their censure of FGM as
disapproval not of the culture, but of
the health risks women undergo and
the socio-political structure that
keeps change at bay.
However, senior Rebecca Allen
said she believes that political cor
rectness can sometimes veer to
wards the extreme.

"I can't imagine the suffering of
having sex be painful for the rest of
my life," said Allen. "And when I
think about the consequences of fe
male genital mutilation, I am
shocked by the attitude of some peo
ple at Stanford who believe that any
thing is okay, any act of violence like
FGM. because it is part of "culture.' I
like 'culture' — but it does not justi
fy every suffering men have come up
with to inflict upon women."
FGM is perceived in Africa as a
cultural custom and it is under
standable and inevitable that locals
would resent so-called Western
preaching about an issue alien to
most foreigners. However, when lo
cals themselves recognize that the
negative impact of the practice far
outweighs the dubious benefit be
stowed on girls, then real change can
occur from within.
A Stanford student from Ghana
who wished to remain anonymous,
in reference to the prevalence of the
practice in the northern parts of his
country, proclaimed it to be "a hor
rible procedure that results from
male dominance and the characteri
zation of females in society more as
property than as fellow humans who
deserve their right to an enjoyable
sexual experience."
Some student likened FGM to
certain aspects of American / West
ern society that also repress women.
"Before we criticize other cultures
for repressive traditional practices, we
should carefully examine the features
of our own culture that repress
women, such as an obsession with ide
als of beauty that encourage eating
disorders and plastic surgery," said
sophomore Ariana Milman.
Added a sophomore who wished
to remain anonymous: "Although I
find the practice terrifying and frus
trating, we can learn from it by con
sidering it as one example of the suf
fering women go through in all cul
tures for their society and for men.
From footbinding in China ... to
breast implants and anorexia here in
the United States, women through
out history have suffered to meet
cultural ideals of beauty and combat
social stigma.
"In this sense, we should not look
at FGM as foreign and barbaric, but
instead try to understand it as a cul
tural custom that in some ways is not
much different from what other
women undergo. Only with this un
derstanding can we work with other
nations to end this terrible practice."
