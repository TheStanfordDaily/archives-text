## Emily says Trade C-Webb! 
### 
As smoothly as the offense of the Sacramento
Kings runs, as effortlessly as they can score
against any given opponent, the chance that the
Kings will win an NBA Championship within the
next four years is about as likely as Latrell
Sprewell and P.J. Carlesimo planning their next
vacation together.
You might think its because of their total in
ability to make a defensive stop when the game is
on the line — and that may be somewhat true —
but. really, what it comes down to is the presence
of one player: A certain Chris Webber.
Webber should be one of the most dominant
forces in the NBA. And to some extent he is —
when the Kings are playing in a game that matters
about as much as a Warriors-Clippers game to
ward the end of the year.
When it comes time for the playoffs, Webber
simply becomes a liability. Sure, he'll put up a de
cent stat-line — with that contract he better do
something — but when the game is on the line
and you're a Kings fan, you had better hope the
ball is in Mike Bibby's hands.
Case in point. Game Two of the current Dai-

las-Sactown series. With a two
point Sacramento lead and the
ball in Webber's hands with 19
seconds on the clock, the Mav
ericks send him to the line,
where he promptly misses both
free throws. Even Shaq does a
better job of making free
throws down the stretch. And
Webber supposedly has a
shooting touch —or at least
that's what he would want you

to believe, considering the number of 19-foot
jumpers he takes.
Lucky for C-Webb. Peja Stojakovic actually
managed to play defense on Michael Finley and
Doug Christie sealed the game with two free
throws. It must feel awesome to be one of the
highest-paid players in the league and have to get
bailed out by Doug Christie.
It's been well documented that ever since
Webber's return from the injured list, the Kings
have morphed from arguably the best team in the
NBA to a team that can't beat the Warriors.
And it's not just that Webber does stupid
things on his own. While he sometimes shows
flashes of being one of the best passing big men in
the game, this year he's done nothing but screw
up the rhythm of his team. After averaging 26.8
points per game in February, upon Webber's re
turn in March. Peja's production decreased to
21.3 points points per game.
And Brad Miller? It's like he has quit playing
basketball since Webber got back. He might as
well be pulling a Grant Hill and sitting on the
bench collecting his fat paycheck while the rest of
his team tries to get it done.
In addition to Webber's lack of crunch-time
offense, he possesses absolutely no defensive
skills to speak of. Or maybe he does, but he's just
too lazy to put them on display, which wouldn't
really be that surprising. In Game seven of the
2002 Western Conference Championship, Web
ber actually asked to D up Shaq and did a surpris
ingly good job. Too had he waited until the last
two minutes of the Kings'season to do it.
Every team Webber has been a part of, with
the exception of the Kings, is currently in com
plete and utter disarray. The Warriors have the
longest running streak of seasons without a play
off appearance. Washington switched their nick
name, had Michael Jordan playing for them and
still hasn't been able to recover from the curse
that is Chris Webber. And poor Michigan is final
ly starting to climb its way out of the hole that
Webber and Co. dug for that program.
And while Michigan certainly paid a lasting
price for the two years they enjoyed Webber's
skills, it certainly seems like that's where his bad
luck and overwhelming sense of entitlement
stem from.
There's something to be said for sports
karma. With every NCAA violation, Webber
got further and further away from any sort of
championship. Maybe he can't perform under
pressure because he's scarred from his infa
mous timeout incident. Maybe he's just a bad
decision-maker. Maybe it's that he has a
stronger desire for Tyra Banks than for win
ning. But whatever it is, it's certainly going to
prevent him from winning that elusive NBA
championship.
But he's really just a blatantly bad guy — he
lied to a grand jury, he took a countless amount of
money from boosters, presented himself as a
poor, starving student to his adoring public and
was basically a bastard — so I don't think too
many people outside of Sacramento are going to
cry about it.
You've gotta feel bad for his teammates,
though. Because they're the real victims here.
They (theoretically) work their asses off in prac
tice, but still have to suffer through being team
mates with Webber, who will inevitably keep
them from reaching their goals.
And other than Webber, you've gotta love the
Kings. Vlade Divac has to be the only profession
al athlete who manages to remain effective de
spite smoking a good three packs a day, Peja is
one of the best scorers in the league despite a
complete inability to put the ball on the floor, and
while not every body loves Mike Bibby, he has the
voice of a three-year old and isn't totally crazy,
despite being the son of Henry Bibby.
My advice to Sacramento: Listen to Chris
Webber's complaints and trade him so that
there's some chance of the Kings winning a
Championship.

And while Michigan certainly paid a lasting
price for the two years they enjoyed Webber's
skills, it certainly seems like that's where his bad
luck and overwhelming sense of entitlement
stem from.
There's something to be said for sports
karma. With every NCAA violation, Webber
got further and further away from any sort of
championship. Maybe he can't perform under
pressure because he's scarred from his infa
mous timeout incident. Maybe he's just a bad
decision-maker. Maybe it's that he has a
stronger desire for Tyra Banks than for win
ning. But whatever it is, it's certainly going to
prevent him from winning that elusive NBA
championship.
But he's really just a blatantly bad guy — he
lied to a grand jury, he took a countless amount of
money from boosters, presented himself as a
poor, starving student to his adoring public and
was basically a bastard — so I don't think too
many people outside of Sacramento are going to
cry about it.
You've gotta feel bad for his teammates,
though. Because they're the real victims here.
They (theoretically) work their asses off in prac
tice, but still have to suffer through being team
mates with Webber, who will inevitably keep
them from reaching their goals.
And other than Webber, you've gotta love the
Kings. Vlade Divac has to be the only profession
al athlete who manages to remain effective de
spite smoking a good three packs a day, Peja is
one of the best scorers in the league despite a
complete inability to put the ball on the floor, and
while not every body loves Mike Bibby, he has the
voice of a three-year old and isn't totally crazy,
despite being the son of Henry Bibby.
My advice to Sacramento: Listen to Chris
Webber's complaints and trade him so that
there's some chance of the Kings winning a
Championship.

As smoothly as the offense of the Sacramento
Kings runs, as effortlessly as they can score
against any given opponent, the chance that the
Kings will win an NBA Championship within the
next four years is about as likely as Latrell
Sprewell and P.J. Carlesimo planning their next
vacation together.
You might think its because of their total in
ability to make a defensive stop when the game is
on the line — and that may be somewhat true —
but. really, what it comes down to is the presence
of one player: A certain Chris Webber.
Webber should be one of the most dominant
forces in the NBA. And to some extent he is —
when the Kings are playing in a game that matters
about as much as a Warriors-Clippers game to
ward the end of the year.
When it comes time for the playoffs, Webber
simply becomes a liability. Sure, he'll put up a de
cent stat-line — with that contract he better do
something — but when the game is on the line
and you're a Kings fan, you had better hope the
ball is in Mike Bibby's hands.
Case in point. Game Two of the current Dai-

las-Sactown series. With a two
point Sacramento lead and the
ball in Webber's hands with 19
seconds on the clock, the Mav
ericks send him to the line,
where he promptly misses both
free throws. Even Shaq does a
better job of making free
throws down the stretch. And
Webber supposedly has a
shooting touch —or at least
that's what he would want you

to believe, considering the number of 19-foot
jumpers he takes.
Lucky for C-Webb. Peja Stojakovic actually
managed to play defense on Michael Finley and
Doug Christie sealed the game with two free
throws. It must feel awesome to be one of the
highest-paid players in the league and have to get
bailed out by Doug Christie.
It's been well documented that ever since
Webber's return from the injured list, the Kings
have morphed from arguably the best team in the
NBA to a team that can't beat the Warriors.
And it's not just that Webber does stupid
things on his own. While he sometimes shows
flashes of being one of the best passing big men in
the game, this year he's done nothing but screw
up the rhythm of his team. After averaging 26.8
points per game in February, upon Webber's re
turn in March. Peja's production decreased to
21.3 points points per game.
And Brad Miller? It's like he has quit playing
basketball since Webber got back. He might as
well be pulling a Grant Hill and sitting on the
bench collecting his fat paycheck while the rest of
his team tries to get it done.
In addition to Webber's lack of crunch-time
offense, he possesses absolutely no defensive
skills to speak of. Or maybe he does, but he's just
too lazy to put them on display, which wouldn't
really be that surprising. In Game seven of the
2002 Western Conference Championship, Web
ber actually asked to D up Shaq and did a surpris
ingly good job. Too had he waited until the last
two minutes of the Kings'season to do it.
Every team Webber has been a part of, with
the exception of the Kings, is currently in com
plete and utter disarray. The Warriors have the
longest running streak of seasons without a play
off appearance. Washington switched their nick
name, had Michael Jordan playing for them and
still hasn't been able to recover from the curse
that is Chris Webber. And poor Michigan is final
ly starting to climb its way out of the hole that
Webber and Co. dug for that program.
