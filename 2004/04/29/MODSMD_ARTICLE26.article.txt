# Blauwet wins Marathon
## 
### MARK THOMA MANAGING EDITOR 
Medical student Cheri Blauwet says she got into racing almost
by accident.
But with Blauwet, who won the Boston Marathon women's
wheelchair race on April 19 in one hour, 39 minutes 53 seconds —
and won four medals in wheelchair sprints at the 2(XX) Paralympics
— it's clear that there is nothing accidental about Blauwet's abili
ties.
Although a farm accident at age one left the lowa native a para
plegic. Blauwet has never looked back.
"I was born into a lucky situation," she said. "From the get-go, I
was never allowed to feel pity for myself, but rather I was positive
ly encouraged to overcome and do what I could."
And on April 19, Blauwet did more than someone who only re
cently transitioned from sprints to distance racing, outworking and
outthinking her opponents in the world's premier marathon.
Blauwet fell behind the leaders early in the race and saw two of
the four frontrunners drop out of the race, but chose to stay back
until making her move at mile 18.
"It turned out that [the leaders] were both really, really good
coasters, and I'm not, my strength in is in hills," she said. "St) I just
tried to lay low and conserve for the first part, because 1 knew I was
not going to outcoast them or make a move until I got to the hills."
Blauwet explained that physique and equipment played
a big part in determining her and her competitors' racing
strategies.
"I think I'm lighter than a lot of those women and the raw
weight that you carry ends up being reflected (in that] 1 coast badly
and I climb well." she said. "I chose to go with the lighter [wheels],
which I was nervous about because it's primarily a downhill race,
but I knew my move was going to be on the climb."
Blauwet's unusual climbing ability could be attributed in part to
her sprint training. But while she was a premier sprinter, she wasn't
fully satisfied with it.
"I started to get kind of tired of it." she said. "I took some time
off and decided when I came back that I was going to concentrate
on marathons... I found more personal satisfaction in that [and]
that inspired me personally to take this and say that I was going to
be one of the big names in this spoil."
Although wearied of track, getting tired doesn't seem to be
something that happens to Blauwet very often.
She graduated from the University of Arizona with a 4.0 CPA
and was accepted into Stanford's medical school, where the 23-
year-old has yet to pick a speciality.
"I'll probably end up in ethics and policy, more big-picture
stuff," Blauwet said. "Something that will allow me to keep in
touch with the larger picture."
In keeping with this big-picture focus, Blauwet founded an ad
vocacy group right after she left Arizona. The International Insti
tute for Disability Advocacy provides scholarships for disabled stu
dents from developing nations to come to Arizona for their studies
— so long as they agree to return to their home nation after thev
