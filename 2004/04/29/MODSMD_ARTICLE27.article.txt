# Barnikow started late, but she may finish first

### MIA R. LEE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Senior Lauren Barnikow (31-4) has
gone undefeated in singles dual match play
two years in a row and has not dropped a
match since January.
For the last three years. Barnikow has
been named to the ITA Ail-American dou
bles team, an elite honor granted for being
high-seeded or reaching the Round of 16 in
NCAA Championship competition.
For the last two years, the Cardinal's No.
4 singles player has also made the ITA All-
American singles team.
And, let's be honest, how many of us
skipped high-school P.E. to play interna
tional-caliber tennis in Brazil?
Based on Barnikow's seasoned host of
achievements alone, it's no surprise that
such a confident and collected player comes
along only once in a very rare while. Un
derlying her uncommon success story, how
ever, is a kid-tested, mother-approved
moral that endears us all, even if the rest of
us had to endure the likes of beginning bas
ketball and phys. ed.
As Barnikow finishes her fourth and
final year on the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, she can fondly recall
the days when her youthful competitors
were less than kind to her at "Hot Shots"
tennis club near her hometown of Wood
bridge, N.J.
"I remember getting beaten really badly

in the first tournaments I played when I was
12 or 13," Barnikow said. "That's when I
began to get really motivated to improve
myself and win."
Barnikow added with a grin, "My moth
er and I still mention those girls from [Hot
Shots], She used to tell me. They're just
jealous because they can t«ll you're good
and they see you working really hard to
beat them.'"
Without a doubt, home is where the
heart is for Barnikow, who is currently
ranked 50th in the nation. From the earliest
days in her career, her parents came out in
full support, making countless drives
statewide to find coaching on limited in
door court time.
"Tennis was always fun for me and my
parents didn't place a lot of pressure tin
me." Barnikow said. "They just told me two
things: Have a good attitude and always
hustle."
A turning point in Barnikow's career
came after she clinched her first national
title at the USTA Girls' 16 National Cham
pionship in 1997. Ending the juniors season
ranked No. 5, Barnikow had begun Hying to
Atlanta. Ga., for more serious coaching —
not to mention joining the national team,
which travels worldwide for competition.
Barnikow rounded out her run in the ju
nior circuit with a No. 2 ranking in the
Girls' 18 division. In their continued sup-


Senior Lauren Barnikow has dominated this year, compiling a record of 31 -4, and she

port, her family temporarily relocat
ed to Tampa, Fla., where she flour
ished at the International Tennis
Academy.
11l collegiate matches later,
Barnikow has seen it all. Since her
freshman year, she has been part of
perpetually top-ranked doubles
teams in the nation, competing in
2001 with Lauren Kalvaria and cur
rently with Erin Burdette, a junior.
"Winning NCAAs my freshman
year represents the pinnacle of col
lege tennis to me," Barnikow said.
"We went undefeated that year and I
would love to do that again this year."
Perhaps Barnikow's playing dou
bles with Burdette was destiny. The
duo competed together in the junior
circuit, winning the 2000 Easter Bowl
— the junior version of a Grand Slam
tournament —as well as a $10,000
professional satellite.
The defending Pacific-10 Doubles
Team of the Year has bright prospects

for the 2004 NCAAs, boasting a 27-2
record and an ITA Northwest Cham
pionship title.
"As an aggressive baseliner, I've
learned to play the big points and fin
ish things off," Barnikowsaid. "I think
this year I also learned to play smart
and win even when I'm not playing
my best tennis."
Though her collegiate tennis ca
reer is nearing its end, Barnikow has
been nominated for an NCAA post
graduate scholarship, proving that her
hard work both on and off the courts
will stay with her for years to come.
The international relations major will
be considered nationally for one of 29
available awards.
For the time being, Barnikow will
make the most of every moment lead
ing up to the NCAA Championships,
which are just three weeks away.
When asked how she feels about
playing No. 4 in the singles lineup
after moving up to No. 2 last year,
Barnikow truly bleeds Cardinal red.
"I don't care what number I'm
playing, as long as I'm helping the
team win," she said. "If our team can
get another ring, it makes it all worth
it."

final year on the top-ranked Stanford
women's tennis team, she can fondly recall
the days when her youthful competitors
were less than kind to her at "Hot Shots"
tennis club near her hometown of Wood
bridge, N.J.
"I remember getting beaten really badly

in the first tournaments I played when I was
12 or 13," Barnikow said. "That's when I
began to get really motivated to improve
myself and win."
Barnikow added with a grin, "My moth
er and I still mention those girls from [Hot
Shots], She used to tell me. They're just
jealous because they can t«ll you're good
and they see you working really hard to
beat them.'"
Without a doubt, home is where the
heart is for Barnikow, who is currently
ranked 50th in the nation. From the earliest
days in her career, her parents came out in
full support, making countless drives
statewide to find coaching on limited in
door court time.
"Tennis was always fun for me and my
parents didn't place a lot of pressure tin
me." Barnikow said. "They just told me two
things: Have a good attitude and always
hustle."
A turning point in Barnikow's career
came after she clinched her first national
title at the USTA Girls' 16 National Cham
pionship in 1997. Ending the juniors season
ranked No. 5, Barnikow had begun Hying to
Atlanta. Ga., for more serious coaching —
not to mention joining the national team,
which travels worldwide for competition.
Barnikow rounded out her run in the ju
nior circuit with a No. 2 ranking in the
Girls' 18 division. In their continued sup-

port, her family temporarily relocat
ed to Tampa, Fla., where she flour
ished at the International Tennis
Academy.
11l collegiate matches later,
Barnikow has seen it all. Since her
freshman year, she has been part of
perpetually top-ranked doubles
teams in the nation, competing in
2001 with Lauren Kalvaria and cur
rently with Erin Burdette, a junior.
"Winning NCAAs my freshman
year represents the pinnacle of col
lege tennis to me," Barnikow said.
"We went undefeated that year and I
would love to do that again this year."
Perhaps Barnikow's playing dou
bles with Burdette was destiny. The
duo competed together in the junior
circuit, winning the 2000 Easter Bowl
— the junior version of a Grand Slam
tournament —as well as a $10,000
professional satellite.
The defending Pacific-10 Doubles
Team of the Year has bright prospects

for the 2004 NCAAs, boasting a 27-2
record and an ITA Northwest Cham
pionship title.
"As an aggressive baseliner, I've
learned to play the big points and fin
ish things off," Barnikowsaid. "I think
this year I also learned to play smart
and win even when I'm not playing
my best tennis."
Though her collegiate tennis ca
reer is nearing its end, Barnikow has
been nominated for an NCAA post
graduate scholarship, proving that her
hard work both on and off the courts
will stay with her for years to come.
The international relations major will
be considered nationally for one of 29
available awards.
For the time being, Barnikow will
make the most of every moment lead
ing up to the NCAA Championships,
which are just three weeks away.
When asked how she feels about
playing No. 4 in the singles lineup
after moving up to No. 2 last year,
Barnikow truly bleeds Cardinal red.
"I don't care what number I'm
playing, as long as I'm helping the
team win," she said. "If our team can
get another ring, it makes it all worth
it."
Senior Lauren Barnikow (31-4) has
gone undefeated in singles dual match play
two years in a row and has not dropped a
match since January.
For the last three years. Barnikow has
been named to the ITA Ail-American dou
bles team, an elite honor granted for being
high-seeded or reaching the Round of 16 in
NCAA Championship competition.
For the last two years, the Cardinal's No.
4 singles player has also made the ITA All-
American singles team.
And, let's be honest, how many of us
skipped high-school P.E. to play interna
tional-caliber tennis in Brazil?
Based on Barnikow's seasoned host of
achievements alone, it's no surprise that
such a confident and collected player comes
along only once in a very rare while. Un
derlying her uncommon success story, how
ever, is a kid-tested, mother-approved
moral that endears us all, even if the rest of
us had to endure the likes of beginning bas
ketball and phys. ed.
